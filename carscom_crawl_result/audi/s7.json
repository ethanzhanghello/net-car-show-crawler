      "expert_review": "The new 2016 Audi S7 is just as appealing to drive as the mechanically identical S6, but twice as appealing to behold.\n\nThe Audi A7 is a style-setter, a unique, shapely version of the A6 sedan that’s meant to go up against the original German “four-door luxury coupe,” the Mercedes-Benz CLS-Class. Arguably better looking than the CLS, it’s a distinctive design draped over the solid, if uninspiring, mechanicals of the A6.\n\nAnd so it follows that the hotter version of that sedan, the S6, also leads to a hotter version of the car’s more stylish offering, called the S7. Featuring the same hot twin-turbo V-8, suspension upgrades, seating improvements and cosmetic tweaks as the S6, the S7 gets some mild updates for 2016, as well (compare the 2015 and 2016 models here).\n\nSuffice it to say, if you like the S6, you’re going to like the S7. Despite them being mechanically identical, though, the two cars have a different feel to them. But other than being much more stylish, is there another reason to opt for an S7 over the excellent S6? And how does it stack up against the equally pricey and capable Mercedes-Benz CLS and BMW 6 Series Gran Coupe?\n\nExterior & Styling\nCar styling is often a cycle of a few trendsetting models appearing on the market, then everyone else quickly moving to mimic their style. The A7/S7 is one of those trendsetters, featuring a gorgeous, unique shape that quickly found its way to other cars’ bodies; elements of it appeared in everything from the Toyota Avalon to the Chrysler 200.\n\nThe modifications that turn the A7 into the S7 are similar to those that made the A6 into the S6: more aggressive front and rear bumpers, deeper side sills, larger wheels and tires, and subtle badging. Those are the only clues that this is the hot version of the A7.\n\nChanges for the 2016 model year are also subtle: a wider grille and new headlights and taillights are the only exterior differences from the 2015 model. It’s sleeker and less bulbous than the Mercedes-Benz CLS, and it gives the BMW 6 Series Gran Coupe a run for its money in the looks department.\n\nHow It Drives\nAlthough the S7 looks decently different from the S6, the two cars share all their mechanical bits under the skin. As such, it drives almost exactly like the S6. The S7 starts with the replacement of the A7’s standard supercharged V-6 with a 450-horsepower, twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 engine. That engine is mated to a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission and Quattro all-wheel drive.\n\nIt’s a wonderfully tractable engine that’s able to cruise down freeways at a loping, easygoing pace or blast you through canyon roads at frenetic velocities — and it’s switchable in its temperament at the touch of a button.\n\nWell, not actually the touch of one button — not anymore. Audi has strangely eliminated the “Audi Drive Select” button on the dashboard that used to allow you to cycle between drive modes. Now you have to use the Audi Multi Media Interface controller to find and change the setting from Comfort to Sport in the system’s on-screen menus. The transmission can be shifted into Sport mode by itself with just a tap on the gear selector, but that changes only the transmission behavior.\n\nWith everything in Sport mode, the S7 is enormous fun. The engine delivers tremendous acceleration when called upon, accompanied by a sonorous exhaust note that will find you stabbing the go pedal just to hear the noises it makes. The wider track (the width between the car’s wheels, left to right) creates a much better sense of security and solidity, exhibiting excellent body control. There’s none of the body roll the A7 exhibits when you make quick directional changes, and none of the floatiness that makes that car such a comfortable cruiser.\n\nPart of that can be attributed to the S7’s standard summer performance tires. (If you want all-season ability, you’ll have to invest in winter tires later on — or make a deal with your dealership to equip it with all-season tires initially as part of the transaction, if they’re willing.) What you’re left with is a feeling of control, but not necessarily one of precision. Steering feedback is still a step below competitors’ levels, and even switching into Sport mode doesn’t help this; all it does is increase the amount of effort required for steering input. It doesn’t improve feedback at all.\n\nRide quality is excellent in any of the S7’s modes, with even the firmest setting coming across as perfectly comfortable for passengers. The car is an excellent answer for drivers who want excitement in their commute, but aren’t ready to pony up for the truly hairy-chested RS models — in either image or price.\n\nThe S7 has three main competitors, all from German luxury brands. Two cars were created to compete with it, both of which their makers call coupes despite them having four full doors and a trunk. The BMW 650 Gran Coupe is a stretched 6 Series coupe that’s had two more doors added to it, but it looks good despite this. Powered by a twin-turbo, 4.4-liter V-8, it nearly matches the power available from the S7 but starts roughly $7,000-$10,000 higher depending on whether you specify all-wheel drive or not.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz CLS550 is a V-8-powered version of that company’s four-door luxury coupe, and while it’s a little less expensive and less powerful than the S7, stepping up to the fire-breathing CLS63 AMG is a hundred-thousand-dollar proposition before you even add any options.\n\nThe S7’s third competitor is the Porsche Panamera, a four-door coupe that comes in a bewildering array of styles and even two wheelbase lengths. At a starting price comparable to the S7, the base version is short on horsepower — only 310 from its V-6 engine. As a four-door that’s much more dedicated to being a sports car, though, it can hold its own against the S7, given it’s more than 500 pounds lighter.\n\nThe EPA rates the S7 at 17/27/21 mpg city/highway/combined. It’s a rather respectable rating given the big engine and the vehicle’s speedy capabilities. It’s slightly better than the Mercedes in this regard: The CLS550 is rated 17/26/21 mpg with rear-wheel drive and 17/25/20 mpg with all-wheel drive. The BMW 650 Gran Coupe is rated 17/25/20 mpg with rear-drive and 15/24/18 mpg with all-wheel drive.\n\nThe only competitor to beat the S7 is the Panamera, which in all-wheel-drive trim manages 18/27/21 mpg, matching the S6 and beating the S7 by 1 mpg in the city.\n\nInterior\nSitting in and piloting the S7 feels almost exactly like piloting the S6, with one notable exception — headroom and visibility are notably worse than in the more upright sedan. This is the price one pays for the S7’s much more aggressive style. Headroom is at a premium, with my very short hair brushing against the headliner despite my comfortable sport seat being in the lowest position.\n\nRearward and side visibility suffers, as well; you’ll rely on the blind spot warning system more than you might normally while changing lanes or backing up.\n\nAside from the sacrifice of headroom for style, the S7’s interior is just as lovely as ever. The optional tuxedo-pinstriped wood looks amazing, and all the interior bits are fastened and glued together with a solidity and precision that other automakers have been trying to emulate for years. One never gets into an expensive Audi and wonders where their hard-earned money has been spent; it’s right there on display, and you can reach out and touch it.\n\nMercedes-Benz has just about caught up to Audi in terms of interior opulence. The CLS550 is just as nice inside, but the 650 Gran Coupe looks Spartan and less special in this company, with hard interior plastics and shapes that don’t convey as much luxury feel as either the Audi or the Benz. The Porsche is very comfortable and highly styled, with an interior that’s more spaceship than automobile. It too, though, is well put together and feels expensive.\n\nIn terms of room, the Audi has a decent amount of it up front but less in back. Not only is headroom even more compromised for backseat passengers, there isn’t as much legroom as one might hope for in a car this large. Still, the S7 is listed as having the most rear legroom of these four competitors.\n\nThat becomes obvious when you try out the BMW’s backseat. It truly is a slightly stretched coupe, not a dedicated sedan, and there’s a notable lack of legroom. The Benz feels more tolerable despite being worst by the numbers in nearly every category, as that swooping roofline cuts into comfort. The Panamera is unique; despite having the longest optional wheelbase, it has by far the least rear legroom — yet it comes with the most rear headroom of any of these competitors.\n\nIf you really want the look of the Panamera with superior legroom, opt for the Executive model, which adds several inches to the wheelbase and nearly 5 inches to the rear legroom, making for a truly unique limousine experience. Of course, that option will add more than $40,000 to the cost of your Panamera, making it something of a questionable value.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nElectronics news for 2016 has to do with the new Audi Multi Media Interface system. It’s an updated multimedia package that’s faster, has better graphics resolution and finally features USB ports (two of them) instead of Audi’s proprietary connectors for smartphones. The new MMI retains the same operational feel as the old one, in which four buttons that correspond to the four corners of the screen surround a rotary knob. It’s easy to use on the fly and doesn’t require you to look at your hand at all.\n\nThe new system’s speed is visibly improved (not that the old one felt slow), and features like real-time Google Maps for the navigation system seem much more fluid. Mercedes’ Comand system also works well, with its controller knob that mimics the way the BMW iDrive controller functions. The Porsche system is less intuitive, but Porsche also tends to duplicate functions with dedicated hard buttons, which is why the Panamera’s dashboard and console are littered with dozens of buttons.\n\nCargo & Storage\nOne of the benefits of having a hatchback design like the S7 is the cargo room it provides. The area may be narrow, but the extra height is useful, offering up a whopping 24.5 cubic feet of room. The Porsche Panamera is also a hatchback, providing just 15.7 cubic feet behind the rear seats but a stunning 44.6 cubic feet with the backseat folded. That said, though, that figure makes me question how Porsche is measuring its total cargo room.\n\nThe BMW and Mercedes have traditional trunks whose measurements don’t compare evenly with those of hatchbacks (see details). Their trunks provide 16.2 and 15.3 cubic feet, respectively.\n\nSafety\nThe 2016 Audi S7 has not yet been crash-tested.\n\nAll these cars have state-of-the-art safety systems, including all the latest: lane departure warning, collision avoidance, automatic cruise control and more — but it comes at a price. Very little of it comes standard on the Audi — all you get is a backup camera, airbags and a collision preparation system. Items like lane keep assist, automatic cruise control with stop-and-go, blind spot warning systems and more are bundled into technology option packages.\n\nIt’s no different with any of the S7’s competitors, however. See everything that comes standard on the S7 here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nLike the S6, it’s quite a price jump to go from the A7 to the S7, but that money goes toward significant equipment upgrades. The standard S7 starts at $83,825, including a destination fee, and climbs from there. Any paint color other than black, white or red will cost you $575, while options are bundled into packages such as the Driver Assistance Package, which includes adaptive cruise control, lane assist, a corner-view camera and more for $2,450. There’s also a Sport Package that brings electronic steering, a sport differential and sport exhaust for $3,500. Check all the boxes and the S7 can top $103,000.\n\nCompetitors are similarly priced, but not exactly the same. The closest may be the BMW 650 Gran Coupe, which comes in rear-wheel-drive form for $91,095 or all-wheel-drive for $94,095. Like the S7, not much comes standard even at that price. Adding all the electronic safety systems and sport packages will quickly bring up the price, easily topping $123,000 for a fully loaded model.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz CLS-Class starts with the V-6 powered CLS400, but that’s more a match for the A7. To go toe-to-toe with the hotter S7, step up to the V-8-powered CLS550, which starts at $74,125 in rear-wheel-drive configuration. It’s $76,625 for all-wheel drive. Loaded up, it comes in just under $100,000 but features some unique options, like an illuminated star logo and active multicontour adjustable seats.\n\nThe king of the price range is the Porsche Panamera, which starts at $79,095 for a basic rear-wheel-drive model and can stretch up to nearly $265,000 for an Exclusive Series model. The model most comparable to the Audi S7 is the $83,795 Panamera4 with all-wheel drive, but to get an engine that puts out as much power, you’ll have to pony up for a Panamera 4S and its 420-hp, twin-turbo V-6. It starts at $94,195, but don’t think you’ll pay that much for it, as Porsche options always boost sticker prices quickly. Compare all four competitors here.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nAudi’s new coupe-like four-door hatchback, the A7, gets an S7 performance variant for 2013. A twin-turbo V-8 is standard, allowing the S7 to hit 60 mph in less than 5 seconds. Competitors include the Mercedes-Benz CLS550 and Porsche Panamera S.\n\nExterior\nAn adaptive air suspension lowers overall ride height 0.4 inch. Nineteen-inch alloy wheels are standard, with 20s optional. Overall differences are subtle, however. Changes to the grille and bumper are hard to pick out. Quad tailpipes and S7 badges are the chief giveaway, but many onlookers could confuse the S7 and A7.\n\nAt highway speeds, a rear spoiler automatically deploys, enhancing stability.\nInterior\nThe S7 gets unique instruments and diamond-stitched, one-piece sport seats with S7 embossments. Shoppers have a choice of four interior trims. Amid the controls, Audi’s drive select program lets drivers customize their settings or choose between three settings for drivetrain, steering and suspension response.\n\nAudi’s latest Multi-Media Interface is standard; like in the A8, it has a thumb pad for scrawling out addresses. A navigation system with Google Earth overlays is standard, as is a surround-sound Bose stereo. Massaging seats and Bang & Olufsen audio are optional.\nUnder the Hood\nDisplacing just 4.0 liters, the S7’s twin-turbo V-8 makes 420 horsepower and 406 pounds-feet of torque, enough to hit 60 mph in less than 4.9 seconds. The V-8 has cylinder deactivation, which shuts fuel to four cylinders under relaxed driving situations.\n\nThe S7’s Quattro all-wheel drive gets a sport differential that actively distributes power between the left and right rear wheels. A seven-speed automatic transmission is standard, as is an adaptive air suspension.\nSafety\nA bevy of airbags plus antilock brakes and an electronic stability system are standard. Options include lane departure and blind spot warning systems, forward collision warning with automatic braking, and night vision with pedestrian detection.",

      "expert_review": "With head-turning style, exquisite interior trim, sophisticated electronics and speed aplenty, the 2014 Audi S7 is practically the perfect luxury car.\n\nThere’s no such thing as a truly perfect car. Finding one vehicle that embodies all the qualities and features one would ever need simply isn’t possible. But some cars come closer than others — such as this one, the 2014 Audi S7. From the gorgeous lines and powerful V-8 engine to the beautifully crafted interior and standard Quattro all-wheel drive — what isn’t there to like about this beast? Even the price, just south of $90,000, seems reasonable when compared with far less-well-equipped competitors.\n\nFor 2014, Audi hasn’t changed much on the S7 (compare the 2013 and 2014 models here). The big news this year was the introduction of the Audi A7 TDI and the more powerful, more expensive, faster RS 7. But for customers who find the RS 7 to demand a little too much coin, is the tamer S7 a better option? And is it a better choice than challengers like the Mercedes-Benz CLS-Class and BMW 650i Gran Coupe?\n\nExterior & Styling\nIt’s perhaps the most striking aspect of the whole A7/S7/RS 7 line — that stunning styling. Starting with the low, lidded, sinister headlamps and gaping grille, and stretching to the fastback roofline and squared-off tail, this car is almost universally held up as a benchmark for “doing it right” in automotive sculpture.\n\nI’ve gazed at the shape long and hard, trying to figure out specifically what makes it so appealing, and I think I’ve found the answer: It’s the character line that actually seems to dip as it continues to the rear of the car. Nearly every other car on the market has an advancing wedge profile, with a low nose and high rear, but the Audi S7 doesn’t; it remains low and hunkered-down from tip to tail, giving it a flowing look that implies power and solidity. The deep, deep Estoril Blue Crystal metallic paint of my test car combined with black-accented wheels only added to the elegant look. I’ll call it now: The shape alone makes this a future classic.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe Audi S7 has a more powerful engine than the base A7, a twin-turbocharged, 4.0-liter V-8 churning out 420 horsepower and 406 pounds-feet of torque. It’s mated to a standard seven-speed automatic transmission, channeled through all four wheels with Quattro all-wheel drive. This combination is enough to blast the S7 from zero to 60 mph in just 4.5 seconds, Audi says — much quicker than the lesser, supercharged-V-6-equipped A7’s time of 5.4 seconds, but not even close to the fire-breathing RS 7’s 3.7 seconds. Yet 4.5 seconds is fast enough for anyone, accompanied by a tremendous roar and eyeball-flattening thrust that’s just a stab of the accelerator away.\n\nThere’s little hesitation as the turbos spool up, but with the driver-adjustable settings for throttle, transmission, steering and suspension, you can dial up a comfy limo-like ride and experience, or you can tune everything to the Sport setting and have yourself a full four-seat, four-door sports coupe.\n\nRide and handling are outstanding, with body motions that suggest significant sophistication in the Audi S7’s suspension. Steering feel is a bit more isolated than in a true sports car, revealing the S7’s sedan-based nature, but the adjustability provided by Audi’s variable power-steering assist can suitably ramp up the effort you’ll need to turn the wheel to a heavier, sportier level. There’s even an Individual setting that allows you to adjust various settings to your preferred firmness. Personally, I typically kept the steering feel in Sport, the suspension in Comfort and the powertrain in Normal, which allows for sporty steering with better bump absorption on Michigan’s cratered roads.\n\nThe suspension does a remarkable job of absorbing those bumps — and it’s certainly not getting much help from the enormous, optional 20-inch wheels and low-profile tires. Brake feel is excellent, with progressive firmness and a strong sense of deep reserves for bringing the big car to a halt. It’s an easy car to drive fast (very fast) and a pleasant car to drive calmly. That versatility — combined with the style and presence of the S7 — makes it a highly appealing luxury car.\n\nThe Audi S7’s competitors are naturally from other German automakers who have crafted four-door luxury coupes. The Mercedes-Benz CLS-Class was the first kid on the block in the “four-door coupe” category, and the V-8 powered, all-wheel-drive CLS550 4Matic matches up well against the S7 in price, performance, style and opulence. The BMW 650i xDrive Gran Coupe is also meant to fight the S7, bringing a more powerful V-8 and more headroom to the party, but less rear legroom and cargo space thanks to its traditional trunk. Finally, the Porsche Panamera GTS is more sports car than touring sedan, but its swoopy roofline and hatchback shape bring it into competition with the S7 — even if it is priced higher than the Audi.\n\nThe bigger difference between these competitors is configuration: The Audi is the only front-wheel-drive-based vehicle here; every other competitor is on a rear-wheel-drive platform. All of them feature all-wheel drive at these trim levels, but all-wheel drive is standard on the S7 and the Panamera GTS. The torque split is also rear-biased on the S7, making the idea of front-wheel drive versus rear-wheel drive less important.\n\nFuel economy is better than one might expect for a 400-plus-horsepower, twin-turbo V-8. The Audi S7 is rated 17/27/20 mpg city/highway/combined. I averaged a respectable 21 mpg in a week of mixed driving and judicious use of the go pedal. The competition isn’t quite as good: The BMW 650i Gran Coupe and Panamera GTS are both rated 16/24/19 mpg, while the CLS550 is rated 17/24/19 mpg. As can be expected from such high-performance engines, all require premium fuel.\n\nInterior\nAs good as the S7 looks on the outside, the interior may be even better. A big part is the unique material used for the dash, doors and console on the trim I drove; it’s an optional layered aluminum and black wood trim that looks like tuxedo pinstripes. It’s unique and absolutely stunning in person, and combined with the diamond-quilted black leather that covers the immensely comfortable adjustable sport seats, makes the S7’s interior feel like it’s worth every penny of the $88,970 sticker price my test car sported.\n\nThe same cannot be said for the BMW 650i Gran Coupe, which can’t hold a candle to the Audi’s interior craftsmanship. The CLS550 feels good inside, but only the Panamera comes close to matching the uniqueness, style and quality feel of the Audi S7, but for significantly more money.\n\nUnlike the A7, which has a three-position backseat (of questionable usefulness), the S7 and RS 7 both have twin rear seats with a console and drop-down armrest between them. In terms of spaciousness, the Audi comes in midpack. It feels like it has plenty of space up front and out back, but this comes from seats that are mounted quite low. The 650i Gran Coupe has more headroom front and back despite looking like it might have less, while the CLS has a little less. Astonishingly, the Panamera has the most rear headroom of the quartet.\n\nRear legroom is another story, with the Audi coming out on top by nearly 4 inches over the last-place Panamera. Of course, that changes if you opt for the long-wheelbase Panamera Executive, but that also adds big-time bucks to the bottom line. Outward visibility in all these cars is somewhat compromised by their styling, and the Audi is no exception: The best view is to the front and sides; the rear tends to be obscured. The lack of a rear windshield wiper and washer is surprising, given the steep rake to the window and its penchant for accumulating dust, water and schmutz.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nAudi makes some of the best interiors in the business, and that includes its buttons and switches. Everything has a precision feel, a decisive click — there are no touch-sensitive sliders or light-up flat panel displays in the S7. The Multi Media Interface system is perhaps the best of its type in the luxury segment, an easy-to-use setup that links the four corners of the LCD with four buttons arranged around a central selector knob on the center console. You never have to look at your hand to operate the system; just rest it on the knob and the workings are completely intuitive. It’s more user-friendly than Mercedes-Benz’ Comand system or BMW’s iDrive, and it’s considerably more intuitive than Porsche’s menu-crazy touch-screen.\n\nNavigation comes standard on the S7, using Google Maps to project an actual photo representation of your surroundings onto the screen — a neat touch. My test car didn’t have the optional Bang & Olufsen premium audio system, making do instead with just the regular Bose system — which frankly isn’t as good.\n\nCargo & Storage\nBeing one of the rare large hatchback cars sold in the U.S., the Audi has an advantage when it comes to cargo space. While the trunk area is rather narrow, it’s also long and tall, providing 24.5 cubic feet of room. The big BMW comes in a distant second with 16.2 cubic feet, followed by the hatchback Panamera at 15.7 cubic feet. The Mercedes’ low, drooping trunk lid limits cargo volume to just 15.3 cubic feet, the smallest of the bunch. By comparison, the S7’s cargo area beats the cavernous trunk of Cars.com’s long-term tester, a full-size Chevrolet Impala, by almost 6 cubic feet.\n\nSafety\nThe Audi S7 has not been crash-tested by either the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, but if it is the results will be posted here. As with most German luxury cars, there are a lot of optional electronic safety systems, but unlike some of its competitors the S7 features several of these systems standard. Equipment like a backup camera, park assist and blind spot warning are all standard.\n\nOptional are more advanced systems like adaptive cruise control with a stop-and-go feature, collision alert, active lane keeping assist and a corner-view camera that’s useful in tight urban environments. LED headlights are also optional for improved nighttime visibility. See all the S7’s standard and optional safety equipment here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nIt might be difficult to ascribe the word “value” to a car costing this much, but when one compares the Audi S7’s abilities and equipment with its competitors, its value is quite relevant. With a starting price of $81,095 (including destination), the Audi S7 comes well-equipped. My test car added $1,075 for the Estoril Blue paint and a black interior, $1,500 for the Black Optic Package and its 20-inch wheels and high-gloss black exterior trim, $2,800 for the Driver Assistance Package and its advanced safety equipment, $1,400 for LED headlights and $1,100 for the gorgeous layered aluminum and black wood interior trim. The grand total came to $88,970, but could go even higher if you specify items like the $5,900 Bang & Olufsen audio system or the $2,800 Innovation Package, which includes a night vision camera system and head-up display.\n\nThe closest competitor in concept may be the BMW 650i Gran Coupe, but if you want an apples-to-apples comparison you’ll need to start with an xDrive all-wheel-drive model and add the Driver Assistance Plus safety package, which puts the 650i Gran Coupe at $94,750 before you’ve added any appearance items, special paint colors or larger wheels. While the 650i Gran Coupe is easily as fun to drive as the S7 and features just as many adjustable settings, it doesn’t have the same interior craftsmanship feel as the Audi.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz CLS550 is approaching its redesign time, but the current one is still dramatically styled and competitively priced, starting at $75,525. You’ll need to add a few options — like a split, folding backseat (which for some reason isn’t standard) — and some safety items to bring it up to the S7’s level of standard equipment, but its price remains highly competitive even then. The Porsche Panamera is available in many flavors, but the one with performance to match the S7 is the GTS model with its naturally aspirated V-8 engine and all-wheel drive. Unfortunately, its pricing is way out of line, starting at $114,395 — and that won’t even get you a backup camera, lane departure warning or a premium audio system. Compare all four competitors here.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2022 Audi A7?\n\nThe Audi A7 is a five-seat mid-size luxury car that blends coupelike design and hatchback versatility. It’s powered by a 335-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 engine that works with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission, and all-wheel drive is standard. The plug-in hybrid A7 e, meanwhile, features a turbocharged four-cylinder engine and an electric motor. It can travel up to 26 miles on electric power alone, according to the EPA. \n\nThe performance-oriented S7 gets a 444-hp, twin-turbocharged 2.9-liter V-6 that teams with an eight-speed automatic, and the RS 7 has a 591-hp, twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8. Competitors include the Mercedes-Benz CLS-Class, Porsche Panamera and BMW 8 Series Gran Coupe.  \n\nWhat’s New on the 2022 Audi A7?\n\nNew standard features include a digital instrument panel, 10.1-inch navigation screen and rear-seat side-impact airbags. \n\nWhat Features in the 2022 Audi A7 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nDual-touchscreen interface\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nPower liftgate\nLeather seating surfaces\nHeated front seats\nTri-zone automatic climate control\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nVentilated front seats\nHeated rear seats\nHeated steering wheel\nBang & Olufsen premium stereo\nMassage function for front seats\nHead-up display\n360-degree camera system\nShould I Buy the 2022 Audi A7?\n\nThe A7 is a stylish and functional alternative to a conventional mid-size luxury sedan, boasting a finely crafted interior and strong performance from its turbo V-6. It is not, however, the easiest to see out of, and it doesn’t offer much cabin storage space. In S7 and RS 7 form, this Audi delivers a strong dose of performance.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Audi A7?\n\nThe Audi A7 combines a tapered roofline and coupelike styling with a dose of cargo-toting practicality thanks to a handy rear hatchback and spacious cargo area. Granted, accessing the backseat is awkward thanks to the A7’s sleek shape, and its look-at-me design takes a chunk out of the headroom back there. Thankfully, though, the A7 is more than just a pretty face: Its standard powertrain consists of a 335-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 engine paired with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission and Audi’s Quattro all-wheel drive. If straight-line speed is what you’re after — and you don’t mind paying for it — the S7 is motivated by a 444-hp, twin-turbocharged 2.9-liter V-6, and the even mightier RS 7 comes with a bellowing 621-hp, twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8. The A7’s competitors include the BMW 5 Series, Mercedes-Benz E-Class, Genesis G80 and Porsche Panamera. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Audi A7?\n\nThe A7 family gets additional standard features and a minor shuffling of trim packages for 2025. The S7 gains a Nardo Sport Edition Package that adds unique trim features inside and out. \n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Audi A7 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nAWD\n12.3-inch digital instrument cluster\nPanoramic moonroof\nSatellite radio\nDual-touchscreen interface\nWireless Apple CarPlay, wired Android Auto \nPower liftgate\nLeather seating \nHeated front seats\nTri-zone automatic climate control\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nVentilated front seats\nHeated rear seats\nHeated steering wheel\nBang & Olufsen premium stereo\nMassage function for front seats\nHead-up instrument display\n360-degree parking camera system\nAutomated parking system\nSoft-close doors\nShould I Buy the 2025 Audi A7?\n\nThe Audi A7 is agile, comfortable and quick, even with its base powertrain. Fuel economy is respectable, and the cargo area accessed through the wide-opening rear hatch is extremely generous for a mid-size luxury sedan. It’s not perfect, however: Rear headroom is tight for tall adults, visibility is limited to the sides and rear, and the A7’s price is steep — especially when considering the S7 and RS 7 performance models.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Audi A7?\n\nThe Audi A7 combines a tapered roofline and coupelike style with a dose of cargo-toting practicality thanks to a handy rear hatchback and spacious trunk. Granted, accessing the backseat is awkward thanks to the A7’s sleek shape, and its look-at-me design takes a chunk out of headroom back there. Thankfully, though, the A7 is more than just a pretty face: Its standard powertrain consists of a 335-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 engine paired with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission, along with Audi’s Quattro all-wheel drive. If straight-line speed is what you’re after, and you don’t mind paying for it, the S7 is motivated by a 444-hp, twin-turbocharged 2.9-liter V-6, and the even mightier RS 7 comes with a bellowing 621-hp, twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8. The A7’s competitors include the BMW 5 Series, Mercedes-Benz E-Class, Genesis G80 and Porsche Panamera. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Audi A7?\n\nThe A7 and S7 get a new honeycomb grille design for 2024, along with other minor trim updates. All models now come with a six-month trial subscription to Audi Connect Plus remote-access features. Remote start is available through the Audi Connect app, and a new Adaptive Cruise Assist display is included with the Convenience Package, which is available on the Premium trim and standard on the Premium Plus and higher. \n\nPremium Plus and above trims also get multicolored ambient LED interior lighting, while the Executive Package — which is optional on the Premium Plus trim and standard above that — now includes dual-pane acoustic glass and traffic-sign recognition. \n\nAn extensive update to the RS 7 (which is now offered solely in a Performance trim level) brings an additional 30 hp, raising output to 621 hp. Combined with lighter 22-inch wheels and a 17-pound reduction in sound deadening, the result is a quicker 0-60 mph acceleration time of 3.3 seconds. Other revisions include numerous interior and exterior trim updates. \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Audi A7 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nAWD\n12.3-inch digital instrument cluster\nPanoramic moonroof\nSatellite radio\nDual-touchscreen interface\nWireless Apple CarPlay, wired Android Auto \nPower liftgate\nLeather seating \nHeated front seats\nTri-zone automatic climate control\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nVentilated front seats\nHeated rear seats\nHeated steering wheel\nBang & Olufsen premium stereo\nMassage function for front seats\nHead-up instrument display\n360-degree parking camera system\nAutomated parking system\nSoft-close doors\nShould I Buy the 2024 Audi A7?\n\nThe Audi A7 is agile, comfortable and quick, even with its base powertrain. Fuel economy is respectable, and the cargo space accessed through the wide-opening rear hatch is extremely generous for a mid-size luxury sedan. It’s not perfect, however: Rear headroom is tight for tall adults, visibility is limited to the sides and rear, and the A7’s price is steep — even more so when considering the S7 and RS 7 performance models.",
