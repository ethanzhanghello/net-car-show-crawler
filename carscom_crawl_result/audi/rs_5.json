      "expert_review": "With its new 2013 RS5 coupe, Audi finally steps up to the BMW M3 with performance-oriented V-8 power and a chassis to match, but the lack of a manual transmission is difficult to overcome.\n\nWhen I reviewed an Audi S4, the performance version of Audi’s A4 compact sedan, I noted that it was fun but wasn’t up to the level of the BMW M3, Cadillac CTS-V or Mercedes-Benz C63 AMG. The same is true of the two-door version, the Audi S5 coupe, which likewise has abandoned the previous 4.2-liter V-8 for a supercharged V-6. For 2013, Audi has upped its game by adding another letter, two cylinders and 117 horsepower to the S5 coupe, resulting in the new Audi RS5.\n\nCompare the coupe versions of these competitors side-by-side here.\n\nWhat’s in an R?\nMany features, both functional and cosmetic, distinguish an Audi RS from an S. Key among them is a 4.2-liter V-8 engine, also found in the Audi R8, that’s wedged in place of the S5’s supercharged 3.0-liter V-6. Last seen in this model line in the 2009 S4, the V-8 is back, but bringing almost 100 hp more than it had back then. With it comes EPA-estimated gas mileage that’s nearly as bad as it was before — but only 2 to 3 mpg worse than the current S5 in combined city/highway driving — 16/23/18 mpg city/highway/combined — but better than the M3 (16 mpg combined), C63 (15 mpg) and CTS-V (14 mpg) coupes. All the models cited except the Caddy require premium gasoline.\n\nQuicker Than … Stink?\nBut enough about fuel efficiency. The Audi RS5 is designed to satisfy drivers, not the freakin’ EPA. And satisfy drivers it does. Scribes sometimes declare a car goes as fast as stink, which sounds colorful, but stink doesn’t always go very fast, now does it? (Probably depends on the wind.) The Audi RS5 goes quicker than both stink and the S5, and roughly as quick as the M3 — an estimated zero to 60 mph in 4.5 seconds, according to Audi. Our friends at PBS’ “MotorWeek” did it in 4.3 seconds.\n\nWith its standard quattro all-wheel drive, the RS puts its power to the pavement as well as any car could. Whether equipped with 19- or optional 20-inch alloy wheels, the RS5 comes with summer performance tires, so even if the quattro all-wheel drive makes you think this is an all-season car, the only way it’s going to happen is if you also buy a set of winter tires at several hundred bucks apiece.\n\nTruly a multisensory experience, the RS5 has a terrific-sounding engine and exhaust — at least with our car’s sport exhaust option, which also includes black tailpipes. Only the C63 AMG compares. Perhaps my favorite aspect of the RS5 is how its exhaust barks upon downshifting when in the Sport mode, which keeps the lightning-quick S tronic seven-speed, dual-clutch automated-manual transmission in lower gears and ready for action. Even if you let the car coast to a stop, in this mode the transmission downshifts through the gears and barks away each time.\n\nDown One Pedal\nWhat the RS5 doesn’t provide is a stick shift. Major bummer. The fact that true manual transmissions are disappearing among normal cars is understandable. It’s tougher to accept in the highest-performance cars, whose potential buyers are the mostly likely to appreciate a proper stick. Ditto for the C63 AMG.\n\nThe S5, on the other hand, offers a choice of six-speed stick or S tronic. On the road, the differences between the S5 and RS5 are more than merely noticeable. The table below shows the distribution of power and other specs among the different versions of Audi’s compact coupe, along with the BMW M3 for comparison.\n\n \n\n \tAudi A5\tAudi S5\tAudi RS5\tBMW M3\nEngine\tTurbocharged\n2.0-liter I-4\tSupercharged\n3.0-liter V-6\t4.2-liter V-8\t4.0-liter V-8\nHorsepower\n(@ rpm)\t211 @ 4,300\t333 @ 5,500\t450 @ 8,250\t414 @ 8,300\nTorque\n(@ rpm)\t258 @ 1,500\t325 @ 2,900\t317 @ 4,000\t295 @ 3,900\nManual transmission\t6-speed\t6-speed\tNot offered\t6-speed\nAutomatic\ntransmission\t8-speed automatic\t7-speed dual-clutch\t7-speed dual-clutch\t7-speed dual-clutch\n0-60 mph*\t6.2\t4.9\t4.5\t4.5\nEPA-estimated mpg (city/highway)**\t20/30\t18/28\t16/23\t14/20\n\n\nManufacturer data\n*With automatic transmissions; manufacturer estimated\n** With automatic transmission\n\n \n\nAs reflected above, the most dramatic improvement in acceleration comes between the A5 and S5, but that’s due in part to the A5’s use of a conventional Tiptronic eight-speed automatic transmission. Between the S5’s additional power and S tronic transmission, it’s an estimated 1.3 seconds faster from zero to 60 mph, at 4.9 seconds. The Audi RS5 shaves another 0.4 second, according to Audi.\n\nWhat’s truly weird is the torque ratings, which reflect the revolution we’re seeing across the market: With each step up in size, the peak torque for each Audi engine goes farther up the rev range, and the torque maximum gets dramatically lower relative to the engine’s peak horsepower spec. (In fact, in the A5, the turbo four-cylinder’s torque peak is greater than its horsepower spec and comes at a mere 1,500 rpm.)\n\nAided by the supercharger, the S5’s torque peak is 325 pounds-feet at 2,900 rpm, while the RS5’s is 317 pounds-feet at 4,000 rpm. But I can’t say I felt a pronounced difference between the two cars in this regard. The Audi RS5 has shorter gears starting with 2nd, and a final drive ratio of 4.375 to 1 versus the S5’s 3.875 to 1.\n\nAll the same, knowing there’s a V-8 under the hood and feeling the acceleration build to an 8,250 rpm redline is peculiar for anyone who’s obsessed over cars for a lifetime. I’ve noted the same in the BMW 3 Series, which also starts with a turbo-four and climbs the cylinder-count ladder to a V-8 in the M3.\n\nSee the four models compared side-by-side here.\n\nQuattro’s Pinnacle\nAudi revolutionized its cars’ dynamics when it revised Quattro all-wheel drive to send more torque to the rear wheels. Sending 60 percent to the rear as a default helps offset the cars’ typically nose-heavy weight distribution. The Audi RS5 can send 85 percent of its power to the rear wheels or 70 percent to the front when called for, and it also includes a standard mechanical sport differential on the rear axle for more robust torque management between the left and right wheels than brake-based traction control could afford. It also enables torque vectoring that can overdrive the outside rear wheel during aggressive cornering.\n\nIt’s this change, as much as the greater power, that allows the RS5 to compete with the rear-drive M3 in ways Audi never has. The nose definitely pushes when entering a corner, but judicious power application balances the car’s inertia over all four wheels. The torque vectoring further helps to tuck the nose in. The Audi RS5 doesn’t feel light, but that’s a common problem these days. It’s true of the M3, too, but I’d give the M3 the edge here, as I do when it comes to steering feedback. The M3 coupe is about 300 pounds lighter than the RS5, but I’m talking about feel; in this case, the difference is definitely felt.\n\nComfort Penalty\nThe Audi RS5 has a sport-tuned suspension that provides a firmer ride than the S5 and lowers the car by 0.8 inch — further compromising its snow compatibility. There’s a definite tradeoff in ride comfort. Especially in our test car, with its 20-inch wheels, road imperfections found their way through the RS5-exclusive sport seats and to our spines. Unlike the S5 and M3, the RS5 doesn’t offer the dual personality of an adaptive suspension.\n\nA few of our editors complained about the seats themselves, with one objecting to what he called excessive lumbar support even when it was backed off, and another noting that the head restraints aren’t adjustable.\n\nA Cohesive Unit\nWhat impresses most is how well the Audi RS5 works as a unit — the hallmark of any successful performance car. The engine, transmission and quattro all-wheel drive are well-matched, and the brakes are up to the task as well. Aluminum eight-piston front calipers grip 14.4-inch wave-shaped rotors, a design that cuts down on weight without sacrificing as much surface area. Heat-resistant ceramic front brakes, measuring 15 inches, are a $6,000 option best for anyone who expects to put in a lot of track time. For comparison, the S5’s front discs measure 13.6 inches, and the A5’s are 12.6 inches.\n\nI’m glad I got to drive an Audi S6 midsize sedan recently, because it helps illustrate what you can’t assume based on specifications and feature lists. In that car, the S tronic transmission was balkier, shifted harder when accelerating and bucked when downshifting in Sport mode. The acceleration was generally plagued with hesitation I didn’t experience in the RS5. The S6’s exhaust was also too demure, regardless of drivetrain mode, with no pleasing bark. The Audi RS5 does a better job of providing acceptable sound levels in normal driving and a satisfying growl when you want it. If you want to have a favorite brand, I’m not going to stop you, but no one should assume any automaker does every car as well as its others.\n\nSafety\nAs required, the RS5 has front airbags, antilock brakes and an electronic stability system with traction control. The front occupants are also provided knee airbags and side-impact torso airbags. Side curtain airbags for the front and rear seats are also included.\n\nA backup camera comes only in the optional MMI Navigation Plus Package, which also includes the Multi Media Interface control system, a navigation system and a Bang & Olufsen premium stereo. A blind spot warning system comes in the optional Driver Assist Package, along with adaptive cruise control and dynamic steering. Each of these packages costs more than $3,000.\n\nSee all the Audi RS5’s standard safety features listed here.\n\nRS5 in the Market\nAudi’s compact coupe finally competes with the segment’s top dogs, but it doesn’t come cheap. The base price including destination charge is $69,795 — substantially higher than the M3 coupe ($61,025) CTS-V coupe ($64,110) and C63 AMG coupe ($63,235).\n\nAudi will point out that its price includes quattro all-wheel drive — the others don’t offer AWD — and an automatic transmission. But some shoppers see no advantage to all-wheel drive, and an automatic is also standard on the Mercedes and a no-cost option on the Cadillac. A dual-clutch seven-speed automatic adds $2,900 to the BMW.\n\nDo the math and Audi’s rationalization might not satisfy you. If you demand a stick shift, the Audi RS5 won’t anyway.\n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Audi A5?\n\nFor luxury-car shoppers who like choices, the Audi A5 is offered as a coupe, convertible (Cabriolet) and four-door hatchback (Sportback). In the A5 Sportback, the standard engine is a 201-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder coupled with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. A 261-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder is the base engine in the coupe and convertible. All three come standard with Audi’s Quattro all-wheel-drive system. Performance fans can opt for an S5, which is available in all three body styles and features a 349-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 engine, eight-speed automatic transmission, firmer suspension and upgraded brakes. If that’s not enough, the high-performance RS 5 gets a 444-hp, twin-turbo 2.9-liter V-6 and other performance upgrades, though it’s offered only as a coupe or hatchback. The A5 family’s rivals include the Mercedes-Benz C-Class, BMW 4 Series, Lexus IS and Acura Integra. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Audi A5?\n\nAll models and trims except the base A5 Sportback 40 get additional standard features for 2024, including adaptive cruise control, lane departure steering assist, parking assist and a heated steering wheel with hands-on detection. The Navigation Package that’s optional on the Premium Plus trim and standard on Prestige versions gets added functionality, including traffic sign recognition that activates predictive adaptive cruise control. Navigation-equipped models now come with a six-month trial subscription to Audi Connect Plus, making music, video, gaming, navigation and other apps accessible through the center touchscreen.  \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Audi A5 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nAWD\nTri-zone climate control\nLED headlights with high-beam assist\nLeather seats\nHeated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\n10.1-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nPower-operated trunk lid\nAdaptive cruise control\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure warning\nLane departure steering assist\nParking assist \n\nAvailable features include:\n\nAudi Virtual Cockpit with 12.3-inch instrument panel screen\nVentilated front seats\n360-degree camera system\nHead-up display\nBang & Olufsen premium stereo\nRear cross-traffic alert\nBlind spot warning\nShould I Buy the 2024 Audi A5?\n\nThe A5 offers sleek styling in the coupe, open-air thrills in the convertible, and a roomier backseat and spacious trunk in the four-door Sportback. The S5 and RS 5 offer higher levels of performance and, not surprisingly, significantly steeper price tags. Engine refinement is excellent, and cabin quality helps the A5 stand out among some very worthy competitors. Keep in mind, though, that the coupe’s and convertible’s backseats are snug for taller adults, and luggage space is especially dear in the drop-top A5. Even with added standard equipment on most models for 2024, Audi would be smart to include even more standard safety features, like blind spot warning and rear cross-traffic alert.",

      "expert_review": "Looks like: An S5 Sportback with more ‘tude\n\nCompetes with: BMW 4 Series Gran Coupe, Mercedes-Benz CLS-Class\n\nDrivetrain: 444-horsepower, twin-turbocharged 2.9-liter V-6; eight-speed automatic; all-wheel drive\n\nHits dealerships: Late 2018\n\nLike bunnies multiplying in the spring, Audi’s A5 lineup continues to bloom. New for 2019 is the addition of the RS 5 Sportback, which made its global debut at the 2018 New York International Auto Show.\n\nRelated: More 2018 New York Auto Show Coverage\n\nThe sleek, sporty RS 5 Sportback joins the regular A5 and performance-oriented S5 Sportback hatchbacks and adds more of everything: amped-up power, aggressive exterior styling cues and a sport-themed cabin.\n\nExterior\n\nFirst, a quick lesson in Audi-speak: As with its siblings, Audi calls the RS 5 Sportback a “coupe,” but the model has four doors and its trunk opens hatchback-style. Like the larger A7, however, the Sportback’s sloping roofline mimics the lines of a coupe. Got it?\n\nThe RS 5 looks a lot like the S5, but a few extra cues make it stand apart from the rest of the lineup, including pronounced bodyside lines and flared fenders, which give it an overall more athletic look. Audi also widened the body by 15 millimeters on each side compared with the S5 Sportback; it also sits 7 millimeters lower.\n\nThe RS 5 also wears a wider, flatter version of Audi’s signature grille along with RS-specific honeycomb air intakes, a matte-finish spoiler, matte-finish exterior mirror housings and high-gloss black side sills. In back, there’s an RS-specific diffuser, oval RS exhaust pipes and a high-gloss black rear-lip spoiler.\n\nInterior\n\nThe RS 5 has seating for five, and the cabin borrows much from the S5 model, including the multimedia system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone compatibility. It also features Audi Virtual Cockpit with a color head-up display that informs the driver of tire pressure, torque, a shift light indicator and G-forces.\n\nRS-specific interior cues include S sport seats with RS embossing; a flat-bottomed, perforated leather RS sport steering wheel and gear shift; and stainless-steel pedals.\n\nUnder the Hood\n\nPower comes from a twin-turbocharged 2.9-liter V-6 that Audi says is good for 444 horsepower and 443 pounds-feet of torque available in a wide rev range from 1,900 to 5,000 rpm. The sole transmission is an eight-speed automatic; this is a considerable jump in power compared with the A5 (252-hp, 2.0-liter four-cylinder) and S5 (354-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6) Sportback models.\n\nAudi says the RS 5 sprints from zero-to-60 mph in less than 4 seconds and has a top “track” speed of 155 mph, though that can be bumped up to 174 mph (which sounds extra illegal) with the optional Dynamic Plus package.\n\nAs with the other models in the lineup, the RS 5 comes standard with Quattro all-wheel drive, and the drive forces are distributed with a 40:60 rear bias. Audi says the RS 5’s traction control system manages distribution for maximum acceleration with minimal slip.\n\nThe RS 5 also rides on a sport suspension, and an adjustable Dynamic Ride Control system is available, which allows drivers to customize settings in four drive modes: Comfort, Auto, Dynamic and Individual.\n\nSafety\n\nAudi says the RS 5 will offer a variety of driver assistance aids and safety features including standard Audi Pre Sense collision detection with automatic braking, adaptive cruise control and other driver assistance packages like rear cross-traffic assist and active lane assist.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Audi A5?\n\nFor luxury car shoppers who like choices, the Audi A5 is offered as a coupe, convertible (Cabriolet) and four-door hatchback (Sportback). In the A5 Sportback, the standard engine is a 201-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder coupled with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission; a 261-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder is the base engine in the coupe and convertible. All three come standard with Audi’s Quattro all-wheel-drive system. Performance fans can opt for an S5, which is available in all three body styles and features a 349-hp, turbo 3.0-liter V-6 engine, eight-speed automatic transmission, firmer suspension and upgraded brakes. If that’s not enough, the high-performance RS 5 gets a 444-hp, twin-turbo 2.9-liter V-6 and other performance upgrades, though it’s offered only as a coupe or hatchback. The A5 family’s rivals include the Acura Integra, BMW 4 Series, Lexus IS and Mercedes-Benz C-Class.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Audi A5?\n\nChanges to the 2023 Audi A5 and S5 are limited to minor feature and option package updates. The Black Optics appearance package now includes black exhaust tips and a black rear spoiler, and adaptive cruise control is now grouped into the available Convenience Package. The mid-range Premium Plus trim gets a Bang & Olufsen stereo, and the RS 5’s new Competition Package includes a performance-tuned suspension, stickier performance tires, and an RS sport exhaust system.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Audi A5 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nAll-wheel drive\nTri-zone climate control\nLED headlights with high-beam assist\nLeather seats\nHeated front seats\n10.1-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nPower-operated trunk lid\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure warning\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nAudi Virtual Cockpit with 12.3-inch instrument panel screen\nVentilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nAdaptive cruise control\n360-degree camera system\nHead-up display\nBang & Olufsen premium stereo\nRear cross-traffic alert\nBlind spot warning\nShould I Buy the 2023 Audi A5?\n\nThe Audi A5 offers sleek styling in the coupe, open-air thrills in the convertible, and a roomier backseat and spacious trunk in the four-door Sportback. The S5 and RS 5 offer higher levels of performance and, not surprisingly, significantly steeper price tags. Engine refinement is excellent, and cabin quality helps the A5 stand out among some very worthy competitors. Keep in mind the rear seats in the coupe and convertible are snug for taller adults, and luggage space is especially dear in the droptop A5. Audi would also be smart to include more standard safety features, like blind spot warning and rear cross-traffic alert. These days, such features are often standard on budget-minded vehicles that cost a fraction of the A5’s price.",
