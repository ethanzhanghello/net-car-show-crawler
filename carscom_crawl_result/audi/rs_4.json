      "expert_review": "It’s easy to get caught up in performance specs when considering a car like the RS 4 — they’re pretty impressive, after all. So forget all the numbers for a moment. There’s an easier way to determine how successful a performance car is at its mission: Does it put a grin on your face? For this car, the answer is an enthusiastic “yes.”\n\nThe fact that I was able to review the RS 4 at all is a testament to the sport sedan’s durability. Earlier this month, my test car spent a day at Road America, a technical 4-mile racetrack in Elkhart Lake, Wis., where it was driven hard by a group of journalists. I’ll talk about how it handled the track later on, but for those of you who don’t have any plans to push the limits of the RS 4 in this type of environment, it’s plenty fun on public roads, too.\n\nGoing & Stopping\nThe RS 4’s 4.2-liter V-8 engine takes a little getting used to because its characteristics differ from most production V-8s, which make peak torque low on the rev range. The RS 4 makes its 317 pounds-feet of torque at a high 6,000 rpm, and its 420 horsepower arrives at 7,800 rpm. By comparison, the less-powerful V-8 in Audi’s S4 makes 302 pounds-feet of torque at only 3,500 rpm.\n\nWhat this means in everyday driving is that you need to rev the engine pretty aggressively to extract its peak performance. After a couple of trips to the redline, though, you’ll have no qualms about it, as this engine is one of the quickest- and smoothest-revving V-8s around. If you lay on the gas pedal with the V-8 turning around 3,000 rpm, be ready to shift gears soon — it doesn’t take long to reach 7,000-plus on the tachometer.\n\nThe V-8 really begins to assert itself from 4,000 to 5,000 rpm, and has little trouble pushing you and your passengers back into your seats as it surges forward, all while delivering a whirring, turbine-like exhaust note that’s subtle enough to avoid attracting too much attention (hurtling past every car around you will take care of that). According to Audi, the RS 4 can go from a standing start to 60 mph in 4.8 seconds.\n\nThe RS 4 has a Sport button in the middle of the dash that Audi says makes the exhaust sound more aggressive, by opening baffles in the mufflers, and increases the responsiveness of the gas pedal. In Sport, the exhaust sound is somewhat deeper and makes a muted “blat blat” when you lift off the throttle to shift, but considering the car’s top-tier performance capabilities, the note could easily be louder. I couldn’t tell the difference between regular throttle response and the Sport mode’s.\n\nAll RS 4s have a six-speed manual transmission; an automatic isn’t offered. The precise shifter moves easily from gear to gear, and its throws are medium in length. Clutch pedal effort is rather light — it didn’t tire my leg when crawling in rush-hour traffic — and clutch engagement is smooth. All in all, it’s a setup that should be pretty easy to live with.\n\nTherein lies one of the RS 4’s best non-performance aspects: Whether you’re driving the RS 4 at its limits or just to the gas station — which, by the way, you’ll be visiting frequently with its EPA-estimated 14/21 mpg (city/highway) — the car has a high level of sophistication that helps make the as-tested price of nearly $70,000 (including the $2,100 gas guzzler tax) easier to swallow.\n\nWith so much power under the hood, Audi was wise to give the RS 4 a robust brake system. The front cross-drilled disc brakes are 14.4 inches in diameter and are gripped by eight-piston calipers. The rear discs are cross-drilled, too, but are slightly smaller at 12.8 inches in diameter and squeezed by one-piston calipers. The result is strong stopping performance with good pedal feel.\n\nRide & Handling\nLike the hood and front fenders, the RS 4’s independent suspension is made of aluminum. The RS 4 also features the Dynamic Ride Control adaptive suspension, which is designed to lessen body roll as well as acceleration squat and brake dive. The DRC system connects the car’s dampers with each other and can change the characteristics of the shock absorbers based on driving conditions in order to keep the car flat. While excessive body motions aren’t an issue with the RS 4, it’s hard to tell that there’s a sophisticated system like DRC at work; for the most part, the sedan just feels like it has a firmly tuned sport suspension, which it does.\n\nThat firmness will become an issue if the roads you drive on are in poor repair. The RS 4 crashes over expansion joints on the highway with seemingly enough force to knock your fillings loose. Repeat every second or so for an hour and you’ll be worn out (the car’s low-profile P255/35ZR19 performance tires are likely partly to blame). Apart from this issue, which may or may not be significant depending on the roads you drive on, the firm ride is pretty tolerable for a performance car.\n\nThe RS 4’s Servotronic variable-assist steering system provides plenty of boost for easy parking lot maneuverability, but once the car is up to speed the assistance lessens, giving the wheel a satisfying, weighty feel.\n\nOn the Track\nThis probably isn’t a revelation to anyone, but most production cars — even sporty ones — can’t really cut it on a racetrack like Road America, which has both fast straights and tight turns. They either lack the power to achieve speed quickly on straightaways or have difficulty in the corners. There’s nothing wrong with this, really, as production cars aren’t designed for this environment, but it’s always nice when you find a car that can handle the challenges a track poses. The RS 4 is such a car.\n\nWhether it was powering down Road America’s two long straightaways or navigating the turns, the RS 4 felt balanced and controllable at all times, thanks in part to its rear-biased Quattro all-wheel-drive system. The system sends 60 percent of engine torque to the rear wheels and 40 percent to the front, but can direct 100 percent of the power to the front or rear wheels when conditions warrant. One of the primary benefits of this setup is that it lets the RS 4 accelerate out of a corner like a rear-wheel-drive car; giving it some gas will bring the rear end around.\n\nGood, strong brakes are a must on a track like Road America, and the RS 4’s weren’t taxed at all during my hot lap; they felt like they could last all day.\n\nThe Inside\nMy test car’s nearly all-black interior was quite a contrast from its look-at-me Imola Yellow exterior. Featuring real aluminum and carbon fiber trim, the cabin styling has a serious undertone to it that matches the car’s exterior styling (aside from the paint job). The dual-zone automatic air conditioning system controls are positioned a little bit too low, but ergonomics are otherwise good.\n\nPower-adjustable Recaro front sport seats are standard and covered in leather. The bottom cushion and backrest have large side bolsters, which do a good job keeping you in place when cornering quickly. Lower back support is only decent, and that’s after adjusting the four-way lumbar support.\n\nEven though it has four doors, that doesn’t mean the RS 4 is ideal for carrying four or five adults in comfort. While it’d be possible to do in a pinch, the backseat is rather small overall and there’s not a lot of legroom.\n\nStandard features include a lap timer, a power moonroof and an in-dash six-CD stereo. Selecting the $4,700 Premium Package adds most of the RS 4’s remaining features, like a navigation system, Bose audio, Bluetooth cell phone connectivity, driver’s seat memory, rain-sensing wipers, automatic headlights, heated rear seats, and sunshades for the back and rear-side windows.\n\nSafety\nStandard safety features include antilock brakes with a brake drying feature, side-impact airbags for the front seats, side curtain airbags and an electronic stability system that’s designed to be less intrusive. Rear-seat side-impact airbags are a $350 option.\n\nThough the RS 4 hasn’t been crash tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the car on which it is based — Audi’s A4 compact car — has; it received Good overall ratings — the highest possible score — in IIHS’ frontal-offset and side-impact crash tests.\n\nCargo\nThe RS 4’s trunk measures 13.4 cubic feet, and a 60/40-split folding rear seat is standard. Other automakers ditch this practical feature when engineering high-performance models, so it’s nice to see Audi retain it from the A4.\n\nRS 4 in the Market\nThe RS 4’s closest competitor at the moment is the Cadillac CTS-V, which offers similar performance specs for a lot less dough. The Cadillac is quite a brute, though, compared to the RS 4, which is as docile as a regular A4 when not blasting down the road. BMW’s future M3 should compete with it, too, and Mercedes-Benz’s AMG unit could always drop a V-8 in the new C-Class, but right now the RS 4 is the ruler of the high-powered-compact-sport-sedan world. It is practical four-door performance at its finest.\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "Love is always in the air on Valentine’s Day, and this year my romance came in the racy form of some hot, sexy muscle. No, this isn’t a trashy grocery store novel, it’s the Audi RS 4 – a sport sedan built to sweep a girl off her feet. And oh, was I ever swept, even if long-term staying power didn’t prove to be one of its many attributes.\n\nJust like any romance, this one began with a look. With its strong lines, confident stance and just the right amount of sparkle, the RS 4 is definitely a looker. My test car came in the most audacious bright blue with titanium-colored wheels. A body kit, racing seats and racing pedals made it clear that this four-door isn’t to be confused with its more staid cousin, the Audi A4. This is the black sheep of the Audi family, the car your mother warned you about. The RS 4 is trouble on wheels, and what’s sexier than that?\n\nEvery turn brings a new thrill in the RS 4. The intelligent headlights turn to light up dark bends in the road, and heated leather seats adjust to wrap around you. Bluetooth technology makes communication hands-free, which is good because you’ll need both hands to control this race-worthy sedan: It comes with a speed-limiting device to keep things at a responsible 155 mph. Audi’s famous Quattro all-wheel-drive system hugs the road and handles slick spots like a pro: At an ever-so-tricky McDonald’s drive-thru (it’s the life I lead, people) conveniently placed on an icy hill, the RS 4 handled things like a perfect gentleman, and the meal was very, um, happy.\n\nReally, everyone is going to be happy in this hero of a car. Up front, Audi’s MMI “infotainment” system provides everything from satellite radio and navigation to a lap timer for those redundant trips around the track – or to the grocery store. The rear seats are easy for kidlets to get in and out of, and the Latch hooks are even easier for adults to access. Three big kids will fit perfectly in back, even with two of them in boosters. Lose the boosters and two adults will have all the room they need. The backseat even gets a fancy-schmancy fold-down armrest that opens to reveal two pop-out cupholders and a nifty storage compartment that’s just right for chicken nuggets. Leather is standard, so even if the milk gets knocked over, tragedy is averted by easy cleanup. Are you swooning yet?\n\nJust driving around in the RS 4 made this mama feel sexy again. I rolled down the windows. I blasted the stereo. I sped (don’t tell!) through the hills. With a smile and a nod, I drew men toward me like moths to a flame. I was that hot. OK, maybe they just wanted to check out the car, but I’d like to think it had something to do with me.\n\nFor a Valentine’s car, the RS 4 was a dream come true. For everyday use, though … well, as with all new love, I suspect the initial fun and excitement would eventually fade. The six-speed manual transmission that’s such a pleasure at first becomes a major hassle when you’re fighting traffic or trying to drive and simultaneously open snacks (not that I would do that – I’m just making an assumption here). There is no option for an automatic transmission in this car – great for enthusiasts, not so practical for busy moms. Speaking of which, there’s very little storage up front for the essentials, and clearly the vanity mirror was not exactly a priority for this car’s designers (but enough about you, let’s talk about me). Really, the Audi RS 4 is all about driving; it’s not particularly conducive to the multitasking necessary for a life with kids.\n\nMama warned me about this one, and she told me that everything has its cost. The RS 4 is no econo-box, and its hefty price tag is only the beginning. This is a thirsty car with top-shelf tastes: It only gets 13 mpg in the city, and that’s on premium, 91 octane fuel, so fill-ups are frequent and no fun at all. In the end, my love affair with the RS 4 was a whirlwind one that I’ll always remember fondly, but this Audi just isn’t the marrying kind.\n\n*For more information on the Audi RS 4 and its safety features, visit Cars.com.
