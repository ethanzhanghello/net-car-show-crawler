      "expert_review": "Competes with: BMW Z4 sDrive40i, Mercedes-AMG SLC43, Porsche 718 Cayman S\n\nLooks like: The cute TT RS is trying to shed its “cute” label by adding more aerodynamic body parts\n\nDrivetrain: 394-horsepower, turbocharged 2.5-liter five-cylinder making 354 pounds-feet of torque; seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission; all-wheel drive\n\nHits dealerships: This spring\n\nPrice: $67,895 (including destination charge)\n\nAudi’s small car with a big engine sees a mild refresh for 2019, with a few changes that alter the car’s appearance slightly, add more exterior colors and a new phone box. It will make its U.S. debut at the 2019 New York International Auto Show next week.\n\nRelated: More 2019 New York Auto Show Coverage\n\nThe TT RS just made its re-entry into the U.S. market last year as a 2018 model after a five-year hiatus, so this might seem to be a bit early for a refresh. However, the vehicle that we got here wasn’t new when it came over; it had been sold in other countries already for a few years. Furthermore, the regular TT is also getting a refresh for 2019, and the changes to the TT RS will ape a few of those updates.\n\nExterior\n\nThe changes for 2019 are most readily seen at the front of the TT RS, where the lower bumper has been reworked to make the car look more aggressive. The TT RS already featured the angular Singleframe grille that the regular TT adds for this year, so the changes are found at the sides, where larger air inlets extend to the front wheel wells. There’s also a new rear wing spoiler that looks more prominent.\n\nWheels are offered in 19- and 20-inch sizes, with the 20-inch wheels coming as part of the new Dynamic Package, which also adds red brake calipers and a sport exhaust system with black exhaust tips. Audi also will offer three new colors for 2019: Turbo Blue, Tango Red Metallic and Kyalami Green.\n\nThere was one detail that I was glad to see carry over from last year’s model: the “quattro” in Audi script is still found at the bottom of the grille, though it’s now finished in “matte titanium.”\n\nInterior\n\nChanges in the cabin are minimal; the RS Design Package has been tweaked and now includes contrast stitching, red or blue highlights to the air vents and RS floormats. The TT RS does have one of my favorite applications of the Audi multimedia system: There’s no centralized screen on the dashboard; instead, all of it runs through the Virtual Cockpit, a 12.3-inch screen directly in front of the driver.\n\nAudi also has added a phone box for 2019, which offers wireless charging, as well as the ability to connect your phone (if compatible) to the vehicle’s antenna to optimize the signal. Android Auto and Apple CarPlay are optional.\n\nUnder the Hood\n\nThe powertrain is a carryover, but it’s an excellent one, so that’s just fine by us. The turbocharged 2.5-liter inline-five-cylinder engine pumps out 394 horsepower and 354 pounds-feet of torque to all four wheels through a standard seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. Zero-to-60 mph happens in just 3.6 seconds. The standard all-wheel-drive system has the ability to send almost 100 percent of the power to the rear wheels for sportier dynamics.\n\nThe 2019 TT RS will hit dealerships this spring, with a starting price of $67,895, including a $995 destination charge.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\nRowdy Audi: TT Looks Meaner for 2019\n2017 Audi RS 3 Vs. 2018 Audi TT RS: Performance at a Price\nResearch the Audi TT RS\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Audi TT?\n\nThe Audi TT comes as a four-seat coupe or two-seat roadster. Both have a standard turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that delivers 228 horsepower. This engine pairs with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission, and all-wheel drive is standard. The more powerful TTS coupe is powered by a 288-hp turbo four-cylinder.  At the top of the heap is the TT RS coupe, which is powered by a turbocharged 2.5-liter five-cylinder engine that makes 394 hp. Rivals to this Audi performance trio include the Mercedes-Benz SLC-Class, BMW 2 Series and Lexus RC.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Audi TT?\n\nThe TT and TTS get an alarm system with a motion sensor, while red brake calipers are a stand-alone option for the TT RS.\n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Audi TT Are Most Important?\n\nThe Audi TT comes with a fun and relatively frugal turbo four-cylinder engine, and standard all-wheel drive enhances the sports car’s all-weather capability. The cabin is classy, featuring a high-tech instrument panel, but it forgoes a central dashboard screen, so anyone who likes their passenger to play co-pilot and navigator should take note.\n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Audi TT?\n\nAs sports cars go, the Audi TT is relatively practical so long as you accept its limitations. The coupe’s rear seat is hardly usable, while the roadster’s tiny trunk will force you to pack light for weekend getaways. The range-topping TT RS is a riot to drive, but it’s awfully pricey and will mostly appeal to diehard Audi fans.",

The TT roadster also gains a standard neck-level heating system.\n\nWhat Features in the 2021 Audi TT Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nDigital instrument cluster with 12.3-inch screen\nFlat-bottomed steering wheel with shift paddles\nHeated front seats\nWireless device charging\nFront and rear parking sensors\nShould I Buy the 2021 Audi TT?\n\nAs sports cars go, the Audi TT is practical so long as you accept its limitations. The coupe’s rear seat is barely usable, while the roadster’s tiny trunk forces you to pack light for weekend getaways. The range-topping TT RS is a riot to drive, but it’s very pricey and will mostly appeal to diehard Audi fans.",

      "expert_review": "The singular adjective that has described the Audi TT coupe throughout its run has been “cute.” That’s because of its roly-poly shape, which evokes Volkswagen Beetles of old more than it does a performance car.\n\nBut now we have a reborn TT RS, which seems to be singlehandedly trying to lift that cloud of cuddliness on behalf of the whole TT lineup. While it has the same general, friendly shape to its profile, Audi has added enough angles and aerodynamic treatments to give it some needed menace. This is an out-and-out performance car, with all other considerations secondary — and it looks the part.\n\nThe TT RS was sold from 2012-13 but took a lengthy hiatus before returning as a 2018 model alongside the RS 3 (see my review). The two cars have a lot in common; not only do they share the Volkswagen group’s MQB architecture underneath, they have identical powertrains and RS-tuned suspensions, similar interior components and even the same top speed — 155 mph or 174 mph with the Dynamic Package, Audi says.\n\nWhile I found a few key areas of the RS 3’s performance disappointing, the TT RS has some extra things going for it. First of all, it’s lighter by 287 pounds and has a 5-inch-shorter wheelbase at 98.6 inches. Both of those things help give it some of the sharpness the sedan lacked. (Just beware, because in the TT RS that sharpness can cut both ways.)\n\nThe TT RS sits in rather illustrious company alongside luxury sports coupes like the BMW M2, Jaguar F-Type and Porsche 718 Cayman. Compare the TT RS with those cars here.\n\nWhat We Drove\n\nThe 2018 TT RS starts at $65,875 including destination charges and comes with a long list of standard features, including Audi’s Virtual Cockpit instrument panel display screen, front and rear parking sensors, sport seats finished in Nappa leather, RS-specific aerodynamic bits all around, a fixed rear wing and RS-signature oval exhaust tips.\n\nMy test vehicle added a few other options, as well: the Dynamic Plus Package with front ceramic brakes, organic light-emitting diode taillights and RS fixed sport suspension ($6,000); the Black Optic Package with 20-inch anthracite forged wheels and summer performance tires ($1,750); Mythos Black metallic paint ($575); and sport exhaust ($1,000). That brought the total price of my test car to $80,200.\n\nZoom Zoom, Check\n\nUnder the hood is a 400-horsepower, turbocharged 2.5-liter five-cylinder engine that makes 354 pounds-feet of torque. Audi’s Quattro all-wheel-drive system with RS-specific tuning is standard, and the only transmission is a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic.\n\nWith its aggressive styling and when equipped with optional sport exhaust, the TT RS certainly looks and sounds the part, and it backs that up with excellent acceleration. The car’s measurables are impressive, including a zero-to-60-mph time of just 3.6 seconds, Audi says, and those 155/174-mph top speeds I mentioned earlier. The engine is a good match for the car; it never felt as though it would overwhelm the grip of the tires, and in its most aggressive settings it allows some slip, though that can be corrected with a small adjustment of the right foot.\n\nThis isn’t the easiest car to keep in its power band. The seven-speed dual-clutch gearbox tries admirably, but it’s not quite as sharp as some of the best automatics around (Porsche’s seven-speed PDK box comes to mind). With some practice, though, the TT RS will sling out of turns with a satisfying kick.\n\nThe TT RS requires premium gas and gets an EPA-estimated 19/29/22 mpg city/highway/combined.\n\nDo Chiropractic Appointments Come Standard?\n\nBesides increasing the TT RS’ top speed and adding those front ceramic brakes, the Dynamic Package also brings with it a fixed sport suspension. The “fixed” part of that feature name is important, as it replaces the standard adaptive dynamic suspension, which can change ride firmness to make things more comfortable in day-to-day driving. With the fixed suspension, the Audi rides the same way all the time — to the car’s detriment.\n\nI’m generally a fan of a suspension that’s on the stiffer side. My past two daily drivers have been a Porsche Boxster and a Mazda MX-5 Miata, two vehicles known for superb handling but not comfort. That’s true of the TT RS with the fixed suspension, as well: On the right road (well-paved and twisty), the car feels truly alive — much more so than the RS 3 sedan with the magnetic adaptive suspension I drove recently. In any other circumstance, however, the fixed sport suspension is unbearably harsh; every road seam or imperfection is translated from the pavement into the cabin. Bumps make the car shake and creak all over. As I looked down an alley for a spot to photograph the car, I went over a pothole and my head hit the side window. This suspension has clear performance benefits, but I couldn’t live with it every day; I’d stick with the standard setup.\n\nInterior, With a New Multimedia Experience\n\nThe TT RS comes with a great interior. Everything from the materials and the seats to the minimalistic dashboard design fits both the car and its price tag. The Nappa leather seats are a highlight: comfortable, but with plenty of bolstering for when the car gets sideways. The leather feels expensive in the way only good hide can.\n\nOne aspect of the TT RS interior especially stood out to me, a trait also found in both the TT and TTS: There is no central multimedia screen. In the middle of the dash where a screen would normally be, there’s just three large, circular air vents. The benefit comes from where the multimedia screen has been moved thanks to Audi’s Virtual Cockpit, which comes standard. All of the usual multimedia screen functionality has been added to the Virtual Cockpit display, which doubles as the instrument panel. Drivers still control the system via a multifunction knob and buttons on the center console — the same ones employed by Audis with a central display. While it’s bothered us in the past that Audi systems haven’t used touchscreens, this felt different to me, primarily because the instrument panel is much easier to see at a quick glance down than are center dashboard screens.\n\nIn the TT RS, the speedometer and tachometer shrink down nicely when using the multimedia system, though they remain visible to check your speed. Another feature in the TT RS that I’ve long felt has been missing from Virtual Cockpit is the incorporation of Android Auto and Apple CarPlay displays. Once again, in Audis with central displays, Android Auto maps appear only there, and the Virtual Cockpit displays just a compass, even though it shows Audi maps there when Android Auto isn’t active. Having it in the Virtual Cockpit, as the TT RS does, is a much better solution for navigation if you prefer Google Maps to Audi’s native navigation and always want it displayed in the instrument panel rather than mid-dashboard.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe TT RS is fun, but it’s rather expensive fun. That $80,000 as-tested sticker price puts it in range of the Chevrolet Corvette Z06 and Porsche 718 Cayman GTS, and about $25,000 above the base price of a BMW M2. Each of these are formidable performance cars in their own right and have distinct advantages over the TT RS: The Corvette has 650 hp, the 718 Cayman GTS has better handling and balance, and the M2 is a more well-rounded package.\n\nStill, I wouldn’t discount the TT RS. It holds its own with a solid combination of handling, power and, in my estimation, better interior refinement than the others. Just don’t get it with that fixed suspension unless you plan to drive it only on the flattest of surfaces (or you have the best healthcare out there and a masseuse on speed dial).\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
