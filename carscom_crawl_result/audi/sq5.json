      "expert_review": "The SQ5 is the performance-oriented version of Audi’s Q5 SUV; both models were redesigned for 2018 with additional room and updated powertrains. The Q5 competes against the likes of the BMW X3, Porsche Macan and Mercedes-Benz GLC (compare them). The SQ5’s main competitors are the Mercedes-AMG GLC43 and Porsche Macan GTS (compare them).\n\nMild Hides Wild\n\nThe SQ5’s rounded curves and stately face are polished but hardly exciting; the thrill comes from under the hood. The car vaults off the line and stays strong after just a trace of turbo lag. The turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 is good for 354 horsepower and 369 pounds-feet of torque — a bit more torque than the previous SQ5’s supercharged V-6. Standard Q5 models use a 2.0-liter four-cylinder that’s good for 252 hp; the new Q5’s four-cylinder pairs with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission while the SQ5 gets an eight-speed automatic. Audi’s Quattro all-wheel-drive system is standard.\n\nThe Audi SQ5 powertrain’s thrust is lively, but its sound is exhilarating. It thunders to life like the opening bars of the Imperial March — both ominous and thrilling — and Dynamic mode adds even more snarky, burly bark. Four driver-selectable modes alter the SUV’s driving characteristics: Comfort, Auto, Dynamic and Individual. The modes change the accelerator response, transmission shift points, ride height, suspension firmness and steering effort to customize the SQ5’s driving dynamics along the spectrum of sport and comfort. Auto is the default setting, and Individual can be programmed by the driver.\n\nOverall, ride quality is firm but not punishing. The optional air suspension adjusts vehicle height as well as the firmness of the shock absorbers. The Audi SQ5 comes alive in Dynamic mode with firm, connected steering and sporty handling. The accelerator’s hair trigger delivered more responsiveness for quicker pep off the line, and the ride felt much firmer — even choppy at times. Comfort mode takes the edge off; there’s a decent amount of cushioning, but the steering lightens up and handling loses some of its crispness.\n\nPerformance-oriented competitors match the SQ5’s powertrain in potency — the Macan GTS makes 360 hp from its twin-turbocharged V-6, and the AMG GLC43’s twin-turbo makes 362 hp — but fail to meet it in fuel economy. The SQ5 is EPA-rated at 19/24/21 mpg city/highway/combined, above the Macan GTS (17/23/19) and AMG GLC43 (18/24/20). All of these vehicles require premium gasoline.\n\nControl Confusion\n\nWriting occupies a nice, cushy couch within my brain’s comfort zone, while math transforms it into a waterboarding table. Coincidentally, that’s also what’s happened when I’ve tried in the past to use Audi’s MMI multimedia system — it was more painful than high school calculus. The Audi SQ5 uses the most recent version of the system and, though it’s more straightforward than previous generations, it’s still a long way from simple. Its learning curve is steep, and for me it required studying the owner’s manual and watching a YouTube tutorial to figure out. Even after that, some of the system’s more nuanced layers — swipe left for this, tap here for that — still eluded me and will likely take owners a lot of practice to master.\n\nIn the plus column, the tabletlike screen sits high on the dash for good visibility and has crisp, modern graphics — I especially appreciated the navigation’s realistic Google Earth satellite view. However, it’s not a touchscreen, so the driver’s focus must shift down to a console-area knob and trackpad to control different parts of the system, from audio to navigation. (Thankfully, the climate buttons are separate and straightforward.) Using the knob for things like inputting an address into the navigation system is obnoxious and time-consuming. It also makes Apple Car Play and Android Auto operation clunkier.\n\nThe system earns points for its volume knob, but it’s too far away from the driver and requires an awkward stretch. And the oddness continues: To use the knob as a tuner, you have to bump it like a joystick rather than twisting it. More oddness: The system’s trackpad takes up a lot of real estate on the center console for not a lot of functionality. It houses the audio preset numbers, but its main role is to function as a writing pad — you “write” a letter with your finger to call up a destination in the nav system. Overall it feels gimmicky and is more time-consuming than using a touchscreen system; also, lefties will have even more trouble with the right-hand placement of the pad.\n\nOn the whole, MMI is better than before but has a long way to go in terms of functionality when compared with the industry’s best systems, like touchscreen executions from Chrysler and Volvo.\n\nOverstated Luxury\n\nA couple of things stood out about our SQ5’s cabin — for better and for worse. First, we must address the lipstick-bedecked elephant in the room: the Magma Red interior. The lavish, quilted-leather seats and tasteful Carbon Atlas inlays convey elegance, but it’s smothered by a big bucket of bright Magma Red. Like a well-placed lipstick, that kind of red should be a tasteful pop that adds some jazz to an otherwise ho-hum look. In the SQ5, it’s everywhere, taking the cabin’s finishes from understated to garish. Thankfully, other color palettes are available — like black.\n\nIn other ways, the SQ5’s interior is the picture of a luxury SUV. Cabin craftsmanship and materials quality are top-notch, like the plush padding and detailed stitching on the doors and console.\n\nThe bolstered rear seats are comfortable, and they slide and recline for added flexibility. By the numbers, the Audi SQ5’s backseat offers slightly less headroom than the GLC but slightly more legroom. (Porsche has not published backseat specs for the Macan.) Two adults will be comfortable in back, and I managed to squeeze my three kids and their car seats back there without much drama. My toddler twins’ forward-facing convertible car seats went in without a problem thanks to the SQ5’s exposed lower Latch anchors, and I fit my second-grader’s compact, inflatable booster in the middle. A traditional booster would not fit. I had a tough time installing a rear-facing infant seat during our Car Seat Check due to inadequate legroom.\n\nBehind the backseat, there’s 26.8 cubic feet of cargo space, more than the GLC43 (19.4 cubic feet) and Macan (17.7 cubic feet). Fold the seats to create 60.4 cubic feet of space — again, more than the others. I fit a full grocery run in the cargo area (with the seats in place) and found the adjustable suspension’s lower loading height useful when loading and unloading bags. The cargo wall’s small netted bins were also handy for corralling fragile groceries (like bottles of wine).\n\nSafety\n\nThe 2018 Audi SQ5 had not yet been tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration as of publication.\n\nA backup camera is standard; a 360-degree camera system is optional. Standard Audi Pre-Sense Basic, a crash-preparation system, closes the windows and moonroof and tightens safety belts before impact. A forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking system is also standard, as are blind spot warning and rear cross-traffic alert systems. Lane departure warning is part of the optional Driver Assistance package.\n\nSticker Shock\n\nThe 2018 SQ5 starts at $55,275 including destination, about $1,000 more than the 2017 version and $12,800 more than the regular Q5. The version I tested clocked in at $68,750 after extras like those quilted Nappa leather seats, an adaptive suspension, 21-inch wheels, navigation and a premium sound system, among other features. That sounds steep, but competitors start even higher: The AMG GLC43 starts at $57,245 and the Macan GTS at $69,950 (all prices include destination charges).\n\nThe SQ5 appeals in its balance of a classy, elegant vehicle with a fun factor in a way that few in the class manage as astutely. Its engaging road manners add an air of excitement to the everyday personality of the Q5, but Audi is overreaching with the SQ5’s designer-label price premium.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The SQ5 is the performance-oriented version of Audi’s Q5 SUV; both models were redesigned for 2018 with additional room and updated powertrains. The Q5 competes against the likes of the BMW X3, Porsche Macan and Mercedes-Benz GLC (compare them). The SQ5’s main competitors are the Mercedes-AMG GLC43 and Porsche Macan GTS (compare them).\n\nMild Hides Wild\n\nThe SQ5’s rounded curves and stately face are polished but hardly exciting; the thrill comes from under the hood. The car vaults off the line and stays strong after just a trace of turbo lag. The turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 is good for 354 horsepower and 369 pounds-feet of torque — a bit more torque than the previous SQ5’s supercharged V-6. Standard Q5 models use a 2.0-liter four-cylinder that’s good for 252 hp; the new Q5’s four-cylinder pairs with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission while the SQ5 gets an eight-speed automatic. Audi’s Quattro all-wheel-drive system is standard.\n\nThe Audi SQ5 powertrain’s thrust is lively, but its sound is exhilarating. It thunders to life like the opening bars of the Imperial March — both ominous and thrilling — and Dynamic mode adds even more snarky, burly bark. Four driver-selectable modes alter the SUV’s driving characteristics: Comfort, Auto, Dynamic and Individual. The modes change the accelerator response, transmission shift points, ride height, suspension firmness and steering effort to customize the SQ5’s driving dynamics along the spectrum of sport and comfort. Auto is the default setting, and Individual can be programmed by the driver.\n\nOverall, ride quality is firm but not punishing. The optional air suspension adjusts vehicle height as well as the firmness of the shock absorbers. The Audi SQ5 comes alive in Dynamic mode with firm, connected steering and sporty handling. The accelerator’s hair trigger delivered more responsiveness for quicker pep off the line, and the ride felt much firmer — even choppy at times. Comfort mode takes the edge off; there’s a decent amount of cushioning, but the steering lightens up and handling loses some of its crispness.\n\nPerformance-oriented competitors match the SQ5’s powertrain in potency — the Macan GTS makes 360 hp from its twin-turbocharged V-6, and the AMG GLC43’s twin-turbo makes 362 hp — but fail to meet it in fuel economy. The SQ5 is EPA-rated at 19/24/21 mpg city/highway/combined, above the Macan GTS (17/23/19) and AMG GLC43 (18/24/20). All of these vehicles require premium gasoline.\n\nControl Confusion\n\nWriting occupies a nice, cushy couch within my brain’s comfort zone, while math transforms it into a waterboarding table. Coincidentally, that’s also what’s happened when I’ve tried in the past to use Audi’s MMI multimedia system — it was more painful than high school calculus. The Audi SQ5 uses the most recent version of the system and, though it’s more straightforward than previous generations, it’s still a long way from simple. Its learning curve is steep, and for me it required studying the owner’s manual and watching a YouTube tutorial to figure out. Even after that, some of the system’s more nuanced layers — swipe left for this, tap here for that — still eluded me and will likely take owners a lot of practice to master.\n\nIn the plus column, the tabletlike screen sits high on the dash for good visibility and has crisp, modern graphics — I especially appreciated the navigation’s realistic Google Earth satellite view. However, it’s not a touchscreen, so the driver’s focus must shift down to a console-area knob and trackpad to control different parts of the system, from audio to navigation. (Thankfully, the climate buttons are separate and straightforward.) Using the knob for things like inputting an address into the navigation system is obnoxious and time-consuming. It also makes Apple Car Play and Android Auto operation clunkier.\n\nThe system earns points for its volume knob, but it’s too far away from the driver and requires an awkward stretch. And the oddness continues: To use the knob as a tuner, you have to bump it like a joystick rather than twisting it. More oddness: The system’s trackpad takes up a lot of real estate on the center console for not a lot of functionality. It houses the audio preset numbers, but its main role is to function as a writing pad — you “write” a letter with your finger to call up a destination in the nav system. Overall it feels gimmicky and is more time-consuming than using a touchscreen system; also, lefties will have even more trouble with the right-hand placement of the pad.\n\nOn the whole, MMI is better than before but has a long way to go in terms of functionality when compared with the industry’s best systems, like touchscreen executions from Chrysler and Volvo.\n\nOverstated Luxury\n\nA couple of things stood out about our SQ5’s cabin — for better and for worse. First, we must address the lipstick-bedecked elephant in the room: the Magma Red interior. The lavish, quilted-leather seats and tasteful Carbon Atlas inlays convey elegance, but it’s smothered by a big bucket of bright Magma Red. Like a well-placed lipstick, that kind of red should be a tasteful pop that adds some jazz to an otherwise ho-hum look. In the SQ5, it’s everywhere, taking the cabin’s finishes from understated to garish. Thankfully, other color palettes are available — like black.\n\nIn other ways, the SQ5’s interior is the picture of a luxury SUV. Cabin craftsmanship and materials quality are top-notch, like the plush padding and detailed stitching on the doors and console.\n\nThe bolstered rear seats are comfortable, and they slide and recline for added flexibility. By the numbers, the Audi SQ5’s backseat offers slightly less headroom than the GLC but slightly more legroom. (Porsche has not published backseat specs for the Macan.) Two adults will be comfortable in back, and I managed to squeeze my three kids and their car seats back there without much drama. My toddler twins’ forward-facing convertible car seats went in without a problem thanks to the SQ5’s exposed lower Latch anchors, and I fit my second-grader’s compact, inflatable booster in the middle. A traditional booster would not fit. I had a tough time installing a rear-facing infant seat during our Car Seat Check due to inadequate legroom.\n\nBehind the backseat, there’s 26.8 cubic feet of cargo space, more than the GLC43 (19.4 cubic feet) and Macan (17.7 cubic feet). Fold the seats to create 60.4 cubic feet of space — again, more than the others. I fit a full grocery run in the cargo area (with the seats in place) and found the adjustable suspension’s lower loading height useful when loading and unloading bags. The cargo wall’s small netted bins were also handy for corralling fragile groceries (like bottles of wine).\n\nSafety\n\nThe 2018 Audi SQ5 had not yet been tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration as of publication.\n\nA backup camera is standard; a 360-degree camera system is optional. Standard Audi Pre-Sense Basic, a crash-preparation system, closes the windows and moonroof and tightens safety belts before impact. A forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking system is also standard, as are blind spot warning and rear cross-traffic alert systems. Lane departure warning is part of the optional Driver Assistance package.\n\nSticker Shock\n\nThe 2018 SQ5 starts at $55,275 including destination, about $1,000 more than the 2017 version and $12,800 more than the regular Q5. The version I tested clocked in at $68,750 after extras like those quilted Nappa leather seats, an adaptive suspension, 21-inch wheels, navigation and a premium sound system, among other features. That sounds steep, but competitors start even higher: The AMG GLC43 starts at $57,245 and the Macan GTS at $69,950 (all prices include destination charges).\n\nThe SQ5 appeals in its balance of a classy, elegant vehicle with a fun factor in a way that few in the class manage as astutely. Its engaging road manners add an air of excitement to the everyday personality of the Q5, but Audi is overreaching with the SQ5’s designer-label price premium.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Audi Q5?\n\nThe Audi Q5 is a five-seat compact luxury SUV with standard all-wheel drive and a choice of four powertrains. Motivating the base Q5 is a 201-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder paired with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. A 261-hp turbo four-cylinder is next, followed by the 349-hp, turbo 3.0-liter V-6 found in the performance-oriented SQ5.  If spending less at the pump is a priority, the Q5 also offers a plug-in hybrid variant, the Q5 e, that’s powered by an electric motor and a gas-fed turbo four-cylinder engine. Total output is a stout 362 hp, and it has an EPA-rated electric-only range of up to 23 miles.\n\nThe Q5 is notable for being offered in both standard SUV format and as the Q5 Sportback, which features a coupelike exterior design. Competitors include the BMW X3, Acura RDX, Lincoln Corsair and Volvo XC60.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Audi Q5?\n\nAdaptive cruise control is newly standard in all Q5 and SQ5 models. The Premium Plus trim gains a Bang & Olufsen sound system.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Audi Q5 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nAdaptive cruise control\n10.1-inch infotainment screen\nWireless Apple CarPlay, wired Android Auto\nWireless device charging\nWi-Fi hot spot\nDigital gauge cluster\nTri-zone climate control\nPower liftgate\nLeather seating\nHeated front seats\nBlind spot monitoring\nRear cross-traffic alert\nLane departure warning\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nHeated steering wheel\nSurround-view camera\nPanoramic roof\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nNappa leather upholstery\nAdaptive air suspension\nHead-up instrument display\nBang & Olufsen stereo \nShould I Buy the 2023 Audi Q5?\n\nThe Audi Q5 offers luxury SUV shoppers a wide range of engines, plus the peace of mind of standard all-wheel drive. Keep in mind, though, that this Audi’s option sheet is an expensive place to spend your time; the Q5’s price swells as you add features or move to models like the plug-in hybrid Q5 e or sporty SQ5. The cabin is, however, elegantly appointed and comfortable, and the infotainment system is easy to operate and quick to respond to driver inputs. The Sportback sacrifices some utility for style, so we’d stick with the Q5’s standard SUV configuration.",

      "expert_review": "Entering its sixth year, the second-generation Audi Q5 remains the brand’s bestselling vehicle and continues to be priced and sized to appeal to a vast pool of potential buyers. The luxury SUV offers a broad selection of powertrains, while its Sportback version offers the same basic mechanical package with a sleeker roofline. For the new model year, the Q5, SQ5 and Q5 Sportback get new standard equipment as well as new starting prices.\n\nRelated: How Do Car Seats Fit in a 2022 Audi Q5 Sportback?\n\nWhat’s New for 2024\n\nFor 2024, Audi continues to offer the Q5 in three trim levels: Premium, Premium Plus and Prestige. The full Q5 family receives adaptive cruise control, lane departure steering assist and a heated steering wheel as standard equipment, and all but the plug-in hybrid also add remote starting via the myAudi app.\n\nInside, sport seats and birch wood trim are standard on the Q5 45, while a newly available Black Optic Package blacks out the exterior trim and roof rails on the Q5 40’s Premium Plus and Prestige trims. On 45, 55 and 45 Sportback variants, the package also blacks out the Audi rings and model badging, front splitter, air intakes and rear diffuser, and inside, it adds a black headliner and perforated leather steering wheel. The brake calipers aren’t black, however; they’re red.\n\nAll Q5 Premium Plus variants also now get a six-month trial subscription to the app store’s Audi Connect Plus, which gives access to music, video, navigation, parking and charging information, and more via the SUV’s infotainment system.\n\nPowertrain Specs\n\nThe two digits appended to the Q5 badge — 40, 45, or 55 — refer to the engine output. The Q5 40 has a 201-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder; the Q5 45 gets a 261-hp version of the same engine. With its electric motor and a 17.9-kilowatt-hour battery, the Q5 55 PHEV has a system output of up to 362 hp. The SQ5 engages in no such silliness: It’s just an SQ5 powered by a 349-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6.\n\nThe Q5 models have a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission, while the SQ5 has an eight-speed automatic. All-wheel drive is standard.\n\nPricing and Availability\n\nThe 2024 Q5 and SQ5 lineup will go on sale later this year. Pricing is as follows (all prices include a $1,195 destination charge).\n\nQ5\nQ5 40: $45,795\nQ5 45: $48,695\nQ5 55 (PHEV): $58,995\nQ5 Sportback 45: $52,695\nSQ5\nSQ5: $58,195\nSQ5 Sportback: $61,595\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2023 Audi Q5, SQ5 See New Equipment, Price Increases in New Year\n2021 Audi SQ5 Review: Not as Racy as It Looks, and That’s OK\n2021 Audi Q5 Vs. 2021 Lincoln Corsair: Which Plug-in Hybrid Luxury SUV Should You Buy?\n2021 Audi Q5 Sportback Review: As Practical as It Can Be\nWhich Cars Have Panoramic Moonroofs or Sunroofs?\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The SQ5 is the performance-oriented version of Audi’s Q5 SUV; both models were redesigned for 2018 with additional room and updated powertrains. The Q5 competes against the likes of the BMW X3, Porsche Macan and Mercedes-Benz GLC (compare them). The SQ5’s main competitors are the Mercedes-AMG GLC43 and Porsche Macan GTS (compare them).\n\nMild Hides Wild\n\nThe SQ5’s rounded curves and stately face are polished but hardly exciting; the thrill comes from under the hood. The car vaults off the line and stays strong after just a trace of turbo lag. The turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 is good for 354 horsepower and 369 pounds-feet of torque — a bit more torque than the previous SQ5’s supercharged V-6. Standard Q5 models use a 2.0-liter four-cylinder that’s good for 252 hp; the new Q5’s four-cylinder pairs with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission while the SQ5 gets an eight-speed automatic. Audi’s Quattro all-wheel-drive system is standard.\n\nThe Audi SQ5 powertrain’s thrust is lively, but its sound is exhilarating. It thunders to life like the opening bars of the Imperial March — both ominous and thrilling — and Dynamic mode adds even more snarky, burly bark. Four driver-selectable modes alter the SUV’s driving characteristics: Comfort, Auto, Dynamic and Individual. The modes change the accelerator response, transmission shift points, ride height, suspension firmness and steering effort to customize the SQ5’s driving dynamics along the spectrum of sport and comfort. Auto is the default setting, and Individual can be programmed by the driver.\n\nOverall, ride quality is firm but not punishing. The optional air suspension adjusts vehicle height as well as the firmness of the shock absorbers. The Audi SQ5 comes alive in Dynamic mode with firm, connected steering and sporty handling. The accelerator’s hair trigger delivered more responsiveness for quicker pep off the line, and the ride felt much firmer — even choppy at times. Comfort mode takes the edge off; there’s a decent amount of cushioning, but the steering lightens up and handling loses some of its crispness.\n\nPerformance-oriented competitors match the SQ5’s powertrain in potency — the Macan GTS makes 360 hp from its twin-turbocharged V-6, and the AMG GLC43’s twin-turbo makes 362 hp — but fail to meet it in fuel economy. The SQ5 is EPA-rated at 19/24/21 mpg city/highway/combined, above the Macan GTS (17/23/19) and AMG GLC43 (18/24/20). All of these vehicles require premium gasoline.\n\nControl Confusion\n\nWriting occupies a nice, cushy couch within my brain’s comfort zone, while math transforms it into a waterboarding table. Coincidentally, that’s also what’s happened when I’ve tried in the past to use Audi’s MMI multimedia system — it was more painful than high school calculus. The Audi SQ5 uses the most recent version of the system and, though it’s more straightforward than previous generations, it’s still a long way from simple. Its learning curve is steep, and for me it required studying the owner’s manual and watching a YouTube tutorial to figure out. Even after that, some of the system’s more nuanced layers — swipe left for this, tap here for that — still eluded me and will likely take owners a lot of practice to master.\n\nIn the plus column, the tabletlike screen sits high on the dash for good visibility and has crisp, modern graphics — I especially appreciated the navigation’s realistic Google Earth satellite view. However, it’s not a touchscreen, so the driver’s focus must shift down to a console-area knob and trackpad to control different parts of the system, from audio to navigation. (Thankfully, the climate buttons are separate and straightforward.) Using the knob for things like inputting an address into the navigation system is obnoxious and time-consuming. It also makes Apple Car Play and Android Auto operation clunkier.\n\nThe system earns points for its volume knob, but it’s too far away from the driver and requires an awkward stretch. And the oddness continues: To use the knob as a tuner, you have to bump it like a joystick rather than twisting it. More oddness: The system’s trackpad takes up a lot of real estate on the center console for not a lot of functionality. It houses the audio preset numbers, but its main role is to function as a writing pad — you “write” a letter with your finger to call up a destination in the nav system. Overall it feels gimmicky and is more time-consuming than using a touchscreen system; also, lefties will have even more trouble with the right-hand placement of the pad.\n\nOn the whole, MMI is better than before but has a long way to go in terms of functionality when compared with the industry’s best systems, like touchscreen executions from Chrysler and Volvo.\n\nOverstated Luxury\n\nA couple of things stood out about our SQ5’s cabin — for better and for worse. First, we must address the lipstick-bedecked elephant in the room: the Magma Red interior. The lavish, quilted-leather seats and tasteful Carbon Atlas inlays convey elegance, but it’s smothered by a big bucket of bright Magma Red. Like a well-placed lipstick, that kind of red should be a tasteful pop that adds some jazz to an otherwise ho-hum look. In the SQ5, it’s everywhere, taking the cabin’s finishes from understated to garish. Thankfully, other color palettes are available — like black.\n\nIn other ways, the SQ5’s interior is the picture of a luxury SUV. Cabin craftsmanship and materials quality are top-notch, like the plush padding and detailed stitching on the doors and console.\n\nThe bolstered rear seats are comfortable, and they slide and recline for added flexibility. By the numbers, the Audi SQ5’s backseat offers slightly less headroom than the GLC but slightly more legroom. (Porsche has not published backseat specs for the Macan.) Two adults will be comfortable in back, and I managed to squeeze my three kids and their car seats back there without much drama. My toddler twins’ forward-facing convertible car seats went in without a problem thanks to the SQ5’s exposed lower Latch anchors, and I fit my second-grader’s compact, inflatable booster in the middle. A traditional booster would not fit. I had a tough time installing a rear-facing infant seat during our Car Seat Check due to inadequate legroom.\n\nBehind the backseat, there’s 26.8 cubic feet of cargo space, more than the GLC43 (19.4 cubic feet) and Macan (17.7 cubic feet). Fold the seats to create 60.4 cubic feet of space — again, more than the others. I fit a full grocery run in the cargo area (with the seats in place) and found the adjustable suspension’s lower loading height useful when loading and unloading bags. The cargo wall’s small netted bins were also handy for corralling fragile groceries (like bottles of wine).\n\nSafety\n\nThe 2018 Audi SQ5 had not yet been tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration as of publication.\n\nA backup camera is standard; a 360-degree camera system is optional. Standard Audi Pre-Sense Basic, a crash-preparation system, closes the windows and moonroof and tightens safety belts before impact. A forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking system is also standard, as are blind spot warning and rear cross-traffic alert systems. Lane departure warning is part of the optional Driver Assistance package.\n\nSticker Shock\n\nThe 2018 SQ5 starts at $55,275 including destination, about $1,000 more than the 2017 version and $12,800 more than the regular Q5. The version I tested clocked in at $68,750 after extras like those quilted Nappa leather seats, an adaptive suspension, 21-inch wheels, navigation and a premium sound system, among other features. That sounds steep, but competitors start even higher: The AMG GLC43 starts at $57,245 and the Macan GTS at $69,950 (all prices include destination charges).\n\nThe SQ5 appeals in its balance of a classy, elegant vehicle with a fun factor in a way that few in the class manage as astutely. Its engaging road manners add an air of excitement to the everyday personality of the Q5, but Audi is overreaching with the SQ5’s designer-label price premium.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Verdict: No driving enthusiast would pick a 2021 Audi SQ5 over a comparable sports sedan, but it’s a nice step up from the plain-Jane Audi Q5.\n\nVersus the competition: Most luxury automakers offer a sportier version of their basic compact crossover, and all of them feature the same formula: sportier looks, more power, more tech, more expensive. \n\nThe concept of a sporty crossover SUV eludes me, given its few advantages over a comparably sized sporty sedan for those who want something truly entertaining to drive: An SUV is taller, heavier and doesn’t handle as well, given its higher center of gravity. About the only thing a performance SUV can do better than a sports sedan is carry more junk in its trunk. \n\nAudi’s sportier version of the excellent Q5 crossover SUV is a perfect example of this: The 2021 Audi SQ5 looks good on paper, with a powerful turbocharged V-6, an electronically adjustable sport suspension, racier looks, performance seats, standard all-wheel drive and more. In a sedan, this is a slam-dunk winning combination. But in a taller, heavier family crossover, does it even work? \n\nRelated: 2021 Audi Q5 Doesn’t Mess Much With a Good Thing\n\nRacy Looks\n\nAudi’s S performance models (versus its S Line appearance packages) boast mechanical and cosmetic changes meant to improve the way they drive and look, and those changes on the SQ5 definitely give it a more aggressive appearance. For 2021, the entire Q5 lineup received mild styling updates, and the SQ5 has benefited from these, too, with a cleaner, tighter look. \n\nThe SQ5 I drove was a new-for-2021 color called District Green — a muted, almost dusky hue that looked terrific combined with the optional Black Optic Package’s blacked-out chrome trim. The standard rims on the SQ5 are 20-inch units, but that package gives the SUV 21-inch, two-tone wheels with summer tires. (My tester featured winter tires, given I drove it in Michigan in December.) I can’t argue with the way it looks; the S treatment turns the attractive-yet-anonymous Audi Q5 into something with presence. It looks racier than the mainstream model, which I suppose is a big part of why some people want to purchase a sporty crossover SUV in the first place.\n\nNot So Racy Performance\n\nAn upgrade over the standard Q5’s four-cylinder, the engine in the SQ5 is a turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 making 349 horsepower and 369 pounds-feet of torque — significantly better than the Q5’s 261 hp and 273 pounds-feet of torque. The resulting acceleration is as brisk as you might expect: Audi says the SQ5 delivers a 0-to-60-mph time of 4.7 seconds, and I’ve got no reason to doubt that number, as the SUV feels quick. Once the turbo is spooled up — which happens quickly and with no perceptible lag — the SQ5 proves to have plenty of grunt. It’s not quite as hairy-chested as higher-performance competitors, like the Mercedes-AMG GLC63 and its biturbo V-8, but it almost matches the output from the lesser GLC43’s twin-turbo V-6.\n\nWhat lets the SQ5 down is its eight-speed Tiptronic transmission, which feels poorly tuned to the engine; it’s always hunting for the right gear and never quite seems to find it. Throttle response is also hampered as the powertrain decides what to do about the request your right foot is making — it always feels half a tick behind your motions, even when using its sportiest settings. The SQ5 responds well enough if driven tepidly, but ask it to do anything remotely sporty and it’ll ask you to rethink your request. Quick transitions and sudden calls for acceleration are met with a half-second of confusion from the powertrain, putting a serious damper on the SQ5’s sporting pretensions. \n\nThe SQ5’s ride and handling and its steering feel don’t invite aggressive driving, either. Steering feel is highly boosted and fairly numb — normally acceptable in a crossover SUV, but at odds with one purporting to be a sporty model. Its ride and handling balance, however, is good thanks to a standard adaptive suspension and optional air springs. They work together to deliver a compliant, comfortable ride despite the SQ5’s low-profile tires and 21-inch rims. \n\nIt’s softer than you’d expect from a sporty SUV, but given the throttle response and transmission behavior don’t make for an enticing sports-driving experience, dialing back your aggressive tactics and just enjoying the luxurious ride is a better idea anyway. The brakes are strong and progressive, hauling you down from speed with ease, but they’re surprisingly noisy at low speeds, emitting a gronk noise more often than I’ve experienced in other new vehicles lately.\n\nThe only saving grace is that the SQ5’s main competitor, the Mercedes-Benz GLC300/AMG GLC43, feels almost exactly the same to drive. It’s also plagued by infuriatingly hesitant powertrain behavior, fairly numb steering and a softer ride than expected. Whether this is some odd quirk of expensive German luxury crossovers at large or something endemic to their programming, we can’t say. But it’s behavior we haven’t noted in vehicles like the Alfa Romeo Stelvio, which is quick, nimble and an absolute riot to drive in its top Quadrifoglio performance trim level. \n\nEnjoy the Buttons While You Can\n\nThe SQ5 shines a little brighter on the inside, where a cabin built on Audi’s reputation for excellent quality materials, precision assembly and state-of-the-art technology makes it easier to forgive the dynamic fumbles. Unlike a lot of new Audi and Volkswagen products (VW is Audi’s parent company), the SQ5’s isn’t a new-style “glass cockpit” where you have to control everything with a touchscreen. That day is almost certainly coming for the Q5 and SQ5, but until then we’ll enjoy one of the last Audi cabins to still have excellent buttons and switches. Everything works and articulates with a precision you won’t find in a vehicle equipped with nothing but touchscreens, and to my mind it elevates the luxury feel of the SQ5 to match its price. \n\nThere’s also considerable comfort to be found in the SQ5. The front sport seats are spacious but not overly bolstered, so you’ll actually want to spend time in them. There’s plenty of leg- and headroom up front, but the backseat is a little tight in the legroom department. The second row does slide fore and aft in order to maximize cargo room or passenger legroom, but in order to drop the rear seatbacks you have to slide the front seats forward a bit and keep them there the whole time the second row is down. It’s a less than optimal arrangement if you’re a taller driver who needs to haul something, but the cargo area is plentiful even with the seats up, so this should be a minor inconvenience. \n\nThere are some updates to the SQ5’s gauges and multimedia system, including rearrangement of the optional Virtual Cockpit digital gauge cluster. The standard viewing mode for the SQ5 is now what’s known as Sport mode in the Q5, while a new, exclusive S Performance mode brings the speedometer and tachometer front and center and allows for customization of the surrounding gauge readouts. It also allows for shifting views between the gauges and an onboard navigation map — something Audi was among the first to do and still does extremely well. \n\nWhile the new gauge layouts’ available customization is welcome, the gauges themselves are not overwhelming in terms of the data dump they provide to drivers. The central multimedia screen does, however, now feature wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, in case you’d rather not use Audi’s native systems, and one thing you’re sure to enjoy using is the optional 19-speaker Bang & Olufsen premium audio system, which sounds just as good as you’d expect it to. \n\nCompetitively Matched\n\nThe starting price for a new 2021 Audi SQ5 is $53,995 (including destination fee). It’s a hefty bump over the $44,395 starting price of a base ’21 Audi Q5, but not unreasonable given its rather thorough list of changes. Like most German luxury cars, however, a lot of desirable features will cost you extra — which is why my test vehicle had more than $17,000 in options, making for a grand total cost of $71,790. Along with the $1,000 Black Optic Package described above and another $1,000 for a full Nappa leather interior, these packages added significantly to the bottom line but also made for a significantly nicer vehicle: \n\nPrestige Package ($9,600)  \n\nBang & Olufsen audio system\nLED matrix headlights and organic light-emitting diode taillights\nPanoramic moonroof\nAdaptive cruise control\nLED interior lighting\n360-degree camera system\nVirtual Cockpit gauges\n\nSport Package ($3,000)\n\nElectronic sport suspension\nSport rear differential\nRed brake calipers\n\n \n\nAs for competitors, there are more than a few manufacturers in this price range aiming to sell sporty crossover SUVs to the well heeled. Most are slightly more expensive and more powerful than the SQ5, but when you start adding in all the options, the bottom line begins to even out. The BMW X3 M40i is the best Bimmer to match up against the SQ5, with a 382-hp six-cylinder engine and $57,595 starting price. The Mercedes-AMG GLC43 is also a good match, with a $60,950 base price and a 385-hp V-6 engine. There isn’t a version of the Alfa Romeo Stelvio well-suited to match this mildly hotted version of the Q5; your choices there are a four-cylinder Stelvio Ti (cheaper and less powerful than the SQ5) or an ultra-hot Stelvio Quadrifoglio (far more expensive and powerful than the SQ5). But Jaguar’s mid-level F-Pace P340 S stacks up well, featuring an inline-six that pumps out 335 hp at a starting price of $60,545. \n\nAside from a slightly tight backseat — not uncommon in this class — the Audi SQ5 makes up for its confused and underwhelming sportiness with a plush, sophisticated interior that looks and feels great. It easily outclasses the Alfa Stelvio in both material quality and technological sophistication, and it feels to be on the same level of luxuriousness and sophistication as the Mercedes-Benz GLC or BMW X3. People shopping for a sports sedan aren’t likely to consider the SQ5, but those shopping for a compact luxury crossover might easily make the jump from the normal, everyday Q5 to one that’s just a little more amped up, a little more powerful, a little more aggressive looking and a little more expensive. \n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Are the Audi Q5 and SQ5 Good SUVs?\n\nUpdates to both versions of Audi’s bestselling Q5 family keep them technologically up to date and allow them to maintain a level of comfort, style and performance that luxury compact SUV buyers are looking for.\n\nHow Do the Audi Q5 and SQ5 Compare With Other Compact Luxury SUVs?\n\nThe Q5 and SQ5 have class-leading screen technology, and the SQ5 is the most fun to drive of the mid-level sporty luxury compact SUVs currently on sale, but the Q5 and SQ5 are still relatively anonymous-looking compared to the polarizing BMW X3 and stylish Genesis GV70.\n\nFor 2025, Audi is selling two versions of its bestselling Q5 compact SUV: the previous generation and an all-new version with updated styling, new interior technology and enhanced powertrains. The all-new Q5 family gets more horsepower and torque than its predecessors, as well as revised steering to go along with more expressive exterior styling and vastly improved interior technology.\n\nRelated: New 2025 Audi Q5 and Q5 Sportback: Daring New Look for the Brand’s Bestseller\n\nTo find out if this new generation is an improvement, I headed to Colorado to drive both the 2025 Q5 and SQ5 (per Cars.com’s ethics policy, we pay for our travel and lodging costs when attending such manufacturer-sponsored events). The versions I drove were fully loaded Prestige variants; the Q5 carried an as-tested price tag of $63,290, while the SQ5 was $74,740 (all prices include a $1,295 destination fee).\n\nRelated Video:\n\nWhat’s New With the 2025 Audi Q5 and SQ5?\n\nThe updates begin outside with more expressive and dynamic exterior styling. It makes both the Q5 and SQ5 look somewhat less anonymous than previous generations, but I don’t think they have nearly as much pizazz as the also recently refreshed 2026 Genesis GV70. Audi has also updated the exterior lighting for the Q5 family, and with the top-of-the-line LED headlights and organic light-emitting diode taillights, owners can choose from eight different patterns for the daytime running lights and rear taillamps — adjustable from either the central touchscreen or Audi’s smartphone app — for increased personalization. Is that cool or interesting? Possibly to you, but not to me.\n\nInside, the most noteworthy updates are the new Audi Stage infotainment suite and some updated driver controls. Audi Stage is made up of the familiar Virtual Cockpit, featuring an 11.9-inch digital instrument panel and a new 14.5-inch center touchscreen. The SUV’s touch-sensitive climate controls are in a fixed position in the lower portion of the touchscreen rather than physical controls like the previous Q5 or in an annoying secondary touchscreen like the larger Q7. The steering-wheel and driver’s door-panel controls, however, take a step backward, as they’re now touch-sensitive panels sectioned off into different functions.\n\nWhat Is the New Interior of the Q5 and SQ5 Like?\n\nInside is where the real show happens because the new Audi Stage technology suite lives up to its name and takes center stage. It’s a marked improvement over Audi’s previous infotainment technology; more responsive, more intuitive and with thoroughly modern graphics. The native navigation system works well, and wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are standard if you prefer to use a smartphone navigation app. While physical climate controls are typically preferable to touchscreen-based ones, the Q5’s at least don’t obscure other portions of the screen during interactions.\n\nNot part of the Audi Stage (and a bit confusing to me) is the available 10.9-inch passenger screen that’s included on the Prestige trim. It can control navigation and audio and even show YouTube videos, but it feels redundant in an era of smartphones. Surely, if you can use this display and not get motion sickness, you can probably do the same with a smartphone or tablet and have access to all of your preferred apps and content. Additionally, the passenger screen uses something Audi calls “active shuttering,” which only obscures it from the driver’s view in certain situations. I’d prefer it to remain invisible to the driver 100% of the time, as I found it distracting when it was visible while I was driving.\n\nMaterials quality is excellent; the Q5 has a more relaxed and luxurious vibe, highlighted by wood trim, while the SQ5 swaps the wood for carbon fiber and adds simulated-suede accents. Backseat space is adequate for the class; at 6-foot-1, I have enough space behind the driver’s seat set to my preferred position to sit somewhat comfortably, but with no extra room to stretch out. The backseat slides and reclines for potentially more comfort. Really, the only significant flaws in the interior are the touch-sensitive controls on the steering wheel and driver’s door — they’re clumsy to use, and the steering-wheel controls especially are prone to unintentional inputs during spirited driving. As Audi’s parent, Volkswagen, works to correct this mistake in its vehicles, it’s frustrating to see it appear in the Audi lineup — particularly the bestselling Q5.\n\nHow Does the 2025 Q5 Drive?\n\nPower comes from a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine making 268 horsepower and 295 pounds-feet of torque. That’s 7 hp and 22 pounds-feet more than the previous four-cylinder-powered Q5 — not a lot more, for sure, but more nonetheless. A seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission is standard, as is all-wheel drive. The powertrain is smooth and adequately powerful, with the dual-clutch automatic shifting intelligently enough that it never got in its own way during my drive. The transmission also handled low-speed driving without causing any powertrain shuddering.\n\nComfort, not sportiness, is king in the Q5, and while the steering and suspension have been updated to provide better feedback, the Q5 doesn’t beat up occupants. Even over washboard dirt roads, bumps are impressively isolated from both the seats and the steering wheel. The Q5 I tested included Off-Road and Off-Road Plus modes along with Comfort, Balanced and Dynamic settings, but there’s little noticeable difference between them. Dynamic firms up the steering and the available air suspension a smidge, while Comfort dials up the softness and Balanced allows for an in-between setting. The result remains the same: The Q5 is pleasant to drive.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2025 Audi Q5 Gains New Packages, Starts at $46,695\nTariffs on Mexican, Canadian and Chinese Goods Could Affect These Cars the Most\n7 Audi SUVs Earn IIHS Top Safety Pick Awards\nResearch the 2025 Audi Q5\nResearch the 2025 Audi SQ5\nHow Does the 2025 SQ5 Drive?\n\nIn the SQ5, things are far more raucous. It gets the same transmission and standard AWD, but under the hood is a turbo 3.0-liter V-6 that now makes 362 hp and 406 pounds-feet of torque — 13 hp and 37 pounds-feet more than before. It sounds fantastic, too, with a natural growl and burble that feels rare in today’s world of artificial exhaust augmentation.\n\nWhere the Q5 is well rounded, the SQ5 is much sharper, using the updated steering and its sport-oriented adaptive air suspension to great effect. It corners with minimal body roll and just a hint of understeer, and retains much of the Q5’s comfort when not in its Dynamic mode — and even in Dynamic, the ride is still fairly comfortable. In both SUVs, the seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission usually shifts intelligently and downshifts very aggressively, but it occasionally holds onto gears a bit too long in its Sport setting, which is activated automatically in Dynamic mode. Having just driven the new Genesis GV70 with its twin-turbo V-6 and liking it a great deal, I think I’d lean SQ5 if given the choice between the two; it’s just a bit more fun to drive.\n\nAre the New 2025 Audi Q5 and SQ5 Better Than Before?\n\nAbsolutely. With the exception of some very annoying controls, the updated Q5 family improves on what was already a winning formula, making the new 2025 Q5 and SQ5 the best versions of Audi’s bestseller.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
