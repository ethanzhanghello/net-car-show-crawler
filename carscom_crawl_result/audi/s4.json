      "expert_review": "Audi could become habit forming.\n\nThe company once known for stiff, harsh, unpredictable cars best suited for high-speed driving on the autobahn rather than any U.S. street, road, expressway, toll road or interstate, is making a sweeping comeback in this country.\n\nFirst it was the Audi 100CS (Cartalk, Dec. 29, 1991), then the Audi V-8 Quattro sedan (Cartalk, July 5). And now comes the 100CS again, but this time with automatic transmission rather than the smooth-shifting five-speed manual, as well as the S4 sedan, a vehicle Audi refers to as the “spiritual successor“ to the 200 Quattro.\n\nFor years Audi was designed and built for European roadways. The focus was on speed to keep up with the Mercedes and Jaguars that may try to pass on the way to wine country.\n\nIts new performance machines still are fast, but now they are comfortable, too. It`s one thing to build a vehicle that can travel from Hamburg to Munich at 130 miles per hour; it`s quite another to build one to take you from Rolling Meadows to Chicago or Evanston to Milwaukee, trips on which you might get up to 65 m.p.h. before the orange and black signs issue the April-through-October Chicagoland advisory: Road construction ahead.\n\nThe automatic doesn`t seem to rob the 2.8-liter, 172-horsepower 6- cylinder engine in the 100CS of any power. Audi had been known for delivering the power burst after you passed cruising speed, all the better for rocketing down the autobahn. Americans preferred livelier movement off the line, away from the light, down the merger ramp or into/out of the passing lane. With the 100CS, Audi focused on 0 to 60 m.p.h. rather than 60 to 120.\n\nThe 2.8 is rated at 17 miles per gallon city/25 m.p.g. highway with automatic (an $800 option) versus 19/26 with five-speed.\n\nRegardless of transmission, the 100CS sports new sheet metal for 1992, while retaining those four locked rings in the grille and on the deck lid as evidence of its heritage. With the styling change came new dimensions, with wheelbase extended to 105.8 inches from 105.6 inches and overall length nipped to 192.6 inches from 192.7 inches.\n\nThough you`d need a micrometer to measure the changes in physical size, you can feel the difference Audi pulled off by increasing front track-the distance between the two front tires-by two inches and rear track by one inch. That means you can be more aggressive in corners and turns without wiggle or wobble.\n\nA stiffer body, front and rear stabilizer bars, fully independent front suspension, speed-sensitive power steering and all-season steel-belted, 15- inch radial tires also contribute to precise handling, while enlarged power disc brakes with anti-lock contribute to precise stopping. An added plus is the standard driver-side air bag.\n\nA trio of items we enjoyed included the infrared setting on the key fob, so you need only press the button to lock or unlock the doors; an automatic mirror adjustment, so whenever you shift into reverse the right outside mirror tilts down for a better view of the curb, meaning you can avoid scrapping tires against concrete (it tilts up again once you`ve engaged a forward gear); and the power sunroof in which you simply twist a dial in the overhead console and the roof opens/closes to a pre-set space without you having to hold your hand on the knob.\n\nStandard equipment includes climate control, Bose AM-FM stereo, pre- wiring for a phone, tilt and telescoping steering column, power seats, power door locks, child safety rear door locks, power mirrors with electric defoggers, electric remote trunk lid release, illuminated driver and passenger visor mirrors, tinted glass, power windows with driver`s express down, rear- window defogger and cruise control.\n\nA cold weather package that includes heated front seats, heated windshield washer nozzles and door locks and headlight washers is standard with the CS.\n\nBase price of the 100CS is $34,400.\n\nThe full-time all-wheel-drive S4 sedan is a somewhat different breed, as you`d expect from a “spiritual successor.“\n\nBuilt on basically the same platform as the 100CS, there`s a little less coddling or cuddling from the S4. The 2.2-liter, 227-h.p., 20-valve turbocharged 5-cylinder engine is meant for performance, though the turbo kicks in before you notice being nudged back into the bucket seat off the line.\n\nThe 2.2 claims a 0-to-60-m.p.h. time of 6.6 seconds and a top speed of 130 m.p.h. (European versions claim a top speed of 150 m.p.h.), yet an 18 m.p.g. city/23 m.p.g. highway mileage rating.\n\nThe S4 comes only with a five-speed manual. Whereas European five-speeds often are a bit stiff and balky, the S4`s is exceptionally smooth. It`s an attempt to win anyone who might be considering a BMW, which along with Audi is one of the few automakers that still caters to those willing to pay roughly $40,000 for a car and shift for themselves.\n\nIt`s not difficult to distinguish the S4 considering the badges on the grille and deck lid and the flared fenders. What you don`t see, but learn to appreciate, is the sports suspension, complemented by 16-inch tires, speed- sensitive rack-and-pinion steering and power anti-lock brakes.\n\nThe major complaint we have with the car is excessive stiffness in the driver`s seat back. For some reason, automakers have a mind-set that anyone interested in performance prefers sitting on concrete.\n\nAnother item we didn`t like were the Nissan Maxima-like black numerals on white background gauges that turn to orange numerals on black background at night. The white looks unfinished. And the placement of the phone in the center armrest was annoying. The armrest/phone holder is so far back you have to fiddle around to reach it. Some motorists we`ve encountered on the road can`t dial a phone and chew gum at the same time. Making those same people hunt for the phone doesn`t help.\n\nStandard equipment includes gauge cluster with tachometer, electronic speedometer, fuel and coolant temperature gauges and oil pressure and oil temperature gauges; analog clock; leather upholstery; driver-side air bag, hands-free cellular phone with voice recognition activation; heated front and rear seats; electronic climate control; expandable ski/storage sack; infrared locking system; tilt and telescopic steering column; power front seats; tilt and slide power sunroof; cruise control; power windows; power locks; dual power mirrors; heated windshield washer nozzles; and Blaupunkt AM/FM cassette with a Bose sound system.\n\nSo you can enjoy your car for a long time, the sheet metal is two-sided galvanized and the body is sealed with polyvinyl chloride; the lower body cavities are filled with hot wax; and lower body panels are covered with stone/chip resistant coating.\n\nBase price is $43,750.",

      "expert_review": "Audi calls the S4 sedan the “spiritual successor” to its former 200  Quattro.\n    Most cars fall short of providing religious experiences-though a couple  times when we’ve slammed our fingers in the doors there was a brief one-way  conversation with    the Lord.\n    Being a spiritual successor is a heck of a reputation to live up to for a  car.\n   Perhaps by “spiritual” Audi refers to the fact that several years ago  people charged that some of its cars seemed to take off on their own as if        ghost-driven.\n    More than likely, Audi means the S4 was designed to don a halo for the  performance, ride and handling the 200 Quattro lacked.\n    We’ll buy that. The S4 provides exceptional get-up-and-go with its  2.2-liter, 227-horsepower,       20-valve, 5-cylinder, turbocharged engine, as we  experienced on several occasions when choosing to sprint from the light and  leave other, more mortal cars in our wake. Through five gears the 2.2 is  really a blithe spirit.\n    One objection to most   five-cylinder engines is that the odd order means  they tend to be a bit noisier than a V-6 or V-8. However, the S4’s  five-cylinder was whisper-quiet. The 0-to-60 claim is 6.2 seconds, while top  speed is electronically limited to 130 m.p.h. to ward off  the Walter Mitty in  all of us from taking over.\n    The price you pay for above-average quickness and quiet, however, is an 18  m.p.g. city/23 highway mileage rating.\n    While focusing on power, the S4 doesn’t shortchange safety. Driver- and       passenger-side air bags and four-wheel anti-lock brakes are standard. And  while designed to contribute to performance, the full-time all-wheel drive,  speed-sensitive power steering and even the four-wheel fully independent  suspension serve dual roles   by helping control contact with the road and the  driving environment.\n    All-wheel drive means the S4 grabs the pavement and won’t let go;  speed-sensitive power steering means you get added power assist tomake those  low-speed parking-lot maneuvers  without fumbling or stumbling or needing two  chances to slip between two cars at the mall; while the independent suspension provides just enough cushion to prevent jarring and jostling when you opt to  motor around aggressively.\n    If allowed two     suggestions to make the ride even more pleasant, we’d add a  layer of padding to the bucket seats or soften the foam a tad, and we’d get  rid of the Z-rated, 16-inch performance tires that are standard on the S4.\n    On flat pavement those very wide    tires perform as if coated with glue.  They’re so wide you get an ample patch of rubber in contact with the road.  However, when the pavement is uneven, such as on some stretches of expressway  or interstate that are deeply grooved from constant           heavy-truck traffic, those tires tend to wander left to right and right to left as if trying to seek a  level plane. It’s a most unnerving feeling.\n    Smaller all-season, 15-inch radials are                                                              optional at no extra charge. We’d  favor those treads.\n    The S4 carries a base price of $46,850.\n    My God, $46,850!\n    We finally discovered where the spiritualism comes into play.\n    That’s a hefty price and within chump change of a     Lexus LS400. The Audi is  more lively than the LS400, but the Lexus gets the nod in terms of room,  comfort, styling, and the ability to tour all day without having to change  positions in your chair to relieve the pain.\n    Standard equipment in the   S4 includes alloy wheels; anti-theft alarm  system; 5 m.p.h. bumpers; fog lamps; dual power mirrors with automatic  defogging; automatic climate control; power windows with driver-side touch  down; leather, heated power seats with memory feature; power    tilt/slide glass  sunroof; cruise control; Bose AM/FM stereo with cassette; dual visor vanity  mirrors; cellular phone; outside temperature gauge; heat ducts to rear seats;  tilt and telescoping steering column; and expandable ski/                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         torage sack.\n    Our test car added a compact-disc player at $790, and with a $445 freight   charge the sticker read $48,085.\n    European-car enthusiasts who thumb their noses at U.S. or Japanese luxury  performance cars will be pleased with the    responsiveness of the S4. Get rid of the Z-rated tires and they may even smile. Of course, if you have roughly  $50,000 to spend on a car, why would you have any reason to frown?",

      "expert_review": "Perhaps the best thing about this nearly decadelong U.S. auto boom is the wealth of specialty or niche vehicles that now populate the market.\n\nIt has allowed automakers to create high-performance roadsters and sport-utilities, racing-inspired versions of coupes and sedans and even minivans stuffed with all manner of video games and entertainment systems.\n\nAnd, this week, it has brought us the Audi S4.\n\nThis is a souped-up version of Audi’s entry-level A4 sedan, which is a perfectly good $25,000-to-$30,000 car. In its S4 iteration, which sells for about $40,000, it’s transformed into magic on wheels.\n\nThe good stuff starts with a 2.7-liter V-6 engine equipped with two small turbochargers. It generates up to 250 horsepower and plentiful torque at relatively low RPMs. Coupled with a six-speed manual transmission — a five-speed automatic with Tiptronic is a no-cost option — the S4 races from zero to 60 mph in less than six seconds.\n\nCompare those numbers with those produced by the normal V-6-equipped A4 — 190 horsepower and a 7.2-second zero-to-60 time — and it’s easy to contemplate the performance upgrade on the S4.\n\nNot that the engine was the only upgrade on the German-built sports sedan. The suspension is beefed up with much use of aluminum. The brakes are stronger, too.\n\nThe total package is one that impresses with its unity and sophistication. There’s plenty of speed, obviously, but it’s the balance that makes the S4 most attractive.\n\nOn the outside, the S4 differs subtly from a base A4. Besides the S4 badging, the car has a lower stance and wider air intake ports up front. The big tires (17 inchers) and the clear glass covers over the xenon high-intensity lights also are eye-catchers.\n\nImola yellow and Nogara blue, two only-S4 paint colors, are available, in addition to the usual palette of black, silver, green, blue and two shades of red.\n\nTo the person who loves to drive hard and fast, the S4 will become the ultimate stealth car where the performance potential inside remains neatly hidden under a conservative exterior.\n\nIn the cabin, the car comes with the requisite leather and wood combination. On our test car, however, the S4 came with leather combined with a special suede upholstery called Alcantara and a silver aluminum trim instead of wood for a more distinctive appearance. The rear seat space approximates that in the A4, which means it’s only adequate when it comes to roominess for the legs of a full-size adult.\n\nOur tester also included Audi’s new navigation system, a $1,100 option. Unlike other cars now on the market, this one doesn’t include a dash-mounted monitor. Instead, a driver uses buttons between the front seats to give inputs, and the directions and turn arrows are then displayed in red on the instrument panel. Audi’s reasoning is that its system is safer to use while driving. I found it accurate but manipulating the knobs was a bit of a headache.\n\nLike other Audis these days, the S4 is full of safety equipment, including dual front and side air bags, anti-lock brakes and the venerable Quattro all-wheel-drive system that now comes with a new traction-control component.\n\nAll told, the S4 moves Audi further in the direction of competing directly with BMW and Mercedes-Benz. Up to now, Audi has offered American buyers a nice stepping-stone lineup of sedans and wagons (A4, A6, A8) to compete with BMW’s 3-, 5- and 7-Series and Mercedes’ C-, E-and S-Class cars. Now, just as BMW offers exclusive M-Series vehicles and Mercedes has AMG-built specialty cars, Audi has the S4.\n\nWhat we drove: 2000 Audi S4 2.7T, a sport sedan with a 250-horsepower, twin-turbocharged 2.7-liter V-6 engine, a six-speed manual transmission and full-time all-wheel-drive.\n\nBase price: $37,900 Price as tested (includes options and delivery charge): $41,925\n\n0-60 mph time: 5.9 seconds\n\nTop speed: 143 mph\n\nCurb weight: 3,593 pounds\n\nLength: 176.5 inches\n\nTurning circle (curb to curb): 37.4 feet\n\nStandard features: Automatic transmission with Tiptronic; anti-lock brakes; automatic air conditioning with filter; 17-inch performance tires; sport suspension; tilt, telescopic steering; heatable windshield washer nozzles; Xenon headlights; two front and one rear fog lights; power windows, locks and mirrors; cruise control; power front seats; 60/40 split, folding rear seat; silk Nappa leather upholstery; maplewood trim; trip computer; alarm system; AM/FM stereo with cassette and one-disc in-dash CD player; dual front and side air bags.\n\nOptions on test vehicle: Six-speed manual transmission; convenience package with sunroof, auto-dimming mirrors and HomeLink transmitter; sport interior package; upgraded sound system with 6-disc CD changer; Audi navigation system.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe biggest news for 2002 from Audi, Volkswagens luxury division, is the redesign of its compact, entry-level A4 sedan. Not only is the new A4 bigger inside, but it also comes with a larger V-6 engine choice and can now be equipped with an innovative multitronic continuously variable transmission (CVT). Availability of a CVT is the first use of such a device in a premium model. Up until now, only Honda has offered a CVT, first in its subcompact Civic and more recently in the hybrid-powered Insight. Saturn is making a CVT available in its new VUE sport utility vehicle.\n\nA CVT is also available in the midsize Audi A6, and it promises greater fuel efficiency than a regular automatic transmission. Engineers are said to have incorporated a series of steps in the CVT, rather than have it deliver a totally continuous range; this technology makes operation feel more like that of a regular automatic transmission. At the same time, a Sport mode has been added to the available Tiptronic automatic transmission.\n\nOnly the A4 sedan went on sale in fall 2001. An A4 Avant wagon is expected in spring 2002, and a convertible will likely follow that. General Motors is making its OnStar communication system available in Audi models for 2002. The A4 competes against the BMW 3 Series, Lexus IS 300, Mercedes-Benz C-Class and the new Jaguar X-TYPE.\n\nExterior\nThe redesign of Audis top-selling model adapted some styling themes from its rounded TT sport coupe and midsize A6, but the A4 is more angular at the rear. A new trapezoidal-link independent rear suspension has been installed, along with bigger brakes. According to Audis Marc Trahan, the new base suspension is essentially equal to a sport suspension on prior models.\n\nBody rigidity is said to be 45 percent greater for the A4, which rides a wheelbase thats 2.1 inches longer and has bigger tires than before, on newly designed wheels. Its overall length has grown by 2.7 inches, and the sedan is 1.3 inches wider. Audi claims an additional 1.6 inches of rear-seat space as a result of the wheelbase increase. The Sport Package offers 17-inch cast-alloy wheels. As before, the A4 is available with FrontTrak front-wheel drive or Audis quattro all-wheel-drive system.\n\nInterior\nSeating five occupants, the A4 has a new front armrest with large cupholders, as well as four-way power lumbar support. Seat cushions are larger with more prominent bolsters, and a four-position memory for the drivers seat is optional. Standard equipment includes fully automatic dual-zone air conditioning, an Immobilizer II anti-theft system and a Symphony II radio with an in-dash six-CD changer and 10-speaker sound system. The OnStar system is optional.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA new aluminum 220-horsepower, 3.0-liter V-6 replaces the prior 2.8-liter engine, and Audis turbocharged, 170-hp, 1.8-liter four-cylinder power plant also remains available.\n\nA five-speed-manual gearbox is standard with the turbocharged engine, while the V-6 gets a six-speed manual. The new CVT is available only with models equipped with FrontTrak, but sedans with quattro all-wheel drive can have a five-speed Tiptronic automatic.\n\nSafety\nStandard curtain-type airbags deploy from above the side windows and cover the entire side-window area. They stay inflated for about five seconds to provide head protection in rollovers. Side-impact airbags are also standard, and rear side-impact airbags are available as an option. An Electronic Stabilization Program and Brake Assist are installed for enhanced emergency braking power, and the antilock braking system incorporates electronic brake-force distribution.\n\nDriving Impressions\nAudis reworked A4 has a lot to offer, but the highlight is its available multitronic continuously variable transmission. Operating so subtly that the driver is hardly aware of its presence, multitronic does everything an automatic promises but simply does it without any gear changes. Passing response is excellent, and because CVT operation is so subtle, most drivers should quickly get used to the lack of actual shifting. The CVTs steps that emulate actual gears is a clever idea. This provides a bit of engine braking that can be helpful when youre driving on downgrades, but on level roads, this doesnt add much to the experience  better to simply leave it in Drive and enjoy.\n\nAn A4 with the manual shift is also enjoyable, with its gearshift flicking easily between ratios and carefully mated to clutch action, but the levers position might not please everyone. Although the turbocharged four-cylinder engine responds eagerly, its a little noisier than the V-6. Otherwise, the A4 is just about as quiet as its bigger A6 cousin.\n\nHandling is the A4s strong point, as it joyfully tackles twisting roads and takes all the turns in stride. Ride comfort is satisfying, thanks to a nicely absorbent suspension, but riders can be tossed around a little when the pavement grows harsh.\n\nThough the new A4 is still snug inside, it seems a little roomier than its predecessors, which is a welcome improvement. Seats are outstanding and provide great support and absorbent cushioning.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com;\nFrom the cars.com 2002 Buying Guide;\nPosted on 3/8/02",

      "expert_review": "Subtle cosmetic add-ons don’t reveal all of the 2014 Audi S4’s performance credentials, but one trip around the block in this supercharged sedan is all the convincing most drivers will need.\n  The Audi S4 performance version of the pedestrian A4 has remained relatively unchanged since the current generation’s introduction as a 2010 model, though it got some touch-ups in 2013, including redesigned bumpers, grille, hood, headlamps and LED daytime running lights. Changes for 2014 are minor, but important things like the 333-horsepower, supercharged 3.0-liter V-6, performance-tuned all-wheel drive and an S4-specific sport suspension continue to offer good torque and a well-rounded performance package.\n  The S4 isn’t a racy sports sedan that begs to be driven on the track. It’s more of a casual experience, perfectly appropriate for back-road fun and the occasional blast down the highway, where the immediacy of the supercharged V-6 never disappoints. Tipping our S4 test vehicle’s fun scale into the red was the standard six-speed manual transmission, which is the only way I want to experience the S4. A seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission is optional.\n  Competitors are more along the lines of a BMW 335 with M Sport package than the track-ready M3, or a Lexus IS 350 with F-Sport package instead of the V-8-powered IS-F. Audi’s coupe version of the S4, the S5, has a higher-performance RS5 version that competes on a similar level as the BMW M3 sedan and M4 coupe, but Audi’s sedan has no such variant. Compare the S4 versus its rivals here, and S4 models over the years here.\n  The Audi S4 comes in two trims, the Premium Plus, starting at $48,995 (including destination), while Prestige models start at $54,895 and include adaptive front lighting, navigation, blind spot monitoring and a Bang & Olufsen stereo in addition to the Premium Plus’ standard equipment, which you can see in detail here.\n  Exterior & Styling  The S4’s appearance differs very little from a bare-bones A4. It’s even harder to distinguish on the road now that all upper A4 trim levels include an S Line style package with unique front and rear bumpers, side skirts and door sills that nearly match the S4’s look. The S Line package can even be had on base A4 models.\n  On the S4, an available Black Optic package costs $1,300 and is a must; it increases the car’s menacing factor with a high-gloss black grille and gloss-black window trim, plus stand-out, 19-inch Rotor-design wheels in Titanium finish and body-colored side mirrors that replace the standard imitation aluminum ones. The package is also available on the A4. On the S4 I drove, the Black Optic package really set off the Misano Red exterior. In fact, stepping out to the Cars.com parking garage to pick up the S4 for the first time — not knowing what color and wheels to expect — the S4 elicited an audible “Nice” as I walked over, even if it wasn’t very distinguished from an A4 configuration.\n  How It Drives  The Audi S4 makes everyday driving entertaining. The supercharged V-6 is perfectly matched to the hefty 3,858-pound S4 and is especially enthusiastic with the standard six-speed manual transmission. The manual gearbox works harmoniously with the engine and standard all-wheel drive, with a smooth shifter and clutch pedal offering an accurate feel that’s neither too fluffy nor too firm, and always precise. The whole driving experience is refined and livable, whether you’re poking through traffic or banging gears on an onramp.\n  Audi’s Drive Select is newly standard on the S4 for 2014 and gives individual control of steering, engine, adaptive suspension (when equipped) and automatic transmission (also when equipped) responsiveness, adjusted through the Multi Media Interface controller. There’s also a Drive Select button just above the climate controls; it’s a much-needed addition considering how cumbersome it can be to call up the dedicated Drive Select menu then change settings within the MMI display. In the manual-transmission S4 I drove (which lacked the available Adaptive Dynamic Suspension), Drive Select adjusted just accelerator sensitivity and the amount of electric power steering assist. It was nice to dial in a little heftier steering feel for Audi’s traditionally over-boosted steering.\n  Push the accelerator pedal down, and power is instantaneous in the way you’d expect from a supercharged engine. Even as power builds, the 3.0-liter never falls off at higher engine speeds. Then there’s the fantastic sound — it’s almost exotic, though the engine/exhaust volume could use a few cranks up. Zero to 60 mph happens in 4.9 seconds. The manual transmission and all-wheel drive let you manage power off the line — a sometimes precarious task in powerful all-wheel-drive cars with manual transmissions.\n  A key component of how the S4 puts power to the ground is Audi’s Quattro all-wheel drive, configured for the S4 with a rear bias of 40:60 front/rear, giving the S4 a more rear-wheel-drive-like feel. Paired with the optional $1,100 Sports Differential — which transfers more power to the outside wheel during cornering, for added traction — the S4 is playful. Worth $1,100? Yes, but I’d expect a sports sedan to include something as valuable as the Sports Differential standard. Also, my impressions come with a caveat: My test car was equipped with winter tires, which didn’t have the roadholding ability that the standard summer tires would provide. With the winter tires, I could coax the S4’s rear end into sliding around, though the car’s default move with these tires was understeer.\n  One option not equipped on my S4 was a $1,000 adjustable-firmness Adaptive Dynamic Suspension, which you can probably live without for casual daily driving, as the standard sport-tuned suspension already has an exceptionally well-balanced blend of ride comfort and handling. Another caution, though: Those soft winter tires could have been playing tricks on me; a stiffer sidewall summer tire could easily change the ride quality. You’ll have to see for yourself.\n  Fuel economy for the manual transmission S4 is rated 17/26/20 mpg city/highway/combined, while the dual-clutch automatic is rated a bit better, at 18/28/21 mpg. For a supercharged engine, these numbers are respectable; many vehicles in the segment are turbocharged or naturally aspirated, which typically offers an efficiency advantage. The turbocharged BMW 335i xDrive is rated 20/28/23 mpg with the manual transmission, while the naturally aspirated 2014 Lexus IS 350 V-6 with all-wheel drive is rated 19/26/21 mpg with its automatic transmission.\n  Interior  Audi’s interiors are predictable, in a good way. They deliver a modern blend of quality and style that leans toward the mechanical side of design, and you’ll always find nice materials on the inside. The Audi S4 is no exception, even though its insides haven’t changed much since 2010. New for 2014 is an available layered aluminum/black wood inlay for the center console, door and dashboard trim. This $1,100 trim package is a unique addition that stands out against the carbon fiber or piano-black pieces common across the segment.\n  The S4’s standard sports seats are covered in leather and suede-like Alcantara material; they’re heated and completely comfortable. There’s not much room to spare in the small backseat.\n  Ergonomics & Electronics  I have a love-hate relationship with Audi’s knob-based MMI control system for multimedia and car functions. I always need a few runs to the grocery store to acclimate to Audi’s quadrant-based system, but once I do it’s always easy to use while driving because the controller is within easy reach. In the S4, it’s mostly a positive experience because Audi includes the Drive Select button for a quick change of driving modes. Other Audis don’t have the Drive Select button, even though they should.\n  Cargo & Storage  A smallish 12.4 cubic feet of cargo space is very usable, as it’s unobstructed by intruding wheel wells. Still, the trunk is smaller than the BMW 3 Series sedan’s 13.0 cubic feet and the Lexus IS 350’s 13.8 cubic feet. The Audi’s rear seats fold down for additional cargo room, if needed.\n  Safety  The 2014 Audi S4 received the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s highest, five-star overall crash-test rating, but it has not been tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. A backup camera is optional, which is disappointing given the car’s high entry price. A blind spot warning system, called Side Assist, is available as a $500 stand-alone option or included in the Prestige trim for $54,895. Backseat side-impact airbags are also optional. A backup camera is included when the S4 is equipped with a navigation system, which comes standard on the Prestige and is optional on Premium Plus S4s for $3,050.\n  Value in Its Class  The moderately equipped S4 we tested totaled $56,045. On top of that, there’s still room for more than $10,000 worth of options in the form of the Prestige Package, Driver Assist package, automatic transmission, adaptive suspension, backseat side-impact airbags, Nappa leather upholstery and more. For my tastes, I tested the perfect Audi S4. That is, before options put the price into an area the S4 isn’t equipped to mess with: BMW M3 base price territory.\n\n\n\n     email",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2021 Audi A4?\n\nThe Audi A4 is the German luxury brand’s rival to compact luxury cars like the BMW 3 Series, Mercedes-Benz C-Class and Cadillac CT4. Offered with standard all-wheel drive, the A4 comes with a choice of turbocharged four-cylinder engines and is available as a sedan or Allroad wagon. The performance-oriented S4 sedan gets a 349-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2021 Audi A4?\n\nThe front-wheel-drive A4 has been discontinued, and both turbo four-cylinder engines get a 13-hp power boost, now rated at 201 and 261 hp. Wireless Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity and lane departure warning are now standard. \n\nWhat Features in the 2021 Audi A4 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nLED headlights with high-beam assist\n10.1-inch touchscreen\nLeather seats\nHeated front seats\nPower moonroof\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nKeyless access\nAudi Virtual Cockpit with 12.3-inch digital instrument panel\nAdaptive cruise control\n360-degree camera system\nHead-up display\nNavigation\nBang & Olufsen premium stereo\nBlind spot warning\nShould I Buy the 2021 Audi A4?\n\nThe Audi A4 needs to be good to stand out among so many worthy rivals in the compact luxury car arena. While its turbocharged four-cylinder engines don’t have eye-popping power output, they’re remarkably smooth and deliver a great blend of performance and fuel efficiency. A 2020 makeover brought improvements to an already excellent cabin, including the welcome addition of a central touchscreen for the multimedia system. Rear-seat accommodations are fine for a pair of adults, but squeezing three people back there could be tough.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Audi A4?\n\nAvailable as a four-door sedan or SUV-flavored Allroad wagon, the five-seat Audi A4 offers a generous range of standard features, a roomy cabin and a punchy turbocharged four-cylinder engine. All-wheel drive is standard on every A4, including the Allroad wagon and the performance-oriented S4 sedan. The A4 sedan’s standard turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder delivers 201 horsepower and comes paired with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. A 261-hp version of this engine is available in the sedan and standard in the Allroad, but both versions use a 12-volt mild-hybrid system to boost fuel economy. Want a little more get up and go? The spicier S4 sedan is motivated by a 349-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 that’s paired with an eight-speed automatic. The A4’s rivals include the BMW 3 Series, Genesis G70, Lexus IS and Mercedes-Benz C-Class.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Audi A4?\n\nThe A4, A4 Allroad and S4 all see minor shuffling of standard and optional equipment for 2025. Also, Audi is phasing out the A4 sedan’s standard engine, leaving only the 261-hp version. The entire A4 lineup is slated to be discontinued after the 2025 model year, replaced by redesigned-for-2025 A5 and S5 liftback sedans.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Audi A4 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nQuattro AWD\nLED headlights with high-beam assist\n10.1-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nLeather upholstery\nHeated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nAdaptive cruise control\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure warning\nLane departure steering assist\nParking assist \n\nAvailable features include:\n\nAudi Virtual Cockpit with 12.3-inch digital instrument panel\n360-degree camera system\nHead-up display\nNavigation\nBang & Olufsen stereo\nBlind spot warning\nShould I Buy the 2025 Audi A4?\n\nThis generation of the A4 has a design that dates back to 2017, and while it isn’t the freshest contender in the luxury compact-car field, it’s still a well-rounded choice. Having AWD standard across the A4/Allroad/S4 lineup is a huge plus for car shoppers in areas where roads can turn slick with rain, snow or sleet. Both of the turbocharged four-cylinder engines deliver peppy acceleration, and they return impressive fuel economy, too. The agile Allroad wagon is a savvy alternative to bulkier and thirstier SUVs, while the S4 is a suave and sophisticated means of getting where you’re going quickly. A4 and S4 sedan shoppers might be better served by the redesigned A5 and S5, but if you fancy an A4 Allroad wagon, you’d best act quick; it’s being dropped after the 2025 model year with no direct replacement.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Audi A4?\n\nAvailable as a four-door sedan or SUV-flavored Allroad wagon, the five-seat Audi A4 offers a generous range of standard features, a roomy cabin and a punchy turbocharged four-cylinder engine. All-wheel drive is standard on every A4, including the Allroad wagon and the performance-oriented S4 sedan. The standard turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder delivers 201 horsepower and comes paired with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. A 261-hp version of this engine is also available, and each utilizes a 12-volt mild-hybrid system to boost fuel economy. Want a little more get-up-and-go? The spicier S4 sedan is motivated by a 349-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 that’s paired with an eight-speed automatic. The A4’s rivals include the Genesis G70, Lexus IS, Mercedes-Benz C-Class and BMW 3 Series.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Audi A4?\n\nAll A4 trims get a host of new standard features, including adaptive cruise control, lane departure steering assist, parking assist and a heated steering wheel with hands-on detection. All trims except the base A4 40 now include remote start through the myAudi app. A Navigation Package that’s optional on the Premium Plus trim and standard on Prestige trims gets added functionality, including traffic sign recognition that activates predictive adaptive cruise control. Navigation-equipped models now come with a six-month trial subscription to Audi Connect Plus, making music, video, gaming, navigation and other apps accessible through the center screen. \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Audi A4 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nQuattro AWD\nLED headlights with high-beam assist\n10.1-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nLeather upholstery\nHeated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nAdaptive cruise control\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure warning\nLane departure steering assist\nParking assist \n\nAvailable features include:\n\nAudi Virtual Cockpit with 12.3-inch digital instrument panel\n360-degree camera system\nHead-up display\nNavigation\nBang & Olufsen stereo\nBlind spot warning\nShould I Buy the 2024 Audi A4?\n\nThe A4 isn’t the fastest or flashiest compact luxury sedan, but it’s definitely one of the most well rounded choices in a highly competitive field. Having AWD standard across the A4/Allroad/S4 lineup is a huge plus for car shoppers in areas where roads can turn slick with rain, snow or sleet. Both of the available turbocharged four-cylinder engines deliver peppy acceleration and return impressive fuel economy, too. The agile Allroad wagon is a savvy alternative to bulkier and thirstier SUVs, while the S4 is a suave and sophisticated means of getting where you’re going very quickly. The caveat with the S4 is a starting price that’s almost $13,000 more than a base A4 sedan.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Audi A4?\n\nThe Audi A4 line includes the compact A4 sedan, which comes with front- or all-wheel drive, the AWD-only S4 performance sedan and the A4 Allroad wagon. The Allroad has higher ground clearance for a quasi-SUV stance. All versions seat five.\n\nFront-drive A4 sedans use a 188-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, while AWD sedans and the Allroad have a 248-hp version. The S4 comes with a 349-hp, turbo 3.0-liter V-6. The A4 has a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission, and the S4 gets an eight-speed automatic. Competitors to both include the BMW 3 Series, Genesis G70, Lexus IS and Mercedes-Benz C-Class.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2019 Audi A4?\n\nReshuffled equipment availability includes wireless smartphone charging on the middle trim levels for the A4 sedan and Allroad wagon, plus navigation on the Allroad. The A4 sedans have new trapezoidal tailpipes, while sportier-looking S Line bumpers — previously optional — are now standard on AWD A4 sedans. The S4 adds a less expensive base trim level that includes a sport suspension, 18-inch wheels with summer tires and sport seats with power-adjustable side bolsters and a massage function.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Audi A4 Are Most Important?\n\nAudi makes all-wheel drive available or standard on all models, and the A4 offers the money-saving option of front-wheel drive. The base Premium trim includes features such as Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, leather seats, a power moonroof, heated front seats and automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Audi A4?\n\nThe A4 faces stiff competition from the BMW 3 Series, Genesis G70, Mercedes-Benz C-Class and others, so it would be wise to check out some alternatives before choosing this one. One alternative that the A4 does have clear advantages over is the Audi A3, a smaller car that’s priced too close to the A4.",

      "expert_review": "In a perfect world, Jennifer Thorp-Overton would rather have a red, two-door convertible. But the world isn’t perfect. She really needs a station wagon.\n\nJennifer, a reader, regularly chauffeurs a big dog. She also transports friends and colleagues. Also, there’s cargo — work materials, groceries and canine accouterments.\n\nShe needs a station wagon to replace her 1986 Honda Accord hatchback, but . . .\n\n“I don’t see myself in a station wagon. I want something relatively sporty, sexy . . .,” something like a “red, two-door convertible.”\n\nAh, Jennifer. You are not alone. You are one of legions of women in full rebellion against automotive wedding rings and mom-mobiles, of which minivans and station wagons are prime examples.\n\nBut that’s not all station wagons. There is, for example, this week’s test-mobile, the 2001 Audi S4 Avant. Work with me, Jennifer. I think you’ll like this.\n\nYou said you want a stick shift. It gives you a sense of control. It also “makes driving a bit more fun,” you said.\n\nI understand. Do you read poetry? E.E. Cummings wrote a beautiful poem on shifting gears in a manual-transmission car, “She being brand new. . . .” You must read it. In the interim, you must experience the pleasure of the S4 Avant’s six-speed manual transmission. Shifting that one is like dancing, jazz. It’s wonderfully smooth, and the clutch is responsive. You’ll smile.\n\nHandling will bring joy, too. The S4 Avant wagon melts into curves, becomes a part of them. Credit the suspension system. Up front, there’s a four-link suspension with a tubular anti-roll bar, twin-tube gas-filled shocks and coil springs. The rear is equipped with a double-wishbone and anti-roll bar. It runs on wide tires and 17-inch-diameter Avus alloy wheels, which also contribute to perfect balance.\n\nI chuckled over your requirement for a “fairly powerful engine.” It reminded me of my time in religious schools, where we habitually veiled passion in the language of modesty.\n\nTruth is, a person who wants power wants power. There’s nothing “fairly” about it.\n\nThe S4 Avant wagon offers power — a 2.7-liter, 30-valve, bi-turbo V-6 that develops 250 horsepower at 5,800 revolutions per minute and 258 pound-feet of torque at engine speeds ranging from 1,850 rpm to 4,500 rpm. That’s a truly elastic torque band.\n\nThe bottom line is that you can scoot from zero to 60 mph in 5.9 seconds, which, I know, is irrelevant to many people. That’s because many of them have never experienced that kind of seductive, addictive oomph.\n\nI know that you’re concerned about appearance, which is why many men and women dumped family sedans, minivans and station wagons in favor of sport-utility vehicles and pickups. Image is important. Everybody loves Middle America, but nobody, psychologic ally, wants to live there. That’s why Hollywood does so well.\n\nWe wear our vehicles the way we wear our clothes, and that includes people who swear that they don’t give a pahooty about appearance. (Those aggressive utilitarians work just as hard at looking shabby as many of us work at looking good.)\n\nAnyway, you’ll look good in the S4 Avant wagon. It’s sedate yet sensuous, largely thanks to its gently muscular front fenders. The interior is a work of leather-bound conservatism. But the two-toned leather is supple — feels rich, looks rich. The dashboard and analog instrument panel — the latter with its red back lights and glow-white indicators — are ergonomically sensible.\n\nAluminum door-sill trim and roof rails and brightwork on the housing of the side-view mirrors add the right amount of sparkle. But, yes, Jennifer, the S4 Avant wagon has four doors, which hold little aesthetic appeal for you. It also has a rear hatch. But it d come in red.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Audi A4?\n\nThe five-seat Audi A4 rolls into a new model year with only minor changes. That’s not a bad thing when you consider the A4’s generous range of standard features, roomy cabin and punchy turbocharged four-cylinder engine. All-wheel drive is standard on every A4, including the Allroad wagon and the performance-oriented S4 sedan. The standard turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder delivers 201 horsepower and comes paired with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. A 261-hp version of this engine is also available, and each utilizes a 12-volt mild-hybrid system to boost fuel economy. Want a little more get up and go? The spicier S4 sedan is motivated by a 349-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 paired with an eight-speed automatic. The A4’s rivals include the Genesis G70, Lexus IS, Mercedes-Benz C-Class and BMW 3 Series.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Audi A4?\n\nIt’s a matter of shuffled features and option packages when it comes to changes to the 2023 A4/S4 sedan and A4 Allroad wagon. The Black Optic Plus Package, available on A4s fitted with the more powerful 261-hp, turbo four-cylinder, now includes black exhaust tips and a small rear spoiler. Also, adaptive cruise control is now included in the optional Convenience Package. The S4 now comes standard with 19-inch wheels and summer tires; all-season tires are optional.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Audi A4 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nAll-wheel drive\nLED headlights with high-beam assist\n1-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nLeather upholstery\nHeated front seats\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure warning\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nAudi Virtual Cockpit with 12.3-inch digital instrument panel\nHeated steering wheel\nAdaptive cruise control\n360-degree camera system\nHead-up display\nNavigation\nBang & Olufsen stereo\nBlind spot warning\nShould I Buy the 2023 Audi A4?\n\nThe A4 isn’t the fastest or flashiest compact luxury sedan, but it’s definitely one of the most well-rounded choices in a highly competitive field. Having AWD standard across the A4/Allroad/S4 lineup is a huge plus for car shoppers living in areas where roads can turn slick with rain, snow, or sleet. Both available turbocharged four-cylinder engines deliver peppy acceleration and return impressive fuel economy, too. The agile Allroad wagon is a savvy alternative to bulkier and thirstier SUVs, while the S4 is a suave and sophisticated means of getting where you’re going very quickly. The caveat with the S4 is a starting price that’s roughly $13,000 more than a base A4 sedan.",

      "expert_review": "In a crowded field of sports sedans, the Audi S4 has gotten lost in the shuffle a bit. New entries including the Genesis G70 and redesigned BMW 3 Series have recently stolen much of the thunder, but Audi gave the 2020 S4 a refresh that it hopes will help the performance variant jump back to the front of consumer’s minds. I headed to Palm Springs, Calif., to see how the updates shake out and if the S4 has enough to stand toe-to-toe with the rest of the class. (Per our ethics policy, Cars.com pays its travel and lodging expenses for such automaker events.)\n\nRelated: 2020 Audi A4: Nipped ’N’ Tucked, New Touchscreen, Maybe Mild Hybrid\n\nWhat’s New With the 2020 Audi S4\n\nThe 2020 S4’s changes echo those also found in the 2020 A4 that include new styling (especially up front) and an extensive reworking of the dashboard and multimedia system. It’s still hard to tell these two cars apart, but there are some S4-only flourishes like a quad-tailpipe exhaust system, subtle rear spoiler and aluminum caps on the side mirrors. Anywhere more than 50 feet away, however, and you won’t catch those unless you have a keen eye.\n\nThis makes the S4 a bit of a sleeper car. It looks like an A4 but has a lot more power hiding under the hood (101 or 161 more horsepower depending on which A4) and some serious suspension upgrades.\n\nTuning Makes the Difference\n\nBefore I drove the S4, I tested the larger Q7 three-row SUV that got a 2020 refresh of its own. The two vehicles actually share the same engine and transmission combination: a turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6, eight-speed automatic transmission (traditional torque-converter automatic versus a dual-clutch transmission) and standard all-wheel drive. Initially, this didn’t bode well for the S4 given the Q7’s powertrain put a real damper on the driving experience. A performance car without a performance engine would be even more disappointing.\n\nNot all hope was lost for the S4, however. It gets some important changes including unique tuning and transmission gearing, plus it ditches the 48-volt mild-hybrid system found in the Q7. Those changes end up working for the better in the S4 (as does the car being 1,235 pounds lighter than the Q7 55 TFSI variant).\n\nThe S4’s engine and transmission feel tightened up and it’s much more responsive to throttle inputs. Those tuning changes also give the S4 349 hp and 369 pounds-feet of torque, just like 2019. There’s still a tad more delay than I’d like to find in a performance-oriented sedan wearing an S badge, but it’s at least livable, and the way the car blasts off at around 2,500 rpm helps make up for it. The S4 is estimated by Audi to run from 0-60 mph in 4.4 seconds, but it feels quicker than that to me. \n\nMy vehicle was equipped with the S Sport Package ($2,500), which included an adaptive damping suspension, red brake calipers and a sport rear differential that adds torque-vectoring capability to the all-wheel-drive system. Audi says 75% of S4 buyers will opt for this package, and it’s a good idea if you intend to drive the car for fun. The adaptive damping suspension doesn’t overdo it in Dynamic mode; I left the car in that setting for the majority of the drive and it didn’t feel too busy while maintaining a welcome sense of tautness.\n\nI wish I could say the same for the car’s steering, which lacks both weight and feedback. Audi does offer a Dynamic Steering option that might help in that regard, but my test vehicle didn’t include it. When you start to hustle the S4 through the corners, its capability is readily apparent, but the whole experience feels a bit numb. A lack of steering feel, the muted exhaust note (though it sounds great outside of the car) and a hint of lag from the gas pedal all contribute to that feeling of disconnect. You’ll go fast, but it won’t make your heart race.\n\nInterior Upgrade\n\nThe S4 gets the same interior updates for 2020 as the A4, with the biggest change being a brand-new multimedia system that ditches the old rotary dial controller for a large 10.1-inch touchscreen. Even better, it doesn’t opt for the dual-screen setup found in the Q7 (among others), keeping physical climate controls that are easier to use. The screen looks great and responds quickly enough to inputs. I was also grateful that I could reach the far side of it without leaning out of the comfortable sport seats, though that also meant that I left fingerprints all over it from just a few short hours of use. (The screen is a magnet for prints, so keep a microfiber cloth handy to clean it off regularly.) Wireless Apple CarPlay and wired Android Auto come standard, and a USB-C port has been added up front.\n\nThe biggest problem I have with the system is a common one with the most recent Audi vehicles: a volume knob that prefers to hang out with the passenger. This time it’s also tucked behind the gearshift, so you have to reach over or around it to reach it if you want to adjust the volume. The button does double duty as the tuning/track-skipping controller, which just compounds the issue.\n\nThe car’s dimensions haven’t changed in the refresh, so the backseat is still tight and there’s a significant floor hump that makes it complicated to fit three folks. If you have taller passengers, you’ll have to be smart in arranging the seating to allow everyone to fit. I’m just under 6 feet tall and I had trouble fitting behind myself comfortably, though visibility is actually pretty good thanks to rather large rear windows.\n\n2020 Audi S4 | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\nS4 Price: What’s It Going to Cost Me?\n\nThe S4 starts at $50,895 (prices include destination) and comes in three trim levels, much like the A4: Premium, Premium Plus and Prestige. The starting price is marginally less expensive than 2019. My test vehicle was a mid-grade Premium Plus with some extra additions, including the S Sport, Navigation and Driver Assistance packages. This bumped the price up to $62,840, which isn’t cheap but is comparable to the rest of the field. The 2019 BMW 330i we last tested cost $57,420 and the 2020 BMW M340i we tested cost $69,570, which puts the S4 in the middle of those cars when it comes to both price and performance. \n\nAgainst the M340i, the S4 doesn’t really stand up. The BMW sprinted from 0-60 mph in just 3.89 seconds in our testing, which is a different world than the S4’s claimed 4.4-second time. An RS 4 might have a better shot, but that car is only offered as an S4 Avant wagon in Europe at this time — rats. I’d also put the S4 behind the 3.3T version of the G70 that we owned for a year., The G70 3.3T might not be quite as fast as the S4 in a straight line, but it’s an absolute joy in the bends. Swap the G70’s steering into the S4 and then you’d have something.\n\nThere’s a lot I liked about the S4: The interior changes are an improvement and I think its styling updates look great (especially those aluminum trim pieces around the air inlets). Until you get close to it, it can be hard to distinguish from the standard A4, and that makes it somewhat of a sleeper car. That exhaust note ends up being a solid analogy for how it ultimately feels to drive the S4: From the outside, it will sound like you’re having a blast, but from the driver’s seat, the experience goes by with more of a yawn than a bang.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2022 Audi A4?\n\nThe five-seat Audi A4 is the German luxury brand’s rival to compact luxury cars like the BMW 3 Series, Mercedes-Benz C-Class and Genesis G70. Offered with standard all-wheel drive, the A4 comes with a choice of two turbocharged four-cylinder engines paired with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission and is available as a sedan or Allroad wagon. The performance-oriented S4 sedan gets a 349-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 and an eight-speed automatic.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2022 Audi A4?\n\nA4s with the 261-hp four-cylinder engine now come with a sport suspension that lowers the car. There’s also a new Black Optic Plus Package that includes black bumper accents, a matte-black grille with black badging, black mirror caps, black side sill blades and red-painted brake calipers.\n\nWhat Features in the 2022 Audi A4 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nQuattro all-wheel drive\nLED headlights with high-beam assist\nPower moonroof\n1-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nLeather upholstery\nHeated front seats\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure warning\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nKeyless access\nAudi Virtual Cockpit with 12.3-inch digital instrument panel\nHeated steering wheel\nAdaptive cruise control\n360-degree camera system\nHead-up display\nNavigation\nBang & Olufsen premium stereo\nBlind spot warning\nShould I Buy the 2022 Audi A4?\n\nThe A4 remains a smart choice among a wide range of worthy competitors.  While not as overly sporty or flashy as some rivals, the A4 offers a great blend of performance, refinement and fuel efficiency. Rear-seat accommodations are fine for a pair of adults, but squeezing three people back there could be tough. The S4 is a thrill to drive and has cooly understated looks, but a starting price of more than $50,000 could deter some shoppers.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe S4 is a performance version of the A4. It is offered only as a sedan, while the A4 (covered separately in the Research section) comes as a sedan and an Avant wagon. The S4 competes with the BMW M3, Cadillac CTS-V, Lexus IS-F and Mercedes C63 AMG.\n\nNew for 2011\nChanges are minimal and include adding HD radio to the optional navigation system. The Prestige model gets a standard backup camera and rear parking sensors, and Side Assist is now a stand-alone option.\n\nExterior\nLike earlier S4 models, the styling differs from the A4’s styling, but it isn’t overdone. The casual observer wouldn’t know it’s the performance variant. It has different bumpers and a different front grille, a trunklid with an integrated spoiler, LED taillights, aluminum mirrors and 18-inch wheels with performance tires. The brake calipers carry the S4 logo. Metallic “aluminum-optic” accents appear as front and rear diffuser blades and side mirrors, and the S4 has four tailpipes. Exterior features include:\n\n18-inch wheels on Premium Plus model\n19-inch wheels on Prestige model\nAuto-dimming, heated side mirrors\n\nInterior\nThe S4 is distinguished by sport seats and numerous elements not found in the A4, such as a black headliner, brushed aluminum trim and a choice of carbon fiber, wood or stainless steel. S4 badges adorn the steering wheel, doorsills, gauge cluster and remote transmitter. Interior features include:\n\nKeyless entry and engine start\nBluetooth hands-free phone connectivity\nOptional leather upholstery\nOptional navigation system with backup camera\nOptional Bang & Olufsen premium stereo\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe S4’s engine is a supercharged 3.0-liter V-6 that produces 333 horsepower and 325 pounds-feet of torque. Transmission options are a six-speed manual and seven-speed automated manual, the latter equipped with dual clutches for lightning-fast gear changes. It has an automatic mode and can also be shifted manually using paddles on the steering wheel.\n\nSupercharged 3.0-liter V-6 with 333 hp\nSix-speed manual or seven-speed automatic transmission\nStandard Quattro all-wheel drive with a 40/60 percent front/rear torque distribution\nOptional QuattroSport mechanical rear differential\n\nSafety\nAlong with the required frontal airbags come side curtain airbags that protect front and rear occupants. The front seats have torso airbags, and they can be added to the rear seats as an option. Also standard are:\n\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes\nElectronic stability system with traction control",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nAudi continues to offer its S4 in sedan, wagon (Avant) and convertible (Cabriolet) body styles for 2008. Bluetooth-based cell phone connectivity and Sirius Satellite Radio are now standard, and RS 4-like 18-inch alloy wheels are available. Competitors include the Cadillac CTS-V and Lexus IS-F.\n\nQuattro all-wheel drive is standard on all S4 models. A Torsen torque-sensing center differential helps send power to the wheels with the most traction. The extensive use of aluminum in the suspension results in low unsprung mass.\n\n(Skip to details on the: S4 Avant or S4 Cabriolet)\n\nExterior\nXenon high-intensity-discharge headlights flank the S4’s grille, which features a unique S-model look. Large front air intakes are installed, and the sedan has a trunk-mounted spoiler. Alloy wheels hold 18-inch tires, and the side mirrors have aluminum accents. The S4’s sport suspension includes stiffer shocks and springs, stronger stabilizer bars and a lowered ride height.\n\nInterior\nThe S4 sedan features a 60/40-split folding rear seat and holds five people. The driver faces gray instruments and a leather-wrapped three-spoke steering wheel. Tiptronic shift paddles are installed on models equipped with the automatic transmission. Silk Nappa leather upholstery is used, and the Recaro sport seats have 12-way power adjustment.\n\nAll S4s are prewired for either Sirius or XM Satellite Radio. Options include a navigation system and a Bose premium sound system.\n\nUnder the Hood\nAudi’s 4.2-liter V-8, which is also used in the automaker’s larger models, was modified to fit into the S4’s compact engine compartment. Developing 340 horsepower at 7,000 rpm, the V-8 produces 302 pounds-feet of torque at 3,500 rpm. Audi says the S4 can accelerate from zero to 60 mph in 5.3 seconds when equipped with the six-speed manual gearbox. A specially tuned exhaust system is installed. A six-speed automatic transmission that features a manual-shift provision is available.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes have electronic brake-force distribution. Standard side curtain airbags cover the entire side-window area. Seat-mounted side-impact airbags for front occupants are standard, and rear-seat side-impact airbags are optional. Height-adjustable front seat belts have load limiters, and an electronic stability system is standard.\n\nS4 Avant\nCapable of seating five people, the S4 Avant wagon uses the same powertrain as the S4 sedan. Aluminum roof rails are installed. Avant models have a full-size cargo cover and a protective net. With 27.8 cubic feet of cargo room, the S4 Avant has slightly more than double the sedan’s cargo space. Back to top\n\nS4 Cabriolet\nAn iPod connection kit is available for 2008, and heated front seats are standard. Powertrain details for the S4 Cabriolet are the same as the sedan’s. In models equipped with the automatic transmission, paddle shifters are included for manual gear changes. Audi claims a 0-to-60-mph acceleration time of 5.8 seconds with the manual gearbox.\n\nStructural refinements in the S4 convertible are found in its sills, A-pillars, under the rear seat and in the double bulkhead behind the backseat. Sensors in the active rollover protection system detect an imminent rollover and deploy protective hoops behind the rear seats. The power fabric top contains a heated glass rear window.\n\nThe quick, capable S4 Cabriolet rides and handles as if it’s almost gliding atop the pavement, without a hint of heaviness. Little steering effort is needed, but the open-top S4 responds instantly and confidently once you get past that sensation of lightness. Acceleration with the manual shift falls short of startling, but it comes close — both from a standstill and when passing or merging. Shifts demand some finesse to avoid jerkiness.\n\nThe ride is almost gentle on smooth surfaces, but roughness turns up as the pavement gets harsher. Wind rush with the top down can get nasty, but the S4 convertible feels solid even on undulating pavement. Backseat legroom is rather sparse, and trunk space is modest. Back to top",

      "expert_review": "Verdict: The 2016 Audi S4 is an aging but still highly entertaining sport sedan. It’s not as hard-edged or wild as the top sport sedans in the class, but it’s much easier to live with on a daily basis, with a comfortable and well-built interior, easy-to-use multimedia system and styling that flies under the radar.\n\nVersus the Competition: While not hot enough to take on super-high-performance models such as the BMW M3 or Cadillac ATS-V, the S4 matches up well with premium versions of those models such as the BMW 340i xDrive, Mercedes-Benz C450 AMG and Cadillac ATS 3.6 all-wheel drive.\n\nAudi is set to offer a new and updated 2017 S4 later this year, but the current S4 still is a formidable machine worthy of a last look before it rides off into the automotive sunset. Featuring a strong supercharged V-6 engine, six-speed manual or seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission, sport suspension and Audi’s famed Quattro all-wheel drive, it’s a legitimate sport sedan. Changes from the 2015 to 2016 model are minimal given its impending replacement, limited to minor trim package feature changes (see if you can spot any differences here). Competition in this category is stiff, with just about every major luxury automaker on the planet offering up hotter versions of their basic compact luxury sedans. With a new S4 on the way, though, is the current one worth buying on its own merits?\n\nExterior & Styling\nIf you’re a fan of brand styling continuity, you’ll love the 2016 S4. Heck, you’ll love just about any Audi. The S4 got a minor freshening for 2013, which was itself just a minor freshening from 2010. The look still is clean and attractive, but as we’ve noted before, it’s not all that different from the base A4, especially if you get that A4 with the S-Line trim. It’s a different tack than some other automakers take for their hotted-up sport sedans in that the S4 blends into the rest of the lineup, advertising its more exclusive status only with subtle styling tweaks and a couple of S4 badges on the trunk and grille. Your best way to spot an S model remains the matte-silver mirror caps that you won’t find on lesser Audi models.\n\nHow It Drives\nComparing the S4 with more raucous sport sedans such as the BMW M3 or Cadillac ATS-V is unfair — it’s not nearly as powerful or visceral as either of those. But neither is it as expensive as either of those cars. It’s a performance upgrade to the competent yet unexciting regular A4, something more akin to the BMW 340i or Mercedes-Benz C450 AMG. A supercharged 3.0-liter V-6 making 333 horsepower provides plenty of on-demand thrust that’s just a quick stab of the go-pedal away, with plenty of power across the rev range. A six-speed manual is standard, and it’s a smooth, slick-shifting unit with a light clutch and easy feel, although the throws are a little long. An excellent seven-speed dual-clutch automatic is optional. The S4 may not be the car I’d choose for track-day duty, but it’d be the one I’d pick for a daily commute that needed spicing up.\n\nThe standard Audi Drive Select function adjusts engine response, exhaust noise and power-steering assist at the touch of a button, but not the suspension firmness — you’ll have to cough up a little extra money for the magnetic adjustable shock absorbers, which my car did not feature. The S4’s suspension is tuned to be sportier than the A4’s, but it’s not harsh or difficult to live with in the least. My week with one encompassed highway cruising and downtown Chicago potholes, and never once did I have a complaint about the way the S4 absorbed all of it. The price you pay is in handling and steering response that isn’t as sharp as some competitors, such as the 340i, but the S4’s approach doesn’t tax you over longer hauls. Interestingly, for about the same price as this S4 you can go for a loaded S3 that does include the magnetic dampers and just about every bell and whistle. It’s tighter dimensionally, but feels considerably sharper and more raucous, despite featuring a much smaller engine.\n\nThe S4’s supercharged V-6 gets decent, if not stellar, fuel economy. The car with manual transmission is EPA-rated at 17/26/20 mpg city/highway/combined, and it averaged 19.9 mpg during my week with it, which included a 500-mile jaunt from Ann Arbor, Mich., to Chicago and back, with plenty of urban driving as well. That’s a perfectly acceptable result, given the way in which I kept finding myself driving the S4 — with much alacrity and enthusiasm. Competitors’ ratings all are more efficient than the S4, with the BMW 340i xDrive at 20/29/23 mpg with manual transmission. The automatic-only Mercedes-Benz C450 AMG is rated at 21/29/24 mpg and Cadillac ATS 3.6 all-wheel drive at 19/28/22 mpg.\n\nInterior\nThe cabin has the high quality that we’ve come to expect from Audi, with solid materials all assembled in a way that makes it feel as if much of the cockpit was milled from a single block of plastic and metal. While the designs might finally be looking a little too familiar, nobody can argue with their upscale feel. Audi interiors have looked like this for a decade, but they still feel class-leading in fit, finish and material quality. It might be time for some more adventurous styling, however.\n\nOne can’t argue with the comfort provided by the sport seats in the S4, either. They look aggressively bolstered, but slip into them and you’ll be surprised at how flat they feel. This allows for a wider variety of body shapes to be comfortable in them, but reinforces again the idea that the S4 is not an M3 or ATS-V competitor — if you really try to toss it around hard, nothing holds you in place.\n\nTaller drivers might have an issue with the moonroof as well, which intrudes into headspace even when the seat bottom is adjusted to its lowest position. The backseat is suitable for shorter trips or kids; two adults will find it cramped for legroom and three will be downright uncomfortable in any dimension. Outward visibility is excellent all around; the S4 seemingly has slimmer pillars than many other modern sedans, and has a belt line that’s low.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe S4’s MMI multimedia system still is one of the most intuitive on the market, and it’s actually a shame that newer Audi versions aren’t quite as good as this previous-generation system. The central selector dial is flanked by four additional buttons that correspond to the four corners of the display screen, making feature selection a breeze. Dedicated mechanical buttons also are present for nearly all of the functions controlled by MMI, including one for the Audi Drive Select, a feature that’s gone away in some of the newer Audis, much to our disappointment.\n\nMy test car featured the formidable Bang & Olufsen optional sound system, which comes in the Technology Package along with navigation and a backup camera. The B&O audio is excellent, with both clarity and deep-bass response that makes just about any music sound true and vivid. What’s not so hot is that this model of Audi still uses a proprietary smartphone hookup (with an old Apple 30-pin connector, in my test car’s case) located in the glove box, instead of a simple USB port. This has been changed in recently updated Audis, but remains an annoyance in this one when trying to plug in a smartphone. Despite this inconvenience, the Technology Package still is a worthwhile option to add, considering that the navigation system also provides Google Earth mapping for a realistic position display.\n\nCargo & Storage\nI’m always surprised at how much luggage just about any Audi can hold, and the S4 was no exception. It swallowed three good-sized suitcases in the back without complaint, with more room available if needed thanks to standard folding rear seats. The S4 provides 12.4 cubic feet of cargo room back there, which is comparable to its competitors. The Mercedes-Benz C450 AMG arrives with 12.6 cubic feet, while the BMW 340i bests them with 13.0 cubic feet. Only the Cadillac ATS comes up a little cramped with 10.4 cubic feet of trunk space.\n\nSafety\nThe S4 scored five stars overall in the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s crash tests. The S4’s electronic safety equipment offerings aren’t as extensive as some more recently updated models and, as in most German luxury vehicles, they’re almost all extra-cost options. Most of them come in the $4,000 Technology Package, including the backup camera, blind spot monitor and parking sensors. See all of the standard equipment here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe S4 starts at $50,125 including destination fee, and it includes a significant amount of standard equipment, such as bi-xenon headlights, a power moonroof, a real leather and faux-suede two-tone interior, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, 12-way power sport seats and automatic climate control. Add in striking Misano Red pearl paint for $575, the Technology Package for $2,300 (it comes with a $1,700 credit on its $4,000 list price) and 19-inch wheels for $800, and you come to a not-unreasonable $53,800. That’s not the limit of the S4’s price, however, as it doesn’t include an automatic transmission, the magnetic damper package, automatic distance-keeping cruise control or the rear sports differential. Total bill for a loaded S4 can top $66,400.\n\nThe S4 matches up well with direct competitors. The BMW 340i, for instance, features a similarly powerful 320-hp, twin-turbocharged inline six-cylinder engine, optional all-wheel drive and a starting price with destination just $1,330 less than the S4’s. Just like the S4, that price climbs rapidly when you start adding options such as sport suspension, nicer leather interiors (vinyl still is standard, believe it or not) and safety equipment. Load up the BMW, and you’ll be out the door for about $63,000, a bit less than the S4. The Mercedes-Benz C450 starts a little higher, at $51,725, but comes with a 362-hp V-6 and a standard seven-speed automatic transmission (but not standard leather upholstery, either). The options are a bit crazy, however, with the ability to option one up to nearly $75,000 if you’re not careful. The bargain of the group is the Cadillac ATS 3.6, with a 335-hp, naturally aspirated V-6; all-wheel drive; and a standard eight-speed automatic transmission for the low starting price of $44,335. And unlike the Benz and BMW, the Caddy includes a leather interior and backup camera. Compare all four competitors here.\n\nemail",

It is offered only as an all-wheel-drive sedan and competes with the BMW M3 and Lexus IS-F.\n\nNew for 2013\nThe S4 gets a redesigned front bumper along with a new grille, hood, headlamps and LED daytime running lights. There’s also a restyled rear bumper. On the inside, the Multi Media Interface controls have been restyled and there are new chrome accents. The newly available Audi Connect telematics system uses 3G cellphone technology to enable Google Maps satellite-image overlays, real-time gas prices, weather information, news and Wi-Fi service for up to eight devices.\nExterior\nThe styling differs from the related A4, but it isn’t overdone. The casual observer wouldn’t know it’s the performance variant. The S4 has different bumpers and a different grille, a trunk lid with an integrated spoiler, LED taillights and 18-inch wheels with performance tires. The brake calipers carry the S4 logo, and the car has four tailpipes. Exterior features include:\n\n\n18-inch wheels; 19-inch wheels available\nXenon high-intensity-discharge headlights with LED daytime running lights\nAuto-dimming, heated side mirrors\n\nInterior\nThe S4 is distinguished by contoured sport seats and numerous elements not found in the A4, such as a black headliner, brushed aluminum trim and a choice of carbon fiber, wood or stainless steel.

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in May 2014 about the 2014 Audi S4. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2015, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nSubtle cosmetic add-ons don’t reveal all of the 2014 Audi S4’s performance credentials, but one trip around the block in this supercharged sedan is all the convincing most drivers will need.\n\nThe S4 performance version of the pedestrian A4 has remained relatively unchanged since the current generation’s introduction as a 2010 model, though it got some touch-ups in 2013, including redesigned bumpers, grille, hood, headlamps and LED daytime running lights. Changes for 2014 are minor, but important things like the 333-horsepower, supercharged 3.0-liter V-6, performance-tuned all-wheel drive and an S4-specific sport suspension continue to offer a well-rounded performance package.\n\nThe S4 isn’t a racy sports sedan that begs to be driven on the track. It’s more of a casual experience, perfectly appropriate for back-road fun and the occasional blast down the highway, where the immediacy of the supercharged V-6 never disappoints. Tipping our S4 test vehicle’s fun scale into the red was the standard six-speed manual transmission, which is the only way I want to experience the S4. A seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission is optional.\n\nCompetitors are more along the lines of a BMW 335 with M Sport package than the track-ready M3, or a Lexus IS 350 with F-Sport package instead of the V-8-powered IS-F. Audi’s coupe version of the S4, the S5, has a higher-performance RS5 version that competes on a similar level as the BMW M3 sedan and M4 coupe, but Audi’s sedan has no such variant. Compare the S4 versus its rivals here, and S4 models over the years here.\n\nThe S4 comes in two trims, the Premium Plus, starting at $48,995 (including destination), while Prestige models start at $54,895 and include adaptive front lighting, navigation, blind spot monitoring and a Bang & Olufsen stereo in addition to the Premium Plus’ standard equipment, which you can see in detail here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe S4’s appearance differs very little from a bare-bones A4. It’s even harder to distinguish on the road now that all upper A4 trim levels include an S Line style package with unique front and rear bumpers, side skirts and door sills that nearly match the S4’s look. The S Line package can even be had on base A4 models.\n\nOn the S4, an available Black Optic package costs $1,300 and is a must; it increases the car’s menacing factor with a high-gloss black grille and gloss-black window trim, plus stand-out, 19-inch Rotor-design wheels in Titanium finish and body-colored side mirrors that replace the standard imitation aluminum ones. The package is also available on the A4. On the S4 I drove, the Black Optic package really set off the Misano Red exterior. In fact, stepping out to the Cars.com parking garage to pick up the S4 for the first time — not knowing what color and wheels to expect — the S4 elicited an audible “Nice” as I walked over, even if it wasn’t very distinguished from an A4 configuration.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe S4 makes everyday driving entertaining. The supercharged V-6 is perfectly matched to the hefty 3,858-pound S4 and is especially enthusiastic with the standard six-speed manual transmission. The manual gearbox works harmoniously with the engine and standard all-wheel drive, with a smooth shifter and clutch pedal offering an accurate feel that’s neither too fluffy nor too firm, and always precise. The whole driving experience is refined and livable, whether you’re poking through traffic or banging gears on an onramp.\n\nAudi’s Drive Select is newly standard on the S4 for 2014 and gives individual control of steering, engine, adaptive suspension (when equipped) and automatic transmission (also when equipped) responsiveness, adjusted through the Multi Media Interface controller. There’s also a Drive Select button just above the climate controls; it’s a much-needed addition considering how cumbersome it can be to call up the dedicated Drive Select menu then change settings within the MMI display. In the manual-transmission S4 I drove (which lacked the available Adaptive Dynamic Suspension), Drive Select adjusted just accelerator sensitivity and the amount of electric power steering assist. It was nice to dial in a little heftier steering feel for Audi’s traditionally over-boosted steering.\n\nPush the accelerator pedal down, and power is instantaneous in the way you’d expect from a supercharged engine. Even as power builds, the 3.0-liter never falls off at higher engine speeds. Then there’s the fantastic sound — it’s almost exotic, though the engine/exhaust volume could use a few cranks up. Zero to 60 mph happens in 4.9 seconds. The manual transmission and all-wheel drive let you manage power off the line — a sometimes precarious task in powerful all-wheel-drive cars with manual transmissions.\n\nA key component of how the S4 puts power to the ground is Audi’s Quattro all-wheel drive, configured for the S4 with a rear bias of 40:60 front/rear, giving the S4 a more rear-wheel-drive-like feel. Paired with the optional $1,100 Sports Differential — which transfers more power to the outside wheel during cornering, for added traction — the S4 is playful. Worth $1,100? Yes, but I’d expect a sports sedan to include something as valuable as the Sports Differential standard. Also, my impressions come with a caveat: My test car was equipped with winter tires, which didn’t have the roadholding ability that the standard summer tires would provide. With the winter tires, I could coax the S4’s rear end into sliding around, though the car’s default move with these tires was understeer.\n\nOne option not equipped on my S4 was a $1,000 adjustable-firmness Adaptive Dynamic Suspension, which you can probably live without for casual daily driving, as the standard sport-tuned suspension already has an exceptionally well-balanced blend of ride comfort and handling. Another caution, though: Those soft winter tires could have been playing tricks on me; a stiffer sidewall summer tire could easily change the ride quality. You’ll have to see for yourself.\n\nFuel economy for the manual transmission S4 is rated 17/26/20 mpg city/highway/combined, while the dual-clutch automatic is rated a bit better, at 18/28/21 mpg. For a supercharged engine, these numbers are respectable; many vehicles in the segment are turbocharged or naturally aspirated, which typically offers an efficiency advantage. The turbocharged BMW 335i xDrive is rated 20/28/23 mpg with the manual transmission, while the naturally aspirated 2014 Lexus IS 350 V-6 with all-wheel drive is rated 19/26/21 mpg with its automatic transmission.\n\nInterior\nAudi’s interiors are predictable, in a good way. They deliver a modern blend of quality and style that leans toward the mechanical side of design, and you’ll always find nice materials on the inside. The S4 is no exception, even though its insides haven’t changed much since 2010. New for 2014 is an available layered aluminum/black wood inlay for the center console, door and dashboard trim. This $1,100 trim package is a unique addition that stands out against the carbon fiber or piano-black pieces common across the segment.\n\nThe S4’s standard sports seats are covered in leather and suede-like Alcantara material; they’re heated and completely comfortable. There’s not much room to spare in the small backseat.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nI have a love-hate relationship with Audi’s knob-based MMI control system for multimedia and car functions. I always need a few runs to the grocery store to acclimate to Audi’s quadrant-based system, but once I do it’s always easy to use while driving because the controller is within easy reach. In the S4, it’s mostly a positive experience because Audi includes the Drive Select button for a quick change of driving modes. Other Audis don’t have the Drive Select button, even though they should.\n\nCargo & Storage\nA smallish 12.4 cubic feet of cargo space is very usable, as it’s unobstructed by intruding wheel wells. Still, the trunk is smaller than the BMW 3 Series sedan’s 13.0 cubic feet and the Lexus IS 350’s 13.8 cubic feet. The Audi’s rear seats fold down for additional cargo room, if needed.\n\nSafety\nThe 2014 Audi S4 received the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s highest, five-star overall crash-test rating, but it has not been tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. A backup camera is optional, which is disappointing given the car’s high entry price. A blind spot warning system, called Side Assist, is available as a $500 stand-alone option or included in the Prestige trim for $54,895. Backseat side-impact airbags are also optional. A backup camera is included when the S4 is equipped with a navigation system, which comes standard on the Prestige and is optional on Premium Plus S4s for $3,050.\n\nSee more safety features here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe moderately equipped S4 we tested totaled $56,045. On top of that, there’s still room for more than $10,000 worth of options in the form of the Prestige Package, Driver Assist package, automatic transmission, adaptive suspension, backseat side-impact airbags, Nappa leather upholstery and more. For my tastes, I tested the perfect S4. That is, before options put the price into an area the S4 isn’t equipped to mess with: BMW M3 territory.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Everyone knows how this goes: you’re riding around western Massachusetts in a McLaren F1 – a few easy scoots to 140 miles per hour here and again – and when you finally clamber out in some parking lot to rejoin middle-class America, you come to the same conclusion. Every other car looks awful.\n\nThat goes for the electric blue Audi S4 I tell Herb Chambers to park next to at his latest BMW dealership in Sudbury. That also applies to Herb’s other McLaren, the last of the vaunted half-million-dollar Mercedes SLR roadsters, sitting nearby. His silver F1, which he graciously used to complete my entire life in a half-hour, is 14 years old. The Audi, a few months. “That’s a good car,” he said earlier about the S4, the air rushing through the McLaren’s roof intake to the snarling V-12 behind our backs.\n\nThe S4, with its silver-painted mirrors, decaled brake calipers, and curvy LEDs under the headlamps, was my smoking hot date before the F1 pulled alongside. Now I can’t take it seriously, and I’m trying not to mention its 200 m.p.h. speedometer to Herb. Clearly, Audi never imagined an encounter with (what was) the fastest production car on earth, a car that bolts to 240 in the time the S4 never hits 200. When the F1 is maxed out, the S4 is about to be tugged by an electronic leash at 155. Nice try.\n\nThis isn’t fair game, but things never are when you’re next to a McLaren. It’s like the cast of Twilight crashing a middle school dance as every guy in the cafeteria dances with himself. That’s what happens when there’s a choice.\n\nBut like most celebrity fantasies, the McLaren F1 – now estimated at $4 million – is as close as a magazine cover or bedroom poster, except for the roughly seven Americans like Herb Chambers who can stare at the pictures and then grab the real keys. For modest upper-middle class Americans, there’s the Audi S4, which for $51,000 as-tested buys two more doors, a decent trunk, and unstoppable traction in every turn, in every season.\n\nIn September, I had the chance to pitch an S4 sideways at Pocono Raceway in the pouring rain. It never happened, despite my best newbie efforts tearing out of corners at full throttle. The combination of stability control and all-wheel drive – which sends 60 percent of torque to the rear – keeps the S4 planted without Audi’s typical nose-heavy understeer.\n\nWhile the variable speed steering doesn’t firm up as quickly as it should to bolster handling confidence – it’s very light at low speeds – the accuracy and on-center feel are spot on. The S4 is balanced, safe, and makes you believe you’re Robert Pattinson flying through the forest.\n\nOn public roads, the drive is even more rewarding, thanks to a comfortable ride and a forgiving clutch with an easy engagement point. Compared to the last S4’s huge 4.2 liter V-8, the 3.0 liter supercharged V-6 in the 2010 model makes nearly the same power (333 vs. 340) and 23 pound-feet more torque (325 at 2,900 r.p.m.). Along with the S4’s 100 pound weight loss, the boosted engine also boosts gas mileage to 19/27 with the six-speed manual versus the outgoing model’s deplorable 13/19. It’s a sonorous unit, too, with minimal supercharger whine and a steady load of torque that pulls past 5,000 r.p.m.\n\nOur tester didn’t have Audi’s fancy drivetrain options, such as the 7-speed dual-clutch automatic, an active rear differential that splits torque left and right, or the Drive Select menu to change suspension and power settings. Save yourself the money and the repair costs – you won’t need them.\n\nThe six-speed shifter treats your knuckles to precise and weighty shifts, offering the serious driver full and immediate control only a manual can provide. And the S4 already does double duty as smooth commuter car and all-out highway dominator without the need for extra controls. I’d also skip the optional 19-inch wheels and keep the 18s, which fill the wells without the rougher ride and bending that larger wheels inevitably bring.\n\nWhen you’ve slowed down, the S4’s two-tone leather cockpit – with aggressive, single-piece bucket seats – is a fine place to relax, a noticeable upgrade from humdrum A4s, and makes the McLaren’s interior feel like a twin bed in a Motel 6.\n\nBut it also gives you time to notice Audi’s questionable ergonomics and materials. When the F1 was finished, McLaren engineers had so many precious metals left over they made wrenches from titanium and gold and wrapped them in tidy leather carrying cases. When the S4 was finished, Audi engineers had so many SD card readers from Best Buy they slotted them in the dash where the radios should have gone. The result is a power and volume button to the right of the shifter, seek buttons right below the armrest, and everything else controlled by a knob that operates counter-clockwise with four surrounding buttons.\n\nApparently Audi expects owners to delete their digital photos and load their SD cards with music. This, instead of plugging in a USB snap drive, ripping CDs to an on-board hard drive, or streaming music wirelessly via Bluetooth. You can get most of those features in new Kias, but not the S4. That the SD slots are so prominent on the dash is even more puzzling, until you get to the all-in-one HVAC knobs that adjust temperature, fan speed, fan direction, and seat heaters. Hopefully Audi didn’t waste money on patents – even the Chinese automakers wouldn’t copy this.\n\nBut how quickly – and perhaps unfairly – you forgive Audi for that mess. The S4 is so brilliant at keeping its poise and packing a big punch in nearly every situation, whether it’s slinging through a tight highway onramp or putting quietly in traffic. It is both wildly entertaining and comfortable as a daily driver. The details, like the silver chin spoiler and quad exhaust pipes, give the S4 a boutique feel that’s lacking in the similarly priced BMW 335i, even when that car has an M body kit. Second nature may not prevail for the dashboard, but it permeates all the mechanicals.\n\nAfter waving Herb goodbye, I couldn’t help but be a little disappointed. Gone were the F1’s violent acceleration and mild whiplash, replaced by a half-sized engine and conveniences like power steering. But considering I could buy an S4 for myself and 79 of my closest Facebook friends for the price of one McLaren, I’d be very satisfied if the rest of my life were that disappointing.",

      "expert_review": "Audi S4 Cabriolet is what happens when you cross a sleek European convertible with a muscle car.\n\nThis is a stealthy hot rod, a stoplight runner? with the thunderous roar of a high-performance V-8 contained in a tidy Teutonic package of grace and refinement.\n\nThe marriage may seem incongruous, and the cliche “autobahn burner” comes to mind, but the time-tested formula of big-engine-in-small-car seems to hold up pretty well.\n\nAudi began stuffing the 4.2-liter V-8 into the S4 in 2004, with sedan, wagon and convertible models, but this was my first taste of the performance treatment for the compact A4.\n\nNo doubt, the ragtop version delivers as a fast, maneuverable and luxuriously enjoyable machine. But part of me found the Cabriolet to be somewhat overblown. A V-8-powered sedan or wagon seems more purposeful than what should be a more-relaxed image for a sophisticated convertible.\n\nThere’s also the issue of fuel mileage, with the S4 Cabriolet scoring a resounding $1,700 gas-guzzler tax on top of its already formidable bottom line. Compact cars are not supposed to slurp gas like full-size SUVs.\n\nS4 drives with Audi’s usual tight responsiveness, with a supple suspension that feels firm but never harsh or punishing. There is some cowl shake on rough pavement, but not too bad.\n\nAudi’s signature quattro all-wheel drive improves handling and provides all-weather tractability. But despite the tuned suspension and romping engine power, the Cabriolet comes across as more of a lush cruiser than a sporting machine. Not a bad thing, and S4 will dice through the curves when you ask it to.\n\nAnd it’s certainly fun to flex all that muscle.\n\nPERFORMANCE: The rumble of the 340-horsepower V-8 is a continuous reminder that this little car means business. Acceleration is brisk, though with more than two tons to drag along, maybe not as fast as you might expect. Zero-to-60 time is 5.8 seconds, according to Audi. ?The six-speed manual is butter smooth, and the engine sings sweetly at the upper rpm limits. Very nice, though I wish it didn’t guzzle so much $3-a-gallon gas.\n\nDRIVABILITY: S4 boasts Audi’s typically responsive steering, solid chassis and strong brakes, making the convertible easy and fun to drive. The roofless body gets quivery over rough pavement, especially on corners, with some dashboard shake. ?The suspension is firm but provides a comfortable ride. Quattro all-wheel-drive comes standard, making S4 feel sure-footed and balanced. ?Among the other electronic safety and handling features: stability program, differential lock, antilock four-wheel disc brakes, brake assist, full-side airbags, pre-tensioning seatbelts and active rollover protection, which sends up roll bars if the system senses an impending rollover.\n\nSTYLING: The Cabriolet has a classy, sophisticated appearance, with a good-looking fabric roof that goes down with the push of a button. Most other luxury convertibles have gone over to retractable hardtops. ?The styling of the Audi’s signature deep-grille design is different from the other A4 and S4 models. Spoked alloy wheels and low-profile tires establish the performance flair.\n\nINTERIOR: Another good-looking, nicely- tailored Audi interior, with sporty interior trim tastefully done in leather and metal tones. Front seats are comfortable and supportive, but the back seat is cramped. ?A full cadre of luxury features comes standard. The interface between the navigation video screen, audio system and climate control is better than most, but still pretty fiddly.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: With luxury, performance and top that goes down, S4 Cabriolet offers a lot car for a lot of money, zipping past $60,000 with options.\n\nAudi S4 Cabriolet\n\nBase price: $55,700. Price as tested: $63,445.\n\nOPTIONS * Navigation system, $1,950. * Convenience package with auto-dimming mirrors, Homelink transmitter, seat and mirror memories, adaptive front lighting, $1,050. * Paint upgrade, $475. * Heated front seats, $450. * Carbon-fiber beltline trim, $400. * Gas-guzzler tax, $1,700. * Shipping, $720.\n\nVehicle type: Four-passenger, two-door convertible, all-wheel drive. Engine: 4.2-liter V-8, 340 horsepower at 7,000 rpm, 302 pound-feet torque 3,500 rpm. Transmission: Six-speed manual. Wheelbase: 104.5 inches. Overall length: 180 inches. Curb weight: 4,211 pounds. EPA rating: 14 city, 21 highway.\n\nHIGHS: Slick drivability, nice interior, engine power. LOWS: Guzzles gas, cramped back seat, pricey.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nA high-performance S4 sedan and S4 Avant wagon rejoined the Audi lineup for 2004. Both pack a 4.2-liter V-8 that produces 340 horsepower. A six-speed-manual gearbox or a six-speed-automatic transmission with a manual-shift provision can be installed.\n\nDuring the 2004 model year, Audi launched an S4 Cabriolet convertible. Other than the availability of Bluetooth wireless capability and a sporty new S-line series for regular A4 models, little has changed for 2006.\n\nQuattro all-wheel drive is standard on all S4 models. A Torsen torque-sensing center differential helps send power to the wheels with the most traction. The extensive use of aluminum in the suspension results in low unsprung mass.\n(Skip to details on the: S4 Avant | S4 Cabriolet)\n\nExterior\nXenon high-intensity-discharge headlights flank the S4’s double grille, which features unique S-model execution. Large front air intakes are installed, and the sedan receives a trunk-mounted spoiler. AVUS forged alloy wheels hold 18-inch tires, and the side mirrors have aluminum accents. The S4’s sport suspension includes stiffer shocks and springs, stronger stabilizer bars and a lowered ride height.\n\nInterior\nThe S4 sedan features a 60/40-split, folding rear seat and holds five people. The driver faces gray instruments and a leather-wrapped three-spoke steering wheel. Tiptronic shift paddles are installed on models equipped with the automatic transmission. Silk Nappa leather upholstery is used, and the Recaro sport seats have 12-way power adjustment.\n\nAll S4s are prewired for either Sirius or XM Satellite Radio. Options include a navigation system, heated front seats and a 215-watt Bose premium sound system.\n\nUnder the Hood\nAudi’s 4.2-liter V-8, which is also used in the automaker’s larger models, was modified to fit into the S4’s compact engine compartment. Developing 340 hp at 7,000 rpm, the V-8 produces 302 pounds-feet of torque at 3,500 rpm. Audi claims the S4 can accelerate from zero to 60 mph in 5.3 seconds when equipped with the six-speed-manual gearbox. A specially tuned exhaust system is installed. A six-speed-automatic transmission that features a manual-shift provision is available.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes have front and rear electronic differential locks and electronic brake-force distribution. Standard side curtain-type airbags cover the entire side-window area. Seat-mounted side-impact airbags for front occupants are standard, and rear-seat side-impact airbags are optional. Height-adjustable front seat belts have load limiters. �\n\nS4 Avant\nCapable of seating five people, the S4 Avant wagon uses the same powertrain as the S4 sedan. Aluminum roof rails are installed. Avant models have a dual-loading cargo floor, a full-size cargo cover and a protective net. Back to top�\n\nS4 Cabriolet\nAudi already had an A4 convertible in its lineup but chose to add a high-performance S4 edition as a mid-2004 model. The four-passenger convertible’s grille is different from the sedan’s. In addition, the exhaust pipes are larger, and a rear spoiler isn’t used on the composite trunklid. Powertrain details for the S4 Cabriolet are the same as the sedan’s. In models equipped with the automatic transmission, paddle shifters are included for manual gear changes. Audi claims a 0-to-60-mph acceleration time of 5.8 seconds with the manual gearbox.\n\nStructural refinements in the S4 convertible are found in its sills, A-pillars, under the rear seat and in the double bulkhead behind the backseat. Sensors in the active rollover protection system detect an imminent rollover and deploy protective hoops behind the rear seats. The power fabric top contains a heated glass rear window.\n\nThe quick, capable S4 Cabriolet rides and handles as if it’s almost gliding atop the pavement, without a hint of heaviness. Little steering effort is needed, but the open-top S4 responds instantly and confidently once you get past that sensation of lightness. Acceleration with the manual shift falls short of startling, but it comes close — both from a standstill and when passing or merging. Shifts demand some finesse to avoid jerkiness.\n\nThe ride is almost gentle on smooth surfaces, but roughness turns up as the pavement gets harsher. Wind rush with the top down can get nasty, but the S4 convertible feels solid even on undulating pavement. Backseat legroom is rather sparse, and trunk space is modest. Back to top",

      "expert_review": "Unassuming Audi S4 is a hot rod in disguise\n\nThey are stealth hot rods, European versions of American muscle cars, in milder shells. They go unidentified by the general public because each retains its European elegance and Teutonic stance, a certain cachet of class and subtle flair.\n\nYet, in hot rod form, they possess what the late Globe columnist George Frazier coined “duende,” a bold attitude and consummate class that sets them apart.\n\nIn basic forms, the BMW 3 Series, the Mercedes-Benz C-Class, and the Audi A4 are fine, even sporty automobiles. Yet to engineers with an eye for performance and buyers who want subtle but ferocious power, they are inchoate mechanisms in need of duende.\n\nEnter the performance seekers — for whom money is not a huge obstacle — who would not be caught dead in a modern Corvette, Dodge Viper, or even a wonderfully restored American muscle car classic such as a late ’60s, early ’70s Dodge Charger R/T with a honkin’ 426 Hemi under the hood.\n\nFor them, the hot-rod engineers at German companies offer a redo of the C-Class Mercedes as a C32 AMG at 349 horsepower. At BMW, the 3 Series, the most benign of US-sold Bimmers, is turned into a BMW M3 that cranks out 333 horsepower. And today’s test car, the Audi S4, is a hot rod that results when a 220-horsepower A4 falls into the hands of performance engineers who crank it up to 340 horsepower.\n\nThe way the Audi folks accomplished this is somewhat counterintuitive in these days of reborn Hemis, superchargers, and turbocharging.\n\nTurbos are nice, but I have found them to run thin on the torque line. The last S4, in fact, had twin turbos and delivered 250 horsepower from a 2.7-liter engine.\n\n“We don’t need no stinkin’ turbos,” declared the folks at Audi, who dropped into the small S4 their big engine. The powerplant is a 4.2-liter, V-8 (no turbo nor super-charger), that delivers 340 ponies into a car that a 4-cylinder may well move along just fine.\n\nThat engine is mated to a 6-speed manual transmission (great, short clicks up and down) and, coming to the United States in the spring after the car’s appearance here this fall, a 6-speed Tiptronic, flicked from the steering wheel.\n\nSeat yourself in the heavily bolstered Recaro bucket seats (forgetting for a moment that this is a four-door sedan), notice the industrial gray Kevlar-look appointments, and sense that your mission is one of stealth.\n\nYou are off, quick as you dare, in a thick torque band, no turbo windup to wait for. Again, this is old hot-rod muscle in yuppie skin.\n\nThere is slight understeer (accentuated in my test by wet roads) in deliberate hard cornering. Easily managed. And I could not wiggle the rear, even while trying. Even with traction/stability in place, I sensed that the car would not intrude on my intent until I had neared the edge of control. Other traction/stability sys tems step in way too soon, fudging the fun factor for those with a sweet tooth for twitchy performance.\n\nThe suspension did not feel as stiff as I experienced in the M3 (I can’t comment on the Mercedes since I don’t get to drive them much these days) yet it sat very flat in hard corners and was scalpel-like in highway passing.\n\nThe brakes — 13.4-inch discs up front, 11.8-inch discs in the rear — brought the car to chest-constricting stops.\n\nAnd one advantage this car has in New England (and in performance mode) is that it is all-wheel-drive.\n\nYou could own this car in New England and actually drive it in winter.\n\nAnd it also comes in a wagon version, the Avant. Now there’s a way to bring home the groceries.",

      "expert_review": "Nothing like a family car to get your blood pumping. Nothing like the thrill of five on board and a wagon area for storage and loads of cargo room to really get you excited.\n\nA family car with personality?\n\nThat’s like a pleasure trip to the dentist.\n\nIt’s exactly like the Audi S4 Avant.\n\nSeriously. You might not know what you are missing.\n\nThe S4 Avant is a new way to consider the typical family car.\n\nYes, it is expensive. Audi charges a premium for its S vehicles, and at $46,650, this S4 Avant is no different. We’re in BMW territory here, beyond even the Hemi end of the Dodge Magnum.\n\nBut for the enthusiasts who happen to have a couple of kids, could you really go wrong?\n\nOr consider this: The whole idea of having a family car that can really haul down the road – and haul things – is getting a new look from the industry. Family cars need to be safe. But the safest family cars are usually the ones agile enough to outmaneuver dangerous situations and ride low enough they won’t tip in drastic turning situations.\n\nAfter one week in our 2005 tester, the S4 Avant (you can also order a non-S model) is a driver’s car with an excellent six-speed manual gearbox that will leave you a little breathless.\n\nIn a family car? Yup.\n\nIn many ways the Avant is a family ride that will accommodate a stroller, six bags of groceries, two buckled car seats and two parents.\n\nIt’s more flashy than a minivan, as dynamic as a sports sedan and capable of tight turns in parking lots. And it does not require a ladder to get into.\n\nIt arrives with a softer ride than you might expect. There’s no road harshness or too much bumping around. The interior is classy and attractive. Although the sporty, very clean suede seats in our tester probably wouldn’t last too long with two kids and a slushy day.\n\nThere is metal and birchwood trim and the uplevel items such as 12-way electronic adjustability in the front seats and comfortable rear bench seats.\n\nAudi even included a little ingenuity, such as a security cover that is attached to the second-row backrest that can be flipped forward to allow for more room.\n\nThere’s one noticeable knock: Maximum room. The rear seat legroom is tight for adults and with an infant car seat behind the driver, the front got very cramped, forcing me to move the seat entirely forward.\n\nBut if you want to blaze a trail, if you want to be different and if you want to be a different kind of family-car owner, it might not get better.\n\nYou might not know what you are missing.\n\nAudi S4 Avant\n\nVehicle type: All-wheel-drive, front-engine, four-door, five-passenger wagon\n\nKey competition: Dodge Magnum, Subaru Outback, Volvo V70 R\n\nBase engine: 4.2-liter, 340-horsepower V-8\n\nTransmission: Six-speed manual or four-speed automatic\n\nStandard safety equipment: Four-wheel ABS; electronic brakeforce distribution; brake assist; stability control; dual front air bags; dual side air bags; side curtain air bags\n\nMPG rating: 18 city/24 highway\n\nManufactured: Germany\n\nWarranty: Basic warranty is four years/50,000 miles\n\nBase price: $46,650\n\nPrice as tested (including destination and delivery): $46,650",
