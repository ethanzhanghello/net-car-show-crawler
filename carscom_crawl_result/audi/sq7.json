      "expert_review": "What Is the 2022 Audi Q7?\n\nThe Audi Q7 is the German luxury brand’s largest SUV, with three rows of seats for up to seven people. All-wheel drive and an eight-speed automatic transmission are standard. Engine choices range from a 248-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder to a 500-hp, twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8, which is found in the high-performance SQ7. Competitors include the Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class, BMW X5 and Lincoln Aviator.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2022 Audi Q7?\n\nRear-seat side-impact airbags and power-folding heated side mirrors are now standard. \n\nWhat Features in the 2022 Audi Q7 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nLED headlights with high-beam assist\n19-inch wheels\nKeyless access with push-button start\nPower liftgate\nPanoramic moonroof\nLeather upholstery\nHeated front seats\nAudi Virtual Cockpit with 12.3-inch digital instrument panel\nDual-touchscreen control system\nWireless Apple CarPlay and wired Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nNavigation\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure warning\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nBang & Olufsen stereo\n360-degree camera system\nAdaptive air suspension\nSoft-closing doors\nVentilated front seats\nFour-zone automatic air conditioning\nHeated steering wheel\nAdaptive cruise control \nShould I Buy the 2022 Audi Q7?\n\nThe Audi Q7 is a capable and refined luxury SUV that delivers impressive interior quality with high-tech touches. The third-row seat is nice to have in a pinch, but it’s best left to kids. We also noticed some body roll when cornering, as well as acceleration lag from the available V-6 drivetrain.",

      "expert_review": "If up to 335 horsepower just doesn’t quite seem enough to haul around your kids and in-laws in the updated 2020 Audi Q7 three-row SUV, Audi now is offering a 2020 SQ7 with a 500-hp V-8 to press them back in their seats.\n\nRelated: 2020 Audi Q7: New Screens, New Smile\n\nIt’s an old-school power wagon for the premium brand from Volkswagen — a company that has pinned its future on plugging in and dropping out of the internal-combustion rat race. But there’s no plug on this one — just a slightly less powerful version of the twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 found in the 2020 Audi S8 flagship sedan and 2021 RS Q8. Output through the SQ7’s eight-speed automatic is 500 hp and a healthy 568 pounds-feet of torque. It’s enough to propel the SUV from 0-60 mph in 4.3 seconds, according to Audi.\n\nWhile that power could haul the family and still pull a good-sized boat (up to 7,700 pounds), the split-personality SQ7 SUV also is outfitted with Audi “S” gear befitting a big sports sedan. Audi’s Quattro torque-vectoring all-wheel drive, all-wheel steering and an S-tuned adaptive air suspension are standard. An optional Sport Package adds a torque-splitting rear differential and active body roll control.\n\nThe SQ7 also has a sportier look with more aggressive S front and rear bumpers, its own grille design and four exhaust tips, while an optional Black Optic Package adds a black grille, mirror caps and roof rails along with 21-inch wheels with summer performance tires. The  seven-occupant interior (no captain’s chairs) features contrast-stitched leather S sport seats up front, an S steering wheel and special trim options. The multimedia display is Audi’s new touchscreen system, and also standard is a 12.3-inch configurable instrument cluster. Standard and optional media, audio and safety tech is similar to the civilian Q7.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2021 Audi RS Q8: The School Drop-Off Lane Just Got a Lot Cooler\n2020 Audi Q7 Gets Four-Cylinder After All, Lower Base Price (and Worse MPG)\nNew Audi Q7 Queues Up to Come to America\nWhat We Know About the New Audi Q7\n2020 Audi SQ7 and SQ8: 6 Things Performance SUV Shoppers Will Wanna Know\n\nThe 2020 SQ7 is offered in Premium Plus and Prestige trim levels starting at $85,795 and $91,395, respectively, including a $995 destination charge.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Audi Q7?\n\nThe Audi Q7 is the German luxury brand’s largest SUV. It comes standard with a 261-horsepower, turbocharged four-cylinder engine, all-wheel drive and room for up to seven people in three rows. A mild-hybrid system aids the Q7’s fuel efficiency, but this SUV’s standout feature is the design and quality of its elegant cabin. A 335-hp, turbocharged V-6 is optional, with a 500-hp, twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 in the high-performance SQ7 variant. If you need to haul lots of people and are constantly in a hurry, this could be the luxury SUV for you. The Q7’s rivals include the BMW X7, Genesis GV80, Lincoln Aviator, Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class and Volvo XC90.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Audi Q7?\n\nA new 261-hp, turbocharged mild-hybrid four-cylinder provides a 13-hp boost over the outgoing standard powertrain. Other changes are mostly related to trim and feature shuffling: Adaptive cruise control with lane departure steering assist is now included with the Convenience Package, and LED matrix headlights are optional on the mid-range Premium Plus trim and standard on range-topping Prestige. Two new 22-inch alloy-wheel designs are available.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Audi Q7 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n1-inch infotainment screen\n6-inch climate control screen\nPower liftgate\nPanoramic moonroof\nLeather seating\nHeated front seats\nAudi Virtual Cockpit with 12.3-inch digital instrument panel\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nNavigation\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nBang & Olufsen stereo\n360-degree camera system\nAdaptive air suspension\nSoft-closing doors\nVentilated front seats\nFour-zone climate control\nHeated steering wheel\nAdaptive cruise control\nShould I Buy the 2023 Audi Q7?\n\nThe Audi Q7 is a premium SUV that blends respectable agility with all-season grip thanks to standard Quattro all-wheel drive. The base four-cylinder is reasonably peppy and fuel-efficient, though it lacks the punch some expect in an SUV starting around $60,000. The optional turbo V-6 has both lively acceleration and some noticeable lag when you punch the gas pedal. Impeccable cabin quality is one of the Q7’s main attractions; everything looks and feels top-notch. Having a third row of seats is convenient, even if it’s best suited for kids.",

The Q7’s rivals include the BMW X7, Genesis GV80, Lincoln Aviator, Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class and Volvo XC90.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Audi Q7?\n\nUpdates to the Q7 and SQ7 include standard adaptive cruise control on all trims, as well as remote start through the Audi Connect app. An Executive Package available on upper trims now includes traffic-sign recognition, and Premium trims and higher get standard multicolor ambient LED interior lighting. An S Line sport package is newly available on the Q7 55 Prestige trim, adding an adaptive sport suspension, larger performance wheels and tires, all-wheel steering and cosmetic enhancements. \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Audi Q7 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n10.1-inch infotainment screen\n8.6-inch climate-control screen\nPower liftgate\nPanoramic moonroof\nLeather seating\nHeated front seats\nAudi Virtual Cockpit with 12.3-inch digital instrument panel\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nNavigation\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nAdaptive cruise control\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nBang & Olufsen stereo\n360-degree camera system\nAdaptive air suspension\nSoft-closing doors\nVentilated front seats\nFour-zone climate control\nHeated steering wheel\nShould I Buy the 2024 Audi Q7?\n\nThe Audi Q7 is a premium SUV that blends respectable agility with all-season grip thanks to standard Quattro all-wheel drive. The base four-cylinder is reasonably peppy and fuel-efficient, though it lacks the punch some expect in an SUV starting around $60,000. The optional turbo V-6 has both livelier acceleration and some noticeable lag when you punch the gas pedal. The SQ7 variant delivers V-8 brawn, albeit with the expected fuel-economy penalty. A mild-hybrid system aids the Q7’s fuel efficiency, but this SUV’s standout feature is the design and quality of its elegant cabin. Impeccable cabin quality is one of the Q7’s main attractions; everything inside looks and feels top-notch. Having a third row of seats is convenient, too, even if it’s best suited for kids.",

      "expert_review": "Key Points\nThe 2026 Audi Q7 starts at $63,295 (all prices include $1,295 destination charge).\nA new options package is available on the entry-level Premium trim.\nThere’s more standard equipment on uplevel trims.\n\nAudi refreshed the Q7 for the 2025 model year, subtly tweaking the SUV’s front end and interior. For 2026, there are no mechanical or technological changes, but the brand has reorganized some of the Q7’s equipment.\n\nRelated: 2025 Audi Q7 Review: What’s German for ‘Goldilocks Principle’?\n\nThe new Convenience Plus Package for the entry-level Q7 45 Premium bundles many features that are otherwise unavailable in Q7s fitted with the base engine, and the mid-level Q7 55 Premium Plus gains a bunch of standard goodies, including ventilated front seats and heated outboard rear seats. On the regular Q7, the range-topping Prestige trim now includes rear-wheel steering and gets an optional Sport Plus Package with a retuned adaptive air suspension and numerous cosmetic upgrades inside and out. The Q7 and the SQ7 also now come standard with road-sign recognition.\n\nRelease Date and Pricing\n\nThe 2026 Audi Q7 is on sale now. Full line pricing is as follows:\n\nQ7\n45 Premium: $63,295\n45 Premium Plus: $67,095\n55 Premium: $68,895\n55 Premium Plus: $74,495\n55 Prestige: $78,195\nSQ7\nPremium Plus: $95,095\nPrestige: $101,095\nTrim Levels\n\nWhile Audi applies the same trim-level names to the three available engines, what’s included in each depends on the engine. Available only on the four-cylinder Q7 45, the Premium trim features keyless entry and starting, 19-inch wheels, LED exterior lighting, a panoramic moonroof and a power liftgate. Inside are leather upholstery, heated front seats, a power tilt/telescoping steering column, three-zone automatic climate control, a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, and a touchscreen infotainment system with navigation and wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.\n\nThe Q7 45 Premium Plus rides on 20-inch wheels and features upgraded interior trim and ambient lighting, as well as a 17-speaker Bang & Olufsen audio system. For the more powerful Q7 55, the Premium Plus trim level also adds an air suspension with adaptive dampers, ventilated front seats, heated outboard rear seats, four-zone automatic climate control and rear-window sunshades. The SQ7 Premium Plus also includes a sport-tuned suspension with rear-wheel steering, 21-inch wheels and stainless-steel pedals, but it does not get the ventilated front seats or heated rear seats.\n\nAt the Prestige trim level, the Q7 55 gets rear-wheel steering, organic light-emitting diode taillights, soft-close doors that power themselves closed to prevent slamming, massaging front seats and a head-up display. The SQ7 Prestige includes all of that plus the ventilated front seats, heated rear seats and Audi’s Matrix-design LED headlights.\n\nStandard and Available Safety Features\n\nThe 2026 Q7’s standard safety technologies include forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control and lane-centering steering. A 360-degree camera system is optional on the Premium and standard on the Premium Plus. Automated parking, front cross-traffic alert and night vision are available.\n\nRead More About the Audi Q7:\n\nThese Cars Do Well in Crash Tests for 2025, According to IIHS\nFresh Face, Apps Aplenty: 2025 Audi Q7 Priced from $61,695\nWhich SUVs Can Tow at Least 5,000 Pounds?\nResearch the Audi Q7\nResearch the Audi SQ7\nPowertrain Specs and MPG\n\nThe Q7 is available with four, six or eight cylinders, all three engine options paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission and standard Quattro all-wheel drive. A turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine powers the Q7 45 and makes 261 horsepower and 273 pounds-feet of torque, while the Q7 55 packs a turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 with 335 hp and 369 pounds-feet. The SQ7’s twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 boasts 500 hp and 568 pounds-feet of torque.\n\nThe Q7 45 returns an EPA-estimated 20/26/22 mpg city/highway/combined, while the Q7 55 is rated at 18/23/20 mpg. The downside to the SQ7’s high output is fuel economy of just 14/20/16 mpg. However, Audi says it will accelerate from 0-60 mph in 4 seconds flat, versus a claimed 5.5 for the Q7 55 and 6.7 seconds for the four-cylinder Q7 45. The Q7 45 can tow 4,400 pounds, while the Q7 55 and SQ7 are rated to tug up to 7,700 pounds.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
