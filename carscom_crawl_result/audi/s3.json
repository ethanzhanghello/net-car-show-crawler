      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Audi A3?\n\nThe A3 is Audi’s entry-level car and is available as a five-seat sedan; the previously available convertible version has been discontinued for 2020. The front-wheel-drive A3 comes with a 184-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, while the all-wheel-drive version gets a 228-hp, turbo four-cylinder. Both engines work with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission.\n\nThe A3 is also offered in two performance-tuned variants, the S3 and RS 3. The S3 gets a 288-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder, while the RS 3 is powered by a turbocharged 2.5-liter five-cylinder that makes 394 hp. Competitors include the BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe and Mercedes-Benz A-Class.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Audi A3?\n\nA new Final Edition Package includes black or red leather sport seats with contrast stitching, and a three-spoke flat-bottom steering wheel with shift paddles. All-wheel-drive A3s get S line badges, aluminum door sills and unique 18-inch wheels. A new, less expensive Premium trim level joins the S3 lineup for 2020.\n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Audi A3 Are Most Important?\n\nAll-wheel drive has been a hallmark of Audi’s lineup for decades, and it’s standard or available on all variants of the A3 line. The A3 also offers many features found on larger luxury models, including a panoramic moonroof, leather upholstery, heated front seats, and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity. The S3 and RS 3 have sports-car-challenging performance. Bear in mind, however, that the price of a fully loaded RS 3 can be about double that of a base A3.\n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Audi A3?\n\nIf you want an Audi badge for a minimum amount of money, the A3 is a tempting proposition; it has much of the design and driving experience provided by bigger, more expensive German sedans. A cramped rear seat and some austere cabin trim detracts from the overall posh image, however.",

      "expert_review": "Audi’s 2015 S3 spices up the A3 subcompact sedan with a healthy dose of performance, but I wanted more thrills and fewer frills for its nearly $50,000 as-tested price.\n\nAlong with a smattering of interior and exterior goodies, the S3 is a comprehensive performance upgrade over the A3: A more powerful, 292-horsepower engine, standard quattro all-wheel drive, a specially tuned suspension and larger brakes transform the A3 into the S3. Compare the two here.\n\nFor a dedicated performance shopper, the S3 may be too tame, considering the 2015 Mercedes-Benz CLA45 AMG sedan and BMW M235i coupe are closely priced. Compare the S3 to the CLA45 AMG and M235i here. The S3 I drove stickered for $50,345, well above the car’s $41,995 starting price (all prices include destination).\n\nOur S3 test car arrived in January, so it was equipped with winter tires to handle Chicago’s cold-weather road conditions. That’s not the optimal way to test a performance car, given the sacrifice in dry road grip, but it was the safe choice.\n\nExterior & Styling\nSmall exterior tweaks give the Audi S3 sedan a mature performance look — it’s not boy racerish at all. Audi is already starting with an attractive small sedan in the Audi A3, and the S3 wears its add-ons very well. The icing on this cake is the optional 19-inch wheels, part of a $1,500 19-Inch Performance Package, which combine with the suspension’s lowered ride height to set the stance perfectly. S3-specific exterior hardware includes a unique grille, a rear lip spoiler, signature Audi S “Alu-optive” aluminum-colored side mirrors, a front splitter and a rear diffuser with quad exhaust pipes.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe S3’s 292-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder makes 72 hp and 22 pounds-feet of torque more than the A3 2.0T’s engine — certainly enough difference to feel in the seat of your pants. It’s one of the rare fantastic-sounding four-cylinder engines, with a meaty growl emanating from under the hood. There’s no question it’s an upgrade over the A3, but I couldn’t help wanting more, especially given the 355-hp CLA45 AMG is a bite-sized, grin-inducing rocket ship. It’s hard to beat one of those, ya know? The S3 has strong midrange pull but never fully delivers on the promise of the grunt of power it shows off the line.\n\nUnlike the CLA45 AMG, however, the Audi S3’s engine is extremely refined, with minimal lag — something often found in small displacement, high-horsepower turbocharged engines. The BMW M235i’s 320-hp, turbocharged six-cylinder straddles the line between the two in terms of power while matching the S3’s smooth, minimal-lag nature.\n\nHarnessing the S3’s power is one of the most impressive executions of a dual-clutch transmission in this segment: The six-speed shifts unbelievably fast and smoothly — two attributes that don’t often go hand in hand. Still, I’d love to see a manual transmission option in the S3 because I know Audi can knock a manual transmission experience out of the park (as it does with the S4). Sometimes, a manual transmission can make an otherwise mediocre experience more entertaining.\n\nThe S3 isn’t straight-laced all the time. Dropping the hammer on its race-start launch control feature is especially entertaining, as all that power is released to the S3’s standard all-wheel drive when launched from a stop at 4,000 rpm. Using launch control is the only time this car will surprise you with a burst of acceleration.\n\nThink of the Audi S3 more as a well-rounded package than as a hot rod like the Mercedes. The S3’s optional magnetic ride suspension with adjustable Comfort, Auto and Dynamic shock absorber firmness modes doesn’t thunder over broken pavement like the CLA45 AMG. The ride is decidedly tight in all three modes, though I suspect the differences may be more apparent during spirited handling, which road conditions and our tester’s winter tires made difficult for me to experience. Dynamic mode seems only slightly more aggressive than Comfort.\n\nRegarding winter driving: The 19-inch wheel package normally comes with summer tires but, as mentioned, ours wore winter tires in the factory size, 235/35R19. The $281 per-tire set struggled to assure confidence even in light snow, which surprised me given winter tires and all-wheel drive are usually a killer combination. Part of my struggle came with the S3’s wimpy, over-boosted steering, which offered very little feedback in any driving mode, making it difficult to gauge when the car was starting to slide. The soft winter tire compound could have exaggerated the numb steering characteristic, as well, as we observed when we switched from summer to winter tires on a Subaru BRZ, our former long-term test car.\n\nThe S3 often slid out from under me before I could feel what was going on through the steering wheel, and overall it squirmed uncomfortably on top of lightly packed snow. An Audi S5 coupe we tested with a different brand of winter tires maintained its summer-tire dynamics considerably better.\n\nPerhaps a different wheel and tire package would improve the Audi S3’s winter performance, though any winter wheels would have to clear the S3’s larger 13.4/12.2-inch front/rear brake rotors, a big upgrade from the regular A3’s 12.3/10.7-inch rotors. The brakes are overly sensitive; just a slight touch of the pedal will send anything not attached to the floor flying forward.\n\nInterior\nThe S3 is a bit wimpy compared with similar performance cars, but it boasts better usability as an everyday driver among those same rivals. The S3’s four doors are an advantage over the two-door M235i, and it has a more usable backseat than the CLA45 AMG’s sardine-can-sized rear.\n\nS3-specific appointments include a three-spoke, flat-bottom steering wheel with paddle shifters; pedals with aluminum inserts; and front sport seats bearing the S3 logo — all fairly standard stuff for an Audi S performance package. The front seats are comfortable like the A3’s, with added side bolstering that keeps you snug in your seat.\n\nOtherwise, the S3’s interior is very similar to the regular A3, which you can read Cars.com’s review of here.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe Audi S3 may be the most expensive Audi A3 variant, but it isn’t equipped with many more multimedia features than a base A3. An iPod/iPhone interface is added in addition to the A3’s multimedia system, which includes standard Bluetooth with streaming audio. Our S3 Prestige model featured an upgraded Bang & Olufsen stereo, plus navigation and Audi’s MMI Plus for an additional $5,900.\n\nThe kitted-out multimedia system with a multifunction knob controller and quadrant-based layout isn’t the easiest to jump into — at least not without a few dry runs while parked to get an idea of where the buttons rest. Shortcut switches for navigation, phone, radio and media help you get back to a key function if you get lost in the depths of the system’s customization, which also includes vehicle systems.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe Audi S3’s standard quattro all-wheel drive takes away 2.3 cubic feet of cargo space. A front-wheel-drive A3 has 12.3 cubic feet while the S3 has 10 cubic feet, though both styles use a 60/40-split folding backseat. We could only get one bag of golf clubs in the trunk without folding the backseat.\n\nSafety\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety says the S3 shares its rating with the A3, which earned the agency’s highest accolade of Top Safety Pick+ for scoring the highest rating of good in all tests. A “plus” designation is added to Top Safety Picks that offer advanced front crash prevention, which is an optional feature on the S3. In National Highway Traffic Safety Administration crash tests, the Audi S3 received an overall rating of five out of five stars.\n\nOptional safety features include a backup camera, blind spot monitoring, lane departure warning and “Audi pre sense front,” which pairs with the available adaptive cruise control to offer forward collision warning with autonomous braking. A $1,400 Driver Assistance Package available on base models includes parking assist plus the blind spot monitor, backup camera and lane departure warning; all that is standard on the Prestige Package, which starts at $47,895.\n\nSee all the S3’s safety features listed here.\n\nSee how well child-safety seats fit in the A3’s backseat, here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nAudi’s base Audi A3 is no slouch in the standard equipment department, with leather seats, a panoramic moonroof, dual-zone climate control and more. Those carry over to the S3 — and you won’t find standard leather in the Mercedes CLA45 AMG or BMW M235i. Over the A3, the S3 includes a smart keyless access system with push-button start, a color driver-information system display between the gauges, and Audi’s Drive Select for changing various driving characteristics (like the degree of power steering assistance, throttle progression and transmission behavior) on the fly.\n\nPrepare to open your wallet if you want more. As mentioned earlier, the Prestige trim level adds $5,900 to the base model and includes a backup camera, power-folding mirrors, LED headlights, daytime running lights and much more. Our test car’s $50,000 price tag set off a mental warning light given the car’s small size and moderately powerful driving experience.\n\nThe Audi S3’s $41,995 staring price is a classic case of you get what you pay for, considering the S3 runs a bit short on performance chops compared with the $44,050 BMW M235i and the $49,425 CLA45 AMG. Buyers shopping purely for performance can likely cross the S3 off their list — but that’s not to say the S3 is a bad car. Stick around its base price, and the sport-tuned Audi S3 delivers a good amount of driving fun over the base Audi A3 2.0T, with the same usability and good looks.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in March 2015 about the 2015 Audi S3. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2016, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nAudi’s 2015 S3 spices up the A3 subcompact sedan with a healthy dose of performance, but I wanted more thrills and fewer frills for its nearly $50,000 as-tested price.\n\nAlong with a smattering of interior and exterior goodies, the S3 is a comprehensive performance upgrade over the A3: A more powerful, 292-horsepower engine, standard all-wheel drive, a specially tuned suspension and larger brakes transform the A3 into the S3. Compare the two here.\n\nFor a dedicated performance shopper, the S3 may be too tame, considering the 2015 Mercedes-Benz CLA45 AMG sedan and BMW M235i coupe are closely priced. Compare the S3 to the CLA45 AMG and M235i here. The S3 I drove stickered for $50,345, well above the car’s $41,995 starting price (all prices include destination).\n\nOur S3 test car arrived in January, so it was equipped with winter tires to handle Chicago’s cold-weather road conditions. That’s not the optimal way to test a performance car, given the sacrifice in dry road grip, but it was the safe choice.\n\nExterior & Styling\nSmall exterior tweaks give the S3 a mature performance look — it’s not boy racerish at all. Audi is already starting with an attractive small sedan in the A3, and the S3 wears its add-ons very well. The icing on this cake is the optional 19-inch wheels, part of a $1,500 19-Inch Performance Package, which combine with the suspension’s lowered ride height to set the stance perfectly. S3-specific exterior hardware includes a unique grille, a rear lip spoiler, signature Audi S “Alu-optive” aluminum-colored side mirrors, a front splitter and a rear diffuser with quad exhaust pipes.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe S3’s 292-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder makes 72 hp and 22 pounds-feet of torque more than the A3 2.0T’s engine — certainly enough difference to feel in the seat of your pants. It’s one of the rare fantastic-sounding four-cylinder engines, with a meaty growl emanating from under the hood. There’s no question it’s an upgrade over the A3, but I couldn’t help wanting more, especially given the 355-hp CLA45 AMG is a bite-sized, grin-inducing rocket ship. It’s hard to beat one of those, ya know? The S3 has strong midrange pull but never fully delivers on the promise of the grunt of power it shows off the line.\n\nUnlike the CLA45 AMG, however, the S3’s engine is extremely refined, with minimal lag — something often found in small displacement, high-horsepower turbocharged engines. The BMW M235i’s 320-hp, turbocharged six-cylinder straddles the line between the two in terms of power while matching the S3’s smooth, minimal-lag nature.\n\nHarnessing the S3’s power is one of the most impressive executions of a dual-clutch transmission in this segment: The six-speed shifts unbelievably fast and smoothly — two attributes that don’t often go hand in hand. Still, I’d love to see a manual transmission option in the S3 because I know Audi can knock a manual transmission experience out of the park (as it does with the S4). Sometimes, a manual transmission can make an otherwise mediocre experience more entertaining.\n\nThe S3 isn’t straight-laced all the time. Dropping the hammer on its race-start launch control feature is especially entertaining, as all that power is released to the S3’s standard all-wheel drive when launched from a stop at 4,000 rpm. Using launch control is the only time this car will surprise you with a burst of acceleration.\n\nThink of the S3 more as a well-rounded package than as a hot rod like the Mercedes. The S3’s optional magnetic ride suspension with adjustable Comfort, Auto and Dynamic shock absorber firmness modes doesn’t thunder over broken pavement like the CLA45 AMG. The ride is decidedly tight in all three modes, though I suspect the differences may be more apparent during spirited handling, which road conditions and our tester’s winter tires made difficult for me to experience. Dynamic mode seems only slightly more aggressive than Comfort.\n\nRegarding winter driving: The 19-inch wheel package normally comes with summer tires but, as mentioned, ours wore winter tires in the factory size, 235/35R19. The $281 per-tire set struggled to assure confidence even in light snow, which surprised me given winter tires and all-wheel drive are usually a killer combination. Part of my struggle came with the S3’s wimpy, over-boosted steering, which offered very little feedback in any driving mode, making it difficult to gauge when the car was starting to slide. The soft winter tire compound could have exaggerated the numb steering characteristic, as well, as we observed when we switched from summer to winter tires on a Subaru BRZ, our former long-term test car. Read more about winter tires, here.\n\nThe S3 often slid out from under me before I could feel what was going on through the steering wheel, and overall it squirmed uncomfortably on top of lightly packed snow. An Audi S5 coupe we tested with a different brand of winter tires maintained its summer-tire dynamics considerably better.\n\nPerhaps a different wheel and tire package would improve the S3’s winter performance, though any winter wheels would have to clear the S3’s larger 13.4/12.2-inch front/rear brake rotors, a big upgrade from the regular A3’s 12.3/10.7-inch rotors. The brakes are overly sensitive; just a slight touch of the pedal will send anything not attached to the floor flying forward.\n\nInterior\nThe S3 is a bit wimpy compared with similar performance cars, but it boasts better usability as an everyday driver among those same rivals. The S3’s four doors are an advantage over the two-door M235i, and it has a more usable backseat than the CLA45 AMG’s sardine-can-sized rear.\n\nS3-specific appointments include a three-spoke, flat-bottom steering wheel with paddle shifters; pedals with aluminum inserts; and front sport seats bearing the S3 logo — all fairly standard stuff for an Audi S performance package. The front seats are comfortable like the A3’s, with added side bolstering that keeps you snug in your seat.\n\nOtherwise, the S3’s interior is very similar to the regular A3, which you can read Cars.com’s review of here.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe S3 may be the most expensive A3 variant, but it isn’t equipped with many more multimedia features than a base A3. An iPod/iPhone interface is added in addition to the A3’s multimedia system, which includes standard Bluetooth with streaming audio. Our S3 Prestige model featured an upgraded Bang & Olufsen stereo, plus navigation and Audi’s MMI Plus for an additional $5,900.\n\nThe kitted-out multimedia system with a multifunction knob controller and quadrant-based layout isn’t the easiest to jump into — at least not without a few dry runs while parked to get an idea of where the buttons rest. Shortcut switches for navigation, phone, radio and media help you get back to a key function if you get lost in the depths of the system’s customization, which also includes vehicle systems.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe S3’s standard all-wheel drive takes away 2.3 cubic feet of cargo space. A front-wheel-drive A3 has 12.3 cubic feet while the S3 has 10 cubic feet, though both styles use a 60/40-split folding backseat. We could only get one bag of golf clubs in the trunk without folding the backseat.\n\nSafety\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety says the S3 shares its rating with the A3, which earned the agency’s highest accolade of Top Safety Pick+ for scoring the highest rating of good in all tests. A “plus” designation is added to Top Safety Picks that offer advanced front crash prevention, which is an optional feature on the S3. In National Highway Traffic Safety Administration crash tests, the Audi S3 received an overall rating of five out of five stars.\n\nOptional safety features include a backup camera, blind spot monitoring, lane departure warning and “Audi pre sense front,” which pairs with the available adaptive cruise control to offer forward collision warning with autonomous braking. A $1,400 Driver Assistance Package available on base models includes parking assist plus the blind spot monitor, backup camera and lane departure warning; all that is standard on the Prestige Package, which starts at $47,895.\n\nSee all the S3’s safety features listed here.\n\nSee how well child-safety seats fit in the A3’s backseat, here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nAudi’s base A3 is no slouch in the standard equipment department, with leather seating, a panoramic moonroof, dual-zone climate control and more. Those carry over to the S3 — and you won’t find standard leather in the Mercedes CLA45 AMG or BMW M235i. Over the A3, the S3 includes a smart keyless access system with push-button start, a color driver-information system display between the gauges, and Audi’s Drive Select for changing various driving characteristics (like the degree of power steering assistance, throttle progression and transmission behavior) on the fly.\n\nPrepare to open your wallet if you want more. As mentioned earlier, the Prestige trim level adds $5,900 to the base model and includes a backup camera, power-folding mirrors, LED headlights, daytime running lights and much more. Our test car’s $50,000 price tag set off a mental warning light given the car’s small size and moderately powerful driving experience.\n\nThe S3’s $41,995 staring price is a classic case of you get what you pay for, considering the S3 runs a bit short on performance chops compared with the $44,050 BMW M235i and the $49,425 CLA45 AMG. Buyers shopping purely for performance can likely cross the S3 off their list — but that’s not to say the S3 is a bad car. Stick around its base price, and the S3 delivers a good amount of driving fun over the base A3 2.0T, with the same usability and good looks.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Audi A3?\n\nThe A3 is Audi's entry-level car and is available as a five-seat sedan or four-seat convertible. The sedan also is offered in performance-oriented S3 guise and in high-performance RS3 trim.\n\nFront-drive A3 models use a 184-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine; all-wheel-drive A3s have 228 hp. The S3 sedan has a 288-hp, turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder and AWD. The AWD RS3’s 2.5-liter five-cylinder generates 394 hp. All versions feature a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. Competitors include the BMW 2 Series and Mercedes-Benz CLA-Class.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2019 Audi A3?\n\nThe Premium trim adds standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. A3 Premium Plus and Prestige trims get standard LED headlights, LED taillights and the Audi phone box with wireless charging and signal booster. Park assist, a new feature that maneuvers the car during parallel and perpendicular parking, is standard on A3 and S3 Prestige sedans. The RS3 adds the Audi phone box as standard.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Audi A3 Are Most Important?\n\nAll-wheel drive has been a hallmark of Audi’s lineup for decades, and it's standard or available on all variants of the A3 line. The compact-size A3 offers a boatload of features found on larger luxury models, including a panoramic moonroof (on sedans), leather upholstery, heated front seats and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Moving up to higher trim levels to get navigation, LED headlights, adaptive cruise control and other features can push the price to more than $45,000.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Audi A3?\n\nGood things do come in small packages, and the A3 line offers a high level of convenience and refinement, along with sprightly performance. However, it’s short on backseat room and, with all-wheel drive, cargo room, and the price climbs quickly with higher trim levels and by adding optional features.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Redesigned for 2022, the Audi A3 and S3 sedans offer balanced handling and myriad standard features, but hesitant transmissions and inconsistent quality let them down.\n\nVersus the competition: With consumers overwhelmingly preferring SUVs these days, any small luxury sedan starting around $35,000 better be one hell of a car to justify its existence. The A3 and S3 have their moments, but drawbacks we experienced behind the wheel and elsewhere keep both cars short of the mark.\n\nWith front- or all-wheel drive, the A3 runs from the mid-$30,000s to around $50,000. The S3 packs considerably more performance and standard AWD; it’ll set you back another $11,000 or so at either end of the trim lineup. Around Cars.com’s Chicago headquarters, we drove an A3 with AWD and Audi’s optional sport suspension; we also drove the A3 and S3 back-to-back at a drive event in October in southeast Michigan. See our initial take after that drive, stack up the new A3 and S3 side by side, or compare them with their prior-generation 2020 counterparts (both cars skipped the 2021 model year).\n\nRelated: 2022 Audi A3, S3 Quick Spin: Transmission Travails\n\nAudi has also redesigned the related RS 3, which offers even more performance, but it had not yet debuted as of this writing.\n\nLost in Transmission\n\nWhether it’s the weak initial grunt of the BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe or the modest overall power of the Mercedes-Benz A220, the base powertrains in many entry-luxury sedans have been underwhelming. So it goes for Audi: From a stop, the A3’s turbo four-cylinder (201 horsepower and 221 pounds-feet of torque) delivers swift accelerator response and robust, usable oomph early on. But once you reach cruising speed, that oomph is hard to access.\n\nThe culprit seems to be the A3’s transmission, a dual-clutch seven-speed automatic, which upshifts early and often. When you try to accelerate when already in motion, though, it needs a cigarette break before obliging. By my stopwatch, the A3 consistently needed a full two seconds to downshift into a lower gear and surge ahead during a standard 50 mph kickdown maneuver — despite plenty of engine windup that suggested something was coming. That’s a third longer than most cars I run through that test require and twice as long as the most responsive examples. \n\nTransmission kickdown at lower speeds seemed similarly delayed in the A3, though I didn’t time it. It wasn’t just me, either; multiple Cars.com editors have criticized the A3’s transmission. The sedan’s Dynamic setting — which is the sportiest of several selectable drive modes — holds lower gears longer than the default mode, which lessens the need to kick down as often. But when the drivetrain eventually does settle into a higher gear, requesting a lower one can take just as long.\n\nThe S3 (306 hp and 295 pounds-feet of torque) betters kickdown lag to a more average delay. The car is expectedly quick, especially as rpm builds. Power becomes explosive past 5,000 rpm or so — enough to lend the car a peaky, rev-happy character with some novel turbo lag. It’s rather different from the A3’s low-rpm around-town versatility. A little more displacement might even out some of the top-heavy approach: Like the A3, the S3’s turbo four-cylinder displaces 2.0 liters, though the A3’s engine has a higher compression ratio thanks to Audi’s novel B-cycle. \n\nThe S3 recommends premium fuel, while the A3 runs fine on regular — with better EPA gas mileage.\n\nRide and Handling\n\nBoth Audis we tested were outfitted with their more aggressive suspension and wheel options: 18-inch wheels and an optional sport-tuned suspension on the A3, and 19s and an S sport suspension with adaptive shock absorbers on the S3. Ride quality in the A3 is firm but livable, with some harsh impacts at highway speeds but good overall body control. The S3 rides firmer still, particularly at highway speeds, where frost heaves and other bumps can prove disruptive even in the suspension’s comfort-oriented setting; at lower speeds, it’s more similar to the A3’s sport suspension — on the workable side of firm.\n\nIt’s worth noting that tiny luxury sedans aren’t exactly a comfortable-riding group, so Audi isn’t an outlier here. The standard setup on either car (17-inch wheels on the A3, 18s with passive shocks on the S3) has the potential to soften things up, but we didn’t test an A3 or S3 thus equipped.\n\nIn both cars, Audi’s AWD earns its keep when it comes to dynamics, not just all-weather traction. It sends enough power rearward during mid-corner acceleration to fend off understeer, making for gratifying, neutral balance. Roadholding was good in both cars (the tires were Pirelli PZero all-seasons on the A3, Bridgestone Potenza high-performance summers on the S3), with minimal body roll during turn-in. Steering feedback is good across the board, with the S3’s quicker ratio delivering a welcome dose of extra sharpness.\n\nThe Inside\n\nThe A3’s interior has physical buttons in most areas, save a pod of touch-sensitive stereo controls — including the dreaded volume slider — on the center console. Still, I’ll take this over the multiple-touchscreen overkill situation you’ll find in many pricier Audis. A single dashboard touchscreen in the A3 and S3 measures a diagonal 10.1 inches, though its widescreen ratio makes the displayed area smaller than that spec suggests. Wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration are standard, as is a 10.25-inch digital gauge display. A larger (12.3-inch) unit is optional.\n\nPassenger space is in short supply. The front seats afford good sliding range but narrow berths, clapping their occupants’ knees against the doors and console. Backseat legroom is acceptable for what these cars are, but the low bench means adult passengers’ knees will be uncomfortably elevated — and there’s no payoff in headroom. In our evaluation of car-seat accommodations, the A3 had easy-access Latch anchors, but fitting our rear-facing infant and convertible seats required moving the front passenger seat so far forward, most adults couldn’t comfortably sit there.\n\nOur independent accounting of cargo volume turned up just 12.82 cubic feet of space in the A3. That’s less than the Cadillac CT4 (13.68 cubic feet), not to mention most non-luxury compact sedans (compare Cars.com cargo specs for the A3 against other cars of various sizes and body styles). Any way you slice it, the A3 is snug.\n\nOf course, that’s to be expected of an entry-level luxury sedan, but Audi’s inconsistent interior quality is less excusable. Uncharacteristic of a brand known for handsome interior finishes, the A3 and S3 sport big ribbons of low-rent, grainy plastic near the door handles and gear selector, and once you get to the rear doors, you’ll find a degree of cost-cutting that smacks of a $20,000 compact car. Even the supposed soft-touch areas up front are just barely that; it’s a check-the-box mindset that smacks of bean counters. Granted, price constraints for entry-level luxury cars have always forced tough decisions about what areas to invest in, but the skimping is obvious in the A3 and S3.\n\nShould You Buy the A3 or S3?\n\nThe A3 starts at $34,945 (all prices include destination) with FWD, which is in the ballpark with other entry-luxury models. It’s well equipped at that, with standard heated leather seats and eight-way power adjustments, tri-zone climate control, a moonroof, lane departure warning with steering assist, and forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking. AWD is standard on the S3 ($45,945) and another $2,000 on the A3. Options include adaptive cruise control, hands-on lane centering, a Nappa leather upgrade, custom paint and the upsized virtual gauges. Loaded with factory options, the A3 tops out near $50,000, while the S3 can reach over $60,000.\n\nNicer interiors, more space and better drivetrains exist for similar money as the A3 — though not necessarily all in the same car, at least among luxury brands. (You can find that by stepping down to mass-market brands, which is a longstanding reality for lower-end luxury cars, but that’s a conversation for another day.) Somewhere in all this is an equation that works for a certain A3 shopper, and if you’ve read this entire review up to now, there’s a good chance you want in on that. Still, it’s dubious justification at best for a car with obvious flaws.\n\nThe S3 is a different beast. It’s just as cramped and penny-pinched as the A3, but it combines buckets of extra power with a less objectionable transmission, addressing what could be a deal-breaking flaw of the A3. If there’s a palatable car in the A3/S3, it’s on the backside of the alphabet.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nAudi A4 and A5: Which Should You Buy, 2021 or 2022?\nAudi A6: Which Should You Buy, 2021 or 2022?\nAudi Q7, SQ7: Which Should You Buy, 2021 or 2022?\nMercedes EQC, Self-Driving Audis and Other Things That Never Came to Be\n2022 Audi E-Tron S and E-Tron S Sportback: More Money, More Power, Less Range\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Audi A3?\n\nThe A3 is Audi’s smallest and least expensive sedan, but you might not know it from behind the wheel. This little Audi four-door is fun to drive, with sharp steering and an eager 201-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder gas engine that pairs with a 48-volt mild-hybrid system. Front-wheel drive and a seven-speed automatic transmission are standard, with all-wheel drive optional; it’s standard on the zestier 306-hp S3 version. If you want even more thrills from Audi’s petite sedan, the RS 3 version boasts a 410-hp, turbocharged 2.5-liter five-cylinder that rockets from 0-60 mph in roughly 3.6 seconds. Competitors of the A3/S3/RS 3 include the Acura Integra, BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe, Cadillac CT4 and Genesis G70. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Audi A3?\n\nA3 models equipped with the Black Optic Sport Package get a new 18-inch wheel design, while the available Convenience Package adds HomeLink functionality integrated into the rearview mirror. The S3 gets carbon-look interior trim in place of the faux aluminum used previously, and Nappa leather seating is newly available on Premium Plus and Prestige trims. RS 3 models also get the carbon treatment inside, along with red stitching in place of green in models equipped with the RS Design Package. \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Audi A3 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n10.1-inch touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nTri-zone climate control\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nRain-sensing wipers\nLeather seating surfaces\nPanoramic moonroof\nHeated front seats\nPower-adjustable front seats\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nWireless smartphone charging\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nSatellite radio\nNavigation\n12.3-inch Virtual Cockpit digital gauge cluster\nHead-up instrument display\nSport exhaust system\nShould I Buy the 2024 Audi A3?\n\nThe Audi A3 is a small, well-rounded luxury sedan that’s a zippy little runabout — or a pint-sized performance monster if you opt for the RS 3. Keep in mind, though, that version carries a hefty asking price of around $62,000. Space up front is decent, and the dash design is attractive. Adults, however, won’t want to be relegated to the backseat for extended voyages. The trunk is also modest, though many car shoppers will appreciate the A3’s city-friendly proportions — and the entry-level model’s fuel-sipping nature.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Audi A3?\n\nThe Audi A3 is Audi’s smallest and least expensive sedan, but you might not know it from behind the wheel. This little Audi four-door is fun to drive, with sharp steering and an eager 201-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder paired to a 48-volt mild-hybrid system. Front-wheel drive and a seven-speed automatic transmission are standard, with all-wheel drive optional (it’s standard on the zestier 306-hp S3 version). If you want even more thrills from Audi’s petite sedan, the RS 3 boasts a 410-hp, turbocharged 2.5-liter five-cylinder that rockets from 0-60 mph in roughly 3.6 seconds. Competitors of the A3/S3/RS 3 include the Acura Integra, BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe, Cadillac CT4 and Genesis G70. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Audi A3?\n\nAfter a 2022 redesign, the A3 enters 2023 with only minor updates. Every A3 is now equipped with LED headlights and upgraded armrests, and the range-topping Prestige trim has been dropped. Adaptive cruise control is now a stand-alone option on the base A3 and S3.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Audi A3 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n10.1-inch touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nTri-zone climate control\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nRain-sensing wipers\nLeather seating surfaces\nPanoramic moonroof\nHeated front seats\nPower-adjustable front seats\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nWireless smartphone charging\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nSatellite radio\nNavigation\n12.3-inch Virtual Cockpit digital gauge cluster\nHead-up instrument display\nSport exhaust system\nShould I Buy the 2023 Audi A3?\n\nThe A3 is a small, well-rounded luxury sedan that’s a zippy little runabout — or a pint-sized performance monster if you opt for the RS 3. Keep in mind, though, that version carries a hefty asking price of around $62,000. Space up front is decent, and the dash design is attractive. Adults relegated to the backseat, however, won’t want to be back there for extended voyages. The trunk is also modest, though many car shoppers will appreciate the A3’s city-friendly proportions, as well as the entry-level trim’s fuel-sipping nature.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Though it’s more expensive than ever, the updated and feature-rich 2025 Audi A3 and S3 make a fab case for the primo, pint-size sports sedan.\n\nVersus the competition: The subcompact, entry-level luxury sedan class is hotter than you might expect, with the 2025 Audi A3 and S3 butting grilles with the BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe, Mercedes-Benz CLA and Acura Integra. For the most part, the updated Audis remain one of the most compelling offerings in the class in terms of packaging, features and driving experience.\n\nFolks, luxury sedans still exist. I know, I know — y’all really like luxury SUVs, but I think it’s worth truly considering your needs if it’s time to upgrade. I reckon a significant portion of those who spring for an Audi Q3 or Q5 SUV would be better served by one of the German brand’s excellent sedans instead, and based on a recent drive in both the refreshed 2025 Audi A3 and S3, I think the crossover cult is missing out.\n\nRelated: 2025 Audi A3: Standard AWD for Brand’s Cheapest Sedan\n\nThe upgrades for Audi’s wee entry-level sedan are minor at best, but this is coming on the heels of a redesign for the 2022 model year. Sticking with the base car — we’ll get to the medium-hot S3 in a bit — some new equipment standardization and trim tweaks make it more compelling. Inside, the biggest headlines are the new standard 10.25-inch digital driver display that’s complemented by a standard 10.1-inch center infotainment screen, while an extra 15 pounds-feet of torqueage and standard all-wheel drive further ritz up the overall package.\n\n2025 Audi S3, rear angle | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\n\nI tested the wrapper-fresh A3 for a week in Los Angeles, using it to crisscross the metroplex and zip down to Oceanside, Calif., for the accompanying S3 drive program. (Per our ethics policy, Cars.com pays for its own travel and lodging when attending such manufacturer-sponsored events.) Ultimately, I really dug the little four-door, though I do understand any hesitancy about spending $39,495 (prices include destination) for a base version — or $46,040, which was the as-tested price of my test car — on a sedan that’s a class size down from a Honda Civic.\n\nHow Big Is the 2025 Audi A3?\n\nYes, really. Run your tape measure down the flanks of each car, and you’ll find the Civic towers over the little Audi with 7.5 inches of additional length and a 4-inch-longer wheelbase. Inside, this translates to crunched knees as friends and fam will moan ‘n’ groan due to the Audi’s relatively cramped interior.\n\nSince the A3 is a purposeful segment down on the Civic, none of this is a mark against the Audi and is more a cautionary note about rear passenger accommodations. While I still believe a big portion of Q5 drivers need no more space than what the A3 offers, small cars are a hard sell in the U.S., where size is king.\n\n2025 Audi A3, front row | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\n\nWhich, again, is a shame. My loaded-out example felt properly premium, with all of the feature accoutrement expected of the marque right down to the well-weighted action of the door handles, LED headlights and taillights, the Sonos sound system and Audi’s signature lock/unlock chirp colloquially categorized as a “rich-person beep.”\n\nHow Is the Interior and Performance of the 2025 Audi A3?\n\nFit and finish is up to current Audi standards, with only a few areas of the cabin showing the burr of its entry-level status. Laser-cut, LED-backed microsuede door inserts are contrasted by some scratchy plastic patches and leather that felt of average quality. Presentation is top-notch for the segment, and Audi’s MMI infotainment architecture is still one of the best in the biz from both an ease-of-use and aesthetic perspective. And what a joy it was to use the A3’s row of clicky bidirectional switches for many of the cabin functions, including volume, climate control and the auto engine stop-start feature.\n\nI was less enthused about the powertrain. The A3’s turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder poots out 201 horsepower and 236 pounds-feet of torque, and it works with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission and now-standard AWD. Powerwise, we’re good; it’s really just the transmission that’s the issue. Shifts were mostly quick and problem-free during normal commuting, but attempting a quick downshift in the regular “D” mode — versus the selectable sport-oriented “S” shift logic — was sometimes slower and balkier than expected.\n\n2025 Audi A3, profile | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\n\nHandling and general dynamics are sharp enough to make the A3 modestly fun to drive, with quick steering and excellent body control on my test car, which was equipped with the optional sport suspension. I’d skip the latter due to its detrimental effect on ride quality, however.\n\nWhat’s the Difference Between the A3 and S3?\n\nIf it’s a luxo-performance pocket rocket you seek, skip spicing up the A3 and go straight for the equally updated S3: same platform, same engine, same transmission, only with an extra-healthy squirt of hot sauce for the new model year. The beefed-up 2.0-liter engine burbles out 328 hp and 295 pounds-feet of torque, a 22-hp bump over the prior car that’s now reined in by a standard torque-vectoring rear differential from the white-hot RS 3.\n\nThe chassis features revised geometry and bearings as well as an updated stability system unique to the S3 that Audi says results in “more engaging turn-in, cornering behavior and improved stability at the limit.” A new Dynamic Plus drive mode builds on the existing performance-oriented Dynamic mode, further sharpening the transmission shift logic and that new torque-vectoring diff.\n\nIn symphony, the S3 offers the best blend of comfort and performance in a surprisingly competitive field, a rogues’ gallery that includes the BMW M235i Gran Coupe, Mercedes-AMG CLA35 and Acura Integra Type S. Equipped with the optional adaptive sport suspension, my S3 test car was no more or less cushy over crags than the A3 with its available sport suspension, but I found the transmission and engine character much improved.\n\n2025 Audi S3, front | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nAll-New 2025 Audi A5 Replaces Previous A5 and A4\n2025 Audi A8: Updated Design, Expanded Tech and New Trim Options\nGoing Gray: 2025 Audi S6, S7 Add Nardo Sport Editions\nShop for a 2025 Audi A3 Near You\nShop for a 2025 Audi S3 Near You\nWhat’s the 2025 Audi S3 Like to Drive?\n\nAs far as my experience goes, Audi’s S products are forever the first choice in daily performance, as proven by the 2025 S3’s refreshingly muted drive experience when left in either Comfort or Auto (Audi-speak for “balanced”) drive mode. When I wound into the squigglier country roads of Temecula, Calif., the Dynamic Plus mode cranked the dial to, well, a responsible and sensible 7.5 — maybe 8. Anyone desiring their dial at 10 or 11 should seek the nutso RS 3.\n\nAudi’s claimed 4.4-second 0-60 mph  scramble for the S3 feels right on the money, with more than enough gumption for supra-legal highway merges and backroad blitzes. Grip, turn-in and mid-corner power-outs are all on par with the hottest of hot hatches, with the gluey AWD system and lightning-quick dual-clutch automatic transmission ensuring the experience is more on the technical, pseudo-antiseptic side of things than a dedicated rear-wheel-drive sports car like the Mazda MX-5 Miata or the related Subaru BRZ and Toyota GR86.\n\nIt shreds rather than sashays. Look to the rippy, grippy Volkswagen Golf R for inspo, as the S3 shares its powertrain and general capability with VW’s uber-hatch. The benefits of the new torque-vectoring tech are readily apparent, resulting in more predictable power delivery and a communicative rear end while pushin’ through a corner. This doesn’t imply any oversteer, only some observable machinations at the rear wheels as power is cleverly redistributed depending on wheel slip and steering angle.\n\nIt’s a spunky tyke, for sure. Even carrying a hefty $49,995 base price, I think the 2025 Audi S3 makes more sense than an A3 with even moderate options, especially when you consider that the size-up 2025 A4 starts at $45,395. Go hot or go big; you can’t go wrong either way.\n\nRelated Video:\n\n\n\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Audi has spread its S performance sub-brand across its car lineup, including everything from the full-size S8 luxury sedan down to the subcompact S3 hatchback. It’s a strategy also followed by fellow German luxury brands BMW and Mercedes-Benz. Those brands offer, respectively, the M240i coupe and AMG CLA45 sedan as S3 competitors (see all their specs compared here).\n\nThe Audi S3 has standard quattro all-wheel drive and starts at $43,850, including a $950 destination charge, but our test car came to $51,325 with optional features including navigation, blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert, a configurable LCD instrument panel, 19-inch wheels with summer tires, a magnetic ride adaptive suspension, manually adjustable S sport seats, and a Bang & Olufsen premium stereo.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThe S3’s personality is much different from that of the A3 sedan on which it’s based, and its hard-edged character comes through in the magnetic ride suspension’s tuning. The ride is quite firm, choppy and, on rougher surfaces, sometimes brittle — even in the Drive Select system’s Comfort mode, it doesn’t deliver anywhere near a comfortable ride. Choosing the Dynamic setting firms up the suspension even more and makes the ride even busier.\n\nA firmly tuned suspension doesn’t automatically mean a car will be entertaining to drive, and the Audi S3 proves that. Body roll is well controlled in corners, and quick steering turn-in swings the nose nicely into corners, but the S3 doesn’t urge you on when tossed into a turn like the BMW 2 Series does. The S3 is more isolating, and its steering is a big reason why. The steering wheel is highly power-assisted in Comfort mode, which lets you turn the wheel easily but doesn’t deliver much feedback. It feels a little heavier in Dynamic, but feedback is still limited.\n\nWhile the S3 comes up short on the handling front, its performance-oriented 292-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder is quite good. Smooth-revving with strong low-end power, the engine serves up swift acceleration and has ample reserves for high-speed passing.\n\nThe only transmission offered is a six-speed, dual-clutch unit. Audi has done a good job tuning it and has mostly eliminated this type of transmission’s tendency to lunge forward when letting off the brake from a stop. It did happen to me once or twice, but the transmission otherwise had the same kind of idle-creep as a regular automatic, with the added ability to make impressively quick shifts. A Sport mode is included; it keeps the transmission in lower gears and makes more aggressive downshifts when slowing down. There’s some gas-pedal lag when accelerating from a standing start in Comfort, but selecting Dynamic mode minimizes it.\n\nEPA-estimated gas mileage is 21/28/24 mpg city/highway/combined. The all-wheel-drive M240i and AMG CLA45 both make more power than the Audi S3 but are also more efficient: the M240i gets an estimated 25 mpg combined and the AMG CLA45 is rated at 26 mpg.\n\nThe Inside\n\nThe S3’s cabin has much of the premium feel that’s become a signature of Audi interiors, but the car’s roots as an entry-luxury sedan are more evident here than they are in the driving experience. There are upscale cues, like leather upholstery and brushed aluminum trim on the dashboard and doors, but the soft-touch dash and door surfaces have a rubberized finish that doesn’t feel particularly luxurious. Plus, the lower part of the door panels is hard plastic.\n\nOther features, however, seem like they’re from a more expensive luxury car. The optional Virtual Cockpit digital instrument screen has crisp, bright graphics. It’s also configurable, so you can put different types of information front and center, including a Google Earth map view (if you maintain an active Audi Connect subscription). Audi’s infotainment Multi Media Interface has a rotary knob surrounded by buttons and switches that operate the radio, optional navigation system and other features. MMI isn’t as intuitive as BMW’s iDrive system, which also uses a console controller to navigate on-screen menus, but I got the hang of it in a few days. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity is standard.\n\nThere’s decent room overall in front, but not much extra headroom; a large power moonroof is standard. The optional S sport seats have substantial side bolsters that keep you in place during fast corners, as well as fixed head restraints. The seats have power-adjustable lumbar support, but the rest of the adjustments are manual — unlike the standard sport seats, which are power-adjustable. Manual seats aren’t common at this price, and the lack of power adjustments could become quite annoying if you share a car with someone who sits differently from you.\n\nThe backseat is passable for taller adults, but there’s not much extra space and the seat cushion is a little low. Still, it’s more accommodating than a CLA-Class. The S3’s standard split, folding backrest includes a trunk pass-through. The seat folds flat with the cargo floor, extending the 10-cubic-foot trunk. \n\nSafety\n\nThe Audi S3 received a five-star overall rating — the highest possible score — from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for its front- and side-impact crash performance and rollover resistance.\n\nForward collision warning with automatic emergency braking is standard. Front and rear parking sensors and a backup camera are also standard. Options include blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert, adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping assist.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nThe S3’s $43,850 base price may seem steep for a subcompact sedan, but it includes a lot of standard features at that price while still being one of the more affordable models in its class. Still, unless you really crave the extra power of the S3’s high-output turbo four-cylinder and the cachet that comes with the small car S model, Audi’s own A4 is a compelling alternative. It’s roomier, still feels quick, has a more comfortable ride and is less expensive. That said, if only a new Audi S3 will do, you should think long and hard (and test drive) before getting one with the Dynamic Package and the magnetic ride suspension.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
