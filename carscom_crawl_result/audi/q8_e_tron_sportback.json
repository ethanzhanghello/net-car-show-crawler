      "expert_review": "Audi’s E-Tron all-electric SUV gets some significant updates for the 2024 model year, including a new name. It’s now called the Q8 e-Tron, which brings it more in line with the brand’s naming conventions for all-electric SUVs while also better separating it from the E-Tron GT sedan. The Q8 e-Tron also gets significant improvements to its battery and rear electric motors, along with aerodynamic improvements, that greatly increase its maximum estimated range and improve its efficiency — but is this enough to catch the Tesla Model Y?\n\nRelated: 2024 Audi Q8 E-Tron: Global Reveal Predicts Big Range Boost for U.S.\n\nAppears Mostly the Same\n\nThe exterior styling of the Q8 e-Tron is slightly different from its predecessor, but the changes aren’t major. There’s new front styling, which provides aerodynamic improvements, along with a longer front spoiler and new standard wheel designs. A new front lighting signature is also available. The look remains just as handsome as before and retains a more traditional SUV shape than the Model Y, though the Q8 e-Tron is also available in Sportback form with a raked liftgate that has a silhouette similar to the Tesla’s. The Q8 e-Tron looks like a luxury vehicle — which it should, given this Prestige trim’s nearly $90,000 as-tested price.\n\nThe interior goes untouched with this update, which is fine by me. It feels suitably premium and technologically advanced for a luxury vehicle, and is impressively quiet even at highway speeds. Road and wind noise are more noticeable than in an internal-combustion vehicle, but they aren’t annoying and can be easily drowned out by a podcast played at a reasonable volume.\n\nI have two quibbles with the interior. Audi’s use of touch feedback for the touchscreen displays means “button” presses require more effort and time to register — except when I was using Apple CarPlay, which operates like a traditional touchscreen. Thankfully, you can turn off touchscreen feedback in the screen settings. With haptic feedback on, I found myself either unsuccessfully pressing an Audi control or long-pressing an Apple one, though owners will likely develop muscle memory over time. The wireless device charger in the center console was also useless as anything other than a phone heater for my iPhone 12 — even when I removed it from its case. Wireless Apple CarPlay feels less convenient if you still have to plug in to charge your phone.\n\nBetter Driving Experience\n\nMaking up to 402 horsepower in Boost Mode, the Q8 e-Tron can go from 0-60 mph in an Audi-estimated 5.4 seconds. That’s not sports car quick, but it’s quick enough for an almost 5,800-pound SUV. If you’re looking for a sportier Audi electric SUV, consider the SQ8 e-Tron (formerly E-Tron S).\n\nWhile it has standard dual-motor all-wheel drive, in normal driving, the Q8 e-Tron stays in a nominal rear-wheel-drive mode, giving it pleasant on-road dynamics. A quicker steering ratio than its predecessor also improves agility, though the steering isn’t especially communicative. Ride quality is firm but composed, just like the previous generation, and the standard adaptive air suspension continues to work well. The overall effect is that of a modest improvement to the actual driving experience, and I enjoyed driving the Q8 e-Tron more than the older model.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2023 J.D. Power U.S. Tech Experience Index Study: Hyundai, Genesis Continue to Lead\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto: Where Are They Now?\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2023 Audi E-Tron?\n7 Audi SUVs Earn IIHS Top Safety Pick Awards\nBetter Practical Experience\n\nThe more significant improvements come in the form of increased practicality. The updated battery pack and improved efficiency give the Q8 e-Tron an EPA-estimated 285 miles of range, up from just 226 miles last year when it was known as the E-Tron. (The coupelike Q8 e-Tron Sportback is rated at 300 miles of range.) The Q8 e-Tron is estimated to use 41 kilowatt-hours of energy per 100 miles of driving, down from the 2023 E-Tron’s 43 kWh and 100-mile rating. That still trails the Tesla Model Y Long Range’s 28 kWh and 100 miles, however. A more efficient EV will also add more miles of range per hour than a less efficient one when charging at home, all other things being equal.\n\nCharging is also improved, with a maximum DC fast-charging rate of 170 kilowatts instead of 150 kW. Audi estimates that the Q8 e-Tron can fast-charge from 10% to 80% in as little as 31 minutes in ideal conditions. In my time with the car, I never observed 170-kW charging speeds — even at a 350-kW fast-charging station. I will say that 170 kW is something of an annoying charging rate given the state of fast-charging infrastructure in the U.S.; most stations are either 150 kW or 350 kW, leaving owners with the choice of never being able to reach the Q8 e-Tron’s maximum charging rate or hogging a station other, more capable EVs could better use.\n\nThe Q8 E-Tron has a 9.6-kW onboard charger, and when the SUV is supplied with that level of power from a home-charging system, it takes 13 hours to fully charge, according to Audi. An optional 19.2-kW charger lowers the SUV’s charging time to 6.5 hours, but that level of power requires a home charger and circuit capable of operating at 80 amps, which may not be possible without upgrades depending on your home’s electrical system.\n\nThe Q8 e-Tron also offers route planning via its built-in navigation, but the system has a few flaws that make it frustrating to use. For starters, it will count any charging station in the area or on your route as a possible charging stop, even if it’s potentially a private charger (at a non-Audi dealership or private business, for example). On top of that, while it lets you filter out non-fast-charging stations, the results still include public stations with Level 2 speeds instead of just DC fast chargers. I had more luck using third-party apps to find charging than I did using the built-in system. Volkswagen, Audi’s parent company, has yet to announce whether it will adopt the North American Charging Standard system used by Tesla, but this would be a welcome addition for road-trip charging if it also meant access to Tesla’s Supercharger network.\n\nThat said, 285 miles of range (or 300 in the case of the Sportback) gives owners more usable range for longer trips and reduces range anxiety, letting the Q8 e-Tron be more useful for longer drives than its predecessor was. Overall, the Q8 e-Tron remains a very good luxury car, and it’s now a better EV.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "After getting a new name and more range for the 2024 model year, Audi’s Q8 e-Tron lineup sees minor updates for 2025.\n\nRelated: 2024 Audi Q8 e-Tron Quick Spin: New Name, Bigger Battery, Better Experience\n\nWhat’s New\n\nQ8 e-Trons and Q8 Sportback e-Trons now include standard traffic-sign recognition, LED interior lighting and HomeLink buttons integrated into the rearview mirror. Additionally, Park Assist Plus has been upgraded to Remote Park Assist Plus, which allows external vehicle operation in permitted areas.\n\nThe Black Optic Package now features Anthracite Gray Audi rings for 2025, and the SQ8 e-Tron’s Black Optic Package is now available with 21-inch wheels with a bi-color finish and summer tires. A new Magnesium Package adds Neodymium Gold matte wheels, Magnesium and black exterior accents, puddle lamps featuring the “e-Tron Edition” logo, gray Audi rings and a body-color grille.\n\nPowertrain Specs and Range\n\nThe Q8 e-Tron and Q8 Sportback e-Tron use dual electric motors producing a combined 402 horsepower; Audi says the all-wheel-drive powertrain is good for a 0-60 mph time of 5.4 seconds. Powered by a 114-kilowatt-hour battery, both variants have an EPA-estimated range of 272 miles; the optional 21-inch wheels lower the range to 254 miles. Efficiency ratings are 77/80/78 mpg-equivalent city/highway/combined, or 73/75/74 mpg-e with the larger wheels.\n\nThe SQ8 e-Tron and SQ8 Sportback e-Tron add a third motor, increasing output to a total of 496 hp and reducing the 0-60 time to 4.2 seconds. The additional power results in a reduced EPA-estimated range of 242 miles, or 208 miles with 21- or 22-inch wheels; the SQ8s have a combined efficiency rating of 68/72/70 mpg-e, or 59/60/60 mpg-e with the bigger wheel options.\n\nPricing and Availability\n\nThe 2025 Audi Q8 e-Tron lineup is expected to arrive at dealerships soon.
