      "expert_review": "The verdict: This big five-seat SUV is comfortable and tech-savvy, but powertrain problems threaten to derail the experience.\n\nVersus the competition: The Q8’s competitors can’t match its interior volume, but a driving experience could cause shoppers to look elsewhere.\n\nBrand-new for 2019, the Audi Q8 tops the German luxury automaker’s SUV lineup as its most expensive and luxurious entrant — but not its biggest; that distinction still goes to the Q7, which is 3 inches longer and has another row of seats. Using all of the Q8’s space for only two rows of seats does give it a leg up in the spaciousness category, plus a few other interior advantages.\n\nThe Q8 competes with other oddly shaped luxury SUVs, such as the BMW X6, Mercedes-Benz GLE Coupe and Porsche Cayenne Coupe.\n\nBig Insides\n\nI drove a Q8 Prestige, which is the highest trim level, slotting above the Premium and Premium Plus. Its interior was impeccable, adorned in Valcona leather, and though I can’t keep track of all the different kinds of leather automakers offer these days, this stuff is excellent. The front seats also offer copious amounts of headroom and legroom, as you’d expect from a large SUV, but where the Q8 really takes advantage of its ample dimensions is in its expansive backseat — almost like a high-riding version of the A8 sedan.\n\nWhile you don’t get executive-style seating packages in the Q8, there is very generous backseat legroom and headroom. This came as a bit of a surprise given the rake of the roof, but even that doesn’t get in the way. It’s hard to tell from the photos, but those rear doors are massive, and the long windows on either side help the cabin feel even more open. Each side of the 60/40-split, folding backseat can slide forward about 5 inches (via manual adjustment) to open up extra cargo room.\n\nMixed Media\n\nThe Q8’s control scheme will either appeal to you or be a large sticking point — and both opinions are valid. Even among our staff, there’s a bit of a divide; I count myself among the system’s defenders, though it does have issues. Similar to the redesigned A6 and A7, which added the same control scheme for 2019, almost all of the Q8’s controls have been moved onto one of two touchscreens: a 10.1-inch screen up top that houses navigation, overall car settings and multimedia functions, and an 8.6-inch screen below that’s dedicated mostly to climate controls.\n\nI enjoy the small click and tactile feedback Audi has added to the system, lowering some of the false positives we associate with other touchscreen systems. But a simple set of buttons and knobs, like those seen on the Q3, would suffice for the climate controls and probably be easier to use. Even so, the Q8’s system does look cool and futuristic — and I guess that still kind of does it for me. It also matches the rest of the interior aesthetic, which has a wide bit of glossy plastic splayed across the dash. Watch out for that at certain times of day, though; if it catches the sun, it can get in your eyes.\n\nWireless Apple CarPlay and wired Android Auto are both standard, as is a third 12.3-inch screen in the gauge cluster. I recommend trying out the Q8’s controls during your test drive; really give them 15-20 minutes to see how they’d be to live with.\n\n2019 Audi Q8 | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\nPowertrain Problems\n\nThere’s only one powertrain configuration available for the Q8, featuring a 335-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 that makes 369 pounds-feet of torque. The engine is mated to a standard eight-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive. The all-wheel-drive system defaults to a slight rear-drive bias (40/60 split front/rear), but the Q8 doesn’t feel especially sporty. This is in part due to the steering, which has a numbness that’s endemic to many Audi models these days (especially its SUVs), plus the fact that it’s a rather large vehicle.\n\nRide quality is surprisingly good for a vehicle with lower-profile all-season tires. It was a touch loud over rough roads, but not enough to be off-putting. The Q8 presents itself well as an ultra-comfortable, plush cruiser — not unlike a large sedan, just with a higher seating position, which many drivers like.\n\nStill, this is the same powertrain you’ll find in the A7, and I found it to have a similar set of problems … but worse. It makes sense: The Q8 is 672 pounds heavier, so it puts more stress on the engine. There’s a big amount of accelerator lag even with the SUV cranked up to its more dynamic driving modes and engine settings. It’s hard to decide if this was due more to the transmission or the engine itself; perhaps it’s a bit of both. The delay would happen during acceleration on highways, but it was most pronounced when accelerating quickly from a standstill. I had a close call on an unprotected left turn because the Q8 just didn’t go quickly enough when I hit the gas.\n\nExacerbating this is a problem I encountered with the Q8’s automatic engine stop-start system, which is much better at stopping than starting. There’s a good amount of variance among these systems, and the best ones are unnoticeable. They shut down and start up smoothly, turning back on by the time your foot moves from the brake to the accelerator. The Q8 doesn’t do this; starting up is neither smooth nor well timed. There’s a noticeable hesitation and the engine isn’t ready to go when your foot is on the gas pedal; it turns on as you press the pedal and the Q8 lurches forward. The Q8 does include a 48-volt mild-hybrid system that’s intended to assist with this system, but it needs better calibration.\n\nThese issues were what stuck out to me the most during my week with the Q8. It’s a shame, because the rest of the SUV’s attributes were quite pleasant. The Q8’s EPA-estimated fuel economy ratings of 17/22/19 mpg city/highway/combined put it right in the middle of its competitors.\n\n2019 Audi Q8 | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\nSafety Features\n\nThe Q8 is outfitted with a modest amount of standard safety equipment for its price. Forward automatic emergency braking, and front and rear parking sensors are the highlights; all other advanced driving aids and safety features are optional (though lane departure warning is standard on the 2020 model). That includes adaptive cruise control, blind spot warning, vehicle exit assist and lane keep assist, among others.\n\nAlso worthy of attention is the available 360-degree camera system. The Q8 has good visibility when you’re on the road thanks to those very large windows, but since you’re seated pretty high, it can be hard to see lower objects that are closer to the vehicle — especially when parking. Thankfully, the camera system is up to the task. Not only do you get a top-down view, but you also get front views, side views, even a strange detached view as if (if you can imagine) a camera were about 15 feet away from the Q8 and filming it in real time.\n\n2019 Audi Q8 | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\nConclusion\n\nThe Q8 starts at $68,395 (including destination charges) but climbs quickly as you add packages. My test vehicle was a line-topping Prestige that added more than $20,000 to put its final price at $88,690. That’s a hefty chunk of change, and there are aspects of the Q8 that live up to that price tag, including its interior materials, technology, ride quality and spaciousness.\n\nBut I keep going back to the ineffectiveness of the powertrain, which was a consistent wet blanket on my experience. From the laggy acceleration to the foibles of the stop-start system, just when I’d begin to enjoy the Q8, I’d come to a stoplight or try to pass another car and it would just fall over itself. The Q8 is a gentle reminder that no matter the trappings, vehicles still have to be driven. A deficit in that area can sour the rest of the dish — no matter how sweet it is.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Key points:\n\nFor the 2026 model year, the Audi Q8 SUV starts at $76,895 (all prices include $1,295 destination fee).\nThe Premium Plus and Prestige trims get more standard features for 2026.\nThe SQ8 and RS Q8 performance models carry over unchanged.\n\nFor 2026, the Audi Q8 luxury SUV rolls into the new model year with more standard features and available option packages on certain trims, while the 500-horsepower SQ8 and 631-hp RS Q8 carry over unchanged. For 2026, the Q8 starts at $76,895.\n\nRelated: 2025 Audi RS Q8 Performance: Brand’s Most Powerful Combustion Engine Starts at $137,495\n\nWhat’s New?\n\nAfter a refresh for 2024, the 2026 Q8 SUV arrives with more standard features on the mid-grade Premium Plus and top Prestige trims. The five-seat variant of the three-row Audi Q7, the Q8 represents a sportier take on the luxury SUV, especially with the SQ8 and top RS Q8 Performance variant that was updated for 2025.\n\nThe Q8’s base Premium trim can be had with a Convenience Plus Package that blackens certain exterior trim bits and adds more luxurious interior features, such as a heated steering wheel and Bang & Olufsen sound system. The Premium Plus trim now gets dual-pane acoustic glass on the side windows for a more hushed ride, ventilated front seats, heated rear seats and other soft touches. (The SQ8 starts with the Premium Plus trim.)\n\nFor 2026, the range-topping Prestige adds rear-axle steering for more nimble handling at speed and for easier parking at low speeds. A Sport Plus Package takes a half-step to the SQ8 with an adaptive air suspension, red brake calipers, 23-inch wheels wrapped in summer tires and massaging front seats. (The RS Q8 only comes in the top Prestige trim and includes the goodies in the Sport Plus Package.)\n\nPricing and Release Date\n\nThe 2026 Audi Q8 family is on sale now. Full line pricing is as follows.\n\nQ8\nPremium: $76,895\nPremium Plus: $82,095\nPrestige: $87,495\nSQ8\nPremium Plus: $100,995\nPrestige: $108,495\nRS Q8\nPrestige: $139,595\nPowertrain Specs and MPG\n\nThe turbocharged V-6 and twin-turbocharged V-8 engines carry over in the 2026 Q8 family. The Q8’s turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 makes 335 hp and 369 pounds-feet of torque. The SQ8 has a 500-hp, twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 churning out 568 pounds-feet, shaving the 0-60 mph time from 5.5 to 4.0 seconds. Then there’s the RS Q8 with the altered V-8 tuned to 631 hp and 627 pounds-feet; it hits 60 mph in just 3.4 seconds. All three models send power through an eight-speed automatic transmission to Audi’s signature Quattro all-wheel drive.\n\nOfficial EPA ratings for the 2026 Q8 lineup are not yet available, but Audi says the SUV gets the same EPA estimates as the 2025 model. The EPA rates the 2025 Q8 at 17/23/19 mpg city/highway/combined, while the SQ8 returns 15/21/17 mpg. The RS Q8’s trade-off is a slash rating of 14/20/16 mpg.\n\nRead More About the Audi Q8 on Cars.com:\n\nMax Power: 2025 Audi RS Q8 Performance Packs Brand’s Most Powerful Gas Engine Ever\nWhich SUVs Can Tow at Least 5,000 Pounds?\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2021 Audi SQ8?\nAutomakers Respond Quickly to New IIHS Front Crash-Prevention Test\nResearch the Audi Q8\nSafety Features\n\nAudi equips the 2026 Q8 with a comprehensive suite of advanced safety systems. Standard equipment includes forward collision warning with pedestrian detection and automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, lane-centering steering, blind spot monitors, rear cross-traffic alert, front and rear parking sensors, traffic-sign recognition and automatic high beams. Optional safety equipment includes an upgraded forward collision warning system that watches for cross traffic during turns, an automated parking system, a 360-degree parking camera, a head-up display and a night-vision camera.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Audi Q8?\n\nThe Audi Q8 is a mid-size luxury SUV with two rows of seats and a design that emphasizes speed and sportiness. A 335-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 engine is standard and comes with an eight-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive. Stepping up to an SQ8 or RS Q8 brings a twin-turbo V-8 engine that produces 500 or 591 hp, respectively. This gives the Q8 the performance of an outright sports car — not to mention the price of one, too. An RS Q8 starts at approximately $127,000, which is about $54,000 more than an entry-level Q8. \n\nAccording to Cars.com’s own cargo measurements, the SQ8 offers 20.2 cubic feet of cargo space behind its backseat. If you plan on toting children with any regularity, you can check how the Q8 scored in our Car Seat Check. Competitors include the Land Rover Range Rover Velar, Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class, Porsche Cayenne and Maserati Levante. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Audi Q8?\n\nChanges to the Q8 and SQ8 for 2024 include new front and rear styling touches, including Matrix-design LED headlights, new wheel designs and paint colors, and some interior trim updates. Other new options include LED headlights with Audi’s laser-light high beams and customizable daytime running light signatures. The high-performance RS Q8 carries on without the styling updates, but does receive a few minor feature changes.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Audi Q8 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\nAWD\n10.1-inch infotainment screen\n8.6-inch climate control screen\nVirtual cockpit digital gauge cluster\nPanoramic moonroof \nLeather-trimmed seats\nHeated front seats\nTri-zone automatic climate control\nNavigation\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nAdaptive suspension\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nFour-zone climate control\nHeated steering wheel\nHeated rear seats\nVentilated front seats\nBang & Olufsen premium stereo system\nHead-up display \n360-degree camera system\nWireless device charging\nNight vision \nAdaptive air suspension \nFour-wheel steering\nShould I Buy the 2024 Audi Q8?\n\nThe Q8 is a luxury SUV that wants to be a sports car, and it succeeds in terms of its aggressive shape and hunkered-down stance. The twin-turbo V-8s used in the SQ8 and RS Q8 provide scintillating performance, but their price tags could make you wince. Impeccable cabin quality and two rows of spacious seating add a dollop of practicality. That said, Audi’s own Q7 SUV is not only less expensive, but it has three rows of seats and more cargo space.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2022 Audi Q8?\n\nThe five-seat Audi Q8 blends sleek and aggressive styling with SUV size and versatility. The Q8 comes with a 335-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 engine that works with an eight-speed automatic transmission. All-wheel drive is standard. Performance SQ8 and RS Q8 versions are also offered, featuring turbocharged V-8 engines that make 500 and 591 hp, respectively.\n\nCompetitors include the BMW X6, Land Rover Range Rover Velar and Maserati Levante. The SQ8 offers 20.2 cubic feet of cargo space behind its backseat, according to Cars.com’s cargo measurements. You can see how it scored in our Car Seat Check here.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2022 Audi Q8?\n\nNew standard features include 21-inch wheels, power-folding heated side mirrors, and rear-seat side-impact airbags. New standard features for the SQ8, meanwhile, include adaptive cruise control and lane assist.\n\nWhat Features in the 2022 Audi Q8 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nPower liftgate\nPanoramic moonroof\nLeather-trimmed seats\nHeated front seats\nTri-zone automatic air conditioning\nDigital instrument panel\nDual-touchscreen control system\nNavigation\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nAdaptive suspension\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nFour-zone automatic air conditioning\nHeated steering wheel\nHeated rear seats\nVentilated front seats\nBang & Olufsen premium stereo\nHead-up display\n360-degree camera system\nWireless device charging\nNight vision system\nAdaptive air suspension\nFour-wheel steering\nShould I Buy the 2022 Audi Q8?\n\nThere’s no doubt the Q8 puts style ahead of practicality, with sleek looks and a tapered tail. To its credit, it still has a large backseat, and its cabin quality is impressive. Ride quality and outward visibility are also highlights, but acceleration lag is a problem, and the drivetrain’s stop-start system isn’t great.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Audi Q8?\n\nThe Audi Q8 is a mid-size luxury SUV with two rows of seats and a design that emphasizes speed and sportiness. A 335-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 engine is standard and teams with an eight-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive. Stepping up to the SQ8 or RS Q8 brings a twin-turbo V-8 engine that produces 500 and 631 hp, respectively. This gives the Q8 the performance of an outright sports car — not to mention the price of one, too. An RS Q8 starts at approximately $137,000, which is about $62,000 more than an entry-level Q8. The Q8 family’s competitors include the Land Rover Range Rover Velar, Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class, Porsche Cayenne and Maserati Levante.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Audi Q8?\n\nChanges to the Q8 and SQ8 for 2025 are minimal, comprising new option packages and additional standard equipment. Meanwhile, the RS Q8 gets a styling refresh similar to the face-lift its siblings received last year, and it now comes solely as a Performance variant with 631 hp (40 more than last year’s RS Q8) and other high-performance touches.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Audi Q8 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nAWD\n10.1-inch infotainment screen\n8.6-inch climate-control screen\nVirtual cockpit digital gauge cluster\nPanoramic moonroof\nLeather-trimmed seats\nHeated front seats\nTri-zone automatic climate control\nNavigation\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nAdaptive suspension\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nFour-zone climate control\nHeated steering wheel\nHeated rear seats\nVentilated front seats\nBang & Olufsen premium stereo system\nHead-up display\n360-degree camera system\nWireless device charging\nNight vision\nAdaptive air suspension\nFour-wheel steering\nShould I Buy the 2025 Audi Q8?\n\nThe Q8 is a luxury SUV that wants to be a sports car, and it succeeds in terms of its aggressive shape and hunkered-down stance. The twin-turbo V-8 engines used in the SQ8 and RS Q8 provide scintillating performance, but their price tags might make you wince. Impeccable cabin quality and two rows of spacious seating add a dollop of practicality. That said, Audi’s own Q7 SUV is not only less expensive, it also has three rows of seats and more cargo space.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: This big five-seat SUV is comfortable and tech-savvy, but powertrain problems threaten to derail the experience.\n\nVersus the competition: The Q8’s competitors can’t match its interior volume, but a driving experience could cause shoppers to look elsewhere.\n\nBrand-new for 2019, the Audi Q8 tops the German luxury automaker’s SUV lineup as its most expensive and luxurious entrant — but not its biggest; that distinction still goes to the Q7, which is 3 inches longer and has another row of seats. Using all of the Q8’s space for only two rows of seats does give it a leg up in the spaciousness category, plus a few other interior advantages.\n\nThe Q8 competes with other oddly shaped luxury SUVs, such as the BMW X6, Mercedes-Benz GLE Coupe and Porsche Cayenne Coupe.\n\nBig Insides\n\nI drove a Q8 Prestige, which is the highest trim level, slotting above the Premium and Premium Plus. Its interior was impeccable, adorned in Valcona leather, and though I can’t keep track of all the different kinds of leather automakers offer these days, this stuff is excellent. The front seats also offer copious amounts of headroom and legroom, as you’d expect from a large SUV, but where the Q8 really takes advantage of its ample dimensions is in its expansive backseat — almost like a high-riding version of the A8 sedan.\n\nWhile you don’t get executive-style seating packages in the Q8, there is very generous backseat legroom and headroom. This came as a bit of a surprise given the rake of the roof, but even that doesn’t get in the way. It’s hard to tell from the photos, but those rear doors are massive, and the long windows on either side help the cabin feel even more open. Each side of the 60/40-split, folding backseat can slide forward about 5 inches (via manual adjustment) to open up extra cargo room.\n\nMixed Media\n\nThe Q8’s control scheme will either appeal to you or be a large sticking point — and both opinions are valid. Even among our staff, there’s a bit of a divide; I count myself among the system’s defenders, though it does have issues. Similar to the redesigned A6 and A7, which added the same control scheme for 2019, almost all of the Q8’s controls have been moved onto one of two touchscreens: a 10.1-inch screen up top that houses navigation, overall car settings and multimedia functions, and an 8.6-inch screen below that’s dedicated mostly to climate controls.\n\nI enjoy the small click and tactile feedback Audi has added to the system, lowering some of the false positives we associate with other touchscreen systems. But a simple set of buttons and knobs, like those seen on the Q3, would suffice for the climate controls and probably be easier to use. Even so, the Q8’s system does look cool and futuristic — and I guess that still kind of does it for me. It also matches the rest of the interior aesthetic, which has a wide bit of glossy plastic splayed across the dash. Watch out for that at certain times of day, though; if it catches the sun, it can get in your eyes.\n\nWireless Apple CarPlay and wired Android Auto are both standard, as is a third 12.3-inch screen in the gauge cluster. I recommend trying out the Q8’s controls during your test drive; really give them 15-20 minutes to see how they’d be to live with.\n\n2019 Audi Q8 | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\nPowertrain Problems\n\nThere’s only one powertrain configuration available for the Q8, featuring a 335-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 that makes 369 pounds-feet of torque. The engine is mated to a standard eight-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive. The all-wheel-drive system defaults to a slight rear-drive bias (40/60 split front/rear), but the Q8 doesn’t feel especially sporty. This is in part due to the steering, which has a numbness that’s endemic to many Audi models these days (especially its SUVs), plus the fact that it’s a rather large vehicle.\n\nRide quality is surprisingly good for a vehicle with lower-profile all-season tires. It was a touch loud over rough roads, but not enough to be off-putting. The Q8 presents itself well as an ultra-comfortable, plush cruiser — not unlike a large sedan, just with a higher seating position, which many drivers like.\n\nStill, this is the same powertrain you’ll find in the A7, and I found it to have a similar set of problems … but worse. It makes sense: The Q8 is 672 pounds heavier, so it puts more stress on the engine. There’s a big amount of accelerator lag even with the SUV cranked up to its more dynamic driving modes and engine settings. It’s hard to decide if this was due more to the transmission or the engine itself; perhaps it’s a bit of both. The delay would happen during acceleration on highways, but it was most pronounced when accelerating quickly from a standstill. I had a close call on an unprotected left turn because the Q8 just didn’t go quickly enough when I hit the gas.\n\nExacerbating this is a problem I encountered with the Q8’s automatic engine stop-start system, which is much better at stopping than starting. There’s a good amount of variance among these systems, and the best ones are unnoticeable. They shut down and start up smoothly, turning back on by the time your foot moves from the brake to the accelerator. The Q8 doesn’t do this; starting up is neither smooth nor well timed. There’s a noticeable hesitation and the engine isn’t ready to go when your foot is on the gas pedal; it turns on as you press the pedal and the Q8 lurches forward. The Q8 does include a 48-volt mild-hybrid system that’s intended to assist with this system, but it needs better calibration.\n\nThese issues were what stuck out to me the most during my week with the Q8. It’s a shame, because the rest of the SUV’s attributes were quite pleasant. The Q8’s EPA-estimated fuel economy ratings of 17/22/19 mpg city/highway/combined put it right in the middle of its competitors.\n\n2019 Audi Q8 | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\nSafety Features\n\nThe Q8 is outfitted with a modest amount of standard safety equipment for its price. Forward automatic emergency braking, and front and rear parking sensors are the highlights; all other advanced driving aids and safety features are optional (though lane departure warning is standard on the 2020 model). That includes adaptive cruise control, blind spot warning, vehicle exit assist and lane keep assist, among others.\n\nAlso worthy of attention is the available 360-degree camera system. The Q8 has good visibility when you’re on the road thanks to those very large windows, but since you’re seated pretty high, it can be hard to see lower objects that are closer to the vehicle — especially when parking. Thankfully, the camera system is up to the task. Not only do you get a top-down view, but you also get front views, side views, even a strange detached view as if (if you can imagine) a camera were about 15 feet away from the Q8 and filming it in real time.\n\n2019 Audi Q8 | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\nConclusion\n\nThe Q8 starts at $68,395 (including destination charges) but climbs quickly as you add packages. My test vehicle was a line-topping Prestige that added more than $20,000 to put its final price at $88,690. That’s a hefty chunk of change, and there are aspects of the Q8 that live up to that price tag, including its interior materials, technology, ride quality and spaciousness.\n\nBut I keep going back to the ineffectiveness of the powertrain, which was a consistent wet blanket on my experience. From the laggy acceleration to the foibles of the stop-start system, just when I’d begin to enjoy the Q8, I’d come to a stoplight or try to pass another car and it would just fall over itself. The Q8 is a gentle reminder that no matter the trappings, vehicles still have to be driven. A deficit in that area can sour the rest of the dish — no matter how sweet it is.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Audi Q8?\n\nThe 2023 Audi Q8 is a mid-size luxury SUV with two rows of seats and a design that emphasizes speed and sportiness. A 335-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 engine is standard and comes with an eight-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive. Stepping up to an SQ8 or RS Q8 brings a twin-turbo V-8 engine that produces 500 or 591 hp, respectively. This gives the Q8 the performance of an outright sports car — not to mention the price of one, too. An RS Q8 starts at approximately $127,000, which is about $54,000 more than an entry-level Q8.\n\nAccording to Cars.com’s own cargo measurements, the SQ8 offers 20.2 cubic feet of cargo space behind its backseat. If you plan on toting children with any regularity, you can check how the Q8 scored in our Car Seat Check. Competitors include the Land Rover Range Rover Velar, Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class, Porsche Cayenne and Maserati Levante.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Audi Q8?\n\nThe 2023 Audi Q8 is largely the same as the previous model year. Updates include some new standard features and trim shuffling. Headlight washers, upgraded LED headlights and animated exterior lighting when approaching or departing the vehicle are newly standard. The Convenience Package adds adaptive cruise control with lane departure steering assist; remote park assist is included on the range-topping Prestige trim; and three new exterior colors have been added to the Q8’s palette.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Audi Q8 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nAll-wheel drive\n10.1-inch infotainment screen\n8.6-inch climate control screen\nVirtual Cockpit digital gauge cluster\nPanoramic moonroof\nLeather-trimmed seats\nHeated front seats\nTri-zone automatic climate control\nNavigation\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nAdaptive suspension\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nFour-zone climate control\nHeated steering wheel\nHeated rear seats\nVentilated front seats\nBang & Olufsen premium stereo\nHead-up display\n360-degree camera system\nWireless device charging\nNight vision\nAdaptive air suspension\nFour-wheel steering\nShould I Buy the 2023 Audi Q8?\n\nThe Audi Q8 is a luxury SUV that wants to be a sports car, and it succeeds in terms of its aggressive shape and hunkered-down stance. The twin-turbo V-8s used in the SQ8 and RS Q8 provide scintillating performance, but their price tags could make you wince. Impeccable cabin quality and two rows of spacious seating add a dollop of practicality. That said, Audi’s own Q7 SUV is not only less expensive, but it has three rows of seats and more cargo space.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: This big five-seat SUV is comfortable and tech-savvy, but powertrain problems threaten to derail the experience.\n\nVersus the competition: The Q8’s competitors can’t match its interior volume, but a driving experience could cause shoppers to look elsewhere.\n\nBrand-new for 2019, the Audi Q8 tops the German luxury automaker’s SUV lineup as its most expensive and luxurious entrant — but not its biggest; that distinction still goes to the Q7, which is 3 inches longer and has another row of seats. Using all of the Q8’s space for only two rows of seats does give it a leg up in the spaciousness category, plus a few other interior advantages.\n\nThe Q8 competes with other oddly shaped luxury SUVs, such as the BMW X6, Mercedes-Benz GLE Coupe and Porsche Cayenne Coupe.\n\nBig Insides\n\nI drove a Q8 Prestige, which is the highest trim level, slotting above the Premium and Premium Plus. Its interior was impeccable, adorned in Valcona leather, and though I can’t keep track of all the different kinds of leather automakers offer these days, this stuff is excellent. The front seats also offer copious amounts of headroom and legroom, as you’d expect from a large SUV, but where the Q8 really takes advantage of its ample dimensions is in its expansive backseat — almost like a high-riding version of the A8 sedan.\n\nWhile you don’t get executive-style seating packages in the Q8, there is very generous backseat legroom and headroom. This came as a bit of a surprise given the rake of the roof, but even that doesn’t get in the way. It’s hard to tell from the photos, but those rear doors are massive, and the long windows on either side help the cabin feel even more open. Each side of the 60/40-split, folding backseat can slide forward about 5 inches (via manual adjustment) to open up extra cargo room.\n\nMixed Media\n\nThe Q8’s control scheme will either appeal to you or be a large sticking point — and both opinions are valid. Even among our staff, there’s a bit of a divide; I count myself among the system’s defenders, though it does have issues. Similar to the redesigned A6 and A7, which added the same control scheme for 2019, almost all of the Q8’s controls have been moved onto one of two touchscreens: a 10.1-inch screen up top that houses navigation, overall car settings and multimedia functions, and an 8.6-inch screen below that’s dedicated mostly to climate controls.\n\nI enjoy the small click and tactile feedback Audi has added to the system, lowering some of the false positives we associate with other touchscreen systems. But a simple set of buttons and knobs, like those seen on the Q3, would suffice for the climate controls and probably be easier to use. Even so, the Q8’s system does look cool and futuristic — and I guess that still kind of does it for me. It also matches the rest of the interior aesthetic, which has a wide bit of glossy plastic splayed across the dash. Watch out for that at certain times of day, though; if it catches the sun, it can get in your eyes.\n\nWireless Apple CarPlay and wired Android Auto are both standard, as is a third 12.3-inch screen in the gauge cluster. I recommend trying out the Q8’s controls during your test drive; really give them 15-20 minutes to see how they’d be to live with.\n\n2019 Audi Q8 | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\nPowertrain Problems\n\nThere’s only one powertrain configuration available for the Q8, featuring a 335-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 that makes 369 pounds-feet of torque. The engine is mated to a standard eight-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive. The all-wheel-drive system defaults to a slight rear-drive bias (40/60 split front/rear), but the Q8 doesn’t feel especially sporty. This is in part due to the steering, which has a numbness that’s endemic to many Audi models these days (especially its SUVs), plus the fact that it’s a rather large vehicle.\n\nRide quality is surprisingly good for a vehicle with lower-profile all-season tires. It was a touch loud over rough roads, but not enough to be off-putting. The Q8 presents itself well as an ultra-comfortable, plush cruiser — not unlike a large sedan, just with a higher seating position, which many drivers like.\n\nStill, this is the same powertrain you’ll find in the A7, and I found it to have a similar set of problems … but worse. It makes sense: The Q8 is 672 pounds heavier, so it puts more stress on the engine. There’s a big amount of accelerator lag even with the SUV cranked up to its more dynamic driving modes and engine settings. It’s hard to decide if this was due more to the transmission or the engine itself; perhaps it’s a bit of both. The delay would happen during acceleration on highways, but it was most pronounced when accelerating quickly from a standstill. I had a close call on an unprotected left turn because the Q8 just didn’t go quickly enough when I hit the gas.\n\nExacerbating this is a problem I encountered with the Q8’s automatic engine stop-start system, which is much better at stopping than starting. There’s a good amount of variance among these systems, and the best ones are unnoticeable. They shut down and start up smoothly, turning back on by the time your foot moves from the brake to the accelerator. The Q8 doesn’t do this; starting up is neither smooth nor well timed. There’s a noticeable hesitation and the engine isn’t ready to go when your foot is on the gas pedal; it turns on as you press the pedal and the Q8 lurches forward. The Q8 does include a 48-volt mild-hybrid system that’s intended to assist with this system, but it needs better calibration.\n\nThese issues were what stuck out to me the most during my week with the Q8. It’s a shame, because the rest of the SUV’s attributes were quite pleasant. The Q8’s EPA-estimated fuel economy ratings of 17/22/19 mpg city/highway/combined put it right in the middle of its competitors.\n\n2019 Audi Q8 | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\nSafety Features\n\nThe Q8 is outfitted with a modest amount of standard safety equipment for its price. Forward automatic emergency braking, and front and rear parking sensors are the highlights; all other advanced driving aids and safety features are optional (though lane departure warning is standard on the 2020 model). That includes adaptive cruise control, blind spot warning, vehicle exit assist and lane keep assist, among others.\n\nAlso worthy of attention is the available 360-degree camera system. The Q8 has good visibility when you’re on the road thanks to those very large windows, but since you’re seated pretty high, it can be hard to see lower objects that are closer to the vehicle — especially when parking. Thankfully, the camera system is up to the task. Not only do you get a top-down view, but you also get front views, side views, even a strange detached view as if (if you can imagine) a camera were about 15 feet away from the Q8 and filming it in real time.\n\n2019 Audi Q8 | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\nConclusion\n\nThe Q8 starts at $68,395 (including destination charges) but climbs quickly as you add packages. My test vehicle was a line-topping Prestige that added more than $20,000 to put its final price at $88,690. That’s a hefty chunk of change, and there are aspects of the Q8 that live up to that price tag, including its interior materials, technology, ride quality and spaciousness.\n\nBut I keep going back to the ineffectiveness of the powertrain, which was a consistent wet blanket on my experience. From the laggy acceleration to the foibles of the stop-start system, just when I’d begin to enjoy the Q8, I’d come to a stoplight or try to pass another car and it would just fall over itself. The Q8 is a gentle reminder that no matter the trappings, vehicles still have to be driven. A deficit in that area can sour the rest of the dish — no matter how sweet it is.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
