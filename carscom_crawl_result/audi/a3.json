      "expert_review": "The verdict: Though it’s more expensive than ever, the updated and feature-rich 2025 Audi A3 and S3 make a fab case for the primo, pint-size sports sedan.\n\nVersus the competition: The subcompact, entry-level luxury sedan class is hotter than you might expect, with the 2025 Audi A3 and S3 butting grilles with the BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe, Mercedes-Benz CLA and Acura Integra. For the most part, the updated Audis remain one of the most compelling offerings in the class in terms of packaging, features and driving experience.\n\nFolks, luxury sedans still exist. I know, I know — y’all really like luxury SUVs, but I think it’s worth truly considering your needs if it’s time to upgrade. I reckon a significant portion of those who spring for an Audi Q3 or Q5 SUV would be better served by one of the German brand’s excellent sedans instead, and based on a recent drive in both the refreshed 2025 Audi A3 and S3, I think the crossover cult is missing out.\n\nRelated: 2025 Audi A3: Standard AWD for Brand’s Cheapest Sedan\n\nThe upgrades for Audi’s wee entry-level sedan are minor at best, but this is coming on the heels of a redesign for the 2022 model year. Sticking with the base car — we’ll get to the medium-hot S3 in a bit — some new equipment standardization and trim tweaks make it more compelling. Inside, the biggest headlines are the new standard 10.25-inch digital driver display that’s complemented by a standard 10.1-inch center infotainment screen, while an extra 15 pounds-feet of torqueage and standard all-wheel drive further ritz up the overall package.\n\n2025 Audi S3, rear angle | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\n\nI tested the wrapper-fresh A3 for a week in Los Angeles, using it to crisscross the metroplex and zip down to Oceanside, Calif., for the accompanying S3 drive program. (Per our ethics policy, Cars.com pays for its own travel and lodging when attending such manufacturer-sponsored events.) Ultimately, I really dug the little four-door, though I do understand any hesitancy about spending $39,495 (prices include destination) for a base version — or $46,040, which was the as-tested price of my test car — on a sedan that’s a class size down from a Honda Civic.\n\nHow Big Is the 2025 Audi A3?\n\nYes, really. Run your tape measure down the flanks of each car, and you’ll find the Civic towers over the little Audi with 7.5 inches of additional length and a 4-inch-longer wheelbase. Inside, this translates to crunched knees as friends and fam will moan ‘n’ groan due to the Audi’s relatively cramped interior.\n\nSince the A3 is a purposeful segment down on the Civic, none of this is a mark against the Audi and is more a cautionary note about rear passenger accommodations. While I still believe a big portion of Q5 drivers need no more space than what the A3 offers, small cars are a hard sell in the U.S., where size is king.\n\n2025 Audi A3, front row | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\n\nWhich, again, is a shame. My loaded-out example felt properly premium, with all of the feature accoutrement expected of the marque right down to the well-weighted action of the door handles, LED headlights and taillights, the Sonos sound system and Audi’s signature lock/unlock chirp colloquially categorized as a “rich-person beep.”\n\nHow Is the Interior and Performance of the 2025 Audi A3?\n\nFit and finish is up to current Audi standards, with only a few areas of the cabin showing the burr of its entry-level status. Laser-cut, LED-backed microsuede door inserts are contrasted by some scratchy plastic patches and leather that felt of average quality. Presentation is top-notch for the segment, and Audi’s MMI infotainment architecture is still one of the best in the biz from both an ease-of-use and aesthetic perspective. And what a joy it was to use the A3’s row of clicky bidirectional switches for many of the cabin functions, including volume, climate control and the auto engine stop-start feature.\n\nI was less enthused about the powertrain. The A3’s turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder poots out 201 horsepower and 236 pounds-feet of torque, and it works with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission and now-standard AWD. Powerwise, we’re good; it’s really just the transmission that’s the issue. Shifts were mostly quick and problem-free during normal commuting, but attempting a quick downshift in the regular “D” mode — versus the selectable sport-oriented “S” shift logic — was sometimes slower and balkier than expected.\n\n2025 Audi A3, profile | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\n\nHandling and general dynamics are sharp enough to make the A3 modestly fun to drive, with quick steering and excellent body control on my test car, which was equipped with the optional sport suspension. I’d skip the latter due to its detrimental effect on ride quality, however.\n\nWhat’s the Difference Between the A3 and S3?\n\nIf it’s a luxo-performance pocket rocket you seek, skip spicing up the A3 and go straight for the equally updated S3: same platform, same engine, same transmission, only with an extra-healthy squirt of hot sauce for the new model year. The beefed-up 2.0-liter engine burbles out 328 hp and 295 pounds-feet of torque, a 22-hp bump over the prior car that’s now reined in by a standard torque-vectoring rear differential from the white-hot RS 3.\n\nThe chassis features revised geometry and bearings as well as an updated stability system unique to the S3 that Audi says results in “more engaging turn-in, cornering behavior and improved stability at the limit.” A new Dynamic Plus drive mode builds on the existing performance-oriented Dynamic mode, further sharpening the transmission shift logic and that new torque-vectoring diff.\n\nIn symphony, the S3 offers the best blend of comfort and performance in a surprisingly competitive field, a rogues’ gallery that includes the BMW M235i Gran Coupe, Mercedes-AMG CLA35 and Acura Integra Type S. Equipped with the optional adaptive sport suspension, my S3 test car was no more or less cushy over crags than the A3 with its available sport suspension, but I found the transmission and engine character much improved.\n\n2025 Audi S3, front | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nAll-New 2025 Audi A5 Replaces Previous A5 and A4\n2025 Audi A8: Updated Design, Expanded Tech and New Trim Options\nGoing Gray: 2025 Audi S6, S7 Add Nardo Sport Editions\nShop for a 2025 Audi A3 Near You\nShop for a 2025 Audi S3 Near You\nWhat’s the 2025 Audi S3 Like to Drive?\n\nAs far as my experience goes, Audi’s S products are forever the first choice in daily performance, as proven by the 2025 S3’s refreshingly muted drive experience when left in either Comfort or Auto (Audi-speak for “balanced”) drive mode. When I wound into the squigglier country roads of Temecula, Calif., the Dynamic Plus mode cranked the dial to, well, a responsible and sensible 7.5 — maybe 8. Anyone desiring their dial at 10 or 11 should seek the nutso RS 3.\n\nAudi’s claimed 4.4-second 0-60 mph  scramble for the S3 feels right on the money, with more than enough gumption for supra-legal highway merges and backroad blitzes. Grip, turn-in and mid-corner power-outs are all on par with the hottest of hot hatches, with the gluey AWD system and lightning-quick dual-clutch automatic transmission ensuring the experience is more on the technical, pseudo-antiseptic side of things than a dedicated rear-wheel-drive sports car like the Mazda MX-5 Miata or the related Subaru BRZ and Toyota GR86.\n\nIt shreds rather than sashays. Look to the rippy, grippy Volkswagen Golf R for inspo, as the S3 shares its powertrain and general capability with VW’s uber-hatch. The benefits of the new torque-vectoring tech are readily apparent, resulting in more predictable power delivery and a communicative rear end while pushin’ through a corner. This doesn’t imply any oversteer, only some observable machinations at the rear wheels as power is cleverly redistributed depending on wheel slip and steering angle.\n\nIt’s a spunky tyke, for sure. Even carrying a hefty $49,995 base price, I think the 2025 Audi S3 makes more sense than an A3 with even moderate options, especially when you consider that the size-up 2025 A4 starts at $45,395. Go hot or go big; you can’t go wrong either way.\n\nRelated Video:\n\n\n\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Audis keep getting better, from the “entry-level” A3 to the top-of-the-line S8. They also keep getting more expensive.\n\nCase in point: Our 2007 A3 3.2 Quattro S line, which carried a price tag of $42,300. You understand why we put the term “entry-level” in quotes.\n\nOutside of the jaw-dropping sticker and a few quibbles, there isn’t much to dislike about the A3 3.2 Quattro.\n\nSHE: OK, just let me get this out of the way, so we can heap lots of praise on the A3. But didn’t you tell me this compact five-door hatchback shares its basic running gear with the Volkswagen Rabbit? And doesn’t the Rabbit start at just over $15,000? I really love the A3, but I’m having trouble figuring out where Audi put that extra $27,000.\n\nHE: I don’t have an answer that will satisfy frugal shoppers. Suffice to say the new A3 3.2 Quattro S line is aimed squarely at enthusiasts and affluent young families, and it hits the mark dead on. If you’re looking for a sporty economy car, look elsewhere. Although the V-6 engine isn’t so bad on gas mileage, with EPA ratings of 21 and 27. I also love that six-speed direct-shift gearbox, which comes with fingertip shift controls on the steering wheel. You won’t find that on a Rabbit — or any other competitor in this segment.\n\nSHE: Oh, there’s plenty to like about the A3, starting with the sleek exterior. It looks sportier and more modern than a conventional wagon, but it’s just as versatile. The cabin is refined and tastefully trimmed. Audi does a great job, too, on all the little details, things like those knurled rotary knobs on the steering wheel for the audio system. I wish the navigation system weren’t quite so complicated; it doesn’t seem nearly as intuitive as on some of the Japanese compacts we’ve tested.\n\nHE: I only have two real beefs with the A3, and they both concern the interior. For one thing, there isn’t much legroom front or rear. The other concerns the $1,100 “open sky” panoramic sunroof. Instead of hard covers, Audi has installed crummy mesh screens that look and feel cheap, and let in way too much sun during the daytime.\n\nSHE: Audi certainly didn’t scrimp on safety. The standard equipment includes antilock brakes, traction and stability control, side air bags and side curtains. Our test car also came with adaptive headlamps, which were bundled in a $1,250 technology package. It’s hard for me to recommend many small cars to families because the companies tend to cut corners by making too much of the safety hardware as an extra-cost option. The A3 gets a hearty endorsement on the safety front.\n\nHE: Enthusiasts will also appreciate the A3’s torquey 3.2-liter V-6, which makes 250 horsepower and 236 pounds-feet. It pulls like a draft horse from the get-go, and gallops from zero to 60 in less than seven seconds. SHE: I still can’t quite justify a sticker that’s nearly three times the base price of a Rabbit. But if you appreciate the functionality and style of a five-door, crave performance and refinement, and won’t blanch at a $40,000-plus window sticker, the A3 3.2 Quattro S line is a pretty sensational car.",

      "expert_review": "Audi’s smallest offering, the compact A3, arrived last May.\n\nThough still a newcomer to the market, Audi has brought out an upgrade to the lineup that had been limited to 2-liter, turbocharged 4-cylinder engines with the addition of the A3 3.2. The 3.2 designates its 3.2-liter, 250-horsepower V-6 that provides even more spirit.\n\nAnd to ensure it not only sprints from the light and shoots into and out of the passing lane, the compact hatchback has Audi’s well-known, and much-appreciated, Quattro permanent all-wheel-drive system.\n\nWhile the V-6 delivers a kick, the pinpoint handling of Quattro was the highlight of the test drive. Point and go, quickly and in total control.\n\nRain and snow meant backing off the pedal only a smidge. The A3 comes with electronic stability control to keep you from taking any unexpected detours from the intended path, while four-wheel anti-lock brakes provide the same security when coming to a stop.\n\nThose who like their four-wheel toys will find the A3 ready for adventure. It comes with a road-friendly sports suspension to keep the hatchback planted to the pavement.\n\nAnd the 6-speed automatic has a Direct Shift Gearbox, one of those manual-mode shifters with paddles behind the steering wheel for enthusiasts who like to venture between gears on their own rather than leaving the driving to the trans.\n\nBut, if simply looking for a small family hatchback or a commuter car for the daily grind, A3 probably wouldn’t be at the top of your list–despite its handling and above-average road manners.\n\nThe reason the A3 should be left to enthusiasts is that it started life as a compact and despite that sprightly V-6 and all-wheel-drive, a compact is what it stays.\n\nFront-seat cabin room is a tad snug and rear-seat leg and knee room are tight. Front seats are a bit stiff and are contoured more for the “Next Great American Model”than the more than slightly out-of-shape automotive scribe.\n\nIf you stop at the club to work out daily, you’ll slip into the seats with ease. If you pass the club to pick up an extra large cheese and sausage, you’ll plop onto the seats and wish the side bolsters had a power expand button.\n\nThere are a few other features that the enthusiast might overlook or accept in the interest of zero- to 60-m.p.h. times.\n\nThe rear seat backs fold, for example, but not flat so if you have to carry items in the cabin as well as the storage hold, you have to balance the load with care.\n\nAlso, the test vehicle came with the optional ($1,100) Open Sky system, a fancy term for a power sunroof upfront, a fixed-glass roof panel in back. Audi says the fixed-glass roof allows occupants to commune with the outdoors, but what it really does is give cramped passengers in back a look at the sky to take their minds off the squeeze.\n\nAnd when the roof was cracked open a few inches, there was a lot of wind noise and the radio had to be dialed up more than a few decibels to keep up.\n\nThe power windows are the one-touch variety. Press and the glass quickly motors down, a nice feature at the toll booth for those who resist I-Pass, but not for those who simply want to open a few inches to circulate some fresh air. The glass seemed hell-bent on opening all the way each and every time.\n\nAlso, the 3.2-liter V-6 is rated at 21 m.p.g. city/27 m.p.g. highway, decent considering the V-6’s power and acceptable considering full-time all-wheel-drive, but still a tad disappointing considering the size of this machine.\n\nAnd OK, it’s a high-performance compact, but the base price is $33,980 and with the options added to the test car, the sticker was only $2,250 shy of $40,000–before tax. Had to be a hefty price per pound.\n\nStandard equipment includes power driver’s seat with lumbar control; automatic dual-zone climate control with dust and pollen filters; power windows, mirrors and door locks; front and rear side-curtain air bags; AM/FM radio with Bose sound; wiring for satellite radio so you can choose between Sirius and XM; eight-disc CD player; rear window defogger; leather seating surfaces; cruise control; and front fog lights.\n\nTwo neat features are a pair of power plugs in the stowage compartment under the front-seat center arm-rest and a small net cargo holder along the rear side wall.\n\n2006 Chevrolet Malibu Maxx\n\nWe’ve drove and enjoyed the Malibu Maxx when it first came out for the 2004 model year as the hatchback companion–with a 6-inch wheelbase stretch–to the midsize Chevy Malibu sedan.\n\nMaxx offers good room and hauls people in comfort and lots of their packages.\n\nA clever shelf in the cargo hold can be raised or lowered to a variety of levels to accommodate items on top or underneath or, with the help of a plastic leg, can serve as an “indoors” table for picnics or tailgating.\n\nAnother neat feature is that the second-row seat moves back several inches to provide more leg room or moves forward several inches to keep the baby in the child seat close at hand.\n\nFor 2006 Malibu and Maxx got a minor front-end freshening, and both added higher-performance SS models, with a lot more spunk than the regular models.\n\nWe tested the Maxx SS with its new 3.9-liter, 240-h.p. V-6, an upgrade from the 3.5-liter, 201-h.p. V-6 offered in the regular Maxx. The 3.9-liter is teamed with a 4-speed automatic with a manual shift mode.\n\nThe SS also has a sports-tuned suspension with 18-inch radial tires to provide better handling than the standard 16-inchers on the regular version.\n\nIt’s no Audi A3 in terms of performance or handling, but the thing can scoot and turns what looks like a midsize family workhorse into a surprisingly active plaything.\n\nWith the SS hardware, Maxx goes from tame to tantalizing in terms of spirit and lead-the-pack energy.\n\nBase price is $24,065, and for that you get anti-lock brakes; side-curtain air bags; air conditioning; and power windows, locks and mirrors.\n\nQuestion is how long Maxx will be offered and in what form. The Malibu sedan is redone for 2007 and insiders said a decision has yet to be made on whether Maxx will stay in the lineup and, if so, whether it would continue as a hatchback or perhaps be transformed into a midsize crossover.\n\n– – –\n\n2006 Audi A3 3.2 S Quattro\n\nPrice as tested: $36,930\n\nWheelbase: 101.5 inches\n\nLength: 168.7 inches\n\nEngine: 3.2-liter, 250-h.p.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Audi A3?\n\nThe Audi A3 is Audi’s smallest and least expensive sedan, but you might not know it from behind the wheel. This little Audi four-door is fun to drive, with sharp steering and an eager 201-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder paired to a 48-volt mild-hybrid system. Front-wheel drive and a seven-speed automatic transmission are standard, with all-wheel drive optional (it’s standard on the zestier 306-hp S3 version). If you want even more thrills from Audi’s petite sedan, the RS 3 boasts a 410-hp, turbocharged 2.5-liter five-cylinder that rockets from 0-60 mph in roughly 3.6 seconds. Competitors of the A3/S3/RS 3 include the Acura Integra, BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe, Cadillac CT4 and Genesis G70. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Audi A3?\n\nAfter a 2022 redesign, the A3 enters 2023 with only minor updates. Every A3 is now equipped with LED headlights and upgraded armrests, and the range-topping Prestige trim has been dropped. Adaptive cruise control is now a stand-alone option on the base A3 and S3.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Audi A3 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n10.1-inch touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nTri-zone climate control\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nRain-sensing wipers\nLeather seating surfaces\nPanoramic moonroof\nHeated front seats\nPower-adjustable front seats\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nWireless smartphone charging\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nSatellite radio\nNavigation\n12.3-inch Virtual Cockpit digital gauge cluster\nHead-up instrument display\nSport exhaust system\nShould I Buy the 2023 Audi A3?\n\nThe A3 is a small, well-rounded luxury sedan that’s a zippy little runabout — or a pint-sized performance monster if you opt for the RS 3. Keep in mind, though, that version carries a hefty asking price of around $62,000. Space up front is decent, and the dash design is attractive. Adults relegated to the backseat, however, won’t want to be back there for extended voyages. The trunk is also modest, though many car shoppers will appreciate the A3’s city-friendly proportions, as well as the entry-level trim’s fuel-sipping nature.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Audi A3?\n\nThe A3 is Audi’s entry-level car and is available as a five-seat sedan; the previously available convertible version has been discontinued for 2020. The front-wheel-drive A3 comes with a 184-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, while the all-wheel-drive version gets a 228-hp, turbo four-cylinder. Both engines work with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission.\n\nThe A3 is also offered in two performance-tuned variants, the S3 and RS 3. The S3 gets a 288-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder, while the RS 3 is powered by a turbocharged 2.5-liter five-cylinder that makes 394 hp. Competitors include the BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe and Mercedes-Benz A-Class.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Audi A3?\n\nA new Final Edition Package includes black or red leather sport seats with contrast stitching, and a three-spoke flat-bottom steering wheel with shift paddles. All-wheel-drive A3s get S line badges, aluminum door sills and unique 18-inch wheels. A new, less expensive Premium trim level joins the S3 lineup for 2020.\n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Audi A3 Are Most Important?\n\nAll-wheel drive has been a hallmark of Audi’s lineup for decades, and it’s standard or available on all variants of the A3 line. The A3 also offers many features found on larger luxury models, including a panoramic moonroof, leather upholstery, heated front seats, and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity. The S3 and RS 3 have sports-car-challenging performance. Bear in mind, however, that the price of a fully loaded RS 3 can be about double that of a base A3.\n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Audi A3?\n\nIf you want an Audi badge for a minimum amount of money, the A3 is a tempting proposition; it has much of the design and driving experience provided by bigger, more expensive German sedans. A cramped rear seat and some austere cabin trim detracts from the overall posh image, however.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Audi A3?\n\nThe A3 is Audi’s smallest and least expensive sedan, but you might not know it from behind the wheel. This little Audi four-door is fun to drive, with sharp steering and an eager 201-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder gas engine that pairs with a 48-volt mild-hybrid system. Front-wheel drive and a seven-speed automatic transmission are standard, with all-wheel drive optional; it’s standard on the zestier 306-hp S3 version. If you want even more thrills from Audi’s petite sedan, the RS 3 version boasts a 410-hp, turbocharged 2.5-liter five-cylinder that rockets from 0-60 mph in roughly 3.6 seconds. Competitors of the A3/S3/RS 3 include the Acura Integra, BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe, Cadillac CT4 and Genesis G70. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Audi A3?\n\nA3 models equipped with the Black Optic Sport Package get a new 18-inch wheel design, while the available Convenience Package adds HomeLink functionality integrated into the rearview mirror. The S3 gets carbon-look interior trim in place of the faux aluminum used previously, and Nappa leather seating is newly available on Premium Plus and Prestige trims. RS 3 models also get the carbon treatment inside, along with red stitching in place of green in models equipped with the RS Design Package. \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Audi A3 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n10.1-inch touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nTri-zone climate control\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nRain-sensing wipers\nLeather seating surfaces\nPanoramic moonroof\nHeated front seats\nPower-adjustable front seats\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nWireless smartphone charging\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nSatellite radio\nNavigation\n12.3-inch Virtual Cockpit digital gauge cluster\nHead-up instrument display\nSport exhaust system\nShould I Buy the 2024 Audi A3?\n\nThe Audi A3 is a small, well-rounded luxury sedan that’s a zippy little runabout — or a pint-sized performance monster if you opt for the RS 3. Keep in mind, though, that version carries a hefty asking price of around $62,000. Space up front is decent, and the dash design is attractive. Adults, however, won’t want to be relegated to the backseat for extended voyages. The trunk is also modest, though many car shoppers will appreciate the A3’s city-friendly proportions — and the entry-level model’s fuel-sipping nature.",

      "expert_review": "If I told you that General Motors was selling a wagon that barely had space for five people and not much room for their luggage, a wagon that got 25 miles per gallon on the highway sucking premium unleaded gasoline and that had a base price of nearly $35,000, most of you would laugh, or shake your heads in pity and start counting the days until GM went out of business.\n\nBut there is such a wagon, actually a little hatchback, the Audi A3 3.2 Quattro, one of two A3 models introduced in the United States in 2005.\n\nNo one is laughing at the little runner. The 3.2 Quattro and its companion A3 2.0T have been selling well — up 49.2 percent from 5,389 sold in the United States in 2005 to 8,040 sold last year. A3 sales remain strong in 2007, with the most expensive model, the 3.2 Quattro driven for this column, dominating consumer attention.\n\nHow is that possible? How can a company offer a vehicle that, in terms of utility and overall value, easily is outclassed by others in its price category and still be successful?\n\nIt’s simple. It’s cachet. German automobile manufacturer Audi has it. GM, in the thinking of many consumers in the American marketplace, doesn’t.\n\nCachet sells. It generates profits through the exploitation of perceived value, as opposed to pulling dollars from the actual worth of a thing itself.\n\nIn the 10 years between its birth in Europe and its arrival on U.S. shores, the A3 changed from an economy car to an “entry-level luxury” automobile — in keeping with Audi’s long-range goal to firmly establish itself in the American psyche as a manufacturer of premium cars. For 2008, the A3 remains pretty much as it was in its U.S. debut, with the exception of changes to accommodate iPods, MP3 players and other infotainment electronics consumers now want in their personal vehicles.\n\n“Entry-level luxury car” in A3 parlance means a base price of nearly $26,000 for the front-wheel-drive 2.0T and a few bucks shy of $35,000 for the all-wheel-drive 3.2 Quattro. Let’s put that in perspective:\n\nThe base A3 2.0T is the closest you can get to a stripper car and still be in an Audi in the U.S. market. It has a standard, six-speed manual transmission; a turbocharged, two-liter, 207-horsepower, four-cylinder engine; a need for premium unleaded gasoline; and a federal fuel-economy rating of 21 miles per gallon in the city and 29 mpg on the highway.\n\nThe tested 3.2 Quattro has more oomph with a 3.2-liter, 250-horsepower V-6. It gets 18 miles per gallon in the city and 25 miles per gallon on the highway and comes with that nearly $35,000 price tag.\n\nFor similar money, a price range of $26,000 to $35,000, a consumer could buy a much larger, much more utilitarian, front-wheel-drive Chevrolet Impala sedan with a 3.9-liter, 233-horsepower V-6 engine that gets 18 miles per gallon in the city and 28 miles per gallon on the highway — using less-expensive regular unleaded gasoline.\n\nGranted, this is an apples-and-oranges comparison. The 3.2 Quattro is a compact hatchback and the Impala is a mid-size sedan — and they are worlds apart from each other in consumer perception. But my point is that the Impala does a substantially better job than the A3 wagons in doing what cars and wagons basically are designed to do: move people and their stuff.\n\nEven if you did a more logical comparison — small all-wheel-drive wagon versus small all-wheel-drive wagon — you’d have to scratch your head pondering the cost of the tested 3.2 Quattro versus that of, say, the much more accommodating but equally powerful Subaru Legacy 2.5 GT Limited that sells at a base price nearly $2,000 less.\n\nBut, again, perception rules the auto retail business. In that world, comparing an Audi with a Subaru makes about as much sense as comparing a diamond bought from Jared with one purchased from Wal-Mart. Both glisten. But only one has cachet.\n\nThat one, here, is the 3.2 Quattro. It does not carry five people as comfortably as transporting them in a Chevrolet Impala sedan or a Subaru Legacy wagon. It does not offer more safety, reliability or fuel economy. It runs faster and handles better than many vehicles in the same price category. It is more fun to drive. It definitely has pizazz.\n\nBut there is only so much I’m willing to pay for fun and prestige, especially at the expense of almost everything else. The 3.2 Quattro pushes the limit.\n\nNUTS & BOLTS\n\n2008 Audi A3 3.2 Quattro\n\nComplaints: The Audi A3 3.2 Quattro wagon costs too much. It runs the risk of crashing into common sense and injuring the one major thing it has going for it — cache. It validates reverse snobbery.\n\nDrive, acceleration and handling: All are excellent. No complaints here. But if you want a small sports sedan or coupe, you should buy one of those instead of buying what is supposed to be a wagon.\n\nHead-turning quotient: Chic, expensive and priced to stay that way.\n\nBody style/layout: The Audi A3 is a compact, “entry-level-luxury,” front-engine, four-door wagon with a rear hatch. It is available with front-wheel-drive or all-wheel-drive and is offered in two basic trim levels — 2.0T and 3.2 Quattro.\n\nEngine/transmission: The 3.2 Quattro comes with a 3.2-liter, 24-valve V-6 that develops 250 horsepower at 6,300 revolutions per minute and 236 pound-feet of torque at 2,800 revolutions per minute. It is mated to a six-speed automatic transmission that can be shifted manually.\n\nCapacities: There is seating for five people. But rear-seat space is cramped. Maximum luggage capacity is 19.5 cubic feet with the 60/40-split rear seats folded down. But it diminishes greatly with rear seats up. The fuel tank holds 14.5 gallons of required premium unleaded.\n\nMileage: Real-world mileage was not impressive for a compact wagon. I and my associate, Ria Manglapus, had a combined city-highway mileage of 20 miles per gallon.\n\nSafety: Side and head air bags, electronic stability and traction control are standard.\n\nPrice: Base price on the 2008 Audi A3 3.2 Quattro is $34,915. Dealer’s invoice price on the base model is $32,412. Price as tested is $41,225, including $5,535 in options (navigation system with iPod interface, sunroof, heated leather seats, Bluetooth phone interface) and a $775 destination charge. Dealer’s price as tested is $38,225. Prices sourced from Audi and www.edmunds.com.\n\nPurse-strings note: The more options you put on this little wagon, the less “entry-level” sense it makes.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Redesigned for 2022, the Audi A3 and S3 sedans offer balanced handling and myriad standard features, but hesitant transmissions and inconsistent quality let them down.\n\nVersus the competition: With consumers overwhelmingly preferring SUVs these days, any small luxury sedan starting around $35,000 better be one hell of a car to justify its existence. The A3 and S3 have their moments, but drawbacks we experienced behind the wheel and elsewhere keep both cars short of the mark.\n\nWith front- or all-wheel drive, the A3 runs from the mid-$30,000s to around $50,000. The S3 packs considerably more performance and standard AWD; it’ll set you back another $11,000 or so at either end of the trim lineup. Around Cars.com’s Chicago headquarters, we drove an A3 with AWD and Audi’s optional sport suspension; we also drove the A3 and S3 back-to-back at a drive event in October in southeast Michigan. See our initial take after that drive, stack up the new A3 and S3 side by side, or compare them with their prior-generation 2020 counterparts (both cars skipped the 2021 model year).\n\nRelated: 2022 Audi A3, S3 Quick Spin: Transmission Travails\n\nAudi has also redesigned the related RS 3, which offers even more performance, but it had not yet debuted as of this writing.\n\nLost in Transmission\n\nWhether it’s the weak initial grunt of the BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe or the modest overall power of the Mercedes-Benz A220, the base powertrains in many entry-luxury sedans have been underwhelming. So it goes for Audi: From a stop, the A3’s turbo four-cylinder (201 horsepower and 221 pounds-feet of torque) delivers swift accelerator response and robust, usable oomph early on. But once you reach cruising speed, that oomph is hard to access.\n\nThe culprit seems to be the A3’s transmission, a dual-clutch seven-speed automatic, which upshifts early and often. When you try to accelerate when already in motion, though, it needs a cigarette break before obliging. By my stopwatch, the A3 consistently needed a full two seconds to downshift into a lower gear and surge ahead during a standard 50 mph kickdown maneuver — despite plenty of engine windup that suggested something was coming. That’s a third longer than most cars I run through that test require and twice as long as the most responsive examples. \n\nTransmission kickdown at lower speeds seemed similarly delayed in the A3, though I didn’t time it. It wasn’t just me, either; multiple Cars.com editors have criticized the A3’s transmission. The sedan’s Dynamic setting — which is the sportiest of several selectable drive modes — holds lower gears longer than the default mode, which lessens the need to kick down as often. But when the drivetrain eventually does settle into a higher gear, requesting a lower one can take just as long.\n\nThe S3 (306 hp and 295 pounds-feet of torque) betters kickdown lag to a more average delay. The car is expectedly quick, especially as rpm builds. Power becomes explosive past 5,000 rpm or so — enough to lend the car a peaky, rev-happy character with some novel turbo lag. It’s rather different from the A3’s low-rpm around-town versatility. A little more displacement might even out some of the top-heavy approach: Like the A3, the S3’s turbo four-cylinder displaces 2.0 liters, though the A3’s engine has a higher compression ratio thanks to Audi’s novel B-cycle. \n\nThe S3 recommends premium fuel, while the A3 runs fine on regular — with better EPA gas mileage.\n\nRide and Handling\n\nBoth Audis we tested were outfitted with their more aggressive suspension and wheel options: 18-inch wheels and an optional sport-tuned suspension on the A3, and 19s and an S sport suspension with adaptive shock absorbers on the S3. Ride quality in the A3 is firm but livable, with some harsh impacts at highway speeds but good overall body control. The S3 rides firmer still, particularly at highway speeds, where frost heaves and other bumps can prove disruptive even in the suspension’s comfort-oriented setting; at lower speeds, it’s more similar to the A3’s sport suspension — on the workable side of firm.\n\nIt’s worth noting that tiny luxury sedans aren’t exactly a comfortable-riding group, so Audi isn’t an outlier here. The standard setup on either car (17-inch wheels on the A3, 18s with passive shocks on the S3) has the potential to soften things up, but we didn’t test an A3 or S3 thus equipped.\n\nIn both cars, Audi’s AWD earns its keep when it comes to dynamics, not just all-weather traction. It sends enough power rearward during mid-corner acceleration to fend off understeer, making for gratifying, neutral balance. Roadholding was good in both cars (the tires were Pirelli PZero all-seasons on the A3, Bridgestone Potenza high-performance summers on the S3), with minimal body roll during turn-in. Steering feedback is good across the board, with the S3’s quicker ratio delivering a welcome dose of extra sharpness.\n\nThe Inside\n\nThe A3’s interior has physical buttons in most areas, save a pod of touch-sensitive stereo controls — including the dreaded volume slider — on the center console. Still, I’ll take this over the multiple-touchscreen overkill situation you’ll find in many pricier Audis. A single dashboard touchscreen in the A3 and S3 measures a diagonal 10.1 inches, though its widescreen ratio makes the displayed area smaller than that spec suggests. Wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration are standard, as is a 10.25-inch digital gauge display. A larger (12.3-inch) unit is optional.\n\nPassenger space is in short supply. The front seats afford good sliding range but narrow berths, clapping their occupants’ knees against the doors and console. Backseat legroom is acceptable for what these cars are, but the low bench means adult passengers’ knees will be uncomfortably elevated — and there’s no payoff in headroom. In our evaluation of car-seat accommodations, the A3 had easy-access Latch anchors, but fitting our rear-facing infant and convertible seats required moving the front passenger seat so far forward, most adults couldn’t comfortably sit there.\n\nOur independent accounting of cargo volume turned up just 12.82 cubic feet of space in the A3. That’s less than the Cadillac CT4 (13.68 cubic feet), not to mention most non-luxury compact sedans (compare Cars.com cargo specs for the A3 against other cars of various sizes and body styles). Any way you slice it, the A3 is snug.\n\nOf course, that’s to be expected of an entry-level luxury sedan, but Audi’s inconsistent interior quality is less excusable. Uncharacteristic of a brand known for handsome interior finishes, the A3 and S3 sport big ribbons of low-rent, grainy plastic near the door handles and gear selector, and once you get to the rear doors, you’ll find a degree of cost-cutting that smacks of a $20,000 compact car. Even the supposed soft-touch areas up front are just barely that; it’s a check-the-box mindset that smacks of bean counters. Granted, price constraints for entry-level luxury cars have always forced tough decisions about what areas to invest in, but the skimping is obvious in the A3 and S3.\n\nShould You Buy the A3 or S3?\n\nThe A3 starts at $34,945 (all prices include destination) with FWD, which is in the ballpark with other entry-luxury models. It’s well equipped at that, with standard heated leather seats and eight-way power adjustments, tri-zone climate control, a moonroof, lane departure warning with steering assist, and forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking. AWD is standard on the S3 ($45,945) and another $2,000 on the A3. Options include adaptive cruise control, hands-on lane centering, a Nappa leather upgrade, custom paint and the upsized virtual gauges. Loaded with factory options, the A3 tops out near $50,000, while the S3 can reach over $60,000.\n\nNicer interiors, more space and better drivetrains exist for similar money as the A3 — though not necessarily all in the same car, at least among luxury brands. (You can find that by stepping down to mass-market brands, which is a longstanding reality for lower-end luxury cars, but that’s a conversation for another day.) Somewhere in all this is an equation that works for a certain A3 shopper, and if you’ve read this entire review up to now, there’s a good chance you want in on that. Still, it’s dubious justification at best for a car with obvious flaws.\n\nThe S3 is a different beast. It’s just as cramped and penny-pinched as the A3, but it combines buckets of extra power with a less objectionable transmission, addressing what could be a deal-breaking flaw of the A3. If there’s a palatable car in the A3/S3, it’s on the backside of the alphabet.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nAudi A4 and A5: Which Should You Buy, 2021 or 2022?\nAudi A6: Which Should You Buy, 2021 or 2022?\nAudi Q7, SQ7: Which Should You Buy, 2021 or 2022?\nMercedes EQC, Self-Driving Audis and Other Things That Never Came to Be\n2022 Audi E-Tron S and E-Tron S Sportback: More Money, More Power, Less Range\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nAudi’s entry-level sedan and convertible get a mild update for the 2017 model year, bringing some new styling, additional features and a simplification of powertrains to the luxury car’s lineup. Changes are coming to the A3 sedan, A3 Cabriolet convertible and S3 performance sedan in October, but the A3 Sportback e-tron hybrid will continue on unchanged; it will get its own updates at a later date.\nExteriorFrom the outside, not much has changed. The front end is slightly revised with new undercut headlights and a larger Singleframe grille, while the back end gets new LED taillights and an updated bumper and diffuser for the Cabriolet. The S3 gets a slightly different grille with additional bars, while Premium Plus and Prestige trims get a standard S-Line appearance package. Out back, the A3 and A3 Cabriolet get dual exhaust, while the A3 continues with a quad-outlet exhaust system.\nInteriorInside, changes are mostly to the vehicles’ electronics. Audi’s virtual cockpit is now optional, which replaces the gauge cluster with an LCD display screen like the one seen in the new R8, TT and A4 models. Unlike the TT and R8, however, the system will retain the retractable display screen in the dash, allowing passengers to use the system as well.\n\nTwo new connectivity options are available: Audi Connect Prime, which brings remote services like Google Earth, traffic and route guidance info, online travel info, internet radio and Twitter alerts, and the additional Audi Connect Plus that adds 4G LTE Wi-Fi connectivity to the car.\nUnder the HoodThe A3 sedan and A3 Cabriolet are powered by a 220-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine mated to a six-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission, employing Audi’s Quattro all-wheel drive. The smaller 1.8-liter engine and front-wheel-drive combination will be updated later in the year; for the car’s initial launch, only the 2.0T engine and all-wheel-drive combination will be available. The S3 continues on with a more powerful version of this engine, making 292 hp and using the same transmission.\nSafetyAudi has made some updates to the A3’s available electronic safety equipment as well; the automaker’s  radar-based forward collision warning and autonomous braking system is now standard. If a collision is imminent, the system will begin to close the windows and sunroof and pre-tighten the seat belts. In addition to a standard backup camera, Audi offers a full complement of optional safety systems, including active lane keeping assist, front and rear parking sensors, automatic high beams, adaptive full-speed cruise control, blind spot warning and rear cross-traffic alert.",

      "expert_review": "I cannot believe time flies by so quickly. My babies are now in second and fourth grades. Diapers are long gone; preschool is but a brief memory, and there’s not a wisp of baby fat anywhere on their lean bodies. And I can now drive a small car again.\n\nDespite its small size, my whole family enjoyed the 2012 Audi A3 TDI; it was fun to ride in, even more fun to drive and handled most of our stuff.\n\nThe A3 is a small hatchback. The Colorado girl in me would require a ski rack, but all other day-to-day activities were handled with major zip.\n\nThe major zip is courtesy of a 2.0-liter clean diesel engine paired with a S-Tronic dual-clutch automatic transmission. I mention this piece of machinery because it’s amazing. When shifting, there is no lag and no kick — just seamless power. It’s quite addicting.\n\nThe 2012 Audi A3 has a starting MSRP of $27,270 for a gas-powered four-cylinder. My test car, an A3 TDI, starts at $30,250. Add in a navigation system and the Premium Plus, 18-inch Sport and Cold Weather packages (along with a couple other accessories) and my test car’s price zipped to $38,050.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe Audi A3 TDI looks like an itty-bitty wagon. It’s got four doors and a rear hatch, and it’s cute. But watch out, this car is faster than the toddler who you swore was here half a second ago.\n\nThe five-seat A3 is easy to get into and out of for everyone. It should be noted that there are some foot wells in the rear that will take some getting used to. The real hurdle will be for parents of kids who need help getting into their child-safety seats. Your backs may ache and your heads may be bonked due to the A3’s low door height, but keep your eyes on the horizon, my friends. Someday this will be a non-issue, but will you be able to hang in there with the A3 that long?\n\nThe cargo area is easy to access, and the hatch doesn’t go too high so it’s easy to reach when open — even for shorter folks. My son, age 10, actually liked opening and closing the hatch and loading and unloading stuff out of the back because it was so easy for him. The cargo floor’s height is perfect for him to load his own hockey bag in and out of the back. Hallelujah! The less I have to touch that thing, the better, and he only started playing a few months ago.\n\nThe A3 TDI has a turbocharged 2.0-liter diesel four-cylinder engine that makes 140 horsepower and an awe-inspiring 236 pounds-feet of torque. It gets an EPA-estimated 30/42 mpg city/highway.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Groove-On\n\nINTERIOR\nThe A3 TDI’s interior feels like a cockpit because everything is close together, bolstered and dark. It’s not necessarily a bad thing, but it feels more sporty and enclosed than open and airy.\n\nIn the front, the center stack was simple to use, though the Multi Media Interface’s screen looked a little like it was added aftermarket because it was the only item that had polished black plastic. When I looked closely at the stereo system, I noticed there was no CD player. I mourned my advancing age and how technology confounds me; then I tuned in an AM radio station and moved on. Had I wanted to listen to my gadget though, it was easy to do by plugging it in using a USB cord in the glove box.\n\nI liked how all the dials, knobs and switches felt solid and sturdy. The front row’s cupholders were smallish but usable. In the backseat, the cupholders popped out of the end of the armrest. This is not a new configuration from Audi and works fine for older kids, but if you have youngsters these cupholders may cause some frustration and may even get damaged as I’m not sure they would fare well over time in everyday battles.\n\nI had plenty of legroom in the front row, and the kids were surprisingly comfortable in the back. The rear seats were deep, enabling families to be comfortable in the A3 despite its small size. There isn’t an abounding amount of rear legroom, though, so forward-facing child-safety seats are best for this car.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2012 Audi A3 has been named a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. A car must receive the top score of Good in front, side, rear and roof-strength crash tests to earn this safety nod. The A3 hasn’t been crash-tested by the federal government.\n\nA3 has two sets of lower Latch anchors in the second row, and they’re some of the best anchors ever designed. They’re covered by removable plastic clips and sit in a perfect plastic housing — right out there for you to use with ease. That said, rear-facing convertibles and infant seats will be a stretch (or rather, a cram) for most. They will fit, but front seat space will be compromised. My 6-foot-tall husband was not on board with how far forward the seat had to be moved to accommodate the safety seats. I was OK in the driver’s seat, but I am 5 feet 5 inches tall.\n\nStandard safety features in the A3 include front-wheel drive, four-wheel-disc antilock brakes, an electronic stability system with traction control, active front head restraints and six airbags, including curtains for both rows. Rear seat side-impact airbags are optional.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2012 Audi A3 TDI here.",

      "expert_review": "The Audi A3 hatchback is an amalgam of sportiness and practicality. It’s an ideal vehicle for a time when buyers are concerned about gas prices and fuel economy.\n\nThe American market has often been cool toward hatchbacks. The A3 is an attractive combination of athletic handling, versatile cargo space and premium features.\n\nThe A3 is offered only as a five-door hatchback, and prices start at $26,920 for the 2.0-liter turbo. The quattro all-wheel-drive model begins at $30,500. The top model is a 3.2-liter V-6 quattro, and it begins at $36,975.\n\nThe test car was a 2.0-liter quattro model. While all-wheel drive is helpful in slippery conditions, the high-performance tires on 18-inch wheels were not very good during last week’s snow. Forward traction was good, but braking was not. Winter tires would be a worthwhile addition.\n\nThe A3 sits on a 101.5-inch wheelbase, and the overall footprint is fairly small. While the A3 is sized like a compact, it is equipped more like an entry-level luxury car.\n\nThe styling is lean and taut. It carries Audi’s signature corporate nose with a prominent grille that gives it considerable presence. The sloping roofline tapers to a hatch door.\n\nLED front running lights give the car a distinctive signature while the fiber optic rods give the taillights an unusual look.\n\nThe A3’s cabin has numerous design elements that are similar to the TT coupe’s. The one-piece top of the instrument panel is very much like the one in the TT, as are the silver trim rings on the air vents and the climate control knobs.\n\nThe A3’s cabin doesn’t feel small in spite of its fairly modest overall size. The optional panoramic sunroof has two glass panels that make the car feel big. The front panel is a retractable sunroof while the panel over the back seat is fixed.\n\nThe test car’s sport seats fit like a glove and had excellent lateral and under-thigh support.\n\nFor adults, back-seat legroom is snug but adequate. The split rear seat folds to create a surprisingly spacious cargo area considering the overall size of the vehicle.\n\nThe 2.0-liter turbo is a gutsy four-cylinder engine, and its fuel economy, with the automatic transmission, is rated at 21 mpg in the city and 28 on the highway.\n\nFolks interested in high mileage will appreciate the TDI turbo-diesel that will be sold in the first quarter of 2010. It should be capable of 40 mpg on the highway.\n\nThe four-cylinder has 200 horsepower, but its fat torque curve gives it excellent throttle response. The turbo produces considerable torque from 1,800 to 5,000 rpm, and that enables the A3 to step away from a stop with authority. Run the engine to redline in the first couple of gears and its acceleration makes you smile.\n\nAudi has been a leader in utilizing direct fuel injection. Direct injection sends gas into each cylinder via a nozzle rather than through the intake manifold. Combining direct injection with turbocharging was an Audi first.\n\nThe A3 handles very well, particularly when equipped with the optional sport suspension. The test car had the optional 18-inch wheels and adjustable shock absorbers. The body was flat in turns, and the electromechanical power steering provides direct communication with the front wheels.\n\nThe four-wheel, anti-lock disc brakes are firm and powerful, which is reassuring when you’re hurrying down unfamiliar pavement that twists and turns like a snake’s path.\n\nPrice\n\nThe test car’s base price was $30,500. Options included the sport package with adjustable shock absorbers, 18-inch wheels, panoramic sunroof, heated seats and rear-seat airbags. The list price was $37,825.\n\nWarranty\n\nFour years or 50,000 miles.\n\n2009 Audi A3 2.0T\n\nEngine: 2.0-liter, 200-hp 4-cyl.\n\nTransmission: Automatic\n\nAll-wheel drive\n\nWheelbase: 101.5 inches\n\nCurb weight: 3,461 lbs.\n\nBase price: $30,500\n\nAs driven: $37,825\n\nMpg rating: 21 city, 28 hwy.\n\nTo get in touch with Tom Strongman, send e-mail to tom@tomstrongman.com.",

      "expert_review": "I have a pair of really cute jeans from my younger days that I hold onto in the hopes of getting back into them without cutting off circulation to the bottom half of my body. I can get them on, but I pay a price in oxygen and muffin-top. The 2010 Audi A3 TDI is kind of like those jeans. It’s incredibly cute, fun to drive and gets great mileage, but it’s a squeeze for my family of four in a way that makes road trips seem forbidding.\n\nLucky for me, I stayed close to home during my time in the A3, so any squishing was of a short duration. However, the Los Angeles area was hit with torrential rains, flooding and mudslides that week, but the A3 took it all it in stride. This front-wheel-drive hatchback made it through running water, over mud and around rocks without so much as a hiccup, and I was thoroughly impressed. I was also impressed by its price: The A3’s MSRP starts at $29,950; my A3 TDI test car cost $31,275.\n\nPiling wet people, coats and umbrellas into the A3 was less fun. On the one dry day I had in the A3 TDI, I found its responsive handling wasn’t only great at keeping me on wet, nasty roads, but fun to play with on dry ones. There’s none of that old, embarrassing diesel lag in the A3 TDI. Though it doesn’t leap off the starting line, the engine builds power quickly so steep hills or freeway merges are no problem. The ride is firm but not so hard as to be uncomfortable.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe A3 TDI is definitely a cutie. Everywhere I went people commented on it, and I couldn’t stop showing it off. Part of its cuteness is its small size. It crouches low to the ground and hugs the road with a hint of sport that’s endearing rather than impressive. The profile is sleek and not at all boxy, as you might expect from a hatchback.\n\nThe TDI’s 140-horsepower, 2.0-liter inline-four-cylinder diesel engine delivers plenty of power and a surprisingly quiet drive. Its EPA-estimated mileage of 30/42 mpg city/highway is some tasty icing on the cake. Of course, the TDI takes only diesel fuel.\n\nMy sons had no problems getting in and out of this hatchback. The doors opened nice and wide and there’s a flat step-in area for little feet. My boys were able to open and close the doors without any problems or whining. The cargo door opens high enough to walk under without banging my head, but it isn’t out of reach. A grab handle lets you shut the door without getting dirty fingers.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Groove-On\n\nINTERIOR\nInside the A3, its small size is less adorable. While I fit in the driver’s seat just fine, my husband felt claustrophobic every time he got in the car. This was caused by more than seat size; the interior of my test A3 was entirely black, with only a bit of metal to catch the light. It’s very clean and modern, but doesn’t exactly convey a feeling of space.\n\nThere is space for all your stuff, though. There’s a cubby at the bottom of the center stack for cell phones or loose items, and the center console has two levels, with a small upper bin as well as a lower bit containing a 12-volt outlet and MP3 jack. The center stack is pretty self-explanatory, with just enough buttons and dials to get the job done. I had no difficulty switching between the stereo system’s XM Satellite Radio and CD player. The gauges are white on black, with red needles. That red is echoed in the display screens for the audio system and climate control.\n\nIn the backseat, space is also limited, but there’s just enough legroom for adults. My boys and I liked the fold-down armrest with cupholders that pop out of it and a covered storage bin for small items. We enjoyed it less when getting buckled up because it had to be folded away so my guys could see where to buckle.\n\nThe cargo area comes with a removable hard cover that lifts when you open the cargo door. It’s a nice touch because it not only gives some privacy to whatever you’re hauling around, but also keeps the sun off the groceries.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2010 A3 has been named the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s Top Safety Pick. To earn this safety award, a car must score the top rating of Good in front, side-impact, rear and rollover crash tests as well as have a standard electronic stability system.\n\nAudi has some of MotherProof.com’s favorite Latch anchors. They sit under removable plastic covers and are easy to use. Rear-facing infant-safety seat and convertible seats will do well in the A3. However, my son’s booster seat didn’t fare as well. Our booster seat slid over the seat belt receptor, so my little guy struggled with getting buckled every time we got in the car.\n\nThe A3’s standard safety features include antilock brakes with brake assist, traction control and six airbags, including side curtains for both rows. Rear side-impact airbags are available for $350.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2010 A3 TDI here.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe Audi A3 is a premium hatchback that competes with models like the Volvo V50. Front- and all-wheel-drive versions of the five-seat A3 are available in the 2.0T (gas) trim level. A diesel model comes only with front-wheel drive.\n\nNew for 2011\nThere are no significant changes for 2011.\n\nExterior\nThe A3’s single-frame tapered grille dominates the front end. The A3’s profile gets flatter toward the rear, like a coupe. Round wheel arches enhance the A3’s stance. Exterior features include:\n\nStandard 17-inch alloy wheels\nDual exhaust outlets and wraparound taillights\nOptional bi-xenon headlights with LED daytime running lamps\nNew chrome accents\nTwo new wheel designs are available\n\nInterior\nA low seating position couples with a tall, wide center console. The steering wheel is wrapped in leather on all models. Round air vents have aluminum surrounds, and there’s aluminum trim on the door and glove box handles. Wide-opening rear doors are intended to ease entry and exit. The available Open Sky two-section glass sunroof includes separate blinds to keep the interior from overheating and guard against the sun’s glare.

Gas models can have a six-speed manual gearbox or the S tronic automatic with a manual-shift mode and front- or all-wheel drive. The diesel A3 TDI has 140 hp and 236 pounds-feet of torque and comes only with the S tronic automatic and front-wheel drive.\n\nMacPherson strut front suspension\nFour-link independent rear suspension\nElectromechanical steering offers speed-dependent power assistance\nStandard hill-hold assist helps control vehicle on steep grades\nAudi magnetic ride suspension optional\n\nSafety\nRear side-impact airbags are optional.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Audi A3?\n\nThe A3 is Audi's entry-level car and is available as a five-seat sedan or four-seat convertible. The sedan also is offered in performance-oriented S3 guise and in high-performance RS3 trim.\n\nFront-drive A3 models use a 184-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine; all-wheel-drive A3s have 228 hp. The S3 sedan has a 288-hp, turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder and AWD. The AWD RS3’s 2.5-liter five-cylinder generates 394 hp. All versions feature a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. Competitors include the BMW 2 Series and Mercedes-Benz CLA-Class.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2019 Audi A3?\n\nThe Premium trim adds standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. A3 Premium Plus and Prestige trims get standard LED headlights, LED taillights and the Audi phone box with wireless charging and signal booster. Park assist, a new feature that maneuvers the car during parallel and perpendicular parking, is standard on A3 and S3 Prestige sedans. The RS3 adds the Audi phone box as standard.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Audi A3 Are Most Important?\n\nAll-wheel drive has been a hallmark of Audi’s lineup for decades, and it's standard or available on all variants of the A3 line. The compact-size A3 offers a boatload of features found on larger luxury models, including a panoramic moonroof (on sedans), leather upholstery, heated front seats and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Moving up to higher trim levels to get navigation, LED headlights, adaptive cruise control and other features can push the price to more than $45,000.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Audi A3?\n\nGood things do come in small packages, and the A3 line offers a high level of convenience and refinement, along with sprightly performance. However, it’s short on backseat room and, with all-wheel drive, cargo room, and the price climbs quickly with higher trim levels and by adding optional features.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in July 2015 about the 2015 Audi A3 Cabriolet. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2016, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nComfortable, stylish and fun to drive, the new Audi A3 Cabriolet is a fantastic but expensive way to enjoy good weather and good roads.\n\nConvertibles are always entertaining, as the experience of dropping the top and enjoying wind in the hair never fails to amuse driver and passenger alike. Audi has made some fun ones, including this latest model based on the company’s subcompact A3 luxury sedan. The Audi A3 has been sold in Europe since 1996, but the U.S. just got the entry-level sedan last year; only the hatchback had been sold here before.\n\nFor 2015, a convertible joins the lineup, which also includes an S3 performance sedan and the A3 Sportback e-Tron plug-in hybrid wagon. The A3 Cabriolet is Audi’s entry-level convertible, meant to go head-to-head with the BMW 2 Series convertible and not much else. Most four-seat luxury convertibles are larger and more expensive than the A3 Cabrio, meaning they compete more with Audi’s A5 Cabrio.\n\nIn the case of the A3, entry-level doesn’t mean inexpensive. So is the A3 Cabrio an open-air bargain, or a little too rich for its position?\n\nExterior & Styling\nAudi styling has a fairly well-established method: Take a shape and size it to fit whatever category is required. The A3 looks like the A4, which looks like the A6, which looks like the A8, etc. If you like the look, you’ll like pretty much the whole lineup.\n\nThe A3 Cabrio looks good without its roof; it’s a stubby little two-door droptop with clean lines, sharp angles up front and the requisite LED adornment for lighting. It looks good with the top up, as well, with Audi’s signature sweeping roofline kept intact over the power-folding vinyl soft-top.\n\nIt’s also, by default, the only two-door A3 offered in the U.S. (a two-door hatchback is offered in Europe), so if you’re looking for coupe style at the inexpensive end of the American Audi lineup, this is it. It’s considerably more sedate than the BMW 228i convertible, however. Its obvious front-wheel-drive architecture creates a short-hood, long-rear layout that differs from the rear-wheel-drive BMW’s long-hood, short-trunk aesthetic. The Audi is simple, yet attractive: not likely to gather many gawkers, but pleasing to behold.\n\nHow It Drives\nTwo powertrains are offered for the A3 Cabrio: a 170-horsepower, turbocharged 1.8-liter four-cylinder for front-wheel-drive models, and a 220-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder paired with Quattro all-wheel drive. Both cars get a standard six-speed, dual-clutch automatic transmission; a manual transmission is not offered. My test car came equipped with the more expensive 2.0-liter engine and all-wheel drive, making the convertible extremely enjoyable. It had quick acceleration and effortless passing power, yet a snorty exhaust note that’s well-matched for roofless motoring.\n\nAs in other Audis, the A3 Cabrio features a selectable-mode button that allows the driver to switch between Comfort and Sport settings. In the A3, it adjusts only throttle input, the transmission shift pattern and steering effort; an adjustable suspension isn’t offered in the A3. Keeping it in Sport mode does make the car more responsive, but it will kill your fuel economy, as it keeps the transmission in lower gears during highway cruising for better accelerator response.\n\nThe A3 Cabrio’s structure is suitably rigid, meaning there isn’t much body or panel shake and flex when going over bumps — something that often plagues convertibles. But every now and then, if you hit a bump just right, the dash and windshield reverberate with an unnerving, resounding, gunshot-like crack that’ll have you checking the glass for damage.\n\nCompared with the BMW 228i convertible, however — which I was fortunate enough to drive back-to-back with the A3 Cabrio — the Audi feels like a mall-walker to the BMW’s track-sprinter. The BMW feels quicker thanks to its more powerful 240-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder and eight-speed automatic transmission. The BMW engine is so well-tuned and sounds so fantastic you’d swear you were driving a straight-six. Its chassis feels much more athletic than the A3’s, the steering provides far more feedback, and the overall experience is obviously tuned more toward “sport” than “luxury.”  This isn’t to say the BMW is better; it’s merely aimed at a different buyer than the A3 — one who wants perhaps a larger measure of performance than of isolation.\n\nThe A3 Cabrio is a fuel-economy champ, rated 24/35/28 mpg city/highway/combined for the 1.8-liter, front-wheel-drive model; the 2.0-liter Quattro is rated 23/32/26 mpg. My long highway trip from Ann Arbor, Mich., to Elkhart Lake, Wis. — by way of a weekend in Chicago traffic — returned a highly respectable 29 mpg, even with the top down for about half the trip. The BMW 228i convertible is rated 23/34/27 mpg with rear-wheel drive and 22/33/26 mpg for the xDrive all-wheel-drive version, just a tick behind the lighter A3 Cabrio.\n\nInterior\nWhere the A3 beats the 228i is on interior appointments and space. The A3 feels exceptionally wide and spacious inside, with comfortable seats that provide plenty of support for long-distance motoring. I drove the A3 Cabrio nearly a thousand miles over the span of a week and found its cabin to be an extremely enjoyable place to be. The seats are sufficiently adjustable and supportive, and their positioning relative to the belt line of the car made putting my arm up on the sill a natural position.\n\nOutward visibility is surprisingly good with the top up, as the large side windows and roll-down rear quarter windows eliminate blind spots. The top’s pillars aren’t thick enough to impede rear visibility that much.\n\nThe noise level with the top up is similarly good, but some wind and traffic noise enters the cabin through the rear. The front and side glass is thick and insulating, but pull up next to a semi-truck on the highway and you’ll hear it quite well — as if it were coming from speakers in the backseat.\n\nBackseat room is tight. It’s even tighter than in the already-cramped A3 sedan, thanks to a repositioned seat that eliminates 3.2 inches of legroom and 7.3 inches of shoulder room in order to accommodate the folding top.\n\nBy comparison, the BMW 228i convertible feels much more cramped, both up front and in back. The interior volume specs don’t seem that different, but sitting in both reveals some interior styling elements that give the Audi a wider, more comfortable cabin. Part of it may be the BMW’s rear-wheel-drive layout, requiring a larger transmission tunnel through the cabin. The Audi also feels more upscale, with richer materials and a less cluttered design.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe A3 features Audi’s Multi Media Interface multifunction controller knob, located on the center console where your hand naturally falls. It’s still one of the best systems on the market — among luxury and non-luxury brands. It’s easy to learn, easy to use and doesn’t require you to take your eyes off the road for very long.\n\nMy test car didn’t feature the premium audio system but still produced some excellent tunes that could be heard even with the top down at highway speeds. There were quite a lot of dead switches and panels in my test car, however, indicating options not selected — a situation that always looks cheap to me. It’s like the car is constantly chiding the owner for not having ponied up for a better-equipped version. The fact that this A3 Cabrio was highly equipped and very expensive, though, makes me think these are switch blanks for options available only in other styles of the A3. It still looks sketchy.\n\nThe BMW doesn’t have this affliction, but its interior switches, controls and multimedia system aren’t quite as user-friendly as Audi’s are. Its buttons feel smaller, its systems aren’t as intuitive and operation on the fly isn’t as easy.\n\nCargo & Storage\nNeither the Audi nor the BMW offer much in the way of trunk space to begin with, seeing as these are subcompact cars. Add in a folding top, and there’s even less room. The A3 convertibles feature a paltry 9.9 cubic feet of cargo room (the sedan has 12.3 cubic feet), but that gets cut even more if you want to drop the top. A special divider must be put in place that protects the top’s space in the trunk; if you don’t have it in place, the top won’t go down. Still, I was able to stuff a decent amount of soft-sided luggage and a small roll-aboard bag into the A3 Cabrio’s trunk for a long weekend. The BMW 228i convertible features a lot more room, at 11.8 cubic feet of space.\n\nSafety\nThe A3 Cabrio has not been crash-tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.\n\nThe A3 has some safety equipment, but not much of it is standard beyond the basic airbags and antilock brakes. A backup camera and parking sensor system is extra, as is lane departure warning, active cruise control, forward collision warning and lane keep assist. See all the A3 Cabrio’s standard equipment here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe A3 Cabrio may be Audi’s least-expensive convertible, but that doesn’t mean it’s inexpensive. The starting price is $36,495 (all prices include destination) for a 1.8-liter, front-wheel-drive Cabriolet, but like most German luxury cars that price doesn’t come with a whole lot of extras.\n\nMy test car was equipped with the bigger, 2.0-liter engine and Quattro all-wheel drive; that version starts at $39,495. Adding the navigation package, the Premium Plus Package (with its 18-inch wheels, heated seats and mirrors, and aluminum trim) and the Sport Package (with its reshaped sport seats, sport suspension and Audi drive-select modes) brought the total up to a cringe-worthy $45,475.\n\nNote that at this price, there still aren’t any advanced safety features — like blind spot warning or even a backup camera — nor do you get a premium audio system or Audi Connect concierge. To get those features, keep spending: you’ll need the Prestige Package and the Advanced Technology Package, and your A3 Cabrio could end up costing almost $51,000. For less money, you can get a larger Audi A5 Cabrio. Build one to your specs here.\n\nBMW’s 2 Series convertible isn’t any less expensive, however. The base 228i convertible starts at $38,850 but outguns the A3 with a much more powerful engine and two more gears in its transmission. Opt for all-wheel drive, and your 228i xDrive starts at $40,650. Like the Audi, this doesn’t include a lot of standard equipment — like a backup camera, premium audio, real leather or even power seats. Load up the 228i, and you’re looking at a subcompact costing more than $56,000.\n\nThere are certainly less expensive convertibles, including some compelling options, such as a Ford Mustang EcoBoost convertible with a turbocharged four-cylinder engine, which starts at $35,625. Even fully loaded — with enough sport package equipment to run circles around the A3 — it won’t top $47,000.\n\nA Japanese luxury equivalent might be the Lexus IS 250C, a convertible based on the last-generation IS sedan and still soldiering on as Lexus’ only convertible model. It’s a bit larger than the A3, sporting a 5-inch-longer wheelbase, but that only translates into a little more legroom for front occupants. The rest of the dimensions are comparable to the A3 or smaller, with cargo capacity especially deficient. The Lexus sports a weak V-6 engine instead of the turbo-fours in competitors and has a higher sticker price — $44,285. See all four competitors here.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Comfortable, stylish and fun to drive, the new Audi A3 Cabriolet is a fantastic but expensive way to enjoy good weather and good roads.\n\nConvertibles are always entertaining, as the experience of dropping the top and enjoying wind in the hair never fails to amuse driver and passenger alike. Audi has made some fun ones, including this latest model based on the company’s subcompact A3 luxury sedan. The Audi A3 has been sold in Europe since 1996, but the U.S. just got the entry-level sedan last year; only the hatchback had been sold here before.\n\nFor 2015, a convertible joins the lineup, which also includes an S3 performance sedan and the A3 Sportback e-Tron plug-in hybrid wagon. The A3 Cabriolet is Audi’s entry-level convertible, meant to go head-to-head with the BMW 2 Series convertible and not much else. Most four-seat luxury convertibles are larger and more expensive than the A3 Cabrio, meaning they compete more with Audi’s A5 Cabrio.\n\nIn the case of the A3, entry-level doesn’t mean inexpensive. So is the A3 Cabrio an open-air bargain, or a little too rich for its position?\n\nExterior & Styling\nAudi styling has a fairly well-established method: Take a shape and size it to fit whatever category is required. The A3 looks like the A4, which looks like the A6, which looks like the A8, etc. If you like the look, you’ll like pretty much the whole lineup.\n\nThe A3 Cabrio looks good without its roof; it’s a stubby little two-door droptop with clean lines, sharp angles up front and the requisite LED adornment for lighting. It looks good with the top up, as well, with Audi’s signature sweeping roofline kept intact over the power-folding vinyl soft-top.\n\nIt’s also, by default, the only two-door A3 offered in the U.S. (a two-door hatchback is offered in Europe), so if you’re looking for coupe style at the inexpensive end of the American Audi lineup, this is it. It’s considerably more sedate than the BMW 228i convertible, however. Its obvious front-wheel-drive architecture creates a short-hood, long-rear layout that differs from the rear-wheel-drive BMW’s long-hood, short-trunk aesthetic. The Audi is simple, yet attractive: not likely to gather many gawkers, but pleasing to behold.\n\nHow It Drives\nTwo powertrains are offered for the A3 Cabrio: a 170-horsepower, turbocharged 1.8-liter four-cylinder for front-wheel-drive models, and a 220-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder paired with Quattro all-wheel drive. Both cars get a standard six-speed, dual-clutch automatic transmission; a manual transmission is not offered. My test car came equipped with the more expensive 2.0-liter engine and all-wheel drive, making the convertible extremely enjoyable. It had quick acceleration and effortless passing power, yet a snorty exhaust note that’s well-matched for roofless motoring.\n\nAs in other Audis, the A3 Cabrio features a selectable-mode button that allows the driver to switch between Comfort and Sport settings. In the A3, it adjusts only throttle input, the transmission shift pattern and steering effort; an adjustable suspension isn’t offered in the A3. Keeping it in Sport mode does make the car more responsive, but it will kill your fuel economy, as it keeps the transmission in lower gears during highway cruising for better accelerator response.\n\nThe A3 Cabrio’s structure is suitably rigid, meaning there isn’t much body or panel shake and flex when going over bumps — something that often plagues convertibles. But every now and then, if you hit a bump just right, the dash and windshield reverberate with an unnerving, resounding, gunshot-like crack that’ll have you checking the glass for damage.\n\nCompared with the BMW 228i convertible, however — which I was fortunate enough to drive back-to-back with the A3 Cabrio — the Audi feels like a mall-walker to the BMW’s track-sprinter. The BMW feels quicker thanks to its more powerful 240-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder and eight-speed automatic transmission. The BMW engine is so well-tuned and sounds so fantastic you’d swear you were driving a straight-six. Its chassis feels much more athletic than the A3’s, the steering provides far more feedback, and the overall experience is obviously tuned more toward “sport” than “luxury.”  This isn’t to say the BMW is better; it’s merely aimed at a different buyer than the A3 — one who wants perhaps a larger measure of performance than of isolation.\n\nThe A3 Cabrio is a fuel-economy champ, rated 24/35/28 mpg city/highway/combined for the 1.8-liter, front-wheel-drive model; the 2.0-liter Quattro is rated 23/32/26 mpg. My long highway trip from Ann Arbor, Mich., to Elkhart Lake, Wis. — by way of a weekend in Chicago traffic — returned a highly respectable 29 mpg, even with the top down for about half the trip. The BMW 228i convertible is rated 23/34/27 mpg with rear-wheel drive and 22/33/26 mpg for the xDrive all-wheel-drive version, just a tick behind the lighter A3 Cabrio.\n\nInterior\nWhere the A3 beats the 228i is on interior appointments and space. The A3 feels exceptionally wide and spacious inside, with comfortable seats that provide plenty of support for long-distance motoring. I drove the A3 Cabrio nearly a thousand miles over the span of a week and found its cabin to be an extremely enjoyable place to be. The seats are sufficiently adjustable and supportive, and their positioning relative to the belt line of the car made putting my arm up on the sill a natural position.\n\nOutward visibility is surprisingly good with the top up, as the large side windows and roll-down rear quarter windows eliminate blind spots. The top’s pillars aren’t thick enough to impede rear visibility that much.\n\nThe noise level with the top up is similarly good, but some wind and traffic noise enters the cabin through the rear. The front and side glass is thick and insulating, but pull up next to a semi-truck on the highway and you’ll hear it quite well — as if it were coming from speakers in the backseat.\n\nBackseat room is tight. It’s even tighter than in the already-cramped A3 sedan, thanks to a repositioned seat that eliminates 3.2 inches of legroom and 7.3 inches of shoulder room in order to accommodate the folding top.\n\nBy comparison, the BMW 228i convertible feels much more cramped, both up front and in back. The interior volume specs don’t seem that different, but sitting in both reveals some interior styling elements that give the Audi a wider, more comfortable cabin. Part of it may be the BMW’s rear-wheel-drive layout, requiring a larger transmission tunnel through the cabin. The Audi also feels more upscale, with richer materials and a less cluttered design.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe A3 features Audi’s Multi Media Interface multifunction controller knob, located on the center console where your hand naturally falls. It’s still one of the best systems on the market — among luxury and non-luxury brands. It’s easy to learn, easy to use and doesn’t require you to take your eyes off the road for very long.\n\nMy test car didn’t feature the premium audio system but still produced some excellent tunes that could be heard even with the top down at highway speeds. There were quite a lot of dead switches and panels in my test car, however, indicating options not selected — a situation that always looks cheap to me. It’s like the car is constantly chiding the owner for not having ponied up for a better-equipped version. The fact that this A3 Cabrio was highly equipped and very expensive, though, makes me think these are switch blanks for options available only in other styles of the A3. It still looks sketchy.\n\nThe BMW doesn’t have this affliction, but its interior switches, controls and multimedia system aren’t quite as user-friendly as Audi’s are. Its buttons feel smaller, its systems aren’t as intuitive and operation on the fly isn’t as easy.\n\nCargo & Storage\nNeither the Audi nor the BMW offer much in the way of trunk space to begin with, seeing as these are subcompact cars. Add in a folding top, and there’s even less room. The A3 convertibles feature a paltry 9.9 cubic feet of cargo room (the sedan has 12.3 cubic feet), but that gets cut even more if you want to drop the top. A special divider must be put in place that protects the top’s space in the trunk; if you don’t have it in place, the top won’t go down. Still, I was able to stuff a decent amount of soft-sided luggage and a small roll-aboard bag into the A3 Cabrio’s trunk for a long weekend. The BMW 228i convertible features a lot more room, at 11.8 cubic feet of space.\n\nSafety\nThe A3 Cabrio has not been crash-tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.\n\nThe A3 has some safety equipment, but not much of it is standard beyond the basic airbags and antilock brakes. A backup camera and parking sensor system is extra, as is lane departure warning, active cruise control, forward collision warning and lane keep assist. See all the A3 Cabrio’s standard equipment here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe A3 Cabrio may be Audi’s least-expensive convertible, but that doesn’t mean it’s inexpensive. The starting price is $36,495 (all prices include destination) for a 1.8-liter, front-wheel-drive Cabriolet, but like most German luxury cars that price doesn’t come with a whole lot of extras.\n\nMy test car was equipped with the bigger, 2.0-liter engine and Quattro all-wheel drive; that version starts at $39,495. Adding the navigation package, the Premium Plus Package (with its 18-inch wheels, heated seats and mirrors, and aluminum trim) and the Sport Package (with its reshaped sport seats, sport suspension and Audi drive-select modes) brought the total up to a cringe-worthy $45,475.\n\nNote that at this price, there still aren’t any advanced safety features — like blind spot warning or even a backup camera — nor do you get a premium audio system or Audi Connect concierge. To get those features, keep spending: you’ll need the Prestige Package and the Advanced Technology Package, and your A3 Cabrio could end up costing almost $51,000. For less money, you can get a larger Audi A5 Cabrio.\n\nBMW’s 2 Series convertible isn’t any less expensive, however. The base 228i convertible starts at $38,850 but outguns the A3 with a much more powerful engine and two more gears in its transmission. Opt for all-wheel drive, and your 228i xDrive starts at $40,650. Like the Audi, this doesn’t include a lot of standard equipment — like a backup camera, premium audio, real leather or even power seats. Load up the 228i, and you’re looking at a subcompact costing more than $56,000.\n\nThere are certainly less expensive convertibles, including some compelling options, such as a Ford Mustang EcoBoost convertible with a turbocharged four-cylinder engine, which starts at $35,625. Even fully loaded — with enough sport package equipment to run circles around the A3 — it won’t top $47,000.\n\nA Japanese luxury equivalent might be the Lexus IS 250C, a convertible based on the last-generation IS sedan and still soldiering on as Lexus’ only convertible model. It’s a bit larger than the A3, sporting a 5-inch-longer wheelbase, but that only translates into a little more legroom for front occupants. The rest of the dimensions are comparable to the A3 or smaller, with cargo capacity especially deficient. The Lexus sports a weak V-6 engine instead of the turbo-fours in competitors and has a higher sticker price — $44,285. See all four competitors here.\n\nemail",
