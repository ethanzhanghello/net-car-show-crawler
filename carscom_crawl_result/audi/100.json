      "expert_review": "When the Audi 100 S station wagon arrived in the driveway, Twin No. 1 ran to the garage and brought back a 5-gallon jug.\n\n“If you are going to drive that car for any length of time you’ll be needing this,” she said, handing us a potion with a haunting aroma that quickly brought back memories of high school biology class.\n\n“Formaldehyde?”\n\n“And please park down the block,” she begged.\n\nTeenagers don’t always fully appreciate function over form, practicality over performance.\n\nUntil this year Audi offered only an all-wheel drive, or Quattro, wagon aimed at providing road-holding security for those who have to venture onto highways in slime and slop. But since the Quattro carries a $47,020 price tag,the automaker chose to come out with a less expensive front-wheel-drive 100 S wagon companion for the Quattro for 1994. The 100 S has a little less pavement-hugging capability but a window sticker that starts at $38,070.\n\nOf course, anyone with $38,000-$47,000 burning a hole in pocket or purse who opts for a station wagon doesn’t have both oars in the water to begin with. But the act of kindness by Audi to save these people $9,000 is admirablenonetheless.\n\nThe 100 S wagon is functional and practical. It has two rows of seats thathold five adults, plus a fold-down, rear-facing jump seat to accommodate a couple of kids. Since it is a wagon, you can load it with many people, or a few people and a lot of luggage, and/or groceries and/or golf clubs, so as notto mess up your regular Audi sedan or coupe on weekend ventures.\n\nThe wagon is equipped with dual air bags and four-wheel antilock brakes, but doesn’t offer traction control.\n\nThe wagon is powered buy a 2.8-liter, 172-horsepower V-6 teamed with 4-speed automatic and rated at 18 miles per gallon city/23 highway. Audi says the 2.8 V-6 was designed specifically for low-end pulling power to tote a vehicle full of folks and their supplies from the light without strain. We found, however, that the V-6 had a tendency to hesitate a fraction of a secondbefore breaking into a trot when the gas pedal is pressed hard. The wagon’s 3,600-pound curb weight was a factor. Speed-sensitive power steering helps make that poundage feel less heavy.\n\nWhile Audi can be proud of equipping the wagon for safety, there was one design flaw that defeated its intentions-high-mounted head restraints at all four main seating stations that partially blocked rear and side vision. Slimmer head rests are needed.\n\nOne neat feature, however, is the power sunroof. Rather than push and hold a button as you wait for the top to motor back as far as desired, you simply twist a switch to one of several settings, let go, and the top motors on its own until it stops at the pre-programmed distance. It keeps your hands on the wheel where they belong. To close the top you simply turn the switch and let go, and it closes tight.\n\nCloth seats are preferred over leat her because they’re cooler in the summerand warmer in the winter. If you get the optional weather package ($480), the seats can be heated by flicking a switch. Door locks and window-washer nozzlesalso are heated.\n\nOur test vehicle was based at $38,070. The weather package added $480, the Bose sound system $600. Freight is $445.\n\nStandard equipment includes chlorofluorocarbon-free air conditioning, tinted glass, electric rear-window defogger, cruise control, power brakes/steering/windows/door locks/driver’s seat and mirrors (with defogger), 15-inch all-season tires, galvanized sheet metal, bodyside moldings, 5 m.p.h. bumpers, leather-wrapped tilt and telescoping steering wheel, trip odometer, outside temperature gauge, illuminated vanity mirrors, retained accessory power so you can open/close windows/sunroof after you turn off the ignition key and carpeted floor mats.\n\nAudi also provides three-year/50,000-mile no-charge scheduled maintenance, three-year/50,000 -mile limited warranty, 10-year limited warranty against corrosion perforation and three-year roadside assistance.",

      "expert_review": "Audi could become habit forming.\n\nThe company once known for stiff, harsh, unpredictable cars best suited for high-speed driving on the autobahn rather than any U.S. street, road, expressway, toll road or interstate, is making a sweeping comeback in this country.\n\nFirst it was the Audi 100CS (Cartalk, Dec. 29, 1991), then the Audi V-8 Quattro sedan (Cartalk, July 5). And now comes the 100CS again, but this time with automatic transmission rather than the smooth-shifting five-speed manual, as well as the S4 sedan, a vehicle Audi refers to as the “spiritual successor“ to the 200 Quattro.\n\nFor years Audi was designed and built for European roadways. The focus was on speed to keep up with the Mercedes and Jaguars that may try to pass on the way to wine country.\n\nIts new performance machines still are fast, but now they are comfortable, too. It`s one thing to build a vehicle that can travel from Hamburg to Munich at 130 miles per hour; it`s quite another to build one to take you from Rolling Meadows to Chicago or Evanston to Milwaukee, trips on which you might get up to 65 m.p.h. before the orange and black signs issue the April-through-October Chicagoland advisory: Road construction ahead.\n\nThe automatic doesn`t seem to rob the 2.8-liter, 172-horsepower 6- cylinder engine in the 100CS of any power. Audi had been known for delivering the power burst after you passed cruising speed, all the better for rocketing down the autobahn. Americans preferred livelier movement off the line, away from the light, down the merger ramp or into/out of the passing lane. With the 100CS, Audi focused on 0 to 60 m.p.h. rather than 60 to 120.\n\nThe 2.8 is rated at 17 miles per gallon city/25 m.p.g. highway with automatic (an $800 option) versus 19/26 with five-speed.\n\nRegardless of transmission, the 100CS sports new sheet metal for 1992, while retaining those four locked rings in the grille and on the deck lid as evidence of its heritage. With the styling change came new dimensions, with wheelbase extended to 105.8 inches from 105.6 inches and overall length nipped to 192.6 inches from 192.7 inches.\n\nThough you`d need a micrometer to measure the changes in physical size, you can feel the difference Audi pulled off by increasing front track-the distance between the two front tires-by two inches and rear track by one inch. That means you can be more aggressive in corners and turns without wiggle or wobble.\n\nA stiffer body, front and rear stabilizer bars, fully independent front suspension, speed-sensitive power steering and all-season steel-belted, 15- inch radial tires also contribute to precise handling, while enlarged power disc brakes with anti-lock contribute to precise stopping. An added plus is the standard driver-side air bag.\n\nA trio of items we enjoyed included the infrared setting on the key fob, so you need only press the button to lock or unlock the doors; an automatic mirror adjustment, so whenever you shift into reverse the right outside mirror tilts down for a better view of the curb, meaning you can avoid scrapping tires against concrete (it tilts up again once you`ve engaged a forward gear); and the power sunroof in which you simply twist a dial in the overhead console and the roof opens/closes to a pre-set space without you having to hold your hand on the knob.\n\nStandard equipment includes climate control, Bose AM-FM stereo, pre- wiring for a phone, tilt and telescoping steering column, power seats, power door locks, child safety rear door locks, power mirrors with electric defoggers, electric remote trunk lid release, illuminated driver and passenger visor mirrors, tinted glass, power windows with driver`s express down, rear- window defogger and cruise control.\n\nA cold weather package that includes heated front seats, heated windshield washer nozzles and door locks and headlight washers is standard with the CS.\n\nBase price of the 100CS is $34,400.\n\nThe full-time all-wheel-drive S4 sedan is a somewhat different breed, as you`d expect from a “spiritual successor.“\n\nBuilt on basically the same platform as the 100CS, there`s a little less coddling or cuddling from the S4. The 2.2-liter, 227-h.p., 20-valve turbocharged 5-cylinder engine is meant for performance, though the turbo kicks in before you notice being nudged back into the bucket seat off the line.\n\nThe 2.2 claims a 0-to-60-m.p.h. time of 6.6 seconds and a top speed of 130 m.p.h. (European versions claim a top speed of 150 m.p.h.), yet an 18 m.p.g. city/23 m.p.g. highway mileage rating.\n\nThe S4 comes only with a five-speed manual. Whereas European five-speeds often are a bit stiff and balky, the S4`s is exceptionally smooth. It`s an attempt to win anyone who might be considering a BMW, which along with Audi is one of the few automakers that still caters to those willing to pay roughly $40,000 for a car and shift for themselves.\n\nIt`s not difficult to distinguish the S4 considering the badges on the grille and deck lid and the flared fenders. What you don`t see, but learn to appreciate, is the sports suspension, complemented by 16-inch tires, speed- sensitive rack-and-pinion steering and power anti-lock brakes.\n\nThe major complaint we have with the car is excessive stiffness in the driver`s seat back. For some reason, automakers have a mind-set that anyone interested in performance prefers sitting on concrete.\n\nAnother item we didn`t like were the Nissan Maxima-like black numerals on white background gauges that turn to orange numerals on black background at night. The white looks unfinished. And the placement of the phone in the center armrest was annoying. The armrest/phone holder is so far back you have to fiddle around to reach it. Some motorists we`ve encountered on the road can`t dial a phone and chew gum at the same time. Making those same people hunt for the phone doesn`t help.\n\nStandard equipment includes gauge cluster with tachometer, electronic speedometer, fuel and coolant temperature gauges and oil pressure and oil temperature gauges; analog clock; leather upholstery; driver-side air bag, hands-free cellular phone with voice recognition activation; heated front and rear seats; electronic climate control; expandable ski/storage sack; infrared locking system; tilt and telescopic steering column; power front seats; tilt and slide power sunroof; cruise control; power windows; power locks; dual power mirrors; heated windshield washer nozzles; and Blaupunkt AM/FM cassette with a Bose sound system.\n\nSo you can enjoy your car for a long time, the sheet metal is two-sided galvanized and the body is sealed with polyvinyl chloride; the lower body cavities are filled with hot wax; and lower body panels are covered with stone/chip resistant coating.\n\nBase price is $43,750.",
