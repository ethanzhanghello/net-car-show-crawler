      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Audi A3?\n\nThe A3 is Audi’s smallest and least expensive sedan, but you might not know it from behind the wheel. This little Audi four-door is fun to drive, with sharp steering and an eager 201-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder gas engine that pairs with a 48-volt mild-hybrid system. Front-wheel drive and a seven-speed automatic transmission are standard, with all-wheel drive optional; it’s standard on the zestier 306-hp S3 version. If you want even more thrills from Audi’s petite sedan, the RS 3 version boasts a 410-hp, turbocharged 2.5-liter five-cylinder that rockets from 0-60 mph in roughly 3.6 seconds. Competitors of the A3/S3/RS 3 include the Acura Integra, BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe, Cadillac CT4 and Genesis G70. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Audi A3?\n\nA3 models equipped with the Black Optic Sport Package get a new 18-inch wheel design, while the available Convenience Package adds HomeLink functionality integrated into the rearview mirror. The S3 gets carbon-look interior trim in place of the faux aluminum used previously, and Nappa leather seating is newly available on Premium Plus and Prestige trims. RS 3 models also get the carbon treatment inside, along with red stitching in place of green in models equipped with the RS Design Package. \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Audi A3 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n10.1-inch touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nTri-zone climate control\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nRain-sensing wipers\nLeather seating surfaces\nPanoramic moonroof\nHeated front seats\nPower-adjustable front seats\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nWireless smartphone charging\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nSatellite radio\nNavigation\n12.3-inch Virtual Cockpit digital gauge cluster\nHead-up instrument display\nSport exhaust system\nShould I Buy the 2024 Audi A3?\n\nThe Audi A3 is a small, well-rounded luxury sedan that’s a zippy little runabout — or a pint-sized performance monster if you opt for the RS 3. Keep in mind, though, that version carries a hefty asking price of around $62,000. Space up front is decent, and the dash design is attractive. Adults, however, won’t want to be relegated to the backseat for extended voyages. The trunk is also modest, though many car shoppers will appreciate the A3’s city-friendly proportions — and the entry-level model’s fuel-sipping nature.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: With 401 horsepower and a trick all-wheel-drive system, the 2023 Audi RS 3 compact performance sedan drives with an exceeding amount of vigor and excitement.\n\nVersus the competition: The Audi RS 3 is a little rough around the edges, but its performance chops are undeniable and its brutish behavior is part of its appeal.\n\nAudi redesigned the RS 3 for the 2022 model year, bringing it leaps ahead by modernizing the sedan’s interior with new technology and styling. A new all-wheel-drive system changes the way the RS 3 behaves in spirited driving, and under the hood is a turbocharged 2.5-liter five-cylinder engine that got only a slight power boost, yet remains a highlight of the RS 3 experience.\n\nAhead of this review, I hadn’t driven a 2017-20 RS 3, so a friend offered to let me drive his 2018 RS 3. To be honest, there wasn’t much I could responsibly glean comparing the driving experience of that car — with 60,000 miles and light modifications — to that of the new RS 3, but one thing was clear where the interior was concerned: The new RS 3 doesn’t feel like a single-generation jump over the 2018; it’s more like two. I drove a 2022 RS 3 for this review, but little has changed for 2023 (see the two model years compared).\n\nRelated: 2023 Audi A3, S3, RS 3 Enter New Year With Minimal Updates, New Base Price\n\nSimilar Power, Very Different All-Wheel Drive\n2022 Audi RS 3 | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nI was most impressed by the RS 3 when diving into corners. The new RS 3’s torque-splitting rear axle overdrives the outside rear wheel in order to more eagerly point the car’s nose in the direction of the corner. This makes the RS 3 light on its feet and eager to round a bend, even if the light-effort steering doesn’t offer much confidence. (It doesn’t do a good job communicating what’s happening with the front tires’ grip.)\n\nI didn’t fully experience the effect of the RS 3’s torque-splitting rear axle in a track setting, but the RS Torque Rear driving mode takes the torque that’s sent to the rear (up to 50%) and directs up to 100% of it to the outside wheel in a turn for tail-sliding drift fun. In this mode, the RS 3 reminded me of a Subaru BRZ or Toyota GR86, where a generous throttle blip at low speeds can bring the rear end out in a very controlled manner. It was impressive for an AWD sedan that weighs around 800 pounds more than those rear-wheel-drive coupes.\n\nThe RS 3 is also more raw and raucous than many of the modern sports cars that are derived from luxury cars. Many of these luxury sports cars block lively engine and powertrain noises for the sake of passenger comfort, but that’s not the case in the RS 3: The auditory feedback of engine, wind and tire noise connects you to the driving experience. Audi says the RS 3 accelerates from 0-60 mph in 3.6 seconds, and you’ll feel — and hear — the rush of acceleration via the engine’s whooshes and whistles; the RS 3 gives you a sense of its speed by the sounds it makes.\n\n2022 Audi RS 3 | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nOne thing that could be louder, however, is the available $1,000 sport exhaust. Even at full song, it’s muted for what I’d expect from a performance exhaust. The Porsche 911’s and Chevrolet Corvette’s optional exhaust uncork much more volume, and even the Hyundai Elantra N has an angry-sounding, burbly exhaust note. The RS 3 has a pleasant, signature sound coming from its pipes, but for my tastes — and a cool grand — I’d like an extra few decibels of exhaust sound from that smooth five-cylinder.\n\nWhat was also lively was how the redesigned RS 3 tracked at highway speeds; it kept me on my toes as it darted and followed grooves and imperfections in the road. Factory-recommended cold tire pressure for the Bridgestone Potenza Sport summer tires on my test car was 44 psi in the front and 36 psi in the back, but I dropped the fronts to 39 psi to see if it made a difference with tracking — as well as hopefully lessen the harsh impacts on bumps — and it did. This was below the front tires’ recommended pressure, but it resulted in the car no longer darting at highway speeds or crashing over road imperfections.\n\nOld RS 3 Vs. New RS 3\n\nThe new car’s interior is a substantial upgrade over the previous RS 3, with a more upscale feel from aluminized trim that stretches the width of the dashboard, plus a modernized control layout and a now-standard 12.3-inch digital instrument panel. Perhaps the biggest change is the center touchscreen, which is now integrated into the dashboard; the previous RS 3 had a seriously old-school-Audi retractable screen. The new screen isn’t distracting like the old one, which was propped on top of the dashboard, and it offers increased definition and more features. The previous RS 3 included controls, switches and dials that were reminiscent of Audis all the way back to the mid-2000s, so the new setup is a marked improvement.\n\nThe 2018 RS 3 I drove had all-season tires and smaller-than-factory 18-inch-diameter wheels. My 2022 test car had summer rubber and 19-inch wheels, so making handling comparisons between the two is difficult. The 2018 RS 3 also had minor engine intake and exhaust modifications, but the powertrain programming was untouched. The greatest difference I observed was how much more responsive and snappy the redesigned RS 3 felt compared with the 2018 version; throttle response is heightened, and automatic downshifts from the seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission are more eager.\n\nBoth cars exhibited inconsistent shift speed and firmness when using the steering-wheel-mounted shift paddles. Even in their most heightened sport drive modes, both the 2018 and 2022 RS 3 sometimes suffered a lazy delay between hitting the shift paddle and the shift actually taking place, yet at other times they would snap into the next gear right away. The inconsistency was a turnoff compared with the always responsive dual-clutch experience in a 2020-or-newer Corvette or any modern Porsche, or even compared with a non-dual-clutch transmission like the BMW M340i’s conventional (yet exceptional) eight-speed automatic. The RS 3’s transmission also reminded me why I so enjoy performance electric vehicles like the Tesla Model 3: There’s no step-gear transmission to muck up the experience, so any press of the accelerator results in near-instant acceleration.\n\nInterior Quality and Roominess\n\nWhile there’s a clear leap in quality on the inside versus the old RS 3, you won’t find the kind of richness in padding and materials that you would in a BMW M340i, Genesis G70 or Audi S4. These cars are a class up in terms of size and interior appointments versus the A3, upon which the RS 3 is based, and that’s simply something owners will have to exchange for the RS 3’s unique performance.\n\nThe multimedia and control systems function via a touch-sensitive volume knob and a track-changing button on the center console that works decently in place of a physical dial. I like that the motion is similar to a rotating dial versus some touch-sensitive sliders or tap-to-activate buttons that don’t work as naturally. There remain physical buttons for the climate system, which is nice, and new standard features include wireless Apple CarPlay Android Auto and wireless charging. They’re great upgrades for everyday livability.\n\nThose hoping the RS 3 sedan can be a family hauler shouldn’t count the car’s extra two doors as an “in” if they still have smaller children in bulky child-safety seats. In our car-seat testing, the related A3 had compromised front-seat comfort when rear-facing convertible and infant seats were installed. I carted my 2-year-old around in a rear-facing convertible and my 5-year-old in a forward-facing convertible, and while we all fit, even an hourlong drive stretched everyone’s comfort in the cramped cockpit; both my wife and I had to move our seats up to give the kids some breathing room. Even so, the RS 3 is still a better option for family duty than any two-door or two-seat competitor. For adults, the backseat is certainly passable for occasional use.\n\nThankfully, everyone was distracted from the cramped quarters by how much they enjoyed the personality this car oozes. My daughters yelled “Hit it!” from the backseat when they wanted to hear the engine and feel the acceleration, and at one point, when I suggested taking our SUV to the grocery store instead of the RS 3, my youngest was in tears, pointing at the Audi in the driveway: “No! This one!” I feel ya, buddy.\n\nTrunk Space\n2022 Audi RS 3 | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nThe RS 3’s 13.4 cubic feet of Cars.com-measured cargo room is in line with other small sedans. It was enough for a bulky single-seat stroller and a diaper bag. It’s identical to the cargo space in a Genesis G70 sedan (13.4 cubic feet) and a tad smaller than the Cadillac CT4-V sedan’s (13.7 cubic feet).\n\nFor the Money\n\nPricing for the 2023 RS 3 starts at $61,995 (all prices include destination). My 2022 test car was equipped with the RS Technology Package, RS Sport Exhaust, Black Optic Plus Package, and blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert. For 2023, thus equipped, that car would be $66,845.\n\nThere aren’t a lot of hardcore little sedans in this price range. The Mercedes-AMG CLA45 S Coupe (the four-door kind of “coupe”) is perhaps the most direct competitor, but I also think the BMW M340i deserves a look. It’s slightly larger and has more daily-driver-friendly interior dimensions — but if track days are in your future, know that it doesn’t feel as able as the RS 3.\n\nThe RS 3 is a definite improvement over the previous generation. Its raucousness is unapologetic, and it does what it needs to in order to go fast without worrying about being a luxury car. If you’re not carving corners, you may not pick up the differences, but you’ll definitely appreciate how much more modern the RS 3 is when living with it every day.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2017 Audi RS 3 Vs. 2018 Audi TT RS: Performance at a Price\nGenesis G70 Vs.

      "expert_review": "Audi’s littlest performance model, the RS 3, receives updates for the 2025 model year that are in line with the changes made to its sedate (A3) and less sporty (S3) siblings. The brand also released pricing for the updated sports sedan, which is on sale now; it starts at $64,695 (price includes $1,295 destination charge).\n\nRelated: 2025 Audi A3 and S3 Review: Dynamic Duo\n\nWhat’s New for the 2025 RS 3?\n\nOn the outside, the RS 3’s front and rear bumpers, grille, LED exterior lighting and wheel designs are new, and three fresh hues join the available color palette: Arkona White, Ascari Blue Metallic and Progressive Red Metallic. Inside the cabin are a new steering wheel that’s flat on the bottom and on top, standard ambient lighting, dark-gray metal interior trim (the RS 3 previously wore bright silver), and available red or green accent stitching on black upholstery.\n\nAudi also fine-tuned the RS 3’s standard adaptive suspension for greater control. In doing so, the brand found more than seven seconds on the famous Nurburgring Nordschleife racetrack, dropping the sport sedan’s lap time to what Audi claims is a new compact car class circuit record.\n\nWhat Are the 2025 Audi RS 3’s Trim Levels?\n\nThe RS 3 only comes in one trim level. It’s well equipped, with standard features including 19-inch wheels, LED exterior lighting, a panoramic moonroof and rain-sensing windshield wipers. Inside, the RS 3 features Nappa leather seat upholstery, heated front seats, three-zone automatic climate control, a digital instrument cluster, 10.1-inch touchscreen and Sonos sound system. Standard safety tech on the 2025 Audi RS 3 includes forward collision alert with automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, lane-centering steering and a 360-degree camera system.\n\nAvailable options are bundled into a handful of packages. The Carbon Package adds carbon-fiber exterior trim and black 19-inch wheels. The Dynamic Plus Package includes high-performance summer tires, carbon-ceramic front brakes with red calipers, a carbon engine cover and a top speed governed at 180 mph instead of the standard 155 mph. The RS Design Packages add red or green interior accents, and the RS Technology Package adds a head-up display, navigation and road-sign recognition.\n\nWhat Are the 2025 Audi RS 3’s Powertrain Specs and MPG?\n\nThe RS 3 is powered by a turbocharged 2.5-liter inline-five-cylinder engine that generates 394 horsepower and 369 pounds-feet of torque. A seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission and all-wheel drive are standard. Audi claims the combo is good for a 3.6-second blast from 0-60 mph and 20/30/23 mpg city/highway/combined (official EPA fuel-economy figures are not yet available).\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2023 Audi RS 3 Review: Just the Right Amount of Raucousness\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2023 Audi A3?\nIs the 2023 Audi RS 3 a Good Car? 4 Pros and 3 Cons\nResearch the Audi RS 3\nFind Your Next Car\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "“The grass is always greener on the other side of the pond.” That’s the lament car enthusiasts in the U.S. have long uttered while gazing with intense longing across the Atlantic at the sports sedans, hatchbacks and wagons that seem much more numerous on European shores.\n\nOver the past several years, however, a few of those cars have made it to our fair shores, among them the Audi RS 3, starting with just 250 preconfigured cars for the 2017 model year but continuing in earnest for the 2018 model year.\n\nThe RS 3 doesn’t arrive unopposed. Competitors like the BMW M2, Jaguar XE S and Mercedes-AMG CLA 45 come to mind. Compare the RS 3 with those cars here. Still, this is illustrious company. The M2 especially sets a high bar when it comes to driving dynamics and enjoyment, giving the RS 3 plenty to live up to. Even within Audi’s own stable, the TT RS two-door offers sharp handling, and the RS 7 sedan delivers face-melting acceleration (compare those here).\n\nSo it was with high expectations that I set out to see if the latest import from Europe has what it takes to be among this continent’s best.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nLooking at the RS 3’s credentials on paper, it seems to have all the ingredients necessary for a raucous driving experience. Under the hood lies a 400-horsepower, turbocharged 2.5-liter five-cylinder that makes 354 pounds-feet of torque. An RS-tuned version of Audi’s Quattro all-wheel-drive system is standard, sending more power to the rear wheels than the Quattro system found on most Audis, and a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic is the only transmission.\n\nAlso uniquely tuned to the RS are its steering and Audi’s magnetic ride adaptive suspension, both with the goal of tightening up the driving experience. It works; the steering offers more weight and linearity than most Audis I’ve tested, and the suspension tightens up noticeably as you crank up the RS 3’s drive modes from Comfort to Auto to Dynamic.\n\nI was prepared to love the RS 3, but there’s just something missing. Simply tossing all of a recipe’s ingredients into a bowl doesn’t give you a cake; all the components seem to be here, but the RS 3 lacks a sharpness I expect from a car with this price and pedigree. There are two reasons for this: body roll and a strange throttle delay.\n\nThe engine is powerful. The RS 3 wouldn’t be able to make its zero-to-60-mph sprint in less than 4 seconds (3.9, Audi says) without plenty of giddyup under the hood. The culprit to me is the transmission, which seemed to sap power when I wanted it most. Even with throttle settings dialed up to Dynamic, there was a strange hesitation to the acceleration that remained even when I tried shifting manually with the paddles. This delay was especially disconcerting coming out of corners, as I tried to hold momentum for the next turn and couldn’t quite get the car to agree with me.\n\nSpeaking of corners, there was also unexpected sloppiness from the RS 3 that sapped some of my confidence in pushing the car harder. It’s not that the suspension isn’t firm in its Dynamic setting — you do feel the road underneath you — there’s just a hint of vagueness when the car gets about midway through a curve that’s concerning. Combine this with a lack of burst on exit, and the RS 3 felt flat rather than sharp and responsive as expected.\n\nFuel economy is predictably bad for a small car, with an EPA-estimated 19/28/22 mpg city/highway/combined on premium gas. For comparison, Audi’s 186-hp A3 sedan is rated 29 mpg combined and takes regular. In between, the S3 sedan makes 292 hp and is rated 24 mpg combined with premium.\n\nWhat I Tested\n\nFor 2017, the RS 3 has just one trim level, with a starting price of $55,450 (including a $950 destination charge). I tested a 2017 version of the car, which Audi says is identical to the 2018 other than the addition of blind spot warning and rear cross-traffic alert systems as standard equipment on the 2018. This bumps up the price slightly, so the 2018 model starts at $55,875.\n\nStandard features include a panoramic moonroof, heated front seats, sport seats in Nappa leather, LED headlights and a backup camera. All 2017 RS 3s are preconfigured to add the Technology Package ($3,900) and Dynamic Package ($1,450), so you won’t find one at the base price. The Technology Package adds navigation, blind spot warning, rear cross-traffic alert, Audi Virtual Cockpit (which replaces the instrument panel with a large screen) and a Bang & Olufsen sound system. The Dynamic Package is more performance-focused, adding 19-inch wheels with a titanium finish, summer performance tires, red brake calipers and a sport exhaust system with black exhaust tips.\n\nThere were a few other single-feature options sneaking along for the ride on the car I drove, including carbon-fiber inlays on the inside ($600) and gorgeous Ara Blue crystal-effect paint ($1,075) on the outside. That paint job is worth singling out — it’s somehow even more sparkling blue than it appears in photos. I adored it. Final price as tested: $62,475.\n\nLooks and Feels the Part\n\nDespite sharing much of its shape with the more sedate A3 and S3, I found both the RS 3’s styling and interior to live up to its price and sporty aspirations. It shares prominent side skirts and a rear diffuser with the S3, but the grille gets a more prominent metallic rim, with “Quattro” spelled out in Audi font at the bottom. That particular cheeky, mildly cheesy touch probably won’t be universally loved, but I liked it.\n\nThe RS 3 is more practical than it may appear. It’s a small car, so passenger room isn’t abundant, but I did manage to carry four adults around for much of a day with no complaints, so long as the front and rear occupants negotiated legroom.\n\nThe quality of materials is a mixed bag: The seats are a highlight and the dashboard is a lowlight. The front seats feature an attractive diamond-stitched pattern on the backrests with contrasting gray thread, and they’re comfortable even for longer drives, which you can’t say about all sport seats. This high point is contrasted, however, by swaths of blankness on the dashboard. When you jump up from an A3 to an RS 3, you’re paying for speed, not better interior design.\n\nThe RS 3’s multimedia system comes with standard Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, though both systems are controlled via Audi’s controller knob, which takes some practice. The RS 3 I tested also had the optional Virtual Cockpit, which swaps out a conventional gauge-based instrument panel for a 12.3-inch color display, a feature I like a lot.\n\nValue\n\nFor a car like this, value is inseparably tied to performance. If I’m spending $60,000-plus on a sports sedan, it better nail the “sport” part of that equation, and the RS 3 doesn’t quite do that. To be sure, it’s an athletic sedan that has plenty of engine and the ability to drive circles around 95 percent of cars out there. The problem is that the remaining 5 percent includes at least one of its closest competitors: I’d rather drive an M2, even if it can’t comfortably fit more than two people.\n\nThe RS 3 is also missing out a bit on safety features. I can understand features like adaptive cruise control and lane keep assist not coming standard on the A3, but that car is much cheaper. They’re available as part of a safety option package on the 2018 RS 3, and that’s hard to swallow given similar features are now standard on many cars with much lower price tags.\n\nIt would be unfair to say I didn’t enjoy the RS 3 or that it’s a bad addition to the menu of sport sedans here in the U.S. I think it’s a good car on its face; the problem is that, at this price, good doesn’t cut it — and the M2 is great.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Another Audi RS model is coming stateside, but it's not the six-figure RS 7 or the TT sports car. Instead, the German automaker plans to bring a high-performance version of its compact A3/S3 sedan to the U.S. over the next few months. It's the 400-horsepower RS 3, a car that will go on sale for the 2018 model year this summer, with a small number of 2017s available before that.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe 2017 RS 3 starts at $55,450 for the 2017 model — a mere $11,600 more than the 2017 S3 — but it may be hard to find any cars at that price, as Audi says it will offer only \"a limited number\" of 2017 RS 3s with a bevy of optional equipment. The 2018 RS 3, meanwhile, hits dealers this summer with a starting price of $55,875.\n\nExterior\nThe RS 3’s six-sided grille has a honeycomb pattern instead of the S3’s slatted design, but the easiest way to tell the RS 3 apart is below it, where the RS’ bumper openings have gloss-black framework instead of the body-colored details on the A3 and S3. The visual effect makes for a continuous, thin opening on the RS 3 that spans the nose and fans out into taller portals below the headlights — interesting in the details, but more mild than wild. In back, the RS 3 ditches the S3’s quad tailpipes for dual pipes, but they’re beefy like the RS 7’s. The RS 3’s silver wheels measure 19 inches and wear high-performance summer tires.\n \nInterior\nThe RS 3 has standard sport seats — they’re optional on the S3 — with elaborate, quilt-stitched sections that fan out at the shoulders. Other areas have aluminum or carbon-fiber inlays. RS badging adorns the seats, door sills and flat-bottom steering wheel. Nappa leather upholstery, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are standard, with Audi’s Virtual Cockpit 12.3-inch digital instrument panel and Bang & Olufsen audio optional. The gauges can show specific horsepower and torque output, as well as a G-meter.\n \nUnder the Hood\nA performance sleeper, the RS 3 is not. The sedan boasts a turbocharged 2.5-liter five-cylinder with port and direct injection that’s good for 400 hp and 354 pounds-feet of torque, up 108 hp and 74 pounds-feet versus the S3’s turbo four-cylinder. The engine drives all four wheels through a seven-speed, dual-clutch automatic transmission with a launch control program for maximum acceleration. Indeed, Audi says the RS 3 can hit 60 mph in a scant 3.9 seconds — considerably less than the S3’s already-quick 4.7 seconds. It’s also a couple of ticks ahead of manufacturer-estimated times for the RS 3’s most direct competitor: the Mercedes-AMG CLA45.\n \nThe RS 3’s all-wheel drive has no default bias, but Audi says it’s programmed to send as much power to the rear wheels as possible. Various driver-selectable modes can alter steering and drivetrain settings as well as stiffness for the optional adaptive shock absorbers. The electronic stability system has a sport mode with reduced intervention, and high-performance, carbon-ceramic disc brakes for the front wheels are optional.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Audi A3?\n\nThe A3 is Audi’s entry-level car and is available as a five-seat sedan; the previously available convertible version has been discontinued for 2020. The front-wheel-drive A3 comes with a 184-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, while the all-wheel-drive version gets a 228-hp, turbo four-cylinder. Both engines work with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission.\n\nThe A3 is also offered in two performance-tuned variants, the S3 and RS 3. The S3 gets a 288-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder, while the RS 3 is powered by a turbocharged 2.5-liter five-cylinder that makes 394 hp. Competitors include the BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe and Mercedes-Benz A-Class.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Audi A3?\n\nA new Final Edition Package includes black or red leather sport seats with contrast stitching, and a three-spoke flat-bottom steering wheel with shift paddles. All-wheel-drive A3s get S line badges, aluminum door sills and unique 18-inch wheels. A new, less expensive Premium trim level joins the S3 lineup for 2020.\n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Audi A3 Are Most Important?\n\nAll-wheel drive has been a hallmark of Audi’s lineup for decades, and it’s standard or available on all variants of the A3 line. The A3 also offers many features found on larger luxury models, including a panoramic moonroof, leather upholstery, heated front seats, and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity. The S3 and RS 3 have sports-car-challenging performance. Bear in mind, however, that the price of a fully loaded RS 3 can be about double that of a base A3.\n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Audi A3?\n\nIf you want an Audi badge for a minimum amount of money, the A3 is a tempting proposition; it has much of the design and driving experience provided by bigger, more expensive German sedans. A cramped rear seat and some austere cabin trim detracts from the overall posh image, however.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Audi A3?\n\nThe A3 is Audi's entry-level car and is available as a five-seat sedan or four-seat convertible. The sedan also is offered in performance-oriented S3 guise and in high-performance RS3 trim.\n\nFront-drive A3 models use a 184-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine; all-wheel-drive A3s have 228 hp. The S3 sedan has a 288-hp, turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder and AWD. The AWD RS3’s 2.5-liter five-cylinder generates 394 hp. All versions feature a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. Competitors include the BMW 2 Series and Mercedes-Benz CLA-Class.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2019 Audi A3?\n\nThe Premium trim adds standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. A3 Premium Plus and Prestige trims get standard LED headlights, LED taillights and the Audi phone box with wireless charging and signal booster. Park assist, a new feature that maneuvers the car during parallel and perpendicular parking, is standard on A3 and S3 Prestige sedans. The RS3 adds the Audi phone box as standard.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Audi A3 Are Most Important?\n\nAll-wheel drive has been a hallmark of Audi’s lineup for decades, and it's standard or available on all variants of the A3 line. The compact-size A3 offers a boatload of features found on larger luxury models, including a panoramic moonroof (on sedans), leather upholstery, heated front seats and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Moving up to higher trim levels to get navigation, LED headlights, adaptive cruise control and other features can push the price to more than $45,000.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Audi A3?\n\nGood things do come in small packages, and the A3 line offers a high level of convenience and refinement, along with sprightly performance. However, it’s short on backseat room and, with all-wheel drive, cargo room, and the price climbs quickly with higher trim levels and by adding optional features.",
