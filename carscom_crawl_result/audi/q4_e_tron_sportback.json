      "expert_review": "Competes with: Ford Mustang Mach-E, Hyundai Ioniq 5, Kia KV6, Tesla Model Y, Volkswagen ID.4\n\nLooks like: A sleeker Audi Q5\n\nDrivetrains: 201 horsepower (estimate) with single motor or 295 hp (estimate) with dual electric motors; 82-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery; rear- or all-wheel drive\n\nHits dealerships: Late 2021\n\nThe list of electric vehicles available from major automakers planning to challenge the dominance of Tesla is about to grow by two models, as Audi has taken the wraps off its 2022 Q4 E-Tron and Q4 E-Tron Sportback models. They mark the lowest-price, entry-level, electric-vehicle crossovers from the German luxury brand, riding on a dedicated EV platform and offering an estimated maximum of 250 miles of range, according to the manufacturer. \n\nRelated: 2022 Audi E-Tron GT: Premium Efficiency\n\nExterior\n\nSize-wise, the new Q4 E-Tron and Q4 E-Tron Sportback are dimensionally similar to Audi’s compact Q5 crossover, so smaller than Audi’s other EV SUV, the original E-Tron. The company says that the footprint is the same as the Q5, but that the Q4 E-Tron brings the next generation of EV styling to the Audi lineup, albeit in the smallest entry-level model available for sale. The standard Q4 E-Tron will be an SUV, while the Sportback model gets the “crossover coupe” treatment with a lower, racier roofline and truncated cargo area that ends in a two-part window and deep, integrated spoiler. Both models put a special emphasis on aerodynamics, with the Q4 E-Tron achieving a 0.28 coefficient of drag, while the Sportback manages an even better 0.26. Both models will be offered with all of Audi’s signature styling elements, like the S Line and Black Optic exterior styling options and the animated coming-home and leaving-home dancing head- and taillight patterns. New to the system: The driver can choose between four different running-light signatures via the onboard multimedia system.\n\nInterior\n\nOn the inside, it’s an expected move to a “glass cockpit” for the Q4 models, including an optional flat top-and-bottom steering wheel with touch-sensitive controls and capacitive hands-on detection for semi-autonomous driving aids. Audi claims that the interior is roughly the same size as the Q5, but the Q4 E-Tron features better passenger space due to the elimination of the transmission tunnel and improved legroom thanks to a flat cabin floor. The center 10.1-inch multimedia interface (Audi MMI) display is angled toward the driver and features a floating panel below it that houses the electronic shifter above an additional storage cubby. The gauge cluster is a standard 10.25-inch digital affair; it can be upgraded to Audi’s signature Virtual Cockpit look for additional functionality, such as full-screen navigation. An optional augmented reality head-up display is available, superimposing information like driver assistance features, speed and navigation aids onto the windshield but appearing to be projected roughly 30 feet in front of the driver and interacting with outside elements like lane lines and other vehicles. A new Sonos premium audio system will be available, marking that brand’s debut with the German automaker.\n\n2022 Audi Q4 E-Tron | Manufacturer image\nUnder the Hood\n\nThe new Q4 E-Tron and Q4 E-Tron Sportback are powered by a common battery system, an 82-kilowatt-hour gross rating, meaning the full size of the battery and 77-kwh net, which is the usable portion of the battery for driving the car. It’s a liquid-cooled lithium-ion pack that sits in the floor between the axles to lower the vehicle’s center of gravity. The crossover can be had in one of two configurations: The Q4 40 E-Tron is a single-motor, rear-wheel-drive model that makes an estimated 201 hp, while the Q4 50 E-Tron quattro and Q4 50 Sportback E-Tron quattro are dual-motor all-wheel-drive models, adding a motor to the front axle and bumping output to an estimated 295 hp. Recharging can be done via an up to 11-kilowatt AC circuit or up to 125 kilowatts on a DC fast charger. \n\nHandling and driving performance are managed by the McPherson front axle and five-link rear suspension setups, as well as the Audi drive mode selection system that allows varying driving profiles like Efficiency, Comfort, Dynamic and customizable Individual. The range champ will be the Q4 40, which Audi estimates will achieve roughly 250 miles in the U.S. EPA cycle; range estimates or recharging times for the rest of the lineup are not yet available. \n\nA full complement of driver assist and semi-autonomous driving aids will also be available, including Audi Pre-sense, side and lane assist, and high-beam headlight assist. Adaptive cruise control will be offered with lane keeping and Traffic Jam Assist.\n\nPricing and Availability\n\nThe ’22 Audi Q4 E-Tron and Q4 Sportback E-Tron will arrive in U.S. dealerships toward the end of 2021, according to the company, with the least expensive model expected to start under $45,000 (not including destination fee or any available tax credits or rebates) for a Q4 40 E-Tron.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Audi Q4 e-Tron?\n\nThe Audi Q4 e-Tron is an electric compact SUV that seats five and offers a choice of a traditional upright-roofline version or a more rakish, fastback-roof variant called the Q4 e-Tron Sportback. The single-motor, rear-wheel-drive 45 powertrain makes 282 horsepower and comes only in the regular Q4. The dual-motor, all-wheel-drive 55 powertrain makes 335 hp; it’s optional in the regular Q4 and standard in the Sportback. The 45 and 55 are available in Premium and Premium Plus trim levels, while the line-topping Prestige trim is restricted to the 55. The Q4 e-Tron shares its basic platform with the Volkswagen ID.4, and its competitors include the Cadillac Optiq, Genesis GV60 and Electrified GV70, Mercedes-EQ EQB and Volvo EX40.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Q4 e-Tron?\n\nThe Q4 e-Tron’s entry-level powertrain is renamed 45 (it was previously called 40); it gains 81 hp and sees a 23-mile increase in driving range, to 288 miles total. The previously optional Technology Package is now standard across the board; it includes navigation, connected services, road-sign recognition and a digital instrument panel. A new Cold Weather Package is available for the 55 and includes a heat pump, which regulates cabin temperature more efficiently than a traditional climate-control system, along with a heated windshield.\n\nHow Much Range Does the 2025 Audi Q4 e-Tron Have?\n\nThe Q4 e-Tron’s EPA-estimated driving range is 288 miles for the RWD 45 powertrain and 258 miles for the AWD 55 powertrain (for both regular and Sportback versions). \n\nHow Long Does It Take to Charge the 2025 Audi Q4 e-Tron?\n\nWhen using a 240-volt Level 2 charger, the Q4 e-Tron fully recharges in about 12 hours. When using a DC fast charger, the Q4 e-Tron goes from 10% to 80% charge in about 30 minutes.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Audi Q4 e-Tron Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nLeather upholstery\nPower-adjustable driver’s seat\nHeated front seats\nTri-zone climate control\nPanoramic sunroof\nPower liftgate\n11.6-inch infotainment touchscreen\n10.25-inch digital instrument cluster\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nTraffic-sign recognition\nRain-sensing wipers\nFront and rear parking sensors\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nHands-free power liftgate\nMemory settings for the driver’s seat\nPower-adjustable passenger seat\nAuto-dimming rearview mirror\nWireless device charging\nHeated steering wheel\nHeated windshield\nHeat pump\nLane departure steering assist\nPark assist\nSonos surround-sound stereo\nHeadlight washers\nHead-up instrument display\nSport-tuned suspension\nShould I Buy the 2025 Audi Q4 e-Tron?\n\nThe Q4 e-Tron inherits many of the virtues of the VW ID.4 with which it shares a platform, and it adds enough upscale trim and features to make its higher price palatable. The model lineup offers decent variety, but note that choosing the pricier, racier-looking Sportback version brings compromises in cargo versatility and rear visibility. In any of its forms, the Q4 e-Tron’s driving range and charging speed trail those of class leaders.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Carrying the cachet that comes with an Audi badge, the Q4 e-Tron family of electric SUVs do very little poorly or foolishly and are a “normal” option for shoppers who aren’t as daring as some EV early adopters.\n\nVersus the competition: While not as sporty or powerful as similarly sized or priced premium electric SUVs, the Q4 e-Tron and Q4 Sportback e-Tron are accessible and intuitive models that make a strong case for themselves as SUVs that just happen to be EVs.\n\nAudi is expanding its electric vehicle portfolio and adding a smaller, more affordable model in the Q4 e-Tron, which is available in a traditional SUV body style and coupelike version named the Q4 Sportback e-Tron. I traveled to Oceanside, Calif., (per Cars.com’s ethics policy, we pay for our flights and lodging when attending such manufacturer-sponsored events) to spend a brief time behind the wheel and poking around the two versions to see where they stand in the constantly growing electric SUV field.\n\nRelated: 2022 Audi E-Tron S and E-Tron S Sportback: More Money, More Power, Less Range\n\nThe Q4 e-Tron is available in single-motor rear-wheel-drive form or with dual motors and all-wheel drive, but the Q4 Sportback e-Tron is AWD-only. The battery pack is an 82-kilowatt-hour unit no matter which version you get. If those basic facts sound familiar, that’s because the Q4 e-Tron shares much of its underlying architecture with the Volkswagen ID.4 SUV.\n\nI drove 2022 versions of the Q4 at the drive event, but this model year is sold out and changes for 2023 are minimal; for 2023, there’s a larger touchscreen (using the same software), the S Line appearance package is now standard on AWD models and wheel choices are slightly different.\n\nDriving the Q4 e-Tron\n\nHaving already driven the VW ID.4, the Q4 e-Tron felt familiar — and not in a bad way. Power is relatively modest for an EV, with single-motor RWD versions rated at 201 horsepower and dual-motor AWD models making a healthier 295 hp. With an Audi-estimated 0-60 mph time of 5.8 seconds, the dual-motor version is no slouch, but most of its quickness is felt from stoplight to stoplight, where the electric motors’ instant torque gets to play. There’s still some power in reserve for highway passing and merging, but at higher speeds, the Q4 e-Tron has less oomph. Changing drive modes does little to change the character of the car; throttle response doesn’t feel different, and the steering gets slightly heavier. Personally, I preferred the weightier steering feel of the Q4 e-Tron’s Dynamic mode.\n\nBraking with the brake pedal and not the regenerative system feels linear and easy, like a decent set of brakes in a gas-powered car. That’s still a relatively uncommon trait in EVs, which often have brakes that feel mushy or lack feedback, but this sort of traditional feel makes the Q4 e-Tron more accessible to drivers who are new to EVs.\n\nA curious omission is the lack of true one-pedal driving. The Q4 E-Tron offers three levels of regenerative braking, with the most powerful nearly bringing the car to a complete stop before a final press of the brake pedal is needed. Regeneration strength can be adjusted via paddles on the steering wheel, or you can simply select the strongest setting by selecting the “B” driving mode via the gear selector. I preferred the highest-strength setting while driving around town and for managing speed when descending larger hills; it saved me when passing a motorcycle cop posted at the bottom of a hill, where coasting would’ve had me exceeding the speed limit significantly. On twistier roads, however, the drag from the regeneration system was noticeable and unsettling, and I preferred to forgo it.\n\nThe Q4 e-Tron’s steering is nicely weighted and communicative, and is tuned for everyday driving. The SUV’s 33.5-foot turning circle (37.7 feet with AWD) makes it feel maneuverable and nimble in low-speed parking and parking-adjacent situations.\n\nRide quality feels slightly firmer than the ID.4 and roughly on par with the Volvo XC40 and C40 Recharges, Genesis GV60 and Tesla Model Y. You’ll feel bumps, potholes, expansion joints and other road imperfections in the cabin, but they aren’t unsettling. Having a chance to drive all of these vehicles back-to-back on the same roads would provide a more definitive ranking, of course, but know that the Q4 e-Tron’s ride is comfortable and unlikely to upset you or your passengers.\n\nRoad, tire and wind noise seem more present than in a gas-powered SUV, but that’s to be expected when there isn’t an internal-combustion engine to drown out much of those sounds. I did notice some extra wind noise at higher speeds, however.\n\nForward visibility, despite the forward position of the A-pillars, was decent from my seating position. Rear visibility is lacking, however, particularly in the Sportback; the rear head restraints obstruct the view behind, and the Sportback has a rear spoiler that splits the rear windscreen and blocks your view.\n\nInterior\n\nOn one hand, the Q4 e-Tron’s interior impresses with its traditional layout that is unlikely to scare away shoppers. The control layout is straightforward, with physical climate and audio controls and, blessedly, four window switches on the driver’s side (the ID.4, for whatever reason, has two switches and an additional toggle to control the front or rear windows). Also impressive is its infotainment system, which is the traditional Audi MMI system we’ve seen throughout the brand’s lineup. Unlike the ID.4’s occasionally confusing system, MMI works easily and intuitively.\n\nOn the other hand, the controls on the steering wheel are touch-sensitive, something both we at Cars.com and consumers in general don’t enjoy. To Audi’s credit, the controls do provide haptic feedback and aren’t as fraught as the ones used by Mercedes-Benz. Audi’s controls require actual intentional presses, whereas turning the steering wheel in a Benz might lead to multiple unintentional inputs. Still, the Audi’s steering wheel controls are sometimes hard to see in direct sunlight, and I’ll always prefer real buttons to facsimiles.\n\nInterior materials quality is adequate. There are a lot of hard plastic surfaces, especially below the beltline, and some buyers might find that disappointing in a vehicle that can cost more than $60,000. The plastic in particular stands out with lighter-colored upholstery; the all-black interior looks the nicest.\n\nInterior room is impressive both front and rear. Up front, the low, nontraditional gear selector adds to the feeling of roominess. The center console, however, has minimal storage space that’s difficult to reach. The backseat feels like you’re sitting in a class-larger vehicle, though rear headroom in the Sportback is an issue for taller passengers. I’m 6-foot-1 and my head was firmly planted in the Sportback’s roof despite cutouts in the headliner to increase headroom. If you’re constantly hauling taller passengers, the regular Q4 e-Tron is a better bet than the Sportback.\n\nInterestingly, the opposite is true when it comes to cargo — at least according to Audi’s measurements. Audi says the Q4 e-Tron has 24.8 cubic feet of cargo space with the backseat upright and 53.1 cubic feet with the backseat folded; the Q4 Sportback e-Tron, with its coupelike roofline and all, measures at 26.1 and 54.4 cubic feet, respectively. Those aren’t massive differences, but they are surprising. Obviously, taller cargo is more easily stored in the Q4 e-Tron, but we’ll have to wait until we can conduct our own cargo measurements to see how the two compare.\n\nRegardless of body style, the Q4’s cargo area has useful configurability. A cargo floor panel can move to change the load floor height or create a divider to prevent cargo from shifting, and in its regular position, it covers an underfloor storage area where things like the standard mobile charger can be stored.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nAudi Debuts Entry-Level EV, Q4 E-Tron SUV, for Less Than $45,000\nWhat to Know Before Purchasing an Electric Vehicle: A Buying Guide\nWhat It Cost to Outfit 6 Homes With EV Chargers\nResearch Electric Vehicles\nShop for an EV\nRange and Charging\n\nRange is an area where the Q4 e-Tron and Q4 Sportback e-Tron won’t wow shoppers, maxing out at an estimated 265 miles for the RWD Q4 e-Tron and 236 miles for the AWD model (the Q4 Sportback e-Tron has an Audi-estimated 242 miles of range). Those range estimates are roughly competitive with Volvo’s compact electric SUVs and the Genesis GV60, but they trail the Model Y and certain versions of the Hyundai Ioniq 5 and Kia EV6. During my drive on a mix of roads at varying speeds, I observed consumption of around 3 miles per kilowatt-hour, which is in line with the vehicle’s efficiency estimates.\n\nDoes the Q4 e-Tron’s lower range estimates matter? Possibly, if you’re set on using it for road trips; according to Audi, it can DC fast-charge at up to 150 kilowatts, which can charge the battery from 5% to 80% in as little as 36 minutes. That’s not nearly as impressive as the fast-charging capabilities of the EV6, Ioniq 5 and GV60, and suggests the Q4 e-Tron’s primary mission is as a second or commuter vehicle.\n\nAudi Q4 e-Tron Sportback | Cars.com photo by Brian Normile\n\nAll Q4 e-Trons include a 40-amp Level 2 mobile charger that enables the vehicle to charge at up to 9.6 kW from a 240-volt outlet, reaching a full charge in an Audi-estimated nine hours. With 48-amp Level 2 charging, the rate increases up to 11.5 kW and charging time decreases to 7.5 hours. For the latter, buyers will need a hardwired charger, and Audi is partnering with Electrify America and Qmerit for charger sourcing and installation for buyers who want help with a home-charging setup.\n\nWhere Does the Q4 e-Tron Fit?\n\nThe Q4 e-Tron is, visually and functionally, an exceedingly “normal” SUV that feels like a regular SUV that happens to be electric. With Tesla attracting a particular kind of bleeding-edge consumer and many manufacturers taking a more futuristic approach when it comes to styling, the Q4 e-Tron just wants to be an SUV for luxury-minded buyers.\n\nWith the single-motor RWD model starting at just under $50,000 and prices for the AWD model rising to well over $60,000 with options, the Q4 e-Tron occupies a very premium, near-luxury space in the class. But for that money, buyers get a competent EV that drives well and has an intuitive interior — and for those who care, it has that luxury-brand badge.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Audi Q4 e-Tron?\n\nThe Audi Q4 e-Tron and its sleeker counterpart, the Q4 e-Tron Sportback, are compact SUVs that seat five people; they’re the brand’s smallest and most affordable electric vehicles. The regular Q4 e-Tron has a conventional SUV shape, while the Sportback is a more stylish option, featuring a sloping rear roofline. Both share their basic platform with the Volkswagen ID.4. Powertrain choices include a single-motor version called 40 that produces 201 horsepower and drives the front wheels. A two-motor all-wheel-drive variant called 50 makes 295 hp. The 40 powertrain is offered only on the regular Q4, not the Sportback. For 2024, the 50 powertrain was replaced midyear by an upgraded 55 version with stronger, more efficient electric motors, delivering 335 hp and a longer driving range. The Q4 e-Tron’s competitors include the Genesis GV60,  , Tesla Model Y and Volvo XC40 Recharge.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Audi Q4 e-Tron?\n\nEntering their third year of production, the Audi Q4 e-Tron and Q4 e-Tron Sportback get only minor changes for 2024, other than the midyear upgraded 55 powertrain. All trims now have standard adaptive cruise control with lane-centering steering, plus steering-wheel paddles to choose your desired amount of regenerative braking.\n\nHow Much Range Does the 2024 Audi Q4 e-Tron Have?\n\nThe Q4 e-Tron’s EPA-estimated driving range runs from 236 to 265 miles, depending on powertrain and body style.\n\nHow Long Does It Take to Charge the 2024 Audi Q4 e-Tron?\n\nThe Q4 e-Tron’s charging times range from an estimated nine hours to go to a 100% charge on a standard 240-volt Level 2 charger, down to an estimated 28 minutes on a 350-kilowatt DC fast charger to go from a 10% charge to 80%.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Audi Q4 e-Tron Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n19-inch alloy wheels\nAdaptive cruise control\nLane-centering steering\nAutomatic headlights and high beams\nRain-detecting wipers\n10.1-inch touchscreen\nWireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay\n10.25-inch digital instrument cluster\nEight-speaker audio system\nHeated front seats\nPower driver’s seat\nRemote keyless entry and push-button start\nDual-zone automatic climate control\nRear climate controls\nLeather steering wheel\nLeatherette seating surfaces\nFront and rear parking sensors\nBlind spot warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nHead-up display\nNavigation\nPremium audio system\nHeadlamp washers\nAutomated parking system\nAlarm system with motion sensor\nPower passenger seat\nMemory driver’s seat\nHeated steering wheel\nAuto-dimming, power-folding mirrors\nWireless charging pad\nShould I Buy the 2024 Audi Q4 e-Tron?\n\nThe Audi Q4 e-Tron and Q4 e-Tron Sportback are worth a look if you’re in the market for an upscale compact SUV with electric power and decent, if not class-leading, range. Both offer smooth power delivery and good driving dynamics. Unlike some competing EVs, both have relatively straightforward and conventional controls.",
