      "expert_review": "It was a midnight run. The road was clear. The moon was bright. Unseasonably cold winds whipped a late March night.\n\nI listened to the engine of the 2008 Audi A5 3.2 Quattro coupe and thought about end times — not in the apocalyptic sense, but denouement in the manner of the closing of an era.\n\nDecades ago, when I began covering the automobile industry, drunk on cheap gasoline and high on horsepower like many of my colleagues, such thoughts would not have entered my mind. Back then, it was all about the thrill of the drive — the faster, the better — gasoline consumption and speed limits be damned whenever and wherever those restrictions could be consigned to perdition without causing bodily harm.\n\nBut I and the world in which I drive have changed over the years. I no longer believe in the infinite availability of finite resources and can’t understand why I ever did.\n\nMy appreciation of the limits of things came with travel to Asia, Europe, Africa, South America and other places where people of different colors, religions, ethnicities and cultures all wanted the same thing — more energy, be it from fossil fuels or their alternatives, to acquire personal mobility and to improve their lives.\n\nThey weren’t begging for that energy.\n\nThey were, and are, demanding it. That made me realize that we in the United States, sooner or later, will have to change our attitudes about energy and how we use it.\n\nBut old habits die hard, which is why I was out on Interstate 66 at midnight, when I figured the traffic would be light, putting the wonderfully agile, seductively powerful all-wheel-drive A5 3.2 Quattro coupe through its paces. If there is such a thing as the perfect driver’s car, I thought, this is it — so light, tight, responsive.\n\nAudi could have engineered the compact coupe to get more than 18 miles per gallon in the city and 27 mpg on the highway and to run on something other than premium unleaded gasoline. Certainly, that is something my older, more conservative, more responsible mind would appreciate.\n\nOr would it?\n\nI found a side road, blessedly free of traffic, and touched the throttle. Whoooosssshhh! The extra o’s, s’s and h’s are there to give you a better idea of the smooth power of the A5 3.2 Quattro’s 3.2-liter, 265-horsepower V-6 engine. It’s not “whoosh,” which is too fast and jerky. It’s “whoooosssshhh” — smooth, gentle, yet powerful.\n\nThe Whoooosssshhh Effect is a very powerful thing. If you experience it once, you want more of it, even if it means sneaking out of the house for a long midnight drive. You know it’s wrong and that it could get you into trouble. But when you’re caught up in the whoooosssshhh of the moment, as I was every time I got behind the wheel of the A5 3.2 Quattro coupe, with its “meteor gray pearl effect” exterior paint and its silky six-speed automatic transmission, you just don’t care.\n\nBut all road trips end, as this one did. And it is on those homeward drives — those eventual reconnections with reality, responsibility and consequence — that the mind engages in conversation with the soul and questions previous actions. Should I have done that? Why did I do that? How long will I be able to continue getting away with doing that? When and how will this end?\n\nI entered the house quietly and ducked into the place we call the “TV room” and closed the door. I turned to one of those foreign news channels, which featured stories about Nigerian officials worrying about attacks against oil pipelines and attempts in Iraq to defend against the same.\n\nI turned off the TV, went to the bedroom and crawled into bed next to my wife.\n\n“You still up?” she asked.\n\n“Yeah,” I said. “Just wondering if Audi will ever offer that A5 in the United States with diesel, or maybe a hybrid engine . . .”",

      "expert_review": "The sport coupe is an interesting beast. It’s not a sports car, yet it’s not as practical as a four-door. Even so, Audi feels it needs one in its lineup to compete with the BMW 3 Series two-door. I’m not sure that really is a need, but image-conscious shoppers who aren’t looking for the most driving excitement may find the A5 at the top of their most-wanted list.\n\nWhy? The A5 is simply a great-looking package wrapped around a pretty useful car, even if it only has two doors. The only problem may be its pricing; when you load up the A5, its price tag may take the glimmer out of your eye.\n\nExterior\nDuring my week with the A5 there was no doubt as to its most compelling attribute, the styling. My test car was blue — specifically, Aruba Blue Metallic — which is not a normal test-car color. It was gorgeous. The other A5s I’ve seen around Chicago have been the same shade of dark gray. While that’s a handsome color, it sure screams “blah” compared to a striking color like this.\n\nReally, though, any color works on the A5 because it has a swoopy profile, a bold front end highlighted by the trademark Audi grille, and a dynamic rear with trapezoidal LED taillights. It rides low and features standard 18-inch wheels, all of which lead to a cohesive design that you can tell Audi put a lot of thought into. The BMW 3 Series two-door looks like a design afterthought, and it’s not as elegant as the A5. The G37 looks generic in comparison. The A5 stands out and, yes, many folks turned their heads when I drove through downtown Chicago during my commute.\n\nOne interesting feature is the A5’s standard glass roof. It doesn’t slide open like a moonroof, but it does crack open to let air in. It makes more of an impact inside than out, though the black roof does help break up the A5’s exterior color scheme.\n\nInterior\nIf you’re familiar with the redesigned A4’s interior, there won’t be anything too surprising in the A5. Of course, since that car hasn’t been on sale very long I guess I still have to do my job and explain the A5’s innards.\n\nAgain, my test car’s color palette influenced my opinion. Its beige leather seats and near-olive dashboard and door panels were an off-putting combination, and the drab dash color didn’t look nearly as good as Audi’s simple black. The front seats, however, are extremely comfortable, and the leather is very high-grade. Even the backseat is comfortable enough for adults during short trips. There are also electronic controls on top of the front seat that make it easy to slide it forward whether you’re in the backseat or standing outside the car waiting to get in.\n\nThe A5’s trunk, at 12 cubic feet, is spacious, though not as commodious as the A4 sedan’s, which measures 16.9 cubic feet. The A5’s rear seats also fold flat in a 60/40 split, making the coupe pretty practical.\n\nPerformance\nThe toughest aspect of the A5 for me to wrap my head around is the driving experience. Why? Because the A5 is a sleek-looking sport coupe, but it doesn’t drive like one. While the standard 265-horsepower V-6 has enough power for daily driving — especially in higher gears — it doesn’t deliver driving excitement.\n\nA six-speed manual transmission is standard, but my test car was equipped with Audi’s six-speed automatic with a manual function. Shifting was smooth between higher gears, but during around-town driving, where you’re constantly needing those first three gears, it was a bit off-putting, with noticeable delays in upshifts. Shifts came more quickly using the manual feature, but that could get frustrating during long commutes.\n\nThe A5 is also a slug leaving stoplights, with noticeable hesitation and little initial oomph, so any extra traction the standard all-wheel drive would afford from a dead stop isn’t put to the test. The BMW 335i’s turbo six-cylinder, on the other hand, consistently offers more gusto.\n\nSteering is accurate, but like most Audis there’s a lot more play in the wheel than you’d expect; you have to turn the wheel a lot to angle the car where you want it to be. Navigating parking lots requires so much turning it feels like you’re driving in a 1980s arcade game. Luckily, because the steering is light, all that turning doesn’t put stress on your arms like it would in a BMW. That makes the A5 easier to drive than the BMW 335i coupe, but less fun.\n\nThe suspension is a mix between sporty and sedate. It’s firm enough that you’ll notice bumps and other road imperfections, but supple enough for a pleasant highway ride.\n\nDepending on your daily drive, the A5 might be more your cup of tea than a more performance-oriented car would be. If you have a mostly highway or suburban commute, this middle-of-the-road ride may be for you. Plus, if you live in a poor-weather climate, the standard all-wheel drive will offer some reassurance.\n\nHowever, if you’re a city-dweller like me you’ll miss the performance benefits normally gained from a tighter suspension. In fairness, my test car did not come with the optional sport suspension, but I assume it would make it an even a harsher ride. That’s always the tradeoff involved in adding more performance. Audi also offers an optional suspension package called Audi Drive Select, which features Dynamic and Comfort modes, for an additional $2,950. That price seems high if you’re shopping an A5 versus the performance-oriented S5, which starts at $51,400. Add Audi Drive Select to the A5 and you’re only $8,000 away from an S5.\n\nFeatures\nUnlike other German brands, and even other Audis, the A5 comes rather well-equipped, with no need to add options. Most notably, you get real leather seats and that large glass roof, along with a three-zone climate system and a 10-speaker stereo with a CD player and Bluetooth. If you want heated seats, however, you’ll have to pony up an additional $1,900 for the Premium Package, which also includes the bi-xenon headlamps with LED daytime running lamps that were first used on the R8 sports car. I’m not usually a fan of fancy headlights being offered as an extra-cost option, but these add quite a bit of style to the car’s overall look.\n\nAn S Line Package is available for $2,900 and includes a sport-tuned suspension (not the Audi Drive Select mentioned above), 19-inch wheels, different front and rear bumpers, sport seats, brushed-aluminum interior inlays, a sport steering wheel, headlamp washers and a black headliner. This equipment is similar to what the more expensive S5 comes with standard. If you just want 19-inch wheels, they cost an additional $900.\n\nThe navigation system costs $2,390 and adds a six-disc CD changer. However, you must buy the Premium Package before getting the navigation system. Adaptive cruise control can be added for $2,100, as long as the car is already equipped with the navigation system. A Technology Package includes a rearview camera, adaptive headlights and a keyless start system for $2,200. And, yes, you have to get both the Premium Package and the navigation system to add it.\n\nLuckily, an upgraded Bang & Olufson 14-speaker sound system can be added to any A5 for $850, as can iPod integration for $290.\n\nThe A5 starts at $40,700, but how much does a fully loaded one cost? $57,290. An almost-identically equipped S5 costs $61,890. So while the two cars’ starting prices are more than $10,000 apart, when you load them up with goodies the difference is more than halved. And for just $4,000, the performance packed into a 354-hp S5 is definitely worth the extra cost.\n\nSafety\nThe A5 features the standard safety features you’d expect in a car of this price, including seat-mounted and side curtain airbags, plus electronic stability control. As of publication, the car had not yet been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.\n\nAudi A5 in the Market\nThe A5 fills a unique place in the luxury-car market. With car designers trying out the most extravagant styling on entire car lines, Audi has found a look that’s both striking and beautiful. It’s one of the few cars on the road today that will draw stares without being awkwardly styled.\n\nThe A5 also holds a place for buyers looking for a solid blend of performance and comfort, whereas the BMW 3 Series and Infiniti G37 are squarely aimed at enthusiast drivers. While that may keep speed demons away, the A5 remains a confident highway performer that’s also comfortable.\n\nAs usual, I find the main drawback of the A5 to be its pricing: Audi — along with other luxury German nameplates — offers expensive option packages. If you can settle for just a few minor upgrades, the A5 remains reasonably priced for what you get, but just adding navigation adds considerably to the price. At $43,000, the A5 is competitive, but at $57,000 a whole world of alternatives comes to mind. Perhaps the A5’s looks alone will outweigh its cost.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in April 2016 for the 2016 model, but little has changed for 2017. An all-new model is arriving for the 2018 model year.\n\nAudi’s compact luxury lineup is in the middle of being refreshed, with the new 2017 A4 arriving this spring. That leaves the related S4 sport sedan and A5 coupe still soldiering on as 2016 models without an update yet. There aren’t many changes for 2016 for the A5 (compare the 2015 and 2016 models here), limited to some newly standard features on the Premium and Premium Plus trim levels. We had one last look at the latest edition to see if it still can be competitive against the newest crop of compact luxury coupes, or if it’s a better idea to wait for the redesign.\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nThe A5’s shape is familiar by now, but that doesn’t make it any less attractive. My test car came in a ghostly light gray with black wheels, a combination that really sets off the subtle muscular curves of the coupe’s profile. The roof is lower than that of the A4, making it a bit of a twisting effort to get in or out, but this is the price one pays for going for the sexier coupe versus the more formal sedan.\n\nStyling doesn’t often change much from one generation to another in this category. Among German competitors, the BMW 4 Series and Mercedes-Benz C-Class look fresh but not terribly “new.” The Japanese are getting more adventurous, however, with the Lexus RC 350 and Infiniti Q60, so the pressure is starting to ratchet up for the A5’s next generation.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nMy test car was equipped with Audi’s excellent turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, putting out 220 horsepower and mated to a slick-shifting eight-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. Audi’s Quattro all-wheel drive is standard on the A5, while a six-speed manual transmission is available. The turbo four feels more powerful than numbers would suggest, with plenty of punch anywhere in the rev range and a transmission willing to kick down when you ask. Audi says that the A5 will zip from zero to 60 mph in just a hair over 6 seconds, and I don’t wonder if that’s a conservative estimate. The Audi Drive Select allows you to choose a transmission and throttle-response profile to skew it toward more aggressive performance or calmer operation. Sadly it doesn’t louden the exhaust, as it does in some of the S cars, to change the A5’s aural characteristics.\n\nThe A5 is a calmer experience than the more performance-oriented S5, with a sport suspension that’s a bit softer and oriented more toward a comfortable ride instead of pure handling prowess. The big, optional 19-inch wheels and tires on my test car were surprisingly compliant, but that may have been a factor of them being winter tires, which usually are softer than the more aggressive all-seasons that are standard on the A5. Ride and handling are well-balanced, giving the A5 more of a grand tourer vibe than a sport coupe one. It’s meant to look good first and foremost, and to provide its driver with a luxurious experience that’s a step above most mass-market cars but not as aggressively sporty as the experience provided by a BMW 4 Series or Cadillac ATS coupe.\n\nThe benefit of having so many gears to use and an efficient turbocharged motor is fuel economy that’s better than expected. The A5 is rated at 21/30/25 mpg city/highway/combined, which is competitive with rivals such as the BMW 428i xDrive (22/34/26 mpg), Cadillac ATS 2.0L Turbo Standard all-wheel drive (22/30/25 mpg) and the Lexus RC 200t (22/32/26 mpg).\n\nInterior\n\nSlide into the A5’s cozy cockpit, and everything will look familiar – especially if you’ve spent any time in an Audi A4. Shapes, materials, seats, all of it has looked like this for the better part of a decade now. It may not feel new, but it still feels good, with top -uality materials, smooth button action and assembly quality that still ranks as the benchmark for any brand on sale today. My test car included the S Line Competition Plus Package, which brings faux-suede-and-leather sport seats with embossed logos, piano-black trim and an S Line flat-bottom, three-spoke steering wheel.\n\nVisibility is decent to the front and sides, less so to the rear, where the squashed rear window and wider C-pillars make the optional blind spot monitoring system very useful. Headroom is not as copious as it is in the A4, due to the lower roofline and a moonroof that eats into precious inches.\n\nThere isn’t as much backseat room either, with a narrower seat and less legroom than the already rather cramped 2016 A4’s rear quarters. (As reported in our First Drive, however, the redesigned 2017 A4 has more backseat space.) But this isn’t the car for the young family with a child-safety seat; this is more a personal coupe for a young couple or someone single. It’s meant to carry more than two people only on rare occasions, and it can certainly do so, but those extra passengers aren’t going to want to ride any longer than necessary.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nThe A5 has the previous generation of Audi’s Multi Media Interface system, which already is being replaced in fresher Audi models, and we’ll miss it in this older form. As it sits here, the MMI is one of the easiest multimedia systems to operate, with a control knob flanked by four buttons that correspond to the four corners of the screen. It’s quick, simple, thorough and a breeze to use even when barreling down the highway, requiring a minimum of attention and very little time with your eyes off the road. Audi Connect services include Wi-Fi connectivity for onboard personal electronic devices, as well as adding Google Maps graphics for the navigation display. It’s all very cool, and fortunately that capability is set to continue with the next-generation unit. What’s missing is Apple CarPlay and Android Auto functionality, something that Audi is adding with that next-generation unit. Audi’s Bang & Olufsen sound system also is a worthwhile option, part of the Premium Plus trim level here, and it is one of the more formidable audio systems available in a luxury car.\n\nCargo & Storage\n\nThe A5’s trunk is a bit smaller than that of the A4, but it’s impressive nonetheless with 12.2 cubic feet of trunk room, expandable when the rear seats are folded. It’s good enough to fit luggage for three people without folding the backseat. It’s not as good as the BMW 428i’s 15.7 cubic feet, but it bests both the Lexus RC 200t and Cadillac ATS coupe, each of which comes with 10.4 cubic feet of trunk space.\n\nSafety\n\nThere are no published crash-test ratings for the Audi A5, but if there ever are, they will appear here.\n\nLike most German luxury cars, there are plenty of electronic safety features to be had – and they’re almost entirely extra-cost options. Front parking sensors are part of the S Line Competition Plus Package, while blind spot monitor, rear parking sensors and a backup camera are part of the Technology Package. Items such as forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning, lane departure prevention, even adaptive cruise control are not offered on the current A5. See the various standard features here.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nNearing the end of its model life cycle, the current A5 packs a lot of content into its various packages and is offered up with incentives that lower the bottom line. The base A5 starts at the Premium trim level and is available as a coupe or convertible. The coupe starts at $41,425 including destination fee, but quickly climbs as you add options. My test car rang in at a fully loaded $52,400, including a bump up to the Premium Plus trim level, which adds auto-dimming mirrors, heated external mirrors, the Bang & Olufsen sound system, keyless entry and heated seats with memory. That price also includes the Technology Package with navigation, parking sensors, blind spot assist and a color gauge cluster. It also includes the Sport Package with its sport seats, sport suspension and Audi Drive Select controls.\n\nThere are plenty of other coupes to choose from in the personal luxury segment, but for comparison we’ve chosen three that match up well. The BMW 428i, which is the two-door version of the 3 Series sedan, features a slightly more powerful turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, optional all-wheel drive and a little more interior space than the A5. It’s priced a little higher as well, starting at $44,845 for an all-wheel-drive coupe and stretching to nearly $62,000 fully loaded. But it features a lot more content than is available on the current A5. The Mercedes-Benz C-Class coupe is fully redesigned for 2016 and hasn’t yet been tested, but Cadillac’s ATS coupe is familiar to us. It’s a slick-handling, sharply styled coupe that also features a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder, but it makes 52 hp more than the A5. The all-wheel-drive ATS coupe starts at $41,440 and ranges up to more than $58,000, depending on trim and options. It’s easily a match for the BMW in athletic driving dynamics, and is definitely edgier than the A5. Finally, representing Japan, the Lexus RC 200t coupe is a dramatically styled personal luxury coupe, also featuring the standard of entry-level luxury vehicles, a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, this time pumping out 21 hp more than the A5. All-wheel drive is not an option on the four-cylinder RC coupe, however, necessitating a bump up to the RC 300 and its V-6 engine, which gets significantly worse fuel economy. As such, the RC 200t’s starting price is a little lower at $40,945, rising to just less than $49,000, a relative bargain compared with the other models. It’s generally not as athletic as the others, however, owing to its greater weight. Compare all four competitors here.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Audi A5?\n\nThe Audi A5 and its siblings were redesigned for 2018 and are derived from the A4 sedan. They’re offered in three body styles, all with standard all-wheel drive. The A5 and S5 come in coupe, convertible and four-door hatchback (Sportback) body styles; the high-performance RS5 comes in coupe and Sportback body styles.\n\nA5 models have a 248-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that works with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. The S5 has a 349-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 and an eight-speed automatic. The RS5, meanwhile, gets a 444-hp, turbocharged 2.9-liter V-6 and an eight-speed automatic. Competitors include the BMW 4 Series, Mercedes-Benz C-Class coupe and Infiniti Q60. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2019 Audi A5?\n\nPark assist is now standard on Prestige models, and a new Black Optic Plus Package is available on the A5 coupe and Sportback with black exterior and interior trim, a sport suspension, 19-inch wheels and summer tires. The RS5 gains a Sportback model, and the Virtual Cockpit and MMI navigation systems are now standard. New Alu Optic and Black Optic packages for the RS5 add 20-inch forged wheels, plus carbon-fiber and gloss-black exterior trim.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Audi A5 Are Most Important?\n\nThis lineup provides capable handling in different weather conditions with its standard all-wheel drive, but Audi also offers a variety of suspension options, including an adaptive suspension and sport (meaning stiffer) setup, depending on the model.\n\nThe available Virtual Cockpit has a 12.3-inch configurable display that shows high-quality graphics ranging from traditional analog gauges to a full-width navigation display. Standard safety features include Audi Pre Sense City, which can detect a collision and automatically apply the brakes. Blind spot warning, rear cross-traffic alert, adaptive cruise control and lane departure warning are available. \n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Audi A5?\n\nThere are many things to like about this line of cars — styling, performance, interior quality, and features such as Virtual Cockpit. However, it's short on practicality, with a tight backseat that's short on headroom. Many cars that cost around $50,000 leave us expecting more for that much money, but the A5 and its siblings provide enough of a driving and luxury experience to warrant strong consideration.",

      "expert_review": "Most significant changes: Four-cylinder models (40 TFSI and 45 TFSI) gain a 12-volt mild-hybrid system and 13 additional horsepower;. A4 40 TFSI models gain standard Quattro all-wheel drive; A5 Sportback gains a 40 TFSI Quattro model\n\nPrice change: Up to $1,700 on A4 variants; $400 to $1,100 increase on A5 variants except Sportback TFSI 45 ($1,100 decrease)\n\nOn sale: Second half of 2020\n\nWhich should you buy, 2020 or 2021? For the A4 and S4, a 2021 is the better bet if 2020 prices remain the same at dealerships. The added standard features in the A5 and S5 also make the price increases seem modest and worthwhile, and there’s a new more affordable Sportback option.\n\nAudi’s 2021 A4, A4 Allroad, S4, A5 and S5 gain some interesting powertrain updates, a new base model for the A5 Sportback and some reconfigured features depending on trim level.\n\nRelated: Audi A6: Which Should You Buy, 2020 or 2021?\n\nElectrification\n\nThe most significant change to this family of vehicles is that the two available four-cylinder engines, which Audi labels as the 40 TFSI and the more-powerful 45 TFSI in its unhelpful shorthand, gain a 12-volt mild-hybrid system and a 13-hp increase in power. The A4 40 TFSI also gains standard Quattro all-wheel drive, which explains why it is the only one of the A4 sedans to experience any price increase, jumping up $1,700 in price to $40,095 (including $995 destination fee).\n\nNew Base Model\n\nThe A5 Sportback adds a new base model, driven by the less powerful 40 TFSI four-cylinder engine. It’s priced from $42,795, which is a decrease of $1,100 from the lowest-priced 2020 A5 Sportback (which was also powered by the more-powerful 45 TFSI four-cylinder).\n\nNew Features, Standard and Optional\n\nNew standard equipment across both model families includes wireless Apple CarPlay, lane departure warning and an integrated toll module. The optional Convenience Package now includes both a heated steering wheel and front and rear parking sensors. The mid-level Premium Plus trim level adds standard features including adaptive cruise control, lane keeping assist, a top-down camera view and a steering wheel capable of detecting whether the driver’s hands are on the wheel. Prestige trim level models of the A4, S4, and A5 and S5 Sportback models — those with four doors, essentially — gain standard heated rear seats.\n\nNew Exterior Look, Too\n\nFor 2021, A4 and A5 45 TFSI models in the Premium Plus and Prestige trim levels can now be equipped with an optional Black Optic appearance package that adds black exterior accents and, for the A4, either unique 18-inch wheels with all-season tires or 19-inch wheels with summer tires; A5 models get unique 19-inch wheels with summer tires as part of the package. Also new for 2021, A5 and S5 coupe models with this appearance package can wear an optional black roof.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2020 Audi E-Tron Sportback Priced From $78,395\nHow Do You Pronounce Audi Properly?\n2021 Audi A3: Everything We Know Ahead of Small Sedan’s U.S. Arrival\n2020 Audi Q7: Everything You Need to Know\n2021 Audi RS 6 Avant Price and Specs: Go-Fast Grocery Getter Goes for $110K\n2021 Audi A4 | Manufacturer image\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Audi A5?\n\nFor luxury-car shoppers who like choices, the Audi A5 is offered as a coupe, convertible (Cabriolet) and four-door hatchback (Sportback). In the A5 Sportback, the standard engine is a 201-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder coupled with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. A 261-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder is the base engine in the coupe and convertible. All three come standard with Audi’s Quattro all-wheel-drive system. Performance fans can opt for an S5, which is available in all three body styles and features a 349-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 engine, eight-speed automatic transmission, firmer suspension and upgraded brakes. If that’s not enough, the high-performance RS 5 gets a 444-hp, twin-turbo 2.9-liter V-6 and other performance upgrades, though it’s offered only as a coupe or hatchback. The A5 family’s rivals include the Mercedes-Benz C-Class, BMW 4 Series, Lexus IS and Acura Integra. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Audi A5?\n\nAll models and trims except the base A5 Sportback 40 get additional standard features for 2024, including adaptive cruise control, lane departure steering assist, parking assist and a heated steering wheel with hands-on detection. The Navigation Package that’s optional on the Premium Plus trim and standard on Prestige versions gets added functionality, including traffic sign recognition that activates predictive adaptive cruise control. Navigation-equipped models now come with a six-month trial subscription to Audi Connect Plus, making music, video, gaming, navigation and other apps accessible through the center touchscreen.  \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Audi A5 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nAWD\nTri-zone climate control\nLED headlights with high-beam assist\nLeather seats\nHeated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\n10.1-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nPower-operated trunk lid\nAdaptive cruise control\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure warning\nLane departure steering assist\nParking assist \n\nAvailable features include:\n\nAudi Virtual Cockpit with 12.3-inch instrument panel screen\nVentilated front seats\n360-degree camera system\nHead-up display\nBang & Olufsen premium stereo\nRear cross-traffic alert\nBlind spot warning\nShould I Buy the 2024 Audi A5?\n\nThe A5 offers sleek styling in the coupe, open-air thrills in the convertible, and a roomier backseat and spacious trunk in the four-door Sportback. The S5 and RS 5 offer higher levels of performance and, not surprisingly, significantly steeper price tags. Engine refinement is excellent, and cabin quality helps the A5 stand out among some very worthy competitors. Keep in mind, though, that the coupe’s and convertible’s backseats are snug for taller adults, and luggage space is especially dear in the drop-top A5. Even with added standard equipment on most models for 2024, Audi would be smart to include even more standard safety features, like blind spot warning and rear cross-traffic alert.",

      "expert_review": "Verdict: The Audi A5 is a perfectly pleasant, if dated, personal luxury coupe.\n\nVersus the Competition: The A5 is less powerful than just about any of its competitors, but it doesn’t feel slower. The A5 is soon to be redesigned, but right now its equipment and safety systems are outmatched by the older body-types like the BMW 4 Series, Lexus RC, Cadillac ATS and the newly updated Mercedes-Benz C-Class coupe.\n\nAudi’s compact luxury lineup is in the middle of being refreshed, with the new 2017 A4 arriving this spring. That leaves the related S4 sport sedan and A5 coupe still soldiering on as 2016 models without an update yet. There aren’t many changes for 2016 for the A5 (compare the 2015 and 2016 models here), limited to some newly standard features on the Premium and Premium Plus trim levels. We had one last look at the latest edition to see if it still can be competitive against the newest crop of compact luxury coupes, or if it’s a better idea to wait for the redesign.\nExterior & Styling\nThe Audi A5’s shape is familiar by now, but that doesn’t make it any less attractive. My test car came in a ghostly light gray with black wheels, a combination that really sets off the subtle muscular curves of the coupe’s profile. The roof is lower than that of the A4, making it a bit of a twisting effort to get in or out, but this is the price one pays for going for the sexier coupe versus the more formal sedan.\n\nStyling doesn’t often change much from one generation to another in this category. Among German competitors, the BMW 4 Series and Mercedes-Benz C-Class look fresh but not terribly “new.” The Japanese are getting more adventurous, however, with the Lexus RC 350 and Infiniti Q60, so the pressure is starting to ratchet up for the A5’s next generation.\nHow It Drives\nMy test car was equipped with Audi’s excellent turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, putting out 220 horsepower and mated to a slick-shifting eight-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. Audi’s Quattro all-wheel drive is standard on the A5, while a six-speed manual transmission is available. The turbo four feels more powerful than numbers would suggest, with plenty of punch anywhere in the rev range and a transmission willing to kick down when you ask. Audi says that the A5 will zip from zero to 60 mph in just a hair over 6 seconds, and I don’t wonder if that’s a conservative estimate. The Audi Drive Select allows you to choose a transmission and throttle-response profile to skew it toward more aggressive performance or calmer operation. Sadly it doesn’t louden the exhaust, as it does in some of the S cars, to change the A5’s aural characteristics.\n\nThe Audi A5 is a calmer experience than the more performance-oriented Audi S5, with a sport suspension that’s a bit softer and oriented more toward a comfortable ride instead of pure handling prowess. The big, optional 19-inch alloy wheels and tires on my test car were surprisingly compliant, but that may have been a factor of them being winter tires, which usually are softer than the more aggressive all-seasons that are standard on the A5. Ride and handling are well-balanced, giving the A5 more of a grand tourer vibe than a sport coupe one. It’s meant to look good first and foremost, and to provide its driver with a luxurious experience that’s a step above most mass-market cars but not as aggressively sporty as the experience provided by a BMW 4 Series or Cadillac ATS coupe.\n\nThe benefit of having so many gears to use and an efficient turbocharged motor is fuel economy that’s better than expected. The A5 is rated at 21/30/25 mpg city/highway/combined, which is competitive with rivals such as the BMW 428i xDrive (22/34/26 mpg), Cadillac ATS 2.0L Turbo Standard all-wheel drive (22/30/25 mpg) and the Lexus RC 200t (22/32/26 mpg). \nInterior\nSlide into the A5’s cozy cockpit, and everything will look familiar – especially if you’ve spent any time in an Audi A4. Shapes, materials, seats, all of it has looked like this for the better part of a decade now. It may not feel new, but it still feels good, with top -uality materials, smooth button action and assembly quality that still ranks as the benchmark for any brand on sale today. My test car included the S Line Competition Plus Package, which brings faux-suede-and-leather sport seats with embossed logos, piano-black trim and an S Line flat-bottom, three-spoke steering wheel.\n\nVisibility is decent to the front and sides, less so to the rear, where the squashed rear window and wider C-pillars make the optional blind spot monitoring system very useful. Headroom is not as copious as it is in the A4, due to the lower roofline and a moonroof that eats into precious inches.\n\nThere isn’t as much backseat room either, with a narrower seat and less legroom than the already rather cramped 2016 A4’s rear quarters. (As reported in our First Drive, however, the redesigned 2017 A4 has more backseat space.) But this isn’t the car for the young family with a child-safety seat; this is more a personal coupe for a young couple or someone single. It’s meant to carry more than two people only on rare occasions, and it can certainly do so, but those extra passengers aren’t going to want to ride any longer than necessary.\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe A5 has the previous generation of Audi’s Multi Media Interface system, which already is being replaced in fresher Audi models, and we’ll miss it in this older form. As it sits here, the MMI is one of the easiest multimedia systems to operate, with a control knob flanked by four buttons that correspond to the four corners of the screen. It’s quick, simple, thorough and a breeze to use even when barreling down the highway, requiring a minimum of attention and very little time with your eyes off the road. Audi Connect services include Wi-Fi connectivity for onboard personal electronic devices, as well as adding Google Maps graphics for the navigation display. It’s all very cool, and fortunately that capability is set to continue with the next-generation unit. What’s missing is Apple CarPlay and Android Auto functionality, something that Audi is adding with that next-generation unit. Audi’s Bang & Olufsen sound system also is a worthwhile option, part of the Premium Plus trim level here, and it is one of the more formidable audio systems available in a luxury car.\nCargo & Storage\nThe Audi A5’s trunk is a bit smaller than that of the A4, but it’s impressive nonetheless with 12.2 cubic feet of trunk room, expandable when the rear seats are folded. It’s good enough to fit luggage for three people without folding the backseat. It’s not as good as the BMW 428i’s 15.7 cubic feet, but it bests both the Lexus RC 200t and Cadillac ATS coupe, each of which comes with 10.4 cubic feet of trunk space.\n\nSafety\nThere are no published crash-test ratings for the Audi A5, but if there ever are, they will appear here.\n\nLike most German luxury cars, there are plenty of electronic safety features to be had – and they’re almost entirely extra-cost options. Front parking sensors are part of the S Line Competition Plus Package, while blind spot monitor, rear parking sensors and a backup camera are part of the Technology Package. Items such as forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning, lane departure prevention, even adaptive cruise control are not offered on the current A5. See the various standard features here.\nValue in Its Class\nNearing the end of its model life cycle, the current Audi A5 packs a lot of content into its various packages and is offered up with incentives that lower the bottom line. The base A5 starts at the Premium trim level and is available as a coupe or convertible (cabriolet). The coupe starts at $41,425 including destination fee, but quickly climbs as you add options, including the convertible (cabriolet) option. My test car rang in at a fully loaded $52,400, including a bump up to the Premium Plus trim level, which adds auto-dimming mirrors, heated external mirrors, the Bang & Olufsen sound system, keyless entry and heated seats with memory. That price also includes the Technology Package with navigation, parking sensors, blind spot assist and a color gauge cluster. It also includes the Sport Package with its sport seats, sport suspension and Audi Drive Select controls.\n\nThere are plenty of other coupes to choose from in the personal luxury segment, but for comparison we’ve chosen three that match up well (non of which come with front-wheel-drive). The BMW 428i, which is the two-door version of the 3 Series sedan, features a slightly more powerful turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-4 cylinder engine, optional all-wheel drive and a little more interior space than the Audi A5 with quattro AWD. It’s priced a little higher as well, starting at $44,845 for an all-wheel-drive coupe and stretching to nearly $62,000 fully loaded. But it features a lot more content than is available on the current A5. The Mercedes-Benz C-Class coupe is fully redesigned for 2016 and hasn’t yet been tested, but Cadillac’s ATS coupe is familiar to us. It’s a slick-handling, sharply styled coupe that also features a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder, but it makes 52 hp more than the Audi A5. The all-wheel-drive ATS coupe starts at $41,440 and ranges up to more than $58,000, depending on trim and options. It’s easily a match for the BMW in athletic driving dynamics, and is definitely edgier than the A5. Finally, representing Japan, the Lexus RC 200t coupe is a dramatically styled personal luxury coupe, also featuring the standard of entry-level luxury vehicles, a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, this time pumping out 21 hp more than the A5. All-wheel drive is not an option on the four-cylinder RC coupe, however, necessitating a bump up to the RC 300 and its V-6 engine, which gets significantly worse fuel economy. As such, the RC 200t’s starting price is a little lower at $40,945, rising to just less than $49,000, a relative bargain compared with the other models. It’s generally not as athletic as the others, however, owing to its greater weight. Compare all four competitors here.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Are the Audi A5 and S5 Good Compact Luxury Sedans?\n\nThe redesigned 2025 A5 and S5 are exceptionally good luxury sedans. Both are roomy, handle well, and have at least adequate power and mostly excellent tech. The touch-sensitive steering wheel and door-panel controls are frustrating, however.\n\nHow Do the Audi A5 and S5 Compare With Other Compact Luxury Sedans?\n\nThe A5 may trail the Genesis G70’s base engine in power a bit, but it feels more refined, and the S5 has enough get-up-and-go to keep up with other mid-level sports sedans. Both Audis have excellent, luxurious interiors and technology that match or best anything from competitors.\n\nThe redesigned 2025 Audi A5 and S5 replace both the previous A5 and the A4 family of sedans — which are both also being sold as 2025 models. Confusing? We think so. But here’s what you need to know: The new A5 and S5 have “more” than their predecessors in just about every way, including physical size, power and technology. Does that mean the new 2025 A5 and S5 are better than the two model lines they’re replacing?\n\nTo find out, I headed to Colorado to drive them on open highways and snow-lined mountain roads (per Cars.com’s ethics policy, we pay for our travel and lodging costs when attending such manufacturer-sponsored events).\n\nRelated: All-New 2025 Audi A5 Replaces Previous A5 and A4\n\nIn this review, assume that I’m talking about the new 2025 A5 and S5 unless specifically stated otherwise. The new sedans use a new platform, dubbed Premium Platform Combustion, that embiggens the car in pretty much every dimension: The 2025 A5 and S5 are wider, taller, longer and have a longer wheelbase than their predecessors. Both new sedans also have more power, with the A5’s turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder now making 268 horsepower and 295 pounds-feet of torque, increases of 7 hp and 22 pounds-feet. The S5, meanwhile, retains a turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 with 362 hp and 406 pounds-feet of torque, which is up 13 hp and 37 pounds-feet. The other major change is the addition of the new Audi Digital Stage infotainment suite, which incorporates an 11.9-inch digital instrument panel and a new 14.5-inch center touchscreen.\n\nThis review is based on my experience with the top Prestige trim levels of the 2025 A5 and S5. The as-tested price of the A5 I drove was $58,840, while the S5 came to $73,940 (all prices include a $1,295 destination fee).\n\nRelated Video:\n\nHow Are the New Interiors of the 2025 Audi A5 and S5?\n\nThe biggest news, to me, is that both the A5 and S5 are luxury compact sedans that let me actually fit in the backseat with the front seat adjusted to my driving position. The added length and longer wheelbase, along with increased height, turn the backseat from a penalty box to a usable space for adults. I’m 6-foot-1, and I used all of the available headroom in the back (thank you, sloping roofline), but I prefer that to having my legs squished.\n\nThe dramatic interior improvements in both models don’t stop with just increased space; the new Audi Digital Stage is a massive improvement over the previous screen tech. We always prefer physical climate controls, which the prior A5 and S5 had, but the dedicated and easy-to-use climate-control bar at the bottom of the center touchscreen is much better than what Audi uses in some of its models: a secondary touchscreen that was also a fingerprint and smudge magnet. Dynamic interior lighting provides visual cues for safety systems and car actions — green lights appear to indicate a turn signal, for instance — and they’re a helpful visual cue so you don’t accidentally leave that turn signal on.\n\nMaterials quality is excellent in both the A5 and S5, with the A5 a more traditionally luxurious space with wood accents while the S5 replaces the wood with carbon fiber and adds simulated-suede trim. The sportier front seats in the S5 were a bit too aggressively bolstered for my tastes and not as comfortable for longer driving as the A5’s seats. There’s more cargo space by Audi’s measurements — we still need to measure the cargo area using our methodology — but anecdotally, it seems extremely usable in an almost hatchback-like way, and the low load floor and wide opening are significant pluses.\n\nThe A5 and S5 interiors also have some quirky features. An available 10.9-inch front passenger display is one of the most obvious, and it’s frustratingly visible in certain situations while driving. I’d much prefer this secondary screen remain hidden from the driver at all times. The available panoramic glass roof with variable light control is also a very interesting choice. Rather than opening, the panel’s transparency is adjustable; it’s a fun party trick, but I’d rather have the option of fresh air. Most aggravating, however, are the touch-sensitive controls on the steering wheel and driver’s door. The controls are clumsier than physical buttons, switches and knobs, and the steering-wheel controls are prone to inadvertent activation while driving, which can be frustrating and distracting.\n\nHow Does the 2025 Audi A5 Drive?\n\nPowertrain upgrades are less dramatic, but they give the A5 a refined and capable engine that’s more than enough for a daily driver, even if it doesn’t have class-leading power. Power figures are roughly mid-pack for the class, and while the A5’s 268 hp and 295 pounds-feet of torque represent a modest improvement over previous models, the refinement of its turbo four-cylinder is more impressive.\n\nThe A5’s longer wheelbase also contributes to a more comfortable ride, with excellent isolation inside the cabin — even with a conventional steel-spring suspension. Steering and suspension enhancements make the driving experience more engaging, but the A5 is at its best as a comfortable cruiser, not as a sports sedan.\n\nHow Does the 2025 Audi S5 Drive?\n\nThat’s where the S5 comes in. With 362 hp and 406 pounds-feet of torque from its turbo 3.0-liter V-6, the S5 hustles up and down mountain roads easily. A manufacturer-estimated 4.3-second 0-60 mph time feels achievable if not beatable. Audi’s steering and suspension enhancements here allow for a much more confident driving experience, with significantly increased feel and communication. The available adaptive suspension that was on the car I drove still retains a measure of comfort, too, even in its most aggressive setting.\n\nThe S5 is meant to be a bridge between the comfortable A5 and a (currently hypothetical) RS 5 high-performance variant, and it’s at the center of the Venn diagram of Audi models: regular models on the left, RS models on the right and S models in between.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2025 Audi Q5 and SQ5 Review: Bolder, Mostly Better\nNew 2025 Audi A5 and S5 Get Modest Bump in Price\n2025 Audi A3 and S3 Review: Dynamic Duo\nAll-New 2026 Audi A6: Refining a Sports Sedan Favorite\nShop for a 2025 Audi A5 Near You\nAre the 2025 Audi A5 and S5 Better?\n\nSo, are the bigger, all-new 2025 A5 and S5 better than their predecessors? The answer is an emphatic yes. The consolidation of model lines into one capable liftback sedan lineup feels smart in this SUV-heavy era, and the larger Premium Platform Combustion architecture provides a host of improvements. The price you pay for those improvements is some confounding controls, but it’s worth it.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Redesigned for 2018, the Audi A5 coupe looks similar to the previous generation, but don’t let that fool you — the A5 is improved in many facets and better than ever before.\n\nThe two-door Audi A5 shares a lot of mechanical similarities with the four-door A4 sedan, which was redesigned in 2017 and recently took home the crown in our Luxury Sports Sedan Challenge. This was a big leap for the A4, which placed fifth out of six contestants in the previous Challenge in 2013. The A5 had to wait an extra year to get its redesign, but the changes mimic what was done to the A4, and that’s an excellent place to start. Compare the 2018 A5 with last year’s model here.\n\nThe A5 Coupe competes with other compact luxury coupes, like the BMW 4 Series, Mercedes-Benz C-Class coupe and Infiniti Q60, and the A5 Sportback. Compare the A5 with those cars here.\n\nPerformance\n\nThe Audi A5 comes equipped with a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that’s a mainstay of the Audi lineup. It makes 252 horsepower and 273 lb-ft of torque, and it comes tied to a six-speed manual or seven-speed automatic transmission. My test vehicle came with the automatic transmission and all-wheel drive, which is standard on all A5s.\n\nI’m a big fan of this engine, which punches above its weight on the spec sheet and is very responsive. I even liked it in the large Q7 three-row SUV, so in this application it more than does the trick. The coupe is very responsive to accelerator inputs, especially in Dynamic mode, and it accelerates quickly at all speeds.\n\nMy test vehicle also came equipped with an adaptive suspension, which is a $1,000 stand-alone option. Adaptive suspensions are among the components I wish were more widespread, especially in cars with a performance focus. An adaptive suspension allows a car to have a dual nature: comfortable when desired and firmer for sportier moments. The A5 isn’t an out-and-out performance machine like the S5, so offering it with a setting that allows for better cruising makes a lot of sense. Our Chicago-based editors warned that they drove an A5 with the optional sport suspension, which isn’t adaptive, and it was too firm for their embattled roads.\n\nIf the A5 Coupe falls short in one area, it’s steering feel. Even moving the A5 into Dynamic mode — which also increases throttle sensitivity and tightens up the suspension — doesn’t cure this. It does add more weight to the steering, which is nice when traveling straight, as it helps keep the car going straight with less effort, but there’s still some disconnect between the driver and the wheels.\n\nFuel-economy figures for the new Audi A5 are an EPA-estimated 24/34/27 mpg city/highway/combined for the hardtop coupe. The manual loses 1 mpg on the highway. Premium gasoline is required.\n\nDoes It Come With Instructions?\n\nThe new Audi A5’s interior also apes the best parts of the A4: high-quality materials, excellent fit and finish, and a big emphasis on technology. The rather comprehensive Prestige Package ($7,600) adds heated front leather seats, LED headlights, an upgraded sound system, a head-up display, 360-degree cameras, navigation and Audi Virtual Cockpit, a large color screen that serves as your instrument panel (separate from the display mid-dash).\n\nThere’s a lot of technology in the Audi A5 (especially with the Prestige Package), but using it can be cumbersome in some cases. For example, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay come standard, which is good. But the A5’s screen (as is true in many Audi models) is mounted high up on the dash and out of reach, and it isn’t even a touchscreen. So to use those systems, which have clearly been designed for touchscreens, you have to resort to the multifunction rotary dial controller. As with many of the A5’s technology features, the functionality is there, but getting to it can be a chore.\n\nVirtual Cockpit replaces the instrument panel with a 12.3-inch display that’s highly customizable: The tachometer and speedometer can be shrunk to open a larger display area showing things like vehicle status or your choice of map or Google Earth views. Interestingly, though, if Android Auto is activated, the Google Earth view and navigation map views are disabled and you’ll see only a large, comparatively useless compass in the virtual cockpit.\n\nUltimately, none of these quirks were deal-breakers for me; the system is fast and responsive to inputs, minimizing the nuisance of having multilayered menus. The other technology additions are welcomed additions and the inclusion of a 360-degree camera system (even on a smaller car like this) is always welcome.\n\nHow’s the Space?\n\nIf there’s a weakness to the Audi A5 interior, it’s backseat room. The car’s low-slung proportions make it a tight squeeze back there, and while there’s enough space to navigate the legroom issues if both passengers collaborate, the larger issue is headroom. The roof fed into the rear window right where my head sat (I’m 5-foot-11), impeding headroom. I had to slouch a bit to feel comfortable and not worry about the top of my head bonking the glass if we hit an unexpected bump.\n\nTrunk volume is 11.6 cubic feet, slightly below the A4 sedan’s 13.0 cubic feet. While the cargo area isn’t very tall, it is deep, so it swallows up luggage nicely. Dropping two segments of the 40/20/40-split rear-seat also allowed me to fit three golf bags in back, which nicely matched the number of occupants who could still fit inside.\n\nSafety and Driver Aids\n\nMy test vehicle came equipped with a Driver Assistance Package ($1,800) that added adaptive cruise control (which operates to a stop), lane keep assist, high beam assist, blind spot detection and traffic sign recognition. Audi’s systems work as advertised. The lane keep assist operates subtly under most circumstances, keeping the car centered in its lane, not merely correcting after it strays.\n\nThere was one feature, however, that I was not ready for: The adaptive cruise control works with traffic sign recognition to power a feature Audi calls Predictive Control. When activated, the system changes the speed of the adaptive cruise control when it detects a change in the speed limit. So if you’re cruising along at 65 mph and pass a sign dropping the speed limit to 45 mph, the system adjusts accordingly. There are ups and downs to this system, which I detail here, but I’d leave it turned off the vast majority of the time; managing speed is something I still like to do myself at this point.\n\nValue\n\nThe 2018 Audi A5 starts at $43,775 including destination, but my test vehicle gleefully tacked on options to bump the as-tested price to $55,300. Additions included the two big option packages mentioned (Prestige Package and Driver Assistance Package), as well as Glacier White Metallic paint ($575), an adaptive suspension ($1,000), Dark Brown walnut wood interior accents ($350) and a heated steering wheel ($200).\n\nThere are many times when these heavily optioned luxury vehicles don’t feel as though they match up to their lofty price tags, but the Audi A5 was the opposite for me. Interior materials are up to snuff, performance is impressive and technology is plentiful. My only hang-up would be a preference for the added utility of an Audi A4: greater passenger and cargo room, with analogous performance. Either way, though, you’ll end up with a winner.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2022 Audi A5?\n\nThe Audi A5 is available in three distinct body styles — coupe, convertible and four-door hatchback (Sportback) — and all come with standard all-wheel drive.\n\nThe base A5 engine is a 201-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that works with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. One step higher is a 261-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder paired with the same gearbox.\n\nAt the top of the performance lineup is the S5, which comes with a 349-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 engine and an eight-speed automatic transmission. Competitors include the BMW 4 Series and Infiniti Q60.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2022 Audi A5?\n\nS line versions of the coupe and Sportback now come with a sport suspension. There’s also a new Black Optic Plus Package that includes black bumper accents, a matte-black grille with black badging, black mirror caps, black side sill blades and red-painted brake calipers. The S5 adds standard 19-inch wheels.\n\nWhat Features in the 2022 Audi A5 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nLED headlights with high-beam assist\nLeather seats\nHeated front seats\n1-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nAndroid Auto and wireless Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure warning\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nAudi Virtual Cockpit with 12.3-inch instrument panel screen\nVentilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nAdaptive cruise control\n360-degree camera system\nHead-up display\nBang & Olufsen premium stereo\nBlind spot warning\nShould I Buy the 2022 Audi A5?\n\nThe Audi A5 certainly spoils car shoppers for choice with its range of available body styles, but it comes up short on practicality due to a tight backseat that skimps on headroom. Trunk space in the convertible is also minimal. If you don’t need acres of space and want a refined luxury car with all-wheel drive and a classy cabin, the A5, in all its various forms, is worth a look.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in August 2010 about the 2010 Audi A5. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2012, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the three model years.\n\nI was impressed with the A5’s stunning looks when it debuted for 2008, but I didn’t like its 3.2-liter V-6. It lacked excitement, and even though it’s the more powerful of two available engines, the coupe felt too heavy with it inside. Fellow editor Kelsey Mays reviewed the A5 Cabriolet convertible last year and found the A5’s base 2.0-liter turbo maladjusted, which is strange because our staff universally loves that engine in the A4, as well as other Audis and VWs of various shapes and sizes.\n\nI discovered that the car is at its best in its most affordable, least powerful guise: the A5 2.0T. This one’s just right.\n\nSee all A5 trim levels and body styles compared here.\n\nPerformance\nIn the car world — especially the sports car world — the thinking is that the more powerful the engine, the better the driving experience. Audi’s 2.0-liter turbo four-cylinder is one exception, especially compared with the other engine offered in the A5: the 3.2-liter six-cylinder. (If you want brute force and enthusiast thrills, check out our review of the Audi S5 here.)\n\nThe 2.0-liter revs happily and gets you up to speed lickety-split. It might not have the low-end power of the 3.2, but neither does it have any of the accelerator lag exhibited by the A5 3.2 I drove. My test car had the standard six-speed manual, which is a joy to drive. The clutch is light and the shifter pops into each gate with precise, light throws.\n\nThis is the manual transmission you want if you do a lot of commuting — and as the master of the 60-minute commute in the Cars.com offices, I am best qualified to offer this assessment.\n\nSteering is in the traditional Audi vein: power-assisted to an extreme at low speeds, with a more precise feel at higher speeds. What this does is rid you of the heavy lifting you need to do to navigate a BMW 3 Series up a parking structure.\n\nThe ride was also fairly comfortable in daily driving. The structure feels rigid, but you don’t feel major road imperfections, like bridge joints, as severely as you do in the BMW competition. The Infiniti G37 also has a nice balance of ride comfort and performance, with a nicer exhaust and more grunt under the hood.\n\nLooks\nWhat neither the BMW 3 coupe nor the G37 coupe has, though, is the A5’s looks. The car is stunning, and after more than a year on the market, it still received praise from my neighbors and family members.\n\nI don’t think I need to elaborate on this section; just take a look at the pretty pictures.\n\nInterior\nAudi’s interior looks neat, orderly and simple. Could it be a little bit more luxurious for its as-tested $40,000 price tag? Perhaps, especially around the doors, but overall I was focused on the stylish gauges, the sophisticated entertainment and navigation system, and the road, as a driver should be.\n\nThose features also make up for the two small rear seats, which are nearly impossible to use.\n\nOne drawback, though, is getting in and out. The A5 is a step better than the Chevy Corvette in terms of having to fold your body to get in and out of it, but that’s not much of a compliment. More extreme sports cars are easier to jump into than the A5, which might make this otherwise mainstream vehicle attractive to fewer buyers. My wife especially can’t stand this attribute — she still remembers/loathes the Corvette Z06 and BMW 6 Series — even when she’s not wearing high heels or a dress.\n\nCargo\nThe trunk has a nice, rectangular shape that makes the 12.0 cubic feet of cargo space in there extremely usable, as there aren’t any odd cutouts or wasted space. The rear seats might be useless for passengers, but at least they fold down to expand the cargo area.\n\nSafety\nThe A5 comes with standard front airbags, seat-mounted side airbags for the driver and passenger, and side curtain airbags for both rows. The A5 has not been crash-tested by either the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.\n\nAudi A5 in the Market\nIt’s pretty easy to pen this section, because the A5 has already proved itself in the market as a strong seller. The 2.0T is the least expensive version, starting at $36,000 with the manual transmission. Our test car had navigation and an optional Prestige Package, which ratcheted the price up above $43,000. That’s a lot of money for a four-cylinder engine, even if it is a really good one.\n\nBut at least you don’t need to go any higher than that; the styling and combination of everyday driving comfort and just-enough thrills make a convincing argument not to upgrade to a 3.2.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "Now that my kids are out of child-safety seats, I looked forward to test-driving the 2013 Audi A5 coupe, an unconventional choice for a family car. I assumed that a coupe would work well for my kids at least until they were gangly teenagers, and for the most part, it did. As many families know, an ideal vehicle can be as transitional as the jeans you bought your kid at the beginning of the school year: Don’t be surprised if they don’t fit by December.\n\nThe 2013 Audi A5 coupe caters to adults with its luxurious finish and turbocharged engine; the backseat isn’t an afterthought, but it’s not suited to children in child-safety seats.\n\nIt was love at first drive with the A5. It could have been its 211-horsepower, turbocharged four-cylinder engine or how well it handled at higher speeds. The A5 coupe could take whatever I threw at it; it has plenty of power, suburb braking and solid, communicative steering.\n\nThe 2013 Audi A5 coupe starts at $38,745, including an $895 destination charge, but I’d need my wallet to grow a bit to accommodate my test car’s optional features. The $48,560 price tag on my test car included the Premium Plus and navigation packages.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe 2013 A5 coupe has a restyled front grille, hood and bumper. It’s still sharp and sleek looking, and the A5 still looks like it wants to eat you for lunch. The most noticeable difference is the LEDs’ new pattern around the headlights. They almost completely surround the headlights, as opposed to the more eyebrow-like effect of the previous A5’s look.\n\nThe coupe’s crux is that while it looks great, getting in is a hassle. My kids, ages 8 and 10, were able to reach the door handle when inside the cabin and could get themselves in and out of the A5 without issue. Yours may not be able to do so. My kids had to be patient with one another while operating the seat mechanism to move it forward and back. Those with kids in child-safety seats will be doing some heavy lifting and also gymnastics to get kids in and out of the A5.\n\nThe A5 coupe has a roomy enough trunk that can handle a run to the grocery store or a single stroller. And if you need more room, the backseat folds flat for more cargo space.\n\nWhat made this mom happy is the A5 coupe’s Quattro all-wheel drive that’s paired with a 211-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine. It was marvelously nimble. The A5 gets an EPA-estimated 20/30 mpg city/highway, and it uses premium fuel.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Not Really\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Groove-On\n\nINTERIOR\nThe Audi A5’s interior is understated. It’s sophisticated but not posh. The leather is soft and plentiful, and the instrument cluster and dash are sporty, reminding me this car has some gusto.\n\nMy test car had standard heated leather seats that were sculpted and bolstered. I’ve spent enough time in Audis to finally be comfortable with the Multi Media Interface system that controls the optional navigation system among other things. MMI often requires a good investment of time to become completely comfortable with it.\n\nThere are two cupholders for the front row and a long, narrow compartment next to them can hold a gadget or other small items. It also has narrow door pockets, a center console and a small glove box. The overall storage is limited and relies on you to edit what you bring along to the car. With that said, what’s there is thoughtful and well-placed.\n\nThis idea continues in the backseat. The sides of the rear seats have pockets to store more small items. This coupe only has four seats, with a console between the two rear passengers. The console is really just a shallow tray with a grippy liner in it, but there’s also a fold-down armrest that has stowed cupholders.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair-Ample\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2013 A5 has two sets of Audi’s brilliant Latch anchors in the backseat. The anchors sit in open and have plastic covers that are easily removed, and there’s no digging between seat cushions to access them. Because of the rear seats’ depth, a booster seat fit OK as long as it’s not too wide. With the front passenger seat moved forward to accommodate a rear-facing infant-safety seat, front passenger legroom can be compromised. At 5 feet 5 inches tall, I had enough legroom, but taller people will want to double-check those seats.\n\nThe A5 coupe has standard all-wheel drive, four-wheel-disc antilock brakes with brake assist, an electronic stability system with traction control and seven airbags, including a driver’s knee airbag and side curtains for both rows. Adaptive cruise control, xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights and a backup camera with parking sensors are optional.\n\nNeither the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety nor the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has crash-tested the 2013 A5 coupe.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2013 Audi A5 here.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Audi A5?\n\nFor luxury car shoppers who like choices, the Audi A5 is offered as a coupe, convertible (Cabriolet) and four-door hatchback (Sportback). In the A5 Sportback, the standard engine is a 201-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder coupled with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission; a 261-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder is the base engine in the coupe and convertible. All three come standard with Audi’s Quattro all-wheel-drive system. Performance fans can opt for an S5, which is available in all three body styles and features a 349-hp, turbo 3.0-liter V-6 engine, eight-speed automatic transmission, firmer suspension and upgraded brakes. If that’s not enough, the high-performance RS 5 gets a 444-hp, twin-turbo 2.9-liter V-6 and other performance upgrades, though it’s offered only as a coupe or hatchback. The A5 family’s rivals include the Acura Integra, BMW 4 Series, Lexus IS and Mercedes-Benz C-Class.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Audi A5?\n\nChanges to the 2023 Audi A5 and S5 are limited to minor feature and option package updates. The Black Optics appearance package now includes black exhaust tips and a black rear spoiler, and adaptive cruise control is now grouped into the available Convenience Package. The mid-range Premium Plus trim gets a Bang & Olufsen stereo, and the RS 5’s new Competition Package includes a performance-tuned suspension, stickier performance tires, and an RS sport exhaust system.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Audi A5 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nAll-wheel drive\nTri-zone climate control\nLED headlights with high-beam assist\nLeather seats\nHeated front seats\n10.1-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nPower-operated trunk lid\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure warning\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nAudi Virtual Cockpit with 12.3-inch instrument panel screen\nVentilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nAdaptive cruise control\n360-degree camera system\nHead-up display\nBang & Olufsen premium stereo\nRear cross-traffic alert\nBlind spot warning\nShould I Buy the 2023 Audi A5?\n\nThe Audi A5 offers sleek styling in the coupe, open-air thrills in the convertible, and a roomier backseat and spacious trunk in the four-door Sportback. The S5 and RS 5 offer higher levels of performance and, not surprisingly, significantly steeper price tags. Engine refinement is excellent, and cabin quality helps the A5 stand out among some very worthy competitors. Keep in mind the rear seats in the coupe and convertible are snug for taller adults, and luggage space is especially dear in the droptop A5. Audi would also be smart to include more standard safety features, like blind spot warning and rear cross-traffic alert. These days, such features are often standard on budget-minded vehicles that cost a fraction of the A5’s price.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in August 2010 about the 2010 Audi A5. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2011, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nI was impressed with the A5’s stunning looks when it debuted for 2008, but I didn’t like its 3.2-liter V-6. It lacked excitement, and even though it’s the more powerful of two available engines, the coupe felt too heavy with it inside. Fellow editor Kelsey Mays reviewed the A5 Cabriolet convertible last year and found the A5’s base 2.0-liter turbo maladjusted, which is strange because our staff universally loves that engine in the A4, as well as other Audis and VWs of various shapes and sizes.\n\nI discovered that the car is at its best in its most affordable, least powerful guise: the A5 2.0T. This one’s just right.\n\nSee all A5 trim levels and body styles compared here.\n\nPerformance\nIn the car world — especially the sports car world — the thinking is that the more powerful the engine, the better the driving experience. Audi’s 2.0-liter turbo four-cylinder is one exception, especially compared with the other engine offered in the A5: the 3.2-liter six-cylinder. (If you want brute force and enthusiast thrills, check out our review of the Audi S5 here.)\n\nThe 2.0-liter revs happily and gets you up to speed lickety-split. It might not have the low-end power of the 3.2, but neither does it have any of the accelerator lag exhibited by the A5 3.2 I drove. My test car had the standard six-speed manual, which is a joy to drive. The clutch is light and the shifter pops into each gate with precise, light throws.\n\nThis is the manual transmission you want if you do a lot of commuting — and as the master of the 60-minute commute in the Cars.com offices, I am best qualified to offer this assessment.\n\nSteering is in the traditional Audi vein: power-assisted to an extreme at low speeds, with a more precise feel at higher speeds. What this does is rid you of the heavy lifting you need to do to navigate a BMW 3 Series up a parking structure.\n\nThe ride was also fairly comfortable in daily driving. The structure feels rigid, but you don’t feel major road imperfections, like bridge joints, as severely as you do in the BMW competition. The Infiniti G37 also has a nice balance of ride comfort and performance, with a nicer exhaust and more grunt under the hood.\n\nLooks\nWhat neither the BMW 3 coupe nor the G37 coupe has, though, is the A5’s looks. The car is stunning, and after more than a year on the market, it still received praise from my neighbors and family members. \n\nI don’t think I need to elaborate on this section; just take a look at the pretty pictures.\n\nInterior\nAudi’s interior looks neat, orderly and simple. Could it be a little bit more luxurious for its as-tested $40,000 price tag? Perhaps, especially around the doors, but overall I was focused on the stylish gauges, the sophisticated entertainment and navigation system, and the road, as a driver should be.\n\nThose features also make up for the two small rear seats, which are nearly impossible to use.\n\nOne drawback, though, is getting in and out. The A5 is a step better than the Chevy Corvette in terms of having to fold your body to get in and out of it, but that’s not much of a compliment. More extreme sports cars are easier to jump into than the A5, which might make this otherwise mainstream vehicle attractive to fewer buyers. My wife especially can’t stand this attribute — she still remembers/loathes the Corvette Z06 and BMW 6 Series — even when she’s not wearing high heels or a dress.\n\nCargo\nThe trunk has a nice, rectangular shape that makes the 12.0 cubic feet of cargo space in there extremely usable, as there aren’t any odd cutouts or wasted space. The rear seats might be useless for passengers, but at least they fold down to expand the cargo area. \n\nSafety\nThe A5 comes with standard front airbags, seat-mounted side airbags for the driver and passenger, and side curtain airbags for both rows. The A5 has not been crash-tested by either the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.\n\nAudi A5 in the Market\nIt’s pretty easy to pen this section, because the A5 has already proved itself in the market as a strong seller. The 2.0T is the least expensive version, starting at $36,000 with the manual transmission. Our test car had navigation and an optional Prestige Package, which ratcheted the price up above $43,000. That’s a lot of money for a four-cylinder engine, even if it is a really good one.\n\nBut at least you don’t need to go any higher than that; the styling and combination of everyday driving comfort and just-enough thrills make a convincing argument not to upgrade to a 3.2.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "I was impressed with the Audi A5’s stunning looks when it debuted for 2008, but I didn’t like its 3.2-liter V-6. It lacked excitement, and even though it’s the more powerful of two available engines, the coupe felt too heavy with it inside. Fellow editor Kelsey Mays reviewed the A5 with the soft-top Cabriolet convertible option last year and found the A5’s base 2.0-liter turbo maladjusted, which is strange because our staff universally loves that engine in the A4, as well as other Audis and VWs of various shapes and sizes.\n\nI discovered that the car is at its best in its most affordable, least powerful guise: the quattro A5 2.0T. This one’s just right.\n\nSee all Audi A5 trim levels and body styles compared here.\n\nPerformance\nIn the car world — especially the sports car world — the thinking is that the more powerful the engine, the better the driving experience. Audi’s 2.0-liter turbo four-cylinder is one exception, especially compared with the other engine offered in the A5: the 3.2-liter six-cylinder. (If you want brute force and enthusiast thrills, check out our review of the Audi S-line with the S5 here.)\n\nThe turbocharged 2.0-liter revs happily and gets you up to speed lickety-split. It might not have the low-end pounds-feet of torque or power of the 3.2, but neither does it have any of the accelerator lag exhibited by the A5 3.2 I drove. My test car had the standard six-speed manual, which is a joy to drive. The clutch is light and the shifter pops into each gate with precise, light throws. The Audi A5 comes in two main trims: the 2.0T Premium, and the 3.2 Premium Plus. All come standard with Audi’s quattro all-wheel-drive (AWD). The exception is the Cabriolet (convertible), where front-wheel-drive is standard, but quattro all-wheel-drive (AWD) is an available option.\n\nThis is the manual transmission you want if you do a lot of commuting — and as the master of the 60-minute commute in the Cars.com offices, I am best qualified to offer this assessment.\n\nSteering is in the traditional Audi vein: power-assisted to an extreme at low speeds, with a more precise feel at higher speeds. What this does is rid you of the heavy lifting you need to do to navigate a BMW 3 Series up a parking structure.\n\nThe ride was also fairly comfortable in daily driving. The Audi A5 structure feels rigid, but you don’t feel major road imperfections, like bridge joints, as severely as you do in the BMW competition. The Infiniti G37 also has a nice balance of ride comfort and performance, with a nicer exhaust and more grunt under the hood.\n\nLooks\nWhat neither the BMW 3 coupe nor the G37 coupe has, though, is the A5’s looks. That, and standard quattro all-whell-drive. The car is stunning, even as a cabriolet (convertible), and after more than a year on the market, it still received praise from my neighbors and family members. \n\nI don’t think I need to elaborate on this section; just take a look at the pretty pictures.\n\nInterior\nAudi’s interior looks neat, orderly and simple. Could it be a little bit more luxurious for its as-tested $40,000 price tag? Perhaps, especially around the doors, but overall I was focused on the stylish gauges, the sophisticated entertainment and navigation system, and the road, as a driver should be.\n\nThose features also make up for the two small rear leather-wrapped seats, which are nearly impossible to use.\n\nOne drawback, though, is getting in and out. The A5 coupe is a step better than the Chevy Corvette in terms of having to fold your body to get in and out of those leather seats, but that’s not much of a compliment. More extreme sports cars are easier to jump into than the A5, which might make this otherwise mainstream vehicle attractive to fewer buyers. My wife especially can’t stand this attribute — she still remembers/loathes the Corvette Z06 and BMW 6 Series — even when she’s not wearing high heels or a dress.\n\nCargo\nThe trunk has a nice, rectangular shape that makes the 12.0 cubic feet of cargo space in there extremely usable, as there aren’t any odd cutouts or wasted space. The rear seats might be useless for passengers, but at least they fold down to expand the cargo area. \n\nSafety\nThe Audi A5 comes with standard front airbags, seat-mounted side airbags for the driver and passenger, and side curtain airbags for both rows. The A5 has not been crash-tested by either the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.\n\nAudi A5 in the Market\nIt’s pretty easy to pen this section, because the A5 has already proved itself in the body-type market as a strong seller. The 2.0T is the least expensive version, starting at $36,000 with the manual transmission. Our test car had navigation and an optional Prestige Package, which ratcheted the price up above $43,000. That’s a lot of money for a coupe with a turbocharged four-cylinder engine, even if it is a really good one with standard quattro AWD.\n\nBut at least you don’t need to go any higher than that; the body styling, attractive alloy wheels, and combination of everyday driving comfort and just-enough thrills make a convincing argument not to upgrade to a direct-injected 3.2.\n\n \n\nSend David an email",
