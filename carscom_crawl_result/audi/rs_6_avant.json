      "expert_review": "Oh my God, that’s gorgeous.\n\nIsn’t it? That’s the absolutely stunning 2021 Audi RS 6 Avant, with “Avant” being Audi-speak for station wagon. Yes, that’s right, a wagon. Unlike some stupid, pumped-up hot-rod crossover, this thing is a proper performance car that happens to have a useful hatch and cargo space. In fact, it’s available only as a wagon — there is no sedan RS 6 available anywhere in the world.\n\nRelated:  2021 Audi RS 6 Avant Price and Specs: Go-Fast Grocery Getter Goes for $110K\n\nThe RS 6 Avant features a low seating position and low center of gravity, so it’s actually amazingly good to drive compared to “performance” crossovers. Are you going to be able to see over the tops of the cars surrounding you? No. But let’s be honest, since everyone now drives freakin’ crossover-style SUVs, nobody can “see over” anything anymore. You may as well get something that still has the useful room of a crossover but drives a thousand times better. That’s always been the ultimate case for station wagons — unfortunately, you’re now too late because for 2022, the RS 6 Avant is one of just four pure station wagons (that aren’t pretending to be off-road crossovers) left on sale in the U.S.; the others being the Volvo V60 Recharge plug-in hybrid and Porsche’s Panamera and Taycan Sport Turismo. That makes the RS 6 Avant seen here something of a rare unicorn, doesn’t it?\n\nDoes it drive as good as it looks?\n\nBetter. What started out as an already nice Audi A6 with a wagon back was heavily breathed upon by the performance folks at Audi, and the result is an absolute fighter jet of a family car — I guess that makes this thing more pegasus than unicorn. The most obvious change are the flared fenders that needed to be widened to fit the massive 22-inch five-spoke wheels and summer tires. They’re integrated into the wider bodywork and make the already long, low profile of the RS 6 Avant even more intimidating to behold. Combine it with a more aggressive front end, a wheel design that looks like it could slice fingers off if washed the wrong way and Sebring Black crystal paint, and this RS 6 looks like it could scare off gangs of ruffians in dark alleys. If you told your kids this was the latest Batmobile, I bet they’d believe you.\n\nIt’s all powered by a twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 engine making a whopping 591 horsepower and 590 pounds-feet of torque. All that power is routed through an eight-speed Tiptronic automatic transmission to all four wheels via permanent Quattro all-wheel drive, employing a sport differential for better power and torque management. It results in an Audi-measured 3.5-second 0-60-mph sprint. And while I wasn’t able to do any measured testing in my week with the RS 6 Avant on the highways and canyons of Southern California, I have little reason to doubt its numbers. The car is capable of explosive acceleration, trading its normally chill, around-town demeanor for raging beast with a quick stab of the go-pedal. Punch the little exhaust-note button on the console and you get to enjoy the V-8 at even louder volumes, sending auditory warnings reverberating off the canyon walls or highway underpasses. In an age where a number of the newest performance cars are electric and sound like hair dryers or dishwashers — all sweeping electronic whooshes and dinging chimes — the throaty mechanical snarl of Audi’s V-8 is a nostalgic joy.\n\nSounds like this thing’s made for canyon carving!\n\nYou’d think it would be, but actually it’s not that great in tight twisties. After taking the RS 6 Avant through the canyons above Los Angeles and over the highways north of town, it became clear to me that the beast is really meant to be more of a long-distance Autobahn-burner than a weekend canyon racer. While it’s brutally fast and very responsive, the steering isn’t terribly communicative; it’s actually rather numb. Yes, it’s agile, especially with its adjustable suspension and rear-wheel steering, and you can certainly hustle it along the back roads and mountain ridgelines, but it’s not as enjoyable as something smaller and less insulated would be.\n\nThe ride quality is a beautifully balanced compromise between flat and level body control when cornering and a smoothly compliant ride over all manner of pavement. It’s also quiet inside, even with the adjustable exhaust set to full-tilt, making it almost too quiet versus its projected image. It’s like Audi created a blisteringly quick vehicle capable of supercar behavior but doesn’t want it to disturb your motoring Zen too much while you’re using it, so it never gets too crazy on you.\n\nSo it tilts more luxury than flat-out performance, gotcha. It certainly looks nice inside.\n\nThe interior is fantastic. My test car was done up in Cognac Brown leather with Granite Gray stitching, providing a stunning contrast with the somber metallic exterior. Audi has crafted outstanding interiors for years, and despite the increasing creep toward touch-sensitive panels for everyday controls (which the RS 6 Avant has as well), it still feels expensive inside. Audi’s combination of touchscreens and haptic feedback have turned its flat-panel controls into a better-than-average system of its type, but we still vastly prefer well-done mechanical buttons to what we have here, which sometimes requires two or three touches to make sure you activated or deactivated whatever it is you were trying for. The second-generation Virtual Cockpit 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster remains a highlight, despite similar displays now becoming commonplace among vehicles that cost even half as much as this one.\n\nAside from the increasing push toward touch-sensitive controls, the interior of the RS 6 Avant is as useful and comfortable as any crossover-style SUV, despite headroom and seating position being a bit lower. The heavily bolstered sport seats are aggressive but still quite comfortable and adequately adjustable to create the perfect driving position. The backseat has decent room for two passengers, with no complaints about legroom or headroom. And the convenient cargo area is what it is — the straight, flat roofline of the RS 6 Avant wagon allows for plenty of space, especially when the rear seatbacks are folded flat. Not that an RS 6 Avant is ever likely to see duty hauling bags of mulch from the local Home Depot, but it can if need be.\n\nNot a mulch-hauler? Despite being a station wagon? Why not?\n\nWhile the Audi RS 6 Avant stickers at $117,370 including destination, you’ll likely never find one for anywhere near that price. At the time of this writing, prices on Cars.com ranged from $125,000 to $175,000, which is actually a considerable improvement from the nearly $250,000 the model was commanding when it first appeared in showrooms. At that price, you’re probably not muddying one up in the back but rather keeping it as pristine as possible (with the hopeful exception of getting the wheels coated in the traditional German brake-pad grime from aggressive use). Unlike some super expensive cars that make you wonder why they cost so much, however, the RS 6 Avant will not leave you scratching your head. It does some things only supercars can do; it looks like Bruce Wayne’s dirty-fantasy incarnate; it makes great sounds and brings big smiles; and it has a rarity to it thanks to limited production numbers. So skip taking that commuter flight between cities, and drive this instead. It’ll be far more entertaining.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nResearch the 2021 Audi RS 6 Avant\nFind a 2021 Audi RS 6 Avant Near You\n2021 Audi RS Q8: 3 Ways It’s Worthy of the Badge\n2021 Audi RS 7 Price and Specs: My Baby Is Back\n2021 Audi SQ5 Review: Not as Racy as It Looks, and That’s OK\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2022 Audi A6?\n\nThe five-seat Audi A6 is a mid-size luxury sedan that bridges the gap between the smaller A4 and full-size A8. Engines range from mild to wild, with the S6’s 444-horsepower, turbocharged 2.9-liter V-6 falling into the latter category. Even crazier is the turbo V-8 offered in the RS 6 Avant, a tire-melting wagon with 591 hp. Both of these engines pair with an eight-speed automatic transmission.\n\nBase sedans are powered by a 261-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that works with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic. A 335-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 is also available, and this engine also powers the Allroad wagon. All-wheel drive is standard. Competitors include the BMW 5 Series, Genesis G80 and Mercedes-Benz E-Class.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2022 Audi A6?\n\nNew standard features include a 10.1-inch navigation screen, rear-seat side-impact airbags and Audi’s virtual cockpit digital gauge display.\n\nWhat Features in the 2022 Audi A6 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nQuattro all-wheel drive\nPower moonroof\nLeather seating\nHeated front seats\nTri-zone automatic climate control\nAndroid Auto and wireless Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure warning\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nPower trunk lid\nVentilated front seats\nAdaptive cruise control\nBang & Olufsen premium stereo\nHead-up display\nHeated steering wheel\n360-degree camera system\nBlind spot warning\nSport suspension with lowered ride height\nShould I Buy the 2022 Audi A6?\n\nAudi has a great reputation for crafting elegant cabins, and that holds true in the A6. A few too many touch-sensitive controls get in the way, however, and the sedan’s trunk is on the small side. For added cargo room, the A6 Allroad wagon is worth a look.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Bigger turbos mean more power for 2024, with Audi’s fast RS wagon now making 621 horsepower and 627 pounds-feet of torque. In concert with the car’s full suite of performance goodies and smoldering good looks, it makes for one hell of a do-anything daily driver.\n\nVersus the competition: Come 2025, it’s going to feel like we Yanks are in an alternate timeline, with access to the Audi RS 6 Avant, BMW M5 Touring and potentially a next-gen Mercedes-AMG E63 wagon. We’ll have to drive the other wagons to see how the Audi stacks up, but it’s likely just as capable as its German rivals.\n\nMaybe it’s just the mortality spiral I’m locked in at the moment, but change is scary these days: As a millennial, I’m watching my generation gradually lose our grip on the reins of culture as we begin our slow slip into irrelevancy. But even scarier than that is how much the automotive industry has changed since I entered this game a decade ago: The inexorable influx of downsizing, hybridization and, uh, crossoverification has made technically advanced cars like the 2024 Audi RS 6 Avant feel rather old school.\n\nRelated: Max Power: 2025 Audi RS Q8 Performance Packs Brand’s Most Powerful Gas Engine Ever\n\n2024 Audi RS 6 Avant Performance | Cars.com photo by Brandon Lim\nModern Performance? It’s Complicated \n\nIt’s a weird take, for sure. There’s nothing actually outdated about the RS 6’s tech, which includes triple interior displays backed by Audi’s excellent MMI infotainment architecture, nor is there anything overtly out of spec with its styling, performance or feature set. On the contrary, the RS 6 Avant is (predictably) one of the sweeter sleds I’ve had the privilege of driving in quite a while.\n\nPerhaps I’m not suffering from fear of change so much as simply being in the throes of a hybrid hangover. To be clear, I’m not against hybridization (or electrification, for that matter), but it does seem like we’re losing simplicity — or maybe just the illusion of simplicity — in its undertow.\n\nTake the Mercedes-AMG C63: The last generation (2015-23) was an incredibly complex vehicle, packing a nine-stage traction control function, adaptive chassis, customizable control dial with a mini display screen on the steering wheel, and all of the other bangs, bobs and whistles you’d expect of a high-dollar, high-performance sedan. Yet even draped in all this digi-jewelry, Mercedes’ 503-horsepower, twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8 and rear-wheel-drive configuration met expectations for both the era and the breed, with neat tech like “hot-vee” turbocharging and a “multiclutch” nine-speed transmission. Then consider the 2024 Mercedes-AMG C63 S E Performance, where a hybridized 2.0-liter four-cylinder takes over for the V-8, with a rear-mounted electric motor boosting output to a stunning 671 hp and 752 pounds-feet of torque. The car is now all-wheel drive and incorporates an electric turbocharger, plug-in hybrid capability and a dizzying array of configurable digital driver-assist systems.\n\n2024 Audi RS 6 Avant Performance | Cars.com photo by Brandon Lim\n\nIt’s all so … labyrinthian. So too is the forthcoming E63, which purportedly ditches the V-8 for an inline-six of similar hybridization persuasion. The new 2025 Porsche 911 GTS is hybridized for the first time in history, now heavier and more complex with a motor-driven turbocharger and an additional electric motor juicing the rear wheels. Power is up, but the manual is out; Porsche says the complex new drivetrain doesn’t play nice with three pedals.\n\nAudi’s Antidote (for Now)\n\nBringing it back to Audi, we recently learned that the gas-powered A6 is going away, supplanted by a new A6 Sportback e-Tron. If you want a mid-size gas-powered three-boxer from Audi, your only remaining option is the forthcoming next-gen A7. All the even-numbered models are shifting to battery-fed power, while the “odds,” like the A5 and A7, still drink the oil industry’s finest.\n\nThis sweeping transition seems (“seems” being the key word here) accelerated and sudden despite having come over nearly a decade of gradual electrification. Which leads me back to the wonderful, wild and weirdly analog 2024 Audi RS 6 Avant. \n\nAll right, it’s hardly analog, but the RS 6’s powertrain is about as far as you can get from an e-Tron in 2024. As it has been since its stateside debut for 2021, a twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8 is this car’s roaring heart, mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission and hooked up to the marque’s signature Quattro AWD system.\n\n2024 Audi RS 6 Avant | Cars.com photo by Brandon Lim\n\nOutside of Audi’s near-ubiquitous 48-volt mild-hybrid system, there are no electric motors, batteries, plugs or sockets in sight. Is that a good thing? Depends on both your point of view and your priorities, but for now, I tend to like my cars sans electricity. I’m sure I’ll own an EV someday — by force — and be happy as a clam, but I fear our charging infrastructure just isn’t ready yet.\n\n(More) Advanced Avant\n\nThat’s for later. What’s now is the delicious 2024 RS 6 Avant, fresh from a mild update that has miraculously added more power and torque. Bigger turbos and tweaked engine management translate to 621 hp and 627 pounds-feet of torque, along with a new Performance trim designation. (No vanilla RS 6 Avant is offered in the U.S. for 2024.) That engine is up 30 hp and 37 pounds-feet over the prior car, cutting 0.2 second off Audi’s reported 0-60 mph scuttle, which now takes a zesty 3.3 seconds. If you live near the autobahn, an abandoned airfield or are just feeling a little dangerous, the RS 6 Avant’s top speed is limited to 155 mph, or 174 mph if you cop the new Bronze edition. \n\nBut wait: There’s less! A new wheelset, reduced sound insulation and a lighter center differential combine to snip around 60 pounds from the car’s total mass, bringing its curb weight down to … 4,982 pounds. Oh dear. That’s hardly svelte, but then, this is hardly a svelte car, dimensionally or philosophically. What, you expected your swollen, long-roofed, leather-lined, twin-turbo V-8, AWD superwagon to weigh in like a Miata? This is an indulgent car! This is you, eating your vehicular cake.\n\n2024 Audi RS 6 Avant | Cars.com photo by Brandon Lim\nOverwhelming Performance\n\nIt feels heavy, but maybe not more-than-two-Miatas heavy. Power and acceleration are nonsensical, with full-throttle blasts bringing you from the stoplight to “Haha, oh dear” speeds in alarmingly short order. Even in this age of electric-vehicle insta-torque, the accelerative pressure in this Audi will jelly your eyes and launch your phones, keys and ChapStick into the backseat, where your kids or friends will be screaming with either joy or terror. Perhaps both.\n\nIt sounds darn good, too. Audi’s long-lived 4.0-liter shouts with equal parts clean, metallic rumble and guttural roar, leaving onlookers either cheering or running for cover against the mechanical gnash. For the record, a hard pull through downtown L.A.’s famed 2nd Street tunnel in an RS 6 will echo between the buildings on either side (or so I’ve been told).\n\nBut the RS 6 Avant ain’t just for hauling ass; it hauls friends, too. So, in comes my buddy Rich for a morning charge up Angeles Crest Highway. We’ve got a Cars and Coffee to catch, and it’s 30 tortured, twisting canyon miles to the spot — easy work in this Audi. Its new wheels are shod in equally new P285/30R22 Continental SportContact 7 summer tires that balance daily comfort with flypaper stickiness, which was evident from our wicked pace up the mountain. It feels substantial in a reassuring way, with oodles of mechanical grip and clever power transfer that allows you to recklessly power through corners with ear-popping pace.\n\nMore From Cars.com: \n\n2025 Audi A4, A5 Sportback Gain New Packages; Latter Slims Lineup\n2025 Audi Q8 Family Priced From $75,695, New Packages for SQ8\n2025 Audi E-Tron GT: Lots of More, Lots of Faster\nAerodynamic 2025 Audi A6, S6 e-Trons Are Here to Slip Into Your Garage\nShop for a 2024 Audi RS 6 Avant\n2024 Audi RS 6 Avant | Cars.com photo by Brandon Lim\nLess Show, More Go\n\nHalfway up, we were slowed by a strangely specific caravan composed solely of E90-generation BMW M3s and a cluster of Lamborghini Murcielagos. We might have lost our momentum, but we sat smugly, knowing we had the best combination of performance and creature comforts. A V-12 with a gated manual? Sorry, can’t hear you over the hum of our ventilated seats.\n\nWe arrived to a small fleet of Skittles-colored super-coupes mobbed by camera-wielding spotters. Phones and cameras raised for the Lambos, then mostly dropped as we brought up the rear. It’s funny: While the RS 6 Avant’s puffy wheel arches and long roof lend a distinctly brawny presence in regular traffic, it turns downright pedestrian when parked next to nuclear-green Porsches and bright-blue Bimmers. Soon, however, some looky-loos took notice and filtered over to ask questions and take photos.\n\nCars observed and coffee had, we traded alpine air for our home turf’s beach sun — but not before a sandwich stop downtown. At that point, we wanted the V-8 to shut up and the adaptive air suspension to just loosen up, man, as we threaded highway traffic and avoided Frogtown potholes. The RS 6 manages to be pretty comfy in its most soporific setting, let down only by the huge wheels and low-profile tires, which impart road noise and a skosh more harshness than I’d like on my daily commute.\n\n2024 Audi RS 6 Avant | Cars.com photo by Brandon Lim\nCreature Comforts\n\nOther inputs are less aggressive. Even off the mountainside, the RS 6 Avant’s electrically assisted steering is numb and quite digital, but active rear-wheel steering effectively shrink-wraps the car’s bulk in small parking lots and drastically improves turn-in when wheeling through tight, technical roads. The Avant’s massive brakes are almost as impressive as the twin-turbo monster up front, seemingly folding the pavement with their decelerative force. The brake pedal is easy to modulate in any environment, too, with none of the frustrating, head-banging motions for passengers that an overly sensitive performance-car brake pedal can induce.\n\nRegarding interior accoutrement, the RS 6 features the same level of trim and tinsel you’d get on a line-topping Audi from any model family save the A8 and Q8. Truly bougie buyers can spring for the Executive Package, which adds soft-close doors, extended leather and heated rear seats. They can also add an optional Bang & Olufsen sound system and oh-so-necessary night-vision assist tech.\n\nIt’s a lot of car but not a lot of time, I’m afraid. Audi hasn’t said a word about the future of its fastest gas-powered sedans — including the mechanically identical RS 7 — but looking at wider trends, the next RS 6 Avant might have either a whole lot more or a whole lot less under its hood. However long we have with this car, I’m just glad it’s here alongside the forthcoming BMW M5 Touring and a potential next-gen Mercedes-AMG E63 wagon. Rage, rage against the dying of the wagon? Rejoice, for we (might) have three.\n\n2024 Audi RS 6 Avant Performance | Cars.com photo by Brandon Lim\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Audi A6?\n\nThe five-seat Audi A6 is a mid-size luxury sedan that comes standard with a 261-horsepower, mild-hybrid turbo four-cylinder that’s paired with a seven-speed automatic transmission and standard all-wheel drive. A 335-hp, mild-hybrid 3.0-liter V-6 is optional. If you’re a car shopper with a need for speed, the S6 is fitted with a 444-hp, turbocharged 2.9-liter V-6, while the super-performance RS 6 Avant wagon employs a twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8 that delivers a whopping 621 hp. Its acceleration matches just about any sports car. If cargo room and enhanced rough-terrain capability are more important to you than tire-melting acceleration, the SUV-flavored A6 Allroad wagon is a compelling choice. The A6’s rivals include the BMW 5 Series, Cadillac CT5, Genesis G80 and Mercedes-Benz E-Class.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Audi A6?\n\nAfter a refresh last year, the A6 family sees little change for 2025. The A6 and S6 sedans and the Allroad wagon get additional standard equipment, along with a shuffling of trim packages. The S6 is now available with a Nardo Sport Edition trim package, and the RS 6 Avant gets a limited-production, specially trimmed GT version.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Audi A6 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nQuattro AWD\nPower moonroof\nLeather seating\n10.1-inch infotainment screen\n12.3-inch Virtual Cockpit instrument display\nHeated front seats\nTri-zone automatic climate control\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure warning\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nVentilated front seats\nPower soft-close doors\nMassaging front seats\nAdaptive cruise control\nBang & Olufsen premium stereo\nHead-up display\nHeated steering wheel\n360-degree camera system\nBlind spot warning\nSport suspension\nAll-wheel steering\nShould I Buy the 2025 Audi A6?\n\nThe Audi A6 is elegant and understated, but it’s also an all-weather luxury sedan thanks to standard AWD and a buttoned-down suspension. It’s hard not to be tempted by the power offered in the S6 and RS 6 Avant, but they cost much more than the standard A6. The Allroad wagon’s slightly raised suspension and large cargo area make it an esoteric pick in a luxury field brimming with SUVs. The A6’s dual-screen dashboard design looks fresh and modern, but its lack of physical controls can make it a distraction.",
