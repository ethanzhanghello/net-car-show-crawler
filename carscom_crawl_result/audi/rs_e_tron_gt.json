      "expert_review": "It looks like the Audi E-Tron GT is stepping out of the shadow of its Porsche Taycan sister car, as Audi’s electric sedan gets big power boosts for 2025. For 2024, the entry-level E-Tron GT made 523 horsepower, and the high-performance RS E-Tron GT trim produced 637 hp. Now, the base model has been rechristened the S E-Tron GT and puts out 670 hp, an increase of 147 hp, or 28%, over the former model. Audi says the S can accelerate from 0-60 mph in 3.3 seconds, and the much wilder RS E-Tron GT Performance in just 2.4.\n\nRelated: 2023 Audi RS E-Tron GT Quick Spin: A Grand Tourer in Most Respects\n\nThat’s right: Audi also added another word to the E-Tron’s fastest trim, taking it from RS E-Tron GT to RS E-Tron GT Performance. Output for the high-performance variant increases by 275 hp over the former top RS E-Tron GT trim to 912. The price of entry also increases commensurately, with the S model priced from $126,795 (all prices include a $1,295 destination fee) — nearly $20,000 higher. The 2025 RS E-Tron GT Performance’s base price also grows by about $20,000 over last year’s RS trim, now starting at $168,295.\n\nPowertrain and Range Improvements\n\nImprovements to the E-Tron GT’s electric motors allow new E-Trons to make more power than ever before, with Audi claiming that the new RS E-Tron GT Performance is its most powerful production vehicle released to date. Both versions of the 2025 E-Tron GT have two electric motors, one on each axle, for all-wheel drive. In addition to increased copper density that improves current conduction front and rear, the rear motor is also 22 pounds lighter than last year’s.\n\nImproved cell chemistry in the RS E-Tron GT Performance’s battery also contributes to the greatly increased power of the 2025 model, allowing the pack to flow more current. While the physical size of the battery pack is unchanged, those chemistry tweaks grew both E-Tron GTs’ battery storage capacities from last year’s 93.4 kilowatt-hours to 105. Audi has not released range figures for the RS E-Tron GT yet, but according to the brand, the S E-Tron GT hits the magic 300-mile mark on the nose — bettering the less powerful 2024 base model by a whopping 51 miles.\n\nThe battery’s increased current capacity is a two-way street, also allowing the E-Tron GT to charge faster than before. On a DC fast charger, it can now charge at up to 320 kilowatts, up from 270 kW last year. Audi says both versions of the E-Tron GT can now charge from 10% to 80% in just 18 minutes, 3.5 minutes faster than the 2024 model.\n\nImproved Moves and Looks\n\nTo keep up with the more powerful motors, Audi also updated the E-Tron GT’s standard air suspension to better control body motions. New bumpers front and rear, as well as new wheel designs, distinguish the updated model from its predecessors. The RS E-Tron GT Performance receives new optional forged carbon-fiber trim on the bumpers and mirrors as well as inside the cabin on the doorsills and dash. RS E-Tron GT Performance buyers can choose from an available carbon-fiber roof or a new electrochromic glass option that can vary its opacity at the touch of a button.\n\nAudi is commemorating the 2025 model’s updates with a 50-unit limited edition of the S trim. Painted in Arabica Gray, it features 21-inch tri-tone black, matte-gold and silver wheels and a cabin accented with Mint Gray and Mora Violet, as well as gray-tone flamed eucalyptus wood trim.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nThree New 2025 Porsche Taycan Trims Include Return of Sport Turismo Wagon\n2024 Audi E-Tron GT Sees Minor Changes, Starts at $107,995\n2023 Audi E-Tron Lineup Sees New Standard Lights, Shuffled Equipment\nAudi Q4 e-Tron Rolls Into 2024 With Few Changes, Starts at $50,995\nResearch the Audi E-Tron GT\nAvailability and Pricing\n\nThe 2025 Audi E-Tron GT is available to order now. Pricing starts at $126,795 for the S trim level and $168,295 for the RS Performance. The S trim’s output lands 20 hp shy of the 690-hp Porsche Taycan GTS, which starts at $149,895. The RS e-tron’s 912 horses put it between the 871-hp Taycan Turbo and 938-hp Turbo S, which are priced from $175,595 and $210,995, respectively.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "From looking at the Audi RS E-Tron GT’s specs alone, you might come to the conclusion that it’s a hard-edged performance variant of the base E-Tron GT (see them compared). It makes 590 horsepower — 637 hp with its boost mode activated — and Audi says it can hit 60 mph in as little as 3.1 seconds. Then there’s the fact that it’s part of Audi’s RS lineup, home of the German luxury brand’s most performance-oriented offerings.\n\nBut the RS E-Tron GT isn’t like other RS models, and that’s not just because it’s the first with an all-electric powertrain. We spent some time with a 2022 RS E-Tron GT (the car sees some minor trim and package changes for 2023 but is otherwise unchanged) to see whether it checks the boxes of a grand tourer and found that it does — save for one.\n\nRelated: 2024 Audi Q8 E-Tron: Global Reveal Predicts Big Range Boost for U.S.\n\nThe Secret Is the Suspension\n\nAudi’s RS cars aren’t known for having great ride comfort, which makes the RS E-Tron GT all the more unique. The ride is forgiving and very comfortable in the Drive Select system’s Comfort mode, and the Dynamic setting is pretty tolerable, too, though the ride is notably firmer. It’s all the more impressive when you consider that our test car was equipped with low-profile tires wrapped around 21-inch wheels, which is often a recipe for a brittle, uncomfortable ride. Overall, it’s the most relaxed RS model I’ve driven — by a long shot. It’s a testament to the tuning work that went into the car’s standard air suspension.\n\nThe supple suspension isn’t the only thing that helps the RS E-Tron GT feel like a grand tourer. The dual-motor drivetrain has plenty of reserve power at highway speeds (despite a hefty curb weight of more than 5,100 pounds); the light-effort steering is responsive and has a natural feel; and the optional carbon-ceramic braking system delivers good pedal feel. The RS E-Tron GT doesn’t offer one-pedal driving, a feature I’ve come to appreciate in electric vehicles, but the car’s steering-wheel paddles let you get a bit of regenerative braking when you lift off the accelerator pedal. Cornering stability is fine, but you feel the car’s bulk in turns.\n\nInterior Hits — And Some Misses\n\nIn typical Audi fashion — and as you’d expect of a car that starts at more than $145,000 — the RS E-Tron’s cabin is finely finished in premium materials, including an available full-leather interior. What might be more surprising, however, is that it’s more roomy than its low-slung, sleek exterior would have you believe. Headroom is good in front for taller adults (I’m about 6-foot-1) and passable in the backseat. My knees were a bit elevated when sitting in the back, however, and the sedan’s low roofline does negatively affect the driver’s over-shoulder and rear visibility. The trunk is also small, measuring just 9.2 cubic feet, according to Audi’s measurements. A front trunk adds 1.8 cubic feet of storage space, but the combined 11 cubic feet is still less than the 12-cubic-foot trunk of the brand’s A4 compact luxury sedan.\n\nThe center of the dashboard features a 10.1-inch touchscreen infotainment system, and below it are straightforward buttons for the air conditioning and other systems. While we appreciate the simple usability of traditional buttons, the center console comes across as almost too basic for a six-figure luxury car; the controls look like they could have been plucked from one of Audi’s entry-level luxury vehicles.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2023 Audi Q4 e-Tron and Q4 Sportback e-Tron Review: More Normal Than Radical\n2023 Audi RS 3 Review: Just the Right Amount of Raucousness\n2023 Audi TT Gets New Wheels, TTS Unchanged for Swan Song\nResearch Audi Models\nShop for a 2023 Audi RS E-Tron GT\nCan an EV Be a Grand Tourer?\n\nTraditionally, grand touring cars needed to be able to travel long distances. That’s something that EVs, with their mostly shorter driving ranges than gas-powered vehicles and longer refueling times (even at public DC fast chargers), aren’t great at in general.\n\nThe RS E-Tron GT has some things working for and against it where long-range travel is concerned. Its 270-kilowatt maximum DC fast-charging rate means it can replenish its 93-kilowatt-hour battery more quickly when charging at a station that can support that level of power, like a 350-kW Electrify America or EVgo charger. In our experience charging EVs, it’s unusual for them to reach and maintain their maximum charging rate, but Audi says that when the RS E-Tron GT charges at 270 kW, it can add around 180 miles of range in 22 minutes.\n\nWhile the RS E-Tron GT can charge quickly when you’re on a road trip, you may need to charge often; the sedan’s EPA-estimated range is just 232 miles. Real-world EV range can sometimes differ greatly from EPA estimates, but the RS E-Tron GT’s range estimate is still considerably less than what the Tesla Model S (405 miles of estimated range) and Lucid Air (384 to 516 miles) offer.\n\nWhile the RS E-Tron GT’s lower driving range compromises its grand tourer cred, it has other qualities of a GT — power, comfort, luxury and style — in abundance. As more 350-kW DC fast chargers come online, perhaps that long-distance part of the grand tourer equation will better apply to the RS E-Tron GT.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Audi E-Tron GT?\n\nThe Audi E-Tron GT is a five-seat electric luxury sedan that squares off against posh electric-vehicle rivals such as the Tesla Model S, Lucid Air and Porsche Taycan, with which the E-Tron GT shares a basic platform. There’s no doubt the E-Tron GT has a head-turning shape; it looks like a concept car that rolled off an auto show floor directly onto public roadways. Performance from the standard 469-horsepower dual-motor powertrain is outstanding: Output temporarily rises to 522 hp with a Boost mode engaged, and the car’s standard all-wheel drive ensures you can make the most of this performance. The RS E-Tron GT is even wilder thanks to its 637-hp powertrain. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Audi E-Tron GT?\n\nChanges to the E-Tron GT and RS E-Tron GT for 2024 are limited to additional standard equipment, including Power Steering Plus that varies boost depending on speed, LED interior lighting and illuminated doorsill inlays, and a free six-month trial subscription to Audi Connect Plus with the Audi app store, enabling remote start and providing access to a variety of apps for music, video, navigation, news and more through the center screen. The RS E-Tron GT and the E-Tron GT’s Prestige trim get standard HD Matrix-design LED headlights with Audi’s laser high beams, along with a Dinamica headliner.  \n\nHow Much Range Does the 2024 Audi E-Tron GT Have?\n\nThe EPA-estimated driving range for both the E-Tron GT and RS E-Tron GT is 249 miles.\n\nHow Long Does It Take To Charge the 2024 Audi E-Tron GT?\n\nThe E-Tron GT’s charging times range from an estimated 10 hours and 30 minutes on a standard 220-volt Level 2 charger to an estimated 22 minutes on a 350-kilowatt DC fast charger (to go from a 5% charge to 80%).\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Audi E-Tron GT Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nAWD\n10.1-inch touchscreen\n12.3-inch Virtual Cockpit digital instrument display\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nTri-zone climate control\nLeather upholstery\nHeated front seats\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nFront and rear parking sensors\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nAdaptive cruise control\nRear-wheel steering\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nMassage function for front seats\nSurround-view parking camera system\nPerpendicular- and parallel-parking assist\nCeramic brakes\nNappa leather \nShould I Buy the 2024 Audi E-Tron GT?\n\nThe Audi E-Tron GT and RS E-Tron GT aren’t what you’d call shrinking violets of the EV world. In terms of style and performance, it’s hard to find fault with either. Cabin trim is also excellent thanks to the quality of the materials used and the high-tech look and feel of the dashboard. Getting three people in the backseat, however, will take dexterity, and the trunk is teeny-tiny for a luxury sedan. Compared with similarly expensive rivals, the E-Tron GT’s driving range falls well short of best-in-class.",

      "expert_review": "Competes with: Porsche Taycan, Tesla Model S\n\nLooks like: An A7 from the future\n\nPowertrain: Two electric motors and a 93.4-kilowatt-hour battery pack paired with a two-speed transmission; combined output is 469 horsepower or 590 hp in uplevel RS versions \n\nHits dealerships: Summer 2021\n\nAudi revealed an all-new electric sedan that it said will “shape the future of premium mobility.” The 2022 E-Tron GT resembles the concept revealed at the 2018 Los Angeles Auto Show, retaining its forebear’s sleek silhouette, huge wheels, dynamic face and muscular proportions. \n\nRelated: Electric Cars With the Longest Range\n\nThe production version joins the E-Tron SUV and E-Tron Sportback in Audi’s E-Tron lineup, bringing the German luxury brand closer to its goal to achieve a 30% electrified lineup by 2025. \n\nThe E-Tron GT will be available in regular and amped-up RS versions when it goes on sale this summer. \n\nExterior\n\nOutside, the E-Tron GT is long and lean with a low-slung roof and aerodynamic profile augmented by a chiseled body, muscular rear haunches and an aggressive face. Design highlights include an inverted version of Audi’s single-frame grille with a honeycomb design along with available HD Matrix-design headlights with Audi’s laser technology. The E-Tron GT rides on standard 20-inch alloy wheels with gray accents and five double spokes apiece.   \n\nRS models wear a lightweight, high-strength roof made from five layers of carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic; Audi says it’s a first for the automaker as well as a class-exclusive feature. The RS model comes with standard 20-inch five-spoke Aero wheels or available 21-inch wheels. \n\nInterior\n\nThe sedan seats four occupants, and the focus inside is on sustainability. The standard leather-free interior uses recycled materials for the seats and surfaces; Nappa leather is available. \n\nOther cabin features include Audi’s 12.3-inch Virtual Cockpit and a version of the automaker’s 10.1-inch MMI touchscreen multimedia system; it’s angled toward the driver for more of a cockpit-like feel. \n\nEngine and Transmission\n\nAll-wheel drive is standard, and power comes from two electric motors paired with a two-speed transmission; the motors draw power off a 93.4-kilowatt-hour battery pack. Combined output is 469 horsepower or, with a launch-control overboost feature, 522 hp for 2.5 seconds. Audi says the E-Tron GT sprints from 0-60 mph in 3.9 seconds and has a top speed of 152 mph. \n\nRS models have a stronger rear motor and a combined 590 hp rating, or 637 hp with the temporary boost. The E-Tron RS scoots from 0-60 mph in 3.1 seconds and has a top speed of 155 mph.\n\nThe E-Tron GT can charge at up to 270 kilowatts using a DC fast charger, which can charge the battery pack to 80% from 5% in about 22 minutes. Audi estimates regular models are good for 238 miles of range and RS versions can get 232 miles, but EPA estimates have not been published as of this writing. That’s higher than competitor Porsche Taycan 4’s 199-mile range but short of Tesla’s forthcoming Model S refresh, which can go as high as a Tesla-claimed 520 miles (current versions are EPA-rated between 334 and 387 miles). \n\nPricing\n\nThe E-Tron GT in base Premium Plus trim will start at $99,900 and Prestige models start at $107,100. The E-Tron RS starts at $139,900. That’s in line with the Taycan’s $103,000 starting price and in line with the Model S (about $80,000 to $140,000 as of Jan. 28 — though, like all things Tesla, that’s subject to change). All E-Tron prices exclude destination as well as the available $7,500 electric vehicle federal tax incentive. \n\nUp next is the Audi Q4 E-Tron; Audi says it will join the lineup this year.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
