      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Audi E-Tron?\n\nThe Audi E-Tron and E-Tron Sportback are five-seat electric SUVs that put an emphasis on driving comfort and superb cabin quality. Each comes standard with all-wheel drive and a dual-motor electric powertrain that produces 355 horsepower and 414 pounds-feet of torque. The Sportback looks, well, sportier thanks to its tapered roofline, but the E-Tron and Sportback are identical in how they drive. The more powerful S versions nudge output to an impressive 496 hp and 718 pounds-feet of torque; however, EPA-estimated range for the S drops to a maximum of 212 miles in the S and 208 miles in the S Sportback. The regular E-Tron’s 226-mile range already trails rivals like the Ford Mustang Mach-E, Jaguar I-Pace, and Tesla’s Model X and Model Y.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Audi E-Tron?\n\nOrange brake calipers, 22-inch alloy wheels, LED matrix headlights and rear side airbags are now standard on the E-Tron Sportback in its range-topping Prestige trim. Those LED lights, along with carbon-fiber cabin trim, are newly standard on the E-Tron S and E-Tron Sportback S.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Audi E-Tron Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nAll-wheel drive\n10.1-inch infotainment screen\n8.6-inch screen for climate controls\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nAmazon Alexa\nLeather seating\nHeated front seats\nNavigation\nSatellite radio\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nAdaptive cruise control\n22-inch alloy wheels\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nBang & Olufsen audio system\nSurround-view parking camera\nHead-up instrument display\nPower soft-close doors\nShould I Buy the 2023 Audi E-Tron?\n\nThe 2023 Audi E-Tron and E-Tron Sportback are electric SUVs for car shoppers concerned with shouting to the world that they’re driving an EV. With a conservative exterior design, the E-Tron is a comfortable, smooth-running electric SUV that delivers a strong roster of standard tech and convenience features. It’s a shame the E-Tron’s driving range falls short of most direct rivals’ — and while we’re being picky, the front trunk is also tiny. Still, if you don’t mind its range limitations, the E-Tron is worth a test drive.",

      "expert_review": "Audi’s newest additions to its electric vehicle lineup, the 2022 E-Tron S and E-Tron S Sportback SUVs, put a premium on power. With three motors powering each of the all-electric SUVs, the sportier S versions produce 429 horsepower and 596 pounds-feet of torque. Activate a boost mode and, for eight seconds, those figures jump to 496 hp and 718 pounds-feet. But acquiring an S version of either the E-Tron or E-Tron Sportback — the latter Audi’s designation for the SUV’s “coupe” variant that sacrifices space for styling — will cost buyers more than their less powerful counterparts.\n\nRelated: Audi Debuts Entry-Level EV, Q4 E-Tron SUV, for Less Than $45,000\n\nThe E-Tron S is priced from $85,895, while the Sportback starts at $88,495. Both are mid-level Premium Plus trims, while upgrading to the range-topping Prestige trim will add $5,000 to the price of each. Pricing isn’t available yet for the regular 2022 E-Tron and E-Tron Sportback, but the 2021 E-Tron and E-Tron Sportback Premium Plus trims start at $75,895 and $79,095, respectively. All prices include a $1,095 destination fee but not any federal or local plug-in tax credits.\n\nBesides a higher price, buyers may pay an additional cost, as well: reduced range. According to Audi, the EPA-estimated ranges for the S models are 208 miles for the E-Tron and 212 miles for the Sportback (when equipped with the standard wheel and tire package). Compare that with 222 or 218 miles, respectively, for the regular 2021 E-Tron and E-Tron Sportback. It seems unlikely that regular 2022 models will see a reduction in range, but the EPA has yet to publish numbers as of this writing.\n\nIt’s not all bad news for the S version, though. There’s the aforementioned eight-second power boost feature, which Audi says will rocket either S model from 0-60 mph in 4.3 seconds, significantly quicker than the non-S E-Trons’ 5.5-second runs. S models also come upholstered with Valcona leather, with heated front and rear seats also standard. Audi’s 12.3-inch digital instrument panel and dual-touchscreen display are also standard. The S will also look more aggressive than non-S models, too: Audi says it’s almost 2 inches wider, and the standard 20-inch or optional 21- or 22-inch wheels hide upgraded front brake calipers with massive 15.7-inch front brake discs.\n\nAudi says the 2022 E-Tron S and E-Tron S Sportback go on sale in the fall.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2022 Audi E-Tron GT: Premium Efficiency\n2021 Audi Q5 and SQ5 Sportbacks: Less Is More?\n2020 Audi E-Tron Sportback Charges to the Top in Crash Safety Ratings\n2021 Audi Q5 Doesn’t Mess Much With a Good Thing\n2020 Audi E-Tron Sportback Priced From $78,395\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
