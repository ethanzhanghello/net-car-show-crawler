      "expert_review": "Audi’s premium flagship, A8 L, gains aggressive new styling, impressive performance and a wealth of electronic features for 2004.\n\nGoing up against archrivals BMW 745, Mercedes-Benz S500 and Jaguar XJ8, the big sedan brings together the contradictory forces of luxury and sportiness into a grand-touring sedan of strength and substance.\n\nStill, A8 has given up some of its previously exclusive features to the competition. All-wheel drive can now be found on the Mercedes. And A8’s signature feature, a lightweight all-aluminum space-frame structure, has been adopted by the latest Jaguar XJ8.\n\nAnd the big Audi now has something similar to the BMW’s most controversial feature, the I-drive system that allows the driver to control myriad functions through something akin to a computer mouse. BMW insists that it’s the best way to make adjustments and receive information with the least amount of distraction to the driver. Many disagree.\n\nThe A8 system is called Audi Multi Media Interface, also designed to give the driver one-handed control of the audio system, communications, GPS navigation and suspension dynamics. Although it’s less complex and more intuitive than the BMW’s, MMI still seems like much ado for such simple tasks as changing the radio station.\n\nThe more things change, the more I wish they’d stay the same.\n\nWhat it is\n\nA high-end, high-priced luxury machine that packs many modern performance features along with traditional luxury appointments. The back seat is huge, the L (as in long) version of A8 being the only model coming to the United States: Europeans can choose a 5-inch shorter version.\n\nEngine and transmission\n\nA high-tech aluminum V-8 with four camshafts and variable valve timing delivers a beefy 330 horsepower, enough to motivate this big car to reach 60 mph in just over six seconds, according to Audi. Lightweight aluminum helps cut curb weight by about 300 pounds compared with a comparable steel structure.\n\nPower from the smallish 4.2-liter engine is spare off the line, but the muscle builds as the revs climb, accompanied by a subdued howl. Smooth and sophisticated, as befitting a top-drawer sedan, if not sharply quick.\n\nAudi’s famous quattro all-wheel-drive system delivers the power to the pavement.\n\nThe six-speed automatic transmission has Tiptronic manual shifting derived from Porsche. The automatic shifting is seamless.\n\nHandling and drivability\n\nThe quattro drive system helps make A8 sure-footed, along with the electronic stability control, highly responsive steering and powerful brakes.\n\nBut Adaptive Air Suspension system is the star of this show. Fully pneumatic suspension replaces conventional steel springing for continuous load leveling and stability control, plus automatic firmness and height adjustment.\n\nThere also is a three-position manual height and firmness adjustment for co mfort, performance or lift, which adds about an inch of ground clearance. I preferred the performance setting, called Dynamic, which made the suspension about an inch lower and stiffer. The comfort setting is way too soft. Mushy, even.\n\nYou can leave the settings in automatic, which allows the electronics to decide between comfort and performance. The aluminum structure, all new for 2004, feels stiff and resonant.\n\nStyling\n\nThe A8 L looks beautifully purposeful, hunkered over its huge wheels with stylishly short overhangs and sharply faceted accent lines. With the redesign, Audi completes a family resemblance that began with the A6 sedan.\n\nInterior\n\nTraditional values, with clean, uncluttered lines and wood trim, give the cabin a sense of warm security. Aside from a complete collection of comfort and convenience features, the test A8 included:\n\nA GPS navigation system that unfolds gracefully from the center of the dashboard or disappears altogether. It includes the driver information display for a variety of features.\n\nIntegrated digital phone with voice recognition.\n\nTwelve-speaker Bose audio with six-disc CD changer.\n\nDual zone climate control.\n\nOnStar communications.\n\nFour-position side air bags and curtains, plus knee air bags for the front seats.\n\nThe back seat is limo-large, with loads of accommodating features.\n\nPricing\n\nBase price for the A8 L is $68,500, which undercuts the competition by a few thousand. The test car included a convenience package with electric rear-window sunshade, rear vanity mirrors and tire pressure monitoring system, $1,200; 18-inch wheels with all-season tires, $1,150; cold weather package with heated seats and steering wheel and a ski sack, $1,100; Parktronic radar-assisted parking system front and rear, $700; dual-paned security glass, $600; and shipping, $690, for a total of $73,940.\n\nBottom line\n\nThough Audi’s flagship has never sold nearly as well as the S500, 745 or even the XK8, the A8 L could make some major inroads, offering a distinctive, well-equipped, performance sedan for the well-to-do.\n\nAudi A8 L\n\nVehicle type: Five-passenger, four-door sedan, all-wheel drive.\n\nBase price: $68,500.\n\nPrice as tested: $73,940.\n\nEngine: 4.2-liter V-8, 330 horsepower at 6,500 rpm, 317 pound-feet of torque at 3,500 rpm.\n\nTransmission: Six-speed automatic with Tiptronic.\n\nWheelbase: 121.1 inches.\n\nCurb weight: 4,399 pounds.\n\nEPA mileage: 17 city, 24 highway.\n\nHighs:\n\nHandsome styling.\n\nRoomy interior.\n\nInnovative features.\n\nLows:\n\nComplex electronic control.\n\nSoft off-the-line pickup.\n\nMushy “comfort” setting.",

      "expert_review": "Key Points\nNew Executive Plus Package combines heaps of luxury content into one easy-to-check box\nA8 returns up to 27 mpg on the highway; S8 boasts 563 horsepower\nPriced from $96,395 (all prices include destination)\n\nDating to 2019, the current-generation Audi A8 is awfully old for a luxury flagship, but the big sedan still has plenty of appeal. Its beautifully crafted cabin is tremendously comfortable and packed with all of the tech and sumptuousness one would expect at this price, and the S8 performance derivative boasts the sort of power that was reserved for elite sports cars not so long ago.\n\nFor 2026, there are no major changes to the A8 or S8. A new Executive Plus option package is available for both, combining the previously available Luxury and Executive bundles into one massive upgrade that includes heated, ventilated and massaging outboard rear seats, as well as additional safety tech such as automated parking and a head-up display.\n\nRelated: 2025 Audi A8: Updated Design, Expanded Tech and New Trim Options\n\nAvailability and Pricing\n\nThe 2026 Audi A8 and S8 are on sale now. Full pricing is as follows:\n\nA8: $96,395\nS8: $131,295\nWhat Are the 2026 Audi A8’s Trim Levels?\n\nAs Audi’s flagship sedan, the A8 is only available in a single trim level, and it is loaded. Standard equipment includes an adaptive air suspension with 20-inch wheels, LED headlights and organic light-emitting diode taillights, a panoramic moonroof, a power trunk lid, and keyless entry and start. Inside, the cabin is upholstered in genuine leather and features 22-way front seats with heating and ventilation, a heated steering wheel, four-zone automatic climate control, ambient lighting and rear window shades. In-car tech includes a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, a 10.1-inch touchscreen with navigation and a Bang & Olufsen sound system.\n\nThere’s more than just power to the S8, but most of its changes are aimed at corralling its almost 70% increase in output. It gets a sport-tuned adaptive air suspension, rear-wheel steering, a retuned rear differential, larger front brakes (15.8 inches versus the A8’s 14.8) and 21-inch wheels. Visual tweaks include Audi’s HD Matrix-design LED headlights, upgraded interior trim and metal pedals.\n\nStandard and Available Safety Features\n\nStandard safety tech on the 2026 A8 includes forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning, a 360-degree camera system and automatic high beams. The S8 includes no additional safety tech, but the Executive Plus Package available for both adds automated parking, blind spot monitors, lane-centering assist, adaptive cruise control and a head-up display. Night vision is available as a stand-alone option.\n\nWhat Are the 2026 Audi A8’s Powertrain Specs and MPG?\n\nThe A8 is powered by a turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 engine making 335 hp and 369 pounds-feet of torque. The S8 gets a twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 with 563 hp and 590 pounds-feet. Both are backed by an eight-speed automatic transmission and standard all-wheel drive. Audi says the A8 can accelerate from 0-60 mph in 5.6 seconds, and the S8 needs just 3.8 seconds. The A8 returns an EPA-rated 19/27/22 mpg city/highway/combined, while the S8 is rated at 15/24/18 mpg.\n\nRead More About the Audi A8 and S8:\n\nBlack Is Back: 2024 Audi A8, S8 Get Exterior Color Swap, Start at $89,995\n2023 Audi A8, S8 Tweak Tech, Interior Offerings\nResearch the Audi A8\nResearch the Audi S8\nRead More Audi News\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Audi A8?\n\nThe A8 is Audi’s largest, most luxurious and most expensive sedan. Sitting above the mid-size A6, the A8 competes with the BMW 7 Series, Mercedes-Benz S-Class and Genesis G90. The A8’s cabin offers abundant space in both rows, with indulgent options like massaging seats, reclining rear seats, and heated front and rear armrests. Getting the A8 down the road is a 335-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 engine coupled with an eight-speed automatic transmission. Audi’s Quattro all-wheel drive is standard. For added performance, the S8 comes with a 563-hp, twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8 that Audi says takes this plus-sized luxury machine from 0-60 mph in less than 4 seconds.  \n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Audi A8?\n\nThe A8 and S8 get a free six-month trial subscription to Audi Connect Plus with the Audi app store, enabling remote start and providing access to a variety of apps for music, video, navigation, news and more through the center screen. Sebring Black paint replaces Vesuvius Gray.    \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Audi A8 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nDual-screen infotainment system\n12.3-inch Virtual Cockpit digital gauge cluster\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nAdaptive air suspension\nPanoramic moonroof\nLeather upholstery\nWireless device charging\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nFour-zone automatic climate control\nPower rear sunshades\nBang & Olufsen stereo\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nMassaging front seats\nMassaging, power-adjustable rear seats\nHeated and ventilated rear seats\nHeated steering wheel\nHead-up display \nBlind spot warning \nRear cross-traffic alert\nFour-wheel steering\nShould I Buy the 2024 Audi A8?\n\nThe Audi A8 gets you down the road in sublime comfort and quietness. Its conservative approach to a full-size luxury sedan lacks some of the razzle-dazzle design and features found in rivals — like the expansive, 56-inch Hyperscreen display available in the Mercedes S-Class. Yet the A8 has more than enough power and prestige to satisfy the vast majority of car shoppers who can afford a top-of-the-line Audi sedan. Its cabin tech has a learning curve, but it’s highly customizable and has quick response times. Trunk space is just OK for a vehicle this size, however, and safety features like blind spot warning and rear cross-traffic alert should be standard equipment, but they aren’t.",

      "expert_review": "In America, we like things big: our trucks and SUVs, our hulking V-8 engines, even our super-sized French fries.\n\nThat may be why Audi decided, after it launched its A8 super luxury sedan in Europe, to bring to the United States only the long-wheelbase version, the A8 L.\n\nThat’s L as in longer, L as in legroom, L as in limo-like rear seating.\n\nWith a 121.1-inch wheelbase and an overall length of 204 inches, the L model is a full 5 inches longer than the standard A8. And all five of those inches have been located right inside each rear door, where long, sumptuous pockets of seating (more than 40 inches of legroom &#151; Yao!) give rear seat passengers that sense of being driven in a limousine.\n\nMake no mistake, this is one big car. And were it not for Audi’s use of an aluminum frame, aluminum body panels, aluminum suspension parts, and other lightweight materials throughout, this car would feel more like a big ol’ Bentley than the 21/4-ton executive sport sedan.\n\nWhat is remarkable is that, much as we like things big, this car drives small &#151; and that’s great.\n\nI fully expected, chauffeuring my kids to soccer, baseball, and softball games, that I’d feel just like that &#151; a chauffeur piloting the bosses around. I expected wide, sweeping corners on back roads, tough turns in the supermarket parking lot, big cruising on the highway.\n\nInstead, I got a surprisingly adept and snappy ride, and those extra 5 inches seemed to vanish into the thin air of agility.\n\nPart of that was the ability of a subtly powerful engine to haul around this big car. It is powered by a 4.2-liter V-8 that produces 330 horsepower and a tough-tugging 317 lb.-ft. of torque. Mated to a 6-speed Tiptronic transmission (thank you, Dr. Porsche) with a very low first gear, the engine delivered snapping takeoffs, steady power in steep climbs, quick acceleration out of corners, and sure, swift passing.\n\nAudi says it will do 0-60 in 6.3 seconds. Disc brakes of more than 14 inches in diameter up front and more than a foot in the rear, bring it to rapid, flat stops.\n\nAll that weight, length, power, and sudden stopping require flexible yet solid support, of course, and it is in the suspension system that the A8 L really shines.\n\nThe car features, as standard fare, an adaptive air suspension and automatic damping system that lets the driver choose among four settings and then goes to work in mega-computer fashion, making countless adjustments in milliseconds.\n\nSensors watch steering angle, wheel travel, braking, and acceleration, and adjust to intended driver input or error.\n\nCouple this system with Audi’s quattro all-wheel-drive system and you have one fine, stable, weather-beating, high-performing car.\n\nThe suspension system &#151; air bellows combined with twin tube shock absorbers, air suspension struts, a compressor and pres sure tank &#151; can be set on automatic, dynamic, comfort, or lift.\n\nAutomatic runs the car according to terrain and performance; dynamic offers stiff damping for fast, hard driving and lowers the car automatically at speeds greater than 75 miles per hour; comfort softens the ride for highway cruising; lift gives the car nearly 6 inches of ground clearance &#151; certainly not in the SUV zone, but a nice touch if you want to use that AWD system to get through fresh-fallen New England snows.\n\nInside, all that space is elegantly appointed with sweeping swaths of leather and gleaming touches of wood and brushed metals.\n\nCentral to the cockpit is what Audi calls its multimedia interface, or MMI. Now, I am no fan of over-complicated systems (see BMW 7 Series) that tangle you up as you try to complete even the simplest of tasks (say, switching the radio from AM to FM). But Audi’s system did start to grow on me, although I think it would take many days in th car for it to become an intuitive operation.\n\nThe MMI features a series of buttons on the center console behind the shifter. They are arranged around a center control that turns like a knob and is clicked up and down like a computer mouse. In various combinations and through menus and sub-menus, the knobs and buttons control suspension, audio, climate, and navigation systems, among other functions. Much of what can be done by reaching for that collection of controls can also be done through buttons on the steering wheel.\n\nAudi gives you two choices of watching what you are doing: functions can be displayed on a pop-up, 7-inch screen at center dash, or, that screen lowered, functions appear in a smaller screen between the gauges behind the steering wheel.\n\nThis is not an inexpensive car, of course.\n\nStart with a base price near $69,000, add a few optional packages: winter package (heated front and rear seats, heated steering wheel, ski sack for thru-door in rear seat &#151; $1,100); convenience package (electric rear sun shade, front seat ventilation, rear seat vanity mirrors, tire pressure monitors &#151; $2,500); 19-inch, 12-spoke wheels ($700); and you are suddenly tooling around in a $75,000 automobile.\n\nThe US market will not get the shorter version of the A8, though an S8 model is coming. Both will go up against such luxury rigs as the BMW 7 Series; S-Class Mercedes-Benz; and Jaguar XJ.\n\nWith its light snappiness, electronic wizardry, luxury, and remarkable ride, it will compete just fine.\n\nNice touch: The heft of the four-spoke steering wheel. You can feel the car through its bulk even as it gives a perfectly clear view of all gauges.\n\nAnnoyance: Why with such a roomy rear seat should the middle passenger have to sit on a lump?",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Audi A8?\n\nThe 2023 A8 is Audi’s largest, most luxurious, most expensive sedan. Sitting above the mid-size A6, the A8 competes with the BMW 7 Series, Genesis G90 and Mercedes-Benz S-Class. The A8’s cabin offers abundant space in both rows, with indulgent options like massaging seats, reclining rear seats, and heated front and rear armrests. Getting the A8 down the road is a 335-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 engine coupled with an eight-speed automatic transmission; Audi’s Quattro all-wheel drive is standard. For added performance, the S8 comes with a 563-hp, twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Audi A8?\n\nFresh from a styling update for the 2022 model year, the 2023 version of the A8 has only a few minor changes. The optional Comfort Plus Package now includes HD matrix-design LED headlights, and remote park assist is newly grouped into the available Executive Package.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Audi A8 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nDual-screen infotainment system\n12.3-inch Virtual Cockpit digital gauge cluster\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nAdaptive air suspension\nPanoramic moonroof\nLeather upholstery\nWireless device charging\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nFour-zone automatic climate control\nPower rear sunshades\nBang & Olufsen stereo\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nMassaging front seats\nMassaging, power-adjustable rear seats\nHeated and ventilated rear seats\nHeated steering wheel\nHead-up display \nBlind spot warning \nRear cross-traffic alert\nFour-wheel steering\nShould I Buy the 2023 Audi A8?\n\nThe A8 gets you down the road in sublime comfort and quietness. Its conservative approach to a full-size luxury sedan lacks some of the razzle-dazzle design and features found in rivals, such as the 56-inch Hyperscreen display available in the Mercedes S-Class, yet it has more than enough power and prestige to satisfy the vast majority of car shoppers who can afford a top-of-the-line Audi sedan. The cabin tech has a learning curve, but it’s highly customizable and has quick response times. Trunk space is just OK for a vehicle this size, however, and safety features like blind spot warning and rear cross-traffic alert should be standard equipment, but they aren’t.",

      "expert_review": "Aluminum, according to Audi, is the way to go with a full-scale luxury barge, trimming its weight so that it’s not as heavy as a battleship.\n\n“Class without mass,” Audi says, revealing the corporation’s poetic side.\n\nTeamed up with Alcoa, the German automaker spent 10 years developing an aluminum space-frame system that would be rigid, crashworthy and considerably lighter than a comparable steel structure. During that decade, Audi teased auto-show attendees with such aluminum treats as the superb, silver Avus show car and the early prototype of a large sedan.\n\nWhat emerged is the delicious production A8 sedan, as splendid and sophisticated a luxury car as you’d ever hope to encounter.\n\nThe A8 is quite a flagship for Audi, which just a few years ago was on the ropes and ready to go facedown in the American arena. The big car shows that Audi is back, having made inroads in the U.S. market with its midsize A6 and compact A4 sedans, not to mention the chic A4 convertible.\n\nFor ’97, a more-confident Audi added to both ends of its lineup, with the exclusive A8 on the high-price side and a less-expensive version of the A4 on the other.\n\nThe A8 offers well-heeled motorists features that are unique in its upscale class, such as the exotic aluminum construction and Audi’s trademark Quattro all-wheel-drive system. It also contains the classic virtues of beautiful wood trim, fragrant leather seats and a powerful engine that have been part of high-end automobiles since the days of Duesenberg.\n\nInstead of following in the lead of its more-popular German brethren, the A8 heads out on its own road, presenting a clear alternative to the esteemed Mercedes-Benz S-Class or BMW 7-Series. The styling is not quite as taut as its competitors, the Audi presenting a more conservative image. But it’s trim and beautiful, nonetheless.\n\nOnly two other automobiles being sold in the United States are constructed with an aluminum frame and body, and they are definitely on the exotic side of the street: the Acura NSX mid-engine sports car and the General Motors EV-1 electric car.\n\nThere’s nothing about the A8 that would hint at the aluminum structure, aside from a few brushed-aluminum styling cues in the interior. Otherwise, if no one told you it was made from anything other than steel, you wouldn’t know it.\n\nAt about 3,900 pounds, the sedan still has some substantial poundage, until you start figuring in its large dimensions, its full cargo of luxury features and power accessories, and its Quattro system.\n\nAn ultrasmooth 300-horsepower V-8 provides considerable pull for the A8 Quattro, our test car. Audi says this car can hit 60 in under seven seconds, and I believe it. The power comes on in a smooth, seamless rush, matched up with a similarly ultrasmooth five-speed automatic transmission.\n\nOne of my favorite places to test the pulling power of a high-performance car or truck is the long mountain grade on I-17 just north of Black Canyon City. The A8 shot right up there with amazing ease, maintaining freeway speed without difficulty and making the incline feel like level terrain.\n\nThe A8 also shines on twisting back roads and long stretches of high-speed freeway, both of which can be partially attributed to the stiffness of the aluminum platform. Poise, handling, stability and long-legged cruising are all first rate, with passengers pampered in a quiet, roomy cabin with just a whisper of wind and road noise.\n\nOf course, you can always crank up the terrific Bose stereo, which comes standard.\n\nThe interior is marred by the collection of tiny buttons and controls that work the stereo, climate control and other systems. They are too small and fussy, too hard to engage while trying to watch the highway and too hard to differentiate without studying them. Perhaps a driver would get used to them in time, but there are better ways.\n\nBut that’s a pretty minor complaint for this technological tour de force.\n\nMe anwhile all this lightness and lushness does affect another aspect of this luxury car, and that’s the bottom line. Hovering near the $65,000 mark, only a select few will own the A8: Those who can afford such a fine machine while also appreciating the differences that make the A8 so special.\n\n1997 Audi A8\n\nVehicle type: Five-passenger, four-door sedan, all-wheel-drive. Base price: $64,500. Price as tested: $68,700. Engine: 4.2-liter V-8, 400 horsepower at 6,000 rpm, 295 pound-feet of torque at 3,300 rpm. Transmission: Five-speed automatic. Curb weight: 3,902 pounds. Length: 198.2 inches. Wheelbase: 113 inches. Safety features: Dual air bags, anti-lock brakes. EPA fuel economy: 17 mpg city, 28 mpg highway.

      "expert_review": "Anyone below a certain age read Mad magazine while growing up. Since my parents were grateful that I read anything (besides TV Guide), they gladly let me buy it, despite its contents.\n\nOf course, my juvenile reading habits don’t mean anything. But in several issues, there’s a saying from Alfred E. Neuman, the magazine’s gap-toothed mascot. Not “What, me worry?,” but another I clearly remember.\n\nWith all the grumpiness of an editor who has to dream up these things, Alf said that the aluminum soda can won’t rust out as quickly as today’s cars.\n\nMaybe someone at Audi was listening.\n\nAll right, I know no one was listening. It’s simple why Audi uses so much aluminum in its new top-of-the-line A8. It’s lighter than steel.\n\nThis is no small thing when competing in the luxo-sedan league. An automaker has to stuff all the latest gadgets into an attractive package, and all those comforts add weight. So Audi makes extensive use of aluminum (including engine, space frame and body shell) to save weight and make the car that much faster.\n\nSpeed doesn’t seem to be something missing, thanks to 230 horsepower and 235 foot-pounds of torque available through Audi’s five-speed automatic transmission. Power is seamless and comes on strong and silent. The five-speed transmission snicks off the shifts with a velvety smoothness. Zero-60 comes up in 8.3 seconds. But, like most German automobiles, this number is deceptive.\n\nPower at highway speeds is phenomenal, and that’s where this car feels most in its element. Puttering around town, it’s a shadow of its faster self.\n\nIf you need more speed, go for the optional 4.2-liter engine. With 300 horses and 295 foot-pounds of torque, it will speed to 60 mph in 6.9 seconds.\n\nAlthough the ride is firm, it will require no kidney belts on the part of its occupants. Muted thumps make their presence felt, but it’s in no way obtrusive.\n\nStops are short and secure, thanks to four-wheel anti-lock disc brakes. Other safety features include not only dual front air bags, but air bags in each door as well.\n\nWhen you get to the head of the class, lots of luxo-stuff is expected. Audi delivers with such niceties as dual-zone climate control, front and rear fog lamps, heated leather seats and acres of beautiful walnut trim.\n\nThe design is functional and restrained, with an unexpected warmth despite the car’s Germanic heritage. It is done well — but just be sure to have your dealer show you where the headlamp switch is. Its location is a bit offbeat.\n\nSeating is as firm as the ride, with bucket seats that hold you in place for the task at hand. There’s not so much give as you might expect. Rear-seat passengers are treated well, with vents in the back of the center console and just ahead of each rear door. Leg room is good, but some might wish for more foot room, despite the plentiful supply under each seat.\n\nIf you think this luxury sedan sounds like to o many others, take a look at the details that make this one so fine. The window glass is double pane to reduce noise. Indeed, it’s quite quiet, with little sound to annoy passengers. The materials are stout — it seems there was thought placed everywhere, even down to the small brushed-aluminum surround on the transmission lever.\n\nTop it all off with Audi’s smooth up-to-date styling, with a short high deck and expertly finished exterior, and you have one fine touring sedan, one that stands out in a sea of Bimmers and Benzes.\n\nAnd its performance is so good, you don’t have to be Mad to buy an Audi.\n\n1998 AUDI A8 3.7L Standard: 3.7-liter double overhead cam V6, anti-lock braking system, speed-sensitive power steering, dual front air bags, four-seat mounted air bags, anti-theft alarm with remote locking, front and rear fog lamps, dual power mirrors with defogger, dual zone climate control, 14-way power driver’s seat with four memory positions, power sunroof, walnut inlays, cruise control, auto-dimming rear-view mirror, five-speed transmission, leather seating.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nBuilt largely of aluminum, Audis flagship sedan gains a Symphony II stereo with an in-dash six-CD changer for 2002. The Porsche-developed Tiptronic five-speed-automatic transmission adds a Sport mode that can hold each gear longer while accelerating. Manual gear selection can be achieved by using rocker switches on the steering wheel. An improved lateral-skid control system called Electronic Stabilization Program is installed and incorporates Brake Assist. New options include a tire-pressure monitor and a communication system called Audi Telematics by OnStar.\n\nThe full-size sedan comes in two sizes: the regular A8 and the stretched A8 L, which rides a longer wheelbase. Both use a 310-horsepower, 4.2-liter V-8 engine and drive Audis permanently engaged quattro all-wheel-drive system. Side-impact airbags are mounted in all four doors, and curtain-type airbags deploy along the side windows during a side-impact collision.\n\nA high-performance S8 sedan joined the lineup in the spring of 2001 and comes fitted with a 360-hp version of the V-8 power plant.\n\nExterior\nAll Audi sedans bear a family resemblance, but the A8 is the largest model in the lineup. In standard form, the A8 rides a 113.4-inch wheelbase and measures 198.2 inches long  about 6 inches longer than the midsize A6. The A8 L sedan is a little more than 5 inches longer than the regular A8 in both wheelbase and body length, stretching 118.5 and 203.3 inches, respectively. Most of that extra length shows up in the rear doors. Both versions are 79 inches wide and 56.6 inches tall.\n\nMost A8 body and suspension parts, as well as its skeletonlike frame, are made of aluminum. Audi claims that this makes the sedan 300 to 500 pounds lighter, stronger and more fuel efficient than rivals that are built mainly of steel.\n\nInterior\nThe A8 L sedans interior differs mainly in rear legroom, which is nearly 3 inches greater than that in the base model. As a result, backseat passengers in the A8 L luxuriate in limousinelike accommodations. Standard leather upholstery comes in a choice of five colors. Two decorative wood inlay types are available: burled walnut or polished sycamore.\n\nSteering-wheel controls can operate the audio system, Tiptronic automatic transmission and cellular phone. The steering column has power tilt and telescoping features. Power front windows have one-touch up/down operation. A Premium comfort option package includes heated front and rear seats, a heated steering wheel and a power rear sunshade.\n\nUnder the Hood\nGenerating 310 hp, the A8s 4.2-liter V-8 engine works with a Porsche-derived Tiptronic five-speed-automatic transmission and Audis permanently engaged quattro all-wheel-drive system. This transmission permits manually selected gear changes using controls mounted on the steering wheel. Audi claims a 0-to-60-mph acceleration time of 6.7 seconds. A 360-hp version of the 4.2-liter V-8 with higher compression goes into the high-performance S8 sedan.\n\nSafety\nThe A8 leads the league in airbags with a total of eight. Beyond the required front airbags for the driver and front passenger, four door-mounted side-impact airbags protect the occupants of outboard seating positions. Two curtain-type airbags drop from the roof lining and deploy along the side windows in both the front and back during a side collision.\n\nAntilock brakes are standard, and an emergency inside trunk release handle has been installed. An optional Parktronic sonar system detects obstacles to the front and rear of the vehicle while parking it.\n\nDriving Impressions\nThe A8 possesses just about every posh comfort and convenience feature that a reasonable person could want, and it delivers a thoroughly luxurious experience. Though its not a flashy automobile, the A8 is a superlative, subtly sophisticated road car that aims to please its fortunate driver.\n\nPerformance is brisk and assertive, and the ride is close to blissful; the A8s handling is highly adept. Quattro all-wheel-drive handling gives Audis largest model a leg up on its rear-drive rival, the newly redesigned BMW 7 Series, when the pavement becomes slick. This Audi feels lighter than the Mercedes-Benz S-Class and tops the elegant rear-drive Jaguar XJ for surefooted highway behavior.\n\nSpace inside is huge  more so in the long-wheelbase A8 L  and the interior is filled with handsome wood and leather. Passing and merging are accomplished without a worry as the energetic V-8 responds forcefully. Automatic-transmission upshifts are gentle, and downshifts are prompt and positive.\n\nThe A8 is exceptionally easy to drive. Once you get accustomed to the sedans abundant dimensions, the A8 is highly stable on the highway and maintains its composure through quick curves. The suspension reacts to any sort of pavement assault, which minimizes distraction to the cars occupants even when rough spots occur. Engine noise is satisfyingly muted, but road sounds emerge on certain surfaces and noise is not absent.\n\nIn general, the controls are excellent, but some arent located in the most convenient spots. Visibility is good, except for thick B-pillars that limit the view over the drivers left shoulder. Seats are comfortable and supportive, despite rather short bottoms. The A8s trunk is huge and easy to load. All told, the sedan feels solid and tight with terrific panel fit, as if created from a single block of aluminum.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com;\nFrom the cars.com 2002 Buying Guide;\nPosted on 4/15/02",

      "expert_review": "There will be nothing critical in this review.\n\nI should probably recuse myself from even writing about the 2010 Audi R8 5.2 FSI V-10 because I love this car.\n\nI will not be fair and balanced or even objective because life behind the wheel of the R8 5.2 FSI is one viewed through a rose-colored windshield. I am the Fox News of car reviews today for conservative drivers and MSNBC for those who lean so far left they’re actually facing backwards.\n\nOh, there are probably a few bad things that could be said about this supercar. I didn’t test the R tronic sequential manual/automatic transmission, which is abysmal on the V-8 model. And if I had $10 in my pocket, I’d only need $145,990 more to buy the base model.\n\nSo why review it? First of all, it’s my job, and second of all, Audi handed me the keys. Trust me, if Audi came to you and offered you a chance to drive around a more powerful R8, you’d figure out how to take out a second mortgage for a week’s worth of gas. (Technically, the R8 5.2 FSI gets 20 miles per gallon on the highway, but that’s only if you drive it like a girly man. I barely managed 11 mpg after repeated acceleration drills along Lafayette Boulevard.) I may not have thought the R8 needed two more cylinders — eight seemed plenty enough for the mid-engine supercar. But I was wrong, this car is so good it brings out the bad in you.\n\nWrap a halo around this devil, tie it in a bow, and hit the gas — 3.7 seconds later, you’re getting a speeding ticket.\n\nThere are lots of facts and figures I could include on the newest R8 to join Audi’s growing family. There’s the all-wheel drive system that lets the R8 pass cars from impossible angles. It’s not surefooted; it takes corners like a life-sized Tyco slot car — you can hit 90 degree city corners at 40 mph with surgical precision — well, maybe not surgical, but try that in a Mustang. Audi’s magnetic ride active dampening system allows you to fine tune the aluminum double wishbone suspension to near perfection.\n\nThe car gods must be German. After all, it’s one of the few countries with a highway system that dares you to go faster — and the R8 V-10 has a top speed of 196.4 mph — though in Germany it sounds better to say 316 kilometers per hour. Why else would Audi encase the 525-horsepower V-10 in glass, if not to provide the automotive overseers a chance to glimpse down at that direct injection piece of mechanical madness. Das ist gut.\n\nAusgezeichnet.\n\nFreakish museum piece There’s something freakishly cool about the elongated body. The 104.3-inch wheelbase looks as if it stretches much farther. The car looks disproportionate but right at the same time. There’s an awkward curiosity; you look at the R8 the same way you might stare at a person 8 feet tall. You’re going to tell someone about it later.\n\nAudi has added a few more special touches to this R8. The LED headlamps, both high beam and low beam, as well as the LED brow that has become an Audi signature, are standard on the R8 5.2 FSI. They are pieces of art. The whole front end should be cast in bronze and put in the Louvre for future generations. And the bulging backside looks like a space ship with its dual oval exhaust pipes and black swaths of plastic connecting everything.\n\nThere’s even some subtle symbolism in the 2010’s R8’s design: Each daytime running light uses 24 LEDs and there are 24 vents surrounding the engine cover. Audi has 24 wins at LeMans. Coincidence? I think not.\n\nA car made for drivers And it’s no accident that the R8 is so comfortable. The black leather seats and leather-covered dash seem a little cold and mechanical. The silver aluminum trim throughout the cabin carries that theme forward. This is not a warm and fuzzy kind of cabin; it’s designed for the driver, a serious one at that.\n\nThe open-face plate for the six-speed manual transmission exposes each gate and it looks like a machined rib cage. It rewards the driver with a frozen click with every gear shift.\n\nEven the MMI system, a single wheel-like switch on the center console, allows the driver to remotely move through the car’s controls quickly. Once you learn how to use it, you never have to look down at the buttons to find what you need.\n\nThere are the typical features you’d expect from a luxury supercar: Bluetooth connectivity, back up camera, and even a Bang & Olufsen 465-watt 12-speaker sound system. It feels luxurious through and through.\n\nLike any other supercar, there isn’t much room. There’s a small trunk under the hood — enough room for a gym bag — and some room behind the two seats.\n\nEverywhere you drive the R8, people will look. It’s inevitable. How can they not? With its growling engine and daytime running lights, this car stands out — among the reasons a person buys it. Everyone seems to love it.\n\nNow, there is one person in greater Metro Detroit who may not care for the R8.\n\nHe was driving next to me along Woodward Avenue, no doubt staring at me cruising up to Ferndale. What he wasn’t looking at was the car stopped at the traffic light in front of him.\n\nPoor guy, he was driving an Audi too.\n\nsburgess@detnews.com (313) 223-3217\n\n2010 Audi R8 5.2 FSI V-10\n\nType: Two-passenger, all-wheel drive supercar\n\nPrice: $146,000\n\nEngine: 5.2-liter direct injection V-10\n\nPower: 525 horsepower, 391-pound-feet torque\n\nTransmission: 6-speed manual or R tronic sequential manual\n\nEPA gas mileage: (manual) 12 mpg city / 20 mpg highway; (R tronic) 13 mpg city / 20 mpg highway\n\nReport Card\n\nOverall: ****\n\nExterior: Excellent. Long, low body gives the R8 a distinctive look. It looks like a supercar because it is a supercar.\n\nInterior: Excellent. Spacious and comfortable, the interior may feel cold to some passengers, but it focuses on the driver.\n\nPerformance: Super excellent. Balanced, taut suspension and powerful engine mounted over the rear axle make this car feel like a race car.\n\nPros : Beautiful sports car that remains one of the best cars for the money.\n\nCons: It requires a lot of money.\n\nGrading scale\n\n**** Excellent *** Good ** Fair * Poor",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The A8 L is a big, luxurious sedan — but at this price, it needs to be more than just comfortable, and the car lacks the “wow factor” its rivals have.\n\nVersus the competition: Other vehicles in this class offer more pizazz and better powertrains, but the A8 L remains a comfortable, sure-footed cruiser — and it offers some value, as well.\n\nThe redesigned 2019 Audi A8 L is the fourth generation of Audi’s largest and most luxurious sedan. It’s stuffed full of luxury features and technology, but as it comes to American shores it feels a bit incomplete. Our jealousy of the European auto market usually has to do with the abundance of fun hatchbacks and wagons they get that we never do. In the case of the A8 L, we get the car — but not all of the features.\n\nThanks to an array of 24 sonic, camera and radar sensors, the A8 L in Europe can be outfitted with Level 3 autonomous capability. But due to regulatory issues and a lack of uniformity among U.S. roads, the system won’t be coming here — and if you buy a 2019 A8 L here, Audi says it can’t be updated to use the system because the U.S.-spec car won’t come with all the necessary hardware. Darn.\n\nEven without this system, there are still plenty of changes for the new A8 L: Its engine options have been condensed and exterior styling has been tweaked, but most notable is a new control scheme in the center console that largely eliminates conventional mechanical controls. Compare the 2019 A8 L with last year’s model.\n\nCompetition for the A8 L is stiff, including the BMW 7 Series, Mercedes-Benz S-Class and Lexus LS 500. Compare all of these cars.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nLast year’s model offered both a V-6 and V-8 engine option, but there’s only a turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 that’s new for the 2019 sedan, making 335 horsepower and 369 pounds-feet of torque. It also features a mild-hybrid system that both supports the engine and doubles as the main electrical system for the vehicle, powering the infotainment, luxury and driver assistance features. An eight-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive are standard.\n\nThese specs set the Audi apart from its competitors, which offer versions of their flagship sedans with gigantic V-8s (or even V-12s) making gobs of power. The turbo V-6 is it for the A8 L (though an S8 L that’s rumored to show up in 2020 is bound to have more power).\n\nThe powertrain is up to the task of moving the A8 L’s significant 4,751 pounds of bulk around, but it does so with less impetus than I’d like. Like most luxury vehicles, the A8 L offers a few drive modes: Comfort, Auto, Dynamic and Individual. In Comfort and Auto, I noticed a problem in the A8 L that’s common among the Audis we’ve tested of late: lackadaisical accelerator response. I much preferred the feeling of the steering in Dynamic mode, which adds sufficient weight to the wheel and makes it easier to keep the car centered.\n\nThe different drive modes also change the suspension feel. In Comfort mode, the ride has an agreeable plushness, with impressive isolation and true luxury composure. There’s a noticeable amount of body roll in this mode, but not so much that it threw me or the car off balance. Dynamic mode tightens up the suspension noticeably; it was my preferred setting on winding roads, but other than that, it was pretty much Comfort all the time.\n\nI was thankful for the A8 L’s Individual mode, which allowed me to put the car in my preferred setup (suspension in Comfort, steering and powertrain in Dynamic). Ideally that’s what Auto mode would be able to figure out on its own, but it’s a maddening middle ground instead.\n\nThe A8 L offers a few other suspension upgrades, including all-wheel steering and a predictive active suspension. The predictive active suspension scans the road ahead and can adjust the suspension for upcoming bumps or imperfections in the road, as well as raise or lower the height of each wheel to make the ride even more comfortable.\n\nUp Front\n\nThe A8 L features Audi’s new center console design that forgoes many physical controls in favor of a pair of touchscreens. There are a few touch-sensitive buttons beneath the lower screen — covered in black plastic that makes them appear to be part of the screen — but the vast majority of the car’s functions are controlled within the two screens. Even the car’s vents have touch-sensitive controls to turn them on and off.\n\nThis echoes a change that’s made its way across the Jaguar Land Rover lineup, starting with the Range Rover Velar. There are some key differences between the two systems, however, that work in Audi’s favor. The first is that the lower screen doesn’t have a series of menus to swipe through; it’s mostly static. The shortcuts up top can be customized, but the climate controls are locked into place.\n\nThe second is that it’s easier to tell when you’ve activated something because the system comes with haptic feedback response. Button presses are met with a satisfying bump sensation you feel and a click you hear. The system works on both the lower and upper screens (though if you activate smartphone mirroring with Android Auto or Apple CarPlay, the click goes away).\n\nI would still prefer physical controls for things like climate control, drive mode and a tuning knob, but there is a case to be made for Audi’s direction in terms of future-proofing and getting consumers used to these larger, touch-based interfaces. But it also means there’s a bit of a learning curve to the system, even if it’s not as large an obstacle as I first thought it would be. The screen’s feedback when you do activate something is helpful, and the screens are placed well — easy to reach from either of the front seats without leaning forward too far. If I have to use a touchscreen, this is a setup I ended up liking. One thing to watch out for: The screens are fingerprint magnets, so keep a microfiber cloth handy — in sunlight it’s hard to see and just looks dirty.\n\nThe cabin does have some drawbacks. It’s lacking in front storage, and there are only two USB ports throughout the whole car (the backseat is especially egregious, with only a pair of 12-volt outlets). The wireless charging pad is in the center storage bin, which makes it super shallow — you can fit maybe your phone and a pack of gum in there. There’s also no storage compartment for sunglasses, the door pockets aren’t especially large, and the center of the dashboard is taken up by the screens, meaning there’s no good place to store any of the miscellaneous objects people like to keep in their vehicles.\n\nThe backseat area is massive, with what feels like an acre of space between the rear seats and the front ones. Audi offers the A8 L in both four- and five-seat configurations depending on the number of rear seats you need. My test vehicle came with the Rear Comfort Package and five seats, so it didn’t have the ultimate comfort of a padded, massaging footrest on the passenger side, but there was still plenty to like in back. The outboard seats are heated and ventilated, and will even give you a light massage. There’s a small tablet that pops out of the fold-down armrest that can control the seats and the car’s various entertainment functions.\n\nStill Plenty of Safety Features …\n\nI could spend more time lamenting what the A8 L doesn’t have, but what it does have works pretty well. Its list of safety technology is long and formidable, though little of it is standard — strange for a car that costs this much (the A8 L starts at $84,795 including destination charges). Forward automatic emergency braking, front and rear parking sensors, and a backup camera are pretty much all you get without paying extra. I know it’s unfair to harp only on Audi for this when competitors do it, too, so I’m going to harp on all the luxury cars in this price range: Add more standard safety features!\n\nMy car also came with Audi’s Driver Assistance Package ($2,750), which adds adaptive cruise control with traffic jam assist, lane keep assist and a feature Audi calls Turn Assist, which monitors oncoming traffic when you’re making unprotected left turns (turns without an arrow, where oncoming traffic has the right of way). The package also adds exit assist, which detects oncoming bike riders or vehicles as you attempt to open the door from inside and locks it to prevent a collision. The Executive Package ($4,150) added a lot of luxury features, including lane change assist, a rear pre-collision detection system, and a 360-degree camera system with many customizable views.\n\nThe systems work as advertised. Audi’s traffic jam assist is a low-speed system that allows the car to come to a complete stop in traffic and helps with steering (but you have to keep a hand on the wheel for the system to remain active). The lane centering is pretty good; the car doesn’t bounce noticeably from side to side in the lane, and the system seems to work well in a variety of lighting conditions. There’s one system, however, that I would leave off: Predictive Control, which ties the cruise control speed to the car’s traffic sign recognition system. It gets confused by various signs, such as the lower speed limits for off ramps or the signs for trucks or trailers, much like I found in a 2018 Audi A5 I tested in 2017.\n\n… But It Needs the Missing One\n\nI keep coming back to the A8 L’s missing autonomous functionality because I think the car really needs something like that to spice it up. As is, the A8 L is a big, comfortable cruiser with above-average ride quality and lots of luxurious materials and technology on the inside, but it’s missing a certain “wow” factor you get in competitors — whether it be the S-Class’ stellar materials, the 7 Series’ big engine options or the LS 500’s … well, maybe the Lexus has some work to do, as well.\n\nMy test vehicle checked in at $101,095 after adding its various options. This isn’t nearly the top of the pricing heights to which the A8 L can climb; you can option one up to over $120,000 with relative ease, especially if you opt for the $7,550 two-passenger Executive Rear Seat Comfort Package (the three-passenger Rear Seat Comfort Package in my test vehicle has fewer additions and cost only an extra $3,500). But at my test car’s lower price, I found myself wanting more.\n\nThough the A8 L is a good vehicle by any objective measure, much of it feels too ordinary to give it lasting appeal over competitors. At this price, and against this set of rivals, good isn’t good enough.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The 2011 Audi A8 is a magical car that can quickly transport you to the adventure fantasy of your choice. After pressing the A8’s ignition button, my routine-filled world transformed into something fantastic. Suddenly, my husband was now actor Daniel Craig, my kids disappeared and my cotton hoodie and comfy jeans were replaced with a silky gown, diamonds and stilettos. Driving the A8 brings this 007 level of adventure and luxury to your daily commute as no other car can.\n\nThe A8’s styling is beyond attractive, inside and out. I’ve always had a fondness for Audi’s signature swoop of LED running lights; we like to call them eyelashes and they are stunning. While the A8 is a full-size sedan, I was willing to forgo my small-car-loving tendencies for the duration of this test drive. The A8 also comes in a long-wheelbase version.\n\nAt first, I wondered if it would be a touchy car to drive. As soon as I pulled up the menu of drive-style options, I was reassured that the all-wheel-drive A8 was no pompous prince. This was a sexy, thrill-seeking genius up for a challenge. Each day I toyed with the different drive options — Comfort, Auto, Sport and Individual, which is programmable.\n\nThe Comfort driving mode accelerated and decelerated evenly, and the steering was as effortless as stirring your morning cup of Joe. Auto mode felt similar to Comfort mode, perhaps a little gutsier, though. Dynamic mode was definitely intense and required a stronger steering arm and quicker driver response times. Hit the gas as you turn in Dynamic mode and you may wind up spinning out if you’re not paying attention (I know, fun stuff, right?). I wound up in Individual mode and programmed it to be a happy combination of Comfort and Dynamic modes.\n\nThe only drawback I found to driving the A8 was its price. The A8 starts at $78,050, and my test car cost a cool $93,525. I didn’t want to park it in my normal grocery-store parking space; I felt more comfortable parking the A8 way out in the boonies where it would be safer. When the wind blew my son’s scooter onto the driver’s side door, I nearly had to call an ambulance because my heart stopped for so long. “No! Not the A8,” I cried. The A8 created in me some hyper-sensitive tendencies that less expensive vehicles have not.\n\nEXTERIOR\nRuggedly handsome, the A8 is your favorite Hollywood hero … in a tux. Enthusiasts will rave over the perfect seams along the A8’s body; there are no gaps, even in the rear where four pieces of sheet metal come together with shocking precision. It’s so seamless that I couldn’t even spot all four pieces. Take a gander at the A8 and try to find a flaw, I dare you.\n\nWhat most caught my eye was the massive chrome grille. Chrome means shimmer, which makes me smile. I do love sparkly things, just as much today as when I was 5.\n\nAs a low-to-the-ground sedan, the A8 was easy to get in and out of. What made this car extra-special was its ability to lower itself when you press the unlock button on the key fob. It’s a car that greets you with a curtsy.\n\nThe A8’s ease of use carried through to the trunk, which could be opened with the key fob or a button inside the driver’s door. I was surprised to find that my test car had a power trunklid, a feature I’ve only seen on SUVs and taller crossover vehicles. Turns out it’s just as helpful and convenient on a sedan.\n\nThe A8 has a 372-horsepower, 4.2-liter V-8 engine with an eight-speed automatic transmission. The A8 uses premium gas and gets an EPA-estimated 17/27 mpg city/highway.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Excellent\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Groove-On\n\nINTERIOR\nThe A8’s interior was so pretty that it was precious. Many cars incorporate wood, suede and metal in their interiors, but none I’ve seen to date compare to the A8’s elegance that held its own against my family. You can sense no expense was spared and no detail overlooked.\n\nFor 2011, the Multi Media Interface system has been updated with a touch-pad that allows you to write your selections with your fingertip. Yep, it’s like finger-painting but in the car. Let’s say you’re entering a street name for a navigation destination. First, you write the first letter of the street on the touch-pad, then the next and the next until the system fills in the remainder of the street name. This system is also able to recognize Chinese, Japanese and Korean characters.\n\nThe five-seater comes with a 12-speaker Bose audio system as standard, but a premium Bang & Olufsen system is available with 19 speakers. It also boasts a factory-installed WLAN hotspot to keep you in touch and productive no matter where you’re parked. It also offers wireless access for gadgets of all kinds.\n\nBeyond button pressing, the interior was comfortable and roomy. I hopped into the second row to check it out for myself and had a good 8 inches of space between my knees and the driver’s seatback. The second-row seats have bolsters that make it feel cozy, but not intrusive.\n\nEveryone had plenty of snug cupholders and ashtrays. I could’ve done without the ashtrays, but the kids used them as added storage for their stuff. I liked the flip-top storage cubbies in the armrests on the doors. Other than a pack of gum, I couldn’t find anything that would fit in there, but nooks and crannies are always exciting.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSAFETY\nThe A8 is loaded with the latest in safety features.\n\nIt has standard all-wheel drive, four-wheel-disc antilock brakes with brake assist, an electronic stability system, traction control and eight airbags, including side curtains and seat-mounted side airbags for the four outboard seats.\n\nThe sedan has the following optional features: blind spot warning system, a lane departure warning system, a night vision system, a forward collision warning system, and front and rear parking sensors with a backup camera.\n\nThe A8 has two sets of lower Latch anchors in the outboard seats. The anchors were difficult to access because they were buried in the seat cushions, which were difficult to move out of the way.

      "expert_review": "The right rear wheel struck a curb. The impact ripped the tire. But the 2000 Audi A8 L Quattro sedan remained stable. I was impressed.\n\nI was equally impressed by Audi Roadside Assistance, a 24-hour emergency service operated in conjunction with AAA. The Audi representative said help would arrive within 90 minutes. The auto club showed up 40 minutes later.\n\nThis was in downtown Washington on a Wednesday afternoon. Traffic was heavy. I thought I’d be there forever.\n\nBut Audi has a way of surprising. The new A8 is a case in point. It’s the best luxury sedan I’ve driven.\n\nThis is hard to write for a man who loves Cadillacs. But drive an A8 and you’ll understand.\n\nCadillac’s leaders, the DeVille DTS and DHS, are superb luxmobiles in the grand American style. They are big, comfortable, well-made, powerful and attractive in the mainstream.\n\nBut they are not the Audi A8 &#151; very tight, very powerful, precise. (The curb was my fault.)\n\nAlso, there’s this: The A8 bespeaks “old money,” though the cash for its purchase or lease might’ve come from a failing dot-com company. Cadillac evokes images of Miami sans Elian, a demographically aging community of pensioners and one-hit fiscal wonders.\n\nThat is not a politically correct assessment, but in the conversation of the marketplace, it is gospel truth.\n\nDifferences in approaches to technology help to explain those differences in market perception.\n\nCadillac invests heavily in engines and in-vehicle communications systems, such as the OnStar concierge, emergency and navigation package. OnStar employs a combination of satellite and cellular technology to provide informational services.\n\nDollars spent on new Cadillac engines yielded another “star,” the much-heralded 275-horsepower, 32-valve Northstar V-8 and its related transmission and suspension components.\n\nAudi invests heavily in the same areas but goes substantially farther. Its new A8 engine is a 310-horsepower, 40-valve 4.2-liter aluminum-alloy V-8 linked to an electronically controlled five-speed Tiptronic (automatic-manual hybrid) transmission. The A8 Quattro, as its name implies, also comes with Quattro all-wheel drive, a feature that gives it an edge over the Cadillacs in super-messy weather. All that running gear is installed in a very rigid all-aluminum car body that weighs 4,156 pounds.\n\nThough the Cadillac DeVille DHS weighs less at 4,049 lbs, the combination of a more powerful engine and an aluminum body gives the A8 a lightness of being &#151; the feeling of being in flight &#151; that is missing from the DeVille DHS and DTS.\n\nAudi does not have OnStar. But it offers a standard satellite navigation system in the A8, and it out-plushes Cadillac in interior layout and appointments. Cadillac, for example, presents a very pleasant, usable dashboard and instrument panel. But the design is for Everyone. Audi, by comparison , gives you a completely driver-oriented instrument panel and center console.\n\nPassengers are treated nicely in the A8. They are surrounded by genuine wood trim (polished burled walnut or sycamore, buyer’s choice), suede door panels, Valcona leather seats, individual heating vents front and rear, power-operated everything (including standard sunroof), and a host of other amenities. But, despite those kindnesses, there is no mistaking the A8 for anything other than a driver’s car.\n\nIn the final analysis, that is why the A8 beats Cadillac’s top runners in buyer perception. Cadillac still sees luxury cars as family-mobiles, vehicles designed to accommodate and impress others. Audi correctly sees luxury cars as me-mobiles, vehicles that appeal first and foremost to the buyer-operator. Like it or not, in that big-bucks bracket, “me” sells better than “we.”\n\nNuts &amp; Bolts\n\n2000 Audi A8 L Quattro Concern: The all-aluminum Audi S pace Fram e (ASF) body is difficult to repair &#151; so difficult, in fact, there are only four shops nationwide (in Los Angeles, Chicago, Fort Lauderdale and Greenwich, Conn.) set up to fix major structural damage. Audi offers loaner cars and generous shipping subsidies to A8 owners whose smushed vehicles are admitted for surgery. “Minor,” or cosmetic, damage to the A8 body is handled by 24 Audi shops nationwide. Contact your dealer for more information. And, ahem, bring your wallet or insurer.\n\nPraise: Enough said.\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: Exceptional in all three categories.\n\nBrakes: Four-wheel ventilated discs with standard anti-locks. Excellent anti-skid control.\n\nCapacities: Five people sit comfortably in the A8 L (long wheelbase) but not as comfortably in the regular A8, which is five inches shorter. The fuel tank holds 23 gallons of gasoline (91-octane premium unleaded is recommended). Cargo capacity is 17.6 cubic feet.\n\nMileage: About 23 miles per gallon, combined city-highway.\n\nPrice: Base price on the Audi A8 L Quattro is $67,900. Dealer invoice is $59,997. Price as tested is $68,450. Price does not include local taxes and fees and federal taxes on luxury cars.\n\nPurse-strings note: Compare with any premium luxury car.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in September 2016 for the 2016 model, but little has changed for 2017. To see what’s new for 2017, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nApproaching its final days in its current form, Audi’s A8 flagship is still an impressive beast. The stretched, all-wheel-drive, full-size luxury sedan from Volkswagen’s premium brand is due for a redesign, yet it’s a formidable competitor for buyers seeking a spacious, smooth and cocooning experience in their daily commute. Not much has changed for 2016 (compare it to the 2015 model here) aside from some new wheel designs, equipment packaging and interior colors.\n\nAs of 2016, the only A8 available in the U.S. is the long-wheelbase A8 L. The short wheelbase carries on only in the sports-oriented S8 (detailed separately). The A8 features three possible powertrains: a 3.0-liter, turbocharged V-6; a 4.0-liter, turbocharged V-8; and a 6.3-liter, turbocharged W-12. The diesel model available for 2015 has been dropped due to emissions issues. \n\nThe Mercedes-Benz S-Class and BMW 7 Series are fresher, and the Cadillac CT6 is considerably cheaper, so is there a reason to buy an A8 before it’s redesigned in the next year or two?\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nIt almost seems like a waste of time to discuss the styling of an Audi sedan; nothing has appreciably changed since 1996. The look is clean, with a sweeping arc roofline that’s been a major design element since it first showed up on an A4 nearly 20 years ago. The horse-collar grille arrived about 10 years later. There’s no mistaking the A8 for anything but an Audi; as I’ve said before, if you like the look of one model, you’ll likely enjoy all of them. I personally find the A8’s styling attractive and modern, and subtle adjustments to the headlights and taillights over the years have kept it from looking stale.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThe A8 I tested had the midrange engine, a 4.0-liter, turbocharged V-8 making 450 horsepower and 444 pounds-feet of torque. Power runs through an eight-speed automatic transmission to all four wheels; Audi’s Quattro all-wheel-drive system is standard. The V-6 makes 333 hp and the much more expensive 6.3-liter W-12 makes 500 hp. If you like sport sedans, opt for the S8, which uses the same 4.0-liter V-8 but bumps power up to a whopping 605 hp. \n\nThe A8’s 4.0-liter engine is plenty, however, with a manufacturer-estimated zero-to-60 mph time of just 4.4 seconds. It’s an easily believable figure given just how powerful the car feels under even moderate acceleration. Driven around town, the V-8 is calm, quiet and serene. Plant your foot on it, though, and the entire car seems to gather itself and burst forward on a surge of power that feels like surfing a gnarly Hawaiian wave. The power band is broad, and the compact V-8 never runs out of steam thanks to excellent tuning and the silky smooth operation of the eight-speed automatic. The drivetrain’s versatility has to be one of the A8’s best features — athletic when you want it to be, quietly reserved and ready to be called upon at all other times.\n\nFrom a ride and suspension standpoint, the A8 feels big and floaty. Its long wheelbase makes for a serene driving experience, insulated from the road and outside world — except when it comes to tire noise. There’s very little wind noise, but there’s a considerable amount of tire slap over expansion joints, joined by a hollow booming. The Audi Drive Select function allows you to adjust the steering, air suspension, transmission behavior and throttle response to make for a sportier experience, but even at its sportiest, the A8 is still a big, floaty car. If you want something more aggressive, opt for the tauter S8.\n\nThe A8’s driving experience matches up well with the Mercedes-Benz S-Class, even though the Audi’s starting price is tens of thousands of dollars less. Both provide for a calm motoring experience, with rich cabins that coddle passengers, plus smooth, powerful engines. For a sportier experience than your flagship luxury car — but without opting for a smaller vehicle like the S8 — look to the BMW 7 Series or Cadillac CT6. Both provide the space and smoothness of the A8 but with more aggressive handling characteristics. The CT6, with its extremely lightweight body and variety of powertrains, feels especially agile compared with the A8. \n\nGas mileage for the A8 4.0T is respectable, at an EPA-estimated 18/29/22 mpg city/highway/combined. My week with it returned about 25 mpg overall, beating the combined average. The competition is generally worse: The Mercedes-Benz S550 4Matic is rated 16/26/19 mpg, while the BMW 750i xDrive is rated 16/25/19 mpg. The all-wheel-drive Cadillac CT6, with its smaller twin-turbo V-6, is rated only 18/26/21 mpg, a surprisingly disappointing result given it’s a whopping 588 pounds lighter than the A8.\n\nInterior\n\nThe A8 is comfortable, front and back; there isn’t a bad seat in the house. Up front, occupants are treated to multi-adjustable power seats that aren’t quite the throne-like chairs seen in the S-Class but still provide support and comfort unparalleled in lesser sedans. \n\nMaterials quality is top-notch, with Audi’s traditional attention to detail apparent in the operation and flow of everything from the door pulls to the window switches. There’s no touch-screen in here (aside from a small panel to input numbers and letters) and no blank panels that rely on haptic feedback bumps to register that your command has been received. This is what makes the A8 feel like it’s in another category from the touch-sensitive-control-cursed Cadillac CT6: The feedback you get from operating any control in the A8 makes you feel justified in spending this much on a luxury car. It just feels expensive — something Cadillac, and to some extent BMW, have not been able to duplicate.\n\nThe backseat is the premium spot, however, with the standard long-wheelbase A8 providing almost absurd levels of rear legroom. My test car also came equipped with a $2,500 Rear Seat Comfort Package, which powers the rear seats with recline, massage and ventilation features. A panoramic moonroof stretches between the front and rear seats, and the headliner is covered in Alcantara faux suede. The rear cabin surroundings are just as opulent as the front, with fine-grain ash wood, real metal and high-quality stitched Valcona leather seats providing comfort for miles of travel, regardless of which seat you’re in.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nThe A8 has a standard multifunction controller and display for features and media. Standard navigation uses Google Earth for realism, but the A8’s connectivity options fall short of competitors’. The A8 is limited to proprietary Apple smartphone connectors instead of having a standard USB port and my car even had Apple’s old 30-pin connector — you know, in case anyone who can afford a $100,000 luxury car is still using an iPhone now two generations out of date. Neither Apple CarPlay nor Android Auto are available, and there aren’t any USB charging ports for personal electronics anywhere in the interior. You’ll have to make do with a couple of 12-volt outlets and your own car-charger plugs. This might have been acceptable a couple of years ago, but it’s 2016; the latest $26,000 Chevrolet Malibu comes with four USB ports, four 12-volt sockets and even a 120-volt household three-prong outlet. It’s well past time for Audi to upgrade.\n\nCargo & Storage\n\nThe A8’s trunk is a bit small despite its stretch wheelbase: 14.2 cubic feet versus 18.2 in the 7 Series and 16.3 in the S-Class. The CT6 makes do with 15.3 cubic feet of cargo room. The A8’s rear seats don’t fold down because of the power reclining and massage functions, but a small pass-through is available as part of a Cold Weather Package (to accommodate skis, presumably).\n\nSafety\n\nNo crash-test ratings are available for the A8.\n\nDespite being in need of a redesign, the A8 features quite a few electronic safety systems but, in typical German luxury-car fashion, nearly all of them are options. Standard in the A8 4.0T are blind spot warning, a backup camera, parking assist sensors and an around-view camera. The $2,250 Driver Assistance Package adds active lane keeping assist, adaptive cruise control and forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking. \n\nA head-up display is also standard and it includes a flashing red light if you happen to be following the car in front of you more closely than the A8 is comfortable with. In moderate-speed traffic, it was such an annoyance that I switched off the display more often than not. See all the A8’s standard features here.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nThe 2016 Audi A8 L starts at $82,425 including destination fee. A 4.0T Sport starts at $91,425 and my test car had three option packages: Rear Seat Comfort (including power rear outboard seats with ventilation, massage and powered lumbar support), Driver Assistance (adaptive cruise control, active lane keeping and automatic high beams) and Cold Weather (multifunction heated steering wheel, heated rear seats and a rear-seat pass-through). Total as-tested came to $96,175. \n\nCompetitors at the top of the luxury flagship field are well-known: The stalwart BMW 750i xDrive and Mercedes-Benz S550 4Matic are the best-matched alternatives to the A8. The BMW features a twin-turbocharged V-8 engine, as well, but is rear-wheel-drive biased rather than having the front-wheel-drive platform the A8 sits on. The BMW is also more expensive, however, starting at $98,395 for an 750i xDrive, with options that can push it well over $130,000. The Mercedes-Benz S550 is similar, also featuring a twin-turbo V-8 and optional all-wheel drive. Its starting price of $99,575 can be pushed up over $145,000 with all of Mercedes’ fancy bells and whistles. \n\nA more cost-friendly option is the new Cadillac CT6, a 7 Series-sized sedan that weighs less than a 5 Series and forgoes the ubiquitous V-8 engine for a more modest (but still powerful) twin-turbo V-6. The CT6 starts at $65,390 and, even when you load it up with high-quality leather, a Panaray audio system and lots of automated safety features, it comes in just about where the other sedans start their base pricing.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The A8 L is a big, luxurious sedan — but at this price, it needs to be more than just comfortable, and the car lacks the “wow factor” its rivals have.\n\nVersus the competition: Other vehicles in this class offer more pizazz and better powertrains, but the A8 L remains a comfortable, sure-footed cruiser — and it offers some value, as well.\n\nThe redesigned 2019 Audi A8 L is the fourth generation of Audi’s largest and most luxurious sedan. It’s stuffed full of luxury features and technology, but as it comes to American shores it feels a bit incomplete. Our jealousy of the European auto market usually has to do with the abundance of fun hatchbacks and wagons they get that we never do. In the case of the A8 L, we get the car — but not all of the features.\n\nThanks to an array of 24 sonic, camera and radar sensors, the A8 L in Europe can be outfitted with Level 3 autonomous capability. But due to regulatory issues and a lack of uniformity among U.S. roads, the system won’t be coming here — and if you buy a 2019 A8 L here, Audi says it can’t be updated to use the system because the U.S.-spec car won’t come with all the necessary hardware. Darn.\n\nEven without this system, there are still plenty of changes for the new A8 L: Its engine options have been condensed and exterior styling has been tweaked, but most notable is a new control scheme in the center console that largely eliminates conventional mechanical controls. Compare the 2019 A8 L with last year’s model.\n\nCompetition for the A8 L is stiff, including the BMW 7 Series, Mercedes-Benz S-Class and Lexus LS 500. Compare all of these cars.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nLast year’s model offered both a V-6 and V-8 engine option, but there’s only a turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 that’s new for the 2019 sedan, making 335 horsepower and 369 pounds-feet of torque. It also features a mild-hybrid system that both supports the engine and doubles as the main electrical system for the vehicle, powering the infotainment, luxury and driver assistance features. An eight-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive are standard.\n\nThese specs set the Audi apart from its competitors, which offer versions of their flagship sedans with gigantic V-8s (or even V-12s) making gobs of power. The turbo V-6 is it for the A8 L (though an S8 L that’s rumored to show up in 2020 is bound to have more power).\n\nThe powertrain is up to the task of moving the A8 L’s significant 4,751 pounds of bulk around, but it does so with less impetus than I’d like. Like most luxury vehicles, the A8 L offers a few drive modes: Comfort, Auto, Dynamic and Individual. In Comfort and Auto, I noticed a problem in the A8 L that’s common among the Audis we’ve tested of late: lackadaisical accelerator response. I much preferred the feeling of the steering in Dynamic mode, which adds sufficient weight to the wheel and makes it easier to keep the car centered.\n\nThe different drive modes also change the suspension feel. In Comfort mode, the ride has an agreeable plushness, with impressive isolation and true luxury composure. There’s a noticeable amount of body roll in this mode, but not so much that it threw me or the car off balance. Dynamic mode tightens up the suspension noticeably; it was my preferred setting on winding roads, but other than that, it was pretty much Comfort all the time.\n\nI was thankful for the A8 L’s Individual mode, which allowed me to put the car in my preferred setup (suspension in Comfort, steering and powertrain in Dynamic). Ideally that’s what Auto mode would be able to figure out on its own, but it’s a maddening middle ground instead.\n\nThe A8 L offers a few other suspension upgrades, including all-wheel steering and a predictive active suspension. The predictive active suspension scans the road ahead and can adjust the suspension for upcoming bumps or imperfections in the road, as well as raise or lower the height of each wheel to make the ride even more comfortable.\n\nUp Front\n\nThe A8 L features Audi’s new center console design that forgoes many physical controls in favor of a pair of touchscreens. There are a few touch-sensitive buttons beneath the lower screen — covered in black plastic that makes them appear to be part of the screen — but the vast majority of the car’s functions are controlled within the two screens. Even the car’s vents have touch-sensitive controls to turn them on and off.\n\nThis echoes a change that’s made its way across the Jaguar Land Rover lineup, starting with the Range Rover Velar. There are some key differences between the two systems, however, that work in Audi’s favor. The first is that the lower screen doesn’t have a series of menus to swipe through; it’s mostly static. The shortcuts up top can be customized, but the climate controls are locked into place.\n\nThe second is that it’s easier to tell when you’ve activated something because the system comes with haptic feedback response. Button presses are met with a satisfying bump sensation you feel and a click you hear. The system works on both the lower and upper screens (though if you activate smartphone mirroring with Android Auto or Apple CarPlay, the click goes away).\n\nI would still prefer physical controls for things like climate control, drive mode and a tuning knob, but there is a case to be made for Audi’s direction in terms of future-proofing and getting consumers used to these larger, touch-based interfaces. But it also means there’s a bit of a learning curve to the system, even if it’s not as large an obstacle as I first thought it would be. The screen’s feedback when you do activate something is helpful, and the screens are placed well — easy to reach from either of the front seats without leaning forward too far. If I have to use a touchscreen, this is a setup I ended up liking. One thing to watch out for: The screens are fingerprint magnets, so keep a microfiber cloth handy — in sunlight it’s hard to see and just looks dirty.\n\nThe cabin does have some drawbacks. It’s lacking in front storage, and there are only two USB ports throughout the whole car (the backseat is especially egregious, with only a pair of 12-volt outlets). The wireless charging pad is in the center storage bin, which makes it super shallow — you can fit maybe your phone and a pack of gum in there. There’s also no storage compartment for sunglasses, the door pockets aren’t especially large, and the center of the dashboard is taken up by the screens, meaning there’s no good place to store any of the miscellaneous objects people like to keep in their vehicles.\n\nThe backseat area is massive, with what feels like an acre of space between the rear seats and the front ones. Audi offers the A8 L in both four- and five-seat configurations depending on the number of rear seats you need. My test vehicle came with the Rear Comfort Package and five seats, so it didn’t have the ultimate comfort of a padded, massaging footrest on the passenger side, but there was still plenty to like in back. The outboard seats are heated and ventilated, and will even give you a light massage. There’s a small tablet that pops out of the fold-down armrest that can control the seats and the car’s various entertainment functions.\n\nStill Plenty of Safety Features …\n\nI could spend more time lamenting what the A8 L doesn’t have, but what it does have works pretty well. Its list of safety technology is long and formidable, though little of it is standard — strange for a car that costs this much (the A8 L starts at $84,795 including destination charges). Forward automatic emergency braking, front and rear parking sensors, and a backup camera are pretty much all you get without paying extra. I know it’s unfair to harp only on Audi for this when competitors do it, too, so I’m going to harp on all the luxury cars in this price range: Add more standard safety features!\n\nMy car also came with Audi’s Driver Assistance Package ($2,750), which adds adaptive cruise control with traffic jam assist, lane keep assist and a feature Audi calls Turn Assist, which monitors oncoming traffic when you’re making unprotected left turns (turns without an arrow, where oncoming traffic has the right of way). The package also adds exit assist, which detects oncoming bike riders or vehicles as you attempt to open the door from inside and locks it to prevent a collision. The Executive Package ($4,150) added a lot of luxury features, including lane change assist, a rear pre-collision detection system, and a 360-degree camera system with many customizable views.\n\nThe systems work as advertised. Audi’s traffic jam assist is a low-speed system that allows the car to come to a complete stop in traffic and helps with steering (but you have to keep a hand on the wheel for the system to remain active). The lane centering is pretty good; the car doesn’t bounce noticeably from side to side in the lane, and the system seems to work well in a variety of lighting conditions. There’s one system, however, that I would leave off: Predictive Control, which ties the cruise control speed to the car’s traffic sign recognition system. It gets confused by various signs, such as the lower speed limits for off ramps or the signs for trucks or trailers, much like I found in a 2018 Audi A5 I tested in 2017.\n\n… But It Needs the Missing One\n\nI keep coming back to the A8 L’s missing autonomous functionality because I think the car really needs something like that to spice it up. As is, the A8 L is a big, comfortable cruiser with above-average ride quality and lots of luxurious materials and technology on the inside, but it’s missing a certain “wow” factor you get in competitors — whether it be the S-Class’ stellar materials, the 7 Series’ big engine options or the LS 500’s … well, maybe the Lexus has some work to do, as well.\n\nMy test vehicle checked in at $101,095 after adding its various options. This isn’t nearly the top of the pricing heights to which the A8 L can climb; you can option one up to over $120,000 with relative ease, especially if you opt for the $7,550 two-passenger Executive Rear Seat Comfort Package (the three-passenger Rear Seat Comfort Package in my test vehicle has fewer additions and cost only an extra $3,500). But at my test car’s lower price, I found myself wanting more.\n\nThough the A8 L is a good vehicle by any objective measure, much of it feels too ordinary to give it lasting appeal over competitors. At this price, and against this set of rivals, good isn’t good enough.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "In the world of high-end luxury cars, Audi A8 stands alone, set apart from such stylish competition as Jaguar, Mercedes-Benz, Lexus or Cadillac.\n\nWhat makes A8 unique is what A8 is made of: aluminum. From its body panels and five-valve V-8 engine to its underlying space frame, A8’s aluminum construction gives the flagship Audi an undeniably exotic spin.\n\nAluminum also lightens the weight of this big craft, compared with steel, and enhances the sedan’s supple ride and nimble handling. The A8, new for ’97 after 10 years of development by Audi engineers teamed up with aluminum-expert Alcoa, sets the standard for alloy sedan construction.\n\nFor those who picture aluminum as exclusive to soda cans and foil for the barbecue, understand that A8 is a very substantial automobile. Weighing in at around 2 tons despite the lightweight material, A8 has the solid, vaultlike feel of the top competition, along with Audi’s signature cornering prowess.\n\nThe downside of aluminum construction is that it’s notoriously difficult and expensive to fix after a collision.\n\nThe test car was the A8 L long-wheelbase version, nearly 5 inches longer than the standard A8 (which is already plenty big), with the additional inches mainly benefiting rear-seat passengers. And that rear seat is huge, spacious enough for a German chancellor and a couple other heads of state, with their hats on.\n\nDespite its formidable size, A8 is quick and maneuverable, with the lightness of the aluminum structure shining through. The space frame is touted by Audi for its stiffness, and the sedan does feel solid and stable.\n\nThat mighty V8, with its variable valve timing and intake runners, pulls like a turbine, smooth and strong from idle all the way up to its nearly 7,000 rpm redline. In cubic inches (remember them?), it’s just a 255, tiny in V-8 terms. Yet it puts out a clean 310 horsepower with a minimum of fuss.\n\nThe steering is quick though quite light to the touch, for a German car.\n\nPart of A8’s superior handling comes from its standard Quattro all-wheel-drive system, which Audi pioneered more than two decades ago.\n\nThe suspension of the A8 is fairly soft, a real boulevard cruiser. The car feels mushy over some surfaces but surprisingly harsh over others.\n\nNew for 2001 is a hot-rod version of the short-wheelbase sedan called the S8, with 50 more horsepower plus steering and suspension more attuned to serious driving.\n\nThe A8’s handling and crash avoidance is enhanced by several electronic marvels, including an advanced form of traction control, anti-lock brakes, automatic locking differential for low-traction start-ups and electronic stability control, which helps keep the car out of skids through an array of sensors and computing functions.\n\nOn the road, the A8 is eerily quiet, with just a distant howl from the engine under acceleration. Part of that quiet may be attributable to the sound-deadening qualities of aluminum.\n\nIn any case, the leather- and wood-lined cabin feels secure and removed from the traffic outside. All the better to listen to the excellent Bose stereo or fool around with the navigation system. Naturally, every power, safety and convenience accessory known to man is present, including a radar system that warns the driver of impending parking-maneuver collisions to the rear and sides.\n\nAll this and the price is just, well, it’s expensive. Real expensive as in hovering around the $70,000 mark.\n\nThe total included $1,200 for “pearlescent white clearcoat,” $1,500 for 18-inch wheels and performance tires, $500 for high-intensity headlights, $700 for the radar warning system and $200 for a ski sack.\n\nAs top-drawer cars go, the A8 L is a beauty, offering a different take on Germanic luxury than Mercedes-Benz S-Class or BMW 7-Series. Anyone shopping in this rarefied atmosphere should check ou the difference in style, performance and aluminum.",

Pavement hugger. Sits flat without lean or sway.\n\nSteering response is excellent– goes where you point it now.\n\nSolid, roomy, comfy, though like any vehicle carrying the Audi nameplate, the suspension is a bit firm and a tad stiff for those who favor the cushy ride and handling of a luxury sedan.\n\nBase price is $65,000. Standard equipment includes speed-sensitive power steering, four-wheel fully independent suspension, depowered front as well as side-impact air bags front and rear, antitheft alarm with interior motion sensors, headlight washers, front and rear fog lamps, dual power mirrors with defogging, leather upholstery, Bose sound system, dual-zone climate control, 14-way power seats (after about 10 ways we lose interest), power sunroof with a dial to set exact amount of opening/closing, power windows, CD player with trunk changer, cruise control and wiring for a phone.\n\nThe test car added 17-inch polished wheels for $1,000, a cold-weather package with heated seats and steering wheel plus inside expandable ski/storage sack for $1,000, warm-weather package with power rear and manual side shades and solar sunroof for $1,200, and an electronics package with automatic dimming outside mirrors, rear power seat head rests and xenon headlamps for $1,400.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The A8 L is a big, luxurious sedan — but at this price, it needs to be more than just comfortable, and the car lacks the “wow factor” its rivals have.\n\nVersus the competition: Other vehicles in this class offer more pizazz and better powertrains, but the A8 L remains a comfortable, sure-footed cruiser — and it offers some value, as well.\n\nThe redesigned 2019 Audi A8 L is the fourth generation of Audi’s largest and most luxurious sedan. It’s stuffed full of luxury features and technology, but as it comes to American shores it feels a bit incomplete. Our jealousy of the European auto market usually has to do with the abundance of fun hatchbacks and wagons they get that we never do. In the case of the A8 L, we get the car — but not all of the features.\n\nThanks to an array of 24 sonic, camera and radar sensors, the A8 L in Europe can be outfitted with Level 3 autonomous capability. But due to regulatory issues and a lack of uniformity among U.S. roads, the system won’t be coming here — and if you buy a 2019 A8 L here, Audi says it can’t be updated to use the system because the U.S.-spec car won’t come with all the necessary hardware. Darn.\n\nEven without this system, there are still plenty of changes for the new A8 L: Its engine options have been condensed and exterior styling has been tweaked, but most notable is a new control scheme in the center console that largely eliminates conventional mechanical controls. Compare the 2019 A8 L with last year’s model.\n\nCompetition for the A8 L is stiff, including the BMW 7 Series, Mercedes-Benz S-Class and Lexus LS 500. Compare all of these cars.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nLast year’s model offered both a V-6 and V-8 engine option, but there’s only a turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 that’s new for the 2019 sedan, making 335 horsepower and 369 pounds-feet of torque. It also features a mild-hybrid system that both supports the engine and doubles as the main electrical system for the vehicle, powering the infotainment, luxury and driver assistance features. An eight-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive are standard.\n\nThese specs set the Audi apart from its competitors, which offer versions of their flagship sedans with gigantic V-8s (or even V-12s) making gobs of power. The turbo V-6 is it for the A8 L (though an S8 L that’s rumored to show up in 2020 is bound to have more power).\n\nThe powertrain is up to the task of moving the A8 L’s significant 4,751 pounds of bulk around, but it does so with less impetus than I’d like. Like most luxury vehicles, the A8 L offers a few drive modes: Comfort, Auto, Dynamic and Individual. In Comfort and Auto, I noticed a problem in the A8 L that’s common among the Audis we’ve tested of late: lackadaisical accelerator response. I much preferred the feeling of the steering in Dynamic mode, which adds sufficient weight to the wheel and makes it easier to keep the car centered.\n\nThe different drive modes also change the suspension feel. In Comfort mode, the ride has an agreeable plushness, with impressive isolation and true luxury composure. There’s a noticeable amount of body roll in this mode, but not so much that it threw me or the car off balance. Dynamic mode tightens up the suspension noticeably; it was my preferred setting on winding roads, but other than that, it was pretty much Comfort all the time.\n\nI was thankful for the A8 L’s Individual mode, which allowed me to put the car in my preferred setup (suspension in Comfort, steering and powertrain in Dynamic). Ideally that’s what Auto mode would be able to figure out on its own, but it’s a maddening middle ground instead.\n\nThe A8 L offers a few other suspension upgrades, including all-wheel steering and a predictive active suspension. The predictive active suspension scans the road ahead and can adjust the suspension for upcoming bumps or imperfections in the road, as well as raise or lower the height of each wheel to make the ride even more comfortable.\n\nUp Front\n\nThe A8 L features Audi’s new center console design that forgoes many physical controls in favor of a pair of touchscreens. There are a few touch-sensitive buttons beneath the lower screen — covered in black plastic that makes them appear to be part of the screen — but the vast majority of the car’s functions are controlled within the two screens. Even the car’s vents have touch-sensitive controls to turn them on and off.\n\nThis echoes a change that’s made its way across the Jaguar Land Rover lineup, starting with the Range Rover Velar. There are some key differences between the two systems, however, that work in Audi’s favor. The first is that the lower screen doesn’t have a series of menus to swipe through; it’s mostly static. The shortcuts up top can be customized, but the climate controls are locked into place.\n\nThe second is that it’s easier to tell when you’ve activated something because the system comes with haptic feedback response. Button presses are met with a satisfying bump sensation you feel and a click you hear. The system works on both the lower and upper screens (though if you activate smartphone mirroring with Android Auto or Apple CarPlay, the click goes away).\n\nI would still prefer physical controls for things like climate control, drive mode and a tuning knob, but there is a case to be made for Audi’s direction in terms of future-proofing and getting consumers used to these larger, touch-based interfaces. But it also means there’s a bit of a learning curve to the system, even if it’s not as large an obstacle as I first thought it would be. The screen’s feedback when you do activate something is helpful, and the screens are placed well — easy to reach from either of the front seats without leaning forward too far. If I have to use a touchscreen, this is a setup I ended up liking. One thing to watch out for: The screens are fingerprint magnets, so keep a microfiber cloth handy — in sunlight it’s hard to see and just looks dirty.\n\nThe cabin does have some drawbacks. It’s lacking in front storage, and there are only two USB ports throughout the whole car (the backseat is especially egregious, with only a pair of 12-volt outlets). The wireless charging pad is in the center storage bin, which makes it super shallow — you can fit maybe your phone and a pack of gum in there. There’s also no storage compartment for sunglasses, the door pockets aren’t especially large, and the center of the dashboard is taken up by the screens, meaning there’s no good place to store any of the miscellaneous objects people like to keep in their vehicles.\n\nThe backseat area is massive, with what feels like an acre of space between the rear seats and the front ones. Audi offers the A8 L in both four- and five-seat configurations depending on the number of rear seats you need. My test vehicle came with the Rear Comfort Package and five seats, so it didn’t have the ultimate comfort of a padded, massaging footrest on the passenger side, but there was still plenty to like in back. The outboard seats are heated and ventilated, and will even give you a light massage. There’s a small tablet that pops out of the fold-down armrest that can control the seats and the car’s various entertainment functions.\n\nStill Plenty of Safety Features …\n\nI could spend more time lamenting what the A8 L doesn’t have, but what it does have works pretty well. Its list of safety technology is long and formidable, though little of it is standard — strange for a car that costs this much (the A8 L starts at $84,795 including destination charges). Forward automatic emergency braking, front and rear parking sensors, and a backup camera are pretty much all you get without paying extra. I know it’s unfair to harp only on Audi for this when competitors do it, too, so I’m going to harp on all the luxury cars in this price range: Add more standard safety features!\n\nMy car also came with Audi’s Driver Assistance Package ($2,750), which adds adaptive cruise control with traffic jam assist, lane keep assist and a feature Audi calls Turn Assist, which monitors oncoming traffic when you’re making unprotected left turns (turns without an arrow, where oncoming traffic has the right of way). The package also adds exit assist, which detects oncoming bike riders or vehicles as you attempt to open the door from inside and locks it to prevent a collision. The Executive Package ($4,150) added a lot of luxury features, including lane change assist, a rear pre-collision detection system, and a 360-degree camera system with many customizable views.\n\nThe systems work as advertised. Audi’s traffic jam assist is a low-speed system that allows the car to come to a complete stop in traffic and helps with steering (but you have to keep a hand on the wheel for the system to remain active). The lane centering is pretty good; the car doesn’t bounce noticeably from side to side in the lane, and the system seems to work well in a variety of lighting conditions. There’s one system, however, that I would leave off: Predictive Control, which ties the cruise control speed to the car’s traffic sign recognition system. It gets confused by various signs, such as the lower speed limits for off ramps or the signs for trucks or trailers, much like I found in a 2018 Audi A5 I tested in 2017.\n\n… But It Needs the Missing One\n\nI keep coming back to the A8 L’s missing autonomous functionality because I think the car really needs something like that to spice it up. As is, the A8 L is a big, comfortable cruiser with above-average ride quality and lots of luxurious materials and technology on the inside, but it’s missing a certain “wow” factor you get in competitors — whether it be the S-Class’ stellar materials, the 7 Series’ big engine options or the LS 500’s … well, maybe the Lexus has some work to do, as well.\n\nMy test vehicle checked in at $101,095 after adding its various options. This isn’t nearly the top of the pricing heights to which the A8 L can climb; you can option one up to over $120,000 with relative ease, especially if you opt for the $7,550 two-passenger Executive Rear Seat Comfort Package (the three-passenger Rear Seat Comfort Package in my test vehicle has fewer additions and cost only an extra $3,500). But at my test car’s lower price, I found myself wanting more.\n\nThough the A8 L is a good vehicle by any objective measure, much of it feels too ordinary to give it lasting appeal over competitors. At this price, and against this set of rivals, good isn’t good enough.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Audi sharpened its flagship for 2008, not that there was anything wrong with last year’s broad-shouldered A8. The luxury division of Volkswagen calls it “honing the character” for improved drivability, comfort and refinement.\n\nThe concept is a full-size luxury sedan that drives with sports-car finesse while still coddling the humans inside. Though the changes seem subtle compared with the pre-honed A8, already a favorite among well-financed driving enthusiasts, it gradually dawns on you just how responsively this car maneuvers.\n\nYou also notice the lush ambience of the businesslike interior, the supremely comfortable seats and, more than anything, the awesome capability of the 1,000-watt, 14-speaker Bang & Olufsen sound system. That’s the premium audio brand of the upper crust, and it turns //the// A8 into a rolling concert hall.\n\nYou know something’s up when you turn on the ignition and tiny tweeters rise on either side of the dashboard. Whether the music is funky guitar or symphony orchestra, the B&O delivers every nuance, each smidgen of sound in lifelike tones.\n\nThere’s something about the crystal clarity of a Wynton Marsalis trumpet solo on this potent audio system. On the other hand, you hear too many strained or slightly off-key singing voices, which that you might have overlooked on a lesser system.\n\nThe excellent audio provides fitting accompaniment to the A8L, the long-wheelbase version of the all-aluminum, all-wheel-drive sedan. Despite the extra length, which mostly goes to back-seat legroom, A8L impressed with its handling and overall performance.\n\nThe back seat is as roomy as a “Home, James” limousine for CEOs and other captains of industry. Or sports figures and rock stars.\n\nOf course, you’d need some kind of wealth to afford //the// A8L’s thirst for premium gas.\n\nAudi A8L\n\nVehicle type: Five-passenger, four-door sedan, all-wheel drive.\n\nEngine: 4.2-liter V-8, 350 horsepower at 6,800 rpm, 325 pounds-feet of torque at 3,500 rpm.\n\nTransmission: Six-speed automatic.\n\nWheelbase: 121 inches.\n\nOverall length: 204.4 inches.\n\nCurb weight: 4,409 pounds.\n\nEPA rating: 16 city, 23 highway.\n\nHIGHS: Taut drivability, evocative styling, superb audio system.\n\nLOWS: Pricey with options, modest fuel mileage, soft off-the-line acceleration.\n\nPERFORMANCE: A remarkably smooth and quiet motivator for this heavyweight, with plenty of muscle for passing and merging. Hot rodders might notice the leisurely takeoff from a stoplight, though it quickly picks up the pace. For more power, there’s a mighty, pricey and gas-guzzling W-12 engine that churns 450 horsepower. The automatic is right on the button, with a good-functioning paddle shifter.\n\nDRIVABILITY: Here’s where the “honing for character” comes in, with firmer and more responsive steering and an air-suspension system that seems to sense road irregularities ahead of time. Those changes, plus a load of electronic enhancements, all-wheel drive and Audi’s usual engineering precision, add up to a large sedan that drives like a sporty compact.\n\nSTYLING: The purposeful and distinctive look carries over from its 2004 makeover, with massive grille and heroic proportions.\n\nINTERIOR: In spite of the daunting array of technology stuck in here, A8’s dashboard and switchgear are intuitive and easy to use. Other automakers (hint: BMW) could learn from Audi’s console-mounted dial system that nicely handles a complex number of functions, ranging from audio to suspension adjustments.\n\nThe traditional wood-and-leather treatment is good-looking and well-crafted. But a $6,400 leather upgrade? Yikes.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: I suppose that anyone purchasing a car costing nearly $100,000, including expensive options, won’t be too worried about gas prices.\n\nBase price: $74,690.\n\nPrice as tested: $98,665.\n\nOPTIONS\n\nLeather upgrade, $6,400.\n\nBang & Olufsen audio system, $6,300.\n\nSport package, with 20-inch alloy wheels, performance tires, multi-function steering wheel, adaptive air suspension, $4,000.\n\nAdaptive cruise control, $2,100.\n\nFront-seat ventilation and massage, $1,500.\n\nPaint upgrade, $750.\n\nPower door-close assist, $600.\n\nDual-pane Security glass, $600.\n\nFour-zone climate control, $600.\n\nRear-seat lumbar adjustment, $350.\n\nShipping, $775.",

      "expert_review": "Millionaires are a growth market. The ranks of the seven-figured in the U.S. and Canada rose 10% last year, according to Merrill Lynch & Co. One of every 121 North Americans, about 2.7 million, now qualify as “high net worth individuals.” The rolls of the highest rollers, with personal wealth greater than $30 million, increased 9% worldwide.\n\nSo, remember, as you plan your family’s financial future: Now is an excellent time to be wealthy.\n\nOf course, $1 million isn’t what it used to be. It used to mean idle days by the sea aboard mahogany launches in the company of girls named Bunny. Today, many millionaires have to schlep to the office like the rest of us. Call them, with as much sympathy as you can muster, the working rich.\n\nCatering to these workaday plutocrats, German carmakers offer a select class of luxury starships whose emotional center of gravity resides in the back seat: The BMW 760Li, the Mercedes-Benz S600, the Volkswagen Phaeton W12 (the bastard prince of Ingolstadt) and our test car for the week, with a compounded name worthy of the Hapsburgs, the Audi A8 L W12 (more on this nomenclature later).\n\nThese are all 12-cylinder cars with six-figure prices and 10-foot wheelbases. Each has a cavernous aft cabin where leg room is measured in nautical miles and the quiet is so rich that groundlings falling under the tires register only a distant, muffled squish. Each boasts 400-plus horsepower (the Audi W12 puts out 450 hp), a sordid indifference to fuel economy (15 city/21 highway for the Audi) and more computers than the Marshall Space Flight Center.\n\nFor all practical purposes these are cars and a half.\n\nBuilt in the hundreds rather than thousands, these vehicles are just as likely to be driven by a chauffeur as an owner, and in an odd way they might be the only autos on the market that actually pay for themselves. If you are a $5,000-per-hour lawyer (calling them weasels is very hurtful and causes their pelts to thin) and your daily commute takes an hour, the $126,320 Audi could pay for itself and the chauffeur in less than two months, as you work in back and leave the driving to … um, what was his name? Doesn’t matter.\n\nAs a group, these cars have a slightly overindulged, moneyed quality to them, as if the seats were stuffed with bearer bonds. Unlike the imperious Rolls-Royce Phantom, they don’t feel as lordly as they do ministerial. These seem like good cars in which to slip past protesters at the G8 summit.\n\nLast year, I had a chance to drive, back to back, V8-powered versions of the Audi, Mercedes, BMW and VW on a test track, and I concluded that the Audi was superior on handling. I can’t imagine my opinion changing on account of the V12s. The Mercedes S600 has a 5.5-liter twin-turbo monster under the hood, putting 493 hp and 590 pound-feet of torque through a five-speed automatic and rear wheel drive — abandon hope, all tires that enter here.\n\nThe Audi 6.0-liter W12 motor produces a not inconsiderable 450 hp and 428 pound-feet of twist through a six-speed automatic, with Tiptronic switches on the steering wheel. If your executive racket club happens to have a drag strip, you’ll find the Audi bolts from nothing to 60 mph in 5 seconds and turns a stately 14-second quarter-mile.\n\nGiven its advantage in power to weight, the uber-Benz, I reckon, is quite a bit faster than the Audi in straight line. But the Audi’s all-wheel drive powertrain, with a Torsen limited-slip differential in the center and four mega-meat 19-inch tires churning away at the corners, is so relentlessly adhesive, so effortlessly fast and easy to drive that it seems to weigh half a ton less than the Mercedes.\n\nLikewise, the Audi surrenders nothing to the big BMW in terms of drivability. Both defy their mass with a keen bite at the asphalt when they turn into a corner. Both seem unfazed when sliding — the BMW likes a quick breath on the throttle and a little counter steer to rotate the rear end, while the Audi prefers to grind away on a steady throttle. The Audi demands less and delivers more.\n\nWhile I feel obliged to throw these big cars into long drifting arcs around freeway ramps and otherwise ring their thick necks in the interests of a full evaluation, that’s not what they are about. These are stratocruisers, designed for effortless, oneiric nap-of-the-Earth flying. That’s why they have 12 cylinders, instead of the more-than-adequate eight. A 12-cylinder engine offers, just at the margins, more waft and more serenity at high speeds — and besides, the chauffeur gets the ticket.\n\nThe Audi shares its engine design with the VW Phaeton, a W12 that is arranged like two V6s with the center cylinders interlaced, a layout that makes the engine very compact and, I’ll wager, a nightmare to work on. The Audi motor has a variety of performance mods, including dry sump oiling (to keep the engine lubricated in high-G maneuvering), that add up to an additional 30 horsepower over the 420 hp VW motor.\n\nThe Audi and the VW partake of VW Group’s ride-height-adjustable air suspension with continuous damping. The standard ride and roll stiffness is softer than prewar intelligence. The car pours oil on the troubled waters of L.A.’s freeways. Set the dial to “dynamic” and the ride firms up. The texture of the road becomes more vivid in the steering wheel, the shocks from the road become more tympanic, the body motions lose amplitude and the car lowers into its stance.\n\nThe Audi A8 L is an aluminum-bodied car — itself something of a minor technical miracle — and yet it’s quite stiff. But who cares? You’re not driving — whatshisname is.\n\nThe car I drove/rode in was a four-seat model. A gorgeous burled-wood console pours between the front seats, separating the rear seating area into two bucket seats, each with slide-recline controls, seat heaters, climate controls, individual LCD screens in the front headrests and motorized sunscreens on the rear windows and back glass. A three-position rear seat is a no-cost option on the Audi.\n\nAnd don’t worry about whatshisname. With front seats that are heated and ventilated and have a massage function with more adjustments than a veteran chiropractor, he’s doing all right.\n\nThe A8 introduced Audi’s new corporate face — the tall, chrome hoop around the radiator. I think it looks great, and the polished metal accents around the car are perfect ligaments of light that help define a body shape that is otherwise a kind of lava-lamp formation.\n\nA word about nomenclature: Introduced in 2003, the car was called the A8 L, suggesting a long-wheelbase variant of a standard car. Actually, it came only in a long wheelbase. However, this year, Audi is offering a “normal wheelbase” version of the A8, sans L, that shaves about 6 inches off the wheelbase and overall length. No plans, as yet, to name the other car the “abnormal wheelbase” A8.\n\nA list of equipment on this car would run the classified ads out of the newspaper. A few of the cooler ones include an optional solar sunroof that uses photovoltaic cells to run cabin fans for a temperate interior ($650), and 12-speaker Bose surround sound with optional XM Satellite radio ($550). The DVD entertainment system with six-disc changer is standard.\n\nIf the Rolls-Royce Phantom is the czar’s summer palace, these cars are the presidential suite at an Ian Schrager hotel. Conspicuously high tech and New World, they are less grand in the Rolls-Royce cast than just great, terrific automobiles sold to a lucky few hundred. If I absolutely have to ride in back, I like the Audi best.\n\nOf course, I’d really rather have the Rolls-Royce, for a mere $200,000 more. I’ll send whatshisname around to pick it up.\n\n*\n\n2005 Audi A8 L W12\n\nBase price: $117,400\n\nPrice, as tested: $126,320 (including $1,700 gas guzzler tax and $720 destination)\n\nPowertrain: 6.0-liter naturally aspirated W12 engine, four valves per cylinder, variable-valve timing; six-speed automatic adaptive-shift programming with Tiptronic manual shifting\n\nHorsepower: 450 at 6,200 rpm\n\nTorque: 428 pound-feet at 4,000 to 4,700 rpm\n\nCurb weight: 4,729 pounds\n\n0-60 mph: 5 seconds\n\nWheelbase: 121.0 inches\n\nOverall length: 204.4 inches\n\nEPA fuel economy: 15 miles per gallon city, 21 mpg highway\n\nFinal thoughts: Welcome, nobles\n\nContact automotive critic Dan Neil at dan.neil@latimes.com.",

      "expert_review": "Test driving the 2009 A8 W12 is like auditioning at chauffeur school. “Yes, sir. No, sir. Right away, sir.”\n\nYou acquire manners without even realizing it.\n\nDrivers may sit behind the steering wheel, but the owner sits in the back. Why else would Audi provide more headroom, legroom and interior volume in the second row?\n\nPeople who buy this car, which starts at $120,000, don’t worry about all of the high-tech features available to the driver — they often do not even know the driver’s name.\n\nThis car pushes luxury to a whole new level of comfort, and, on weekends, maybe when the staff is given a reprieve, the owner will grab the keys to the A8 and take it out for a country ride.\n\nDo it once, and he or she is destined to fire the chauffeur — this car was made for driving.\n\nDespite its size (it stretches more than 200 inches) and its weight (topping 4,700 pounds), the Audi A8 W12 provides blistering kinds of numbers. Its 0-60 acceleration time comes in at 5 seconds.\n\nFive flippin’ seconds! It has a top speed of 130 mph, which Audi limits electronically — if it didn’t, the car feels like it could break the sound barrier. It’s a massive machine that can do anything much smaller sports cars can handle but better. Blast off smoothly\n\nThe 6-liter, 12-cylinder engine hums at any speed pushing 450 horses and 428-pound-feet of torque to the car’s all-wheel drive system, simply known as Quattro by the German automaker. The six-speed automatic transmission makes every shift barely noticeable.\n\nThe acceleration is actually more exciting than that. Time slows when you’re blasting off in this car.\n\nThe power courses through you as the car surges forward, responding to your commands instantly. This car doesn’t feel nearly as fast as it is. Its responsiveness is incredible. The steering is exact, and the air suspension and rigid body eliminate any movements. It just goes faster and faster in an avalanche of excitement. But driving this hard seems wrong.\n\nBig, burly sedans should not have these abilities. It may wear Superman’s tights under its Armani suit, but it still looks too big to be this nimble.\n\nForget that it’s built with Audi’s Space Frame construction with aluminum alloy body parts and comes with an aluminum 12-cylinder dual overhead cam engine. And forget that it features more technology and wood trim in the cabin than most executive jets. Really, its ride is smoother than most jets.\n\nTwo people could sit in the back playing chess and never realize they’re flying down the highway at 110 mph.\n\nJust don’t try speeding anywhere near Detroit Metro Airport, where Romulus police will gladly pull you over for the most minor of infractions. In fact, when I drove the A8 W12 down Eureka Road on my way to Middlebelt, I thought for sure the police there were going to stop me just so they could look at this car.\n\nIt’s that beautiful. The LED daytime running lights along the edge of the headlamps look like electric eyeliner. That big mouth of a grille chews up everything in front of it, and the touches of chrome trim glisten in the moonlight. If this car doesn’t say “money” and “power,” nothing does. The owner’s manual should come in a leather briefcase. Nearly perfect\n\nInside, the wood trim looks perfect. The navigation screen hides itself behind a simple panel on the dash. It’s there if you need it, not there if you don’t. The aluminum trim sparkles, and when you’re in the driver’s seat, everything you want is a finger movement away. Touch and go. Go really fast.\n\nIt has everything — blind spot detection, radar-controlled cruise control, and even a system that vibrates the steering wheel slightly if you start to move out of your lane. It probably doesn’t make a sound because it doesn’t want to disturb the owner.\n\nIt tracks the road’s lines and gently pushes you back into your lane if you go astray.\n\nThere is no better flagship on the road today. It exemplifies luxury and performance in a nearly perfect combination.\n\nDuring my 100-mile test drive, I had to check the odometer to find out when the 100 miles were up. I could have driven all day in the A8 W12.\n\nBetter yet, I could have let someone else drive me around all day.\n\nWhile the A8 W12 has all of the trappings of a sports car, it was made for executives who want the very best for their staff.\n\nSburgess@detnews.com (313) 223-3217",

      "expert_review": "The 2007 Audi A8 L W12 Quattro AT6 — we’ll explain all those numbers and letters in a moment — is 204.4 inches long, more than 2 inches longer than a Chevrolet Tahoe. With the interior outfitted like our test car’s, the Audi seats four.\n\nAs you might expect, those four people will be very happy. Well, three, anyway: Probably one of them has to pay for the car, which, in this case, lists for $135,170. This includes a $1,700 federal “gas guzzler” tax, due to the EPA rating of 14 miles per gallon in the city, 21 mpg on the highway. Premium gas, thanks.\n\nThe A8 has long been Audi’s flagship sedan, and the A8 L W12, which joined the lineup for 2005, is the flagship’s flagship. The “L” means it’s longer than the regular A8 by about 5 inches. And the W12 means it’s powered by a 6.0-liter, 450-horsepower 12-cylinder engine that is in sort of a “W” configuration, rather than a conventional “V.” Quattro is Audi’s version of all-wheel-drive, and no carmaker, except perhaps Jeep, knows more about that than Audi does. And the AT6 means automatic transmission, six speeds.\n\nThis is a strong, solid car, happiest when allowed to stretch its legs on the highway. Top speed is governed at 130 mph, which, on the German Autobahn, it would likely see regularly. Here, at 70 mph, it feels as though it’s idling.\n\nIndeed, you would be hard-pressed to find a more sure-footed, comfortable vehicle in which to cover a great many miles in a short period of time. Expected luxury appointments are there — Valcona leather, a DVD rear-seat entertainment system, 16-way power front seats with power massage and ventilation, power rear side sunshades, a retractable color screen for the navigation system and rear-view camera, and dual-pane security glass, which still couldn’t keep out some surprisingly loud tire noise on concrete pavement.\n\nDespite the standard 12-speaker Bose Surround Sound stereo with a six-disc CD changer, the test car had an upgraded Bang & Olufsen sound system that cost $6,300, and featured, among many other things, a pair of little round tweeters that silently rose from the corners of the dashboard when the stereo was on. Overkill? Maybe, but there was also a $3,900 “leather appointment upgrade” to the already gorgeous leather upholstery.\n\nAside from the all-wheel-drive, the A8 L was absolutely loaded with safety and stability equipment, ranging from 10 air bags inside to a “high-pressure headlight washer system” outside. The air suspension continuously monitors load and speed, and adjusts the Audi’s height to match. Handling was much more crisp than any car this large should be able to manage; braking was excellent. There is really nothing much here to criticize, nor should there be at this price.\n\nThe regular, and exceptionally nice, Audi A8 costs $69,620, which is $65,550 less than this Audi A8 L W12. With the A8 models, discriminating and deep-pocketed customers have three big German sedans to consider, the other two being the Mercedes-Benz S-Class and BMW 7-Series, both of which also can be optioned up to stratospheric prices.\n\nThose customers can argue the merits of the three cars at the country-club bar. We’ll just enjoy our occasional little test-drive peeks into a very different world.\n\nSentinel Automotive Editor Steven Cole Smithcan be reached at scsmith@orlandosentinel.com or 407-420-5699.",

      "expert_review": "There is no time in my life that I’ve needed a car as much as I need the 2012 Audi A8 L. This sedan practically thinks for me and it massages me while I drive the safe, comfortable long-wheelbase A8 L. But there’s also no time in my life when I’ve been as ill-prepared to afford this super luxury car as right now with my three small kids and their Montessori tuition, child-care bills, a mortgage, etc. It’s a conundrum.\n\nThe 2012 Audi A8 L is long on cabin space; it’s gorgeous inside and out and is filled with so many luxurious and convenient features that it begs to be enjoyed. And enjoy it, I did.\n\nIf you have extra money in your budget for super luxury cars, I recommend looking at the 2012 Audi A8 L. This car is a wonder. Others claim that unlike its competitors the A8 doesn’t beg to be driven since it isn’t equipped with as much power. I beg to differ. It may not be solely focused on ambitious engine power like some of its rivals, but it’s got plenty of V-8 power to propel the sedan up any mountain, down any stretch of open road or simply around town.\n\nAn eight-speed automatic transmission is perfectly matched to the engine, and acceleration is so smooth that you barely notice it. Putting the car into Sport mode kicks things up to make the car’s normal glide feel like low flight.\n\nThe A8 was redesigned last year to rave reviews for its gorgeous styling and improved gas mileage. There aren’t many changes for 2012 to the standard A8, but there is a new A8 L W12 trim with a 6.3-liter 12-cylinder engine that delivers 500 horsepower.\n\nThe Audi A8 L that I tested has a starting MSRP of $84,700, but with a few options packages tacked on, the total price comes to $92,175.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe A8 L is a big car. At nearly 208 inches in length, it barely fit in my garage, and it’s just 8 inches longer than the Toyota Sienna minivan and roughly 5 inches longer than the regular A8. When it comes to the intersection of sedans and families, size matters. Length is good because it translates into plenty of cabin and cargo space, which are two things families can never have enough of.\n\nAs for aesthetics, the A8 L shines. Its elegant lines, 19-inch 10-spoke alloy wheels and stylish checkmark-shaped LED headlights and turn signals all demand attention.\n\nThere are many little things about the A8 L’s exterior that augment its beauty. The car unlocks automatically as you approach with the key in your pocket or hand. The doors seal themselves shut when certain small children don’t close them with enough “oomph,” which is helpful since the doors are quite heavy. The step-in height is low enough that even the smallest person can climb in and out independently. This car exudes a desire to help make your day a little easier, with its standard power sunroof, power trunk and Quattro all-wheel-drive system.\n\nThe trunk is ample enough at just over 13 cubic feet, and it includes a variety of netted pockets to keep everything from your laptop to your yoga mat secure.\n\nThe 2012 Audi A8 L has a 372-horsepower, 4.2-liter V-8 engine that gets an EPA-estimated 18/28 mpg city/highway. Premium or super premium fuel is required.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Excellent\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Groove-On\n\nINTERIOR\nThe A8’s cabin is so upscale that it felt like a mini-vacation every time I slid in for a drive. In fact, my husband and I were all dressed up with no place to go, so after dinner at a local restaurant, we secured some fine chocolate, got in the A8 and set out for a drive. We popped a favorite CD into the slyly hidden six-CD changer in the glove box, ignited the massage function on our seats and took off.\n\nI drove and drove as the car glided over a deserted stretch of rural highway, and my husband and I did something unprecedented for working parents of young children. We talked and talked, reinvigorated by our massages, the music and the A8’s comfort. Fear not, the kids were home with a sitter.\n\nIf that scenario doesn’t convince you that this car begs to be enjoyed, I’m not sure what will. It has standard features like a SIM card that makes the five-seater a Wi-Fi hotspot, Google Earth aerial views on the navigation screen and power sunshades on the rear window and rear door windows. The interior lighting glows in thin silver strips along the roofline and is so ambient at night that all three of my kids fell asleep every time they were in this car after 7 p.m. I can’t get that to happen in my regular ride.\n\nInterior head-, shoulder- and legroom is ample. Storage space also abounds with plenty of cupholders and cleverly hidden nets and cubbies throughout the cabin.\n\nThe massage function on the front seats comes as part of the Premium Package ($2,000) that also makes the front seats 22-way adjustable instead of the standard 18 ways. There are a number of other option packages available that can get you anything from increased rear seat comfort via heating and adjustability to ever-amplified luxury via finer leather with designer touches.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSAFETY\nMy only complaint about this car (besides the fact that I can’t afford it) is the difficulty I had using its two sets of lower Latch anchors. My fingers are still scratched up from my battle with them. The anchors are embedded between the back and bottom seat cushions, but the leather is too stiff around the anchors, making them almost impossible to access and use. I struggled mightily.\n\nThe good news is I was able to fit three car seats — two convertibles and a booster seat — across the backseat. Even the installation of a rear-facing infant seat couldn’t diminish anyone’s legroom in this car.\n\nThe 2012 A8 L hasn’t been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nThe A8 L has standard all-wheel drive, all-disc antilock brakes with brake assist, an electronic stability system with traction control, active front head restraints, a backup camera with front and rear parking sensors, and nine airbags, including a driver’s knee airbag and side-impact airbags for the outboard rear seats.\n\nMy test car also came with the Driver Assistance Package ($3,000) that includes adaptive cruise control, a lane departure warning system and a blind spot warning system.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2012 Audi A8 L here.",

      "expert_review": "The Verdict: The 2016 Audi A8 is still an elegant, refined, thoroughly comfortable luxury flagship — but its onboard technology is overdue for an update.\n\nVersus the competition: Competitors have outpaced the A8 for technological advancement, but the Audi’s composure, luxurious appointments and dreamy-smooth powertrain continue to make it a satisfying luxury competitor.\n\nApproaching its final days in its current form, Audi’s A8 flagship is still an impressive beast. The stretched, all-wheel-drive, full-size luxury sedan from Volkswagen’s premium brand is due for a redesign, yet it’s a formidable competitor for buyers seeking a spacious, smooth and cocooning experience in their daily commute. Not much has changed for 2016 (compare it to the 2015 model here) aside from some new wheel designs, equipment packaging and interior colors.\n\nAs of 2016, the only A8 available in the U.S. is the long-wheelbase A8 L. The short wheelbase carries on only in the sports-oriented S8. The Audi A8 features three possible powertrains: a 3.0-liter, turbocharged V-6; a 4.0-liter, turbocharged V-8; and a 6.3-liter, turbocharged W-12. The diesel TDI model available for 2015 has been dropped due to the TDI emissions issues.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz S-Class and BMW 7 Series body-types are fresher, and the Cadillac CT6 is considerably cheaper, so is there a reason to buy an A8 before it’s redesigned in the next year or two?\nExterior & Styling\nIt almost seems like a waste of time to discuss the styling of an Audi sedan; nothing has appreciably changed since 1996. The look is clean, with a sweeping arc roofline that’s been a major design element since it first showed up on an A4 nearly 20 years ago. The horse-collar grille arrived about 10 years later. There’s no mistaking the A8 for anything but an Audi; as I’ve said before, if you like the look of one model, you’ll likely enjoy all of them. I personally find the A8’s styling attractive and modern, and subtle adjustments to the headlights and taillights over the years have kept it from looking stale.\nHow It Drives\nThe Audi A8 I tested had the midrange engine, a 4.0-liter, turbocharged V-8 making 450 horsepower and 444 pounds-feet of torque. Power runs through an eight-speed automatic transmission to all four wheels; Audi’s Quattro all-wheel-drive system is standard. The V-6 makes 333 hp and the much more expensive 6.3-liter W-12 makes 500 hp. If you like sport sedans, opt for the S8, which uses the same 4.0-liter V-8 but bumps power up to a whopping 605 hp.\n\nThe A8’s 4.0-liter engine is plenty, however, with a manufacturer-estimated zero-to-60 mph time of just 4.4 seconds. It’s an easily believable figure given just how powerful the car feels under even moderate acceleration. Driven around town, the V-8 is calm, quiet and serene. Plant your foot on it, though, and the entire car seems to gather itself and burst forward on a surge of power that feels like surfing a gnarly Hawaiian wave. The power band is broad, and the compact V-8 never runs out of steam thanks to excellent tuning and the silky smooth operation of the eight-speed automatic. The drivetrain’s versatility has to be one of the A8’s best features — athletic when you want it to be, quietly reserved and ready to be called upon at all other times.\n\nFrom a ride and suspension standpoint, the Audi A8 feels big and floaty. Its long wheelbase makes for a serene driving experience, insulated from the road and outside world — except when it comes to tire noise. There’s very little wind noise, but there’s a considerable amount of tire slap over expansion joints, joined by a hollow booming. The Audi Drive Select function allows you to adjust the steering, air suspension, transmission behavior and throttle response to make for a sportier experience, but even at its sportiest, the A8 is still a big, floaty car. If you want something more aggressive, opt for the tauter S8.\n\nThe A8’s driving experience matches up well with the Mercedes-Benz S-Class, even though the Audi’s starting price is tens of thousands of dollars less. Both provide for a calm motoring experience, with rich cabins that coddle passengers, plus smooth, powerful engines. For a more performance-oriented experience than your flagship luxury car — but without opting for a smaller vehicle like the S8 — look to the BMW 7 Series or Cadillac CT6. Both provide the space and smoothness of the Audi A8 but with more aggressive handling characteristics. The CT6, with its extremely lightweight body and variety of powertrains, feels especially agile compared with the A8.\n\nGas mileage for the Audi A8 4.0T is respectable, at an EPA-estimated 18/29/22 mpg city/highway/combined. My week with it returned about 25 mpg overall, beating the combined average. The competition is generally worse: The Mercedes-Benz S550 4Matic is rated 16/26/19 mpg, while the BMW 750i xDrive is rated 16/25/19 mpg. The all-wheel-drive Cadillac CT6, with its smaller twin-turbo V-6, is rated only 18/26/21 mpg, a surprisingly disappointing result given it’s a whopping 588 pounds lighter than the A8.\n\nInterior\nThe A8 is comfortable, front and back; there isn’t a bad seat in the house. Up front, occupants are treated to multi-adjustable power seats that aren’t quite the throne-like chairs seen in the S-Class but still provide support and comfort unparalleled in lesser sedans.\n\nMaterials quality is top-notch, with Audi’s traditional attention to detail apparent in the operation and flow of everything from the door pulls to the window switches. There’s no touch-screen in here (aside from a small panel to input numbers and letters) and no blank panels that rely on haptic feedback bumps to register that your command has been received. This is what makes the A8 feel like it’s in another category from the touch-sensitive-control-cursed Cadillac CT6: The feedback you get from operating any control in the Audi A8 makes you feel justified in spending this much on a luxury car. It just feels expensive — something Cadillac, and to some extent BMW, have not been able to duplicate.\n\nThe backseat is the premium spot, however, with the standard long-wheelbase A8 providing almost absurd levels of rear legroom. My test car also came equipped with a $2,500 Rear Seat Comfort Package, which powers the rear leather seats with recline, massage and ventilation features. A panoramic sunroof stretches between the front and rear seats, and the headliner is covered in Alcantara faux suede. The rear cabin surroundings are just as opulent as the front, with fine-grain ash wood, real metal and high-quality stitched Valcona diamond-stitched leather seats providing comfort for miles of travel, regardless of which seat you’re in.\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe Audi A8 has a standard multifunction controller and display for features and media. Standard navigation uses Google Earth for realism, but the A8’s connectivity options fall short of competitors’. The A8 is limited to proprietary Apple smartphone connectors instead of having a standard USB port and my car even had Apple’s old 30-pin connector — you know, in case anyone who can afford a $100,000 luxury car is still using an iPhone now two generations out of date. Neither Apple CarPlay nor Android Auto are available, and there aren’t any USB charging ports for personal electronics anywhere in the interior. You’ll have to make do with a couple of 12-volt outlets and your own car-charger plugs. This might have been acceptable a couple of years ago, but it’s 2016; the latest $26,000 Chevrolet Malibu comes with four USB ports, four 12-volt sockets and even a 120-volt household three-prong outlet. It’s well past time for Audi to upgrade.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe Audi A8’s trunk is a bit small despite its stretch wheelbase: 14.2 cubic feet versus 18.2 in the 7 Series and 16.3 in the S-Class. The CT6 makes do with 15.3 cubic feet of cargo room. The A8’s rear seats don’t fold down because of the power reclining and massage functions, but a small pass-through is available as part of a Cold Weather Package (to accommodate skis, presumably).\n\nSafety\nNo crash-test ratings are available for the Audi A8.\n\nDespite being in need of a redesign, the A8 features quite a few electronic safety systems but, in typical German luxury-car fashion, nearly all of them are options. Standard in the A8 4.0T are blind spot warning, a backup camera, parking assist sensors and an around-view camera. The $2,250 Driver Assistance Package adds active lane keeping assist, adaptive cruise control and forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking.\n\nA head-up display is also standard and it includes a flashing red light if you happen to be following the car in front of you more closely than the A8 is comfortable with. In moderate-speed traffic, it was such an annoyance that I switched off the display more often than not. See all the A8’s standard features here.\nValue in Its Class\nThe 2016 Audi A8 L starts at $82,425 including destination fee. A 4.0T Sport starts at $91,425 and my test car had three option packages: Rear Seat Comfort (including power rear outboard seats with ventilation, massage and powered lumbar support), Driver Assistance (adaptive cruise control, active lane keeping and automatic high beams) and Cold Weather (multifunction heated steering wheel, heated rear seats and a rear-seat pass-through). Total as-tested came to $96,175.\n\nCompetitors at the top of the luxury flagship field are well-known: The stalwart BMW 750i xDrive and Mercedes-Benz S550 4Matic are the best-matched alternatives to the Audi A8. The BMW features a twin-turbocharged V-8 engine, as well, but is rear-wheel-drive biased rather than having the front-wheel-drive platform the A8 sits on. The BMW is also more expensive, however, starting at $98,395 for an 750i xDrive, with options that can push it well over $130,000. The Mercedes-Benz S550 is similar, also featuring a twin-turbo V-8 and optional all-wheel drive. Its starting price of $99,575 can be pushed up over $145,000 with all of Mercedes’ fancy bells and whistles.\n\nA more cost-friendly option is the new Cadillac CT6, a 7 Series-sized sedan that weighs less than a 5 Series and forgoes the ubiquitous V-8 engine for a more modest (but still powerful) twin-turbo V-6. The CT6 starts at $65,390 and, even when you load it up with high-quality leather, a Panaray audio system and lots of automated safety features, it comes in just about where the other sedans start their base pricing.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe A8, Audi’s full-size flagship sedan, competes with the BMW 7 Series and Jaguar XJ in a segment dominated by the Mercedes-Benz S-Class. The fourth-generation A8, which seats up to five, brought evolutionary exterior styling, a revamped interior and improved gas mileage. All-wheel drive is standard and the A8 is offered in standard-wheelbase and extended-length L form.\n\nAudi offers a high-performance S8 that makes 520 horsepower. It’s covered separately in the Cars.com Research section.\nNew for 2013\nThe 4.2-liter V-8 has been dropped, and two new engines are available for the A8. There’s a supercharged 3.0-liter V-6 and a twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8. With the introduction of the new V-6, the A8’s starting price drops by about $6,500 compared with last year.\nExterior\nThe A8’s styling is marked by the incorporation of Audi’s distinctive white LED daytime running lights in the shape of checkmarks underneath the headlights. Taking it a step further, Audi makes all the lights available as LED, including low beams, high beams, signals, markers and cornering lights. In this arrangement, the low beams themselves comprise multiple LED segments that follow the checkmark curve of the running lights, and the LED high beams remain at the top in a more conventional projector-beam shape.\n\nOverall length on the standard 117.8-inch wheelbase sedan is 202.2 inches. The L models are 122.9 inches in wheelbase and 207.4 overall. Exterior features include:\n\nStandard 19-inch alloy wheels; available 20-inch alloy wheels\nStandard rain-sensing wipers\nStandard bi-xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights\nStandard headlight washers\nStandard power glass sunroof\nAvailable powered trunk lid\n\nInterior\nThe A8 seats four or five people depending on the rear-seat configuration, and all models have leather upholstery. The interior was modernized, especially in terms of high-tech features, with the redesign. The automatic transmission’s gear selector is a shift-by-wire handle on the center console, an approach similar to what BMW uses in its 7 Series. The A8’s Multi Media Interface was upgraded with improved menus and a touchpad that recognizes handwriting, giving a new way to input characters for the standard navigation system.\n\nA premium Bang & Olufsen stereo option has 19 channels, 21 speakers and more than 1,400 watts of amplifier power. Interior features include:\n\nStandard navigation system with Google Earth\nStandard dual-zone automatic air conditioning\nAvailable rear air-conditioning controls\nAvailable heated steering wheel\nStandard heated front seats; ventilation available\nStandard CD stereo\n\nUnder the Hood\nThree engines are offered, and all of them team with an eight-speed automatic transmission and drive all four wheels through Audi’s Quattro all-wheel-drive system. Mechanical features include:\n\n\nStandard 333-hp, supercharged 3.0-liter V-6\nOptional 420-hp, twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 with fuel-saving cylinder-deactivation technology\nOptional 500-hp, 6.3-liter 12-cylinder\nQuattro all-wheel drive has a 40/60 torque split (front/rear), giving the car more of a sporty rear-wheel-drive feel\nOptional rear sport differential\n\nSafety\nAvailable safety features include a blind spot warning system, a lane departure warning system and night vision, which shows the road ahead on the instrument panel and can detect and highlight pedestrians and animals.\n\nThe optional adaptive cruise control’s radar sensor detects impending collisions. At first, the system sounds a warning and jolts the brakes momentarily if the A8 closes too quickly on an obstacle. If a crash is unavoidable, another available system can initiate full braking to soften the impact. Standard safety features include:\n\nFront and rear side-impact airbags\nSide curtain airbags\nKnee airbag\nAll-disc antilock brakes\nElectronic stability system\nTraction control",

      "expert_review": "The 2014 Audi A8 L TDI doesn’t let being diesel-powered detract from its luxuriousness, but its improved fuel economy doesn’t push it immediately ahead of its competitors.\n\nAudi’s A8 is in a tough position, battling crowd-favorite luxury flagships like the BMW 7 Series, Mercedes-Benz S-Class and Lexus LS, which you can compare here. Last redesigned for the 2011 model year, for 2014 the A8 takes a big step toward saying “Hey, look at me!” with unparalleled fuel economy in its class thanks to a new diesel engine. Compare the 2014 to the 2013 here.\n\nDiesel is a dirty word. It’s not what most buyers expect a luxury automaker to shove under the hood of its flagship car, though Mercedes-Benz and Audi have been selling clean-diesel models in the U.S. for years now. (A diesel version of Mercedes’ redesigned 2014 S-Class is also on its way.) The A8 will see minor changes soon, with a refreshed 2015 model showing up overseas first.\n\nThe 2014 A8 L TDI is available only in extended-wheelbase L versions, with a huge backseat, standard all-wheel drive and an EPA rating of 24/36/28 mpg city/highway/combined. Pricing starts at $83,395 including a destination charge, and the car I tested came in at $99,445 with options. The A8 L TDI costs $3,700 more than an A8 L with the entry-level supercharged V-6, which is EPA rated 18/28/21 mpg.\n\nExterior & Styling\nWith the exception of a small “TDI” badge on the rear passenger side, there’s no visual differences to an A8 L TDI — well, except for our tester’s massive “TDI clean diesel” stickers.\n\nAudi shot the popularity of LED running lights into the stratosphere; they’re now available even on compact cars. But Audi still does it best, and the A8 is a prime example of how to do LEDs correctly. The horizontal LED strips make the front end look even wider, and the headlights themselves are LEDs.\n\nThe masculine sedan doesn’t show off its chiseled styling very well when painted white, as our tester was. Darker colors better accentuate the A8’s sleek body lines.\n\nHow It Drives\nLuxury-car owners don’t want to hear typical diesel engine clatter, feel harsh vibrations through the seat and steering wheel, or poke along the road like there’s a mouse turning a wheel under the hood. That’s why automakers are continually stepping up their diesel game in the U.S. with additional refinement and bigger fuel-economy numbers. That’s especially apparent in diesel-powered luxury cars from Audi and Mercedes.\n\nThe A8 L TDI offers one of the most seamless diesel experiences I’ve ever had, with as few vibrations as a gasoline car. Good luck knowing the engine is even running when the windows are up. None of the A8’s luxuriousness is taken away because it sucks up diesel instead of gasoline; the engine is quiet at idle and emits a strangely powerful, non-diesel soundtrack during heavy acceleration.\n\nThe turbocharged 3.0-liter diesel six-cylinder makes 240 horsepower and 406 pounds-feet of torque. It’s the huge torque — helped by an eight-speed automatic transmission — that moves this 4,500-pound, extended-wheelbase land yacht effortlessly. Acceleration is brisk and buttery smooth, as you’d expect from a luxury car, though passing at 60 mph doesn’t have quite the punch it does at lower speeds. Audi says zero to 60 mph comes in a very believable 6.4 seconds, which is the slowest A8 by almost a full second, though not pokey by any means.  Of course, the main highlight of the new diesel engine is fuel economy. The A8 L TDI doesn’t disappoint, with big EPA estimates — its 28 mpg combined rating is the same as a four-cylinder Toyota Camry — that are repeatable in the real world. I drove the A8 347 miles in mixed conditions and returned 29.8 mpg, with speeds averaging 30 mph. Highway speeds, though, are where the A8 L TDI hits its mileage sweet spot; while cruising at 65 mph, I easily reached the highway rating of 36 mpg. Rush-hour traffic is a different story; I averaged an abysmal 15.1 mpg on a drive that took an hour and nine minutes to travel 11 miles, averaging 9 mph. Thanks, Chicago Marathon.\n\nAudi took a stab at making the A8 L TDI a large, athletic sedan instead of simply a luxury sofa on four wheels, with mixed success (Lexus is fully dedicated to the sofa-on-wheels approach). The A8 is more at home when leisurely cruising all 856.8 miles of its projected range on the highway rather than carving corners. A standard air suspension with adjustable firmness and ride height does its best to give the A8 athletic handling in its most aggressive and sportiest Dynamic driving mode — three adjustability settings of Comfort, Automatic and Dynamic are available. Our tester had the base air suspension, though a Sport air suspension is optional. The big sedan isn’t totally useless on off-ramps in Dynamic mode, with well-controlled body motion and good grip from the available 20-inch wheels and no-cost optional summer tires. That said, I’d gladly skip those wheels and tires for a suppler-riding wheel and tire combo that hopefully wouldn’t thwack as much over rough roads.\n\nThis ain’t Audi’s dainty (comparatively speaking) 3,858-pound S4, and the A8 L TDI’s 4,564 pounds become obvious once you start throwing around its weight, so I preferred to keep the car in its least aggressive Comfort setting. The experience is completely customizable, with Dynamic, Comfort and Auto settings for individual engine/transmission, steering and suspension calibrations. An available Sport Plus Package dials up the A8 another notch with sport steering, a sport differential and that adaptive sport air suspension.\n\nInterior\nBoy, did I miss the Audi A8 L TDI’s massaging seats when I jumped into a 2014 Hyundai Equus a week later. Hyundai’s budget competitor to the A8 and other full-sizers just couldn’t sooth rush-hour traffic tempers like the A8’s legitimately relaxing massaging seats did for front passengers (they’re included in a $4,000 Premium Package). I’ll always remember you, Wave setting No. 5.\n\nThe rest of the interior has held up well since the car’s introduction as a 2011 model. Audi’s interiors are top-notch, swaying to the sportier side of design, with fewer classic luxury touches and more high-tech, almost mechanical décor. The A8’s striking ambient lighting is more “Tron” than “Cocoon.”\n\nBeing the L version of the A8, the TDI has enough room to lose a small child in the backseat. Its wheelbase is 5.1 inches longer than a regular A8, which equates to 4.2 more inches of rear legroom. The rear is available with features commonly found up front, like heated rear seats, separate power rear seats, individual climate zones and a dual 10-inch screen with a DVD player option.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nChances are you’re not going to use Audi’s Multi-Media Interface knob-based system to its full extent the first day, or week, of ownership. The level of customization, tricks, shortcuts and depth of usability is huge. Yes, it’s complicated, but once you get acclimated to how the system works it becomes a useful tool that allows you to take advantage of all the A8’s systems. Be prepared to open the owner’s manual more than once.\n\nThe various dynamic driving modes, navigation, drive-assist sensitivity, massaging seats, interior lighting options and more are all accessible through the MMI dial. Minimizing the number of physical buttons with a knob-based system like this has one flaw, though: changing driving settings is slow and distracting. You won’t find a Sport or Comfort button on the dashboard or steering wheel that allows you to easily switch between driving modes.\n\nOur tester was fitted with a 1,400-watt, 19-speaker Bang & Olufsen stereo, a $6,300 option. Those in tune with stereos and sound quality should compare the expensive option to the standard 630-watt, 14-speaker Bose stereo to see if the B&O is worth the cost. To my ears, the B&O has lost its wow factor since the first S8 I tested with the system back in 2007. Bailing on the B&O may be an easy way to stay in budget considering it’s nearly the price of an entire decade-old A8.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe A8 L’s long wheelbase doesn’t translate to a massive amount of cargo space. A measly 13.2 cubic feet of trunk space is less than what a compact sedan like the 2013 Hyundai Elantra offers, at 14.8 cubic feet. It’s considerably smaller than the LS 460’s 18.0 cubic feet and the 7 Series’ 17.7 cubic feet. You’d expect a large trunk from such a large sedan, but the A8 doesn’t deliver. Nor does it have folding rear seats, though there is a pass-through.\n\nSafety & Reliability\nThe A8 hasn’t been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nAn optional Driver Assistance Package, for $3,250, includes Audi’s lane assist to keep the A8 from drifting out of its lane, plus a pre-sense plus system that automatically brakes if a collision is imminent and much more. Audi’s blind spot warning system is included with the $4,000 Premium Package as well that also includes ventilated front massaging seats.\n\nSee here for more standard safety features, and here to find out how well child-safety seats fit in our Car Seat Check.\n\nGerman luxury cars don’t have a reputation for being reliable. The A8 received a rating of four (out of five) in J.D. Power and Associates’ predicted reliability analysis. It has not been rated by Consumer Reports. The fact that the A8 is filled with gadgets doesn’t bode well for its reliability, as that’s often lower when there’s more stuff to break.\n\nAudi as a brand, however, is quickly climbing Consumer Reports’ reliability charts, moving up four places in one year to be ranked the fourth-most-reliable automaker overall in Consumer Report’s October 2013 report, in which subscribers rated 1.1 million vehicles. While Audi was fourth, two other luxury automakers ranked first and third: Lexus claimed the top spot and Acura came in third.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe A8 L TDI showcases what clean diesels are capable of, with a nearly seamless driving experience and Camry-like fuel economy. Getting 28 mpg combined, Fueleconomy.gov says it’s possible to make up the $3,700 premium you’ll pay for the diesel (versus the base engine) within seven years; as of November 2013, the site put annual fuel costs at $2,050 for the TDI and $2,600 for the supercharged V-6. That’s assuming you’ll drive 15,000 miles a year, 45 percent on the highway and 55 percent in the city. If you drive purely on the highway, you could make up the cost more quickly. The A8 TDI’s engine does require regular refilling of the AdBlue diesel exhaust fluid, a fluid used to keep the diesel emissions clean. Recommended intervals are at 5,000 miles, 15,000 miles and then every 10,000 miles, according to an Audi representative.\n\nThe bigger question is, how important is fuel economy to luxury drivers who are buying or leasing an $80,000 luxury sedan? The pricier Lexus LS 600h L hybrid has nominal mileage benefits over the base LS 460 L, but it’s one of the quietest cars on the road thanks to its almost silent powertrain. The A8 L TDI trounces the LS 600h L’s fuel economy, but great fuel economy doesn’t increase the A8’s trunk size or make the MMI system any easier to learn.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nAudi’s already luxurious and stylish flagship sedan is getting a makeover for 2015 with a horsepower bump and updated front- and rear-end styling.ExteriorThe A8 was redesigned for 2011 and the 2015 update only improves on its dynamic look. The stunning LED headlights return to the A8’s face, with a slightly tweaked design for the new year. The hood also wears a slightly freshened look with more creases, and the front and rear bumpers have been enlarged for a wider look.\n\nSpecific S8 model updates include larger air intakes in the lower front bumper and less chrome trim than the regular version for a “sportier look,” Audi said in a statement. In back, the taillights wear a slightly modified design, and there’s a new oval-shaped quad sport exhaust tailpipe. Both models get a new selection of 20-inch wheels and a choice of five additional exterior paint colors.InteriorThe A8’s cabin design and finishes carry over to 2015, but Audi says the new models use “significant acoustic measures for a quieter cabin” as well as “optimized trunk packaging for improved space and usability.” The updated S8 model sees some cabin additions, however, with a new trim choice: Vermont Brown leather seats and surfaces paired with carbon twill copper inlays.\n\nIn terms of features and controls, Audi’s MMI navigation plus system will again be available, including the Google Earth mapping and Google Voice search functionalities. The Audi connect system is also available. It provides real- time localized weather, news and live fuel prices as well as in-vehicle Wi-Fi connectivity for up to eight wireless devices.Under the HoodFor 2015, the turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 gets a horsepower bump from 420 to 435. The TDI version that joined the A8 roster carries over to the 2015 model and is again joined by the entry-level 3.0-liter and range-topping 6.3-liter W-12 model; the latter gets Audi’s Cylinder on Demand cylinder-deactivation system for 2015. For the S8, the 520-hp, twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8 engine returns. An eight-speed automatic is again the sole transmission.\n\nAs far as other changes under the hood, Audi says that a new electromechanical power-steering system should provide “greater comfort and agility, while improving fuel efficiency.” Official fuel-economy figures have not yet been released, however.SafetyLoads of new available safety equipment join the A8 and S8 features lists this year. Highlights include active lane assist, Secondary Collision Assist, Night Vision Assistant with Pedestrian Detection, a head-up display and Audi Park Assist.",
