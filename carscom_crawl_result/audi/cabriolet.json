      "expert_review": "Audi’s 1996 Cabriolet, which is a fancy name for convertible, assures one of the pleasures of open-air motoring, a feeling of the good life, and the ability to taste the fruits of upscale performance.\n\nThe Audi Cabriolet constitutes a blend of high-tech mechanicals and the accouterments of a better-class automobile through Audi’s V-6 engine with a variable geometric intake manifold and the leather and walnut interior.\n\nAudi is an old-line German automobile manufacturer whose strong suit is quality and advanced engineering. The car is definitely in the luxury car category with a base price of $36,800.\n\n“It has the advantage over other cabriolets in that it has front-wheel drive,” said Chad Spidle, sales manager for Tom Wood Audi. “And you can actually fit two people in the back seat. That’s something you can’t do in some other makes.”\n\nAs a four- seater, the Cabriolet has some Teutonic overtones, tempered for American tastes, so that the driver feels right at home.\n\nThe cockpit layout is fairly conventional, with the center console providing a home for the four- speed automatic transmission’s shift quadrant.\n\nInstrumentation features a tachometer, temperature and fuel gauges, digital clock, and an odometer, all standard fare, as well as an electronic, 160-mph speedometer (more for effect than reality). At 172 horsepower, the Cabriolet’s V-6 motor needs a few more horses before trotting along at 160 per.\n\nAudi says that the power-actuated top can be raised or lowered from the driver’s seat during the time needed for the light to turn green at a stoplight. It’s a single-latch, one-button convenience.\n\n“The really neat thing is the top,” Spidle said. “It automatically stows beneath a hard tonneau cover that raises up when the top is coming down and then covers it when it’s in place.\n\n“Of course, the cover raises up when you’re putting the top up and then drops down over the empty storage area.”\n\nUp or down, you’re riding in the elegance of Kodiak leather upholstery and genuine burled walnut trim. There are no hair-shirt production convertibles on the market these days, so, the all-season Cabriolet sports air conditioning, Audi Delta stereo and a full complement of power accessories.\n\nA new stereo feature is Audi’s graduated audio level adjustment system, which automatically boosts volume as road speed increases. The radio display system indicates the type of programming and a station’s call letters. The system functions by decoding a signal sent out by broadcasters, especially useful when traveling.\n\nAudi’s V-6 is a 2.8-liter motor of 169 cubic inches that slightly exceeds the performance benchmark figure of one horsepower per cubic inch.\n\nThere is a single overhead cam for each bank of three cylinders. The one thing I would prefer to be done differently would be for the cams to be driven by a chain instead of a belt.\n\nThe four-speed automatic with its dynamic shift program is the only way the Cabriolet comes. There is no manual gearbox , because Audi figures that the convertible is more a high-speed international touring car than a road-racing sports model.\n\nIn Europe, you apparently can go touring with verve, as Audi electronically limits the top speed for the American market to 130 mph. Zero to 60 mph with the automatic is rated at 10.3 seconds.\n\nThe car rates as a compact, with a wheelbase of 100.6 inches and 176 inches for its overall length. Curb weight is 3,364 pounds, heavy enough to impart good ride qualities but not so much so that performance is impaired.",

      "expert_review": "Germans build handsome four-place convertibles with the same level of seriousness they apply to creating opera, dark beer, tennis players and hasenpfeffer.\n\nThat makes ragtops by Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Audi not only magnificently engineered cars, but also the prettiest statements in topless travel since Godiva streaked Coventry.\n\nMercedes power and dignity, of course, have always been expensive acquisitions. It costs $80,000 to view receding traffic from the leather-covered seats and sofa of an E320 Cabriolet these days. Knowing the vehicle will likely outlive you, your finance company and Steffi Graf does not soften the pain.\n\nAt $40,000, BMW’s 325i Convertible costs half as much as the E320, which should make it twice as appealing. Bimmer’s bias, however, has always been on performance before elegance and there is no better proof than in their somewhat stiff, spare interiors.\n\nBut the new Audi Cabriolet–as brut and sec are interchangeable among Champagnes, so there is no meaningful difference between a cabriolet and a convertible–seems to have the best of both marques and the downsides of neither.\n\nIt costs less than the BMW and the accommodations are much more inviting. It is neither as ponderous nor as haughty as the Mercedes-Benz. In fact, the Audi’s distinct personality is that of a pleasant, smooth, uncomplaining daily companion; a car much more a leisure form than a mode of transportation.\n\nAbove all, this is an effortless car executing the routine chores of steering, braking, shifting gears and soaking up lumps and ulcers of antique asphalt without bothering its driver with such labors.\n\nThe car is nice, in the nicest sense. Polite, without being the least bit boring. Relaxing, as in being one of those rare convertibles capable of carrying occupants any distance, day in and month out, without leaving them limp, element-blasted and travel bitchy.\n\nBut enough flattery.\n\nAlthough the purpose and means of Audi’s Cabriolet compares most favorably with the other topless Teutons, its 172-horsepower V-6 does not. The 189-horsepower BMW 325i Convertible and the 217-horsepower Mercedes-Benz E320 Cabriolet are much better endowed. It follows they accelerate quicker and run out faster.\n\nNot that the Audi is a slug. But its pace falls just a little short of looks that ooze zip and mischief.\n\nAudi’s styling is also a little closer to Pasadena than Rodeo Drive.\n\nIn fairness, what is safe and conservative to one set of eyes is discreet and reassuring to another. To these eyes, the Cabriolet appears a little blocky, its sharp edges rounded to suggest modern styling without actually going to a fresh design and noticeable aerodynamics. And every time we stepped to the blunt rear, a nasty little voice kept squawking: Mercury Tracer, Mercury Tracer.\n\nAlthough this is Audi’s maiden effort at building a car for those who enjoy smoggy breezes through their forelocks, the Cabriolet goes way beyond being an entry-level Audi 90 with its lid removed and rolled back.\n\nGranted, this was a sensible and marketable place to start.\n\nFor the Audi 90 is already a sound mid-size luxury car, accepted and proven. It wears enough burled walnut to make wood in other cars look like token trim. Standard equipment includes all conceivable conveniences short of the quite unnecessary or overindulgent.\n\nAnd the interior is warm, comfortable and absolutely splendid. Especially door panels, carpeting and upholstery, which come in black with blue inserts–a color scheme the world hasn’t enjoyed since we gave up fountain pens and blue-black ink.\n\nAlthough sized cozier than the E320 and the BMW, the Audi is far from a shrink fit. Front seating is enormously comfortable and even bad postures will go unnoticed.\n\nThere is no rubbing of shoulders or knees, and plenty of leg room for drivers and passengers long of s anks. Although not in the back seat where only little guys will be able to sit square.\n\nThere are many questions attached to the purchase of any convertible. With top up, does it become just another fair-weather friend allowing the entrance of drafts, droplets and leaf-blower noise? With top down, will you need a comb-through by Jose Eber or a one-hour consult with Heddy’s House of Wigs?\n\nHow much chassis strengthening was done to prevent the car from trying to turnaround its longitudinal axis? Is raising and lowering the top a one-hand or six-man operation?\n\nThe bad news first. On cobbles and cracked surfaces, the Audi does indeed develop cowl and windshield shake with a noticeable amount of steering column movement.\n\nThe good news is that it isn’t enough to throw you through the nearest storefront. But it is there.\n\nWith the top up, sound and weather conditions inside the car are almost those of a sedan.\n\nWith the top down, there is a surprising lack of cockpit noise and wind bluster. Conversations and Charles Osgood at normal volumes are possible even at freeway speeds. For those who prefer not to share their secrets with the family in the next lane, whispering is possible with an optional mesh wind screen raised behind the front seat backs.\n\nOperating the top is a breeze, pun intended.\n\nTwist a T-handle where the header meets the top of the windshield frame. Push up and touch a button on the center console. Look smug as the canvas top plus header, brackets and soft rear window disappear under a hard boot in 20 seconds.\n\nBut the lasting memory will be of the Audi’s relaxed ride, the precise fit of its parts, their quality finish and ability to work together in absolute harmony. Steering is responsive and devoid of twitches and guesswork. Brakes are powerful without being brutish.\n\nThis is a convertible with a little to learn, but so many easy pleasures to offer. As Gertrude Stein might have said: Whatever is there is certainly there without seeming to be there.\n\n1995 Audi Cabriolet\n\nThe Good: Most pleasant, most affordable German convertible. Warm and tasteful interior. With top up, car stays noise- and weather-tight; with top down, breezes are minimal.\n\nThe Bad: Short on power. Styling more conservative than Newt.\n\nThe Ugly: Rear end of Mercury\n\nCost Base, $35,900. As tested, $37,695. (Includes two air bags, leather upholstery, alarm system, power top, anti-lock brakes, four-speed automatic, sound system, air conditioning, wood trim, power steering as standard equipment. Also optional pearlescent metallic paint, cold weather package, breeze screen for top-down motoring.)\n\nEngine 2.8-liter V6 developing 172 horsepower.\n\nType Front-engine, front-wheel drive, four-passenger convertible.\n\nPerformance 0-60 m.p.h., as tested, with automatic, 9.9 seconds. Top s peed, manufacturer’s estimate, 126 m.p.h. Fuel consumption, EPA city and highway, 18 and 26 m.p.g.\n\nCurb Weight 3,340 pounds.",

      "expert_review": "Do you like to drive a car no one else has? Do you think it would be nice if you rarely, if ever, saw another car quite like yours?\n\nIf so, you might want to tool on down to your local Audi dealer and take a look at the new Audi Cabriolet – if there’s one available. (A recent check at Contemporary Cars in Maitland – the Orlando area’s only Audi dealer – turned up just two in inventory.)\n\nJust 1,360 of the limited-production Cabriolets will be imported in 1994, according to Audi spokesman Pat Fitzgerald. That means if you buy or lease this car, you likely won’t see another Audi convertible parked next to yours at the country club.\n\nIt also means you’ll be the owner of an extremely well-built, well-equipped and enjoyable luxury convertible.\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nAudi’s 2.8-liter, 172-horsepower V-6 engine – the only powerplant available in the Cabriolet – is every bit as smooth and quiet as a Lexus engine, which is the benchmark of the industry.\n\nIn normal driving, the overhead cam, 24-valve engine is whisper-quiet. But if you rev it to about 4,800 rpm, you’ll hear a pleasing turbine-like whoosh coming from the camshafts. It’s a pleasing sound that is music to the ears of those who appreciate state-of-the-art engineering.\n\nAudi builds the Cabriolet with a four-speed automatic transmission. No manual gearbox is available. The automatic can be switched from normal to sport modes by pressing a button on the wood-lined console.\n\nIn the sport mode, the shifts are delayed slightly to allow the engine to rev faster before shifting. This is supposed to result in quicker acceleration, but it seemed to make little difference.\n\nUnless you press the accelerator to the floor, it is difficult to notice the difference in the timing of the shifts.\n\nAs for performance, the front-wheel-drive Cabriolet is not particularly fast from a stop. As with many German cars, this one performs better at high speeds. From speeds of 40 mph and higher, the Cabriolet flies. Below that, performance is about average for a six-cylinder car.\n\nHANDLING\n\nMost convertibles are heavier than the two-door coupes from which they are derived. Without a roof, the car’s body has to be reinforced with an array of special braces and structural improvements. This is done for safety as well as performance.\n\nYou can usually tell how well a manufacturer beefs up the car’s frame by how much the body shakes and rattles when you drive over rough bumps.\n\nAudi’s engineers did a superb job of reinforcing the Cabriolet’s body structure. I repeatedly drove over a bumpy railroad crossing in Seminole County with the top both up and down. The cowl – the area near the base of the windshield – did not shake, as it might on an inexpensive convertible. And their were no squeaks or rattles.\n\nThiscar is one of the tightest convertibles I can recall driving.\n\nThe Cabriolet weighs 3,494 pounds, while the Audi 90 coupe on which it is based weighs 3,197 pounds. But the extra weight does not mean the Cabriolet handles poorly.\n\nIn fact, the car has a Grand Touring demeanor, meaning that the suspension isolates the passengers from bumps and road noise while delivering a sporty ride.\n\nThe ultra-stiff frame allows the suspension coil spring/gas-charged strut suspension system to provide a luxuriously smooth and nimble ride.\n\nStandard equipment includes power rack-and-pinion steering and four-wheel disc brakes equipped with an advanced anti-lock system. Both items were generally excellent.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nThe cloth top fits so tightly on the Cabriolet that when you slam one of the doors you can hear the top reverberate exactly as if you thumped your finger on a drum.\n\nThere are no wind or water leaks. The Cabriolet is as quiet to drive with the top up as a coupe. That’s an impressive achievement.\n\nOnce you get situated, the top is as simple as they come. Twist a lever in t he center of the windshield area and it pops up. Press a button and the top automatically folds into its storage compartment, just like a $100,000 Mercedes-Benz.\n\nOne bothersome aspect of raising and lowering the top is the rigmarole you have to go through. The car has to be in park or neutral with the key in the on position. The trunk has to be closed and locked. And the emergency brake must be on. Only then can you operate the power top.\n\nThe Cabriolet is outfitted with dual air bags and beefed up side-impact protection.\n\nAnd yet for all its noteworthy features, I can’t say I really fell in love with this car.\n\nFor one thing, I could not get truly comfortable in it. There was nothing to rest my right arm on as I drove. There is no armrest between the seats, so I was constantly looking for someplace to put my arm.\n\nDespite numerous attempts, I could not adjust the seats to a position where I felt that I was properly situated. It’s as if the pedal assembly is too close to the dash area, keeping you from stretching your legs to a comfortable driving position.\n\nNumerousthings, such as the radio that turns off with the ignition, and a finicky shift lever, made driving the Cabriolet a bit bothersome.\n\nThe Cabriolet does have rear seats, but they are next to useless. An adult would have to scrunch up and sit sideways to be even moderately comfortable.\n\nPerhaps those minor nuisances are the price one pays for driving something different.\n\nTruett’s tip: Audi’s new convertible is an exceptionally smooth, quiet and elegant luxury car. It might appeal to those few drivers who don’t mind spending a lot of money in order to drive something a little different.",

      "expert_review": "Heading into the sunset down Interstate 70, the wind whistling quietly overhead, was the perfect way to experience the top-down performance of Audi’s Cabriolet.\n\nRagtops and road trips have an irresistible appeal, especially when the summer’s heat is waning and cool nights foretell the coming autumn. When Audi’s convertible arrived for a test drive, we headed for a spin across the high plains and a rendezvous with the mountains of Colorado.\n\nMotoring through the late-evening stillness with the top down was almost surreal, but as soon as we rolled past an 18-wheeler the howl from its tires shattered the evening like it was made of crystal. The lack of noise with the top down was uncanny, thanks to the optional ($400) two-piece windblocker screen that snapped across the back seat and snuggled up close to the headrests of the front seats. Windblockers are fairly common among imported convertibles these days, but this one seemed to do a better job than any I have experienced.\n\nAt 70 mph with the side windows up we could have a normal conversation, although it was nearly impossible to hear the radio unless the volume was cranked up. Mostly we left the radio off and enjoyed watching the stars peek out as the sky turned from amber to cobalt.\n\nThe Cabriolet’s base price is $34,600, the same as 1997. Our test car was equipped with the Premium Package of leather seats, power top, wood trim and remote locking, at an additional cost of $3,700. I suspect that most folks who are looking for a convertible in this price range will choose this package because the power top makes the convertible experience so much easier to enjoy, Plus, leather and wood add warmth and luxury to the interior.\n\nPutting the power top up and down was simple: Twist the T-handle to unlatch the top from the windshield, hit the button on the console and wait for the top to hide itself electrically under a hard cover behind the rear seat. The whole operation takes about 30 seconds, which seems like an eternity when you’re in a hurry.\n\nEven though the Cabriolet is a four-seater, the wheelbase is only 100.6 inches. Its limited luggage capacity and a small back seat pretty much relegate it to two people and their gear for a weekend trip. We ended up putting one suitcase in the trunk and one in the back seat. Upon arrival at our destination, we did, however, squeeze two children and one adult into the back seat for a short drive to dinner.\n\nPower comes from a 2.8-liter V6 that has 172 horsepower, and it drives through the front wheels. The Audi is one of the few front-wheel-drive convertibles, which should give it good winter traction. Acceleration with the automatic transmission, a no-charge option, is moderate, yet it whizzed along at highway speeds without apparent effort. On the long climbs up I-70 west of Denver, I shifted into third gear and it kept pace with the fastest traffic and never seemed to breathe hard.\n\nHighway mileage is rated at 24 mpg, and we seemed to average at least that while driving no slower than 70 mph.\n\nVarious other observations:\n\nSpending all day on the highway makes one aware of the fact that at 70 mph, wind noise with the top up is almost as loud as it is with the top down.\n\nThe contoured leather seats did a good job of providing support for long stints behind the wheel, but more support for the upper back and shoulder region would be welcome.\n\nI missed the lack of a tilt steering wheel.\n\nHandling was crisp, especially on mountain curves. Four-wheel disc brakes, with anti-lock standard, scrubbed off speed quickly.\n\nThe lack of a top means that bumps send shudders through the dash and steering wheel, which is fairly common among convertibles today.\n\nThe instruments were large and clearly marked. At night, they glow with soft red light so they are not distracting.\n\nCupholders built into the center console are mall and will not hold large paper cups.\n\nPrice\n\nThe base price of our test car was $34,600. Options included Pelican Blue Metallic paint, Premium Package, 16-inch alloy wheels, windscreen, heated front seats, heated windshield washer nozzles and heated door locks.\n\nThe sticker price was $40,530.\n\nWarranty\n\nThe standard warranty is for three years or 50,000 miles. All maintenance for three years or 50,000 miles is done without charge.\n\nVehicles for The Star’s week-long test drives are supplied by the auto manufacturers.\n\nPoint: Audi’s Cabriolet is one of the few front-wheel-drive convertibles. Equipping it with the Premium Package raises the level of comfort significantly because it includes a power top and leather seats.\n\nCounterpoint: The trunk and back seat are both fairly small, which limits the amount of luggage you can take, and some cowl shake is noticeable over bumpy roads.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\n\nENGINE: 2.8-liter, V6\n\nTRANSMISSION: automatic\n\nWHEELBASE: 100.6 inches\n\nCURB WEIGHT: 3,364 lbs.\n\nBASE PRICE: $34,600\n\nPRICE AS DRIVEN: $40,530\n\nMPG RATING: 19 city, 24 hwy.",
