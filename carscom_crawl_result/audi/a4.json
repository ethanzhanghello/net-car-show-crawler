      "expert_review": "German automakers are often seen as a serious bunch. Stoic in their resolve for outstanding engineering and firmness, it seems they never allow room for fun.\n\nBut once in awhile, they let their hair down and get loose with a wild little model that’s just heaps of fun.\n\nHere are two, the Audi A4 Quattro and BMW 318ti California.\n\nAUDI A4\n\nThe Audi A4 has been out for about a year, doing battle with BMW’s 3-series and the Mercedes C-class, not to mention a few Asian competitors. The advantage it has over them all is a lower base price and the availability of an all-wheel-drive Quattro model.\n\nVolkswagen’s upscale division has fielded a car that not only is a dream from a marketing standpoint, it’s just plain fun to drive.\n\nLike many European automobiles, you’ll feel every bump and tar strip. The trade-off is superb handling. Steering is quick and communicative, and cornering attitude is flat. The firm buckety seats hold one in place in the twisties, but lack give. The all-wheel drive doesn’t just come into play during sloppy weather. It adds a great deal of handling ability when it’s dry.\n\nThe 172-horsepower V6 has good power, especially at highway speeds. But the five-speed automatic seems to hold it back. Better opt for the five-speed manual. The anti-lock brakes worked quickly.\n\nInside, it’s all business, with somber black leatherette accenting a typically Audi-like interior. Space up front is good. In back, it requires some compromise with front-seat passengers. Trunk space is good compared to the 90, but less so than comparable sedans.\n\nThe A4 Quattro is as fully equipped as any luxury sedan and features a similar price. Base price is $26,500. That provides a front-drive sedan with leatherette seats and power everything, including good handling. The all-wheel-drive system adds $1,550 to the tab. Toss in a few extras and the price quickly climbed to an as-tested $31,395. Very reasonable in this class for a lot of fun.\n\nBMW 318TI CALIFORNIA\n\nThe BMW 318ti is funky in a way few BMWs are. It looks like a sedan that’s had its backside hacked off, while it has a youthful feel that few luxury-oriented automakers seem to understand.\n\nBMW goes one step beyond with its California edition. Instead of a small moonroof or a convertible top, the California meets it halfway, featuring the structural rigidity of a hardtop but a truly humongous roof opening. It looks extra funky with the roofstack back: This is not your father’s BMW.\n\nBut it’s not just the cute looks that earn this car its kudos, it’s the way it drives (this is, after all, a BMW). It features the mechanical package common to all 318s. That means a 1.9-liter dual-overhead cam, 16-valve, 4-cylinder engine. Although larger this year, the engine’s horsepower remains unchanged at 138, but torque grows to 133 foot-pounds. EPA-rated at 23 mpg city and 31 mpg highway, this car has sufficient power for its tidy size. The precise five-speed manual transmission was a joy to shift, the clutch just as easy to use as any BMW’s. The manual is a good choice to make the most of this engine; the four-speed automatic is an unneeded $975 option. Four-wheel disc brakes with anti-lock are standard, as are dual airbags.\n\nHandling is fun — this BMW is as tossable and great to drive as any Bimmer, it just has less power. This lets you savor the handling and engine power at hand even more than in a more powerful BMW. The back end can bounce around a bit in the rear-drive hatchback, but enthusiasts won’t find this a flaw; it’s fun to play with.\n\nThe interior, while not opulent, is well-constructed and feels like any 3-series. The California package, in addition to the wild roof, adds alloy wheels with H-rated 205/60R15 tires, fog lights, body-colored bumpers and side skirts, leather-covered steering wheel and hand brake. Leather seating and an on-board computer are among theo tions. The 318ti starts at $20,560, with the test car topping out at $24,460. Funky — but this funky little Bimmer screams fun.\n\nSo there you have it, two German sweethearts, two cars that could only come from the heart of the Black Forest. It’s great to be able to choose from among cars that are not only fun, but have a distinct character, an increasingly rare commodity in the automotive market these days.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Audi A4?\n\nThe five-seat Audi A4 rolls into a new model year with only minor changes. That’s not a bad thing when you consider the A4’s generous range of standard features, roomy cabin and punchy turbocharged four-cylinder engine. All-wheel drive is standard on every A4, including the Allroad wagon and the performance-oriented S4 sedan. The standard turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder delivers 201 horsepower and comes paired with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. A 261-hp version of this engine is also available, and each utilizes a 12-volt mild-hybrid system to boost fuel economy. Want a little more get up and go? The spicier S4 sedan is motivated by a 349-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 paired with an eight-speed automatic. The A4’s rivals include the Genesis G70, Lexus IS, Mercedes-Benz C-Class and BMW 3 Series.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Audi A4?\n\nIt’s a matter of shuffled features and option packages when it comes to changes to the 2023 A4/S4 sedan and A4 Allroad wagon. The Black Optic Plus Package, available on A4s fitted with the more powerful 261-hp, turbo four-cylinder, now includes black exhaust tips and a small rear spoiler. Also, adaptive cruise control is now included in the optional Convenience Package. The S4 now comes standard with 19-inch wheels and summer tires; all-season tires are optional.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Audi A4 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nAll-wheel drive\nLED headlights with high-beam assist\n1-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nLeather upholstery\nHeated front seats\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure warning\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nAudi Virtual Cockpit with 12.3-inch digital instrument panel\nHeated steering wheel\nAdaptive cruise control\n360-degree camera system\nHead-up display\nNavigation\nBang & Olufsen stereo\nBlind spot warning\nShould I Buy the 2023 Audi A4?\n\nThe A4 isn’t the fastest or flashiest compact luxury sedan, but it’s definitely one of the most well-rounded choices in a highly competitive field. Having AWD standard across the A4/Allroad/S4 lineup is a huge plus for car shoppers living in areas where roads can turn slick with rain, snow, or sleet. Both available turbocharged four-cylinder engines deliver peppy acceleration and return impressive fuel economy, too. The agile Allroad wagon is a savvy alternative to bulkier and thirstier SUVs, while the S4 is a suave and sophisticated means of getting where you’re going very quickly. The caveat with the S4 is a starting price that’s roughly $13,000 more than a base A4 sedan.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2022 Audi A4?\n\nThe five-seat Audi A4 is the German luxury brand’s rival to compact luxury cars like the BMW 3 Series, Mercedes-Benz C-Class and Genesis G70. Offered with standard all-wheel drive, the A4 comes with a choice of two turbocharged four-cylinder engines paired with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission and is available as a sedan or Allroad wagon. The performance-oriented S4 sedan gets a 349-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 and an eight-speed automatic.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2022 Audi A4?\n\nA4s with the 261-hp four-cylinder engine now come with a sport suspension that lowers the car. There’s also a new Black Optic Plus Package that includes black bumper accents, a matte-black grille with black badging, black mirror caps, black side sill blades and red-painted brake calipers.\n\nWhat Features in the 2022 Audi A4 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nQuattro all-wheel drive\nLED headlights with high-beam assist\nPower moonroof\n1-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nLeather upholstery\nHeated front seats\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure warning\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nKeyless access\nAudi Virtual Cockpit with 12.3-inch digital instrument panel\nHeated steering wheel\nAdaptive cruise control\n360-degree camera system\nHead-up display\nNavigation\nBang & Olufsen premium stereo\nBlind spot warning\nShould I Buy the 2022 Audi A4?\n\nThe A4 remains a smart choice among a wide range of worthy competitors.  While not as overly sporty or flashy as some rivals, the A4 offers a great blend of performance, refinement and fuel efficiency. Rear-seat accommodations are fine for a pair of adults, but squeezing three people back there could be tough. The S4 is a thrill to drive and has cooly understated looks, but a starting price of more than $50,000 could deter some shoppers.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Audi strikes a beautiful balance of sporty, luxurious and high-tech in the revised A4, delivering a satisfying compact sedan experience. \n\nVersus the competition: It’s not as athletic as competitors like the Alfa Romeo Giulia or BMW 3 Series, but the new A4 makes up in comfort what it lacks in edginess. It’s easily as quick as most of its competitors, offers similar technology and provides a luxury experience that outshines rivals from Acura, Infiniti and Lexus. \n\nThere’s been a seemingly never-ending parade of new SUVs showing up in our testing queue lately. Everyone has a new ute to sell to an increasingly ravenous customer base that loves high-riding, family-friendly, cargo-hauling boxes — so when something comes along that’s the antithesis of that mindset, it’s deliciously refreshing. That’s what we have here with Audi’s latest A4. It got a decent refresh of its styling and content for the 2020 model year, and the 2021 model got even more tweaks and refinements. German luxury specialist Audi has delivered a beautifully balanced and fun-to-drive — but not overly sporty — compact sports sedan that reminds you just how much more satisfying a low-slung sports sedan is than even the most hairy-chested, overpowered SUV out there. \n\nRelated: 2021 Audi Q5 Doesn’t Mess Much With a Good Thing\n\nMore, Greener Power\n\nThe news for the 2021 A4 primarily centers on a power upgrade. The car still offers two turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engines, but both now make more power and feature a standard 12-volt mild-hybrid system to boost efficiency. Both engines gain 13 horsepower, leaving the base A4 40 trim with 201 hp and the upgraded 45 trim with a healthier 261 hp. Torque remains unchanged at 236 pounds-feet in the base 40 model and 273 pounds-feet in the 45. Both engines mate only to a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission, and all-wheel drive is newly standard for 2021. The manual transmission was discontinued a while ago, and now there are no more front-wheel-drive models, either.\n\nBut you know what? I’m not even mad about it, because the A4 drives beautifully. The focus on balance is clearly apparent: The higher-spec engine I drove delivers ample, immediate thrust when called upon, and the automatic transmission is snappy and responsive. The car overall delivers a refined, poised driving experience that’s highly enjoyable. Its low seating position, tight handling and smooth yet communicative ride are all excellent reminders that, despite the usefulness of SUVs, they really aren’t made for enjoying the experience of driving. \n\nThis A4 is a bit too soft to be truly sporty; steering feel is direct but notably muted, and the suspension allows a bit more lean and bump-soaking cushiness than you’ll find in a comparable BMW or Alfa Romeo. Still, it’s no marshmallow, with the kind of higher-speed highway stability you expect from a German luxury brand. Overall, there’s just enough communication from the car’s mechanical components to be entertaining, and just enough isolation to keep things luxurious and refined. \n\nFuel economy for the 45 S Line version of the A4 is basically unchanged from 2020 despite the addition of the mild-hybrid system. It’s rated by the EPA at 24/31/27 mpg city/highway/combined — 1 mpg less on the highway than the 2020 AWD A4. If you opt for the base 2021 A4 with the less powerful engine, that’s estimated to net you a slightly better 25/34/28 mpg, but either way, the addition of standard AWD means there’ll be no getting the fuel economy of the FWD 2020 model, which rang in at 27/35/30 mpg. \n\nIn a week of mixed-use driving, I averaged 26.5 mpg — pretty good given the spirited manner in which I often found myself driving the A4. By comparison, the higher-powered A4’s rating is mid-pack among AWD compact luxury sedans: The new 2021 Acura TLX A-Spec is rated an inferior 21/29/24 mpg, the 2021 BMW 330i xDrive a superior 25/34/28 mpg and the new 2021 Genesis G70 2.0T AWD a considerably worse 20/27/23 mpg. \n\nStill a Benchmark Interior — for Now\n\nWe’re worried about Audi’s trend toward replacing every switch in the cabin with touch-sensitive panels — something American automakers tried a few years ago that didn’t go over well. The panels take away tactile feel for buttons, making for a more distracting experience — especially given that, in many cases, the touch panels don’t operate perfectly, requiring you to focus extra attention on them to make sure the function you tried to select has actually been selected. I’m happy to say the latest update to the A4 hasn’t created a completely “glass cockpit” just yet; there are still dedicated climate-control buttons and knobs, for instance, unlike on some larger Audis, such as the A6 and A8. \n\nThe front and center touchscreen was updated for the 2020 model year, and as in many cars these days, it’s been artlessly pasted onto the dashboard like an afterthought — or a tablet in a dock. Thankfully, unlike the latest Mercedes-Benz products, the steering wheel does not employ touch-sensitive areas — something I never thought I’d need to say.\n\nThe overall interior experience in the A4 is as it ever was: chock full of top-quality materials, excellent design, comfortable seats and great visibility. It does feature a very low driving position, which takes some getting used to in an era when what’s left of the sedans out there feature ever more upright, high-sitting driving positions. Front-seat comfort is good, but backseat space is rather tight in terms of leg and headroom, as is common in the compact sedan class. \n\nAs in other high-end luxury cars, you can adjust the interior ambient lighting from a calm, subtle glow all the way up to full-blast, “Tron”-style Lightcycle, depending on your taste and tolerance for such things. The digital gauge cluster is one of Audi’s better electronic features; the brand was one of the first to employ such technology across its range, and while it’s become a lot more common in competitors, Audi still makes sure it’s is one of the best out there with easy-to-read displays, an easy switch between display modes and an acceptable level of customization without information overload. \n\nCargo room isn’t the most important thing in a compact luxury sedan, but the A4 does all right here, too, with a 12-cubic-foot trunk, according to Audi. That’s more than the Genesis G70’s 10.5 cubic feet but less than the Acura TLX’s 13.5 cubic feet — and a lot less than the BMW 330i xDrive’s 17.0 cubic feet, though I suspect that figure may be a product of some sketchy measuring on BMW’s part. (This is why Cars.com has launched its own cargo-measuring effort, though we have yet to flesh out the A4’s class).\n\nPremium Digs at a Premium Price\n\nThe latest Audi A4 is the typical premium Audi experience. My test vehicle was an S Line version, which brings a lot of the exterior styling elements of the S4 performance sedan into the A4 line, with a few spiffs on the inside, as well. As is typical with a German luxury sedan, though, you can always have more upgrades if you’d like to spend a little more money.\n\nMy test car also featured the S Line interior package, which brought leather and Alcantara seats, aluminum inlay trim and stainless-steel pedals. It also had a Black Optic Package for the exterior, which adds 18-inch black wheels, black exterior trim and all-season tires (or, as in the case of my test car, 19-inch wheels running summer tires thanks to a further Black Optic wheel upgrade). The grand total for my highly optioned A4 came to $53,840 (including destination). That’s a hefty sum for a compact luxury sedan, but it’s by no means out of line with what competitors charge for their offerings. \n\nIn the end, Audi’s mild updates for 2021 continue the A4’s long-standing tradition of style, technology and comfort, offered up at a competitive price. We can only hope the next generation doesn’t go to a complete “glass cockpit” look that eliminates hard buttons in favor of touch panels — but I’m not really all that hopeful. If anything, that impending possibility makes this model look more appealing than ever. \n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Audi A4?\n\nAvailable as a four-door sedan or SUV-flavored Allroad wagon, the five-seat Audi A4 offers a generous range of standard features, a roomy cabin and a punchy turbocharged four-cylinder engine. All-wheel drive is standard on every A4, including the Allroad wagon and the performance-oriented S4 sedan. The standard turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder delivers 201 horsepower and comes paired with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. A 261-hp version of this engine is also available, and each utilizes a 12-volt mild-hybrid system to boost fuel economy. Want a little more get-up-and-go? The spicier S4 sedan is motivated by a 349-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 that’s paired with an eight-speed automatic. The A4’s rivals include the Genesis G70, Lexus IS, Mercedes-Benz C-Class and BMW 3 Series.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Audi A4?\n\nAll A4 trims get a host of new standard features, including adaptive cruise control, lane departure steering assist, parking assist and a heated steering wheel with hands-on detection. All trims except the base A4 40 now include remote start through the myAudi app. A Navigation Package that’s optional on the Premium Plus trim and standard on Prestige trims gets added functionality, including traffic sign recognition that activates predictive adaptive cruise control. Navigation-equipped models now come with a six-month trial subscription to Audi Connect Plus, making music, video, gaming, navigation and other apps accessible through the center screen. \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Audi A4 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nQuattro AWD\nLED headlights with high-beam assist\n10.1-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nLeather upholstery\nHeated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nAdaptive cruise control\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure warning\nLane departure steering assist\nParking assist \n\nAvailable features include:\n\nAudi Virtual Cockpit with 12.3-inch digital instrument panel\n360-degree camera system\nHead-up display\nNavigation\nBang & Olufsen stereo\nBlind spot warning\nShould I Buy the 2024 Audi A4?\n\nThe A4 isn’t the fastest or flashiest compact luxury sedan, but it’s definitely one of the most well rounded choices in a highly competitive field. Having AWD standard across the A4/Allroad/S4 lineup is a huge plus for car shoppers in areas where roads can turn slick with rain, snow or sleet. Both of the available turbocharged four-cylinder engines deliver peppy acceleration and return impressive fuel economy, too. The agile Allroad wagon is a savvy alternative to bulkier and thirstier SUVs, while the S4 is a suave and sophisticated means of getting where you’re going very quickly. The caveat with the S4 is a starting price that’s almost $13,000 more than a base A4 sedan.",

      "expert_review": "Most significant changes: A new screen and multimedia system inside, complete with a 10.1-inch touchscreen that sits high atop the redesigned center stack; Titanium Premium trim dropped, Premium Plus and Prestige trims added\n\nPrice changes: Unchanged on base front-wheel-drive Premium trim; all-wheel-drive Premium drops by $1,100\n\nOn sale: Now\n\nWhich should you buy, 2019 or 2020? A 2020 model to get the new screen and multimedia system for the same price\n\nThe 2020 Audi A4 gets a refresh that introduces changes of varying degrees to the compact luxury sports sedan. In an interesting wrinkle, the new equipment and styling don’t seem to have moved the base price — it holds fast at $38,395 (including a $995 destination fee, also unchanged) for the front-wheel-drive Premium version, while the first tier of all-wheel-drive Quattro models have actually dropped in price. This is rare in an automotive world where vehicles seem to add dollars to their bottom lines each year even without changes.\n\nRelated: 2020 Audi A4: Nipped ’N’ Tucked, New Touchscreen, Maybe Mild Hybrid\n\nAudi will tell you that “almost every piece of sheet metal on the exterior has been transformed,” but it doesn’t really feel like a transformation if you look at the 2020 model. Instead, it feels like a typical Audi restyling with a tweak here or there that you’ll notice only if you put the 2019 and 2020 next to each other. There are more prominent shoulder creases down the sides of the car and the grille has been embiggened. LED headlights are now standard, with Premium Plus trims adding an LED daytime running light signature. But overall, the A4’s profile remains much the same.\n\nChanges are more substantial inside, where the A4’s multimedia screen has been swapped out for a larger (and standard) 10.1-inch screen that sits in the same spot atop the dashboard. It has a new operating system, as well; Audi says that the guts of the system have been updated, and it now reacts 10 times faster and has sharper graphics than before. The look is familiar — the menu with square icons is similar to the system we’ve seen in other recently updated Audis such as the A6 and A7. But instead of a second lower touchscreen panel for climate controls and other functions (like the A6 and A7), there are physical controls that match the Audi Q3.\n\n2020 Audi A4 | Manufacturer image\n\nThis is a change we’re generally in favor of, especially for climate controls. But it appears that the A4 has inherited some of the Q3’s quirks, too, including a weird placement for the volume knob, which is tucked away on the passenger’s side of the gearshift. Thankfully, there are steering wheel controls to use because reaching the knob is not easy for the driver.\n\nThere are also a few more notable standard interior features for 2020: a power sunroof, heated eight-way power driver’s seat, sport seats for AWD-equipped models, tri-zone automatic climate control and ambient interior lighting. All of this makes the lack of a price increase even more confusing, especially on base models.\n\nThe rest of the car stands pat. While Europe gets six (six!) different powertrain options, including some mild-hybrid systems we had hoped to see make it over, it’s the same two gasoline options as 2019 in the U.S.: a 188-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder with FWD and a 248-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder with AWD. And yes, you read that right — it’s basically the same engine, just tuned up for use with Quattro AWD.\n\nIt seems like a no-brainer to go for the 2020 A4 due to the added standard equipment and larger screen, and I’d say that in most cases, it’s the route I’d recommend. The only exception that I can think of is if you got a massive discount on a 2019 model with a dealer that was trying to clear more inventory. Otherwise, newer is better.\n\nThe 2020 A4 is on sale now.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Audi A4?\n\nAvailable as a four-door sedan or SUV-flavored Allroad wagon, the five-seat Audi A4 offers a generous range of standard features, a roomy cabin and a punchy turbocharged four-cylinder engine. All-wheel drive is standard on every A4, including the Allroad wagon and the performance-oriented S4 sedan. The A4 sedan’s standard turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder delivers 201 horsepower and comes paired with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. A 261-hp version of this engine is available in the sedan and standard in the Allroad, but both versions use a 12-volt mild-hybrid system to boost fuel economy. Want a little more get up and go? The spicier S4 sedan is motivated by a 349-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 that’s paired with an eight-speed automatic. The A4’s rivals include the BMW 3 Series, Genesis G70, Lexus IS and Mercedes-Benz C-Class.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Audi A4?\n\nThe A4, A4 Allroad and S4 all see minor shuffling of standard and optional equipment for 2025. Also, Audi is phasing out the A4 sedan’s standard engine, leaving only the 261-hp version. The entire A4 lineup is slated to be discontinued after the 2025 model year, replaced by redesigned-for-2025 A5 and S5 liftback sedans.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Audi A4 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nQuattro AWD\nLED headlights with high-beam assist\n10.1-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nLeather upholstery\nHeated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nAdaptive cruise control\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure warning\nLane departure steering assist\nParking assist \n\nAvailable features include:\n\nAudi Virtual Cockpit with 12.3-inch digital instrument panel\n360-degree camera system\nHead-up display\nNavigation\nBang & Olufsen stereo\nBlind spot warning\nShould I Buy the 2025 Audi A4?\n\nThis generation of the A4 has a design that dates back to 2017, and while it isn’t the freshest contender in the luxury compact-car field, it’s still a well-rounded choice. Having AWD standard across the A4/Allroad/S4 lineup is a huge plus for car shoppers in areas where roads can turn slick with rain, snow or sleet. Both of the turbocharged four-cylinder engines deliver peppy acceleration, and they return impressive fuel economy, too. The agile Allroad wagon is a savvy alternative to bulkier and thirstier SUVs, while the S4 is a suave and sophisticated means of getting where you’re going quickly. A4 and S4 sedan shoppers might be better served by the redesigned A5 and S5, but if you fancy an A4 Allroad wagon, you’d best act quick; it’s being dropped after the 2025 model year with no direct replacement.",

      "expert_review": "Most significant changes: A new screen and multimedia system inside, complete with a 10.1-inch touchscreen that sits high atop the redesigned center stack; Titanium Premium trim dropped, Premium Plus and Prestige trims added\n\nPrice changes: Unchanged on base front-wheel-drive Premium trim; all-wheel-drive Premium drops by $1,100\n\nOn sale: Now\n\nWhich should you buy, 2019 or 2020? A 2020 model to get the new screen and multimedia system for the same price\n\nThe 2020 Audi A4 gets a refresh that introduces changes of varying degrees to the compact luxury sports sedan. In an interesting wrinkle, the new equipment and styling don’t seem to have moved the base price — it holds fast at $38,395 (including a $995 destination fee, also unchanged) for the front-wheel-drive Premium version, while the first tier of all-wheel-drive Quattro models have actually dropped in price. This is rare in an automotive world where vehicles seem to add dollars to their bottom lines each year even without changes.\n\nRelated: 2020 Audi A4: Nipped ’N’ Tucked, New Touchscreen, Maybe Mild Hybrid\n\nAudi will tell you that “almost every piece of sheet metal on the exterior has been transformed,” but it doesn’t really feel like a transformation if you look at the 2020 model. Instead, it feels like a typical Audi restyling with a tweak here or there that you’ll notice only if you put the 2019 and 2020 next to each other. There are more prominent shoulder creases down the sides of the car and the grille has been embiggened. LED headlights are now standard, with Premium Plus trims adding an LED daytime running light signature. But overall, the A4’s profile remains much the same.\n\nChanges are more substantial inside, where the A4’s multimedia screen has been swapped out for a larger (and standard) 10.1-inch screen that sits in the same spot atop the dashboard. It has a new operating system, as well; Audi says that the guts of the system have been updated, and it now reacts 10 times faster and has sharper graphics than before. The look is familiar — the menu with square icons is similar to the system we’ve seen in other recently updated Audis such as the A6 and A7. But instead of a second lower touchscreen panel for climate controls and other functions (like the A6 and A7), there are physical controls that match the Audi Q3.\n\n2020 Audi A4 | Manufacturer image\n\nThis is a change we’re generally in favor of, especially for climate controls. But it appears that the A4 has inherited some of the Q3’s quirks, too, including a weird placement for the volume knob, which is tucked away on the passenger’s side of the gearshift. Thankfully, there are steering wheel controls to use because reaching the knob is not easy for the driver.\n\nThere are also a few more notable standard interior features for 2020: a power sunroof, heated eight-way power driver’s seat, sport seats for AWD-equipped models, tri-zone automatic climate control and ambient interior lighting. All of this makes the lack of a price increase even more confusing, especially on base models.\n\nThe rest of the car stands pat. While Europe gets six (six!) different powertrain options, including some mild-hybrid systems we had hoped to see make it over, it’s the same two gasoline options as 2019 in the U.S.: a 188-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder with FWD and a 248-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder with AWD. And yes, you read that right — it’s basically the same engine, just tuned up for use with Quattro AWD.\n\nIt seems like a no-brainer to go for the 2020 A4 due to the added standard equipment and larger screen, and I’d say that in most cases, it’s the route I’d recommend. The only exception that I can think of is if you got a massive discount on a 2019 model with a dealer that was trying to clear more inventory. Otherwise, newer is better.\n\nThe 2020 A4 is on sale now.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "There is no question that Audi is back, competing head-on with Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Jaguar and Japan Inc. and winning. Audi’s U.S. sales have been increasing at double-digit rates for almost two years – that’s faster than any other automaker.\n\nThe latest model from Audi, the A4 1.8 T, should further accelerate the German automaker’s return to the mainstream.\n\nEarlier this year, I drove a six-cylinder version of the A4, and it’s still one of my favorite cars. But if your budget isn’t big enough to accommodate the V-6, the A4 with the 1.8-liter four-cylinder – this week’s test car – is a mighty fine alternative.\n\nPERFORMANCE, HANDLING\n\nThe 1.8-liter, in-line four-cylinder engine under the stylish hood of our A4 test car had five valves per cylinder and was bolted to a five-speed automatic transmission. Audi says the turbocharged engine develops 150 horsepower.\n\nThe A4, Audi says, reaches 60 mph in 9.8 seconds, which at first might not seem so quick. Initially, the A4 is a bit slow, but when the engine winds up, the car gets moving quickly. It feels as if zero to 30 mph takes about 6 seconds and 30 mph to 60 mph takes the other 3.8.\n\nAlthough it is turbocharged, the 1.8 T is very civilized. There is no violent rush of power as the turbo winds up. Instead, power comes on smoothly and evenly.\n\nOur test car came with Audi’s ”Quattro” option, which adds all-wheel drive. The five-speed automatic shifted smoothly, but the most efficient way to get power to the wheels is through a manual gearbox. Also, the all-wheel drive system added weight to the car and that also shaved a few ticks off the 0-to-60 mph time. If you want more performance without getting the optional V-6, the A4 with a standard transmission and sans the all-wheel drive would be the better choice. I contend that because of the lack of snow and slippery roads here, the Quattro all-wheel drive, a $1,600 option, is not needed in Florida. Fuel mileage was excellent. Our test car went 301 miles between fill-ups and averaged 26 mpg in city driving with the air conditioner on. That’s not bad, considering that I drove with a heavy foot for the better part of a week. Audi’s four-wheel independent suspension provides an excellent ride. The A4 is a bona fide sports sedan when equipped with its optional 2.8-liter V-6. But the four-cylinder engine makes the car more of a regular European sedan, which still is semi-sporty. The ride is firm, but not so much that it punishes you over bumpy roads. With the A4, you get the athletic feel of a BMW with the well-balanced manners of a Mercedes-Benz. The power-assisted rack-and-pinion steering system scores high for its weighted feel, crisp response and excellent 36-foot turning radius. Ditto for the four-wheel power-assisted anti-lock brakes, which stop the car quickly in emergency situations.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nThe A4 is deceptive in appearance. Judging by its size, you could be fooled into thinking the entry-level Audi’s a small car. True, it is classified as a compact, but there is ample room for five average-size passengers. With the rear seat folded forward, the car can easily carry large packages. The front bucket seats are firm, supportive and excellent on long trips. They adjust manually and are easy to configure. The tilting headrests, which can be adjusted for extra support, are a nice touch. The A4’sdash is attractive, nicely styled and laid out, and very easy to use. Bar graphs and large numbers in the lower center section of the dash display the air-conditioner fan speed and temperature. The system has an automatic setting so that you can dial in the temperature and then forget about it. The analog instruments, which have red needles and white numbers, are attractive and easy to read. The A4 feels as if it is sculpted from a single block of steel. As a result, parts fit closer together, and you won’t hear any squeaks or rattle .\n\nSpecifications: Base price: $22,990. Safety: Dual air bags, side-impact protection, front and rear crumple zones. Price as tested: $26,065. EPA rating: 20 mpg city/29 mpg highway. Incentives: None.\n\nTruett’s tip: Audi’s four-cylinder A4 handles well, looks great and offers excellent quality. The highly advanced, turbocharged engine provides decent zip.",

      "expert_review": "Practical people will find little value in the 2002 Audi A4 3.0 Avant wagon. It has less cargo space than the comparable Subaru Legacy GT AWD — 27.8 cubic feet for the A4 Avant vs. 34.3 for the Legacy.\n\nFive adults can find more seating comfort in the Legacy GT AWD than they can in the A4 Avant. The comment is based on personal experience. No passengers complained about rear-seating space during my recent test drive of the Legacy GT AWD. But whenever three people sat together in the rear seats of the A4 Avant, there inevitably was a gripe from at least one of them.\n\nOf course, there is also the matter of price. The A4 3.0 Avant has a base price of $34,140. The Legacy GT AWD wagon costs nearly $10,000 less.\n\nYet, Audi is selling every A4 3.0 Avant it can ship into the United States from its plant in Ingolstadt, Germany. There is no mystery here. Drive the Avant, and if you can afford it, you won’t want to drive anything else.\n\nTo put it another way, the people who are buying Avants aren’t buying station wagons. They’re buying dreams, entertainment, pleasure and possibilities. By emotional contrast, the people who are buying Legacy wagons are buying socially acceptable trucks.\n\nI side with the dreamers on this one.\n\nDriving is not a pedestrian experience to me. It is not a simple act of utility, of getting from one place to another, or hauling something from one place to another. Instead, it is an act of unmitigated fascination. I’m smitten by the idea of being able to get into a private car and choose a destination.\n\nIt is a sensual experience. Exceptional cars have a certain feel, a discernible tightness. Everything in such a car, such as the vinyl covering atop the instrument panel of the A4 Avant, has tactile superiority.\n\nThe way the car moves sends a message. The A4 Avant, for example, neither “takes” nor fights curves. Nor does it lose its composure in sharp turns. Instead, it adheres to them. Much of the credit here goes to the wagon’s suspension system. Audi lightened the load up front and improved the A4 Avant’s handling by installing a mostly aluminum four-link front suspension system.\n\nThe rear suspension is fully independent. When combined with the A4 Avant’s standard electronic stability and traction-control systems, the result is a remarkably sure-footed ride. For the driver, that means pleasure in the anticipation of any piece of road that isn’t a straightaway.\n\nOn another matter, someone with more technical expertise will have to point out the differences between the all-wheel-drive systems on the A4 Avant and the Legacy GT AWD. Both seem to work equally well on rain-slick roads. Neither system requires driver intervention. Both automatically transfer power from slipping to gripping wheels.\n\nBut when it comes to engines and transmissions, there is no real comparison. The A4 Avant is an easy winner. It is equipped with a 3-liter, double-overhead-cam V-6 that develops 220 horsepower at 6,300 revolutions per minute and 221 pound-feet of torque at 3,200 rpm.\n\nBy comparison, the Legacy GT AWD comes with a very decent, horizontally opposed 2.5-liter, four-cylinder engine that puts out 165 horsepower at 5,600 rpm and 166 pound-feet of torque at 4,000 rpm. There also is a 212-horsepower horizontally opposed V-6 available in the Legacy Outback all-wheel-drive wagon. The A4 Avant engine not only beats both Subaru engine’s in power but also outclasses them in quietness and smoothness.\n\nThe A4 Avant is available with a six-speed manual transmission or the tested five-speed Tiptronic (automatic/manual) gearbox. The Legacy GT AWD comes with a standard five-speed manual.\n\nIt is arguable that a better comparison to the A4 Avant wagon would be the BMW 325xi, the Lexus IS300, Mercedes-Benz C320 SportWagon, the Volvo V-70 or possibly the Saab 9-5 Aero. But that ar ument misses the point.\n\nThe point is that there are a number of less-expensive station wagons that are superior to those more expensive models in terms of overall utility and practicality (though the Saab 9-5 Aero is a formidable competitor in this category, too). The people who can afford to buy the A4 Avant can afford to buy the Legacy GT AWD. But they won’t do it. They are looking for joy, not hauling capacity.",

      "expert_review": "Even though the current version of the Audi A4 first hit dealerships all the way back in fall 2008, periodic updates make the 2013 A4 a lot more competitive than its vintage would suggest. It’s a textbook example of how an automaker can keep an older model fresh.\n\nBMW’s redesigned 3 Series will hold on to the perennial sport-sedan body-type spotlight, but the 2013 Audi A4 is an unfairly overlooked competitor.\n\nChief among the updates for 2013 are revisions to the car’s face, including redesigned headlights, and some functional changes inside (compare the 2013 and 2012 A4 here).\n\nThe Audi A4 now comes only as a sedan with a turbocharged four-cylinder engine; the related S4 has a supercharged V-6. Audi replaced the A4 Avant wagon by resurrecting the Audi Allroad nameplate — essentially an A4 Avant with better off-road chops. Read my review of the Allroad here, or compare the A4 and S4 here. This review focuses on the A4, which comes with FWD or AWD and a manual or automatic transmission. Compare them here.\n\nMite-Sized, but Mighty\nThe A4 puts Audi’s knack for turbo four-cylinder engines on display and goes to show that horsepower is only one part of the performance equation. The A4’s tiny, 2.0-liter four-cylinder and its 211 hp rating may seem meager, but a robust 258 pounds-feet of torque coming as low as 1,500 rpm mean the car scoots. I could leave our test car’s six-speed manual in 5th or 6th gear and hum along at 40 mph with enough power to ramp up speed as needed. Stand on the gas and the A4 rockets toward redline with no sign of power running out until the car’s rev limiter kicks in somewhere north of 6,000 rpm.\n\nAudi’s Quattro all-wheel-drive also impresses, sending 60 percent of power to the rear wheels under normal conditions. It can route as much as 85 percent to the rear for some tail-drifting action, and the turbo A4 displays better dynamics and less nose-heaviness than the V-6 A4 that was offered at the outset of this generation. The new electric power steering for 2013, which shaves scant weight over the nose versus the prior hydraulic setup, also can’t hurt. The A4 still lacks the outright driftability of a pure rear-drive sport sedan like the Infiniti G or BMW 3 Series, but it comes close enough for more casual enthusiasts.\n\nThe electric steering gets my thumbs-up. It still provides plenty of power assist at low speeds — long an Audi characteristic — where performance enthusiasts will probably find it too light. But the steering wheel firms up progressively as speed increases and responds with engaging feedback on curvy roads. A Driver Assist Package can adjust drivetrain and steering wheel response — including the steering ratio, not just power assist — to comfort or performance settings. Audi got the steering right enough, though; the package may not be necessary.\n\nOur test car had optional 18-inch alloy wheels and lower-profile tires, as well as a sport-tuned suspension. The sport suspension had a firm ride, with noticeable disruption over angled slabs of pavement and the like, but it soaked up expansion joints and small potholes well. This version is sort of a midlevel performer, falling between the suspension extremes: the base Audi A4’s standard suspension with cushier 17-inch tires and the S Line Plus Package with 19-inch tires and the sport suspension.\n\nEPA-estimated fuel economy with the manual is a respectable 22/32 mpg city/highway, but like some competitors, Audi requires premium gas. An 8-speed automatic is available on all-wheel-drive trim models, but it loses 2 mpg (20/30 mpg); front-wheel-drive cars have a continuously variable automatic transmission that gets 24/31 mpg.\n\nConsistent Materials\nAudi hasn’t blazed new trails for interior design in recent years, but the consistency of its quality is still an industry benchmark. From the door panels to the center console, cabin materials have an attractive, low-gloss finish. My longstanding complaints are nitpicks — Audi could throw more padding atop the doors or engineer heftier window switches. Overall, I’m still a fan.\n\nSpace is not an A4 strength. The backseat is tight, with a large floor hump stealing footwell space. Trunk volume, at just 12.4 cubic feet, matches the Mercedes-Benz C-Class but trails the G (13.5 cubic feet) and 3 Series sedans (13.0).\n\nFeatures, Pricing & Safety\nFor a starting price under $33,500, the Audi A4 Premium (base model trim) comes well-equipped, with standard features like genuine leather seats — not leatherette (vinyl) like many competitors throw in their base models — plus dual power seats, a moonroof and single-zone automatic climate control. It’s on the audio front that the other shoe drops: The standard stereo includes just a single-CD player and auxiliary jack. USB/iPod connectivity plus Bluetooth phone and audio streaming — features many non-luxury cars include standard — remain optional. Other options include dual-zone automatic climate control, the MMI navigation system, heated seats and a marvelous Bang & Olufsen stereo. Like most German sport sedans, the sky’s the limit with pricing; check all the factory options and the Audi A4 Premium Plus and Prestige trim packages can climb past $50,000.\n\nReliability for the A4 has been good, but that isn’t much of a differentiator. The 3 Series, C-Class, G37 and Lexus IS sedans are all fairly reliable, too. The A4 received Good scores in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s side-, rear-, roof-crush and traditional front crash tests, but it performed poorly — as did most of its peers — in IIHS’ new small-overlap frontal tests, which aim to replicate a frontal collision where the impact includes just 25 percent of the car (see the results here). The C-Class, IS, 3 Series and Acura TSX received Marginal or Poor scores, too; only the Infiniti G, Volvo S60 and Acura TL received Acceptable or Good scores.\n\nStandard features include six airbags plus the required antilock brakes and electronic stability system. Click here for a full list, or here to see our evaluation of child-seat provisions.\n\nA4 in the Market\nEven including sales of the related, two-door A5 and S5 — that’s how luxury rivals group their coupe, convertible and wagon versions — total sales for the A4-derived family rank near the Infiniti G but fall a long distance behind Audi’s German rivals. This car doesn’t deserve to be so far behind.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "With sales more than double any of its brand siblings, the Audi A4 entry-luxury sedan is effectively Audi’s ambassador in the U.S. The R8 supercar might grab more publicity, but the A4 is the car that average customers are most likely to encounter.\n\nAfter driving the sporty A4 with its refined interior, it’s clear that it’s not entry-level: it’s near the top of its class.\n\nI tested an A4 sedan with Quattro all-wheel drive and the new-for-2011 eight-speed automatic transmission. This version starts at $34,500, but with options our as-tested price reached $43,220.\n\nTurbocharged Power\n\nAudi has wrung quite a bit of performance from its turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder, which powers all versions of the A4. Whether accelerating from a stoplight or merging on the highway, the engine feels bigger than it is, bringing you up to speed more quickly than its specs suggest. There’s even a little power in reserve on the highway when a burst is needed. All in all, it feels just as strong as the BMW 328i with its inline-six-cylinder engine. Credit the turbo four-cylinder’s healthy 258 pounds-feet of torque at a low 1,500 rpm.\n\nOur test car had the newly optional eight-speed automatic transmission. Despite the high gear count, the transmission doesn’t seem overly busy, and that’s partly because of its relatively seamless shifts. However, one editor noted that the transmission had a tendency to hesitate under light acceleration.\n\nDownshifts come quickly enough with a jab of the gas pedal. If it needs to, the transmission will skip a few gears to get to the one it needs, rather than step down one at a time. A Sport mode holds the transmission in lower gears longer, and there’s a clutchless-manual mode for driver-controlled shifts.\n\nThe A4 gets better gas mileage with the new transmission, which is especially welcome because the car requires premium gas. The all-wheel-drive A4 is rated at 21/29 mpg city/highway with the eight-speed automatic, which represents a 2 mpg improvement in highway fuel economy compared with the six-speed 2010 model. Meanwhile, the front-wheel-drive A4 with a continuously variable automatic transmission gets an EPA-estimated 22/30 mpg.\n\nThe A4’s four-wheel disc brakes quickly shed speed, but the brake pedal doesn’t offer the greatest feel. I thought the brakes were a little grabby, while another editor commented on the lack of pedal linearity when braking.\n\nRide & Handling\n\nThe A4’s regular suspension (a Sport suspension is optional) is stiff, which keeps body roll in check, but the tuning isn’t so firm that driving on rough pavement is jarring. There’s no question the emphasis is on sporty driving, but Audi wisely realizes that a car like the A4 also has to keep its occupants comfortable during daily commutes. With the regular suspension, it does.\n\nIt’s worth noting that our test car had winter tires. While appropriate for the conditions, they likely affected the car’s character compared with the all-season tires it normally wears. Winter tires have softer rubber compounds for better grip in cold weather — along with more aggressive tread patterns — which affects handling, acceleration and road-noise levels, among other things.\n\nWhile the firm suspension tuning is common among German luxury cars, the steering feels like it’s been sourced from Lexus. At low and midrange speeds, the wheel turns easily and with little effort. Unfortunately, there’s also little feedback. However, a pronounced change occurs when you reach highway speeds, where the steering firms up and feels sharper.\n\nThe A4’s Quattro all-wheel-drive system features rear-biased torque distribution for improved dynamics. Even though it powers out of corners without feeling nose-heavy, it’s still not as engaging as a rear-wheel-drive BMW 3 Series or Infiniti G37.\n\nA Classy Cabin\n\nAudi cabin quality has long been among the best in the industry, and the A4’s interior continues that trend. What distinguishes Audi interiors isn’t just the use of high-quality materials, like real aluminum accents, but also the finish of the various trim pieces and the way they fit together well. Then you have the little touches, like a center armrest that not only slides forward and back, but also ratchets up and down.\n\nIn the past few years we’ve seen more attention to interior quality from brands like Cadillac (with its CTS) and Infiniti (with the G37), but the A4’s cabin remains one of the nicest spaces in the class.\n\nThe front bucket seats are finished in standard leather upholstery. By comparison, many competitors like the 3 Series, Mercedes-Benz C-Class and CTS make do with simulated leather upholstery in base models. The A4’s firm seat cushions provide good support and comfort, and the front of the cabin is big enough for my 6-foot-1 frame.\n\nThe backseat, though, is a little cramped. Just getting into it is difficult for taller adults, because the door opening isn’t very large. Once seated, I didn’t have much room to spare with the driver’s seat adjusted for me, though indentations in the backs of the front seats provide some extra knee clearance. Taller people sit with their knees elevated some, which doesn’t bode well for long-drive comfort. Still, it’s more comfortable than the backseat of a 3 Series sedan.\n\nThe A4’s trunk measures 12 cubic feet, which is similar to what competitors offer. The trunk has a nice rectangular shape for fitting luggage, and the split-folding backseat — previously standard but now optional like it is on the 3 Series and C-Class — creates a sizable opening for carrying longer items. \n\nSafety\n\nThe A4 was recognized as a 2011 Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. It received the highest possible overall score from IIHS — Good — in frontal-offset, side-impact, roof-strength and rear-impact testing.\n\nStandard safety features include antilock brakes, side-impact airbags for the front seats, side curtain airbags for both rows of seats, and an electronic stability system. Rear-seat side-impact airbags are optional.\n\nFor a full list of safety features, check out the Standard Equipment & Specs page.\n\nA4 in the Market\n\nOne of the A4’s biggest strengths is that it appeals to luxury shoppers in a number of ways. If you’re concerned about gas mileage, it’s comparatively thrifty. If you like fine furnishings, the cabin will feel like home. Plus, there are a number of available high-end features to interest technophiles. It may not offer the pure driving experience of a 3 Series, but in the areas that matter most in this part of the luxury segment, the entry-level A4 stands tall.\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "Don’t think that just because we gave the 2001 Audi A4 1.8 T high marks we had nothing to argue about. After all, everything triggers heated discussion in our household, from Scrabble game rules to choice of breakfast cereal. So it was with the admirable German sedan with a $27,440 price tag. The Audi we tested also came with the optional $1,750 quattro all-wheel-drive system. The main bone of contention: Is the Audi a luxury car – or just a really terrific all-season performer?\n\nShe: I’m going to argue that the A4 – even the version we tested with cloth seat upholstery – could give Lexus, Infiniti and other luxury brands some serious competition. To me, it’s every bit as satisfying as an entry-level BMW. It’s beautifully crafted with a long list of standard features, including a CD player, cruise control and a leather-wrapped steering wheel. And no, I’m not turning into a Stepford wife.\n\nHe: You mean Stepford frau, my little dumpling? Get it through your head, honey. This is NOT a luxury car. It’s a cool German sport sedan with a great pedigree, impeccable manners and killer performance. And, for the price, I think it’s a bargain. My biggest problem with the A4, as it was with the Audi TT, is that I don’t fit very well in it.\n\nShe: And you’re calling ME a dumpling?\n\nHe: Isn’t that turbocharged, 20-valve 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine great? It makes 170 horsepower, which is up 20 from a year ago, but more importantly Audi has tuned the engine so that the boost kicks in at relatively low engine RPMs. That means the boost comes on quickly, with the net result being this engine feels much more like a V-6, with very little perceptible throttle lag. Know what I mean?\n\nShe: Huh? I’m obsessed with the A4’s standard first-aid kit and I wasn’t paying any attention to you. The kit is stashed in the rear seat center console and it’s amazing. It looks like you could perform surgery with it and it apparently even has a little warming blanket for shock victims. But it’s hard to tell, because all the instructions are in German. That’s kind of a surprising oversight for those detail-oriented Germans, isn’t it?\n\nHe: But totally Germanic. I love the fact that you can get a car with this kind of performance plus all-wheel drive for well under $30,000. And Audi’s Quattro system is so nice because, unless you look at the badging, you’d be hard pressed to tell. It doesn’t feel clunky or heavy or obtrusive in any way. It’s just a great feature that gives you enhanced traction in crummy weather and on all kinds of pavement. The A4 also has an impressive list of safety features.\n\nShe: The A4’s greatest strengths are styling and safety, if you ask me. Granted, Audi didn’t do much this year to change the exterior of the A4. And they didn’t have to. The styling is understated and attractive to being with. They did add one or two new design touches, like a three-spoke leather steering wheel. But one of the be st new features is a standard side air curtain system that protects the heads of front and rear seat passengers in a side impact. Audi also upgraded its warranty to four-years or 50,000 miles for 2001. Now if that isn’t a luxury touch, what is?\n\nHe: You mentioned styling. The company is just introducing a redesigned A4 in Europe, and we should get it this fall as a 2002 model. In the meantime, I would imagine you could swing a pretty good deal at your local Audi dealer for the current A4. It’s cheaper than a BMW 325i or a Mercedes-Benz C-class, and I think it’s lots more fun to drive than the other two Germans. There’s really nothing else quite like it from Detroit or Tokyo, either.\n\nShe: In the meantime, I’d recommend the $600 cold weather package we had on our test Audi. It comes with heated front seats, heated driver door lock and an expandable ski/storage sack that’s stashed in the rear center console. Well worth the money, especially in Michigan in January.\n\nHe: So, have you decided? Is it the heated seats or the ski sack that makes this a luxury car?\n\nAnita’s rating: World class\n\nPaul’s rating: Above average\n\nLikes: Four-wheel drive provides terrific all-weather traction. Great safety features, including side air bags and air curtains. Styling is understated, but attractive. Turbocharged engine is lots of fun to drive.\n\nDislikes: Long-legged drivers will find front seat cramped. Not much leg room in rear either. Not easy to reach back of too-deep trunk. Standard first-aid kit is in German. Manually adjustable driver’s seat is confusing and difficult to operate.\n\nType: Front-engine, all-wheel drive, five-passenger sedan.\n\nPrice: Base, $24,540; as tested, $27,440 (inc. $550 destination charge).\n\nEngine: 1.8-liter I-4; 170-hp; 166 lb-ft torque.\n\nEPA fuel economy: 23 mpg city/32 mpg highway.\n\n12-month insurance cost, according to AAA Michigan*: $1,155 (Estimate. Rates may be higher or lower, depending on coverage and driving record.)\n\nWhere built: Germany",

      "expert_review": "Some cars are made for sunny days. And some make the day sunny, no matter the weather.\n\nExhibit A: the A4 Cabriolet.\n\nAudi already had a great thing in its 2002 redesigned A4. The subtle lines, the flowing interior, the fun stuff under the hood.\n\nThey didn’t need to go topless to make it great. That they did might just raise the bar on a car that was already a Car & Driver Top 10. But not for the reasons you might think.\n\nThe beauty of the 2003 A4 Cabriolet is not that it can have its top dropped, but that it doesn’t have to in order to be great.\n\nConvertibles are strange animals. They’re loved on days when it’s 70 degrees and sunny. They are loathed on days that are anything but 70 and sunny. Too cold in the winter, too unstable when it’s windy and too susceptible to the elements, convertibles suffer when the conditions aren’t just right. Until now.\n\nI drove the A4 for 400 miles during a very top-up February week of pure Midwest winter. Ice, snow and cold. Awful for a new A4 that is designed for brighter days? On the contrary.\n\nIn the age of multi-use crossover vehicles, this is the crossover I can live with – a car for all seasons. Top up or down, the A4 blends the best of both worlds. Stunning looks, aggressive power, graceful appointments – oh, and a top that can go down if need be, but that you can live with if Mother Nature says you can’t.\n\nMaybe the A4 was destined for good things from the start. It begins by sharing its platform with the larger Audi A6 and Volkswagen Passat – both good folks to follow. It builds from there.\n\nUnder the hood, the A4 offers a choice of either a 170-horsepower 1.8-liter turbo four-cylinder engine or a 220-horse, 3-liter V-6.\n\nThe A4 comes with an available four-cylinder in front or all-wheel-drive Quattro. A five-speed manual is standard on the four-cylinder, and a six-speed is standard on the 3-liter Quattro. A five-speed automatic is optional on all models except the front-wheel-drive V-6, which comes with a Multitronic automatic transmission.\n\nOur new Cabriolet comes one way, as a 3-liter front-wheel-drive with the Multitronic transmission.\n\nThe driveline is key. It’s here where Audi really separates itself from the pack. The Cabriolet arrives with a meaty setup that delivers a lot of punch and push. Step on the accelerator and watch the RPMs fly as the world flies by. With power distributed directly to the front wheels, the Cabriolet blasts out of the gate, without too much torque steer – that tug on the front wheels that usually happens when too much pressure is sent in that direction.\n\nIt handles corners without much roll and weaves in and out of traffic with a sports car’s demeanor. Not quite a BMW, but balanced enough to know you are getting your money’s worth. The ride is very European – firm and sporty, which means you can feel most bumps in the road, which is all by design. The tr ansmission helps smooth out the rough edges, although I can’t say it’s my favorite choice.\n\nKnown as Multitronic in Audi lingo, it is the brand’s version of a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT), or a constantly varying gear ratio. What does that mean? No need to worry about five gear ratios or a traditional five-speed automatic. It is a smooth transition from one gear to the next – never downshifting or upshifting – and always allowing the engine to run at just the right level.\n\nMy problem with CVTs in general is that you lose the sensation of pushing a car to its limit. The transmission is always searching for the optimum gear, rather than you deciding what you’d like. But that doesn’t mean it won’t work for everyone.\n\nCombined with the V-6, the CVT really is silky smooth. And it helps fuel economy. Even though the Cabriolet is heavier than the A4 sedan, even without the gas-sucking problems of the Quattro, it manages to get 20 mpg in the city and 27 the highway. That means plenty of good cruising.\n\nInside the cabin, the Cabriolet was ultra quiet and very smooth. No wild wind buffeting or loud highway rides. Cold air was kept out. Heat was kept in. Around the cabin, there are plenty of Audi’s signature comforts – brushed metal, wood and leather. Standard features include supportive 12-way front bucket seats with lumbar, a classy instrument panel and Audi’s signature items: Bose stereo with a six-disc changer, power windows, locks and mirrors, as well as heated outside mirrors.\n\nOne drawback: Audi says you can put four people into the seats. But a quick glance at the back and it’s easy to see no one over age 8 is going to enjoy a ride back there. It’s easily a place better suited for an overnight bag, or anything you can’t fit in the 10 cubic feet of trunk room (not bad for its class).\n\nThe ragtop is anything but a flap-in-the-breeze roof. With triple thickness and a glass rear window, it ranks on the luxury side of the convertible line. Raising and lowering it is done with the touch of a button and takes about 25 seconds. When in place, it’s a perfect blend of form and function. From the street you’d have a tough time figuring this was a convertible. Which brings me back to the point of multi-use.\n\nIn any season, in any climate, the A4 works. It is a sedan. It is a convertible. It is all the above.\n\nOn safety, no need to worry whether Audi has scrimped. Like all Audis, the Cabriolet is loaded. There’s an electronic stability program to help keep things in control, four-wheel disc brakes with anti-lock, brake assist to prevent skidding, dual front and side airbags, a reinforced windshield and pop-up rollover posts behind the rear seats.\n\nWhere you might have to scrimp is on the extras in your life.\n\nAt $46,735 (including heated leather seats, a premium package and 17-inch wheels), this is not a cheap convertible thrill. But where it is positioned is right around a BMW 3-Series but below its Mercedes-Benz SLK, Volvo and Saab competitors. That’s heady competition for an automaker moving up against the other Germans.\n\nIs it there? It’s close.\n\nI didn’t have many qualms with the A4. It would be nice to have the option of a five- or six-speed transmission and Quattro – Audi says both are on the way this spring. And while it doesn’t have the same growl or attitude of a BMW or the refinement of a Benz, it certainly is knocking at the door.\n\nIn the market for a car for all seasons?\n\nIt’s worth a look. Even in mid-March.\n\nRating: 3.5\n\nHigh Gear: A stylish interior and exterior, along with sharp handling and a solid ride make the convertible version of the A4 an even sunnier proposition – even if it’s not sunny.\n\nLow Gear: Price gets to be an issue in the mid-40s and low-end torque could be a bit more beefy. Also, forget the back seats; this is a two-seater.\n\nVehicle type: Front-wheel-drive, front-engine, two-door, four-passenger convertible.\n\nKey standard equipment: Power retractable cloth top with heated glass rear window; automatic dual-zone climate control; power windows, locks and mirrors; electronic cruise control; front and side airbags; 12-way adjustable front seats; continuously variable transmission; four-wheel antilock disc brakes; AM/FM CD stereo; keyless entry; security alarm system; tilt steering.\n\nKey competition: BMW 3-Series, Mercedes-Benz SLK, Saab 9-3, Volvo C70, Ford Thunderbird\n\nBase engine: 220 horsepower, 3-liter, DOHC V-6\n\nTorque: 221 foot-lbs. @ 3,200 rpm\n\nWheelbase: 104.5 inches\n\nLength: 180 inches\n\nMPG rating: 20 mpg city/27 mpg highway\n\nManufactured: Rheine, Germany\n\nWarranty: Basic warranty is four years/50,000 miles; the drivetrain is four years/50,000 miles; body corrosion is 12 years/unlimited miles; roadside assistance is four years/unlimited miles.\n\nBase price: $41,500\n\nPrice as tested (including options, destination and delivery): $46,735",

      "expert_review": "Small, luxurious European sport wagons are a unique breed, targeted at buyers who want sports-sedan performance and the functionality of a sport-utility vehicle. Some folks think they look dowdy, but I like them because they combine fun-to-drive character with load-carrying practicality.\n\nAudi’s A4 Avant is an excellent case in point. This vivacious, compact wagon has the vigor of 190-horsepower sedan and the all-weather mobility of an SUV when it’s equipped with the quattro all-wheel-drive system. Its small size makes it maneuverable, yet its station wagon profile creates enough cargo space to be handy for those with an active lifestyle. No, you can’t carry home sheets of plywood from the lumber yard, but if you need space for your camping gear, or have to carry a bunch of soccer balls to the kid’s practice, there’s ample space.\n\nFolding down the back seat doubles the cargo space to 63.7 cubic feet. A retractable luggage cover shields items from prying eyes but it has to be removed when the seat is collapsed. A luggage net keeps small items from rolling around, which is handy.\n\nSince it is built on a 103-inch wheelbase, the Avant sacrifices a little rear-seat legroom to retain its compact dimensions.\n\nThe 2.8-liter engine has dual-overhead-cams, five valves per cylinder and pumps out its maximum torque, or pulling power, at 3,200 rpm. The manual transmission lets the driver get the most out of the 190-horsepower V6, and because the quattro system splits power equally between front and rear wheels it even improves the car’s balance in dry cornering.\n\nFor $1,075, the five-speed Tiptronic automatic transmission can be added as an option. Tiptronic has both manual and automatic modes, which means it offers the best of both worlds.\n\nThe Avant is also available with the automatic transmission and front-wheel-drive. This combo does have FrontTrak, an all-speed traction control system that should give it exceptional stability in slippery weather.\n\nBrakes are strong and powerful, with anti-lock standard across the board.\n\nAside from its tailored styling, the most notable thing about the Avant is its high-energy personality. The five-valve engine was added midway through last year, and it changed the car’s character considerably. It feels more robust, and it lunges away from stops with much more enthusiasm than in the past. On the open road it cruises quietly and smoothly, free of vibration and fussiness. Without the usual clues of wind and road noise, you will find yourself cruising along faster than you expect.\n\nInside, our test car’s off-white leather seats made the cabin look open and airy, while the dark-blue dash and door panels added a feeling of richness and elegance. Walnut wood trim on the dash, console and door panels was a nice counterpoint.\n\nBefitting a car in this class, creature comforts such as power windows and mirrors, automatic climate control, keyless entry, cruise control and AM//FM stereo are standard . Options include heated seats, leather upholstery, a one-touch power sunroof and a sport package of seven-spoke alloy wheels, tighter suspension and sport steering wheel.\n\nOur test car had both the sport package and leather upholstery. In tpyical German fashion, the front seats were firm, yet you could spend hours there and not be uncomfortable. I struggled to find a comfortable seating position initially because I felt as if I was sitting down too low. When I raised the bottom cushion it tipped too far forward for my taste. I finally settled down after fidgeting like a kindergartner on the first day of school, and the driving position was just fine. The center armrest is a good place to rest your elbow.\n\nThe 60//40 folding back seat has a center headrest and shoulder belts for three.\n\nThe seats in the A6, Passat and New Beetle all use a different height adjuster, and it is better.\n\nHandling is agile and responsive. The ride is reasonably firm, yet even with the sport pac ge of 16-inch alloy wheels and high-performance tires it remains compliant. Bend it into a turn, and the A4 grips the pavement as only an all-wheel-drive car can. Quattro is especially effective if the pavement is wet or greasy.\n\nIf you like the sport wagon concept but still think the A4 is too small for your needs, Audi’s A6 Avant will be available soon. Volkswagen’s new Passat wagon is just now coming into showrooms, and it shares many of the A4’s parts and pieces.\n\nPrice\nThe base price of our test car was $31,040. It was equipped with options of leather upholstery, Sport package (16-inch alloy wheels, sport suspension, sport steering wheel), heated front seats and trip computer.\n\nThe sticker price was $35,740.\n\nWarranty\nThe basic warranty is for three years or 50,000 miles. All scheduled maintenance for three years or 50,000 miles is included at no charge.\n\nPoint: Especially when it is equipped with the quattro all-wheel-drive system, the Avant marries SUV practicality with European sedan handling in a package that is both handsome and understated.\n\nCounterpoint: The Avant has a couple of limitations relative to its size: back-seat legroom is snug and ditto its cargo capacity.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\nENGINE: 2.8-liter, V6\nTRANSMISSION: Five-speed\nWHEELBASE: 103 inches\nCURB WEIGHT: 3,428 lbs.\nBASE PRICE: $31,040\nPRICE AS DRIVEN: $35,740\nMPG RATING: 19 city, 27 hwy.",

      "expert_review": "So even if you want a luxury car, you might think twice, since most of these vehicles not only require premium fuel, but also drink it down faster than a college student on a bender.\n\nBut there are alternatives, and I’m not talking about a Vespa scooter.\n\nHow about an Audi A4? Specifically what Audi calls the ”Audi A4 Sedan 2.0 T FrontTrak CVT.”\n\nIn English, that translates to an A4 equipped with a 2-liter turbocharged four-cylinder with front-wheel-drive and a continuously variable transmission.\n\nWhat’s the big deal? This number: 27.4 mpg. That’s not bad for a luxury ride whose performance, handling and accommodations compare well against such rivals as BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Cadillac.\n\nThe A4 was all-new midway through 2005. The most noticeable thing about it is the large grille, which looks suspiciously like a large, open-mouthed bass rendered in a post-modern abstraction.\n\nIt takes some getting used to. Styling is a personal thing, and, well, I never was a fisherman.\n\nOn the other hand, the A4 is a real sweetheart of a car that comes in many guises. This includes a choice of front- or all-wheel-drive, four engines, three transmissions and two body styles (sedan or convertible coupe.)\n\nAudi provided a vehicle whose basic drivetrain is at the bottom end of the scale, but equipped it opulently.\n\nThis includes a gas-saving transmission that constantly varies the gear ratios rather than sticking to standard five, six or seven preset gears.\n\nThe A4 also had the $3,000 ”S-Line Package” that adds a sports suspension, 18-inch performance tires, and S-Line trim.\n\nThere also was a $1,950 navigation system, $1,850 ”Premium Package” (auto-dimming mirrors, compass, rain-sensing wipers, heated front seats, power passenger seat and built-in garage door openers), $1,775 ”Technology Package” (high-intensity headlamps, adaptive lighting, memory seats and mirrors, trip computer and phone prep), $1,400 ”Sunroof Package” (a sunroof and leather seating surfaces), and a $400 Cold Weather Package (ski sack and heated rear seats).\n\nXM Satellite radio added another $350. This made the affordable $27,840 base price balloon to $40,760.\n\nBut the car’s drivetrain is a mere turbocharged double-overhead-cam four mated to a CVT transmission.\n\nIt packs plenty of power, along with plenty of vibration at idle. Still, it feels like there’s more than 200 horses under your right loafer, and the CVT can be shifted manually, although I don’t know why you’d bother.\n\nJust opt for one of the six-speed manuals instead. Sure, the 3.2-liter six-cylinder will be more refined than the four, but you’ll never see the gas mileage that this car returned.\n\nDrive it like your grandmother and you might even see 30 mpg in mixed driving. (Note: Don’t drive like my grandmother _ she drove fast.)\n\nThe ”S-Line” adds a healthy firmness to this car that any German car lover can appreciate.\n\nCornering behavior is exemplary, with flat cornering characteristics and the firm stance Audi fans have come to appreciate. But try the seats before you buy, you might find them confining and a bit firm.\n\nAs for the electronics, well, it’s the usual user-unfriendly German-car mishmash of buttons, menus and sub-menus, although Audi’s screen seems a little easier to navigate than BMW’s, but not as easy as a Mercedes-Benz’s.\n\nThe audio system was every bit as good as you’d expect. XM makes it even better. If you’re a music fan, this will be your favorite option.\n\nThe only option that took some getting used to was the adaptive headlamps, in which the headlamps turn in the direction of the front wheels. Driving down a curvy back road at night is a bit unnerving, as the headlamps dart from one direction to another. Not a bad idea, but not one I’d pay a whole lot of money for, either.\n\nWhat made this Audi so surprising was that I drove it the same week I drove a VW on steroids, the Bentley Continental GT.\n\nWhile the A4 was no Bentley, there was enough of a familial feel, that climbing into the A4 after spending a weekend in the Bentley didn’t seem like such a bad thing. Whatever I missed in the Bentley was mitigated by the difference in fuel consumption.\n\nSo the A4, at least in 2-liter turbo form, gives its owner a European car, with all the manners the title implies, along with a heavy dose of comfort, convenience and fuel economy that outdoes many of its Asian competitors.\n\nSo even if the MSRP might pinch the purse, keeping an A4 fed will not.",

      "expert_review": "If you’ve ever watched TLC’s “What Not to Wear” you’re familiar with their “Mom-on-the-Go” look, and if the show’s fashionistas Stacy London and Clinton Kelly could pick out a car for the well-dressed mom on the go, it would be the 2010 Audi A4 Avant. This wagon is one classy ride; it’s elegant and quietly powerful, with some well-placed accessories and sparkle. If only my wardrobe was as put together as this car.\n\nI’m warming to the idea of wagons now that they aren’t those enormous, hideous boats of my youth, with faux-wood paneling and their own ZIP codes. The Audi A4 Avant is none of those things. It’s not measurably larger than its sedan counterpart, and it has all the style and driving joy of the sedan, with some added function thrown in. The A4 Avant starts at $35,350, and my test car cost $44,100. I love driving a car that’s fun, fast and great looking, while still being able to haul sports equipment, bikes or dogs.\n\nAnd driving the A4 Avant is fun. The turbocharged 2.0-liter engine gives it plenty of zoom to get the errands done in the nanosecond of time between dropping the kids off at school and picking them up again. In fact, there was enough power that I had to lay off the gas a bit, as I might have caused the car to make an unseemly squeal when accelerating. Turns and corners were smooth and solid, even in wet weather, thanks to Audi’s Quattro all-wheel drive. The entire driving experience was refined and elegant, but never boring. Stacy and Clinton would be so proud.\n\nEXTERIOR\nIn the same way that a structured jacket and tasteful accessories can make an outfit, clean lines and just the right amount of sparkle make the A4 Avant a style icon. Everywhere I took the A4 Avant, people commented on it. It was generally agreed that this wagon is a looker.\n\nFor me, the appeal starts with the A4’s available LED running lights and taillights. I absolutely loved the dip and curve of those tiny LEDs under the available xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights. At night, especially, those lights are just sexy. I also liked the subtle sculpting on the hood and along the side panels. It’s nothing particularly bold or outrageous, but those lines add a bit of interest and movement to the larger planes of the body.\n\nPart of what keeps the A4 Avant from looking like those uber-wagons of olden days is its sleek profile. Rather than a long, boxy roofline, this wagon is gently rounded, from the slope of the windshield to the echoing slope of the rear window. In the rear, the A4 Avant is a bit more wagon-y, but there’s only so much that can be done there. It’s enormous rear window provides really excellent visibility. It makes the backup camera and parking sensors almost unnecessary. Almost. My test car had a panoramic sunroof that extended over both rows and brought in tons of light and a feeling of spaciousness.\n\nThis isn’t a car that’s trying to get by on its good looks. It’s 211-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder gets an EPA-estimated 21/27 mpg city/highway. Although I didn’t have to hit the gas pump too often, I did have to shell out more money for its premium gas.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Excellent\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove On): Groove On\n\nINTERIOR\nThey say that black is slimming, and Audi seems to have taken that message to heart with their interior in the A4 Avant. The interior of my test car was, um, black. The seats are black. The dash is black. The carpet is black. If it weren’t for all the light from the windows and panoramic sunroof, the black interior would have been oppressive, but somehow, the A4 manages to stay just this side of funereal. That’s because of the aluminum trim on the steering wheel, over the glove box, and around the vents and center console. Those subtle reflections brighten up the cockpit considerably. The red and white colors of the gauges and information screens are sporty, easy to read and add a much-needed dash of color.\n\nI enjoyed the heated leather sport seats in this five-seater. They’re a bit firmer than the regular seats, but have great support and manage not to be difficult to climb in or out of. My test car came equipped with the Sport Package, which included a three-spoke steering wheel with perforated leather grips that felt terrific underhand. The steering wheel also had controls for the audio system and Bluetooth, which was crystal clear and easy to connect.\n\nAudi’s MMI system wraps all the audio, navigation and information functions into a knob controller. Twist the knob to navigate the information screen and push it down to select an item. It’s that easy. Four function buttons surround the knob and their function changes depending on the MMI screen that’s being used. MMI has a little learning curve to it, but it quickly becomes second nature. What I really liked about this system is the driver doesn’t need to look away from the road to hunt for one of countless buttons/wheels/knobs; everything is in one place.\n\nIn the backseat, my kiddos were content and did their best to filthy up the place, which was when I began to see the blessing of black carpet. Sure, it shows every blade of muddy grass their baseball cleats drag in, but that goes away with a quick pass of a vacuum. What you don’t see is the dirt or food or wet who-knows-what that’s so painfully apparent on lighter carpets. The lesson? It’s impossible to stain black carpet, not for lack of trying on my boys’ parts.\n\nIf I were to ask for anything more from the A4 Avant, it’d be interior storage. The center console has a small bin that can hold chargers and a lip balm, but not much more. I managed to stuff a pack of baby wipes in the door bin, but there really wasn’t anywhere good to hide all the stuff I usually haul around in a car. I guess that’s European minimalist style. At least it had cupholders. There are two in the front row and two in the rear armrest, which also has a small storage compartment, and a bottle-holder in every door.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSAFETY\nThe A4 Avant’s safety features start with its Quattro system, a full-time all-wheel-drive system, with rear-torque bias. Under this system, power is supplied to all the wheels, but automatically directed to the ones with the most traction, which really helps in slippery conditions. Under normal circumstances, the rear-torque bias means the rear wheels get most of the power, creating a sportier driving experience.\n\nThe A4 Avant also comes with four-wheel antilock brakes with brake assist, stability control and traction control. It has six airbags, including front- and side-impact airbags for the front row and side curtain airbags for both rows. Rear side-impact airbags for the backseat are available and cost $350.\n\nThere’s plenty of legroom in the back for adults or massive rear-facing infant-safety seats. Thankfully, the rear seats are mostly flat, so booster seats sit nicely without tilting or sliding over the seat belt receptors, which are also nice and firm. The two sets of Latch connectors should make Audi a favorite of parents everywhere. They’re — wait for it — visible to the eye. They sit beneath a plastic cover that pops off easily, and the Latch connector is out there in plain view. Amazing, right? No hunting, digging, scraped knuckles or broken nails.",

      "expert_review": "OK, it’s confession time. I need to get something off my chest, something that some people might find strange and confusing.\n\nHere it is:\n\nI dig station wagons.\n\nThat’s not just a condition of middle age, though practicality certainly looms larger these days than it used to. No, I’ve always liked station wagons, have owned several of them, and just think they’re kind of cool.\n\nWeird, huh?\n\nI’m not talking about behemoth nine-passenger wagons of yore, but trim, compact wagons. And these days, some of the best wagons are being made in Europe, where square backs are enjoying a resurgence.\n\nVolvo long has been the king of station wagons, but sporty BMW currently markets its Touring wagon for the horsy set, and Saab has just added a wagon to its latest lineup.\n\nNow comes Audi, fresh on the upswing with its fine new trio of sedans, A4, A6 and A8. This is a car company that has returned from purgatory, shrugging off the bogus “unintended acceleration” fiasco of the ’80s and a mediocre product line, and bringing out a collection of vehicles of character and excellent road manners.\n\nThe handsome, driveable and even affordable A4 1.8 T Avant (e.g, station wagon) was a road-test car that I really wanted to keep. It’s the kind of station wagon that makes me dig station wagons. Audi calls it a sport wagon, which might seem like an oxymoron until you get behind the wheel.\n\nThe little Avant drives and handles. Equipped with a five-speed stick shift and a surprisingly strong 1.8-liter turbocharged four, it scoots like a sports car. Sounds like one, too. Audi says it will go zero to 60 mph in 8.5 seconds, with the manual gearbox, which is pretty quick for a station wagon.\n\nThis four is also smooth and quiet, with only a bit of four-cylinder boominess evident under hard acceleration. It does get a bit weak in the knees at low rpm, but not as bad as some other turbos. Shifting is smooth and precise.\n\nThe A4 Avant also is available with a 2.8-liter V-6, at a slightly higher price. A five-speed also is available with the six, a rarity in this market, especially in a station wagon.\n\nHandling and cornering have the kind of Germanic poise and precision that driving enthusiasts crave. Steering response is quick, the ride is firm and athletic, and the body feels stiff and tight. A twisting back road becomes a romp.\n\nThe test car also was equipped with Audi’s famed Quattro system, one of the first all-wheel-drive setups for passenger cars on pavement. Electronically controlled to feed torque to whichever wheels need it, while sensing and compensating for slips and slides, Quattro provides finesse and security.\n\nThe Avant has the kind of styling that accentuates its station-wagon body rather than hiding it. The rear has a rounded, modern shape that makes the Avant look like it wants to move.\n\nSpeaking of moving, you can load some boxes back there, too, though the sloping roof and curving flanks take away some of the utility. Really, this is not the kind of wagon space available from Volvo or Mercedes-Benz, but should be enough for light duty.\n\nThe A4 is a small car, and although the driver and front-seat passenger have plenty of space, rear-seat folk had better not be too big or too fussy. The interior in our test car was named terra cotta for some unfathomable reason, but it was very handsome and comfortable, with supportive seats and a good atmosphere.\n\nThe dashboard is simple and well-designed, with easy-to-read gauges, but some of the switches and controls are hard to get used to. The stereo system has lost some of its fussiness, but operating it still involves a learning process. It’s a good-sounding stereo and well-worth the trouble.\n\nAudi’s downstream sibling, Volkswagen, also has released some sharp new wagons, notably the handsome Passat, this year. This is a bigger car at a lesser pric e, but it doesn’t have the level of trim or performance of the A4.\n\nThere’s also an Audi A6 Avant wagon, a stylish craft at a premium price, that’s bigger and brawnier than the A4.\n\nThe A4 Avant confirms my faith in station wagons. It’s certainly more handsome and pleasurable to drive than any minivan or sport-utility vehicle out there.\n\n1999 Audi A4 Avant Vehicle type: Five-passenger, four-door station wagon, all-wheel drive. Base price: $26,440. Price as tested: $27,220. Engine: 1.8-liter turbocharged four, 150 horsepower at 5,700 rpm, 155 pound-feet of torque at 1,750 rpm. Transmission: Five-speed manual. Curb weight: 3,353 pounds. Wheelbase: 102.6 inches. EPA fuel economy: 21 city, 29 highway. Highs: Driving finesse. Handsome styling. Moderate price. Lows: Cramped back seat. Confusing dash.

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in March 2011 about the 2011 Audi A4. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2012, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nWith sales more than double any of its brand siblings, the Audi A4 entry-luxury sedan is effectively Audi’s ambassador in the U.S. The R8 supercar might grab more publicity, but the A4 is the car that average customers are most likely to encounter.\n\nAfter driving the sporty A4 with its refined interior, it’s clear that it’s not entry-level: it’s near the top of its class.\n\nI tested an A4 sedan with Quattro all-wheel drive and the new-for-2011 eight-speed automatic transmission. This version starts at $34,500, but with options our as-tested price reached $43,220. To see a side-by-side comparison of the A4 and some of its competitors, click here.\n\nTurbocharged Power\nAudi has wrung quite a bit of performance from its turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder, which powers all versions of the A4. Whether accelerating from a stoplight or merging on the highway, the engine feels bigger than it is, bringing you up to speed more quickly than its specs suggest. There’s even a little power in reserve on the highway when a burst is needed. All in all, it feels just as strong as the BMW 328i with its inline-six-cylinder engine. Credit the turbo four-cylinder’s healthy 258 pounds-feet of torque at a low 1,500 rpm.\n\nOur test car had the newly optional eight-speed automatic transmission. Despite the high gear count, the transmission doesn’t seem overly busy, and that’s partly because of its relatively seamless shifts. However, one editor noted that the transmission had a tendency to hesitate under light acceleration.\n\nDownshifts come quickly enough with a jab of the gas pedal. If it needs to, the transmission will skip a few gears to get to the one it needs, rather than step down one at a time. A Sport mode holds the transmission in lower gears longer, and there’s a clutchless-manual mode for driver-controlled shifts.\n\nThe A4 gets better gas mileage with the new transmission, which is especially welcome because the car requires premium gas. The all-wheel-drive A4 is rated at 21/29 mpg city/highway with the eight-speed automatic, which represents a 2 mpg improvement in highway fuel economy compared with the six-speed 2010 model. Meanwhile, the front-wheel-drive A4 with a continuously variable automatic transmission gets an EPA-estimated 22/30 mpg.\n\nThe A4’s four-wheel disc brakes quickly shed speed, but the brake pedal doesn’t offer the greatest feel. I thought the brakes were a little grabby, while another editor commented on the lack of pedal linearity when braking.\n\nRide & Handling\nThe A4’s regular suspension (a Sport suspension is optional) is stiff, which keeps body roll in check, but the tuning isn’t so firm that driving on rough pavement is jarring. There’s no question the emphasis is on sporty driving, but Audi wisely realizes that a car like the A4 also has to keep its occupants comfortable during daily commutes. With the regular suspension, it does.\n\nIt’s worth noting that our test car had winter tires. While appropriate for the conditions, they likely affected the car’s character compared with the all-season tires it normally wears. Winter tires have softer rubber compounds for better grip in cold weather — along with more aggressive tread patterns — which affects handling, acceleration and road-noise levels, among other things.\n\nWhile the firm suspension tuning is common among German luxury cars, the steering feels like it’s been sourced from Lexus. At low and midrange speeds, the wheel turns easily and with little effort. Unfortunately, there’s also little feedback. However, a pronounced change occurs when you reach highway speeds, where the steering firms up and feels sharper.\n\nThe A4’s Quattro all-wheel-drive system features rear-biased torque distribution for improved dynamics. Even though it powers out of corners without feeling nose-heavy, it’s still not as engaging as a rear-wheel-drive BMW 3 Series or Infiniti G37.\n\nA Classy Cabin\nAudi cabin quality has long been among the best in the industry, and the A4’s interior continues that trend. What distinguishes Audi interiors isn’t just the use of high-quality materials, like real aluminum accents, but also the finish of the various trim pieces and the way they fit together well. Then you have the little touches, like a center armrest that not only slides forward and back, but also ratchets up and down.\n\nIn the past few years we’ve seen more attention to interior quality from brands like Cadillac (with its CTS) and Infiniti (with the G37), but the A4’s cabin remains one of the nicest spaces in the class.\n\nThe front bucket seats are finished in standard leather upholstery. By comparison, many competitors like the 3 Series, Mercedes-Benz C-Class and CTS make do with simulated leather upholstery in base models. The A4’s firm seat cushions provide good support and comfort, and the front of the cabin is big enough for my 6-foot-1 frame.\n\nThe backseat, though, is a little cramped. Just getting into it is difficult for taller adults, because the door opening isn’t very large. Once seated, I didn’t have much room to spare with the driver’s seat adjusted for me, though indentations in the backs of the front seats provide some extra knee clearance. Taller people sit with their knees elevated some, which doesn’t bode well for long-drive comfort. Still, it’s more comfortable than the backseat of a 3 Series sedan.\n\nThe A4’s trunk measures 12 cubic feet, which is similar to what competitors offer. The trunk has a nice rectangular shape for fitting luggage, and the split-folding backseat — previously standard but now optional like it is on the 3 Series and C-Class — creates a sizable opening for carrying longer items. \n\nSafety\nThe A4 was recognized as a 2011 Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. It received the highest possible overall score from IIHS — Good — in frontal-offset, side-impact, roof-strength and rear-impact testing.\n\nStandard safety features include antilock brakes, side-impact airbags for the front seats, side curtain airbags for both rows of seats, and an electronic stability system. Rear-seat side-impact airbags are optional.\n\nFor a full list of safety features, check out the Standard Equipment & Specs page.\n\nA4 in the Market\nOne of the A4’s biggest strengths is that it appeals to luxury shoppers in a number of ways. If you’re concerned about gas mileage, it’s comparatively thrifty. If you like fine furnishings, the cabin will feel like home. Plus, there are a number of available high-end features to interest technophiles. It may not offer the pure driving experience of a 3 Series, but in the areas that matter most in this part of the luxury segment, the entry-level A4 stands tall.\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nAudi, the luxury division of Volkswagen, adds side-impact head airbags as a new optional feature on its near-luxury sedan. The side head airbags cover the entire side windows and stay deployed for about five seconds to provide protection in rollovers. Seat-mounted side airbags that protect the bodies of the driver and front passenger also are standard, as are anti lock brakes.\n\nA redesigned A4 sedan is scheduled to arrive as a 2001 model. Styling on the new A4 will reportedly adopt some of the themes from Audi’s rounded TT coupe. The new A4 sedan will be followed by coupe, wagon and convertible models.\n\nInterior\nThe A4’s front seats provide ample room for large occupants, but the rear seat doesn’t have much legroom for tall people. The optional power sunroof steals about 2 inches of headroom. The attractive dashboard places most controls where they are easy to see and operate. Cloth upholstery is standard, and leather is optional on A4 2.8 models.\n\nExterior\nA new grille and headlights and fog lights relocated to the lower bumper give the front end a fresh look, while the rear benefits from larger taillights. The A4 is a few inches longer than a Honda Civic sedan.\n\nUnder the Hood\nEngine choices are a turbocharged 1.8-liter four-cylinder with 150 horsepower or a 2.8-liter V-6 with 190 horsepower. Both engines are available with a manual transmission or Porsche’s Tiptronic five-speed automatic. Tiptronic allows fully automatic operation or manual shifting by steering-wheel mounted switches. Audi’s permanently engaged all-wheel-drive system is optional on both sedan models. Front-wheel drive is standard.\n\nPerformance\nThe A4 is short on space but has several selling points. It comes loaded with safety and convenience features, the security of all-wheel drive is available, and Audi pays for routine maintenance the first three years or 50,000 miles. Long-term, the corrosion warranty lasts an industry-high 12 years.\n\nMore Choices\nThe S4 is a high-performance spinoff of the A4 sedan. Its key difference from the A4 is under the hood, where a 2.7-liter V-6 engine has two turbochargers, one for each bank of cylinders. The S4’s engine generates 250 horsepower, 60 more than the A4’s V-6.\n\nThe turbocharged engine teams with either a standard six-speed manual transmission or Tiptronic five-speed automatic that allows manual shifting with steering wheel-mounted switches. Standard features include Audi’s Quattro all-wheel-drive system, leather upholstery, wood interior trim, a CD player and anti-lock brakes. The S4 has side-impact airbags mounted in the front seats as well as Audi’s new side-impact head airbags, which inflate from above the windows to protect both front and rear occupants.\n\n \n\nReported by Rick Popely  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2000 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The Audi A4’s 2017 redesign looks subtle at first glance, or even second. But the devil is in the details, and those details make this Audi a strong choice in a crowded class.\n\nVersus the competition: The A4 isn’t the best-handling car in its competitive set, but it’s among the quickest, with a lot of technology and surprising value to boot.\n\nThe new A4 is on sale now in Premium, Premium Plus and Prestige trim levels with front- or all-wheel drive. Stack up the 2017 and 2016 A4 here. All of the 2017 versions employ an updated turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder, paired with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission.\n\nFear not, performance enthusiasts: Audi says a stick-shift A4 is coming, as is a higher-performance S4 that’s based on this new generation. Expect a wagon version, too. At Audi’s California media preview, I drove Premium Plus and Prestige sedans, both with all-wheel drive.\n\nExterior and Styling\n\n\nYou could easily mistake the latest A4 for its predecessor (2009-16). The car’s sprawling grille, LED-framed headlights and squinting taillights still are here, though Audi tweaked them to a more technical effect. The car also looks bigger, though increases to the wheelbase, width and overall length are slight.\n\nAudi avoids the plunging-belt-line wedge profile that characterizes so many sedans these days, luxury or not. Instead, the A4’s windows hug a horizontal crease that runs seamlessly into the hood. It’s all an exercise in restraint. Even the sportier S-line appearance package, standard with Premium Plus and Prestige trims, dresses the bumpers in some mild ground effects that stay within the car’s minimalist aesthetic.\n\nHow It Drives\n\n\nThere’s no such restraint in the A4’s 2.0-liter four-cylinder, one heck of a fine base engine. Reworked for 252 horsepower and 273 pounds-feet of torque (up 32 hp and 15 pounds-feet over the prior 2.0-liter turbo), it enables potent acceleration. Even with three adults aboard, our test cars made short work of uphill stretches, with the same gratifying torque plateau as the old A4’s 2.0-liter — just noticeably more.\n\nThe engine also flatters an otherwise unremarkable transmission, which — outside of its Sport mode — exhibits smooth but frequent upshifts and stubborn kickdown resistance. Torque saves the day; even at low rpm, the A4 can tack on speed.\n\nThe A4 was a pioneer of turbo four-cylinder engines, but competitors ranging from the BMW 328i and Mercedes-Benz C300 to the Lexus IS 200t have caught up with excellent turbo fours of their own. With this redesign, Audi’s back with the best of them, and possibly ahead.\n\nDitto for braking, where the new A4 has upsized standard discs that are nearly the size of the previous S4’s brakes. Gone is the old A4’s soft pedal; the new A4 has firm, strong brakes.\n\nThe redesign brings some handling improvements over the old A4’s penchant for body roll, with less lean and little apparent sacrifice in ride quality — even with the standard fixed suspension in the Premium Plus car we drove. (A lowered, fixed sport suspension is optional, but Audi didn’t have any cars with it available to drive.) The optional adaptive suspension, which I drove in the A4 Prestige, quells bumps and limits body motion in slight but noticeable ways versus the fixed setup, and it quells body roll well even in its Comfort mode.\n\nStill, the handling isn’t what you’d call outright fun. Lightened by around 65 to 100 pounds versus the 2016, depending on driveline, the A4 feels nimble on winding roads, but there’s a slight, clear understeer bias. Our test cars’ grippy Hankook summer tires masked a lot of it, but the push became apparent on tight mountain switchbacks. Drifting the tail, an easy maneuver even in all-wheel drive versions of the BMW 3 Series and Cadillac ATS, is all but impossible in an A4. Steering feedback at higher speeds is good, particularly in the A4’s sportier driving modes, but some drivers will find the car’s high steering assist at lower speeds — a characteristic of many Audis — too buoyant.\n\nInterior\n\n\nCabin materials are good, though the A4 still has a few lower-rent plastics in areas the standard-setting Mercedes-Benz C-Class dresses up. However, most interior surfaces in the A4 have uniform finish, and there are small touches — such as three-dimensional edging around certain controls — that show attention to detail.\n\nThe cabin also shows attention to practicality. Thin window pillars all around make for good visibility, and the front seats have lots of legroom and knee space thanks to a low center console that retains its convenient height-adjustable armrest. The backseat, meanwhile, feels downright generous for this class. Headroom and legroom are good, and the seat sits high enough off the floor for good thigh support. It’s a major improvement over the 2016 A4’s backseat.\n\nMy journalist co-driver and I agreed that the standard seats are too flat and unsupportive, but Audi offers sport seats with some much-needed bolstering that adds comfort without pinching. Eight-way power adjustments and leather upholstery are standard — the latter nice to see, given that most competitors start you out with vinyl.\n\nErgonomics and Electronics\n\n\nThere’s no shortage of technological eye candy, from climate readouts that materialize from dark backgrounds when you use them (though they show basic information, such as temperature, at all times) to a tablet-sized display that sits above the air vents. A 7-inch center display is standard, and an 8.3-inch display is optional. Additionally, Audi’s optional Virtual Cockpit replaces conventional gauges with a 12.3-inch display that can enlarge or reduce the gauges to prioritize different views, including navigation maps. A regular map background or Google Earth satellite images populate via an onboard 4G LTE internet connection; if you don’t want to pay for the subscription once Audi’s six-month trial runs out, the satellite maps from areas in which you’ve driven remain cached.\n\nSome of the technology is overkill. Audi replaced the old A4’s lovely mechanical gearshift with an electronic selector that feels as artificial as the rest of them. And the knob-based controller for Audi’s Multi Media Interface infotainment system is overdue for a conventional touch-screen replacement, especially when you have to spin the knob through selections for the A4’s standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity.\n\nCargo and Storage\n\n\nLuxury cars often give in-cabin storage short shrift, and so it goes with the A4. The  glove compartment and center console bin both are small. At least the console’s bin extends ahead of the armrest leaving a space into which you can throw smaller items. (Little or no open storage – a problem in many luxury cars – is a pet peeve of mine.)\n\nThe trunk, though a modest 13 cubic feet by the numbers, is both deep and usefully shaped. A standard 40/20/40-split folding backseat enables a wide pass-through free of any ledges or trailing seat belts.\n\nSafety\n\n\nAs of this writing, the A4 has yet to be crash-tested. Go here to see a full list of standard safety features. Of note, those include a standard backup camera, plus forward collision warning at all speeds with automatic emergency braking below 52 mph.\n\nSafety options include traffic-sign recognition, which displays signs for the speed limit and school or construction zones (and can be deactivated by the driver); a rear collision warning that pre-tensions seatbelts and starts to close the windows and moonroof (if open) when it detects an impending rear impact; a vehicle exit function that flashes lights inside the door at an occupant who’s about to exit if it senses traffic bearing down on you; cross-traffic backup alerts with an automatic brake-jolt feature; and a feature that stops you from making a left turn in front of oncoming traffic. The A4’s optional adaptive cruise control works at all speeds and includes steering assist.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\n\nWhat’s remarkable is how many of the car’s features are standard. The A4’s starting price — around $38,000 with front-wheel drive, or about $40,000 for a Quattro version — is a bit of a bump from before. But it gets you the power seats and leather, plus a moonroof, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, tri-zone automatic climate control and the aforementioned standard safety features. Throw in heated front seats (a $500 stand-alone option on the A4 Premium) and the A4 has all the essentials for most luxury shoppers.\n\nPile up the options and you can get ventilated seats, the Virtual Cockpit with Google Earth navigation, keyless access, Bang & Olufsen 3-D premium sound and various additional accident-avoidance technologies. Fully loaded, the Prestige tops out in the mid-$50,000s — still less sticker shock than the 328i or C300, both of which can end up north of $60,000.\n\nComfortable, capable and more value-oriented than you might think, the redesigned A4 plays a similar role as the Mercedes-Benz C-Class — Cars.com’s Best of 2015 car — in a crowded group of entry-luxury sedans. It plays up luxury and technology over outright sportiness, but I suspect that’s exactly what a lot of shoppers want.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nAudi redesigned its compact, entry-level A4 midway through the 2005 model year by giving it a larger engine with direct fuel injection. A4 competitors include the Acura TSX and BMW 3 Series, and for 2008 the sedan and Avant wagon versions of the A4 now come standard with the S-line package. An iPod connection kit is now optional.\n\nA convertible (Cabriolet) is also offered, and each body style comes in 2.0T form with a turbocharged four-cylinder, or in 3.2 guise with a V-6. Sedans and Cabriolets are available with FrontTrak front-wheel drive or Quattro all-wheel drive. The Avant wagon comes only with Quattro.\n\n(Skip to details on the: A4 Cabriolet)\n\nAudi continues to offer high-performance S4 and RS 4 series, both of which are listed separately in the Cars.com Research section.\n\nExterior\nThe newly standard S-line package includes a trunklid lip spoiler, sporty side sills and S-line badges. Standard tires on 2.0T models measure 16 inches in diameter, but 18-inch tires are installed on sedan and wagon models with the V-6 engine. Xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights that can pivot during a turn are available, as is a Parktronic rear park assist system that beeps to warn drivers if they are approaching objects to the rear.\n\nInterior\nSedans and wagons seat five people, and the seat cushions have prominent bolsters. S-line accents include brushed-aluminum pieces, special stitching and a three-spoke sport steering wheel. Standard equipment includes automatic dual-zone air conditioning. Leather seating surfaces are included in 3.2 models. The optional Audi Navigation Plus system has a 6-inch screen.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 200-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder powers 2.0T models. An aluminum 255-hp, 3.1-liter V-6 is installed in 3.2 editions. Depending on the model, both engines can team with a six-speed manual, six-speed automatic or continuously variable automatic transmission.\n\nSafety\nSide curtain airbags deploy from above the side windows. Side-impact airbags for front occupants are standard, and rear-seat side-impact airbags are optional. Audi’s electronic stability system incorporates Brake Assist.\n\nDriving Impressions\nThe A4 is solid and appealing, joyfully tackling twisting roads and taking every turn in stride. Plenty of power hails from the V-6, in a civilized manner. Strong performance with the turbocharged four-cylinder is devoid of turbo lag, and it’s a tad more spirited. The manual gearbox shifts easily, and Audi’s automatic transmission works without any harshness.\n\nAudi’s ultra-smooth multitronic CVT works masterfully and subtly. After slight hesitation during takeoff, the car moves ahead with some haste. Passing attempts at low speeds, however, sometimes yield a shortfall of response. You hear a little engine noise while accelerating with the CVT, but not much.\n\nA4 Cabriolet\nThe Cabriolet was redesigned for the 2007 model year and featured a new single-frame grille. Behind that grille is one of two new engines, a 200-hp, 2.0-liter four-cylinder or a 255-hp, 3.1-liter V-6. For 2008, the convertible can have an iPod connection kit, and the 3.2 trim level gains heated front seats.\n\nAudi used last year’s redesign as an opportunity to upgrade the Cabriolet’s safety features, integrating side airbags into the front seats to protect occupants’ heads. The automaker reinforced the Cabriolet’s A-pillars to protect occupants in the event of a rollover, which also causes two protective bars to deploy upward, behind the rear passengers’ heads.\n\nFour people fit inside the A4 Cabriolet’s cabin. Standard equipment includes a power roof, dual-zone automatic climate control and a large ski sack. Back to top",

      "expert_review": "Over the past week, our readers have shown impeccable taste when it comes to vehicle styling, bringing the 2018 Lexus LC 500h into second place among our most read car reviews. In fact, more people read the review (many times over) during the last week than the number of LC 500h examples Cars.com reviewer Joe Bruzek found for sale on our site; he was only able to track down nine listed across the country when writing his review.\n\nRelated: More Expert Car Reviews\n\nBruzek has high praise for the LC 500h’s looks, but the powertrain and driving experience are more of a mixed bag:\n\n“The LC is an amazing-looking car that drives amazingly with the V-8, but it loses a lot of its soul not having the responsive, cackling gas engine,” he notes.\n\nBruzek also expressed disappointment about the use of hybrid technology solely for fuel efficiency while some competitors’ electrified models get an electrifying performance boost. Check out his review to see if the fuel economy advantage makes the LC 500h worth it to you.\n\nVideo watchers last week focused on two redesigned cars, 2019 versions of the Nissan Altima and BMW X5.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nVolkswagens luxury division redesigned its compact, entry-level A4 sedan and A4 Avant wagon for 2002 and made an innovative multitronic continuously variable transmission (CVT) available. The power passenger seat has been deleted from the 3.0 FrontTrak sedan for the 2004 model year. The Audi A4 sedan and A4 Avant get a standard six-speed-manual transmission, a tire-pressure monitor and dual-stage front airbags. All models are ready for either Sirius or XM Satellite Radio.\n\nAudi added another A4 series by reviving the Cabriolet (convertible) body style for the 2003 model year. Promising performance thats comparable to its sedan and wagon siblings, the four-passenger A4 Cabriolet also is available with a CVT, and it shares basic styling touches with the A4 sedan.\n\nThe CVT promises greater fuel efficiency than that of a regular automatic transmission. Rather than have it deliver a totally continuous range, engineers incorporated a series of steps to make it feel more familiar. All three body styles come in 1.8T form with a turbocharged engine or in 3.0 guise with a V-6. Sedan and Cabriolet versions are available with FrontTrak front-wheel drive or quattro all-wheel drive. Except for the wagon body, the A4 Avant differs little from the A4 sedan and comes only with quattro all-wheel drive.\n\nExterior\nSome styling themes on Audis top-selling A4 were adapted from the companys round-profile TT sport coupe and midsize A6, but the A4 is more angular at the rear. A trapezoidal-link independent rear suspension is installed. The A4-based suspension was lowered slightly for use on the Cabriolet. Like the A4 sedan, the A4 Cabriolet has a double grille, a triple-tube headlight module, a contoured tail and chrome exhaust pipes. Flared wheel arches accent the bodysides. Brushed-aluminum trim goes around the windshield and along the waist.\n\nStandard tires are 16-inchers, but 17-inch tires may be installed on the A4 sedan and A4 Avant. The A4 Cabriolets five-spoke cast-alloy wheels hold 16-inch tires. Xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights, a sunroof and a Parktronic rear parking-assistance system and a wind deflector for the convertible are available.\n\nA wide arch roofline for the convertible top enhances the bodys subtle wedge profile. Intended for four-season comfort, the fabric top is triple-layered and padded. A heated glass rear window incorporates electric defrosting. A cover closes flush with the body.\n\nInterior\nThe A4 sedan and A4 Avant seat five people and have four-way power lumbar support. The seat cushions have prominent bolsters. Standard equipment includes automatic dual-zone air conditioning and an Immobilizer II anti-theft system. Audi Telematics by OnStar is optional. Audis navigation system, which works without a video-screen map, is also available.\n\nFour people fit inside the A4 Cabriolets sporty cabin, which features aluminum rings that circle the round air vents. Audis Symphony radio includes an in-dash six-CD changer and nine speakers. Standard equipment on the Cabriolet includes a four-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel, heated power mirrors and height-adjustable front seats with four-way electric lumbar adjustment. Automatic dual-zone climate control works with sun and pressure sensors. Parktronic parking assistance and a navigation system are available.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 170-horsepower, turbocharged 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine powers all 1.8T models. An aluminum 220-hp, 3.0-liter V-6 is installed in 3.0 editions. A five-speed or six-speed-manual gearbox is standard, depending on the model. The CVT unit is available only in FrontTrak models, but sedans equipped with quattro all-wheel drive may have a five-speed Tiptronic automatic that permits manual selection of simulated gears.\n\nSafety\nStandard curtain-type airbags deploy from above the side windows on the A4 sedan and A4 Avant. Side-impact airbags for front occupants are standard on all models, and rear-seat side-impact airbags are optional. An Electronic Stabilization Program incorporates Brake Assist. All seat belts have pretensioners, and LATCH child-safety seat tethers are installed.\n\nTwo bars behind the rear seats of the A4 Cabriolet deploy upward when a rollover incident is imminent. A strengthened windshield and A-pillars provide extra protection.\n\nDriving Impressions\nAudis A4 series has a lot to offer, but the highlight is its available multitronic CVT. Operating so subtly that the driver is hardly aware of its presence, the CVT does everything an automatic transmission promises but without any gear changes. The A4s passing response is excellent, and because CVT operation is so subtle, most drivers should quickly get used to the lack of actual shifting.\n\nWith its gearshift flicking easily between ratios and mating to clutch action, a manual-shift A4 is also enjoyable, but the levers position may not please everyone. The turbocharged four-cylinder engine responds eagerly but is a little noisier than the V-6. Handling prowess is the strong point. The A4 joyfully tackles twisting roads and takes all the turns in stride. Ride comfort is satisfying due to a nicely absorbent suspension, but passengers can be jostled a bit when the pavement gets harsh. Even though the A4 is snug inside, the seats are outstanding and provide great support with absorbent cushioning.\n\nEmphasizing luxury over sportiness, the A4 Cabriolet delivers a refined top-down experience. This car exhibits strong, confident and quick-responding performance, but its not quite exuberant. The convertible is easy to drive, and it stays impressively flat through curves. It maneuvers capably, but its steering isnt the most precise. Even on imperfect pavement, the ride is comfortable as the suspension transmits minimal fuss. The seats are superb: pleasantly cushioned, masterfully supportive and snugly  but not excessively  bolstered.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com;\nPosted on 9/26/03",

      "expert_review": "We are partial to Audis for three main reasons: their superb all-wheel-drive systems, subtly elegant and ergonomic interiors, and optional continuously variable transmissions.\n\nThe A4/S4 lineup is at the heart of the Audi lineup. It includes about 20 variations, including four-cylinder, turbocharged engines, V-6s and V-8s, station wagons, sedans, front-wheel drive, all-wheel drive, and transmissions that include a six-speed manual and six-speed automatic. You can also buy one with a continuously variable transmission like today’s test car, the four-cylinder turbo 2007 Audi A4 Cabriolet 2.0 T CVT.\n\nContinuously variable transmissions have been around for decades, notably in snowmobiles. Using a combination of convex pulleys that open and close and let a chain or belt change its shape with virtually endless variety, it gets the most out of any engine (although really high-powered engines pose a challenge). But Audi has built the best CVT I’ve ever seen, with preset “shifts” that let a driver pretend to be driving a manual. And in a fine display of dual per sonality, the seemingly electric hum of the CVT in automatic mode gives way to racing-style upshifts and downshifts.\n\nWhich is not to say that the A4 with CVT lacks power. After all, our test car pulled 200 horsepower from just 2 liters. Owing largely to the small engine and CVT, that performance also results in decent fuel-economy figures: 27.1 miles per gallon in Globe testing.\n\nFrom the outside, the A4 looks imposing, with a high hipline, headlights that rise and curve back into the fenders, and a looming grille that some do not like. Underneath are air intakes that house fog lamps and also help cool the front brakes. Despite the rather aggressive front, this really is not a large car. The rear seat room, in particular, can be pinched — you wouldn’t want to put more than two adults back there.\n\nInside, there is bold hooded gauge presentation and a center cluster of controls (some duplicated on the three-spoke steering wheel) that are easy to find and intuitive. Leather and combinations of wood or aluminum trim add to the fine sense of quality.\n\nThe drop-top cloth roof is well insulated and relatively quiet at high speeds. An optional roof with extra insulation is available.\n\nOn the road, the remarkable thing about the CVT is that you can truly drive it two ways: let the belts spin their magic and save fuel, or flick the paddle shifters in manual mode and play when the mood strikes.\n\nPowered front seats with firm bolstering and lumbar support are standard. So too are antilock brakes, brake assist for emergencies, and stability control. Standard air bags include driver and front passenger thorax bags and head side bags. An anti rollover system senses if the convertible might be ready to tip over and deploys, explosively, roll bars. A ski sack, between the rear seats, is also a useful standard offering.\n\nBut, as you may have figured, the A4 is not an inexpensive car, starting at $39,100 and climbing to nearly $43,000 in our test model with the addition of upgraded sound, a wind deflector, 17-inch alloy wheels with all-season tires, heated front seats, and walnut trim.\n\nWith its 4 series, Audi has created a lineup that allows consumers to comparison shop within one manufacturer. That’s an achievement in itself.\n\nRoyal Ford can be reached at ford@globe.com.",

      "expert_review": "Something magical happened to me and my family when we cruised about in the 2009 Audi A4. I can’t quite put a finger on the exact element that made the magic happen – maybe it was the Cardamom Beige-colored interior, or the A4’s stylized LED headlights – but there’s no denying that this car did something no other car has been able to do: It made my husband and I agree!\n\nTruth be told, the Audi A4 is the first car we’ve both adored. The kids were happy, too; they were able to buckle themselves in, store their snacks and reach the pop-out cupholders.\n\nFrom the outside, the A4 has an incredible presence. It exudes style and sets the tone for the complete image of what and who an Audi driver is. I certainly wanted to be seen in the A4. For me, it was like wanting to be seen on that one day each month when I actually do my hair and makeup to pick the kids up from school. Darn it, I worked hard on my look and I want to reap the rewards of recognition! This same theory applies to owning an A4. However, since the whole getting made-up thing doesn’t happen very often in my life, I used the A4 as my glam accessory and opted for deeply tinted windows so I could hide inside.\n\nDriving the A4 proved it wasn’t just another pretty face. It handled well and had surprising braking power. This works best when you’re getting into your highway groove, then someone cuts you off. Good brakes – love ’em. The Quattro all-wheel drive, a standard feature on the trim level I tested, was as agile as I was expecting it to be and had me wishing for some challenging terrain. My test car earns an EPA-estimated 17/26 mpg city/highway.\n\nMy family believed the A4 to be truly magical, and maybe we’re onto something. It’s sporty and powerful for the performance driver, yet safe and practical for the day-to-day driver. By tapping your magic wand (or your finger), the A4 lets you choose your suspension to suit a variety of driving personalities. You can even store four memory settings for the driver’s seat, steering wheel and side-mirror positions for the ultimate in customized comfort. The Audi A4 is the new Neapolitan ice cream – a little of everything for everyone.\n\nExterior\n\nRedesigned for 2009, the new A4 has added some spice to its appearance. The bland, practical exterior of the past has been replaced with a younger, bolder look that may even border on risqué, if you happen to be a German engineer. I thought the car was drop-dead gorgeous, and the Brilliant Red paint color of my test car was enough to get my kids excited. Even a few weeks after our A4 adventure, my youngest still spots other Audis on the road and remarks, “See Mom, dat car is like our wed one. The one dat had the rings.” Aww, spoken in perfect toddler-ese!\n\nWhile you might notice the A4’s smoother, sleeker side-panels or its newly integrated spoiler, it’s the A4’s face that’ll have you drooling like an infant. No makeup needed, the A4 is ready to go and lookin’ hot at a moment’s notice. Sharp-looking headlights are accented by the glowing “eyelash” LED daytime running lights, which are absolutely stunning. The A4’s signature grille was large and sporty looking; it made me feel like the car had strength. Fog lights added to the amped-up ambience.\n\nThis car may carry carpool by day, but by night – look out! My husband and I enjoyed a night out on the town while I had the A4. Getting ready, we felt as if we had to dress to the car’s level of class – definitely strappy heels with this one! As we hid the booster seats in the trunk, we glanced at each other with glee and said, “No kids!” In a snap, we were being carried away on the A4’s available 18-inch wheels.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nInterior\n\nTrying to describe every feature inside the A4 is like tackling a monster cleaning project: Where should I start? Comfort, style and technology are everywhere in the A4. From the standard leather seating to the wood accents to the MMI control system in the center console, I was overwhelmed by the whole package.\n\nOnce securely nestled in the driver’s seat, I found the ignition button near the gearshift. Then I started to wonder what the heck all the other buttons around the gearshift were for. My boys were getting curious, too, so I had to pull out the manual and study up. These buttons are part of the MMI system, which basically controls everything from navigation to audio to heating/cooling, and it lets you choose the suspension setting you want. There’s also a knob controller for moving through menus on the screen. I enjoyed switching from the Dynamic suspension to the Comfortable from time to time just because I found it so amazing that you can change something like the suspension while still moving, and with the touch of a button! Although, I did wonder who got to name the suspensions because, of course, I felt more comfortable in Dynamic mode.\n\nIn addition to all the tech stuff, the A4 had all my other favorite features, including heated seats, great lumbar support, satellite radio and automatic headlights and wipers.\n\nIn the second row, the kids had lots of space, but I had a hard time installing my sons’ booster seats because of the big head restraints in the backseat. There’s enough room in the second row for a rear-facing infant-safety seat. The Latch connectors are covered by hard plastic covers, which were a pain because they added an extra step to installing a car seat. Once the covers were removed, it was easy to access the Latch connectors.\n\nThe backseat’s armrest is fabulous; it features a storage space for snacks and a hard surface that my kids used as a table. The cupholders popped out of this armrest and were well within the kids’ reach. Audi also threw in two seatback pockets.\n\nThe A4’s trunk was spacious and came with a multitude of cargo nets and grocery-bag hooks to help keep things organized. You can also fold the second-row seats flat to expand your cargo space if needed.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\n\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove on): Groove on\n\nSafety\n\nThe Audi A4 3.2 is the teacher’s pet in a classroom full of safety-conscious sedans. It’s been named a Top Safety Pick for 2009 by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. To receive this honor, a car must earn the highest rating – Good – in IIHS crash tests and offer electronic stability control. The A4 also earned five-star crash-test ratings from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. These safety ratings are enough to make even the toughest critic nod with approval.\n\nIn addition to electronic stability control, the A4 has standard antilock brakes and traction control, as well as front, side-impact and side curtain airbags. Side-impact airbags for the backseat are available.\n\nMy visibility while driving was OK, until I needed to look out the rear window. The backseat’s giant head restraints, which made it difficult for me to install my sons’ booster seats, also blocked part of the back window and got in the way of a clear rear view. The optional blind spot warning system was great for alerting me when other cars were out of my view.\n\nFAMILY LIFESTAGE\n\nIn Diapers: There’s plenty of trunk space to hold all your baby gear.\n\nIn School: The backseat headrests made it difficult to install my sons’ booster seats, but once in they were comfortable in the rear.\n\nTeens: The A4 is an IIHS Top Safety Pick, which adds peace of mind for any parent when a teen driver gets behind the wheel.",

      "expert_review": "German automaker Audi wasn’t timid when it came time to redesign the A4, a compact sedan that aspires to play in the same luxury territory as BMW, Lexus and Infiniti.\n\nAudi designers opted for a radical redesign that adopts the brand’s new family “face” — a yawning grille, new clear-glass headlights and creases in the hood that give the car a “power bulge.”\n\nThere is no male/female split here on whether the Germans did the right thing with the 2005 A4, which debuted in March. To us, the design is a hands-down winner, cutting across gender lines to score a slam dunk.\n\nWe tested an Audi A4 2.0 T Quattro sedan with several options, including $500 17-inch alloy wheels with all-season tires and $450 light silver metallic paint. The bottom line: $35,320.\n\nSHE: I’m so glad we are leaving the era of expressionless cars. When I think back on some of the vehicles we drove in the 1990s, like the Buick Century and the Mercury Mystique, they seem completely devoid of emotion. At least cars like the A4 are getting a lot more lively looking.\n\nHE: Boy, it sure took awhile, but that new family styling theme at Audi has really grown on me. Talk about in-your-face design. The look is bold, expressive and so distinctive, you can spot the A4 coming from a mile away. All the Audis have big-time personality, and the A4 is no exception. Even better, with all the mechanical improvements for 2005, the A4 delivers on the promise of that aggressive face. Take the new turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, which replaces last year’s 1.8-liter unit. It’s a performance version of parent Volkswagen’s direct-injection gasoline engine family, and it makes an impressive 200 horsepower — that’s 100 horsepower per liter, sweetheart. Audi has wisely harnessed that power to a sweet six-speed automatic transmission with Tiptronic manual-shift capability, then sends it to all four wheels through its patented Quattro system. It’s tough to beat this combination for all-weather traction and flat-out acceleration in a $35,000 sport sedan.\n\nSHE: You can make the argument that the Audi has a lot of value, with such standard features as side curtain air bags, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, heated outside mirrors and a six-disc CD changer. But it’s easy to rapidly inflate the base price. Our test vehicle, for example, had $4,000 worth of options, and it isn’t even fully equipped. Want heated front and rear seats? They’re part of a $750 cold-weather package. A power front passenger seat is part of a $2,100 premium package. And I wonder how any manufacturer can justify charging $450 extra for silver paint.\n\nHE: Point taken. I see that by adding a V-8 engine and other goodies, you can quickly run the price of an A4 over $45,000. For the money, the Acura TL is a better car, and some folks will find the new BMW 3 Series more entertaining. Still, the revamped A4 is a major player in this segment, on a number of fronts. We haven’t even talked about safety, an area where Audi traditionally excels. In addition to the aforementioned side curtains, the A4’s standard equipment includes side air bags for front occupants, electronic stability program and four-wheel disc brakes with antilock.\n\nSHE: The good things about the A4 include a world-class cabin, right down to the cup holders. They don’t pop out of the dash any more, but are located more sensibly inside the center console. Audi said they were designed for the U.S. market. But I’d like to get back to the engine, especially with gas prices skyrocketing. That high-performance turbo engine also helps you save fuel. The EPA rates our test car at 22 miles per gallon in city driving and 30 on the highway, which are pretty impressive numbers for a European sport sedan.\n\nHE: Only a few small, but significant gripes. There is simply not enough legroom in the rear seats for adults. And that wide center stack really encroaches on the driver’s knee and legroom. Otherwise, if you’re prepared to drop this kind of money on a small performance car, the A4 is well worth a test drive and a closer look.\n\n– – –\n\nHe drove, she drove Anita and Paul Lienert are partners in Lienert & Lienert, an Ann Arbor-based automotive information services company.\n\n– – –\n\n2005 Audi A4 2.0T Quattro\n\nType: Front-engine, all-wheel drive, five-passenger sedan\n\nPrice: Base, $31,370 (including $720 destination charge); as tested, $35,320\n\nEngine: 2.0-liter I-4; 200-hp; 207 lb-ft torque\n\nEPA fuel economy: 22 mpg city / 30 mpg highway\n\nWhere built: Germany\n\nKey competitors: Acura TL, BMW 3 Series, Cadillac CTS, Infiniti G35, Jaguar X-Type, Lexus ES 330, Lexus IS, Lincoln LS, Mercedes-Benz C-Class, Nissan Maxima, Saab 9-3, Subaru Legacy/Outback, Toyota Avalon, Volkswagen Passat, Volvo S60\n\n12-month insurance cost, estimated by AAA Michigan: $1,408 (Rates may be higher or lower, depending on coverage and driving record.)\n\nAnita’s Rating: 4\n\nLikes: Eye-catching new face adds drama and presence. Larger, more powerful engines for ’05. World-class cabin is warm, inviting. Detail improvements, including better location for cup holders. Available with front- or all-wheel drive. Agile handling.\n\nDislikes: Options can really drive up the price. No adjustable pedals or rear-seat DVD entertainment. Service reputation needs some work.\n\nPaul’s Rating: 4\n\nLikes: Lovely turbocharged 2.0-liter I-4 is lots of fun. Great new six-speed Tiptronic transmission. Terrific safety features. Pretty good fuel economy.\n\nDislikes: Not enough rear legroom. Wide center console cuts into driver’s legroom.\n\nRating system\n\n1. Unacceptable, 2. Subpar, 3. Acceptable, 4. Above Average, 5.
