      "expert_review": "There’s something really special about Audi’s TT.\n\nI can always tell which test car has the most appeal by the number of neighbors who stop to talk about it as it sits in my drive. Call it the Curiosity Quotient.\n\nSo far this year, the TT tops the list. For the few short days that a denim-blue coupe inhabited my driveway, its unique styling attracted visitors like the flashing blue light at Kmart. As folks stopped to chat, the conversation hinged on its captivating looks. Inevitably there would be some reference to Volkswagen’s New Beetle, which exhibits a similar kind of zest and individuality, which is not surprising since both cars reflect the design skills of Freeman Thomas, a designer in Volkswagen’s California studio. Both, too, share a common platform, or basic structure.\n\nIn case you were wondering, the TT’s name comes from motoring’s oldest race, the Tourist Trophy.\n\nMy first drive in a TT was for part of a day last spring in Texas. A regular test drive here at home reinforced my initial impressions and brought some new thoughts to the surface.\n\nClearly, the TT is one of the outstanding cars of the year. Not only is its styling refreshingly clean, but it also drives as well or better than any other front-wheel-drive car I know. On top of that, its base price of $30,500 is quite reasonable.\n\nIf there’s one serious drawback to the TT, it’s the fact that Audi will import only about 4,000 of them this year, and maybe just 10,000 next year. Exclusivity requires patience, so if you want one, be prepared to wait.\n\nThe clever exterior is almost overshadowed by the interior, where polished aluminum surrounds the air vents and gauges. Aluminum is also used for pedals and the braces from the dash to the floor. The cupholder is a work of art in simple tubing. It’s too bad it is located so far back between the seats where it is hard to reach.\n\nSide airbags that protect body and head are built into the seats.\n\nWith a wheelbase of 95.4 inches, the TT is not a big car. The roof is low, the trunk small and the back seat just big enough for a briefcase. The back seat folds down, though, to open up a more useful space when needed.\n\nSnuggled under the TT’s blunt nose is a 180-horsepower, 1.8-liter turbocharged, 4-cylinder engine with five valves per cylinder. This big-hearted gem drives the front wheels through a 5-speed manual gearbox,and shifting it is positively delightful because it has one of the most direct shift linkages I have experienced in a front-drive car. The stubby lever is topped by a large round shift knob trimmed in, you guessed it, aluminum. Changing gears is a delight.\n\nUsually, small displacement engines that are turbocharged suffer from turbo lag, which is how long it takes for the engine to react after you mash the throttle. Audi, however, uses a small turbo that spins quickly and adds power at very low speeds, giving the car the responses of a much bigger engine without as much of a mileage penalty.\n\nThe car I drove earlier in the year seemed a touch faster than the one I drove at home, but that’s probably because I was already familiar with the engine. Regardless, both had more than adequate zip (zero to 60 mph in a little over 7 seconds). An all-wheel-drive Quattro version with 225-horsepower is planned for the future. A convertible is coming as well.\n\nSome front-wheel-drive cars dart about under heavy throttle as the front wheels fight for traction, and some feel reluctant to turn sharply into fast corners, but Audi has done a good job of taming both of these tendencies with the TT. It tracks straight and true with good feel. Point its nose into a corner and it charges through as if it were held to the road by a magnet, grip courtesy of the optional 17-inch wheels. The quick-ratio steering is ideally weighted.\n\nThe powerful four-wheel disc brakes wipe off speed impressively. Anti-lock is standard. P> The TT is Audi’s shining star, the one car whose goodness echoes across the whole model range. It speaks volumes about how a company can bring a concept car to production without sacrificing its essence. The fact that is was done using many parts common to other models is a major factor in keeping the price out of the stratosphere. Now, if they would only build more of them.\n\nPrice\n\nThe base price is $30,500. Equipped with 17-inch wheels, CD player and the sport package, its sticker price is $33,925.\n\nWarranty@otx: Four years or 50,000 miles.\n\nTo get in touch with Tom Strongman call (816)-234-4349 or e-mail:strongmn@kcstar.com.\n\nPoint: Concept-car styling and great handling at a reasonable price set the TT apart. The interior is tastefully designed and comfortably appointed.\n\nCounterpoint: Functionally, the TT is a two seater with limited headroom and a small trunk.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\n\nENGINE: 1.8-liter, 4-cyl\n\nTRANSMISSION: 5-speed\n\nCONFIGURATION: Front-wheel drive\n\nWHEELBASE: 95.4 inches\n\nCURB WEIGHT: 2,655 lbs.\n\nBASE PRICE: $30,500\n\nPRICE AS DRIVEN: $33,925\n\nMPG RATING: 22 city, 31 hwy.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Audi TT?\n\nThe Audi TT comes as a four-seat coupe or two-seat roadster. Both have a standard turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that delivers 228 horsepower. This engine pairs with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission, and all-wheel drive is standard. The more powerful TTS coupe is powered by a 288-hp turbo four-cylinder.  At the top of the heap is the TT RS coupe, which is powered by a turbocharged 2.5-liter five-cylinder engine that makes 394 hp. Rivals to this Audi performance trio include the Mercedes-Benz SLC-Class, BMW 2 Series and Lexus RC.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Audi TT?\n\nThe TT and TTS get an alarm system with a motion sensor, while red brake calipers are a stand-alone option for the TT RS.\n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Audi TT Are Most Important?\n\nThe Audi TT comes with a fun and relatively frugal turbo four-cylinder engine, and standard all-wheel drive enhances the sports car’s all-weather capability. The cabin is classy, featuring a high-tech instrument panel, but it forgoes a central dashboard screen, so anyone who likes their passenger to play co-pilot and navigator should take note.\n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Audi TT?\n\nAs sports cars go, the Audi TT is relatively practical so long as you accept its limitations. The coupe’s rear seat is hardly usable, while the roadster’s tiny trunk will force you to pack light for weekend getaways. The range-topping TT RS is a riot to drive, but it’s awfully pricey and will mostly appeal to diehard Audi fans.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2022 Audi TT?\n\nThe Audi TT comes as a four-seat coupe or two-seat roadster. Both have a standard turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that delivers 228 horsepower. The more powerful TTS coupe is powered by a 288-hp, turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder. Both engines pair with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission, and all-wheel drive is standard.\n\nAt the top of the range is the TT RS coupe, which is powered by a turbo 2.5-liter five-cylinder engine that makes 394 hp. Rivals to this Audi performance trio include the BMW 2 Series and Lexus RC.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2022 Audi TT?\n\nA new Bronze Selection Package for the TTS features black exterior accents, 20-inch bronze wheels, Nappa leather with copper-colored stitching, and aluminum and bronze-colored interior accents. \n\nWhat Features in the 2022 Audi TT Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nDigital instrument cluster with 12.3-inch screen\nFlat-bottomed steering wheel with shift paddles\nHeated front seats\nWireless device charging\nFront and rear parking sensors\nShould I Buy the 2022 Audi TT?\n\nAs sports cars go, the Audi TT is practical so long as you accept its limitations. The coupe’s rear seat is barely usable, while the roadster’s tiny trunk forces you to pack light for weekend getaways. The range-topping TT RS is a riot to drive, but it’s very pricey and will mostly appeal to diehard Audi fans.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Audi TT?\n\nThe Audi TT comes as a four-seat coupe or two-seat soft-top roadster. Both have a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine with 220 horsepower, a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission and all-wheel drive. Audi also offers a more powerful TTS coupe with 288 hp. Competing convertibles include the Mercedes-Benz SLC-Class, while coupe alternatives range from BMW's 2 Series to the Lexus RC.\n\nWhat's New on the 2019 Audi TT?\n\nA seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission replaces a six-speed automatic as standard on all models, which also get the Audi phone box with wireless charging as standard. A Competition Package for the TTS includes carbon fiber interior trim, leather sport seats, 20-inch black wheels, black exterior trim and red brake calipers.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Audi TT Are Most Important?\n\nStandard all-wheel drive is a plus, as are LED headlights, configurable driving modes, a full LCD instrument panel and a lushly furnished interior.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Audi TT?\n\nYou will stand apart from the crowd of SUVs on today's roads with the TT; Audi sold fewer than 1,300 in 2018. Its handling and performance are commendable, though there's a noticeable lag after stepping on the gas before a rush of power arrives in normal driving modes. The cabin is spacious and comfortable for two and comes with a wide assortment of amenities. The limited practicality of the TT, though, means it works best as a second or third car in a family fleet, albeit one that can be a pleasure to drive.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Audi TT?\n\nOffered as a two-passenger convertible and four-passenger coupe, the Audi TT is a stylish and entertaining sports car that competes with the likes of the BMW Z4, Porsche 718 Cayman and 718 Boxster, and the Lexus RC. Under the TT’s pert hood is a 228-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that sends power to all four wheels via a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. The TTS, which is only available in coupe form, comes with a 288-hp version of the same powertrain and is also equipped with all-wheel drive.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Audi TT?\n\nThe TT gets a new 18-inch wheel design, and the high-performance TT RS coupe has been discontinued.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Audi TT Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nAll-wheel drive\nDigital instrument cluster with 12.3-inch screen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nDual-zone climate control\nFlat-bottomed steering wheel with shift paddles\nHeated front seats\nWireless device charging\nFront and rear parking sensors\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nAdaptive suspension\n20-inch alloy wheels\nShould I Buy the 2023 Audi TT?\n\nThe Audi TT coupe and convertible are a delight to drive, and standard all-wheel drive means they can be used even when the weather forecast is bleak. Many direct rivals are quicker, but the TT and TTS have plenty of punch and deliver surprisingly good fuel economy for sports cars. Granted, the convertible’s trunk is tiny, and the backseat in the coupe isn’t suitable for adults or even teens; it’s best suited for luggage or shopping bags.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2021 Audi TT?\n\nThe Audi TT comes as a four-seat coupe or two-seat roadster. Both have a standard turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that delivers 228 horsepower. This engine pairs with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission, and all-wheel drive is standard. The more powerful TTS coupe is powered by a 288-hp, turbo four-cylinder.  \n\nAt the top of the range is the TT RS coupe, which is powered by a turbocharged 2.5-liter five-cylinder engine that makes 394 hp. Rivals to this Audi performance trio include the Mercedes-Benz SLC-Class, BMW 2 Series and Lexus RC.\n \n\nWhat’s New on the 2021 Audi TT?\n\nNew standard features include sport seats finished in Nappa leather upholstery, additional leather interior accents, navigation, blind spot warning and a Bang & Olufsen stereo. The TT roadster also gains a standard neck-level heating system.\n\nWhat Features in the 2021 Audi TT Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nDigital instrument cluster with 12.3-inch screen\nFlat-bottomed steering wheel with shift paddles\nHeated front seats\nWireless device charging\nFront and rear parking sensors\nShould I Buy the 2021 Audi TT?\n\nAs sports cars go, the Audi TT is practical so long as you accept its limitations. The coupe’s rear seat is barely usable, while the roadster’s tiny trunk forces you to pack light for weekend getaways. The range-topping TT RS is a riot to drive, but it’s very pricey and will mostly appeal to diehard Audi fans.",

      "expert_review": "The 2016 Audi TT is an evolutionary redesign that handles well and offers more versatility than its small size might suggest, but a troubling case of acceleration lag saps the fun.\n\nThe TT comes as a four-seat coupe or two-seat, soft-top roadster. Both employ a turbocharged four-cylinder engine, a dual-clutch automatic transmission and all-wheel drive. Audi also offers a higher-powered TTS coupe, also redesigned, which we cover separately on Cars.com. See the TTS here, compare the two variants here, or stack up the 2016 and 2015 cars here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThis marks just the second redesign in more than 15 years for the TT, and it’s a subtler makeover than the one in early 2007. Complete with the same wide, grinning expression as its predecessor, the TT is an exercise in restraint. The differences are in the details: Audi’s trapezoidal grille is slowly morphing into a hexagon, and the TT adds some angles to the framework. The brand’s four-ringed logo sits on the hood, no longer the grille, and the full-LED headlights create a quasi-angry expression of jagged light bands. (Not to be confused with Jagged Light Band, which plays Thursdays at Jimmy’s.)\n\nOverall dimensions shrink a tad versus the second-gen TT, though the wheelbase gains a significant 1.4 inches. Eighteen-inch alloy wheels and dual tailpipes are standard. The TTS adds quad pipes and some unique bumper work — all tasteful, fortunately. At least for now there is no TTS roadster, which the prior-gen TT offered.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe TT’s 220-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder unleashes smooth, strong revving and a satisfying wave of torque (258 pounds-feet) along most of the tachometer’s rev range. Unfortunately, the whole experience comes in timid spurts: Editors agreed the accelerator exhibits considerable lag, and the dual-clutch automatic wants to upshift as soon as possible and resist kickdown until your foot is halfway to the floor.\n\nAudi’s configurable driving modes include a Dynamic setting that tempers some of the accelerator lag, while a Sport mode on the gearshift dials back the upshift tendency to keep you in lower gears more often. Call up Dynamic and Sport and the TT responds like a proper sports car — but that’s a characteristic it should default to. For whatever reason, too many allegedly sporty cars introduce all kinds of lag in their standard drivetrain modes. Audi is as guilty as the rest.\n\nA manual transmission, which could minimize or perhaps eliminate these frustrations, remains unavailable.\n\nAudi says the TT coupe hits 60 mph in 5.3 seconds (5.6 seconds for the roadster), which rivals the prior-gen TT and outruns a few luxury rivals. If bang for the buck is your top priority, however, similar money buys the considerably quicker BMW M235i. Another $9,000 gets a TTS, whose turbo 2.0-liter makes 292 hp and 280 pounds-feet of torque. That’s good for zero-to-60-mph sprints of 4.6 seconds, Audi says.\n\nThe TT steers with good feedback and direct, clean motions, and the chassis’ handling puts to bed years of nose-heavy reputation. Audi roughly maintained the TT’s spry curb weight with the redesign — the coupe weighs less than 3,200 pounds — and the standard all-wheel drive (Quattro) has a rear bias in Dynamic mode. Understeer, when present, is slight, and the TT rotates into a nice drift as you feed gas through sweeping turns. You can slide the tail with some lift-throttle, too, and it’s a controllable sensation without any undue squirreling. (Undue Squirreling is opening for Jagged Light Band. No cover ’til 10.)\n\nOn paper, the TT’s longer wheelbase should mitigate the prior generation’s tendency for bounciness. In practice, ride quality is still firm, though one editor said he found it fine for the class. Undulating stretches of highway subject the cabin to slight but constant turbulence, with a lot of road and wind noise to boot. It’s enough to drown out the TT’s optional Bang & Olufsen premium stereo, which sounds unremarkable to start with, as B&O systems go.\n\nOur test car had optional 19-inch wheels, so it’s possible the standard 18s and their higher-profile tires soften things up. The 19s are the sole choice on the TTS, but it gets an adaptive suspension, versus the TT’s fixed setup. Considering that the ride quality among similarly priced alternatives — like the BMW 2 Series and Z4, or the Lexus RC 350 — ranges from livable to generous, the TT could stand more refinement.\n\nInterior\nMinimalism overtakes the interior, which packages all multimedia into a massive instrument display in place of traditional gauges. We’ll detail that in the next section. What’s left is an asymmetric expanse of wraparound materials and tucked-away controls. It’s a stark contrast to the layered dashboards overtaking the industry (see Lexus), for better or worse. Materials are impressive and consistent, with generous padding wherever your arms or knees end up — including the doors, an area Audi often gives the short shrift.\n\nThe optional S Sport seats (standard on the TTS) have tight side bolsters that aren’t for everyone. Non-sport seats with leather and Alcantara simulated suede upholstery are standard, as are power adjusters and seat heaters. (Full leather is optional.) The cabin is tight, but Audi makes good use of the space. The front seats have lengthy adjustment range, and the low center tunnel opens up more inboard knee room than in some cars twice this size. The rear seats, however, are barely fit for children, let alone adults, and they lack head restraints. Toddlers will need high-back booster seats to protect against whiplash.\n\nThe TT Roadster does away with the backseat altogether.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nAudi’s standard “virtual cockpit” throws all functions, from audio to navigation, onto a 12.3-inch instrument display ahead of the steering wheel. It takes some getting used to, and it’s certainly not friendly for passengers. Drivers can accomplish most functions through the steering-wheel controls or Audi’s console-mounted MMI controller. I experienced a moderate learning curve, but another editor found the setup a cinch.\n\nIt’s not the first time an automaker has thrown most of a car’s multimedia into the gauges. The erstwhile Chrysler Pacifica housed its navigation system within the speedometer, and that was nearly a decade ago. But Audi’s kitchen-sink philosophy is unique, complete with a virtual tachometer and speedometer that you can minimize (though they’re still visible) to open up the space for a larger navigation map or another menu. As such, the map itself can span massive proportions, with scrolling and zooming via a finger pad on the MMI knob. It’s a rich format, though the map could use a few more street labels and faster menu transitions.\n\nThe layout has physical limitations. You have to position the steering wheel higher than you might like to avoid obstructing the screen with the rim. Audi also throws the optional backup camera in there, so if you turn the wheel to back around a corner, the wheel spokes themselves can become an obstruction.\n\nThe virtual cockpit is standard, as are Bluetooth phone and audio streaming, plus HD and satellite radio. The navigation system and Audi Connect, which includes an in-car, subscription-based 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot, are optional.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe TT coupe has 12 cubic feet of cargo space behind the rear seats, enough to fit a surprising amount of luggage. The rear seats fold in a 50/50 split for additional room, though Audi doesn’t specify a maximum volume figure, and the hatchback’s liftgate allows plenty of loading space. Not so for the TT Roadster, whose conventional trunk is much smaller, just 7.5 cubic feet. At least the convertible top stows in a separate compartment, leaving the cargo area undiminished when the top is down.\n\nCabin storage amounts to a small center console bin under the center armrest and a glove compartment, but also a useful bin ahead of the gearshift and a storage drawer under the front-passenger seat. Stash away, but figure out what to do with that second travel mug, because there’s only one exposed cupholder. A second holder deploys from the center console if you open the top and crook your elbow in. It’s as convenient as it sounds.\n\nSafety\nThe TT has not been crash-tested, and its small sales volume makes tests unlikely. See a full list of safety features here. Rear parking sensors are standard, but a backup camera is optional. So is a blind spot warning system. Forward collision and lane departure warning systems are unavailable, however.\n\nValue in Its Class\nPriced from about $44,000 for a base TT to about $60,000 for a loaded TTS, the Audi TT straddles a couple segments. Roadster shoppers might also consider the BMW Z4 or Mercedes-Benz SLK-Class, while coupe alternatives range from BMW’s 2 Series to the Lexus RC 350 and even Audi’s own A5. All five cars have average transaction prices in the TT’s ballpark.\n\nAudi offers a tech-packed, nimble alternative whose styling should age pretty well. The new TT is a driver’s car, flawed in some ways but excellent in others. Audi has a jewel on its hands, but it still needs to polish a few blemishes.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in November 2015 about the 2016 Audi TT, but little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2017, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years. \n\nExterior & Styling\n\nThis marks just the second redesign in more than 15 years for the TT, and it’s a subtler makeover than the one in early 2007. Complete with the same wide, grinning expression as its predecessor, the TT is an exercise in restraint. The differences are in the details: Audi’s trapezoidal grille is slowly morphing into a hexagon, and the TT adds some angles to the framework. The brand’s four-ringed logo sits on the hood, no longer the grille, and the full-LED headlights create a quasi-angry expression of jagged light bands. (Not to be confused with Jagged Light Band, which plays Thursdays at Jimmy’s.)\n\nOverall dimensions shrink a tad versus the second-gen TT, though the wheelbase gains a significant 1.4 inches. Eighteen-inch alloy wheels and dual tailpipes are standard. The TTS adds quad pipes and some unique bumper work — all tasteful, fortunately. At least for now there is no TTS roadster, which the prior-gen TT offered.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThe TT’s 220-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder unleashes smooth, strong revving and a satisfying wave of torque (258 pounds-feet) along most of the tachometer’s rev range. Unfortunately, the whole experience comes in timid spurts: Editors agreed the accelerator exhibits considerable lag, and the dual-clutch automatic wants to upshift as soon as possible and resist kickdown until your foot is halfway to the floor.\n\nAudi’s configurable driving modes include a Dynamic setting that tempers some of the accelerator lag, while a Sport mode on the gearshift dials back the upshift tendency to keep you in lower gears more often. Call up Dynamic and Sport and the TT responds like a proper sports car — but that’s a characteristic it should default to. For whatever reason, too many allegedly sporty cars introduce all kinds of lag in their standard drivetrain modes. Audi is as guilty as the rest.\n\nA manual transmission, which could minimize or perhaps eliminate these frustrations, remains unavailable.\n\nAudi says the TT coupe hits 60 mph in 5.3 seconds (5.6 seconds for the roadster), which rivals the prior-gen TT and outruns a few luxury rivals. If bang for the buck is your top priority, however, similar money buys the considerably quicker BMW M235i. Another $9,000 gets a TTS, whose turbo 2.0-liter makes 292 hp and 280 pounds-feet of torque. That’s good for zero-to-60-mph sprints of 4.6 seconds, Audi says.\n\nThe TT steers with good feedback and direct, clean motions, and the chassis’ handling puts to bed years of nose-heavy reputation. Audi roughly maintained the TT’s spry curb weight with the redesign — the coupe weighs less than 3,200 pounds — and the standard all-wheel drive (Quattro) has a rear bias in Dynamic mode. Understeer, when present, is slight, and the TT rotates into a nice drift as you feed gas through sweeping turns. You can slide the tail with some lift-throttle, too, and it’s a controllable sensation without any undue squirreling. (Undue Squirreling is opening for Jagged Light Band. No cover ’til 10.)\n\nOn paper, the TT’s longer wheelbase should mitigate the prior generation’s tendency for bounciness. In practice, ride quality is still firm, though one editor said he found it fine for the class. Undulating stretches of highway subject the cabin to slight but constant turbulence, with a lot of road and wind noise to boot. It’s enough to drown out the TT’s optional Bang & Olufsen premium stereo, which sounds unremarkable to start with, as B&O systems go.\n\nOur test car had optional 19-inch wheels, so it’s possible the standard 18s and their higher-profile tires soften things up. The 19s are the sole choice on the TTS, but it gets an adaptive suspension, versus the TT’s fixed setup. Considering that the ride quality among similarly priced alternatives — like the BMW 2 Series and Z4, or the Lexus RC 350 — ranges from livable to generous, the TT could stand more refinement.\n\nInterior\n\nMinimalism overtakes the interior, which packages all multimedia into a massive instrument display in place of traditional gauges. We’ll detail that in the next section. What’s left is an asymmetric expanse of wraparound materials and tucked-away controls. It’s a stark contrast to the layered dashboards overtaking the industry (see Lexus), for better or worse. Materials are impressive and consistent, with generous padding wherever your arms or knees end up — including the doors, an area Audi often gives the short shrift.\n\nThe optional S Sport seats (standard on the TTS) have tight side bolsters that aren’t for everyone. Non-sport seats with leather and Alcantara simulated suede upholstery are standard, as are power adjusters and seat heaters. (Full leather is optional.) The cabin is tight, but Audi makes good use of the space. The front seats have lengthy adjustment range, and the low center tunnel opens up more inboard knee room than in some cars twice this size. The rear seats, however, are barely fit for children, let alone adults, and they lack head restraints. Toddlers will need high-back booster seats to protect against whiplash.\n\nThe TT Roadster does away with the backseat altogether.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nAudi’s standard “virtual cockpit” throws all functions, from audio to navigation, onto a 12.3-inch instrument display ahead of the steering wheel. It takes some getting used to, and it’s certainly not friendly for passengers. Drivers can accomplish most functions through the steering-wheel controls or Audi’s console-mounted MMI controller. I experienced a moderate learning curve, but another editor found the setup a cinch.\n\nIt’s not the first time an automaker has thrown most of a car’s multimedia into the gauges. The erstwhile Chrysler Pacifica housed its navigation system within the speedometer, and that was nearly a decade ago. But Audi’s kitchen-sink philosophy is unique, complete with a virtual tachometer and speedometer that you can minimize (though they’re still visible) to open up the space for a larger navigation map or another menu. As such, the map itself can span massive proportions, with scrolling and zooming via a finger pad on the MMI knob. It’s a rich format, though the map could use a few more street labels and faster menu transitions.\n\nThe layout has physical limitations. You have to position the steering wheel higher than you might like to avoid obstructing the screen with the rim. Audi also throws the optional backup camera in there, so if you turn the wheel to back around a corner, the wheel spokes themselves can become an obstruction.\n\nThe virtual cockpit is standard, as are Bluetooth phone and audio streaming, plus HD and satellite radio. The navigation system and Audi Connect, which includes an in-car, subscription-based 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot, are optional.\n\nCargo & Storage\n\nThe TT coupe has 12 cubic feet of cargo space behind the rear seats, enough to fit a surprising amount of luggage. The rear seats fold in a 50/50 split for additional room, though Audi doesn’t specify a maximum volume figure, and the hatchback’s liftgate allows plenty of loading space. Not so for the TT Roadster, whose conventional trunk is much smaller, just 7.5 cubic feet. At least the convertible top stows in a separate compartment, leaving the cargo area undiminished when the top is down.\n\nCabin storage amounts to a small center console bin under the center armrest and a glove compartment, but also a useful bin ahead of the gearshift and a storage drawer under the front-passenger seat. Stash away, but figure out what to do with that second travel mug, because there’s only one exposed cupholder. A second holder deploys from the center console if you open the top and crook your elbow in. It’s as convenient as it sounds.\n\nSafety\n\nThe TT has not been crash-tested, and its small sales volume makes tests unlikely. See a full list of safety features here. Rear parking sensors are standard, but a backup camera is optional. So is a blind spot warning system. Forward collision and lane departure warning systems are unavailable, however.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nPriced from about $44,000 for a base TT to about $60,000 for a loaded TTS, the Audi TT straddles a couple segments. Roadster shoppers might also consider the BMW Z4 or Mercedes-Benz SLK-Class, while coupe alternatives range from BMW’s 2 Series to the Lexus RC 350 and even Audi’s own A5. All five cars have average transaction prices in the TT’s ballpark.\n\nAudi offers a tech-packed, nimble alternative whose styling should age pretty well. The new TT is a driver’s car, flawed in some ways but excellent in others. Audi has a jewel on its hands, but it still needs to polish a few blemishes.",

      "expert_review": "I have fallen in love with this automotive bon-bon.\n\nYes, I know that the Audi TT Roadster is based on the rather ordinary Golf/Jetta/New Beetle chassis. Yes, I know that you can equip a New Beetle Convertible with the same turbocharged 1.8-liter four-cylinder that powers the TT, and come close to the TT’s performance for less money.\n\nBut the TT has the classic configuration that the New Beetle lacks: two seats, a top that folds and a trunk big enough for a couple of weekend bags.\n\nPlus the TT has handling that makes it a summertime treat.\n\nBut before the gushing begins, a word about how this car can be equipped.\n\nThe Audi TT Roadster, like the TT Coupe, comes equipped in two ways for 2003: front-wheel-drive with a 180-horsepower turbocharged four-cylinder and a six-speed Tiptronic automatic transmission or an all-wheel-drive version with the same motor bumped to 225-horsepower and a six-speed manual transmission.\n\nAudi provided a front-wheel-drive Roadster version for testing. (A Quattro TT was unavailable.)\n\nConsidering the TT is less than 160 inches long, its 3,131 pound curb weight seems heavy. But the drivetrain still allows a respectable 0-60 mph time of 8.1 seconds, according to Audi. Pop for the all-wheel-drive Quattro and this time drops to 6.7 seconds, with the weight approaching 3,500 pounds.\n\nThe Tiptronic has six gears in the 2003 model, a rarity at any price. One wonders if all these gears are really necessary. The car feels sleepy and not a whole lot of fun when left to shift for itself.\n\nThankfully, the Tiptronic allows for manual shifting, which makes the car come alive. The engine can hit its sweet spot, right around 3,500-4,000 rpms. Shifts are activated quickly, with little lagtime. This gearbox seems happier in the TT than it did in other VW vehicles.\n\nOne would expect good handling and on that score, the TT delivers.\n\nBecause the Audi TT test vehicle was front-wheel-drive, I wouldn’t expect it to beat rear-drive competitors such as the BMW Z4 or Porsche Boxster on the track. But in the cut and thrust of daily driving, this little Audi acquits itself quite well. Quick steering, minimal body lean and petite size add up to a great deal of fun. And that front-wheel-drive makes it practical in all four seasons.\n\nAudi has included anti-lock-brakes and Electronic Stability Program to ensure traction.\n\nThe ride is better than you’d expect, considering the car’s short wheelbase. Bumps are noticed, but well-absorbed. Cowl-shake is non-existent, and the car’s tight feel is evidence of it weight.\n\nOne downside is the constant engine drone, even at idle. It just didn’t sound sporty. At speed, it is less noticeable.\n\nOn the plus side is a top that’s quick and easy to lower. Unlatch a single lever and hold down a bu tton, the top lowers. The top is unlined, surprising considering the vehicle’s price. A glass rear window with defogger is standard. So too is a glass wind-blocker, which is situated behind the passenger compartment. It raises at a push of a button and was very effective.\n\nCabin accommodations are pleasing.\n\nAudi has designed an instrument panel that has the feel of a modern classic, using circles as its theme. Large round gauges are nestled under a semi-circular hood. Large round buttons are situated in the center of the dash, which is accented by large round air vents. It’s all easy to use as well as admire. While the design is admirable, some of the grained cheap plastic was not.\n\nThe Roadster uses the coupe’s back seat space for top storage, so the Roadster only has room for two. The seats are firm, comfortable and well-bolstered.\n\nWhile leg and headroom seemed generous, interior storage seemed skimpy. There is a shoulder-height compartment just aft of the driver, but it doesn’t lock. The glove compartment does, but its space is minimal. Cupholders, located at the far end of the center console, are an afterthought.\n\nCargo space is good considering the size of the car, and the trunk is usefully shaped.\n\nFuel economy, at just under 23 mpg, was about what you would expect from this car’s drivetrain. Audi recommends using premium fuel.\n\nWith a starting price of $34,500, the Roadster promises a lot of fun and exclusivity at the price of a dull SUV.\n\nThe test car added a sweet-sounding Bose Audio System with 6-CD changer for $1,200, a power folding top for $800, a Premium Package, consisting of heated seats, Xenon headlights and remote garage door openers, for $1,100 and 17-inch cast alloy wheels for $550. Bottom line was $38,810.\n\nIt’s a lot of fun in a stylish coupe with good speed and decent fuel economy.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe Audi TT gets more power in 2011. There are some minor exterior changes, but the big news is under the hood. The higher-performing TTS model also gets some updates for 2011, as well.\n\n(Skip to details on the: TTS)\n\nExterior\nThe biggest change to the TT for 2011 is sleeker bumpers as well as new radiator and fog-lamp grilles. Otherwise, the TT looks similar to the previous model, both in coupe and convertible forms.\n\nInterior\nAs is the case with the exterior, the changes inside the TT are fairly mild. There are new aluminum accents for the steering wheel, center console and door liner, plus other small tweaks throughout the cabin.\n\nThe TT coupe has front bucket seats and a small rear seat. The large rear hatch opens to a cargo space that Audi says can carry two golf bags. The TT roadster is a two-seater. Drivers face two large, round gauges behind a flat-bottom, multifunction steering wheel. There are metal pedals, and the interior vents are trimmed in aluminum.\n\nUnder the Hood\nHere’s the big news: The new base engine is a 211 horsepower, 2.0-liter four cylinder that makes and 258 pounds-feet of torque — a major bump from the outgoing model’s 200 hp and 207 pounds-feet of torque. It’s mated to a dual-clutch transmission. The 3.2-liter V-6 engine has been dropped.\n\nSafety\nStandard features include side-impact airbags,, four-wheel-disc antilock brakes and an electronic stability system.\n\nTTS\nThe TTS is Audi’s high-performance version of the TT. Available in roadster and coupe versions, both with all-wheel drive, the TTS is powered by a 265-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine with 258 pounds-feet of torque.

      "expert_review": "NEW YORK — Mary Anne, my wife, called it the “age extractor, a car that makes you feel younger the moment you get into it.”\n\nBut she had to bring lots of stuff to New York for an Easter week celebration. There was no way that the front-wheel-drive Audi TT 2.0 coupe, although it has been stretched and widened a bit for 2008, could hold Mary Anne’s largess.\n\nWe turned over the keys to Ria Manglapus, my associate in vehicle evaluations.\n\nRia was ecstatic, as evidenced by her first text message about the TT.\n\n“Hot and sexy car!” she wrote. She was getting favorable looks, especially from women drivers, some of whom thought the TT was “gorgeous.”\n\nI laughed.\n\nRia has two growing boys. She carts them everywhere. “Hot and sexy” was about to collide with sons Bori and Q, who, like many teenage boys, put a premium on leg space and ease of entry and exit. So, I wasn’t surprised to get Ria’s next text message: “Q is having a hard time getting in and out of the back seat.”\n\nAnd there you have it, the reason hot little coupes such as the TT are loved by many but bought by few. They are classic examples of the conflict between fantasy and reality, “me” cars in a life where “we” matters most, escapemobiles in a world strangled by traffic congestion.\n\nThus, the best way to enjoy the TT is alone. This has been true since the car’s inception in 1995, when it was mostly a reconfigured Volkswagen Golf with Porsche pretensions. It’s true now, when the vastly redesigned TT is riding on its own platform and imbued with a distinct Audi personality, evidenced by its wide-mouthed grille.\n\nThe TT is first and foremost a driver’s car — in this iteration equipped with a turbocharged two-liter, in-line four-cylinder, 200-horsepower engine, one that requires premium unleaded gasoline. It has four seats, but the rear seats are mere afterthoughts. At least one of the Manglapus brothers was bound to complain sitting back there.\n\nThe front passenger’s seat offers ample comfort. But it is best left unfilled. As I said, the TT is a driver’s car, a road nut’s sanctuary, a tufted place where those of us who love driving simply for the sake of driving can retreat while moving forward.\n\nThis has always been the case for cars such as the TT — little coupes and roadsters designed and developed solely for the pleasure of the driver. They are inherently selfish automobiles, engineered to respond quickly to the driver’s input, as the TT does so wonderfully well. They are designed to thrill, to bring a broad smile to the face of the driver while rounding a curve at speed, perfectly confident in a car that is perfectly balanced.\n\nCars such as the TT speak to our inner control freak. That is why Mary Anne, an elegantly mature woman and elementary school teacher, abandoned all of the other metal in our Virginia driveway to get behind the wheel of the red TT 2.0 coupe. She is a woman who steadfastly has resisted every entreaty, every effort to get her to drive a car with a manual transmission. That means she is not, by conventional definition, an automotive enthusiast.\n\nBut she could not contain her enthusiasm for the TT 2.0 coupe when she learned it was equipped with a six-speed transmission that could be used automatically and manually.\n\n“The keys, please!” she demanded, and off she went.\n\nRia spends her days caring for a large family, working for The Washington Post, for me, and teaching tai chi at a community center. You might say she is a bit overburdened. But behind the wheel of the TT, without the boys, she becomes “hot and . . .” — well, you know the rest. Which is why she almost came to tears when the TT went away.\n\nFantasy and reality, we need both. One helps us escape, at least for a little while, the hardships of the other. Fantasy is expensive, which is why it often comes wrapped in luxury, as is the case with the well-appointed TT 2.0 coupe. Fantasy is impractical, which is why it makes little sense to buy a car such as the TT 2.0 coupe with expectations of maximum utility. Fantasy speaks to hope and joy — the hope that there is an unencumbered road somewhere, and the joy when that rarity is found behind the wheel of a hot and sexy little car.",

      "expert_review": "Who knew that Volkswagen’s upscale Audi division could take the underpinnings of such a prosaic vehicle as the VW Golf and turn it into a mini-missile like the 2005 Audi TT Coupe Quattro DSG6?\n\nAnd who figured that such a transformation would inflate the sticker to more than $40,000? Which begs another question: Is this German-engineered, Hungarian-built compact sports car as good as an all-American Chevrolet Corvette?\n\nWe tested a well-equipped TT Coupe Quattro with only a few options and a list price of $43,175.\n\nHE: Visually, the TT hasn’t changed much for 2005. It still has the same sensuous, iconic shape, and the cabin still features the same Bauhaus style, with lots of black leather and matte-metal trim. What set the new TT apart from the rest of the pack are the twin-cam 3.2-liter V-6 engine and the new six-speed direct sequential gearbox, known as DSG. That powertrain combination really rocks in the TT. The engine makes 250 horsepower and, in the Quattro variant, drives all four wheels. The DSG is cool because it’s an automatic that can be shifted manually through the Tiptronic-style shift lever on the console or via two paddle shifters behind the steering wheel. The gearbox automatically makes the gear changes much faster than you could shift a conventional manual transmission with a clutch.\n\nSHE: Lightning-fast shift changes? And also a lightning-like price increase, considering the standard front-wheel-drive TT with a turbocharged four-cylinder engine and a six-speed manual costs less than $35,000. So what you’re saying is that it’s going to cost a lot more money for you to tweak your toy.\n\nHE: Well, honey, you know boys and their toys. Cars like this are hardly ever a rational purchase, at least for men.\n\nSHE: But I have to wonder if the TT is too cute for such a high-tech, gear head feature like the DSG. It’s a philosophical question that you don’t have to answer. I’ve always loved the TT’s memorable exterior, but I think the monochromatic black cabin on our test vehicle looked very masculine, with the metallic touches and exposed screw heads. Isn’t that sending a mixed message to buyers?\n\nHE: Sorry, that’s one question too many. Just get in the darn thing and drive and all your questions will be answered, dear.\n\nSHE: I did that. Don’t you remember when I peeled out of here in the middle of one workday afternoon? I drove the TT up to Port Huron and back. Frankly, I could probably live without the DSG, which seems rather superfluous on American roads with their lower speed limits. Audi does offer a simpler six-speed Tiptronic automatic for those who don’t want to shift manually and don’t want to spend the extra money on the fancy sequential transmission. They would have done better to improve the cup holders, which are two strange little metal rings behind the front passenger’s elbow that are too far back to be useful. And what about those cramped rear seats? Also useless.\n\nHE: I have some beefs of my own that date back to the original TT, which Audi has never addressed and probably won’t until the car is redesigned in a year or two. One is the acute lack of space, even in the front, where that wide center console steals way too much knee room. And this remains one of the very few hardtops on which I consistently whack my head getting in and out. The wide rear pillars don’t help much with visibility, either. The bottom line is that the sensational design extracts a steep penalty in terms of comfort. That’s just one of the reasons I’d prefer a Corvette if I had this kind of money to spend on a sports car. That and 150 more horsepower.\n\nSHE: I am impressed by the standard safety equipment on the TT. You get thorax and head side air bags, antilock brakes and stability control. I also love the fact that the backlit gauges on the instrument panel really pop at night. But like you, I was uncomfortable with the visibility. It’s even hard to back out of your own driveway. If Audi wanted to go all fancy and high-tech, why not spend some money on backup cameras and video monitors?\n\nAnita and Paul Lienert are partners in Lienert & Lienert, a Detroit-based automotive information services company.",

      "expert_review": "Audi TT a joy to drive\n\nThe Audi TT remains a styling icon four years after its introduction. Inside and out, the tiny 2+2 coupe is a design tour de force.\n\nTo help keep the flame alive for enthusiasts, Audi each year has made small, and sometimes not so small, adjustments to its winning formula. For model year 2004, the TT is available with a 250-horsepower 3.2-liter V-6 and a unique six-speed transmission called DSG (for direct-shift gearbox) that can be shifted automatically or manually via two small paddles on the steering wheel.\n\nWe tested a TT Quattro with all-wheel drive and a handful of options that was priced at $44,190.\n\nHE: I’ve had a love-hate relationship with the TT since it was first unveiled in 1999, but far more love than hate. The TT is simply one of the most beautiful automotive designs ever to reach production. It not only has a clean, uncluttered and exquisite shape, but Audi seems to have paid attention to every small design detail in the cabin. The end result is something of a rarity in the auto business, a car that hangs together in every respect, whose interior and exterior seem to have been created in perfect harmony with each other. But I still don’t fit very well in the darn thing.\n\nSHE: I have two words for you, Atkins diet. Although I have to admit that, just like you, I kept banging my head on the top of the door frame whenever I got in and out of the car.\n\nHE: That bothered me, but I also had niggling problems with a lack of legroom and a roofline that dips so low in front, you have to crane your neck to see stoplights. Visibility and space issues aside, I really had a terrific time driving the TT, even with six to eight inches of snow on the ground. The Quattro all-wheel-drive system is pretty amazing, especially in combination with electronic stability control. The TT always seemed to find secure footing, and it seemed nearly impossible to spin the car out. It made me wonder: Who needs a sport-utility vehicle in Michigan winters?\n\nSHE: I still think you need more than one vehicle in your garage if you own the TT. My concern is that, with that flashy Imola Yellow color we had, there were some places where I was unwilling to go in the TT. I just was worried about it getting stolen or keyed, which is a really sad thing to say. But I think it’s a fact of life. So the TT may be better suited for long, wonderful, weekend driving trips, but not necessarily everyday driving, where a supplemental SUV or station wagon might be more appropriate. And do you really need all that fancy gearbox technology for your daily commute?\n\nHE: Gee, I thought the direct-shift gearbox was pretty cool. It’s a manual transmission with two clutches that can be shifted automatically. Or you can keep it in manual mode and shift it up or down with the two little paddles that are attached to the steering wheel. The shifts are quick and smooth, with no notice able lag in between, like you get on a conventional manual. You also get pretty outstanding fuel economy . 22 miles per gallon in city driving and 27 on the highway, which is quite respectable for a 250-horsepower six-cylinder engine and all-wheel drive.\n\nSHE: I remember sitting in the TT with you, and both of us remarking how beautiful the interior was. The Audi Web site says the cabin design is “Bauhaus-inspired,” which sent me running for my old art history books and a look at that movement’s industrial lamps and teapots from the Twenties. The TT’s interior design is very true to the simple and subtle philosophy of that avant garde movement. Nothing is wasted, and everything looks perfect.\n\nHE: We’re gushing over the design, but don’t forget that the TT is truly a joy to drive, especially with the new V-6. It has good low-end torque, which makes the normally aspirated six-cylinder better suited for American roads and driving conditions than the turbocharged four cylinder engines that you can also order. And if you find the idea of the high-tech DSG daunting, you can opt for a conventional six-speed manual or Audi’s familiar six-speed automatic Tiptronic transmission, which also can be shifted manually.\n\nSHE: If I can run a Cuisinart, I can manage the DSG. It’s not that daunting.\n\nHE: Can you whip me up a little Atkins treat in that Cuisinart?",

      "expert_review": "We don’t think he’s taking orders, offering zero-percent financing or trying to get the automotive world back on its rails, but if old St. Nick were in the giving mood, we’d be ready to take the keys.\n\nChristmas is about dreaming. Or at least daydreaming of something new to drive.\n\nIt’s about wishing and wondering and hoping what you wished for is going to be parked in the driveway on the morning of the 25th.\n\nWhat’s that commercial running these days?\n\n“We got you a new CD player,” a beaming father tells his wide-eyed daughter on Christmas morning.\n\n“It’s parked in the driveway,” he says.\n\nAnd, vroom, just like that, a new set of wheels is rolling into view.\n\nIf only life were that simple. If only the cars would fit in Santa’s sleigh.\n\nIf they could, we’d have a few suggestions.\n\nThe following five are all cars we’ve enjoyed this year, and wish they’d fit in a stocking or under the tree.\n\nAre they likely to end up in our driveway tomorrow morning? Doubtful.\n\nWould it be a Christmas dream come true? Most definitely.\n\nAudi TT Roadster\n\nIt didn’t take long for Audi to turn its one-time concept car into a permanent head-turner. It took even less time to make it a stunning ride.\n\nIt might not win a race in the quarter-mile. It might not be the most comfortable touring car. And it might not be the truest expression of outright sports sizzle, but you can’t deny this about Audi’s little roadster: From the first turn of the key, it draws unparalleled interest from standers-by.\n\nGawking becomes sport. Finger-pointing becomes fun. And it’s all OK because, with the TT, it’s par for the course.\n\nAvailable with five- and six-speed transmissions, the TT is an exercise in euphoria. Its 1.8-liter, 20-valve turbo four is available in 180 or a six-speed 225 horsepower.\n\nBut it’s so much more than that. From the aluminum twin-hoop roll bars, to optional saddle-tan leather seating and a power-operated wind deflector, the TT roadster might be based on the Volkswagen Golf platform, but it’s so much more. With aluminum tinges throughout, an unconventional setup inside and a throwback-style seat position (that makes you believe you’re sitting in a bathtub), the TT is simply terrific.\n\nThere are less-expensive rivals that perform as well, but for style and features, the TT rivals sports cars that cost thousands more.\n\nChristmas cost: $33,200 (base 2-door convertible)\n\nChristmas message: Fun, daring, stylish and cool. Is there anymore?\n\nBMW Z3 Coupe\n\nCar and Driver called the Z3 coupe, “the face of Henry Kissinger and the moves of Josephine Baker.”\n\nOuch. That’s awfully crude for the holidays.\n\nWe think the beauty of the Z3 coupe rests in the fact its beauty is hardly skin deep.\n\nBased on the roadster of the same name, the best part of this unique two-seat coupe is not its funky frame but its low curb weight and high chassis rigidit y. It’s a fun-to-drive formula. And it’s a Z3 zoooomer.\n\nWith two new powerplants for 2001, the Z3 is available with either a 225-horse 3.0-liter in-line six or a slightly-less powerful version of the new M3’s 333-hp 3.2-liter engine. It’s heck on wheels. And it’s a looker, despite its unusual looks.\n\nInside, the Z3 is like driving a scaled-down version of some of BMW’s more popular products. It’s a tight ride without much room for movement, but with a true driver-to-road feel. Handling is razor-sharp and with BMW’s Dynamic Brake Control, ABS and an antiskid system, braking stability in turns is a lock.\n\nAnd did we mention it’s fun?\n\nChristmas cost: $38,900 (3.0i 2-door hatchback)\n\nChristmas message: Thrilling on the pedal, if not on the eyes, the Z3 might be the most fun BMW on the market.\n\nChevrolet Corvette Z06\n\nJust when you thought the American “wild child” couldn’t get any better, along comes a better Corvette.\n\nPack your seat belt hold onto your hat. What makes the new ‘Vette Z06 a real holiday gift is the fact it’s faster than some Ferraris, more slick than a few Porsches is substantially less money. Now engorged to 405 horsepower, dig into the throttle of the LS6 5.7-liter V-8 and this lightest and most athletic Corvette lunges forward at positively indecent speeds. Even in the 350-hp versions, the combination of control and raw push is enough to snap a few heads back.\n\nAnd that might not even be the best part.\n\nEven with tires fit for NASCAR, the Corvette handles and rides with the best of them. There’s also room for loads of luggage, a tasteful interior, comfortable seats, shorter gearing for better acceleration, grippier tires, a titanium exhaust and full measures of speed and excitement. This easily becomes a can’t-miss speed demon built for every enthusiast’s fancy.\n\nBig, bold and brawny, there’s no better high-performance value. A Christmas hint: Also ask for your own racetrack.\n\nX-mas cost: $48,055 (Z06 2-door coupe)\n\nX-mas message: They don’t build some race cars with this much outright passion.\n\nChrysler Prowler\n\nThe Plymouth name might be long gone, but its retro roadster roars on.\n\nWant to know the Prowler is still going strong? Listen closely as it rumbles down the street.\n\nNothing new here for the car that changed its stripes each season, but little else. It’s pretty much what it was when it first rolled out of Detroit.\n\nThat doesn’t mean it’s any less desirable. And a new color is major news to the Prowler faithful. This year it’s the Black Tie Edition with silver and black two-tone paint and silver floormats. We think it’s just window dressing for a classic.\n\nTurn the key and watch the heads turn. The all-aluminum 253-hp 3.5-liter V6 rumbles to life and cruises with authority, or attitude, down the street. That means 0 to 60 in about six seconds, but this is all about touring.\n\nNo luggage needed. With two cubic feet of rear room under a massive back shell – enough for a thin briefcase – this is a rear-wheel-drive hot-rod meant for a Sunday drive under blue skies.\n\nBuyers still snap them up as fast as Chrysler builds them and for good reason. With a sloped front end, manual soft top and a small, jutting nose, there’s character in this throwback.\n\nX-mas cost: $45,280\n\nX-mas message: Hot-rod retro that carries character like few others.\n\nJaguar XJR 100\n\nJaguar sedans might not be the most practical or technologically advanced set of wheels on the planet, but they’re elegant.\n\nAnd who couldn’t use more elegance in the driveway?\n\nWith tasteful styling, handsome interiors and a lightning rod under your right foot, the XJR is a lesson in deception. Don’t let the wood grain fool you – this is no technological antique. Under the hood, a supercharged and intercooled 4.0-liter DOHC 32-valve V8 makes 370 horses and makes it one of the quickest sedans we’ve dri ven (5.6 seconds in 0-to-60).\n\nAnd you’ll look good at that speed; actually, at any speed. With 18-inch wheels and Brembo brakes supporting a sleek, tasteful and distinguished interior, you can race the Mustang next to you, then race to the black-tie Christmas dinner.\n\nFor all their bulk and length outside (a whopping 202.7inches), the XJR is a little cramped inside, but it shines for its top-notch refinement, potent V8s and British charm.\n\nThe standard for any luxo-charged ride.\n\nX-mas cost: $69,355 (XJR 4-door sedan)\n\nX-mas message: Refined. Respected. And a roaring ride with an obnoxiously-smooth engine.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nAudi’s TT sports car was redesigned for 2008; it’s still a head-turning design despite the influx of other, outlandishly styled models. The TT uses Audi’s Aluminum Space Frame technology and is powered by a turbocharged four-cylinder engine. The TT competes with the BMW Z4 and Nissan 370Z. A high-performance TTS version is also available.\n\n(Skip to details on the: TTS)\n\nNew for 2010\nThe base front-drive model is gone, as are the 3.2-liter V-6 engine and six-speed manual transmission.\n\nExterior\nThe TT sports Audi’s trapezoidal grille, which splits the front bumper. The slit-like headlights and lower grille styling lend the TT a sinister appearance. The TT’s body is 69 percent aluminum and 31 percent steel, with the steel pieces located at the back of the car for optimal weight distribution.\n\nPower-retractable rear spoiler deploys at 75 mph\nWheels available in 18- and 19-inch sizes\n\nInterior\nThe TT coupe has front bucket seats and a small rear seat. The large rear hatch opens to a cargo space that Audi says can carry two golf bags. The TT roadster is a two-seater.\n\nDrivers face two large, round gauges behind a flat-bottom, multifunction steering wheel. There are metal pedals, and the interior vents are trimmed in aluminum.\n\nAutomatic climate control standard\nCD stereo with an MP3 jack standard\nNavigation system available\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe TT’s turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine makes 200 horsepower and 207 pounds-feet of torque. A six-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission that Audi dubs S tronic is standard.\n\nQuattro all-wheel drive standard\nStandard hill-hold assist\n\nSafety\nStandard features include:\n\nSide-impact airbags\nSide curtain airbags (coupe)\nFour-wheel disc antilock brakes\nElectronic stability system\nRoll bars that deploy in a rollover (roadster)\n\nTTS\nThe TTS is Audi’s high-performance version of the TT. Available in roadster and coupe versions, both with all-wheel drive, the TTS is powered by a 265-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine with 258 pounds-feet of torque. The only transmission available is a six-speed dual-clutch automatic. Aside from the hot-rodder powertrain, the TTS also gets a magnetic adaptive suspension with Sport and normal suspension settings.\n\nThe TTS features unique bi-xenon headlamps with LED daytime running lights. There’s also a larger lower air intake up front, lower rocker panels on the sides, a rear diffuser and quad exhaust pipes out back.\n\nAvailable 18- or 19-inch wheels\nStandard leather upholstery\nStandard aluminum interior accents and race-inspired front bucket seats\nStandard paddle shifters\nAvailable heated seats\nOptional Bose audio system Back to top",

      "expert_review": "So who wants to be a race car driver? Or a professional ballplayer? You conceivably could fulfill both those fantasies in a single set of wheels – Audi’s 2001 TT Roadster with the optional “baseball optic” seats. We tested the tamer version of the soft top TT earlier this summer and couldn’t find much to complain about. This time around, we’ve sampled the more aggressive 225-horsepower variant with all the bells and whistles. The penalty for all this performance is a stiff $42,725. But, oh, the places you’ll go …\n\nShe: Wow, those seats are the coolest in the industry, bar none. They’re amber red leather with so-called “baseball glove” stitching. The seats are a great conversation piece, of course, but they’re also an excellent example of the trend toward more personalization in cars. I don’t think they’re gimmicky at all, they’re wonderful. With those seats and all that power, the Audi TT Roadster has to be one of the top 10 vehicles of 2001.\n\nHe: Good thing you’re not prone to hyperbole. You were beginning to gush like Roger Ebert.\n\nShe: Hey, we’ve seen the cult of the TT springing up since the coupe was first introduced in mid-1999. Owners are almost rabid about these cars. I talked to a woman in Colorado who owns a black TT coupe that she named Merlin. She said it’s better than any boyfriend she’s ever had.\n\nHe: This test drive is taking an ugly turn. For the record, dear, I just want to say that you’re definitely better than any car I’ve ever had. Of course, I’ve owned some clunkers. But I’m really starting to warm up to the TT, even though I still have trouble fitting into the darn thing. Features like all-wheel drive, a six-speed gearbox and a slick turbocharged twin-cam engine are starting to make a believer out of me. You just can’t help but have fun in this car, with the top up or down.\n\nShe: That’s what I’m trying to say. Audi has really cemented that emotional involvement that people have with the TT. It’s the type of relationship you tend to have only once in a lifetime with a man or an automobile.\n\nHe: How existential. Let’s talk some more about esthetics. Compared to some of the pricier convertibles in this segment, like the Honda S2000 and the BMW Z3, the TT is just plain sensuous. That gorgeous nimbus gray pearl exterior paint scheme just accentuates the car’s curves. In fact, it’s hard to believe that the TT started life on the same basic platform as the Volkswagen Beetle. It’s truly amazing how Audi has created this beautiful shape, then pumped it full of steroids.\n\nShe: You’re paying the price, however. For about the same money, you can get a Porsche Boxster, if that particular brand name turns you on. And the TT does have its downside. During the week that we drove it, there were at least two times I left the car sitting in the driveway while I drove something else. When I did some major grocery shopping for the first time in two weeks, I wasn’t sure I could fit everything into that tiny trunk. And when I went to the airport to pick you up, I didn’t think I could squeeze you and all your luggage into the TT.\n\nHe: Squeeze is the operative word. You don’t feel the pinch so badly when the top is down, and the whole driving experience feels like pure magic. But snap that top back into place, and you begin to get a tad claustrophobic. Visibility really suffers then, although headroom wasn’t as much of a problem as I thought it would be.\n\nShe: With the top up, I had trouble backing out of a tight parking space, where I was hemmed in by a pickup truck and a big SUV. That’s an issue that you’re going to have to deal with. From a practical point of view, you probably are going to need a second car, just to run all your weekly errands.\n\nHe: I suspect someone who can afford the TT Roadster probably is considering this as a second, third or fourth car. Just make sure you have enough room in your garage next to the Suburban the F-150.\n\nAnita’s rating: World class\n\nPaul’s rating: Above average\n\nLikes: Visually stunning. Intense performance. Fashionably fun to drive. One of the safest sports cars on the road. Wonderful $1,000 “baseball optic” seats.\n\nDislikes: Cramped for six-footers. Visibility is a problem with the top up. As with most ragtops, not much storage space. Not very practical as an everyday car. Rarified $40,000-plus price tag.\n\nType: Front-engine, all-wheel drive, two-passenger convertible.\n\nPrice: Base, $38,550; as tested, $42,725 (incl. $525 destination charge)\n\nEngine: 1.8-liter I-4; 225-hp; 207 lb-ft torque\n\nEPA fuel economy: 20 mpg city/28 mpg highway\n\n12-month insurance cost, according to AAA Michigan: $1,516 (Estimate. Rates may vary, depending on coverage and driving record.)\n\nWhere built: Gyor, Hungary",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nAudi introduced its stylishly sporty TT four-place coupe for the 2000 model year. A two-passenger roadster arrived later. A six-speed-automatic transmission in 180-horsepower front-wheel-drive models became available in 2003; until then, TTs only came with manual gearboxes.\n\nThe TT is also offered with permanently engaged quattro all-wheel drive and a 225-hp turbocharged four-cylinder. A more potent V-6 version with a Direct Shift sequential manual gearbox that uses steering-wheel paddles to change ratios debuted in 2004. Other than a new red interior color choice in coupe models, little has changed for 2006.\n\nExterior\nShort front and rear overhangs and what Audi calls a “low, fastback greenhouse” above a high belt line set the styling tone. The TT flaunts unique, rounded styling and an attention-grabbing appearance.\n\nAll TT models are 159.1 inches long overall and 53 inches tall. Six-spoke cast-aluminum wheels hold 17-inch tires. All-season and 18-inch tires are optional for quattro models. Ground clearance measures a mere 4.4 inches.\n\nQuattro-equipped roadsters have a power top with a heated glass window, while the 180-hp front-drive convertible gets a manually operated fabric roof; power operation is an option. All roadsters have a power-retractable glass wind blocker between the structural roll bars, which sit behind the headrests.\n\nThe 250-hp TT adds a raised front apron with side gills and enlarged inlet openings. A bigger rear spoiler and honeycomb-pattern diffuser help reduce rear-end lift.\n\nInterior\nFront-seat occupants sit low, which makes it necessary to twist and turn when entering and exiting the coupe because of its sloping roof pillars. The coupe’s backseat is essentially token space. Roadsters seat only two people. Nappa leather upholstery and automatic climate control are standard.\n\nOne roadster option includes leather upholstery with unique “Baseball Optic” stitching. Audi’s navigation system and a Premium Package that features heated front seats are available.\n\nUnder the Hood\nBase front-drive models carry a 180-hp, turbocharged 1.8-liter four-cylinder, which mates to a six-speed-automatic transmission that includes a manual-shift provision. Higher-performance models hold a 225-hp turbo four-cylinder, a six-speed manual and quattro all-wheel drive. Only a sequential manual transmission, called the Direct Shift Gearbox, is available with the 250-hp, 3.2-liter V-6. That gearbox pre-selects the next ratio, and the change takes place under load.\n\nSafety\nAudi’s Electronic Stabilization Program, all-disc antilock brakes, and seat-mounted head and chest side-impact airbags are standard.\n\nDriving Impressions\nNot many cars express more visual appeal than the TT, but its low roofline yields a cramped cockpit. The TT’s handling is a prime attraction. Steering demands some effort, but the TT reacts quickly and goes just where you want it. The ride can get stiff on rough surfaces and some bouncing is likely even on smooth pavement, but the TT turns in an enjoyable road-going experience.\n\n“Masterful” is the best word to describe the six-speed gearbox. The clutch can be a bit grabby, but the TT offers an appealing blend of gearing and clutch behavior. Acceleration with the 180-hp engine is reasonably satisfying, but the TT is even more alluring when equipped with quattro and the stronger 1.8-liter four-cylinder that pumps out an additional 45 hp.",

      "expert_review": "The difference between rich and poor consumers is the manner in which their confidence is rewarded. That much became clear to me and my associate for vehicle evaluations, Ria Manglapus, on a recent visit to Audi USA headquarters in Herndon.\n\nWe had gone there as part of a corporate welcome-wagon program. Audi recently moved its U.S. headquarters from the Detroit area to the Washington metropolitan area. It was only fitting that we from The Washington Post drop by to say “hello.” Besides, Audi wanted to show off its latest TT roadster. We find that sort of thing hard to resist.\n\nBut on the way over, we fell into conversation about the economy — the generally dismal nature of it and how it was depressing car sales with one hand and forcing buyers who remained in the market toward more pedestrian, practical choices with the other.\n\nRia and I were resigning ourselves to a 2009 filled with economy cars. The trip to Audi, then, was something of a fillip — a kind of personal stimulus package to help keep us excited about this thing we call the automobile.\n\nIt was worth it.\n\nThe economy’s downward turn threatens to transform the automobile into what aggressive pragmatists have always wanted it to be — a commodity, nothing more or less, something capable of hauling people and their stuff the longest possible distances at the lowest possible prices.\n\nThat is virtuous, and there is value in that virtue. But it isn’t why people who love driving love driving. It isn’t why consumers who can afford to spend more money in pursuit of that love often spend it on cars such as the 2009 Audi TT 3.2 Quattro roadster, which we drove in Herndon and environs.\n\nThere is little that anyone can deem practical or pragmatic about the TT 3.2 Quattro. It is expensive, with a base price in excess of $45,000. It can carry two people and not much of their luggage. It drinks premium unleaded gasoline and does so at the rather alarming rate — for a little two-seater — of 18 miles per gallon in the city and 24 miles per gallon on the highway.\n\nBut if you can accept and afford all of that, you’ll fall madly in love with the TT 3.2 Quattro. Driving it is akin to writing with the finest, most perfectly balanced pen. It feels that good in hand.\n\nThe car’s 3.2-liter, 250-horsepower V-6 runs smoothly, producing an authoritative exhaust note without ever sounding like or behaving as a bully. It just wants to have fun, which it does quite easily with the assistance of a six-speed transmission that can be shifted automatically or manually.\n\nThere’s something else:\n\nRoadsters — small, two-seat, two-door cars with convertible tops — often are fair-weather automobiles, preferably driven in the glory days of spring and summer. They tend to provide more misery than comfort in cold, inclement weather. But the TT 3.2 Quattro is an all-weather smile machine.\n\nThe power convertible roof rises or falls in seconds. When it and the side windows are raised, it locks tightly in place, sealing out cold and moisture. And the “Quattro” part of the TT’s name means that the car is all-wheel-drive, which means it delivers admirable traction on most winter-compromised roads.\n\nThe caveat applies to ice. The TT 3.2 Quattro will get you through moderate-to-heavy rainfalls, assuming the roads are draining well. And it will get you through moderate snowfalls. But untreated, icy roads can cause any vehicle to skid out of control, including the TT 3.2 Quattro.\n\nBut all said, it’s a beautiful car with a well-sculpted body and an impeccably crafted interior — the latter of which can be tailored to buyer’s taste. Our car quite literally fit like a glove, an expensively knitted baseball glove using the finest rawhide.\n\nIt isn’t something that most of us would buy. But the rich are different from most of us. This is a very special little car, a motorized bauble for them. It was fun playing with it for a while.\n\nON WHEELS WITH WARREN BROWN Listen from noon to 1 p.m. Tuesdays on WMET World Radio (1160 AM) or http://www.wmet1160.com.",
