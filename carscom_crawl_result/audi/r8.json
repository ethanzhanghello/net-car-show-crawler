      "expert_review": "The all-wheel-drive R8 is Audi’s flagship sports car and, as such, it is a statement that the company is capable of building a car that challenges cars such as the Porsche 911 Turbo and Lamborghini Gallardo, and does so at a lower price.\nEven though the R8 went on sale last fall, it is already on the way to becoming a sports car icon.\nThe R8’s base price of $109,000 is less than the Porsche and Lamborghini. The test car was equipped with the R tronic automatic transmission that adds $9,000 to the base price.\nIt might seem foolish to write about this car when gasoline is $4 a gallon and the economy is slow, but when the Audi folks offered an R8 from its press pool for a week, I couldn’t resist.\nAside from its traffic-stopping looks, the key to the R8 is the 4.2-liter, 420-horsepower V-8 nestled under its back glass. This high-revving engine has an 8,250-rpm redline that begs to be unleashed, and the six-speed manual transmission is the perfect mate.\nThe R tronic is a six-speed manual with an automatic clutch, and it’s not nearly as smooth or quick-shifting as Audi’s DSG unit. Slip the gear lever into manual mode, shift it with the paddles on the steering wheel and the car begins to feel almost as lively as the six-speed manual\nAudi says the R8 can hit 60 miles per hour in 4.4 seconds, and it has a top track speed of 187 mph.\nThe engine is quite tractable in spite of the fact that it revs so high. It is docile in city traffic, yet it bellows with authority and a rush of speed when you nail the throttle. Fuel economy is rated at 13 miles per gallon in the city and 18 on the highway.\nAudi displayed an R8 powered by a 6.0-liter, 500-horsepower diesel engine at the Detroit auto show in January. Given that diesel engines are extremely popular in Europe and that fuel economy would improve by about one-third, the R8 LeMans could well make it into production.\nThe R8 has stunning styling. The nose is low and wide. The body is stretched tightly over the chassis and the 19-inch wheels. The side blade behind the doors punctuates the R8’s design and is intended to be a visual break that makes the car look smaller. The blade on some R8s is a brightly contrasting color, but the black test car’s dark-gray blade was subtle.\nLast fall, I drove an R8 on a tiny track set up in the parking lot of FedEx Field in Landover, Md. The course was tight enough that we weren’t able to shift beyond second gear, but it was great for demonstrating the R8’s road holding and balance. Even with the traction control disengaged, it was possible to floor the throttle coming out of sharp turns in second gear and not slide sideways.\nAudi’s quattro all-wheel-drive system is a key reason for the R8’s impressive traction in turns. Depending on conditions, between 10 and 35 percent of the power is delivered to the front wheels. That makes the R8 feel like a rear-wheel-drive car, yet sending small amounts of drive to the front wheels enhances stability.\nThe powerful brakes withstood hours of abuse on the tiny track without complaint.\nIn spite of its low wedge shape, the R8 has a surprisingly roomy cabin. It is 75 inches wide, 49.3 inches tall and 174.5 inches long. The wheelbase is 104.3 inches.\nThe R8’s cabin is not only spacious but also beautifully designed. The gauges sit in individual pods, surrounded by a single arch that is intended to mimic a single-seat racer. The seats offer excellent support.\nLuggage space under the front hood is small, but it will hold a couple of duffel bags. There is also room behind the front seats for a briefcase or backpack.\nThe R8 feels relaxed and at home in city traffic. The suspension is firm, yet it is compliant enough to be comfortable on everyday roads. Audi uses adaptive shock absorbers with magnetic fluid, and they can change ride characteristics in milliseconds. The driver can choose standard or sport mode.\nPrice  The test car’s base price was $118,000 with the gas-guzzler tax, navigation system and R-Tronic automatic transmission. Options included a Bang & Olufsen sound system, leather seats, parking sensors, Bluetooth phone preparation and six-disc CD changer. The sticker price was $134,545.\nWarranty  Four years or 50,000 miles.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The Audi R8 offers all the speed, style and sensory overload you expect in a supercar, as well as some of the unwelcome quirks.\n\nVersus the competition: Other supercars at this price offer the same level of speed, traffic-stopping styling, exclusivity and capability, but few offer it in a package that’s as easy to drive every day. It’s not the most comfortable, however, and it still lacks some key safety technologies.\n\nWhat if you could have a Lamborghini Huracán but without the stiffness and uncomfortable driving position that comes with it? A car that maintains the visual punch of the Huracán and puts a wailing V-10 engine behind your head but is compliant enough to drive every day — and is less expensive to boot? Audi says you can find this at its showrooms: the 2017 Audi R8.\n\nComprehensively redesigned for 2017, the R8 is built on the same bones as the Lamborghini Huracán and even shares a 5.2-liter V-10 engine with the Italian supercar (Audi technically owns Lamborghini). After taking a model year off, Audi has redone the R8 for 2017 (compare the 2015 and 2017 models here) and given it some new styling as well as a new interior and transmission. The 2015 model was criticized for its rather unimpressive cabin for an expensive car, as well as for its finicky dual-clutch automatic transmission that didn’t like slower speeds, so the new one has some big challenges to overcome.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe restyled R8 has received some subtle but meaningful updates. New, standard full-LED headlights and a larger grille opening adorn the super-low front end. The sleek styling isn’t as sensual as some other cars in this price range, such as the McLaren 570S, but it’s still so striking in its low-slung form that it will stand out in traffic even if it isn’t painted bright metallic blue, like our test car was. The side blades that have been a defining characteristic of the R8 have been toned down somewhat on the 2017; they no longer span from roof to street but, rather, are broken into two smaller elements. Out back, you can still see the V-10 engine through a glass panel and a new design for the LED taillights finishes things off.\n\nHow It Drives\nIf its racecar styling weren’t enough of a clue about the R8’s nature, any doubts about its supercar status would be put to rest once you punch the start button on the steering wheel. The naturally aspirated, 5.2-liter V-10 fires to life behind your head with a snarling roar before warming up and settling into a muted hum. If muted hum isn’t your thing, you can push another button on the steering wheel to activate the sport exhaust feature, which makes the car’s exhaust tone match its appearance. (I pushed it every single time I drove the car.) Power goes to all four wheels via Audi’s Quattro all-wheel-drive system and a seven-speed, dual-clutch transmission — the only gearbox offered on the R8 now that the manual transmission has been retired.\n\nThe dual-clutch transmission is much better behaved than ones I’ve driven in older R8s, with low-speed behavior that isn’t nearly as springy and finicky as it used to be. Put your foot down and the transmission joins perfectly with the V-10 Plus engine’s massive 610 horsepower to propel you forward like you’ve been catapulted off the deck of an aircraft carrier. It’s almost scary-fast, especially when you push a little checkered flag button on the steering wheel to activate one of three performance modes: Dry, Wet or Snow. There’s also a Drive Select button just above it, which you can use to select Comfort, Dynamic or Auto modes to dial in the adjustable suspension, transmission performance, throttle mapping, etc. Select the right settings and Audi says you can get from zero to 60 mph in 3.2 very blurry seconds.\n\nThe R8’s base engine makes “only” 540 hp from the same 5.2-liter V-10, but one assumes the acceleration experience can’t be that different.\n\nI kept Drive Select in Comfort mode most of the time given the condition of the Michigan roads upon which I was driving. I was rewarded with an excellent combination of acceptably compliant ride quality (though certainly not what you’d call “soft”) and communicative handling. The R8 is just as at home tootling around the streets of your town as it is blasting down the back straight at Road America raceway.\n\nWhen it comes time to bleed off that speed, the R8’s standard carbon-ceramic brakes bring things to a halt in a hurry – and, remarkably, don’t squeal when they’re cold or when you’re navigating city streets. That was a first in my experience for ceramic brakes.\n\nWhile fuel economy isn’t something most supercar owners are overly concerned about, there’s no doubt the R8 is a truly outstanding fuel-to-noise converter. It’s EPA-rated 14/22/17 mpg city/highway/combined, good enough to add a $1,300 gas-guzzler tax to the window sticker. My week with the R8 included nearly 400 miles of highway driving to and from events around Michigan and the car returned an average of 16 mpg, likely due to my heavy right foot. That’s not as competitive as some other hot performers: The Porsche 911 Turbo S is rated 19/24/21 mpg, the McLaren 570S is rated 16/23/19 mpg and the brand-new Acura NSX hybrid is rated an impressive 21/22/21 mpg.\n\nInterior\nPart of the revamp of the 2017 R8 is an all-new interior. It’s a fully modern look that harmonizes the R8 with Audi’s other newest offerings. There’s a surprising amount of room for the two occupants the R8 can hold, with plentiful legroom and enough headroom for taller drivers to sit upright without their hair touching the roof. That roof, however, meets the windshield lower than you might expect, causing everyone to have to dip their heads and bend their necks to see stoplights at intersections. Outward visibility is not the R8’s strongest attribute.\n\nThe version I drove was an R8 V-10 Plus, which comes standard with something new for 2017: rigid racing shell seats. They adjust fore and aft and have electronic height adjustment, but they do not bend or recline; the seatbacks are rigidly locked to the seat bottoms. Thankfully, the angle they’re set at wasn’t uncomfortable for me, but the lack of lumbar or bolstering adjustment was notable. These seats are made for someone very narrow of waist and derriere; anyone more normal-sized will want to either opt for the less-powerful, less-frenetic regular Audi R8 and its far more adjustable seats or spring for the diamond-quilted leather package in the Plus, which brings back the adjustable seats in place of the racing shells.\n\nMaterials quality throughout the car shows a massive upgrade. One of our biggest complaints about the old R8 was that its interior didn’t match its price tag, but there’s no such issue with the 2017 model. It looks and feels exotic and well-made, with an artistry to its shapes and forms that was lacking in the cold, mechanical previous model.\n\nElectronics & Ergonomics\nPerhaps the biggest difference between the old and new models is the switch to Audi’s Virtual Cockpit, which eliminates both the traditional round gauges and the center console’s display screen. Instead, the main gauge cluster is now a huge LCD that’s reconfigurable to one of several gauge patterns and also displays navigation, audio information, various vehicle control menus and even the backup camera.\n\nThe system isn’t as user-friendly as the old Audi Multi Media Interface, however, and comes with some drawbacks. Yes, drivers do have the ability to configure and change around information to best suit their needs and desires, but the passenger no longer has any way to really be involved in this. Asking a passenger to input the navigation system route to a specific destination or find some music while the driver is occupied with driving, for example, becomes difficult when the passenger can’t see the screen. Having the backup camera appear in the gauge cluster also creates problems when you turn while backing up, as the steering wheel obscures a good part of your view. The climate controls are easy to use and stylish to boot, but the rest of the changes haven’t made the Audi’s controls easier to use.\n\nCargo & Storage\nBeing a mid-engine car, the R8 has a frunk (a front trunk). It’s a surprisingly deep well, able to accommodate a large roll-aboard suitcase and some soft-sided duffels — or a trip to the grocery store for a weekend barbeque for 40 people. The R8 features 8 cubic feet of cargo room. That’s much more than its competitors: The Acura NSX only has 4.4 cubic feet, while the McLaren 570S comes with 5.3 cubic feet. The Porsche 911 Turbo S has just 4.1 cubic feet of room, though it also has a vestigial rear seat that can be folded to increase storage room to a total of 13.2 cubic feet of non-contiguous space.\n\nThe R8 does also have some storage room inside its cockpit (it really is more of a cockpit than a passenger cabin). The spot behind the seats can accommodate some smaller items. The R8 can get you to the airport with a decent-sized suitcase, but if you’re bringing another person with more luggage, it’s going to be tight — and forget about anything more than a weekend road trip’s worth of vestments.\n\nSafety\nThe 2017 Audi R8 has not been crash-tested, but if it ever is, the results will be posted here.\n\nDespite an update to a lot of its electrical infrastructure and the addition of some new electronic safety features, the R8 is still missing a couple of key systems, such as blind spot warning, that would be highly useful in a car with such compromised visibility. There’s no automatic distance-keeping cruise control, no forward collision warning system or automatic emergency braking, no lane departure warning or prevention — nothing beyond basic stability control systems and all-wheel drive. See what the R8 does offer here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe elimination of the V-8 R8 means prices have gone up. The base R8 now starts at $165,450 including destination fee, and that gets you a 540-hp V-10 engine, standard all-wheel drive and a loaded performance car with just about everything you need to go fast.\n\nOf course, you can spend more: My test car was a V-10 Plus, which comes with a more powerful, 610-hp engine, additional electronic performance programming, different seats, a slightly different exterior appearance and more for $192,450. On top of that, my model featured Ara Blue metallic paint, a full leather-covered interior (not just the seats), a Bang & Olufsen sound system and 20-inch wheels. Add the gas-guzzler tax and the total came to $199,925. More extra features, such as the more comfortable seats and matte green paint, can option it up to just under $210,000.\n\nThere are some interesting new competitors for the now-more-expensive R8. The most traditional competitor in terms of price and ability is the classic Porsche 911 Turbo S, the top-of-the-line, fastest, most outrageous version of Porsche’s rear-engine coupe. Featuring a turbocharged, 580-hp flat-six engine and a standard seven-speed, dual-clutch transmission, it can keep up with the R8 while offering a more spacious, upright cabin with better visibility.\n\nTwo newcomers are in the mix, too: The first comes from Acura, which debuted its brand-new NSX, a mid-engine, plug-in-hybrid supercar that was designed, engineered and built in Ohio. Starting at just under $160,000, it’s powered primarily by a twin-turbo, 500-hp V-6, but three electric motors bring total system power up to 573 hp. Its styling is every bit as exotic as the R8’s.\n\nFor the price of the Audi, you can get something from an even more exotic brand: the McLaren 570S coupe. It’s also a mid-engine supercar, featuring a twin-turbocharged, 3.8-liter V-8 making 562 hp but sticking with rear-wheel drive only. It may feature the most outrageous styling of the lot, with an interior that’s truly space-age stuff. Compare all four here.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in March 2008 about the 2008 Audi R8. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s changed for 2009, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe Audi R8 doesn’t roll, drive or coast so much as it stalks, and when it stalks toward you, it awakens the senses. It stirs the emotions. It evokes questions, the most likely of which is, “I wonder how that thing drives in snow?”\n\nOK, maybe that’s not the most likely question, but we received our test R8 in February. Anyone who’s been in Chicago in February will concur that it’s a wonderful place not to be, and that’s in a good year. This year, on the other hand, has delivered the most relentless winter of my lifetime, when morning after morning brings a steaming platter of fresh snow swimming in a broth of slush, served up with a bottomless cup of frigid and a side of interminable gloom. And all of that is capped with a drive to work across a landscape pocked by enough Yaris-sized potholes to make the moon’s surface look like a salt flat.\n\nEnvironmentalists will be thrilled to know that the glaciers retreating from the Arctic have reestablished themselves on my driveway. One of these mornings I’m sure to glance out the window and see a polar bear scout surveying the scene and appearing — to the extent that a bear can — optimistic. I wasn’t happy about receiving a supercar in these conditions, but it’s my unofficial rule that when someone offers me a supercar, I take it. My first step was a literal hack at giving the car a place to sit, and I’m pleased to report that hypothermia leaves one with at least enough sense to give up after breaking a sledgehammer on one’s driveway.\n\nAs it turns out, though, my efforts and all the associated concerns turned out to be moot, because the R8 laughed in the face of snow and ice. A brilliant track car, the R8 was also a joy to drive on the street, in conditions both ordinary and extraordinary. This specimen of German engineering blew my lederhosen off. All three pairs.\n\nAn Unlikely Snowmobile\nAudi had the sense to fit our test car with winter boots: Pirelli Sottozero winter performance tires, sized 235/35R19 in front and 295/30R19 in the rear, which are the same size as the standard summer tires. I’ve long sung the praises of winter tires, and apparently when you put four of them on a car with Quattro all-wheel drive and an electronic stability system, the 420 horsepower and 317 pounds-feet of torque are a non-issue. The R8 moved through snow and ice so adeptly it was completely without drama, almost mundane. The ability to turn off the traction control without disarming the stability system is helpful because it allows some of the wheelspin that’s advantageous on loose snow or sand.\n\nTo be clear, I’m not recommending the R8 as a four-season car. For one thing, its ground clearance is low, and though the tires are designed for winter, the short sidewalls put the 19-inch wheels in jeopardy. The intensity of dodging potholes had me exhausted by the time I reached the office. Even if you’re able to minus-size to 18-inch wheels, you’d still be talking about 40-series or lower-profile tires.\n\nAll the same, it’s significant that within the past few weeks alone we’ve left lesser cars parked because they gave us no confidence driving in similar conditions. As for supercars and supercar wannabes, most don’t even accept winter tires, or, in some cases, all-season tires. You have to admit, it’s an impressive attribute for the R8. In the case of unexpected snow — perhaps while driving through the mountains — it’s the difference between getting home and getting stranded.\n\nBuilt to Go\nFortunately the weather varied over our week with the R8, so I got the full experience with it, and it’s no less impressive in warmer, dry conditions. Our six-speed manual’s clutch was light and operable by anyone who can drive a stick. I’m surprised gated shifters haven’t filtered down to more affordable luxury cars. I saw no real advantage to having the gear positions defined by a visible slotted plate, but it remains a novelty — one that brings a mystique, a feeling of exclusivity, and that’s what luxury is about. The gate can impede 3rd-to-2nd-gear downshifts a bit, but I saw no problem with it outside of track driving, and in short order I forgot about the gate altogether but for the occasional click of the lever striking the aluminum plate.\n\nFor an additional $9,000, you can get a six-speed automatic in the form of the R tronic automated manual, which has fully automatic and sport modes as well as stick- or paddle-activated sequential shifting. Though I haven’t operated it, I’m dubious of R tronic because it is a single-clutch system, not to be confused with S tronic (formerly known as DSG, Direct Shift Gearbox) — a dual-clutch automated manual that has been excellent in every Audi and VW we’ve tested it in. The R tronic unit hails from Lamborghini (which Audi owns), and its 0-60 time is said to match the manual transmission’s, but when I experienced this system in a Gallardo, it delivered ponderous upshifts in normal driving. The single-clutch design — which perturbs drivers across the world in some BMWs and Smart cars — just can’t be as satisfying as the dual clutch has proved to be in Audis and other models, including the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution.\n\nOverall, the direct-injection V-8 has enough grunt at low rpm to get you moving, but its 307 pounds-feet isn’t the appeal. It’s the onrush of horsepower as the tach needle climbs up to its impressive 8,000 rpm redline. In the grand scheme of things, the R8’s 0-60 time of about 4.4 seconds isn’t lightning fast — it’s comparable to the Evolution (less than $34,000) and a good second behind the Nissan GT-R (around $70,000). This is one of the reasons some people argue that the R8 isn’t a supercar. (Yeah, yeah, whatev.) But it can press you into your seat with the best of them, and it posts a quarter-mile time of 13.1 seconds at 112 mph, according to our friends at MotorWeek. Audi says the top speed is 187 mph.\n\nAn Unlikely Moon Rover\nThe R8’s ride was another pleasant surprise, comfortable beyond anyone’s expectations for a car like this … and actually pretty livable in the overall sense. Standard are double wishbones, front and rear, with an adaptive suspension that does a heck of a job controlling body roll without an apparent tradeoff in ride quality. Audi Magnetic Ride uses the principle seen earlier on GM and Acura models before it came to the Audi TT in 2008. Touted for its speed in reacting to conditions and its wide range of firmness, the technology delivers more in the R8 than I’ve seen in other cars, with a dramatic difference between the normal and sport settings. I can’t imagine a need for the sport setting off the track, even on roads not ravaged by winter.\n\nThe R8 handles like a champ, delivering clawlike grip even with winter tires on dry roads coated with the powdery residue of dissolved road salt. When it starts to lose traction, it does so gradually, and it always felt under control to me, even with the stability system defeated.\n\nYou’ll often see a 50/50 percent weight distribution (front/rear) characterized as perfect, but the more vehicles I drive, the more I recognize that deviations may be more appropriate for the car in question. It’s typical for midengine cars to have more weight in the rear, yet the midengine placement is revered for its effect on dynamics. Audi cites the R8’s distribution as 44/56, and though you might expect this to result in wanton tail-wagging (oh, dear), there’s a slight understeer tendency when you nose into a corner. This makes the car safer and even more conducive to street driving. Even so, the body can be rotated in a sweeping turn without inducing snap oversteer. Precise steering and rear-biased Quattro make it difficult to get yourself in trouble. It’s a pleasure, if not a challenge, to drive.\n\nHeadroom From Nowhere\nOn the growing list of things that make the R8 more livable than many cars is its headroom: At 38 inches, it’s more than you get in an Audi TT, and with better visibility all around. It’s a full inch or more greater than competitors’, past and current, including the Aston Martin V8 Vantage, Ford GT, Lamborghini Gallardo and Murcielago, and Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren. It edges out the Ferrari F430 by a hair … or a haircut, perhaps. All of these cars have inches more legroom than the R8’s 41.1 inches, but at my height — 6 feet — I found it perfectly agreeable. (Considering that the Toyota Camry and Chevrolet Suburban give 41.7 and 41.3 inches of driver legroom, respectively, it’s hard to indict the R8 even in the face of its long-legged competitors.)\n\nThough the view to the rear isn’t great, I didn’t have much trouble with it on the road. When parking, however, it’s an issue, so I was happy to have the optional Audi Parking System, which has both front and rear sonar sensors and a backup camera. The backup monitor displays lines that curve left and right as you turn the steering wheel, showing where the car’s fenders will be as you roll backward. The sonar system is like most, in that it beeps with increasing frequency as you near an obstacle, but this one’s notable because of where its sensors are located. Even though the front bumper extension is low enough to grind against a parking block or curb, the sensors are at the lowest and most vulnerable point, so you’re sure to know when damage is nigh.\n\nStyled to Distract\nThe weather did less to hinder my progress than did reactions from neighboring cars and onlookers. I don’t remember the last time a test car got so much attention — quite an accomplishment at a time of year when pedestrians are looking straight down, wary of ice, or perhaps just beaten into frostbitten misery. I’m impressed that people recognize the R8 as something entirely new; it garnered more unabashed rubbernecking and mouth-breathing than the Italian competition does. (I should allow the possibility that people were just curious what kind of jackass drives a car like this in winter.)\n\nWe weren’t crazy about our car’s color scheme, honestly. The Mugello Blue Pearl Effect paint ($650 extra) wasn’t a problem itself, but it didn’t set off the sideblade, whose optional carbon fiber gives a charcoal color when viewed from a distance. The standard treatment, a darker Night Blue sideblade, would have worked better — and cost less. The optional Carbon Exterior Package is best left to the lighter colors, or even the black.\n\nR8 in the Market\nThere are things I don’t like about the R8, but they’re relatively minor. There’s something very cheap about the look and sound of the heated-seat switches, which is especially out of place in an Audi. Also, the standard stereo is simply dreadful. I don’t care how many watts, speakers or adjustments it has, it’s helpless. I haven’t heard the optional Bang & Olufsen premium system, but it has to be worth the additional investment … though whether it’s worth $1,800 depends on how important a good stereo is to you. That raises another frequent complaint: that the R8 has expensive options. I disagree — maybe because my emphasis is on the functional more than the aesthetic. The navigation system is $2,000, which is typical. Many options on my test car were cosmetic: blue paint ($650), the aforementioned Carbon Exterior Package ($5,300), Carbon Interior Trim ($2,200) and the Enhanced Leather Package ($5,500).\n\nI could have lived without all of these, especially because the standard issue isn’t exactly low-rent. Compared to all of this, the Premium Package is reasonable at $3,500, as it includes the parking system with backup camera, auto-dimming side mirror, a six-CD changer, HomeLink, Bluetooth connectivity, Hill Hold Assist and additional cabin storage. I’ve seen more expensive packages on much less expensive cars — often forcing you to pay for features you don’t want in order to get the ones you do. To that point, a lot of the R8’s options are offered a la carte, including some not on my test car: An Alcantara Headliner ($1,300), an accent-color sideblade ($1,000) and a Leather Elements package that gives premium leather seats and accents for $2,000 if you don’t want to go for the full Enhanced Leather Package.\n\nAll told, our car was $131,245, but the R8 can be had for $109,000, plus the unavoidable $2,100 gas guzzler tax and $1,000 destination charge. That includes everything that makes the R8 special: stunning styling, an intoxicating drivetrain and a chassis that’s as home on real roads as it is on the track. That’s the heart and soul of this car, and to my way of thinking, it’s a steal.\n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "Audi announced final details on updates to the 2020 R8 and introduced a special version of the supercar to celebrate 10 years of the R8’s V-10 engine, the R8 Decennium. The automaker delivered both reveals at the 2019 New York International Auto Show, which opens to the public today.\n\nRelated: More 2019 New York Auto Show Coverage\n\nWe had thought that the updated R8 would debut initially as a 2019 model, but it’s been pushed back a year to 2020. Styling updates are subtle; the R8 keeps the same basic shape and mid-engine proportions. The car does look lower as a whole thanks to a wider, flatter front grille that wears a honeycomb design. In the rear, circular exhaust tips replace the trapezoidal ones and there’s also a new lower diffuser. V10 Performance models, offered as a coupe or a convertible (Spyder), get a new paint option: Ascari Blue metallic (as seen in the photos above).\n\nPerformance\n\nThe R8 also now features the same naturally aspirated V-10 engine out of the R8 LMS racecar, a 5.2-liter V-10 that is mated to a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission and standard quattro all-wheel drive. Power output varies by model; the R8 V10 offers 562-horsepower and 406 pounds-feet of torque, while the R8 V10 Performance jumps to 602 hp and 413 pounds-feet of torque.\n\nThe R8 V10 coupe has a top speed of 201 mph and jumps from zero-to-60 mph in 3.4 seconds. Those figures drop to 200 mph and 3.5 seconds in the Spyder. The R8 V10 Performance tops those slightly: 205 mph and 3.2 seconds for the coupe, and 204 mph and 3.3 seconds for the Spyder.\n\nPricing\n\nPricing details were also announced. The 2020 R8 V10 coupe starts at $172,450 (after the gas guzzler tax and destination charges, which total $2,550 combined), and the R8 V10 Spyder at $184,650. The Performance models add ceramic brakes and larger standard wheels (20 inches). The R8 V10 Performance coupe starts at $198,450 with the Spyder version above that at $210,650.\n\nDecennium Edition\n\nAudi also announced the R8 Decennium, a celebration of a decade of the V-10 engine as a part of the R8 lineup. The Decennium will be limited to 222 units worldwide, with 50 of those headed to the U.S. All of the vehicles will be coupes, painted in Mythos Black metallic and come with unique design details, including Decennium badging, bronze finisher on the wheels and intake manifolds. The rest of the badges are finished in black and various body parts are made of carbon fiber.\n\nInside, the cabin is also finished completely in black with glossy carbon fiber inlays. Copper-colored stitching can be found on the seats and steering wheel, and there is also a small projector that displays the Decennium logo on the ground, along with the car’s limited-edition number when the door is opened.\n\nThe Decennium uses the same powertrain setup as the V10 Performance models and has the exact same acceleration and top speed specs as the coupe. The special-edition car will start at $217,545.\n\nBoth the 2020 R8 and the special-edition Decennium will go on sale in the summer.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "“What’s your favorite car?” I’ve been asked this a jillion times in my life, mostly since I became an auto journalist. My stock answer at social gatherings has been the 1995 Buick Roadmaster station wagon. I’ve always found that car strangely compelling, honestly, but mostly I’ve learned that the reply evokes stunned silence and allows me to avoid a question I’ve never been able to answer. I’ve driven too many models of too many vehicle types to pick just one; I’m at a cocktail party and this conversation feels a lot like work. The Roadmaster has reliably allowed me to move on to less complicated topics, like politics and religion.\n\nAll that has changed. For the first time in my life, I have a single favorite car: the Audi R8.\n\nThe Drive\nSince the R8’s debut, there have been critics for whom the 4.2-liter V-8’s 420 horsepower and zero to 60 mph in 4.4 seconds just wasn’t enough. Now, the V-10’s 525 hp delivers a zero-to-60 time of 3.7 seconds, and that puts it in line with other supercars. (See the two versions compared.) Speaking of supercars, the V-10 isn’t the 4.2-liter V-8 with a couple of additional cylinders. It’s actually shared with the Gallardo from Lamborghini — which Volkswagen also owns — and, in less-powerful forms, with the Audi S6 and S8. Early hopes of further differentiation from the Gallardo were dashed during development when a prototype R8 fitted with Audi’s twin-turbo 5.0-liter V-10 burst into flames. The thermal challenge couldn’t be overcome.\n\nNo great loss. The 5.2-liter is a potent engine, and though its torque peak is a mere 391 pounds-feet at 6,500 rpm, there’s enough grunt to get you going without much delay, and the standard Quattro all-wheel drive makes sure the power goes to the pavement during straight-line acceleration. The torque peak is definitely far up the rev range, especially for a 10-pack of cylinders, but possibly not as high as you’d think: The engine redlines at 8,700 rpm, so 6,500 rpm is relatively accessible and there’s a decent torque band to work with.\n\nThankfully, our test car had the manual transmission, which showed off the engine’s lightning-fast throttle response — something that’s all too rare with today’s by-wire throttles. When you blip the throttle to downshift, the tach jumps as quickly as it did with the late, lamented cable-operated butterfly. At last, this improvement is starting to look like an improvement.\n\nThe V-10 dumps rpm as quickly as it builds them — much faster than most engines, due to a low-mass flywheel and a very high compression ratio. Direct injection allows for 12.5-to-1 compression, which slows the pistons down precipitously as soon as the gas is cut. It reminded me of racing engines. I learned to back off only a bit on the throttle with each upshift to keep the revs matched during normal driving. Otherwise I’d be shifting with frantic speed when not accelerating frantically.\n\nThe gated shifter is a joy to behold, and it’s satisfying to use. I don’t believe it’s the best design for quick shifts, honestly; it’s too easy to catch the edge of one of the teeth when, say, moving from 2nd to 3rd or 4th to 5th. But I’ll gladly tolerate this quirk in exchange for the clicking sound of the stick moving through the gates. It never got old.\n\nApart from the increased acceleration, the V-10 does little to change the car’s character. The curb weight increases from 3,605 pounds with the V-8 to 3,715 with the V-10, and the front/rear weight distribution remains the same at 44/56, according to Audi. Quattro sends 65 percent of the torque to the rear wheels and can increase it to 90 percent when needed. Despite the tail-heaviness and rear torque bias, the car goes into a corner with understeer. In time, I found that the best approach is to head in slower and give it gas to get the rear in the game and establish a balance. Then you can pour it on, and the R8 digs in and corners like a cat on a rug.\n\nThere’s a single button near the shifter that switches the standard adaptive suspension to a Sport setting, which noticeably firms up the ride. Another button switches the electronic stability system to a more liberal Sport mode — allowing more sliding and wheelspin — or can turn it off entirely.\n\nThere are otherwise no adjustments. There’s no means of changing the accelerator pedal’s responsiveness, a feature I find unnecessary. And while I admit I sometimes appreciate keyless access, which lets you leave the keyfob in your pocket and control the door locks and ignition using buttons, I respect the R8’s old-fashioned key, which you put in a slot and turn. The switchblade design is smaller than most keyless fobs.\n\nDay to Day, Season to Season\nAs we’ve come to expect from performance cars, and especially more expensive ones, the R8 provides enough ride comfort for day-to-day livability without sacrificing handling, especially with the computer-controlled magneto-rheological suspension. You hear just enough engine sound from behind you, and the exhaust is discreet unless you accelerate vigorously. Unlike some high-powered sports cars, which are designed to blare when you hit a particular rpm level, the R8 5.2’s exhaust makes its presence known any time you put it under load — quieter at low revs, louder at high. It makes for relatively quiet cruising at all speeds, plus the ability to hear the growl even without making a menace of yourself. Very nicely done.\n\nIn last year’s R8 4.2 review, I marveled at how competent the car was on ice and snow (equipped with winter tires). If it weren’t for the low ride height, which turns minor snow drifts into obstacles, it would be a full-fledged four-season car.\n\nThe R8 is low indeed. The wee Mazda MX-5 Miata retractable hardtop is a tenth of an inch taller at the roofline. Though the sills aren’t too wide, getting in and out of the R8 is an effort. If you have bad knees, you’ll be begging for a hand, or some kind of grab handle, of which there are none to be found.\n\nLike most two-seaters, the R8 has enough legroom for adults, and there are standard eight-way power seats. Though I needed to inch the driver’s seat forward to get full extension on the clutch pedal, I found the dead pedal (foot rest) on the left too high for comfort in normal driving. Not being able to extend my left leg caused fatigue after time. An adjustable dead pedal would be fantastic.\n\nThe seats themselves are great — supportive, comfortable and pretty good at holding you in place during aggressive driving. I do think some occupants will find the bottom cushions’ side bolsters too tight. They were hugging my hips, and I’m relatively slim these days. Less prominent bolsters probably wouldn’t hurt; though adjustable types might appeal to buyers, they tend to add weight, complexity and cost.\n\nVisibility is actually quite good. Taller drivers might have to lower their heads to see high traffic signals, but I’ve seen worse in less stylish cars. (Camaro, I’m looking in your direction.) Because the rear window is immediately behind the seats, the view directly to the rear isn’t bad; the problem is the C-pillar, which is also close to the occupants and obstructive. I don’t think it’s a huge problem when driving if you make prudent use of your mirrors; it causes problems mostly when backing up, into or out of a parking space. Fortunately, a backup camera and front and rear sonar sensors are standard in the 5.2.\n\nIs Nothing Wrong With This Car?\nYes, the R8 has some shortcomings. Cargo capacity is a clear downside, at 3.5 cubic feet in the front trunk, roughly the size and shape of a rolling carry-on bag. With 5.3 cubic feet, even the Miata laughs at the R8. The Gallardo is at least a bit better than its cousin, with 3.9 cubic feet. The 2009 Ferrari F430 managed 8.8 cubic feet, and the new Ferrari California accommodates 8.5 cubic feet with the convertible top lowered and an impressive 12 cubic feet when the top’s up. We moved the R8’s seats forward and threw a bag of golf clubs back there, which worked, but anything you carry comes at the expense of legroom.\n\nThe backup camera’s image is too dark — worse than average. On the upside, it has lines that move as you turn the steering wheel to show where the car will go, and superimposed on the image is a graphic of the car that shows the proximity of obstacles to the bumpers. These front and rear sonar sensors are also standard, and the front ones are mounted uncommonly low on the bumper so they detect even low curbs, helping to protect the vulnerable front splitter.\n\nThe navigation system, entertainment and other features are controlled through an older version of Audi’s Multi Media Interface, which is less ergonomic than the latest from Mercedes and BMW.\n\nAnother weird quirk revealed itself as I drove in a downpour: The underside of the rear window fogged up, and the defogger utterly failed to fix the problem, creating a Venetian-blind effect. The engine compartment is enclosed between the large rear window and a short vertical one immediately behind the cabin. It’s peculiar, because the rear glass gets hot enough to melt ice and snow, yet it turned into a greenhouse by pulling moist cooling air in on a warm day.\n\nThen there’s the mileage. As with the V-8, the optional dual-clutch automatic transmission adds only 11 pounds to the R8 5.2. Regardless, it also ups the R8 5.2’s mileage by 1 mpg in the city, to 13/20 mpg and 16 mpg combined. The six-speed manual is 12/20 and 15 mpg combined. Because of its higher combined mpg, the 5.2 automatic’s gas-guzzler tax is “only” $2,100. The manual version suffers a $3,000 tax — but the R8 4.2’s guzzler tax is $2,100 across the board even though its combined mileage is 15 mpg for both versions. (This is due to the EPA’s methods, which I’d explain, but it would spin your head and crush whatever faith you might have in our government.) If you’re unfamiliar with the world of high-performance cars, yes, this mileage does indeed suck. But it’s also the norm among supercars, comparing to the Ferrari California and Lamborghini Gallardo.\n\nSafety\nAs a low-volume sports car, the R8 hasn’t been crash-tested. It comes with frontal airbags, side-impact head-and-chest airbags, and knee airbags. Other standard safety features include antilock brakes with discs at all four wheels, eight-piston calipers in front and four-piston ones at the rear.\n\nExterior & Styling\nA few features distinguish the 5.2 from the 4.2, including chrome trim on the grille itself, not just surrounding it, and gloss-black-vaned vents under the headlights, which use LEDs exclusively (they’re optional on the R8 4.2). The front air dam would be gloss black, too, but our car had optional carbon fiber here, as well as on the side mirrors, rear diffuser and side blades. The side blades are the accent-colored panels on the sides, which some observers like and others don’t. In addition to the standard solid accent color and optional carbon fiber, buyers can order matching body-colored side blades through the Audi Exclusive program for a monochrome look.\n\nThe 5.2 model’s blades are flared to gulp more induction and cooling air, and the rocker panels are more pronounced as well. Around back, the diffuser is larger than the 4.2’s, and the dual exhaust pipes are oval rather than two pairs of round tailpipes. The clearest telltale sign of a 5.2 is the continuous gloss black panel that extends across the rear. The R8 4.2 has dark vents under the taillights only.\n\nOne of the R8’s coolest aspects is revealed when you approach from the rear after dark and hit the remote unlock button. LEDs gradually illuminate the engine compartment, bathing the engine in a cool blue light. It’s fantastic.\n\nIn my time with the R8, its gorgeous styling caused everything from admiration and exclamation to a fender bender and bodily harm. With the R8 parked in front of my house, I sat quietly with my laptop alongside a hedge, like a cop with speed radar, and heard numerous outbursts from people walking or cycling by, which wouldn’t have been as notable if they hadn’t been alone, exclaiming to no one. On the road, one young driver hit the brakes to gawk when pulling out of a gas station and was rear-ended. A boy on a bicycle whipped his head around, instantly shouted “Audi R8!” to his friend, and then hit a curb and fell off his seat. (We all know how painful that can be.) The R8 proved to be a bit of a hazard.\n\nR8 in the Market\nIt’s hard for people to accept that any car priced above $100,000 is a bargain, but everything’s relative. The R8 4.2 starts at $114,200. More than $30,000 is a lot to pay for a couple additional cylinders, but at $146,000, the R8 5.2 is still cheap when you consider that Lamborghinis and Ferraris start close to $200K. Aston Martin starts at almost $121,000 with a V-8 and more than $187,000 with a V-12. The Bentley Continental GT starts at nearly $183,000.\n\nIf you want to compare other high-performance models, the 2010 Chevrolet Corvette ZR1 costs $106,880 and looks like a Corvette. The Porsche 911 Turbo starts at $132,800 but looks like yet another 911. Ditto for AMG and V-12 versions of Mercedes’ top models, which look a lot like their less affordable siblings but cost more than the R8s.\n\nOur test car was optioned up to $170,350 “out the door,” but aside from the destination charge and gas-guzzler tax, every option was cosmetic — a suedelike Alcantara ceiling liner and a slew of carbon-fiber trim, inside and out. That means just over $150,000 gets you the performance and the looks. With a V-8, it’s cheaper still.\n\nThat leaves us with the issue of image. To believe there’s no “look at me” component to the supercar-selection process is to deny human nature. Even Prius owners want to be recognized as such, and people who choose bland cars often do so specifically because they don’t want to stick out. “Don’t look at me” is simply the opposite side of the same coin.\n\nThe R8 grabs attention like no other car — and I speak of the quality more than the quantity. It was met with far less disdain than the other exotics I’ve driven, like Lambos and Astons. People didn’t hesitate to give the R8 a thumbs up or say, “Nice car!” Reactions were unabashed — more like what I’ve experienced in modest nostalgia cars like the Dodge Challenger and Volkswagen New Beetle. Was it because the R8 is relatively new? Maybe. Because it’s striking in a different way — more German than Italian? That’s probably part of it. But I think the main thing is that it’s an Audi.\n\nI was asked a couple of times why anyone would buy an Audi over a Lamborghini or a Ferrari. I suspect many R8 buyers will do so because of the brand, not in spite of it. Many Lamborghinis and Ferraris are purchased because they’re Lamborghinis and Ferraris. What some people see as cachet, others see as a banner that reads “trust-fund baby,” “Wall Street shark” or something less polite. When people buy the R8, they’re buying the car, not someone else’s idea of reputation, which might or might not be reflected in the product itself.\n\nOwners of other Audis look at the R8 and feel a little bit better about their own vehicles. Other Americans are simply impressed. We’re aspirational by nature, and we appreciate an up-and-comer. Audi has risen from the ashes of unsubstantiated unintended-acceleration hysteria in the 1980s to become a fierce competitor in the U.S. luxury market. The R8 is no desperate attempt to earn performance credibility, as some say Lexus’ $375,000 LFA is. The R8 springs from the loins of a strengthening lineup of compelling performance-oriented vehicles, Le Mans wins, growing sales and improving reliability. The R8 comes at the perfect time with exceptional execution, especially for an all-new model.\n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "If you’re going to drive down memory lane, do it in a 2011 Audi R8 Spyder.\n\nI was trying to explain just that to an Elizabeth, N.J., police officer who was standing next to the driver’s door, his hand casually placed on his pistol while examining my driver’s license under the glare of red and blue flashing lights.\n\n“Honest officer, it’s my 25th high school reunion in a couple of days,” I said.\n\n“And why do you have this car?”\n\n“Did I mention my reunion?”\n\nAfter a quick lecture on why I shouldn’t take corners at 40 mph, I was off to the races â€” or at least to a little township not too far from Raceway Park.\n\nThe culture of cars is as American as Greek-owned diners and showing up to a class reunion in a fancy vehicle you don’t own â€” and slightly sophomoric. Then again, I didn’t win class clown for nothing. So when Audi asked if I wanted to test this all-new dream machine, I knew exactly where I wanted to drive it: The New Jersey Turnpike.\n\nIf I’m going to go back in time, to revisit old friends and stir up memories of pork roll, the shore and every girl I may have had a crush on for the two minutes between gym and Mr. Neal’s English class (much to my wonderful wife’s annoyance), I was going to need all 525 horsepower to get there. Only a New Jersey pizza is more delicious than Audi’s V-10, which is mounted behind the convertible’s two seats.\n\nIt was only a few years ago that Audi rolled out the regular R8 with its spaceship-like exterior, incredible handling and leather-encased interior. It is still one of the few supercars that feels like a deal at just a little over $100,000.\n\nAn exhilarating ride\n\nThe R8 Spyder pushes Audi’s speeding name plate up to some even higher level of sports machine. The high revving, high octane engine screams.\n\nIn fact, while taking former classmates for test rides (which is what you do when you have one of these cars), Grace Garces and Wendy Ward both let out squeals that perfectly combined exhilaration and fear â€” kind of like that moment when we actually graduated high school.\n\nAs we ripped around a left-hand turn, the Spyder stuck to the ground, never bending or pushing out. Between the bubble gum sticky 19-inch wheels and the performance tuned aluminum double wishbone suspension, the car never rolled, slid or moved other than where you wanted to go. The steering is exact. The controls precise. The effect â€” magnificently cool, a status I never obtained in high school. This time, however, I managed to get to second gear and 80 mph with both Wendy and Grace.\n\nPerfection\n\nWhat they didn’t know, and probably didn’t care about, was that the engine cranking out 391-pound-feet of torque and winding out to 8,000 rpm, is the same engine found in the R8 LMS racecar. It’s aluminum perfection.\n\nThe all-wheel-drive system provides unreal traction and makes spinning the tires difficult. The 5.2-liter also lets this Spyder go from 0 to 1985 in the blink of an eye. (With a $161,000 starting price, the Spyder is worth more than every vehicle my senior class owned â€” combined â€” I thought as I tried to do doughnuts in my high school parking lot. My test car topped $190,000, something I tried to bring up in every conversation at the reunion.) While I would prefer the six-speed manual, I found the six-speed R-tronic automated manual gearbox much improved over the version originally in the R8. That transmission tended to lag behind the performance you wanted and make a weird clunking noise when it downshifted as you approached a traffic light. This one provided fast, smooth shifts and not having a heavy clutch was convenient when driving through the thick traffic on Route 18 and I-287.\n\nA real head turner\n\nThen there’s just the way this car looks. As you drive down the road, it does more than turn heads, it causes whiplash. It didn’t help that the car was Scarlet Red. Audi has a different name for the color, but when you grow up in the shadow of Rutgers University, everything is scarlet.\n\nFor those who would drive this with the soft top up, the car is surprisingly quiet and still looks sharp. But this convertible should almost always be down.\n\nAudi decided to not include the distinctive blades on the sides of the Spyder, which doesn’t take away from the car at all. Really, the wedged shaped Spyder just looks fast, with the rear fender vents sucking in air to feed the engine.\n\nEven the ridged vents along the back â€” that also help keep the engine cool â€” look sculpted. The car, while small and wide, feels huge once you’re sitting in the passenger compartment. There’s tons of space, at least it feels that way. There’s 37.7 inches, which doesn’t sound like much, but the space was needed to hold the roof when it was rolled up. (Another great feature is the ability to open and close the roof while driving the R8 Spyder. Nothing is worse than pulling into a parking space then sitting there waiting for the roof to close up. The Spyder can button up or drop its top up to speeds of 31 mph.)All of the controls are similar to the regular R8 â€” though calling the R8 regular is like calling President Obama just some guy who lives in D.C. There’s nothing regular about any of these Audis.\n\nWhen you sit in the cockpit, everything is right at your finger tips and the high resolution navigation screen points directly at you. Leather surrounds you but it’s not just any kind of leather. It includes special pigments that can cool the seats by as much as 68 degrees even in direct sunlight.\n\nAudi also added a seatbelt microphone for your Bluetooth-connected phone so you can speak clearly on the phone even with the top down. The steep windshield pushes the wind over you and if you put the side windows up, it’s quiet. Really, holding a conversation in the R8 Spyder is pretty easy.\n\nAnd during the reunion, the R8 Spyder was certainly a conversation piece.\n\nNo one was duped into thinking I owned it, dealer tags tend to steal that thunder, but I was more than happy enough to show them the car parked right in front of the hotel.\n\nIf you can’t get long lost friends to ogle over you, bring along an R8 Spyder and sit in it. There will be ogling.\n\nsburgess@detnews.com (313) 223-3217\n\nReport Card\n\nOverall: ****\n\nExterior: Excellent. Beautiful design that keeps its R8 looks but loses the roof.\n\nInterior: Excellent. Lots of leather and just enough gadgets to keep the driverâ€™s eyes on the road.\n\nPerformance: Excellent\n\nPros: Perfect for a long weekend in New Jersey.\n\nCons: Giving it back or paying $161,000.\n\n**** Excellent *** Good ** Fair * Poor",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThis two-seat mid-engine sports car is named after an Audi Le Mans-winning racecar and is available as a hardtop coupe or Spyder roadster. Like the Lamborghini Gallardo with which it competes, the R8 has a mid-mounted engine. It features a weight-saving aluminum body and Quattro all-wheel drive, and both the coupe and convertible are available with an optional V-10 engine.\n\n(Skip to details on the: R8 Sypder)\n\nNew for 2012\nA new top-level trim of the R8 is available this year. With only 333 scheduled to be built, the limited-edition GT model uses carbon fiber to trim 180 pounds and features a 560-horsepower version of Audi’s 5.2-liter V-10 engine. The R8 GT comes only with the R tronic sequential gearbox, with each production unit number engraved on the shift knob. The GT model receives aerodynamic improvements including a carbon fiber front bumper as well as a full-width fixed carbon fiber rear spoiler. The interior has carbon fiber and Alcantara accents and the R8 GT badge throughout.\n\nExterior\nThe R8’s front end is dominated by air-intake grates and Audi’s trapezoidal grille. Distinguishing features include sideblade air intakes behind the doors that route air to the engine. Rectangular LED taillights are standard, and a power-extendable rear spoiler provides additional downforce at high speeds.\n\nThe V-10 model gets larger side air intakes, unique rocker panel shaping, “V 10” front fender badges and a larger rear diffuser. Exterior features include:\n\n19-inch alloy wheels standard\nOptional carbon fiber sideblade\nOptional LED headlights\nTransparent canopy in rear allows view of the engine\nQuad exhaust pipes on V-8 models\nDual exhaust tips on V-10 models\n\nInterior\nThe R8’s two-person cabin has standard sport seats covered in leather or Alcantara simulated suede and leather. A navigation system with Audi’s Multi Media Interface system is available. MMI controls vehicle settings via a knob and buttons on the center of the dashboard. Audi says there’s room for two golf bags behind the seats. V-10 models get different instrument-cluster labeling. Interior features include:\n\nStandard six-CD changer\nFlat-bottom steering wheel for easier entry and exit\nStandard Bluetooth hands-free phone interface\nHomeLink garage-door opener\nAvailable carbon fiber interior trim\nAvailable Bang & Olufsen stereo\nAvailable backup camera\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe standard 4.2-liter V-8 engine makes 430 hp and 316 pounds-feet of torque. The base 5.2-liter V-10 makes 525 hp and 391 pounds-feet of torque. The version in the R8 GT makes 560 hp, and Audi claims a top speed of 199 mph.\n\nThe R8 has an adaptive four-wheel-independent suspension. Similar to GM’s Magnetic Ride Control, the Audi Magnetic Ride system can pass an electrical charge through the shocks’ fluid to instantly change its damping properties. The driver can select two modes — one geared toward performance and the other designed for comfort. Mechanical features include:\n\nQuattro all-wheel drive\nStandard six-speed manual transmission\nOptional six-speed R tronic sequential manual with automatic mode\nR tronic features Audi’s launch control system\nR tronic can be shifted by console lever or steering-wheel paddles\n\nSafety\nSafety features include:\n\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes with traction control\nElectronic stability system\nSeat-mounted side-impact airbags\nKnee airbags\nSeat belt pretensioners\nOptional carbon ceramic brakes\n\nR8 Spyder\nAudi added a roadster version of its R8 supercar for the 2011 model year with the debut of the R8 Spyder. Like the coupe, the R8 Spyder comes with either a 4.2-liter V-8 or a 5.2-liter V-10 engine,  and buyers have a choice of either a six-speed manual transmission or the six-speed R tronic sequential manual with paddle shifters.\n\nThe curvaceous lines of the R8 coupe haven’t been compromised in its transformation to a convertible, and although the vents stretching rearward from the driver and passenger seats are neat design cues, it’s a shame you can’t see the mid-engine like you can in the hardtop R8. LED headlights are available.\n\nFor times when top-down motoring just won’t do, the R8 Spyder has a power-operated soft-top that Audi claims can open or close in a swift 19 seconds. You don’t have to be completely stationary for the top to work, either, as it’s functional up to about 30 mph. Back to top",

      "expert_review": "The V-10 version of Audi’s mid-engine R8 is a user-friendly, daily-drivable supercar that comes alive when called upon with a screaming motor, wild styling and amazing reflexes.\n\n“Hey, Tony Stark!” yelled the guy from the car next to me at the stoplight. I was confused for a moment, before I remembered that the Audi R8 I was driving starred as the official movie conveyance of Iron Man’s billionaire alter ego. It’s not surprising to have people yell and gesture at you while driving an R8, especially one done up in matte blue paint with carbon-fiber side-blade trim. It looks like nothing else on the road, a low and slinky exotic sports car that conjures up images of a wolf among sheep.\n\nAudi’s mid-engine sports car shares much of its mechanical bits with the Lamborghini Gallardo, including the optional V-10 engine that was fitted inside my 2014 test car (compare the 2012 and 2014 models here; there was no 2013 model).\n\nSome exotic cars can be difficult to drive, uncomfortable to sit in and generally unpleasant to deal with. Is the R8 an exception to the norm?\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe R8 is stunning in person. Pictures don’t do the car justice — its wide stance, its amazingly low overall height, the ability to see the engine nestled in a cradle behind the passengers’ heads through a transparent hatch — all of it adds up to some wild, attention-grabbing style. It doesn’t have the lovely lines of a Ferrari 458 or the brutish musculature of a Dodge Viper, instead choosing to go the purposeful, Germanic route of form following function. It looks how one would expect a German supercar to look: sleek, aerodynamic and designed to a specification instead of a passion. My 5.2 Plus version was done up in Sepang Blue Matte paint, a hue exclusive to the 5.2 Plus, with complementary carbon-fiber trim for the mirrors and side blades. Additional styling changes differentiate the 5.2 Plus, including a front air splitter in carbon fiber, matte-black rear vent louvers and black tailpipe trim. Frankly, this is not the R8’s best color option — matte paint works best when it’s a neutral color, like silver or white, not when a shiny finish would work better. But it is indeed distinctive, and drew as many comments for the paint color as it did for the shape of the body.\n\nHow It Drives\nNestled snugly behind the driver and passenger in the R8 is usually a V-8 engine, which is standard in the base R8. That engine is strong, but you can spend a little more coin (OK, a lot more coin) and get one of the world’s great supercar motors: a 5.2-liter V-10 engine that makes 525 horsepower and 391 pounds-feet of torque. Or you can spend even more money and step up to the R8 5.2 Plus package, which bumps the output to 550 hp and 398 pounds-feet of torque, like the engine in my test car. All engines are mated to either a six-speed manual or a new seven-speed, dual-clutch automatic transmission, which replaces last year’s six-speed automatic. It sends power to all four wheels thanks to standard Audi Quattro all-wheel drive. The result is a fascinating dual-personality car, an easily accessible, simple-to-handle sports car that can be driven daily in easy, luxurious comfort — or, at the push of the “Sport” button, become a hairy-chested brute of a machine that shrieks its way from zero to 60 mph in just 3.3 seconds, on its way to a top speed of 197 mph (manufacturer’s estimates). Few things on the planet sound like a V-10 engine under full throttle, a strangely mysterious noise that sounds nothing like the bellow of a big V-8 or the refined whir of a V-12. It comes from the dissonant balance of having two banks of odd-numbered cylinders, but it sounds wicked cool.\n\nNot only does the R8 5.2 Plus accelerate well, but it steers, stops and rides with fantastic precision. Unlike some competitors, like the Nissan GT-R, however, it doesn’t feel wound-up all the time, like a squirrel on amphetamines — you can hop in, cruise around town, soak up highway mile after highway mile and never feel stressed or harried. The steering is heavy and accurate, but not race-car twitchy like the GT-R’s. The only issue is the R8’s brakes, which are extremely grabby carbon ceramic units that require an incredibly delicate foot to bring the car to a stop without throwing the passengers against their seat belts. Being essentially racing brakes, they are not well-suited to street duty; the squealing noise they produce when cold or only moderately warm will draw the wrong kind of stares from passers-by. Unfortunately, they’re standard on the R8 5.2 Plus, meaning that if you want the car, you get the noisy, grabby brakes. I suspect most customers will simply just get used to them.\n\nFuel economy in a car like this is really a discussion only for purposes of amusement — nobody buys a V-10-powered supercar because they want to save the planet. The automatic R8 5.2 Plus is rated 13/22/16 mpg city/highway/combined, which fell in line with my test result of 16.5 mpg in mixed use. This is slightly better than the V-8-powered Maserati GranTurismo, which comes in at 13/21/16 mpg, but is not as “good” as the Nissan GT-R’s 16/23/19 mpg or the Porsche 911 Turbo S’ rating of 17/24/20 mpg. All these cars require premium gas, as well, but if that’s something you’d gripe about, here’s a link to research the Toyota Prius — you’re reading the wrong review.\n\nInterior\nAs supercar interiors go, this is one of the more accommodating. It’s still a “sit-and-swivel” affair to get into the R8, in which you first plant your butt in the seat and then swivel your legs into the footwell. You’ll have to reverse the process to get out of the car, but once inside there’s plenty of room for taller or rounder people. The R8’s low height means a low windshield, and combined with the high tail that houses the engine compartment, outward visibility is not great. Traffic signals disappear when you approach them, and you’d best check your blind spots two or three times when changing lanes. A standard backup camera and sonar sensors help when reversing out of a parking spot.\n\nThe seats are firm but very comfortable, with no unusual lumps or bolsters to complain about at all. There’s plenty of hip and shoulder room, as well; the R8 is a wide car, and while it seats only two, those two occupants should be pleased with their environment. It’s a surprisingly quiet cabin, as well, with largely drama-free highway cruising, aside from some tire slap from the big 19-inch wheels. That all changes, though, once you push the “Sport” button and the pipes open up on the V-10 that sits just inches behind your head, allowing the glorious wail of all 10 cylinders to complement the satellite radio system.\n\nCompared with the car’s competitors, the Audi finishes mid-pack in terms of interior appointments. The 5.2 Plus edition brings standard carbon-fiber trim, and my test car had nearly $6,300 worth of black diamond-quilt pattern leather seats and trim panel stitching inside, along with an Alcantara faux-suede headliner. The Porsche 911 Turbo S is just as nice, if not quite as roomy. The Maserati GranTurismo has more luxurious materials and dramatic style to it, but not as many amenities. And the R8 handily trounces the Nissan GT-R in terms of sophisticated style, materials and seat comfort, yet comes up short in roominess and visibility.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThis is not Audi’s most modern cabin; it’s starting to show its age in material quality and lack of modern conveniences. There’s no keyless entry or push-button start offered in the R8, reflecting the lack of a major electrical architecture update since the car was introduced nearly eight years ago. Audi’s MMI multimedia system with navigation is standard, but it’s not the most advanced version that Audi offers these days — there’s no Google Earth or 4G LTE connectivity, for instance. It’s clear that the R8 is due for an update when the lowly $30,000 Audi A3 sedan offers more and better electronic equipment in the cockpit than the halo sports car, which costs six times as much. Still, it’s opulently appointed and everything is easy to use — no confusing voice-command systems, no touch-sensitive control panels. It may be a little out of date, but it all still works quite well.\n\nCargo & Storage\nBeing a mid-engine car, the R8 has its cargo area up front, like the Porsche 911 — a front trunk, or “frunk” if you like. Unlike the 911, however, it’s truly tiny — just 3.5 cubic feet of space, compared with the Porsche’s 4.1 cubic feet. The Porsche also offers up some rear seat storage, as the vestigial rear seats are really only good for cargo, not passengers. The Maserati GranTurismo has a proper trunk, boasting 9.2 cubic feet of cargo room, while the GT-R offers a remarkably deep trunk well with 8.8 cubic feet of room. You might not think cargo room is too important in a sports car like this, but it means the Maserati driver can carry a passenger and some golf clubs, while the Audi driver has to choose between the two.\n\nSafety\nThe R8’s aluminum space-frame chassis is extremely light and strong, but the car has not been crash-tested by either the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. The R8 also does not offer many of the modern electronic safety features that have become common in high-end luxury cars, like automatic cruise control, autonomous braking, lane keep assist, lane departure warning, blind spot warning and more. You can see all the R8’s standard safety features here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe R8 occupies a fairly wide price range, starting at $116,150 for a 4.2 model, including destination charge and a rather hefty $3,000 gas-guzzler tax (on manual transmission models; automatic transmission models are taxed $1,700). Stepping up to a 5.2 will run you $155,450, while opting for the top, 5.2 Plus coupe will set you back $174,795. The 4.2 and 5.2 models also come in a very sharp convertible version called the Spyder, but the 5.2 Plus is not available as a ragtop. My test car included the $9,100 S Tronic dual-clutch automatic transmission, Sepang Blue Matte paint for $6,000 and the Diamond Stitch Full Leather interior package for $5,000, along with a $1,300 Alcantara headliner and an iPod cable for $100. Grand total: $194,995.\n\nCompetitors come with a variety of missions, from luxury grand tourers to track monsters. Closest in price and mission, however, may be the rear-engined Porsche 911 Turbo S, a beast in its own right that starts at $182,050. Lesser models may be had for less money, but the Turbo S can keep right up with the R8 5.2 Plus without a problem, on the street or the track. It’s not as distinctive as the R8, but it is easily as entertaining to drive. Going a more luxurious route will take you to the Maserati GranTurismo MC coupe, which starts at $154,900. It has less power than the R8 5.2 Plus, with its V-8 pumping out 444 hp compared with the Audi’s 550. It doesn’t feature the technical sophistication of the Audi powertrain, either, but it does come with Italian good looks and serious brand cachet. Finally, the Nissan GT-R may not be the luxury model the R8 is, but its street and track rock-star status (and a $40,000 sticker price savings) more than make up for a lack of rings on the grille. Compare all four sports cars here.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in September 2014 about the 2014 Audi R8. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2015, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe V-10 version of Audi’s mid-engine R8 is a user-friendly, daily-drivable supercar that comes alive when called upon with a screaming motor, wild styling and amazing reflexes.\n\n“Hey, Tony Stark!” yelled the guy from the car next to me at the stoplight. I was confused for a moment, before I remembered that the Audi R8 I was driving starred as the official movie conveyance of Iron Man’s billionaire alter ego. It’s not surprising to have people yell and gesture at you while driving an R8, especially one done up in matte blue paint with carbon-fiber side-blade trim. It looks like nothing else on the road, a low and slinky exotic sports car that conjures up images of a wolf among sheep.\n\nAudi’s mid-engine sports car shares much of its mechanical bits with the Lamborghini Gallardo, including the optional V-10 engine that was fitted inside my 2014 test car (compare the 2012 and 2014 models here; there was no 2013 model).\n\nSome exotic cars can be difficult to drive, uncomfortable to sit in and generally unpleasant to deal with. Is the R8 an exception to the norm?\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe R8 is stunning in person. Pictures don’t do the car justice — its wide stance, its amazingly low overall height, the ability to see the engine nestled in a cradle behind the passengers’ heads through a transparent hatch — all of it adds up to some wild, attention-grabbing style. It doesn’t have the lovely lines of a Ferrari 458 or the brutish musculature of a Dodge Viper, instead choosing to go the purposeful, Germanic route of form following function. It looks how one would expect a German supercar to look: sleek, aerodynamic and designed to a specification instead of a passion. My 5.2 Plus version was done up in Sepang Blue Matte paint, a hue exclusive to the 5.2 Plus, with complementary carbon-fiber trim for the mirrors and side blades. Additional styling changes differentiate the 5.2 Plus, including a front air splitter in carbon fiber, matte-black rear vent louvers and black tailpipe trim. Frankly, this is not the R8’s best color option — matte paint works best when it’s a neutral color, like silver or white, not when a shiny finish would work better. But it is indeed distinctive, and drew as many comments for the paint color as it did for the shape of the body.\n\nHow It Drives\nNestled snugly behind the driver and passenger in the R8 is usually a V-8 engine, which is standard in the base R8. That engine is strong, but you can spend a little more coin (OK, a lot more coin) and get one of the world’s great supercar motors: a 5.2-liter V-10 engine that makes 525 horsepower and 391 pounds-feet of torque. Or you can spend even more money and step up to the R8 5.2 Plus package, which bumps the output to 550 hp and 398 pounds-feet of torque, like the engine in my test car. All engines are mated to either a six-speed manual or a new seven-speed, dual-clutch automatic transmission, which replaces last year’s six-speed automatic. It sends power to all four wheels thanks to standard Audi Quattro all-wheel drive. The result is a fascinating dual-personality car, an easily accessible, simple-to-handle sports car that can be driven daily in easy, luxurious comfort — or, at the push of the “Sport” button, become a hairy-chested brute of a machine that shrieks its way from zero to 60 mph in just 3.3 seconds, on its way to a top speed of 197 mph (manufacturer’s estimates). Few things on the planet sound like a V-10 engine under full throttle, a strangely mysterious noise that sounds nothing like the bellow of a big V-8 or the refined whir of a V-12. It comes from the dissonant balance of having two banks of odd-numbered cylinders, but it sounds wicked cool.\n\nNot only does the R8 5.2 Plus accelerate well, but it steers, stops and rides with fantastic precision. Unlike some competitors, like the Nissan GT-R, however, it doesn’t feel wound-up all the time, like a squirrel on amphetamines — you can hop in, cruise around town, soak up highway mile after highway mile and never feel stressed or harried. The steering is heavy and accurate, but not race-car twitchy like the GT-R’s. The only issue is the R8’s brakes, which are extremely grabby carbon ceramic units that require an incredibly delicate foot to bring the car to a stop without throwing the passengers against their seat belts. Being essentially racing brakes, they are not well-suited to street duty; the squealing noise they produce when cold or only moderately warm will draw the wrong kind of stares from passers-by. Unfortunately, they’re standard on the R8 5.2 Plus, meaning that if you want the car, you get the noisy, grabby brakes. I suspect most customers will simply just get used to them.\n\nFuel economy in a car like this is really a discussion only for purposes of amusement — nobody buys a V-10-powered supercar because they want to save the planet. The automatic R8 5.2 Plus is rated 13/22/16 mpg city/highway/combined, which fell in line with my test result of 16.5 mpg in mixed use. This is slightly better than the V-8-powered Maserati GranTurismo, which comes in at 13/21/16 mpg, but is not as “good” as the Nissan GT-R’s 16/23/19 mpg or the Porsche 911 Turbo S’ rating of 17/24/20 mpg. All these cars require premium gas, as well, but if that’s something you’d gripe about, here’s a link to research the Toyota Prius — you’re reading the wrong review.\n\nInterior\nAs supercar interiors go, this is one of the more accommodating. It’s still a “sit-and-swivel” affair to get into the R8, in which you first plant your butt in the seat and then swivel your legs into the footwell. You’ll have to reverse the process to get out of the car, but once inside there’s plenty of room for taller or rounder people. The R8’s low height means a low windshield, and combined with the high tail that houses the engine compartment, outward visibility is not great. Traffic signals disappear when you approach them, and you’d best check your blind spots two or three times when changing lanes. A standard backup camera and sonar sensors help when reversing out of a parking spot.\n\nThe seats are firm but very comfortable, with no unusual lumps or bolsters to complain about at all. There’s plenty of hip and shoulder room, as well; the R8 is a wide car, and while it seats only two, those two occupants should be pleased with their environment. It’s a surprisingly quiet cabin, as well, with largely drama-free highway cruising, aside from some tire slap from the big 19-inch wheels. That all changes, though, once you push the “Sport” button and the pipes open up on the V-10 that sits just inches behind your head, allowing the glorious wail of all 10 cylinders to complement the satellite radio system.\n\nCompared with the car’s competitors, the Audi finishes mid-pack in terms of interior appointments. The 5.2 Plus edition brings standard carbon-fiber trim, and my test car had nearly $6,300 worth of black diamond-quilt pattern leather seats and trim panel stitching inside, along with an Alcantara faux-suede headliner. The Porsche 911 Turbo S is just as nice, if not quite as roomy. The Maserati GranTurismo has more luxurious materials and dramatic style to it, but not as many amenities. And the R8 handily trounces the Nissan GT-R in terms of sophisticated style, materials and seat comfort, yet comes up short in roominess and visibility.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThis is not Audi’s most modern cabin; it’s starting to show its age in material quality and lack of modern conveniences. There’s no keyless entry or push-button start offered in the R8, reflecting the lack of a major electrical architecture update since the car was introduced nearly eight years ago. Audi’s MMI multimedia system with navigation is standard, but it’s not the most advanced version that Audi offers these days — there’s no Google Earth or 4G LTE connectivity, for instance. It’s clear that the R8 is due for an update when the lowly $30,000 Audi A3 sedan offers more and better electronic equipment in the cockpit than the halo sports car, which costs six times as much. Still, it’s opulently appointed and everything is easy to use — no confusing voice-command systems, no touch-sensitive control panels. It may be a little out of date, but it all still works quite well.\n\nCargo & Storage\nBeing a mid-engine car, the R8 has its cargo area up front, like the Porsche 911 — a front trunk, or “frunk” if you like. Unlike the 911, however, it’s truly tiny — just 3.5 cubic feet of space, compared with the Porsche’s 4.1 cubic feet. The Porsche also offers up some rear seat storage, as the vestigial rear seats are really only good for cargo, not passengers. The Maserati GranTurismo has a proper trunk, boasting 9.2 cubic feet of cargo room, while the GT-R offers a remarkably deep trunk well with 8.8 cubic feet of room. You might not think cargo room is too important in a sports car like this, but it means the Maserati driver can carry a passenger and some golf clubs, while the Audi driver has to choose between the two.\n\nSafety\nThe R8’s aluminum space-frame chassis is extremely light and strong, but the car has not been crash-tested by either the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. The R8 also does not offer many of the modern electronic safety features that have become common in high-end luxury cars, like automatic cruise control, autonomous braking, lane keep assist, lane departure warning, blind spot warning and more. You can see all the R8’s standard safety features here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe R8 occupies a fairly wide price range, starting at $116,150 for a 4.2 model, including destination charge and a rather hefty $3,000 gas-guzzler tax (on manual transmission models; automatic transmission models are taxed $1,700). Stepping up to a 5.2 will run you $155,450, while opting for the top, 5.2 Plus coupe will set you back $174,795. The 4.2 and 5.2 models also come in a very sharp convertible version called the Spyder, but the 5.2 Plus is not available as a ragtop. My test car included the $9,100 S Tronic dual-clutch automatic transmission, Sepang Blue Matte paint for $6,000 and the Diamond Stitch Full Leather interior package for $5,000, along with a $1,300 Alcantara headliner and an iPod cable for $100. Grand total: $194,995. Option one up your way here.\n\nCompetitors come with a variety of missions, from luxury grand tourers to track monsters. Closest in price and mission, however, may be the rear-engined Porsche 911 Turbo S, a beast in its own right that starts at $182,050. Lesser models may be had for less money, but the Turbo S can keep right up with the R8 5.2 Plus without a problem, on the street or the track. It’s not as distinctive as the R8, but it is easily as entertaining to drive. Going a more luxurious route will take you to the Maserati GranTurismo MC coupe, which starts at $154,900. It has less power than the R8 5.2 Plus, with its V-8 pumping out 444 hp compared with the Audi’s 550. It doesn’t feature the technical sophistication of the Audi powertrain, either, but it does come with Italian good looks and serious brand cachet. Finally, the Nissan GT-R may not be the luxury model the R8 is, but its street and track rock-star status (and a $40,000 sticker price savings) more than make up for a lack of rings on the grille. Compare all four sports cars here.\n\nemail",
