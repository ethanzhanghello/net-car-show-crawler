      "expert_review": "Entering its sixth year, the second-generation Audi Q5 remains the brand’s bestselling vehicle and continues to be priced and sized to appeal to a vast pool of potential buyers. The luxury SUV offers a broad selection of powertrains, while its Sportback version offers the same basic mechanical package with a sleeker roofline. For the new model year, the Q5, SQ5 and Q5 Sportback get new standard equipment as well as new starting prices.\n\nRelated: How Do Car Seats Fit in a 2022 Audi Q5 Sportback?\n\nWhat’s New for 2024\n\nFor 2024, Audi continues to offer the Q5 in three trim levels: Premium, Premium Plus and Prestige. The full Q5 family receives adaptive cruise control, lane departure steering assist and a heated steering wheel as standard equipment, and all but the plug-in hybrid also add remote starting via the myAudi app.\n\nInside, sport seats and birch wood trim are standard on the Q5 45, while a newly available Black Optic Package blacks out the exterior trim and roof rails on the Q5 40’s Premium Plus and Prestige trims. On 45, 55 and 45 Sportback variants, the package also blacks out the Audi rings and model badging, front splitter, air intakes and rear diffuser, and inside, it adds a black headliner and perforated leather steering wheel. The brake calipers aren’t black, however; they’re red.\n\nAll Q5 Premium Plus variants also now get a six-month trial subscription to the app store’s Audi Connect Plus, which gives access to music, video, navigation, parking and charging information, and more via the SUV’s infotainment system.\n\nPowertrain Specs\n\nThe two digits appended to the Q5 badge — 40, 45, or 55 — refer to the engine output. The Q5 40 has a 201-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder; the Q5 45 gets a 261-hp version of the same engine. With its electric motor and a 17.9-kilowatt-hour battery, the Q5 55 PHEV has a system output of up to 362 hp. The SQ5 engages in no such silliness: It’s just an SQ5 powered by a 349-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6.\n\nThe Q5 models have a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission, while the SQ5 has an eight-speed automatic. All-wheel drive is standard.\n\nPricing and Availability\n\nThe 2024 Q5 and SQ5 lineup will go on sale later this year. Pricing is as follows (all prices include a $1,195 destination charge).\n\nQ5\nQ5 40: $45,795\nQ5 45: $48,695\nQ5 55 (PHEV): $58,995\nQ5 Sportback 45: $52,695\nSQ5\nSQ5: $58,195\nSQ5 Sportback: $61,595\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2023 Audi Q5, SQ5 See New Equipment, Price Increases in New Year\n2021 Audi SQ5 Review: Not as Racy as It Looks, and That’s OK\n2021 Audi Q5 Vs. 2021 Lincoln Corsair: Which Plug-in Hybrid Luxury SUV Should You Buy?\n2021 Audi Q5 Sportback Review: As Practical as It Can Be\nWhich Cars Have Panoramic Moonroofs or Sunroofs?\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Audi Q5?\n\nThe Audi Q5 is a five-seat compact luxury SUV with standard all-wheel drive and a choice of four powertrains. Motivating the base Q5 is a 201-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder paired with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. A 261-hp turbo four-cylinder is next, followed by the 349-hp, turbo 3.0-liter V-6 found in the performance-oriented SQ5.  If spending less at the pump is a priority, the Q5 also offers a plug-in hybrid variant, the Q5 e, that’s powered by an electric motor and a gas-fed turbo four-cylinder engine. Total output is a stout 362 hp, and it has an EPA-rated electric-only range of up to 23 miles.\n\nThe Q5 is notable for being offered in both standard SUV format and as the Q5 Sportback, which features a coupelike exterior design. Competitors include the BMW X3, Acura RDX, Lincoln Corsair and Volvo XC60.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Audi Q5?\n\nAdaptive cruise control is newly standard in all Q5 and SQ5 models. The Premium Plus trim gains a Bang & Olufsen sound system.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Audi Q5 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nAdaptive cruise control\n10.1-inch infotainment screen\nWireless Apple CarPlay, wired Android Auto\nWireless device charging\nWi-Fi hot spot\nDigital gauge cluster\nTri-zone climate control\nPower liftgate\nLeather seating\nHeated front seats\nBlind spot monitoring\nRear cross-traffic alert\nLane departure warning\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nHeated steering wheel\nSurround-view camera\nPanoramic roof\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nNappa leather upholstery\nAdaptive air suspension\nHead-up instrument display\nBang & Olufsen stereo \nShould I Buy the 2023 Audi Q5?\n\nThe Audi Q5 offers luxury SUV shoppers a wide range of engines, plus the peace of mind of standard all-wheel drive. Keep in mind, though, that this Audi’s option sheet is an expensive place to spend your time; the Q5’s price swells as you add features or move to models like the plug-in hybrid Q5 e or sporty SQ5. The cabin is, however, elegantly appointed and comfortable, and the infotainment system is easy to operate and quick to respond to driver inputs. The Sportback sacrifices some utility for style, so we’d stick with the Q5’s standard SUV configuration.",

      "expert_review": "Competes with: BMW X3, Genesis GV70, Mercedes-Benz GLC, Porsche Macan\n\nLooks like: The cherubic Q5 is entering its edgy teenage years\n\nPowertrain: 268-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder or 362-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 engine; seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission; all-wheel drive\n\nRelease date: May 2025\n\nAudi leans heavily on the Q5 family, which includes the SQ5 and coupe-styled Sportback versions of both models. The brand’s mid-size five-passenger SUV is not only its bestseller, but it has maintained that position despite being among the oldest designs in the brand’s showroom — but no more. While the previous-generation Q5 is already on sale for model-year 2025, there’s an all-new Q5 family set to replace it imminently, also as a 2025 model.\n\nRelated: 2021 Audi SQ5 Review: Not as Racy as It Looks, and That’s OK\n\nWhat Does the 2025 Audi Q5 Look Like?\n\nAudi says the new Q5’s design “has become even more expressive,” but we’d say it became expressive, period. Whereas the outgoing model relied on proportions and minimalism — as did all of Audi’s designs up until recently — the new vehicle wears far more dramatic sheet metal with pronounced detailing. The hood is no longer a soft, uniformly convex shape; it’s now slightly dished and slants aggressively down to the headlights, which are capped by squinting LED daytime running lights. Below that, Audi’s signature hexagonal grille is more rounded at the corners, with the mesh rounded in an echo of the brand’s four-rings logo.\n\nBolder sculpting on the lower body sides gives the appearance of a more sharply rising beltline, though the greenhouse shape appears to be nearly identical to the old model. The new model’s basic architecture is based heavily on the hard points of the old Q5, and its dimensions are likewise little changed.\n\nAudi continues to innovate with exterior lighting, and the Q5 sports a full-width three-dimensional LED taillight strip (an OLED piece is available). A light in the spoiler on SQ and Sportback variants illuminates the upper portion of the rear-window glass, improving its visibility to drivers behind. And, depending on trim level, drivers can select from up to eight DRL and taillight lighting signatures.\n\nDigital-Forward Interior\n\nInterior measurements, too, are in many cases identical. There is less headroom in the new Q5 than in the old, but leg and shoulder room remain about the same as before. In the Q5 Sportback, passenger space is mostly unchanged. However, the rear seat now adjusts fore and aft, and the bottom cushion tilts to help passengers find the most comfortable seating position. Audi says that maximum cargo volume with the rear seat folded grows to 56.9 cubic feet in the Q5 and 53.1 in the Sportback, up from 54.1 and 51.9, respectively.\n\nThere may be a similar amount of space inside the new Q5, but the cabin has been completely overhauled for a vastly more modern look. Instead of a traditional gauge-cluster binnacle and tacked-on infotainment display standing proud above the dash, the Q5 now sports an integrated 11.9-inch digital instrument cluster and 14.5-inch touchscreen. A 10.9-inch passenger display is optional, as is a head-up display that is larger than the one in the outgoing model and allows the driver to handle secondary functions like making phone calls or controlling the infotainment system through controls on the steering wheel.\n\nWhat Are the 2025 Audi Q5’s Powertrain Specs and MPG?\n\nThe Q5 family’s engine options carry over for 2025, but both are more powerful in the new generation. A turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder powers the Q5 and Sportback, now making 268 horsepower and 295 pounds-feet of torque, increases of 7 hp and 22 pounds-feet. It is expected to return a manufacturer-estimated 22/30/25 mpg city/highway/combined.\n\nIn the SQ5 and SQ5 Sportback, a turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 generates 362 hp and 406 pounds-feet, up 13 and 37, respectively. Audi says that one returns 19/26/22 mpg. A seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission and standard Quattro all-wheel drive back both engines.\n\nA suspension utilizing steel springs is standard, and the available adaptive air suspension is said to benefit from a greater differentiation between Comfort and Dynamic modes. Q5 buyers can choose between wheels ranging from 18 to 20 inches, while the Sportback rides on either 19s or 20s. On the SQ5 and SQ5 Sportback, 20-inch wheels are standard and 21s are available.\n\nSafety and Technology\n\nA robust suite of safety tech is standard on the new Q5, including forward collision warning with pedestrian detection, automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning, emergency steering assist, left-turn oncoming traffic alert, front cross-traffic alert, road-sign recognition and a driver attention monitor. When you reach your destination, standard Park Assist Plus automated parking takes the stress out of crowded lots.\n\nWhat Is the 2025 Audi Q5’s Release Date and Pricing?\n\nThe all-new 2025 Audi Q5 family is live on Audi’s online configurator now, and deliveries are set to begin in May. Full line pricing, including the $1,295 destination charge, is as follows:\n\nQ5: $53,495\nQ5 Sportback: $57,195\nSQ5: $66,095\nSQ5 Sportback: $68,895\n\nRelated Video:\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n7 Audi SUVs Earn IIHS Top Safety Pick Awards\nTariffs on Mexican, Canadian and Chinese Goods Could Affect These Cars the Most\nIIHS: Backseat-Passenger Safety Lacking in Some Mid-Size SUVs\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2022 Audi Q5 Sportback?\nFind Your Next Car\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
