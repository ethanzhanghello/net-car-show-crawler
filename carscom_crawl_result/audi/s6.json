      "expert_review": "It’s not hard to write a review of the new Audi S6 sports sedan. I mean, how hard can it be for an automotive journalist to enjoy a luxury sedan with a Lamborghini-sourced, 435-horsepower V-10 engine under its hood? Not very.\n\nMy week with the S6 flew by as quickly as the car passed semis on the highway — meaning really, really fast. I could say it was fantastic and end the entire review here, but then I wouldn’t get to keep my job.\n\nAudi Skin, Lamborghini Muscle\nThe S6 starts life as a regular A6 sedan, then adds that huge V-10 engine, larger wheels, stiffer shocks and springs, sport seats, body cladding and wicked LED headlights and gets sent off to the lucky customer who can afford the $80,000 (as-tested) price tag. That said, I don’t want anyone to think the transformation from luxury executive transport to ridiculously powerful executive transport is some kind of simple modification. The muscle-car battles between Audi, BMW and Mercedes-Benz today are just as serious as the ones between Chevy and Ford in the 1960s.\n\nUnlike the other German luxury carmakers, Audi has an Italian exotic in the family. Yep, it owns Lamborghini, and that made getting the engine that powers the Gallardo easy. The V-10 also powers Audi’s larger S8. Audi used its own Quattro all-wheel-drive system, not Lamborghini’s. I drove the S6 in sub-freezing temperatures and never lost confidence, even when the tachometer’s red needle was midway through its range.\n\nSurprisingly, the V-10 is quite domesticated. The S6 comes to life with a little warble and the cabin shimmies a bit, but no nasty snarl comes from the engine bay. That doesn’t happen until you hammer the accelerator down. When cruising, there’s hardly any unique sound at all; the cabin is nice and quiet navigating a rough highway commute.\n\nSwing the S6 out into the left lane with a clear view ahead, drop the accelerator and everything goes by in a flash. The V-10 awakens with a roar, and getting from 55 to 85 mph happens in a blink. Of course, the S6 can go much faster — at least 155 mph — but that would only be legal on the Autobahn. Why pay all that money for a range you won’t be able to use that much? Because the S6 makes life below 155 mph that much more exciting.\n\nUnfortunately, drag-strip racers won’t have as much fun as highway speed demons. The S6 doesn’t launch like a good-old muscle car from a dead stop. Even when using the manual-shift paddles on the steering wheel, it’s hard to get the car to realize its full potential. It almost reminds me of a turbo engine with a noticeable delay in über power delivery. Maybe it doesn’t matter, because S6 owners should be a bit more mature … right?\n\nBraking is accomplished with the help of monstrous 15.2-inch rotors up front and 13-inch discs in the back. You’d think applying the slightest amount of pressure to the brake pedal would result in intense grabby-ness, but unlike a lot of high-performance models, braking came at expected levels and at any speed.\n\nAudi knows that serious sports enthusiasts will opt for the RS 4, while sophisticated enthusiasts want to be able to go out to dinner without making their date sick from feeling every road imperfection sent through too-stiff shocks. The S6 plays the balance game extremely well. Besides, after you drop off the date you can regain that driving thrill in the time it takes to drop the gas pedal.\n\nDressy Interior Not Needed\nThe interior is very minimalist in design and varies little from the standard A6’s available all-black look. Only carbon fiber trim — I prefer the brushed aluminum in the standard A6 — and more-supportive sports seats really differentiate the S6. However, those seats make putting up with the carbon fiber worth it. The driver’s seat was supportive but comfortable, and didn’t hug too tightly, like those offered by BMW. I could spend hours on end flogging the S6 — and actually, I did just that — with not a crick in the back, neck or underside.\n\nSafety\nSince the Audi A6 is ranked as a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety — its highest award — there’s no reason the S6 wouldn’t garner the same ranking. There are standard side-impact airbags for the front seats, side curtain airbags and electronic stability control.\n\nS6 in the Market\nThere’s not much that really competes with the Audi S6, besides the BMW M5 and Mercedes-Benz E63 AMG. This trio of high-powered German sedans battles for the dollars of elite car buyers, and having driven both the M5 and S6, I’d lean toward the S6. It doesn’t have as much power, but its everyday ride is more pleasant and the styling is more subdued. If you’re in the market for any of these cars, the test drives should prove exciting enough for you to want to make your own decision quickly.\n\nAt the end of each day, I left the S6 with the feeling that this could be the last car I’d ever need for the rest of my life. Its styling is timeless, and the ride never crossed that thin line into harsh territory. And did I mention the V-10?\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe S6 is a high-performance version of Audi’s A6 sedan, which is covered separately in the Research section. While the A6 employs V-6 or V-8 power, the S6 has a 435-horsepower V-10. Both cars were lightly restyled for 2009. Competitors include the BMW 5 Series, Mercedes-Benz E-Class and Infiniti M.\n\nThe S6 packs a standard six-speed automatic transmission and Quattro all-wheel drive. The S6 comes only in one trim level, Prestige.\n\nExterior\nThe S6 looks the part of a gussied-up A6, with bumper-mounted LED lights in place of the A6’s lower fog lights. Unique front and rear bumpers and aluminum trim on door- and windowsills complete the package.\n\nThe most distinct visual changes between 2008 and 2009 versions of the A6/S6 are in back. The trunk gets new chrome accents, and the taillights drop the ’08 model’s squared-off design for something closer to the new A4’s: They’re wider and carry around to the trunklid.\n\nThe S6 comes standard with 19-inch wheels.\n\nInterior\nBesides unique leather seats with S-line logos and thicker side bolsters, the S6’s wraparound cockpit sees few changes from the A6’s. The S6 does come loaded, though, with standard heated leather upholstery, power front seats, a moonroof and a navigation system; a Bose stereo with a six-CD changer and full iPod/USB compatibility also are standard.\n\nAudi’s Multi-Media Interface places a control knob with a few shortcut buttons around it ahead of the center console. Like BMW’s iDrive and Mercedes-Benz’s Comand, MMI governs various navigation and stereo functions through a central dashboard display. A third-generation MMI system is in store for the 2010 A6/S6, with improved graphics and better usability.\n\nThe short list of options includes heated rear seats and carbon fiber interior trim.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe S6 is stoked by Audi’s first-ever V-10 engine, a normally aspirated (not turbocharged, not supercharged) 5.2-liter with direct injection. It combines the generous torque characteristics of a high cylinder count with the high-rev output of a 7,000-rpm redline, delivering 398 pounds-feet of torque at 3,000-4,000 rpm (with 90 percent on tap at 2,300 rpm) and 435 hp at 6,800 rpm. Audi cites a zero-to-60-mph time of 5.1 seconds, a quarter-mile time of 13.4 seconds and a top speed electronically limited to 155 mph.\n\nThe S6’s Quattro all-wheel-drive system sends 60 percent of the torque to the rear wheels as a default, and up to 85 percent when called upon. The previous generation of Quattro for both cars split the torque 50/50, front/rear. The change gives the Audis equipped with the new Quattro dynamics closer to those of a rear-wheel-drive car.\n\nSafety\nBoth the A6 and S6 are rated Top Safety Picks by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, thanks to their top performance in frontal-, side- and rear-impact crashes.\n\nIn addition to the required frontal airbags, the S6 includes seat-mounted side-impact airbags for the front passengers, and side curtain bags that deploy along the front and rear side windows. Antilock brakes, traction control and an electronic stability system are also standard. Seat-mounted side-impact airbags for the backseat are optional, as is a blind spot warning system.",

      "expert_review": "There are few things more entertaining than blowing past a Corvette in a station wagon.\n\nYes, it’s possible, especially if the Corvette driver is surprised by the move. And believe me, few Corvette pilots expect to be challenged by a midsize station wagon.\n\nBut then, not every wagon is a 2002 Audi S6 Avant — or in the case of the tested model, an S6 Avant quattro AT5. The “quattro” name is Audi-speak for permanent all-wheel drive, a feature that dovetails nicely with the 4.2-liter, 340 horsepower V-8 engine with five valves per cylinder.\n\nOh, yes, this is one red-hot wagon.\n\nWhen asked, the S6 Avant delivers big-time. It can whip through a hard, flat corner at 80 mph with nary a wiggle. Like a monorail.\n\nMaximum torque is laid down at a mere 3,400 revolutions per minute. The monster torque output is managed beautifully through the five-speed “Tiptronic” transmission, the “quattro” AWD, an anti-slip system and an electronic stability system.\n\nThe S6 Avant feels much lighter on its wheels than its advertised curb weight of 4,024 pounds — the zero-to-60 mph time is 6.8 seconds. Four-wheel vented disc brakes bring all that weight to a stop quickly and firmly. There’s even a brake-assist system that automatically activates maximum brake pressure in an emergency.\n\nTo be sure, there are trade-offs for all this performance.\n\nFuel economy is an absolutely forgettable 14 miles per gallon in city driving and 21 mpg on the highway. And don’t even get me started on the $2,100 gas guzzler tax on the car’s sticker.\n\nWith a base price of $58,700, you naturally want something more than Trans Am-like performance. Relax, the Audi S6 Avant has plenty of luxury, comfort and convenience features to make you feel appropriately spoiled.\n\nA short list of standard amenities on the tested model included dual-zone climate control, heated 12-way power front seats, a power-adjustable steering column, wood inlays throughout the interior cabin and a premium sound system with six-disc CD changer.\n\nThe test Audi also came with a navigation system, a $1,350 option that included all the bells and whistles. Had I forgotten my briefcase, I’m certain the navigation system would have audibly informed me of that, with stern warnings about the consequences of future oversights.\n\nHappily, Audi designers resisted the temptation to overdo the exterior to match the S6 Avant’s hot-rod characteristics. Styling is sporty, not gaudy.\n\nNice touches include the polished aluminum double grille, eye-catching cast alloy wheels, aluminum roof rails and dual exhaust tailpipes. And will wonders never cease — there’s a standard full-size spare tire complete with a cast alloy wheel!\n\nPer usual for Audi, safety features are numerous and excellent. Latest-generation air bags are positioned in the front and sides of the interior cabin. Curtain air bags are designed to keep occupants away from the wagon’s glass and roof pillars in the event of a side impact. Front seat belts include force limiters, and well-padded head restraints are standard on all seating positions in the vehicle.\n\nThe standard warranty is four years/50,000 miles, with four years of 24-hour roadside assistance part of the deal.\n\nIs this a wagon for the well-to-do? You bet your quattro it is.\n\nBut given the level of engineering in the Audi S6 Avant, the nearly $60,000 price seems like a bargain — especially if your idea of fun is putting one over on a Corvette driver.\n\nMake/model: 2002 Audi S6 Avant quattro AT5.\n\nVehicle type: Midsize, five-passenger, all-wheel drive, luxury sport wagon.\n\nBase price: $58,700 (as tested, $62,975).\n\nEngine: 4.2-liter V-8 with 340 horsepower at 7,000 revolutions per minute and 310 foot-pounds of torque at 3,400 rpm.\n\nEPA fuel economy: 14 miles per gallon city; 21 mpg highway.\n\nTransmission: Electronic five-speed automatic with “Tiptronic” manual shifting mode, “quattro” permanent all-wheel drive and other special features.\n\nSteering: Power rack and pinion with speed-sensitive feature.\n\nBrakes: Four-wheel vented discs with power, anti-lock and other special features.\n\nSuspension type: Four-link on front with control arms and stabilizer bar; double-A arm fully independent on rear with stabilizer bar and coil springs.\n\nInterior volume: 98.3 cubic feet.\n\nCargo volume: 36.4 cubic feet (73.2 cubic feet with rear seat folded).\n\nFuel tank: 21.7 gallons.\n\nCurb weight: 4,024 pounds.\n\nFront track: 62.1 inches.\n\nRear track: 62.6 inches.\n\nHeight: 57 inches.\n\nLength: 193.4 inches.\n\nWheelbase: 108.6 inches.\n\nWidth: 76.1 inches.\n\nTires: P255/40ZR17 high-performance tires.\n\nFinal assembly point: Neckarsulm, Germany.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nIntroduced for the 2002 model year as a high-performance companion to the A6 Avant wagon, the S6 Avant features a sport suspension, 17-inch Avus alloy wheels and gray birch wood interior trim. Both of these midsize Avant wagons from Volkswagens luxury division get only a modest list of changes for the 2003 model year. A passenger-side seat memory is no longer standard, and the interior monitoring system was decoupled from the S6 Avants alarm. LATCH child-safety seat anchors and tethers have been added to the two rear seating positions.\n\nIn contrast to the 220-horsepower, 3.0-liter V-6 engine that powers the A6 Avant, the performance-oriented S6 Avant gets a 4.2-liter V-8 that whips up 340 hp. Both wagons are equipped with Audis quattro permanently engaged all-wheel-drive system and a five-speed-automatic transmission.\n\nExterior\nSmooth, flowing lines highlight the A6 series and its S6 cousin. The A6 first debuted in 1998 and earned a front-end restyling two years later. Freshening for 2002 included a new front end with clear glass headlights. Xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights are standard, and front and rear fog lights are installed on all Avants. Servotronic speed-sensitive steering is standard on the S6 Avant.\n\nAs part of its sport suspension, the S6 Avants body has been lowered by 20 millimeters, its spring rates are 30 percent stiffer than usual, and larger-diameter stabilizer bars are installed. Six-spoke cast-alloy wheels hold 17-inch performance tires. Other than the aluminum hood, Audi bodies are made of fully galvanized steel and are covered for 12 years against corrosion. The S6 Avants roof rails are aluminum-trimmed.\n\nInterior\nAudi buyers expect elegance, and thats what they get in both the A6 and S6 Avants. Both have ample room for five adults, with heated front seats and a split, folding rear seat. An optional rear-facing third seat holds two children. A retractable/removable rear cargo cover and a power rear sunshade are standard. Cargo volume behind the rear seat is 36.4 cubic feet, which grows to 73.2 cubic feet when that seat is folded down.\n\nWood trim on the doors, center console and the dashboard adds a touch of warmth. Leather seating surfaces are standard. Audis Symphony II stereo system comes with a cassette player and an in-dash six-CD changer, and it works with a Bose 200-watt premium sound system that includes a subwoofer. Parktronic parking-assist and navigation systems are optional.\n\nUnder the Hood\nBefitting its high-performance status, the S6 Avant holds a 340-hp, 4.2-liter V-8 engine. The five-speed-automatic transmission employs a Sport mode and a Tiptronic manual-shifting provision that operates with switches mounted on the steering wheel. Audis Dynamic Shift Program and hill-detection capability select from more than 200 shift patterns.\n\nSafety\nSide-impact airbags are standard for the front seats and optional for rear occupants. Curtain-type airbags deploy along the front and rear side windows during a side-impact collision. Antilock brakes and Audis Electronic Stabilization Program are standard.\n\nDriving Impressions\nThe S6 Avant is no ordinary wagon. Buyers of this car get all the luxury touches of the A6 Avant, as well as a smooth ride, quiet operation and confident handling characteristics. They also benefit from V-8 power, which translates into seriously energetic action whenever the gas pedal is pressed.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2003 Buying Guide\nPosted on 12/18/02",

      "expert_review": "After taking a year off, the high-performance 2013 Audi S6 returns as a more refined sports sedan, upping the ante in both style and acceleration.\n\nLast seen as a 2011 model, the old S6 used a Lamborghini-sourced, 435-horsepower, V-10 engine with great exotic-car sounds and horrible exotic-car gas mileage. The 2013 S6’s new 420-hp, twin-turbocharged V-8 may be less powerful and use two fewer cylinders, but less is definitely more with the 2013 S6’s improved gas mileage and acceleration. Compare the V-8 and V-10 S6 models here.\n\nWhat’s also less for 2013 is the car’s $72,795 price tag — with destination — compared with 2011’s $77,750. That puts the S6 in the thick of performance sedans like the Cadillac CTS-V, BMW M5 and Mercedes-Benz E63 AMG. Among those sedans, the S6’s elegant interior and refined performance — not its track-day potential — differentiate the Audi S6.\n\nAcceleration & Handling\nA 420-hp rating doesn’t begin to describe how viciously the S6 accelerates from a standstill, despite being down on power compared with its 500-plus-hp competition. Audi’s new twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 is silky-smooth, refined and Lexus-quiet through the whole neck-snapping rev range, thanks to microphones that pick up and cancel out unwanted noises through the car’s stereo.\n\nZero-to-60 mph takes 4.5 seconds, which is one-tenth of a second slower than Audi’s exotic R8 coupe with a 4.2-liter V-8 and manual transmission. It’s more than half a second faster than the previous S6, at 5.1 seconds. Audi’s zero-to-60-mph estimates don’t account for the S6’s standard launch control, giving it consistent fast starts from a standstill. After 60 mph, the S6 runs out of steam, whereas the more-powerful BMW M5 or CTS-V keep acceleration going into triple-digit speeds. Getting to 60 mph in the S6 is a drama-free thrill with all-wheel drive and grin-inducing launch control. You can have fun in the S6 without worrying about triple-digit speeds and quadruple-digit speeding tickets coming up too fast. Compare the S6 against the M5, CTS-V and E63 here.\n\nThe switch to a turbocharged V-8 instead of a 5.2-liter V-10 is welcome. The V-10 needed a lot of revs to make power and get that boat moving, which was 88 pounds heavier. Read our review of the previous S6 here. The 2013 S6 doesn’t have that problem, as both turbochargers pour on the power and torque at low engine speeds to help the S6 at any engine speed. Peak torque comes at 1,400 rpm and lasts well into the rev range for consistent acceleration.\n\nStill, some editors noted turbocharger hesitation between when the accelerator pedal hits the floorboard and when the car picks up and goes — in both normal and sportier Dynamic modes, both from a stop and at cruising speeds. The Audi S6 has three engine and suspension modes: Comfort, Auto and Dynamic.\n\nThere’s also room for improvement with the seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission, which is the only one offered. The high-tech transmission upshifts lightning quick without hesitation, but its downshifts are clunky and jarring in Dynamic sport mode when slowing to a stop. Passengers were jolted by the unnecessarily rough downshifts, so if you carry around business clients, keep the S6 out of Dynamic mode to maintain the car’s otherwise-refined attributes.\n\nNot only faster than the 2011 S6, the 2013 is more efficient, with gas mileage ratings of 17/27/20 mpg city/highway/combined, versus 14/21/16 mpg with the V-10. Cylinder deactivation helps bump gas mileage and is undetectable through the use of sound-canceling and self-adjusting engine mounts that hide vibrations.\n\nWhile most grins come from the S6’s acceleration, the sedan’s handling chops aren’t as sports-car oriented as the CTS-V or M5. Though the S6’s standard air suspension with adjustable firmness and ride height is considerably more comfortable for everyday driving, it doesn’t plant the S6 like the CTS-V or BMW M5. The S6 is mild-mannered, and its docile handling and all-wheel drive make the sedan a more predictable year-round driver. Worth noting, however, is the Audi’s great steering feel; its heft and precision aren’t common among Audis.\n\nExecutive Style\nThe S6 has an interior Tron himself would be proud of: Bright-colored LEDs in the instrument cluster and door sills do their best impersonation of a light cycle. There isn’t a moment where the $72,795 starting price tag is questionable. Authentic carbon fiber trim (a $500 option) adds a race-car-like touch, and the diamond-quilted Lunar Silver leather interior is standard. Compare the S6 with A6 models here. Every button and knob actuates with high-quality heft and a defined click.\n\nFront and rear occupants ride in style, with nicely appointed seats that are as comfy as the quilted leather pattern looks — as long as you’re not in the rear’s center seat, which is elevated above the outboard seats and makes passengers straddle a huge center floor hump. The S6 is realistically a four-seat luxury car, not a five-seater.\n\nMost performance versions of cars sacrifice comfort or interior noise and vibration characteristics to achieve heightened performance goals. The S6 isn’t a hard-core track car like its competitors, and it embraces its street ability with a soft ride in Comfort mode and quiet interior on the highway. Remember, however, this is still a sedan capable of acceleration as quick as an R8 supercar. The optional 20-inch wheels and summer tires throw road noise into the cabin, though it’s not hugely noticeable.\n\nThe S6’s understated exterior has subtle additions, such as silver mirrors, an S-specific grille, front and rear bumpers plus rear diffuser and spoiler, and quad tailpipes. Only those in tune with Audi’s subtle performance touches will recognize the changes.\n\nTechnology\nTallying up the optional equipment on our test car added $14,925 to the S6’s starting price, for a grand total of $87,720. Optional equipment included LED headlights and LED daytime running lights, 20-inch wheels with summer tires, a $5,900 Bang & Olufsen stereo and a $5,650 Innovation Package that included adaptive cruise control, active lane assist, a head-up display and night vision.\n\nThe optional Bang & Olufsen stereo failed to impress us. The stereo’s bass distortion was noticeable, and it didn’t have the detail of earlier examples in the Audi S8 and Q7, where the high price equaled a far superior sound system. Most offensive is that the stereo is iPod-only, and only using a 30-pin connector, which means there’s no USB input for non-compatible phones to even charge. To top it off, the latest iPhone 5 connector doesn’t work without an adapter either.\n\nControlling the stereo and other car functions was also a disappointment, as it requires Audi’s Multi Media Interface knob-based control system instead of a touch-screen. A touch-pad provides music presets and allows you to “draw” letters and numbers sequentially using your fingertip to enter destinations for the navigation system. It worked well for some editors and proved overly sensitive for others, who could accidentally change radio presets with a light graze. Additionally, there are no real buttons for selecting among the multiple driving modes. Any change in Comfort, Dynamic or Auto modes is done through the clunky screen and knob system. You should be able to switch easily between different modes on the fly. BMW has it 100 percent right with its programmable steering-wheel controls for drive modes.\n\nSafety\nNeither the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety nor the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has crash-tested the 2013 Audi S6. The S6 has eight standard air bags: front, front-seat side-impact, side curtains for front and rear occupants, and driver/front passenger knee airbags. Backseat side-impact torso airbags are an extra $350. See the S6’s list of safety features here.\n\nNumerous technological safety aids are optional, including active lane assist, to keep the car from veering off the road; Audi Pre Sense Plus, which warns when a vehicle is stopped ahead of you; and a blind spot monitor with side mirror warning lights, which can be adjusted to your desired brightness. Active lane assist subtly moves the car toward the center of the road when it strays too close to the striped line, though sometimes the S6 played pong between the lines.\n\nSee how well child-safety seats fit in the S6 here.\n\nS6 in the Market\nThe S6 is an executive hot rod with a new V-8 that’s good enough we don’t miss the old V-10 — except maybe that engine’s exotic sound. But every other nod goes to the new engine with improved gas mileage, refinement and performance.\n\nThe S6’s zero-to-60 mph acceleration is the kind of fun you can have without worrying about getting into the kind of trouble you might in a high-horsepower, rear-wheel-drive CTS-V or M5 super sedan. The S6 is a tamer, less complete performance package than those competitors, but it’s also a more livable daily driver with a wow factor on the inside thanks to authentic materials and high-tech design.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in June 2013 about the 2013 Audi S6. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2014, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nAfter taking a year off, the high-performance 2013 Audi S6 returns as a more refined sports sedan, upping the ante in both style and acceleration.\n\nLast seen as a 2011 model, the old S6 used a Lamborghini-sourced, 435-horsepower, V-10 engine with great exotic-car sounds and horrible exotic-car gas mileage. The 2013 S6’s new 420-hp, twin-turbocharged V-8 may be less powerful and use two fewer cylinders, but less is definitely more with the 2013 S6’s improved gas mileage and acceleration. Compare the V-8 and V-10 S6 models here.\n\nWhat’s also less for 2013 is the car’s $72,795 price tag — with destination — compared with 2011’s $77,750. That puts the S6 in the thick of performance sedans like the Cadillac CTS-V, BMW M5 and Mercedes-Benz E63 AMG. Among those sedans, the S6’s elegant interior and refined performance — not its track-day potential — differentiate the Audi S6.\n\nAcceleration & Handling\nA 420-hp rating doesn’t begin to describe how viciously the S6 accelerates from a standstill, despite being down on power compared with its 500-plus-hp competition. Audi’s new twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 is silky-smooth, refined and Lexus-quiet through the whole neck-snapping rev range, thanks to microphones that pick up and cancel out unwanted noises through the car’s stereo.\n\nZero-to-60 mph takes 4.5 seconds, which is one-tenth of a second slower than Audi’s exotic R8 coupe with a 4.2-liter V-8 and manual transmission. It’s more than half a second faster than the previous S6, at 5.1 seconds. Audi’s zero-to-60-mph estimates don’t account for the S6’s standard launch control, giving it consistent fast starts from a standstill. After 60 mph, the S6 runs out of steam, whereas the more-powerful BMW M5 or CTS-V keep acceleration going into triple-digit speeds. Getting to 60 mph in the S6 is a drama-free thrill with all-wheel drive and grin-inducing launch control. You can have fun in the S6 without worrying about triple-digit speeds and quadruple-digit speeding tickets coming up too fast. Compare the S6 against the M5, CTS-V and E63 here.\n\nThe switch to a turbocharged V-8 instead of a 5.2-liter V-10 is welcome. The V-10 needed a lot of revs to make power and get that boat moving, which was 88 pounds heavier. Read our review of the previous S6 here. The 2013 S6 doesn’t have that problem, as both turbochargers pour on the power and torque at low engine speeds to help the S6 at any engine speed. Peak torque comes at 1,400 rpm and lasts well into the rev range for consistent acceleration.\n\nStill, some editors noted turbocharger hesitation between when the accelerator pedal hits the floorboard and when the car picks up and goes — in both normal and sportier Dynamic modes, both from a stop and at cruising speeds. The Audi S6 has three engine and suspension modes: Comfort, Auto and Dynamic.\n\nThere’s also room for improvement with the seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission, which is the only one offered. The high-tech transmission upshifts lightning quick without hesitation, but its downshifts are clunky and jarring in Dynamic sport mode when slowing to a stop. Passengers were jolted by the unnecessarily rough downshifts, so if you carry around business clients, keep the S6 out of Dynamic mode to maintain the car’s otherwise-refined attributes.\n\nNot only faster than the 2011 S6, the 2013 is more efficient, with gas mileage ratings of 17/27/20 mpg city/highway/combined, versus 14/21/16 mpg with the V-10. Cylinder deactivation helps bump gas mileage and is undetectable through the use of sound-canceling and self-adjusting engine mounts that hide vibrations.\n\nWhile most grins come from the S6’s acceleration, the sedan’s handling chops aren’t as sports-car oriented as the CTS-V or M5. Though the S6’s standard air suspension with adjustable firmness and ride height is considerably more comfortable for everyday driving, it doesn’t plant the S6 like the CTS-V or BMW M5. The S6 is mild-mannered, and its docile handling and all-wheel drive make the sedan a more predictable year-round driver. Worth noting, however, is the Audi’s great steering feel; its heft and precision aren’t common among Audis.\n\nExecutive Style\nThe S6 has an interior Tron himself would be proud of: Bright-colored LEDs in the instrument cluster and door sills do their best impersonation of a light cycle. There isn’t a moment where the $72,795 starting price tag is questionable. Authentic carbon fiber trim (a $500 option) adds a race-car-like touch, and the diamond-quilted Lunar Silver leather interior is standard. Compare the S6 with A6 models here. Every button and knob actuates with high-quality heft and a defined click.\n\nFront and rear occupants ride in style, with nicely appointed seats that are as comfy as the quilted leather pattern looks — as long as you’re not in the rear’s center seat, which is elevated above the outboard seats and makes passengers straddle a huge center floor hump. The S6 is realistically a four-seat luxury car, not a five-seater.\n\nMost performance versions of cars sacrifice comfort or interior noise and vibration characteristics to achieve heightened performance goals. The S6 isn’t a hard-core track car like its competitors, and it embraces its street ability with a soft ride in Comfort mode and quiet interior on the highway. Remember, however, this is still a sedan capable of acceleration as quick as an R8 supercar. The optional 20-inch wheels and summer tires throw road noise into the cabin, though it’s not hugely noticeable.\n\nThe S6’s understated exterior has subtle additions, such as silver mirrors, an S-specific grille, front and rear bumpers plus rear diffuser and spoiler, and quad tailpipes. Only those in tune with Audi’s subtle performance touches will recognize the changes.\n\nTechnology\nTallying up the optional equipment on our test car added $14,925 to the S6’s starting price, for a grand total of $87,720. Optional equipment included LED headlights and LED daytime running lights, 20-inch wheels with summer tires, a $5,900 Bang & Olufsen stereo and a $5,650 Innovation Package that included adaptive cruise control, active lane assist, a head-up display and night vision.\n\nThe optional Bang & Olufsen stereo failed to impress us. The stereo’s bass distortion was noticeable, and it didn’t have the detail of earlier examples in the Audi S8 and Q7, where the high price equaled a far superior sound system. Most offensive is that the stereo is iPod-only, and only using a 30-pin connector, which means there’s no USB input for non-compatible phones to even charge. To top it off, the latest iPhone 5 connector doesn’t work without an adapter either.\n\nControlling the stereo and other car functions was also a disappointment, as it requires Audi’s Multi Media Interface knob-based control system instead of a touch-screen. A touch-pad provides music presets and allows you to “draw” letters and numbers sequentially using your fingertip to enter destinations for the navigation system. It worked well for some editors and proved overly sensitive for others, who could accidentally change radio presets with a light graze. Additionally, there are no real buttons for selecting among the multiple driving modes. Any change in Comfort, Dynamic or Auto modes is done through the clunky screen and knob system. You should be able to switch easily between different modes on the fly. BMW has it 100 percent right with its programmable steering-wheel controls for drive modes.\n\nSafety\nNeither the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety nor the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has crash-tested the 2013 Audi S6. The S6 has eight standard air bags: front, front-seat side-impact, side curtains for front and rear occupants, and driver/front passenger knee airbags. Backseat side-impact torso airbags are an extra $350. See the S6’s list of safety features here.\n\nNumerous technological safety aids are optional, including active lane assist, to keep the car from veering off the road; Audi Pre Sense Plus, which warns when a vehicle is stopped ahead of you; and a blind spot monitor with side mirror warning lights, which can be adjusted to your desired brightness. Active lane assist subtly moves the car toward the center of the road when it strays too close to the striped line, though sometimes the S6 played pong between the lines.\n\nSee how well child-safety seats fit in the S6 here.\n\nS6 in the Market\nThe S6 is an executive hot rod with a new V-8 that’s good enough we don’t miss the old V-10 — except maybe that engine’s exotic sound. But every other nod goes to the new engine with improved gas mileage, refinement and performance.\n\nThe S6’s zero-to-60 mph acceleration is the kind of fun you can have without worrying about getting into the kind of trouble you might in a high-horsepower, rear-wheel-drive CTS-V or M5 super sedan. The S6 is a tamer, less complete performance package than those competitors, but it’s also a more livable daily driver with a wow factor on the inside thanks to authentic materials and high-tech design.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in February 2007 about the 2007 Audi S6. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what details are different this year, check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nIt’s not hard to write a review of the new Audi S6 sports sedan. I mean, how hard can it be for an automotive journalist to enjoy a luxury sedan with a Lamborghini-sourced, 435-horsepower V-10 engine under its hood? Not very.\n\nMy week with the S6 flew by as quickly as the car passed semis on the highway — meaning really, really fast. I could say it was fantastic and end the entire review here, but then I wouldn’t get to keep my job.\n\nAudi Skin, Lamborghini Muscle\nThe S6 starts life as a regular A6 sedan, then adds that huge V-10 engine, larger wheels, stiffer shocks and springs, sport seats, body cladding and wicked LED headlights and gets sent off to the lucky customer who can afford the $80,000 (as-tested) price tag. That said, I don’t want anyone to think the transformation from luxury executive transport to ridiculously powerful executive transport is some kind of simple modification. The muscle-car battles between Audi, BMW and Mercedes-Benz today are just as serious as the ones between Chevy and Ford in the 1960s.\n\nUnlike the other German luxury carmakers, Audi has an Italian exotic in the family. Yep, it owns Lamborghini, and that made getting the engine that powers the Gallardo easy. The V-10 also powers Audi’s larger S8. Audi used its own Quattro all-wheel-drive system, not Lamborghini’s. I drove the S6 in sub-freezing temperatures and never lost confidence, even when the tachometer’s red needle was midway through its range.\n\nSurprisingly, the V-10 is quite domesticated. The S6 comes to life with a little warble and the cabin shimmies a bit, but no nasty snarl comes from the engine bay. That doesn’t happen until you hammer the accelerator down. When cruising, there’s hardly any unique sound at all; the cabin is nice and quiet navigating a rough highway commute.\n\nSwing the S6 out into the left lane with a clear view ahead, drop the accelerator and everything goes by in a flash. The V-10 awakens with a roar, and getting from 55 to 85 mph happens in a blink. Of course, the S6 can go much faster — at least 155 mph — but that would only be legal on the Autobahn. Why pay all that money for a range you won’t be able to use that much? Because the S6 makes life below 155 mph that much more exciting.\n\nUnfortunately, drag-strip racers won’t have as much fun as highway speed demons. The S6 doesn’t launch like a good-old muscle car from a dead stop. Even when using the manual-shift paddles on the steering wheel, it’s hard to get the car to realize its full potential. It almost reminds me of a turbo engine with a noticeable delay in über power delivery. Maybe it doesn’t matter, because S6 owners should be a bit more mature … right?\n\nBraking is accomplished with the help of monstrous 15.2-inch rotors up front and 13-inch discs in the back. You’d think applying the slightest amount of pressure to the brake pedal would result in intense grabby-ness, but unlike a lot of high-performance models, braking came at expected levels and at any speed.\n\nAudi knows that serious sports enthusiasts will opt for the RS 4, while sophisticated enthusiasts want to be able to go out to dinner without making their date sick from feeling every road imperfection sent through too-stiff shocks. The S6 plays the balance game extremely well. Besides, after you drop off the date you can regain that driving thrill in the time it takes to drop the gas pedal.\n\nDressy Interior Not Needed\nThe interior is very minimalist in design and varies little from the standard A6’s available all-black look. Only carbon fiber trim — I prefer the brushed aluminum in the standard A6 — and more-supportive sports seats really differentiate the S6. However, those seats make putting up with the carbon fiber worth it. The driver’s seat was supportive but comfortable, and didn’t hug too tightly, like those offered by BMW. I could spend hours on end flogging the S6 — and actually, I did just that — with not a crick in the back, neck or underside.\n\nSafety\nSince the Audi A6 is ranked as a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety — its highest award — there’s no reason the S6 wouldn’t garner the same ranking. There are standard side-impact airbags for the front seats, side curtain airbags and electronic stability control.\n\nS6 in the Market\nThere’s not much that really competes with the Audi S6, besides the BMW M5 and Mercedes-Benz E63 AMG. This trio of high-powered German sedans battles for the dollars of elite car buyers, and having driven both the M5 and S6, I’d lean toward the S6. It doesn’t have as much power, but its everyday ride is more pleasant and the styling is more subdued. If you’re in the market for any of these cars, the test drives should prove exciting enough for you to want to make your own decision quickly.\n\nAt the end of each day, I left the S6 with the feeling that this could be the last car I’d ever need for the rest of my life. Its styling is timeless, and the ride never crossed that thin line into harsh territory. And did I mention the V-10?\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "In some quarters the station wagon may be headed for the history books — but not at Audi of America, Inc.\n\nAudi unveiled its guided-missile S6 wagon at the New York Auto Show earlier this month, and devotees of high-performance station-wagon motoring will find this dragon wagon is alive and breathing fire.\n\nTurbocharging, Quattro four-wheel-drive and a top speed of 145 mph — which for some reason has been detuned to 130 mph for the United States — put Audi into a unique market segment.\n\nNot everybody wants a van, yet needs to haul seven people. And if you want to do that in a hurry and in any kind of weather, the S6 has something to offer.\n\nThe company says the S6 will be the highest-performance station wagon sold in the United States when it reaches Audi dealers’ showrooms this summer.\n\n“We can take orders for it now,” said Chad Spidle, new-car sales manager for Audi dealer Tom Wood, Inc. “I’d say you’re looking at 60 to 90 days before it would be delivered.”\n\nIn introducing the wagon in New York, the German automaker emphasized the S6’s role as a personalized specialty wagon. Audi of America Vice President Gerd Klauss said, “The S6 will appeal to those who are looking for a unique combination of performance, high style, luxury and utility.”\n\n{That sort of covers all the bases, and represents a type of vehicle not commonly represented in station-wagon mode. The four-door vehicle has sports-car performance characteristics and utility features not available in two-seaters.\n\nGenerally in exterior styling, a wagon is a wagon. But the S6 has a sleekness that transcends the mundane. With a low nose, steeply raked windshield and even a fairly well raked rear window, the aerodynamics- friendly wagon qualifies as more than just another pretty face in a country-club parking lot.\n\nThe styling borrows from Audi’s AVUS concept car and includes new AVUS-type 16-inch light alloy six-spoke wheels. A little bit of personal styling is available through optional 215/60 VR-rated 15-inch all-weather tires and 15-inch wheels at no extra cost. Standard for the S6 are 225/50 ZR 16-inch tires.\n\nThe rubber and the four-wheel drive are designed to get hold of the pavement at speed. I’m going to speculate that it will be an easy vehicle to drive with the hammer down.\n\nWith power to all four wheels, linear and cornering stability are tremendously enhanced. And the wagon’s ZR- and VR-rated tires are designed for maximum traction.\n\nUnder the hood, Audi has gone the exotic route with five cylinders, turbocharging, double overhead cams and four valves per cylinder. It’s hard to get any more racy than that.\n\nFive-cylinder engines have tended to be the province of import manufacturers.\n\nAudi’s 2.2-liter (136-cubic-inch) in-line would fit a four-cylinder 16-valve configuration, but adding another cylinder provides a smoother-running motor and creates a base for more power.\n\nThrough turbocharging, Audi’s 2.2 develops a muscular 227 horsepower. That’s almost 1.7 ho rse per cubic inch, a figure that gets you into muscle-car territory in the truest sense of the word.\n\nThere’s a tendency for smaller, high-performance engines to produce lots of horsepower, but be weak on torque. Not this one.\n\nTorque is rated at 258 foot-pounds, the equivalent of some much-larger nonturbocharged V6s. And that accounts for the acceleration characteristics of the S6.\n\nThe wagon is a driver’s vehicle, as the transmission is a five-speed manual hooked to a permanently engaged all-wheel drive. Coming off the line with all four wheels driving, 0- 60 mph comes in at 6.6 seconds, equivalent to some pretty big performance cars.\n\nThe Quattro system automatically splits the power between the front and rear driving wheels, dependent on driving conditions. It makes the wagon a very tractable vehicle whether the road is dry or slippery.\n\nThe performance factor is only part of the S6 story. It’s an expensive wagon and therefore offers a full line of comfort ameni ties and util ity conveniences.\n\nAvailable is 65.5 cubic feet of cargo space when the rear bench seat is folded down, and 33.9 cubic feet when up. For young passengers, the wagon has a unique rear-facing seat for two children that can be folded and concealed.\n\nAlso included among the S6’s myriad of features is an item that ought to be standard whenever cellular car phones are used. This system doesn’t require taking a hand off the steering wheel to hold it.\n\nThe Audi system is a hands-free cellular phone with voice recognition. Just talk and steer without letting go of the wheel.\n\nInterior styling takes cues from expensive automobiles: burled walnut wood throughout and Seiden Nappa leather upholstery. With the five-speed, there’s full instrumentation that includes an oil-pressure gauge. And standard is a complete range of power accessories and convenience items, all designed to make driving the wagon a memorable affair.\n\nObviously, this doesn’t come cheap. The S6 is a $47,000 item meant to function in a highly personalized manner.\n\n“It’s a real alternative to better-class sport/utility vehicles,” Spidle said. “And once our customers acquire knowledge of it, I’m expecting some real interest.”\n\n1995 Audi S6 Base price: $47,200.Type: Front engine, four-wheel drive, seven-passenger, station wagon.Engine: 2.2-liters, DOHC five-cylinders, 20 valves, fuel injected, turbocharged, 227- horsepower, 258 foot-pounds of torque.Transmission: Five-speed manual.Mileage: 18 mpg city/23 mpg highway.Acceleration: 0-60 mph in 6.6 seconds.Top speed: 145 miles per hour (electronically controlled 130 mph in United States).Wheelbase: 106.0 inches.Length: 192.6 inches.Width: 71.0 inches.Height: 59.0 inches.Options: Compact disc changer, instrument panel/door panels carbon fiber inlays, all-weather VR rated 15-inch tires/w 15- inch alloywheels, pearl effect white paint.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2021 Audi A6?\n\nThe Audi A6 is a mid-size luxury sedan that bridges the gap between the German automaker’s smaller A4 sedan and the full-size A8 sedan. Engines range from mild to wild, with the S6’s 444-horsepower, twin-turbocharged 2.9-liter V-6 falling into the latter category. \n\nBase sedans are powered by a 248-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that works with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. A 335-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 is available, and this engine also powers the Allroad wagon. All-wheel drive is standard. Competitors include the BMW 5 Series and Mercedes-Benz E-Class. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2021 Audi A6?\n\nThe A6 was redesigned for the 2019 model year; changes for 2021 consist of the reshuffling of some features within option packages. \n\nWhat Features in the 2021 Audi A6 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nDual center touchscreens\nLeather seating surfaces\nPower moonroof \nHeated front seats\nTri-zone automatic climate control\nApple CarPlay, Android Auto smartphone connectivity\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nLane-keeping assist\nAdaptive cruise control\nBang & Olufsen premium stereo\nHead-up display\nHeated steering wheel\n360-degree camera system\nSport suspension\nShould I Buy the 2021 Audi A6?\n\nWith a choice of body styles and powertrains, there’s probably an A6 that will meet your luxury car needs. Interior quality is a familiar Audi highlight, but we’re less impressed by the A6’s adoption of many touch-sensitive controls. The sedan’s trunk is also on the small side.",

      "expert_review": "Fast and fun, the 2016 Audi S6 takes a plain-Jane luxury commuter and transforms it into a highly satisfying sport sedan.\n\nFor Audi, turning an ordinary, smooth and creamy vanilla milkshake — the Audi A6 — into the tasty mocha-java-chip Frappuccino S6 is a relatively straightforward affair: Use the same strong, stiff base for both, but swap out the A6’s healthy four-cylinder powertrain for a highly caffeinated, twin-turbocharged V-8. Also, widen the track for a much more planted feel, and sprinkle on some visual flair in the form of big wheels, special body panels and a lowered, menacing look. The result is a sport sedan that’s far tastier than the mundane base from which it springs.\n\nSome updates for 2016, mostly centered around the car’s electronics, keep it up to date with competitors in its field. Compare the 2015 and 2016 models here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe changes to Audi’s midsize A6 sedan for 2016 are echoed in the sportier S6. New headlights and taillights are present, with revised LED signatures, and a wider grille up front creates a greater overall feeling of width for the car.\n\nThe S6 doesn’t need much improvement, frankly. As ordinary as the A6 looks, the S6 tweaks things just enough to communicate that this is not an ordinary luxury sedan; it’s packing something special under that sheet metal. It’s not as wild as it could be, but that kind of understated subtlety is what Audi buyers seem to be looking for. Its appeal is obvious.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe powertrain and suspension that change the A6 into the S6 totally transform the car. It goes from being a sleepy but solid luxury commuter to a rorty, snorty sport sedan.\n\nIt starts with replacing the A6’s four-cylinder or supercharged V-6 with a 450-horsepower, twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 engine, mated to a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission and Quattro all-wheel drive. It’s a wonderfully tractable engine that’s able to cruise freeways at a loping, easygoing pace or blast you through canyon roads at frenetic velocities, switchable in its temperament at the touch of a button.\n\nWell, not actually the touch of one button — not anymore. Audi has strangely eliminated the Audi Drive Select button on the dashboard that used to allow you to cycle between drive modes. Now you have to use the Audi Multi Media Interface controller to find and change the setting from Comfort to Sport in the system’s on-screen menus. Just the transmission can be shifted into a sport mode with a tap on the gear selector, but that changes only the transmission behavior.\n\nWith everything in Sport mode, the S6 is enormous fun. The engine delivers tremendous acceleration when called upon, accompanied by a sonorous exhaust note that will find you stabbing the go pedal just to hear the noise it makes. The wider track (the width between the car’s wheels, left to right) creates a much better sense of security and solidity, exhibiting excellent body control. There’s none of the body roll from the A6 when you make quick directional changes, and none of the floatiness that makes that car such a comfortable cruiser.\n\nPart of that can be attributed to the S6’s standard summer performance tires; if you want all-season ability, you’ll have to invest in different tires yourself later on. What you’re left with is a feeling of control, but not necessarily one of precision; steering feedback is still a step below competitors’ levels, and even switching into Sport mode doesn’t help this. All it does is increase the amount of effort required for steering input, not improve feedback at all.\n\nRide quality is excellent in any of the S6’s modes, with even the firmest setting coming across as perfectly comfortable for passengers. The car is an excellent answer for drivers who want excitement in their commute but aren’t ready to pony up to Audi’s truly hairy-chested RS models — in either image or price.\n\nThe S6 has several competitors from many different automakers. One might be tempted to put it up against the Mercedes-Benz E63 AMG or BMW M5, but that’s not necessarily a fair fight. Both the E63 and M5 are priced considerably higher than the S6; performance-wise, they’re more competitors for the only-available-in-Europe RS 6.\n\nInstead, consider the Cadillac CTS Vsport, featuring a twin-turbo V-6 but available only with rear-wheel drive. (Note that the Vsport is a new in-between trim level, not to be confused with the CTS-V, which is itself priced closer to the E63 and M5.) The Vsport has the power, looks and handling to go up against the S6, but it’s priced advantageously. The Jaguar XF-R is a bit too expensive, but the XF 5.0 Supercharged matches up well, with sexy bodywork, a classy interior and a powerful supercharged V-8.\n\nAn interesting alternative might be the Maserati Ghibli S Q4 — the all-wheel-drive, twin-turbocharged V-6 model. It’s slightly more expensive than the S6 and down a little in horsepower, but it has Italian passion and style that the buttoned-down S6 lacks.\n\nThe EPA rates the S6 18/27/21 mpg city/highway/combined, a rather respectable rating given its big engine and speedy capabilities. The S6 leads its competition in this regard. Cadillac’s twin-turbo, V-6 CTS Vsport is a thirstier beast despite its whopping 500-pound weight advantage, rated 16/24/18 mpg. The supercharged V-8 Jaguar XF is even worse, at 15/23/18 mpg, but the twin-turbo V-6 Maserati improves on this slightly, earning a rating of 16/24/19 mpg.\n\nInterior\nThe A6 was already a perfectly pleasant place to spend some time, and the S6 kicks this up another notch or two. Sport seats that are even more comfortable than the standard chairs are present and can be covered in some high-quality hides.\n\nFor 2016, a few new colors are available, including a red leather interior that looks absolutely dynamite. Everything is stitched, assembled, placed and glued together with a precision that’s still the benchmark for just about every other luxury brand.\n\nOutward visibility is excellent, with unmarred sight lines in every direction (the A-pillars are a bit thick, however, which can make tight, blind corners a bit of a challenge). The backseat is a bit tight, and while three can fit in a pinch, a pinch it will be for that center-seat passenger. The S6 has a lot of legroom on paper, but it still feels cramped for folks in the backseat.\n\nThe Jag has a similar feel, albeit with a little more attention to the artistry of the interior shapes and forms: High-quality wood, leather and metal combine to make the XF an attractive place, but passengers will find it cramped in back. The CTS Vsport is the top-of-the-line for the CTS until you get to the fire-breathing CTS-V, and Cadillac has done some fine work in its material selection for the interior. Sadly, that’s all undone by the black-plastic touch panels that control everything.\n\nCompared with the high-quality, precision feel of the Audi’s switches and controls, the CTS is an ergonomic mess, with no tactile feedback to anything (its haptic feedback vibration is an unsatisfactory substitute). It simply doesn’t feel like a luxury car. The Maserati, however, does, with excellent materials throughout and decent space for front occupants. Backseat riders will find legroom very cramped, however — an astonishing trait given the Ghibli claims to have 10 cubic feet more passenger space than the S6.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nElectronics news for 2016 has to do with the new Audi Multi Media Interface system, an updated multimedia package that’s faster, has better graphics resolution and finally features USB ports (two of them) instead of Audi’s proprietary connectors for smartphones. The new MMI retains the same operational feel as the old one, in which four buttons that correspond to the four corners of the screen surround a rotary knob. It’s super easy to use on the fly and doesn’t require you to look at your hand at all.\n\nThe new system is visibly faster (not that the old one felt slow), and features like real-time Google Maps for the navigation system seem much more fluid. In contrast, the Cadillac Cadillac User Experience system still requires some improvement. It’s slow to react to voice commands, swipes or even changing tracks on a plugged-in smartphone. Jaguar’s multimedia system feels older and less well-thought-out, even though its functions are fully up to date. The Maserati features a truly disappointing system: FCA’s Uconnect, which was carried over fully intact from your average $23,000 Dodge Dart. Not even the fonts or icons have been changed, and while it works perfectly fine, it looks like it should be in an economy car, not an $80,000 luxury sport sedan. It certainly doesn’t have the sophisticated look or feel of Audi’s MMI system.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe S6 is a fairly large car, and that’s reflected in its luggage capacity of 14.1 cubic feet of truck space. That space is expandable thanks to a standard split, folding rear seat. The CTS is smaller, offering only 13.7 cubic feet, but the Jaguar and Maserati top them both, each offering 17.7 cubic feet. Of the quartet, only the Jaguar doesn’t have a folding rear seat standard at these higher trim levels.\n\nSafety\nAs for crashworthiness, it doesn’t get any better than the 2016 S6’s results. The car scored a full five out of five stars across the board in National Highway Traffic Safety Administration crash tests. It aced the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s tests, as well, earning good ratings (out of a possible poor, marginal, acceptable and good) and a Top Safety Pick Plus award. See the S6’s crash-test results here.\n\nWith the updates for 2016 have come a few new electronic safety options, as well. In addition to previously available forward collision warning and blind spot alert, a new lane keeping assist feature now ties in with both, preventing you from changing lanes and accidentally merging into a car traveling in your rear blind spot.\n\nA night-vision system is available, and parking aids like a backup camera plus front and rear sensors are standard. More equipment comes standard on the S6 than the A6 due to its higher price tag; see what you get for your money here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe 2016 S6 starts at $71,825, a significant premium over the top gasoline-powered A6, which starts at $58,325. That premium has significant content upgrades, however, including the big V-8 engine, a heavily revised suspension and sporty content for the interior and exterior.\n\nThat price brings you in at the Premium Plus trim level, but opting for the Prestige trim bumps the price up to $76,225 and adds a Bose audio system, a head-up display, LED interior lighting, a power open/close trunk and sunshades for backseat passengers. Start adding option packages like the Sport or Driver Assistance Plus Packages, the night-vision camera or the Audi design selection interior appearance package and you can raise the price tag to more than $97,000.\n\nThe S6’s competitors are similarly capable but not necessarily similarly priced. The CTS Vsport undercuts the S6 by more than $10,000 to start, with a base model priced at $60,335. Opt for a loaded Premium trim and it still only comes to $70,335 — less than the starting price of an S6. Of course, it doesn’t have the same level of luxury equipment the S6 does, nor does it offer all-wheel drive, but it’s still an extraordinarily good driving machine.\n\nThe Jaguar XF Supercharged 5.0 starts at $71,870 for a 2015 model, almost identical to the S6’s starting price. There aren’t as many options to add as in an S6, so the Jag tops out at $77,445 but without the level of technology available in the Audi. Finally, the Maserati Ghibli is slightly more expensive — at least in the version that compares to the S6: the Ghibli Q4 S with its supercharged engine. That version starts at $79,150 (including a hefty $1,250 destination fee), but can be optioned up to more than $100,000 when you start picking luxury packages and fancier technology upgrades. Compare all four competitors here.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Audi’s A6 mid-size sedan was redesigned for 2019, and for 2020, the S6 model is rejoining the lineup. The sport-oriented version of the A6 sedan wears more aggressive styling and gets a new twin-turbocharged engine with a mild-hybrid component.\n\nRelated: ”A” for “Affordable”? 2019 Audi A6 Gets $4,800 Discount\n\nPower comes from a new twin-turbocharged 2.9-liter V-6 engine that’s good for 444 horsepower and 443 pounds-feet of torque. It pairs with an eight-speed automatic transmission. Audi says the S6 can sprint from zero-to-60 mph in 4.4 seconds.\n\nLike other recently redesigned Audi models, it uses the automaker’s new 48-volt mild-hybrid electric system, which Audi says improves responsiveness off the line as well as fuel economy. A motor-generator captures energy under deceleration and stores it in a battery. There’s no word yet on fuel economy estimates, however.\n\nAudi’s Quattro all-wheel drive is again standard, with 60 percent of the torque going to the rear axle and 40 percent to the front. The automaker says that, when needed, the system can redirect power to the opposite axle, sending up to 70 percent of torque to the front or up to 85 percent to the rear wheels. On top of that, the optional Quattro sport differential system can split torque between each of the rear wheels, including directing nearly all the torque to one wheel.\n\nOutside, the new S6 wears specific bumpers and a platinum, double-slat version of Audi’s signature grille, as well as aluminum exterior side mirrors. In back, it distinguishes itself from the rest of the lineup with cues like four S-specific tailpipes and a rear diffuser inlay in black chrome matte.\n\nInside, S6 extras include a heated, three-spoke multifunction steering wheel with an S emblem, Valcona leather S sport seats with diamond stitching and stainless-steel doorsills with illuminated S logos. Other standard features include a full-color head-up display, MMI navigation with two touchscreens (10.1-inch upper and 8.6-inch lower), Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration, and the Audi virtual cockpit system.\n\nThe 2020 Audi S6 will be available in Premium Plus and Prestige trims, starting at $74,895 for the former and $78,795 for the latter; both prices include a $995 destination charge. It goes on sale before the end of 2019.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2022 Audi A6?\n\nThe five-seat Audi A6 is a mid-size luxury sedan that bridges the gap between the smaller A4 and full-size A8. Engines range from mild to wild, with the S6’s 444-horsepower, turbocharged 2.9-liter V-6 falling into the latter category. Even crazier is the turbo V-8 offered in the RS 6 Avant, a tire-melting wagon with 591 hp. Both of these engines pair with an eight-speed automatic transmission.\n\nBase sedans are powered by a 261-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that works with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic. A 335-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 is also available, and this engine also powers the Allroad wagon. All-wheel drive is standard. Competitors include the BMW 5 Series, Genesis G80 and Mercedes-Benz E-Class.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2022 Audi A6?\n\nNew standard features include a 10.1-inch navigation screen, rear-seat side-impact airbags and Audi’s virtual cockpit digital gauge display.\n\nWhat Features in the 2022 Audi A6 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nQuattro all-wheel drive\nPower moonroof\nLeather seating\nHeated front seats\nTri-zone automatic climate control\nAndroid Auto and wireless Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure warning\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nPower trunk lid\nVentilated front seats\nAdaptive cruise control\nBang & Olufsen premium stereo\nHead-up display\nHeated steering wheel\n360-degree camera system\nBlind spot warning\nSport suspension with lowered ride height\nShould I Buy the 2022 Audi A6?\n\nAudi has a great reputation for crafting elegant cabins, and that holds true in the A6. A few too many touch-sensitive controls get in the way, however, and the sedan’s trunk is on the small side. For added cargo room, the A6 Allroad wagon is worth a look.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Audi A6?\n\nThe five-seat Audi A6 is a mid-size luxury sedan that comes standard with a 261-horsepower, mild-hybrid turbo four-cylinder that’s paired with a seven-speed automatic transmission and standard all-wheel drive. A 335-hp, mild-hybrid 3.0-liter V-6 is optional. But wait, there’s more: If you’re a car shopper with a need for speed, the S6 is fitted with a 444-hp, turbocharged 2.9-liter V-6, while the super-performance RS 6 Avant wagon employs a twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8 that delivers a whopping 621 hp. Its acceleration matches just about any sports car. If cargo room and enhanced rough-terrain capability are more important to you than tire-melting acceleration, the SUV-flavored A6 Allroad wagon is a compelling choice. The A6’s rivals include the BMW 5 Series, Cadillac CT5, Genesis G80 and Mercedes-Benz E-Class.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Audi A6?\n\nThe A6 and S6 sedans and the Allroad wagon all get a new grille for 2024, along with standard LED headlights. The S6 also gets an updated rear diffuser. All models now have remote start through the Audi Connect app, along with a six-month trial subscription to Audi Connect Plus remote-access features. \n\nThe RS 6 Avant wagon is now available only in a new Performance trim, wringing an additional 30 hp from its twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8, bringing output to 621 hp. Other changes to the RS 6 include reduced sound-deadening material and new, lighter 22-inch wheels. The added power and weight-loss program result in a quicker 0-60 mph acceleration time of just 3.3 seconds. Cosmetic changes to the RS 6 Performance include new interior trim and unique exterior touches, including mirror caps, roof rails and other trim pieces finished in a choice of standard matte gray or optional matte carbon. \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Audi A6 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nQuattro AWD\nPower moonroof \nLeather seating\n10.1-inch infotainment screen\n12.3-inch Virtual Cockpit instrument display\nHeated front seats\nTri-zone automatic climate control\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto \nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure warning\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nVentilated front seats \nPower soft-close doors\nMassaging front seats\nAdaptive cruise control\nBang & Olufsen premium stereo\nHead-up display\nHeated steering wheel\n360-degree camera system\nBlind spot warning\nSport suspension \nAll-wheel steering\nShould I Buy the 2024 Audi A6?\n\nThe Audi A6 is elegant and understated, but it’s also an all-weather luxury sedan thanks to standard AWD and a buttoned-down suspension. It’s hard not to be tempted by the power offered in the S6 and RS 6 Avant, but they cost much more than the standard A6. The Allroad’s slightly raised suspension and large cargo area make it an esoteric pick in a luxury field brimming with SUVs. The dual-screen dashboard design looks fresh and modern, though a lack of physical controls can make it a distraction.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Audi A6?\n\nThe five-seat A6 is a mid-size luxury sedan that comes standard with a 261-horsepower, mild-hybrid turbocharged four-cylinder paired with a seven-speed automatic transmission and standard all-wheel drive. A 335-hp, mild-hybrid 3.0-liter V-6 is optional. If you’re a car shopper with a need for speed, the S6 is fitted with a 444-hp, turbo 2.9-liter V-6, while the performance RS 6 Avant wagon employs a twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8 that delivers a whopping 591 hp. If cargo room and enhanced rough-terrain capability are more important to you than tire-melting acceleration, the SUV-flavored A6 Allroad wagon is a compelling choice. The A6’s rivals include the BMW 5 Series, Cadillac CT5, Genesis G80 and Mercedes-Benz E-Class.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Audi A6?\n\nA black faux-suede headliner is now optional on select models, and adaptive cruise control with lane guidance is newly included with the optional Convenience Package. The S6 gets a new base Premium trim level and some revamped option packages.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Audi A6 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nQuattro all-wheel drive\nPower moonroof \nLeather seating\n10.1-inch infotainment screen\n12.3-inch Virtual Cockpit instrument display\nHeated front seats\nTri-zone automatic climate control\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto \nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure warning\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nVentilated front seats \nPower soft-close doors\nMassaging front seats\nAdaptive cruise control\nBang & Olufsen premium stereo\nHead-up display\nHeated steering wheel\n360-degree camera system\nBlind spot warning\nSport suspension \nAll-wheel steering\nShould I Buy the 2023 Audi A6?\n\nThe A6 is elegant and understated, but it’s also an all-weather luxury sedan thanks to standard all-wheel drive and a buttoned-down suspension. It’s hard not to be tempted by the power offered in the S6 and RS 6 Avant, but they cost much more than the standard A6. The Allroad’s slightly raised suspension and large cargo area make it an esoteric pick in a luxury field brimming with SUVs. The dual-screen dashboard design looks fresh and modern, though the lack of physical controls can make it a distraction.",
