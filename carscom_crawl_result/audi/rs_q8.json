      "expert_review": "Key points:\n\nFor the 2026 model year, the Audi Q8 SUV starts at $76,895 (all prices include $1,295 destination fee).\nThe Premium Plus and Prestige trims get more standard features for 2026.\nThe SQ8 and RS Q8 performance models carry over unchanged.\n\nFor 2026, the Audi Q8 luxury SUV rolls into the new model year with more standard features and available option packages on certain trims, while the 500-horsepower SQ8 and 631-hp RS Q8 carry over unchanged. For 2026, the Q8 starts at $76,895.\n\nRelated: 2025 Audi RS Q8 Performance: Brand’s Most Powerful Combustion Engine Starts at $137,495\n\nWhat’s New?\n\nAfter a refresh for 2024, the 2026 Q8 SUV arrives with more standard features on the mid-grade Premium Plus and top Prestige trims. The five-seat variant of the three-row Audi Q7, the Q8 represents a sportier take on the luxury SUV, especially with the SQ8 and top RS Q8 Performance variant that was updated for 2025.\n\nThe Q8’s base Premium trim can be had with a Convenience Plus Package that blackens certain exterior trim bits and adds more luxurious interior features, such as a heated steering wheel and Bang & Olufsen sound system. The Premium Plus trim now gets dual-pane acoustic glass on the side windows for a more hushed ride, ventilated front seats, heated rear seats and other soft touches. (The SQ8 starts with the Premium Plus trim.)\n\nFor 2026, the range-topping Prestige adds rear-axle steering for more nimble handling at speed and for easier parking at low speeds. A Sport Plus Package takes a half-step to the SQ8 with an adaptive air suspension, red brake calipers, 23-inch wheels wrapped in summer tires and massaging front seats. (The RS Q8 only comes in the top Prestige trim and includes the goodies in the Sport Plus Package.)\n\nPricing and Release Date\n\nThe 2026 Audi Q8 family is on sale now. Full line pricing is as follows.\n\nQ8\nPremium: $76,895\nPremium Plus: $82,095\nPrestige: $87,495\nSQ8\nPremium Plus: $100,995\nPrestige: $108,495\nRS Q8\nPrestige: $139,595\nPowertrain Specs and MPG\n\nThe turbocharged V-6 and twin-turbocharged V-8 engines carry over in the 2026 Q8 family. The Q8’s turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 makes 335 hp and 369 pounds-feet of torque. The SQ8 has a 500-hp, twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 churning out 568 pounds-feet, shaving the 0-60 mph time from 5.5 to 4.0 seconds. Then there’s the RS Q8 with the altered V-8 tuned to 631 hp and 627 pounds-feet; it hits 60 mph in just 3.4 seconds. All three models send power through an eight-speed automatic transmission to Audi’s signature Quattro all-wheel drive.\n\nOfficial EPA ratings for the 2026 Q8 lineup are not yet available, but Audi says the SUV gets the same EPA estimates as the 2025 model. The EPA rates the 2025 Q8 at 17/23/19 mpg city/highway/combined, while the SQ8 returns 15/21/17 mpg. The RS Q8’s trade-off is a slash rating of 14/20/16 mpg.\n\nRead More About the Audi Q8 on Cars.com:\n\nMax Power: 2025 Audi RS Q8 Performance Packs Brand’s Most Powerful Gas Engine Ever\nWhich SUVs Can Tow at Least 5,000 Pounds?\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2021 Audi SQ8?\nAutomakers Respond Quickly to New IIHS Front Crash-Prevention Test\nResearch the Audi Q8\nSafety Features\n\nAudi equips the 2026 Q8 with a comprehensive suite of advanced safety systems.

      "expert_review": "Competes with: BMW X6 M, Lamborghini Urus, Mercedes-AMG GLE53\n\nLooks like: The most badass SUV in your school’s drop-off lane\n\nPowertrain: A twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8 engine that makes 591 horsepower and 590 pounds-feet of torque; all-wheel drive; eight-speed automatic transmission\n\nHits dealerships: 2020\n\nFor years, Audi’s given plenty of coupes and sedans the RS treatment — amping the models with go-fast looks and the goods to back them up. Now for something a little different: At the 2019 Los Angeles Auto Show, the automaker just unveiled an RS version of its new-for-2019 Q8 SUV — the first time Audi has given an SUV the RS treatment in the U.S.\n\nRelated: More 2019 L.A. Auto Show Coverage\n\nExterior\n\nWith its sleek profile and fastback roofline, the Q8 has already earned a lot of style points, but the RS version builds on its already athletic design with extras like an RS-specific octagonal grille, gloss-black front air inlets and matte-aluminum exterior trim pieces. In back, it wears an RS roof-edge spoiler, which Audi says is not just cosmetic; it also provides downforce on the rear axle for improved balance at high speeds.\n\nInterior\n\nInside, the five-seat SUV is dressed in black with red accents and wears plenty of badges. It has RS-specific seats and features extra RS displays in the Audi Virtual Cockpit and MMI screens that display information like output, G-forces, lap times, temperature, torque and tire pressure. A head-up display is optional and features several RS-specific graphics.\n\nEngine and Transmission\n\nPower comes from a twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8 engine that makes 591 horsepower and 590 pounds-feet of torque, up from the regular model’s turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6. It pairs with an eight-speed automatic transmission; all-wheel drive is standard, and Audi’s Quattro sport rear differential can distribute torque between the rear wheels as required to enhance traction and improve handling.\n\nThe automaker says the RS Q8 sprints from 0-62 mph in 3.8 seconds on its way to a top speed of 155.3 mph. It’s the fastest production SUV to lap the Nurburgring racetrack, Audi claims, with an official time of 7 minutes, 42.2 seconds.\n\nDrivers can customize the ride in many ways. An adaptive air suspension and RS-specific damper tuning can alter ride height and comfort levels, and the standard Audi Drive Select system allows drivers to choose between seven different drive mode settings, including  Comfort, Auto, Dynamic, Allroad, Offroad and the individually configurable RS-specific modes, RS1 and RS2, which can be activated directly via the “‘RS-Mode” button on the steering wheel.\n\nThe 2019 Los Angeles Auto Show opens its doors to the public from Nov. 22 through Dec. 1.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

Stepping up to an SQ8 or RS Q8 brings a twin-turbo V-8 engine that produces 500 or 591 hp, respectively. This gives the Q8 the performance of an outright sports car — not to mention the price of one, too. An RS Q8 starts at approximately $127,000, which is about $54,000 more than an entry-level Q8.\n\nAccording to Cars.com’s own cargo measurements, the SQ8 offers 20.2 cubic feet of cargo space behind its backseat. If you plan on toting children with any regularity, you can check how the Q8 scored in our Car Seat Check. Competitors include the Land Rover Range Rover Velar, Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class, Porsche Cayenne and Maserati Levante.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Audi Q8?\n\nThe 2023 Audi Q8 is largely the same as the previous model year. Updates include some new standard features and trim shuffling. Headlight washers, upgraded LED headlights and animated exterior lighting when approaching or departing the vehicle are newly standard. The Convenience Package adds adaptive cruise control with lane departure steering assist; remote park assist is included on the range-topping Prestige trim; and three new exterior colors have been added to the Q8’s palette.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Audi Q8 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nAll-wheel drive\n10.1-inch infotainment screen\n8.6-inch climate control screen\nVirtual Cockpit digital gauge cluster\nPanoramic moonroof\nLeather-trimmed seats\nHeated front seats\nTri-zone automatic climate control\nNavigation\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nAdaptive suspension\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nFour-zone climate control\nHeated steering wheel\nHeated rear seats\nVentilated front seats\nBang & Olufsen premium stereo\nHead-up display\n360-degree camera system\nWireless device charging\nNight vision\nAdaptive air suspension\nFour-wheel steering\nShould I Buy the 2023 Audi Q8?\n\nThe Audi Q8 is a luxury SUV that wants to be a sports car, and it succeeds in terms of its aggressive shape and hunkered-down stance.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Audi Q8?\n\nThe Audi Q8 is a mid-size luxury SUV with two rows of seats and a design that emphasizes speed and sportiness. A 335-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 engine is standard and teams with an eight-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive. Stepping up to the SQ8 or RS Q8 brings a twin-turbo V-8 engine that produces 500 and 631 hp, respectively. This gives the Q8 the performance of an outright sports car — not to mention the price of one, too. An RS Q8 starts at approximately $137,000, which is about $62,000 more than an entry-level Q8. The Q8 family’s competitors include the Land Rover Range Rover Velar, Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class, Porsche Cayenne and Maserati Levante.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Audi Q8?\n\nChanges to the Q8 and SQ8 for 2025 are minimal, comprising new option packages and additional standard equipment. Meanwhile, the RS Q8 gets a styling refresh similar to the face-lift its siblings received last year, and it now comes solely as a Performance variant with 631 hp (40 more than last year’s RS Q8) and other high-performance touches.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Audi Q8 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nAWD\n10.1-inch infotainment screen\n8.6-inch climate-control screen\nVirtual cockpit digital gauge cluster\nPanoramic moonroof\nLeather-trimmed seats\nHeated front seats\nTri-zone automatic climate control\nNavigation\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nAdaptive suspension\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nFour-zone climate control\nHeated steering wheel\nHeated rear seats\nVentilated front seats\nBang & Olufsen premium stereo system\nHead-up display\n360-degree camera system\nWireless device charging\nNight vision\nAdaptive air suspension\nFour-wheel steering\nShould I Buy the 2025 Audi Q8?\n\nThe Q8 is a luxury SUV that wants to be a sports car, and it succeeds in terms of its aggressive shape and hunkered-down stance. The twin-turbo V-8 engines used in the SQ8 and RS Q8 provide scintillating performance, but their price tags might make you wince. Impeccable cabin quality and two rows of spacious seating add a dollop of practicality. That said, Audi’s own Q7 SUV is not only less expensive, it also has three rows of seats and more cargo space.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2022 Audi Q8?\n\nThe five-seat Audi Q8 blends sleek and aggressive styling with SUV size and versatility. The Q8 comes with a 335-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 engine that works with an eight-speed automatic transmission. All-wheel drive is standard. Performance SQ8 and RS Q8 versions are also offered, featuring turbocharged V-8 engines that make 500 and 591 hp, respectively.\n\nCompetitors include the BMW X6, Land Rover Range Rover Velar and Maserati Levante. The SQ8 offers 20.2 cubic feet of cargo space behind its backseat, according to Cars.com’s cargo measurements. You can see how it scored in our Car Seat Check here.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2022 Audi Q8?\n\nNew standard features include 21-inch wheels, power-folding heated side mirrors, and rear-seat side-impact airbags. New standard features for the SQ8, meanwhile, include adaptive cruise control and lane assist.\n\nWhat Features in the 2022 Audi Q8 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nPower liftgate\nPanoramic moonroof\nLeather-trimmed seats\nHeated front seats\nTri-zone automatic air conditioning\nDigital instrument panel\nDual-touchscreen control system\nNavigation\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nAdaptive suspension\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nFour-zone automatic air conditioning\nHeated steering wheel\nHeated rear seats\nVentilated front seats\nBang & Olufsen premium stereo\nHead-up display\n360-degree camera system\nWireless device charging\nNight vision system\nAdaptive air suspension\nFour-wheel steering\nShould I Buy the 2022 Audi Q8?\n\nThere’s no doubt the Q8 puts style ahead of practicality, with sleek looks and a tapered tail. To its credit, it still has a large backseat, and its cabin quality is impressive. Ride quality and outward visibility are also highlights, but acceleration lag is a problem, and the drivetrain’s stop-start system isn’t great.",
