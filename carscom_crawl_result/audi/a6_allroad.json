      "expert_review": "Audi is giving beleaguered U.S. wagon fans (I’m one) another reason to smile, confirming that the A6 Allroad wagon, a ruggedized version of its A6 Avant wagon sold in Europe, is coming to America for 2020.\nRelated: Hey, Cool Dad! The Audi RS6 Avant Wagon Is Coming Stateside\n\n  \n    \n  \n    While the wagon is not sold here in its basic form, Audi also already has confirmed that the 2020 RS6 Avant performance model with a nearly 600-horsepower V-8 will be sold here. The wagons are based on the new-generation A6 sedan that got a stylish and tech-loaded redesign for 2019 — and they wear the new look well.\nBut while the RS6 is a go-fast wagon that will rival the Mercedes-AMG E63 S Wagon and Porsche Panamera Turbo Sport Turismo, the Allroad is a more practical mix — part luxury car, part sports sedan, part SUV. It will compete against Volvo’s V90 Cross Country as well as possibly the high end of Audi’s own A4 Allroad, and the Volvo V60 Cross Country and Subaru Outback lines. All are wagons with more SUV-like cladding, all-wheel drive with some light-off-roading tech and more ground clearance, but still with carlike manners and driving dynamics.\nAnd 2020 revives the original A6 Allroad that came to the U.S. in 2000 and was sold through 2005, developing a small but loyal following.\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n\n\n  \n    2001 Audi A6 Allroad | Manufacturer image\n  \n\n  \n    Low and Sporty or Riding High \nThe 2020 Allroad will be offered in high-end form at launch with a lot of standard equipment. Power will be from Audi’s turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 putting out 335 hp and 369 pounds-feet of torque with mild-hybrid technology for better mileage. It is mated to a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic. All-wheel drive and an adaptive air suspension system are standard.\nThe air suspension can vary ride height from 4.9 inches up to 7.3 inches (nearly 2 inches higher than the sedan). Height varies among six drive modes: Auto (the most balanced) and Comfort (lighter steering and throttle) both dial in a 5.5-inch clearance. Dynamic tightens up the steering, throttle and transmission, and lowers the wagon 0.6 inches. Offroad adds 1.2 inches of clearance and Lift adds 0.6 more, both only at up to 21.7 mph. There also is an Individual setting that lets you mix and match.\nAlso standard are hill descent control, tilt angle assist and all-wheel steering, and extra configurable instrument screens that show longitudinal and transverse tilt angles.\nMildly Ruggedized Design\nThe vertical slats of the Allroad’s grille set it apart from the blacked-out RS6 grille and the horizontal slats of the A6 sedan. The Allroad gets wheel arches, lower body panels and lower bumpers in a contrasting matte gray (though you can specify body color if you like). The roof rails, as well as the front and rear bumpers, get aluminum-finish trim, and 20-inch wheels are standard.\nInside, the Allroad gets a well-equipped version of the new A6 interior with the sedan’s multimedia, and safety and driver-assistance tech features, as well as a standard panoramic moonroof, ambient lighting and Bang & Olufsen premium audio.\nAnniversary Edition\nThe A6 Allroad launch will include a special 20th Anniversary Edition with an exclusive Gavial Green paint color option (similar to the original’s Highland Green), a brown leather interior, ash wood trim and stainless-steel pedals.\nThe Allroad’s pricing and on-sale date are still to be announced. The 2019 A4 Allroad starts at $46,695 (all prices include destination). The 2019 A6 sedan starts at $55,095 with the turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder and $59,895 with the 3.0-liter V-6.\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Audi A6?\nThe five-seat A6 is a mid-size luxury sedan that comes standard with a 261-horsepower, mild-hybrid turbocharged four-cylinder paired with a seven-speed automatic transmission and standard all-wheel drive. A 335-hp, mild-hybrid 3.0-liter V-6 is optional. If you’re a car shopper with a need for speed, the S6 is fitted with a 444-hp, turbo 2.9-liter V-6, while the performance RS 6 Avant wagon employs a twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8 that delivers a whopping 591 hp. If cargo room and enhanced rough-terrain capability are more important to you than tire-melting acceleration, the SUV-flavored A6 Allroad wagon is a compelling choice. The A6’s rivals include the BMW 5 Series, Cadillac CT5, Genesis G80 and Mercedes-Benz E-Class.\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Audi A6?\nA black faux-suede headliner is now optional on select models, and adaptive cruise control with lane guidance is newly included with the optional Convenience Package. The S6 gets a new base Premium trim level and some revamped option packages.\nWhat Features in the 2023 Audi A6 Are Most Important?\nStandard features include:\n\nQuattro all-wheel drive\nPower moonroof \nLeather seating\n10.1-inch infotainment screen\n12.3-inch Virtual Cockpit instrument display\nHeated front seats\nTri-zone automatic climate control\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto \nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure warning\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nVentilated front seats \nPower soft-close doors\nMassaging front seats\nAdaptive cruise control\nBang & Olufsen premium stereo\nHead-up display\nHeated steering wheel\n360-degree camera system\nBlind spot warning\nSport suspension \nAll-wheel steering\n\nShould I Buy the 2023 Audi A6?\nThe A6 is elegant and understated, but it’s also an all-weather luxury sedan thanks to standard all-wheel drive and a buttoned-down suspension. It’s hard not to be tempted by the power offered in the S6 and RS 6 Avant, but they cost much more than the standard A6. The Allroad’s slightly raised suspension and large cargo area make it an esoteric pick in a luxury field brimming with SUVs. The dual-screen dashboard design looks fresh and modern, though the lack of physical controls can make it a distraction.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2021 Audi A6?\nThe Audi A6 is a mid-size luxury sedan that bridges the gap between the German automaker’s smaller A4 sedan and the full-size A8 sedan. Engines range from mild to wild, with the S6’s 444-horsepower, twin-turbocharged 2.9-liter V-6 falling into the latter category. \nBase sedans are powered by a 248-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that works with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. A 335-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 is available, and this engine also powers the Allroad wagon. All-wheel drive is standard. Competitors include the BMW 5 Series and Mercedes-Benz E-Class. \nWhat’s New on the 2021 Audi A6?\nThe A6 was redesigned for the 2019 model year; changes for 2021 consist of the reshuffling of some features within option packages. \nWhat Features in the 2021 Audi A6 Are Most Important?\nStandard features include:\n\nDual center touchscreens\nLeather seating surfaces\nPower moonroof \nHeated front seats\nTri-zone automatic climate control\nApple CarPlay, Android Auto smartphone connectivity\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nLane-keeping assist\nAdaptive cruise control\nBang & Olufsen premium stereo\nHead-up display\nHeated steering wheel\n360-degree camera system\nSport suspension\n\n\nShould I Buy the 2021 Audi A6?\nWith a choice of body styles and powertrains, there’s probably an A6 that will meet your luxury car needs. Interior quality is a familiar Audi highlight, but we’re less impressed by the A6’s adoption of many touch-sensitive controls. The sedan’s trunk is also on the small side.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Audi A6?\nThe five-seat Audi A6 is a mid-size luxury sedan that comes standard with a 261-horsepower, mild-hybrid turbo four-cylinder that’s paired with a seven-speed automatic transmission and standard all-wheel drive. A 335-hp, mild-hybrid 3.0-liter V-6 is optional. But wait, there’s more: If you’re a car shopper with a need for speed, the S6 is fitted with a 444-hp, turbocharged 2.9-liter V-6, while the super-performance RS 6 Avant wagon employs a twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8 that delivers a whopping 621 hp. Its acceleration matches just about any sports car. If cargo room and enhanced rough-terrain capability are more important to you than tire-melting acceleration, the SUV-flavored A6 Allroad wagon is a compelling choice. The A6’s rivals include the BMW 5 Series, Cadillac CT5, Genesis G80 and Mercedes-Benz E-Class.\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Audi A6?\nThe A6 and S6 sedans and the Allroad wagon all get a new grille for 2024, along with standard LED headlights. The S6 also gets an updated rear diffuser. All models now have remote start through the Audi Connect app, along with a six-month trial subscription to Audi Connect Plus remote-access features. \nThe RS 6 Avant wagon is now available only in a new Performance trim, wringing an additional 30 hp from its twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8, bringing output to 621 hp. Other changes to the RS 6 include reduced sound-deadening material and new, lighter 22-inch wheels. The added power and weight-loss program result in a quicker 0-60 mph acceleration time of just 3.3 seconds. Cosmetic changes to the RS 6 Performance include new interior trim and unique exterior touches, including mirror caps, roof rails and other trim pieces finished in a choice of standard matte gray or optional matte carbon. \nWhat Features in the 2024 Audi A6 Are Most Important?\nStandard features include:\n\nQuattro AWD\nPower moonroof \nLeather seating\n10.1-inch infotainment screen\n12.3-inch Virtual Cockpit instrument display\nHeated front seats\nTri-zone automatic climate control\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto \nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure warning\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nVentilated front seats \nPower soft-close doors\nMassaging front seats\nAdaptive cruise control\nBang & Olufsen premium stereo\nHead-up display\nHeated steering wheel\n360-degree camera system\nBlind spot warning\nSport suspension \nAll-wheel steering\n\nShould I Buy the 2024 Audi A6?\nThe Audi A6 is elegant and understated, but it’s also an all-weather luxury sedan thanks to standard AWD and a buttoned-down suspension. It’s hard not to be tempted by the power offered in the S6 and RS 6 Avant, but they cost much more than the standard A6. The Allroad’s slightly raised suspension and large cargo area make it an esoteric pick in a luxury field brimming with SUVs. The dual-screen dashboard design looks fresh and modern, though a lack of physical controls can make it a distraction.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Audi A6?\nThe five-seat Audi A6 is a mid-size luxury sedan that comes standard with a 261-horsepower, mild-hybrid turbo four-cylinder that’s paired with a seven-speed automatic transmission and standard all-wheel drive. A 335-hp, mild-hybrid 3.0-liter V-6 is optional. If you’re a car shopper with a need for speed, the S6 is fitted with a 444-hp, turbocharged 2.9-liter V-6, while the super-performance RS 6 Avant wagon employs a twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8 that delivers a whopping 621 hp. Its acceleration matches just about any sports car. If cargo room and enhanced rough-terrain capability are more important to you than tire-melting acceleration, the SUV-flavored A6 Allroad wagon is a compelling choice. The A6’s rivals include the BMW 5 Series, Cadillac CT5, Genesis G80 and Mercedes-Benz E-Class.\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Audi A6?\nAfter a refresh last year, the A6 family sees little change for 2025. The A6 and S6 sedans and the Allroad wagon get additional standard equipment, along with a shuffling of trim packages. The S6 is now available with a Nardo Sport Edition trim package, and the RS 6 Avant gets a limited-production, specially trimmed GT version.\nWhat Features in the 2025 Audi A6 Are Most Important?\nStandard features include:\n\nQuattro AWD\nPower moonroof\nLeather seating\n10.1-inch infotainment screen\n12.3-inch Virtual Cockpit instrument display\nHeated front seats\nTri-zone automatic climate control\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure warning\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nVentilated front seats\nPower soft-close doors\nMassaging front seats\nAdaptive cruise control\nBang & Olufsen premium stereo\nHead-up display\nHeated steering wheel\n360-degree camera system\nBlind spot warning\nSport suspension\nAll-wheel steering\n\nShould I Buy the 2025 Audi A6?\nThe Audi A6 is elegant and understated, but it’s also an all-weather luxury sedan thanks to standard AWD and a buttoned-down suspension. It’s hard not to be tempted by the power offered in the S6 and RS 6 Avant, but they cost much more than the standard A6. The Allroad wagon’s slightly raised suspension and large cargo area make it an esoteric pick in a luxury field brimming with SUVs. The A6’s dual-screen dashboard design looks fresh and modern, but its lack of physical controls can make it a distraction.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2022 Audi A6?\nThe five-seat Audi A6 is a mid-size luxury sedan that bridges the gap between the smaller A4 and full-size A8. Engines range from mild to wild, with the S6’s 444-horsepower, turbocharged 2.9-liter V-6 falling into the latter category. Even crazier is the turbo V-8 offered in the RS 6 Avant, a tire-melting wagon with 591 hp. Both of these engines pair with an eight-speed automatic transmission.\nBase sedans are powered by a 261-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that works with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic. A 335-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 is also available, and this engine also powers the Allroad wagon. All-wheel drive is standard. Competitors include the BMW 5 Series, Genesis G80 and Mercedes-Benz E-Class.\nWhat’s New on the 2022 Audi A6?\nNew standard features include a 10.1-inch navigation screen, rear-seat side-impact airbags and Audi’s virtual cockpit digital gauge display.\nWhat Features in the 2022 Audi A6 Are Most Important?\nStandard features include:\n\nQuattro all-wheel drive\nPower moonroof\nLeather seating\nHeated front seats\nTri-zone automatic climate control\nAndroid Auto and wireless Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure warning\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nPower trunk lid\nVentilated front seats\nAdaptive cruise control\nBang & Olufsen premium stereo\nHead-up display\nHeated steering wheel\n360-degree camera system\nBlind spot warning\nSport suspension with lowered ride height\n\nShould I Buy the 2022 Audi A6?\nAudi has a great reputation for crafting elegant cabins, and that holds true in the A6. A few too many touch-sensitive controls get in the way, however, and the sedan’s trunk is on the small side. For added cargo room, the A6 Allroad wagon is worth a look.",
