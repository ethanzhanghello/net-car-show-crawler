      "expert_review": "Audi is an auto manufacturer that, just eight years ago, was on the ropes. From peak North American sales of 72,000 in 1985, its share of that market had fallen to just 12,000 in 1993. Quality problems and reports of dangerous and unpredictable accelerations will do that to a car company.\n\nAs Len Hunt, head of Audi North America, recently said of his company’s earlier misfortunes, standing before a crushed bell curve graph depicting the peak and nadir (and subsequent rise again) of Audi sales, officials were left wondering, “Who dropped the anvil on our sales history?”\n\nBut Audi is back, with a revamped lineup of 4s, 6s, 8s, the TT Quattro, and its SUV/station wagon, the allroad. Sales through June of this year were 43,300 and the company expects to approach 90,000 by year’s end. Reestablishing its reputation for quality, emphasizing performance, designing some of the sharpest interiors and building the best all-wheel-drive system in the world will do that to a car company.\n\nThe A4s and A6s have led the rebirth; the TT has inspired it; the allroad broadened the offerings; and the A8 flagship – well, it hasn’t been the best of sellers. To start with, it’s expensive and, competing in the larger luxury sedan class with BMW, Jaguar, Lexus, Infiniti, and Mercedes, it just didn’t have the pizzazz to attract more than a couple of thousand buyers each year.\n\nNow, however, comes the S8, and while it won’t sell anywhere near the numbers of the lesser digit Audis, it puts Audi on a level playing field with the performance luxury sedan manufacturers.\n\nYes, it’s expensive – around $80,000. No, it does not make any bold fashion statement. Only the cognoscenti will know what the “S” badge means, or notice the lowered stance and broad, nose-down look of the car from the front. And in terms of automotive physics, S does not necessarily equal AMG or M or even XJR. But Audi, with its combination of fine interior, wonderful ride, and plenty of power has found the right formula to run with the BMW M5, the Jaguar XJR, and the Mercedes E55 AMG (my favorite performance sedan).\n\nI’m not saying you’ll beat any of them in a race, but who races big luxury sedans? What you will find in the S8 is a smooth, comfortable, elegant automobile in which you could cross America with style, speed, and ease.\n\nThe trick was turned with subtlety – if you consider a revised intake manifold and cams coupled with a more free-flowing exhaust subtle. Audi has taken the aluminum-block-and-head V-8 engine and managed to squeeze 360 horsepower and 317 lb.-ft. of torque from it. At those numbers, performance comparisons against the other big sedans become stats for only the most picayune of speed enthusiasts. This rig will get you where you want to go plenty quickly.\n\nIt’s a big sedan that gets up to 60 miles per hour in less than 7 seconds. It boosts a power surge that starts early and seems to climb forever as the five-speed automatic lets the car run right up close to the 7,000 rpm redline before each upshift. That’s one bold automatic.\n\nI fault the transmission, however, on downshifts. Here, when you seek a quick downshift through a couple of gears, it seems to linger at the higher cruise as if it doubts your intentions. Even using the Tiptronic buttons on the steering wheel for a manual downshift doesn’t improve that sense of lingering doubt. But, again, not many folks are going to need quick downshifts as they head an S8 into a hairpin turn at high speed. And anyway, it is definitely a sport sedan with which you can do some serious playing. Try the twisting climb and descent between Brattleboro, Vt., and Bennington, Vt. on Route 9. The drivers of smaller, seemingly quicker cars are left wondering what just blew by them. And it’s all done to the accompaniment of an exhaust tone that sounds part European performance car and part American muscle.\n\nThe ride is smooth and supple straight ahead and wonderfully stiff in lane anges and sharp corners. I’ve driven the E55 on highways and country lanes, and the XJR on the tracks at Pocono Speedway in Pennsylvania. The Audi is stiffer than either, holding flat in corners, yet that stiffness does not transmit into sharp shudders on bumps or other road imperfections.\n\nIts suspension has been tuned from A8 standards with heftier antiroll bars and stiffer springs and shocks. It has individual suspension front and rear with links, coil springs, and antiroll bar up front and, in the rear, unequal length control arms, coil springs, and antiroll bar.\n\nAnd don’t forget, it’s an all-wheel-drive car, making it more useful for those who want performance and luxury but who also need to get around in New England in the winter.\n\nInside, Audi manages to pull off understated luxury with leather and “suede” seats that are broad and firmly bolstered, birds-eye maple appointments, and a sophisticated control panel for audio and climate slanting back and down from center dash. Heated seats all around, a power rear window shade, and side window shades are options that thicken the sense of entitlement.\n\nIt is not as fast or as powerful as some of its competitors, but if somebody told me tomorrow that I had to drive a big sedan on a quick cross-country haul, this is the car I’d choose.",

Its beautifully crafted cabin is tremendously comfortable and packed with all of the tech and sumptuousness one would expect at this price, and the S8 performance derivative boasts the sort of power that was reserved for elite sports cars not so long ago.\n\nFor 2026, there are no major changes to the A8 or S8. A new Executive Plus option package is available for both, combining the previously available Luxury and Executive bundles into one massive upgrade that includes heated, ventilated and massaging outboard rear seats, as well as additional safety tech such as automated parking and a head-up display.\n\nRelated: 2025 Audi A8: Updated Design, Expanded Tech and New Trim Options\n\nAvailability and Pricing\n\nThe 2026 Audi A8 and S8 are on sale now. Full pricing is as follows:\n\nA8: $96,395\nS8: $131,295\nWhat Are the 2026 Audi A8’s Trim Levels?\n\nAs Audi’s flagship sedan, the A8 is only available in a single trim level, and it is loaded. Standard equipment includes an adaptive air suspension with 20-inch wheels, LED headlights and organic light-emitting diode taillights, a panoramic moonroof, a power trunk lid, and keyless entry and start. Inside, the cabin is upholstered in genuine leather and features 22-way front seats with heating and ventilation, a heated steering wheel, four-zone automatic climate control, ambient lighting and rear window shades. In-car tech includes a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, a 10.1-inch touchscreen with navigation and a Bang & Olufsen sound system.\n\nThere’s more than just power to the S8, but most of its changes are aimed at corralling its almost 70% increase in output. It gets a sport-tuned adaptive air suspension, rear-wheel steering, a retuned rear differential, larger front brakes (15.8 inches versus the A8’s 14.8) and 21-inch wheels. Visual tweaks include Audi’s HD Matrix-design LED headlights, upgraded interior trim and metal pedals.\n\nStandard and Available Safety Features\n\nStandard safety tech on the 2026 A8 includes forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning, a 360-degree camera system and automatic high beams. The S8 includes no additional safety tech, but the Executive Plus Package available for both adds automated parking, blind spot monitors, lane-centering assist, adaptive cruise control and a head-up display. Night vision is available as a stand-alone option.\n\nWhat Are the 2026 Audi A8’s Powertrain Specs and MPG?\n\nThe A8 is powered by a turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 engine making 335 hp and 369 pounds-feet of torque. The S8 gets a twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 with 563 hp and 590 pounds-feet. Both are backed by an eight-speed automatic transmission and standard all-wheel drive. Audi says the A8 can accelerate from 0-60 mph in 5.6 seconds, and the S8 needs just 3.8 seconds. The A8 returns an EPA-rated 19/27/22 mpg city/highway/combined, while the S8 is rated at 15/24/18 mpg.\n\nRead More About the Audi A8 and S8:\n\nBlack Is Back: 2024 Audi A8, S8 Get Exterior Color Swap, Start at $89,995\n2023 Audi A8, S8 Tweak Tech, Interior Offerings\nResearch the Audi A8\nResearch the Audi S8\nRead More Audi News\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Audi A8?\n\nThe A8 is Audi’s largest, most luxurious and most expensive sedan. Sitting above the mid-size A6, the A8 competes with the BMW 7 Series, Mercedes-Benz S-Class and Genesis G90. The A8’s cabin offers abundant space in both rows, with indulgent options like massaging seats, reclining rear seats, and heated front and rear armrests. Getting the A8 down the road is a 335-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 engine coupled with an eight-speed automatic transmission. Audi’s Quattro all-wheel drive is standard. For added performance, the S8 comes with a 563-hp, twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8 that Audi says takes this plus-sized luxury machine from 0-60 mph in less than 4 seconds.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Audi A8?\n\nThe Audi A8 sees some minor updates for 2025, including newly standard 20-inch wheels and a heated steering wheel. The Luxury Package adds all-wheel steering and a leather-covered dashboard and door panels, while the Executive Package includes HD Matrix LED headlights, Valcona leather, heated rear seats and a head-up display.\n\nThe S8 gains the Extended Leather Package and 21-inch platinum-gray wheels as standard equipment, and the Luxury Package now features massaging rear seats, Matrix LED rear reading lights and a rear-seat remote. Additionally, the Black Optic Plus Package adds 21-inch black wheels, and the Executive Package now includes a head-up display and heated and powered rear outboard seats.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Audi A8 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nDual-screen infotainment system\n12.3-inch Virtual Cockpit digital gauge cluster\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nAdaptive air suspension\nPanoramic moonroof\nLeather upholstery\nWireless device charging\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nFour-zone automatic climate control\nPower rear sunshades\nBang & Olufsen stereo\nHeated steering wheel\n\n Available features include:\n\nMassaging front seats\nMassaging, power-adjustable rear seats\nHeated and ventilated rear seats\nHead-up display\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nFour-wheel steering\nShould I Buy the 2025 Audi A8?\n\nThe Audi A8 gets you down the road in sublime comfort and silence. Its conservative approach to a full-size luxury sedan lacks some of the razzle-dazzle design and features found in rivals like the expansive 56-inch Hyperscreen display available in the Mercedes S-Class. Yet the A8 has more than enough power and prestige to satisfy the vast majority of shoppers who can afford a top-of-the-line Audi sedan. The A8’s cabin tech has a learning curve, but it’s highly customizable and has quick response times. Trunk space is just OK for a vehicle this size, however, and some safety features — including blind spot warning and rear cross-traffic alert — should be standard equipment but aren’t.",

      "expert_review": "Fully tricked out, the S8 is a wicked sound machine. Go ahead, crank up ‘Radar Love.’\n\nHIGHWAY stripes are 10 feet long and 30 feet apart. That means one stripe every 40 feet. No one really knows how this fundamental increment of civil engineering came to be. Well, I say no one knows – I’m sure somebody knows, but that person works in the historical division of the federal Department of Transportation.\n\nThis is a person to avoid at parties.\n\nThere are some wondrous synchronisms hidden in that white-stripe measure. At 55 mph, for instance, a car is traveling 80.66 feet per second, which means that two white stripes slip by every second. This tempo – 120 “beats” per minute – syncs up almost exactly with what is widely regarded as the best driving song ever, “Radar Love” by Golden Earring. Let us all now pause for a moment to remember the primer-gray Impala with burn marks in the ceiling we drove in high school.\n\nToday, I’m driving Audi’s imperial battle cruiser, the S8 – an aluminum-bodied, laser-welded limousine powered by a direct-injection, 450-horsepower V10 reactor. To call it fully equipped is like calling Jessica Biel fully equipped – the damndest of faint praise. It’s about 9 p.m. and I’m on Interstate 5 heading south toward Orange County. Traffic is light. The Audi’s blue-white xenon headlamps peel back the night. At this speed, the freeway’s reflective white stripes flash by at about 153 beats per minute – you do the math. “Metropolis,” KCRW-FM’s sublime techno-electronica-trance program, is in mid-rave.\n\nAnd here it is, one of those perfect driving moments: The pace of car and the tempo of the music come into register and it seems as if the movie playing in my head has just gotten an awesome new soundtrack. The steady thrudding of the bass comes into phase with the white lines. The car’s harmonics – engine, tires, wind and exhaust – melt into the droning house textures. I experience a kind of automotive synesthesia. The night has a steering wheel. Where does the road end and the music begin?\n\nThis is by far the trippiest, most out-of-body experience I’ve ever had in Orange County.\n\nMy gateway drug? The S8’s optional Bang & Olufsen sound system, a 14-speaker, 1,000-watt, twin-amplified mega-system that floods the cabin with crystalline sound and aural imaging that is, in fact, a little bit hallucinatory. Who knew you could get a whole chamber quartet in the back seat? The B&O system is astonishing in many ways – it is, for instance, astonishingly loud. At max sound levels, the Audi’s sound gear can disorient dolphins in the bay or knock sparrows from their nests. And, as is traditional with B&O, there’s a little bit of theater involved. When you start the car, small cylinder-shaped tweeters rise out of the dashboard. These speakers use something called Acoustic Lens Technology – I can’t really explain it here, but I thought you might savor the name.\n\nIN another way, the B&O system is typical, as more luxury carmakers hook up with companies known for their audiophile home equipment (see accompanying chart). Lexus, for example, has a co-branding arrangement with Mark Levinson (a division of Harman International). The Mark Levinson Reference Sound system in the LS460 is a sonic Howitzer: 450 watts, 19 speakers, 15 channels. Likewise, Acura enlisted Grammy-winning producer-engineer Elliot Scheiner to develop sound systems for the RDX, MDX, TL and RL. These systems combine multi-channel playback with high-definition DVD-Audio. The result is startling, fidelity to make the RCA Victor dog roll over and die.\n\nBut, as far as I can tell, the B&O system in the S8 has the most horsepower (wattage) of any factory-installed audio system. The importance of wattage is hotly debated among audiophiles. It’s generally understood that high-watt amplifiers have lower distortion at lower sound levels. It’s also true that there is a disconnect between wattage (a linear scale) and sound pressure (logarithmic). A 1,000-watt sound system at max volume is not twice as loud as a 500-watt system, all other things being equal. It is, however, loud enough to make your brain exit your ears.\n\nHere are two rules of thumb as you shop for high-end car audio. First, more speakers are better. The more speakers, the more uniform the sound field created in the cabin, the more optimized the signal to any individual speaker, the better the surround-sound spatial imaging and the finer the tuning of the signal to the cabin’s acoustic properties. Second, by the time you reach that stage in life when you can afford a six-figure luxury sport sedan, your hearing is lousy, so don’t fret much about the first rule.\n\nTHE trouble with high-end audio in automobiles, of course, is the source material. FM radio, for example, has frequency response (the range of sounds able to be reproduced) between 50 herz and 15,000 herz, well short of the 20-herz to 20,000-herz range of conventional compact disc recordings. Satellite and high-definition radio are better, but you have to pay monthly for the former and have limited station options with the latter (KCRW, alas, is not yet a high-def station). The high-density digital recording formats – DVD-Audio and Super Audio CD – are expensive and their music catalog limited.\n\nFive years from now, the in-dash six-disc changers that are de rigueur now will be rendered obsolete by a variety of portable media, from iPods to USB flash memory. So, rip your Golden Earring CD while you can.\n\nWhat won’t change is that the quieter the car, the better the sound. The current generation of high-end audio systems spends much of its bandwidth competing with the ambient environment. Despite all the noise abatement built into the S8 – the air suspension, acoustic glazing, girder-stiff aluminum chassis and 100 other details known only to Audi’s oscilloscopes – the cabin still has a minimum 60-decibel sound level. Quiet, yes, but not quiet enough.\n\nThe best sound systems on the road – found in the Acura RL and TL – use active noise cancellation, a technology that produces signals 180 degrees out of phase with the background noise, cutting down aural clutter. Bose, which pioneered the technology, is putting it into its own high-end OEM systems.\n\nThe best thing that could happen to in-car audio is the advent of the practical electric car.\n\nHey, what do you know? I’m in Orange County already. Why did I come? I forget. I guess I’ll have to turn around and drive home. It’s half-past 10 and I’m shifting gear.\n\n—————–dan.neil@latimes.com *\n\n(INFOBOX BELOW)\n\nSuper sounds\n\nA sampling of top-end audio systems:\n\nAcura MDX\n\nSystem: Acura/ELS, 410 watts, eight-channel Dolby Pro Logic II signal processing\n\nSupported audio format: AM/FM/CD-R/RW/CD-Text/\n\nMP3/WMA/DVD (audio and video) with six-disc in-dash changer\n\nExternal device input: yes\n\nSatellite radio: XM\n\nSpeakers: 10\n\nPrice: $3,500 (with technology package)\n\nJaguar XKR Portfolio\n\nSystem: Alpine/Bowers & Wilkins (loudspeakers), 525 watts, eight-channel surround sound\n\nSupported audio format: AM/FM/CD/MP3 compatible, six-disc in-dash player\n\nExternal device input: yes\n\nSatellite radio: Sirius\n\nSpeakers: 8\n\nPrice: $1,875\n\nLexus LS460L\n\nSystem: Mark Levinson Reference Surround, 450 watts, 15-channel surround sound\n\nSupported audio format: AM/FM/CD/MP3/DVD (audio and video)-compatible six-disc in-dash changer.\n\nExternal device input: yes\n\nSatellite radio: XM\n\nSpeakers: 19\n\nPrice: $2,530\n\nLincoln Zephyr\n\nSystem: THX-certified, 600 watts, 12-channel surround sound\n\nSupported audio format: AM/FM/CD/MP3-compatible six-disc in-dash player\n\nExternal device input: no\n\nSatellite radio: no\n\nSpeakers: 14\n\nPrice: $995\n\nLand Rover LR2\n\nSystem: Alpine, 440-watt, 12-channel surround sound\n\nSupported audio format: AM/FM/MP3/WMA-compatible six-disc in-dash changer\n\nExternal device input: yes\n\nSatellite radio: Sirius\n\nSpeakers: 12\n\nPrice: $3,500",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Audi A8?\n\nThe A8 is Audi’s largest, most luxurious and most expensive sedan. Sitting above the mid-size A6, the A8 competes with the BMW 7 Series, Mercedes-Benz S-Class and Genesis G90. The A8’s cabin offers abundant space in both rows, with indulgent options like massaging seats, reclining rear seats, and heated front and rear armrests. Getting the A8 down the road is a 335-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 engine coupled with an eight-speed automatic transmission. Audi’s Quattro all-wheel drive is standard. For added performance, the S8 comes with a 563-hp, twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8 that Audi says takes this plus-sized luxury machine from 0-60 mph in less than 4 seconds.  \n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Audi A8?\n\nThe A8 and S8 get a free six-month trial subscription to Audi Connect Plus with the Audi app store, enabling remote start and providing access to a variety of apps for music, video, navigation, news and more through the center screen. Sebring Black paint replaces Vesuvius Gray.    \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Audi A8 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nDual-screen infotainment system\n12.3-inch Virtual Cockpit digital gauge cluster\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nAdaptive air suspension\nPanoramic moonroof\nLeather upholstery\nWireless device charging\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nFour-zone automatic climate control\nPower rear sunshades\nBang & Olufsen stereo\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nMassaging front seats\nMassaging, power-adjustable rear seats\nHeated and ventilated rear seats\nHeated steering wheel\nHead-up display \nBlind spot warning \nRear cross-traffic alert\nFour-wheel steering\nShould I Buy the 2024 Audi A8?\n\nThe Audi A8 gets you down the road in sublime comfort and quietness. Its conservative approach to a full-size luxury sedan lacks some of the razzle-dazzle design and features found in rivals — like the expansive, 56-inch Hyperscreen display available in the Mercedes S-Class. Yet the A8 has more than enough power and prestige to satisfy the vast majority of car shoppers who can afford a top-of-the-line Audi sedan. Its cabin tech has a learning curve, but it’s highly customizable and has quick response times. Trunk space is just OK for a vehicle this size, however, and safety features like blind spot warning and rear cross-traffic alert should be standard equipment, but they aren’t.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Audi A8?\n\nThe 2023 A8 is Audi’s largest, most luxurious, most expensive sedan. Sitting above the mid-size A6, the A8 competes with the BMW 7 Series, Genesis G90 and Mercedes-Benz S-Class. The A8’s cabin offers abundant space in both rows, with indulgent options like massaging seats, reclining rear seats, and heated front and rear armrests. Getting the A8 down the road is a 335-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 engine coupled with an eight-speed automatic transmission; Audi’s Quattro all-wheel drive is standard. For added performance, the S8 comes with a 563-hp, twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Audi A8?\n\nFresh from a styling update for the 2022 model year, the 2023 version of the A8 has only a few minor changes. The optional Comfort Plus Package now includes HD matrix-design LED headlights, and remote park assist is newly grouped into the available Executive Package.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Audi A8 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nDual-screen infotainment system\n12.3-inch Virtual Cockpit digital gauge cluster\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nAdaptive air suspension\nPanoramic moonroof\nLeather upholstery\nWireless device charging\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nFour-zone automatic climate control\nPower rear sunshades\nBang & Olufsen stereo\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nMassaging front seats\nMassaging, power-adjustable rear seats\nHeated and ventilated rear seats\nHeated steering wheel\nHead-up display \nBlind spot warning \nRear cross-traffic alert\nFour-wheel steering\nShould I Buy the 2023 Audi A8?\n\nThe A8 gets you down the road in sublime comfort and quietness. Its conservative approach to a full-size luxury sedan lacks some of the razzle-dazzle design and features found in rivals, such as the 56-inch Hyperscreen display available in the Mercedes S-Class, yet it has more than enough power and prestige to satisfy the vast majority of car shoppers who can afford a top-of-the-line Audi sedan. The cabin tech has a learning curve, but it’s highly customizable and has quick response times. Trunk space is just OK for a vehicle this size, however, and safety features like blind spot warning and rear cross-traffic alert should be standard equipment, but they aren’t.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nBuilt largely of aluminum, Audis flagship sedan gains a Symphony II stereo with an in-dash six-CD changer for 2002. The Porsche-developed Tiptronic five-speed-automatic transmission adds a Sport mode that can hold each gear longer while accelerating. Manual gear selection can be achieved by using rocker switches on the steering wheel. An improved lateral-skid control system called Electronic Stabilization Program is installed and incorporates Brake Assist. New options include a tire-pressure monitor and a communication system called Audi Telematics by OnStar.\n\nThe full-size sedan comes in two sizes: the regular A8 and the stretched A8 L, which rides a longer wheelbase. Both use a 310-horsepower, 4.2-liter V-8 engine and drive Audis permanently engaged quattro all-wheel-drive system. Side-impact airbags are mounted in all four doors, and curtain-type airbags deploy along the side windows during a side-impact collision.\n\nA high-performance S8 sedan joined the lineup in the spring of 2001 and comes fitted with a 360-hp version of the V-8 power plant.\n\nExterior\nAll Audi sedans bear a family resemblance, but the A8 is the largest model in the lineup. In standard form, the A8 rides a 113.4-inch wheelbase and measures 198.2 inches long  about 6 inches longer than the midsize A6. The A8 L sedan is a little more than 5 inches longer than the regular A8 in both wheelbase and body length, stretching 118.5 and 203.3 inches, respectively. Most of that extra length shows up in the rear doors. Both versions are 79 inches wide and 56.6 inches tall.\n\nMost A8 body and suspension parts, as well as its skeletonlike frame, are made of aluminum. Audi claims that this makes the sedan 300 to 500 pounds lighter, stronger and more fuel efficient than rivals that are built mainly of steel.\n\nInterior\nThe A8 L sedans interior differs mainly in rear legroom, which is nearly 3 inches greater than that in the base model. As a result, backseat passengers in the A8 L luxuriate in limousinelike accommodations. Standard leather upholstery comes in a choice of five colors. Two decorative wood inlay types are available: burled walnut or polished sycamore.\n\nSteering-wheel controls can operate the audio system, Tiptronic automatic transmission and cellular phone. The steering column has power tilt and telescoping features. Power front windows have one-touch up/down operation. A Premium comfort option package includes heated front and rear seats, a heated steering wheel and a power rear sunshade.\n\nUnder the Hood\nGenerating 310 hp, the A8s 4.2-liter V-8 engine works with a Porsche-derived Tiptronic five-speed-automatic transmission and Audis permanently engaged quattro all-wheel-drive system. This transmission permits manually selected gear changes using controls mounted on the steering wheel. Audi claims a 0-to-60-mph acceleration time of 6.7 seconds. A 360-hp version of the 4.2-liter V-8 with higher compression goes into the high-performance S8 sedan.\n\nSafety\nThe A8 leads the league in airbags with a total of eight. Beyond the required front airbags for the driver and front passenger, four door-mounted side-impact airbags protect the occupants of outboard seating positions. Two curtain-type airbags drop from the roof lining and deploy along the side windows in both the front and back during a side collision.\n\nAntilock brakes are standard, and an emergency inside trunk release handle has been installed. An optional Parktronic sonar system detects obstacles to the front and rear of the vehicle while parking it.\n\nDriving Impressions\nThe A8 possesses just about every posh comfort and convenience feature that a reasonable person could want, and it delivers a thoroughly luxurious experience. Though its not a flashy automobile, the A8 is a superlative, subtly sophisticated road car that aims to please its fortunate driver.\n\nPerformance is brisk and assertive, and the ride is close to blissful; the A8s handling is highly adept. Quattro all-wheel-drive handling gives Audis largest model a leg up on its rear-drive rival, the newly redesigned BMW 7 Series, when the pavement becomes slick. This Audi feels lighter than the Mercedes-Benz S-Class and tops the elegant rear-drive Jaguar XJ for surefooted highway behavior.\n\nSpace inside is huge  more so in the long-wheelbase A8 L  and the interior is filled with handsome wood and leather. Passing and merging are accomplished without a worry as the energetic V-8 responds forcefully. Automatic-transmission upshifts are gentle, and downshifts are prompt and positive.\n\nThe A8 is exceptionally easy to drive. Once you get accustomed to the sedans abundant dimensions, the A8 is highly stable on the highway and maintains its composure through quick curves. The suspension reacts to any sort of pavement assault, which minimizes distraction to the cars occupants even when rough spots occur. Engine noise is satisfyingly muted, but road sounds emerge on certain surfaces and noise is not absent.\n\nIn general, the controls are excellent, but some arent located in the most convenient spots. Visibility is good, except for thick B-pillars that limit the view over the drivers left shoulder. Seats are comfortable and supportive, despite rather short bottoms. The A8s trunk is huge and easy to load. All told, the sedan feels solid and tight with terrific panel fit, as if created from a single block of aluminum.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com;\nFrom the cars.com 2002 Buying Guide;\nPosted on 4/15/02",

      "expert_review": "The latest Audi S8 is a fantastic blend of luxury, sportiness and capability, wrapped in an understated body that’s perfect for flying (very, very quickly) under the radar.\n\nThere are a few schools of thought when it comes to big, expensive luxury sedans. Some want ostentatious luxury — styling that wows and announces your arrival before you’ve rolled down a window. Others want subtlety — the ability to navigate traffic without causing a stir, flying under the radar while barreling down a highway at superlegal speeds. The Audi S8 definitely falls into the latter category.\n\nRolling past crowds in Daytona Gray Pearl with titanium-finish matte wheels, the massively powerful sport sedan gets no second looks. Aside from the big wheels, the conservative-looking S8 gives away none of its formidable abilities, but slide behind the wheel, fire up the rumbling, boosted V-8 engine and you’re going to smile — you’re driving one of the world’s best stealth fighters. There have been some minor styling and color updates for the 2015 model year (see the changes from 2014 to 2015 here), but the S8 mostly carries over from its last major update in 2012.\n\nExterior & Styling\nAs has been the case with Audi sedans for a few decades now, if you like the way one looks, you’ll like them all. The proportions, the creases, the look of the headlights, grille and taillights — from the tiny A3 to the big A8L, they all look nearly identical except for their size. Thankfully, the look is still classy, and the bigger each car in the lineup the better the simple lines and arching roofline appear.\n\nNew for 2015 are some updated LED headlights, a slightly revised grille, new taillights and quad oval tailpipes. You have to park a 2015 next to a 2014 to spot any differences, but seeing as how the look is still relatively fresh and attractive, there’s little to complain about. It should be noted that the S8 comes only in the shorter-wheelbase version of the A8; the longer A8L with its extra backseat legroom doesn’t get the sporty S treatment.\n\nHow It Drives\nPerhaps the best aspect of the big S8 is the car’s easy tractability. It’s a big boulevard cruiser when you want it to be, cushy and smooth with highly boosted steering, muted exhaust rumble and a firm yet completely comfortable ride. Push a couple of buttons and switch everything into Dynamic mode, though, and you suddenly have a totally different animal: loud and blisteringly quick, with stronger steering effort required, the S8’s sporty ride in Dynamic mode will knock your kidneys loose over bumps; its throttle sensitivity transforms the S8 into a muscle car. A refined muscle car, to be sure, but the speed at which the car responds and the brutality with which it accelerates make the S8 one of the most fun big sedans in the world.\n\nIt does have company, however: Other big, fast sedans like the Mercedes-Benz S63 AMG and BMW B7 Alpina are worthy challengers. If you like your luxury British-flavoured, there’s the Jaguar XJR. All three have similar missions: big bucks, lots of luxury, understated looks and massive power. All handle just as well as the S8, featuring their own adjustable suspensions. The biggest difference is perhaps the availability of long-wheelbase versions for the Jaguar and BMW — something you can’t get on the Audi or Mercedes-Benz.\n\nThe S8 is powered by Audi’s twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8, the same motor that can be found under the hood of the Bentley Flying Spur, though in this application it makes 520 horsepower. Unlike the Bentley applications, the response from the Audi V-8 here is instantaneous; there’s no lag between pressing the accelerator and forward motion. The power courses through an eight-speed automatic transmission to all four wheels via Audi’s standard quattro all-wheel-drive system.\n\nWith that much power on tap, you never have to worry about highway passing or impromptu stoplight drag races — what you do have to worry about is all that power and the quiet refinement of the S8’s interior combining to lure you into driving at speeds well in excess of the legal limit without realizing it. Some powerful cars are merely quick; the Audi is both quick and fast, able to cruise at triple-digit speeds all day long without complaint. It’s a pity there’s nowhere in the U.S. to truly (legally) experience what this autobahn-focused luxury cruiser can do, short of a racetrack.\n\nDespite its formidable motor, the S8 is outgunned by all three competitors: The Benz makes 577 hp with its twin-turbo 5.5-liter V-8, while the BMW produces 540 hp with its twin-turbo 4.4-liter V-8 engine. The Jaguar goes a different route with forced induction, pumping 550 hp out of its supercharged 5.0-liter V-8. Its aluminum-intensive construction means it’s also the lightest car in the group by a significant margin — 4,129 pounds versus the S8’s 4,685 pounds. They’re both lighter than the Benz or Bimmer, however, which tip the scales at more than 4,800 pounds each, mitigating any horsepower advantages.\n\nJudicious use of the go pedal does create a little heartburn at the gas pump, but not much. The S8 is rated 17/27/20 mpg city/highway/ combined, and my week of testing — which included about 500 miles of highway driving — earned a 24 mpg result; not bad for such a big and powerful car. The competition is not as good: The S63 AMG is rated 15/23/18 mpg, the all-wheel-drive Alpina B7 comes in at 16/24/19 mpg, while the XJR is rated 15/23/18 mpg. It may not be as powerful as its competitors, but the S8’s smaller motor pays off when it comes to fuel economy.\n\nInterior\nDebuting for 2015 is a new interior color combination that came on my test vehicle: Vermont Brown leather with “carbon twill copper” trim pieces. It’s an interesting combination, with a carbon-fiber weave featuring copper threads to give it a golden hue in direct sunlight. I’m not sold on the combination of brown interiors and dark gray exteriors, but every German luxury automaker seems to think it looks good, as I’ve seen it on countless test cars in the past couple of years.\n\nEverything is screwed together with the quality one expects from Audi — that is to say, flawlessly. Every button clicks with a precision other automakers still haven’t successfully copied, and every knob turns with a heft and weight that makes you think there’s a complicated mechanism at work behind the dash instead of just electronic bits. Nothing is touch-sensitive except an optional pad that can be used for inputting letters and numbers for the multimedia screens, if you want.\n\nThe seats are all-day comfortable, infinitely adjustable and provide plenty of room for four passengers (five is tight). It feels like a proper luxury car, done up in some sportier duds in keeping with the S8’s more athletic mission.\n\nThe competition isn’t too shabby, either; the Mercedes-Benz S63 AMG bests the S8’s onboard electronics and design. If the S8 feels luxurious, the Benz feels downright opulent, with even better materials, design, craftsmanship and trim. The Jaguar XJR is equally opulent, with a style that mixes traditional British wood and leather with modern touches, like a disappearing rotary shifter, while the BMW displays that brand’s rather Spartan aesthetic.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe S8 feels familiar inside, as Audi’s MMI multimedia- and feature-control system has been around for a while now. The familiar configuration of the rotary selector knob surrounded by four buttons (corresponding to the four corners of the screen) is still one of the best systems around. It’s easy to use without having to glance at the console and the buttons you intend to push, making it a simple system to operate while driving. It’s quick and intuitive and connects to mobile entertainment devices, like smartphones, quite easily.\n\nThe multimedia systems found in most of Audi’s competitors offer similar functionality and connectivity, but the Audi maintains an advantage in usability and on-the-fly operation. The S8 and Alpina B7 both offer standard head-up displays; one is available on the S63 but not on the Jaguar. The Audi’s is easy to use and clear even while wearing polarized sunglasses.\n\nCargo & Storage\nDespite being a full-size luxury car, the Audi S8 does not have a spacious trunk. In fact, it’s the smallest of the four competitors listed here, with just 13.2 cubic feet of space. Compare that with 15.2 cubic feet in the Jaguar, 16.3 cubic feet in the Mercedes-Benz and the comparably huge 17.7 cubic feet in the BMW, and you’ll wonder why such a large car has so little room for your stuff. If you want to expand the cargo area by folding down the seats, well, you’re out of luck there, too — of the four competitors, only the Mercedes-Benz offers a split-folding rear seat, and it’s an option.\n\nSafety\nThe S8 has not been crash-tested. Like all cars in this category, safety equipment is plentiful, high-tech and expensive, as not all of it comes standard even at the S8’s lofty prices. It has a blind spot monitor system standard, as does the Jaguar, a feature that’s an option on other vehicles. Like the rest of the pack, most of the S8’s safety equipment comes in extra-cost option packages; my test car had a few, including a Driver Assistance Package, which added adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist and lane departure warning. It lacked Audi’s night vision system, which uses an infrared camera to help the driver see oncoming threats in the dark. The Mercedes-Benz and BMW also offer such systems as options. To see all the S8’s standard safety features, click here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe Audi S8 starts at $115,825 including destination, for which you get a significant amount of standard equipment, including a full leather interior, navigation, 21-inch wheels and more. There are no extra-cost paint options, but your list of hues is rather boring — everything is gray, beige, white or black. The interior on my test car sported the Vermont Brown option, which automatically adds the Cold Weather Package and $6,250 to the sticker price.\n\nThe Driver Assistance Package adds $2,100, while the excellent Bang & Olufsen premium sound system adds another $6,300. Special 21-inch wheels ring in at a bargain $250, while sport exhaust tops things off with another $1,500 for a grand total of $132,225 for my test car.\n\nThe S8’s sticker price is actually less expensive than its competitors, making the Audi something of a bargain. The Mercedes-Benz S63 AMG starts where the S8 leaves off, with an entry price of $142,375 — fully $26,000 more than the S8. The Benz does beat the S8 in terms of amenities and luxuriousness, and offers options that can’t be had on the Audi, like some serious backseat executive packages including massaging rear seats and built-in tables. Add all the options, and you’ll spend more than $186,000 for an S63.\n\nThe BMW Alpina B7 is similarly expensive, starting at $129,250 for a short-wheelbase, rear-wheel-drive version. To compare it with the S8, though, one must opt for an all-wheel-drive model for $132,250. That car comes well-equipped with only a couple major packages of safety items to add. Tick every box, and it will top out at just more than $157,000.\n\nThe Jaguar is much more competitively priced, starting at $116,925 for a base model or $3,000 more for the XJR L. It already includes a premium Meridian sound system, but adding items like an adaptive cruise control package, a rear seat executive package and carbon fiber dress-up engine bits will bring the total for a loaded model up to $140,025. Compare all four competitors here.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Audi’s flagship sedan, the A8, will get some new company at the top end of the showroom for the 2020 model year with two new variants: the high-performance S8 and a new plug-in hybrid model called the A8 TFSI e. The gasoline A8 will also add a new, turbocharged V-8 engine to the mix, which joins the extant turbo V-6.\n\nRelated: More 2019 L.A. Auto Show Coverage\n\n2020 Audi S8\n\nAs you might expect, the S8 gets a larger engine with more power — in this case a turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 that makes 563 horsepower and 590 pounds-feet of torque. Mated to standard all-wheel drive, the powertrain hustles the big sedan to 60 mph in just 3.8 seconds en route to a top track speed of 155 mph.\n\nIt also has upgrades underneath, including all-wheel steering, a sport differential and an adaptive suspension that can prepare in real time for road imperfections ahead, as intuited by sensors. To show that this is an S model and it means business, it gets aggressive styling elements such as quad exhaust tips, prominent side sills and 21-inch wheels.\n\nThe S8 makes its U.S. debut at the 2019 Los Angeles Auto Show.\n\n2020 Audi A8 60 TFSI e\n\nIt was only a matter of time until the S8 came out, but the hybrid is a bit of a surprise — and it will be a plug-in hybrid at that. The A8’s turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 engine combines with an electric motor integrated into the torque converter to produce a total system output of 443 hp and 516 pounds-feet of torque. That’s up 108 hp and 147 pounds-feet of torque over the A8’s base engine, a turbo V-6, and it means that the hybrid is actually 0.7 second quicker to 60 mph (4.9 versus 5.6 seconds).\n\nThe electric motor draws power from a 14.1-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack, which comprises 104 individual cells tucked beneath the luggage compartment. No word yet on whether this reduces the size of the fuel tank, but that’s one of many questions on the A8 TFSI e right now. Audi says fuel economy and pricing will come later, but it also didn’t specify if the TFSI e would have any all-electric range, a key characteristic of plug-in hybrids. We also don’t yet know the exact federal or state tax incentives the A8 TFSI e will qualify for. It should be in the neighborhood of $6,700 at the federal level, but check back with us as more details emerge.\n\n2020 Audi A8 60 TFSI\n\nAmid all this, the regular A8 adds a new engine option as well. Joining the V-6 is a turbo 4.0-liter V-8 that makes 453 hp and 487 pounds-feet of torque. If that sounds familiar, it has the same displacement and cylinders as the S8 but a lower power output.\n\nThat means the A8 and S8 now come in four available variants, listed with their updated pricing (including destination charges) for 2020 below:\n\nA8 55 TFSI (V-6 engine): $86,195\nA8 60 TFSI (V-8 engine): $97,795\nS8: $130,495\nA8 60 TFSI e (hybrid): TBD\n\nNo word yet on when these models will start to hit dealerships.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nAudi’s S performance designation graces the automaker’s largest sedan, the A8 flagship, in the form of the S8. The S8 is essentially the quickest A8 money can buy, and changes are few for 2008. Competitors include the Jaguar XJR and Mercedes-Benz S63 AMG.\n\nIt’s hard to imagine a full-size luxury sedan moving quickly, but that’s what the S8 does. Thanks to a 450-horsepower V-10, Audi claims it will scoot from zero to 60 mph in 4.9 seconds. The same engine powers Audi’s S6, where it produces 435 hp.\n\nFor 2008, the S8 receives newly styled 20-inch wheels and new fog lights.\n\nExterior\nDistinguishing features for the S8 include its 20-inch split-spoke alloy wheels, subtle deck lid spoiler and a deep grille with prominent lower side portals. Low-profile P265/35ZR20 performance tires are standard, and aluminum door sills wear an S8 badge. The adaptive air suspension is sport tuned.\n\nInterior\nThanks to the S8 sedan’s 115.9-inch wheelbase, interior dimensions are plentiful. In the S8, sport seats are available in dual-tone leather upholstery. Power adjustment is standard. The steering wheel has three spokes instead of four, and it’s trimmed in matching leather. Carbon fiber trim is optional.\n\nThe windows are double-glazed for better insulation, and the armrests are upholstered in leather. An optional 1,000-plus-watt sound system by Danish audio company Bang & Olufsen includes 14 speakers.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 5.2-liter V-10 utilizes Audi’s direct fuel injection technology to produce 450 hp and 398 pounds-feet of torque. It’s mated to a six-speed automatic transmission with Tiptronic manual shifting. In the S8, Tiptronic has been modified to allow for higher shift points and faster response. All told, the S8 accelerates a hair faster than even the 12-cylinder A8 W12, which costs substantially more.\n\nQuattro all-wheel drive is standard.\n\nSafety\nTen standard airbags include dual front airbags, front knee airbags, side curtain airbags and front and rear seat-mounted side-impact airbags. Four-wheel-disc antilock brakes and an electronic stability system are also standard.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nOn the heels of a redesigned A8, Audi unleashed a performance variant, the S8, for 2013. Though it’s four cylinders short of the 12-cylinder A8 W12, the S8’s twin-turbo V-8 makes more power and is the most powerful sedan Audi has built. Competitors include the Mercedes-Benz S63 AMG and Jaguar XJ SuperSport.\nExterior   \nThe S8 is based on the regular-length A8, not the extended-wheelbase A8 L. In line with Audi’s S treatment, the S8 has subtle changes versus the A8. Among them are a tweaked grille, modified side sills, a rear bumper air diffuser and quad tailpipes. Twenty-one-inch alloy wheels are standard. A sport-tuned adaptive air suspension has three selectable ride heights.\nInterior\nDiamond-stitched leather seats with heating, ventilation and massaging functions are standard. The instruments have unique white-on-gray detailing. Audi’s drive select program allows drivers to dial in specific settings for drivetrain, steering and suspension response.\nUnder the Hood\nWith a twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8 cranking out 520 horsepower and 479 pounds-feet of torque — nearly as much horsepower and a lot more torque than Audi’s R8 V-10 supercar — the S8 should hit 60 mph in about 4 seconds. Thanks in part to a cylinder deactivation feature, the new S8 consumes 23 percent less fuel than its V-10 S8 predecessor while making 15 percent more power, Audi says.\n\nAn eight-speed automatic transmission is standard.\n\nSafety\nThe S8’s brakes measure a colossal 15.7 inches up front and 14 inches in back, with six-piston front calipers. That’s about the same size as the front discs on a Ferrari FF. A bevy of airbags, antilock brakes and an electronic stability system are standard. Options include lane departure and blind spot warning systems, forward collision warning with automatic braking, and night vision with pedestrian detection.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nAudi unveiled a lavishly redesigned A8 sedan at the Paris Motor Show in September 2002, but it wont go on sale until the 2004 model year. The German automakers flagship vehicle, which is still available in regular- and extended-length (A8 L) forms, gets only a few revisions in option-package content for 2003. The A8s Premium Package now includes heated front and rear seats, a navigation system, xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights, a heated steering wheel, a tire-pressure monitor, five-spoke 17-inch alloy wheels, and a power rear sunshade and manual rear side shades.\n\nThe 2003 A8 L may be equipped with 18-inch wheels. Its Premium Package includes a front and rear Parktronic parking-assist system, a navigation system, a tire-pressure monitor and five-spoke 17-inch forged wheels.\n\nBoth A8 sedans use a 310-horsepower, 4-2 liter V-8 engine that teams with Audis permanently engaged quattro all-wheel-drive (AWD) system. A high-performance S8 offshoot joined Audis lineup in 2001, and it comes with a 360-hp version of the V-8 power plant. A Limited Edition Package that includes special wood trim and polished, nine-spoke 18-inch RS wheels is available for the 2003 S8.\n\nExterior\nAll Audi sedans bear a family resemblance. In standard form, the A8 rides a 113.4-inch wheelbase and measures 198.2 inches long overall. The A8 L is a little more than 5 inches longer. The skeleton-like frame and most body and suspension parts are made of aluminum. Audi claims that this makes the sedan 300 to 500 pounds lighter, stronger and more fuel efficient than rivals built mainly of steel.\n\nInterior\nThe A8 L sedans interior differs mainly in rear legroom, which is nearly 3 inches greater than that in the base model; this permits limousine-like accommodations. Standard leather upholstery comes in a choice of colors. Two decorative wood inlay types are available: burled walnut or polished sycamore.\n\nUnder the Hood\nGenerating 310 hp, the A8s 4.2-liter V-8 engine works with a Porsche-derived Tiptronic five-speed-automatic transmission and Audis permanently engaged quattro AWD system. A Sport mode permits manually selected gear changes using steering-wheel controls. A 360-hp version of the 4.2-liter V-8 with higher compression goes into the high-performance S8.\n\nSafety\nAudi leads the league in airbags with a total of eight. Two dual-stage driver and front-passenger airbags are complemented by four door-mounted side-impact airbags that protect all outboard occupants and two curtain-type airbags that drop from the roof lining and deploy along the side windows. Antilock brakes are standard. An optional Parktronic sonar system detects obstacles to the front and rear of the vehicle while parking.\n\nDriving Impressions\nPacked with posh comfort and convenience features, the A8 delivers a thoroughly luxurious experience. The easy-to-drive A8 is a superlative, subtly sophisticated road car thats not a flashy automobile.\n\nPerformance is brisk and assertive. The ride approaches bliss and handling is highly adept, and the AWD system helps on wet pavement. Passing and merging are accomplished without a worry as the energetic V-8 responds forcefully. Automatic-transmission upshifts are gentle, and downshifts are prompt and positive. While engine noise is satisfyingly muted, road sounds emerge on certain surfaces.\n\nThe controls are excellent, but some arent located in the most convenient spots. Visibility is good, except for thick B-pillars that limit the view over the drivers left shoulder. The seats are comfortable and supportive.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2003 Buying Guide\nPosted on 11/20/02",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in April 2015 about the 2015 Audi S8. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2016, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe latest Audi S8 is a fantastic blend of luxury, sportiness and capability, wrapped in an understated body that’s perfect for flying (very, very quickly) under the radar.\n\nThere are a few schools of thought when it comes to big, expensive luxury sedans. Some want ostentatious luxury — styling that wows and announces your arrival before you’ve rolled down a window. Others want subtlety — the ability to navigate traffic without causing a stir, flying under the radar while barreling down a highway at superlegal speeds. The Audi S8 definitely falls into the latter category.\n\nRolling past crowds in Daytona Gray Pearl with titanium-finish matte wheels, the massively powerful sport sedan gets no second looks. Aside from the big wheels, the conservative-looking S8 gives away none of its formidable abilities, but slide behind the wheel, fire up the rumbling, boosted V-8 engine and you’re going to smile — you’re driving one of the world’s best stealth fighters. There have been some minor styling and color updates for the 2015 model year (see the changes from 2014 to 2015 here), but the S8 mostly carries over from its last major update in 2012.\n\nExterior & Styling\nAs has been the case with Audi sedans for a few decades now, if you like the way one looks, you’ll like them all. The proportions, the creases, the look of the headlights, grille and taillights — from the tiny A3 to the big A8L, they all look nearly identical except for their size. Thankfully, the look is still classy, and the bigger each car in the lineup the better the simple lines and arching roofline appear.\n\nNew for 2015 are some updated LED headlights, a slightly revised grille, new taillights and quad oval tailpipes. You have to park a 2015 next to a 2014 to spot any differences, but seeing as how the look is still relatively fresh and attractive, there’s little to complain about. It should be noted that the S8 comes only in the shorter-wheelbase version of the A8; the longer A8L with its extra backseat legroom doesn’t get the sporty S treatment.\n\nHow It Drives\nPerhaps the best aspect of the big S8 is the car’s easy tractability. It’s a big boulevard cruiser when you want it to be, cushy and smooth with highly boosted steering, muted exhaust rumble and a firm yet completely comfortable ride. Push a couple of buttons and switch everything into Dynamic mode, though, and you suddenly have a totally different animal: loud and blisteringly quick, with stronger steering effort required, the S8’s sporty ride in Dynamic mode will knock your kidneys loose over bumps; its throttle sensitivity transforms the S8 into a muscle car. A refined muscle car, to be sure, but the speed at which the car responds and the brutality with which it accelerates make the S8 one of the most fun big sedans in the world.\n\nIt does have company, however: Other big, fast sedans like the Mercedes-Benz S63 AMG and BMW B7 Alpina are worthy challengers. If you like your luxury British-flavoured, there’s the Jaguar XJR. All three have similar missions: big bucks, lots of luxury, understated looks and massive power. All handle just as well as the S8, featuring their own adjustable suspensions. The biggest difference is perhaps the availability of long-wheelbase versions for the Jaguar and BMW — something you can’t get on the Audi or Mercedes-Benz.\n\nThe S8 is powered by Audi’s twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8, the same motor that can be found under the hood of the Bentley Flying Spur, though in this application it makes 520 horsepower. Unlike the Bentley applications, the response from the Audi V-8 here is instantaneous; there’s no lag between pressing the accelerator and forward motion. The power courses through an eight-speed automatic transmission to all four wheels via Audi’s standard quattro all-wheel-drive system.\n\nWith that much power on tap, you never have to worry about highway passing or impromptu stoplight drag races — what you do have to worry about is all that power and the quiet refinement of the S8’s interior combining to lure you into driving at speeds well in excess of the legal limit without realizing it. Some powerful cars are merely quick; the Audi is both quick and fast, able to cruise at triple-digit speeds all day long without complaint. It’s a pity there’s nowhere in the U.S. to truly (legally) experience what this autobahn-focused luxury cruiser can do, short of a racetrack.\n\nDespite its formidable motor, the S8 is outgunned by all three competitors: The Benz makes 577 hp with its twin-turbo 5.5-liter V-8, while the BMW produces 540 hp with its twin-turbo 4.4-liter V-8 engine. The Jaguar goes a different route with forced induction, pumping 550 hp out of its supercharged 5.0-liter V-8. Its aluminum-intensive construction means it’s also the lightest car in the group by a significant margin — 4,129 pounds versus the S8’s 4,685 pounds. They’re both lighter than the Benz or Bimmer, however, which tip the scales at more than 4,800 pounds each, mitigating any horsepower advantages.\n\nJudicious use of the go pedal does create a little heartburn at the gas pump, but not much. The S8 is rated 17/27/20 mpg city/highway/ combined, and my week of testing — which included about 500 miles of highway driving — earned a 24 mpg result; not bad for such a big and powerful car. The competition is not as good: The S63 AMG is rated 15/23/18 mpg, the all-wheel-drive Alpina B7 comes in at 16/24/19 mpg, while the XJR is rated 15/23/18 mpg. It may not be as powerful as its competitors, but the S8’s smaller motor pays off when it comes to fuel economy.\n\nInterior\nDebuting for 2015 is a new interior color combination that came on my test vehicle: Vermont Brown leather with “carbon twill copper” trim pieces. It’s an interesting combination, with a carbon-fiber weave featuring copper threads to give it a golden hue in direct sunlight. I’m not sold on the combination of brown interiors and dark gray exteriors, but every German luxury automaker seems to think it looks good, as I’ve seen it on countless test cars in the past couple of years.\n\nEverything is screwed together with the quality one expects from Audi — that is to say, flawlessly. Every button clicks with a precision other automakers still haven’t successfully copied, and every knob turns with a heft and weight that makes you think there’s a complicated mechanism at work behind the dash instead of just electronic bits. Nothing is touch-sensitive except an optional pad that can be used for inputting letters and numbers for the multimedia screens, if you want.\n\nThe seats are all-day comfortable, infinitely adjustable and provide plenty of room for four passengers (five is tight). It feels like a proper luxury car, done up in some sportier duds in keeping with the S8’s more athletic mission.\n\nThe competition isn’t too shabby, either; the Mercedes-Benz S63 AMG bests the S8’s onboard electronics and design. If the S8 feels luxurious, the Benz feels downright opulent, with even better materials, design, craftsmanship and trim. The Jaguar XJR is equally opulent, with a style that mixes traditional British wood and leather with modern touches, like a disappearing rotary shifter, while the BMW displays that brand’s rather Spartan aesthetic.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe S8 feels familiar inside, as Audi’s MMI multimedia- and feature-control system has been around for a while now. The familiar configuration of the rotary selector knob surrounded by four buttons (corresponding to the four corners of the screen) is still one of the best systems around. It’s easy to use without having to glance at the console and the buttons you intend to push, making it a simple system to operate while driving. It’s quick and intuitive and connects to mobile entertainment devices, like smartphones, quite easily.\n\nThe multimedia systems found in most of Audi’s competitors offer similar functionality and connectivity, but the Audi maintains an advantage in usability and on-the-fly operation. The S8 and Alpina B7 both offer standard head-up displays; one is available on the S63 but not on the Jaguar. The Audi’s is easy to use and clear even while wearing polarized sunglasses.\n\nCargo & Storage\nDespite being a full-size luxury car, the Audi S8 does not have a spacious trunk. In fact, it’s the smallest of the four competitors listed here, with just 13.2 cubic feet of space. Compare that with 15.2 cubic feet in the Jaguar, 16.3 cubic feet in the Mercedes-Benz and the comparably huge 17.7 cubic feet in the BMW, and you’ll wonder why such a large car has so little room for your stuff. If you want to expand the cargo area by folding down the seats, well, you’re out of luck there, too — of the four competitors, only the Mercedes-Benz offers a split-folding rear seat, and it’s an option.\n\nSafety\nThe S8 has not been crash-tested. Like all cars in this category, safety equipment is plentiful, high-tech and expensive, as not all of it comes standard even at the S8’s lofty prices. It has a blind spot monitor system standard, as does the Jaguar, a feature that’s an option on other vehicles. Like the rest of the pack, most of the S8’s safety equipment comes in extra-cost option packages; my test car had a few, including a Driver Assistance Package, which added adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist and lane departure warning. It lacked Audi’s night vision system, which uses an infrared camera to help the driver see oncoming threats in the dark. The Mercedes-Benz and BMW also offer such systems as options. To see all the S8’s standard safety features, click here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe Audi S8 starts at $115,825 including destination, for which you get a significant amount of standard equipment, including a full leather interior, navigation, 21-inch wheels and more. There are no extra-cost paint options, but your list of hues is rather boring — everything is gray, beige, white or black. The interior on my test car sported the Vermont Brown option, which automatically adds the Cold Weather Package and $6,250 to the sticker price.\n\nThe Driver Assistance Package adds $2,100, while the excellent Bang & Olufsen premium sound system adds another $6,300. Special 21-inch wheels ring in at a bargain $250, while sport exhaust tops things off with another $1,500 for a grand total of $132,225 for my test car. Build an S8 to your specifications here.\n\nThe S8’s sticker price is actually less expensive than its competitors, making the Audi something of a bargain. The Mercedes-Benz S63 AMG starts where the S8 leaves off, with an entry price of $142,375 — fully $26,000 more than the S8. The Benz does beat the S8 in terms of amenities and luxuriousness, and offers options that can’t be had on the Audi, like some serious backseat executive packages including massaging rear seats and built-in tables. Add all the options, and you’ll spend more than $186,000 for an S63.\n\nThe BMW Alpina B7 is similarly expensive, starting at $129,250 for a short-wheelbase, rear-wheel-drive version. To compare it with the S8, though, one must opt for an all-wheel-drive model for $132,250. That car comes well-equipped with only a couple major packages of safety items to add. Tick every box, and it will top out at just more than $157,000.\n\nThe Jaguar is much more competitively priced, starting at $116,925 for a base model or $3,000 more for the XJR L. It already includes a premium Meridian sound system, but adding items like an adaptive cruise control package, a rear seat executive package and carbon fiber dress-up engine bits will bring the total for a loaded model up to $140,025. Compare all four competitors here.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2021 Audi A8?\n\nAudi’s flagship sedan, the A8, is a rival to the Mercedes-Benz S-Class, BMW 7 Series and Lexus LS. The car’s base engine is a 335-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6; a 453-hp, twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 is available. Audi also sells a plug-in hybrid version of the A8 that can travel around 17 miles on electric power alone.
