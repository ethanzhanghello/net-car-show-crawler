      "expert_review": "The enhanced version of the German automaker’s compact A5 gets its spark from a 354-horsepower V-8, a sport-tuned suspension and all-wheel drive, plus styling tweaks that add both sporty elan and elegant flair.\n\nBut there is one glaring flaw that mars this otherwise superb sports coupe. Because I usually admire the precise steering systems from Audi and parent company Volkswagen, I was heartily disappointed in the twitchy, numb steering of the S5.\n\nThough responsive, it has a disconnected feel with zero feedback to the driver. The steering is just plain fidgety, plus it hunts unpleasantly on road grooves and imperfections. Not so critical in low-speed urban driving or on back roads, but on the highway, it takes real concentration to not veer all over your lane.\n\nToo bad, really, since S5 performs so well in every other respect. The engine accelerates with silky-smooth power and a pleasingly subdued roar, and S5 handles brilliantly on sharp corners and sweeping curves.\n\nAudi’s recent history has been a litany of home runs, from the wonderfully exotic R8 midengine sports car to the solid A6 midsize sedan. With its lineup of cars with beautiful interiors and refined road manners, Audi has moved up to parity with German giants BMW and Mercedes-Benz while carving out its own niche in style and image.\n\nAs a pioneer of road-performance all-wheel drive, which Audi calls Quattro, the cars are favored by driving enthusiasts who want something different from the usual Benzes and Beemers.\n\nS5 would be right up there in the win column if not for that dodgy steering.\n\nVehicle type: Four-passenger, two-door coupe, all-wheel drive.\n\nEngine: 4.2-liter V-8, 354 horsepower at 6,800 rpm, 325 pound-feet torque at 3,500 rpm.\n\nTransmission: Six-speed manual.\n\nWheelbase: 108.3 inches.\n\nOverall length: 182.5 inches.\n\nCurb weight: 3,891 pounds.\n\nEPA rating: 14 city, 21 highway.\n\nHIGHS: Poised drivability, gorgeous styling, accommodating interior.\n\nLOWS: Twitchy steering, tire thump, grim fuel mileage.\n\nTHE LOWDOWN\n\nPERFORMANCE: The small but potent V-8 kicks out plenty of pull, maybe not as much as the frenetic 420-horsepower RS4 sport sedan, but enough for a satisfying performance. You pay for all that at the gas pump. A six-speed manual is the only transmission available for now, with an automatic promised in the future. Shifting is quick and precise, but the clutch felt spongy.\n\nDRIVABILITY: Despite the flawed steering, S5 rates high in the fun-to-drive category.The well-engineered suspension, enhanced with all-wheel drive and stability control, makes fast cornering effortless. The car always feels poised and balanced.\n\nThe firm ride can get harsh, and the tires thump loudly on minor road irregularities.\n\nSTYLING: Audi takes the streamlined look of the A5 and adds distinctive touches to make S5 look elegant and aggressive. S5 gets a different grille treatment, four tailpipes and 19-inch alloy wheels. A string of small LED beams accent the headlights, also found on Audi R8 and S6 performance cars. The lights instantly identify the Audi sport models.\n\nINTERIOR: Another sharp interior from Audi, although the test car was trimmed in an unrelieved black monotone. A well-integrated swiveling knob makes it simple to switch through audio, navigation and climate-control settings. Other automakers should emulate this design.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Pricey at $50,000, though the S5 delivers a lot of style, performance and luxury. Now, let’s hope Audi can dial in the steering a bit better.\n\nPRICING\n\nBase price: $50,500.\n\nPrice as tested: $57,515.\n\nOPTIONS\n\n– Navigation system, $2,390.\n\n– Technology package, with rear-view camera, adaptive headlights and keyless entry and start, $1,700.\n\n– Premium sound system, $850.\n\n– Shipping, $775.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in November 2007 about the 2008 Audi S5. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s changed for 2009, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nAudi’s lineup has no shortage of performance, with various S and RS cars, but it lacked a high-performance coupe — until now. The S5 is based on the automaker’s new A5 coupe and brings a full serving of power and style to the performance-coupe corner of the market.\n\nThe S5 mostly delivers on the concept of performance in a two-door package, but overly isolated steering prevents the coupe from being the runaway winner it otherwise would be.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe S5 is one sinister-looking performance coupe, especially when finished in Phantom Black Pearl Effect, which was the color of my test model. The S5 has a flowing character line that bends smoothly along the body sides, but perhaps its most distinctive design cue is its LED daytime running lights. Used on other models, including Audi’s S6 performance sedan, the row of LEDs emits a bright white light that grabs the attention of oncoming drivers in a way those now-ubiquitous daytime running lights no longer can.\n\nEven though the S5’s lines are essentially the same as the A5’s, a number of subtle cues will tip off informed bystanders to the fact that they’re looking at an S model. Details include a revised grille, silver-colored side mirrors, quad tailpipes and unique 19-inch alloy wheels, in addition to S5 badges.\n\nRide & Handling\nThe S5’s firm suspension makes for a bumpy ride on some surfaces, but it’s not excessively rough. Enthusiasts will appreciate the minimal body roll in tight turns.\n\nThe S5’s steering system provides buttery smooth power assistance at low speeds, which makes maneuvering through parking lots a breeze. At higher speeds, the level of assist lessens, which gives you a greater sense of control, but for a performance car there’s still too much isolation from the road. If you’re looking for a coupe with steering that provides a sense of connection to the pavement, BMW has the car with its 335i.\n\nThe S5 comes standard with Audi’s Quattro all-wheel-drive system that in this application has a rear-bias torque split that sends 60 percent of engine power to the rear wheels and 40 percent to the front under normal circumstances. This setup gives the S5 some rear-wheel-drive handling qualities — like a balanced feel when putting the power down in a curve — while retaining the sure-footedness that comes with all-wheel drive.\n\nGoing & Stopping\nBMW engines often receive acclaim on this site, but Audi’s latest generation of performance engines, including the one in the S5, need to be considered in the same company — they’re that good. The S5’s 4.2-liter V-8 kicks out 354 horsepower at 6,800 rpm and 325 pounds-feet of torque at 3,500 rpm. That’s power you can appreciate every time you accelerate from a stoplight, and I often found myself running out of road as I traveled around Chicago and its suburbs. The V-8 doesn’t care one bit if you decide to wind it out to its 7,000 rpm redline, either — it just emits a turbine-like whir as engine speed builds. It’s this smooth-spinning nature that is one of the V-8’s most endearing qualities.\n\nAll this V-8-induced fun doesn’t come without penalty at the pump; the S5’s EPA-estimated gas mileage is 14/21 mpg city/highway, and the coupe is subject to a gas guzzler tax of $1,300 for its fuel-slurping ways.\n\nS5 buyers can have a six-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission. The manual transmission’s shifter slides smoothly between gears and engages with a slightly mechanical feel, but I found it more difficult than expected to creep along in heavy traffic in this car. The clutch and gas pedal are really touchy, and it’s hard to get smooth engagement when starting off, which made my wife’s head whip back and forth a few times. Even Audi’s ultra-high-performance RS 4 sport sedan was more forgiving. Drive the S5 aggressively, though, and smooth shifts become easier.\n\nIn a performance car, stopping with confidence is just as important as accelerating briskly. The S5’s brakes felt up to the task; they’re progressive and have good pedal feel.\n\nThe Inside\nInterior quality and detailing is an Audi strong suit, and the S5 doesn’t disappoint in this regard. Silver-colored trim encircles the gauges and dash vents, and high-end materials like aluminum, carbon fiber and wood are available in addition to the standard piano black accents. The overall effect is a cabin that’s both sporty and elegant — an ideal place to conduct the business of pavement punishing.\n\nThe driver and front passenger get leather sport seats that have large side bolsters on both the bottom cushion and backrest. The seats proved comfortable for the duration of my week with the car and came in handy during aggressive driving.\n\nWhile the seats were comfortable, the placement of the gas pedal made for a slightly uncomfortable leg position. When the driver’s seat was at an appropriate distance to work the clutch, I found the gas pedal too close for my liking, resulting in an uncomfortably angled right leg. It’s also a struggle to get out of the low coupe, even for the athletically inclined.\n\nThe S5 is equipped with Audi’s Multi Media Interface, which controls various vehicle operations, like choosing a radio station or changing one of the car’s settings. MMI becomes almost second nature with use, but operations like entering an address into the optional navigation system remain tedious even after you’ve familiarized yourself with the menus.\n\nThere’s room for two in the back of the S5. Despite the car’s low-slung shape, there’s tolerable space for two adults here, and more than enough for kids.\n\nSafety\nThe standard array of safety features includes antilock brakes, side-impact airbags for the front seats, front knee airbags, side curtain airbags and an electronic stability system. A backup camera and Audi’s Side Assist blind spot warning system are optional.\n\nCargo\nFor a coupe, the S5’s trunk is rather large, at 16.1 cubic feet. That compares to the BMW 3 Series’ 11.1-cubic-foot trunk and the Infiniti G37’s 7.4-cubic-foot cargo area. The S5’s space is also rather functional; the backrests of the 60/40-split folding rear seat can be released from either the cabin or the trunk, and when folded they’re nearly flat with the trunk floor. There’s also a trunk pass-thru with a ski bag.\n\nS5 in the Market\nWith a base price of $50,500, the S5 is in the thick of the luxury performance car market. If you have that kind of money to spend, your choices are many and include models like the BMW 335i coupe, with its exemplary twin-turbo six-cylinder engine, and the Mercedes-Benz CLK550 luxury coupe. In spring 2008 you’ll be able to add the BMW M3 to the upper end of the list of cars in this range.\n\nIf you want to sell cars in this kind of company, you have to find a way to distinguish your product from the competition, and Audi manages to do that with the S5 in more ways than one. With its knockout V-8, curvaceous styling and upper-echelon cabin quality, the only question left is this: Where do I sign?\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "Luxury coupes are having somewhat of a resurgence (real two-door coupes, not sedans masquerading as coupes) with recent redesigns and introductions such as the BMW 4 Series, Mercedes-Benz C-Class and Lexus RC. Now it's Audi's turn with the redesigned 2018 A5 and S5 coupes. They show off updated styling inside and out, new engines and a bevy of new tech features. The A5 and S5 are coupe counterparts to the A4/S4 sedan and share many of the redesigned 2017 A4's updates.\n\n\nThe coupe's profile is largely unchanged, though the difference is in the details with sharper, more dimensional styling front to rear. A wider, flatter grille and lower hood line combine with a lower stance for a more aggressive appearance, while the headlights and taillights are redesigned and up front feature Audi's signature LED daytime running lamps with standard xenon headlights. Full LED headlights (low/high beams) are optional and standard LED taillights get the job done in the rear.\n\nInterior\n\nA floating dashboard-mounted media screen and electronic gear selector highlight two of the most notable changes to the interior’s usability, replacing the outgoing coupe’s more traditional integrated dashboard screen and mechanical, pull-back gear selector. Audi’s optional Virtual Cockpit with 12.3-inch configurable digital instrument cluster is impressive in other Audi models we’ve tested; the massive display shows high-quality graphics ranging from traditional analog gauges to a full-width navigation display.\n\nThe S5 includes unique sport seats standard with contrast stitching and massaging function as well as a unique three-spoke, flat-bottom steering wheel. All A5 and S5 coupes have a panoramic sunroof, ambient LED lighting and interior aluminum trim standard. They also feature Apple CarPlay and Android Auto; an available 19-speaker, 755-watt Bang & Olufsen stereo is optional.\n\nUnder the Hood\n\nTwo new engines mean more power for 2017. A 252-hp turbocharged four-cylinder is the sole power plant in the A5 and it mates to a six-speed manual transmission or seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. While the A5 has standard all-wheel drive, it uses two unique systems depending on the transmission choice. With the manual transmission, the A5 drives the wheels with a new Quattro Ultra system capable of driving the front wheels only to save fuel, while the automatic A5 uses a more traditional Quattro system with standard torque split 40:60 front to rear. Audi says fuel economy estimates aren’t yet available. \n\n Under the S5’s hood is a new turbocharged six-cylinder making 21 more horsepower than its previous supercharged counterpart. Manual transmission enthusiasts will be disappointed to hear there’s no row-your-own option for the S5, as a traditional torque converter eight-speed automatic is the only S5 transmission. Enhancing the S5’s driving capabilities is an optional sport package and sport differential that splits torque between the rear wheels to enhance handling.\n\nAudi says the A5 can do zero-to-60 mph in 5.6 seconds with the automatic transmission and 5.7 seconds with the manual, while the higher-performing S5 does 60 mph in 4.4 seconds. For the A5, that’s six-tenths faster for the manual and a half-second faster than the automatic. The S5 is a half-second faster than the outgoing S5, Audi estimates.\n\nAnd If you thought the transmission and all-wheel-drive offerings were confusing, the redesigned suspension has just as many configurations. A5 coupes can come with an optional sport suspension featuring a 23-mm-lower ride height, unique anti-roll bars, dampers and springs, or you can opt for the “comfort adaptive damping” suspension that lowers ride height by 10 mm and uses adaptive, adjustable firmness dampers tunable in the Comfort, Auto, Dynamic and Individual drive modes. On the S5, there’s an optional sport adaptive damping system that replaces the standard S5 suspension.\n\nSafety\n\nStandard safety features include Audi Pre Sense City that below 52 mph can detect a collision (vehicle or pedestrian) and apply full braking power. Blind spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, adaptive cruise control and lane keep assist are all available. The adaptive cruise control features a traffic jam assist function that Audi says helps maintain a set distance in traffic from zero-to-25 mph by braking, accelerating and providing steering guidance to reduce driver fatigue.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe performance-oriented S5 and its layman twin, the A5, are aimed straight for their fellow two-door heartthrobs: the BMW 3 Series coupe and Mercedes-Benz E-Class coupe. The S5 coupe comes with a 354-horsepower V-8, all the better to compete with BMW’s M3 coupe, and the cabriolet (convertible) has a supercharged V-6.\n\nNew for 2011\nA new Titanium Sport Package available on the coupe gives the S5 black window trim, titanium-finish wheels, a black grille and black interior trim.\n\nExterior\nThe S5 is instantly recognizable as an Audi, with the brand’s customary wide-mouth grille flanked by lower air intakes. The car seems downright angry, thanks to a grille with vertical chrome bars and angular headlights. Exterior features include:\n\n\nLED daytime running lights and taillights\nStandard 19-inch alloy wheels\nAvailable sport suspension\nQuad exhaust\n\nInterior\nThe S5’s dashboard looks much like that of Audi’s larger A6. A broad dome overlaps the gauges and central information screen, which incorporates the optional navigation system. Interior features include:\n\n\nFront sport seats\nAutomatic climate control\nLeather seats\nBrushed aluminum trim\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe S5 coupe has a direct-injection 4.2-liter V-8 that’s good for 354 horsepower and 325 pounds-feet of torque. The convertible has a supercharged 3.0-liter V-6 that makes 333 hp and 325 pounds-feet of torque. Mechanical features include:\n\n\nSix-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission (V-8)\nSeven-speed automatic transmission (V-6)\nStandard all-wheel drive with rear-biased torque split\nZero to 60 mph in 4.9 seconds (coupe) or 5.1 seconds (convertible)\n\nSafety\nStandard safety features include:\n\n\nFour-wheel antilock disc brakes\nSide-impact airbags for the front seats\nSide curtain airbags\nElectronic stability system",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe performance-oriented four-seat S5 and its layman sibling, the Audi A5, are aimed straight at their fellow two-door heartthrobs: the BMW 3 Series and Mercedes-Benz C-Class. Both the S5 coupe and S5 Cabriolet (convertible) are powered by a 333-horsepower, supercharged V-6.\n\nNew for 2013\nThe S5 coupe now uses the supercharged V-6 engine from the S5 convertible, replacing the 4.2-liter V-8 previously offered.\n\nIn addition to the new engine for the coupe, the S5 gets a redesigned front bumper along with a new grille, hood, headlamps and LED daytime running lights. There’s also a restyled rear bumper. On the inside, the Multi Media Interface controls have been restyled, and there are new chrome accents. The newly available Audi Connect telematics system uses 3G cellphone technology to enable Google Maps satellite-image overlays, real-time gas prices, weather information, news and Wi-Fi service for up to eight devices.\nExterior\nThe S5 is instantly recognizable as an Audi, with the brand’s customary wide-mouth grille flanked by lower air intakes. The car looks downright angry, thanks in part to angular headlights. Exterior features include:\n\nLED daytime running lights and taillights\nSport suspension\nQuad exhaust\n\nInterior\nThe S5’s dashboard has a broad dome that overlaps the gauges and central information screen, which incorporates the optional navigation system. Interior features include:\n\nFront sport seats\nChrome interior accents\nSilk Nappa leather upholstery\nAutomatic climate control\nAvailable Bang & Olufsen premium stereo\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe S5 has a supercharged 3.0-liter V-6 that makes 333 hp and 325 pounds-feet of torque. Mechanical features include:\n\nSix-speed manual or seven-speed automatic transmission\nStandard all-wheel drive with rear-biased torque split\nAvailable sports rear differential\n\nSafety\nStandard safety features include:\n\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes\nSide-impact airbags for the front seats\nSide curtain airbags (coupe)\nElectronic stability system",

      "expert_review": "The all-wheel-drive 2015 Audi S5 deftly combines style, luxury and performance, but it needs a more compliant base suspension for better everyday comfort.\n\nThe S5 is the midlevel performance version of Audi’s luxury coupe, slotting between the regular A5 and the highest-performance RS 5. Luxury competitors are increasingly following Audi’s performance-car approach, with brands like Mercedes-Benz and Cadillac launching AMG Sport and Vsport models, respectively, that are a step below their AMG and V-Series cars. The S5 is also offered in soft-top convertible form.\n\nThe S5 coupe’s $53,425 starting price, including a $925 destination charge, is higher than those of all-wheel-drive versions of the BMW 435i and Mercedes-Benz C350 coupes, but nearly identical to the mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive Porsche Cayman (to see their specs compared, click here).\n\nOur test car had an optional seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission, which added $1,400 to the base price; additional options like a navigation system, 19-inch wheels, upgraded leather upholstery and a torque-vectoring rear differential brought the as-tested price to $63,025.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe S5’s styling hasn’t changed much since the car’s debut as a 2008 model, and the once-radical “Singleframe” grille now seems ordinary. The headlights, taillights and Audi’s plunging grille were tweaked for the 2013 model year, but the S5 still has the clean, unadorned lines that have been its signature since the beginning. Overall, the 2015 is unchanged versus the 2014 (see the two model years compared here).\n\nOur test car had a $1,300 Black Optic Package, which includes 19-inch, five-spoke wheels in a titanium finish and gloss-black trim that looked great against our test car’s $550 Misano Red paint color. Summer tires are also included in the package, but our test car was fitted with winter tires to match the season.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe S5 does some things that thoroughly impress, but there are a few characteristics that leave you shaking your head, wondering what could have been.\n\nThe 333-horsepower, supercharged 3.0-liter V-6 engine is very good. So good, in fact, that I never missed the 4.2-liter V-8 that powered the S5 coupe until the 2013 model year. The V-6 is perfectly suited to American driving, with 325 pounds-feet of torque available from just 2,900 rpm. That torque is there whenever you need it; pressing the gas pedal brings immediate thrust that shoves you back in your seat. Power delivery is smooth, linear and gratifying — every time.\n\nIt helps that the engine teams with a responsive dual-clutch transmission. Whether the gear selector is in Drive or the Sport setting, the transmission quickly kicks down a gear with just a nudge of the accelerator. Shifts are smooth and refined, but they firm up in Sport mode.\n\nAfter experiencing the transmission’s wonderful responsiveness in plain-old Drive, its manual mode is a letdown. Steering-wheel-mounted shift paddles or the console gear selector let you control gear changes, but there’s an unsatisfying delay from the time you ask for a gear change and when the transmission responds with one. It doesn’t matter whether you’re upshifting or downshifting. This has been a problem with manual modes for years, though it’s gotten better recently in some cars. The S5 isn’t one of them. Fortunately, a traditional six-speed manual transmission is standard.\n\nThe S5 coupe’s EPA-estimated gas mileage trails its competitors. It’s rated 18/28/21 mpg city/highway/combined with the automatic transmission and 17/26/20 mpg with the manual. The all-wheel-drive 435i, meanwhile, gets 24 mpg combined with an automatic and 23 mpg with a manual. The all-wheel-drive C350 coupe is automatic only and gets 22 mpg in combined driving. The fuel economy leader is the lightweight, rear-drive Cayman, which is rated 26 mpg combined with an automatic transmission.\n\nThe S5’s standard all-wheel-drive system has been tuned appropriately for performance driving. The system’s rear-biased torque distribution sends more engine torque to the rear wheels, giving the S5 the feel of a rear-wheel-drive coupe, and the available torque-vectoring rear differential proactively sends power to the outside rear wheel for better cornering performance. It’s a fun car to drive on winding roads.\n\nI grew tired, however, of the S5’s standard sport suspension. This is a firm-riding car, and the ride can be quite jarring on bumpy pavement. Even the Cayman doesn’t ride this rough. Audi offers an adaptive suspension for $1,000 that provides a choice of ride firmness.\n\nThe steering left me underwhelmed. You get only a little feedback through the steering wheel, and there’s too much power assistance. Choosing the Dynamic mode in Audi Drive Select dials it back only slightly.\n\nThe S5 has large 13.6-inch front and 13-inch rear ventilated brake discs, but the brake system in our test car had a tendency to produce a loud, embarrassing squeal when coming to a stop. The noise would go away after a bit of driving, but it was odd to hear a non-ceramic brake system make such a racket.\n\nInterior\nThe S5’s cabin is going on 8 years old. It’s held up remarkably well, but a few elements look past their prime. The aluminum-infused wood trim is great and looks like something you’d see in an ultra-luxury car, as it should considering it’s a $1,100 option. The rubberized upper door and dashboard trim, however, is from an earlier luxury-car era, and some buttons don’t have a premium appearance.\n\nDespite the S5’s sleek exterior look, forward, over-shoulder and rear views from the driver’s seat are good. An optional backup camera further improves visibility. It’s part of a $2,900 Technology Package.\n\nThe front sport seats are wide, and I like that they include manually adjustable thigh support. The side bolsters are large and hold you in place in corners.\n\nThe two-person backseat provides passable comfort for short trips. I’m 6-foot-1 and had just enough headroom. The seat’s geometry is good, and with the front seat moved forward a little, legroom is tolerable. Large side windows keep claustrophobia at bay.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe S5 has an older version of Audi’s Multi Media Interface that has a few shortcomings: The 7-inch dashboard screen looks small in an era when displays are now regularly 8 inches and larger, and entering a destination into the navigation system with the console knob controller is a tedious process.\n\nThe biggest problem with MMI is the location of direct-access buttons for audio, navigation and other systems. They frame the knob controller, and I had to take my eyes off the road whenever I needed to use one of them. Perhaps the location of each button would become familiar in time, but it wasn’t on initial use.\n\nBluetooth cellphone connectivity is standard, and Bluetooth streaming audio is included with the Technology Package. The system readily paired with my iPhone, but I had to hunt around in the multimedia system settings to activate the streaming audio function.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe 12.2-cubic-foot trunk is a little larger than the C350’s 11.7-cubic-foot luggage area, but it’s smaller than the 435i’s trunk, which measures 15.7 cubic feet. The mid-engine Cayman has front and rear luggage areas that total 15 cubic feet.\n\nThe S5’s trunk has a rectangular shape with few intrusions. A 60/40-split folding backseat is standard, and lowering both sections of the backrest reveals a large opening between the trunk and cabin for carrying longer items.\n\nSafety\nNeither the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety nor the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has crash-tested the S5, but it’s not uncommon for sporty cars to go untested.\n\nThe Technology Package includes a few safety-oriented features, like rear parking sensors and a backup camera, but only one active-safety feature: blind spot warning. Adaptive cruise control is also optional. Active-safety features such as forward collision warning with autonomous braking and lane departure prevention are becoming increasingly common in the luxury segment, and both features are optional on the C350 coupe. For a full list of the S5’s safety features, see the Features & Specs page.\n\nValue in Its Class\nIt’s not unusual for optional features to significantly bump up a luxury car’s price, and that’s what the $8,200 in optional features did to our S5. Some of the things that cost extra, however, should really be standard; you shouldn’t have to pay extra for a backup camera in a luxury car, and the torque-vectoring rear differential should be included, too, considering the S5’s performance focus.\n\nAudi does performance-oriented luxury well, but there are some clear areas where the S5 needs to be better to keep pace in its class. Considering this model’s age, that next effort may not be far off.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in March 2015 about the 2015 Audi S5. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2016, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe all-wheel-drive 2015 Audi S5 deftly combines style, luxury and performance, but it needs a more compliant base suspension for better everyday comfort.\n\nThe S5 is the midlevel performance version of Audi’s luxury coupe, slotting between the regular A5 and the highest-performance RS 5. Luxury competitors are increasingly following Audi’s performance-car approach, with brands like Mercedes-Benz and Cadillac launching AMG Sport and Vsport models, respectively, that are a step below their AMG and V-Series cars. The S5 is also offered in soft-top convertible form.\n\nThe S5 coupe’s $53,425 starting price, including a $925 destination charge, is higher than those of all-wheel-drive versions of the BMW 435i and Mercedes-Benz C350 coupes, but nearly identical to the mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive Porsche Cayman (to see their specs compared, click here).\n\nOur test car had an optional seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission, which added $1,400 to the base price; additional options like a navigation system, 19-inch wheels, upgraded leather upholstery and a torque-vectoring rear differential brought the as-tested price to $63,025.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe S5’s styling hasn’t changed much since the car’s debut as a 2008 model, and the once-radical “Singleframe” grille now seems ordinary. The headlights, taillights and Audi’s plunging grille were tweaked for the 2013 model year, but the S5 still has the clean, unadorned lines that have been its signature since the beginning. Overall, the 2015 is unchanged versus the 2014 (see the two model years compared here).\n\nOur test car had a $1,300 Black Optic Package, which includes 19-inch, five-spoke wheels in a titanium finish and gloss-black trim that looked great against our test car’s $550 Misano Red paint color. Summer tires are also included in the package, but our test car was fitted with winter tires to match the season.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe S5 does some things that thoroughly impress, but there are a few characteristics that leave you shaking your head, wondering what could have been.\n\nThe 333-horsepower, supercharged 3.0-liter V-6 engine is very good. So good, in fact, that I never missed the 4.2-liter V-8 that powered the S5 coupe until the 2013 model year. The V-6 is perfectly suited to American driving, with 325 pounds-feet of torque available from just 2,900 rpm. That torque is there whenever you need it; pressing the gas pedal brings immediate thrust that shoves you back in your seat. Power delivery is smooth, linear and gratifying — every time.\n\nIt helps that the engine teams with a responsive dual-clutch transmission. Whether the gear selector is in Drive or the Sport setting, the transmission quickly kicks down a gear with just a nudge of the accelerator. Shifts are smooth and refined, but they firm up in Sport mode.\n\nAfter experiencing the transmission’s wonderful responsiveness in plain-old Drive, its manual mode is a letdown. Steering-wheel-mounted shift paddles or the console gear selector let you control gear changes, but there’s an unsatisfying delay from the time you ask for a gear change and when the transmission responds with one. It doesn’t matter whether you’re upshifting or downshifting. This has been a problem with manual modes for years, though it’s gotten better recently in some cars. The S5 isn’t one of them. Fortunately, a traditional six-speed manual transmission is standard.\n\nThe S5 coupe’s EPA-estimated gas mileage trails its competitors. It’s rated 18/28/21 mpg city/highway/combined with the automatic transmission and 17/26/20 mpg with the manual. The all-wheel-drive 435i, meanwhile, gets 24 mpg combined with an automatic and 23 mpg with a manual. The all-wheel-drive C350 coupe is automatic only and gets 22 mpg in combined driving. The fuel economy leader is the lightweight, rear-drive Cayman, which is rated 26 mpg combined with an automatic transmission.\n\nThe S5’s standard all-wheel-drive system has been tuned appropriately for performance driving. The system’s rear-biased torque distribution sends more engine torque to the rear wheels, giving the S5 the feel of a rear-wheel-drive coupe, and the available torque-vectoring rear differential proactively sends power to the outside rear wheel for better cornering performance. It’s a fun car to drive on winding roads.\n\nI grew tired, however, of the S5’s standard sport suspension. This is a firm-riding car, and the ride can be quite jarring on bumpy pavement. Even the Cayman doesn’t ride this rough. Audi offers an adaptive suspension for $1,000 that provides a choice of ride firmness.\n\nThe steering left me underwhelmed. You get only a little feedback through the steering wheel, and there’s too much power assistance. Choosing the Dynamic mode in Audi Drive Select dials it back only slightly.\n\nThe S5 has large 13.6-inch front and 13-inch rear ventilated brake discs, but the brake system in our test car had a tendency to produce a loud, embarrassing squeal when coming to a stop. The noise would go away after a bit of driving, but it was odd to hear a non-ceramic brake system make such a racket.\n\nInterior\nThe S5’s cabin is going on 8 years old. It’s held up remarkably well, but a few elements look past their prime. The aluminum-infused wood trim is great and looks like something you’d see in an ultra-luxury car, as it should considering it’s a $1,100 option. The rubberized upper door and dashboard trim, however, is from an earlier luxury-car era, and some buttons don’t have a premium appearance.\n\nDespite the S5’s sleek exterior look, forward, over-shoulder and rear views from the driver’s seat are good. An optional backup camera further improves visibility. It’s part of a $2,900 Technology Package.\n\nThe front sport seats are wide, and I like that they include manually adjustable thigh support. The side bolsters are large and hold you in place in corners.\n\nThe two-person backseat provides passable comfort for short trips. I’m 6-foot-1 and had just enough headroom. The seat’s geometry is good, and with the front seat moved forward a little, legroom is tolerable. Large side windows keep claustrophobia at bay.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe S5 has an older version of Audi’s Multi Media Interface that has a few shortcomings: The 7-inch dashboard screen looks small in an era when displays are now regularly 8 inches and larger, and entering a destination into the navigation system with the console knob controller is a tedious process.\n\nThe biggest problem with MMI is the location of direct-access buttons for audio, navigation and other systems. They frame the knob controller, and I had to take my eyes off the road whenever I needed to use one of them. Perhaps the location of each button would become familiar in time, but it wasn’t on initial use.\n\nBluetooth cellphone connectivity is standard, and Bluetooth streaming audio is included with the Technology Package. The system readily paired with my iPhone, but I had to hunt around in the multimedia system settings to activate the streaming audio function.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe 12.2-cubic-foot trunk is a little larger than the C350’s 11.7-cubic-foot luggage area, but it’s smaller than the 435i’s trunk, which measures 15.7 cubic feet. The mid-engine Cayman has front and rear luggage areas that total 15 cubic feet.\n\nThe S5’s trunk has a rectangular shape with few intrusions. A 60/40-split folding backseat is standard, and lowering both sections of the backrest reveals a large opening between the trunk and cabin for carrying longer items.\n\nSafety\nNeither the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety nor the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has crash-tested the S5, but it’s not uncommon for sporty cars to go untested.\n\nThe Technology Package includes a few safety-oriented features, like rear parking sensors and a backup camera, but only one active-safety feature: blind spot warning. Adaptive cruise control is also optional. Active-safety features such as forward collision warning with autonomous braking and lane departure prevention are becoming increasingly common in the luxury segment, and both features are optional on the C350 coupe. For a full list of the S5’s safety features, see the Features & Specs page.\n\nValue in Its Class\nIt’s not unusual for optional features to significantly bump up a luxury car’s price, and that’s what the $8,200 in optional features did to our S5. Some of the things that cost extra, however, should really be standard; you shouldn’t have to pay extra for a backup camera in a luxury car, and the torque-vectoring rear differential should be included, too, considering the S5’s performance focus.\n\nAudi does performance-oriented luxury well, but there are some clear areas where the S5 needs to be better to keep pace in its class. Considering this model’s age, that next effort may not be far off.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Are the Audi A5 and S5 Good Compact Luxury Sedans?\n\nThe redesigned 2025 A5 and S5 are exceptionally good luxury sedans. Both are roomy, handle well, and have at least adequate power and mostly excellent tech. The touch-sensitive steering wheel and door-panel controls are frustrating, however.\n\nHow Do the Audi A5 and S5 Compare With Other Compact Luxury Sedans?\n\nThe A5 may trail the Genesis G70’s base engine in power a bit, but it feels more refined, and the S5 has enough get-up-and-go to keep up with other mid-level sports sedans. Both Audis have excellent, luxurious interiors and technology that match or best anything from competitors.\n\nThe redesigned 2025 Audi A5 and S5 replace both the previous A5 and the A4 family of sedans — which are both also being sold as 2025 models. Confusing? We think so. But here’s what you need to know: The new A5 and S5 have “more” than their predecessors in just about every way, including physical size, power and technology. Does that mean the new 2025 A5 and S5 are better than the two model lines they’re replacing?\n\nTo find out, I headed to Colorado to drive them on open highways and snow-lined mountain roads (per Cars.com’s ethics policy, we pay for our travel and lodging costs when attending such manufacturer-sponsored events).\n\nRelated: All-New 2025 Audi A5 Replaces Previous A5 and A4\n\nIn this review, assume that I’m talking about the new 2025 A5 and S5 unless specifically stated otherwise. The new sedans use a new platform, dubbed Premium Platform Combustion, that embiggens the car in pretty much every dimension: The 2025 A5 and S5 are wider, taller, longer and have a longer wheelbase than their predecessors. Both new sedans also have more power, with the A5’s turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder now making 268 horsepower and 295 pounds-feet of torque, increases of 7 hp and 22 pounds-feet. The S5, meanwhile, retains a turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 with 362 hp and 406 pounds-feet of torque, which is up 13 hp and 37 pounds-feet. The other major change is the addition of the new Audi Digital Stage infotainment suite, which incorporates an 11.9-inch digital instrument panel and a new 14.5-inch center touchscreen.\n\nThis review is based on my experience with the top Prestige trim levels of the 2025 A5 and S5. The as-tested price of the A5 I drove was $58,840, while the S5 came to $73,940 (all prices include a $1,295 destination fee).\n\nRelated Video:\n\nHow Are the New Interiors of the 2025 Audi A5 and S5?\n\nThe biggest news, to me, is that both the A5 and S5 are luxury compact sedans that let me actually fit in the backseat with the front seat adjusted to my driving position. The added length and longer wheelbase, along with increased height, turn the backseat from a penalty box to a usable space for adults. I’m 6-foot-1, and I used all of the available headroom in the back (thank you, sloping roofline), but I prefer that to having my legs squished.\n\nThe dramatic interior improvements in both models don’t stop with just increased space; the new Audi Digital Stage is a massive improvement over the previous screen tech. We always prefer physical climate controls, which the prior A5 and S5 had, but the dedicated and easy-to-use climate-control bar at the bottom of the center touchscreen is much better than what Audi uses in some of its models: a secondary touchscreen that was also a fingerprint and smudge magnet. Dynamic interior lighting provides visual cues for safety systems and car actions — green lights appear to indicate a turn signal, for instance — and they’re a helpful visual cue so you don’t accidentally leave that turn signal on.\n\nMaterials quality is excellent in both the A5 and S5, with the A5 a more traditionally luxurious space with wood accents while the S5 replaces the wood with carbon fiber and adds simulated-suede trim. The sportier front seats in the S5 were a bit too aggressively bolstered for my tastes and not as comfortable for longer driving as the A5’s seats. There’s more cargo space by Audi’s measurements — we still need to measure the cargo area using our methodology — but anecdotally, it seems extremely usable in an almost hatchback-like way, and the low load floor and wide opening are significant pluses.\n\nThe A5 and S5 interiors also have some quirky features. An available 10.9-inch front passenger display is one of the most obvious, and it’s frustratingly visible in certain situations while driving. I’d much prefer this secondary screen remain hidden from the driver at all times. The available panoramic glass roof with variable light control is also a very interesting choice. Rather than opening, the panel’s transparency is adjustable; it’s a fun party trick, but I’d rather have the option of fresh air. Most aggravating, however, are the touch-sensitive controls on the steering wheel and driver’s door. The controls are clumsier than physical buttons, switches and knobs, and the steering-wheel controls are prone to inadvertent activation while driving, which can be frustrating and distracting.\n\nHow Does the 2025 Audi A5 Drive?\n\nPowertrain upgrades are less dramatic, but they give the A5 a refined and capable engine that’s more than enough for a daily driver, even if it doesn’t have class-leading power. Power figures are roughly mid-pack for the class, and while the A5’s 268 hp and 295 pounds-feet of torque represent a modest improvement over previous models, the refinement of its turbo four-cylinder is more impressive.\n\nThe A5’s longer wheelbase also contributes to a more comfortable ride, with excellent isolation inside the cabin — even with a conventional steel-spring suspension. Steering and suspension enhancements make the driving experience more engaging, but the A5 is at its best as a comfortable cruiser, not as a sports sedan.\n\nHow Does the 2025 Audi S5 Drive?\n\nThat’s where the S5 comes in. With 362 hp and 406 pounds-feet of torque from its turbo 3.0-liter V-6, the S5 hustles up and down mountain roads easily. A manufacturer-estimated 4.3-second 0-60 mph time feels achievable if not beatable. Audi’s steering and suspension enhancements here allow for a much more confident driving experience, with significantly increased feel and communication. The available adaptive suspension that was on the car I drove still retains a measure of comfort, too, even in its most aggressive setting.\n\nThe S5 is meant to be a bridge between the comfortable A5 and a (currently hypothetical) RS 5 high-performance variant, and it’s at the center of the Venn diagram of Audi models: regular models on the left, RS models on the right and S models in between.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2025 Audi Q5 and SQ5 Review: Bolder, Mostly Better\nNew 2025 Audi A5 and S5 Get Modest Bump in Price\n2025 Audi A3 and S3 Review: Dynamic Duo\nAll-New 2026 Audi A6: Refining a Sports Sedan Favorite\nShop for a 2025 Audi A5 Near You\nAre the 2025 Audi A5 and S5 Better?\n\nSo, are the bigger, all-new 2025 A5 and S5 better than their predecessors? The answer is an emphatic yes. The consolidation of model lines into one capable liftback sedan lineup feels smart in this SUV-heavy era, and the larger Premium Platform Combustion architecture provides a host of improvements. The price you pay for those improvements is some confounding controls, but it’s worth it.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "I’m sitting at the keyboard, waiting for the words to start flowing. And waiting…\n\nThe admonition “Don’t say anything unless you can say something nice” comes to mind, but that’s not quite right because there are plenty of nice things to say about today’s test car, the 2010 Audi S5 Quattro Cabriolet.\n\nIn fact, “no expense was spared” and “the best of everything” also come to mind. So what’s the problem, Griff? \n\nWell. Let’s rate the car step by step, giving a grade of 1 to 5 for each category, and see where that takes us.\n\nEngine: Our convertible S5 is powered by a supercharged 3.0-liter V-6 that produces 333 horsepower and 325 lb.-ft of torque. It fits my preference for smaller engines that are built for performance and economy. The S5’s V-6 compares favorably with the 4.2-liter V-8 that’s available in the S5 coupe, which offers 354 horsepower and the same 325 lb.-ft. of twist. The V-6 gets all 5 of my mythical points.\n\nTransmission:  The 7-speed S-Tronic with paddle shifters is about two speeds too many for me. I know the theory is to have close ratios at lower speeds for performance and overdrive ratios at the top end for economy. But it’s just too busy with the choreographed sound that gives a blip-blip-blip exhaust note at each shift, and they come fast. The tranny only gets 3 points.\n\nQuattro all-wheel-drive system:  Audi’s latest system is refined, sending 40 percent of the power to the front wheels and 60 percent to the rear. Out test car also had an optional “sports rear differential” that further adjusts power output between the rear wheels (think Positraction). However, does one need all-wheel-drive along with its added weight on a convertible?  A place it might be handy is in California where you can drive from the beach to the ski slopes in a few hours and get some surprise snow. The rear differential salvages a mere 2 points in this category.\n\nStyling:  5 points. The pictures (inside & out) say it all. Even on my most curmudgeonly day, I’d give this car an admiring glance. From the LED running lights to the LED tail lights, it’s a head-turning vehicle.\n\nInterior quality:  Wonderful materials, nice instrument layout, user-friendly navigation system (though Audi calls it an MMI “multimedia interface”), and comfortable seats. 4.5 points.\n\nInterior space:  Front-row passengers will find abundant room, though the driving position is quite low. That was OK for me because I have a long torso, but shorter drivers will be moving the seat as high as it can be adjusted. Rear-seat passengers?  I can’t imagine any. I generally test rear-seat comfort when I get in back to take photos of the instrument panel.\n\nIn this case, there was no way so I wound up sitting on the convertible top cover with my feet on the seats. There are rear-seat climate controls (certainly a place to cut some costs). I think even a three-year-old in a car seat would be kicking the back of the front seats. Why pretend the rear seats are usable space? If this were “The Gong Show,” I’d be reaching for the hammer. 5 points for the front minus 2 for the rear for 3 points.\n\nConvertible top: An engineering marvel. It goes down (or up) in 15 seconds, a maneuver that can be accomplished at up to 30 mph, something we didn’t try. The top is three-layered, weather-proof, insulated, and has a glass rear window. It saves weight over a hardtop convertible and stashes so completely there truly is decent-sized trunk space. 5 points and a tip of the hat to the engineers.\n\nPrice: The MSRP is $58,250, plus $825 destination for a pricey luxury-performance convertible. The Prestige option ($5,700) adds a terrific Bang & Olufsen sound system, advanced keyless operation, navigation, auto-dimming mirrors inside and out, and seat/mirror memory. Audi Drive ($3,950) adds the sports rear differential and adaptive suspension & steering settings. A Driver Assist package ($900) gives you blind-spot warnings, backup camera, and rear sensors. That totals a mere $69,625. My feeling is that if you want to go cruising in style, the A5 (starting at $42,000) could be nicely outfitted for under $50,000 and give you plenty of pleasure with a bit less performance. No points here.\n\nMy point: Marvelous car but the sum is less than the total of the points. I prefer it when it’s the other way around.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Audi A5?\n\nThe Audi A5 and its siblings were redesigned for 2018 and are derived from the A4 sedan. They’re offered in three body styles, all with standard all-wheel drive. The A5 and S5 come in coupe, convertible and four-door hatchback (Sportback) body styles; the high-performance RS5 comes in coupe and Sportback body styles.\n\nA5 models have a 248-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that works with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. The S5 has a 349-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 and an eight-speed automatic. The RS5, meanwhile, gets a 444-hp, turbocharged 2.9-liter V-6 and an eight-speed automatic. Competitors include the BMW 4 Series, Mercedes-Benz C-Class coupe and Infiniti Q60. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2019 Audi A5?\n\nPark assist is now standard on Prestige models, and a new Black Optic Plus Package is available on the A5 coupe and Sportback with black exterior and interior trim, a sport suspension, 19-inch wheels and summer tires. The RS5 gains a Sportback model, and the Virtual Cockpit and MMI navigation systems are now standard. New Alu Optic and Black Optic packages for the RS5 add 20-inch forged wheels, plus carbon-fiber and gloss-black exterior trim.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Audi A5 Are Most Important?\n\nThis lineup provides capable handling in different weather conditions with its standard all-wheel drive, but Audi also offers a variety of suspension options, including an adaptive suspension and sport (meaning stiffer) setup, depending on the model.\n\nThe available Virtual Cockpit has a 12.3-inch configurable display that shows high-quality graphics ranging from traditional analog gauges to a full-width navigation display. Standard safety features include Audi Pre Sense City, which can detect a collision and automatically apply the brakes. Blind spot warning, rear cross-traffic alert, adaptive cruise control and lane departure warning are available. \n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Audi A5?\n\nThere are many things to like about this line of cars — styling, performance, interior quality, and features such as Virtual Cockpit. However, it's short on practicality, with a tight backseat that's short on headroom. Many cars that cost around $50,000 leave us expecting more for that much money, but the A5 and its siblings provide enough of a driving and luxury experience to warrant strong consideration.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Audi A5?\n\nFor luxury car shoppers who like choices, the Audi A5 is offered as a coupe, convertible (Cabriolet) and four-door hatchback (Sportback). In the A5 Sportback, the standard engine is a 201-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder coupled with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission; a 261-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder is the base engine in the coupe and convertible. All three come standard with Audi’s Quattro all-wheel-drive system. Performance fans can opt for an S5, which is available in all three body styles and features a 349-hp, turbo 3.0-liter V-6 engine, eight-speed automatic transmission, firmer suspension and upgraded brakes. If that’s not enough, the high-performance RS 5 gets a 444-hp, twin-turbo 2.9-liter V-6 and other performance upgrades, though it’s offered only as a coupe or hatchback. The A5 family’s rivals include the Acura Integra, BMW 4 Series, Lexus IS and Mercedes-Benz C-Class.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Audi A5?\n\nChanges to the 2023 Audi A5 and S5 are limited to minor feature and option package updates. The Black Optics appearance package now includes black exhaust tips and a black rear spoiler, and adaptive cruise control is now grouped into the available Convenience Package. The mid-range Premium Plus trim gets a Bang & Olufsen stereo, and the RS 5’s new Competition Package includes a performance-tuned suspension, stickier performance tires, and an RS sport exhaust system.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Audi A5 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nAll-wheel drive\nTri-zone climate control\nLED headlights with high-beam assist\nLeather seats\nHeated front seats\n10.1-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nPower-operated trunk lid\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure warning\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nAudi Virtual Cockpit with 12.3-inch instrument panel screen\nVentilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nAdaptive cruise control\n360-degree camera system\nHead-up display\nBang & Olufsen premium stereo\nRear cross-traffic alert\nBlind spot warning\nShould I Buy the 2023 Audi A5?\n\nThe Audi A5 offers sleek styling in the coupe, open-air thrills in the convertible, and a roomier backseat and spacious trunk in the four-door Sportback. The S5 and RS 5 offer higher levels of performance and, not surprisingly, significantly steeper price tags. Engine refinement is excellent, and cabin quality helps the A5 stand out among some very worthy competitors. Keep in mind the rear seats in the coupe and convertible are snug for taller adults, and luggage space is especially dear in the droptop A5. Audi would also be smart to include more standard safety features, like blind spot warning and rear cross-traffic alert. These days, such features are often standard on budget-minded vehicles that cost a fraction of the A5’s price.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2021 Audi A5?\n\nLike the A4 from which it’s derived, the Audi A5 received a subtle makeover for 2020. It’s offered in three distinct body styles — coupe, convertible and four-door hatchback (Sportback) — and all of them come with standard all-wheel drive. \n\nThe base A5 is powered by a 201-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that works with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. One step higher is a 261-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that pairs with the same gearbox. At the top of the performance lineup is the S5, which comes with a 349-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 engine and an eight-speed automatic transmission. Competitors include the BMW 4 Series, Mercedes-Benz C-Class coupe and Infiniti Q60. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2021 Audi A5?\n\nThe 201-hp engine is new, and the 261-hp engine has received a slight power boost, along with a new mild-hybrid system. Wireless Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity and lane departure warning are now standard.  \n\nWhat Features in the 2021 Audi A5 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nLeather seats\nHeated front seats\nTri-zone automatic climate control\n10.1-inch touchscreen\nAutomatic emergency braking\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nAudi Virtual Cockpit with 12.3-inch instrument panel screen\nVentilated front seats\nAdaptive cruise control\n360-degree camera system\nHead-up display\nBang & Olufsen premium stereo\nBlind spot warning\nShould I Buy the 2021 Audi A5?\n\nThere are many things to like about this line of cars — factors like styling, performance, interior quality and features such as Virtual Cockpit. However, the A5 can come up short on practicality, with a tight backseat that’s skimpy in terms of headroom. Trunk space in the convertible is also at a premium. That being said, the A5 in all its variations provides enough of a driving and luxury experience to warrant strong consideration.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2022 Audi A5?\n\nThe Audi A5 is available in three distinct body styles — coupe, convertible and four-door hatchback (Sportback) — and all come with standard all-wheel drive.\n\nThe base A5 engine is a 201-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that works with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. One step higher is a 261-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder paired with the same gearbox.\n\nAt the top of the performance lineup is the S5, which comes with a 349-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 engine and an eight-speed automatic transmission. Competitors include the BMW 4 Series and Infiniti Q60.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2022 Audi A5?\n\nS line versions of the coupe and Sportback now come with a sport suspension. There’s also a new Black Optic Plus Package that includes black bumper accents, a matte-black grille with black badging, black mirror caps, black side sill blades and red-painted brake calipers. The S5 adds standard 19-inch wheels.\n\nWhat Features in the 2022 Audi A5 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nLED headlights with high-beam assist\nLeather seats\nHeated front seats\n1-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nAndroid Auto and wireless Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure warning\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nAudi Virtual Cockpit with 12.3-inch instrument panel screen\nVentilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nAdaptive cruise control\n360-degree camera system\nHead-up display\nBang & Olufsen premium stereo\nBlind spot warning\nShould I Buy the 2022 Audi A5?\n\nThe Audi A5 certainly spoils car shoppers for choice with its range of available body styles, but it comes up short on practicality due to a tight backseat that skimps on headroom. Trunk space in the convertible is also minimal. If you don’t need acres of space and want a refined luxury car with all-wheel drive and a classy cabin, the A5, in all its various forms, is worth a look.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Audi A5?\n\nFor luxury-car shoppers who like choices, the Audi A5 is offered as a coupe, convertible (Cabriolet) and four-door hatchback (Sportback). In the A5 Sportback, the standard engine is a 201-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder coupled with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. A 261-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder is the base engine in the coupe and convertible. All three come standard with Audi’s Quattro all-wheel-drive system. Performance fans can opt for an S5, which is available in all three body styles and features a 349-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 engine, eight-speed automatic transmission, firmer suspension and upgraded brakes. If that’s not enough, the high-performance RS 5 gets a 444-hp, twin-turbo 2.9-liter V-6 and other performance upgrades, though it’s offered only as a coupe or hatchback. The A5 family’s rivals include the Mercedes-Benz C-Class, BMW 4 Series, Lexus IS and Acura Integra. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Audi A5?\n\nAll models and trims except the base A5 Sportback 40 get additional standard features for 2024, including adaptive cruise control, lane departure steering assist, parking assist and a heated steering wheel with hands-on detection. The Navigation Package that’s optional on the Premium Plus trim and standard on Prestige versions gets added functionality, including traffic sign recognition that activates predictive adaptive cruise control. Navigation-equipped models now come with a six-month trial subscription to Audi Connect Plus, making music, video, gaming, navigation and other apps accessible through the center touchscreen.  \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Audi A5 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nAWD\nTri-zone climate control\nLED headlights with high-beam assist\nLeather seats\nHeated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\n10.1-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nPower-operated trunk lid\nAdaptive cruise control\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure warning\nLane departure steering assist\nParking assist \n\nAvailable features include:\n\nAudi Virtual Cockpit with 12.3-inch instrument panel screen\nVentilated front seats\n360-degree camera system\nHead-up display\nBang & Olufsen premium stereo\nRear cross-traffic alert\nBlind spot warning\nShould I Buy the 2024 Audi A5?\n\nThe A5 offers sleek styling in the coupe, open-air thrills in the convertible, and a roomier backseat and spacious trunk in the four-door Sportback. The S5 and RS 5 offer higher levels of performance and, not surprisingly, significantly steeper price tags. Engine refinement is excellent, and cabin quality helps the A5 stand out among some very worthy competitors. Keep in mind, though, that the coupe’s and convertible’s backseats are snug for taller adults, and luggage space is especially dear in the drop-top A5. Even with added standard equipment on most models for 2024, Audi would be smart to include even more standard safety features, like blind spot warning and rear cross-traffic alert.",
