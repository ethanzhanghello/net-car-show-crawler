      "expert_review": "I live in Los Angeles, where you are what you drive. Angelinos spend hours in their cars every day, fighting traffic, working and judging other drivers by their cars. We don’t have school buses; we drive our kids to school and get in line to parade our four-wheeled identities past all the other PTA moms, like pageant queens on a runway. Essentially, when it comes to choosing your car in L.A., it’s all about keeping up with the Jones’. Well, folks, I’ve got to tell you: When I drove the Audi Q7, the Jones’ were trying to keep up with me.\n\nThe Q7 is sleek and elegant to look at, showing observers what a posh mommy I am, but the true beauty of this car is more than skin deep. Just getting into the Q7 is a luxury. The ‘key’ comes in its own case, popping out at the touch of a button. It unlocks the doors and starts the engine without ever leaving my pocket or purse, and also opens the power liftgate. That’s quite a gift when you’re running to the car with nine Target bags, a half-full latte and three minutes to get to pre-school. Those are also the moments when the muy macho V-6 engine and all-wheel drive come in pretty handy. See how the 2008 Q7 compares to the ’07 version in this Side-by-Side Comparison.\n\nOf course a glamorous ride like this also comes with a serious stereo package. In the Q7, Audi’s MMI ‘Infotainment’ system is controlled by a knob in the center console. Some people find the system intimidating or just plain hard to use, but considering everything it controls and all the options it provides, it’s fairly impressive. After a bit of practice, I was happily flitting between Sirius Satellite Radio, CDs, climate control and navigation. The navigation system can even zoom out to show an area about a thousand miles across. Don’t ask me why, but I think that’s cool.\n\nThe Q7 is all about helping a mommy out. The usual wrestling match of installing car seats is entirely canceled in this car because the Latch connectors are completely exposed for easy access. Getting positioned in the driver’s seat is easy thanks to the eight-way power seats with memory, plus a tilting, telescoping steering wheel. From the rear seats, the kiddos have a great view out the windows, as well as plenty of places to stash their stuff and room enough to stretch out. A huge center armrest folds down to provide two cupholders and a flat surface for snacks and games. There are even two power outlets in the back for argument-free charging of video games and iPods. All four doors have substantial storage bins that also offer space to stash a good-sized water bottle. And just in case, there’s a cooling bin in the glove compartment to keep those cheese snacks fresh. How helpful is that?\n\nEverywhere I look, the Q7 anticipates my needs. Extra kids in the carpool today? No problem – the third row has Latch connectors. Picking up a new big-screen TV? No problem again – that third row folds flat into the floor. Wet, muddy boots? The Q7 has it covered with a hidden storage bin in the back. Cold booty from watching soccer practice in the rain? Of course the seats come with adjustable heat settings. Need to make a phone call? Well, my friends, the MMI system can store a phone directory, and it’s ready with Bluetooth technology.\n\nEven potential difficulties are addressed in the Q7. Visibility isn’t all that great from the cockpit, so the good people at Audi put giant side mirrors on the doors, a rearview camera in the back and proximity sensors all the way around. Amazingly enough, the easiest way to park the car involves looking at the 7-inch color screen in the dash. Even if I insist on doing things the old-fashioned way – looking out the windows – the Q7 helps out with beeps that get faster as I get closer to obstacles like curbs, trees and other cars.\n\nSounds like the Q7 is completely without fault, doesn’t it? It’s not quite, though it comes pretty close. Access to the third row isn’t easy, and according to the manual no one taller than 5-foot-3 is advised to sit there. The doors are heavy, and the angle of the exterior handles made it virtually impossible for my 4-year-old to open the door from the outside without help. Also, the Q7 is not exactly fuel-efficient or wallet-friendly, especially because it requires premium fuel. No one said luxury comes cheap.\n\nThe Q7 is, no doubt, a luxury car. It offers a supreme vantage point from which you can look down upon the ‘lesser folks’ on the wrong side of the Angelino tracks. Yes, it’s an SUV. Yes, it’s four-wheel drive. Yes, it seats seven and has safety features to rival anything on the road, but don’t let any of that distract from the fact that this car is pure pampering for everyone but the neighbors. They can eat their hearts out.\n\n*For more information on the Audi Q7 and its safety features, visit Cars.com.

      "expert_review": "After years of resistance, Audi capitulates and produces its own sport utility vehicle. It’s a big one, too.\n\nThe Q7 weighs in as a full-size SUV competing with the big dogs, but with the classy refinement that has made Audi a favored brand among luxury-car buyers, status seekers and driving enthusiasts.\n\nAudi has attracted the anti-SUV crowd for years with all-wheel-drive station wagons that feature the German automaker’s signature quattro little q drive system, one of the first for passenger cars. There was even an A6 All-Road, sort of a high-end equivalent for Subaru Legacy Outback.\n\nDespite steep gasoline prices, Audi noticed plenty of interest – and profits – in large-scale SUVs, especially for top import brands.\n\nAudi takes its distinctive styling cues up a size for Q7, which is based on a stretched platform from Porsche Cayenne and VW Touareg. It comes off as a brawny überwagen with a slick layer of glittering trim.\n\nAs expected from Audi, the interior is beautiful and comfortable, though the myriad of functions, buttons and controls is cluttered and gets confusing.\n\nI’ve always enjoyed the responsive drivability of Audi’s cars, but I was disappointed in Q7’s steering, which I found annoyingly twitchy. At highway speeds, the SUV felt like it was darting at the slightest wheel movement.\n\nThe throttle action was too abrupt, too, making it hard to ease away from a stop without a sharp jump. Neither is a good quality for an otherwise sophisticated ride.\n\nPERFORMANCE: The test Q7 came with a 280-horsepower V-6 that provided decent pull even for this 5,000 pound-plus behemoth. The smooth-shifting six-speed automatic helps, no doubt. A 4.2-liter 350-horsepower V-8 is available for $4,000 more, but most people would find the V-6 more than adequate, aside from towing. Even with the small engine, mileage was paltry.\n\nDRIVABILITY: Handling is surprisingly nimble for such a mighty craft, helped out by all kinds of electronic gizmos that keep it straight and true. As noted, the steering is too sensitive and the throttle hard to modulate. Nothing wrong with the brakes, though. They felt strong enough to stop the space shuttle in mid-orbit. Among the safety features, electronic stability control; four-wheel disc brakes with anti-lock and brake assist; side-curtain air bags; side-assist blind-spot warning; headlights that steer into curves; and reverse camera.\n\nSTYLING: A beefed-up version of Audi sedan styling, Q7 looks ready to rumble. Those 20-inch alloy wheels fit the image.\n\nINTERIOR: Audi folk will recognize the dashboard and console as coming from the A6 sedan, which is a good thing. The soft-leather seats are attractive and comfortable, and the cabin rises to the level of Audi’s usual excellence. The rearmost seats are bigger than some but should be reserved primarily for tykes. The gadgety dashboard controls are a pain, with too many extraneous actions needed for such things as adjusting the climate control. There’s too much techno-gear in one place in an awkward array of dials and switches. The panoramic sunroof is pretty cool, with a skyward view both front and rear.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: A stylish craft that will turn some heads. The price starts at a fairly reasonable $40,000 but climbs quickly with pricey options. A loaded V-8 models sails past $70,000.\n\nAudi Q7 Premium\n\nVehicle type: Seven-passenger, four-door SUV, all-wheel drive. Engine: 3.6-liter V-6, 280 horsepower at 6,200 rpm, 266 pound-feet torque at 2,750 rpm. Transmission: Six-speed automatic. Wheelbase: 118.2 inches. Overall length: 200.2 inches. Curb weight: 5,049 pounds. Towing capacity: 5,500 pounds. EPA rating: 16 city, 20 highway.\n\nHIGHS: Luxury interior, distinctive styling, agile handling. LOWS: Twitchy steering, fiddly controls, abrupt throttle response.\n\nPricing\n\nBase price: $45,900. Price as tested: $58,160.\n\nSELECTED OPTIONS – Infotainment package, with navigation, Bluetooth phone readiness, satellite radio, $2,800. – Technology package, with rearview camera, side-assist sensing, keyless start, voice recognition, $2,400. – Panoramic sunroof, $1,850. – 20-inch alloy wheels, $1,600. – Power tailgate, Homelink, adaptive front lighting, seat memory, $1,000. – Shipping, $720.",

      "expert_review": "Key Points\nThe 2026 Audi Q7 starts at $63,295 (all prices include $1,295 destination charge).\nA new options package is available on the entry-level Premium trim.\nThere’s more standard equipment on uplevel trims.\n\nAudi refreshed the Q7 for the 2025 model year, subtly tweaking the SUV’s front end and interior. For 2026, there are no mechanical or technological changes, but the brand has reorganized some of the Q7’s equipment.\n\nRelated: 2025 Audi Q7 Review: What’s German for ‘Goldilocks Principle’?\n\nThe new Convenience Plus Package for the entry-level Q7 45 Premium bundles many features that are otherwise unavailable in Q7s fitted with the base engine, and the mid-level Q7 55 Premium Plus gains a bunch of standard goodies, including ventilated front seats and heated outboard rear seats. On the regular Q7, the range-topping Prestige trim now includes rear-wheel steering and gets an optional Sport Plus Package with a retuned adaptive air suspension and numerous cosmetic upgrades inside and out. The Q7 and the SQ7 also now come standard with road-sign recognition.\n\nRelease Date and Pricing\n\nThe 2026 Audi Q7 is on sale now. Full line pricing is as follows:\n\nQ7\n45 Premium: $63,295\n45 Premium Plus: $67,095\n55 Premium: $68,895\n55 Premium Plus: $74,495\n55 Prestige: $78,195\nSQ7\nPremium Plus: $95,095\nPrestige: $101,095\nTrim Levels\n\nWhile Audi applies the same trim-level names to the three available engines, what’s included in each depends on the engine. Available only on the four-cylinder Q7 45, the Premium trim features keyless entry and starting, 19-inch wheels, LED exterior lighting, a panoramic moonroof and a power liftgate. Inside are leather upholstery, heated front seats, a power tilt/telescoping steering column, three-zone automatic climate control, a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, and a touchscreen infotainment system with navigation and wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.\n\nThe Q7 45 Premium Plus rides on 20-inch wheels and features upgraded interior trim and ambient lighting, as well as a 17-speaker Bang & Olufsen audio system. For the more powerful Q7 55, the Premium Plus trim level also adds an air suspension with adaptive dampers, ventilated front seats, heated outboard rear seats, four-zone automatic climate control and rear-window sunshades. The SQ7 Premium Plus also includes a sport-tuned suspension with rear-wheel steering, 21-inch wheels and stainless-steel pedals, but it does not get the ventilated front seats or heated rear seats.\n\nAt the Prestige trim level, the Q7 55 gets rear-wheel steering, organic light-emitting diode taillights, soft-close doors that power themselves closed to prevent slamming, massaging front seats and a head-up display. The SQ7 Prestige includes all of that plus the ventilated front seats, heated rear seats and Audi’s Matrix-design LED headlights.\n\nStandard and Available Safety Features\n\nThe 2026 Q7’s standard safety technologies include forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control and lane-centering steering. A 360-degree camera system is optional on the Premium and standard on the Premium Plus. Automated parking, front cross-traffic alert and night vision are available.\n\nRead More About the Audi Q7:\n\nThese Cars Do Well in Crash Tests for 2025, According to IIHS\nFresh Face, Apps Aplenty: 2025 Audi Q7 Priced from $61,695\nWhich SUVs Can Tow at Least 5,000 Pounds?\nResearch the Audi Q7\nResearch the Audi SQ7\nPowertrain Specs and MPG\n\nThe Q7 is available with four, six or eight cylinders, all three engine options paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission and standard Quattro all-wheel drive. A turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine powers the Q7 45 and makes 261 horsepower and 273 pounds-feet of torque, while the Q7 55 packs a turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 with 335 hp and 369 pounds-feet. The SQ7’s twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 boasts 500 hp and 568 pounds-feet of torque.\n\nThe Q7 45 returns an EPA-estimated 20/26/22 mpg city/highway/combined, while the Q7 55 is rated at 18/23/20 mpg. The downside to the SQ7’s high output is fuel economy of just 14/20/16 mpg. However, Audi says it will accelerate from 0-60 mph in 4 seconds flat, versus a claimed 5.5 for the Q7 55 and 6.7 seconds for the four-cylinder Q7 45. The Q7 45 can tow 4,400 pounds, while the Q7 55 and SQ7 are rated to tug up to 7,700 pounds.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Audi Q7?\n\nThe Audi Q7 is the German luxury brand’s largest SUV. It comes standard with a 261-horsepower, turbocharged four-cylinder engine, all-wheel drive and room for up to seven people in three rows. A 335-hp, turbocharged V-6 is optional, with a 500-hp, twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8 in the high-performance SQ7 variant. If you need to haul lots of people and are constantly in a hurry, this could be the luxury SUV for you. The Q7’s rivals include the BMW X7, Genesis GV80, Lincoln Aviator, Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class and Volvo XC90.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Audi Q7?\n\nUpdates to the Q7 and SQ7 include standard adaptive cruise control on all trims, as well as remote start through the Audi Connect app. An Executive Package available on upper trims now includes traffic-sign recognition, and Premium trims and higher get standard multicolor ambient LED interior lighting. An S Line sport package is newly available on the Q7 55 Prestige trim, adding an adaptive sport suspension, larger performance wheels and tires, all-wheel steering and cosmetic enhancements. \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Audi Q7 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n10.1-inch infotainment screen\n8.6-inch climate-control screen\nPower liftgate\nPanoramic moonroof\nLeather seating\nHeated front seats\nAudi Virtual Cockpit with 12.3-inch digital instrument panel\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nNavigation\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nAdaptive cruise control\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nBang & Olufsen stereo\n360-degree camera system\nAdaptive air suspension\nSoft-closing doors\nVentilated front seats\nFour-zone climate control\nHeated steering wheel\nShould I Buy the 2024 Audi Q7?\n\nThe Audi Q7 is a premium SUV that blends respectable agility with all-season grip thanks to standard Quattro all-wheel drive. The base four-cylinder is reasonably peppy and fuel-efficient, though it lacks the punch some expect in an SUV starting around $60,000. The optional turbo V-6 has both livelier acceleration and some noticeable lag when you punch the gas pedal. The SQ7 variant delivers V-8 brawn, albeit with the expected fuel-economy penalty. A mild-hybrid system aids the Q7’s fuel efficiency, but this SUV’s standout feature is the design and quality of its elegant cabin. Impeccable cabin quality is one of the Q7’s main attractions; everything inside looks and feels top-notch. Having a third row of seats is convenient, too, even if it’s best suited for kids.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2025 Audi Q7 three-row SUV delivers a rock-solid luxury experience and represents surprisingly solid value even at a very high price — but as a vehicle that hasn’t been fully redesigned since the 2017 model year, it also feels a bit dated.\n\nVersus the competition: The Q7 is every bit as luxurious as the BMW X5 and Mercedes-Benz GLE, and while its technology may feel dated, it’s also far less frustrating to use. Its standard third row of seats also makes it the most family-friendly SUV in the bunch.\n\nWith its last redesign coming for the 2017 model year, Audi’s flagship Q7 is old in car years. For 2025, it gets a mildly updated look and … that’s about it. Its infotainment system also can now download apps directly to its interface, but doing so requires an Audi Connect Plus subscription plan. (And it still has wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity.) Apps in the infotainment system are a nice backup feature, but I’d like to meet the person who won’t connect their smartphone to their Audi but will log into Spotify directly through the car. I bet they have some interesting views.\n\nRelated: Fresh Face, Apps Aplenty: 2025 Audi Q7 Priced from $61,695\n\nFor this review, we drove a 2025 Audi Q7 Prestige model to see if the SUV has fallen too far behind its competition or if it might actually represent a decent value — even at an as-tested price of $88,790 (including destination).\n\nOld-School and Silky Smooth\n\nDriving the Q7 is an exercise in smoothness. While there can be some initial lag when accelerating from a stop, the optional turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 — Audi designates it the 55 TFSI — feels adequately powerful. The engine makes 335 horsepower and 369 pounds-feet of torque, and while those aren’t eye-watering numbers, the Q7 hustles along smoothly and brilliantly. I never felt disappointed or wanting for more during my time behind the wheel, but for shoppers who do, Audi also makes the sportier SQ7.\n\nThe Q7’s eight-speed automatic transmission pairs well with the V-6; it hesitates slightly in full-throttle passing maneuvers, downshifting most of the way in an initial effort before finishing the job with a second downshift. It’s otherwise well behaved and good at finding the right gear for a quiet ride.\n\nFor a nice party trick, the V-6 Q7 is rated to tow up to 7,700 pounds with an optional towing package, which adds a hitch receiver and seven-pin wiring plug for connecting a trailer. While Q7 buyers don’t strike me as the kind of people who tow frequently, it’s a nice-to-have feature. At that weight, though, I’d want to have a trailer brake controller to keep everything under control, and the Q7 doesn’t include one as standard or optional equipment in the traditional sense, though you can find one — and pretty much anything else you need to safely tow — in Audi’s accessories catalog.\n\nWhile the Q7’s V-6 is excellent, it’s also why this SUV feels a bit behind the times: The Q7 lacks the power or efficiency (or both) of notable competitors. While the EPA rates the Q7’s V-6 at 18/23/20 mpg city/highway/combined, the 2025 BMW X5 xDrive40i and its turbocharged inline-six-cylinder is rated at 23/27/25 mpg and makes 375 hp and 398 pounds-feet of torque. The all-wheel-drive 2025 Mercedes-Benz GLE450 isn’t quite as efficient at 19/25/21 mpg, but it also offers up to 395 hp and 517 pounds-feet when its boost mode is engaged. The 2025 Volvo XC90 B6 with AWD is also more efficient than the Audi, at 20/26/23 mpg, though its powertrain only makes 295 hp and 310 pounds-feet.\n\nAll three of those competitors use mild-hybrid technology to increase efficiency and performance, and all three also offer a plug-in hybrid variant for even greater efficiency and a short all-electric driving range. Audi hasn’t gone in that direction yet here in the U.S., and it likely won’t until the Q7 gets a full redesign. Again, the Q7’s turbo V-6 is a great engine and well suited to this SUV, it’s just thirstier and less powerful than some of its competitors’ powertrains.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nQuiet, Comfortable and Not Too Futuristic\n\nWhat I like so much about the Q7 goes well beyond its powertrain. The cabin is a comfortable (at least in the first two rows of seats) and, most important, quiet place to be. With the available Prestige Package, buyers also get dual-pane glass on the side windows. Even with its most powerful engine, the Q7 is the quietest car I’ve driven this side of an all-electric vehicle in a long time.\n\n“Cushy” is a good way to describe the adaptive air suspension that comes with the Prestige Package. It absorbs bumps and imperfections, keeping the worst the road offers from transmitting into the cabin — even with my test vehicle’s optional 21-inch wheels and tires. The air suspension also does an excellent job controlling body movement in corners. The aim is not to carve up a canyon, but to keep occupants comfortable, and it does this job well. Optional four-wheel steering also adds a level of nimbleness that makes the Q7 easy to maneuver, ensuring navigating a crowded parking lot is as low-stress as possible.\n\nMaterials and build quality are also top-notch; while I found my test vehicle’s Saiga beige interior a bit busy visually, with multiple colors and trim materials, it felt nice to the touch. Quality doesn’t dip in the second row, which in the Prestige trim gets its own set of climate controls and vents. The second row is a bench seat that slides and reclines for additional occupant comfort and to make third-row access easier. More on that later.\n\nLike its powertrain, the Q7’s interior tech is also a bit behind the times — though unlike the powertrain, that may be a good thing. The latest iteration of Audi’s MMI interface sits in the Q7’s 10.1-inch touchscreen. The graphics are a bit dated and the screen is small, but it mostly works well. Below that touchscreen is a separate touch panel for climate controls and additional features. While I’d prefer physical climate controls, a dedicated panel is better than touch-sensitive controls in the infotainment screen. Audi’s Virtual Cockpit, which features a 12.3-inch digital instrument panel, also works well, with crisp graphics and useful configurability. As more and more competitors move to huge touchscreens with complex menus and unnecessary screen-based climate controls — including, somehow, controls for the vents themselves — Audi’s older-school approach feels ever more appealing. We have also, however, routinely noted that this setup is a magnet for fingerprints, so be sure to keep a cleaning cloth on hand.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nWhich SUVs Can Tow at Least 5,000 Pounds?\nWhich Cars Have Panoramic Moonroofs or Sunroofs?\n2025 Audi RS Q8 Performance: Brand’s Most Powerful Combustion Engine Starts at $137,495\nResearch the 2025 Audi Q7\nFind a 2025 Audi Q7 for Sale Near You\nThe Third-Row Problem\n\nThe most interesting thing to me about the Q7 is its standard third row of seats, which are small and lack the amenities and nice materials of the second row. They’re also hard to access; the tilt-and-fold process for the second-row seats involves multiple levers and no powered controls, and it results in a small space for adults to climb through to get to the wayback. In short, they’re bad for adults; I would consider it a punishment to sit there.\n\nThe third-row seats themselves, though, are power-folding, with controls to collapse them in both the cargo area and the interior wheel well behind the second row. Given the seats themselves are best suited for occasional use — and are so easy to raise and lower in a pinch — I suspect owners will leave the third row folded most of the time to take advantage of increased space in the second row and cargo area. Then, when the need for extra seating arises, it’ll be easy to accommodate.\n\nFor drivers who need full-time third-row seating, larger options are available, but in the Q7’s size and price range, not all luxury SUVs offer a third row. The X5 doesn’t, and one isn’t standard in the GLE, though it is an option. To the right buyer, the Q7’s third row will be an excellent convenience feature.\n\nNot Cheap\n\nTo get a high level of luxury in a Q7 costs quite a bit. The base price of the four-cylinder 2025 Q7 is $61,795 (all prices include destination fee), but the cheapest V-6 model starts at $67,095. The Prestige version adds a whopping $12,100 to the price of the base V-6 model, but it includes the air suspension, acoustic glass, four-zone automatic climate control, a Bang & Olufsen premium stereo and much, much more.\n\nOur test Q7’s Black Optic Package further added 21-inch wheels and dark exterior accents, and it looked great with the understated Tamarind Brown metallic paint ($595). Four-wheel steering is a stand-alone option for $1,350, and the Q7 also had a premium Bang & Olufsen sound system, which cost an additional $4,900. All told, the sticker price for our test vehicle was $88,790.\n\nWhile the Genesis GV80 and Volvo XC90 undercut the Q7’s starting price, neither vehicle is as luxurious either on the inside or when it comes to the driving experience. A similarly priced BMW X5 xDrive40i is roughly as nice inside, more powerful and more efficient, but it has an overly complex infotainment system and lacks a third row of seats. It’s a similar story with the Mercedes-Benz GLE450, though at least there a third row of seats is an option. In both cases, I’d rather avoid their technology and take the Audi. Its combination of usable tech, a luxurious driving experience and family-friendly utility make the Q7 as good a value as a nearly $90,000 vehicle can be.\n\nIt may be starting to feel long in the tooth, but for the right buyer, the 2025 Audi Q7 still gets everything just right.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The 2020 Audi Q7 occupies an important, family-friendly space in Audi’s lineup. Although it ranks numerically beneath the Q8, the Q7 is the only Audi that seats more than five occupants as Audi’s only three-row SUV. For 2020, it’s been refreshed with rather extensive changes: a brand-new dashboard with a dual-touchscreen setup, a new grille that seems directly lifted from the Q8 and a new turbocharged V-6 that replaces the 2019’s supercharged V-6 as the engine used for the Q7 55 TFSI. A turbo four-cylinder carries over for the base Q7, called the 45 TFSI.\n\nRelated: 2020 Audi Q7: New Screens, New Smile\n\nSuch updates might typify a full redesign, and that gives the 2020 model some serious differentiation from the 2019. Add what’s only a small price increase atop that, and the 2020 Q7 holds real promise. After a few hours behind the wheel, however, I’m not entirely convinced that all such changes are for the better. The Q7 is flashier and the styling more connected to the rest of Audi’s lineup (especially its larger vehicles), but the updates don’t necessarily make it easier to use — and they fail to address some of the SUV’s shortcomings.\n\nNew Engine, New Problems\n\nAlthough the Q7’s available V-6 displaces the same 3.0 liters, it’s now turbocharged instead of supercharged, a change that increases output to 335 horsepower and 369 pounds-feet of torque; that’s up 6 hp and 44 pounds-feet, though Audi’s quoted 0-60-mph acceleration time (5.7 seconds) remains unchanged. All-wheel drive is standard on all trims.\n\nThe previous Q7 suffered some drivetrain lag, and it seems to have worsened with the new engine. Available power is plentiful, and if you apply gas when the transmission is already in the correct gear — such as at lower speeds — the Q7 accelerates impressively for a 5,000-plus-pound SUV. But call for any acceleration while in motion that requires transmission to downshift and it becomes frustrating. Even activating the transmission’s Sport mode doesn’t fix the problem: Hit the gas, and little happens for a couple of seconds before the Q7 downshifts and accelerates. It’s kind of like when my mother used to ask me to do dishes: I’d hear the request but show little interest hastily getting to the task.\n\nOn top of that, fuel economy has substantially dropped. EPA-estimated mileage for the 2020 Q7 is 17/21/18 mpg (city/highway/combined), a significant percentage decline from 2019’s 19/25/21 mpg rating. (Both the V-6 and four-cylinder had the same EPA fuel economy for 2019, but we’re still waiting on figures for the 2020 four-cylinder.) With premium gasoline recommended for advertised power ratings, the drop in mileage hurts all the more.\n\nRide and handling are both adequate. My test vehicle had 21-inch wheels as a part of a cosmetic package, but those didn’t seem to hurt ride quality, which remains confident even over broken pavement. The SUV exhibits a good amount of body roll in corners, and the steering is too low-effort to fully appreciate. Such qualities don’t hold the Q7 back, but I hope Audi’s just-announced SQ7 has some tricks up its sleeve. The Q7 does offer an optional adaptive air suspension, which my test vehicle didn’t have — a setup that could aid steering and dynamics.\n\n2020 Audi Q7 | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\nTouched-Up Interior\n\nThe dashboard has been completely reworked, giving the Q7 what amounts to the Q8 interior. That means physical climate controls are gone, replaced by a lower, 8.6-inch touchscreen that houses controls for the climate and seat temperature among other functions. As a showpiece, the new dashboard and multimedia system look great: The screens are sharp and the whole of it gleams. With a standard 12.3-inch Virtual Cockpit instrument panel, too, the Q7 has a futuristic look and feel.\n\nAudi’s multi-touchscreen approach has divided our staff, and even though I’m among the editors who likes it more, I’m still not sold. It feels cool, but I still prefer physical climate controls, like the ones on the Q3 or refreshed 2020 A4/S4. The haptic feedback you get from Audi’s screen makes it easier to use than the dual touchscreens found in the latest Jaguar and Land Rover models, but it’s still inferior to a good old-fashioned dial — especially when driving and trying to keep your eyes on the road. Both screens become fingerprint magnets; I could see a smudge from every single control that I pressed. In the daylight, those smudges dominate the panel. One final pet peeve: Why is the volume knob so far away? It’s tucked all the way to the passenger side, where it’s neither easy to see nor operate.\n\n3 Rows, 1 of Them Comfortable\n\nThe 2020 Q7 seats seven occupants in all configurations, with a second-row bench seat that cannot be swapped out for captain’s chairs in what continues to be a strange omission. The second row folds in a 35/30/35-split, such that owners can fit three car seats across the bench — an accommodation that puts the Q7 among the handful of new SUVs that can fit three seats across.\n\nThe front seats have enough bolstering to hold occupants comfortably in place, but not so much to be aggressive. The second row is less promising: Outboard seats have minimal bolstering, so you slide around quite a bit. The middle seat, though wider than many, is still not the most comfortable spot to sit in. The cupholders in the center armrest are also tiny; you can maybe fit a soda can in there, but anything larger will have trouble.\n\nThird-row access comes via the sliding and tilting second-row seat. Although the middle seat can be lowered to help open up cargo space, the third row remains problematic in a few different ways. There simply isn’t enough room to fit an adult back there comfortably even if you slide the second-row seat forward. Headroom is lacking, too. Not only does the third row feel like it has dimensional shortcomings, it’s also missing creature comforts, with no visible air vents or USB ports. Versus the third rows in rival SUVs, this feels downright draconian.\n\n2020 Audi Q7 | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\nValue and Final Thoughts\n\nI tested a Premium Plus trim of the 2020 Q7, the middle of three trims — Premium and Prestige are the other two — with V-6 models starting at $61,795 (all prices include destination) and four-cylinder models starting at $55,795. (Under Audi’s newish naming scheme, derived confusingly from the kilowatt-based automotive ratings used in Europe, the four-cylinder goes by 45 TFSI, while the V-6 is 55 TFSI.) Various options packages and features bumped the price of my 55 to $71,990, an echelon that puts the Q7 in close proximity to the Cadillac XT6, Lincoln Aviator and Volvo XC90.\n\nMy lack of enthusiasm for the Q7’s changes may come in part because I’ve seen this show before, just on different Audi models. Audi lifted the Q7’s powertrain, dual-screen setup and styling from other Audis, but I find such changes don’t elevate the Q7’s standing — at least not enough for a vehicle that struggles in some important family qualities, such as third-row space.\n\n\nFurther complicating matters for Q7 shoppers is the arrival of mass-market vehicles with luxury-grade interior quality and more room for occupants and cargo, such as the Hyundai Palisade. The 2020 Q7 is not a bad choice in the traditional sense: Its dynamics are solid, and it still looks and feels the part of a luxury family hauler. But its deficits are impossible to overlook, especially with the new powertrain coming up short.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Redesigned for 2017, the Audi Q7 is a driver’s SUV that emphasizes performance over packaging.\n\nVersus the competition: The Audi Q7 lacks the visual spectacle, plush ride or outright practicality of certain three-row luxury SUVs, but it’s a dynamic, if expensive, alternative.\n\nThe Audi Q7 comes in Premium, Premium Plus and Prestige trim levels, all with seven seats and all-wheel drive. A 2017 version goes on sale in early 2016 after skipping the 2016 model year. Compare the 2015 and 2017 Q7 here. I drove Premium Plus and Prestige versions.\n\nExterior & Styling\nRedesigned after a seeming eternity in its first generation, the new Q7 looks more wagonlike than its predecessor, whose body-heavy profile shared platforms with the Volkswagen Touareg and Porsche Cayenne. (Audi and Porsche both are Volkswagen Group brands.) No longer a sibling of the other two, the 2017 Q7 rides a unique platform and looks less imposing overall — a result of taller glass, lower headlights and a squatter, six-sided grille.\n\nThanks to a lot more aluminum, which is lighter than steel, the Q7 is also about 250 to nearly 500 pounds lighter than its ponderous predecessor, depending which trim you compare. But at 4,938 pounds, the new Q7 is still heavy. (An all-wheel-drive 2016 Acura MDX is some 700 pounds lighter.)\n\nXenon headlights, LED daytime running lights and 19-inch alloy wheels are standard. Full-LED lights are optional, as are 20- and 21-inch rims.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe Audi Q7 boasts decent straight-line performance, and it shines on serious curves — no doubt to the dismay of any kids in back. The SUV’s sole drivetrain as of launch is a 3.0-liter supercharged V6 powertrain that’s good for 333 horsepower. After a moment of initial accelerator lag, it revs strongly and hard. Even with three adults on board, our test car had sufficient reserves to pass slower highway traffic and conquer steep uphill grades. Audi estimates the Q7 hits 60 mph in just 5.7 seconds, a time that rivals many compact sport sedans.\n\nThe Q7’s eight-speed automatic transmission is a plus, shifting smoothly and quickly enough to go unnoticed. In an age where gear-laden transmissions often obstruct performance, an eight-speed that keeps to itself is a good thing.\n\nLike in so many cars, a dashboard button selects from a few modes that vary driving characteristics. The sportiest mode, Dynamic, cuts a lot of power-steering assist and introduces much sharper accelerator progression, though the initial lag persists. Still, if you barrel around hairpin turns in Dynamic mode, the Q7 excels. The steering is direct and lively, the chassis charges through corners with little body roll, and the tires — chunky Goodyear Eagle Sport P285/45R20 all-seasons on our test cars — have carlike grip. The brakes deliver fade-free stopping power all day long, and the transmission resists any untimely shifts heading into corners. Coming out of the corner, the engine’s broad torque curve (325 pounds-feet from 2,900 to 5,300 rpm) hustles the Q7 back up to speed even if you’re a gear too high.\n\nWe’ll need to test a Q7 on rougher roads to issue a final verdict on ride quality, but my early impression is that the SUV’s standard suspension with conventional steel springs is firm but livable. It’s not choppy, as the similarly configured 2016 Volvo XC90 can be. The Q7’s base 19-inch wheels have higher-profile tires (P255/55R19s), which could soften ride quality, as well.\n\nShoppers who want more ride comfort should consider the Q7’s optional adaptive air suspension, which eliminates some of the bounciness over rapid elevation changes and improves general isolation. It makes for a refined experience that complements the SUV’s overall quietness. For outright comfort, though, the XC90’s optional — and exceptional — air suspension has Audi beat.\n\nIf you want more comfort without stepping up to an air suspension, the Acura MDX, Buick Enclave and Infiniti QX60 all ride on the softer side.\n\nTowing capacity is now 7,700 pounds when equipped with a $550 tow package, up 1,100 pounds versus the prior Q7. EPA-rated certification is still pending as of this writing, but Audi estimates the Q7 will get 21 mpg fuel economy in combined city/highway driving, with premium gas recommended but not required. That’s generally competitive with the segment, though if you don’t need all-wheel drive, a front-drive MDX gets as high as 23 mpg combined.\n\nInterior\nThe Audi Q7’s layered dashboard is free of clutter, with a thin multimedia screen that motors out of the center. The only stylistic head-scratcher is a continuous band of air vents that span the passenger side — optionally functional to blow diffuse air, at least. Build quality is up to Audi snuff, with consistent graining down to foot level and sufficient padding in areas where your arms and elbows rest. It’s an area where a few other Audi models still cheap out.\n\nHeated leather seats with powered front-seat adjustments are standard. Front-seat coolers and massagers are optional. The chairs have good adjustment range and a decent grade of leather, and you can swap it out for more-premium cowhide with an optional Luxury package that also wraps lower portions of the doors and center console in leather.\n\nThe second row has good seating height and headroom, though a large center floor hump limits footwell space. Legroom ranges from acceptable to good, depending on where you position the sliding second row. With those seats all the way back, the third row is essentially a technicality; second-row passengers will need to give up a few inches for anyone to really sit back there. Either way, third-row headroom is tight, and accessing the seat requires a two-step tumbling process for the second-row chairs that’s neither intuitive nor low-effort. Competitors such as the MDX and QX60 have tilt-and-slide third-row access, and the Buick Enclave’s captain’s chairs leave a center aisle. So while the Q7’s third row is standard, it’s a packaging afterthought.\n\nA panoramic moonroof is standard. Three-zone automatic climate control is standard; available quad-zone climate gives the second row its own left/right zones.\n\nCargo & Storage\nCabin storage is modest, with an open tray near the cupholders but a shallow center console. Open the standard power liftgate and the Audi Q7’s power-folding third row drops in a 50/50-split to create a flat load floor. The second row folds in a 35/30/35 split. Space behind the third row is a modest 14.8 cubic feet; if you drop all the seats, maximum volume totals 71.6 cubic feet. Those are competitive figures, but if you really need to load up the gear, the Enclave’s vast interior is superior: There’s a deep 23.3 cubic feet of cargo space behind the third row that’s expandable to a maximum 115.2 cubic feet.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe new Audi Q7’s center screen (7 inches standard, 8.3 inches optional) augments a 7-inch display between the gauges, but technophiles will want Audi’s optional “virtual cockpit” — a 12.3-inch display that replaces the gauges altogether. Historically, simulated gauges have aged poorly because screen resolutions have continually improved in competing vehicles, but Audi’s virtual cockpit is quite high-res by today’s standards, and its functionality justifies the layout. The display can shrink and simplify the gauges to prioritize other displays, from multimedia sources to the navigation map. The map itself comes complete with Google Earth satellite imagery via the Q7’s subscription-based 4G LTE Wi-Fi service, and Audi says the images will remain — though they won’t update — even if you don’t pay the subscription after the free six-month period runs out.\n\nYou can switch up the virtual cockpit displays via steering-wheel controls or Audi’s MMI controller, which adds an optional touchpad with clickable areas for radio presets and menu shortcuts. The pad has pinch-and-swipe functionality for zooming and surfing, and the motions are seamless.\n\nStill, not everything else works in a jiffy. Certain submenus have inconsistent load times that can last as long as several seconds. At one point, our test car showed a full satellite-image map in the virtual cockpit display but a missing map on the dashboard display, which went on for several minutes. Audi’s integration of Apple CarPlay and Android Auto — systems designed for touch-screens — has clear limitations with the knob-based MMI approach. The finger pad doesn’t help: CarPlay’s Apple Maps ditches its pinch-and-swipe capabilities for old-school direction and zoom keys, but Audi officials were quick to blame the limited usability on Apple.\n\nBluetooth phone and audio streaming are standard. A midlevel Bose premium stereo is optional. The range-topping stereo, a Bang & Olufsen 3D surround-sound system, costs an eye-watering $5,000.\n\nSafety\nAs of this writing, the Audi Q7 has yet to be crash-tested. A backup camera is standard. Audi’s standard Pre Sense City system provides collision warning and emergency braking from 6 to 50 mph if it senses any obstructions, including pedestrians. An optional Pre Sense Plus Package extends the threshold to 137 mph.\n\nThe accident avoidance systems go on: Adaptive cruise control, and an exit-warning system flashes a red light near the inside door handle if you begin to open it while sensors detect an approaching vehicle or cyclist. Other systems automatically hit the brakes if you try to make a left turn in front of oncoming traffic or back into a lane of cross-traffic.\n\nEvery seating position in the second and third row has its own Latch anchors and top tethers. Side-impact torso airbags for the second row are optional. See a full list of safety features here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe Audi Q7 has one thing in common with other three-row European luxury SUVs: It’s expensive. Including destination, a Q7 Premium starts around $56,000. The Premium Plus, which Audi expects to be the most popular trim, starts around $60,000. That’s in the neighborhood of average transaction prices for the XC90 and X5, but it’s a $10,000-plus climb versus Audi’s Japanese and American competition.\n\nPrices only escalate from there. The Q7 Prestige runs just over $65,000, and if you throw in Bang & Olufsen audio, the extended-leather luxury package, the adaptive air suspension and more, the SUV can top out close to $90,000. Audi says it eventually will introduce a Q7 2.0T to round out the entry-level side, and it also plans to reprise its diesel V-6 once it resolves the current diesel crisis — which, as of this writing, is still a long way from being resolved.\n\nValue is not a Q7 strength, at least for now. But luxury SUV shoppers don’t seem fazed by the European price premium. Shoppers have bought about as many BMW X5 SUVs as they have Acura MDXs, and the redesigned — and expensive — XC90 is now Volvo’s sales leader. The Q7 isn’t the dramatic must-drive redesign that Audi may have hoped for, but it’s a worthy option for family shoppers who like to drive.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Audi Q7?\n\nThe Audi Q7 is the German luxury brand’s largest SUV. It comes standard with a 261-horsepower, turbocharged four-cylinder engine, all-wheel drive and room for up to seven people in three rows. A mild-hybrid system aids the Q7’s fuel efficiency, but this SUV’s standout feature is the design and quality of its elegant cabin. A 335-hp, turbocharged V-6 is optional, with a 500-hp, twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 in the high-performance SQ7 variant. If you need to haul lots of people and are constantly in a hurry, this could be the luxury SUV for you. The Q7’s rivals include the BMW X7, Genesis GV80, Lincoln Aviator, Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class and Volvo XC90.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Audi Q7?\n\nA new 261-hp, turbocharged mild-hybrid four-cylinder provides a 13-hp boost over the outgoing standard powertrain. Other changes are mostly related to trim and feature shuffling: Adaptive cruise control with lane departure steering assist is now included with the Convenience Package, and LED matrix headlights are optional on the mid-range Premium Plus trim and standard on range-topping Prestige. Two new 22-inch alloy-wheel designs are available.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Audi Q7 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n1-inch infotainment screen\n6-inch climate control screen\nPower liftgate\nPanoramic moonroof\nLeather seating\nHeated front seats\nAudi Virtual Cockpit with 12.3-inch digital instrument panel\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nNavigation\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nBang & Olufsen stereo\n360-degree camera system\nAdaptive air suspension\nSoft-closing doors\nVentilated front seats\nFour-zone climate control\nHeated steering wheel\nAdaptive cruise control\nShould I Buy the 2023 Audi Q7?\n\nThe Audi Q7 is a premium SUV that blends respectable agility with all-season grip thanks to standard Quattro all-wheel drive. The base four-cylinder is reasonably peppy and fuel-efficient, though it lacks the punch some expect in an SUV starting around $60,000. The optional turbo V-6 has both lively acceleration and some noticeable lag when you punch the gas pedal. Impeccable cabin quality is one of the Q7’s main attractions; everything looks and feels top-notch. Having a third row of seats is convenient, even if it’s best suited for kids.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2022 Audi Q7?\n\nThe Audi Q7 is the German luxury brand’s largest SUV, with three rows of seats for up to seven people. All-wheel drive and an eight-speed automatic transmission are standard. Engine choices range from a 248-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder to a 500-hp, twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8, which is found in the high-performance SQ7. Competitors include the Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class, BMW X5 and Lincoln Aviator.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2022 Audi Q7?\n\nRear-seat side-impact airbags and power-folding heated side mirrors are now standard. \n\nWhat Features in the 2022 Audi Q7 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nLED headlights with high-beam assist\n19-inch wheels\nKeyless access with push-button start\nPower liftgate\nPanoramic moonroof\nLeather upholstery\nHeated front seats\nAudi Virtual Cockpit with 12.3-inch digital instrument panel\nDual-touchscreen control system\nWireless Apple CarPlay and wired Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nNavigation\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure warning\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nBang & Olufsen stereo\n360-degree camera system\nAdaptive air suspension\nSoft-closing doors\nVentilated front seats\nFour-zone automatic air conditioning\nHeated steering wheel\nAdaptive cruise control \nShould I Buy the 2022 Audi Q7?\n\nThe Audi Q7 is a capable and refined luxury SUV that delivers impressive interior quality with high-tech touches. The third-row seat is nice to have in a pinch, but it’s best left to kids. We also noticed some body roll when cornering, as well as acceleration lag from the available V-6 drivetrain.",

      "expert_review": "The 2020 Audi Q7 occupies an important, family-friendly space in Audi’s lineup. Although it ranks numerically beneath the Q8, the Q7 is the only Audi that seats more than five occupants as Audi’s only three-row SUV. For 2020, it’s been refreshed with rather extensive changes: a brand-new dashboard with a dual-touchscreen setup, a new grille that seems directly lifted from the Q8 and a new turbocharged V-6 that replaces the 2019’s supercharged V-6 as the engine used for the Q7 55 TFSI. A turbo four-cylinder carries over for the base Q7, called the 45 TFSI.\n\nRelated: 2020 Audi Q7: New Screens, New Smile\n\nSuch updates might typify a full redesign, and that gives the 2020 model some serious differentiation from the 2019. Add what’s only a small price increase atop that, and the 2020 Q7 holds real promise. After a few hours behind the wheel, however, I’m not entirely convinced that all such changes are for the better. The Q7 is flashier and the styling more connected to the rest of Audi’s lineup (especially its larger vehicles), but the updates don’t necessarily make it easier to use — and they fail to address some of the SUV’s shortcomings.\n\nNew Engine, New Problems\n\nAlthough the Q7’s available V-6 displaces the same 3.0 liters, it’s now turbocharged instead of supercharged, a change that increases output to 335 horsepower and 369 pounds-feet of torque; that’s up 6 hp and 44 pounds-feet, though Audi’s quoted 0-60-mph acceleration time (5.7 seconds) remains unchanged. All-wheel drive is standard on all trims.\n\nThe previous Q7 suffered some drivetrain lag, and it seems to have worsened with the new engine. Available power is plentiful, and if you apply gas when the transmission is already in the correct gear — such as at lower speeds — the Q7 accelerates impressively for a 5,000-plus-pound SUV. But call for any acceleration while in motion that requires transmission to downshift and it becomes frustrating. Even activating the transmission’s Sport mode doesn’t fix the problem: Hit the gas, and little happens for a couple of seconds before the Q7 downshifts and accelerates. It’s kind of like when my mother used to ask me to do dishes: I’d hear the request but show little interest hastily getting to the task.\n\nOn top of that, fuel economy has substantially dropped. EPA-estimated mileage for the 2020 Q7 is 17/21/18 mpg (city/highway/combined), a significant percentage decline from 2019’s 19/25/21 mpg rating. (Both the V-6 and four-cylinder had the same EPA fuel economy for 2019, but we’re still waiting on figures for the 2020 four-cylinder.) With premium gasoline recommended for advertised power ratings, the drop in mileage hurts all the more.\n\nRide and handling are both adequate. My test vehicle had 21-inch wheels as a part of a cosmetic package, but those didn’t seem to hurt ride quality, which remains confident even over broken pavement. The SUV exhibits a good amount of body roll in corners, and the steering is too low-effort to fully appreciate. Such qualities don’t hold the Q7 back, but I hope Audi’s just-announced SQ7 has some tricks up its sleeve. The Q7 does offer an optional adaptive air suspension, which my test vehicle didn’t have — a setup that could aid steering and dynamics.\n\n2020 Audi Q7 | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\nTouched-Up Interior\n\nThe dashboard has been completely reworked, giving the Q7 what amounts to the Q8 interior. That means physical climate controls are gone, replaced by a lower, 8.6-inch touchscreen that houses controls for the climate and seat temperature among other functions. As a showpiece, the new dashboard and multimedia system look great: The screens are sharp and the whole of it gleams. With a standard 12.3-inch Virtual Cockpit instrument panel, too, the Q7 has a futuristic look and feel.\n\nAudi’s multi-touchscreen approach has divided our staff, and even though I’m among the editors who likes it more, I’m still not sold. It feels cool, but I still prefer physical climate controls, like the ones on the Q3 or refreshed 2020 A4/S4. The haptic feedback you get from Audi’s screen makes it easier to use than the dual touchscreens found in the latest Jaguar and Land Rover models, but it’s still inferior to a good old-fashioned dial — especially when driving and trying to keep your eyes on the road. Both screens become fingerprint magnets; I could see a smudge from every single control that I pressed. In the daylight, those smudges dominate the panel. One final pet peeve: Why is the volume knob so far away? It’s tucked all the way to the passenger side, where it’s neither easy to see nor operate.\n\n3 Rows, 1 of Them Comfortable\n\nThe 2020 Q7 seats seven occupants in all configurations, with a second-row bench seat that cannot be swapped out for captain’s chairs in what continues to be a strange omission. The second row folds in a 35/30/35-split, such that owners can fit three car seats across the bench — an accommodation that puts the Q7 among the handful of new SUVs that can fit three seats across.\n\nThe front seats have enough bolstering to hold occupants comfortably in place, but not so much to be aggressive. The second row is less promising: Outboard seats have minimal bolstering, so you slide around quite a bit. The middle seat, though wider than many, is still not the most comfortable spot to sit in. The cupholders in the center armrest are also tiny; you can maybe fit a soda can in there, but anything larger will have trouble.\n\nThird-row access comes via the sliding and tilting second-row seat. Although the middle seat can be lowered to help open up cargo space, the third row remains problematic in a few different ways. There simply isn’t enough room to fit an adult back there comfortably even if you slide the second-row seat forward. Headroom is lacking, too. Not only does the third row feel like it has dimensional shortcomings, it’s also missing creature comforts, with no visible air vents or USB ports. Versus the third rows in rival SUVs, this feels downright draconian.\n\n2020 Audi Q7 | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\nValue and Final Thoughts\n\nI tested a Premium Plus trim of the 2020 Q7, the middle of three trims — Premium and Prestige are the other two — with V-6 models starting at $61,795 (all prices include destination) and four-cylinder models starting at $55,795. (Under Audi’s newish naming scheme, derived confusingly from the kilowatt-based automotive ratings used in Europe, the four-cylinder goes by 45 TFSI, while the V-6 is 55 TFSI.) Various options packages and features bumped the price of my 55 to $71,990, an echelon that puts the Q7 in close proximity to the Cadillac XT6, Lincoln Aviator and Volvo XC90.\n\nMy lack of enthusiasm for the Q7’s changes may come in part because I’ve seen this show before, just on different Audi models. Audi lifted the Q7’s powertrain, dual-screen setup and styling from other Audis, but I find such changes don’t elevate the Q7’s standing — at least not enough for a vehicle that struggles in some important family qualities, such as third-row space.\n\n\nFurther complicating matters for Q7 shoppers is the arrival of mass-market vehicles with luxury-grade interior quality and more room for occupants and cargo, such as the Hyundai Palisade. The 2020 Q7 is not a bad choice in the traditional sense: Its dynamics are solid, and it still looks and feels the part of a luxury family hauler. But its deficits are impossible to overlook, especially with the new powertrain coming up short.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe Q7 was Audi’s first foray into the luxury crossover segment, but since its debut the automaker has added the Q5, a smaller and less expensive crossover. The Q7 seats up to seven people in three rows of seats and can be equipped with a gas or diesel V-6. The Q7 competes with the BMW X5, Mercedes-Benz GL-Class and Acura MDX.\n\nNew for 2012\nThe supercharged 3.0-liter V-6 that powers the Q7 3.0T gains eight horsepower and is now rated at 280 hp. A new S Line Plus Package for Prestige models features 21-inch titanium-finished wheels and matte black roof rails and window surrounds. Meanwhile, the optional navigation system adds Audi Connect capability that includes Google Earth map functionality and Wi-Fi hotspot capability.\n\nExterior\nFor a crossover, the Q7 has a relatively sleek profile, and it wears Audi’s signature snout-like grille. Adaptive xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights with LED daytime running lights and a panoramic sunroof are optional. Exterior features include:\n\n\nStandard power liftgate\n18-, 19-, 20- or 21-inch wheels\n\nInterior\nThe Q7’s rear rows of seats fold flat to provide additional storage space.

      "expert_review": "Snowstorms are what we live for at the Globe. Our metro staff gets to ask travelers trapped at Logan Airport how their day is going. Our photographers snap people falling on ice, and if there’s a Pats game, the sports writers watch it from heated, refreshment-filled box seats.\n\nOver in the automotive section, we’re out with the plows, trying to sort the wannabe winter cars and trucks (any Jaguar or unladen pickup) from the truly great ones (hint: they’re not just Subarus).\n\nMy storm trooper during the day-after-Christmas blizzard was Audi’s seven-passenger Q7, equipped in TDI trim with its 3.0-liter turbodiesel V-6. Ordinarily, it’s a delightful car to slog through snow.\n\nThe quattro all-wheel-drive, paired with a hefty set of 20-inch winter Dunlops, routed power so seamlessly that sometimes I was unaware I was slipping in the first place. The 406 lb.-ft of torque got this rig to speed in no time, and the 8-speed automatic kept everything hush-hush. The front seats offered six levels of heat, and the four-zone climate control kept my parents and girlfriend comfortable while the wipers iced up from the freezing bursts of wind on I-91.\n\nSo what, with its stability and slick, Tron-like LED headlamp accents, kept the Q7 from being the easy foul-weather cruiser it should be?\n\nWell, I did, when I knocked the wiper off, that’s what.\n\nMy girlfriend argued I shouldn’t have pulled on a moving wiper. But she’s from south Texas, and the wiper flick is a pretty standard, albeit crude, procedure in the Northeast. When ice sticks to the blade and no longer wipes the glass clean, you reach your arm out and lift the blade when it sweeps near, slapping the ice off without having to pull over.\n\nBut on the third try, the Q7’s wiper snapped in two. Being German, it was impossible to reattach like a normal wiper, forcing me into a gangster-lean the rest of the drive home.\n\nMost wipers stand these flicks without fail. But the Audi wipers are a two-piece design. Instead of the blade attaching to the wiper arm, this one slides into a plastic strap that hangs limply off the arm, and it’s secured together with two clamps. This makes for mighty wiping in regular conditions since the base of the arms pivot, allowing the blades to flex and sweep a wider angle. What I wouldn’t have given for our $71,800 Audi to have instead offered wiper deicers on the base of the windshield, like those on a $26,000 Hyundai Tucson.\n\nMaybe I should have kept my hand in the car. After all, this is a vehicle over-engineered to the point where Bang & Olufsen tweeters rise out of the dash and the navigation system renders the Boston Globe building down to the Gothic letters on the wall.\n\nEven the glovebox doesn’t open like a glovebox. Like in Jaguars, the locking mechanism is electronic, just like the fussy automatic towel dispensers in public bathrooms that have you waving your wet hands around like an idiot. The Audi box trapped my dad’s phone inside and wouldn’t budge until he pressed the open switch (an obscure icon to the right of the LCD monitor) about 30 times. Then the glovebox wouldn’t close another dozen or so times, even after emptying it.\n\nSurely, those all-in-one HVAC knobs that control temperature, 12 fan speeds, 9 fan directions, and the heated and cooled seats will be more reliable? And the myriad of vehicle configurations buried within menus and submenus of the MMI system will hold up? Maybe there’s a reason Audi programmed every service department in the country into the GPS.\n\nAll this doesn’t erode the Q7’s worthy drive, however. Like all Audis, the chassis feels forged from a solid block of steel (though at a belt-popping 5,567 pounds, it should be from an aluminum block like the A8). The interior isn’t as intuitive as the Porsche Cayenne’s, but it’s all very handsome, high-quality, and well-lit. The panoramic sunroof turns the Q7 into a rolling greenhouse, and handling and ride quality are exemplary for such a large vehicle.\n\nLike nearly every big SUV, the Q7 sits atop an optional air suspension that keeps the body level, offers height adjustment, and tailors firmness to the driver’s style. It’s not as off-road pretentious as the Range Rover — nor would it be as capable — but the Q7’s shocks deliver a creamy ride with minimal brake dive and body roll. The quick steering seems to shrink the Q7 down to Q5-size, especially when parking. Many midsize sedans don’t handle and steer this well.\n\nWhile I saw an indicated 30-mpg average on the highway, the diesel’s low-end torque and fuel savings are exhausted by the excess weight. The EPA 17/25 rating of the TDI is barely higher than that of the two supercharged gasoline models, at 16/22. That problem should be left to Porsche, now under Audi corporate, which cut a whopping 408 pounds off its new Cayenne.\n\nIf Audi does that to the next Q7, it’ll have a seven-seat segment leader. Let’s hope they add a few pounds to the wipers.\n\n2011 Audi Q7 TDI\n\nTHE BASICS\nPrice, base/as tested (with destination): $50,900 / $71,800\nFuel economy, EPA estimated: 17 city/25 highway\nFuel economy, Globe observed: 20 mpg\nDrivetrain: 3.0-liter turbodiesel V-6, 8-speed automatic, front-engine, all-wheel-drive\nBody: 4-door, 7-passenger SUV\n\nTHE SPECIFICS\nHorsepower: 225 @ 3,750 rpm\nTorque: 406 ft.-lbs @ 1,750 rpm\nOverall length: 200.3 inches\nWheelbase: 118.2 inches\nHeight: 68.4 inches\nWidth: 85.7 inches (with mirrors)\nCurb weight: 5,567 pounds\n\nTHE GOOD\nStyle, ride, traction, and powertrain are top of the class\n\nTHE BAD\nToo heavy to realize diesel benefits, questionable electronics and ergonomics\n\nTHE BOTTOM LINE\nA good SUV that tries too hard to be great.\n\nALSO CONSIDER\nMercedes-Benz G350 BlueTEC, Cadillac Escalade, Infiniti QX56, Lexus LX 570, Lincoln MKT",

      "expert_review": "An interesting thing happened to me while reviewing cars over the past year. I’ve discovered I need far less car than I thought I did. Last year, I reviewed the 2008 Audi Q7 and decided that it was my fantasy mommy-mobile. You can imagine how excited I was to get into the clean-diesel version of the 2009 Q7; I counted down the days until the car arrived. While I still think it’s about the best three-row SUV on the planet, I’ve realized that a three-row SUV is more car than I really need.\n\nMy kids are getting older, and airbag sensors mean I can safely put my 9-year-old in the front seat when I absolutely have to, which leaves room for three kids in the second row. I rarely need that third row. During my test week in the Q7, which is a seven-seater, I didn’t even put the third row up until it was time to take pictures. I enjoyed the cargo space, instead.\n\nNow don’t get me wrong. I still loved getting into the Q7 every morning, and I pointed out this good-looking SUV to everyone I met. I made the other moms around school come check it out, and I sang its clean-diesel praises. Thanks to new diesel technology and a special additive to the gas tank, the Q7’s TDI engine emissions are reduced by a staggering 90 percent, and the Q7 TDI gets an EPA-estimated 17/25 mpg city/highway, with standard all-wheel drive.\n\nThe Q7 TDI has great power with none of that diesel lag from days of yore. The 221-horsepower V-6 isn’t exactly quick off the line, but it has a steadier acceleration that speaks of strength. The engine noise is deeper and throatier than in the gas-powered Q7, but it’s not that obnoxious thumping I remember from old diesel cars. In fact, it’s only noticeable if you’re listening for it. The ride feels somehow truckier than I recall in last year’s gas model. I’m not sure if that’s faulty memory on my part or if the diesel model rides differently. Either way, the ride is somewhere between sedan and SUV, with some body roll in the turns but very little bounce over bumps.\n\nI’m not the only one who loved the Q7. My kids swore it was the “comfiest car ever” and wanted to know if we could buy one. Sorry, kiddos, but $62,375 for my test car is out of our price range.\n\nExterior\n\nThe Q7 TDI is elegant and classy. It looks rich and expensive, which it should since it is. The lines are clean and smooth, with no sharp edges or weird bulges.\n\nThe front of the Q7 is dominated by the large black grille. A thin strip of chrome surrounds the grille and the chromed rings of Audi’s badge seem to float in the middle. The angled headlights and thin strip of fog lights below sit at the very outside corners, but don’t stick out. They flow with the angle of the hood and fender. Rain-sensing wipers sit below the sightline of the hood.\n\nFrom the side, the Q7 doesn’t look like an SUV at all. Without something to compare it to for size, it might be mistaken for a wagon or crossover. Only the large doors give away its true size. The 20-inch rims on my test vehicle are just the right size, proportionally speaking, and the five-spoke alloy wheels are perfectly understated. Another thin strip of chrome wraps around the windows. The door handles and molding is body colored. While my test car had huge “TDI Clean Diesel” stickers on it, they won’t be on your Q7 TDI, if you choose to buy one.\n\nI had no problems getting in and out of the Q7, and a flat step-in area made the climb a bit easier for little legs. But the Q7’s heavy doors can be a challenge.\n\nIn the rear, the shaped taillights interrupt what would otherwise be a fairly angular view. The large rear window gives good visibility that’s complemented by an optional backup camera with guidelines on the screen as well as a parking sensors.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Excellent\n\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Groove-On\n\nInterior\n\nThe interior of the Q7 TDI is classic Audi. The black leather flows into the black-colored dash and controls. It seems minimalist, but it’s chock full of luxury. The leather is buttery soft; the seats are super-comfy and easy to adjust. The controls are all within reach.\n\nAudi’s Multi Media Interface runs the climate control, navigation system and audio system through a knob controller. It’s not the easiest system I’ve ever used, but it’s definitely not the most complicated, either. The gauges are easy to read, and the steering-wheel-mounted controls make it even easier to keep your hands on the wheel. My test vehicle had the TDI S Line Package ($1,200), which, in addition to the larger wheels, gave me the sport steering wheel with perforated leather wrapping, contrast color stitching and paddle shifters that I never used.\n\nStorage is adequate, but not abundant in the front seats. There’s one ready cupholder and another beneath an armrest. The center console bin is on the small side and sits above a compartment for electronics. This allows you to plug in an MP3 player and keep it and its cords out of sight. I liked that part of the setup, but I would have preferred accessible storage even more. There are bins under the seats and the door pockets are good-sized, but I had nowhere to stash my pack of wipes. Trust me; you want me to bring those wipes along. They came in handy when my kid knocked my coffee out of the cupholder.\n\nThe backseat was a big hit with my backseat test drivers. They loved the comfy seats and the height-adjustable seatbelts that allowed my 6.5-year-old to ride without his booster seat. Oh, the freedom! A four-zone climate control system let everyone choose their own definition of room temperature. But my guys’ favorite feature was the massive panoramic roof with the power sunshade that they could control from the backseat. There are cupholders in the second row’s armrest and bottleholders in the doors.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore\n\nSafety\n\nThere’s a reason the Audi Q7 TDI gets such good safety ratings. Well, actually, there are many reasons, including the antilock braking system with brake assist, electronic stability control and traction control. Daytime running lights keep the Q7 visible to oncoming traffic, and Audi Side Assist uses radar to monitor your blind spots and warn you of cars hiding there.\n\nThen there are the airbags. The Q7 TDI has front- and side-impact airbags for the front row, with a front passenger airbag occupancy sensor that only deploys the airbag if a passenger is in the seat and is large enough to benefit from the airbag. There also are side curtain airbags in all three rows. For the second row, optional side-impact airbags cost $350.\n\nThe Q7 has Audi’s fabulous Latches that are in plain sight, with no searching or digging required. There are four sets of Latch connectors, with two sets each in the second and third rows. Four child-safety seats can be easily installed, without a curse or a grumble. Yay!\n\nThe second-row seats slide fore and aft, so the front passenger won’t have to sit with his knees up his nose when a rear-facing infant-safety seat is installed in the second row. The third row is less friendly to car seats; its Latch connectors are slightly buried and the legroom is limited, but the sliding second row helps with that, too.\n\nFAMILY LIFESTAGE\n\nIn Diapers: Uber-easy Latch connectors make for no-hassle child-safety-seat installation.\n\nIn School: Easy-to-buckle seat belts should keep the second and third rows free from whining. At least for awhile.\n\nTeens: The safety features should ease parents worries when a teen driver gets behind the wheel.",

      "expert_review": "Many automakers abandoned their diesel plans in recent years as new-car sales tanked and diesel prices rose. Audi, however, has kept its diesel promises, which include a TDI clean-diesel version of its Q7 SUV, introduced in 2009.\n\nThe Q7 is a great fit for a diesel power plant; its excellent highway mileage is far above that of the gasoline Q7, plus the hefty SUV gets around easily with its massive amounts of diesel torque.\n\nThat said, though, while Audi has executed the Q7 diesel well, I’m not 100 percent convinced that diesel power is the way to go for every suburban family looking for a luxury SUV.\n\nFor 2010, the Q7 has Audi’s signature, eye-catching LED running lights available. As previous-model-year Q7 drivers passed me going the opposite direction, most gazed jealously at the 2010. Yes, the lights are that noticeable, and yes, they look that cool. To see the 2009 and 2010 Q7 compared, click here. To see our review of the 2009 Audi Q7 TDI, go here.\n\nTDI Pros and Cons\nSo why offer a diesel engine in a family SUV? The TDI has the highest mileage ratings in the Q7 lineup at 17/25 mpg city/highway. That’s better than the gasoline six-cylinder (14/19 mpg) and eight-cylinder (13/18) offerings, but it’s not tops among luxury SUVs. The 2010 BMW X5 with a diesel engine is rated higher, at 19/26 mpg, and Mercedes-Benz’s ML 350 BlueTEC is comparable at 18/25 mpg. Mercedes’ larger GL 350 BlueTEC rates lower, at 17/23 mpg.\n\nDiesel engines typically log their best fuel economy during highway driving. I pulled off higher-than-advertised mileage while cruising at around 45-55 mph, when 30 mpg was a familiar sight on the trip computer’s instantaneous mileage readout.\n\nFor those who don’t drive on the highway, the Q7 diesel’s appeal seems limited, considering its city mileage was never really impressive. Also, at 6,600 pounds, the maximum towing capacity isn’t any higher with the diesel than with a gasoline engine, though I suspect the towing experience would be different — possibly easier — with the diesel’s generous torque.\n\nAt the time I tested the Q7, diesel wasn’t any cheaper than gasoline. In fact, it was 25 cents more per gallon than regular, and equal to filling up with premium. The gasoline six-cylinder Q7 takes premium. Fueleconomy.gov estimates the annual fuel cost of the diesel Q7 to be $2,235 per year; the gasoline six-cylinder will cost $2,794 per year to fill up; and the eight-cylinder is projected to cost $2,981.\n\nWhen it was time to fill up in my area — a large Chicago suburb — diesel stations weren’t along my normal commute. Having to go out of my way for go-go juice was another knock against the TDI. Again, this is situational; if you have a diesel station around the corner, then going diesel may be an easier transition. Even though I was driving in familiar areas, I quickly discovered I had no idea which stations carried diesel. Thankfully, Q7s equipped with the optional navigation system simplify the process with a diesel-station locator.\n\nThen there are the little things about diesel ownership to consider — like, once you get to the station, you may be forced to sit in line behind a string of heavy-duty landscaping trucks, like I did. Oh, and you should also carry moist towelettes with you because diesel is very oily, and filling up often means leaving the pump a little dirtier than you were when you pulled in. And you don’t want to bring nozzle grease back into the Q7’s nice interior.\n\nDiesel Driving\nDriving the diesel was a joy most of the time. It has just 221 horsepower, but that number isn’t as important as the whopping 406 pounds-feet of torque, which moved the Q7 along effortlessly. I would actually call the diesel Q7 fun to drive — it’s at least fun to mash the accelerator pedal — if it weren’t for the inconsistent feeling of power. Sometimes when I goosed the car it accelerated almost surprisingly fast, and other times it would just fall on its face, feeling like a much less powerful vehicle.\n\nTo me, it felt like the six-speed automatic transmission could have kicked down another gear, but sometimes it just held the gear and slowly pulled away.\n\nInterior & Cargo\nFor a three-row, seven-seat SUV, the Q7’s interior is on the smaller side, with only 104 cubic feet of passenger volume and 72.5 cubic feet of total cargo space. The small size is most apparent behind the third row, where there’s minimal cargo room. Plus, the third row itself is best suited for children. I’ll admit I’ve said that a lot when evaluating third rows, but it’s especially true in the Q7. I can typically fit in the third row of most vehicles and be OK for a short trip, but not in the Q7. At 6 feet tall, I couldn’t fit in the third row at all because of the extremely limited leg and headroom.\n\nOur tester was loaded with options that gave some parts of the interior a very classy feel. The available Alcantara faux-suede headliner is something we don’t see very often, but it’s super ritzy when plastered across the ceiling. It was probably the nicest piece on the inside, considering that the steering wheel, door panels and dashboard materials weren’t anything special for an SUV that costs $76,000, as-tested.\n\nI’m not saying the pieces looked cheap, but the 2011 Infiniti QX56 I recently drove put the Q7’s interior to shame. Every last piece on the inside of the QX’s interior was covered in leather: dashboard, center console, armrests, etc. The QX56 we drove was also less expensive, as tested, and immensely roomier in the second and third rows than the Q7. The QX56 has 174 cubic feet of passenger volume and 112.6 cubic feet of maximum cargo room, dwarfing the Q7.\n\nWhere the Q7 has its advantage is in its low-slung ride height, which provides easy entry, easy exit and easy cargo loading. With the optional air suspension, it can also be lowered closer to the ground for easier access, a function that can be controlled from either the control center up front or via buttons in the cargo area. Even at my height, I found the QX56 to be awkward to get into and out of because of its high ride height.\n\nFeatures\nYou name it and the Q7 will likely have that feature available — which is why the price racks up so easily. To start off, all-wheel drive is standard. There’s an available adaptive air suspension with different ride height and firmness options, though the Q7 seemed to ride on the firm side regardless of suspension setting and didn’t have much cushioning over rough roads. The adaptive suspension costs $2,600 but also requires adding an expensive Prestige Package that costs a whopping $10,000.\n\nIncluded in that package is a panoramic sunroof with a massive front window pane. Even the rear glass section pops up to a vent mode for rear passengers; most panoramic sunroofs offer fixed glass there.\n\nThe Prestige Package also equips the Q7 with Audi’s side-assist blind spot monitoring system and navigation system.\n\nMore options on our tester included a Warm Weather Package with four-zone climate control for the first and second rows; a Cold Weather Package with heated rear seats and a heated steering wheel; and a Luxury Package with the aforementioned Alcantara headliner and ventilated front seats. It’s quite the list, and altogether it bumps the Q7’s price up to just under $76,000. A federal diesel tax credit of $1,150 helps offset that cost a little, dropping the base MSRP of a Q7 diesel from $50,900 to $49,750.\n\nA Bangin’ Good Time\nI could easily forget about the diesel engine, Alcantara headliner, dynamic suspension and any other feature, though, because the optional Bang & Olufsen stereo was by far the most impressive option on the Q7. If you’re any kind of sound junkie or music lover, this stereo is worth the coin. Some may scoff at its $6,300 price, but on top of a $50,000 starting price, I wouldn’t think twice about checking this box.\n\nIt didn’t matter what type of music I piped through the speakers — the stereo filled every bit of space with rich sounds. It never felt like just a few of the speakers were doing the work, but that all of them were working together to make it one of the most enjoyable music experiences I’ve had in a car.\n\nAudi Q7 in the Market\nHaving the diesel option gives Audi shoppers an alternative for great gas mileage, but it can’t escape the drawbacks that affect all diesel-powered new cars. Until diesel prices become more reasonable, the mileage advantage may not be enough to justify the cost and — for some — the hassle of buying a diesel SUV.\n\nAs for the Q7 itself, beyond its diesel power plant, it may be on the smaller side, but it doesn’t lack substance. It can be filled with feature on top of feature — though there aren’t any bargains to be found, as our test vehicle’s price reflects.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Audi Q7?\n\nThe Audi Q7 is a three-row luxury SUV with room for up to seven people. It competes with models like the Acura MDX and BMW X5. Power comes from a standard 248-horsepower, turbocharged four-cylinder engine or an available 329-hp, supercharged V-6. An eight-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive are standard with both engines.\n\nWhat's New on the 2019 Audi Q7?\n\nOptional 20-inch wheels now come with run-flat all-season tires. MMI navigation is newly standard for Premium models. The Audi Virtual Cockpit, a digital dashboard that can be configured to different views, is standard on Premium Plus models, as is a 360-degree camera system, LED headlights and taillights, dynamic turn signals, and the Audi phone box with wireless charging.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Audi Q7 Are Most Important?\n\nFront pre-collision warning with automatic emergency braking is standard, and adaptive cruise control, rear cross-traffic alert and other active safety features are available. Amenities such as heated front seats, a panoramic moonroof and xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights are standard, and you can add options such as an adaptive air suspension, a 23-speaker Bang & Olufsen premium sound system and Audi's Virtual Cockpit.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Audi Q7?\n\nThe Q7 emphasizes driving dynamics over practicality and utility, so it should appeal more to enthusiasts than those looking for a cushy three-row luxury SUV. The prices get steep with options, especially with the V-6 engine, but some competitors live in the same high-rent district. It's certainly worth a look, especially if you're searching for a luxury SUV that's entertaining to drive.",
