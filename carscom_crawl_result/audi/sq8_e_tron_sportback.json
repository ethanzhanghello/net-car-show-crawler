      "expert_review": "After getting a new name and more range for the 2024 model year, Audi’s Q8 e-Tron lineup sees minor updates for 2025.\n\nRelated: 2024 Audi Q8 e-Tron Quick Spin: New Name, Bigger Battery, Better Experience\n\nWhat’s New\n\nQ8 e-Trons and Q8 Sportback e-Trons now include standard traffic-sign recognition, LED interior lighting and HomeLink buttons integrated into the rearview mirror. Additionally, Park Assist Plus has been upgraded to Remote Park Assist Plus, which allows external vehicle operation in permitted areas.\n\nThe Black Optic Package now features Anthracite Gray Audi rings for 2025, and the SQ8 e-Tron’s Black Optic Package is now available with 21-inch wheels with a bi-color finish and summer tires. A new Magnesium Package adds Neodymium Gold matte wheels, Magnesium and black exterior accents, puddle lamps featuring the “e-Tron Edition” logo, gray Audi rings and a body-color grille.\n\nPowertrain Specs and Range\n\nThe Q8 e-Tron and Q8 Sportback e-Tron use dual electric motors producing a combined 402 horsepower; Audi says the all-wheel-drive powertrain is good for a 0-60 mph time of 5.4 seconds. Powered by a 114-kilowatt-hour battery, both variants have an EPA-estimated range of 272 miles; the optional 21-inch wheels lower the range to 254 miles. Efficiency ratings are 77/80/78 mpg-equivalent city/highway/combined, or 73/75/74 mpg-e with the larger wheels.\n\nThe SQ8 e-Tron and SQ8 Sportback e-Tron add a third motor, increasing output to a total of 496 hp and reducing the 0-60 time to 4.2 seconds. The additional power results in a reduced EPA-estimated range of 242 miles, or 208 miles with 21- or 22-inch wheels; the SQ8s have a combined efficiency rating of 68/72/70 mpg-e, or 59/60/60 mpg-e with the bigger wheel options.\n\nPricing and Availability\n\nThe 2025 Audi Q8 e-Tron lineup is expected to arrive at dealerships soon.
