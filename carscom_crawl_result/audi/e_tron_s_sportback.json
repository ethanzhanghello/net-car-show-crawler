      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Audi E-Tron?\n\nThe Audi E-Tron and E-Tron Sportback are five-seat electric SUVs that put an emphasis on driving comfort and superb cabin quality. Each comes standard with all-wheel drive and a dual-motor electric powertrain that produces 355 horsepower and 414 pounds-feet of torque. The Sportback looks, well, sportier thanks to its tapered roofline, but the E-Tron and Sportback are identical in how they drive. The more powerful S versions nudge output to an impressive 496 hp and 718 pounds-feet of torque; however, EPA-estimated range for the S drops to a maximum of 212 miles in the S and 208 miles in the S Sportback. The regular E-Tron’s 226-mile range already trails rivals like the Ford Mustang Mach-E, Jaguar I-Pace, and Tesla’s Model X and Model Y.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Audi E-Tron?\n\nOrange brake calipers, 22-inch alloy wheels, LED matrix headlights and rear side airbags are now standard on the E-Tron Sportback in its range-topping Prestige trim. Those LED lights, along with carbon-fiber cabin trim, are newly standard on the E-Tron S and E-Tron Sportback S.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Audi E-Tron Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nAll-wheel drive\n10.1-inch infotainment screen\n8.6-inch screen for climate controls\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nAmazon Alexa\nLeather seating\nHeated front seats\nNavigation\nSatellite radio\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nAdaptive cruise control\n22-inch alloy wheels\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nBang & Olufsen audio system\nSurround-view parking camera\nHead-up instrument display\nPower soft-close doors\nShould I Buy the 2023 Audi E-Tron?\n\nThe 2023 Audi E-Tron and E-Tron Sportback are electric SUVs for car shoppers concerned with shouting to the world that they’re driving an EV. With a conservative exterior design, the E-Tron is a comfortable, smooth-running electric SUV that delivers a strong roster of standard tech and convenience features. It’s a shame the E-Tron’s driving range falls short of most direct rivals’ — and while we’re being picky, the front trunk is also tiny. Still, if you don’t mind its range limitations, the E-Tron is worth a test drive.",
