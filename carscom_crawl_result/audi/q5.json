      "expert_review": "Welcome to the race Audi.\n\nWhen the German luxury sport carmaker brought out the Audi Q5 this year, you just knew it was going to be good.\n\nThis is not just another luxury crossover. It’s one with attitude, and once you hop behind the wheel, you’ll come to believe that it doesn’t know it’s a crossover, it thinks it’s a car.\n\nTechnically, there’s some truth behind that. The Q5 is built off of the same platform as the Audi A4, so the car-like ride should be expected.\n\nBut it’s the combination of this crossover’s capabilities that make it so impressive. It can carry the family or just burn up open roads.\n\nThe 3.2-liter FSI V-6 creates 270 horsepower and 243 pound-feet of torque that lets it fly down the highway. It can hit 60 mph from a standstill in around under 7 seconds and it can keep hauling faster from there.\n\nThe six-speed automatic transmission is silky smooth even during aggressive driving, which the Q5 seems to relish. Its independent suspension keeps body roll through hard turns to a minimum and the tightly wrapped steering encourages you to press through fast corners.\n\nReally, I most enjoyed the Q5 on the highway. Its quiet ride and luxury appointments make it great for long excursions. Road trips are much more fun with the Q5 in your life because you arrive feeling better than when you left.\n\nInterior exceeds most cars The interior is fantastic: Leather everywhere, comfortable seats (standard 12-way power seats in the front) and the new 3G MMI system.\n\nThe 3D graphics on the navigation system are video game quality. Using the Sirius traffic-based navigation system, the new MMI operates off of voice commands that sound more like suggestions. Say “I need money,” and the vehicle will pull up nearby ATMs on the map. Say “I need gas,” and it will find local filling stations. Say “I need more money,” and it will suggest you find a better job.\n\nWell, it’s not that creative, but if you’re going to buy the Q5, you’ve probably already got decent work. The Q5 starts at $37,000.\n\nBut it’s worth it.\n\nThe Q5 moves Audi’s commitment to interiors forward, keeping it a step in front of most carmakers. There’s ruggedness and it feels well made with high quality materials. I like the curvy dash, the metal trim touches and even the three zone climate controls that let people in the back get their share of cool or warm air.\n\nThere’s also a large pass through from the front to the rear, which makes it ideal for parents to keep tabs on the kids in the back. You don’t have to reach over the seat, just through them.\n\nThere’s also no attempt to plug a third row into the back. Many people like that additional space, but if you really need it, get a Q7. Too many other vehicles have started cramming a bench back there just to take up space. That space is hard to get into and it just doesn’t make much sense.\n\nCompact crossovers with a third row are dumb and Audi isn’t dumb.\n\nIt could have plopped a third row in the Q5, because it has a longer wheelbase than its major competition. Doing that would have hurt the overall comfort. Additionally, the 60/40 split second row folds down nicely and provides loads of space for carrying things other than people. German shepherds will love this crossover.\n\nQ5 can tow 4,400 pounds While the Q5 may ride like a car, it has a very distinctive truck look to it. The wide body and wheels pushed out to the corners give it a big stance. It looks as surefooted as it drives on the road.\n\nThe Quattro drive, Audi’s legendary all-wheel drive system, keeps the Q5 planted in even the most severe weather. Additionally, Audi has provided an adjustable electronic stability control — called Dynamic ESP — that can be adjusted for on or off road driving.\n\nThe Q5 also has another truck-like quality: it can tow 4,400 pounds, something the competition, such as the BMW X3, Lexus RX 350 and Mercedes GLK, cannot do.\n\nBut most of all, the Q5 is fun to drive.\n\nIt may have all of the utility of larger vehicles and still turn heads with its LED trimmed headlamps, but if it was just a commuter on the highway, what’s the point.\n\nNo, the Q5 will make you look for longer routes home — though it may not take you any more time to drive them. You’ll just arrive with a bigger smile on your face.\n\nSburgess@detnews.com (313) 223-3217",

      "expert_review": "There are large, comfy SUVs that are made to haul large families to idyllic picnics in the countryside. You can just see them parked under a tree while sunbeams shine down, birds sing and an angel plays a harp.\n\nOn the other side of the valley, where snow falls, thunder booms and all hell breaks loose, the Audi Q5 is quite at home cruising down the road, thank you very much. I got to test a 2010 Q5 during a snowy, wet, nasty week, and I found it equal to the task. It has its shortcomings — it’s not an SUV for large families, and I wonder about an inconsistent feeling you get from Q5’s steering — but it’s also very enjoyable.\n\nSo, yeah, this is not the car for you if you’re the Waltons, but families aren’t the only people who buy cars.\n\nGoing & Stopping\nThe high point of the Q5 is its drivetrain. The spec sheet tells you there’s a 3.2-liter V-6 with direct fuel injection under the hood, making 270 horsepower and 243 pounds-feet of torque, hooked up to a six-speed automatic transmission. But numbers don’t tell the story.\n\nWhat’s important is that when you press the gas, you get a nice, immediate response, in which I have to think the engine’s direct injection has to play a role. It doesn’t matter if you’re pulling away from a light or passing at highway speeds; the power is there. That’s usually the result of a good engine/transmission marriage, in which both complement each other, and the Q5 really gets it right.\n\nThe Q5 is the only SUV I’ve driven lately that’s surprised me with the power on hand in every situation; I kept thinking, “This is going to be the car that gets me a speeding ticket.” That’s not to say it’s a drag-racer, but I’d put it near the top of its segment in terms of acceleration, along with competitors like the Infiniti EX35 and Mercedes-Benz GLK350.\n\nThe steering isn’t at the top of the class, however. It shares a trait I’ve noticed in many all-wheel-drive luxury vehicles: inconsistent feedback, especially when driving around parking lots. It feels like the front wheels don’t want to turn, and then it feels like they want to turn too much. It’s most noticeable when driving around parking lots or making tight turns from a stop; it’s less noticeable at higher speeds. Our test car didn’t even have the optional Audi Drive Select system, which adds a variable-ratio steering system that may exacerbate these tendencies.\n\nThe ride and handling deserve a mention, as they’re quite good. The Q5 manages to isolate you from bumps, yet still be firm in turns and on highway on-ramps. It makes you feel comfortable when driving fast. Some cars don’t manage to strike that handling/ride balance just right, but with the Q5, Audi does.\n\nThe Q5 felt planted — in a good way — in a couple of inches of wet, sloppy snow; in general it seemed to get on well with the bad conditions. Some SUVs feel like they sort of float across snow, and while that’s not necessarily a bad thing, the Q5 felt more like it was clawing through the snow, and I liked that. It should be noted, however, that all of my snow driving was done at slower speeds, tooling around the city — not on the highway.\n\nUtility & Comfort\nThe Q5 is a mixed bag in this department. The cargo area is a nice size, and I don’t see it shirking from any trips to the grocery store. With the rear seats folded, the SUV should be able to handle the odd trip to the hardware store (or, I don’t know, a triathlon). The rear floor’s load height wasn’t too high for me, but shorter folks may want to try it out for themselves. The button to close the rear hatch is mounted in the hatch itself, so it will be a stretch for some people to hit, but they can just use the fob. Either way, to my mind, the best systems mount the power-close button down in the cargo area.\n\nWhere the Q5 really comes up short, though, is in second-row room. With the driver’s seat in position for me, I simply could not fit comfortably in the second row. My legs were jammed into the front seat, and headroom was very tight. That could be because of the optional panoramic sunroof, but that wouldn’t explain why my legs were so jammed up. I’m about 6-foot-1, but most of my height is in my torso, so things really shouldn’t have been so bad back there. If you’re 5-foot-8 but have long legs, you’ll also likely feel jammed. If you plan on taking more than yourself and one passenger in the Q5, you really need to check out that second row.\n\nAnother thing to check out is the noise level in the cabin. The Q5 did a good job blocking out ambient noise, such as idling buses and other big-city din, but you’ll hear the tires rolling down the road. That doesn’t bother me — I think cars isolate people from the road too much these days — but you might disagree. Also, our test model came with roof-rack crossbars, so there was a fair amount of wind noise at highway speeds. Removing the crossbars could cut down on wind noise, but it still might be too loud for your liking.\n\nThe driver’s seat in the Q5 is quite comfortable; it’s firm enough to offer support, but it has enough give to not beat you up. The optional heated front seats offered a wide range of heat settings (as opposed to just high or low), which is a nice touch.\n\nAmenities\nThe 2010 Q5 is only available in one trim level, but you get the choice of several option packages. Ours came with two, the Premium Plus and MMI Navigation Plus packages, and each offered its share of niceties.\n\nNavigation Plus gives you (duh) a navigation system. Now, I don’t normally get all excited about a navigation system’s graphics, because I tend to rely on the audible commands to get where I’m going. But I have to say that Audi’s system is the coolest-looking one I’ve seen yet. Nearly all the buildings in Chicago’s skyline were represented, and the street labels were easy to read, too. Is this really important? Maybe not, but some cars are just cool — and this feature is cool.\n\nParking sensors are also part of the navigation package, and the sensors are set low in the bumper. This is a good thing, as it helps you avoid piled-up snow and curbs. Something I absolutely loved was that when I turned on the parking sensors, the radio volume was muted. It’s nice that the system eliminates a distraction right when I want it eliminated. (Now, if only they made a similar feature for my desk so I could mute the inconsiderate people who hold loud meetings across the hall from me …)\n\nThe Premium Plus Package includes things like a power tailgate, heated front seats and LED daytime running lights — all of which are neat, but the highlight is the panoramic sunroof. There are a lot of “panoramic” sunroofs on the market these days, but what makes Audi’s noteworthy is that it extends all the way from the front to the back of the car. Some panoramic roofs aren’t as large, but I had the impression that the Q5’s entire roof was glass. If I’m going to shell out money for a sunroof, this is what I want.\n\nMileage & Safety\nThe Q5 gets an estimated 18/23 mpg city/highway. As it was introduced for the 2009 model year, there isn’t sufficient data for the Q5 to have reliability ratings yet, but Audi offers a 48-month/50,000-mile warranty that’s competitive with Mercedes-Benz and Lexus. BMW throws in free maintenance for the length of the warranty. The Q5 received the highest score, Good, in both frontal offset and side-impact crash tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. Q5 models with power seats also received a Good rating for rear crash tests. It has not yet been subjected to IIHS’ roof-strength tests.\n\nAs the Q5 is so new, changes between 2009 models and the 2010 we tested aren’t major, but you can check them out for yourself here.\n\nQ5 in the Market\nThe Q5’s price is something to keep in mind. Our test model, with options, came in at $45,700, and the base Q5 costs about $37,000. That’s more than a base Acura RDX and roughly the same as a larger Lexus RX 350. There’s also the lack of reliability data to keep in mind. That’s not to say the Q5 will be unreliable — it’s just that we don’t know.\n\nHow well the Q5 stacks up in the market depends on what market you’re in. If you’ve got a large family — in terms of numbers or height — the Q5’s second row will come up short, which cuts it from the “established family” arena. (If you have urchins who are still strapped into child-safety seats, you might be able to scoot by with the Q5 for a while.) Also, if you’re on a tight budget, this isn’t the SUV for you. As far as I’m concerned, though, compact luxury SUVs aren’t aimed at “established families” — that’s what larger SUVs are for. And “luxury” negates “budget” in my book as well.\n\nThe Q5 seems to be aimed at couples or singles who want to be able to pick up their friends at the airport, go to a hardware store, feel secure driving in snow, and maybe go a bit fast now and again. In this realm, the Q5 does very well. If I had the money and were in the market for a compact luxury SUV, I’d at least scrape out an afternoon to test-drive one.\n\nSend Bill an email",

      "expert_review": "The second generation of Audi’s mid-size SUV has arrived just in time to capitalize on the exploding popularity of the vehicle’s compact SUV class. Competition has only gotten stiffer, but buyers have become more numerous, so Audi’s timing couldn’t be better to drop this redesigned 2018 Q5 onto our streets.\n\nThe new Q5 is a little longer, a little taller and a little bigger inside than the SUV it replaces (compare the 2017 and 2018 models here), and it features a new interior, more technology and simplified choices of drivetrains, as well. The performance-oriented SQ5, which was also redesigned for 2018, is covered separately.\n\nThe last Q5 was a competent, well-executed luxury crossover with a few quirks, including a sluggish transmission. Has Audi improved the breed with this new model?\n\nIt Looks the Business\n\nLove it or hate it, Audi’s styling is certainly consistent. Even an all-new model like the Q5 looks similar enough to the outgoing model that you might not know on sight which is newer. The Audi Q5 keeps to the program with its shield grille, swept-back smooth sides and family taillights. There is, however, something new for 2018: The hood’s cutline continues into the fenders, giving it a more seamless appearance. It’s attractive and immediately identifiable as an Audi.\n\nYou Won’t Miss the V-6\n\nLast year’s optional, supercharged 3.0-liter V-6 is gone. The new Q5 is powered by a single engine choice: a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that pumps out a healthy 252 horsepower.\n\nIt’s mated to a new seven-speed, dual-clutch automatic transmission instead of the last model’s traditional eight-speed automatic. The dual-clutch transmission routes power to the Audi Q5’s standard Quattro all-wheel drive. The engine provides plenty of power across the rev range, with lots of grunt from both a standing stop and while flying at highway speeds. The transmission shifts quickly and smoothly, with none of the odd hesitation reported from the six-speed in the previous model. On a couple of occasions, however, it did strangely cut power to the engine under some specific circumstances — nothing I could replicate reliably, but an odd sign of something not quite right with either the engine control or the transmission programming.\n\nThe Q5 also exhibited some unusual behavior when coming to a stop. The transmission didn’t seem to disengage properly, causing the engine to stutter and feel as if it were about to shut off as part of the SUV’s automatic stop-start function — even though that function was deactivated (which can be accomplished by pushing a button on the dash). These unusual performance gremlins weren’t enough to warrant a trip to the dealer, but they did make me wonder if the SUV was supposed to be behaving like this or if there was something wrong with my vehicle.\n\nThe rest of the Q5’s performance is admirable. It’s quiet, smooth, rides well and provides confident, neutral handling in most situations. Push the button to switch into Audi Drive Select’s Sport mode and throttle response gets faster, steering resistance goes up and the Audi Q5 gets a lot more entertaining. Or, for a relaxing experience guaranteed to please passengers, keep it in Comfort. The only issue I had with handling is that the steering’s return-to-center isn’t very good. It holds a corner line all too well — even beyond when you want to drive straight again, necessitating a manual adjustment when an automatic one would normally occur. It’s quirky and doesn’t happen all the time, but it’s oddly noticeable when it does.\n\nFuel economy is very good compared with the Q5’s competitors. The EPA rates the new Q5 at 23/27/25 mpg city/highway/combined, which is 3 mpg higher than the outgoing model in the city and combined. The all-wheel-drive Acura RDX achieves a rating of only 19/27/22 mpg from its standard 3.5-liter V-6, while the turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engines in both the Lexus NX 200t and AWD Lincoln MKC are rated 22/28/24 mpg and 19/25/21 mpg, respectively.\n\nSadly, Audi no longer offers a diesel engine in the Q5 in the U.S. due to its emissions-cheating scandal, so if you want better fuel economy, you’ll have to opt for the Lexus NX 300h hybrid, which is rated 33/30/31 mpg. The Q5 hybrid was discontinued after 2016 and there’s no word of a replacement.\n\nInside, Nobody Does It Better\n\nThe continued superiority of Audi’s interior quality and design is solidly represented here, with the updated cabin of the 2018 Q5 coming in at the top of the class. Excellent materials, solid-feeling switches, logical layouts, and comfortable seats with plenty of room for passengers all make for an impressive place to be. Visibility is excellent in every direction thanks to a high seating position and low beltline. Front occupants have plenty of headroom and legroom, and a slight increase in the wheelbase for 2018 seems to have improved backseat roominess, as well — no longer does it feel cramped.\n\nNotable for its appearance in the Q5 this year is Audi’s Virtual Cockpit, seen previously on other models in the Audi lineup. An option included in the Navigation Package, it replaces the traditional gauges with a full digital display behind the steering wheel, allowing for visual customization and duplication of items seen on the dashboard’s central display screen.\n\nThe multimedia system has been redone, but it’s no improvement over how Audi used to do things. The old Multi Media Interface was super-intuitive, not even requiring you to look at the buttons as you navigated on screen. The new one features a large touchpad in front of the various knobs and buttons. It’s reportedly for handwriting recognition, but I didn’t use it once. Apple CarPlay works well, however, despite needing to use the rotary selector knob to make it work. The changes to Audi MMI sadly encourage one to use Apple CarPlay or Android Auto instead, but these systems are optimized for use with a touchscreen, which the Q5 doesn’t offer.\n\nPlenty of Room for Stuff\n\nAn SUV is supposed to be about utility, and the Audi Q5 delivers. The cargo area is a spacious 26.8 cubic feet behind the backseat, expanding to 60.4 cubic feet with the seat folded. That beats out the Lincoln MKC (25.2 and 53.1 cubic feet) and Lexus NX 200t (17.7 and 54.6) but comes in just a little shy of the Acura RDX (26.1 and 61.3).\n\nMore important, perhaps, is how the Q5 stacks up cargo-wise to the Audi A4 Allroad wagon, given the vehicles are similarly sized and have similar missions. The Q5 edges out the Allroad, which has 24.2 cubic feet of cargo room behind the backseat and 58.5 with it folded, proving the Audi Q5 is more than just a lifted A4 wagon.\n\nSafety\n\nAs of publication, the 2018 Audi Q5 had not been crash-tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. Due to its redesign, the 2017 model ratings don’t apply. If the 2018 is tested, its results will appear on this page.\n\nThe Q5 continues to offer all the latest safety features, most of them optional or included in higher trim packages. Audi Pre-Sense Basic is standard but is more of a “crash preparation” system, closing the windows and moonroof, tightening safety belts, etc. Pre-Sense City is Audi’s object-detection and autonomous braking system, providing full braking up to 52 mph. Other systems, like blind spot warning, lane departure prevention with lane centering, adaptive cruise control with stop and go, turn assist, and rear cross-traffic alert are also available.\n\nA Little Expensive\n\nThe new Q5 starts at $42,475, including destination, for a base Premium trim. There are levels above this, which Audi treats as option packages: the Premium Plus, which I tested, and the Prestige. The Premium Plus Package costs another $4,000 and adds LED headlights, stainless steel trim, a panoramic moonroof, heated auto-folding mirrors and heated seats. Add navigation, 20-inch wheels, Bang & Olufsen premium audio, a cold weather package and special Florett Silver paint, and you get to our as-tested price of $52,700.\n\nThe Audi Q5 starts at a higher price than competing vehicles like the Acura RDX, Lincoln MKC and Lexus NX 200t. All those vehicles start thousands of dollars less but end up costing about the same when you option them up equally — or at least as equally as possible, considering the Audi features some things competitors simply don’t offer, like Virtual Cockpit display, an optional full-color head-up display and more.\n\nThe Audi Q5 is also nicer inside than any of its aforementioned competitors. It’s truly challenged only by the Mercedes-Benz GLC, which is even more expensive and sits on a rear-wheel-drive platform.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2021 Audi Q5 Sportback trades some of the regular Q5’s utility for a sportier look — and sacrifices less practicality than expected in doing so.\n\nVersus the competition: The coupelike SUV trend is a bit of a head-scratcher to us, given the body style often leaves less interior space than a traditional SUV (for more money). The Q5 Sportback doesn’t deviate from this formula, but its relatively few trade-offs enhance its overall appeal.\n\nBesides the new Sportback body style, the 2021 Audi Q5 also gets updated exterior styling, a standard mild-hybrid base powertrain and a new multimedia system that drops the knob-based controller Audi has used for years in favor of a touchscreen interface. Take a look at the differences between the 2020 and 2021 Q5 in our side-by-side comparison.\n\nRelated: 2021 Audi Q5 and SQ5 Sportbacks: Less Is More?\n\nOur 2021 Q5 Sportback test vehicle had an as-tested price of $56,540, including a $1,095 destination charge. It was equipped with the Premium Plus Package as well as Audi’s navigation and sport packages, the latter featuring a sport suspension and 21-inch wheels with summer tires. The car we drove also had an optional Bang & Olufsen stereo.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThe Q5’s standard 261-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder is a smooth-revving, responsive engine that moves this SUV well; a new mild-hybrid system has boosted efficiency of the regular Q5 for 2021, giving it a combined EPA rating that’s 1 mpg higher than the 2020 Q5’s. The engine is hurt, however, by very gradual accelerator pedal response in the transmission’s Drive mode, which makes the Q5 feel sluggish when starting off. Putting the gear selector in Sport improves drivetrain response immensely, though it also keeps the transmission in lower gears. The turbo four-cylinder works with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission that’s quick to kick down when you floor the gas pedal.\n\nEPA-estimated gas mileage for the 2021 Q5 is 23/28/25 mpg city/highway/combined, which is similar to other luxury compact competitors. Audi recommends premium gas for the Sportback’s turbo four-cylinder engine, which is also the norm for this class.\n\nOur test vehicle’s sport suspension and low-profile tires on 21-inch wheels contributed to a firm, unforgiving ride that sometimes felt brittle on rough pavement. The Q5 Sportback does, however, stay relatively flat in fast, sweeping turns, and it’s a confident and poised cruiser on smooth pavement. Apart from some tire noise, the cabin is very quiet at highway speeds.\n\nLike other Audis, the Q5 Sportback has highly assisted steering that makes it easy to turn the wheel but doesn’t offer much in the way of feedback. Steering precision is good, however, and the Q5 responds readily to steering inputs.\n\nThe Interior\n\nCabin materials’ quality and fit and finish are good, with soft-touch surfaces on the upper part of the dashboard and doors, but our test car’s all-black interior color scheme had a somberness to it that even a scattering of metallic accents couldn’t overcome. Some of the shinier center console trim even reflected sunlight into my eyes at times while driving. The console doesn’t have much storage space, either.\n\nPower-adjustable front sport seats with manual cushion-length adjustment are standard. The driver’s seat is comfortable and not overly restrictive, and front headroom is good. Leather seating surfaces and front seat heaters are standard.\n\nDespite the Sportback’s fastback roofline, over-shoulder visibility is decent thanks to large rear side windows, triangular rear-quarter windows and sizable back window. Crisp images from the available 360-degree camera system help, too.\n\nThe Sportback’s sloping roofline doesn’t significantly compromise rear-seat headroom, which is adequate for taller adults. The rear bench seat is comfortable, and it reclines and slides forward and backward. There’s good foot space under the front seats, too.\n\nThe Sportback’s cargo area is only marginally smaller than the regular Q5’s, according to Audi’s measurements: The brand says the Sportback has 24.7 cubic feet of cargo space with the rear seat up and 51.9 cubic feet with it lowered, versus 25.9 and 54.1 cubic feet in the regular Q5. The Sportback’s roofline reduces the height of the cargo area, and there’s a slight incline in the extended cargo floor with the backseat folded. Seatback release handles in the cargo area make it easier to fold the backseat when standing at the back of the SUV.\n\nTech Features\n\nThe Q5’s new touchscreen multimedia interface is simpler to use than the knob-based control system it replaces, and the ubiquity of smartphones should make it easier for owners to familiarize themselves with it. A 10.1-inch screen atop the center of the dashboard is standard. The system also includes wireless Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity, but wired-only Android Auto.\n\nThe touchscreen has high-quality graphics, and CarPlay uses the screen’s full width. It’s easy to toggle between the multimedia system’s built-in interface and CarPlay, and the Premium Plus model adds a wireless charger — helpful for reducing battery drain in a wirelessly connected smartphone.\n\nPremium Plus versions also add Audi’s Virtual Cockpit Plus digital instrument panel. It features a configurable 12.3-inch high-resolution screen in place of traditional gauges, and it can also show satellite image overlays in its navigation mode.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2021 Audi Q5 Doesn’t Mess Much With a Good Thing\n2021 Audi MMI Multimedia System Promises Superior Speed, Connectivity, Content\n2021 Audi SQ5 Review: Not as Racy as It Looks, and That’s OK\nShop for a New Audi Q5\nSafety and Driver-Assist Features\n\nThe Q5 Sportback received good ratings in all Insurance Institute for Highway Safety crashworthiness tests, and its standard automatic emergency braking system earned superior and advanced scores for its vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-pedestrian performance, respectively.\n\nOther standard active-safety features include lane-keeping assist, blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert, and front and rear parking sensors. Premium Plus models add adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go, and the top-of-the-line Prestige version adds a head-up display with traffic-sign-recognition capability.\n\nShould You Buy the 2021 Audi Q5 Sportback?\n\nThe Q5 Sportback’s $48,895 starting price (with destination) undercuts base prices for the 2021 BMW X4 and 2021 Mercedes-Benz GLC300 Coupe, but it’s more expensive than an Infiniti QX55, which is new for the 2022 model year (see their specs compared).\n\nWith nearly as much cargo space as a regular Q5 and comfortable seating for adults in both rows, the Q5 Sportback takes some of the practical reasons for choosing a regular Q5 SUV off the table. The Sportback’s starting price is $4,500 more than a Q5 SUV, but the Sportback also comes with larger 19-inch wheels and a panoramic moonroof in addition to its sleeker exterior. If you like its styling and the extra expense isn’t an obstacle, the Q5 Sportback offers most of the attributes of an SUV without looking like most SUVs.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in March 2010 about the 2010 Audi Q5. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2011, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThere are large, comfy SUVs that are made to haul large families to idyllic picnics in the countryside. You can just see them parked under a tree while sunbeams shine down, birds sing and an angel plays a harp.\n\nOn the other side of the valley, where snow falls, thunder booms and all hell breaks loose, the Audi Q5 is quite at home cruising down the road, thank you very much. I got to test a 2010 Q5 during a snowy, wet, nasty week, and I found it equal to the task. It has its shortcomings — it’s not an SUV for large families, and I wonder about an inconsistent feeling you get from Q5’s steering — but it’s also very enjoyable.\n\nSo, yeah, this is not the car for you if you’re the Waltons, but families aren’t the only people who buy cars.\n\nGoing & Stopping\nThe high point of the Q5 is its drivetrain. The spec sheet tells you there’s a 3.2-liter V-6 with direct fuel injection under the hood, making 270 horsepower and 243 pounds-feet of torque, hooked up to a six-speed automatic transmission. But numbers don’t tell the story.\n\nWhat’s important is that when you press the gas, you get a nice, immediate response, in which I have to think the engine’s direct injection has to play a role. It doesn’t matter if you’re pulling away from a light or passing at highway speeds; the power is there. That’s usually the result of a good engine/transmission marriage, in which both complement each other, and the Q5 really gets it right.\n\nThe Q5 is the only SUV I’ve driven lately that’s surprised me with the power on hand in every situation; I kept thinking, “This is going to be the car that gets me a speeding ticket.” That’s not to say it’s a drag-racer, but I’d put it near the top of its segment in terms of acceleration, along with competitors like the Infiniti EX35 and Mercedes-Benz GLK350.\n\nThe steering isn’t at the top of the class, however. It shares a trait I’ve noticed in many all-wheel-drive luxury vehicles: inconsistent feedback, especially when driving around parking lots. It feels like the front wheels don’t want to turn, and then it feels like they want to turn too much. It’s most noticeable when driving around parking lots or making tight turns from a stop; it’s less noticeable at higher speeds. Our test car didn’t even have the optional Audi Drive Select system, which adds a variable-ratio steering system that may exacerbate these tendencies.\n\nThe ride and handling deserve a mention, as they’re quite good. The Q5 manages to isolate you from bumps, yet still be firm in turns and on highway on-ramps. It makes you feel comfortable when driving fast. Some cars don’t manage to strike that handling/ride balance just right, but with the Q5, Audi does.\n\nThe Q5 felt planted — in a good way — in a couple of inches of wet, sloppy snow; in general it seemed to get on well with the bad conditions. Some SUVs feel like they sort of float across snow, and while that’s not necessarily a bad thing, the Q5 felt more like it was clawing through the snow, and I liked that. It should be noted, however, that all of my snow driving was done at slower speeds, tooling around the city — not on the highway.\n\nUtility & Comfort\nThe Q5 is a mixed bag in this department. The cargo area is a nice size, and I don’t see it shirking from any trips to the grocery store. With the rear seats folded, the SUV should be able to handle the odd trip to the hardware store (or, I don’t know, a triathlon). The rear floor’s load height wasn’t too high for me, but shorter folks may want to try it out for themselves. The button to close the rear hatch is mounted in the hatch itself, so it will be a stretch for some people to hit, but they can just use the fob. Either way, to my mind, the best systems mount the power-close button down in the cargo area.\n\nWhere the Q5 really comes up short, though, is in second-row room. With the driver’s seat in position for me, I simply could not fit comfortably in the second row. My legs were jammed into the front seat, and headroom was very tight. That could be because of the optional panoramic sunroof, but that wouldn’t explain why my legs were so jammed up. I’m about 6-foot-1, but most of my height is in my torso, so things really shouldn’t have been so bad back there. If you’re 5-foot-8 but have long legs, you’ll also likely feel jammed. If you plan on taking more than yourself and one passenger in the Q5, you really need to check out that second row.\n\nAnother thing to check out is the noise level in the cabin. The Q5 did a good job blocking out ambient noise, such as idling buses and other big-city din, but you’ll hear the tires rolling down the road. That doesn’t bother me — I think cars isolate people from the road too much these days — but you might disagree. Also, our test model came with roof-rack crossbars, so there was a fair amount of wind noise at highway speeds. Removing the crossbars could cut down on wind noise, but it still might be too loud for your liking.\n\nThe driver’s seat in the Q5 is quite comfortable; it’s firm enough to offer support, but it has enough give to not beat you up. The optional heated front seats offered a wide range of heat settings (as opposed to just high or low), which is a nice touch.\n\nAmenities\nThe 2010 Q5 is only available in one trim level, but you get the choice of several option packages. Ours came with two, the Premium Plus and MMI Navigation Plus packages, and each offered its share of niceties.\n\nNavigation Plus gives you (duh) a navigation system. Now, I don’t normally get all excited about a navigation system’s graphics, because I tend to rely on the audible commands to get where I’m going. But I have to say that Audi’s system is the coolest-looking one I’ve seen yet. Nearly all the buildings in Chicago’s skyline were represented, and the street labels were easy to read, too. Is this really important? Maybe not, but some cars are just cool — and this feature is cool.\n\nParking sensors are also part of the navigation package, and the sensors are set low in the bumper. This is a good thing, as it helps you avoid piled-up snow and curbs. Something I absolutely loved was that when I turned on the parking sensors, the radio volume was muted. It’s nice that the system eliminates a distraction right when I want it eliminated. (Now, if only they made a similar feature for my desk so I could mute the inconsiderate people who hold loud meetings across the hall from me …)\n\nThe Premium Plus Package includes things like a power tailgate, heated front seats and LED daytime running lights — all of which are neat, but the highlight is the panoramic sunroof. There are a lot of “panoramic” sunroofs on the market these days, but what makes Audi’s noteworthy is that it extends all the way from the front to the back of the car. Some panoramic roofs aren’t as large, but I had the impression that the Q5’s entire roof was glass. If I’m going to shell out money for a sunroof, this is what I want.\n\nMileage & Safety\nThe Q5 gets an estimated 18/23 mpg city/highway. As it was introduced for the 2009 model year, there isn’t sufficient data for the Q5 to have reliability ratings yet, but Audi offers a 48-month/50,000-mile warranty that’s competitive with Mercedes-Benz and Lexus. BMW throws in free maintenance for the length of the warranty. The Q5 received the highest score, Good, in both frontal offset and side-impact crash tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. Q5 models with power seats also received a Good rating for rear crash tests. It has not yet been subjected to IIHS’ roof-strength tests.\n\nAs the Q5 is so new, changes between 2009 models and the 2010 we tested aren’t major, but you can check them out for yourself here.\n\nQ5 in the Market\nThe Q5’s price is something to keep in mind. Our test model, with options, came in at $45,700, and the base Q5 costs about $37,000. That’s more than a base Acura RDX and roughly the same as a larger Lexus RX 350. There’s also the lack of reliability data to keep in mind. That’s not to say the Q5 will be unreliable — it’s just that we don’t know.\n\nHow well the Q5 stacks up in the market depends on what market you’re in. If you’ve got a large family — in terms of numbers or height — the Q5’s second row will come up short, which cuts it from the “established family” arena. (If you have urchins who are still strapped into child-safety seats, you might be able to scoot by with the Q5 for a while.) Also, if you’re on a tight budget, this isn’t the SUV for you. As far as I’m concerned, though, compact luxury SUVs aren’t aimed at “established families” — that’s what larger SUVs are for. And “luxury” negates “budget” in my book as well.\n\nThe Q5 seems to be aimed at couples or singles who want to be able to pick up their friends at the airport, go to a hardware store, feel secure driving in snow, and maybe go a bit fast now and again. In this realm, the Q5 does very well. If I had the money and were in the market for a compact luxury SUV, I’d at least scrape out an afternoon to test-drive one.\n\nSend Bill an email",

      "expert_review": "I’m a fan of premium compact body-type crossover SUVs — compelling, small packages in which carlike agility, luxury and cargo versatility unite. The five-seat Audi Q5 blends these attributes well, and its sleek profile and attractive LED head- and taillights make the cute-ute look both elegant and sporty.\n\nThe 2012 Audi Q5 is the Goldilocks of the premium compact crossover class, offering a just-right blend of sporty road manners, comfortable driving dynamics, peppy power and plenty of cabin comfort.\n\nThe only change of note for 2012 is the addition of a new S line plus option package. It adds 20-inch titanium alloy wheels and black matte exterior trim. The hybrid model slated for 2012 has been delayed until 2013. 2.0T Premium and the V6-powered, uplevel 3.2 Premium Plus trims return for model-year 2012. I tested the 2.0T Premium. The Q5’s main competitors are the BMW X3, Cadillac SRX and Infiniti EX35. See all of them compared here.\n\nA Balancing Act of Sport & Comfort\nAlthough competitors from BMW and Infiniti offer six-cylinder power for a similar price, the four-cylinder Q5 has no trouble keeping up. In fact, the turbocharged engine never feels slow. The 2.0T’s 211-horsepower rating may seem lacking compared with the SRX (308 hp) and EX35 (297 hp), but the Q5’s turbo makes up for it with 258 lb-ft of torque. It feels robust from a stop and competently delivers more power for highway maneuvers.\n\nThe Q5’s eight-speed automatic transmission is alert overall, sometimes to the point of feeling busy, but it’s generally responsive, with prompt kick downs. A hint of turbo lag delays acceleration at the start, but drivers should be able to acclimate.\n\nTop fuel economy numbers expand this engine’s appeal: The Q5 2.0T’s EPA rating is 20/27 mpg city/highway. I drove 194 miles in an approximate 60/40 city/highway split and got 23 mpg. Cadillac’s SRX is rated 16/23 mpg and the Infiniti EX35 is rated 17/24 mpg.\n\nThe Q5’s ride and handling balance lends it a sporty feel. Though its ride is on the firm side, it’s never jittery or uncomfortable. The payoff is sharp handling. The Q5 feels carlike and agile, with great roadholding even in fast corners. The X3 and EX35 match it for handling, but the Q5 absorbs bumps better.\n\nIn terms of steering, the Q5 is a mixed bag. It has speed-sensitive steering, so it feels light and over-boosted in low-speed maneuvers, then firms up at higher speeds.\n\nCabin Hits & Misses\nHigh-quality leather and soft-touch plastics give the Audi Q5’s cabin an expensive look and feel, but — and this is a big but — Audi’s interior designers should go back to color class. Jet black and cinnamon brown simply do not get along, and confined spaces only amplify garish color combinations.\n\nA subjective matter, you say? I usually agree, but every one of my passengers commented on it, including my husband, who’s normally blind to such egregious fashion faux pas. The Q5 isn’t the only victim; Audi does this in several of its vehicles. Luckily, there are a couple other color combinations to choose from, including light gray, beige and black. The only way to get the brown seats, however, is with the black interior. The rest of the cabin is tastefully trimmed in walnut wood.\n\nThough loud to look at, the cabin itself is impressively hushed. Road noise is well-muffled, but the standard roof rails with removable cross bars induce some wind noise at highway speeds.\n\nFront-seat occupants have ample room. The driver’s comfort is further aided by a cushy, supportive front seat with standard 12-way power adjustment, including lumbar support.\n\nThe confines aren’t as friendly in the backseat, where taller passengers will need more space. Legroom is tight, though the sliding and reclining seat helps; it’s a rarity in this class. Although the optional panoramic moonroof is lovely, it shaves precious inches of headroom.\n\nThe premium compact crossover class is not the place you want to be shopping if you’re looking for second-row legroom. With 37.4 inches of space, however, the Audi Q5 offers more legroom than the X3 (36.8 inches), SRX (36.3 inches) and EX35 (28.5 inches).\n\nThe 60/40-split backseat folds simply from the rear doors or from the cargo area. Folding it yields 57.3 cubic feet of space and an almost flat load floor. There’s also a small storage compartment under the floor. Seats up, the Q5 has 29.1 cubic feet — more than the X3 and EX35 offer with the seats up and enough for a big trip to the grocery store. Its power hatch is a nice convenience, though it’s available only in a pricey option package. This feature is optional on the SRX and X3 and unavailable on the EX35.\n\nMMI: Made Me Insane\nIf you end up with a Audi Q5, book a few hours with the owner’s manual to read up on Audi’s Multi-Media Interface, which takes a lot of getting used to. Although I’m familiar with MMI, we still needed time to get reacquainted. The system absorbs and centralizes a lot of climate, audio and navigation functions, turning most simple tasks into multistep processes. For example, to change the radio presets, you’ll have to drill through several menus. It left me longing for a simple button to push.\n\nPhysically, MMI’s main control knob is ergonomically placed and doesn’t require much of a stretch. The radio volume, however, is controlled via a console knob that’s set far from the driver and requires an awkward reach. Thankfully, steering-wheel controls are standard.\n\nThe upside to MMI is its functions: The real-time weather and traffic data were helpful. The voice-command system understood “next coffee shop” and displayed several in my area. I selected my favorite one and got turn-by-turn directions.\n\nAll the caffeine in the world couldn’t improve the navigation’s functionality, however. Inputting an address requires twisting the console-mounted knob to find and select each number and letter. A touch-screen would really help. Getting lost and wandering into my destination would probably take less time.\n\nTo be fair, BMW’s iDrive system in the X3 is similarly complicated. The EX35’s touch-screen and simplified menu structure, however, are much more intuitive.\n\nFeatures & Pricing\nA base price of $35,600 gets you standard quattro all-wheel drive, brake assist, hill-descent control, dual-zone automatic climate control in front with separate rear controls, a tilt/telescoping leather-wrapped steering wheel with audio controls, leather seats and surfaces, 12-way power front bucket seats and a cooled glove box.\n\nThe Premium Plus Convenience Package adds $4,300 to the sticker and features LED daytime running lights, auto-dimming and power-folding mirrors, front heated seats with driver memory function, stainless-steel exterior trim, a panoramic moonroof and a power liftgate. The $3,000 MMI Navigation Plus Package includes the multimedia system, HD radio and navigation with voice control, and a backup camera with parking sensors.\n\nAudi’s Advanced Key keyless entry system added $550, which brought my test Q5’s final price to $44,800 after the $875 destination fee. Despite its hefty price tag, it stacks up well against similarly priced competition in this expensive class.\n\nSafety\nThe 2012 Audi Q5 received the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s highest score, Good, in frontal offset, side-impact, rear-impact, and roof-strength crash tests, making it a Top Safety Pick. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration last rated the Q5 for the 2010 model year, before NHTSA’s more stringent tests took effect for 2011.\n\nStandard safety features include frontal and side-impact airbags for the front seats, plus side curtain airbags for head protection in the front and rear seats. Side-impact airbags for torso protection are optional for the backseat. As is required of all 2012 models, antilock brakes and an electronic stability system are standard. For a full list of standard safety features, check out the Standard Equipment & Specs page.\n\nThe Q5 offers several active-safety options, but they’re not available across the entire lineup: A helpful backup camera comes only in an expensive package. (It’s a stand-alone option on the X3, standard on the EX35 and standard on uplevel versions of the SRX.) Similarly, a blind spot warning system isn’t available on 2.0T versions of the Q5.\n\nThe Q5 has a refreshingly easy Latch system for installing child-safety seats. Plastic, removable covers make finding the anchors a breeze (though I’d lose the plastic covers within a day).

The Q5’s bottom line can escalate quickly, though, especially considering many features are available only in expensive option packages. Still, the Q5 2.0T is a relative bargain, given that the V6-powered Q5 3.2 Premium Plus starts at $43,000.\n\nAll-wheel-drive versions of the Infiniti EX35 and BMW X3 start at $37,200 and $37,100, respectively. The Cadillac SRX starts at $35,485, but all-wheel drive isn’t available on the base model. Aside from the V-6 engines they offer, equipment levels at this price are similar, which really puts the Q5’s base price into perspective. What sets the Audi Q5 apart is its balance of sport and comfort. It stands out as a stylish, fun-to-drive compact crossover with the luxury trappings buyers expect. Bonus: It also offers a little more passenger and cargo room than its competitors.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in March 2014 about the 2014 Audi Q5. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2015, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nAudi’s Q5 moves into 2014 with a few upgrades to what was already a good all-around compact luxury SUV.\n\nA luxury car can overcome shortcomings by offering a high level of comfort, amenities, materials and performance, but the Q5 is on the higher side of the price equation for what you get. You can compare the 2013 and 2014 versions here.\n\nWhat you can get in 2014 is an all-new diesel variant called the Q5 TDI. It joins a pair of available gasoline engines, including a turbocharged four-cylinder and a 3.0-liter six-cylinder. I tested both the TDI and the 3.0 for this review.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe Q5 perfectly embodies Audi’s current design theme in SUV form. The large grille looks more subtle on a higher-riding vehicle than it does on its sedan siblings. The headlights have also been updated, and most trim levels house standard LED running lights and xenon headlamps.\n\nRelatively little else has changed for 2014, but the Q5 looks perfectly modern and seems even less generic when you line it up next to the Acura RDX, BMW X3, Mercedes-Benz GLK or Volvo XC60.\n\nHow It Drives\nAudi continues to release impressive engine after impressive engine. The latest is a new turbo-diesel offering. The 3.0-liter, turbocharged V-6 produces 240 horsepower and an amazing 428 pounds-feet of torque. That’s more torque than the 5.0-liter V-8 in a Ford Mustang GT.\n\nGetting all that power to hit the wheels requires a bit of finesse. There’s a delay in accelerator response from a standing start that I found slightly annoying, but I assume it helps prevent wheelspin and spares everyday drivers from whiplash. The Sport mode is activated with a simple shift downward from Drive via the eight-speed automatic transmission’s shifter. That gives you more immediate acceleration and will certainly satisfy the speed demon in the family … who needs to drive a somewhat family-friendly vehicle.\n\nThe gas-powered V-6 didn’t slack in the acceleration department, either. With 272 hp and 295 pounds-feet of torque, it’s more than powerful enough for most drivers. The standard V-6 in the RDX is similarly powerful, and the turbocharged sixes in the X3 and XC60 are a step above both Acura and Audi.\n\nThe TDI boosts mileage to 27 mpg combined, up from 23 mpg in the 2.0 and 21 mpg combined in the 3.0. Since you’ll be pumping premium unleaded into the latter two, the price of diesel fuel will generally not be a penalty for TDI buyers.\n\nPast experience with the 2.0-liter Q5 always left me a bit flat in terms of exhilaration, but it proved to be competent versus other base engines in the class.\n\nThe Q5’s power may be a standout — and braking response is above average, as well — but steering and handling are much more of a mixed bag.\n\nAudi’s speed-sensitive steering has been a benefit and a bane for some time. In some vehicles, especially high-performance Audis, it’s nice to have the lighter response in the steering wheel during slow maneuvers, like in parking lots, with a firming up when you increase speed. But the variations in more pedestrian vehicles like the Q5 often seem too lax to me in all situations.\n\nThe Q5 also exhibits more body lean than I’ve noticed in other SUVs of this size in this class. Taking curvy highway off-ramps, tight U-turns and one unexpected emergency reaction were tumultuous affairs in which I dramatically felt the SUV’s body tilt to the outside of the turn.\n\nInterior\nI’m regularly reminded how well Audi executes its interiors — not when I get into the latest redesign, but into a model that’s a few years into its shelf life, like the Q5. The materials are top-quality and the cabin layout sophisticated. Getting this mix right isn’t easy, and Audi has figured it out.\n\nThe sporty nature of traditional Audi sedan and sports car cabins is here, too. It feels like a “cockpit,” a descriptor thrown about too easily these days. And visibility all around is quite good.\n\nThe driver and front passenger have plenty of room, and the comfortable leather seats in both of my test models offered plenty of support. In back, where the seats slide back and recline, there’s “enough” room that an average-sized adult male won’t be cramped. The middle seat, however, is too tiny even for a teenager squeezed between two others.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe word “cockpit” is good not just for the design and feel of the cabin but also for the complicated nature of some of its controls. Newcomers to Audi will take several days to get used to the placement of certain buttons and how to use common features like climate control and the stereo.\n\nAudi’s multimedia system is on par with those from BMW, Mercedes, Lexus and other luxury automakers. None provide a perfect interface, and Audi’s is no exception. The knob controller on the center console clicks as you turn its outer ring to select various functions, displayed on a 7-inch screen in the center of the dashboard. It’s a nice feel. However, with a new directional button in the center of the knob, it’s become a little harder to simply enter the command you’ve selected. Competitors like BMW also have significantly larger screens in their latest models.\n\nThe knob itself is for moving the cursor on the navigation screen. That’s an expected function for many GPS users, especially those accustomed to smartphone applications.\n\nAudi continues to offer optional Bang & Olufsen stereos with 14 speakers, some of which bear good-looking metallic casings, but I didn’t find the sound quality stellar enough in the Q5 to justify the cost, even though it’s a relatively affordable $850 option.\n\nCargo & Storage\nIn the past I’ve always thought the Q5’s cargo area was a bit small compared with the competition. I was surprised to discover while researching that it exceeds most of the class at 29.1 cubic feet with the rear seats in place. The cargo area with them folded is 57.3 cubic feet.\n\nI found that the low load floor was a benefit in real-world testing, hauling the family’s gear for a week. It might also be an aid to the family dog that has to jump in the back.\n\nSafety\nThe Q5 was rated four stars overall in National Highway Traffic Safety Administration crash tests. It also scored the top rating of good in four tests conducted by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. It has not been through the organization’s new frontal small-overlap test at this time, which would determine if it is a Top Safety Pick.\n\nIn addition to a standard array of airbags, there are optional seat-mounted airbags for the rear seats at a cost of $350.\n\nBlind spot monitoring, called Audi Side Assist, is available, but frontal collision warning systems aren’t offered.\n\nThe Q5 performed exceptionally well in our child-safety seat testing. You can view the full Car Seat Check here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe Q5, in gasoline and diesel forms, impressed me in terms of acceleration, luxury feel and practicality, but besides my handling qualms there are also issues of price.\n\nAt $38,195 (all prices cited include destination charges) for the base 2.0 model, the Q5 costs significantly more than the RDX, which has a standard V-6 and optional all-wheel drive for $36,815. All-wheel drive is standard on the Audi. The BMW X3 and Mercedes-Benz GLK350 both start higher than the Q5 with similar engines and all-wheel drive, but you’d likely have to move to a more expensive Q5 trim to get similar equipment. You can compare all four here.\n\nIf you’re purchasing outright, the Acura or Volvo will be better values, but if you’re leasing, the playing field may be evened more in the Q5’s favor. The TDI version, however, pushes prices much higher, starting at $47,395.\n\nIn the end, the styling and excellent powertrains give the Q5 enough weapons for a very competitive fight.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "The Audi Q5 moves into 2014 with a few upgrades to what was already a good all-around compact luxury SUV.\n\nA luxury car can overcome shortcomings by offering a high level of comfort, amenities, materials and performance, but the Q5 is on the higher side of the price equation for what you get. You can compare the 2013 and 2014 versions here.\n\nWhat you can get in 2014 is an all-new diesel variant called the Q5 TDI. It joins a pair of available gasoline engines, including a turbocharged four-cylinder and a 3.0-liter six-cylinder. I tested both the TDI and the 3.0 for this review.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe Q5 perfectly embodies Audi’s current design theme in SUV form. The large grille looks more subtle on a higher-riding vehicle than it does on its sedan siblings. The headlights have also been updated, and most trim levels house standard LED running lights and xenon headlamps.\n\nRelatively little else has changed for 2014, but the Q5 looks perfectly modern and seems even less generic when you line it up next to the Acura RDX, BMW X3, Mercedes-Benz GLK or Volvo XC60.\n\nHow It Drives\nAudi continues to release impressive engine after impressive engine. The latest is a new turbo-diesel offering. While not an S-Line powerhouse, the 3.0-liter, turbocharged V-6 produces 240 horsepower and an amazing 428 pounds-feet of torque. That’s more torque than the 5.0-liter V-8 in a Ford Mustang GT, with the added bonus of standard quattro all-wheel-drive (AWD).\n\nGetting all that power to hit the wheels requires a bit of finesse. There’s a delay in accelerator response from a standing start that I found slightly annoying, but I assume it helps prevent wheelspin and spares everyday drivers from whiplash. The Sport mode is activated with a simple shift downward from Drive via the eight-speed automatic transmission’s shifter. That gives you more immediate acceleration and will certainly satisfy the speed demon in the family … who needs to drive a somewhat family-friendly vehicle.\n\nThe gas-powered V-6 didn’t slack in the acceleration department, either. With 272 hp and 295 lb-ft of torque, it’s more than powerful enough for most drivers. The standard V-6 in the RDX is similarly powerful, and the turbocharged sixes in the X3 and XC60 are a step above both Acura and Audi.\n\nThe TDI quattro boosts mileage to 27 mpg combined, up from 23 mpg in the 2.0 and 21 mpg combined in the 3.0. Since you’ll be pumping premium unleaded into the latter two, the price of diesel fuel will generally not be a penalty for TDI buyers.\n\nPast experience with the 2.0T quattro Audi Q5 always left me a bit flat in terms of exhilaration, but it proved to be competent versus other base engines in the class.\n\nThe Audi Q5’s power may be a standout — and braking response is above average, as well — but other vehicle details, like steering and handling, are much more of a mixed bag.\n\nAudi’s speed-sensing steering has been a benefit and a bane for some time. In some vehicles, especially high-performance Audis, it’s nice to have the lighter response in the steering wheel during slow maneuvers, like in parking lots, with a firming up when you increase speed. But the variations in more pedestrian vehicles like the Q5 often seem too lax to me in all situations.\n\nThe Q5 also exhibits more body lean than I’ve noticed in other SUVs of this size in this class. Taking curvy highway off-ramps, tight U-turns and one unexpected emergency reaction were tumultuous affairs in which I dramatically felt the SUV’s body tilt to the outside of the turn.\n\nInterior\nI’m regularly reminded how well Audi executes its interiors — not when I get into the latest redesign, but into a model that’s a few years into its shelf life, like the Q5. The materials are top-quality and the cabin layout sophisticated. Getting this mix right isn’t easy, and Audi has figured it out.\n\nThe sporty nature of traditional Audi sedan and sports car cabins is here, too. It feels like a “cockpit,” a descriptor thrown about too easily these days. And visibility all around is quite good.\n\nThe driver and front passenger have plenty of room, and the comfortable leather seats in both of my test models offered plenty of support. In back, where the seats slide back and recline, there’s “enough” room that an average-sized adult male won’t be cramped, even with the optional sunroof. The middle seat, however, is too tiny even for a teenager squeezed between two others.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe word “cockpit” is good not just for the design and feel of the cabin but also for the complicated nature of some of its controls. Newcomers to Audi will take several days to get used to the placement of certain buttons and how to use common features like climate control and the stereo.\n\nAudi’s multimedia system is on par with those from BMW, Mercedes, Lexus and other luxury automakers. None provide a perfect interface, and Audi’s is no exception. The knob controller on the center console clicks as you turn its outer ring to select various functions, displayed on a 7-inch screen in the center of the dashboard. It’s a nice feel. However, with a new directional button in the center of the knob, it’s become a little harder to simply enter the command you’ve selected. Competitors like BMW also have significantly larger screens in their latest models.\n\nThe knob itself is for moving the cursor on the navigation screen. That’s an expected function for many GPS users, especially those accustomed to smartphone and Bluetooth applications.\n\nAudi continues to offer optional Bang & Olufsen stereos with 14 speakers, some of which bear good-looking metallic casings, but I didn’t find the sound quality stellar enough in the Q5 to justify the cost, even though it’s a relatively affordable $850 option.\n\nCargo & Storage\nIn the past I’ve always thought the Q5’s cargo area was a bit small compared with the competition. I was surprised to discover while researching that it exceeds most of the class at 29.1 cubic feet with the rear seats in place. The cargo area with them folded is 57.3 cubic feet.\n\nI found that the low load floor was a benefit in real-world testing, hauling the family’s gear for a week. It might also be an aid to the family dog that has to jump in the back.\n\nSafety\nThe Audi Q5 was rated four stars overall in National Highway Traffic Safety Administration crash tests. It also scored the top rating of good in four tests conducted by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. It has not been through the organization’s new frontal small-overlap test at this time, which would determine if it is a Top Safety Pick.\n\nIn addition to a standard array of airbags, there are optional seat-mounted airbags for the rear seats at a cost of $350.\n\nBlind spot monitoring, called Audi Side Assist, is available, but frontal collision warning systems aren’t offered.\n\nThe Q5 performed exceptionally well in our child-safety seat testing. You can view the full Car Seat Check here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe Audi Q5, in gasoline and diesel forms, impressed me in terms of acceleration, luxury feel and practicality, but besides my handling qualms there are also issues of price.\n\nAt $38,195 (all prices cited include destination charges) for the base 2.0 model, the Audi Q5 base price is significantly more than the RDX, which has a standard V-6 and optional all-wheel drive for $36,815. Quattro All-wheel drive is standard on the Audi. The BMW X3 and Mercedes-Benz GLK-class 350 both start higher than the Q5 with similar engines and AWD, but you’d likely have to move to a more expensive Q5 trim to get similar equipment. You can compare all four here.\n\nIf you’re purchasing outright, the Acura or Volvo will be better values, but if you’re leasing, the playing field may be evened more in the Audi Q5’s favor. The TDI version, however, pushes prices much higher, starting at $47,395.\n\nIn the end, the styling and excellent powertrains give the Q5 enough weapons for a very competitive fight.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "The second generation of Audi’s mid-size SUV has arrived just in time to capitalize on the exploding popularity of the vehicle’s compact SUV class. Competition has only gotten stiffer, but buyers have become more numerous, so Audi’s timing couldn’t be better to drop this redesigned 2018 Q5 onto our streets.\n\nThe new Q5 is a little longer, a little taller and a little bigger inside than the SUV it replaces (compare the 2017 and 2018 models here), and it features a new interior, more technology and simplified choices of drivetrains, as well. The performance-oriented SQ5, which was also redesigned for 2018, is covered separately.\n\nThe last Q5 was a competent, well-executed luxury crossover with a few quirks, including a sluggish transmission. Has Audi improved the breed with this new model?\n\nIt Looks the Business\n\nLove it or hate it, Audi’s styling is certainly consistent. Even an all-new model like the Q5 looks similar enough to the outgoing model that you might not know on sight which is newer. The Audi Q5 keeps to the program with its shield grille, swept-back smooth sides and family taillights. There is, however, something new for 2018: The hood’s cutline continues into the fenders, giving it a more seamless appearance. It’s attractive and immediately identifiable as an Audi.\n\nYou Won’t Miss the V-6\n\nLast year’s optional, supercharged 3.0-liter V-6 is gone. The new Q5 is powered by a single engine choice: a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that pumps out a healthy 252 horsepower.\n\nIt’s mated to a new seven-speed, dual-clutch automatic transmission instead of the last model’s traditional eight-speed automatic. The dual-clutch transmission routes power to the Audi Q5’s standard Quattro all-wheel drive. The engine provides plenty of power across the rev range, with lots of grunt from both a standing stop and while flying at highway speeds. The transmission shifts quickly and smoothly, with none of the odd hesitation reported from the six-speed in the previous model. On a couple of occasions, however, it did strangely cut power to the engine under some specific circumstances — nothing I could replicate reliably, but an odd sign of something not quite right with either the engine control or the transmission programming.\n\nThe Q5 also exhibited some unusual behavior when coming to a stop. The transmission didn’t seem to disengage properly, causing the engine to stutter and feel as if it were about to shut off as part of the SUV’s automatic stop-start function — even though that function was deactivated (which can be accomplished by pushing a button on the dash). These unusual performance gremlins weren’t enough to warrant a trip to the dealer, but they did make me wonder if the SUV was supposed to be behaving like this or if there was something wrong with my vehicle.\n\nThe rest of the Q5’s performance is admirable. It’s quiet, smooth, rides well and provides confident, neutral handling in most situations. Push the button to switch into Audi Drive Select’s Sport mode and throttle response gets faster, steering resistance goes up and the Audi Q5 gets a lot more entertaining. Or, for a relaxing experience guaranteed to please passengers, keep it in Comfort. The only issue I had with handling is that the steering’s return-to-center isn’t very good. It holds a corner line all too well — even beyond when you want to drive straight again, necessitating a manual adjustment when an automatic one would normally occur. It’s quirky and doesn’t happen all the time, but it’s oddly noticeable when it does.\n\nFuel economy is very good compared with the Q5’s competitors. The EPA rates the new Q5 at 23/27/25 mpg city/highway/combined, which is 3 mpg higher than the outgoing model in the city and combined. The all-wheel-drive Acura RDX achieves a rating of only 19/27/22 mpg from its standard 3.5-liter V-6, while the turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engines in both the Lexus NX 200t and AWD Lincoln MKC are rated 22/28/24 mpg and 19/25/21 mpg, respectively.\n\nSadly, Audi no longer offers a diesel engine in the Q5 in the U.S. due to its emissions-cheating scandal, so if you want better fuel economy, you’ll have to opt for the Lexus NX 300h hybrid, which is rated 33/30/31 mpg. The Q5 hybrid was discontinued after 2016 and there’s no word of a replacement.\n\nInside, Nobody Does It Better\n\nThe continued superiority of Audi’s interior quality and design is solidly represented here, with the updated cabin of the 2018 Q5 coming in at the top of the class. Excellent materials, solid-feeling switches, logical layouts, and comfortable seats with plenty of room for passengers all make for an impressive place to be. Visibility is excellent in every direction thanks to a high seating position and low beltline. Front occupants have plenty of headroom and legroom, and a slight increase in the wheelbase for 2018 seems to have improved backseat roominess, as well — no longer does it feel cramped.\n\nNotable for its appearance in the Q5 this year is Audi’s Virtual Cockpit, seen previously on other models in the Audi lineup. An option included in the Navigation Package, it replaces the traditional gauges with a full digital display behind the steering wheel, allowing for visual customization and duplication of items seen on the dashboard’s central display screen.\n\nThe multimedia system has been redone, but it’s no improvement over how Audi used to do things. The old Multi Media Interface was super-intuitive, not even requiring you to look at the buttons as you navigated on screen. The new one features a large touchpad in front of the various knobs and buttons. It’s reportedly for handwriting recognition, but I didn’t use it once. Apple CarPlay works well, however, despite needing to use the rotary selector knob to make it work. The changes to Audi MMI sadly encourage one to use Apple CarPlay or Android Auto instead, but these systems are optimized for use with a touchscreen, which the Q5 doesn’t offer.\n\nPlenty of Room for Stuff\n\nAn SUV is supposed to be about utility, and the Audi Q5 delivers. The cargo area is a spacious 26.8 cubic feet behind the backseat, expanding to 60.4 cubic feet with the seat folded. That beats out the Lincoln MKC (25.2 and 53.1 cubic feet) and Lexus NX 200t (17.7 and 54.6) but comes in just a little shy of the Acura RDX (26.1 and 61.3).\n\nMore important, perhaps, is how the Q5 stacks up cargo-wise to the Audi A4 Allroad wagon, given the vehicles are similarly sized and have similar missions. The Q5 edges out the Allroad, which has 24.2 cubic feet of cargo room behind the backseat and 58.5 with it folded, proving the Audi Q5 is more than just a lifted A4 wagon.\n\nSafety\n\nAs of publication, the 2018 Audi Q5 had not been crash-tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. Due to its redesign, the 2017 model ratings don’t apply. If the 2018 is tested, its results will appear on this page.\n\nThe Q5 continues to offer all the latest safety features, most of them optional or included in higher trim packages. Audi Pre-Sense Basic is standard but is more of a “crash preparation” system, closing the windows and moonroof, tightening safety belts, etc. Pre-Sense City is Audi’s object-detection and autonomous braking system, providing full braking up to 52 mph. Other systems, like blind spot warning, lane departure prevention with lane centering, adaptive cruise control with stop and go, turn assist, and rear cross-traffic alert are also available.\n\nA Little Expensive\n\nThe new Q5 starts at $42,475, including destination, for a base Premium trim. There are levels above this, which Audi treats as option packages: the Premium Plus, which I tested, and the Prestige. The Premium Plus Package costs another $4,000 and adds LED headlights, stainless steel trim, a panoramic moonroof, heated auto-folding mirrors and heated seats. Add navigation, 20-inch wheels, Bang & Olufsen premium audio, a cold weather package and special Florett Silver paint, and you get to our as-tested price of $52,700.\n\nThe Audi Q5 starts at a higher price than competing vehicles like the Acura RDX, Lincoln MKC and Lexus NX 200t. All those vehicles start thousands of dollars less but end up costing about the same when you option them up equally — or at least as equally as possible, considering the Audi features some things competitors simply don’t offer, like Virtual Cockpit display, an optional full-color head-up display and more.\n\nThe Audi Q5 is also nicer inside than any of its aforementioned competitors. It’s truly challenged only by the Mercedes-Benz GLC, which is even more expensive and sits on a rear-wheel-drive platform.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The second generation of Audi’s mid-size SUV has arrived just in time to capitalize on the exploding popularity of the vehicle’s compact SUV class. Competition has only gotten stiffer, but buyers have become more numerous, so Audi’s timing couldn’t be better to drop this redesigned 2018 Q5 onto our streets.\n\nThe new Q5 is a little longer, a little taller and a little bigger inside than the SUV it replaces (compare the 2017 and 2018 models here), and it features a new interior, more technology and simplified choices of drivetrains, as well. The performance-oriented SQ5, which was also redesigned for 2018, is covered separately.\n\nThe last Q5 was a competent, well-executed luxury crossover with a few quirks, including a sluggish transmission. Has Audi improved the breed with this new model?\n\nIt Looks the Business\n\nLove it or hate it, Audi’s styling is certainly consistent. Even an all-new model like the Q5 looks similar enough to the outgoing model that you might not know on sight which is newer. The Audi Q5 keeps to the program with its shield grille, swept-back smooth sides and family taillights. There is, however, something new for 2018: The hood’s cutline continues into the fenders, giving it a more seamless appearance. It’s attractive and immediately identifiable as an Audi.\n\nYou Won’t Miss the V-6\n\nLast year’s optional, supercharged 3.0-liter V-6 is gone. The new Q5 is powered by a single engine choice: a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that pumps out a healthy 252 horsepower.\n\nIt’s mated to a new seven-speed, dual-clutch automatic transmission instead of the last model’s traditional eight-speed automatic. The dual-clutch transmission routes power to the Audi Q5’s standard Quattro all-wheel drive. The engine provides plenty of power across the rev range, with lots of grunt from both a standing stop and while flying at highway speeds. The transmission shifts quickly and smoothly, with none of the odd hesitation reported from the six-speed in the previous model. On a couple of occasions, however, it did strangely cut power to the engine under some specific circumstances — nothing I could replicate reliably, but an odd sign of something not quite right with either the engine control or the transmission programming.\n\nThe Q5 also exhibited some unusual behavior when coming to a stop. The transmission didn’t seem to disengage properly, causing the engine to stutter and feel as if it were about to shut off as part of the SUV’s automatic stop-start function — even though that function was deactivated (which can be accomplished by pushing a button on the dash). These unusual performance gremlins weren’t enough to warrant a trip to the dealer, but they did make me wonder if the SUV was supposed to be behaving like this or if there was something wrong with my vehicle.\n\nThe rest of the Q5’s performance is admirable. It’s quiet, smooth, rides well and provides confident, neutral handling in most situations. Push the button to switch into Audi Drive Select’s Sport mode and throttle response gets faster, steering resistance goes up and the Audi Q5 gets a lot more entertaining. Or, for a relaxing experience guaranteed to please passengers, keep it in Comfort. The only issue I had with handling is that the steering’s return-to-center isn’t very good. It holds a corner line all too well — even beyond when you want to drive straight again, necessitating a manual adjustment when an automatic one would normally occur. It’s quirky and doesn’t happen all the time, but it’s oddly noticeable when it does.\n\nFuel economy is very good compared with the Q5’s competitors. The EPA rates the new Q5 at 23/27/25 mpg city/highway/combined, which is 3 mpg higher than the outgoing model in the city and combined. The all-wheel-drive Acura RDX achieves a rating of only 19/27/22 mpg from its standard 3.5-liter V-6, while the turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engines in both the Lexus NX 200t and AWD Lincoln MKC are rated 22/28/24 mpg and 19/25/21 mpg, respectively.\n\nSadly, Audi no longer offers a diesel engine in the Q5 in the U.S. due to its emissions-cheating scandal, so if you want better fuel economy, you’ll have to opt for the Lexus NX 300h hybrid, which is rated 33/30/31 mpg. The Q5 hybrid was discontinued after 2016 and there’s no word of a replacement.\n\nInside, Nobody Does It Better\n\nThe continued superiority of Audi’s interior quality and design is solidly represented here, with the updated cabin of the 2018 Q5 coming in at the top of the class. Excellent materials, solid-feeling switches, logical layouts, and comfortable seats with plenty of room for passengers all make for an impressive place to be. Visibility is excellent in every direction thanks to a high seating position and low beltline. Front occupants have plenty of headroom and legroom, and a slight increase in the wheelbase for 2018 seems to have improved backseat roominess, as well — no longer does it feel cramped.\n\nNotable for its appearance in the Q5 this year is Audi’s Virtual Cockpit, seen previously on other models in the Audi lineup. An option included in the Navigation Package, it replaces the traditional gauges with a full digital display behind the steering wheel, allowing for visual customization and duplication of items seen on the dashboard’s central display screen.\n\nThe multimedia system has been redone, but it’s no improvement over how Audi used to do things. The old Multi Media Interface was super-intuitive, not even requiring you to look at the buttons as you navigated on screen. The new one features a large touchpad in front of the various knobs and buttons. It’s reportedly for handwriting recognition, but I didn’t use it once. Apple CarPlay works well, however, despite needing to use the rotary selector knob to make it work. The changes to Audi MMI sadly encourage one to use Apple CarPlay or Android Auto instead, but these systems are optimized for use with a touchscreen, which the Q5 doesn’t offer.\n\nPlenty of Room for Stuff\n\nAn SUV is supposed to be about utility, and the Audi Q5 delivers. The cargo area is a spacious 26.8 cubic feet behind the backseat, expanding to 60.4 cubic feet with the seat folded. That beats out the Lincoln MKC (25.2 and 53.1 cubic feet) and Lexus NX 200t (17.7 and 54.6) but comes in just a little shy of the Acura RDX (26.1 and 61.3).\n\nMore important, perhaps, is how the Q5 stacks up cargo-wise to the Audi A4 Allroad wagon, given the vehicles are similarly sized and have similar missions. The Q5 edges out the Allroad, which has 24.2 cubic feet of cargo room behind the backseat and 58.5 with it folded, proving the Audi Q5 is more than just a lifted A4 wagon.\n\nSafety\n\nAs of publication, the 2018 Audi Q5 had not been crash-tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. Due to its redesign, the 2017 model ratings don’t apply. If the 2018 is tested, its results will appear on this page.\n\nThe Q5 continues to offer all the latest safety features, most of them optional or included in higher trim packages. Audi Pre-Sense Basic is standard but is more of a “crash preparation” system, closing the windows and moonroof, tightening safety belts, etc. Pre-Sense City is Audi’s object-detection and autonomous braking system, providing full braking up to 52 mph. Other systems, like blind spot warning, lane departure prevention with lane centering, adaptive cruise control with stop and go, turn assist, and rear cross-traffic alert are also available.\n\nA Little Expensive\n\nThe new Q5 starts at $42,475, including destination, for a base Premium trim. There are levels above this, which Audi treats as option packages: the Premium Plus, which I tested, and the Prestige. The Premium Plus Package costs another $4,000 and adds LED headlights, stainless steel trim, a panoramic moonroof, heated auto-folding mirrors and heated seats. Add navigation, 20-inch wheels, Bang & Olufsen premium audio, a cold weather package and special Florett Silver paint, and you get to our as-tested price of $52,700.\n\nThe Audi Q5 starts at a higher price than competing vehicles like the Acura RDX, Lincoln MKC and Lexus NX 200t. All those vehicles start thousands of dollars less but end up costing about the same when you option them up equally — or at least as equally as possible, considering the Audi features some things competitors simply don’t offer, like Virtual Cockpit display, an optional full-color head-up display and more.\n\nThe Audi Q5 is also nicer inside than any of its aforementioned competitors. It’s truly challenged only by the Mercedes-Benz GLC, which is even more expensive and sits on a rear-wheel-drive platform.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Audi Q5?\n\nThe Audi Q5 is a five-seat compact luxury SUV with standard all-wheel drive and a choice of four powertrains. Motivating the base Q5 is a 201-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder paired with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. A 261-hp turbo four-cylinder is next, followed by the 349-hp, turbo 3.0-liter V-6 found in the performance-oriented SQ5.  If spending less at the pump is a priority, the Q5 also offers a plug-in hybrid variant, the Q5 e, that’s powered by an electric motor and a gas-fed turbo four-cylinder engine. Total output is a stout 362 hp, and it has an EPA-rated electric-only range of up to 23 miles.\n\nThe Q5 is notable for being offered in both standard SUV format and as the Q5 Sportback, which features a coupelike exterior design. Competitors include the BMW X3, Acura RDX, Lincoln Corsair and Volvo XC60.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Audi Q5?\n\nAdaptive cruise control is newly standard in all Q5 and SQ5 models. The Premium Plus trim gains a Bang & Olufsen sound system.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Audi Q5 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nAdaptive cruise control\n10.1-inch infotainment screen\nWireless Apple CarPlay, wired Android Auto\nWireless device charging\nWi-Fi hot spot\nDigital gauge cluster\nTri-zone climate control\nPower liftgate\nLeather seating\nHeated front seats\nBlind spot monitoring\nRear cross-traffic alert\nLane departure warning\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nHeated steering wheel\nSurround-view camera\nPanoramic roof\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nNappa leather upholstery\nAdaptive air suspension\nHead-up instrument display\nBang & Olufsen stereo \nShould I Buy the 2023 Audi Q5?\n\nThe Audi Q5 offers luxury SUV shoppers a wide range of engines, plus the peace of mind of standard all-wheel drive. Keep in mind, though, that this Audi’s option sheet is an expensive place to spend your time; the Q5’s price swells as you add features or move to models like the plug-in hybrid Q5 e or sporty SQ5. The cabin is, however, elegantly appointed and comfortable, and the infotainment system is easy to operate and quick to respond to driver inputs. The Sportback sacrifices some utility for style, so we’d stick with the Q5’s standard SUV configuration.",

      "expert_review": "Entering its sixth year, the second-generation Audi Q5 remains the brand’s bestselling vehicle and continues to be priced and sized to appeal to a vast pool of potential buyers. The luxury SUV offers a broad selection of powertrains, while its Sportback version offers the same basic mechanical package with a sleeker roofline. For the new model year, the Q5, SQ5 and Q5 Sportback get new standard equipment as well as new starting prices.\n\nRelated: How Do Car Seats Fit in a 2022 Audi Q5 Sportback?\n\nWhat’s New for 2024\n\nFor 2024, Audi continues to offer the Q5 in three trim levels: Premium, Premium Plus and Prestige. The full Q5 family receives adaptive cruise control, lane departure steering assist and a heated steering wheel as standard equipment, and all but the plug-in hybrid also add remote starting via the myAudi app.\n\nInside, sport seats and birch wood trim are standard on the Q5 45, while a newly available Black Optic Package blacks out the exterior trim and roof rails on the Q5 40’s Premium Plus and Prestige trims. On 45, 55 and 45 Sportback variants, the package also blacks out the Audi rings and model badging, front splitter, air intakes and rear diffuser, and inside, it adds a black headliner and perforated leather steering wheel. The brake calipers aren’t black, however; they’re red.\n\nAll Q5 Premium Plus variants also now get a six-month trial subscription to the app store’s Audi Connect Plus, which gives access to music, video, navigation, parking and charging information, and more via the SUV’s infotainment system.\n\nPowertrain Specs\n\nThe two digits appended to the Q5 badge — 40, 45, or 55 — refer to the engine output. The Q5 40 has a 201-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder; the Q5 45 gets a 261-hp version of the same engine. With its electric motor and a 17.9-kilowatt-hour battery, the Q5 55 PHEV has a system output of up to 362 hp. The SQ5 engages in no such silliness: It’s just an SQ5 powered by a 349-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6.\n\nThe Q5 models have a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission, while the SQ5 has an eight-speed automatic. All-wheel drive is standard.\n\nPricing and Availability\n\nThe 2024 Q5 and SQ5 lineup will go on sale later this year. Pricing is as follows (all prices include a $1,195 destination charge).\n\nQ5\nQ5 40: $45,795\nQ5 45: $48,695\nQ5 55 (PHEV): $58,995\nQ5 Sportback 45: $52,695\nSQ5\nSQ5: $58,195\nSQ5 Sportback: $61,595\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2023 Audi Q5, SQ5 See New Equipment, Price Increases in New Year\n2021 Audi SQ5 Review: Not as Racy as It Looks, and That’s OK\n2021 Audi Q5 Vs. 2021 Lincoln Corsair: Which Plug-in Hybrid Luxury SUV Should You Buy?\n2021 Audi Q5 Sportback Review: As Practical as It Can Be\nWhich Cars Have Panoramic Moonroofs or Sunroofs?\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Are the Audi Q5 and SQ5 Good SUVs?\n\nUpdates to both versions of Audi’s bestselling Q5 family keep them technologically up to date and allow them to maintain a level of comfort, style and performance that luxury compact SUV buyers are looking for.\n\nHow Do the Audi Q5 and SQ5 Compare With Other Compact Luxury SUVs?\n\nThe Q5 and SQ5 have class-leading screen technology, and the SQ5 is the most fun to drive of the mid-level sporty luxury compact SUVs currently on sale, but the Q5 and SQ5 are still relatively anonymous-looking compared to the polarizing BMW X3 and stylish Genesis GV70.\n\nFor 2025, Audi is selling two versions of its bestselling Q5 compact SUV: the previous generation and an all-new version with updated styling, new interior technology and enhanced powertrains. The all-new Q5 family gets more horsepower and torque than its predecessors, as well as revised steering to go along with more expressive exterior styling and vastly improved interior technology.\nRelated: New 2025 Audi Q5 and Q5 Sportback: Daring New Look for the Brand’s Bestseller\nTo find out if this new generation is an improvement, I headed to Colorado to drive both the 2025 Q5 and SQ5 (per Cars.com’s ethics policy, we pay for our travel and lodging costs when attending such manufacturer-sponsored events). The versions I drove were fully loaded Prestige variants; the Q5 carried an as-tested price tag of $63,290, while the SQ5 was $74,740 (all prices include a $1,295 destination fee).\nRelated Video:\n\n  \n    \n\n  \n    What’s New With the 2025 Audi Q5 and SQ5?\nThe updates begin outside with more expressive and dynamic exterior styling. It makes both the Q5 and SQ5 look somewhat less anonymous than previous generations, but I don’t think they have nearly as much pizazz as the also recently refreshed 2026 Genesis GV70. Audi has also updated the exterior lighting for the Q5 family, and with the top-of-the-line LED headlights and organic light-emitting diode taillights, owners can choose from eight different patterns for the daytime running lights and rear taillamps — adjustable from either the central touchscreen or Audi’s smartphone app — for increased personalization. Is that cool or interesting? Possibly to you, but not to me.\nInside, the most noteworthy updates are the new Audi Stage infotainment suite and some updated driver controls. Audi Stage is made up of the familiar Virtual Cockpit, featuring an 11.9-inch digital instrument panel and a new 14.5-inch center touchscreen. The SUV’s touch-sensitive climate controls are in a fixed position in the lower portion of the touchscreen rather than physical controls like the previous Q5 or in an annoying secondary touchscreen like the larger Q7. The steering-wheel and driver’s door-panel controls, however, take a step backward, as they’re now touch-sensitive panels sectioned off into different functions.\nWhat Is the New Interior of the Q5 and SQ5 Like?\n\n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    Inside is where the real show happens because the new Audi Stage technology suite lives up to its name and takes center stage. It’s a marked improvement over Audi’s previous infotainment technology; more responsive, more intuitive and with thoroughly modern graphics. The native navigation system works well, and wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are standard if you prefer to use a smartphone navigation app. While physical climate controls are typically preferable to touchscreen-based ones, the Q5’s at least don’t obscure other portions of the screen during interactions.\nNot part of the Audi Stage (and a bit confusing to me) is the available 10.9-inch passenger screen that’s included on the Prestige trim. It can control navigation and audio and even show YouTube videos, but it feels redundant in an era of smartphones. Surely, if you can use this display and not get motion sickness, you can probably do the same with a smartphone or tablet and have access to all of your preferred apps and content. Additionally, the passenger screen uses something Audi calls “active shuttering,” which only obscures it from the driver’s view in certain situations. I’d prefer it to remain invisible to the driver 100% of the time, as I found it distracting when it was visible while I was driving.\nMaterials quality is excellent; the Q5 has a more relaxed and luxurious vibe, highlighted by wood trim, while the SQ5 swaps the wood for carbon fiber and adds simulated-suede accents. Backseat space is adequate for the class; at 6-foot-1, I have enough space behind the driver’s seat set to my preferred position to sit somewhat comfortably, but with no extra room to stretch out. The backseat slides and reclines for potentially more comfort. Really, the only significant flaws in the interior are the touch-sensitive controls on the steering wheel and driver’s door — they’re clumsy to use, and the steering-wheel controls especially are prone to unintentional inputs during spirited driving. As Audi’s parent, Volkswagen, works to correct this mistake in its vehicles, it’s frustrating to see it appear in the Audi lineup — particularly the bestselling Q5.\nHow Does the 2025 Q5 Drive?\n\n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    Power comes from a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine making 268 horsepower and 295 pounds-feet of torque. That’s 7 hp and 22 pounds-feet more than the previous four-cylinder-powered Q5 — not a lot more, for sure, but more nonetheless. A seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission is standard, as is all-wheel drive. The powertrain is smooth and adequately powerful, with the dual-clutch automatic shifting intelligently enough that it never got in its own way during my drive. The transmission also handled low-speed driving without causing any powertrain shuddering.\nComfort, not sportiness, is king in the Q5, and while the steering and suspension have been updated to provide better feedback, the Q5 doesn’t beat up occupants. Even over washboard dirt roads, bumps are impressively isolated from both the seats and the steering wheel. The Q5 I tested included Off-Road and Off-Road Plus modes along with Comfort, Balanced and Dynamic settings, but there’s little noticeable difference between them. Dynamic firms up the steering and the available air suspension a smidge, while Comfort dials up the softness and Balanced allows for an in-between setting. The result remains the same: The Q5 is pleasant to drive.\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2025 Audi Q5 Gains New Packages, Starts at $46,695\nTariffs on Mexican, Canadian and Chinese Goods Could Affect These Cars the Most\n7 Audi SUVs Earn IIHS Top Safety Pick Awards\nResearch the 2025 Audi Q5\nResearch the 2025 Audi SQ5\n\nHow Does the 2025 SQ5 Drive?\n\n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    In the SQ5, things are far more raucous. It gets the same transmission and standard AWD, but under the hood is a turbo 3.0-liter V-6 that now makes 362 hp and 406 pounds-feet of torque — 13 hp and 37 pounds-feet more than before. It sounds fantastic, too, with a natural growl and burble that feels rare in today’s world of artificial exhaust augmentation.\nWhere the Q5 is well rounded, the SQ5 is much sharper, using the updated steering and its sport-oriented adaptive air suspension to great effect. It corners with minimal body roll and just a hint of understeer, and retains much of the Q5’s comfort when not in its Dynamic mode — and even in Dynamic, the ride is still fairly comfortable. In both SUVs, the seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission usually shifts intelligently and downshifts very aggressively, but it occasionally holds onto gears a bit too long in its Sport setting, which is activated automatically in Dynamic mode. Having just driven the new Genesis GV70 with its twin-turbo V-6 and liking it a great deal, I think I’d lean SQ5 if given the choice between the two; it’s just a bit more fun to drive.\nAre the New 2025 Audi Q5 and SQ5 Better Than Before?\nAbsolutely. With the exception of some very annoying controls, the updated Q5 family improves on what was already a winning formula, making the new 2025 Q5 and SQ5 the best versions of Audi’s bestseller.\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
