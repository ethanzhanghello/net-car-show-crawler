      "expert_review": "As with many things, when you don’t have expectations they can’t be crushed. Somehow I missed all the hoopla over the 2012 Audi A7 at this year’s auto shows (apparently I was busy hunting down more stereotypically family-centric cars). Let me tell you, I was anything but crushed by the A7. I was pleasantly surprised by this large hatchback’s combination of performance driving ability, smooth ride quality and family-friendly backseat space and functional trunk. However, be advised this car seats four, so it’s only suited to small families.\n\nThe A7’s drive quality was the perfect fit for me. Audi’s Quattro full-time all-wheel-drive system in the A7 is an absolute must for the crazy weather patterns I experience south of Denver. The A7 somehow manages to be simultaneously powerful and well-connected to the road in corners while still featuring a suspension designed to keep my brain cells in tact rather than wiggled and jiggled free like other “sporty” cars. The one annoyance I noticed was a slight delayed jerk when the A7 shifted down at low speeds, for example when slowing down to creep through the carpool lane.\n\nAs the old saying goes, you get what you pay for. The A7 is worth every penny of the $68,630 price tag that my test car topped out at; the base price is $59,250. For a small family who doesn’t need to fit more than one or two kids in the car but still has the cargo-carrying needs that every family has, the A7 caters to this crew with a luxurious, modern and distinctly stylized car. You’ll be lucky to keep yours. I was extremely disappointed to have to return my test car.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe all-new Audi A7 is distinct-looking. It starts with those flirty, feminine eyelash LEDs in the front that I absolutely love. The feminine line of the car flows back and ends with a muscular-looking back end. The A7 is a car that both my husband and I would love to be in as a daily drive, but it’s still sophisticated enough to take us from a grocery store run to a kid-free sushi date night.\n\nWhile all that sounds like fun, the A7 is full of function, as well. When I opened the hatchback for the first time, an audible gasp escaped me and could be heard from many cars away. I have no idea how Audi managed to get such a large cargo space in this vehicle that drives so much smaller. On top of the impressive size, the hatch opens remotely via a button on the key fob, on the hatch itself or from the driver’s side door. All parents deserve the helping hand of a power liftgate!\n\nWhile the cargo space is huge and the second-row legroom is also greater than expected, the rear door openings feel a little narrow for an adult. I also wished it opened wider to help those of us having to worm child-safety seats into the back.\n\nThe A7 manages to look naturally strong without appearing to have been injected with synthetic steroids or “herbal” growth hormones, though the 310-horsepower, supercharged 3.0-liter V-6 engine might make you think that it has been. The A7 uses premium gas and gets an EPA-estimated 18/28 mpg city/highway.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great (for small families)\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Groove-On\n\nINTERIOR\nWith such a clean, striking-looking exterior design, the A7’s interior doesn’t really match it. It felt like it was screaming for a modernized, simplified Scandinavian interior like a Volvo-esque floating center console with a Bang & Olufsen-inspired control panel.\n\nAfter years of test-driving Audis, I’m still not a fan of the automaker’s Multi Media Interface system. MMI controls everything from the navigation system to the audio system as well as many other vehicle controls. The center dial spins left and right as well as depresses for an “enter” function. The center dial is surrounded by four overview buttons, which are surrounded by more buttons. This whole system can also be accessed with steering-wheel controls, too. On top of that, there’s also a touchpad — much like that on a laptop — to help control things. Honestly, I’d rather just have a touch-screen display where I see the menu option I want and touch it. Simple.\n\nWhat I did like in the A7 were the heated and ventilated front seats and the ability for rear passengers to control their own thermostat.\n\nWhile there wasn’t a ton of storage spaces within the A7, there were small pockets in each of the four doors, netted pockets on the back of both front seats, two cupholders for the front passengers and two more within the center armrest for the rear passengers. It’s just enough to get the job done.\n\nThe A7 only has two seats in the back, but it will fit two adults and their legs. Bonus! My daughters (both in booster seats) had plenty of room to dangle their growing legs freely without “accidentally” and repetitively kicking the back of my seat.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore\n\nSAFETY\nAudi’s always been great about considering us parents, and the A7 is no exception with extremely easy-to-access lower Latch anchors. The two sets are right in the open of the seat bight with removable plastic covers that keep them from collecting crud when not in use. I wish the plastic covers were hinged, however. Remembering where they’re stored — possibly years after they were removed — could be problematic.\n\nThe ample backseat legroom in the A7 also means that there’s enough space for rear-facing child-safety seats. However, the slightly bucketed seats might create a love-hate relationship for parents of kids in booster seats. If your child’s booster seat is narrow enough to fit in the seat without covering the seat belt buckle, you’ll be golden. Wider booster seats will make it tough for little ones to buckle in on their own. Find out how the A7 did in MotherProof.com’s Car Seat Check here.\n\nBeyond kid safety, I loved the optional Audi Side Assist system that monitors my blind spots and lets me know if there’s another car there by flashing a large light on the corresponding side mirror. Having dealt with a slew of neck and back problems recently, I also appreciated the adjustable head restraints. By pressing a button on the side of the head restraint, I could adjust it back or forth to find the most comfortable angle.\n\nThe Audi A7 comes equipped with standard all-wheel drive, antilock brakes, an electronic stability system, traction control and eight airbags, including dual front knee airbags and side curtains for both rows. Optional safety features include side-impact airbags for the rear outboard seats, adaptive xenon headlights and adaptive cruise control with forward collision warning.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2012 Audi A7 here.",

      "expert_review": "One of the more unique vehicles in the Audi lineup, the 2017 A7 still carries much of the same styling and feel that it had when it debuted as a 2012 model. Even though that makes it a little long in the tooth, it doesn’t feel like a negative: This is an old-un, but a good-un.\n\nThe long, swept profile is something the Audi A7 shares with its body-type competitors, the BMW 6 Series Gran Coupe, Mercedes-Benz CLS-Class and Porsche Panamera. Compare the Audi A7 with its competitors here and to last year’s A7 model here.\n\nFor 2017, the biggest change for the A7 is the introduction of a new Competition trim level, which is the version I tested. It adds a bit more horsepower, a sport suspension and slight exterior modifications.\n\nExterior\n\nThe Audi A7 has been one of my favorite designs from Audi since its inception, perhaps because the the gentle A7 Sportback curve looks so different from the rest of the lineup (although with the new A5 Sportback coming, that will no longer be the case). The proportions and that long, sloping rear glass make it stand out when compared with the more conventional sedan styling found on the A4 and A6.\n\nThe Competition trim adds a few exterior flourishes to spruce up the exterior even further, but they will take a trained eye to spot if comparing the standard model. A gloss-black “Singleframe” grille and black side-mirror housings, red brake calipers, 20-inch wheels and a modified front bumper make the package subtly more aggressive.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThe A7 Competition uses the same supercharged 3.0-liter V-6 found in standard A7 models but gets a few tweaks that bump up horsepower from 333 hp to a round 340; torque numbers remain the same, however, at 325 pounds-feet. It is mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission with paddle shifters. Quattro all-wheel drive is standard as well, and on the A7 adds a sport differential that can shift torque side to side between the rear wheels works well with the engine and transmission.\n\nThis is an engine that outperforms its spec sheet. The 340 hp won’t turn heads in this class, but it was plenty of power given the engine’s responsiveness. It moves with haste and, unlike some vehicles with forced induction, the throttle is responsive and controlled. There is no turbo lag with sudden rushes of power to step the car out, just an even blast forward.\n\nI also enjoyed the Quattro A7’s agility — it doesn’t drive like a large car. The sport suspension and differential work in concert, slinging the A7 out of corners with much more verve than I was expecting. My only complaint about driving the A7 would be its steering, but that is an issue we have with most Audis generally more than the A7 specifically. The handling is light for my tastes off-center. I’d like a bit more feedback.\n\nFuel economy figures for the A7 Competition are 21/29/24 mpg city/highway/combined on recommended premium gasoline. This doesn’t seem like much, but it actually puts the A7 near the top of its competition — these luxury sedans are all pretty thirsty.\n\nInterior and Technology\n\nBesides the performance upgrades, the Audi A7 Competition features standard sport seats in Valcona leather with diamond stitching both front and rear. The front leather seats have 12-way power adjustments and are heated, and our new Audi A7 also had the Cold Weather Package ($500) that added a heated steering wheel and heated rear seats as well. I want to install a pair of those front seats in my house; they’re comfortable and supportive without being too tight or firm.\n\nI had only two problems with the interior: First, the Competition trim level seats only four people rather than the standard five. Second, the technology is due for an update.\n\nThis is still the Audi A7 Sportback’s first generation. A refresh in 2015 updated the interior, and Audi has added more variants over the years, but the car still exists in more or less the same form. This is fine for the timeless coupe-like silhouette and the superb interior fit and finish — but on the technology front, the A7 does fall a little flat.\n\nMost of that has to do with the MMI multifunction controller on the center console between the front seats, which is the only way to control many features plus the audio choices. The high-mounted head-up display isn’t a touchscreen; all inputs must be made with the controller knob, and that makes using the system cumbersome. It does offer Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, which have greater functionality. But those systems are optimized for touchscreens, and using them with a controller feels a bit foreign.\n\nIt would also be nice to have some of the technology Audi has in other cars in its lineup, such as the Audi Virtual Cockpit all-digital and all-LED instrument panel and charging options (12-volt or USB) in the backseat.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Audi A7 starts at $69,750 (including destination charges), with Competition models like our test vehicle starting at $77,500. It also added the aforementioned Cold Weather Package and the Driver Assistance Plus Package ($2,450), which adds autonomous emergency braking, automatic high beams, adaptive cruise control with stop and go, lane departure prevention and corner-view cameras. The final sticker price was $80,450, which is a hefty chunk of change considering that the performance-oriented S7 starts at virtually the same price ($80,850).\n\nThe S7 might be the best competition for the A7 Competition. Evaluated in its own space, the Audi A7 really is quite good. The driving experience matches the price and so does the interior quality and styling, but the S7 offers even more of those things for not much more money (relatively). Though this is a great car and worth its price tag, I’d argue Audi may just be cannibalizing itself.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Audi A7?\n\nThe Audi A7 combines a tapered roofline and coupelike style with a dose of cargo-toting practicality thanks to a handy rear hatchback and spacious trunk. Granted, accessing the backseat is awkward thanks to the A7’s sleek shape, and its look-at-me design takes a chunk out of headroom back there. Thankfully, though, the A7 is more than just a pretty face: Its standard powertrain consists of a 335-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 engine paired with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission, along with Audi’s Quattro all-wheel drive. If straight-line speed is what you’re after, and you don’t mind paying for it, the S7 is motivated by a 444-hp, twin-turbocharged 2.9-liter V-6, and the even mightier RS 7 comes with a bellowing 621-hp, twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8. The A7’s competitors include the BMW 5 Series, Mercedes-Benz E-Class, Genesis G80 and Porsche Panamera. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Audi A7?\n\nThe A7 and S7 get a new honeycomb grille design for 2024, along with other minor trim updates. All models now come with a six-month trial subscription to Audi Connect Plus remote-access features. Remote start is available through the Audi Connect app, and a new Adaptive Cruise Assist display is included with the Convenience Package, which is available on the Premium trim and standard on the Premium Plus and higher. \n\nPremium Plus and above trims also get multicolored ambient LED interior lighting, while the Executive Package — which is optional on the Premium Plus trim and standard above that — now includes dual-pane acoustic glass and traffic-sign recognition. \n\nAn extensive update to the RS 7 (which is now offered solely in a Performance trim level) brings an additional 30 hp, raising output to 621 hp. Combined with lighter 22-inch wheels and a 17-pound reduction in sound deadening, the result is a quicker 0-60 mph acceleration time of 3.3 seconds. Other revisions include numerous interior and exterior trim updates. \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Audi A7 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nAWD\n12.3-inch digital instrument cluster\nPanoramic moonroof\nSatellite radio\nDual-touchscreen interface\nWireless Apple CarPlay, wired Android Auto \nPower liftgate\nLeather seating \nHeated front seats\nTri-zone automatic climate control\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nVentilated front seats\nHeated rear seats\nHeated steering wheel\nBang & Olufsen premium stereo\nMassage function for front seats\nHead-up instrument display\n360-degree parking camera system\nAutomated parking system\nSoft-close doors\nShould I Buy the 2024 Audi A7?\n\nThe Audi A7 is agile, comfortable and quick, even with its base powertrain. Fuel economy is respectable, and the cargo space accessed through the wide-opening rear hatch is extremely generous for a mid-size luxury sedan. It’s not perfect, however: Rear headroom is tight for tall adults, visibility is limited to the sides and rear, and the A7’s price is steep — even more so when considering the S7 and RS 7 performance models.",

The S7 gains a Nardo Sport Edition Package that adds unique trim features inside and out. \n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Audi A7 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nAWD\n12.3-inch digital instrument cluster\nPanoramic moonroof\nSatellite radio\nDual-touchscreen interface\nWireless Apple CarPlay, wired Android Auto \nPower liftgate\nLeather seating \nHeated front seats\nTri-zone automatic climate control\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nVentilated front seats\nHeated rear seats\nHeated steering wheel\nBang & Olufsen premium stereo\nMassage function for front seats\nHead-up instrument display\n360-degree parking camera system\nAutomated parking system\nSoft-close doors\nShould I Buy the 2025 Audi A7?\n\nThe Audi A7 is agile, comfortable and quick, even with its base powertrain. Fuel economy is respectable, and the cargo area accessed through the wide-opening rear hatch is extremely generous for a mid-size luxury sedan. It’s not perfect, however: Rear headroom is tight for tall adults, visibility is limited to the sides and rear, and the A7’s price is steep — especially when considering the S7 and RS 7 performance models.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in May 2011 about the 2012 Audi A7. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2013, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThere are luxury cars with better performance or roomier backseats, and there are luxury SUVs with more utility, but the swoopy Audi A7 is a sexy hatchback with performance and personality to match.\n\nBased on the next-generation A6 sedan, the A7 is priced nearly identically to the BMW 535 Gran Turismo, a luxury hatchback that certainly doesn’t win the matchup on looks.\n\nWhile the hatchbacks’ engines offer similar power, the two have distinctly different personalities on the road. They’re different inside as well: The BMW is a more luxurious cruiser, while the A7 aims for sport-sedan status.\n\nLooks\nAudi made its R8 supercar a movie star, placing it center stage in the popular “Iron Man” film franchise. That car’s aggressive front end is clearly mimicked on the A7, but that’s where the hatch’s resemblance to current Audis ends.\n\nThe back end has a sloping rear window, as you’d expect, but the end of the car is truncated, as if a knife cut off the end of a loaf of French bread. An upward kink creates a lip spoiler, and there’s a retractable spoiler hidden in a small amount of space on the deck lid.\n\nYou could just say the A7 is gorgeous and stop discussing design elements. During my few days piloting our Garnett Red test car, my neighbors, fellow commuters and one nice lady filling up her BMW next to me at a gas station all clearly envied me.\n\nInterior\nAudi’s A8 flagship sedan is opulent inside, with suede lining the doors and plush leather seats. The A7 — despite the single-digit difference in its name — is a vastly different vehicle, with a starting price $20,000 less than the A8’s. The interior is patterned after sport coupes, with a black dashboard trimmed in metal finishes.\n\nOur tester was decked out in black leather with dark ash wood trim, and it was not a pleasing combination. A dark walnut trim is available, and perhaps either one with the available beige or dark brown leather interior would be more appealing. Frankly, I’d prefer a carbon fiber or metallic finish with the black to accentuate its sports-car attitude.\n\nThe driver’s seat was comfortable, and it was easy to find the proper driving position. The rear seat wasn’t as accommodating.\n\nWhile the BMW 535 GT is based off the larger 7 Series and features a voluminous backseat, the A7 is based on the midsize A6, and there was barely enough knee room for my 5-foot-10 frame with the driver’s seat positioned for me. Legroom back there is a scant 37 inches, versus the BMW’s 41.8 inches. The more expensive Mercedes-Benz CLS 550 has just 35 inches.\n\nThe moonroof also takes away a lot of headroom, so there’s a bubble carved out of the roof lining for rear passengers’ heads.\n\nThat also means the moonroof itself isn’t very big. Personally, I’d prefer the glass roof Audi has on its A5 coupe, to create more headroom and make the cabin brighter. As it is, the moonroof doesn’t offer much light or create an open-air feeling, even when it’s open.\n\nYour rear passengers won’t be completely cramped, but they won’t be able to relax much. In the end, this is still a driver’s car.\n\nPerformance\nThe A7 is available with just one engine, and it’s a good one: a 310-horsepower, supercharged V-6 teamed with an eight-speed automatic transmission. An optional Sport Package adds shift paddles to the steering wheel for manual gear changes.\n\nIt’s a fun, high-revving engine that feels faster than its power rating suggests. That’s thanks to the car’s relatively light weight: It’s almost 500 pounds lighter than a BMW 535 GT, which sports a 300-hp, turbocharged six-cylinder.\n\nOur tester included a $1,500 option package that added stunning 20-inch wheels, a three-spoke steering wheel with shift paddles, and a sport suspension.\n\nYou can shift the car manually by throwing the shift knob to the right, where it will stay until you pop it back over, then moving the knob up or down in the gate to shift through the gears. If you have the Sport Package, the same thing can be accomplished by giving shift paddles on the steering wheel a quick tap.\n\nI, however, preferred pushing the shifter down from Drive into S, for the automatic sport mode. It isn’t a gate unto itself; push down once and it returns to the D position, then shows the S designation in the gauge cluster. This mode sharpens accelerator response and allows you to shift using the paddles, but reverts to the regular Drive setting if you fail to shift repeatedly. The faster response from the accelerator pedal is still there, though, whether you shift manually or not. You can turn it back to the Drive mode with a quick push back down. You can also manually shift when just in Drive, but the characteristics of Sport mode are not in place.\n\nThe firmer suspension wasn’t overly firm, but it clearly was not a cruiser, like the BMW.\n\nThe speed-sensitive steering for which Audi is so well known — often not in a good way — may be at its best in the A7. Typically, Audi aims for an extremely loose wheel at low speeds, so if you’re navigating a parking garage you have to turn the wheel around like it’s attached to a 1980s arcade game. It’s a little firmer in the A7, but the incremental change builds at around-town speeds and is at its best in the most aggressive driving situations.\n\nBMW’s steering is typically so firm it gives your arms a workout at all speeds, but the latest 5 and 7 Series are much lighter at low speeds. Still, they’re nowhere near Audi’s relaxed wheel.\n\nBraking in the A7 is solid and linear — another difference between it and the BMW. New BMWs are integrating regenerative braking systems, similar to those in hybrids, for better efficiency. However, they also leave a lot to be desired when it comes to pure brake feel, and the A7 is almost as efficient as the BMW 535 GT with all-wheel drive. The A7 is rated 18/28 mpg city/highway, versus 19/27 mpg for the BMW. Both require premium gas.\n\nFeatures\nYou get a fair number of features for the A7 Premium’s base price of $59,250. (Yes, Audi calls all its base trims “Premium.”) The A7 Premium comes standard with leather, keyless start and those trademark LED daytime running lights.\n\nMove up to the Premium Plus version, like our tester, for $62,870, and you’ll also get 19-inch wheels, navigation and parking sensors.\n\nThen there’s the Prestige model, which starts at $65,580 and adds a power tilt/telescoping steering wheel, xenon headlights, four-zone climate control and a Bose sound system. Audi’s impressive Bang & Olufsen sound system is the Prestige model’s only option, and it costs an additional $5,900.\n\nI enjoyed our test car’s assortment of features, which included Audi’s new navigation system. The A7 Premium Plus I drove seemed almost reasonable at $66,000 as-tested, but it lacked keyless entry. All A7s — perhaps all Audis — should include keyless entry as well as keyless start. Many Nissans, Fords and even Kias are available with that feature for half the cost of the Prestige model, which is the only A7 to offer it.\n\nThe navigation system is downright beautiful, using Google’s satellite imagery. The A7 also comes with an optional wireless internet system that uses 3G signals to create up to eight Wi-Fi access points. During my test, I found it as responsive as my 3G iPhone, which was faster using its own connection than it was using the Audi’s.\n\nHowever, the 3G system can also deliver news, weather and points of interest for the navigation system. That’s instead of using satellite signals, like competitors do with SiriusXM Satellite Radio. The A7 has satellite radio, too, of course, so I’m not sure where the advantage is, besides creating the wireless hotspots, which don’t seem like much of an advantage. I would, though, still advise buyers to get the navigation system, as it’s one of the better systems I’ve tested when it comes to the basics of getting you where you want to go.\n\nThe dazzling pop-up LCD screen is standard on all A7s, with or without navigation.\n\nCargo\nHow does the shapely … shape of the new A7 impact its practicality? Not much. There’s 24.5 cubic feet of cargo room in the back, and it’s a deep cargo area — perfect for golf clubs.\n\nThe curved glass, though, makes it nearly impossible to keep dogs secured in the cargo area with the rear seats in place. I had to put them down to transport my 65-pound boxer to the vet for a routine checkup. The seats created a relatively flat surface for her, but I could tell she preferred our station wagon’s taller rear digs.\n\nSafety\nThe A7 has the standard array of airbags, as well as a number of optional safety systems we’ve seen proliferate in the luxury market. Adaptive cruise control with a collision-warning system is available, as is night vision assistance — a feature for which we’ve found little use when not traveling deer-patrolled rural roads in the dead of night.\n\nOur tester had a $500 blind spot warning system that Audi calls “side assist.” Instead of featuring lights on the interior of the car or in the mirrors themselves, there are three LEDs housed in a black panel inside the exterior of the mirror.\n\nIt’s an odd decision, and one that doesn’t look too pleasing, either. The real problem, though, was that the system wasn’t very accurate. Several times, they flashed long after a car had passed me, or when I had plenty of room to merge. These systems are commonplace these days, even on typical midsize sedans, and I’ve seen them work better on most cars that have them.\n\nAudi A7 in the Market\nThere’s no real need for the A7 in Audi’s lineup. Buyers could get an A6 sedan with the same engine for less money without sacrificing much utility. They could also choose a Q5 or Q7 SUV and get more utility, along with a sacrifice in performance. That said, though, the A7 does blend driving pleasure and practical luxury — and it does so in a beautiful wrapper.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Audi’s sleek, striking A7 has long held prime real estate in my dream garage, and the redesigned 2019 model solidifies that spot: Its just-right blend of elegance and excitement has been enhanced by the user-friendly multimedia system it so sorely lacked.\n\nVersus the competition: The A7 matches its rivals in terms of power and luxury, and new tech and safety features for 2019 keep it competitive.\n\nFor 2019, the A7 got some subtle styling tweaks that freshen its look but don’t diminish its hallmark sleek and sloping silhouette. The big news is inside and under the hood: a clean-sheet multimedia system redesign and a new powertrain. Compare it with the 2018 model.\n\nThe A7 competes against other luxury sedans with coupelike profiles, such as the BMW 6 Series and Mercedes-Benz CLS; see them compared.\n\nFrom Super to Turbo\n\nBehind the wheel, the A7 masterfully blends elements of sport and comfort, making it stand out in the class. Power comes on strong without being obnoxious, and its ride is gentler than the previous generation’s.\n\nSome editors thought this model’s focus on comfort cost it its handling edge, but to me the A7 has only been made more accessible. Yes, there’s a bit more body lean in corners in the 2019, but it remains admirably crisp and composed. It also has a slightly smaller turning radius, so it’s more maneuverable than its length suggests.\n\nThe A7’s new comfort-bias tuning also benefits its ride: Air springs are optional, but my test car rode on the standard coil springs and optional 20-inch wheels, and it serenely navigated Chicago’s pothole season with little fuss.\n\nThe sole powertrain this year is a 335-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 paired with a seven-speed automatic transmission. (More powerful S7 and RS 7 versions were last sold as 2018 models.) It replaces a supercharged V-6 and eight-speed automatic. Horsepower is nearly unchanged, but torque increases from 325 to 369 pounds-feet. Again, all-wheel drive is standard.\n\nAfter just a hint of turbo lag, power delivery is prompt and smooth, meshing with subtle, well-timed shifts. There are four driver-selectable drive modes: Auto, Comfort, Dynamic and a configurable Individual mode. I found Dynamic most engaging, as it makes the engine even more responsive.\n\nThe engine gets a modest boost — both in pep and fuel economy — from a new 48-volt mild-hybrid system. A 16-hp motor-generator captures energy under deceleration and stores it in a battery under the trunk floor, as well as enabling an unobtrusive stop-start system. Fuel economy improved just a bit, with the EPA rating the 2019 A7 22/29/25 mpg city/highway/combined. That’s up from the 2018’s 20/29/23 mpg.\n\nMore Screen Time\n\nAs with the previous generation, the A7’s cabin raises the bar: It’s refined, lovely and what you’d expect from a luxury sedan. The design is clean and classy, and everything looks and feels appropriately upscale — especially the matte wood trim, which is plentiful.\n\nWhat’s new — and will likely take some getting used to — is Audi’s switch to an almost completely screen-based control setup (the lone holdout is a volume knob). In place of the old wheel and trackpad are a pair of touchscreens, which are standard across the lineup. The two high-resolution displays and a single row of touch-sensitive buttons now control everything from multimedia to climate settings. It’s a welcome change from the previous system’s fussy, confounding setup.\n\nOverall, I found the system much easier to figure out and use than the old version. Like mealtimes with my twin 4-year-olds, the old knob-based twist-and-click system was a patience-tester I never did get comfortable controlling. With the new version, functions take fewer actions to complete, so things are quicker and less distracting to do while driving.\n\nThe upper screen is a 10.1-inch display that’s angled toward the driver and displays most functions, including audio and navigation. An 8.6-inch lower display houses climate and comfort settings. One icon on the lower screen enables a particularly helpful feature. It’s not super-clear what it is, given the icon is three empty boxes, but becomes clear once you press it: It allows you to add shortcuts to the lower screen — things like radio stations, phone contacts and navigation destinations.\n\nMy time with the system was not without some hiccups. First, though it looks like a touchscreen, it feels more like a touch-sensitive panel, which requires more of a push. I often had to touch it more than once, which got annoying, though you can turn on a haptic response feature that will give a little pushback and sound a click when your touch registers correctly. Also, the division of functions between the screens is a bit odd. For example, some things — like spoiler height and head-up-display options — are selected using the bottom screen but controlled via the upper screen.\n\nLastly, new this year is wireless Apple CarPlay connectivity — no more USB connection — and editors who’ve tried it have liked it. But what about us Android Auto users? Whomp whomp. We’re stuck with the USB cord.\n\nA Mixed Bag of Space\n\nThere are standard seats for five this year; the A7 previously had four, and in my mind it still does. The middle seat in the back shouldn’t qualify: It’s narrow and uncomfortably hard, and a large floor hump eats up legroom. The good news for those in the comfy seats is that they should fit better than ever in the new model. At 5-foot-6, I’ve always fit fine in the A7, but its sloping rear roofline has cramped taller editors’ style. This year, there’s a bit more headroom back there.\n\nShould you want to tempt fate and cart around children in this lovely vehicle, first, opt for the dark interior and second, breathe easy — car seat installation was a breeze. Two car seats have ample space in the backseat, and exposed Latch anchors make installation easier. Check out the full Car Seat Check.\n\nCargo space, however, is a mixed bag. In front, small-items storage is sad. The lower screen takes up a lot of space on the console, leaving no room for a storage bin — not even a tiny one for a phone or glasses. The center console box is also small; ours had an optional wireless charging pad, which takes up most of the room so not much else fits.\n\nThe hatchback-style cargo area, though shallow, is long and holds a lot; there’s a bit more room than there was previously. After grocery shopping for my family of five, there was room for all of my bags with space left over. I especially appreciated the small cargo net for cradling breakables.\n\nBig Luxury for Medium Money\n\nDue to a trim level shakeup and the return of the base-level Premium trim, the 2019 A7 costs less than the outgoing one: $68,995 (all prices include destination charges). That’s $1,680 below the current least-expensive 2018 model, a Premium Plus. That’s also less than base all-wheel-drive versions of the BMW 640 Gran Coupe ($85,495) and Mercedes-Benz CLS450 ($72,695).\n\nAlso for 2019, Audi added more standard safety equipment, including forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, as well as expanded standard camera views. A 360-degree surround-view camera takes up the right-hand portion of the screen, while the other side offers seven camera views displaying a variety of angles and positions. Uplevel Premium Plus models add rear collision prevention, blind spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert and a system that can detect potential accidents when opening a door and try to prevent them. Also available is an adaptive cruise assist feature that helps keep you in your lane as well as brings the car to a complete stop when the car ahead of you stops — then moves it again when the lead car moves.\n\nAudi cautions this isn’t designed to be a hands-free system, but more autonomous driver-assistance features are on the horizon. Audi says the 2019 A7 has self-driving capabilities, but they’re currently only on European cars. For example, Audi’s AI Remote Parking Pilot and Remote Garage Pilot systems allow drivers to maneuver into or out of parking spaces using Audi’s smartphone app. The systems have not yet cleared U.S. regulation hurdles.\n\nLike many consumers nervous about ceding control to self-driving features, however, I’m happy to be the one to park the 2019 A7 in my dream garage.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2022 Audi A7?\n\nThe Audi A7 is a five-seat mid-size luxury car that blends coupelike design and hatchback versatility. It’s powered by a 335-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 engine that works with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission, and all-wheel drive is standard. The plug-in hybrid A7 e, meanwhile, features a turbocharged four-cylinder engine and an electric motor. It can travel up to 26 miles on electric power alone, according to the EPA. \n\nThe performance-oriented S7 gets a 444-hp, twin-turbocharged 2.9-liter V-6 that teams with an eight-speed automatic, and the RS 7 has a 591-hp, twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Audi’s sleek, striking A7 has long held prime real estate in my dream garage, and the redesigned 2019 model solidifies that spot: Its just-right blend of elegance and excitement has been enhanced by the user-friendly multimedia system it so sorely lacked.\n\nVersus the competition: The A7 matches its rivals in terms of power and luxury, and new tech and safety features for 2019 keep it competitive.\n\nFor 2019, the A7 got some subtle styling tweaks that freshen its look but don’t diminish its hallmark sleek and sloping silhouette. The big news is inside and under the hood: a clean-sheet multimedia system redesign and a new powertrain. Compare it with the 2018 model.\n\nThe A7 competes against other luxury sedans with coupelike profiles, such as the BMW 6 Series and Mercedes-Benz CLS; see them compared.\n\nFrom Super to Turbo\n\nBehind the wheel, the A7 masterfully blends elements of sport and comfort, making it stand out in the class. Power comes on strong without being obnoxious, and its ride is gentler than the previous generation’s.\n\nSome editors thought this model’s focus on comfort cost it its handling edge, but to me the A7 has only been made more accessible. Yes, there’s a bit more body lean in corners in the 2019, but it remains admirably crisp and composed. It also has a slightly smaller turning radius, so it’s more maneuverable than its length suggests.\n\nThe A7’s new comfort-bias tuning also benefits its ride: Air springs are optional, but my test car rode on the standard coil springs and optional 20-inch wheels, and it serenely navigated Chicago’s pothole season with little fuss.\n\nThe sole powertrain this year is a 335-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 paired with a seven-speed automatic transmission. (More powerful S7 and RS 7 versions were last sold as 2018 models.) It replaces a supercharged V-6 and eight-speed automatic. Horsepower is nearly unchanged, but torque increases from 325 to 369 pounds-feet. Again, all-wheel drive is standard.\n\nAfter just a hint of turbo lag, power delivery is prompt and smooth, meshing with subtle, well-timed shifts. There are four driver-selectable drive modes: Auto, Comfort, Dynamic and a configurable Individual mode. I found Dynamic most engaging, as it makes the engine even more responsive.\n\nThe engine gets a modest boost — both in pep and fuel economy — from a new 48-volt mild-hybrid system. A 16-hp motor-generator captures energy under deceleration and stores it in a battery under the trunk floor, as well as enabling an unobtrusive stop-start system. Fuel economy improved just a bit, with the EPA rating the 2019 A7 22/29/25 mpg city/highway/combined. That’s up from the 2018’s 20/29/23 mpg.\n\nMore Screen Time\n\nAs with the previous generation, the A7’s cabin raises the bar: It’s refined, lovely and what you’d expect from a luxury sedan. The design is clean and classy, and everything looks and feels appropriately upscale — especially the matte wood trim, which is plentiful.\n\nWhat’s new — and will likely take some getting used to — is Audi’s switch to an almost completely screen-based control setup (the lone holdout is a volume knob). In place of the old wheel and trackpad are a pair of touchscreens, which are standard across the lineup. The two high-resolution displays and a single row of touch-sensitive buttons now control everything from multimedia to climate settings. It’s a welcome change from the previous system’s fussy, confounding setup.\n\nOverall, I found the system much easier to figure out and use than the old version. Like mealtimes with my twin 4-year-olds, the old knob-based twist-and-click system was a patience-tester I never did get comfortable controlling. With the new version, functions take fewer actions to complete, so things are quicker and less distracting to do while driving.\n\nThe upper screen is a 10.1-inch display that’s angled toward the driver and displays most functions, including audio and navigation. An 8.6-inch lower display houses climate and comfort settings. One icon on the lower screen enables a particularly helpful feature. It’s not super-clear what it is, given the icon is three empty boxes, but becomes clear once you press it: It allows you to add shortcuts to the lower screen — things like radio stations, phone contacts and navigation destinations.\n\nMy time with the system was not without some hiccups. First, though it looks like a touchscreen, it feels more like a touch-sensitive panel, which requires more of a push. I often had to touch it more than once, which got annoying, though you can turn on a haptic response feature that will give a little pushback and sound a click when your touch registers correctly. Also, the division of functions between the screens is a bit odd. For example, some things — like spoiler height and head-up-display options — are selected using the bottom screen but controlled via the upper screen.\n\nLastly, new this year is wireless Apple CarPlay connectivity — no more USB connection — and editors who’ve tried it have liked it. But what about us Android Auto users? Whomp whomp. We’re stuck with the USB cord.\n\nA Mixed Bag of Space\n\nThere are standard seats for five this year; the A7 previously had four, and in my mind it still does. The middle seat in the back shouldn’t qualify: It’s narrow and uncomfortably hard, and a large floor hump eats up legroom. The good news for those in the comfy seats is that they should fit better than ever in the new model. At 5-foot-6, I’ve always fit fine in the A7, but its sloping rear roofline has cramped taller editors’ style. This year, there’s a bit more headroom back there.\n\nShould you want to tempt fate and cart around children in this lovely vehicle, first, opt for the dark interior and second, breathe easy — car seat installation was a breeze. Two car seats have ample space in the backseat, and exposed Latch anchors make installation easier. Check out the full Car Seat Check.\n\nCargo space, however, is a mixed bag. In front, small-items storage is sad. The lower screen takes up a lot of space on the console, leaving no room for a storage bin — not even a tiny one for a phone or glasses. The center console box is also small; ours had an optional wireless charging pad, which takes up most of the room so not much else fits.\n\nThe hatchback-style cargo area, though shallow, is long and holds a lot; there’s a bit more room than there was previously. After grocery shopping for my family of five, there was room for all of my bags with space left over. I especially appreciated the small cargo net for cradling breakables.\n\nBig Luxury for Medium Money\n\nDue to a trim level shakeup and the return of the base-level Premium trim, the 2019 A7 costs less than the outgoing one: $68,995 (all prices include destination charges). That’s $1,680 below the current least-expensive 2018 model, a Premium Plus. That’s also less than base all-wheel-drive versions of the BMW 640 Gran Coupe ($85,495) and Mercedes-Benz CLS450 ($72,695).\n\nAlso for 2019, Audi added more standard safety equipment, including forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, as well as expanded standard camera views. A 360-degree surround-view camera takes up the right-hand portion of the screen, while the other side offers seven camera views displaying a variety of angles and positions. Uplevel Premium Plus models add rear collision prevention, blind spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert and a system that can detect potential accidents when opening a door and try to prevent them. Also available is an adaptive cruise assist feature that helps keep you in your lane as well as brings the car to a complete stop when the car ahead of you stops — then moves it again when the lead car moves.\n\nAudi cautions this isn’t designed to be a hands-free system, but more autonomous driver-assistance features are on the horizon. Audi says the 2019 A7 has self-driving capabilities, but they’re currently only on European cars. For example, Audi’s AI Remote Parking Pilot and Remote Garage Pilot systems allow drivers to maneuver into or out of parking spaces using Audi’s smartphone app. The systems have not yet cleared U.S. regulation hurdles.\n\nLike many consumers nervous about ceding control to self-driving features, however, I’m happy to be the one to park the 2019 A7 in my dream garage.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Audi’s sleek, striking A7 has long held prime real estate in my dream garage, and the redesigned 2019 model solidifies that spot: Its just-right blend of elegance and excitement has been enhanced by the user-friendly multimedia system it so sorely lacked.\n\nVersus the competition: The A7 matches its rivals in terms of power and luxury, and new tech and safety features for 2019 keep it competitive.\n\nFor 2019, the A7 got some subtle styling tweaks that freshen its look but don’t diminish its hallmark sleek and sloping silhouette. The big news is inside and under the hood: a clean-sheet multimedia system redesign and a new powertrain. Compare it with the 2018 model.\n\nThe A7 competes against other luxury sedans with coupelike profiles, such as the BMW 6 Series and Mercedes-Benz CLS; see them compared.\n\nFrom Super to Turbo\n\nBehind the wheel, the A7 masterfully blends elements of sport and comfort, making it stand out in the class. Power comes on strong without being obnoxious, and its ride is gentler than the previous generation’s.\n\nSome editors thought this model’s focus on comfort cost it its handling edge, but to me the A7 has only been made more accessible. Yes, there’s a bit more body lean in corners in the 2019, but it remains admirably crisp and composed. It also has a slightly smaller turning radius, so it’s more maneuverable than its length suggests.\n\nThe A7’s new comfort-bias tuning also benefits its ride: Air springs are optional, but my test car rode on the standard coil springs and optional 20-inch wheels, and it serenely navigated Chicago’s pothole season with little fuss.\n\nThe sole powertrain this year is a 335-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 paired with a seven-speed automatic transmission. (More powerful S7 and RS 7 versions were last sold as 2018 models.) It replaces a supercharged V-6 and eight-speed automatic. Horsepower is nearly unchanged, but torque increases from 325 to 369 pounds-feet. Again, all-wheel drive is standard.\n\nAfter just a hint of turbo lag, power delivery is prompt and smooth, meshing with subtle, well-timed shifts. There are four driver-selectable drive modes: Auto, Comfort, Dynamic and a configurable Individual mode. I found Dynamic most engaging, as it makes the engine even more responsive.\n\nThe engine gets a modest boost — both in pep and fuel economy — from a new 48-volt mild-hybrid system. A 16-hp motor-generator captures energy under deceleration and stores it in a battery under the trunk floor, as well as enabling an unobtrusive stop-start system. Fuel economy improved just a bit, with the EPA rating the 2019 A7 22/29/25 mpg city/highway/combined. That’s up from the 2018’s 20/29/23 mpg.\n\nMore Screen Time\n\nAs with the previous generation, the A7’s cabin raises the bar: It’s refined, lovely and what you’d expect from a luxury sedan. The design is clean and classy, and everything looks and feels appropriately upscale — especially the matte wood trim, which is plentiful.\n\nWhat’s new — and will likely take some getting used to — is Audi’s switch to an almost completely screen-based control setup (the lone holdout is a volume knob). In place of the old wheel and trackpad are a pair of touchscreens, which are standard across the lineup. The two high-resolution displays and a single row of touch-sensitive buttons now control everything from multimedia to climate settings. It’s a welcome change from the previous system’s fussy, confounding setup.\n\nOverall, I found the system much easier to figure out and use than the old version. Like mealtimes with my twin 4-year-olds, the old knob-based twist-and-click system was a patience-tester I never did get comfortable controlling. With the new version, functions take fewer actions to complete, so things are quicker and less distracting to do while driving.\n\nThe upper screen is a 10.1-inch display that’s angled toward the driver and displays most functions, including audio and navigation. An 8.6-inch lower display houses climate and comfort settings. One icon on the lower screen enables a particularly helpful feature. It’s not super-clear what it is, given the icon is three empty boxes, but becomes clear once you press it: It allows you to add shortcuts to the lower screen — things like radio stations, phone contacts and navigation destinations.\n\nMy time with the system was not without some hiccups. First, though it looks like a touchscreen, it feels more like a touch-sensitive panel, which requires more of a push. I often had to touch it more than once, which got annoying, though you can turn on a haptic response feature that will give a little pushback and sound a click when your touch registers correctly. Also, the division of functions between the screens is a bit odd. For example, some things — like spoiler height and head-up-display options — are selected using the bottom screen but controlled via the upper screen.\n\nLastly, new this year is wireless Apple CarPlay connectivity — no more USB connection — and editors who’ve tried it have liked it. But what about us Android Auto users? Whomp whomp. We’re stuck with the USB cord.\n\nA Mixed Bag of Space\n\nThere are standard seats for five this year; the A7 previously had four, and in my mind it still does. The middle seat in the back shouldn’t qualify: It’s narrow and uncomfortably hard, and a large floor hump eats up legroom. The good news for those in the comfy seats is that they should fit better than ever in the new model. At 5-foot-6, I’ve always fit fine in the A7, but its sloping rear roofline has cramped taller editors’ style. This year, there’s a bit more headroom back there.\n\nShould you want to tempt fate and cart around children in this lovely vehicle, first, opt for the dark interior and second, breathe easy — car seat installation was a breeze. Two car seats have ample space in the backseat, and exposed Latch anchors make installation easier. Check out the full Car Seat Check.\n\nCargo space, however, is a mixed bag. In front, small-items storage is sad. The lower screen takes up a lot of space on the console, leaving no room for a storage bin — not even a tiny one for a phone or glasses. The center console box is also small; ours had an optional wireless charging pad, which takes up most of the room so not much else fits.\n\nThe hatchback-style cargo area, though shallow, is long and holds a lot; there’s a bit more room than there was previously. After grocery shopping for my family of five, there was room for all of my bags with space left over. I especially appreciated the small cargo net for cradling breakables.\n\nBig Luxury for Medium Money\n\nDue to a trim level shakeup and the return of the base-level Premium trim, the 2019 A7 costs less than the outgoing one: $68,995 (all prices include destination charges). That’s $1,680 below the current least-expensive 2018 model, a Premium Plus. That’s also less than base all-wheel-drive versions of the BMW 640 Gran Coupe ($85,495) and Mercedes-Benz CLS450 ($72,695).\n\nAlso for 2019, Audi added more standard safety equipment, including forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, as well as expanded standard camera views. A 360-degree surround-view camera takes up the right-hand portion of the screen, while the other side offers seven camera views displaying a variety of angles and positions. Uplevel Premium Plus models add rear collision prevention, blind spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert and a system that can detect potential accidents when opening a door and try to prevent them. Also available is an adaptive cruise assist feature that helps keep you in your lane as well as brings the car to a complete stop when the car ahead of you stops — then moves it again when the lead car moves.\n\nAudi cautions this isn’t designed to be a hands-free system, but more autonomous driver-assistance features are on the horizon. Audi says the 2019 A7 has self-driving capabilities, but they’re currently only on European cars. For example, Audi’s AI Remote Parking Pilot and Remote Garage Pilot systems allow drivers to maneuver into or out of parking spaces using Audi’s smartphone app. The systems have not yet cleared U.S. regulation hurdles.\n\nLike many consumers nervous about ceding control to self-driving features, however, I’m happy to be the one to park the 2019 A7 in my dream garage.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Audi A7?\n\nThe 2023 Audi A7 combines a tapered roofline and coupelike style with a dose of cargo-toting practicality thanks to a handy rear hatchback and spacious trunk. Granted, accessing the second row is awkward thanks to the A7’s sleek shape, and its look-at-me design takes a chunk out of rear headroom. The standard powertrain consists of a 335-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 engine paired with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission, along with Audi’s Quattro all-wheel drive. If straight-line speed is what you’re after and you don’t mind paying for it, the S7 is motivated by a 444-hp, twin-turbo 2.9-liter V-6, and the RS 7 comes with a bellowing 591-hp, twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8. The A7’s competitors include the BMW 5 Series, Genesis G80, Mercedes-Benz E-Class and CLS-Class, and Porsche Panamera. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Audi A7?\n\nNewly standard is adaptive cruise control with lane departure steering assist. The top Prestige trim level now has remote park assist, and the plug-in hybrid version has been dropped from the range. The S7 gains a base Premium trim level and some revamped option packages.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Audi A7 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nAll-wheel drive\n12.3-inch digital instrument cluster\nPanoramic sunroof\nSatellite radio\nDual-touchscreen interface\nWireless Apple CarPlay, wired Android Auto \nPower liftgate\nLeather seating \nHeated front seats\nTri-zone automatic climate control\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nVentilated front seats\nHeated rear seats\nHeated steering wheel\nBang & Olufsen premium stereo\nMassage function for front seats\nHead-up instrument display\n360-degree parking camera\nAutomated parking system\nSoft-close doors\nShould I Buy the 2023 Audi A7?\n\nThe Audi A7 is agile, comfortable and quick even with its base powertrain. Fuel economy is respectable, and the cargo space accessed via the wide-opening rear hatch is extremely generous for a mid-size luxury sedan. It’s not perfect, however: Rear headroom is tight for tall adults, visibility is limited to the sides and rear, and its price is steep — even more so when considering the S7 and RS 7 performance models.",

      "expert_review": "The 2014 Audi A7 TDI may just be the perfect automobile: beautiful, fast, rare, efficient and loaded with the latest technology. But it will cost you plenty when it comes time to sign on the dotted line.\n\nAudi dropped some jaws when it unveiled its stunning Sportback concept car in 2009, and auto enthusiasts everywhere rejoiced when the production A7 turned up in 2010 looking almost exactly like the concept. The long, low, racy-looking “executive express” has been a style-setter for Audi and the industry in general.\n\nFor 2014, Audi made it even better by adding the word “efficient” to the A7’s long list of attributes, thanks to the company’s 3.0-liter diesel V-6 that can now be stuffed under its shapely hood. There aren’t many other changes from 2013 to 2014, but the A7 didn’t need many. Compare the two model years here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nNothing new here since the last review, just the continuation of one of the most beautiful automotive designs to come along in years. From the aggressive, sinister-looking front end to the uniquely sloping roofline and rear fenders, this is the shape that has inspired several designs, including the latest Lincoln MKZ, the Toyota Avalon, and the upcoming next-generation Hyundai Genesis. They say the true test of a good automotive design is whether it looks good in white; my test car’s Glacier White metallic paint proves the A7 passes that test perfectly, turning heads wherever it went. The low roofline means headroom is a little tight in the rear, but not uncomfortably so thanks to low seats in back.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe standard A7, with its supercharged, 3.0-liter gasoline V-6 is already a sweet drive, with gobs of smooth, quiet power. For 2014, there’s an optional turbocharged, 3.0-liter diesel V-6, a torque-monster motor that’s designed to deliver all the motive force one expects from an expensive luxury car while boosting fuel economy at the same time. In typical turbodiesel fashion, the engine makes just 240 horsepower but 428 pounds-feet of torque, meaning the A7 TDI loses nothing in terms of acceleration to the gas-powered model. Zero-to-60-mph takes just 5.5 seconds, only 0.1 seconds slower than the gas-powered 3.0-liter V-6. Power is routed to all four wheels through Audi’s standard Quattro all-wheel-drive system using an eight-speed automatic transmission.\n\nAt idle and under acceleration, the engine does have some muted diesel clatter to let you know this is not the standard powertrain most Americans are used to, but it’s never offensive or loud, just different. Just plant your right foot and hold on, as the immediate thrust is impressive. Thanks to the A7’s all-wheel drive, there’s no wheelspin or torque steer, just loads of smooth acceleration accompanied by an unusual soundtrack. At cruising speed, you’d never know this was a diesel. The car’s sophisticated powertrain and wind-cheating shape combine to create a hushed environment that allows you to enjoy the amazing sound system.\n\nThe diesel engine’s benefit over the gas motor is most evident at the fuel pump. The normal A7 V-6 gets 18/28/21 mpg city/highway/combined, a respectable figure for a 4,200-pound luxury sedan, but not extraordinary. The diesel version bumps those numbers up to 24/38/29 — a considerable increase over the regular model. If anything, these figures may be conservative. Ask most diesel owners, and they’ll tell you they regularly beat the EPA estimates for their cars, especially on the highway.\n\nMy week of testing included a jaunt from Ann Arbor, Mich., to Chicago and back, averaging 38 mpg on the highway at 75-80 mph. Overall mileage came in at 30 mpg for the week, which is an exceptional number for a big, powerful luxury car like the A7. To put it in perspective, the A7 diesel gets much better highway fuel economy than the much smaller Volkswagen GTI, which has a turbocharged, 2.0-liter gasoline four-cylinder, and it’s almost on par with a four-cylinder Honda Accord. The A7’s range is also extraordinary; after driving from Ann Arbor to Chicago, a distance of 250 miles, I still had nearly 400 miles of range left on the meter.\n\nRide and handling are outstanding, as well. Both are electrically adjustable, with Comfort and Sport modes or a combination of both if the driver desires. Keeping everything in Comfort mode tended to provide the best balance of sporty yet responsive steering, quick throttle action and compliant ride, but for owners who want customization options, the feature is there.\n\nInterior\nLike the exterior sheet metal, not much has changed inside since the A7 was first reviewed, but I dare say nothing needs to. The design is one of the best in the automotive world right now, with materials, shapes, build quality, buttons and switches all coming together to provide a luxury car experience that sets the benchmark to which others aspire. The open-pore, matte-finish wood looks and feels very modern, and, despite a high belt line and low roof, the cabin doesn’t feel cramped or claustrophobic. The seats are large, highly adjustable and all-day comfortable, as evidenced by the ease with which my 250-mile road trip went by. Rear seat room is also quite good, aside from a dearth of headroom thanks to that low roofline. Most people won’t have a problem with it; only folks above 6 feet tall will take issue.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe A7 TDI comes equipped with a host of state-of-the-art technologies, such as standard MMI navigation, a screen that hides away in the dashboard when not in use, Bluetooth connectivity, three-zone automatic climate control and more. The systems are integrated extremely well into the car, and Audi’s MMI system ranks at the top of my list of luxury-brand multimedia systems. Nearly all the car’s major controls are in the center console, easily within reach, and don’t require drivers to look at the console itself. A large central selector knob is surrounded by four buttons that correspond to the four corners of the display, plus a “back” button just below the knob. It makes transiting screens from one system to another quick and easy. The voice-activated navigation system also worked quite well, recognizing destination entries quickly and flawlessly.\n\nThe controls have a truly perceptible quality feel to their operation that few automakers have been able to duplicate.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe A7 may not look like it has a lot of room out back, but the hatchback provides for quite decent trunk space. A standard hard cover hides anything in the cargo area, making it appear tight, but it swallows large suitcases with ease. Total luggage capacity with the rear seats folded is 24.5 cubic feet, plenty for most situations and more than enough for weekend getaways, picking friends up at the airport, or family shopping at your favorite warehouse store. It’s rare for full-size luxury cars to have folding rear seats — usually they’re chock-full of massaging functions or heating elements.\n\nSafety\nMy test car included Audi’s $2,800 Driver Assistance Package, which adds adaptive cruise control, corner-view cameras, active lane assist, and a collision-sensing system that provides visual and audio warnings, with semi-autonomous braking if a crash is imminent. Of these features, the active lane assist may be the most interesting; it uses cameras to sense when the car veers too close to lane markers and helps steer it back on course via the electric power steering. It disables if a driver uses the turn signal or can be overcome if the driver keeps a firm grip on the steering wheel, showing intent to change lanes. At first it’s somewhat disconcerting, but I quickly adapted to the system, allowing for a more comfortable highway cruise without worry of edging too far left or right.\n\nThe Audi A7 has not been crash-tested. See all the standard and optional safety equipment for the A7 here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe starting price for a 2014 Audi A7 went up $4,400 for 2014, with the TDI option coming in even higher. It starts at $67,795 including a destination charge of $895. This car is extremely well-equipped, however, with features like all-wheel drive, the Audi Drive Select adjustable suspension, xenon headlights, a moonroof, navigation, a power liftgate, leather seats and keyless ignition. That’s not to say more cannot be specified: My test car featured a Bang & Olufsen premium sound system, ventilated seats, adaptive cornering lights, the S-line sport exterior trim, adaptive cruise control, active lane assist, 20-inch sport wheels and more to bring the total sticker price up to a more cringe-worthy $81,395.\n\nMost competitors lack the A7’s style, but there is one that measures up: the Mercedes-Benz CLS-Class. It starts a little higher in price, however, with an entry of $73,025 for a rear-wheel-drive model. Featuring its own bold and curvaceous styling, the CLS is available only with V-8 engines, making it considerably less efficient than the frugal, diesel-sipping A7 TDI. If you’re looking for a diesel alternative, BMW has the attractive 535d starting at $57,525 for rear-wheel drive. The BMW’s 3.0-liter diesel inline-six has comparable output (255 hp, 413 pounds-feet of torque) mated to an eight-speed transmission with optional all-wheel drive, but its performance numbers can’t touch the A7 TDI’s — it requires almost 3 seconds more to get from zero to 60 mph, but it does deliver comparable fuel economy. An alternate choice might be the Lexus GS 450h hybrid, which maintains the frugality of an alternative-fuel powertrain but with a decidedly sportier bent. It starts at $60,510 and bests the Audi’s city fuel economy (29 mpg versus 24 for the A7), but comes with rather confused styling, an inferior multimedia system and more-cramped quarters. Compare the A7 versus its competition here.\n\nFew cars out there, luxury or otherwise, can match the A7 TDI’s combination of style, performance, technology and sheer presence. This is the benchmark for the segment.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in January 2014 about the 2014 Audi A7. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2015, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe 2014 Audi A7 TDI may just be the perfect automobile: beautiful, fast, rare, efficient and loaded with the latest technology. But it will cost you plenty when it comes time to sign on the dotted line.\n\nAudi dropped some jaws when it unveiled its stunning Sportback concept car in 2009, and auto enthusiasts everywhere rejoiced when the production A7 turned up in 2010 looking almost exactly like the concept. The long, low, racy-looking “executive express” has been a style-setter for Audi and the industry in general.\n\nFor 2014, Audi made it even better by adding the word “efficient” to the A7’s long list of attributes, thanks to the company’s 3.0-liter diesel V-6 that can now be stuffed under its shapely hood. There aren’t many other changes from 2013 to 2014, but the A7 didn’t need many. Compare the two model years here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nNothing new here since the last review, just the continuation of one of the most beautiful automotive designs to come along in years. From the aggressive, sinister-looking front end to the uniquely sloping roofline and rear fenders, this is the shape that has inspired several designs, including the latest Lincoln MKZ, the Toyota Avalon, and the upcoming next-generation Hyundai Genesis. They say the true test of a good automotive design is whether it looks good in white; my test car’s Glacier White metallic paint proves the A7 passes that test perfectly, turning heads wherever it went. The low roofline means headroom is a little tight in the rear, but not uncomfortably so thanks to low seats in back.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe standard A7, with its supercharged, 3.0-liter gasoline V-6 is already a sweet drive, with gobs of smooth, quiet power. For 2014, there’s an optional turbocharged, 3.0-liter diesel V-6, a torque-monster motor that’s designed to deliver all the motive force one expects from an expensive luxury car while boosting fuel economy at the same time. In typical turbodiesel fashion, the engine makes just 240 horsepower but 428 pounds-feet of torque, meaning the A7 TDI loses nothing in terms of acceleration to the gas-powered model. Zero-to-60-mph takes just 5.5 seconds, only 0.1 seconds slower than the gas-powered 3.0-liter V-6. Power is routed to all four wheels through Audi’s standard Quattro all-wheel-drive system using an eight-speed automatic transmission.\n\nAt idle and under acceleration, the engine does have some muted diesel clatter to let you know this is not the standard powertrain most Americans are used to, but it’s never offensive or loud, just different. Just plant your right foot and hold on, as the immediate thrust is impressive. Thanks to the A7’s all-wheel drive, there’s no wheelspin or torque steer, just loads of smooth acceleration accompanied by an unusual soundtrack. At cruising speed, you’d never know this was a diesel. The car’s sophisticated powertrain and wind-cheating shape combine to create a hushed environment that allows you to enjoy the amazing sound system.\n\nThe diesel engine’s benefit over the gas motor is most evident at the fuel pump. The normal A7 V-6 gets 18/28/21 mpg city/highway/combined, a respectable figure for a 4,200-pound luxury sedan, but not extraordinary. The diesel version bumps those numbers up to 24/38/29 — a considerable increase over the regular model. If anything, these figures may be conservative. Ask most diesel owners, and they’ll tell you they regularly beat the EPA estimates for their cars, especially on the highway.\n\nMy week of testing included a jaunt from Ann Arbor, Mich., to Chicago and back, averaging 38 mpg on the highway at 75-80 mph. Overall mileage came in at 30 mpg for the week, which is an exceptional number for a big, powerful luxury car like the A7. To put it in perspective, the A7 diesel gets much better highway fuel economy than the much smaller Volkswagen GTI, which has a turbocharged, 2.0-liter gasoline four-cylinder, and it’s almost on par with a four-cylinder Honda Accord. The A7’s range is also extraordinary; after driving from Ann Arbor to Chicago, a distance of 250 miles, I still had nearly 400 miles of range left on the meter.\n\nRide and handling are outstanding, as well. Both are electrically adjustable, with Comfort and Sport modes or a combination of both if the driver desires. Keeping everything in Comfort mode tended to provide the best balance of sporty yet responsive steering, quick throttle action and compliant ride, but for owners who want customization options, the feature is there.\n\nInterior\nLike the exterior sheet metal, not much has changed inside since the A7 was first reviewed, but I dare say nothing needs to. The design is one of the best in the automotive world right now, with materials, shapes, build quality, buttons and switches all coming together to provide a luxury car experience that sets the benchmark to which others aspire. The open-pore, matte-finish wood looks and feels very modern, and, despite a high belt line and low roof, the cabin doesn’t feel cramped or claustrophobic. The seats are large, highly adjustable and all-day comfortable, as evidenced by the ease with which my 250-mile road trip went by. Rear seat room is also quite good, aside from a dearth of headroom thanks to that low roofline. Most people won’t have a problem with it; only folks above 6 feet tall will take issue.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe A7 TDI comes equipped with a host of state-of-the-art technologies, such as standard MMI navigation, a screen that hides away in the dashboard when not in use, Bluetooth connectivity, three-zone automatic climate control and more. The systems are integrated extremely well into the car, and Audi’s MMI system ranks at the top of my list of luxury-brand multimedia systems. Nearly all the car’s major controls are in the center console, easily within reach, and don’t require drivers to look at the console itself. A large central selector knob is surrounded by four buttons that correspond to the four corners of the display, plus a “back” button just below the knob. It makes transiting screens from one system to another quick and easy. The voice-activated navigation system also worked quite well, recognizing destination entries quickly and flawlessly.\n\nThe controls have a truly perceptible quality feel to their operation that few automakers have been able to duplicate.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe A7 may not look like it has a lot of room out back, but the hatchback provides for quite decent trunk space. A standard hard cover hides anything in the cargo area, making it appear tight, but it swallows large suitcases with ease. Total luggage capacity with the rear seats folded is 24.5 cubic feet, plenty for most situations and more than enough for weekend getaways, picking friends up at the airport, or family shopping at your favorite warehouse store. It’s rare for full-size luxury cars to have folding rear seats — usually they’re chock-full of massaging functions or heating elements.\n\nSafety\nMy test car included Audi’s $2,800 Driver Assistance Package, which adds adaptive cruise control, corner-view cameras, active lane assist, and a collision-sensing system that provides visual and audio warnings, with semi-autonomous braking if a crash is imminent. Of these features, the active lane assist may be the most interesting; it uses cameras to sense when the car veers too close to lane markers and helps steer it back on course via the electric power steering. It disables if a driver uses the turn signal or can be overcome if the driver keeps a firm grip on the steering wheel, showing intent to change lanes. At first it’s somewhat disconcerting, but I quickly adapted to the system, allowing for a more comfortable highway cruise without worry of edging too far left or right.\n\nThe Audi A7 has not been crash-tested. See all the standard and optional safety equipment for the A7 here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe starting price for a 2014 Audi A7 went up $4,400 for 2014, with the TDI option coming in even higher. It starts at $67,795 including a destination charge of $895. This car is extremely well-equipped, however, with features like all-wheel drive, the Audi Drive Select adjustable suspension, xenon headlights, a moonroof, navigation, a power liftgate, leather seats and keyless ignition. That’s not to say more cannot be specified: My test car featured a Bang & Olufsen premium sound system, ventilated seats, adaptive cornering lights, the S-line sport exterior trim, adaptive cruise control, active lane assist, 20-inch sport wheels and more to bring the total sticker price up to a more cringe-worthy $81,395. Option one up yourself here.\n\nMost competitors lack the A7’s style, but there is one that measures up: the Mercedes-Benz CLS-Class. It starts a little higher in price, however, with an entry of $73,025 for a rear-wheel-drive model. Featuring its own bold and curvaceous styling, the CLS is available only with V-8 engines, making it considerably less efficient than the frugal, diesel-sipping A7 TDI. If you’re looking for a diesel alternative, BMW has the attractive 535d starting at $57,525 for rear-wheel drive. The BMW’s 3.0-liter diesel inline-six has comparable output (255 hp, 413 pounds-feet of torque) mated to an eight-speed transmission with optional all-wheel drive, but its performance numbers can’t touch the A7 TDI’s — it requires almost 3 seconds more to get from zero to 60 mph, but it does deliver comparable fuel economy. An alternate choice might be the Lexus GS 450h hybrid, which maintains the frugality of an alternative-fuel powertrain but with a decidedly sportier bent. It starts at $60,510 and bests the Audi’s city fuel economy (29 mpg versus 24 for the A7), but comes with rather confused styling, an inferior multimedia system and more-cramped quarters. Compare the A7 versus its competition here.\n\nFew cars out there, luxury or otherwise, can match the A7 TDI’s combination of style, performance, technology and sheer presence. This is the benchmark for the segment.\n\nemail",
