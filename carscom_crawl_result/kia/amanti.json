      "expert_review": "Familiar, for Good Reasons\n2004 Kia Amanti\n\nThis is a soap opera, a tale of dalliances and romances speculative and true.\n\nIt involves liaisons and rumors of liaisons between the world’s greatest car companies. Its protagonist is the 2004 Kia Amanti sedan, the grand offspring of those many affairs.\n\nIn the main, the story is told through the Amanti’s face and ample body, which are subjects of much gossip in the global automotive community.\n\nLegend has it that the Amanti, Kia’s first large sedan, is the descendant of an initial union between Jaguar and Mercedes-Benz, which begot a child, Jaguabenz.\n\nJaguabenz was reared in a patrician environment in which it dated and mated with BMW, a coupling that yielded Jabenbimmer, who in childhood cruelly was nicknamed “Jabimbo.”\n\nAngry, rebellious and resentful, Jabimbo rolled around a lot, most notably with a Japanese partner, Toyota Avalon, and a somewhat pretentious American, Buick LeSabre.\n\nFrom one of those unions, which one is uncertain, came this week’s car, the Kia Amanti. It’s being passed off as a full-size Korean sedan simply because it is sold by Kia Motors, which became a part of South Korea’s Hyundai Automotive Group in September 2000.\n\nBut anyone looking at the Amanti will not be taken in by that ruse. At the very least, the Amanti is the design progeny of styling cues stolen from every major manufacturer of big cars European, Japanese and domestic. It is the finest bit of industrial plagiarism witnessed in decades, and for that Kia deserves applause.\n\nApplause?\n\nYes, applause, congratulations and kudos of every sort. What Kia has put together here is praiseworthy — a truly big and comfortable car of excellent fit and finish, packed with amenities, and sold at a price that renders discounts on comparable automobiles meaningless.\n\nAnd although questions and jokes remain about its styling legacy, one thing is certain: The Amanti turns heads.\n\nFor example, Mercedes-Benz executives were shocked at last year’s Frankfurt Auto Show when they saw a black Amanti roll into the driveway of the Intercontinental Hotel.\n\n“That looks like one of ours!” said a Mercedes-Benz official.\n\n“No,” said another Mercedes-Benz executive. “I’ll be [expletive]! That’s a Kia!”\n\nThat’s exactly the reaction Kia is seeking with the Amanti, and that is what it is getting in the United States and abroad.\n\nKia has an objective. It wants to erase every vestige of the shame and embarrassment that accompanied the introduction of its automobiles in America in 1994. Those early Kia cars were losers — cheap, small, unreliable and built to stay that way. They were fodder for Jay Leno car jokes on “The Tonight Show.”\n\nBut Kia has been improving, and its progress accelerated when it got together with Hyundai four years ago. (The Amanti, in fact, lar gely is based on the front-wheel-drive platform of Hyundai’s big sedan, the XG350.) With the Amanti, Kia is serving notice that it is here to stay. It is targeting the loyal and lucrative baby-boomer market for large sedans, currently served by models such as the Buick LeSabre, Toyota Avalon, Mercury Grand Marquis, Chrysler Concorde and, although it’s a bit of a stretch, the Mercedes-Benz E-Class.\n\nIn addition to the look and interior roominess of those cars, the Amanti has their cushy boulevard ride.\n\nThe Amanti glides like a butterfly, floats like a boat. In that regard, it also has more than a little bit of Lincoln Town Car in its genetic code. But not everybody is asking, “Who’s your daddy?” about this one. It’s getting admirers and thumbs-up as a legitimate and credible player in the American market.\n\nPerhaps it’s time to welcome Kia Motors and the Amanti to the family.\n\nNuts & Bolts\n\nDownside: Not much. The ride is too soft for my tastes. But other people love it. The Infinity speaker in the passenger-side door wasn’t properly mounted. But that’s an easy fix.\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: There is more than enough here to please normal drivers (those who don’t confuse city streets with racetracks) in all three categories. This is an enjoyable car.\n\nHead-turning quotient: “Who’s your daddy?” Before seeing the Kia badge, many people mistook the Amanti for a Mercedes-Benz, Jaguar, “a kind of BMW” as one observer put it, the new Buick LaCrosse, “a Lexus of some sort,” and the Toyota Avalon. All of those misidentifications are music to the ears of Kia executives.\n\nBody style/layout: The Amanti is a front-engine, front-wheel-drive sedan. Kia markets it as a full-size model. But it also has been referred to as a midsize car.\n\nEngine/transmission: The Amanti is equipped with a 3.5-liter, 24-valve, V-6 engine that develops 195 horsepower at 5,500 revolutions per minute and 220 foot-pounds of torque at 3,500 rpm. The engine is linked to a five-speed automatic transmission that also can be operated manually.\n\nCapacities: The Amanti has seating for five people. Maximum cargo capacity is 16 cubic feet. The fuel tank holds 18.5 gallons of gasoline. Regular unleaded is recommended.\n\nMileage: I averaged 23 miles per gallon in city/highway driving.\n\nStandard features: Loaded! Power seats and locks, heated side-view mirrors, simulated wood trim on dash and center console, eight-speaker sound system, leather-wrapped steering wheel and more.\n\nSafety: Standard front and rear head air bags, dual front and dual rear side air bags; standard anti-lock brakes.\n\nPrice: Base price is $24,995. Dealer invoice price on base model is $22,655. Price as tested is $26,085, including $550 for the optional electronic stability control system and a $540 destination charge.\n\nPurse-strings note: The Amanti is the first Kia car to earn a “buy” rating from this column.",

      "expert_review": "NEW YORK The front end looks like a Mercedes-Benz, particularly the Mercedes-Benz E-Class sedan. It’s so blatantly, brazenly imitative, the only thing missing is the Mercedes-Benz three-pointed star.\n\nThe interior is everything Lexus — plush, perfect fit and finish, ergonomically sensible. The Korean car company even got the leather seat covering right. It’s supple and soft — exactly the way leather seat covering ought to be.\n\nThe suspension is something else. It needs work. That is, it needs a cultural adjustment. Consumers in South Korea and China seem to have one thing in common when it comes to cars. They want soft rides. Perhaps it has something to do with the rural roads, which still account for most of the roads found in those countries. They are anything but smooth.\n\nAnd so the Koreans and Chinese, from an American perspective, are given to overcompensation in the matter of suspensions. Thus, we have this week’s test car, the 2007 Kia Amanti sedan, an automobile with ride and handling so soft and squishy, it is reminiscent of a 1950s Buick, Chrysler Imperial or Lincoln Continental. Anyone buying the Amanti absolutely should buy it with Kia’s optional electronic stability control, which gives the car some semblance of disciplined road behavior on long drives.\n\nBut if you are getting the impression that this column is a knock against the Amanti, you are wrong. Here, I and my associate Ria Manglapus strive to tell you about cars and trucks as we see them, as we and our many passengers have experienced them on the road, often on round-trip drives as long as 500 miles.\n\nWhat we found in the Amanti was a happy automotive amalgam — happy because it, hmm, “borrows” so much from so many different cars and does the “borrowing” so wonderfully well that, after a while, you don’t care that you’re in a car that is a mixture of everything else. And that happiness turns to unadulterated joy in consideration of the Kia Amanti’s base price, which is substantially under $30,000.\n\nIn short, the car is a very good value. Maybe it’s the very best value available in the U.S. market segment for full-size family sedans. In a troubled national economy, one in which sales of homes and new cars and trucks are falling, that is a good thing for Kia and a very good thing for the Amanti.\n\nAfter all, what do most families shop for when they are shopping for a car? Do they have an automotive buff-book mentality, one that frequently elevates horsepower, speed, racetrack handling and exoticism above everything else, including common sense and affordability?\n\nNo.\n\nFamilies shop for space. The Kia Amanti offers them lots of space — enough room to comfortably seat five big adults; and more than enough space to accommodate their luggage. Families shop for reliability. We drove the Amanti a total of 800 miles — 300 of which were accumulated by Ria in Northern Virginia commuter traffic. Eight hundred miles won’t tell you everything about a car. But 800 completely trouble-free miles are enough to tell you that a car certainly is worth considering.\n\nFamilies shop for safety, and the Kia Amanti does a very good job there, with high crash-safety ratings from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.\n\nAnd while most families have no intention of ever putting their car on a racetrack, they do want an automobile with enough get-up-and-go to get out of its own way. There is no problem in that area with the Amanti, which now comes with a new 3.8-liter, 264-horsepower V-6 engine mated to a five-speed transmission that can be shifted automatically or manually. The car can run.\n\nAnd we really don’t mind Kia’s penchant for imitation and “borrowing.” We just wish that it would “borrow” a better suspension — maybe, say, one from the Mercedes-Benz E-Class or Cadillac STS. We’d be happy with that, especially if Kia kept the Amanti’s base price under $30,000.\n\nNUTS & BOLTS\n\n2007 Kia Amanti\n\nComplaints: The suspension needs an upgrade. It’s way too soft for our tastes. Kia needs to get its mind out of the 1950s when it comes to the Amanti’s ride and handling.\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: Ride and handling are marginal. Acceleration is very good — rather zoom-zoom in fact.\n\nHead-turning quotient: Ria said it best: “It looks like a lot of cars all at once.”\n\nBody style: The Kia Amanti is a front-engine, front-wheel-drive, full-size, entry-level luxury family sedan of steel, unitized-body construction.\n\nEngine/transmission: The standard engine is a 3.8-liter, double-overhead cam, 24-valve V-6 that develops 264 horsepower at 6,000 revolutions per minute and 260 pound-feet of torque at 4,500 rpm. The engine is mated to a five-speed transmission that can operate automatically, or be shifted manually.\n\nCapacities: There is ample seating for five adults. Maximum luggage capacity is 15.9 cubic feet. The fuel tank holds 18.5 gallons of recommended regular unleaded gasoline.\n\nMileage: We averaged 16 miles per gallon in the city and 25 mpg on the highway.\n\nSafety: Standard equipment includes four-wheel anti-lock brakes, side and head air bags. Electronic stability and traction control were optional at this writing. We strongly advise that you buy both for this car.\n\nPrice: The base price for the 2007 Kia Amanti is $25,495. Dealer’s invoice price on base car is $23,250.\n\nPrice as tested, excluding available rebates, is $31,375. That price includes $5,200 in options and a $680 destination charge. Dealer’s price as tested is $28,370. With customer rebates and other incentives, the Amanti with the cited options has been selling for under $29,000. Prices sourced from Kia and www.edmunds.com.\n\nPurse-strings note: It’s a buy, soft suspension notwithstanding. The Amanti is a very good value. Compare with any full-size family sedan.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in July 2007 about the 2007 Kia Amanti. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what details are different this year, check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nWould you pay $30,000 for a Kia? That’s the question written all over the Amanti, the Korean automaker’s largest sedan. The Amanti starts under $26,000, but add a few crowd-pleasing options, and the bottom line quickly turns top-shelf. Considering it competes against established nameplates like the Toyota Avalon and Chrysler 300, on the surface Kia’s flagship is something of a dubious sell.\n\nIt shouldn’t be. With updated styling and more power for 2007, the retooled Amanti is appreciably better than before. Some missing features and a lazy transmission will bar it from leading the segment, but it’s competitive in the most important areas: a quiet ride, precise controls, buttery-soft seats and legroom to spare. The Amanti is worth a look — and considering that a loaded Avalon or 300 can easily approach $40,000, its price may still be Kia territory after all.\n\nThe front-wheel-drive Amanti comes in one trim level, with various option packages adding more luxury and safety. I drove a relatively loaded version that weighed in at $29,745.\n\nDerivative Styling\nSharing a platform with Hyundai’s now-defunct XG350, the original Amanti failed to spark much interest in its three years on the market. At least partly to blame was the amorphous styling, which bore more resemblance to a Jaguar S-Type than it did to other Kias.\n\nThe 2007 version wears a slightly wider grille and revised headlights, but it’s still a ringer for an S-Type or Mercedes-Benz E-Class, especially because Kia’s oblong logo remains conspicuously absent.\n\nIn back, changes are easier to notice. Vertical taillights and a taller profile give the rear a much fuller figure — so much fuller, in fact, that if you wedge the Amanti headfirst into a tight parking spot, the trunk looks a bit like that of any six-figure ultraluxury car. (There’s a Kia emblem top and center, though, so any such fantasies will be short-lived.) In any case, the Amanti looks much statelier than before, and by week’s end its lines had grown on me.\n\nSixteen-inch wheels are standard; 17-inch wheels are optional.\n\nGoing & Stopping\nA 3.8-liter V-6 replaces last year’s 3.5-liter V-6, and horsepower jumps from 200 to 264. The larger engine is shared across a number of Hyundai and Kia cars. In the Amanti, it works with a standard five-speed automatic.\n\nThe drivetrain looks good on paper, but in practice it’s stymied by a sluggish transmission. Toe the gas for power coming out of a corner, and you’ll often catch the automatic loitering in the higher gear you were in when you entered the turn. The result is slow acceleration followed by a late downshift and sudden, peaky power. Drivers will notice this tendency during normal urban driving; there’s no need to push the limits to find it. Equally vexing is the transmission’s performance at parking lot speeds, where it occasionally stumbles — and makes a big fuss of it — while downshifting to first. The gearbox is electronically controlled, so these pitfalls could conceivably be ironed out in the future.\n\nPutting aside the transmission glitches, the V-6 is quite capable. It delivers energetic acceleration from onramp stoplights all the way up to highway speeds, and passing at 60 to 70 mph is nearly as easy. Pushed hard, the engine emits a hoarse roar — far from the pleasing sound of a Nissan Maxima’s V-6 or Chrysler 300’s Hemi V-8.\n\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes are standard. The pedal feels a bit on the mushy side, but it delivers firm stopping power when pushed hard.\n\nUsing the EPA’s 2008 gas mileage calculations, the Amanti is rated at 17 mpg in the city and 24 mpg on the highway. While those figures represent an improvement over the 2006 Amanti (calculated with the 2008 standard for consistency), they still trail most competitors.\n\nGas Mileage Compared\n\tGas mileage*\tRecommended fuel\n2007 Kia Amanti\t17/24\tRegular (87-octane) unleaded\n2007 Buick Lucerne (V-6)\t17/26\tRegular (87-octane) unleaded\n2007 Buick Lucerne (V-8)\t15/23\tPremium (91-octane) unleaded\n2007 Chrysler 300 (2.7L V-6)\t18/26\tRegular (87-octane) unleaded\n2007 Chrysler 300 (3.5L V-6)**\t17/24\tMidgrade (89-octane) unleaded\n2007 Chrysler 300 (V-8)**\t15/23\tMidgrade (89-octane) unleaded\n2008 Ford Taurus**\t18/28\tRegular (87-octane) unleaded\n2007 Toyota Avalon\t20/28\tRegular (87-octane) unleaded\n*City/highway EPA estimates using 2008 testing standards.\n**Two-wheel-drive models\nSource: EPA\n\nRide & Handling\nKia says the suspension has been significantly stiffened for 2007 — an effort to abate the previous car’s “floaty” character. Even so, the new four-wheel-independent suspension and thick P235/55R17 tires yield generous comfort, gliding over ruts and potholes while the cabin stays relatively undisturbed. Highway noise is low enough that you can soak up classical music — or hash out directions with your passengers, as the case may be.\n\nExpectedly, the tradeoff comes in handling, where the Amanti exhibits significant body roll through corners. The steering wheel doesn’t feel particularly precise, but at least its movements are naturally weighted, with none of the intermittent vagueness that afflicts steering in the 300 and Lucerne. The Amanti takes a bit more effort than either of those cars to turn at low speeds, though its 38.2-foot turning diameter beats both. The Avalon still leads the group at 37.0 feet.\n\nThe Inside\nThe short dashboard and narrow, clipped window sills make the cabin look much smaller than it is. Getting in and out is easy, thanks to a high seating position and doors that open unexpectedly wide. From the driver’s seat, my 5-foot, 11-inch frame had plenty of legroom and headroom, and there’s enough range in the seat adjustments for taller or shorter drivers to position themselves a safe distance from the airbag. Optional power-adjusting pedals help in that regard, though I would also like to see a telescoping steering wheel; this one only tilts.\n\nThe seats are well-cushioned, with enough side bolstering that they don’t feel flat or formless. The optional leather upholstery is convincingly sumptuous, on par with its competitors and a discernable cut above the stuff you’d get in an Accord or Camry. Those in back have enough room to spread out. The seatbacks are recessed a bit, which makes for relaxed lounging but also means passengers have to sit upright to pull off a graceful exit.\n\nFor 2007, the dashboard has dropped last year’s stair-stepped construction for a more conventional dome and shelf. The dark faux-wood trim in my test car seemed fitting; less appealing was the abundant silver-painted plastic, which ranged from discreet on the center controls to downright tacky around the cupholders and gearshift.\n\nOtherwise, the materials are generally high-quality, with fabric- rather than plastic-covered window pillars and soft-touch surfaces all the way down to the glove compartment cover. Individual controls show signs of a tight ship — the turn signal stalks click with precision (you’d be surprised how many cars botch this) and the knobs about the radio and climate displays have a high-quality feel. Two notable exceptions: Both the remote key fob and power-window switches feel like they were plucked off one of Kia’s economy cars.\n\nTotal cabin volume measures 106 cubic feet. In back, the trunk holds a hefty 15.9 cubic feet of luggage. As with most full-size cars, the backseat does not fold; a small pass-thru in the center can accommodate a pair of skis.\n\nSizing Up Full-Size Cars\n\tCabin volume (cu. ft.)\tTrunk volume (cu. ft.)\tFolding backseat\n2007 Kia Amanti\t106.0\t15.9\tNo\n2007 Chrysler 300\t106.6\t15.6\tYes\n2007 Toyota Avalon\t106.9\t14.4\tNo\n2007 Buick Lucerne\t108.0\t17.0\tNo\n2008 Ford Taurus\t108.0\t21.2\tYes\nAutomaker data for base models; optional equipment, such as a moonroof, may change volumes slightly.\n\nSafety\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety awarded the 2007 Amanti its highest score, Good, for frontal crash tests. IIHS has not conducted side-impact tests for the car. Standard safety features include four-wheel-disc antilock brakes, active head restraints and eight airbags — the mandatory dual front airbags, side-impact torso-protection airbags for both the front and rear seats, and side curtain airbags for both rows. Traction control and an electronic stability system are optional.\n\nFeatures & Pricing\nWithout the destination charge, the base Amanti starts at $25,495. That’s $2,500 less than last year’s Amanti, which had a smaller engine but more standard luxury features. Standard equipment for 2007 includes one-touch power windows, power locks with keyless entry, dual-zone automatic climate control, power front seats, a single-CD audio system and a leather-wrapped steering wheel with audio and cruise controls.\n\nOptions include leather upholstery, power-adjustable pedals, a moonroof, electroluminescent gauges, an upgraded Infiniti stereo and a trip computer with a 4-inch dashboard screen. Traction control, brake assist and an electronic stability system are packaged together for $500, but you have to buy $3,400 in other packages first — a real shame for those on a budget. A navigation system and rear parking sensors, two items common in full-size cars, are unavailable.\n\nA fully loaded Amanti runs just under $31,000.\n\nAmanti in the Market\nIf it had a more dynamic drivetrain and a few additional creature comforts, the Amanti might emerge as a leader in this segment. At present, it’s a solid bet for anyone seeking a less-expensive alternative to the prevailing options out there. That’s been Kia’s formula for some time: comparatively inexpensive cars that don’t blow you away outright, but are competitive enough to be a good choice for value-minded buyers. It works at $12,000, $18,000 and — wouldn’t you know — it even works at 30 large.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",
