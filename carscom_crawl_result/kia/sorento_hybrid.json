      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Kia Sorento?\n\nThe Kia Sorento is a three-row mid-size SUV with seating for up to seven. The base powertrain is a 191-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine coupled to an eight-speed automatic transmission. Optional is a 281-hp turbocharged version of this engine, paired with an eight-speed dual-clutch automatic. The Sorento is also available with hybrid and plug-in hybrid powertrains. The hybrid employs a gas-electric powertrain with a 1.6-liter turbo four-cylinder engine that produces 227 hp and returns an EPA-estimated 37 mpg in combined city/highway driving with front-wheel drive, 34 mpg with all-wheel drive. Sitting atop the range, the Sorento Plug-in Hybrid comes standard with AWD; its 261-hp gas-electric powertrain uses a turbo 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine and has an EPA-estimated electric driving range of 32 miles on a full charge.\n\nIf toting around little ones is part of your daily routine, you can see how the Sorento scored in our Car Seat Check. The Sorento’s rivals include the Honda Passport, Hyundai Santa Fe, Subaru Ascent and Toyota Highlander.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Kia Sorento?\n\nThe regular gas-engine Sorento gets a styling refresh that brings its looks more in line with Kia’s larger three-row Telluride, along with a new dashboard design that includes a standard 12.3-inch infotainment screen and an optional 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster. Wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are now standard, too. Also joining the line is an off-road-themed X-Pro trim that comes standard with AWD and chunky all-terrain tires.\n\nMeanwhile, the hybrid and plug-in hybrid Sorentos are carried over with only minor trim changes for 2024; they will be refreshed for the 2025 model year.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Kia Sorento Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n12.3-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nWireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay connectivity\nFive USB ports\nSecond- and third-row bench seats\nAdaptive cruise control\nAutomatic emergency braking\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nLane departure steering assist\nRear automatic braking\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nPanoramic moonroof\nLeather upholstery\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated second-row captain’s chairs\nHeated steering wheel\nDual-zone automatic climate control\nBose premium stereo\n12.3-inch digital gauge cluster\nWireless device charging\n360-degree camera system\nFront and rear parking sensors\nHands-free power liftgate\nShould I Buy the 2024 Kia Sorento?\n\nThe Sorento continues to impress with its cabin quality, a long roster of standard comfort and safety features, and bold exterior design. The Sorento’s smart refresh for 2024 makes a good thing that much better, though a few problems remain. These include a tight third row and a limited amount of cargo volume when the rear seats are occupied. Even so, many families might find the Sorento to be sized just right, offering the flexibility of a third row and more space all around than a compact SUV while being easier to park and maneuver than a larger three-row SUV would be. The hybrid and plug-in hybrid do without the regular Sorento’s updates for this model year, but they’ll both catch up for 2025.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Families looking for a large vehicle with small-vehicle fuel economy don’t have a lot of options, but the 2021 Kia Sorento Hybrid is a good one. The electrified three-row SUV complements the already impressive Sorento lineup by adding a decent bump in the gas mileage department.  \n\nAgainst the competition: The Sorento Hybrid has few direct competitors, but its closest one is the Toyota Highlander Hybrid. The Highlander is a bit bigger, but the Kia is less expensive and has better fuel economy.\n\nRedesigned for 2021, the Kia Sorento three-row SUV slots just below the Telluride three-row SUV in Kia’s lineup. Compared with the 2020, the Sorento is bigger this year and has an updated multimedia system, a nicer cabin, an available hybrid powertrain, more standard safety features and a rugged off-road version.\n\nThis review focuses mostly on the front-wheel-drive hybrid model; you can read my review of the gas-only Sorento below.\n\nRelated: 2021 Kia Sorento Review: A Middle Child Deserving of the Spotlight\n\nWhat You Get\n\nThe Sorento Hybrid uses a turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine, a 44-kilowatt electric motor and a 1.5-kilowatt-hour battery for a total system output of 227 horsepower, which is plenty powerful. Torque is strong from a stop, and the six-speed automatic quickly ticks off shifts, making for fuss-free power delivery at higher speeds. \n\nThe hybrid sometimes makes odd, ethereal whirring sounds, as do many hybrids on the market, but Kia has done a solid job smoothing out other telltale hybrid quirks in two areas: regenerative braking and the transition from electric vehicle power to gas. \n\nThe Sorento’s brakes have a fairly natural pedal feel and linear action, both of which are very unlike some hybrids’ firm, unresponsive pedals. There’s no EV mode to force electric-only operation, but the electric motor kicks in frequently — both to boost power and to drive the car on electric power alone — to increase efficiency. The switch to electric-only power happens seamlessly; the only clue is a green EV indicator light. \n\nSorento Hybrid MPG\n\nThe Sorento hybrid has an EPA fuel economy rating of 39/35/37 mpg city/highway/combined — solid numbers for a vehicle this size. They’re a smidge higher than the FWD Highlander Hybrid’s EPA rating of 36/35/36 mpg; for more on these two, compare Highlander Hybrid and Sorento Hybrid specifications here. The Highlander Hybrid is rated slightly lower with all-wheel drive (35 mpg combined), which the Sorento Hybrid doesn’t offer. \n\nIn practice, the Sorento’s estimated fuel economy was a bit difficult to achieve. I averaged 34.7 mpg during a 1,309-mile road trip — a bit under its overall rating. A few things were working against it, however. The SUV was loaded with five people and a week’s worth of stuff, and the trip consisted almost exclusively of highway driving, which prevented the powertrain from capturing the lost braking energy needed to recharge the battery and augment engine power. Our 34.7-mpg average was, in fact, pretty close to the SUV’s highway estimate.\n\nAs you’d expect, the hybrid’s fuel economy is a lot better than the regular Sorento’s. The conventional Sorento uses a 191-hp, 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine and an uplevel 281-hp, turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder; the previous V-6 is no longer available. With the base engine and FWD, the conventional Sorento gets an EPA-estimated 24/29/26 mpg, while the uplevel front-drive turbo version is rated at 22/29/25 mpg. \n\nAnd even better fuel economy is coming. A plug-in hybrid Sorento with 261 hp, AWD and an estimated 30 miles of all-electric range will join the lineup later in 2021. \n\nWhat You Give Up\n\nWe didn’t tow anything on our trip, but if you need to, you’ll have to pack sparingly. The Sorento Hybrid is only rated to tow 2,000 pounds, which is less than the gas model’s 3,500-pound max rating (with the optional engine). It’s also lower than the Highlander Hybrid’s 3,500-pound rating.  \n\nIt took a few miles to settle into the Sorento Hybrid’s road manners. It has a firmer ride and lets in more road noise than the regular version; its hybrid-specific tires are likely partly to blame. In many other ways, however, the Sorento Hybrid benefits from the successes of the regular Sorento, especially when it comes to space and cabin features — with a couple of exceptions. \n\nThe Sorento Hybrid has the same amount of cargo space behind the third row as the gas-powered version, at 12.6 cubic feet, according to Kia; that’s less than the Highlander Hybrid’s 16-cubic-foot rating. When it comes to rear headroom, the Sorento models are once again matched — and once again slightly trail the Highlander. In rear legroom, the Sorento Hybrid offers an inch less legroom than the gas model, but it wasn’t noticeable to me or my backseat crew. \n\nWhat disappoints in terms of space, however, is that the hybrid model is only offered with second-row captain’s chairs; no three-seat bench is available as it is in the gas-only version. This omission limits the SUV’s versatility. \n\nAlso limiting is the fact that the hybrid only comes in mid-level S and EX trims — which you’ll recognize the minute you hop in the cabin. When I tested a top SX-Prestige trim of the gas-only Sorento, I was wowed by its refined materials and classy design. The hybrid is not that. The Sorento Hybrid EX I tested had more of a budget feel, with copious plastic pieces and a less sophisticated design. \n\nAlso missing from the hybrid is the uplevel versions’ large 10.25-inch touchscreen, which is slick-looking and easy to use. The Sorento Hybrid only has an 8-inch touchscreen. It’s also straightforward and responsive, but I prefer the larger setup. \n\nSafety and Value \n\nAs with the gas-powered version, the 2021 Kia Sorento Hybrid is loaded with standard safety features, many of which you’d expect and a couple you might not. Typical safety features include automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, blind spot collision avoidance assist, rear cross-traffic alert, a driver attention warning system, lane keep assist and automatic lane-centering. Adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go is only standard on EX models. \n\nUnexpected standard features include a safe exit assistance system for the rear seats, which uses the SUV’s rear-facing radar to detect oncoming traffic and prevent a rear door from being opened if an approaching vehicle or bicycle is detected. There’s also a standard rear-seat alert system that uses ultrasonic sensors to detect child or pet movement in the second and third rows after the doors have been locked; if movement is detected, the system sounds the horn and illuminates the hazard lights.\n\nThe 2021 Kia Sorento Hybrid S starts at $1,700 more than a gas-only S trim, at $34,765. The $37,765 EX version costs $1,600 more than its gas-only EX counterpart. The price premium for a hybrid model may look high, but its price tag undercuts the Highlander Hybrid, which starts at $39,910 in base LE trim (all prices include destination). \n\nThe Sorento Hybrid isn’t perfect, but if you’re looking for a three-row SUV with thrifty gas mileage, the sacrifices compared with the regular model are small in exchange for big fuel-economy gains.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Key Points:\n\nThe black-trimmed X-Line SX Prestige trim level joins the Kia Sorento Hybrid lineup for the 2026 model year.\nTerrain mode is now standard with all-wheel drive.\nThe 2026 Kia Sorento Hybrid starts at $40,335 (all prices include the $1,445 destination charge).\n\nThe 2026 Kia Sorento Hybrid checks a lot of boxes for families as a three-row, six- or seven-passenger (depending on trim level) SUV that achieves up to an EPA-estimated 36 mpg combined. For the 2026 model year, Kia’s X-Line appearance package is now standard on the range-topping SX Prestige trim level, bringing no new content but featuring black finishes on the wheels and exterior trim pieces. Additionally, Terrain mode is now included on all-wheel-drive variants, adding customized vehicle settings for mud, sand and snow.\n\nThe 2026 Kia Sorento Hybrid is on sale now. The entry-level EX trim starts at $40,335 and the X-Line SX Prestige at $48,635.\n\nRelated: Which Hybrid Vehicles Have All-Wheel Drive?\n\nTrim Levels\n\nThe regular gas-powered Sorento starts at $33,635 and is available in a wide range of trim levels, but Kia figures its Sorento buyers are looking for a little more standard content in the hybrid SUV. The brand only builds the gas-electric model in the top two trims, the EX and X-Line SX Prestige.\n\nThe EX rides on 19-inch wheels and features front LED lighting, heated side mirrors, a power liftgate, keyless entry and starting, and remote start. Its cabin is upholstered in synthetic leather and boasts heated and power-adjustable front seats (10-way adjustable for the driver, eight ways for the passenger), dual-zone automatic climate control, wireless phone charging, and a 10.25-inch touchscreen with navigation and wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.\n\nStandard safety tech on the Sorento Hybrid EX includes forward collision warning with pedestrian and bicyclist detection, automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, lane-centering steering, lane departure warning, blind spot monitors, rear cross-traffic alert, front and rear parking sensors, a driver attention monitor and automatic high beams.\n\nIn addition to its new black exterior bits, the X-Line SX Prestige gets rain-sensing windshield wipers, a panoramic moonroof and LED taillights. Inside, it features perforated leather seating, a 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster, a 14-way power driver’s seat, a 10-way passenger seat, ventilated front seats, a heated steering wheel, heated second-row captain’s chairs, second-row window shades, a Bose sound system and Digital Key 2.0, which allows owners to use a paired smartphone as the vehicle key and remotely monitor the vehicle.\n\nUpgrading to the X-Line SX Prestige reinforces the safety suite with front cross-traffic alert, emergency steering assist, blind spot intervention, Kia’s Highway Driving Assist 2 hands-on semi-autonomous driving technology, a 360-degree parking camera, blind spot cameras, side parking sensors and reverse automatic braking.\n\nRead More About the Kia Sorento Hybrid:\n\n2021 Kia Sorento Hybrid Review: Big Vehicle With Small-Vehicle Fuel Economy\nWhich 3-Row SUVs Offer Captain’s Chairs?\nIs the 2021 Kia Sorento Hybrid a Good SUV? 5 Pros and 5 Cons\nResearch the Kia Sorento Hybrid\nFind Your Next Car\nPowertrain Specs and MPG\n\nA turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine powers the Sorento Hybrid and is assisted by a pair of electric motors for a combined 227 horsepower and 258 pounds-feet of torque. The hybrid powertrain routes its output through a six-speed automatic transmission. The base EX trim comes with standard front-wheel drive; AWD is a $1,800 option on the EX and is standard on the X-Line SX Prestige.\n\nOfficial EPA fuel-economy estimates are not yet available for the 2026 model, but the 2025 FWD Sorento Hybrid returns an EPA-rated 36/36/36 mpg city/highway/combined, while the AWD version is rated at 34/34/34 mpg.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Nearly every automaker today builds a vehicle the approximate size of the Kia Sorento, but the Sorento is one of few offerings in its class that is available as a hybrid with three rows of seating. For the 2025 model year, the Sorento Hybrid receives the cosmetic enhancements that were applied to the non-hybrid Sorento for 2024, which include a larger grille and sharp LED lighting that mimics that of the larger Telluride, as well as a larger standard touchscreen and available digital instrument cluster.\n\nRelated: 2024 Kia Sorento Up Close: The Baby Telluride\n\nPowertrain Specs and MPG\n\nMechanically, the 2025 Sorento Hybrid is unchanged from the 2024 model. It pairs a turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine with an electric motor for a combined output of 227 horsepower and 258 pounds-feet of torque. A six-speed automatic is the only transmission available.\n\nFront-wheel drive is standard on the entry-level EX trim, and all-wheel drive is optional on the EX and standard on the SX Prestige, which Kia abbreviates SX-P. With FWD, the Sorento Hybrid EX gets an EPA-rated 36/36/36 mpg city/highway/combined, while AWD variants are rated at 34/34/34 mpg.\n\nAvailability and Pricing\n\nThe 2025 Kia Sorento Hybrid is on sale now. Full line pricing, including $1,375 destination, is as follows:\n\nEX FWD: $40,065\nEX AWD: $41,865\nSX Prestige AWD: $48,265\nTrim Levels and Safety Equipment\n\nKia’s DriveWise safety suite is standard on the Sorento Hybrid. It includes forward collision warning with pedestrian and bicyclist detection and automatic emergency braking, intersection collision warning, adaptive cruise control, blind spot monitors, rear cross-traffic alert, lane-centering steering, lane departure warning and steering assist, a driver attention monitor, and front and rear parking sensors.\n\nIn addition, the Sorento Hybrid EX includes 19-inch wheels, LED front lighting, a power liftgate, and keyless entry and starting. Inside, it features synthetic leather seating, power-adjustable heated front seats, dual-zone automatic climate control, a 12.3-inch touchscreen with wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, wireless phone charging and six speakers.\n\nThe SX Prestige upgrades the Sorento Hybrid’s safety kit with an improved forward collision avoidance system, blind spot cameras, blind spot collision avoidance, a 360-degree parking camera and rear automatic braking. Highway Driving Assist 2, Kia’s semi-autonomous highway driving system with hands-free lane changes, is also standard on the SX-P. The SX-P also includes LED taillights, rain-sensing windshield wipers, real leather seating, additional front-seat adjustability, ventilated front seats, a heated steering wheel, a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster and a 12-speaker Bose audio system.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nFace-Lifted 2024 Kia Sorento Goes Off-Road With New X-Pro Trim\n2021 Kia Sorento Hybrid Review: Big Vehicle With Small-Vehicle Fuel Economy\nWhich Hybrid Vehicles Have All-Wheel Drive?\nResearch the Kia Sorento Hybrid\nFind Your Next Car\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The Kia Sorento Hybrid was introduced in 2021 as part of the SUV’s redesign. While its larger size, capable powertrain and generous fuel economy left a positive impression on Cars.com editors, one of the SUV’s main drawbacks was the lack of a premium trim option, such as the one offered on the gas-only model. The 2023 Kia Sorento Hybrid crosses that complaint off the list with the addition of the new range-topping SX-P trim. At the expense of affordability, however, Kia has dropped the hybrid’s base S trim, leaving the EX as the most affordable choice with a starting price of $37,885 (all prices include a $1,295 destination fee). Compared to 2022, the SUV’s cost of admission grows by $2,500.\n\nRelated: 2021 Kia Sorento Hybrid Review: Big Vehicle With Small-Vehicle Fuel Economy\n\nWhat’s New?\n\nWith the departure of the Sorento Hybrid S, the EX takes its place as the SUV’s base trim, gaining a standard eight-way power front passenger seat and a frameless rearview mirror. Meanwhile, the new SX-P trim is the most notable addition for 2023. It brings added creature comforts and premium materials to the interior, along with tech upgrades and standard all-wheel drive, a power tailgate, and a more robust safety and driver-assist suite.\n\nPowertrain and MPG\n2023 Kia Sorento Hybrid | Manufacturer image\n\nFor 2023, the Sorento Hybrid’s powertrain carries over: A 1.6-liter four-cylinder with a 44-kilowatt electric motor and 1.5-kilowatt-hour battery pairs with a six-speed automatic transmission, making a combined 227 horsepower and 258 pounds-feet of torque. Front-wheel drive is standard for the EX, while Kia’s AWD system with Drive Mode Select — which includes Comfort, Sport, Eco, Smart modes — is standard on the SX-P and available for the EX (the SX-P also adds a Snow mode). FWD models get a notable fuel economy advantage with an EPA-rated 39/35/37 mpg city/highway/combined; AWD drops the mpg rating to 34/36/33. In addition to the hybrid, the Sorento offers a gas-only and plug-in hybrid variant.\n\nTech and Safety\n2023 Kia Sorento Hybrid | Manufacturer image\n\nEach model gets a standard 10.25-inch touchscreen, built-in navigation, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, wireless charging, and push-button start with Smart Key and remote start. The SX-P adds a 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster and a premium Bose audio system.\n\nAlso standard is the Kia DriveWise safety and driver-assist suite, which bundles features like automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, blind spot collision avoidance assist, rear cross-traffic alert, a driver attention warning system, lane keep assist and automatic lane centering. Adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go and Kia’s Safe Exit Assist also come standard on both trims. The SX-P tacks on a 360-degree camera and blind spot monitor.\n\nTrims and Pricing\n\nThe 2023 Sorento Hybrid is on sale now. The EX starts at $37,885 with FWD (up $500 from 2022); AWD adds $1,800. In addition to the standard features above, the EX comes with heated front seats, Syntex faux-leather upholstery, and a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob. The SX-P starts at $43,685 and gets interior upgrades like perforated leather upholstery with heated and ventilated front seats.\n\nVersus the Competition\n\nThe Sorento Hybrid’s biggest three-row rival is the Toyota Highlander Hybrid, and even with the price increase, the Sorento still comes in below: The 2022 Highlander Hybrid comes in five trims and starts at $40,890 for the base LE and $50,845 for the range-topping Platinum.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nWhat’s New for Kia in 2022?\nThe 2022 Kia Sorento Is a Three-Row Bargain at $30,665\n2022 Kia Sorento Plug-In Hybrid: Kia Launches First Mainstream 3-Row PHEV\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2021 Kia Sorento?\nResearch the 2023 Kia Sorento Hybrid\n\nRelated Video: \n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Coming off a redesign for 2021, the Kia Sorento offers a unique value proposition among three-row SUVs with a smaller footprint and price tag than its competitors. The Sorento returns for 2022 with some key changes to its trim roster. Most notably, a new plug-in hybrid (PHEV) model is added. The 2022 Sorento’s gas-only model sees a small price bump, starting at $30,665. Hybrid models are priced from $35,165, while the PHEV’s price remains under wraps (all prices include destination).\n\nRelated: 2022 Kia Sorento Plug-In Hybrid: Kia Launches First Mainstream 3-Row PHEV\n\nPlug-In Hybrid Available in 2 Trims; Pricing Still TBD\n\nFor 2021, the Sorento offered three engine choices: a 2.5-liter four-cylinder, turbo 2.5-liter four-cylinder and a turbo 1.6-liter four-cylinder hybrid. The 2022 Sorento PHEV adds a fourth powertrain option that balances efficiency with increased power: a 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine and six-speed automatic transmission, paired with a 13.8-kilowatt-hour battery and 66.9-kilowatt electric motor. The PHEV will make 261 combined horsepower (an increase of 34 over the standard hybrid), and is expected to have an all-electric range of 32 miles and a projected rating of 79 mpg-equivalent. It will be offered in two trims: SX and SX-P.\n\nHybrid Models Gain AWD\n\nFor 2021, the Sorento Hybrid came only in front-wheel drive, but an all-wheel drive option has been added for the 2022 Sorento Hybrid S and EX models. Going with an AWD Sorento Hybrid over a FWD model adds an additional $1,800-$2,300 depending on the trim.\n\n2022 Kia Sorento | Manufacturer image\nX-Line Crosses the Line Into New Trims\n\nPreviously only offered on the top SX-P model, the X-Line Package is now offered on the S, EX and SX-P trims for 2022. The package adds AWD with a center-locking differential and drive mode select, plus a more rugged exterior with specific bumpers, roof rack, wheels, exterior trim and X-Line badging. The X-Line Package adds $2,000-$3,700 depending on the trim.\n\nUpgraded Tech and Convenience Features\n\nA 10.25-inch multimedia touchscreen with navigation now comes standard on all but the base LX model. For 2021, the larger screen was standard only on higher-level trims. For 2022, it replaces a smaller 8-inch screen in the outgoing Sorento S and EX models. The top-tier SX-P model gains standard memory seats with 14-way power and a new thigh extender. Heated second-row captain’s chairs are also added as a standard feature on the SX-P.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2021 Kia Sorento: 6 Things We Like and 3 Things We Don’t\nWhat’s the Best 3-Row SUV for 2020?\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2021 Kia Sorento?\n2021 Kia Sorento Hybrid Review: Big Vehicle With Small-Vehicle Fuel Economy\nResearch the Kia Sorento\n2022 Kia Sorento Pricing\n\nThe 2022 Sorento’s gas-only models will start at $30,665 (all prices include a $1,175 destination fee), which is a modest increase of $100 over the 2021 Sorento’s base price. The starting price for the range-topping X-Line SX-P comes in at $44,265 —a $500 increase over the 2021 model’s starting price. The 2022 Sorento Hybrid starts at $35,165, which is a $400 price bump over the outgoing hybrid’s price tag.\n\nIf a smaller cabin isn’t a dealbreaker, the Sorento provides substantial savings for families in the market for an affordable three-row SUV. The 2022 Sorento’s starting price is thousands less compared to midsize competitors including the Honda Pilot ($40,285), Subaru Ascent ($33,420) and its own stablemate, the Kia Telluride ($34,015).\n\nSorento LX FWD: $30,665\nSorento LX AWD: $32,465\nSorento S FWD: $33,465\nSorento X-Line S AWD: $35,465\nSorento EX FWD: $36,565\nSorento X-Line EX AWD: $40,265\nSorento SX FWD: $39,365\nSorento SX AWD: $41,165\nSorento SX-P FWD: $42,265\nSorento X-Line SX-P AWD: $44,265\nSorento Hybrid (HEV) S FWD: $35,165\nSorento Hybrid (HEV) S AWD: $36,965\nSorento Hybrid (HEV) EX FWD: $37,165\nSorento Hybrid (HEV) EX AWD: $39,465\nSorento Plug-in Hybrid (PHEV) SX: TBD\nSorento Plug-in Hybrid (PHEV) SX-P: TBD\n\nRelated Video: 2021 Kia Sorento Review\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
