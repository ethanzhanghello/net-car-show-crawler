      "expert_review": "As record-high new-car prices continue to challenge budget-conscious shoppers, the Kia Soul remains one of the most affordable cars you can buy. Shoppers looking for an affordable car won’t have to stretch their budgets too much to get the latest model: The starting price for the base 2023 Soul LX is up just $500 compared to 2022. Despite updated styling and more safety features, however, the 2023 Soul still lacks all-wheel drive and drops the turbocharged engine offered in previous model years.\n\nRelated: 2023 Kia Soul: More Safety, Less Turbo\n\nWhat’s New?\n2023 Kia Soul | Manufacturer image\n\nThe 2023 Soul’s facelift consists of an updated grille, foglights and daytime running lamps, while the rear gets an updated bumper and new taillights. Other changes include new 17- or 18-inch alloy wheels and two additional two-tone paint combinations.\n\nInside, the cabin is the same as the outgoing Soul with one key difference: Kia’s suite of safety features is no longer reserved for higher trims. All 2023 Souls include forward collision avoidance with pedestrian detection and lane-centering steering, driver attention warning, lane departure warning, high-beam assist and a rear occupant alert.\n\nThe Soul will be offered in four trims for 2023: LX, S, GT-Line and EX; the X-Line and Turbo have been discontinued.\n\nLast Powertrain Standing\n\nThe outgoing 2022 Soul offered an available turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine, but with the Turbo trim gone for 2023, the only remaining engine is a 2.0-liter inline-four-cylinder paired to a continuously variable automatic transmission that makes 147 horsepower and 132 pounds-feet of torque. Unlike many of its subcompact competitors, the Soul does not come with an AWD option; all models are front-wheel drive only. The 2023 Soul is EPA-rated at 28/33/30 mpg (city/highway/combined) for the LX, S and GT-Line, and 29/35/31 mpg for the EX.\n\nTrims, Pricing and Release Date\n2023 Kia Soul | Manufacturer image\n\nThe 2023 Soul LX will start at $21,085 (all prices include a $1,295 destination charge), the S at $23,585, the GT-Line at $24,685 and the EX at $25,385. Starting prices for the LX and EX climb $500 compared to the 2022 Soul, while the S and GT-Line each see a $700 increase.\n\nThe base LX comes with an 8-inch touchscreen with standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and higher trims offer a 10.25-inch touchscreen with navigation and wireless phone charging. The GT-Line adds sporty elements like 18-inch alloy wheels, a flat-bottom steering wheel, and a combination of black synthetic leather and cloth seats with red stitching. The range-topping EX adds heated front seats with premium cloth material, heated side mirrors and more.\n\n2023 Kia Soul | Manufacturer image\n\nTwo new packages are offered on the 2023 Soul LX and GT-Line: The LX Technology Package adds blind spot collision warning, rear cross-traffic alert and 16-inch alloy wheels to the LX for an additional $500. The $2,400 GT-Line Technology Package, meanwhile, adds a Harman Kardon premium audio system, forward automatic emergency braking with cyclist detection and junction-turning capability, and navigation-based adaptive cruise control. Other upgrades include a power driver seat, heated front seats, LED headlights and taillights, high-gloss cabin trim and a cargo management system.\n\nThe 2023 Soul will be available by late summer, according to Kia; the automaker’s website currently allows shoppers to configure the 2023 model.\n\nVersus the Competition\n\nThe 2023 Soul will challenge rivals like the Hyundai Venue (named Cars.com Best Value Car of 2022), Ford EcoSport and Nissan Kicks. While 2023 pricing has not been announced for the competition, the 2022 Venue currently starts at $20,295, the EcoSport at $23,335 and the Kicks at $21,285.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nWhat’s New for Kia in 2022?\nHow We Found the Best Affordable Small SUV\nHere Are the 10 Cheapest New SUVs You Can Buy Right Now\n2023 Kia Sportage Revealed With More Room, More Power, More Style\nResearch the Kia Soul\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Kia Soul?\n\nThe front-wheel-drive Kia Soul is a five-seat compact hatchback with a boxy shape that pays off in the form of a roomy interior and spacious cargo area. Power comes from a 147-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that works with a continuously variable automatic transmission.  Competitors include the Chevrolet Trax, Hyundai Venue and Nissan Kicks.  \n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Kia Soul?\n\nA new Designer Package for the top-of-the-line EX trim level adds 18-inch wheels (up from the EX’s standard 17s), as well as a unique umber interior color with seats wrapped in synthetic leather with cloth inserts.  \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Kia Soul Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nKeyless entry\nCloth upholstery \nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure steering assist\n60/40-split, folding backseat \nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nMoonroof \nHeated front seats \nHarman Kardon premium stereo\nHead-up display\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nAdaptive cruise control\nShould I Buy the 2024 Kia Soul?\n\nThe Kia Soul is a strong value, with a lot of passenger and cargo space for its size and a generous list of standard features for its price. The Soul arguably kicked off a styling renaissance in its class, and variations in wheel design and detailing between its trim levels — including two-tone paint options on the S and GT-Line — give it a lot of character inside and out. Not offering all-wheel drive, however, does limit its appeal.",

A battery-electric version with a 111-mile EPA-estimated driving range is offered in California and Oregon. Competitors include the Mini Countryman, Toyota C-HR and Nissan Kicks. A redesigned Soul debuts as a 2020 model.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2019 Kia Soul?\n\nAutomatic headlights are now standard.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Kia Soul Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include 16-inch alloy wheels, variable-intermittent windshield wipers, cloth upholstery, air conditioning, Bluetooth and a 60/40-split, folding backseat.\n\nAvailable features include heated side mirrors, a panoramic moonroof, cruise control, heated and ventilated front seats, heated rear seats, a heated steering wheel, automatic air conditioning, navigation and a Harman Kardon premium stereo.

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in October 2013 about the 2014 Kia Soul. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2015, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nAs of the 2013 model year, the first-generation Kia Soul was more than 4 years old, and in today’s fast-moving world of vehicle design, that’s quite old (an adjective Kia certainly wouldn’t want associated with its brand). It was time for a complete makeover.\n\nKia delivers with an all-new Soul for 2014, an ever-so-slightly more mature version that still manages to keep its youthful Soul soul.\n\nJust about everything on the 2014 Soul is new — save for the general funky vibe. (Compare the 2013 and 2014 versions side by side here.) The once-trendy segment of square breadboxes on wheels appears to be waning, though the Scion xB and Nissan Cube continue for yet another model year despite continued rumors of their impending demise. Today’s Soul competitors might also include the shapelier Fiat 500L and Mini Countryman. Compare them with the Soul here.\n\nThe 2014 Soul comes in three trims. The base features a 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine with either a six-speed manual or automatic transmission. The Plus and top-of-the-line Exclaim come with a more powerful 2.0-liter and only with the automatic. I drove both the Plus and the Exclaim. See them all side by side here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nKia uses its clever and wildly popular hamster ad campaign to demonstrate the transformation of both the new Soul and the hamsters. The newly refined hamsters have lost quite a bit of weight and have a sleek, modern, hipster boy-band appeal, as does the new Soul.\n\nWhile the Soul retains its iconic square shape with angular side rear windows, the sharp corners have been smoothed out just a tad, as have most of the lines throughout the car. That bit of cheap-looking black plastic that used to run along the side is no longer there distracting the eye.\n\n“Striking the right balance between the original car with its audacious proportion and stance was daunting,” according to Tom Kearny, Kia’s chief U.S. designer. The resulting look and feel are exactly what Kia was after: a design that’s slightly more refined and upscale without losing any of its edge.\n\nThe new Soul is just a smidge larger in almost every direction but up. Its wheelbase has stretched 0.8 inch and its width increased by 0.6 inch. The Soul’s overall height decreased by 0.4 inch.\n\nHow It Drives\nI had the benefit of recently driving the 2013 Soul at home with my backseat test riders scrutinizing every last detail. Check out that review here. While I certainly appreciated the cute, funky fun of this stylish budget-mobile, I was ready to be done with it after a week. The harsh suspension in the previous-generation Soul made the car skip around on me when taking on bumps or rough pavement at speed, and a high level of cabin noise induced some annoyance and fatigue during longer trips.\n\nThere has been drastic improvement in both of these areas in the 2014 Soul. A revised front and rear suspension design takes the edge off of a previously harsh ride, and now the Soul feels more like a real car rather than a toy. While it’s nowhere near soft and floaty, rough pavement is no longer jarring, and larger bumps in the road are absorbed better and recovered from quickly.\n\nAn additional focus on noise damping inside the new Soul was aided by slight improvements to the car’s aerodynamics as well as baked expansion foam sealing (envision that cool purple foam that you see sprayed into a house’s walls on HGTV makeover shows) and a reinforced isolation pad in the floor. These measures in combination have worked. The 2014 Soul was quiet enough inside to carry on a pleasant conversation for the entirety of the six hours I spent as both driver and passenger.\n\nSoul owners tend to use their vehicles for around-town trips, and Kia has improved the feel to be zippier off the line and give just enough of that fun feeling to keep you entertained. While the acceleration fun-factor is a bonus, what goes up must come down, and that includes speed: Initially, the Soul’s brakes feel a bit touchy and over-responsive, but after a few blocks of stop-and-go city driving, I managed to lighten up my touch enough to smooth out the braking.\n\nWhile my drive route through the generally flat farmlands outside of Minneapolis didn’t give me any twisty roads to experience true cornering, the Soul does feature a standard Flex Steer system on all trim levels. This allows the driver to toggle between Sport, Normal and Comfort modes. I tried them out, but my drive route didn’t allow enough diversity to notice any difference between them.\n\nThe Soul Plus’ and Exclaim’s beefier 164-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine with automatic transmission gets an EPA-estimated 23/31 mpg city/highway, a slight bump up from last year’s 23/28 mpg. The base 130-hp 1.6-liter engine gets an EPA-estimated 24/30 mpg, compared with last year’s 25/30 mpg.\n\nIn comparison, the 500L’s automatic transmission gets 25/33/27 mpg city/highway/combined, while the Countryman gets a similar 25/30/27 mpg. The xB gets 22/28/24 mpg.\n\nInterior\nKia has been upping the ante of its products over the past few years, offering add-on features that aren’t available even as extras in their competitors’ cars. This makes Kia’s vehicles customizable for an upscale feeling. If features like a heated steering wheel, heated front and rear outboard seats and ventilated front seats get you as excited as they do me, it might be time to look into a Kia.\n\nThe new Soul’s entire interior has been upgraded from the previous generation’s kitschy, trendy fabrics and cheap-looking hard-plastic surfaces. The 2014 has a softer and more upscale feel with higher-quality texture and finishes. The steering wheel is now covered in hand-stitched leather, which Kia claims is akin to a solid handshake because it’s the one part of the vehicle that the driver is in constant direct contact with. I agree; there’s nothing worse than a limp handshake or flimsy-feeling steering wheel.\n\nAn optional panoramic moonroof opens up the feel of the Soul’s backseat, treating rear passengers to a great sky view. With the exception of the moonroof, backseat passengers weren’t really a driving force in the Soul’s redesign. A Kia engineer told me it’s considered more of a “me-centric” car, referring to the driver.\n\nThe Soul’s increased footprint mostly benefits the front seats, with an additional 0.8 inch of legroom. Headroom up front has also been increased by 0.2 inch, and front shoulder room has been bumped up 0.3 inch. A little bit of love for the backseat passengers was thrown in with an extra 0.2 inch in legroom.\n\nThere are small bottleholders in each of the back doors, a small storage pocket on the back of the passenger’s seat (but not the driver’s seat) and two cupholders in the backseat’s fold-down center armrest. The Soul definitely wasn’t designed as a family hauler, but the backseat’s perfectly flat floor means families that do have to haul kids or teenagers around from time to time can do so with ease of movement for both people and their stuff.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe 2014 Soul features an optional new Android-based connected car operating system called UVO that combines familiar mechanical buttons and dials with an 8-inch capacitive touch-screen. A split-screen option allows the driver to keep an eye on the navigation system while simultaneously displaying the audio screen, requiring less toggling between screens and theoretically less driver distraction.\n\nThe average Soul buyer is about 48 years old, according to Kia. Downsizing boomers will be attracted to the simple button and dial operations. Despite the age of the buyer, the majority of Soul drivers (the kids of the buyers) are expected to be quite young. The younger generation will appreciate the UVO connected car features such as integrated Pandora internet radio operated through the vehicle’s touch-screen and audio controls, so there’s no need to fumble with a smartphone.\n\nThe UVO-connected Soul arrives with a three-month complimentary SiriusXM Data subscription that gives the driver “access to travel information such as road conditions, weather and security alerts as well as sports scores, movie times, stock prices and fuel prices,” according to Kia.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe cargo opening in the new Soul has widened by 2.4 inches, leaving little to no surrounding lip to have to maneuver around when loading stuff.\n\nThe exterior growth has also led to nearly 2 additional cubic feet of storage. To give you an idea of what that looks like, about 7.5 gallons of water could fit in 1 cubic foot of space, so 2 cubic feet makes for a lot of extra ballet shoes for my family of three dancing daughters.\n\nEven though the measured difference is only 1.1 cubic feet, the Soul’s 24.2 cubic feet of total cargo space behind the backseat feels quite large compared with the Fiat 500L’s 23.1 cubic feet, and massive compared with the Countryman’s puny 16.5 cubic feet and the xB’s minuscule 11.6 cubic feet.\n\nSafety\nCrash tests have not yet been conducted on the 2014 Soul.\n\nLatch child-safety-seat anchors in the new Soul are housed within open depressions in the seat bight. While I didn’t have the opportunity to install car seats in the 2014 Soul, my experience suggests it should be seamless. Children in booster seats, however, might get slightly frustrated with the Soul’s backseat seat belt buckles, which are secured with flimsy nylon straps (rather than held upright on stiff bases). These can be more difficult for children with limited dexterity to buckle up.\n\nSee all the standard safety features listed here.\n\nValue In Its Class\nWith an entry price of just $14,700, the Soul is in the perfect position to be the most affordable choice for young hipsters wanting form, functionality, safety and individuality in the car they choose to drive them through their diverse, evolving lives. Add to that the ability to customize the Soul’s features from plain Jane to mighty Max and the car can appeal to a broad range of buyers regardless of age or income level.\n\nemail",

The base 130-hp 1.6-liter engine gets an EPA-estimated 24/30 mpg, compared with last year’s 25/30 mpg.\n\nIn comparison, the 500L’s automatic transmission gets 25/33/27 mpg city/highway/combined, while the Countryman gets a similar 25/30/27 mpg. The xB gets 22/28/24 mpg.\n\nInterior\nKia has been upping the ante of its products over the past few years, offering add-on features that aren’t available even as extras in their competitors’ cars. This makes Kia’s vehicles customizable for an upscale feeling. If features like a heated steering wheel, heated front and rear outboard seats and ventilated front seats get you as excited as they do me, it might be time to look into a Kia.\n\nThe new Soul’s entire interior has been upgraded from the previous generation’s kitschy, trendy fabrics and cheap-looking hard-plastic surfaces. The 2014 has a softer and more upscale feel with higher-quality texture and finishes. The steering wheel is now covered in hand-stitched leather, which Kia claims is akin to a solid handshake because it’s the one part of the vehicle that the driver is in constant direct contact with. I agree; there’s nothing worse than a limp handshake or flimsy-feeling steering wheel.\n\nAn optional panoramic moonroof opens up the feel of the Soul’s backseat, treating rear passengers to a great sky view. With the exception of the moonroof, backseat passengers weren’t really a driving force in the Soul’s redesign. A Kia engineer told me it’s considered more of a “me-centric” car, referring to the driver.\n\nThe Soul’s increased footprint mostly benefits the front seats, with an additional 0.8 inch of legroom. Headroom up front has also been increased by 0.2 inch, and front shoulder room has been bumped up 0.3 inch. A little bit of love for the backseat passengers was thrown in with an extra 0.2 inch in legroom.\n\nThere are small bottleholders in each of the back doors, a small storage pocket on the back of the passenger’s seat (but not the driver’s seat) and two cupholders in the backseat’s fold-down center armrest. The Soul definitely wasn’t designed as a family hauler, but the backseat’s perfectly flat floor means families that do have to haul kids or teenagers around from time to time can do so with ease of movement for both people and their stuff.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe 2014 Soul features an optional new Android-based connected car operating system called UVO that combines familiar mechanical buttons and dials with an 8-inch capacitive touch-screen. A split-screen option allows the driver to keep an eye on the navigation system while simultaneously displaying the audio screen, requiring less toggling between screens and theoretically less driver distraction.\n\nThe average Soul buyer is about 48 years old, according to Kia. Downsizing boomers will be attracted to the simple button and dial operations. Despite the age of the buyer, the majority of Soul drivers (the kids of the buyers) are expected to be quite young. The younger generation will appreciate the UVO connected car features such as integrated Pandora internet radio operated through the vehicle’s touch-screen and audio controls, so there’s no need to fumble with a smartphone.\n\nThe UVO-connected Soul arrives with a three-month complimentary SiriusXM Data subscription that gives the driver “access to travel information such as road conditions, weather and security alerts as well as sports scores, movie times, stock prices and fuel prices,” according to Kia.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe cargo opening in the new Soul has widened by 2.4 inches, leaving little to no surrounding lip to have to maneuver around when loading stuff.\n\nThe exterior growth has also led to nearly 2 additional cubic feet of storage. To give you an idea of what that looks like, about 7.5 gallons of water could fit in 1 cubic foot of space, so 2 cubic feet makes for a lot of extra ballet shoes for my family of three dancing daughters.\n\nEven though the measured difference is only 1.1 cubic feet, the Soul’s 24.2 cubic feet of total cargo space behind the backseat feels quite large compared with the Fiat 500L’s 23.1 cubic feet, and massive compared with the Countryman’s puny 16.5 cubic feet and the xB’s minuscule 11.6 cubic feet.\n\nSafety\nCrash tests have not yet been conducted on the 2014 Soul.\n\nLatch child-safety-seat anchors in the new Soul are housed within open depressions in the seat bight. While I didn’t have the opportunity to install car seats in the 2014 Soul, my experience suggests it should be seamless. Children in booster seats, however, might get slightly frustrated with the Soul’s backseat seat belt buckles, which are secured with flimsy nylon straps (rather than held upright on stiff bases). These can be more difficult for children with limited dexterity to buckle up.\n\nSee all the standard safety features listed here.\n\nValue In Its Class\nWith an entry price of just $14,700, the Soul is in the perfect position to be the most affordable choice for young hipsters wanting form, functionality, safety and individuality in the car they choose to drive them through their diverse, evolving lives. Add to that the ability to customize the Soul’s features from plain Jane to mighty Max and the car can appeal to a broad range of buyers regardless of age or income level.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Exterior & Styling\n\nThe Kia Soul is boxy; given its fairly high ride height, it could be mistaken for an SUV. Its proportions are good and the upright styling helps the Soul stand out in a crowd.\n \nThe Soul Exclaim has a few styling tweaks to separate it from a regular Soul, including red-accented body trim, a chrome grille surround, a unique tailgate badge and dual chrome twin-tip exhaust.\n\nHow It Drives\nInterior\nErgonomics & Electronics\nCargo & Storage\n\nThe Soul has a smaller cargo area than one might expect from its boxy body; the fairly shallow cargo area behind the backseat is closer in size to a sedan’s trunk than a hatchback’s cargo area. If cargo-carrying is important to you, be sure to eye the Soul’s hatch before buying.\n\nKia executed the hatch pretty well by mounting the latch low, so it’s easier for shorter-statured people to reach and open the liftgate. And I don’t think it opens too high for those same folks to close the hatch.\n \nThe Soul’s load floor was also at just the right height: I didn’t have to stoop to get things, but nor will shorter folks likely be challenged by the height.\n\nSafety\n\nThe 2017 Kia Soul received the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s highest rating — good — in its small overlap front test as well as the moderate overlap front, side, roof strength, head restraint and seat tests (see details). For a better look at how the Soul ranks among other small cars in the Institute’s test, click here.\n \nThe Soul doesn’t have as many advanced safety features as some competitors. Our test car was equipped with blind spot warning but lacked the Primo option package that adds forward collision warning and lane departure warning to the Plus trims. Despite its available forward collision feature, however, the Soul doesn’t include autonomous emergency braking. This is a shortcoming, as competitors like the Subaru Impreza (through its EyeSight system) and the Mini Countryman offer some form of emergency braking and adaptive cruise control.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nThe Soul’s sticker price is a bit surprising, if for no other reason than Kia made its name offering cars that were — and in many cases still are — less expensive than its mid-range competitors. But times change, and the Soul — and compact hatchbacks as a whole — haven’t been “econoboxes” for some time.\n \nBoth the Countryman and Impreza are being redesigned for 2017, and while we can’t yet compare the driving experience, a look at their features is helpful.\n\nThe Kia Soul we drove had $5,000 worth of options, including a heated steering wheel, heated seats front and rear, a panoramic moonroof (itself a $1,000 stand-alone option) and a navigation system, as well as Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Its price tag totaled $27,620.\n\nMini says the Countryman will start at $27,450 (all prices include destination charges) and come standard with a panoramic moonroof, rear parking sensors (which our Soul didn’t have) and a sliding and reclining backseat (our Soul didn’t have this, either), but no heated front or rear seats and no heated steering wheel.\n \nThe Impreza’s base model 2.0i hatchback starts at $19,215. It features standard, full-time all-wheel drive (not offered on the Soul), Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Picking higher trims gets you closer to the same content as the Soul, though as of this writing no version had heated rear seats or a heated steering wheel.\n\nSo, based on features and price, the Soul — while expensive — offers features that are competitive or better than what others in the class offer for the same price.\n \nUltimately, the Kia Soul isn’t a slam-dunk winner in its segment. It’s got a lot of content and is a nice size for maneuvering around the city, plus its visibility is good, but the jittery ride alone would make me test-drive some competitors, as well.",

      "expert_review": "Despite its polarizing, too-young-for-some design, the 2013 Kia Soul seems to have just about everything you could need in a car, without inundating you with too many fluffy extras.\n\nLucky for you, a carful of tween girls blasting “Party Rock Anthem” non-stop doesn’t come standard.\n\nThe five-seat Soul is available in three trim levels: base, Soul+ and the Soul! that I drove. Compare the three side-by-side here. If you’re in the market for similarly priced and body-type vehicles, you should also check out the Nissan Cube and Scion xB. See them side-by-side here. The Soul hasn’t changed much since last year’s model, but you can compare the two here.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe Soul really speaks for itself in terms of exterior design. When we first saw it back in 2008, it was aggressively styled with straight lines and square corners, standing out against a backdrop of progressively sleeker cars. With several other similarly shaped cars on the road today, the Soul is no longer the odd man out.\n\nIts modernized-mail-truck look will either appeal to you or not. Between its shape, its features and its fun, youthful marketing, the Soul tends to appeal to a younger market, but quite a few Boomers are driving them, as well, thanks to the Kia’s retirement-friendly price tag and hip-high front seats, which make it easy to get in and out without too much strain or bending.\n\nOne of our reviewers came close to purchasing a Soul for her own small family, based upon its functionality and family-friendly budget, but she concluded she just couldn’t quite jump on the Soul train as a 40-something.\n\nFAMILY-FRIENDLY FEATURES\nThe Soul’s boxy shape lends itself to practical interior cabin space. Backseat passengers not only have plenty of headroom, but also fantastic visibility due to the large expanses of glass and the slightly raised, theater-style rear seat. For young kids with a tendency to motion sickness, the extra-wide view might just keep you from having to stock your glove box full of gallon-sized Ziplocs.\n\nThe 39 inches of backseat legroom was plenty of space for all three of my girls’ (ages 8, 10 and 12) gangly, growing legs. That’s quite impressive compared with the Nissan Cube’s 35.5 inches of rear legroom. The Scion xB falls between the two with 38 inches of rear legroom. There was just enough seat width to squeeze all three of my kids in side by side, with just one of them in a slim Bubble Bum booster seat.\n\nThis extra backseat room, however, comes at the expense of cargo space; there’s just 19.3 cubic feet of cargo space behind the backseat. I was quite surprised by the tiny cargo space the first time I opened up the cargo door. I was expecting more of that Magic School Bus effect, seeing how large this small car otherwise feels on the inside. A few boxes of snacks and water bottles from the warehouse store were about all I could fit. Families with large strollers, wheelchairs or suitcases may need to rethink this car. Still, the Soul’s rear space beats the Cube, which has just 11.4 cubic feet of space. With the backseat folded, the Soul has 53.4 cubic feet of cargo volume while the Cube boasts 58.1 cubic feet.\n\nStorage areas throughout the Soul’s interior helped keep my sometimes-chaotic family-car life a little bit more under control. A small center console up front was just large enough to stash my phone and snacks. In-door storage bins in all four doors, plus netted pockets on the front seatbacks, held all my other odds and ends.\n\nAs the driver, I had access to almost every feature that has become important to me while filtering out the noise of extra features that I don’t use (the lighted stereo speakers that flash along with the music were a gimmicky trick the kids thought was cool — and I turned off the second they stepped out of the car).\n\nI appreciated the remote keyless entry, which is standard on the Soul! trim level, with the added benefit of push-button start that came as part of a $2,500 Premium Package. This package also gave my family two-tone, easy-to-wipe-clean leather seats that were heated up front for my driving pleasure. The standard Bluetooth technology was a cinch to pair with my phone, though the flip side was that it was also a cinch to pair with my 12-year-old daughter’s phone. This gave her the ability to play and replay “Party Rock Anthem” while driving through the school carpool lane, Chick-fil-A and more. Apparently, it was hilarious. Just ask my kids.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nBEHIND THE WHEEL\nThe base Soul has a 138-horsepower, 1.6-liter four-cylinder. The Soul+ and my Soul! test car have an upgraded 164-hp, 2.0-liter engine. All Souls have front-wheel drive, and the base and Soul+ come with either a standard six-speed manual transmission or an optional six-speed automatic. The Soul! is automatic only. Mine had plenty of zip and zing for daily, around-town driving, even while in Eco mode, which can help drivers improve gas mileage. On the highway, however, you really have to nurse the Soul to keep it up to speed, unlike other vehicles that seem to practically drive themselves. Because it lacks cruise control, lots of highway driving in a base Soul would definitely become tiresome.\n\nAlso contributing to driver fatigue over long distances is the Kia Soul’s cabin noise. While the engine is really quite quiet, the Soul shows its budget pricing through lack of noise insulation. Road and wind noise are immediately apparent when driving this car.\n\nMy car’s EPA-estimated fuel economy was 23/28 mpg city/highway. The 2.0-liter with the manual transmission gets an estimated 24/29 mpg. The Soul+ with an automatic transmission is eligible for an optional Eco Package (not the Eco mode that comes in all Souls) with special tires and a provision that turns the engine off and on at stoplights, for an estimated increase of 1 mpg over the regular 2.0-liter automatic.\n\nThe base Soul, with its 1.6-liter engine, is rated 25/30 mpg regardless of transmission.\n\nThe Kia Soul’s tight suspension is fun and sporty-feeling around town, but its inability to absorb and recover from bumps became disconcerting at highway speeds. For example, when taking a curved ramp from one highway to another, the Soul jumped around a bit over the rough bump where the two connected, requiring me to focus and hang on more tightly to the steering wheel so it wouldn’t skip out from under me in the curve.\n\nThe Soul’s tight 34.4-foot turning circle made quick errands a blast, turning on a dime into tight parking spaces that others passed up.\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2013 Kia Soul is an Insurance Institute for Highway Safety Top Safety Pick, having received the institute’s top rating of Good in front, side, rear and roof-strength tests. It hasn’t undergone the small-overlap front test. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gave the Soul an overall crash-test rating of four out of five stars.\n\nAs has been required since the 2012 model year, the Kia Soul has standard antilock brakes, electronic stability control and traction control. The Soul has standard dual advanced airbags in front, front-seat-mounted side-impact airbags and full-length side curtain airbags.\n\nThe Kia Soul! that I drove also had a standard backup camera display (it’s optional on the Soul+ and not available on the Kia Soul base model). While it’s not yet a requirement on cars, we anticipate backup cameras being mandated in the coming years, so having one standard in the Soul! added to my peace of mind in a house full of my kids, nephews, kids’ friends and pets.\n\nFor families installing child-safety seats, the Kia Soul’s lower Latch anchors are shallow within the seat bight, but don’t offer much clearance on the top and bottom of the anchor. This may make installing child-safety seats with rigid Latch hooks difficult. However, seats that use Latch hooks on flexible nylon webbing should be easier to install.\n\nMy two youngest daughters complained about the seat belt buckles in the Soul. Because they’re on floppy nylon bases, they have a tendency to slip and tuck themselves under the back of a booster seat when not in use. So when my daughter climbed in, it was tough for her to locate the buckle without climbing back out of her seat and moving the booster out of the way to find the buckle.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Kia Soul?\n\nThe front-wheel-drive Kia Soul is a five-seat compact hatchback with a boxy shape that pays off in the form of a roomy interior and spacious cargo area. Power comes from a 147-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that works with a continuously variable automatic transmission.  Competitors include the Chevrolet Trax, Hyundai Venue and Nissan Kicks.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Kia Soul?\n\nThe Soul gets a Soulmate Special Edition Package for 2025 that includes 18-inch alloy wheels, a two-tone roof, extra body cladding, an Umber-colored interior with synthetic leather and cloth seats, and a Harman Kardon premium audio system.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Kia Soul Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nKeyless entry\nCloth upholstery\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure steering assist\n60/40-split, folding backseat\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nMoonroof\nHeated front seats\nHarman Kardon premium stereo\nHead-up display\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nAdaptive cruise control\nShould I Buy the 2025 Kia Soul?\n\nThe Kia Soul is a strong value, with a lot of passenger and cargo space for its size and a generous list of standard features for its price. The Soul arguably kicked off a styling renaissance in its class, and variations in wheel design and detailing between its trim levels — including two-tone paint options on the S and GT-Line — give it a lot of character both inside and out. Not offering all-wheel drive, however, does limit its appeal.",

      "expert_review": "As a mom who is always on the lookout for an “anti-Mom” vehicle, the Kia Soul definitely piqued my interest. At first, I questioned its “age-appropriateness” for a lady like me with a baby in the backseat, but after 5 minutes behind the wheel, I really didn’t care.\n\nThe 2012 Kia Soul isn’t just young and cool; it’s convenient, economical and fun for a family to ride around in.\n\nTo many people, the Soul is the “hamster car,” but it’s so much more than that. It’s a fantastic family car disguised in a compact car’s body. The new, more powerful four-cylinder engine in the 2012 model makes this little car quicker on the road, and it’s definitely ready to merge right on to the highway. It’s also a snap to parallel park and easy to maneuver through neighborhoods with twisty roads and in and out of parking lots all over town. Its fuel efficiency makes it a desirable commuter car, too.\n\nAbout three days into my test drive with the Soul, I noticed I was listening to the radio a little louder and running errands a little more often.\n\nThe Kia Soul starts at $13,900 for a base model with a six-speed manual transmission, but my top trim level Soul!, with a six-speed automatic transmission and navigation, costs $22,850.\n\nEXTERIOR\nAt first look, the Soul looks like a miniature SUV. It’s really more of a squared-off station wagon. Not only does its shape set it apart from a traditional station wagon, but it also adds a roominess and functionality that makes a big difference. Bonus points should be awarded for its fun styling, too. While the Alien Green paint color of my test car was definitely not my color of choice, imagining it in Shadow Black made me think that as far as these boxy wagons go, the Soul is definitely the most attractive.\n\nFrom the outside, the Soul looks small. A family may wonder how they’ll all fit into this little box on wheels. The great news is the Soul is taller than a wagon or sedan, but it’s not high off the ground. This strikes the perfect balance between being easy for small children to enter and exit independently, as well as being high enough to load even smaller kids into their child-safety seats without any awkward bending. The combination of the low floor/high roofline and square door openings make it easier than expected for adult passengers to get in and out of it, as well.\n\nThere is a potential deal-breaker for families who like to pack it in: The cargo area is small. A double stroller definitely won’t fit in it, and if you’re one of those people that keeps things in the trunk for just-in-case moments, you’ll definitely disregard the Soul. However, with the generous storage bins underneath the cargo area floor and being able to fit my stroller in the back by standing it up on its side, that issue was resolved for me. No stroller? Your groceries, sports equipment or suitcase will fit just fine. The 60/40-split folding rear seats allow you to fold a seat or two down to increase the cargo space.\n\nThe Soul comes with a standard 135-horsepower, 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine that gets an EPA-estimated 27/35 mpg city/highway. There’s also a larger engine — 160-hp, 2.0-liter four-cylinder — that gets 26/34 mpg. It’s standard in the Soul+ and Soul!. Coupled with a need for only regular unleaded gasoline, it’s economical for a car that warrants such good times on the road.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nINTERIOR\nThe Soul’s interior is quite surprising — all the moms who laughed at me as I endorsed its family wagon capabilities soon stopped after getting inside it. That boxy shape on the outside sure affects how things function on the inside; what you end up with is a roomy cabin.\n\nAlthough the Soul has the capability to seat five, four passengers are probably more ideal. For my family of three, everyone had plenty of room, and another passenger in the backseat would’ve had no complaints if they joined us. Legroom was good for my front-seat passengers with a rear-facing child-safety seat behind them. Cupholders are available for four passengers, and there is a fair amount of storage for a car of this size.\n\nWhat’s even better is the Soul’s interior styling is just cool. My top-trim level Soul! had optional leather seats, but I wish it would’ve come with the hounds-tooth cloth seats. Yes, hounds-tooth! It’s something to get excited about for anyone who values style and a little personality. And, the Soul! can be equipped with navigation, push-button start with smart key and an upgraded sound system.\n\nFrom the outside, the car may look like it’s geared toward a teenager, but with even more available luxuries like heated seats and an multimedia system with a backup camera, the Soul can satiate families who appreciate upgraded features. Remote keyless entry and Bluetooth connectivity come standard.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2012 Soul has been named a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. To receive this safety nod, a car must earn the top score of Good in frontal-offset, side-impact, rear and roof-strength crash tests. It received an overall rating of four stars of five in crash tests by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. It got four stars out of five in frontal and rollover crash tests and five stars in the side-impact crash test.\n\nYou might not expect it, but child-safety seats are easily accommodated by the Soul. Front-row legroom wasn’t compromised too much when I had my rear-facing infant-safety seat installed in the back. There are two sets of lower Latch anchors in the outboard seats, but they’re buried in the seat cushions, causing a struggle when trying to access them. The Soul’s high ceiling offset this frustration because I never had to worry about bumping my head while moving around to get the car seat installed properly. See how the 2012 Soul performed in Cars.com’s Car Seat Check here.\n\nThe Soul’s standard safety features are front-wheel drive, all-disc antilock brakes with brake assist, active front head restraints, an electronic stability system with traction control and six airbags, including side curtains for both rows. A backup camera is standard on the highest trim level, but available on the other trims.\n\nGet more safety information on the 2012 Kia Soul here.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in April 2009 about the 2010 Kia Soul. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2011, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nFor a guy in his 20s, I am terminally unhip. I checked out this week’s Billboard chart toppers, and I remain skeptical that Flo Rida is anything but a Sun Belt state. It’s safe to say I am not one of the trendsetters Kia pegged to drive its 2010 Soul, a new hatchback that goes the way of the Scion xB and Nissan Cube. These cars are supposed to be cool.\n\nIs the Soul? Perhaps, but as it turns out, the question is irrelevant. Whatever you think of its styling, it’s hard to debate that the car packs a lot of value for the money, even for a value-oriented econohatch. That should appeal to plenty of buyers, hip or not.\n\nTrim levels include the base Soul, Soul+ (“Soul Plus”), Soul! (“Soul Exclaim”) and Soul Sport. (I’m sticking with Plus and Exclaim — no symbols, bro.) I tested a Soul Plus with an automatic transmission. All trims come standard with a stick shift; an automatic transmission is not available on the symbol-less base model.\n\nYouthful Styling?\nRelative to the xB and Cube, the Soul looks the most conventional — a bit like a miniature delivery truck. Compared to any other cars, though, its styling is left-field nutty. Some may decide the bug-eyed headlights and stunted tail have a certain charm. Others may find the whole look too cartoonish to take seriously. I never warmed to it, but most Cars.com editors disagree: It’s unique, it’s different, they said. It’s the sort of look young drivers will go for. While they’re listening to Flo Rida, apparently.\n\nAt about 162 inches long, the Soul falls halfway between the Cube (156.7 inches) and xB (167.3). Sixteen-inch alloy wheels are standard on the Soul Plus, while the Exclaim and Sport get 18-inch rims — impressive for a sub-$20,000 car.\n\nInside\nIf the Cube gets the award for richest interior materials and the xB wins for overall roominess, the Soul comes out ahead in cabin design. Click here for a full rundown on all three interiors. Suffice it to say Kia stuck to conventional shapes, so you won’t find the upright facings and hard contours that both competitors employ. This feels distinctly more carlike, and elegantly so: Though the materials are hard to the touch, most have a textured finish that looks entirely respectable. The gauges have high-rent, if uninspired, backlighting, and the A/C dials and turn signals move with sturdy, well-oiled precision. Other areas lapse to econobox standards — the center console armrest is rock-hard, and the flip-down grab handles slam shut — but on the whole, quality is good.\n\nI’m not as enthusiastic about the roominess. Relative to other small hatchbacks, there’s less space around the gearshift for your knees to spill out. Headroom is good, even in my moonroof-equipped test car, but the driver’s seat has limited range to move forward and back. I’m 5-foot-11, and I could have used an inch or so more rearward travel room. Driver’s seat height adjustment is standard on all but the base model, but a telescoping adjustment for the steering wheel is unavailable. Telescoping steering is still rare among small cars, but with cars like the redesigned Honda Fit and Ford’s upcoming Fiesta getting it, it’s clearly on the rise. So to speak.\n\nThe backseat is adult-friendly, though the cushions could sit a bit higher for better thigh support. Amenities are limited: Cupholders are limited to one in each door-pocket cutout, and there’s no center armrest, which the Cube offers. Folding the seats down creates 53.4 cubic feet of maximum cargo room, which is decent compared to the larger hatchback field, but less than the Cube and xB offer.\n\nHatchback Roominess Compared\n \tKia Soul\tNissan Cube\tScion xB\tHonda Fit\tToyota Yaris\nBase price\t$13,300\t$13,990\t$15,750\t$14,750\t$13,305*\nBehind 2nd row (cu. ft.)\t19.3\t11.4\t21.7\t20.6\t9.5\nBehind 1st row (cu. ft.)\t53.4\t58.1\t69.9\t57.3\t25.7\n*Four-door hatchback; two-door hatch starts at $12,205.\nSource: Manufacturer information for 2009 models, except 2010 Soul.\n\nNo-Frills Driving\nPiloting the Soul is a forgettable experience — it’s competent enough to satisfy on the daily commute, but it’s never really fun. I found power around town adequate, even with two additional occupants and some light cargo. A 122-horsepower, 1.6-liter four-cylinder goes in the base Soul, which only comes with the five-speed manual transmission. All other trims, including my test car, have a 142-hp, 2.0-liter four-cylinder. It teams with the five-speed manual or a four-speed automatic.\n\nAt higher speeds, a fifth cog in the automatic might help. Its lack is especially noticeable in 30-to-50 mph highway traffic, where 2nd and 3rd trade places frequently: Second gear is clearly at the end of its rope, but 3rd leaves you short on power. I haven’t yet driven the Cube, but the xB, which also has a four-speed auto but gets the Camry’s 2.4-liter engine, has enough oomph to overcome such issues.\n\nYou’ll pay for that in the xB’s gas mileage, though. It’s EPA-rated at 24 mpg combined, versus 26 to 28 mpg for the Soul, depending on drivetrain. As of this writing, the Cube has yet to be rated, but other hatches, from the Yaris to the Fit, get slightly better mileage.\n\nThe Soul’s suspension — a semi-independent setup in back, as most entry-level cars employ — filters out small bumps, but it responds noisily over anything moderate. On the highway, rough surfaces creep up through the seats and steering wheel; over time you’ll feel the undulations and seek out smoother lanes.\n\nCurvy roads produce modest body roll, but the steering retains a planted feel over rough pavement. The Soul Sport gets a sport-tuned suspension, which I didn’t test. Noise levels in the Soul Plus remain low up to about 65 mph, where wind noise off the A-pillars starts encroaching on music and conversation. Strangely enough, it’s at that same speed that the steering wheel gains a comfortable weightiness at the 12 o’clock position that makes it easy to barrel down the highway. At lower speeds there’s a bit too much power assist, rendering light, twitchy responses and the need for periodic steering corrections.\n\nThough antilock brakes are standard, the base Soul gets rear drum brakes; all other trims have four-wheel discs. The discs are strong, providing linear pedal response and firm stopping power.\n\nSafety\nAs of this writing, the Soul has not been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. It may be worth waiting to see how IIHS scores pan out, considering Kia’s track record for small cars. Despite having six airbags each, the Soul’s entry-level siblings, the Rio and Spectra, have unacceptable Poor and Marginal side-impact ratings, respectively.\n\nLike the xB and Cube, the Soul comes standard with side curtain airbags, antilock brakes, traction control and an electronic stability system. That last feature is especially rare in the entry-level segment. Click here to see all the Soul’s safety features.\n\nFeatures & Pricing\nThe Soul’s $13,300 base price gets you air conditioning, a CD stereo with full iPod compatibility, power windows and locks and the full range of safety features. That’s more than impressive — it’s very nearly unbelievable. Consider: At similar prices, hatchback competitors like the Versa, Yaris and Chevy Aveo5 have crank windows, rudimentary stereos and, in most cases, no antilock brakes, let alone a stability system. The Cube, also well-equipped, starts at $700 more; the xB runs an extra $2,450.\n\nMove up the Soul chain, and you can get keyless entry, steering-wheel audio controls, power mirrors, cruise control and a moonroof. With all the options checked, the range-topping Soul Sport runs $18,600.\n\nIt’s worth noting that Kia’s standard warranty — with five-year/60,000-mile bumper-to-bumper and 10-year, 100,000-mile powertrain provisions — is among the best in the industry. It’s not fully transferrable to subsequent owners, however, as some policies are.\n\nSoul in the Market\nKia is onto something. The automaker’s sales have held steady through March of this year amid a meltdown that has brands from Honda to Ford reeling, and the new Soul is reportedly selling briskly. Tough times call for inexpensive transportation and plenty of features for the buck. Kia’s lineup is brimming with precisely those types of cars. The fact that the Soul also has a bit of personality is icing on the cake; provided its crash tests pan out well, it’s certainly worth a look.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2022 Kia Soul?\n\nThe front-wheel-drive Kia Soul is a five-seat compact hatchback with a boxy shape that pays off in the form of a roomy interior and spacious cargo area. Power comes from a standard 147-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that works with a continuously variable automatic transmission, or an optional 201-hp, turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder that pairs with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic.  Competitors include the Hyundai Venue, Nissan Kicks and Toyota C-HR.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2022 Kia Soul?\n\nThe base LX trim level gets a larger 8-inch touchscreen multimedia system, while S, X-Line and GT-Line trims add a 10.25-inch touchscreen with navigation, dual-zone automatic air conditioning, push-button start, a wireless device charger and dual USB ports.\n\nWhat Features in the 2022 Kia Soul Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nKeyless entry\nCloth upholstery\n60/40-split folding backseat\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nMoonroof\nHeated front seats\nHarman Kardon premium stereo\nHead-up display\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane-keeping assist\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nAdaptive cruise control\nShould I Buy the 2022 Kia Soul?\n\nThe Kia Soul remains a strong value, with lots of interior space for a vehicle its size. A few things are missing, however, including all-wheel drive and comparatively few standard active safety features.\n\nTo get the turbocharged engine you’ll have to upgrade to the top trim level, which negates some of the Soul’s money-saving appeal. Of all the Soul’s trims, the S is the best deal, with a larger multimedia screen and safety features like automatic emergency braking, lane-keeping assist and blind spot warning.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2020 Soul stylishly updates the hatchback’s boxy look and is more fun to drive, but keeps its practicality, value and quirky personality.\n\nVersus the competition: The urban-friendly hatchback’s lower trim levels offer a ton of value without feeling like econoboxes. The pricey top-trim turbo model, however, climbs up to a zone of stiffer competition.\n\nThe Kia Soul rolls into its second decade and third generation with its soul intact. The city-size hatchback is all-new, with more modern tech and better driving manners, but it retains its core practicality and value. It’s all wrapped in a new version of its boxy styling that still reminds me of a 1990s flying-toaster screensaver.\n\nCompetition has come and gone and come again. Boxy rivals of the past — the Nissan Cube and Scion xB — didn’t last, but new competitors include subcompact hatchbacks such as the Nissan Kicks and Toyota CH-R. The new Venue from sibling brand Hyundai will join the fray soon, too. All are chasing urban buyers and first-time buyers wanting to move away from used vehicles. Unlike similar-size small SUVs, these competitors avoid the complexity and weight of all-wheel drive, making them cheaper to buy and drive. In this group, the Soul continues to lead with a well-done redesign on a new platform.\n\nOne thing is less quirky, however, for 2020: The cutesy trim level names (formerly + and !) switch to the more Kia-like LX, S, X-Line, EX, GT-Line and GT-Line Turbo. We drove both a mid-level X-Line, which has added features and an appearance package, and a top-of-the-line Turbo.\n\nStylish Change of Mood\n\nThe 2020 sports a new face, replacing the old version’s big-eyed smile with a crankier expression. Squinting daytime running lights connected by “unibrow” trim sit over a trapezoidal grille with a perpetual frown. The headlights are tucked into lower bumper openings, where you’d expect to find foglights. It’s a more butch look, as is the more rugged X-Line’s extra body cladding, which breaks up the familiar slab side a little. In the rear, the still-flat roof runs to a liftgate that’s wider and lower for better access. The vertical taillights now connect across the top and turn in at the bottom to nearly surround the rear window. The roof has a “floating” look thanks to a Soul logo dividing the back pillar, and you can get it in contrasting colors on some trim levels.\n\nRiding High\n\nThe tall interior feels open and roomy for the Soul’s size, with lots of headroom and high, chairlike seating. The front seats are still smallish and firm, but they’re slightly bigger and better bolstered than the previous generation’s; I found them comfortable. The rear seat is a standout for a subcompact, with plenty of headroom and legroom, a high (still firm) cushion and a comfortable seatback angle for adult riders, though the rising beltline makes it a little dark. Visibility to the front and sides is very good, though the rear window remains Soulfully small.\n\nThe cabin’s quietness is improved almost to the level of some more expensive rides, and materials have been spruced up, too. There’s still generous use of cheaper plastics, but there’s also softer surfaces on the places you touch most. The Soul rises above feeling cheap with creative design elements, such as a 3-D trim pattern on the upper doors, interesting triangular air vents and color accents. X-Line and higher trim levels get a chunky, leather-wrapped steering wheel. The X-Line has interesting cloth and vinyl upholstery, while the GT-Line Turbo has imitation leather.\n\nBetter packaging adds useful space. Door panel cutouts increase the bin size, center console storage is roomier, and under the center dash is a useful phone space (which can have a wireless charging pad in the top three trim levels). It sits above 12-volt and USB ports. Cargo space behind the backseat is still modest, but it’s up 5 cubic feet — to 23.8 — with the dual-level rear cargo floor in its lower position, 18.7 with it higher (making a flatter load floor). It’s a little less space than the Kicks but more than the C-HR. Folding the rear seats opens up 62.1 cubic feet.\n\nNo Model Is Tech-Deprived\n\nA 7-inch touchscreen is standard on most trim levels, but the more expensive EX and GT-Line Turbo get a 10.25-inch widescreen system with newer software and navigation. The main advantage of the bigger screen is a useful split-screen function, but the base screen and system are fine. Both of Kia’s multimedia systems remain among the easiest to use, though both were a little slow to react to my touch. All trim levels include Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration.\n\nThe GT-Line Turbo keeps the Soul’s signature music-lighting gimmick, with selectable color lighting in the 3-D door trim that can synchronize to a beat. An acceptable six-speaker audio system is standard, while the GT-Line Turbo gets 10-speaker Harman Kardon premium audio. That one is good, if a little too boomy for some ears.\n\nA new feature on the GT-Line Turbo is an 8-inch head-up display, but it got the thumbs-down from multiple drivers. It uses an old-school plastic reflector atop the dashboard, not an image on the windshield, and we all found it hard to see and set too low for taller drivers. That’s in contrast to the Soul’s new heated steering wheel, which got a (warm) thumbs-up.\n\nPeppy or Turbocharged\n\nA revised and less buzzy 147-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder is under the hood of all Souls except the GT-Line Turbo, replacing the former base 1.6-liter and midrange 161-hp 2.0-liter. Despite fewer horses, it feels peppier around town than the old 2.0-liter thanks to quick throttle response, and it’s adequate on the freeway. (Don’t ask about the old base engine.) A new electric version of the Soul is also coming.\n\nThe new engine is mated to a standard six-speed manual on the base model, while others get a new-design continuously variable automatic transmission that first appeared in the redone 2019 Kia Forte compact sedan. It’s mostly unobtrusive and reasonably quiet. Artificial shift points limit the inherent CVT tendency to let the engine rev high while the car catches up; unless you mash the gas pedal, it can almost seem like a conventional automatic.\n\nThe more-grins option is the GT-Line’s 201-hp, turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic that carries over from the 2019 Exclaim trim level. There is some brief lag off the line, but low-end torque is strong and the dual-clutch automatic is well-behaved, with none of the jerkiness some of its breed can have. Paddle shifters let you control shifts.\n\nBoth test cars had automatic engine stop-start systems to improve mileage, and both seemed overly eager to shut down and a hair slow to restart. We learned the system will restart without rolling if you slightly let up on the brake pedal, which made it more manageable. Gas mileage is improved, with the base engine EPA-rated 27/33/30 mpg city/highway/combined. The turbo checks in at 27/32/29 mpg.\n\nPlayful Nimbleness\n\nDespite its height, the Soul stands out among rivals such as the Kicks for a chassis that feels planted and has good body control. Steering is direct and precise, though light. Cars.com reviewer Mike Hanley aptly described the Soul’s handling dynamics as “playful nimbleness.” That was true of both the X-Line, with the base suspension, and the GT-Line Turbo, with a sportier tune. Coupled with its tidy footprint, that agility makes the Soul an excellent companion for city traffic.\n\nA downside of that firm suspension, however, is a sometimes busy and choppy ride on rough city streets. The ride is much improved for 2020, and it’s not harsh, but despite a wheelbase that’s an inch longer, the 2020 Soul remains short between the axles. That’s great for parking and squirting through traffic, but it’s hard on ride composure over dips and broken pavement. Both our test cars had 18-inch wheels — the biggest offered. The 16s or 17s on other trim levels might ride a little better.\n\nSafety: It’s Complicated\n\nThe 2020 Soul expands the availability of advanced safety and driver assistance tech, but you’ll need a scorecard to track it by trim level — except for the base LX, which offers none.\n\nS and EX trim levels come with a standard safety bundle that includes forward automatic braking, blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert, lane keep assist, lane change assist and a driver attention warning. The X-Line, meanwhile, which slots above the S in starting price, has lane keep assist and blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert, but offers no other features. The GT-Line with the 2.0-liter engine has much of the safety bundle standard, except lane change assist and blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert, which are available only in a $1,900 package that includes a moonroof.\n\nThe top-level GT-Line Turbo has all of those safety features, plus it adds adaptive cruise control and a more robust front collision system with pedestrian detection. The adaptive cruise control was a disappointment, however, because it doesn’t work to a stop. It comes irritatingly close (working to about 5 mph), then deactivates, alerting you in the instrument cluster that you’re on your own. Blame the manual parking brake.\n\nThe 2020 Soul has not been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. Once it is, results will replace the 2019 rating.\n\nExcellent Value\n\nThe Soul starts at $18,485 for a base LX, which undercuts the base Kicks ($19,685) and C-HR ($22,240) — not to mention most subcompact SUVs, even with front-wheel drive (all prices include destination charges). And all Souls come with Kia’s five-year/60,000-mile warranty, plus 10 years/100,000 miles on the powertrain. Compare the Soul, Kicks and C-HR here. The X-Line trim level we tested was an excellent value at $22,615, including some extra features and appearance upgrades — though oddly without most of the safety tech that’s on the S model, which is $1,200 cheaper to start. You can compare the features of all 2020 Soul trim levels here.\n\nThe GT-Line Turbo piles on features and is more fun to drive, but the test car’s $28,485 sticker puts it in a tougher realm, near (depending on your taste) a sportier 2019 Volkswagen Golf GTI hatchback or a well-equipped subcompact SUV with all-wheel drive, such as a 2019 Honda HR-V EX-L. I’m all for more power, but most Soul shoppers would likely be happy (and up to $4,000 wealthier) in a fully optioned EX or GT-Line Soul with the peppy base engine.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2021 Kia Soul?\n\nRedesigned last year, the front-wheel-drive Kia Soul is a five-seat compact hatchback with squared-off styling and a roomy interior. Power comes from a standard 147-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that works with a six-speed manual or a continuously variable automatic transmission. The Turbo trim level gets a 201-hp, turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder that teams with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. Competitors include the Nissan Kicks, Toyota C-HR and Volkswagen Golf.  \n\nWhat’s New on the 2021 Kia Soul?\n\nA rear-seat reminder feature is now standard, and EX and Turbo trim levels gain key-fob-based remote start. Meanwhile, X-Line and GT-Line trims get updated shock tuning.  \n\nWhat Features in the 2021 Kia Soul Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nCloth upholstery \n60/40-split, folding backseat \n7-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nAir conditioning\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nMoonroof \nHeated front seats \nHeated steering wheel\nCruise control\n10.25-inch touchscreen navigation system\nHarman Kardon premium stereo\nIlluminated speakers\nWireless device charging\nHead-up display\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane-keeping assist\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nShould I Buy the 2021 Kia Soul?\n\nThe Soul’s optional turbocharged engine delivers good power, but the hatchback’s ride can get bouncy on imperfect pavement. The lack of all-wheel drive may be a deal-breaker for some shoppers, but the Soul offers a lot of value along with good interior space.",

      "expert_review": "Back before the Earth cooled, JCPenney and other fine retail outlets sold a component stereo system whose speakers pulsed with colored lights in sync with the music. There also was, it seems to me, a Wurlitzer organ that had dancing lights in the speaker cabinet. In the 1970s, this qualified as staggeringly awesome.\n\nSo I was surprised — and not a little nostalgic — to see this “technology” show up in the 2010 Kia Soul Sport, a fervid box of discount hipness targeting audio-obsessed teens and twentysomethings.\n\nOur $18,345 test car was equipped with six speakers (including a center channel and subwoofer) powered by an external amp pushing enough decibels to loosen one’s grip on bodily functions.\n\nThe door speakers have LED lights built in that throb to the music. Please be advised that, if you are sitting in the grocery store parking lot at night grooving out to Katy Perry, and you are in your late 40s, you will look like a demented old man.\n\nThe Soul is a cool-looking little gizmo penned with confidence if not gall: The bold upward window sill line, the deep beveling around the windows, the outsized fender flares, the frog-eyed headlamps and vertical tail lamp assemblies. Pull it all together and the Soul looks like a Land Rover LR2 that had its way with a Scion xB. Well done.\n\nOther than its resolute boxiness, the Kia Soul recommends itself primarily on the basis of price, and I must say the Soul delivers a significant amount of kit for the money: power accessories, keyless entry, fog lights, lots of tarty sport trim (roof spoiler, side sills, front bumper and side moldings) and fairly racy 18-inch wheels and tires.\n\nIs it fun to drive? God no. It’s a shopping cart, an eight-cornered wheelbarrow. Powered by a 2.0-liter, 142-hp four-cylinder engine and five-speed manual transmission, the Soul moans like a poltergeist under hard acceleration.\n\nThe steering feels vague and the car corners skittishly. The clutch and brake pedal couldn’t feel more numb if you had an epidural, and the shift lever feels like a spoon in an empty cake bowl.\n\nThe Soul — with MacPherson strut front suspension and torsion beam rear — is built on a modified Kia Rio platform, which I don’t believe is on anybody’s list of mind-blowing sporters.\n\nThe Soul is certainly drivable and pleasant. But fun? The Soul falls somewhere between having your teeth cleaned and Vacation Bible School.\n\nNote: If the anesthetized torpor of the five-speed-equipped car proves to be too much, you can choose a four-speed automatic for no extra cost. Still too hairy? The base model comes with a 1.6-liter, 122-hp four-binger.\n\nHere’s the thing, though: The target audience is not much interested in driving fun, per se, at least as we defined it back in my carbureted youth.\n\nFor the Kia’s first-car audience, fun means being able to pile your friends in the back — and the vast rear doors and large back seat make that easy — and heading out for an affordable night of self-inflicted hearing damage. Fun means a warranty that won’t expire until after you get out of graduate school. Fun means being able to make your car payment. Fun means affording the gas. The Soul Sport gets quite decent fuel economy of 30 miles per gallon on the highway.\n\nFor financially assisting parents, the Soul offers the consolation of lots of safety gear, including stability control, six air bags and active headrests.\n\nThe Soul scored five stars in both Europe’s NCAP and the feds’ NHTSA crash test rating. Having your kids come home in one piece is fun too.\n\nThe atman of this car resides in the interior, and it doesn’t disappoint . . . much. The seats are mounted high on pedestals so there’s plenty of legroom to go with the vast headroom (Sarah Palin supporters need not doff their moose-antler hats).\n\nThe high-design, two-tone interior — red/black in our “Molten” red test car — looks great. The center stack’s audio and climate controls are easy to reach and operate. Most of the dash is covered in a kind of dot-pattern soft plastic, like the rubbery grip tape you’d put on a skateboard. It’s nice.\n\nThe big problem with the interior is that the hard plastic on the doors and interior panels is easily scuffed. The driver’s door of the test car was already pretty well scarred when I got to it. I expect Kia soon will rethink its choice of materials for this high-wear area.\n\nHow does the Soul stack up against the segment’s benchmark, the Honda Fit?\n\nIncontestably, the Fit is a better-engineered car and more fun in stick-and-rudder driving. But the Soul has a lovely, expansive feel to it, and it’s a screaming value.\n\nThe Soul joins the Scion xB, Honda Element and the new Nissan Cube in the boxy boxing ring, and I think it will do just fine.\n\ndan.neil@latimes.com",
