      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nBased off the recently redesigned front-wheel-drive Kia Soul subcompact, the new Soul EV joins the growing list of small battery-electric vehicles on sale primarily in the coastal states in order to comply with increasingly stringent zero-emissions mandates that require a percentage of an automaker’s sales to be zero-emissions vehicles.\n\nExterior Highlights\n\nThe new Soul EV doesn’t look much different from the standard Soul, which already received a 2014 update inside and out to incorporate cues from Kia’s popular Track’ster concept car. The main visual differences between the conventional gasoline-powered car and the EV are in external trim — the EV has a solid grille where the charging ports are hidden, 16-inch wheels with a design borrowed from the Optima Hybrid and a two-tone paint scheme that looks positively Mini Cooperish.\n\nInterior Highlights\n\nAlthough the Soul EV looks little changed from the normal Soul, there are some EV-specific differences in the cabin. Two seat options are available: a standard dark cloth with blue stitching or optional dark gray leather with blue piping. Kia has upped the eco-friendly plastic content of the interior as well, using organic plant-based plastics for 19 different interior parts.\n\nKia’s UVO multimedia system is standard, as is navigation and a suite of apps designed specifically for EV operation that can show things like the location of nearby charging stations. The gauges are replaced by a low-energy LED display, which features all of the requisite meters for EV operation, state of charge and more. The car also features a novel air conditioning system that allows the driver to select a number of modes designed to minimize electrical draw from the car’s battery. A driver-only setting on the system can shut off ventilation to the passenger-side front position and the rear positions to focus heating or cooling on the driver.\n\nUnder the Hood\n\nThe Soul EV is an all-electric battery-powered vehicle featuring a 109-horsepower electric motor driving the front wheels through a single-speed gear reduction transmission. The battery itself is a 27-kilowatt-hour air-cooled lithium-ion pack located under the vehicle floor, which will provide the car 93 miles of range, according to the EPA.\n\nRecharging happens through one of three methods. Full recharge takes about 24 hours on a standard household 120-volt Level 1 outlet and drops to about five hours on a 240-volt Level 2 fast charger. A third option is a 480-volt DC “CHAdeMo” fast charger, typically only available at industrial locations or commercial charge stations, which can recharge the car to about 80 percent in just 33 minutes. The battery pack does intrude somewhat into the cabin, eliminating 3 inches of rear-passenger legroom.\n\nThe car should get from zero-to-60 mph in less than 12 seconds according to Kia, and is limited to a top speed of 90 mph. Regenerative brakes are standard and have the ability to recapture up to 12 percent of the car’s energy when coasting or braking. The regenerative brakes offer four selectable modes to allow drivers to customize the response and aggressiveness.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Kia Soul?\n\nThe Kia Soul is a boxy compact hatchback with room for five people. It comes with front-wheel drive and a choice of three four-cylinder engines, including a turbocharged one. Three transmissions are available: a six-speed manual, a six-speed automatic and a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic. A battery-electric version with a 111-mile EPA-estimated driving range is offered in California and Oregon. Competitors include the Mini Countryman, Toyota C-HR and Nissan Kicks. A redesigned Soul debuts as a 2020 model.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2019 Kia Soul?\n\nAutomatic headlights are now standard.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Kia Soul Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include 16-inch alloy wheels, variable-intermittent windshield wipers, cloth upholstery, air conditioning, Bluetooth and a 60/40-split, folding backseat.\n\nAvailable features include heated side mirrors, a panoramic moonroof, cruise control, heated and ventilated front seats, heated rear seats, a heated steering wheel, automatic air conditioning, navigation and a Harman Kardon premium stereo. Available active safety features include adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning, blind spot warning and rear cross-traffic alert.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Kia Soul?\n\nThe Soul and Soul EV have been redesigned for the 2020 model year and hit dealerships in spring 2019. The 2020 models have better gas mileage, and the all-electric version has a significantly longer 243-mile EPA range. But if you’re looking for deals, you should be able to find them on leftover 2019 Souls still on dealer lots.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nBased on the recently redesigned front-wheel-drive Kia Soul subcompact car, the Soul EV in 2015 joined the growing list of small battery-electric vehicles on sale primarily in states that mandate zero-emissions vehicles.\n\nThe Soul EV uses a 109-horsepower electric motor driving the front wheels through a single-speed gear reduction transmission. The battery is a 27-kilowatt-hour, air-cooled lithium-ion pack under the floor that provides a 93-mile driving range, according to the EPA. The battery pack eliminates about 3 inches of rear legroom.\n\nRecharging happens through one of three methods. A full recharge takes about 24 hours on a standard household 120-volt Level 1 outlet and drops to about five hours on a 240-volt Level 2 fast charger. A third option is a 480-volt DC fast charger, typically only available at industrial locations or commercial charge stations, which can recharge the car to about 80 percent in just 33 minutes.\nNew for 2016\nA lower-priced Soul EV-e model is available in California and it comes without features such as navigation and a backup camera that are standard on other models. All models get an illuminated MP3 jack and USB port and a lock for the charging port nozzle. The top-of-the-line Plus model gets a new Fun & Sun Package that includes a panoramic sunroof, LED interior lighting and speaker lights that pulse to the beat of the audio system.\nSignificant Standard Features\n\n109-horsepower electric motor\n27-kwh, air-cooled lithium-ion pack\nSingle-speed transmission driving front wheels\n16-inch alloy wheels\nAir conditioning with driver-only ventilation mode\nHeated front seats and steering wheel\nDriver-selectable steering assist\nBluetooth connectivity\nRequired in every new car: front airbags, antilock brakes and an electronic stability system\n\nSignificant Available Features\n\nPanoramic sunroof\nLeather upholstery\nVentilated front seats\nHeated outboard rear seats\nUVO multimedia system\nNavigation system with 8-inch display\nPower-folding side mirrors\nRear camera\nParking assist with front and rear sensors",
