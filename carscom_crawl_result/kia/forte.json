      "expert_review": "Entering its fifth year since a major redesign and with rumors of a replacement on the way, the Kia Forte is little changed for 2024. For the new model year, the GT-Line trim gets some newly standard safety tech, and the GT-Line Tech Package is no longer available.\n\nRelated: Here Are the 10 Cheapest New Cars You Can Buy Right Now\n\nPowertrain Specs and MPG\n\nThe Forte’s standard engine remains a 2.0-liter four-cylinder that makes 147 horsepower and 132 pounds-feet of torque. It’s mated to a continuously variable automatic transmission; front-wheel drive is standard. Fuel economy with the 2.0 ranges from an EPA-estimated 30/41/34 mpg city/highway/combined in base LX Trims to 28/39/32 mpg with the XLS and GT-Line.\n\nThe Forte GT packs a turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder with 201 hp and 195 pounds-feet, matched with either a six-speed manual transmission or a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic. The dual-clutch automatic is rated at 27/35/30 mpg, while the manual demands a real commitment from its buyer, with fuel economy dropping to 22/31/26 mpg.\n\nComputerized Vigilance\n\nEven the base Forte LX boasts a competitive suite of safety tech, with forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning and lane departure steering assist all standard. Blind spot monitors and rear cross-traffic alert are optional on the LXS and standard on the GT-Line and GT. For 2024, the GT-Line gets standard pedestrian and cyclist avoidance, an electronic parking brake, navigation-based adaptive cruise control and Highway Driving Assist, which combines lane-centering steering and Lane Following Assist.\n\nPricing\n\nPrice increases for the 2024 Forte are just a few hundred dollars from the 2023 model year. Full pricing, including $1,125 for delivery, is as follows:\n\nLX: $20,915\nLXS: $21,415\nGT-Line: $23,415\nGT: $25,615\n\nComfortable and efficient, the 2024 Kia Forte is also priced below many competitors: The 2024 Nissan Sentra starts at $21,725, the Volkswagen Jetta at $22,585, the Hyundai Elantra at $22,590 and the Toyota Corolla at $22,995.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nWhat’s Changed for the 2023 Kia Forte?\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2021 Kia Forte?\nReport: These Are the Vehicles Most Likely to Be Stolen\nWhich New Cars Have Manual Transmissions?\nBackseat Dangers: Small Cars Fumble in Updated IIHS Crash Test\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "If you’re bucking the SUV tide and buying a non-luxury compact sedan, I’d wager that value ranks high on your list of needs. Drivability, safety or quality might factor in, but for any choice to make sense, it must save cents.\n\nRelated: 2019 Kia Forte Gets More Stylish, More Efficient\n\nIn that light, the third-generation Kia Forte sedan makes boatloads of sense. Lavished with advanced safety and convenience features even in its sub-$20,000 variants, Kia’s redesigned sedan packs heavy appeal for value-oriented shoppers. But a few loops behind the wheel suggest the Forte’s drivability won’t draw too many others.\n\nAt the Midwest Automotive Media Association’s 2018 Fall Rally in suburban Chicago, I drove a well-equipped Forte EX, the highest of four trim levels for the sedan. (As of this writing, the Forte5 hatchback remains in prior-generation form.) Read on for our early take, and stay tuned for a full review after we get a Forte for longer evaluations at Cars.com HQ.\n\nAbout That Automatic\n\nA continuously variable automatic transmission replaces last year’s six-speed automatic as the Forte’s two-pedal option. Kia spilled plenty of virtual ink over its purported distinctions from other CVTs, but the results don’t live up to the talk. Tasked with doling out power from the sole available engine — a 2.0-liter four-cylinder with 147 horsepower and 132 pounds-feet of torque — the transmission exhibits all the telltale droning and rubber-band nonlinearity of other CVTs, and not the best examples.\n\nToe the gas for more power and the gearbox alters ratios to simulate the upshifts and downshifts of a conventional stepped automatic — but it takes a lot of pedal to get there, and the engine’s modest power lends little exhilaration along the way. It doesn’t have to be this way: The Honda Civic’s CVT feels more serviceable when paired with the car’s optional turbo 1.5-liter four-cylinder, while the Toyota Corolla Hatchback’s excellent CVT beats the pants off both.\n\nKia’s effort is efficient, at least. EPA combined mileage in the Forte is an impressive 34 mpg for most versions, up 2 mpg versus last year’s automatic-equipped, base-engine Forte. (A direct-injected four-cylinder with more power but less efficiency was optional last year; it isn’t available now.) The base trim, dubbed FE, offers a 35-mpg automatic version, as well as a six-speed manual rated at 31 mpg combined; we drove neither one.\n\nRide and Handling\n\nWe’ll need more seat time to weigh in with certainty, but my quick take on ride and handling is mixed. A slow steering ratio and numb feedback sell the Forte’s reflexes up front as soupier than a bowl of minestrone, but the feedback improves on evasive maneuvers and sustained curves. Understeer comes as the EX’s Kumho Solus P225/45R17 tires reach their limits, though selective braking from our test car’s stability system intervened in unexpected but effective spurts to help rotate the axis a few degrees.\n\nThe steering exhibits acceptable weightiness at higher speeds, but it needs more assist at lower speeds — a takeaway reinforced when I jumped in a Mazda3 for a back-to-back drive. It’s no surprise that the Forte is less viscerally exciting than Mazda’s fun-first compact. It’s less acceptable that Kia also penalizes you with more steering effort around parking lots, driveways and other such commuter-car environs.\n\nRide quality, like handling, will require longer loops and rougher roads to evaluate. My brief drive suggests competent, if unexceptional, underpinnings. They’re certainly an improvement on the firm-riding Forte S at Cars.com’s 2017 Compact Sedan Challenge, but that car had the Forte’s then-optional sport suspension, so it’s not quite an apples-to-apples comparison.\n\nRoom, Quality and Value\n\nA low center console ensures plenty of knee clearance up front, where both seats now enjoy standard height adjustments. The backseat remains roomy, and adult passengers will appreciate a little more seating height this time around (the prior Forte’s low bench left your knees uncomfortably elevated), but the remedy comes at some expense to headroom.\n\nThe dashboard emphasizes width, with an 8-inch touchscreen perched above the center controls. It’s an attractive layout, if ubiquitous among recent redesigns across the industry. Materials quality doesn’t advance much beyond the outgoing Forte, but it’s competitive with the class.\n\nA few top options from the prior car are now gone — a memory driver’s seat, power-folding mirrors, leather seats — but our EX test car’s vinyl upholstery felt lush enough, and I suspect few shoppers will miss the extravagances in light of the Forte’s many more standard features. Among them are dual-zone automatic climate control and the touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, plus a host of safety tech: forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning and lane-centering steering at higher speeds.\n\nThe fact that you can get all of that with the automatic transmission on two sub-$20,000 trim levels — with Kia’s excellent warranty included — should draw plenty of budget-conscious shoppers even amid the market’s current SUV tilt. My time behind the wheel suggests underwhelming drivability, but given the class, Kia’s overwhelming value should compensate just fine.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2022 Kia Forte?\n\nThe five-seat Kia Forte compact sedan competes with highly regarded models like the Honda Civic, Hyundai Elantra and Toyota Corolla. Most trim levels are powered by a standard 147-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that drives the front wheels through a continuously variable automatic transmission. A 201-hp, turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder powers the GT trim level, which is offered with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic or a six-speed manual transmission. You can see how the Forte scored in our Car Seat Check here.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2022 Kia Forte?\n\nThe Forte gets front and rear styling updates, with GT-Line and GT trims featuring LED foglights and taillights. Wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity is now standard, and a 10.25-inch touchscreen navigation system is available. Lane-centering steering is now standard, too.   \n\nWhat Features in the 2022 Kia Forte Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\nCloth seats \nAir conditioning\n8-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane-keeping assist\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nAlloy wheels\nPower moonroof\nDual-zone automatic air conditioning\nSimulated leather upholstery\nHeated and ventilated front seats\n60/40-split, folding backseat\nHarman Kardon premium stereo\nWireless device charging\nAdaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability\nRear automatic braking\nShould I Buy the 2022 Kia Forte?\n\nThe Forte was already a good compact sedan, and the design updates for the 2022 model year help keep it looking fresh.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Kia Forte?\n\nThe 2023 Kia Forte is offered in four trims (LX, LXS, GT-Line and GT) and is pitted against other small sedans like the Honda Civic, Hyundai Elantra and Toyota Corolla. The standard powertrain consists of a 147-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that drives the front wheels via a continuously variable automatic transmission. It’s a good choice for fuel economy, but straight-line speed is not its (ahem) forte. A zippier 201-hp, turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder powers the GT trim, which can be had with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic or six-speed manual. If you plan on toting little ones around on a regular basis, be sure to check out how the Forte fared in our Car Seat Check.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Kia Forte?\n\nAfter receiving a design refresh and infotainment upgrade last year, the Kia Forte sees no notable changes for 2023.   \n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Kia Forte Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\nCloth seats \n8-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nDriver drowsiness monitor\nLane departure warning\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure steering assist\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nAlloy wheels\nPower moonroof\nDual-zone climate control\nSimulated leather upholstery\nHeated and ventilated front seats\n60/40-split, folding backseat\nHarman Kardon premium stereo\nWireless device charging\nAdaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability\nRear automatic braking\nShould I Buy the 2023 Kia Forte?\n\nThe 2023 Kia Forte is perfect for anyone who wants an ample supply of tech and safety features without having to load on pricey option packages or climb to more expensive trim levels. While the Forte’s base four-cylinder is frugal on gas, performance on tap is mediocre; the optional turbo four, however, gives the Forte some get up and go. There’s ample space for adults in the first and second rows, and the cabin itself is filled with quality trim pieces.",

      "expert_review": "When I’m watching “American Idol,” I often wonder how many potential contestants who try out for the show are good, but not great. If you heard them singing at your school or church you’d probably think, “Dang, they’re good!” In Hollywood, however, they’re not impressive enough to stand out in the crowd. These people are like the 2010 Kia Forte. The Forte is a good car. But, in the words of “Idol” judge Simon Cowell, it risks being forgettable.\n\nCan this car be a winner? Ask Kris What’s-His-Name or the Soul Patrol guy. Sometimes, with the right blend of charisma, it can, but this segment of cars rarely pulls off a Kelly Clarkson, especially in the family category.\n\nThe Forte’s 173-horsepower, 2.4-liter four-cylinder was really peppy. Like a nervous “Idol” contestant, it was almost hyper, but I adjusted my lead foot accordingly. It was a bit of a trick to get the front-wheel-drive Forte tamed in the snow and ice, but the car’s traction control system helped. It wasn’t ideal, but I wasn’t stuck at home, either.\n\nMy test car, the top-of-the-line SX, had a sport-tuned suspension. I was excited to try it out, but it didn’t thrill me. This isn’t a car I’m going to be racing around a track, and for the kind of everyday driving I do, the Forte does just fine.\n\nIf I were Paula, er…Kara, I’d say, let’s give it a chance! Is the Forte goin’ to Hollywood?\n\nExterior\n\nLike a perky “Idol” contestant, the Forte SX looked promising. The exterior is modern looking and sports a nice grille and fog lights. The 17-inch wheels are sporty and fun, and there are relatively few cheap-looking plastic accents. The Forte really does look the part of a fun, inexpensive car that young up-and-comers might like to drive.\n\nEven better, the Forte looks good from the back (and if you think that doesn’t matter, just ask a woman who’s buying jeans). The taillights and sculpted trunk are so attractive that the Forte appears to be a fancier, more upscale car from the rear. That being said, it doesn’t beat you over the head with its glitziness. There are no superficial accessories here, folks. It just looks good and doesn’t need all kinds of chrome and special paint to divert your attention.\n\nThe Forte’s doors were easy for my kids, ages 5 and 7, to open and close. I bet younger kids would also do just fine on that front. You may want to watch your head when you’re getting the kids into their child-safety seats, as I bonked mine a few times on the door frame. I guess that’s an occupational hazard of owning a sedan.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair\n\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Some\n\nInterior\n\nThe interior is really the best part of this car. It’s the Forte’s forte! (Sorry, I couldn’t resist.) The leather-trimmed seats are comfortable and heated, which made me happy. Granted, heated leather seats are optional and will cost you $1,000, but when the base price is $17,495, an extra $1,000 seems worth it.\n\nThere’s a good balance of silver- and black-colored plastic trim, not enough to irk me or make me feel like this car is something it’s not. All the dials and gauges were well laid out and easy to read. This is a car that has everything you want and nothing you don’t.\n\nThe center console had room for a small bag of wipes and a few other items, and the top shelf can house lip balms or cell phones. Actually, you’d probably put your cell phone on the cool shelf above the gearshift. It’s a flat space with a grippy bottom and two 12-volt outlets, an MP3 jack and a USB input right in front of it. Nice space planning, Kia!\n\nIn the backseat, the kids had plenty of legroom, even with my husband’s seat pushed all the way back. The cupholders are located in the center armrest, which is a kid-friendly position and much appreciated by this mom.\n\nThe Forte’s trunk is huge, and 60/40-split backseat folds down easily to accommodate longer items. I’m not sure the Forte’s the next “American Idol,” but based on the interior, this Kia’s definitely going to Hollywood!\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSafety\n\nThe Forte offers enough room in the second row to fit a rear-facing child-safety seat, and its Latch connectors are out in the open and easy to use. There’s no digging between seat cushions to use them. The tether anchors were easy to find, too. My kids’ booster seats fit well, too. However, the backseat’s seat belt receptors are floppy, which can frustrate younger kids who are just learning how to buckle up by themselves.\n\nThe Forte comes with standard antilock brakes, an electronic stability system and traction control.\n\nKia packed the Forte with dual-stage front-impact airbags, side-impact airbags for the front row and side curtain airbags for both rows. Nice.\n\nFAMILY LIFESTAGE\n\nIn Diapers: The second row is roomy enough to fit a rear-facing child-safety seat.\n\nIn School: Kids will also appreciate the backseat legroom and the easy-to-reach cupholders.\n\nTeens: This is good first-car material here, folks.",

      "expert_review": "The compact-car segment has been revitalized in as little as three years, adding value, style and new features in a segment previously filled with ho-hum commuter cars. Kia’s previous-generation Forte is a competent car, but “competent” is the romantic equivalent of a woman referring to a guy as “nice.” The old Forte was outshined immediately after its introduction by more stylish and refined cars like the Chevrolet Cruze, Honda Civic and Hyundai Elantra, which bested the Forte in Cars.com’s comparison of 2012 compact cars.\n\nThe redesigned 2014 Kia Forte is a complete turnaround from the old car, now oozing style, and Kia’s best driving refinement to date.\n\nFortes are available in base LX and higher-optioned EX models for 2014. I drove a fully loaded 2014 Forte EX at a Kia event in Arizona; the LX wasn’t available. Pricing is said to start at less than $16,000 for LX models with a manual transmission, though the Forte can be optioned with flashy upscale features uncommon to the segment that could jack up the price considerably.\n\nUnfortunately, full pricing and fuel-economy ratings aren’t available at the time of this writing.\n\nStyling\nThe new styling exhibits a smart, attractive blend of curves and angular lines, and not too much of either. A lower roofline and additional overall length and width give the new Forte a less frumpy appearance. Some of the Forte’s look may seem familiar, such as the grille design used in other Kia products, though I’m having a hard time not seeing the Ford Focus sedan’s rear end on the 2014 Forte. Regardless, the bright taillights give the rear a unique flash with 81 LEDs in each taillight.\n\nAll cars Kia provided to us were in an electric blue exterior paint color and shared equipment like the optional 17-inch wheels. So this Forte looks great, keeping in mind that we haven’t seen lesser trim levels with wheel covers or a different color. I suspect the overall attractiveness won’t wane much with smaller wheels or different paint.\n\nDriving Refinement: Nailed It\nKia’s 2014 Forte takes a huge leap forward in ride comfort, with a quieter interior and pleasant-riding suspension that doesn’t thwack or ride cheaply over rough roads like the outgoing Forte and many of Kia’s other small cars. The Forte rides with the composure and quietness of a larger car, an accomplishment the Focus and Chevrolet Cruze have also achieved.\n\nThe new chassis — shared with the Hyundai Elantra — is stiffer than the one on the outgoing Forte and has a longer wheelbase to improve ride quality. The new chassis teams with additional sound insulation for improved resistance to noise. The Forte resists those intrusions more proficiently than the Elantra.\n\nAdditionally, the Forte EX’s more powerful engine is one of the most refined four-cylinders offered in any Kia, including the Optima. The 173-horsepower 2.0-liter is virtually silent while offering adequate power, but for an upgrade engine it’s not exciting or performance-oriented in any way. The Forte’s handling doesn’t wow in the performance department, with more body roll than fun-to-drive small cars like the Focus and Dodge Dart. The Forte strikes a good balance of sportiness and comfort, though it leans toward the latter.\n\nThe less powerful engine, which should be the most popular choice, wasn’t available for testing. The base 1.8-liter four-cylinder makes 148 hp and comes with a six-speed manual transmission standard or an available six-speed automatic. More expensive EX models receive the 2.0-liter with higher-tech direct fuel injection. The 2.0-liter pairs only with the automatic.\n\nInterior\nThe inside mirrors Kia’s successful midsize Optima sedan with a center console canted toward the driver for easier reach and use. The Forte doesn’t make any significant interior quality strides, having soft-touch materials similar to the rest of the increasingly nice compact-car segment. A few touches stand out, including a soft-touch dashboard and carbon fiber pattern around the center console, replacing what could have been additional painted plastic.\n\nDespite relatively unchanged overall interior volume, which is spacious for the class, the Forte’s cabin takes a hit of almost an inch in front-seat headroom and 0.3 inch in the rear. Even so, at 6 feet tall, I was perfectly comfortable up front, as was my co-pilot of the day who measured 6 feet 5 inches. In the rear, though, the low seating position elevated my knees more than I’d like.\n\nVisibility is a mixed bag, but not in the traditional way of obstructive pillars. Over-the-shoulder visibility to the sides is actually great, with additional quarter windows added to the rear doors. The rearward visibility is minimized because of the high trunk line and short rear window. An available backup camera helps when reversing. Shorter drivers should pay attention to rearward visibility to see if it’s a deal-breaker.\n\nA Trunk Golfers Will Love\nAt 14.9 cubic feet, the Forte’s trunk is generously sized for a compact car. The Cruze’s trunk is 15.4 cubic feet, though others like the Honda Civic (12.5 cubic feet) and Ford Focus (13.2 cubic feet) come up short. The Elantra is 14.8 cubic feet. Big trunk measurements are dandy, but trunk size doesn’t mean squat if the opening is small. The Forte’s trunk opening is extremely wide and gains 2 inches of width for 2014. It’s ready to swallow golf clubs, strollers and other wide-load items. All models feature a 60/40-split folding rear seat.\n\nFeatures\nToday’s compact-car shoppers have it good. Many convenience features are newly available, but you can expect to pay for them. The new Forte leads the way with niceties formerly seen only in upscale cars: Heated front and rear seats, heated steering wheel, ventilated driver’s seat, 4.2-inch dashboard display, power side mirrors with turn-signal indicators, xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights, 10-way power adjustable driver’s seat with two memory positions, smart key with proximity access and more are options on the 2014 Forte.\n\nMany of the upscale features are available only on the pricier EX, including the standard next-generation UVO system. UVO with eServices is powered by Google and uses a smartphone application to provide services like connecting to 911 when airbags deploy, enhanced roadside assistance, car diagnostics and more. By using a smartphone, Kia is able to include these services at no charge; typically, features like OnStar have their own cellular hardware onboard. UVO is launching with Apple iOS compatibility first, followed by an Android application.\n\nStandard LX equipment for the sub-$16,000 starting price includes 15-inch steel wheels with wheel covers, projector-beam headlights with halogen bulbs, USB input, Bluetooth phone connectivity, steering-wheel audio controls, air conditioning, power windows and locks and more. Some notable features missing from the LX are remote keyless entry, cruise control and automatic transmission.\n\nKia hinted at pricing at the event, saying a base LX with the Popular Package that adds 16-inch alloy wheels, cruise control, keyless entry and a sliding front armrest should cost around $18,500 with an automatic transmission. The fully loaded EX that I drove with leather, navigation and more will likely retail well north of $20,000 when pricing is eventually announced.\n\nSafety\nThe 2014 Kia Forte hasn’t been tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration at the time of this writing. Standard safety features include the federally required antilock brakes, electronic stability control, front airbags and tire pressure monitoring system. The Forte also has front-seat-mounted side-impact airbags, side curtain airbags for front and rear occupants as well as hill start assist as standard equipment.\n\n2014 Kia Forte in the Market\nFew cars blend style and high-quality ride comfort in the compact class as well as the Forte; those that do go by the names of Civic, Cruze and Elantra, which are three of the most popular cars in the segment. The Forte should be perfectly capable of competing with the segment’s top dogs as long as Kia delivers competitive fuel economy and value.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in February 2013 about the 2014 Kia Forte. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2015, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe compact-car segment has been revitalized in as little as three years, adding value, style and new features in a segment previously filled with ho-hum commuter cars. Kia’s previous-generation Forte is a competent car, but “competent” is the romantic equivalent of a woman referring to a guy as “nice.” The old Forte was outshined immediately after its introduction by more stylish and refined cars like the Chevrolet Cruze, Honda Civic and Hyundai Elantra, which bested the Forte in Cars.com’s comparison of 2012 compact cars.\n\nThe redesigned 2014 Kia Forte is a complete turnaround from the old car, now oozing style, and Kia’s best driving refinement to date.\n\nFortes are available in base LX and higher-optioned EX models for 2014.

The Forte also has front-seat-mounted side-impact airbags, side curtain airbags for front and rear occupants as well as hill start assist as standard equipment.\n\n2014 Kia Forte in the Market\nFew cars blend style and high-quality ride comfort in the compact class as well as the Forte; those that do go by the names of Civic, Cruze and Elantra, which are three of the most popular cars in the segment. The Forte should be perfectly capable of competing with the segment’s top dogs as long as Kia delivers competitive fuel economy and value.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "The 2013 Kia Forte is kind of like an iPhone 4 living in an iPhone 5 world. The 4 still works great (I mean, I still have one) and has most of the features of the new one, but it’s missing the sleekness and sexiness of the new one.\n\nThe 2013 Kia Forte 5-Door is competent and performs well, but it’s lacking in the desirability department.\n\nThe Korean automaker will be addressing this with its redesigned 2014 Forte sedan and hatchback, which is due in dealerships this summer. Read the 2014 Forte’s review.\n\nIn the 2013 Forte, Kia delivers a lot of bang for the buck, making it worth a look for budget-conscious families looking to stretch their dollar, and dealers might be offering deals on the 2013 model to make way for the redesigned 2014. I test drove the 2013 Forte 5-Door, which ups the cool factor a little, and the hatchback really comes in handy on family duty. Unfortunately, the feeling behind the Forte’s steering wheel is mediocre.\n\nI was expecting a little more zip to pair with Kia’s young, fresh image, and it had it, but the steering was a little loosey-goosey for my taste. The 2.4-liter four-cylinder’s acceleration and the Forte’s handling weren’t a problem when I drove it for a week, but I have driven Forte competitors that handled much better.\n\nThe 2013 Forte starts at $16,175 for the sedan and $19,075 for the 5-Door, but my upgraded SX hatchback test car with navigation, traffic and a leather interior cost $24,250, including a $775 destination charge.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThere seems to be two camps when it comes to hatchbacks: People typically love them or hate them. I find that the body style can add a little youthfulness to the car’s design. However, the Forte 5-Door looks basic to me and doesn’t have some of the sportier design elements that the Ford Focus, Mazda3 or even the Volkswagen Golf does.\n\nHowever, looks aren’t everything. The hatchback makes shopping easy by providing easy-breezy access to the cargo area. Older kids can easily help parents load sports equipment or overnight bags. With the Forte 5-Door, there’s more cargo room — it measures a whopping 19.4 cubic feet — than the Forte sedan’s 14.7 cubic feet. We drove the car up to the mountains for the weekend and it handled our overnight bags and baby gear just fine. A double stroller probably won’t fit in the Forte hatchback, but grocery bags, luggage and single strollers can easily be accommodated. The 60/40-split folding backseat allows for expansion of the cargo area.\n\nThe Forte 5-Door sits low to the ground, making it easy for little ones to get in and out of it easily. My toddler did great getting inside the car independently. I also liked that the design wasn’t so drastic that I risked hitting my head when getting her strapped into to her child-safety seat, which is a common problem for me in many cars these days.\n\nThe Forte has a standard 156-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that gets 26/36 mpg city/highway. The top-of-the-line SX gets more power from a 2.4-liter four-cylinder that makes 173 hp. I found its fuel-economy estimates of 23/32 mpg to be high; I came in considerably lower than that during my weeklong test drive.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Some\n\nINTERIOR\nThe Forte 5-Door’s interior features many of the automaker’s strengths. Kia provides a lot of features at a value price, which is one of my favorite things about it.\n\nBecause the 2013 Forte is in its final year of its current generation, the navigation graphics looked dated, but everything works all the same. I found the center stack and controls straightforward and easy to use. I was pleased to find my upgraded test car had push-button start and keyless entry as well.\n\nThe Forte isn’t a large car — this compact hatchback seats five — but it doesn’t feel small inside. I didn’t feel cramped behind the wheel, and my husband had enough legroom in the front passenger seat. However, families with children in rear-facing safety seats may want to wait to get into a car like the Forte until their child graduates to a facing-forward child-safety seat.\n\nThe Forte comes equipped with an ample amount of storage space, considering its size. It has four cupholders — two in front and two in the backseat — along with additional bottleholders in the front-door cutouts, a decent-sized cubby under the center stack and a center console.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): More than fair/less than Ample\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2013 Kia Forte has been named a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. It earned the top score of Good in moderate-overlap front-impact, side-impact, rear and roof-strength crash tests. It hasn’t undergone IIHS’ latest small-overlap frontal crash test. It received an overall safety score of four stars out of five from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. It earned four stars in frontal, side and rear tests, but in the side-impact crash test, the rear door hit the torso of the crash-test dummy positioned in the backseat.\n\nThe Forte has standard front-wheel drive, four-wheel-disc antilock brake with brake assist, an electronic stability system with traction control, active head restraints and six airbags, including side curtains for both rows. A backup camera is optional.\n\nThe five-seater has two sets of lower Latch anchors in the backseat. They’re deeply set into the seat cushions but didn’t cause me any grief when installing my daughter’s car seat. Installation went quickly and painlessly. A maximum of two car seats can fit in the Forte’s backseat.\n\nGet more safety information on the 2013 Kia Forte 5-Door.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in August 2011 about the 2011 Kia Forte. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2012, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nKia’s compact Forte gains a four-door hatchback version for 2011. Along with a sedan and a coupe, buyers have three body styles to choose from, which is more than most competitors offer.\n\nIt’s true that cars have gotten a lot better lately, but that doesn’t mean they’re all equal — and the compact-car segment illustrates this perfectly. There’s a clear gap between the impressive redesigned Hyundai Elantra and the Toyota Corolla, a car that’s fallen considerably behind the competition.\n\nThe 2011 Kia Forte is an acceptable, midpack small car, but as the compact class improves, it doesn’t distinguish itself.\n\nI tested two versions of the 2011 Forte: an EX sedan with an as-tested price of $19,040, and an SX hatchback that stickered at $23,685. To see how the Forte stacks up against some of its main competitors, click here. Or you can see how it fared in our compact sedan shootout.\n\nClean Lines\nI’ve liked the Forte’s design since its 2010 debut. The car’s crisp, clean lines give it an upscale appearance that belies its low starting price. A number of stylish competitors have entered the mix since then, including redesigned versions of the Ford Focus and Elantra, but the Forte’s lines still hold up well.\n\nThose same good looks carry over to the hatchback, which retains the creased design theme of the sedan and coupe. Finishing touches on our SX trim level included a small liftgate spoiler and 17-inch alloy wheels.\n\nFour-Cylinder Power\nWith the standard 2.0-liter four-cylinder, the Forte EX sedan is as quick as an Elantra, but the engine is noticeably coarser. For 2011, Kia replaced the previous year’s optional four-speed automatic transmission with a six-speed automatic. The four-speed automatic was one of my chief problems with the car when I first reviewed it, but the new six-speed automatic just trades one problem for another.\n\nUnlike the four-speed automatic, which was eager to shift into 4th gear, thereby sapping engine power, the new automatic stays in 1st and 2nd gears longer than a six-speed should need to — and longer than others in the segment do. As a result, you hear the raspy engine more.\n\nThe optional 2.4-liter four-cylinder quickly accelerated the SX hatchback. Like the sedan, the hatchback has a touchy gas pedal, which can sometimes overstate an engine’s power, but kickdowns nonetheless produced a burst of speed. Most compact-car shoppers won’t want for power with this engine, though it’s just as coarse as the 2.0-liter four-cylinder I tested in the sedan.\n\nThe 2.0-liter four-cylinder and the 2.4-liter four-cylinder get an EPA-estimated 26/36 mpg city/highway and 23/32 mpg, respectively, when paired with the automatic. Those are respectable numbers, but they’ve been surpassed by automatic-transmission versions of the 2011 Elantra (29/40 mpg) and the 2012 Honda Civic (28/39 mpg).\n\nRide & Handling\nOn the whole, the Forte offers controlled suspension responses, but bigger bumps can be jolting; the cabin shudders slightly when you hit particularly large ones. This is a firm-riding car, no matter if you’re considering an EX sedan or an SX model like our hatchback, which comes with a sport-tuned suspension. The 2012 Civic does a better job of cushioning blows from broken pavement.\n\nThe steering, meanwhile, doesn’t live up to the expectations set by the Forte’s firm suspension. You expect it to be sporty, but in reality it doesn’t do much to engage you. The Forte goes where you point it, but it doesn’t encourage you to drive it hard. For the enthusiast-oriented compact-car buyer, the Mazda3 remains one of the best choices out there.\n\nThe Inside\nInterior quality has become a battleground in the compact segment, and you can see the results of manufacturers’ efforts in the 2011 Chevrolet Cruze, 2011 Elantra and 2012 Focus. Where a high-grade interior was once a way for an automaker to stand out from the rest of the class — like Volkswagen with its Jetta — it’s now part of the price of entry.\n\nWhile decent, the materials in the Forte are a half-step behind some of the newer competition, like the Elantra and Cruze, but the intuitively placed, logically designed controls help make up for that: It’s easy to get in the Forte and understand all the controls after just a quick look around the dash. That might not seem like much, but the new Focus, for one, has stereo buttons that are hard to use.\n\nOur EX sedan had nice-looking woven seat fabric, while the SX hatchback had an optional Leather Package with heated leather front seats that added $1,000 to the car’s price. The front seats are comfortable.\n\nThe backseat offers more headroom for adult passengers than the Elantra, but the bench seat’s thigh support isn’t as good as you’ll find in a Civic. Taller occupants will encounter limited legroom.\n\nThe hatchback body style increases the Forte’s cargo-carrying capability, but not as much as you might expect. The sedan’s trunk measures 14.7 cubic feet, while the hatchback has 19.4 cubic feet. Still, the hatchback — with its larger cargo opening and taller cargo area — provides a level of versatility versus the sedan that people like.\n\nSafety\nThe 2011 Forte sedan earned 2011 Top Safety Pick status from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, having received Good overall scores in frontal-offset and side-impact crash tests, as well as IIHS’ roof-strength and whiplash-protection tests. The designation also demands that an electronic stability system be offered, and one is standard on the Forte.\n\nIn National Highway Traffic Safety Administration tests, the Forte received four out of five stars in frontal, side-impact and rollover tests. Marring those results is a safety concern stemming from the side-impact crash-test results: During the test, the cabin door panel hit the torso of the dummy in the rear seat, increasing the chance of injury.\n\nAdditional standard safety features include antilock brakes, side-impact airbags for the front seats, side curtain airbags for both rows of seats, and active front head restraints.\n\nFor a full list of safety features, visit the Standard Equipment & Options page. To see how well various child-safety seats fit in the Forte, check out MotherProof.com’s Car Seat Check.\n\nForte in the Market\nThe Forte is a perfectly acceptable car, but being acceptable is no longer enough in the compact class, which is populated by overachievers. A look at the results of our recent Compact Sedan Shootout tells the story: The Forte placed fourth out of five cars. The Forte has only been around a few years, but it’s already time for Kia to go back to the drawing board.\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nBoth the 2017 Kia Forte sedan and hatchback (Forte5) get styling updates and added technology, with details on the coupe (Forte Koup) to follow, according to Kia. The Forte adds a new trim level, with the sport-oriented S trim slotting between the LX and EX. The Forte5 now is offered in three trim levels as well: LX, SX and EX.\nExterior\nStyling changes give the Forte and Forte5 the same nose; this change represents only a slight tweak for the sedan, but for the hatchback it’s more drastic. The Forte5 ditches its thin version of Kia’s tiger nose grille for a larger version that now feeds directly into the reworked headlight clusters. They feature updated LED detailing and available Dynamic Bending Light technology, which angles the headlights to illuminate corners at night. This new grille, coupled with the removal of the large lower air intake, gives the Forte5 a new, smoother aesthetic that immediately brought the Volkswagen Golf to mind. The taillights have also been redesigned on both models, with LED elements optional.\nInterior\nThe 2017 Forte and Forte5 get upgraded materials, new stitching and softer-touch surfaces (in this case, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shifter on S models). The most exciting changes are on the technology front, with the addition of Apple CarPlay and Android Auto to Kia’s UVO3 multimedia system. This allows for mirroring of selected smartphone apps on the Forte’s 7-inch touch-screen.\nUnder the Hood\nThe new base engine is a 2.0-liter four-cylinder, which replaces the outgoing 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine. Kia did not release power or fuel economy ratings. Two other engine options carry over: a 173-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder for Forte/Forte5 EX models or a 201-hp, turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder in the SX trim, which is exclusive to the hatchback. The SX also adds a new transmission option for 2017: a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic.\nSafety\nKia has also expanded the Forte’s safety technology systems for 2017, continuing an industrywide trend that finds these features making their way down into subcompact and compact cars. A new set of driver aids is now available, including forward collision warning with autonomous emergency braking, lane change warning/assist, lane keeping assist, blind spot detection and rear cross-traffic alert.\n\nKeep an eye out for the refreshed Forte and Forte5 to land in dealerships in the first half of 2016.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Compact cars are often purchased as basic transit, and the 2020 Kia Forte answers that call, but if you splurge for a GT trim you’ll get a bit of inexpensive fun without sacrificing everyday drivability. \n\nVersus the competition: Some compact sedans offer versions with sporty appearance packages that fail to deliver on the fun mechanics, but the Forte GT is not guilty of that. Its performance and cabin upgrades deliver enough action to help the car stand out yet keep costs reasonable. \n\nRelated: Is the 2021 Kia K5 Sedan a Good Car? 6 Pros and 3 Cons\n\nThe Forte competes in the compact sedan class against the likes of the Honda Civic, Hyundai Elantra and Toyota Corolla; see them compared. Each of those cars offers an enthusiast version: the Civic Si, Elantra N Line and Corolla Apex. \n\nKia’s compact sedan was redesigned for 2019 and has seen few changes since. The biggest was 2020’s addition of a sport-oriented GT trim level with a new turbocharged engine and sport suspension. \n\nPeppy and Playful\n\nThe Forte GT is pleasantly peppy. Its upgraded engine — a 201-horsepower, turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder — hustles fairly quickly off the line, and you’ll hear it; the throaty exhaust note comes on strong and is a nice complement to the engine’s added oomph. The four-cylinder is paired with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission that behaves nicely, with well-timed, smooth shifts; a six-speed manual is also available. Other Forte trim levels make do with the standard 147-hp, 2.0-liter four-cylinder and continuously variable automatic transmission. \n\nRegardless of whether you choose the manual or automatic transmission, the GT’s added fun will cost you 3 mpg combined versus the standard engine: The regular Forte 2.0-liter is EPA-rated 31 or 33 mpg combined with the manual and CVT, respectively, while the GT is rated 28 or 30 mpg, respectively. The Forte GT and Elantra N Line are a bit thirstier with a manual than is the Civic Si, which is rated 30 mpg combined, but they offer more efficient automatics, which the Honda lacks. The Corolla Apex tops them all at 32 mpg with a stick shift and 34 mpg with an automatic, but it comes with trade-offs I’ll address below.\n\nThe Forte’s selectable driving modes alter its character quite a bit — for better and for worse. For extra responsiveness, pop it into Sport mode for more aggressive acceleration response and shift timing. Smart mode is designed to save gas, and it dulls acceleration and overall responsiveness.\n\nBesides its unique drivetrain, the GT also gets a sport-tuned suspension. It handles nicely; the firm suspension deftly navigates curves with little lean, and there’s adequate shock absorption over bumps. Its steering has a quickness that further helps deliver a playful, connected-to-the-road feel. \n\nThe Forte GT is fairly well matched in terms of power against the Honda Civic Si and Hyundai Elantra N Line, which shares its engine with the Forte GT. (This comparison is most relevant because their weights are relatively similar.) Toyota’s sport-oriented version of the Corolla disappoints; like the others, the Corolla Apex has the added visual flair of a sport model and some suspension upgrades, but not enough performance goodies to make it much more entertaining to drive than a regular Corolla — which is to say, about as fun as attending a condo board meeting.  \n\nClean, Sporty Cabin\n\nThe Forte’s clean, horizontal dashboard design appeals for its simplicity; elsewhere, the cabin strikes a jazzy tone with sport seats with red contrast stitching, a flat-bottom steering wheel, and pops of glossy black trim on the dash and doors. There’s some hard plastic on the door panels and at knee level, but most surfaces feel decently padded.  \n\nThe sedan’s multimedia system is also well-done. The standard tabletlike 8-inch touchscreen sits high on the dash for good visibility. It’s responsive, and the system’s clear graphics and straightforward menu structure simplify operation. \n\nUnder the screen are several physical climate controls, which are also located within easy reach. Android Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone integration are standard, and a wireless charging tray for compatible phones is optional. Other available features include heated and ventilated front seats and a 320-watt Harman Kardon premium audio system. \n\nThe Forte is mid-pack in both backseat headroom and legroom, but it loses points for child-safety seat accommodations. Front legroom is tight when rear-facing car seats are in place, and installation isn’t easy; the lower Latch anchors are buried in stiff upholstery and require some muscle to access. Other compact sedans have similar legroom issues but easier-to-access Latch anchors.  \n\nAccording to manufacturer specifications, the Forte’s trunk space is slightly larger than its competitors’ at 15.3 cubic feet. In practice, though, it’s disappointing. The trunk is deep, but the opening isn’t very tall, so fitting anything other than small items inside is tough. Its hinges also intrude into the space, potentially crushing cargo. Its cargo net, however, is a nice way to keep smaller items from rolling around (and getting crushed). \n\nSafety and Value\n\nThe 2020 Kia Forte is well-equipped with a lot of standard safety features. All models get a forward collision warning system with automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning, lane keep assist and a driver attention warning system. \n\nUpper trim levels get even more standard safety equipment: a blind spot warning system with lane change assist and rear cross-traffic alert is standard on EX, GT-Line and GT trims. On the GT, adaptive cruise control and a reverse parking distance warning system are optional; they’re unavailable on other trims. \n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2019 Kia Forte Gets More Stylish, More Efficient\nKia Shows Off Coming Forte GT With Turbo Performance at SEMA\nBest 2019 Cars for Teen Drivers\n2019 Kia Forte: Everything You Need to Know\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2021 Kia Forte GT?\nResearch the 2020 Kia Forte\n\nCompetitors offer similar levels of standard and available safety features, but the Forte GT costs a lot less. With the automatic, it starts at $23,655 — lower than automatic versions of the Elantra N Line ($26,195) and Corolla Apex ($26,065). The Civic Si — which comes only with a manual transmission — starts at $26,155 in sedan trim.  All prices include destination charges. \n\nBudget is usually top-of-mind for compact sedan shoppers, but those willing to spend a little extra for fun will get just that with the Kia Forte GT. \n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Kia’s compact Forte gains a four-door hatchback version for 2011. Along with a sedan and a coupe, buyers have three body styles to choose from, which is more than most competitors offer.\n\nIt’s true that cars have gotten a lot better lately, but that doesn’t mean they’re all equal — and the compact-car segment illustrates this perfectly. There’s a clear gap between the impressive redesigned Hyundai Elantra and the Toyota Corolla, a car that’s fallen considerably behind the competition.\n\nThe 2011 Kia Forte is an acceptable, midpack small car, but as the compact class improves, it doesn’t distinguish itself.\n\nI tested two versions of the 2011 Forte: an EX sedan with an as-tested price of $19,040, and an SX hatchback that stickered at $23,685.\n\nClean Lines\nI’ve liked the Forte’s design since its 2010 debut. The car’s crisp, clean lines give it an upscale appearance that belies its low starting price. A number of stylish competitors have entered the mix since then, including redesigned versions of the Ford Focus and Elantra, but the Forte’s lines still hold up well.\n\nThose same good looks carry over to the hatchback, which retains the creased design theme of the sedan and coupe. Finishing touches on our SX trim level included a small liftgate spoiler and 17-inch alloy wheels.\n\nFour-Cylinder Power\nWith the standard 2.0-liter four-cylinder, the Forte EX sedan is as quick as an Elantra, but the engine is noticeably coarser. For 2011, Kia replaced the previous year’s optional four-speed automatic transmission with a six-speed automatic. The four-speed automatic was one of my chief problems with the car when I first reviewed it, but the new six-speed automatic just trades one problem for another.\n\nUnlike the four-speed automatic, which was eager to shift into 4th gear, thereby sapping engine power, the new automatic stays in 1st and 2nd gears longer than a six-speed should need to — and longer than others in the segment do. As a result, you hear the raspy engine more.\n\nThe optional 2.4-liter four-cylinder quickly accelerated the SX hatchback. Like the sedan, the hatchback has a touchy gas pedal, which can sometimes overstate an engine’s power, but kickdowns nonetheless produced a burst of speed. Most compact-car shoppers won’t want for power with this engine, though it’s just as coarse as the 2.0-liter four-cylinder I tested in the sedan.\n\nThe 2.0-liter four-cylinder and the 2.4-liter four-cylinder get an EPA-estimated 26/36 mpg city/highway and 23/32 mpg, respectively, when paired with the automatic. Those are respectable numbers, but they’ve been surpassed by automatic-transmission versions of the 2011 Elantra (29/40 mpg) and the 2012 Honda Civic (28/39 mpg).\n\nRide & Handling\nOn the whole, the Forte offers controlled suspension responses, but bigger bumps can be jolting; the cabin shudders slightly when you hit particularly large ones. This is a firm-riding car, no matter if you’re considering an EX sedan or an SX model like our hatchback, which comes with a sport-tuned suspension. The 2012 Civic does a better job of cushioning blows from broken pavement.\n\nThe steering, meanwhile, doesn’t live up to the expectations set by the Forte’s firm suspension. You expect it to be sporty, but in reality it doesn’t do much to engage you. The Forte goes where you point it, but it doesn’t encourage you to drive it hard. For the enthusiast-oriented compact-car buyer, the Mazda3 remains one of the best choices out there.\n\nThe Inside\nInterior quality has become a battleground in the compact segment, and you can see the results of manufacturers’ efforts in the 2011 Chevrolet Cruze, 2011 Elantra and 2012 Focus. Where a high-grade interior was once a way for an automaker to stand out from the rest of the class — like Volkswagen with its Jetta — it’s now part of the price of entry.\n\nWhile decent, the materials in the Forte are a half-step behind some of the newer competition, like the Elantra and Cruze, but the intuitively placed, logically designed controls help make up for that: It’s easy to get in the Forte and understand all the controls after just a quick look around the dash. That might not seem like much, but the new Focus, for one, has stereo buttons that are hard to use.\n\nOur EX sedan had nice-looking woven seat fabric, while the SX hatchback had an optional Leather Package with heated leather front seats that added $1,000 to the car’s price. The front seats are comfortable.\n\nThe backseat offers more headroom for adult passengers than the Elantra, but the bench seat’s thigh support isn’t as good as you’ll find in a Civic. Taller occupants will encounter limited legroom.\n\nThe hatchback body style increases the Forte’s cargo-carrying capability, but not as much as you might expect. The sedan’s trunk measures 14.7 cubic feet, while the hatchback has 19.4 cubic feet. Still, the hatchback — with its larger cargo opening and taller cargo area — provides a level of versatility versus the sedan that people like.\n\nSafety\nThe 2011 Forte sedan earned 2011 Top Safety Pick status from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, having received Good overall scores in frontal-offset and side-impact crash tests, as well as IIHS’ roof-strength and whiplash-protection tests. The designation also demands that an electronic stability system be offered, and one is standard on the Forte.\n\nIn National Highway Traffic Safety Administration tests, the Forte received four out of five stars in frontal, side-impact and rollover tests. Marring those results is a safety concern stemming from the side-impact crash-test results: During the test, the cabin door panel hit the torso of the dummy in the rear seat, increasing the chance of injury.\n\nAdditional standard safety features include antilock brakes, side-impact airbags for the front seats, side curtain airbags for both rows of seats, and active front head restraints.\n\nFor a full list of safety features, visit the Standard Equipment & Options page.\n\nForte in the Market\nThe Forte is a perfectly acceptable car, but being acceptable is no longer enough in the compact class, which is populated by overachievers. A look at the results of our recent Compact Sedan Shootout tells the story: The Forte placed fourth out of five cars. The Forte has only been around a few years, but it’s already time for Kia to go back to the drawing board.\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Compact cars are often purchased as basic transit, and the 2020 Kia Forte answers that call, but if you splurge for a GT trim you’ll get a bit of inexpensive fun without sacrificing everyday drivability. \n\nVersus the competition: Some compact sedans offer versions with sporty appearance packages that fail to deliver on the fun mechanics, but the Forte GT is not guilty of that. Its performance and cabin upgrades deliver enough action to help the car stand out yet keep costs reasonable. \n\nRelated: Is the 2021 Kia K5 Sedan a Good Car? 6 Pros and 3 Cons\n\nThe Forte competes in the compact sedan class against the likes of the Honda Civic, Hyundai Elantra and Toyota Corolla; see them compared. Each of those cars offers an enthusiast version: the Civic Si, Elantra N Line and Corolla Apex. \n\nKia’s compact sedan was redesigned for 2019 and has seen few changes since. The biggest was 2020’s addition of a sport-oriented GT trim level with a new turbocharged engine and sport suspension. \n\nPeppy and Playful\n\nThe Forte GT is pleasantly peppy. Its upgraded engine — a 201-horsepower, turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder — hustles fairly quickly off the line, and you’ll hear it; the throaty exhaust note comes on strong and is a nice complement to the engine’s added oomph. The four-cylinder is paired with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission that behaves nicely, with well-timed, smooth shifts; a six-speed manual is also available. Other Forte trim levels make do with the standard 147-hp, 2.0-liter four-cylinder and continuously variable automatic transmission. \n\nRegardless of whether you choose the manual or automatic transmission, the GT’s added fun will cost you 3 mpg combined versus the standard engine: The regular Forte 2.0-liter is EPA-rated 31 or 33 mpg combined with the manual and CVT, respectively, while the GT is rated 28 or 30 mpg, respectively. The Forte GT and Elantra N Line are a bit thirstier with a manual than is the Civic Si, which is rated 30 mpg combined, but they offer more efficient automatics, which the Honda lacks. The Corolla Apex tops them all at 32 mpg with a stick shift and 34 mpg with an automatic, but it comes with trade-offs I’ll address below.\n\nThe Forte’s selectable driving modes alter its character quite a bit — for better and for worse. For extra responsiveness, pop it into Sport mode for more aggressive acceleration response and shift timing. Smart mode is designed to save gas, and it dulls acceleration and overall responsiveness.\n\nBesides its unique drivetrain, the GT also gets a sport-tuned suspension. It handles nicely; the firm suspension deftly navigates curves with little lean, and there’s adequate shock absorption over bumps. Its steering has a quickness that further helps deliver a playful, connected-to-the-road feel. \n\nThe Forte GT is fairly well matched in terms of power against the Honda Civic Si and Hyundai Elantra N Line, which shares its engine with the Forte GT. (This comparison is most relevant because their weights are relatively similar.) Toyota’s sport-oriented version of the Corolla disappoints; like the others, the Corolla Apex has the added visual flair of a sport model and some suspension upgrades, but not enough performance goodies to make it much more entertaining to drive than a regular Corolla — which is to say, about as fun as attending a condo board meeting.  \n\nClean, Sporty Cabin\n\nThe Forte’s clean, horizontal dashboard design appeals for its simplicity; elsewhere, the cabin strikes a jazzy tone with sport seats with red contrast stitching, a flat-bottom steering wheel, and pops of glossy black trim on the dash and doors. There’s some hard plastic on the door panels and at knee level, but most surfaces feel decently padded.  \n\nThe sedan’s multimedia system is also well-done. The standard tabletlike 8-inch touchscreen sits high on the dash for good visibility. It’s responsive, and the system’s clear graphics and straightforward menu structure simplify operation. \n\nUnder the screen are several physical climate controls, which are also located within easy reach. Android Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone integration are standard, and a wireless charging tray for compatible phones is optional. Other available features include heated and ventilated front seats and a 320-watt Harman Kardon premium audio system. \n\nThe Forte is mid-pack in both backseat headroom and legroom, but it loses points for child-safety seat accommodations. Front legroom is tight when rear-facing car seats are in place, and installation isn’t easy; the lower Latch anchors are buried in stiff upholstery and require some muscle to access. Other compact sedans have similar legroom issues but easier-to-access Latch anchors.  \n\nAccording to manufacturer specifications, the Forte’s trunk space is slightly larger than its competitors’ at 15.3 cubic feet. In practice, though, it’s disappointing. The trunk is deep, but the opening isn’t very tall, so fitting anything other than small items inside is tough. Its hinges also intrude into the space, potentially crushing cargo. Its cargo net, however, is a nice way to keep smaller items from rolling around (and getting crushed). \n\nSafety and Value\n\nThe 2020 Kia Forte is well-equipped with a lot of standard safety features. All models get a forward collision warning system with automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning, lane keep assist and a driver attention warning system. \n\nUpper trim levels get even more standard safety equipment: a blind spot warning system with lane change assist and rear cross-traffic alert is standard on EX, GT-Line and GT trims. On the GT, adaptive cruise control and a reverse parking distance warning system are optional; they’re unavailable on other trims. \n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2019 Kia Forte Gets More Stylish, More Efficient\nKia Shows Off Coming Forte GT With Turbo Performance at SEMA\nBest 2019 Cars for Teen Drivers\n2019 Kia Forte: Everything You Need to Know\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2021 Kia Forte GT?\nResearch the 2020 Kia Forte\n\nCompetitors offer similar levels of standard and available safety features, but the Forte GT costs a lot less. With the automatic, it starts at $23,655 — lower than automatic versions of the Elantra N Line ($26,195) and Corolla Apex ($26,065). The Civic Si — which comes only with a manual transmission — starts at $26,155 in sedan trim.  All prices include destination charges. \n\nBudget is usually top-of-mind for compact sedan shoppers, but those willing to spend a little extra for fun will get just that with the Kia Forte GT. \n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
