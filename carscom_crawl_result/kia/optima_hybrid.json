      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Kia Optima Hybrid?\n\nThe 2020 Kia Optima Hybrid and Optima Plug-In Hybrid are efficiency-focused five-seat mid-size sedans. They’re powered by a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine and an electric motor that work with a six-speed automatic transmission. The Optima Plug-In Hybrid can drive up to 28 miles on electric power alone, according to EPA estimates, and it’s also eligible for a federal tax credit. Competitors include the Honda Accord Hybrid, Toyota Camry Hybrid and Ford Fusion Energi.     \n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Kia Optima Hybrid?\n\nWireless charging is now standard, and new standard active safety features include forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning, lane-keep assist, adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability, and a driver-drowsiness monitor. \n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Kia Optima Hybrid Are Most Important?\n\nEfficiency. The Optima Plug-In Hybrid’s equivalent of 101 mpg and 28-mile all-electric range is a compelling case for around-town driving. The hybrid Accord and Camry, however, outperform the Optima Hybrid’s 42-mpg combined rating. \n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Kia Optima Hybrid?\n\nBoth the Optima Hybrid and Optima Plug-In Hybrid are considerably more efficient than the gas-only Optima, but they’re also significantly more expensive. The Optima Hybrid is also more expensive than the Accord Hybrid and Camry Hybrid, which both have higher EPA-estimated gas mileage.",

      "expert_review": "Kia’s Optima sedan is such a perfect blend of styling, value and practicality that it won Cars.com’s highest honor as our Best Car of 2011. The hybrid version attempts to take on the likes of Toyota’s Camry Hybrid, Ford’s Fusion Hybrid — a past winner of our award — and its Hyundai counterpart, the Sonata Hybrid. All while the Toyota Prius overshadows them all with a 50 mpg combined rating and comparable interior room.\n\nWhat’s a hybrid sedan to do?\n\nThe 2012 Kia Optima Hybrid doesn’t deliver top mileage, but if you’re shopping for a hybrid sedan, it’s as competent a player as you’ll find on the market.\n\nFull reviews of the gasoline only Optima and Optima Turbo can be found here.\n\nHybrid Powertrain\nThe Optima Hybrid uses both electric and gas power plants to propel the car, either in tandem or independently, while achieving an EPA-estimated 35/40 mpg city/highway, 37 mpg combined.\n\nThe electric motor can power the car on its own — even up to highway speeds when driving conditions and battery level allow. In short, when you hammer on the accelerator the two systems work together, but when cruising at higher speeds the electric (EV) mode kicks in for as long as the battery’s charge allows.\n\nAll this interaction works seamlessly and almost imperceptibly, unless you’re looking at one of the information screens that detail the process. A small color display between the gauges is standard, and the optional navigation system provides more detailed information on a dashboard touch-screen.\n\nSteering and ride comfort were similar to the standard Optima four-cylinder I tested previously, but I thought the hybrid’s overall experience was quieter.\n\nBraking was nice and linear, a trait new hybrids have developed despite using regenerative setups to recapture energy for the battery.\n\nDuring my regular congested commute, I was seeing mileage in the high 30s, which is perfectly acceptable for what the car promises. Because of this system’s design and its ability to cruise at high speeds in EV mode, drivers who spend more time on open roads at highway speeds will benefit most in terms of fuel economy. Hybrids from Ford and Toyota emphasize city efficiency.\n\nWe recently calculated that it would take six years for buyers to recoup their higher investment in the Optima Hybrid through lower fuel costs versus a similarly equipped four-cylinder Optima. While getting those terrific mileage figures will make you feel better on your commute, the higher payments at the end of each month might be a downer.\n\nThe hybrid battery cuts into trunk space, as it does in nearly every hybrid sedan. In the Optima, cargo space goes from 15.4 cubic feet in the regular version to a very small 9.9 cubic feet in the hybrid. The Toyota Camry goes from an identical 15.4 cubic feet in the gas-only model to a very respectable 13.1 cubic feet in the hybrid version. Plus, the Optima Hybrid’s rear seats don’t fold flat.\n\nEquipment\nMy tester was a base model with cloth seats, no navigation and a sticker price of $27,500, which is considerably higher than the base gasoline car’s $19,500. However, there are quite a few standard features in the hybrid that don’t come standard in that model, including a power driver’s seat, cruise control, dual climate control and push-button ignition.\n\nNavigation, leather and other options can be had, but only as part of a single option package called the Hybrid Premium Technology Package. For $5,000, it adds a panoramic moonroof, a navigation system, an eight-speaker stereo, a power passenger seat, leather seats, heated and cooled front seats, 17-inch alloy wheels and high-intensity-discharge headlights.\n\nSafety\nThe Optima Hybrid earned a five-star overall crash test score from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. It also earned a Top Safety Pick designation from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, that agency’s highest honor. Very few cars on the market currently hold both designations.\n\nThe Optima Hybrid comes with a standard array of airbags, including side curtain airbags for the front and rear seats and seat-mounted side airbags for front occupants. You can read about more safety features here.\n\nOptima Hybrid in the Market\nThe concept of a hybrid sedan still doesn’t resonate with me because, with moderate gas prices, it takes a long time to recoup the added cost versus a non-hybrid sedan. However, the Optima Hybrid delivers everything it promises and still retains the handsome looks that won me over when I first saw the non-hybrid version.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nKia has transformed its Optima family sedan from a plain, forgettable entry to one of the most distinctively styled cars in the class. Three trim levels are available — LX, EX and SX — and the five-seat Optima competes against cars like the Ford Fusion, Toyota Camry and Honda Accord. It’s also offered in hybrid form.\n\n(Skip to details on the: Optima Hybrid)\nNew for 2013\nThe base LX trim level gains new sliding front head restraints and loses the choice of a manual transmission, leaving a six-speed automatic for all Optimas. A new SX Limited trim features Nappa leather seats, unique 18-inch chrome wheels, LED daytime running lights and red brake calipers.\n\nThe Optima Hybrid has an upgraded hybrid system with a more powerful electric motor and battery, as well as a stronger hybrid starter generator. There’s slightly more trunk space thanks to a repackaged hybrid battery and two trim levels of the hybrid are now offered.\n\nExterior\nWith its creased sheet metal and low-slung shape, there’s luxury-car sophistication to the Optima’s exterior that you don’t see in a lot of family sedans. The Optima features the new face of Kia that we’ve seen on models like the Sorento and Sportage crossovers. It’s essentially a black mesh grille bordered by angular headlights, and the design enhances the car’s aggressiveness. The placement of the Kia badge above the grille is a little odd-looking, though. Exterior features include:\n\n\nStandard 16-inch steel wheels; available 16-, 17- and 18-inch alloy wheels\nStandard dual chrome exhaust tips \nOptional panoramic sunroof \nOptional high-intensity-discharge headlights \nOptional lip spoiler \nOptional LED daytime running lights\n\nInterior\nThe five-person cabin features front bucket seats and a rear bench seat. The interior has a driver-oriented design, with the entire center control panel angled toward the driver. The optional Premium Package includes an Infinity stereo, Kia’s Uvo hands-free entertainment and communication system, and HD Radio. Interior features include:\n\n\nStandard cloth seats; leather optional\nStandard tilt/telescoping steering wheel \nStandard cooled glove box \nStandard CD stereo with MP3 jack and USB port \nSX trim level has leather upholstery, stitched seams, paddle shifters on the steering wheel, metal pedals and illuminated scuff plates \nOptional heated and cooled front seats \nOptional rear seat heaters \nOptional heated steering wheel \nOptional navigation system with a backup camera\n\nUnder the Hood\nMechanical features include:\n\n\nStandard 200-horsepower, 2.4-liter four-cylinder that teams with a six-speed automatic transmission\nOptional 274-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder with the automatic transmission\n\nSafety\nStandard safety features include:\n\n\nAntilock brakes\nSide-impact airbags for the front seats \nSide curtain airbags\nElectronic stability system\n\nOptima Hybrid\n\nLike its sister vehicle, the Hyundai Sonata Hybrid, the Optima Hybrid gains a re-engineered hybrid drivetrain for 2013. It now combines a more powerful 47-hp electric motor with a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine to produce a combined 199 hp and 235 pounds-feet of torque. The transmission-mounted motor works with a six-speed automatic rather than the electrically variable transmissions many hybrids employ. The electric motor draws power from a more powerful lithium-polymer battery that’s mounted behind the rear seat.\n\nThe Optima Hybrid can cruise on electric-only power under light acceleration and sufficient battery charge. EPA-estimated gas mileage for the base Optima Hybrid LX is 36/40 mpg city/highway while the uplevel EX is rated at 35/39 mpg.\n\nVisual changes amount to a hybrid badge in back, aerodynamic 16- or 17-inch alloy wheels, minor differences to the grille and front lights, and a small rear spoiler. Aerodynamic enhancements include a slight reduction in ride height and underbody covers. All told, the Optima Hybrid looks far more like the regular Optima than the Sonata Hybrid does a Sonata.\n\nStandard features include cloth upholstery, dual-zone automatic air conditioning, a CD stereo with USB connectivity, a backup camera and push-button start.  An Infinity premium stereo, navigation system, heated steering wheel, heated front and rear seats, ventilated front seats and leather upholstery are available.\n\nBack to top",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nJust a year after the conventional Optima received a full redesign, Kia is rolling out both a redesigned 2017 Optima Hybrid and a new 2017 Optima Plug-in Hybrid. The cars feature a revised design inside and out and Kia estimates the hybrid model will be more fuel efficient than its predecessor.\n\nThe Optima plug-in is expected to go on sale at the end of the year. Kia says the model’s battery setup produces about 60 percent more energy than the battery pack in the outgoing Optima Hybrid’s system, allowing it to go an estimated 27 miles in full EV mode.\n\nKia expects the regular hybrid version of the Optima to achieve 10 percent better fuel economy than old model, which got up to 36/40/38 mpg city/highway/combined depending on the trim level. The 2017 Optima Hybrid replaces the previous model’s 2.4-liter engine with a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine as well as makes other changes to the powertrain to achieve the mileage bump.\n\nBoth the plug-in hybrid and conventional Optima Hybrid models look similar to the redesigned-for-2016 Optima sedan, but do bear a few eco-friendly aerodynamic tweaks. The models feature an active grille that closes to improve airflow, a hybrid-specific front air curtain, a beveled rear bumper, a different rear diffuser and an aerodynamic alloy wheel design.\n\nBoth models also get a redesigned, roomier interior as well as hybrid-specific gauges. Also, Kia says the seats have been redesigned to better isolate passengers from vibration; the passenger seat also features height adjustment this year.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nKorean automaker Kia has taken the wraps off of its updated 2014 Optima Hybrid at the 2014 Chicago Auto Show, revealing a barely restyled sedan whose changes are limited to slightly different front and rear bumpers.\n\nKia says that the updates work to improve the car’s aerodynamic efficiency and fuel economy, but the 2014 Optima Hybrid is mechanically unchanged from the 2013 model. The 2014 Optima Hybrid features identical fuel economy of 36/40/38 mpg city/highway/combined for the LX model and 35/39/37 mpg for the uplevel EX trim.\n\nNew 16- and 17-inch wheels are included for the LX and EX, respectively, and they’re complemented by new badges. The interior is largely untouched. It still offers a standard 4.3-inch touch-screen or optional 8-inch navigation touch-screen, optional White Leather Package, UVO multimedia system and more.\nKia did not specify when the new 2014 Optima Hybrid will be on sale.",

      "expert_review": "With sporty styling and a sophisticated interior, the 2011 Kia Optima Hybrid doesn’t look like a run-of-the-mill midsize sedan or even a hybrid for that matter.\n\nThe Optima Hybrid has a youthful, fresh style that’s a lot more fun than its sister sedan, the Hyundai Sonata Hybrid. It’s also an exciting change from the seriously played-out Toyota Prius.\n\nI’m not a hybrid “hypermiler” and I don’t believe in locking gazes with the information screen that charts my mpgs. I drove the Optima Hybrid like I would any other car, and it responded like a real car would. Breaking the stereotype of hybrids being slow and not fun to drive, the Optima Hybrid has slightly more horsepower than the non-hybrid Optima. The turbo four-cylinder Optima has all of them beat, though.\n\nDuring my test drive, I averaged 26 mpg in combined city/highway driving. That falls far short of the Optima Hybrid’s EPA-estimated 35/40 mpg city/highway. Maybe I should have tried hypermiling.\n\nThe Kia Optima Hybrid starts at $26,500, but my test car — equipped with the premium Technology Package — cost $32,420.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThis midsize hybrid features details and styling that set it apart from a boring, traditional sedan. The optional black-glass panoramic moonroof paired with my test car’s Snow White Pearl body paint created a sharp contrast in the Optima Hybrid’s appearance. With added details like a bold black grille and interesting alloy-wheel design, the Optima Hybrid has the ability to make its competitors look downright frumpy.\n\nBesides looking pretty, the Optima Hybrid also can handle family duty easily. There should be no issues entering or exiting for passengers big and small; the sedan’s low step-in height helps the kiddos out, and an average door height keeps groans at bay for taller adults who fear hitting their head on the frame.\n\nA small gripe about the Optima Hybrid’s exterior would be directed toward the awfully low front bumper. I feared scraping it up (or worse, ripping it right off) in parking lots with lots of speed bumps. It was slightly nerve-racking, and I held my breath each time I attempted to clear one. Thankfully, the bumper made it through the week unscathed.\n\nThe Optima Hybrid isn’t exactly swimming in innovative storage solutions, but you can still bring along most anything you’d like for a ride. Just a heads up: The trunk size is small because of the lithium-polymer battery that’s mounted behind the rear seats. There is definitely less space when compared to the non-hybrid model, but rest assured that a stroller and grocery bags still fit in it. In the hybrid, the rear seats don’t fold down, but there is a pass-through to the cabin.\n\nWith a 2.4-liter four-cylinder gas engine and a 30-kilowatt electric motor, the Optima Hybrid’s EPA-estimated 35/40 mpg seemed achievable. I never managed to get close to returning those mpgs. Of course, I never once had to visit the gas station during my busy week with the Optima Hybrid, which is no small feat in my book. When it is time to hit the gas station, the Optima Hybrid uses regular gas.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nINTERIOR\nKia went all out when it came to the Optima Hybrid’s interior. It has a sporty but upscale cabin with dual-zone air conditioning, a tilt/telescoping steering wheel and an eight-way power-adjustable driver’s seat. Heated and cooled front seats and heated rear seats are optional. Cloth seats are standard.\n\nThe Optima Hybrid’s graphics are particularly impressive. I was more than amused while watching green leaves flutter by an animated image of the car on the multimedia screen. In the instrument cluster, flowers “bloomed” the more efficiently I drove. It put those dot-matrix green graphics on another popular hybrid to shame.\n\nFamilies will find the cabin to be roomy enough to comfortably accommodate child-safety seats or teens in the backseat. There are plenty of cupholders and storage spaces in this five-seat sedan, eliminating most backseat bickering.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2011 Optima Hybrid has two sets of lower Latch anchors in the backseat. Unfortunately, access to the anchors is a challenge because the seat cushions are stiff, making it difficult to reach them. There’s plenty of room in the backseat for a rear-facing child-safety seat.\n\nThe 2011 Optima Hybrid hasn’t been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. NHTSA has crash-tested the 2012 Optima Hybrid and it received five out of five stars overall.\n\nThe 2011 Optima Hybrid has standard front-wheel drive, all-disc antilock brakes with electronic brake-force distribution, an electronic stability system with traction control, hill start assist and six airbags, including side curtains for both rows. Optional safety features include auto-leveling headlights and a backup camera.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2011 Kia Optima Hybrid here.",
