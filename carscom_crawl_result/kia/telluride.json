      "expert_review": "What Is the 2022 Kia Telluride?\n\nThe Kia Telluride is a three-row SUV with a broad-shouldered exterior design and a long list of standard equipment, including many active-safety features. There’s room for up to eight people — seven with the optional second-row captain’s chairs — and power comes from a standard 291-horsepower, 3.8-liter V-6 engine that works with an eight-speed automatic transmission. Front- and all-wheel-drive models are available. The Telluride competes with a wide range of three-row SUVs, including the Ford Explorer, Honda Pilot and Toyota Highlander. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2022 Kia Telluride?\n\nThe 2022 Telluride sports the brand’s new badge design and has an updated front grille. New standard features include a 10.25-inch multimedia system with navigation, automatic climate control and Kia’s Highway Driving Assist system.  \n\nWhat Features in the 2022 Kia Telluride Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n5,000-pound maximum towing capacity\n18-inch alloy wheels\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nSatellite radio\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane-keeping assist\nAdaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n20-inch alloy wheels\nHands-free power liftgate\nSecond-row captain’s chairs\nHeated and ventilated front and middle seats\nHeated steering wheel\nHarman Kardon premium stereo\nWireless device charging\n360-degree camera system\nHead-up display\nShould I Buy the 2022 Kia Telluride?\n\nThe 2022 Telluride remains a great value thanks to its lineup of comfort and safety features. Interior quality and roominess are highlights, too. We weren’t that impressed with the Telluride’s audio systems, however, and thought the standard lane-keeping system was too aggressive. Still, the Telluride is definitely worth considering if you’re shopping for a three-row SUV.",

      "expert_review": "Verdict: Big, comfy, classy — and impressively loaded with technology and luxury touches for less money than you’d expect — the new 2020 Kia Telluride is a triumph.\n\nVersus the competition: Few competitors offer the same level of space and amenities for this kind of money. Factor in its polished driving dynamics, and the Telluride immediately becomes a benchmark in the large crossover class.\n\nAfter a few miles sweeping through the towering sandstone canyons south of Gateway, Colo., in quiet, comfortable surroundings, it was obvious Kia has a hit on its hands with the new Telluride. Sometimes you just know, right off the bat.\n\nKia’s first big three-row crossover SUV (let’s all try to forget about the brief appearance of the 2009 Borrego), the Telluride seats seven or eight. It’s set to top the South Korean brand’s range of SUVs despite the company insisting it’s a mid-size model, going up against things like the Jeep Grand Cherokee and Honda Passport. But it’s not conventionally mid-size; the Telluride is on the big end of the mid-size group, much closer in size to the Volkswagen Atlas or Chevrolet Traverse. It has more passenger room even than a Chevrolet Tahoe SUV. If this is mid-size, I can’t imagine what a full-size crossover would look like.\n\nSize-classification quibbles aside, the new Telluride is an exceptionally well-done new family hauler. On the smooth, fast switchbacks of the high plateaus of western Colorado, it was a stellar companion with its well-damped ride, strong acceleration, precise and communicative steering, and beautifully appointed interior.\n\nGood Looks\n\nIt certainly looks the part of a full-size SUV. If comments from passersby and onlookers are anything to go by, the new Telluride is a styling hit from front to back. That big tiger-nose grille is flanked by LED running lights (white on most trims, amber on the sporty SX), and the clean body sides end in a downward swoop to the taillights that’s distinctive and modern. There are definitely elements from other automakers in the styling — Volvo and Range Rover are the two most often mentioned — but that’s not a bad thing. The overall look is attractive, bold and fresh without being offensive. Kia nailed the styling.\n\nA Strong Body\n\nKia also did well with the powertrain. The only one available is a direct-injection Atkinson-cycle 3.8-liter V-6 mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission. It sends power either to the front wheels or, optionally, to all four with a selectable low-speed locking function. Power is rated at 291 horsepower and torque at 262 pounds-feet. This isn’t Kia’s latest or greatest engine, but it’s more than adequate for powering up mountain valleys or providing sufficient passing power on rural two-lane highways. It’s also middle-of-the pack with regard to power and torque numbers. The Chevrolet Traverse offers up a choice of powertrains: either a standard 310-hp V-6 or an optional 257-hp turbocharged four-cylinder. The Honda Pilot has a 280-hp V-6 and the Subaru Ascent a 260-hp turbocharged four-cylinder. Torque is nearly the same among all four competitors.\n\nThe automatic transmission tends to shift quite frequently in order to keep the engine in its optimum power band, but the shifts are buttery smooth and so unobtrusive, you won’t mind them at all. Putting the drive mode selector into Sport seems to make the transmission hold lower gears longer and downshift more readily, providing a little extra spring in the Telluride’s step.\n\nThe Telluride’s ride and handling are also excellent. It exhibits some notable body roll in high-speed sweepers, and the heft of the vehicle means you’re not likely to do much spirited driving, but the more important characteristic of a big family SUV like this is stable, comfortable control; at that, the Telluride excels. An optional self-leveling rear air suspension on the top SX trim I tested maintained a level ride height even when loaded up with people and stuff. Steering feel is firm and transmits quite well to the driver what the wheels and pavement are doing. Ride quality is excellent even with the larger 20-inch wheels on the SX I drove; 18-inch wheels are standard and should make the Telluride’s ride even plusher. Even at 40 mph on a rock-strewn dirt road, nothing upset the Telluride’s chassis or steering — an astonishing feat.\n\nThe Telluride is also rated to tow a 5,000-pound trailer, which represents a decent-size family camper. The payload rating is roughly 1,300-1,500 pounds depending on trim level, so a family of four could bring along luggage and that camper with no problem. The tow rating matches the V-6 Chevy Traverse and the Subaru Ascent, and it beats the Honda Pilot’s maximum 3,500-pound rating.\n\nFuel economy is decent thanks to the Telluride’s fuel-sipping Atkinson-cycle V-6 engine. It’s rated 20/26/23 mpg city/highway/combined with front-wheel drive and 19/24/21 mpg with AWD. My drive wasn’t long enough to get a reliable fuel economy read, so that will have to wait for a later test. By comparison, the Chevy Traverse and its nine-speed transmission is rated 18/27/21 mpg (FWD) and 17/25/20 mpg (AWD) with the V-6, while the four-cylinder turbo (available only on the FWD RS) is rated 20/26/22 mpg — not any better than the Kia’s big V-6. The Honda has only one engine but two possible transmissions: With the standard six-speed, the Pilot is rated 19/27/22 mpg with FWD, 18/26/21 mpg with AWD; with the available nine-speed, the numbers rise just a tick to 20/27/23 mpg with FWD, 19/26/22 mpg with AWD. The Subaru comes only with AWD, as do most Subies, but fuel economy depends on trim level: base and Premium trims are rated 21/27/23 mpg, while Limited and Touring models are rated 20/26/22 mpg.\n\nComfortable, Spacious and Well-Appointed\n\nInside, the Telluride is spacious, quiet and comfortable. The front seats have excellent thigh support, plenty of width and just enough bolstering to keep you in place without being too flat or padded. Materials quality is outstanding throughout, and the top-level SX trim is impressive in that none of the metal or wood trim is real, but damned if you won’t think it is. Genuine Nappa leather covers those comfortable seats, of which there are seven or eight depending on which seating option you choose. It’s a nicer environment than Chevy has concocted for the High Country trim of the Traverse, and it feels better than the Subaru’s top trim, but the Honda Pilot Elite edges it out in some tactile surface quality.\n\nThe second-row captain’s chairs fold forward with the touch of a button for easier access to the sizable third row, which Kia says can hold three people (it’s provided seat belts for that many). Suffice it to say these will be tiny people and that while the third row is acceptably comfortable for two full-sized adults, three is not reasonable. That’s really no different from any competitor; the Traverse is technically rated the biggest for maximum interior volume, but no large crossover can comfortably accommodate three in the third row. Legroom can be negotiated between second- and third-row passengers thanks to sliding second-row seats, allowing adequate space for everyone. All rows also get to enjoy USB charging ports to keep everyone’s personal electronics topped off.\n\nLots of Space\n\nThe Telluride is one of the biggest crossover SUVs on the market, and that shows up in space comparisons. Cargo room behind the third row of seats is 21 cubic feet, second only to the massive Chevy Traverse, which has 23 cubic feet. Fold the third row down and you increase space to 46 cubic feet, about on par with the Pilot (46.8 cubic feet) and Ascent (47.5 cubic feet) but falling short of the Traverse (57.8 cubic feet). Fold all rows flat and the Telluride checks in at 87 cubic feet, about matching the Ascent’s 86.5 cubic feet, besting the Pilot’s 83.9 cubic feet and getting soundly trounced by the cavernous Traverse’s 98.2 cubic feet of cargo room. Point being, you’re unlikely to run out of room for people or stuff in the Telluride.\n\nLoaded With Tech\n\nUp front, you won’t need your personal electronics; there are enough goodies included in Kia’s latest multimedia system to keep you entertained. The loaded Telluride is chock-full of useful technology, but unlike the mechanically identical Hyundai Palisade coming later in 2019, the Telluride doesn’t get a fully digital instrument panel. The gauges behind the steering wheel are analog, though there’s a display between them that ties into cameras in the side mirrors to show the view from Kia’s blind spot monitor, which is just like Honda’s near-defunct LaneWatch. The Prestige Package on my test vehicle included the head-up display, but I didn’t realize this until nearly 20 minutes into my drive because it disappears completely if you’re wearing polarized sunglasses, as I was. Big fail on that, Kia.\n\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto are standard, and there are a couple of other neat touches in the multimedia system that are geared toward family life. First is the Driver Talk feature: Press a button on the 10.25-inch touchscreen (standard on the EX and SX; an 8-inch screen is standard on the LX and S) and the music mutes while activating a microphone to project the driver’s voice to speakers in the back of the bus. There’s also Quiet Mode, which mutes all but the front speakers and turns those ones down in the event the kids are asleep in the back. If you like it loud, a Harman Kardon 10-speaker premium audio system is standard on the SX, but I found it unimpressive and muddled at any volume. The Honda Pilot has a couple of features similar to these Kia niceties, but the Chevy and Subaru are a bit more conventional in their approach.\n\nWhat does the Telluride not have that its competitors do? There’s no automatic parking function, either parallel or perpendicular (no Kia features this ability), and there’s no rear entertainment system — an especially curious omission in a vehicle that aspires to be a popular family wagon. There are no rear screens, no seatback DVD system, nothing that drops from the ceiling, though the USB ports back there will support the tablet approach many parents now prefer. There’s also no power third row: the seatbacks must be raised and lowered manually. (For the record, Hyundai’s upcoming Palisade does have an optional power third row.)\n\nAll the Safety Equipment You Want\n\nA high level of safety equipment has been included standard on all Telluride trim levels, including automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go, lane keep assist, automatic lane-centering, blind spot detection with braking and steering intervention, rear cross-traffic alert and intervention, and safe exit assistance for the rear seats. The latter function uses the SUV’s rear-facing radar to detect oncoming traffic and can prevent a rear door from opening if an approaching vehicle or bicycle is detected. I found the addition of most of these features welcome, but the lane-centering function is intrusive and the lane keep assist is, well, oversensitive. After the first few miles of feeling the wheel constantly shifting in my hands, I switched it off and never looked back.\n\nThe 2020 Telluride has not yet been crash-tested by either the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, but results will likely appear here soon.\n\nThe fact that Kia includes all that safety equipment as standard when some automakers charge big bucks for it is praiseworthy. For instance, forward collision warning isn’t even offered on the Traverse unless you get the High Country trim, which starts at $54,395 including destination. However, the Honda Pilot, Subaru Ascent, Toyota Highlander and Nissan Pathfinder all offer it standard on their base models.\n\nPriced to Move\n\nThe starting price for the Telluride is a reasonable $32,735 with destination fee. That puts it within a few hundred dollars of competitors like the Traverse, Pilot and Ascent. Loading one up to the max gets you an exceptionally well-done large family crossover packed to the gills with technology, safety equipment, convenience items and a big dose of rugged style, topping out around $48,000. A comparable Chevrolet Traverse rings in at more than $54,000, while a new 2020 Explorer Limited starts at nearly 50 grand and goes up from there. It does compare favorably to the Ascent, which tops out at about $46,000, but comes in a bit under the Pilot, which can top $50,000, as well. Compare the Telluride with three of its competitors here.\n\nWith its combination of comfort, cargo space, technology, safety, performance and value, the new 2020 Kia Telluride is going to be one tough competitor.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2021 Kia Telluride?\n\nThe Telluride is a three-row SUV with a boxy exterior design and a long list of standard equipment, including many active-safety features. There’s room for up to eight people — seven with the optional second-row captain’s chairs —  and power comes from a standard 291-horsepower, 3.8-liter V-6 engine that works with an eight-speed automatic transmission. Front- and all-wheel-drive models are available, and the Telluride competes with the Ford Explorer, Honda Pilot and Toyota Highlander. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2021 Kia Telluride?\n\nKey-fob-based remote start is now standard, and a newly available Nightfall Edition appearance package adds black accents. \n\nWhat Features in the 2021 Kia Telluride Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n5,000-pound maximum towing capacity\n18-inch alloy wheels\n8-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nSatellite radio\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane keep assist\nAdaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n20-inch alloy wheels\nHands-free power liftgate\nSelf-leveling rear suspension\nSecond-row captain’s chairs\nLeather-trimmed seats\nHeated and ventilated front and middle seats\nHeated steering wheel\n10.25-inch touchscreen navigation system\nHarman Kardon premium stereo\nWireless device charging\n360-degree camera system\nHead-up display\nShould I Buy the 2021 Kia Telluride?\n\nBig on value and even bigger on interior space and standard features, the Telluride is definitely worth considering if you’re shopping for a three-row SUV. A high-quality interior and comfortable ride are highlights, and in our recent three-row SUV comparison test, the Telluride earned a strong second-place finish. We weren’t that impressed with the Telluride’s audio systems, however, and thought the standard lane-keeping system was too aggressive.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Kia Telluride?\n\nThe Kia Telluride is a three-row SUV with seating for eight people in its standard form and seven when fitted with optional second-row captain’s chairs. Powering the Telluride is a 291-horsepower, 3.8-liter V-6 engine that’s coupled to an eight-speed automatic transmission with a choice of front- or all-wheel drive. The Telluride’s direct competitors include the Chevrolet Traverse, Ford Explorer, Honda Pilot, Mazda CX-90 and Volkswagen Atlas.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Kia Telluride?\n\nThe Telluride sees minor alterations to its standard and available equipment for 2025. Second-row side impact airbags and Kia’s Highway Driving Assist 1.5 system are now standard across all trims. Both the X-Line and X-Pro variants now include a standard 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, gloss-black exterior accents and Terracotta-colored leather upholstery. The X-Pro also rides 0.4 inch higher for 2025, and its towing capacity grows to 5,500 pounds, a 500-pound increase.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Kia Telluride Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n12.3-inch touchscreen\nWired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nNavigation\nFive USB ports\nSatellite radio\nSynthetic leather seating surfaces\nDual-zone climate control\n18-inch alloy wheels\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nRear seat reminder\nHighway Driving Assist\nLane departure steering assist\nAdaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n20-inch alloy wheels\nHands-free power liftgate\nSecond-row captain’s chairs\nHeated and ventilated front and middle seats\nHeated steering wheel\nHarman Kardon premium stereo\nWireless device charging\nDigital rearview mirror\n360-degree camera system\nHead-up instrument display\n12.3-inch digital instrument panel\nShould I Buy the 2025 Kia Telluride?\n\nThe Kia Telluride remains hugely popular due to its combination of space, power and upscale design; in many ways, it looks and feels like a mid-size SUV with a luxury-brand badge. Granted, the price of the Telluride has steadily crept upward since it arrived for the 2020 model year, and while acceleration is respectably brisk, fuel economy is mediocre at best. But an upscale cabin and extremely user-friendly infotainment system give the Telluride a premium feel, and cargo space is abundant even with the third row occupied. With so many standard and available features, this SUV punches far above its weight — making many luxury SUVs feel wildly overpriced by comparison.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Kia Telluride?\n\nThe Kia Telluride is a three-row SUV with seating for eight people in its standard form and seven when fitted with optional second-row captain’s chairs. Powering the Telluride is a 291-horsepower, 3.8-liter V-6 engine coupled to an eight-speed automatic transmission, with a choice of front- or all-wheel drive. The Telluride’s direct competitors include the Chevrolet Traverse, Ford Explorer, Honda Pilot, Mazda CX-90 and Volkswagen Atlas.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Kia Telluride?\n\nAfter a mild refresh for the 2023 model year, the Kia Telluride receives no notable changes for 2024.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Kia Telluride Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n12.3-inch touchscreen\nWired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nNavigation\nFive USB ports\nSatellite radio\nSynthetic leather seating surfaces\nDual-zone climate control\n18-inch alloy wheels\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic warning\nRear-seat reminder\nHighway Driving Assist\nLane departure steering assist\nAdaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n20-inch alloy wheels\nHands-free power liftgate\nSecond-row captain’s chairs\nHeated and ventilated front and middle seats\nHeated steering wheel\nHarman Kardon premium stereo\nWireless device charging\nDigital rearview mirror\n360-degree camera system\nHead-up instrument display\nShould I Buy the 2024 Kia Telluride?\n\nThe Kia Telluride remains hugely popular due to its combination of space, power, and upscale design; in many ways it looks and feels like a mid-size SUV with a luxury-brand badge. Acceleration is respectably brisk, but fuel economy is mediocre at best. An upscale cabin and extremely user-friendly infotainment system give the Telluride a premium feel, and cargo space is abundant even with the third row occupied. Granted, the price of the Telluride has steadily crept upward since it arrived for the 2020 model year, but with so many standard and available features, the Telluride punches far above its weight. It makes many luxury SUVs seem wildly overpriced by comparison.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Very minor changes to the 2023 Kia Telluride make an already stellar family SUV even better.\n\nVersus the competition: Few mid-size three-row SUVs can match the Telluride’s combination of style, capability, comfort, technology and ease of use for the money.\n\nWhen Kia debuted the 2020 Telluride, it was something of a revelation: a truck-styled three-row SUV that offered big space, big value, big comfort and a healthy dose of flair. It won a bunch of major industry awards and was so popular that customers were having trouble finding any to buy, with Tellurides being sold before they even made it off the transport trucks.\n\nRelated: Refreshed 2023 Kia Telluride Priced From $37,025\n\nKia hit upon a formula for success with the Telluride, and for the 2023 model year, it’s given the SUV a slight freshening. The company has also increased production capacity at its plant in Georgia. To see what the 2023 model is like, I traveled to San Antonio at Kia’s invitation to drive it. (Per our ethics policy, Cars.com pays for its own airfare and lodging at such automaker-sponsored events.)\n\nSpot the Differences?\n\nGo Google an image of the 2022 Kia Telluride, compare it with the 2023 model above and see if you can spot the differences. They’re subtle to the point of near invisibility, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing; the Telluride’s styling is only 3 years old, and it still looks fresh despite its traditional profile. For 2023, there are new headlights (LEDs are now standard), a new grille, new lower door sills, taillights with clear lenses, some new wheel designs … and that’s it. The blacked-out Nightfall Edition is gone, but two new off-road-styled variants replace it: X-Line and X-Pro.\n\nThese trims offer an off-road-ready appearance, if not true off-road capability, and get trim-specific grilles, a different suspension with taller shocks and springs, blacked-out headlights and taillights, body-colored door handles and roof rails. The X models sit higher, too, with 8.4 inches of ground clearance, or just under half an inch more than the 2022 Telluride. The bigger differences come with the wheels and tires: The X-Line gets 20-inch gloss-black wheels, while the X-Pro gets more off-road-suitable Continental all-terrain tires on 18-inch wheels. Slightly different bumper designs allow for slightly better approach and departure angles than other Telluride trims, but to call this an off-road SUV would be a huge stretch of the imagination — there’s no dedicated “off-road” drive mode, no underbody skid plate protection and no special four-wheel-drive algorithms beyond a “lock” button for the all-wheel-drive system that makes the clutches act more aggressively when driving on slippery or loose surfaces.\n\nSame On-Road Goodness\n\nI tested SX-Prestige X-Pro and X-Line models in San Antonio, and they drove pretty much the same as the prior Telluride. The sole powertrain is a carryover 3.8-liter V-6 making 291 horsepower and 262 pounds-feet of torque that teams with a smooth-shifting eight-speed automatic transmission. Front- and all-wheel-drive variants are available.\n\nLike its predecessor, the 2023 Telluride feels heavy but solid; acceleration is tepid and unhurried unless you mash the accelerator pedal. When you do that, power from the big V-6 arrives in a smooth rush accompanied by a pleasing exhaust burble. The Telluride also can tow up to 5,500 pounds when properly equipped.\n\nThe Telluride’s ride and handling are just as good as we remember, with an excellent balance of on-road smoothness with either the 18- or 20-inch wheels and tires. There’s a level of road noise, however, that can’t entirely be attributed to San Antonio’s totally awful pressed-gravel road surfaces; both the 18-inch all-terrain tires and 20-inch on-road rubber generate a significant level of noise in the cabin. The all-terrain tires also introduce a bit of wandering behavior on the highway.\n\nOverall, though, the Telluride’s steering is fantastic, with a nicely weighted heft to it and decent feedback that is often lacking in this class. The Telluride will also hustle along a twisty back road at decent speed, the brakes providing firm and reliable stopping power when needed. There’s no disguising the Telluride’s hefty proportions and mass, however, and nothing about the SUV invites you to do any spirited driving. Still, it delivers a confident driving experience more akin to a Ford Explorer than the numbness of a Toyota Highlander.\n\nIt Goes Off-Road … Barely\n\nLook, if you’re really intent on going off-road in your Telluride … just don’t. It will last longer. Kia provided an off-road loop for the SX-Prestige X-Pro that included some deep gullies and banked mounds, but all-terrain tires and slightly higher ground clearance does not make an off-road SUV. Kia maintains that the X-Pro is better at getting city-dwelling families to campsites on fire trails that may have the odd washout, but without any underbody protection, low-range 4WD, greater wheel travel or even an off-road drive mode, the big Telluride isn’t much better at going through the dirt than any other crossover. It’ll do it, but this is really more of a family station wagon or minivan replacement than a true rock climber. Stick to gravel roads and stay off two-tracks, and the Telluride will serve you just fine.\n\nThe New Corporate Cabin\n\nThe Telluride now has a 12.3-inch touchscreen atop the dash, and another 12.3-inch screen for the instrument panel is optional. Even with the large screens, Kia hasn’t put all of the Telluride’s ancillary controls, such as those for the climate system, in the touchscreen itself. This means you have a big, clear and easy-to-use screen atop the dash. You also have clear and easy-to-use climate control buttons and knobs, as well as a strip of menu buttons to switch between functions like media, map, etc.\n\nAs before, the driving position and interior packaging of the Telluride are damn near perfect. The beltline and dashboard are low, allowing a commanding view out of the cabin, and the seats are comfortable and spacious.\n\nKia calls this a mid-size crossover, but the thing is huge inside; there’s plenty of room in the first two rows, and even the third row can accommodate full-sized adults without much difficulty. Headroom is abundant even with the optional panoramic moonroof. Seat adjustability is excellent in all positions, and a new mild massage “lumbar stabilization” function on top trims helps alleviate back fatigue in front-seat occupants. Second-row captain’s chairs can now be heated and ventilated, too.\n\nOther interior updates include a new available rearview camera mirror, a new available 360-degree camera system with 3D view, and available Nappa leather on top trims. Previously, the top-of-the-line Tellurides were premium products at normal prices, and the 2023 model’s new technology and equipment just serves to keep that astonishing value proposition going strong.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2023 Kia Telluride Piles On New Off-Road Trims, Safety Tech\nUp Close With the 2023 Kia Telluride\n2023 Kia Sportage Hybrid Review: Great (With a Catch)\nResearch SUVs\nShop for a 2023 Kia Telluride\nPriced to Win Friends\n\nIt’s kind of amazing that the base FWD Telluride LX is priced just a tick over $37,000 (all prices include $1,335 destination). It’s even more astonishing that the top Telluride SX-Prestige X-Pro comes in at $54,120, as it still provides amazing value at that price. A top SX-Prestige X-Line version is $1,000 less at $53,120, and that’s the one I’d get. It has Kia’s excellent multimedia system on a large and easy-to-use touchscreen, a comfortable leather interior, and a confident and refined driving experience without the silly off-road pretense of the X-Pro.\n\nThe original Telluride won awards for its combination of the above characteristics, and the latest version just improves on the original vision. The Telluride is still a top pick in the crowded three-row SUV class, and I have no doubt that the company will be able to use all the extra production capacity at its manufacturing plant.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
