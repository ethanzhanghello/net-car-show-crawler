      "expert_review": "The 2024 Chicago Auto Show hosted the debut of refreshed Kias both big and small, with retouched designs, tech and powertrains for the automaker’s Carnival minivan and K5 sedan. Updates to the K5 for the 2025 model year are particularly subtle, but some quality in-person time spent with the mid-sizer on the floor of the 2024 Chicago Auto Show gave us a chance to poke around ahead of its production start.\n\nRelated: More 2024 Chicago Auto Show Coverage\n\nStill a Handsome Design\n\nThe clearest visual clues you’re facing down the refreshed 2025 K5 are found up front, specifically in a new set of headlights and indicators mostly lifted from the South Korean-market car that debuted in the fall. In person, the zig-zag LED indicator design is striking; we’ll be adored by Kia and reviled by Lamborghini for the comparison, but the jagged, forked motif wouldn’t look out of place on Sant’Agata’s finest mid-engine weapon.\n\nThe K5 was already both popular and handsome prior to the rhinoplasty, so other visual tweaks simply accentuate the prior design. Sharper protrusions on the lower front bumper are straight out of the Kia EV6 GT’s playbook, as are the new squared-off portions of the taillights on the deck lid. The new wheel options are similarly aggressive, with two new 18-inch wheels for the EX and sportyish GT-Line.\n\nNaturally, our inner enthusiast gravitates toward the line-topping GT trim, looking surprisingly mean dripped out in new 19-inchers with contrasting acid-green calipers. Kia says this most capable K5 rides on a specific suspension tune, but we’ll need to see it next to a non-GT K5 to determine if there’s any drop in ride height. Either way, it looks sharp.\n\nFresh Interior Tech\n\nSpeaking of sharp, the cabin is moderately upgraded over the prior car. Fresh tech is the biggest talking point, with a newly optional 12-inch digital gauge cluster complementing the novel 12.3-inch infotainment touchscreen — now standard — that blends both screens into one partly divided, curved unit. It’s quite the segment showpiece in person, and while it can’t match some of the super-screens found in Cadillacs and Mercedes, that was never the intention. The new digital strip of controls toward the bottom of the center stack plays well with this new merged display, managing functions for both climate controls and audio; it brings the K5 in line with the brand’s newest product language.\n\nWe spent all of our time with the meaty GT and were fans of the (pleasantly) toxic-looking acid-green stitching and trim accents peppered through the top trim’s cabin. We also took inventory of the updated trim-specific accoutrement; we noted — but did not hear — the Bose sound system, futzed with the GT’s 10-way power-adjustable seat, warmed our hands with the trim-standard heated steering wheel, and activated the power-folding exterior mirrors just to make sure they worked.\n\nNew Base Powertrain\n\nAlong with the bespoke suspension tune and new wheels, the GT still rushes about with the familiar turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine, returning 290 horsepower and a custard-thick 311 pounds-feet through an eight-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission and all-wheel drive. Same-same, but lower trims have ditched the standard turbo 1.6-liter four-cylinder for a free-breathing, turboless 2.5-liter four-cylinder. Power is up 11 hp to 191 hp, but no boost means torque drops 14 pounds-feet to a still “fine” 181 pounds-feet.\n\nBecause Kia kept the keys and the Chicago Auto Show frowns on joyriding display cars, we didn’t get to experience any of the GT’s delicious pounds-footage, so you’ll have to wait for our first drive. In the meantime, we suggest keeping an eye on your rearview mirror while stuck in traffic for sharp front indicators — it’s either a Lambo or the 2025 Kia K5.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2025 Kia K5 Gets More Power, More Tech, Sharp New Looks\nKia Lets the OK Times Roll, Releases Pricing on 2024 K5\nMid-Size Sedans Struggle to Protect Rear-Seat Occupants in Revised Crash Test\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2021 Kia K5?\nFind Your Next Car\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Kia K5?\n\nThe Kia K5 is a mid-size sedan with a swept-back shape that helps it stand out among rivals like the Toyota Camry, Honda Accord and Nissan Altima. Most versions of the K5 are motivated by a turbo 1.6-liter four-cylinder that sends 180 horsepower to the front wheels in most trims or to all four when all-wheel drive is added to the GT-Line. Strangely, the 290-hp, turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder available in the top-of-the-line K5 GT can only be had with front-wheel drive.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Kia K5?\n\nThe entry-level LX trim has been discontinued, and the LXS trim can no longer have AWD. The GT-Line model gets a Panoramic Roof Package that includes LED cabin lighting. The GT-Line AWD gets a standard heated steering wheel, and all but the LXS get acoustic front-door glass.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Kia K5 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n8-inch touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nTwo USB ports\nDual-zone climate control\nLane departure warning\nForward collision warning\nDriver drowsiness monitor\nPedestrian detection\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nPanoramic moonroof\n25-inch touchscreen\nRemote start\nNavigation\nSatellite radio\nBlind spot monitoring\nSport-tuned suspension (GT)\nSurround-view parking camera\nBose stereo\nHeated and cooled front seats\nWireless device charging\nAWD (GT-Line only)\nShould I Buy the 2023 Kia K5?\n\nThe Kia K5 makes a strong case for itself thanks to its sleek styling and value-conscious content. Granted, unless you spring for the K5 GT and its 290-hp powertrain, this Kia’s performance is more mild than wild. Optional AWD may persuade shoppers otherwise drawn to SUVs, and the K5’s nicely balanced ride makes it a comfy traveling companion. Rear headroom could be a problem, however, and we still can’t understand why the optional 10.25-inch infotainment screen isn’t compatible with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Kia K5?\n\nThe Kia K5 is a mid-size sedan with a stylish exterior and a turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder under its hood. This engine delivers 180 horsepower to the front wheels in most trims or to all four when all-wheel drive is added to the GT-Line trim. While it looks racy, the K5’s performance is more in line with competitors including the Honda Accord, Hyundai Sonata, and Toyota Camry. If you want something wilder, the GT trim comes with a 290-hp, turbo 2.5-liter four-cylinder that gives the K5 some speed to back up its bold styling.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Kia K5?\n\nThe only notable change to the 2024 K5 is that heated front seats are now standard on FWD versions of the GT-Line.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Kia K5 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\n8-inch touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nTwo USB ports\nDual-zone climate control\nLane departure warning\nForward collision warning\nDriver-drowsiness monitor\nPedestrian detection\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nPanoramic sunroof \n10.25-inch touchscreen\nRemote start\nNavigation\nSatellite radio\nBlind spot warning\nSport-tuned suspension (GT)\n360-degree camera system\nBose stereo\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nWireless device charging\nAWD (GT-Line)\nShould I Buy the 2024 Kia K5?\n\nThe K5 has sporty looks and tons of standard features. Granted, its performance isn’t as invigorating as its styling (unless you pony up for the frisky GT trim). Making AWD available is a plus point for sedan shoppers in areas where roads can get slick with rain or snow, but we wish backseat headroom wasn’t so stingy for adults, and that the optional 10.25-inch infotainment system included wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto (it doesn’t even though the base 8-inch touchscreen does). All things considered, the K5 is a competent family car with stand-out-from-the-crowd style and a great warranty attached to it.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: A stylish redesign that should have left its new name and optional touchscreen system on the drawing board.\n\nVersus the competition: A more attractive take than Hyundai’s frowny new Sonata, the K5 is plenty competitive, but the disparity between its available touchscreen systems is an opportunity missed, and while its powertrain lag might boost gas mileage, it would be wiser to outperform competitors equipped with continuously variable automatic transmissions.\n\nWhen I reviewed the 2020 Sonata, I was impressed Hyundai hadn’t phoned in its redesign at a time when interest in sedans is waning. Many automakers have ceded the mid-size sedan class to stalwarts like the Honda Accord, Nissan Altima and Toyota Camry — either completely, by bailing out, or passively, by starving their models of resources. Now you can add another brand, though a related one, that hasn’t thrown in the towel: Kia. With a model the company pitches as so different it deserved a new name, the K5 (formerly the Optima) has a lot in common with the new Sonata (which is also quite different yet retains its name). The two cars share a platform, though the Sonata is built in Montgomery, Ala., and the K5 comes together in West Point, Ga.\n\nRelated: 2021 Kia K5: Mr. Optima, I Presume\n\nThe K5 has a slightly longer wheelbase than the Sonata (112.2 versus 111.8 inches), and its track is wider, by more than an inch when you compare some trim levels. Currently it comes only with the 180-horsepower, turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine that powers the Sonata SEL Plus and Limited trim levels. Though the eight-speed automatic transmission is the same, the K5 has a traditional gear selector lever rather than the Sonata’s push-button controls.\n\nI tested two trim levels: the GT-Line (the red sample in the photos) and an EX (the blue). To understand the K5 lineup, you need to know what’s coming later this year: the K5 GT 2.5T. As the name suggests, it will have a turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine that will generate 290 hp — presumably comparable to the coming 2021 Hyundai Sonata N-Line.\n\nWait, a GT-Line Isn’t a GT 2.5T?\n\nUnfortunately, Hyundai’s use of “N-Line” only confuses things further, as Kia is using a different approach with the word “line.” The K5 GT-Line I tested is the middle of five trim levels, and it’s no GT 2.5T. Where Hyundai uses “N-Line” to designate its performance models, Kia’s use of “line” takes a page from German brands like Audi and BMW, who create sportier-looking trim levels that borrow from their top performance versions but aren’t necessarily more robust. For example, an Audi A5 with the S Line package might look like an Audi S5, but only the latter has the more powerful engine. Ditto for the Kia K5 GT-Line, which definitely looks sportier and has a flat-bottom steering wheel, but is otherwise mechanically identical to the other non-GT 2.5T trim levels. The performance goods will come later this year with the GT 2.5T, currently scheduled for November.\n\nNote that the base, LX, trim is typically stripped down to achieve its starting price of $24,455. It lacks push-button start, an engine immobilizer, a folding backseat and power rear child safety locks, and it’s not eligible for satellite radio. It includes Kia’s basic forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, but it doesn’t have rear cross-traffic alert with automatic braking or a blind spot collision avoidance system, both of which are standard on all other K5 trims. The LXS adds more standard features and eligibility for some options the LX can’t have, such as heated seats. Then come the GT-Line and EX I tested, of which the EX represents the greater increase in actual content — apart from the styling differences.\n\n2021 Kia K5 GT-Line | Cars.com photo by Joe Wiesenfelder\n\nI tested front-wheel-drive versions, but later this year Kia will begin to offer all-wheel drive on the LXS and GT-Line. Asked why AWD wouldn’t be offered on the EX, Kia representatives said it’s not out of the question, but for now the company is following the research, which said the middle of the lineup is where most demand will be.\n\nHesitate, Accelerate\n\nI had mixed impressions about the powertrain. The engine is fine in some respects; it’s impressive how much power and torque — 195 pounds-feet at 1,500 rpm — a tiny four-cylinder can provide, but with this small displacement and a turbo, some lag is inevitable no matter what technological steps are taken. I started noticing a consistent delay every time I stepped on the accelerator while already in motion, regardless of speed. Truly. Every. Single. Time. Ultimately I determined by watching the tachometer that the transmission would downshift before the car would accelerate, explaining the lag — something I’ve experienced in a couple other cars with small engines and high gear counts over the years. The gear ratios are close enough and the transmission refined enough that you don’t really notice the shift, but you can’t miss the time it takes before the car accelerates.\n\n2021 Kia K5 GT-Line | Cars.com photo by Joe Wiesenfelder\n\nJust to check myself, I switched to manual shifting using the gear selector (steering-wheel paddles come only on the GT 2.5T), and sure enough the delay vanished, but I had to choose a lower gear to accelerate appreciably. What’s all this about? Typically it’s the way the drivetrain is tuned for efficiency: The transmission picks the highest possible gear, and even a modest request for acceleration requires a downshift. The K5 has a drive mode selector knob on the console, and I found the Sport and Smart settings both cut back on the delay somewhat by holding onto lower gears in some cases, but of course these modes compromise gas mileage.\n\nReality check: Though these were both technically preproduction cars, they were pretty late preproduction and nicely buttoned up. Over the decades when we’ve raised concerns like these about transmission behavior, automakers (not necessarily Kia) have typically relied on the preproduction or “learning transmission” defense, which states, conveniently, that modern transmissions adapt to the driving styles of their operators, so it might just take a while for it to adapt (perhaps longer than we’re testing the car?). For the record, zero percent of those other-car transmission complaints magically vanished in later testing, with the exception of one Saturn that was recalled for reprogramming.\n\nIs this delay in the K5 something typical drivers will really notice? I suspect some will and some won’t. The best thing you can do is pay attention to it if you test-drive the K5. Also, know that the K5 GT 2.5T will have a different transmission altogether — an eight-speed dual-clutch versus the current conventional automatic with a torque converter.\n\n2021 Kia K5 GT-Line | Cars.com photo by Joe Wiesenfelder\n\nIf the delay I experienced is due to tuning, what does it get you? Tested in the normal drivetrain mode, the EPA-estimated fuel efficiency is 27/37/31 mpg city/highway/combined for most 1.6-liter front-drive trim levels; it’s higher, 29/38/32 mpg, for the LX. (The EPA hasn’t rated all-wheel-drive and GT 2.5T versions yet, but Kia predicts AWD will result in 26/34/29 mpg.)\n\nFor comparison, the most efficient 2021 Hyundai Sonata (a lower trim level with a different engine) gets 32 mpg combined, while higher trims powered by the 1.6-liter turbo are rated 30 mpg combined. The 2021 Accord ranges from 26 to 33 mpg combined, the 2020 Nissan Altima ranges from 29 to 32 mpg combined, and the front-drive 2020 Toyota Camry four-cylinder spans 31 to 34 mpg combined.\n\nThe K5 faces tough competition on gas mileage, but some of its rivals have continuously variable automatic transmissions, which aren’t anyone’s favorite for drivability. It might have been smarter for Kia to take the hit on mpg here in the land of cheap gas with more responsive transmission programming, and beat the others on drivability as only a well-executed step-gear transmission can.\n\nRide and Handling\n\nThe K5 rides nicely. It’s a reasonable mix of comfort and road feel that’s not trying to be too sporty — it leaves that for the coming GT 2.5T. Both my GT-Line and EX had 18-inch alloy wheels fitted with Pirelli P Zero all-season tires. LX and LXS trim levels come with 16-inch alloys, and the GT 2.5T will have 19s.\n\n2021 Kia K5 EX | Cars.com photo by Joe Wiesenfelder\n\nHandling is a similar story: competent, but not thrill-inducing. Again, the full GT is likely to be the one to watch for that, because it will have a sport-tuned suspension and its power-assist motor mounted to the steering rack rather than the column, which is generally accepted as a superior placement for feedback and performance.\n\nThe GT will also have larger brake discs, front and rear, which seems wise given the additional power. For what it’s worth, though, I found the brake pedal feel in the K5s I drove to be a welcome break from the many by-wire braking systems I’ve encountered lately. It was wonderfully linear and easy to modulate. Is it the conventional vacuum-boosted type? Yep. Did I prefer it? Sure did.\n\nIn the Cabin\n\nHow you react to the K5’s interior might depend on which one you enter. The GT-Line is so sportified on the outside I was a little let down by the inside. Apart from the flat-bottom steering wheel and identified seats, not much is special about it; it looks like a mid-level cabin — which, of course, it is. Entering from the LXS’ more modest exterior, or finding the more lush interior of an EX, might not evoke the same disappointment.\n\nThat’s not to say it’s bad. The materials are pretty nice, and the GT-Line had the smaller 8-inch touchscreen, which, as I explain below, is actually superior. The K5 doesn’t offer leather upholstery. The two lowest trim levels have manual cloth seats, the GT-Line adds a power driver’s seat and mixes cloth with leatherette (imitation leather), and the EX and GT 2.5T go full leatherette, though with separate designs. The front passenger seat has a standard height adjustment, which is nice to have (and no guarantee in today’s market). Power adjustment is optional on the EX and GT 2.5T.\n\nI found the driver’s seat to be comfortable, with exceptional seat travel — always nice for long-legged drivers. At 6-feet tall I didn’t even sit all the way back. When I raised the seat all the way, my head (not just my hair) contacted the roof alongside the panoramic moonroof, which is optional on the GT-Line and standard on the two highest trims.\n\nThe backseat’s outboard positions are also roomy and comfortable. I had about an inch of headroom to spare, and my knees were raised only a little bit by the height of the floor — an improvement over the Sonata. The center position, however, wasn’t usable by someone of my height, as my head was pushing into the ceiling. (I’ve found adequate headroom in many center rear seats, including in smaller size classes.) By the numbers, the K5’s backseat legroom is better than the Sonata’s by almost a half-inch, and it feels like it, but the Accord and Camry are both several inches roomier (see the specs side by side). The specs also show the Kia shy of backseat headroom versus the Sonata and Camry, but the Accord is listed as having 0.2 inch less.\n\n2021 Kia K5 GT-Line | Cars.com photo by Joe Wiesenfelder\nUsability and Those Touchscreens\n\nBoil it down and usability includes everything from conventional controls to what’s often minimized as the “multimedia system.” Overall, Kias can be as no-nonsense as any vehicle, depending on your perspective. A lot of folks think push-button transmissions are nonsense, so chalk one up for Kia, which uses a standard lever. Similarly, the K5’s standard issue controls are all mechanical push buttons, switches and knobs rather than touch-sensitive capacitive panels (aka, cost-saving nonsense). Drive modes can be changed via a rotary knob on the center console that you don’t have to look for — or at — in order to operate. All good.\n\n2021 Kia K5 EX with Premium Package | Cars.com photo by Joe Wiesenfelder\n\nRemote controllers with separate displays are often nonsense, but Kia went with a standard 8-inch touchscreen supported by a volume knob, a tuning knob and more mechanical buttons, along with one of the first standard wireless applications of Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Great, right? Right. My EX, however, was equipped with the optional 10.25-inch touchscreen system. In the words of Hannibal Lecter, “No no no, you were doing fine … ”\n\n2021 Kia K5 EX with Premium Package and wired Android Auto | Cars.com photo by Joe Wiesenfelder\n\nRight off the bat, this system eliminates the tuning knob, which bothers some people. It trades real buttons for capacitive ones, which bothers us. It sacrifices wireless CarPlay and Android Auto, reverting to the wired versions, for a screen that’s larger — or is it? Screens are measured diagonally, and if you bother to measure for yourself, as I did, you’ll find that the standard screen is 7 inches wide by 4 inches high. The optional screen’s image area is 9.5 inches wide but only 3.6 inches high. If you pay any attention to such things, you realize that display height is more important than width in many important areas, including mapping, backup camera views and definitely Android Auto, which gets only the left two-thirds of this screen rather than the whole one in the standard system. Android Auto users will probably conclude that this “upgrade” is actually a net loss.\n\n2021 Kia K5 GT-Line with standard touchscreen and wireless Android Auto | Cars.com photo by Joe Wiesenfelder\n\nIn fairness, though, wireless Android Auto is no bargain, in my opinion. You’re spared the unfathomable inconvenience of plugging a cord into your phone, but AA puts your phone to work, and you’re likely to leave the car with less battery life than you started out with if you don’t plug it in. I used the K5 EX’s wireless charging pad, and it still slowly lost its state of charge while my Samsung Galaxy S10 routed me and played SiriusXM. Even powerful wireless charging pads typically result in slower charging than the cord method, as we recently illustrated. (Kia’s claims of increased charging rates and a dedicated cooling fan both fell flat.) The same scenario when instead plugged into one of the K5 EX’s USB charging ports did increase the phone’s state of charge, though not by much. If you’re going to plug in anyway, you can live without a wireless smartphone interface.\n\n2021 Kia K5 GT-Line | Cars.com photo by Joe Wiesenfelder\n\nThere’s plenty wrong with the K5’s touchscreen “upgrade,” but the loss of wireless CarPlay and Android Auto isn’t it — it’s everything else detailed above. I should mention that the system also adds proprietary voice control, but I’ve never been one to control machines via voice, so I struggle to see the value. Your results may vary. Unfortunately, this feature isn’t a stand-alone option but rather part of the Premium Package ($3,400). If you want to avoid the touchscreen “upgrade” and stick with the 8-inch touchscreen, you’ll have to forgo Bose premium audio, a power front passenger seat, memory driver’s seat and outside mirrors, a heated steering wheel, the excellent Highway Driving Assist, Safe Exit Assist, rear parking collision avoidance and more.\n\nWithout the Premium Package you’ll also miss out on Active Sound Design, which augments the engine sound through the stereo, ironically making my tamer-looking K5 EX sound sportier than the sporty-looking GT-Line. What it didn’t do, however, was sound at all different when I changed the selectable settings. Kia later explained the differences are greatest under heavy load and high rpm (not my driving circumstances), and that the effect will be stronger in the GT 2.5T.\n\n2021 Kia K5 EX with Premium Package | Cars.com photo by Joe Wiesenfelder\nShould You Buy a Kia K5?\n\nEven if you skip the stripped LX trim level, the K5 is nicely equipped for the price, coming in at $25,455 for the LXS, $26,355 for the GT-Line and $28,955 for the EX, including destination charges. Once available, AWD will add $2,100 to the LXS and $3,700 to the GT-Line. These prices seem a bit steep considering Toyota’s AWD is $1,400 across the board, but the price increase includes features beyond AWD. For example, the LXS also adds heated seats and telematics to enable remote engine start, presuming the car will be used in cold climates. The GT-Line with AWD includes the Premium Package, which would be a $1,600 option with FWD. Kia’s warranty remains tops with five-year/60,000-mile bumper-to-bumper and roadside assistance coverage and a 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain plan.\n\nThe fact that Americans are more interested in SUVs hasn’t made mid-size sedans less competitive with each other; it’s actually the opposite. Any of the surviving models can do the job, but you have to check several out to gain perspective and determine what matters most to you. For example, the K5’s upgraded touchscreen system is essentially what I experienced in the redesigned Sonata; my frustration with it didn’t grow until Kia gave me the standard system in the K5 GT-Line. There’s a lot to like in the K5, and only if you experience it will you know if my hangups detailed above are ones you share.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The traditional mid-size sedan is fast going extinct. The Chevrolet Malibu and Subaru Legacy are both finished after the 2025 model year. Conversely, Kia just updated its entry in the segment, freshening the K5 for a more focused battle against the remaining Honda Accord, Toyota Camry and Hyundai Sonata corporate sibling. Having received new tech and a more powerful base engine for 2025, the Kia K5 rolls into 2026 unchanged and starts at $28,565 (all prices include $1,175 destination charge).\n\nRelated: 2024 Hyundai Sonata Vs. 2025 Kia K5 Vs. 2025 Toyota Camry: Auto Show Faceoff\n\nRelease Date and Pricing\n\nThe 2026 Kia K5 is on sale now. Pricing is as follows:\n\nLXS: $28,565\nGT-Line: $29,565\nGT: $34,665\nEX: $36,065\nWhat Are the 2026 Kia K5’s Trim Levels?\n\nThe K5 LXS rides on 16-inch wheels and has cloth seats (manually adjustable up front), but the entry-level trim is otherwise well equipped. It boasts front and rear LED exterior lighting, heated side mirrors, keyless entry and start, six speakers and dual-zone automatic climate control. Infotainment functions are controlled via a 12.3-inch touchscreen with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.\n\nKia’s Drive Wise safety suite is standard on every 2026 K5. It includes forward collision warning with pedestrian and bicyclist detection, automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning, lane departure steering assist, lane-centering steering, blind spot monitors, rear cross-traffic alert with automatic braking, front and rear parking sensors, a driver-attention monitor and automatic high beams.\n\nOne step up, the GT-Line wears black 18-inch wheels, a more aggressive grille and sportier bumpers for an appearance like that of the more powerful GT trim. It also features synthetic leather upholstery, upgraded interior trim, a flat-bottom steering wheel, a power-adjustable driver’s seat, heated front seats, navigation and a wireless charging pad.\n\nThe GT-Line looks the part, but the GT delivers. In addition to packing a potent turbocharged engine, it sits on a sport-tuned suspension and is fitted with quicker steering, larger brakes (13.6 inches up front and 12.8 inches out back, versus the standard 12.0- and 11.2-inch discs) with green calipers, and 19-inch wheels wearing wider tires. Kia’s signature green performance accents manifest in the cabin as bright piping on the seats. A panoramic moonroof is also standard.\n\nAt the top of the K5 range, the EX trim keeps the panoramic moonroof but leaves the performance gear to the GT. Instead, it adds a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, power-adjustable passenger seat, ventilated front seats, memory driver’s seat, heated steering wheel, a 12-speaker Bose sound system and faux wood trim. The EX also adds side parking sensors, a 360-degree camera system with blind spot cameras, and rear automatic emergency braking.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2025 Kia K5 Up Close: Mid-Size Master\n2021 Kia K5 Sedan Review: Former Optima Is Nearly Optimal\nMid-Size Sedans Struggle to Protect Rear-Seat Occupants in Revised Crash Test\nResearch the Kia K5\nFind Your Next Car\nWhat Are the 2026 Kia K5’s Powertrain Specs and MPG?\n\nThe K5 LXS, GT-Line and EX are powered by a 191-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine making 182 pounds-feet of torque; it’s paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission. The GT also has a 2.5-liter four-cylinder, but this one is turbocharged, boosting output to 290 hp and 311 pounds-feet; for that, the four-cylinder is backed by an eight-speed dual-clutch automatic with paddle shifters. Front-wheel drive is standard with both engines, and all-wheel drive is only available on the GT-Line, where it costs an additional $1,600.\n\nWith its smaller wheels and lighter equipment load, the K5 LXS gets slightly better fuel economy than the other trims that share its engine. Kia says it returns the same 26/37/30 mpg city/highway/combined as the 2025 model (official EPA ratings for the 2026 K5 are not yet available). The GT-Line and EX are rated at 25/36/29 mpg, while the AWD GT-Line returns 24/33/27 mpg. The GT’s turbo four is rated at 23/33/27 mpg.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Kia is reinventing itself with a new logo, a name change (Kia instead of Kia Motors) and a new moniker for its mid-size sedan formally known as the Optima. The 2022 Kia K5, which debuted for 2021, enters its sophomore model year with more standard convenience features on its top three trims, plus a new GT-Line AWD Premium Package to enhance the mid-tier trim’s offerings. \n\nRelated: 2021 Kia K5 Sedan Review: Former Optima Is Nearly Optimal\n\nAfter a redesign and name change for 2021, the K5 returns for 2022 with a healthy helping of new features on its higher trims. The K5 is available in LX, LXS, GT-Line, EX and GT trims, with all-wheel drive available on the LXS and GT-Line. For 2022, the K5 GT-Line, EX and GT receive a 360-degree camera system, additional wireless chargers and standard navigation. \n\nGT-Line AWD Premium Package \n\nKia beefs up its mid-tier GT-Line with a new AWD Premium Package, which for $1,900 adds a panoramic sunroof, heated steering wheel, LED projector headlights and additional driver-assist features that include Highway Driving Assist and navigation-based adaptive cruise control. None of these features are new to the 2022 K5 GT-Line — some came standard with AWD before or as part of another optional package — but they are reconfigured into the new GT-Line AWD Premium Package.  \n\nEngine Options\n\nAll 2022 K5s except the top-of-the-line GT are powered by a 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine that makes 180 horsepower and 195 pounds-feet of torque. The GT is only available with a 290-hp, turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder good for 311 pounds-feet of torque.\n\nPricing and Competition\n\nThe K5 has a starting price of $24,685 (all prices include destination) for the LX FWD, a modest increase of $100 over the 2021 LX FWD. The GT-Line AWD’s $28,685 starting price is reduced by $1,500 compared to 2021 because features that used to come standard with the GT-Line’s $3,700 AWD option are separated into the new GT-Line AWD Premium Package, which is $1,900.\n\nThe 2022 K5 is priced competitively among the 2021 mid-size sedan class. It’s frequently compared to the Honda Accord ($25,965 starting price), Hyundai Sonata ($24,955), Nissan Altima ($25,400) and Toyota Camry ($26,040). The 2022 Subaru Legacy is also currently on sale and starts at $23,955.\n\n2022 Kia K5 Pricing (Includes $995 Destination)\n\nLX FWD: $24,685\nLXS FWD: $25,685\nLXS AWD: $27,485\nGT-Line FWD: $27,085\nGT-Line AWD: $28,685\nEX FWD: $29,585\nGT FWD: $32,085\n\n \n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
