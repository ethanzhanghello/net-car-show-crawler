      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nLaunched in 2002, Kia’s Sedona is equipped with a 3.5-liter V-6 that works with a five-speed-automatic transmission. The 2004 Sedona got an interior and exterior freshening. Second-row captain’s chairs are available in the LX model for 2005, and the size of the rear drum brakes has increased.\n\nKia promotes the front-wheel-drive Sedona’s price and value. Its warranty covers the powertrain for 10 years or 100,000 miles. A redesigned Sedona appeared at the 2005 Chicago Auto Show; it will go on sale later in the year as a 2006 model.\n\nExterior\nThe Sedona’s styling breaks no new ground, so it’s similar to the competition. Its sleek appearance features a long sloping hood that leads into a grille that has a horizontal-bar design and multireflector headlights. Dual sliding side doors are standard. The higher-end EX model adds a body-colored roof rack, fog lights, alloy wheels and additional chrome trim.\n\nInterior\nSedonas can seat up to seven occupants. Depending on the model, the second row has standard bucket seats or a two-place bench seat. A three-person removable bench seat is installed in the third row. The Sedona has 10 cupholders.\n\nStandard LX equipment includes front and rear air conditioning, twin glove boxes, a CD stereo, power windows and locks, cruise control, a tilt steering wheel, an intermittent rear wiper and washer, and rear privacy glass. The EX model adds heated mirrors, power rear-quarter windows, lighted vanity mirrors, keyless entry and a cassette/CD stereo. Only a handful of options, including a DVD-based entertainment system, moonroof and leather upholstery, are offered.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Sedona’s 3.5-liter V-6 develops 195 horsepower. The V-6 runs on regular gasoline and drives a five-speed-automatic transmission.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes are optional, but side-impact airbags are not available. Child-safety seat anchors are installed in the second row.\n\nDriving Impressions\nTaken as a whole, the Sedona ranks as top-notch even if it doesn’t stand out from the minivan pack in any specific category. The Sedona is comfortable, smooth-riding, refined and energetic � it scores high in each important minivan attribute. Take its modest sticker price into consideration, and Kia clearly has another high-value model.\n\nThe Sedona accelerates in a hurry. Even when trudging up long grades, the V-6 pulls the minivan along effortlessly. The transmission responds smoothly, with only moderate delay when a downshift is necessary. The Sedona is exceptionally quiet, and it handles predictably. Not only is the steering pleasantly precise, but the Sedona is also easy to drive.\n\nMost of the minivan’s seats are comfortable and spacious, but the second-row seats are a bit hard. Getting into the driver’s seat isn’t as easy as it is in some minivans. The Sedona’s EPA-estimated gas mileage trails the competition. Otherwise, quibbles are few for Kia’s appealing, if unexceptional, minivan.",

      "expert_review": "Kia Motors Corp. makes the best minivan for the money — better than the Toyota Sienna, Honda Odyssey, Chrysler Town & Country or the Dodge Caravan.\n\nThe rivals are all nice family haulers. But nice doesn’t cut it in the marketplace. Value does.\n\nThe 2006 Kia Sedona LX minivan offers the most value, which is not to be confused with the lowest price.\n\nLow prices are meaningless for inferior products.\n\nThe Kia Sedona is first-class in all respects — quality of craftsmanship and engineering, quality of interior materials, highway performance and safety. I liked the Sedona LX so much, I didn’t want to return it to the manufacturer.\n\nA minivan! I couldn’t believe it!\n\nBut after nearly 600 miles on the highways, byways and back roads of Virginia and West Virginia, I became a convert. The front-wheel-drive Sedona LX handled the heights of the Blue Ridge Mountains without hesitation. It was sure-footed in the curves and dips of the Shenandoah Valley, and it ran with unruffled confidence amidst the ruffian 18-wheelers roaring along Interstate 81 across the eastern panhandle of West Virginia.\n\nAnd it was peaceful — peaceful!\n\nMinivans exist solely to haul families, friends and stuff. That is why most minivans, like the Sedona LX, have seating for seven people.\n\nBut people can be problematical. They have wants and needs that become demands and arguments on long road trips. It matters not that you love them, or that they love you. Uncomfortable passengers can turn a long drive into a journey to hell.\n\nA comfortable passenger cabin — one that grants all aboard ample personal space and that treats their backs and bottoms kindly — is the best antidote to such misery. The Sedona LX has a passenger-pampering cabin, which is all the more remarkable because there is nothing fancy about it.\n\nThe standard seats are cloth-covered. But they are thoughtfully contoured, expertly upholstered. There is a smartly designed front tray that can hold a book or laptop — or serve as a small dinner table. Other storage nooks abound. There are 14 cupholders.\n\nNone of my three passengers complained on the Virginia-West Virginia run. There were no jibes about a ride too harsh, too soft or too bouncy. Two of them were so comfortable, they fell asleep. Peace reigned! Hallelujah!\n\nAutomotive journalists and self-described auto enthusiasts often speak of “fun to drive,” a phrase they reserve for anything that isn’t a minivan, a vehicle they regard as uncool, little more than a household appliance.\n\nThey do not understand the point of the journey, which is to move freely, swiftly when doing so is either necessary or desired, but always safely and comfortably — preferably at an affordable price. The Sedona LX embraces that understanding. In doing so, it makes so much of what is installed in rival minivans seem excessive.\n\nHere is a minivan that comes with a gutsy 3.8-liter, 244-horsepower V-6 engine but that still gets 25 miles per gallon on the highway using regular unleaded fuel. It fits neatly into urban parking garages. It has top crash-safety ratings from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. It does anything anyone reasonably can expect a minivan to do, and it does it all for a base price starting under $23,000.\n\nThe Kia Sedona LX moves to the top of this column’s minivan list. It’s earned it.\n\nNuts & Bolts\n2006 Kia Sedona LX Minivan\n\nComplaints: None. This one is everything a minivan should be, including affordable.\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: Excellent in all three categories in city and highway traffic, whether unloaded (driver only, no cargo) or heavily loaded (driver and three passengers and an estimated 250 pounds of cargo).\n\nHead-turning quotient: It’s a minivan. That means it gets as much attention as Hollywood gives to stable families.\n\nBody style/layout: The Kia Sedona LX is a front-engine, front-wheel-drive minivan with four side doors (manually operated sliding rear doors) and a rear hatch. Automatically operated sliding rear doors are available. It also is sold with the upscale EX trim package.\n\nEngine/transmission: The Sedona minivan comes with a standard 3.8-liter V-6 engine that develops 244 horsepower at 6,000 revolutions per minute and 253 foot-pounds of torque at 3,500 rpm. The engine is mated to a five-speed automatic transmission that also can be shifted manually. The manual mode gives the driver better vehicle control on mountainous, curvy roads.\n\nCapacities: It seats seven. Cargo capacity with second- and third-row seats down is 142 cubic feet. With seats up, it’s 32.2 cubic feet. The fuel tank holds 21.1 gallons of recommended regular unleaded gasoline.\n\nMileage: I averaged 25 miles per gallon in highway travel. And that included loaded and unloaded runs!\n\nSafety: The Kia Sedona has top crash-safety ratings from both the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. No wonder. Standard equipment includes head airbags for all three rows, side air bags for front-seat passengers, traction and stability control, anti-whiplash head restraints, antilock brakes. Impressive.\n\nPrice: Base price on the 2006 Kia Sedona LX is $22,995. Dealer’s invoice price on base model is $21,700. Price as tested is $25,165, including $1,500 in options (rear entertainment audio-visual system, roof rails and cross bars) and a $670 destination charge. Dealer’s price as tested is $23,680.\n\nPurse strings: It’s a buy. Compare with any mid-sized minivan.",

      "expert_review": "Tell folks your ride is a Kia, and they’re likely to arch an eyebrow.\n\nThen a faint glimmer of recognition – ah, the pint-sized SUV – Sportage. Nope. Oh, yeah, that new Optima sedan. Wrong again, weak link.\n\nThe last thing with which they’re likely to associate the name is a minivan, for this is the first minivan to originate in South Korea, Kia’s home, and was just introduced for the 2002 model year. It’s not mini in the sense of tiny, either, but rather in the accepted sense of garageable, unlike those things that make runs to the airport.\n\nIn size, the Sedona lies between the standard-wheelbase Dodge Caravan and the extended wheel-base version of that archetypal soccer-mom mount.\n\nTo which, it can accommodate 7 people, assuming the median age isn’t too high, stretching 194 inches overall. The axles are 114 inches apart.\n\nIt stands 5 feet, 9 inches high, so it’s neither cute nor overwhelming, and offers a driving position that is the No. 1 thing many people love about SUVs and minivans: raised above the passenger-car riff-raff.\n\nThere’s nothing daring about the exterior styling, which is also to say it’s neither bizarre nor overdone. It would fit right in at any church picnic.\n\nIt’s certainly an audacious move for one of the smallest players in the U.S. market to introduce a vehicle in this class; it’s remarkable how well they did with this first effort. People buy some marques for their established quality, reflected in the absence of unscheduled trips to that torture chamber called “the dealer’s.”\n\nWith Kia, as with its new parent company Hyundai, the lure is price, with what at this point can only be characterized as a hope for longevity. Like Hyundai, Kia offers a knockout warranty that can be construed either as betokening the maker’s confidence or the marketplace’s skepticism – 10 years, 100,000 miles on the powertrain, and 5 years, 60,000 comprehensive protection. An unlimited-mileage 5-year roadside assistance plan is thrown in as a lagniappe. If that doesn’t get your attention, the sticker will. You can get in a Sedona for considerably less than 20 grand, and even that one isn’t too austere.\n\nAt a minimum, the base Sedona LX has a six-cylinder engine coupled to a five-speed automatic transmission, two sliding side doors, body-colored side moldings, privacy glass, power locks, windows and door locks, air conditioning, power mirrors, tilt wheel, cruise control and a plethora of cupholders and vanity and courtesy lights.\n\nIf you feel bad about spending so little, you can pop an extra two grand for the EX series, marked mainly by its (optional) contrasting body side moldings and some upgraded interior components. The radio is souped up and there are electrically-operated pop-out windows in the rear quarter. But mechanically, it’s identical with its more value-conscious sibling.\n\nAntilock brakes are optional, but at least they’re available on both series. The EX can also be fitted with a power moonroof and leather seating.\n\nThe EX I was given to try out was loaded, and it still stickered at less than 24 grand, a price that falls short of what a good midsize sedan goes for these days.\n\nFit and finish on my sample were quite good, and the interior materials appeared to be of good quality and were pleasant to behold and to touch. The leather even had a little of that tackroom aroma that makes it worth the price of admission. The Sedona is made in South Korea, so don’t expect to special-order one. One would imagine, given the price, that most dealers will order EXs with all the goodies, so color choice may be the only variable.\n\nSo is it as good a buy as it appears to be? Dunno, and that’s the rub. Only time will tell, although I encountered nothing that would make me doubt it.\n\nThe ride quality, unladen, was pretty good. I suspect that if it were burdened with the rated 1,186 pounds load, the shocks and springs would seem a bit overworked, but that’s okay; it’ll be spending most of its life well under gross vehicle weight, I’d imagine. That is my cue to mention something gross – the vehicle weight. Standing there with no load and half a tank of gas, a Sedona goes 4,709 pounds. That nearly 500 pounds more than a comparably equipped Dodge Grand Caravan. I suppose Kia would argue that its mass argues for the solidity of its construction, but I think the truth is they’ve not yet mastered the subtle art of saving avoirdupois without decreasing strength.\n\nIn charge of moving all that bulk is a 3.5-liter double-overhead-cam V-6 engine. It produces 195 hp at 5,500 rpm, and 218 foot-pounds of torque at 3,500. It works for 87-octane. Even with only a driver, albeit a restaurateur’s delight, the Sedona was predictably slow off the mark. It got to 60 mph in a bit over 12 seconds – school bus territory. Once under way, however, it didn’t feel all that bad. The torque was present over a fairly wide range, and with five gears abetting, the machine felt brisker than the drag-race figures imply.\n\nThe transmission was not the greatest, with sometimes harsh changes under heavy throttle and a reluctance to obey an order for a quick downshift. In moderate going it was fine.\n\nThe Sedona’s official interior volume is 150 cubic feet. With all seats in place, there’s 21.8 cubic feet for cargo behind the third row, about 50 percent more space than you’d get in a midsized car’s trunk.\n\nKia was astute enough to maximize the utility by making the second and third rows either foldable or removable, to accommodate many permutations of people and stuff. The twin sliding doors help, too. I know moms worry about that outside door, but it has a child-safety switch which prevents it from being opened from the inside – just tell the little beggars they’re under arrest. It slid easily enough, even on a moderate grade, that I didn’t long for a power assist.\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gave the Sedona top marks – five stars – in every one of its four tests: front impact, side impact, front compartment, rear compartment.\n\nKia barely began crowing over that honor when the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety weighed in with a bucket of cold water. The IIHS tests are more severe than the government’s. They call for a 35-mph offset crash into a barrier. They decreed the Sedona “acceptable” overall, their second-highest rating. (They’re stingy with the adjectives; their top mark is “good”. They thought the test dummy was thrown about too much, suggestive of the possibility of head and neck trauma. The real bummer came when IIHS did its 5-mph bumper crash tests. When they ran the front of the Sedona into a flat barrier, both air b ags went off. (They’re not supposed to trigger unless the collision speed is 25 mph or so). Fixing them plus the bumper would cost $4,305, IIHS estimated. Air bags aside, the rear bumper seemed to be made of cardboard; it allowed $2,971 worth of damage when pounding a pole at a mere 5 mph. At that rate, it might pay to have an aftermarket radar unit added.\n\nOn the air bag issue, Kia claims it has reworked the system to keep the bags stowed unless it’s a much more serious impact. Neither head nor side-curtain bags are available.\n\nThe brakes are discs/drums. Pedal feel was rather mushy, and stopping distances were somewhat extended.\n\nThe test vehicle was $20,995 to start with. The PR staff added antilock brakes for $695, leather for $850, sunroof for $575, and two-tone paint, $195. Total suggested price, with freight, was $23,805. Payments on that one would be $483, assuming 20 percent down, 10 percent interest and 48 coupons. Edmunds.com finds a skeptical mr etplace is making dealers knock off as much as $1,800 to move the iron. Do you feel lucky?",

      "expert_review": "With refined cabins and literally dozens of family-friendly features, a few of today’s minivans might appeal to any car shopper, not just the minivan set. The Kia Sedona is not one of them. As competent as the current generation is, it’s still stuck in utilitarian land.\n\nThe thing is, that’s all it needs to be. Minivan buyers who want to love what they drive can fork over thousands more for a Honda Odyssey or one of Chrysler’s decked-out haulers. Give the kids enough time, and they’ll still demolish it like yesterday’s kitchen linoleum. Kia’s alternative is safe, swallows plenty of cargo and executes the features it has well enough. It never rises beyond its calling, but it gets the job done at a bargain price. Call me a cynic, but I think that’s what a minivan ought to do.\n\nThe seven-seat Sedona was redesigned for 2006. Sister company Hyundai introduced the related Entourage for 2007; click here to compare the 2008 Sedona with the Entourage and a 2007 Sedona. Today’s Sedona comes in short- and long-wheelbase LX trim levels, as well as a long-wheelbase EX, which I drove.\n\nExterior & Styling\nMinivans rarely venture into the styling wilderness — Nissan tried with the Quest, and it’s still finding its way back — but Kia’s contender seems especially conservative. Its oversized headlights and body-colored grille flow into each other well enough, but neither element is the sort of thing anyone will remember.\n\nThe Sedona LX has 16-inch steel wheels and body-colored moldings; EX models add 17-inch alloy wheels, fog lights and a chrome tailgate strip. At 202 inches long, the long-wheelbase Sedona sits within an inch of most major competitors, and its 39.6-foot turning circle competes with the Quest and with Chrysler’s twins, the Dodge Grand Caravan and Chrysler Town & Country. The Odyssey and Toyota Sienna manage sub-37-foot circles.\n\nShort-wheelbase models have a 5.1-inch shorter wheelbase and measure about a foot shorter overall. Besides the soon-to-be discontinued Chevrolet Uplander, Kia is the only automaker to offer a short-wheelbase minivan; the Entourage comes only in long-wheelbase form.\n\nMoving In\nInside, the cabin’s overlapping surfaces lack the finish quality you’ll find in an Odyssey or Quest, but the upper-dash plastics are precisely fitted and soft to the touch, which is something I can’t say of the low-rent surfaces in Chrysler’s minivans. Buttons reside where you’d expect them to: The two largest dash knobs intuitively control fan speed for the front and rear cabin, and controls for the optional power seats are on the doors — an easier location than along the sides of the chairs.\n\nThe Sedona’s upper and lower glove compartments and pull-out storage bins at knee level are typical minivan fare, and a center storage tray between the front seats folds to allow a pass-thru to the rear. Some competitors have entire consoles to swallow purses and diaper bags, but that’s a trade-off for the versatility of converting the area into an aisle (though the uplevel consoles in the Sienna and Grand Caravan are removable so you can do just that). The Sedona’s setup mirrors the collapsible tray in the Odyssey. I prefer a closed compartment.\n\nMy test car came with leather upholstery. Its quality is closer to the leather in Chrysler’s minivans than the Odyssey’s upscale cowhide, but it proved supportive enough during a three-hour Labor Day weekend slog between Chicago and Milwaukee. Six-foot-plus drivers may find the seats don’t move back far enough. Making matters worse, the steering wheel lacks a telescoping adjustment, something the Odyssey and Sienna both provide. Power-adjustable pedals are optional on the Sedona EX.\n\nSecond-row captain’s chairs are standard, and their wide range of adjustments should leave adults with plenty of headroom and legroom. Move the seats forward a few clicks, and there’s adult-friendly legroom in the third row; like most third rows, however, the seat is too low to the ground for adequate thigh support. Best to put the kids back there.\n\nEntertainment options include a rear DVD player with an 8-inch flip-down screen, as well as a 13-speaker Infinity stereo. My tester came thus equipped, and the stereo belted out some of the most disappointing audio quality since … the optional Bose stereo in the last Quest that came through the Cars.com fleet. Are minivans where acoustics go to die? On a more practical front, the Sedona’s stereo lacks an auxiliary jack for iPods or other MP3 players, something many competitors have standard. Kia says one is on its way for 2009 models. I also hope the optional steering-wheel audio controls, which can change volume but won’t advance CD tracks or radio stations, will get an overhaul.\n\nMoving Stuff\nI helped a friend move across town — next year I must go into hiding the first week of September — and the Sedona’s 141.5 cubic feet of maximum cargo volume fit half the contents of a studio apartment, including a double bed and box frame. Like its peers, the long-wheelbase Sedona’s third row folds in a 60/40-split into a rear cavity to create a flat load floor; the third row in the short-wheelbase Sedona lacks this feature, so its seatback simply folds down in a 50/50 split over the cushions. Maximum cargo space requires hauling out the removable second-row chairs, too, which is no easy task; Chrysler and Nissan offer more convenient fold-flat second-row seats.\n\nWith the seats up, cargo room behind the long-wheelbase Sedona’s third row totals a disappointing 32.2 cubic feet, a figure the Sienna beats by 11.4 cubic feet. Maximum cargo volume is much more competitive. The short-wheelbase Sedona LX loses significant cargo volume and passenger volume, which takes the biggest hit in the second row, dropping nearly 4 inches of legroom compared to the second row in the long-wheelbase Sedona. Here’s how the cargo numbers compare:\n\nCargo Room (cu. ft.)\n\tBehind 3rd row\tBehind 2nd row\tBehind 1st row\nToyota Sienna\t43.6\t94.5\t148.9\nHonda Odyssey\t38.4\t91.1\t147.4\nDodge Grand Caravan\t32.3\t83.0\t140.6*\nKia Sedona LWB\t32.2\t80.1\t141.5\nNissan Quest\t32.1\t84.8\t148.1\nKia Sedona SWB\t12.9\t61.8\t121.3\n*SXT model; SE has 144.3 cu. ft.\nSource: Manufacturer data for 2008 models.\n\nMoving Around\nA 250-horsepower, 3.8-liter V-6 and five-speed automatic come standard. The same drivetrain, albeit with tweaks to its specific output, powers Kia’s Amanti sedan and Sorento SUV, not to mention a number of Hyundai models. It’s a competent ally in many of them, but the Sedona saddles it with up to 4,646 pounds of curb weight. That’s more than the front-wheel-drive Sienna, Grand Caravan or Quest. Power around town is adequate, but the Sedona’s gas pedal feels a bit lazy. I detected no major lag, but it’s less responsive than the get-up-and-go accelerators in the Odyssey and Quest. Leadfoots will prefer the 4.0-liter Grand Caravan or Town & Country, which is something of a mom-racer among minivans.\n\nThe Sedona moves quickly enough when pushed, though there is significant torque steer under hard acceleration. The automatic upshifts smoothly around town, but it takes awhile to downshift — something I’ve harped about with Kia and Hyundai’s other five-speed automatics. Accelerate out of a slow corner, and the transmission often loiters in third or fourth gear when you need second, leaving you wanting for power to get back up to cruising speed. I found highway kickdown similarly indecisive, but when the right gear finally came along, I was able to easily pass others, even with four adults and some light luggage in back.\n\nLike other minivans, the Sedona has a four-wheel-independent suspension. Ride quality on the highway is acceptable, with low wind and road noise overall, but the suspension responds loudly to bumps. The steering feels less power-assisted and heavier to turn at lower speeds than I’d expect for a minivan. In quick maneuvers, it yields vague responses with plenty of body roll — on par for minivans.\n\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes are standard. The pedal feels mushy, and hard stops elicit plenty of forward suspension dive. Gas mileage is an EPA-estimated 16/23 mpg city/highway; that’s at the low end of minivans, but not unreasonable. When properly equipped, the Sedona can tow 3,500 pounds — again, competitive.\n\nSafety & Reliability\nAfter scoring Good — the top grade — in frontal, side and rear crash tests, the Sedona and Entourage were named Top Safety Picks by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. That’s certainly laudable, but it doesn’t give Kia a major competitive edge. The Odyssey is also an IIHS Top Safety Pick, and the Sienna, Quest and Chrysler twins received Good front and side-impact scores.\n\nStandard safety features on the Sedona include front and side-impact airbags for the front seats and side curtain airbags for all three rows. Front active head restraints are also standard, as are antilock brakes, traction control and an electronic stability system.\n\nReliability has been problematic. In Consumer Reports owner surveys, the current-generation Sedona scored poorly in body hardware, paint quality, and squeaks and rattles. The publication predicts new-car reliability to be worse than average. Kia counters with its impressive 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty and five-year/60,000-mile bumper-to-bumper warranty, so if things break, at least it shouldn’t cost you to fix them.\n\nFeatures & Pricing\nExcluding the destination charge, the short-wheelbase Sedona LX starts at just $20,695; the long-wheelbase LX runs an extra $2,900 but also adds the fold-into-the-floor third row and upgraded cloth upholstery. Standard features on both include power front and second-row windows, keyless entry, tri-zone manual A/C, cruise control and an eight-speaker CD stereo. Not bad for an entry-level trim.\n\nThe EX adds power front seats, power rear-quarter windows and alloy wheels; heated leather upholstery, automatic climate control, parking sensors, a DVD system and a moonroof are optional, as are power sliding doors and a power tailgate. Fully loaded, the Sedona tops out just over $31,000. That’s some $9,000 less than loaded competitors, but Kia doesn’t offer features like a navigation system or backup camera. Many of them do.\n\nSedona in the Market\nCrossovers notwithstanding, the most cargo room and kid-friendly features for the buck still belong to the minivan. Buyers don’t seem to care. They’re deserting the minivan segment at a steady pace, leaving its purveyors in a sales stall. For the Sedona and Entourage, it’s more of a freefall: In August alone, sales were down 70 percent. Kia says the numbers don’t have anything to do with supply issues; rather, the minivan market is just in a funk.\n\nBad news for Kia is good news for you. Cash incentives on the Sedona total $4,000 to $5,000 right now, so getting one out the door for under $20,000 is entirely possible. It won’t match Honda’s cabin quality or Chrysler’s feature content, but it meets all the basic needs a minivan should — and it saves you a bundle. For some parents, I suspect that’s exactly the appeal they’re looking for.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "My first time was memorable simply because it was just that: My first time. It wasn’t exactly filled with magical moments, and, quite frankly, it lacked the frills and finesse I was hoping for, but it will always hold a special place in my heart. Yup, I’ll never forget the first time I drove a minivan – specifically, a Kia Sedona.\n\nIt’s true. Until two weeks ago, I was a minivan virgin. Perhaps, as with other notable firsts, my expectations were too high. What was I expecting? Polka dots and moonbeams to swirl around my head? The earth and sun to move? I don’t know, but the bottom line is, while the Kia Sedona has a lot to offer for such an affordable car, I’d like to find a minivan with more frills.\n\nAt the beginning, the Sedona lured me with its cute looks. It seemed more stylish and better-looking than other minivans. I decided I liked it, giving no thought to how we’d relate to each other beyond the superficial. Once we got to know each other a little better, though, it turned out there were a few things that just didn’t work for me.\n\nFirst of all, this baby was kind of hard to steer. It often felt as if it just didn’t know how to move the parts it came equipped with. It was also very loud in there, as if the Sedona had no insulation from the outside world. The sliding doors in the base model I drove were heavy and cumbersome to open and close. (The LX and EX can have power sliding doors, which I would highly recommend.) I also had a hard time folding the third-row seats down when I needed to store bigger things. I had to put those seats down to accommodate my stroller, which was a pain. If I’m driving a minivan, I’d like to not have to struggle for storage space. Plus, the interior materials consisted of an obvious plastic that lacked some luster, if you know what I mean. It had all the necessary components, and they all worked fine, they just didn’t do it for me.\n\nAll that said, with a starting price around $20,000, I must admit there were some magical elements for such an affordable car – elements I certainly will remember and look for in my next minivan. For starters, there were eight cupholders! Because I often have several beverages going at once – water, coffee, etc. – that made me pretty happy. There was also ample storage space in the front: two glove compartments, a nice center console that held my huge purse/diaper bag with room to spare, and lots of legroom. There was a lot of legroom in the middle row, too, which made it a comfy ride for adult and child passengers alike.\n\nAnother bonus about the Sedona’s second row is that the windows on the sliding doors roll down – I never knew minivan sliding-door windows could do that! Plus, those sliding doors have pinch protection so the little ones’ tiny digits don’t get caught. The stereo had a good sound, which is a must given my need to either throw in some kiddie rock to soothe my son or crank up my own music to drown out his cries when my soothing plight has become futile. There are two sets of Latch connectors in the second row that are easy to get to, and a conversation mirror up front allows you to see your whole brood while you drive. You know, looking over that list of goodies, maybe my first time was a little more magical than I initially gave it credit for being.\n\nTruth be told, the Sedona is probably a pretty good car for anyone with a growing family, because we all know that the more kids you have, the more practical your spending habits need to be. At the end of the day, this is a car that works, is super affordable and has ample room for the driving mommy and her daily entourage of goodies and accessories.\n\nAs for me, maybe it didn’t work out between the Sedona and I because I just want to explore my other options in minivans. I’m sure the Sedona could work out a nice relationship with someone else. I guess what I’m trying to say, Kia Sedona, is it’s not you, it’s me.\n\n*For more information on the Kia Sedona and its safety features, visit Cars.com.

      "expert_review": "Kia dropped a bunch of surprises on the crowd at the 2018 New York International Auto Show, including this — the lightly refreshed 2019 Kia Sedona minivan. Featuring some minor tweaks and revisions, plus a lightly redone look front and rear, and a couple of new features inside, this is a mild refresh of the existing Sedona that has been on sale for a few years.\n\nExterior\n\nThe outside of the Sedona looks much as it did before, but the new front end, headlights, grille and foglights are restyled to bring the Sedona more in line with the rest of the look of the Kia lineup. Five trim levels are still available: L, LX, EX/EX Premium, SX and SXL. The SX and SXL trims receive standard LED headlights, while all models get redesigned taillights and tailgate trim.\n\nNew 17-, 18- and 19-inch wheels will be available, depending on trim level. A new power sliding-door button has been added to the exterior handles of the EX and higher trim levels, providing one-touch entry to the van’s cabin.\n\nInterior\n\nInside, the Sedona gets a few tweaks and tucks. Most noticeable will be a new style for the console and instrument cluster, with new graphics for both. A new wireless smartphone charger is added to the redesigned console, which also gets a new electronic parking brake, standard on SX and SXL trims.\n\nIn back, a new USB charging plug has been added to the cargo area for third-row occupants, while the rear entertainment system now has twin 10.1-inch touchscreens located in the front seatbacks. It has the ability to mirror smartphone interfaces when used with compatible devices, allowing videos to be played directly from a plugged-in device. The premium audio system is now a Harman Kardon system, instead of the previous model’s Infinity-branded system.\n\nUnder the Hood\n\nPowering the Sedona is the same naturally aspirated 3.3-liter V-6 engine as before, but now mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission. Horsepower remains the same at 276 and torque is unchanged from 248 pounds-feet, but Kia expects the van’s fuel economy numbers to improve thanks to the new gearbox.\n\nSafety\n\nThe Sedona returns with a host of available safety systems, including smart cruise control with stop-and-go functionality, rear cross-traffic alert, blind spot warning, forward collision warning and autonomous emergency braking. But now it adds an attention monitor called Driver Attention Warning, which monitors vehicle and driving behavior to detect a fatigued or inattentive driver.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nKia is one of a handful of carmakers to offer a minivan in both short- and long-wheelbase versions. Both offer the same standard V-6 engine. The long-wheelbase Sedona comes in standard LX and upscale EX trim levels. The short-wheelbase Sedona is available in a single, base trim level. The Hyundai Entourage is closely related to the Sedona.\n\nThe Sedona competes with the Honda Odyssey and Dodge Grand Caravan.\n\nNew for 2009\nThe 2009 Kia Sedona gets standard Sirius Satellite Radio with three months of free service and a USB connection port for MP3 players. EX models get an optional navigation unit.\n\nExterior\nAt 189.4 inches long, the short-wheelbase Sedona is about a foot shorter than the long-wheelbase version. Both minivans are 78.1 inches wide. The long-wheelbase version is on par with other minivans in the segment.\n\nAvailable 16- or 17-inch wheels\nStandard power mirrors\nFog lights standard on EX\nHeated front windshield standard on LX and EX\nPower sliding doors optional on LX, standard on EX\nPower tailgate standard on EX\nPower sunroof standard on LX, optional on EX\n\nInterior\nThe Sedona’s seven-occupant interior features one-touch flip-and-fold seats in the second row for easier access to the rear. Long-wheelbase models have a standard 60/40-split third-row seat that can fold into the floor. In the short-wheelbase Sedona, the rear seat folds down, but not into the floor.\n\nThird-row headroom in the short-wheelbase Sedona drops 1.9 inches compared to the long-wheelbase version, and shoulder room falls 3.3 inches. Second-row occupants in the short-wheelbase version lose 3.9 inches of legroom versus the long-wheelbase Sedona. Cargo capacity behind the third row drops from 32.2 cubic feet in the long-wheelbase version to just 12.9 cubic feet in the short-wheelbase Sedona. Overall, there’s 172.3 cubic feet of passenger space in the long-wheelbase model, which bests the Grand Caravan and Odyssey.\n\nAvailable cloth or leather seating surfaces\nStandard air conditioning with three-zone controls\nStandard front- and second-row power windows\nStandard power door locks and keyless entry\nStandard cruise control\nOptional navigation system (EX)\nOptional Infinity audio system with 11 speakers (EX)\nOptional rear DVD player with 8-inch monitor (LX and EX)\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe five-speed automatic transmission includes a manual-shift mode, something few minivans offer.\n\n250-horsepower, 3.8-liter V-6 with 253 pounds-feet of torque\nFive-speed automatic transmission\n\nSafety\n\n\nStandard side-impact airbags\nStandard side curtain airbags\nStandard antilock brakes\nStandard electronic stability control\nStandard traction control\nOptional back-up warning system (LX and EX)",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Kia Sedona?\n\nThe front-wheel-drive 2020 Kia Sedona minivan seats seven or eight, depending on the trim level. It’s powered by a 276-horsepower, 3.3-liter V-6 engine that works with an eight-speed automatic transmission. Competitors include the Chrysler Pacifica, Toyota Sienna and Honda Odyssey.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Kia Sedona?\n\nThere are no changes this year.\n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Kia Sedona Are Most Important?\n\nThe Sedona’s family friendly interior and easy-to-reach Latch anchors help make it a good choice for families with young children. The standard touchscreen multimedia system includes Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity, and a rear-seat entertainment system is available. The Sedona offers important active safety features like automatic emergency braking and lane departure and blind spot warnings, but they’re only available on higher trim levels.\n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Kia Sedona?\n\nIf you’re looking for a roomy, comfortable family minivan with an easy-to-use multimedia system, the Sedona is worth a look. The second-row captain’s chairs and the third-row seat aren’t the easiest to fold, but the Sedona’s value-oriented pricing will appeal to budget-minded shoppers.",

      "expert_review": "As the mom of a preschooler and infant twins, I seldom get excited about anything other than sleep these days. Kia’s redesigned minivan, however, perked me up quicker than an extra-large, double-shot vanilla latte.\n\nThe redesigned 2015 Kia Sedona is a well-executed family-hauler that will keep Mom, Dad and the rug rats comfortable and entertained; while it’s leaps and bounds ahead of its predecessor, though, it doesn’t quite leapfrog its competitors.\n\nThe Sedona was redesigned this year with bolder styling, a new engine and more convenience features; compare the 2014 and 2015 models here. Major players in the class include the Toyota Sienna, Honda Odyssey and a pair of twins: the Chrysler Town & Country and Dodge Grand Caravan. Compare them all here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nApparently, Kia doesn’t know that “minivan” is no longer a dirty word. The automaker says the Sedona wears crossover-like styling and calls it a “midsize multi-purpose vehicle.” Whatever Kia says, there’s no mistaking the Sedona’s identity as a minivan — but it is the best-looking minivan in the segment. The Sedona can’t escape the body style’s chunky, Dustbuster-wedge profile and telltale sliding-door tracks, but up front it’s all style. Its giant, multifaceted grille is studded with plenty of chrome and flanked by sleek LED-accented headlights; the back finishes strongly with a liftgate spoiler. The overall look is smart, aggressive and even — dare I say it? — sporty.\n\nHow It Drives\nLoaded with kids and gear, the Sedona is a confident highway cruiser whose direct-injected, 3.3-liter V-6 engine never felt strained. The 276-horsepower unit performed adequately from a stop, and the six-speed automatic transmission easily delivered more gusto for passing and merging.\n\nA button near the steering wheel engages a fuel-saving Eco mode that dulls accelerator response, but not annoyingly so. In terms of fuel economy, the Sedona is midpack, with an EPA rating of 18/24/20 mpg city/highway/combined, a notch above the Chrysler vans (17/25/20) but trailing the Honda Odyssey (19/28/22).\n\nOn the road, the ride is on the firm side. It took small pavement imperfections in stride but was outmatched by Chicago’s never-ending construction season; larger potholes unleashed a ripple of bumps throughout the cabin. The Sedona handles like the long, hulking van it is, with a lack of agility that’s shared across the class. It leans around corners and floats over bumps, but is easier to park than other vans because it has one of the smallest turning circles in the segment. The optional Around View Monitor camera system also made short work of parking maneuvers with its large screen, multiple-angle views and parking guidelines.\n\nInterior\nThe Sedona can make an impression before you even open the door with its optional and neat Smart Welcome system: It illuminates the door handles and unfolds the side mirrors when the key fob is nearby. Inside, families will find comfortable, nice materials in all three rows — but $43,000 should net you more than “nice”; I expected more wow factor from the top-of-the-line SX Limited model I drove. The front row’s leather seats with contrast stitching look and feel high-quality, but the rest of this trim’s materials fall flat. The multicolored plastic-on-plastic theme is fine, as is the shiny black plastic on the instrument panel, but Kia’s efforts to class things up with a tiny swatch of wood-like trim on the door panels strikes me as cheap. It doesn’t match the rest of the cabin, and if you blink, you’ll miss it.\n\nIt’s easy to find a comfortable driving position in the Sedona thanks to a tall ride height, plenty of head- and legroom, and generous seat travel. Second-row passengers will also enjoy adult-friendly amounts of head- and legroom on plush, comfortable seats. My test model was equipped with lounge-seating captain’s chairs in the second row with pop-out leg rests. This is not a new feature; Toyota offers them in the Sienna, and both there and in the Sedona they feel gimmicky to me. Then again, I’m not a 10-year-old.\n\nGetting back to the Sedona’s third row should be easy thanks to the available Slide-N-Stow second-row seats that fold, slide forward and lock against the front seats, but I found them difficult to move. There are several confusing levers, and all the maneuvers require a lot of muscle. If you don’t want to slide the seats up for third-row access, both also slide side-to-side, opening a larger path between the captain’s chairs. The seats can’t be removed for more storage, however, and nor do they fold into the floor like Chrysler’s magical Stow ‘n Go setup.\n\nThe third row is also roomy; I had more than enough legroom back there, but if you need more the second-row seats can be slid pretty far forward to make room for those in the wayback. By the numbers, the Sedona’s third row is midpack, with 34.8 inches of legroom and 38.9 inches of headroom. The Sienna offers a touch more legroom (36.3) but a bit less headroom (38.3), and the Odyssey’s third row has less headroom (38.0) but a lot more legroom (42.4). The Chrysler twins have the smallest third row in the segment.\n\nJust as important to family happiness as room are features, and here the Sedona doesn’t quite hit the mark. It has a conversation mirror, but it’s uselessly small. The sliding center console in the first row doesn’t slide far enough back to benefit the second row; my 4-year-old’s cupholder stayed irritatingly out of reach. Instead of an entertainment system, my pricey Sedona model had a tablet holder. My Kindle Fire easily slid into the head-restraint-mounted device, but one tablet for three children is not good math. I appreciate the innovation, but a tablet holder is a lot less expensive than an entertainment system and the bottom line should reflect this.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nKia’s UVO touch-screen system is wonderfully simple, and many operations can be done with only a step or two. It reminds me a lot of Chrysler’s Uconnect — another great interface. The UVO screen is large and clear, the touch inputs register quickly, and the swipe functionality has a natural, smartphone-like feel. UVO also includes some interesting services, like a parking-minder: When you turn the ignition off, the vehicle’s location is sent to your smartphone. I was able to pair my phone quickly and easily launch apps like Pandora. The cabin is also optimally set up for device-charging: There are two USB ports in the front row and another in the second row, along with a 115-volt outlet. Behind the third row is another 115-volt outlet as well as a 12-volt one.\n\nThe climate controls are clearly marked and logically laid out below the display screen. Controls for the heated steering wheel and heated seats are within easy reach. Users can also access climate settings via the touch-screen, but that requires drilling down through several menus. The buttons make more sense.\n\nCargo & Storage\nSmall, useful storage spaces abound: The first row’s deep center console has a sliding partition for organizing small items, there’s a convenient two-tiered glove box (the lower section is cooled), all seatbacks have large map pockets (great for storing kids’ books and magazines) and the second row has a couple of storage cubbies for stashing smaller items.\n\nBehind the third row is a deep, uncovered storage well. At 33.9 cubic feet, it’s fairly spacious but falls behind the Sienna (39.1) and Odyssey (38.4). The third-row bench drops into the storage well to create a flat cargo floor, but like the second row, the seat is heavy, and folding it is a clumsy, difficult process.\n\nKia takes the struggle out of loading packages, however, with its optional Smart Tailgate feature. When the van senses the key fob behind the rear bumper for 3 seconds, the liftgate opens automatically — especially useful when your arms are full of stuff.\n\nSafety\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety named the 2015 Sedona a Top Safety Pick, along with the Odyssey; the Toyota Sienna earned the agency’s highest designation, Top Safety Pick Plus. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has not yet tested the Sedona.\n\nInstalling infant and convertible child-safety seats in the Sedona’s second row was easy thanks to plenty of room and exposed Latch anchors; the third row’s recessed buckles, though, made it difficult to install a booster. Click here for the Sedona’s Car Seat Check.\n\nA backup camera is standard on all models except the base L; the Around View Monitor camera system is optional on the top SX Limited trim. Forward collision warning and lane departure warning systems are also optional on SX Limiteds but unavailable on other trims. You can see all the Sedona’s safety features here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe 2015 Kia Sedona starts at $26,795, which is several thousand less than any other minivan except the Dodge Grand Caravan ($22,390). The Sedona, however, is better equipped than the Grand Caravan, with standard features like rear parking sensors, keyless entry and Bluetooth. (All prices include destination charges.)\n\nThe Sedona offers affordable pricing and standout styling and should be attractive to families shopping in the class — but so, too, will be a lot of other vans that have popularity on their side. The Sedona has always been a sales dog; Kia sold just 11,570 of them through November 2014. It’s up against several six-figure sales stars: Chrysler sold a combined 250,230 of the Town & Country and Grand Caravan during that same time period, and Honda (112,370 Odysseys sold through November) and Toyota (112,814 Siennas) are a similar story. The 2015 Sedona is good, but it’s going to take more than good to win over families with a lot of great minivans from which to choose.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in February 2015 about the 2015 Kia Sedona. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2016, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nAs the mom of a preschooler and infant twins, I seldom get excited about anything other than sleep these days. Kia’s redesigned minivan, however, perked me up quicker than an extra-large, double-shot vanilla latte.\n\nThe redesigned 2015 Kia Sedona is a well-executed family-hauler that will keep Mom, Dad and the rug rats comfortable and entertained; while it’s leaps and bounds ahead of its predecessor, though, it doesn’t quite leapfrog its competitors.\n\nThe Sedona was redesigned this year with bolder styling, a new engine and more convenience features; compare the 2014 and 2015 models here. Major players in the class include the Toyota Sienna, Honda Odyssey and a pair of twins: the Chrysler Town & Country and Dodge Grand Caravan. Compare them all here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nApparently, Kia doesn’t know that “minivan” is no longer a dirty word. The automaker says the Sedona wears crossover-like styling and calls it a “midsize multi-purpose vehicle.” Whatever Kia says, there’s no mistaking the Sedona’s identity as a minivan — but it is the best-looking minivan in the segment. The Sedona can’t escape the body style’s chunky, Dustbuster-wedge profile and telltale sliding-door tracks, but up front it’s all style. Its giant, multifaceted grille is studded with plenty of chrome and flanked by sleek LED-accented headlights; the back finishes strongly with a liftgate spoiler. The overall look is smart, aggressive and even — dare I say it? — sporty.\n\nHow It Drives\nLoaded with kids and gear, the Sedona is a confident highway cruiser whose direct-injected, 3.3-liter V-6 engine never felt strained. The 276-horsepower unit performed adequately from a stop, and the six-speed automatic transmission easily delivered more gusto for passing and merging.\n\nA button near the steering wheel engages a fuel-saving Eco mode that dulls accelerator response, but not annoyingly so. In terms of fuel economy, the Sedona is midpack, with an EPA rating of 18/24/20 mpg city/highway/combined, a notch above the Chrysler vans (17/25/20) but trailing the Honda Odyssey (19/28/22).\n\nOn the road, the ride is on the firm side. It took small pavement imperfections in stride but was outmatched by Chicago’s never-ending construction season; larger potholes unleashed a ripple of bumps throughout the cabin. The Sedona handles like the long, hulking van it is, with a lack of agility that’s shared across the class. It leans around corners and floats over bumps, but is easier to park than other vans because it has one of the smallest turning circles in the segment. The optional Around View Monitor camera system also made short work of parking maneuvers with its large screen, multiple-angle views and parking guidelines.\n\nInterior\nThe Sedona can make an impression before you even open the door with its optional and neat Smart Welcome system: It illuminates the door handles and unfolds the side mirrors when the key fob is nearby. Inside, families will find comfortable, nice materials in all three rows — but $43,000 should net you more than “nice”; I expected more wow factor from the top-of-the-line SX Limited model I drove. The front row’s leather seats with contrast stitching look and feel high-quality, but the rest of this trim’s materials fall flat. The multicolored plastic-on-plastic theme is fine, as is the shiny black plastic on the instrument panel, but Kia’s efforts to class things up with a tiny swatch of wood-like trim on the door panels strikes me as cheap. It doesn’t match the rest of the cabin, and if you blink, you’ll miss it.\n\nIt’s easy to find a comfortable driving position in the Sedona thanks to a tall ride height, plenty of head- and legroom, and generous seat travel. Second-row passengers will also enjoy adult-friendly amounts of head- and legroom on plush, comfortable seats. My test model was equipped with lounge-seating captain’s chairs in the second row with pop-out leg rests. This is not a new feature; Toyota offers them in the Sienna, and both there and in the Sedona they feel gimmicky to me. Then again, I’m not a 10-year-old.\n\nGetting back to the Sedona’s third row should be easy thanks to the available Slide-N-Stow second-row seats that fold, slide forward and lock against the front seats, but I found them difficult to move. There are several confusing levers, and all the maneuvers require a lot of muscle. If you don’t want to slide the seats up for third-row access, both also slide side-to-side, opening a larger path between the captain’s chairs. The seats can’t be removed for more storage, however, and nor do they fold into the floor like Chrysler’s magical Stow ‘n Go setup.\n\nThe third row is also roomy; I had more than enough legroom back there, but if you need more the second-row seats can be slid pretty far forward to make room for those in the wayback. By the numbers, the Sedona’s third row is midpack, with 34.8 inches of legroom and 38.9 inches of headroom. The Sienna offers a touch more legroom (36.3) but a bit less headroom (38.3), and the Odyssey’s third row has less headroom (38.0) but a lot more legroom (42.4). The Chrysler twins have the smallest third row in the segment.\n\nJust as important to family happiness as room are features, and here the Sedona doesn’t quite hit the mark. It has a conversation mirror, but it’s uselessly small. The sliding center console in the first row doesn’t slide far enough back to benefit the second row; my 4-year-old’s cupholder stayed irritatingly out of reach. Instead of an entertainment system, my pricey Sedona model had a tablet holder. My Kindle Fire easily slid into the head-restraint-mounted device, but one tablet for three children is not good math. I appreciate the innovation, but a tablet holder is a lot less expensive than an entertainment system and the bottom line should reflect this.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nKia’s UVO touch-screen system is wonderfully simple, and many operations can be done with only a step or two. It reminds me a lot of Chrysler’s Uconnect — another great interface. The UVO screen is large and clear, the touch inputs register quickly, and the swipe functionality has a natural, smartphone-like feel. UVO also includes some interesting services, like a parking-minder: When you turn the ignition off, the vehicle’s location is sent to your smartphone. I was able to pair my phone quickly and easily launch apps like Pandora. The cabin is also optimally set up for device-charging: There are two USB ports in the front row and another in the second row, along with a 115-volt outlet. Behind the third row is another 115-volt outlet as well as a 12-volt one.\n\nThe climate controls are clearly marked and logically laid out below the display screen. Controls for the heated steering wheel and heated seats are within easy reach. Users can also access climate settings via the touch-screen, but that requires drilling down through several menus. The buttons make more sense.\n\nCargo & Storage\nSmall, useful storage spaces abound: The first row’s deep center console has a sliding partition for organizing small items, there’s a convenient two-tiered glove box (the lower section is cooled), all seatbacks have large map pockets (great for storing kids’ books and magazines) and the second row has a couple of storage cubbies for stashing smaller items.\n\nBehind the third row is a deep, uncovered storage well. At 33.9 cubic feet, it’s fairly spacious but falls behind the Sienna (39.1) and Odyssey (38.4). The third-row bench drops into the storage well to create a flat cargo floor, but like the second row, the seat is heavy, and folding it is a clumsy, difficult process.\n\nKia takes the struggle out of loading packages, however, with its optional Smart Tailgate feature. When the van senses the key fob behind the rear bumper for 3 seconds, the liftgate opens automatically — especially useful when your arms are full of stuff.\n\nSafety\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety named the 2015 Sedona a Top Safety Pick, along with the Odyssey; the Toyota Sienna earned the agency’s highest designation, Top Safety Pick Plus. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has not yet tested the Sedona.\n\nInstalling infant and convertible child-safety seats in the Sedona’s second row was easy thanks to plenty of room and exposed Latch anchors; the third row’s recessed buckles, though, made it difficult to install a booster. Click here for the Sedona’s Car Seat Check.\n\nA backup camera is standard on all models except the base L; the Around View Monitor camera system is optional on the top SX Limited trim. Forward collision warning and lane departure warning systems are also optional on SX Limiteds but unavailable on other trims. You can see all the Sedona’s safety features here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe 2015 Kia Sedona starts at $26,795, which is several thousand less than any other minivan except the Dodge Grand Caravan ($22,390). The Sedona, however, is better equipped than the Grand Caravan, with standard features like rear parking sensors, keyless entry and Bluetooth. (All prices include destination charges.)\n\nThe Sedona offers affordable pricing and standout styling and should be attractive to families shopping in the class — but so, too, will be a lot of other vans that have popularity on their side. The Sedona has always been a sales dog; Kia sold just 11,570 of them through November 2014. It’s up against several six-figure sales stars: Chrysler sold a combined 250,230 of the Town & Country and Grand Caravan during that same time period, and Honda (112,370 Odysseys sold through November) and Toyota (112,814 Siennas) are a similar story. The 2015 Sedona is good, but it’s going to take more than good to win over families with a lot of great minivans from which to choose.\n\nemail",
