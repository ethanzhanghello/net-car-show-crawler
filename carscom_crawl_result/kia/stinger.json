      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Kia Stinger?\n\nThe 2023 Kia Stinger is an extroverted mid-size sedan that turns heads thanks to its ground-hugging stance and swept-back roofline. While it’s hardly the newest kid on the block anymore, the Stinger remains an exhilarating, esoteric choice for car shoppers who want performance and upscale style but don’t mind forgoing a fancy luxury label.\n\nA 300-horsepower, turbo 2.5-liter four-cylinder serves as the base powertrain. For many shoppers, this engine’s gusto makes stepping up to the optional 368-hp, twin-turbo V-6 unnecessary. All-wheel drive is available with either engine. The cabin has intuitive controls and a user-friendly infotainment system, but the Stinger’s hunkered-down shape significantly hinders outward visibility.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Kia Stinger?\n\nThe Kia Stinger lineup has been trimmed to two trims: the base GT-Line and the range-topping GT2 (gone is the mid-level GT1). There’s also a trio of uniquely trimmed special editions: Apex, Grand Tourer and Tribute Edition. The limited-production Tribute Edition (just 400 units are destined for the U.S.) serves as a send-off for this slow-selling car: Kia will discontinue the Stinger after the 2023 model year.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Kia Stinger Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n10.2-inch infotainment screen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nNavigation\nSatellite radio\nWireless device charging\nLED headlights\nForward automatic emergency braking\nRear cross-traffic alert\nBlind spot warning system\nRemote start\nLeather seating\nDual-zone climate control\nHeated front seats\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nAll-wheel drive\nHeated steering wheel\nMoonroof\n15-speaker audio system\nUpgraded Brembo brakes\nCarbon-fiber interior trim\nShould I Buy the 2023 Kia Stinger?\n\nWhile the Kia Stinger seems like an indulgence given its relatively steep price and brash styling, this sedan also has a sensible side. Unlike many modern cars and SUVs, the Stinger’s classy cabin includes easy-to-use tactile knobs and buttons, not frustrating touch-sensitive controls, and the rear hatchback and roomy trunk give the Stinger cargo-toting street cred to go along with its invigorating acceleration. Negatives include poor fuel economy, even with the base turbo four-cylinder, and limited visibility due to the car’s low fastback roofline.",

      "expert_review": "The Kia Stinger has now been on sale in the U.S. for five model years, but it remains an unlikely offering from the South Korean automaker. Its four-door coupe styling, hatchback versatility and rear-wheel-drive-based platform mimics four-door coupes from German luxury brands at a fraction of the price. That formula holds for the 2022 Stinger, which gets a more powerful base engine, new tech features and minor exterior and interior styling changes.\n\nRelated: Kia Gives 2022 Stinger More Bite With Extra Power, Style\n\nA new 300-horsepower, turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine is the big news for 2022, and this is the engine we tested. It goes in the GT-Line trim level and is available with rear- or all-wheel drive. Here are five things you should know about Kia’s mid-size performance car if you’re considering it:\n\n1. Exceptional Steering Feel, Responsiveness\n\nThe Stinger’s steering tuning is one of its most impressive attributes. The steering wheel has a natural heft to it, and the car responds immediately as you turn the wheel. The Stinger feels like a sports sedan from the driver’s seat, and its steering is a key reason why.\n\n2. New Turbo Four-Cylinder Is Plenty Powerful\n\nThe new turbo 2.5-liter four-cylinder is an impressive engine, so much so that I didn’t miss the Stinger’s optional 368-hp, twin-turbo 3.3-liter V-6. It has good reserve power for high-speed passing, and it teams with a responsive eight-speed automatic transmission that readily kicks down when you need more power.\n\nThe 2.5-liter four-cylinder’s 300 hp and 311 pounds-feet of torque is 45 hp and 51 pounds-feet more than the outgoing turbo 2.0-liter, but despite the bump in power, EPA-estimated combined gas mileage is the same: 25 mpg for rear-drive versions and 24 mpg with all-wheel drive.\n\n3. Visibility Problems\n\nThe Stinger is long and low, and its fastback roofline makes it look sleeker than the typical mid-size car. The penalty for that look, however, is restricted outward visibility — particularly if you like to drive with the seat in a higher position.\n\nThe car’s raked windshield offers a slotlike view forward, and the rearview mirror can block your view to the point where you sometimes must look around it to fully see what’s in front of you. The low roofline and short side windows reduce visibility, too, and it can feel a bit claustrophobic in the cabin. The rear roof pillars are large, and even though the rear hatch window is big, it’s angled in such a way that it seems much smaller when checking what’s behind you from the driver’s seat.\n\n4. Good Cargo Versatility\n\nThe cargo area under the rear hatch isn’t very tall, but its hatchback body style increases the Stinger’s versatility. The cargo area measures 15.1 cubic feet, according to Cars.com’s cargo measurements, and the standard 60/40-split rear backseat folds nearly flat with the cargo floor when you need more cargo space.\n\n5. Sensible Tech\n\nAll trim levels have a 10.25-inch touchscreen multimedia system that includes navigation, satellite radio capability and Android Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity. It’s an intuitive system that includes physical controls where they make sense, including knobs for volume and station tuning. There aren’t any touch-sensitive controls in the interior aside from the screen, and as more new cars load up on touch controls, the relative simplicity of the Stinger’s buttons, knobs and switches is welcome.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nResearch the 2022 Kia Stinger\nWhat’s New for Kia in 2022?\nWhere Is Kia Made?\nResearch Wagons and Hatchbacks\nShop for a 2022 Kia Stinger\nIs It Worth Nearly $40,000?\n\nThe Stinger GT-Line starts at $37,365 (including $1,075 destination charge), but optional features raised the price of our RWD test car to $39,945. Kia has proven it can sell vehicles at near-luxury prices — witness the success of its Telluride three-row SUV, for example — but convincing luxury shoppers to consider the Stinger (or mainstream buyers to stay with Kia rather than move up to a luxury brand) is a tall order. That, along with dwindling interest in cars in general versus trucks and SUVs, is borne out in the Stinger’s modest sales of 13,517 for all of 2021.\n\nThat said, you can spend more than the as-tested price of our Stinger on cars from luxury brands that are less enjoyable to drive and less versatile. That doesn’t seem like a great idea, and it makes a Stinger test drive all the more worthwhile.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Kia Stinger?\n\nThe 2020 Kia Stinger is a five-seat mid-size hatchback with coupelike styling. It’s powered by a standard 255-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine or an optional 365-hp, twin-turbo 3.3-liter V-6. Both engines work with an eight-speed automatic transmission, and rear- and all-wheel-drive versions are offered. Competitors include the Alfa Romeo Giulia and Audi S4. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Kia Stinger?\n\nA new GT-Line trim level replaces last year’s base trim and adds a unique grille treatment, black chrome exterior accents, special bumpers, a flat-bottom steering wheel, a black headliner and metal pedals. A wireless device charger is also standard. \n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Kia Stinger Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include 18-inch alloy wheels; LED daytime running lights and taillights; leather upholstery; heated front seats; a 60/40-split, folding backseat; dual-zone automatic air conditioning; a 7-inch touchscreen multimedia system; Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity; and push-button start. Upscale available features include a power liftgate, Nappa leather upholstery, ventilated front seats, navigation, a Harman Kardon premium stereo, a head-up display and a 360-degree camera system. \n\nAvailable active safety features include forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, lane keep assist, a driver drowsiness monitor, and adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability. \n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Kia Stinger?\n\nThe Stinger aims to emulate the style and performance of the sleek, coupelike four-doors sold by some luxury automakers — but for a fraction of the price. The performance of its V-6 engine and easy-to-use technology are highlights, though its swoopy design hurts visibility.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2021 Kia Stinger?\n\nThe Kia Stinger is a five-seat mid-size hatchback with aggressive coupelike styling. It’s powered by a standard 255-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine or an optional 365-hp, twin-turbo 3.3-liter V-6. Both engines work with an eight-speed automatic transmission, and rear- and all-wheel-drive versions are offered. Competitors include the Alfa Romeo Giulia, Audi A4 and Genesis G70.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2021 Kia Stinger?\n\nThere are no significant changes this year. \n\nWhat Features in the 2021 Kia Stinger Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n18-inch alloy wheels\nLeather seating surfaces\nHeated front seats\n7-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nWireless device charging\nDual-zone automatic air conditioning\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nNappa leather upholstery\nVentilated front seats\nHeated rear seats\nNavigation with 8-inch touchscreen\nHarman Kardon premium stereo\n360-degree camera system\nHead-up display\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane-keeping assist\nAdaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability\nShould I Buy the 2021 Kia Stinger?\n\nThe Stinger mimics the style and performance of sedans from dedicated luxury brands — but for a fraction of the price. The performance of its optional V-6 engine, roomy cargo area and easy-to-use multimedia system are highlights, but the car’s swoopy design hurts outward visibility.",
