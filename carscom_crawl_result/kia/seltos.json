      "expert_review": "Kia has staked a strong claim among big three-row SUVs with the new Telluride’s traditional SUV looks and smart tech. Now the brand is aiming for similar looks-and-brains chemistry in a subcompact SUV with the 2021 Seltos. Doing it smaller and cheaper is harder, and the Seltos makes more compromises, but it works.\n\nRelated: 2021 Kia Seltos Boasts Competitive Fuel Economy Ratings\n\nThe Seltos is a “tweener” in size, much like the new Mazda CX-30 and the Nissan Rogue Sport. It’s bigger than many subcompacts — about 8 inches longer and roomier than the corporate cousin Hyundai Kona. In the Kia stable, it’s about the same height and width, but nearly 7 inches longer than the Soul hatchback — and only 4.4 inches shorter than the Sportage compact SUV.\n\nBeyond size, two things distinguish the Seltos from most rivals: All Seltos trim levels but one have standard all-wheel drive, and it offers an optional engine upgrade. Also unusual, Seltos offers two base trim levels at the same $23,110 starting price with destination: an LX with limited features and all-wheel drive or an S with more goodies but front-wheel drive. Moving up is the S 1.6T with a more powerful turbo engine option, then the fancier EX with the base engine. On top is the SX, with both the turbo and exclusive sophisticated tech — and a starting price of $29,010 that tests the limits of what people will spend for a subcompact, even if it’s a larger one.\n\nI tested the Seltos at a Kia event on city, highway and rural roads around San Antonio (per our ethics policy, Cars.com pays its travel and lodging expenses for such automaker events). I drove a top-level SX but also was able to check out a base-level S.\n\nCars.com photo by Fred Meier\nTelluride Looks\n\nThe Seltos makes a good first impression. It looks substantial and not cheap even at base levels. Like the Telluride, it has a traditional SUV profile and upscale details, including interesting diamond-texture trim around the grille. It doesn’t try too hard, though there is a lot happening on the front end with trim, sculpting and lighting assemblies. There’s also a hint of the stylish Volvo XC40 in the short clamshell hood, back pillar, and the contrast black or white roof option. A note on the two-tone roof: Production issues mean that at least initially you can have the contrast roof ($345) or a moonroof ($700), but not both.\n\nRoomy Interior, Subcompact Quality\n\nThe interior design is nicely done, but the materials include a lot of grained plastic, including at touch points such as the tops of the doors. Armrests are well cushioned, however, and the SX includes softer-touch surfaces on the front of the dash and in the door panels. That’s not true on the rear doors, however, as materials drop off a bit in the back. While LX seats are all cloth, the S attractively mixes cloth with stitched Sofino (Kia’s imitation leather) trim; higher models  get full Sofino upholstery.\n\n2021 Kia Seltos SX | Cars.com photo by Fred Meier\n\nThe front cabin feels as roomy as some compact SUVs, and the seats are supportive if not overly cushy. In a plus for being a “tweener,” the backseat has more than subcompact room; I could sit behind myself (6-foot-2) with adequate leg and toe room and headroom. Backseat comfort is enhanced by a reclining seatback, but the padding on the seat feels a bit thin. The top two trim levels add a rear USB port and air vents.\n\nOddly, there is only single-zone climate control available — and only on the top two trim levels. But a shout-out for three-stage front-seat heaters (optional or standard on all but the LX) that  are effective and controllable — not to mention much appreciated on a cold, damp day in South Texas.\n\nThe Seltos cabin is not as quiet as some rivals, with wind noise around the mirrors (it was a windy day) and a lot of highway tire noise, at least with the 18-inch wheels and 235/45 tires that are standard on turbo models. The cabin is otherwise quiet and engine noise does not intrude even when pushed.\n\nCargo space also is above the subcompact average — 26.6 cubic feet behind the backseat with the two-level load floor in its lower position and 62.8 with the 60/40-split rear seatbacks folded (both are slightly more than the Soul and significantly more than the Kona). Cabin storage is more limited, with a modest center console bin and an open bin at the front of the console with USB and 12-volt ports. A handy detail, however, is a phone shelf above that bin that the EX and SX equip with a wireless charging pad.\n\n2021 Kia Seltos SX | Cars.com photo by Fred Meier\nUpscale Tech\n\nThe tech showpiece — as in the Telluride — is a 10.25-inch touchscreen in the SX powered by Kia’s UVO multimedia and connectivity system that I like a lot. It sits high on the dashboard with a good sightline that’s still close enough for easy touch. It has navigation, impressive graphics, simple menus, and essential physical knobs and shortcut buttons. It makes effective use of all that real estate with a well-designed split screen that allows easy content switching. And the SX pairs it with Bose premium audio.\n\nQuirky surprise: The SX multimedia system also offers soothing “sounds of nature.” Pick from a forest, sea waves, a rainy day, a cafe or a fireplace, and the screen shows a tranquil animated visual and restful sounds play. Just the thing when road rage bubbles up.\n\n2021 Kia Seltos SX | Cars.com photo by Fred Meier\n\nThe SX trim level’s system looks great, but other trim levels get a not-shabby 8-inch touchscreen in the same location with knobs, shortcut buttons and easy smartphone integration. The SX also gets a colorful 7-inch information display between the analog dials; others make do with a more typical 3.5-inch screen.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThe base 146-horsepower four-cylinder is mated to the continuously variable automatic transmission first seen in Kia’s redone Forte sedan. The power should be adequate for most buyers and the CVT is one of the better behaved of its ilk, with diminished droning and electronic management to adapt its shift logic to the driver and conditions.\n\n2021 Kia Seltos S | Cars.com photo by Fred Meier\n\nThe optional engine is a 175-hp version of Kia’s turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder mated to a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic. I enjoyed the extra power (who doesn’t?) but found it hard to drive smoothly. The turbo lags a beat or two from a start, then kicks in with force faster than you can back off. And the seven-speed had occasional lapses on downshifts, sometimes hesitating even at partial throttle and, when pressed harder, pulling two pronounced downshifts to find the appropriate gear. I’ve had the same issues in other Hyundais and Kias — in the Soul, for example, with the seven-speed and 1.6-liter (in 201-hp tune) — so I was not surprised but still disappointed.\n\nManual control via the lever (Seltos does not offer paddles) helped, as did the Sport driving mode — but it was never really smooth. The Smart driving mode was perhaps best for general driving, varying between Sport and Normal as called for by conditions. The base powertrain might better suit many buyers.\n\n2021 Kia Seltos SX | Cars.com photo by Fred Meier\n\nBeyond the powertrain, the chassis is rigid and body roll is well controlled, and all the AWD models benefit from a fully independent multilink rear suspension (the front-wheel-drive S has a semi-independent torsion beam). The torque-vectoring AWD is more robust than many subcompact systems and was effective in shifting power for cornering. The steering also is quick and precise, though way too light and numb to offer much feedback.\n\nThe AWD system also includes a locking centering differential and hill descent control. Both are suitable for as much soft-roading as you’d want to tackle with 7.3 inches of ground clearance and only decorative “skid plates.” But it ably handled a short off-road course that light rain turned to slick mud.\n\n2021 Kia Seltos SX | Cars.com photo by Fred Meier\nSafety Tech Not Across the Board\n\nSafety tech on the Seltos LX does not include a front collision system with automatic braking. Such a system with pedestrian detection is on all other Seltos trim levels, and the SX adds a more sophisticated system that also can detect bicycles. Standard driver assistance tech from the S model up also includes lane departure warning, lane-keeping steering assist and automatic high beams. The S 1.6T and up get a blind spot monitor with rear cross-traffic alert and automatic reverse braking. The SX offers adaptive cruise control that is quick to resume speed and works down to stop along with an effective lane-centering system.\n\nValue at Both Ends\n\nThe Seltos is a compelling value at each trim level with above-average space, standard features and available options, as well as a generous warranty of up to 10 years/100,000 miles on the powertrain. Unless you really need AWD, the base S with FWD is a better entry value in looks and features — and at the other end, if you want most of the room and smart tech of an SUV a size class larger, the SX offers that at a cheaper price.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Kia Seltos?\n\nThe 2023 Kia Seltos is a five-seat subcompact SUV that comes with a surprising number of features for a vehicle its price. This includes a number of active safety features, not to mention a user-friendly 8-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility. The Seltos’ small size makes it a cinch to navigate in city traffic and tight parking spots. The base 146-horsepower four-cylinder is fuel-efficient but offers modest performance, while a 175-hp, turbocharged four-cylinder is optional.  All-wheel drive is standard on all but one of the Seltos’ five trims. Rivals include the Honda HR-V, Hyundai Venue, Chevrolet Trailblazer and Mazda CX-30.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Kia Seltos?\n\nAll Seltos trims get a new acoustic-glass windshield aimed at reducing wind noise, and the S trim level gains a standard blind spot warning system with rear cross-traffic alert.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Kia Seltos Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n8-inch touchscreen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nSix-speaker stereo\n60/40 split-folding backseat\nAutomatic emergency braking\nDriver attention monitor\nKeyless entry\nPedestrian detection\nBluetooth\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n10.25-inch touchscreen\nHeated front seats\nNavigation\nSatellite radio\nPower-adjustable driver’s seat\nWireless smartphone charging\nImitation leather seating\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nLED headlights\nMoonroof\nShould I Buy the 2023 Kia Seltos?\n\nThe 2023 Kia Seltos is affordable, good on gas, and delivers plenty of passenger and cargo space given its tidy dimensions. AWD is standard on most trims, and the turbo engine adds a little more oomph if passing power is a priority. It’s also worth pointing out the Seltos has an extremely user-friendly infotainment system that takes only moments to master.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Kia Seltos?\n\nThe Kia Seltos is a five-seat subcompact SUV that offers excellent cargo space and a surprising number of upscale features for its class. The base 146-horsepower four-cylinder is fuel-efficient but offers modest performance, while an available 195-hp turbocharged four-cylinder engine (standard on X-Line and SX trims) is one of the strongest engines in the segment. All-wheel drive is standard on all but the S and EX trims, which come standard with front-wheel drive but offer AWD as an option. The Seltos’ rivals include the Chevrolet Trailblazer, Honda HR-V, Hyundai Kona, Mazda CX-30, Subaru Crosstrek and Toyota Corolla Cross. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Kia Seltos?\n\nThe Seltos gets only minor updates for 2025 after a refresh last year. Every 2025 Seltos receives improved interior materials for a more upscale feel, and several features are now either newly available or included on more affordable trim levels than before. The S trim level now rolls on standard two-tone 17-inch wheels and features a 4.3-inch screen in its gauge cluster. EX and SX trims get newly standard rear parking sensors, while AWD versions of those trims also get a power liftgate.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Kia Seltos Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n8-inch touchscreen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nSix-speaker stereo\nAutomatic climate control\n60/40-split folding backseat\nAutomatic emergency braking\nDriver attention monitor\nLane-centering steering\nLane departure steering assist\nKeyless entry\nPedestrian detection\nBluetooth\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n10.25-inch touchscreen\nHeated front seats \nVentilated front seats\nNavigation\nEight-speaker audio with subwoofer\nPower-adjustable driver’s seat\nWireless smartphone charging\nHands-free power liftgate\nSynthetic leather seating\nBlind spot warning\nSafe exit assist\nRear cross-traffic alert\nMoonroof\nShould I Buy the 2025 Kia Seltos?\n\nThe Kia Seltos delivers plenty of passenger and cargo space given its tidy dimensions, and it’s available with a large selection of luxury and safety features. AWD is standard on most trims, and the turbo engine adds a little more oomph — albeit with a fuel-economy penalty — if passing power is a priority. The ride can feel firm on less-than-perfect roads, but it improves handling in curves. It’s also worth pointing out the Seltos has an extremely user-friendly infotainment system that takes only moments to master.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2024 Kia Seltos improves upon an already winning formula by pairing its available turbocharged engine with a smoother, more traditional automatic transmission in place of the old dual-clutch automatic, while continuing to offer an impressive mix of useful features and high-quality materials; unfortunately, some modern conveniences are still conspicuously absent.\n\nVersus the competition: Already the benchmark in a growing segment of small, affordable SUVs, the 2024 Seltos continues to lead the way — it won our latest comparison in its class — but its performance, price and fuel efficiency might have it facing off with larger SUVs, too.\n\nThe Kia Seltos has been a favorite of ours since its debut as a 2021 model. For 2024, it gets revised exterior styling, a new X-Line trim level with a more rugged appearance, and available dual 10.25-inch displays in most trims. Its available turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine also gets a healthy 20-horsepower boost, for a total of 195 hp, and now pairs with a traditional eight-speed automatic transmission instead of the previous dual-clutch automatic.\n\nRelated: What’s the Best Affordable SUV of 2023?\n\nThe 2021 Seltos won our comparison of four affordable small SUVs back in 2020. Given how much the subcompact SUV class has grown since then, we felt the time was ripe to see if the 2024 Seltos could repeat its victory, or if its competition had caught up or even surpassed it.\n\nFor both this review and the larger comparison test, we drove a 2024 Seltos SX, which brings the optional turbo 1.6-liter engine. It had an as-tested price of $33,085 (prices include destination). Be sure to check out the full comparison to see how the Seltos fared, along with the other five SUVs we tested.\n\nDrives Like Something Nicer\n\nIn a segment of low-powered glorified hatchbacks — often plagued by noisy continuously variable automatic transmissions — the Seltos SX is a breath of fresh, compressed air. Powered by its 195-hp, turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine, it’s quick for what it is. Some passing maneuvers and merges may require some finesse and forethought, but tasks like crossing busy roads are much less harrowing in this Kia than they are in many competitors.\n\nWith its new eight-speed automatic transmission, the SX’s driving experience is much smoother and more pleasant than before, with shifts that are adequately quick and crisp. The eight-speed replaces a dual-clutch automatic transmission that we often found clunky and aggravating, particularly at low speeds. There is some hesitancy in the powertrain when driving around town (the Seltos was only third-quickest from 0-30 mph in our testing), but power picks up quickly at higher speeds. The Seltos was the quickest in our 0-60 mph test, just beating the Toyota Corolla Cross Hybrid with a time of 7.82 seconds.\n\nSteering, handling and braking are all impressive for the class, but the Seltos is not without issues. There’s some body roll in corners, and its ride quality is on the firm side, though it stays composed over road imperfections and bumps. In our comparison test, only the cushy Subaru Crosstrek was more comfortable.\n\nAs buttoned up as its driving dynamics are, what’s most impressive about driving the Seltos is how quiet it is given how much it costs. This interior quietness adds to the Seltos’ near-premium feel, and it combines with the vehicle’s impressive dynamics to create the sense that you’re driving something nicer than an affordable small SUV — which, in turn, makes the Seltos feel like an even better value.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nThe glaring issue with this powertrain is its fuel economy. The turbo 1.6-liter engine earned an EPA rating of just 25/27/26 mpg city/highway/combined, which is on the low side for its class. In the fuel-economy testing we conducted as part of our comparison test, the Seltos SX trailed every other vehicle in the field, but it did exceed its combined mpg rating; we observed an average of 28.4 mpg. It’s not an apples-to-apples comparison, but if you plugged the Seltos into the fuel-economy testing we conducted when comparing larger compact SUVs, the turbo Seltos would’ve still only managed a fourth-place finish.\n\nThe Seltos’ base engine is a 2.0-liter four-cylinder that pairs with a continuously variable automatic transmission. That combination earns an EPA rating as high as 31 mpg combined with front-wheel drive, but if you want all the best amenities the Seltos offers, you’ll have to choose the turbo powertrain. And while I did just sing the turbo’s praises, it’d be nice if Kia didn’t link certain features to a single powertrain.\n\nHigh-Quality Interior (With Some Curious Omissions)\n\nUpgrades inside the 2024 Seltos include an available pair of 10.25-inch displays, one acting as the instrument panel and the other a central touchscreen. We’ve seen this setup in other Kias, and it’s just as excellent here as it is in those. The graphics are clear and crisp and the controls are intuitive.\n\nInterior materials are also class-leading. There’s still a good amount of the expected plastic and hard surfaces in the interior, but there’s also high-quality faux-leather upholstery and trim that looked especially stylish with our test vehicle’s no-cost optional brown interior package.\n\nThe Seltos is also comfortably roomy for its class. At 6-foot-1, I would prefer more backseat legroom — and would probably prefer to be up front on longer trips — but I could make do. Headroom is acceptable front and rear, and the beltline is low enough that the backseat doesn’t feel claustrophobic. Rear cargo space is also excellent, at 17.4 cubic feet of space by our measurements. That was second only to the Volkswagen Taos’ 17.5 cubic feet in our comparison test.\n\nUnexpected features for this class also help the Seltos shine. Not only did the SX have the only power liftgate in our comparison test, it also had hands-free operation for added convenience. The Seltos SX was also the only vehicle in our comparison test with ventilated front seats, which is a welcome feature for those in warmer climes.\n\nSome features, however, are nowhere to be found, and their absence is noticeable. For one, the Seltos is not available with a heated steering wheel — a valuable feature in cold weather and something multiple competitors offer. And while our test vehicle did have automatic climate control, it did not have multiple zones; the driver and front passenger had better be good at compromise. And we’d be remiss if we didn’t point out that the Seltos SX’s Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity works only via a wired connection; the other five SUVs in our test all had wireless connectivity.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2023 Affordable SUV Challenge: The Kia Seltos Takes the Crown Again\nUp Close With the 2024 Kia Seltos: Subtle Corrections\n2024 Kia Seltos Brings More Power, Fresh Face, X-Line to L.A.\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2024 Kia Seltos?\nKia Announces 2024 Seltos Pricing, Starts at $25,715\nWorth the High Price or Should You Consider Something Bigger?\n\nI have to admit, I was concerned about the Seltos’ high price relative to its competitors in our comparison test; it was nearly $2,500 more than the next priciest entrant. Yet even with its missing features, it was otherwise so well equipped that it tied for first in our value score. With an abundance of features and a relatively luxurious driving experience, the Seltos SX should be top of mind for shoppers willing to spend a little extra on a small SUV.\n\nThat said, where I really struggle with the loaded Seltos SX we drove is that its $33,085 as-tested price pushes it from the subcompact SUV class into the realm of larger compact SUVs. A similarly priced compact SUV will likely be less well equipped than this Seltos, but it will be roomier and it might be more efficient — especially if it’s a hybrid. Given the Seltos’ middling scores in our Car Seat Check, it also might not make as much sense if you have a growing family.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Kia’s Seltos, a small, affordable SUV — and the reigning winner in our comparison of the class — is getting a modest but important update for the 2022 model year. Advanced safety technology is now standard on all trim levels; this includes automatic forward emergency braking with pedestrian detection, lane departure warning, lane-keeping assist, lane-centering steering and automatic high beams. For 2021, the Seltos did not offer these features on the base model, called the LX.\n\nRelated: What’s the Best Affordable Small SUV?\n\nThe newly standard safety tech might increase the Seltos LX’s appeal to safety-minded shoppers, but Kia also created a new Nightfall Edition trim for those interested in the popular blacked-out aesthetic. Taking the place of the S Turbo in the Seltos lineup, the Nightfall Edition gets a turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine, matte-black 18-inch wheels, a black grille and what Kia calls “rugged” roof rails and side sills.\n\nMore Changes\n\nSeltos S models now come with a 10.25-inch touchscreen display that was previously only available on the SX; they also gain automatic climate control and remote start. Also new for 2022 is a Plum interior color scheme for the SX, which gets a flat-bottom steering wheel as well.\n\nHigher Prices\n\nFeatures aren’t the only changes to the 2022 Seltos, as the updates accompany corresponding price increases for almost every trim level. All prices below include a destination fee of $1,175, which hasn’t changed from the previous model year. The LX, S and EX are all powered by a 146-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, while the Nightfall and SX have the turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder, which makes 175 hp.\n\n2022 Seltos LX AWD: $23,665 ($500 increase)\n2022 Seltos S FWD: $23,865 ($700 increase)\n2022 Seltos S AWD: $25,365 ($600 increase)\n2022 Seltos EX AWD: $26,965 ($400 increase)\n2022 Seltos Nightfall Edition AWD: $27,865 ($1,100 increase over 2021 S Turbo AWD)\n2022 Seltos SX AWD: $29,165 (no increase)\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "A two-time winner in our Affordable SUV Challenge, the Kia Seltos combines upscale interior design, expertly balanced ride and handling, and a generous list of standard equipment at a budget-friendly price. Kia freshened the small SUV for the 2024 model year with updated styling and more power from the optional turbocharged engine. For 2026, the big news is that the black-trimmed X-Line is dropped. The base LX trim is $1,000 cheaper than it was for 2025, while the rest of the lineup starts $200 higher. The 2025 Kia Seltos starts at $25,085 (all prices include $1,395 destination charge).\n\nRelated: Is the 2024 Kia Seltos a Good SUV? 5 Pros, 3 Cons\n\nRelease Date and Pricing\n\nThe 2026 Kia Seltos will go on sale later in 2025. Full pricing is as follows:\n\nLX: $25,085\nS: $26,785\nEX: $27,785\nSX: $32,785\nWhat Are the 2026 Kia Seltos’ Trim Levels?\n\nBeyond the fundamental appeal of a spacious and efficient small SUV, the entry-level Seltos LX is rather basic. It rides on 17-inch wheels, and a rear spoiler with an LED stop light is its one notable exterior feature. Inside are cloth upholstery, manually adjustable front seats, six speakers, and an 8-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.\n\nSafety technology is where the Seltos distinguishes itself from other similarly priced vehicles. Forward collision warning and automatic emergency braking are standard on many such cars and SUVs, but the Seltos also features pedestrian and bicyclist detection. Other standard driver assists include lane departure warning, lane departure steering assist, lane-centering steering, a driver-attention monitor and automatic high beams.\n\nThe S trim level sports LED daytime running lights, heated side mirrors, roof rails, and keyless entry and start. Its seats are upholstered in a blend of cloth and synthetic leather, and it gains automatic climate control and a larger touchscreen that includes navigation and measures 10.25 inches. Blind spot monitors and rear cross-traffic alert with automatic braking join the standard-equipment list for the Seltos S.\n\nSatin-chrome exterior trim helps identify the EX, which also features full synthetic leather upholstery, heated front seats (power-adjustable for the driver), a 10.25-inch digital instrument cluster and wireless device charging.\n\nOnly available with a powerful turbocharged engine and AWD, the Seltos SX rides on 18-inch wheels and features LED headlights, a hands-free power liftgate, a flat-bottom steering wheel and an eight-speaker Bose sound system. The SX also gains adaptive cruise control, front cross-traffic alert and Kia’s Highway Driving Assist, which integrates the adaptive cruise and lane-centering steering systems to help maintain the driver’s position in lane on the highway.\n\nWhat Are the 2026 Kia Seltos’ Powertrain Specs and MPG?\n\nThe LX, S and EX are powered by a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that makes 147 horsepower and 132 pounds-feet of torque and is coupled with a continuously variable automatic transmission. Front-wheel drive is standard with the 2.0-liter, and AWD is optional.\n\nAWD costs more on the pricier trim levels; it adds $1,200 on the LX, $1,500 on the S and $2,200 on the EX; it is standard on SX. AWD models are also equipped with a more sophisticated multilink rear suspension for greater ride comfort and improved handling. With the 2.0-liter, the front-drive Seltos should return the same EPA-rated 28/34/31 mpg city/highway/combined as the 2025 model; the AWD model is rated at 27/31/29 mpg (official EPA ratings for the 2026 model are not yet available).\n\nThe range-topping Seltos SX is only available with a 190-hp, turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder good for 195 pounds-feet of torque. It is paired with an eight-speed automatic and standard AWD, and it returns 24/27/25 mpg.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2024 Kia Seltos Review: Better Than Ever\nHere Are the 10 Cheapest New SUVs You Can Buy Right Now\n2023 Affordable SUV Challenge: Which SUV Has the Most Cargo Space?\nResearch the Kia Seltos\nFind Your Next Car\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
