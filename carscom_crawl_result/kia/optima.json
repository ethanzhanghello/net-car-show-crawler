      "expert_review": "The verdict: The Kia Optima overcomes a hit-and-miss driving experience with value galore, especially now that Kia has added much-needed standard safety features for 2019.\n\nVersus the competition: Even in a dwindling crowd of mid-size sedans, the Optima faces stiff competition in the form of redesigns from its Japanese rivals, none of which it beats for overall refinement. Still, it’s hard to beat Kia’s value proposition.\n\nAs we explain in our Optima video, mid-size sedan popularity has collapsed in recent years, even as major competitors like the Honda Accord, Nissan Altima and Toyota Camry sport fresh redesigns (compare them here). For 2019, the Optima is midway through its fourth generation, but Kia has issued a raft of updates (read more about them here), including some much-needed additions on the safety and driver assist front. We evaluated the highest of four trim levels, the SX Turbo. Stack up the trims for the 2019 Optima here, or compare the 2019 and 2018 Optimas here.\n\nOne last bit of housekeeping: We cover the related Optima Hybrid and Optima Plug-in Hybrid separately in our Research section. Compare them with the non-hybrid Optima here.\n\nGot it? Onward.\n\nMiddling Powertrains\n\nThe SX Turbo is powered by the Optima’s top available engine, a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder (245 horsepower, 260 pounds-feet of torque). That’s become a common size in this class — six other mid-size sedans also offer a turbo 2.0-liter — but not all examples are equal, and Kia’s underwhelms. Step on the gas from a stop and the Optima SX has a bit of old-school turbo lag: Power can take a few moments to show up, and it’s comparatively modest even at full bore versus competitors like the quick-revving Accord 2.0T and the potent Camry V-6.\n\nA six-speed automatic transmission (standard on the Optima SX) downshifts with respectable haste when you need passing power, but a couple of more gears and the faster revving they would bring could make the most of this engine. I don’t call for that lightly — more gears often introduces hunting and kickdown delay — but the Optima’s platform sibling, the Hyundai Sonata, successfully upgraded to a responsive new eight-speed automatic one model year ago. (Hyundai and Kia are affiliated automakers.) It’s unfortunate the Optima did not.\n\nMost variants get a 2.4-liter four-cylinder (185 hp, 178 pounds-feet of torque), which also pairs with a six-speed automatic. Though we haven’t evaluated it recently, the same drivetrain in the Sonata is adequate but uninspiring, which stands in contrast to the improbably good base drivetrains of the Accord and Camry.\n\nHigher up the Optima’s trim ladder, there’s an available turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder (178 hp but just 195 pounds-feet of torque) that teams with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic. It fared well in our earlier evaluations of the current-generation Optima and makes for the best Optima in terms of gas mileage (excluding the hybrid): 31 mpg combined in EPA estimates versus ratings in the mid- to high-20s for other drivetrains. Still, if mileage is paramount, even the 1.6-liter Optima narrowly trails its most efficient competitors.\n\nRide and Handling\n\nSX models pair low-profile tires and the Optima’s largest available wheels (18-inchers, versus 16s or 17s elsewhere) with a sport-tuned suspension. The results are, I suspect, too firm for most shoppers in this class: High-speed isolation is OK, but the suspension jostles the cabin over rapid elevation changes and responds harshly to highway expansion joints. The overall experience evokes the Altima, another firm-riding car.\n\nIn exchange for that, the SX changes direction reasonably quickly, with limited body roll, and the Kumho Solus tires on our test car provided fairly good grip in sweeping corners before the nose eventually pushed. It’s fun enough, but it doesn’t distinguish itself in a field of rivals — the Accord and Camry in particular — that strike a better ride/handling balance.\n\nFortunately, the Optima’s three other trim levels have normal suspension tuning, and two of them pair that with smaller wheels and higher-profile tires. Those differences should improve ride comfort, so compare a few of them on your test drives. It’s worth noting that a few years back, a 1.6-liter Optima with smaller wheels drew praise from Cars.com editors for its ride comfort.\n\nThe Inside\n\nChanged minimally since the current generation debuted in late 2015, the Optima’s interior features a towering monolith of a dashboard and lots of simple, trim-free expanses. Most cabin materials are soft-touch where they need to be, but the design lacks much inspiration — and it doesn’t live up to the prior generation’s eye-catching dashboard, which helped it earn our highest award at the time.\n\nStill, the 2019 Optima boasts comfortable seats with good adjustment range up front, plus decent front and rear headroom even with our test car’s panoramic moonroof. All trims get a standard height-adjustable passenger seat — something no Accord or Altima offers. The center console houses two sizable cubbies ahead of the cupholders, which is one more than what most competitors give you. The standard 8-inch touchscreen has straightforward menus and all the essential physical controls, including volume and tuning knobs. You’d be surprised how many cars botch such basics.\n\nFeatures and Value\n\nAutomatic emergency braking, a critical safety feature that’s widely standard among competitors, was only an option on top trim levels of the Optima last year. Kia wisely made it standard for 2019, along with an array of driver assist features, including stop-and-go adaptive cruise control, automatic high-beam headlights, blind spot detection and, above 40 mph or so, lane-centering steering. (Like Hyundai, Kia won’t call it lane centering, but in our experience it can do just that when programmed for maximum intervention.) For around $24,000 including destination — about $1,000 less than a 2019 Accord, Altima or Camry — the Optima comes standard with all of that, plus Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and Kia’s class-leading warranty.\n\nCheck all the boxes and you can get Nappa leather upholstery, power-adjustable seats with heating and cooling up front, heated rear seats, keyless access, Harman Kardon premium audio and the panoramic roof. Loaded up thus, the Optima will set you back some $37,000.\n\nStrong crash-test ratings bolster the Optima’s case: The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety rates the halogen headlights on most trims poorly, but the well-rated LED headlights on the SX earn it a Top Safety Pick Plus designation. All trims get strong scores in the agency’s new passenger-side small overlap test.\n\nFresher rivals are all-around better cars, to be sure, but the Optima’s value proposition should land it enough shoppers to keep it relevant. The relative deficits mount as you climb the trim levels, and any mid-$30,000s Optima begs spending your money elsewhere. But most Optima shoppers aren’t buying such cars: As of this writing, 90 percent of Optima inventory on Cars.com is listed below $30,000. That’s where Kia makes a sound case.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

The Optima’s styling differed from the Sonata, but the two models shared engines and other major components.\n\nA new grille goes on 2004 Optima models, which can be fitted with restyled 16-inch alloy wheels. What was previously the SE trim level is now called EX. The Optima comes with either a four-cylinder or V-6 engine, and a Sportmatic automatic transmission is available.\n\nKia is owned by Hyundai � South Korea’s largest automaker � but the companies maintain totally separate brand identities and dealer networks. Warranties cover the entire vehicle for five years/60,000 miles and major powertrain components for 10 years/100,000 miles.\n\nExterior\nEven though Kia borrowed some styling touches from the Sonata and the two share some major components, the Optima has a unique nose and grille, which is the main visible difference between the two cars. Both vehicles have a 106.3-inch wheelbase, but at 185.8 inches long overall, the Optima is a tad shorter than the Sonata and several inches shorter than the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry.\n\nInterior\nFront bucket seats and a three-place rear bench allow the Optima to seat five people. A folding rear seat expands maximum cargo space beyond the trunk’s 13.6-cubic-foot capacity. The rear armrest offers additional storage space.\n\nStandard equipment for the base LX model includes air conditioning, a CD stereo, and power windows, locks and mirrors. The EX sedan adds a power moonroof, remote keyless entry, cruise control, and a stereo system with cassette and CD players, among other features. An eight-way power driver’s seat in the EX includes lumbar support.\n\nUnder the Hood\nBoth the LX and EX are offered with a choice of engines: a 138-horsepower, 2.4-liter four-cylinder or a 170-hp, 2.7-liter V-6. A four-cylinder LX sedan may be equipped with either a four-speed-automatic or five-speed-manual transmission. Other models are available only with the automatic unit, which incorporates adaptive logic and a provision for manually selected gear changes.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes are optional on models equipped with the V-6 engine. Side-impact airbags are standard, which places Kia ahead of some competitors.\n\nDriving Impressions\nA smooth, easygoing ride leads the list of merits in the Optima, which glides neatly over moderate bumps without transmitting much commotion to occupants. But rougher surfaces begin to impair its composure. The Optima is easy to maneuver and offers excellent stability on the highway. Acceleration with the V-6 engine reaches well beyond adequate, and the automatic transmission responds well, even though an abrupt downshift can occasionally occur at lower speeds.\n\nThe Optima’s seats are somewhat firm but still comfortable. All told, few faults come to mind after a lengthy drive. In overall competence, Kia’s midsize model comes surprisingly close to the level of the Accord and Camry. Throw in its modest price, and the Optima serves as an appealing contender.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in November 2015 about the 2016 Kia Optima, but little else of substance has changed. To see what’s new for 2017, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe newly redesigned 2016 Kia Optima, with its blend of driving dynamics and a well-thought-out interior, remains competitive in the absolutely cutthroat midsize sedan field.\n\nThe redesigned Optima’s major improvements are under the skin: chassis tuning and an additional engine offering. For a newly redesigned car, though, the 2016 Optima doesn’t look hugely different from the previous year’s car. You can run through the rest of the changes here.\n\nI drove a 2016 Kia Optima SXL for several hours around Aspen, Colo., over the Continental Divide and through Vail on a mix of winding mountain roads and interstate highway stretches. The Optima competes with the Ford Fusion, Honda Accord and Nissan Altima, among others, in the midsize sedan class.\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nPark a 2016 Optima next to the 2015 model, and it’s not glaringly obvious what the differences are. This isn’t bad, though, because I thought the previous Optima was a good-looking, if understated, car.\n\nThe grille finishes are different on the 2016, and they vary depending on trim. The SXL I tested had a satin finish; other trims get a black grille. Sharper-eyed observers will note that the new Optima has slightly different dimensions: The wheelbase is almost half an inch longer and the car is 1.1 inches wider.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nFor most of my drive, I put the Optima in Sport mode in response to the high altitude, though I did switch between Sport and Normal to get a sense of the differences between the modes. Sport mode changes the transmission and steering response. Steering becomes heavier, but it’s not a workout; I preferred how it felt in this mode. I wouldn’t put the Optima in the same league as a luxury performance sedan, like a BMW, but it’s good for the non-luxury, non-performance class. The transmission also holds on to lower gears longer, providing more immediate response in Sport mode.\n\nIn Normal mode, the transmission quickly kicks down gears. Because it’s a six-speed, as opposed to an eight- or nine-speed transmission, downshifts happen quickly. The transmission doesn’t hunt like eight- and nine-speed models typically do, and it also doesn’t produce the odd, non-mechanical/elastic feeling of a continuously variable automatic transmission, which other models in this class use. The Optima’s power steering is much lighter in Normal than in Sport mode; it’s a touch overboosted for my liking. It’s almost like a video game, in that you don’t get the same feel that you get from the best steering setups.\n\nKia said the turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine was retuned for 2016 with a smaller turbo and a torque curve that produces more torque at lower engine speeds. The old engine’s tuning, Kia said, provided its most power in a sudden surge higher in the rev range. The new model uses a smaller turbo and feels “gruntier,” with a broader power range. It’s a good change. Winding through tight roads was not when I wanted a sudden surge of anything.\n\nFor 2016, Kia added a new engine to the Optima mix. It’s a 178-horsepower, turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder that’s paired with a seven-speed, dual-clutch automatic transmission. I briefly drove an LX 1.6T with this engine for just a quick jaunt up and down a hilly route. I didn’t have enough time in the car to pass judgment on the powertrain, but I wasn’t bowled over.\n\nPerhaps because of the hills, the Optima with the 1.6-liter four cylinder seemed sluggish off the line. Once it got moving, though, it got with the program and provided better response. The shifts felt pretty smooth, but didn’t happen as quickly as I was expecting. My driving partner described it as lazy, and that echoes my initial impression of the powertrain. Further testing is warranted, because other Cars.com staffers who tested the same engine in a less hilly region had the opposite impression.\n\nThe ride in either model I tested is impressive. Our drive consisted of some fairly bumpy roads, and the Optima always felt composed and predictable. It did a good job isolating the ripples and undulations of the road and dealt with all but the biggest bumps well. Kia said it reworked the chassis to include a different mix of high-strength and ultra-high-strength steel, and it altered the Optima’s suspension geometry and components to improve the chassis dynamics. The work has paid off.\n\nThe Optima is also a quiet car. Wind noise was negligible, and little road noise came into the cabin. Kia said the chassis changes that helped improve the car’s dynamics also aimed to reduce cabin noise, vibration and harshness. Here again the work seems to have paid off.\n\nThere are three engines available in the Optima. In addition to the two engines I tested, there’s also a 185-hp, 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine. That engine gets 24/35/28 mpg. The turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder gets 22/32/25, while the turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder gets 28/39/32 mpg.\n\nCompared with the Fusion, Accord and Altima, the Optima’s mileage is competitive. The best mileage the 2016 Ford Fusion gets is 28 mpg combined. The 2016 Honda Accord with a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine tops out at 31 mpg combined, while the 2015 Altima tops out at 31 mpg combined as well (the EPA hasn’t yet rated the 2016).\n\nTo look at other differences between the competitors, check out this comparison.\n\nInterior\n\nFront-seat passengers can rejoice, because they now can have basically the same seat controls as the driver, including height adjustment, so those of short stature can see down the road better. And that’s not just for the highest trim levels: In an Optima LX I took for a quick jaunt, the passenger’s manually adjusting seat also had height adjustment. I did notice, however, that the lumbar support on the passenger side in the SXL isn’t height-adjustable as it is for the driver.\n\nThe center controls are canted toward the driver, but not so far that I couldn’t easily adjust the climate controls or read the navigation screen from the passenger seat. (In fact, if Kia hadn’t told me the controls were angled toward the driver, I doubt I would have noticed.) There’s good room for the front-seat passenger; I never felt pinned in or bumped elbows with my driving partner.\n\nOverall, the interior’s design is OK, but it’s let down by an element I just don’t think works. Kia’s designers used a trim piece to create a distinct horizontal line across the dashboard. Above the line is a touch-screen, below it are physical controls. It almost works, except that passengers are then faced with a broad expanse of empty dashboard that I just didn’t find pleasing. I also didn’t like the graining or texture of the dashboard. This was less of an issue when I was driving, but as a passenger I wasn’t impressed.\n\nIn terms of materials, the top-of-the-line SXL has padding where you want it; in general, it felt like it measured up to its class. A nit I have to pick is that I didn’t like the horn button. Something about the plastic graining and its round shape stuck out in a bad way. It just didn’t look as rich as I wanted it to.\n\nWhile I wasn’t able to spend as much time in the lower LX 1.6T trim, I can say the cloth seats felt supportive and high-quality. I wasn’t as sold on how the cloth looked. It’s not terrible, but I wouldn’t put it at the top of the segment. The overall look of the interior — including the stitching and horizontal segmentation of the dashboard — remains in the lesser trim. While it’s not as opulent as the SXL, it looks presentable.\n\nIn terms of interior room, the 2016 Optima offers more legroom up front and more headroom front and rear than the Fusion, Accord or Altima, but it offers the least legroom in back. Compare interior specs for the SXL trim I tested with the other models’ high-end trims here.\n\nPractically, though, backseat room is competitive with the class. With the driver’s seat set where I’d want it, I had plenty of room for my legs in the seat behind it. My knees were raised slightly, but I don’t think it’d be intolerable even on a longish drive. It certainly didn’t feel worse than other midsize cars I’ve been in lately. Headroom is also good, even with the panoramic moonroof on the SXL I drove.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nErgonomically, the Optima is a very sound car. The controls are easy to find and use, nothing felt awkward, and everything was laid out in a straightforward manner. The only control whose location I kept forgetting was the button that switched between Sport, Normal and Eco modes. Experience tells me that’s not a button I use with any great frequency in my day-to-day driving, though, so that doesn’t bug me.\n\nOverall, the electronics worked well, allowing for easy changes between menus. The graphics, while not as crisp as those found in Ford’s MyFord Touch setup, were good for the non-luxury segment.\n\nAn especially good electronic feature Kia offers is an around-view camera setup that gives you a 360-degree view around the Optima. I found Kia’s system to be the best of any such system I’ve tested; it seemed to offer the widest view around the Optima. Some systems — particularly the first ones on the market — gave a sense only of what was within 6 inches of the side of the car. The Kia system stretches the field of vision to show a much larger area. Other carmakers should take note of how well this system works.\n\nCargo & Storage\n\nThe new Optima’s slightly larger dimensions result in a slightly larger trunk. Kia says the 2016 Optima’s trunk is half a cubic foot larger than the 2015 model. The trunk is a good size and wide, but it isn’t the deepest opening from front to back in the class.\n\nAs far as the cabin goes, there’s a nice selection of bins and cubbies for things like water bottles, phones and notebooks. In particular, there was a nice-sized tray ahead of the gearshift, with a second (very useful) cubby between that and the cupholders.\n\nSafety\n\nThe 2016 Optima had not been crash-tested by either the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration as of publication.\n\nIn addition to the required front airbags, antilock brakes and electronic stability system, Kia offers a number of safety features, including rear cross-traffic alert, blind spot warning, lane departure warning, forward collision warning with autonomous braking  and the aforementioned around-view monitor.\n\nAll those features are standard on the SXL I tested and optional on the SX trim. The autonomous braking system, lane departure warning and around-view monitor are not available on EX or LX models. Check the entire list of safety specifications here.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nThe 2016 redesign is a good effort that puts the Optima among the top of the class. Highlights include the improved chassis and overall interior quality.\n\nWhile I didn’t like some of the interior design choices, and I wasn’t blown away by the newest engine, nothing in what I saw suggests Kia has screwed up the Optima. That’s significant when you’re dealing with a car that was already good to start with.\n\nYet while substantial work has been done under the skin, there’s little outward sign that the Optima has been redesigned. To sense the improvements, you really need to drive it. And in the midsize sedan market, where every significant automaker has an offering, having a little outward pizzazz indicating this is the new Optima wouldn’t be the worst idea.\n\nAs it is, Kia has an improved, good midsize sedan that impresses, but does little to grab your attention when it passes by.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nKia has transformed its Optima family sedan from a plain, forgettable entry to one of the most distinctively styled cars in the class. Three trim levels are available — LX, EX and SX — and the five-seat Optima competes against cars like the Ford Fusion, Toyota Camry and Honda Accord. It’s also offered in hybrid form.\n\n(Skip to details on the: Optima Hybrid)\nNew for 2013\n\nThe base LX trim level gains new sliding front head restraints and loses the choice of a manual transmission, leaving a six-speed automatic for all Optimas. A new SX Limited trim features Nappa leather seats, unique 18-inch chrome wheels, LED daytime running lights and red brake calipers.\n\nThe Optima Hybrid has an upgraded hybrid system with a more powerful electric motor and battery, as well as a stronger hybrid starter generator. There’s slightly more trunk space thanks to a repackaged hybrid battery and two trim levels of the hybrid are now offered.\nExterior\nWith its creased sheet metal and low-slung shape, there’s luxury-car sophistication to the Optima’s exterior that you don’t see in a lot of family sedans. The Optima features the new face of Kia that we’ve seen on models like the Sorento and Sportage crossovers. It’s essentially a black mesh grille bordered by angular headlights, and the design enhances the car’s aggressiveness. The placement of the Kia badge above the grille is a little odd-looking, though. Exterior features include:\n\n\nStandard 16-inch steel wheels; available 16-, 17- and 18-inch alloy wheels\nStandard dual chrome exhaust tips \nOptional panoramic sunroof \nOptional high-intensity-discharge headlights \nOptional lip spoiler \nOptional LED daytime running lights\n\nInterior\nThe five-person cabin features front bucket seats and a rear bench seat. The interior has a driver-oriented design, with the entire center control panel angled toward the driver. The optional Premium Package includes an Infinity stereo, Kia’s Uvo hands-free entertainment and communication system, and HD Radio. Interior features include:\n\n\nStandard cloth seats; leather optional\nStandard tilt/telescoping steering wheel \nStandard cooled glove box \nStandard CD stereo with MP3 jack and USB port \nSX trim level has leather upholstery, stitched seams, paddle shifters on the steering wheel, metal pedals and illuminated scuff plates \nOptional heated and cooled front seats \nOptional rear seat heaters \nOptional heated steering wheel \nOptional navigation system with a backup camera\n\nUnder the Hood\nMechanical features include:\n\n\nStandard 200-horsepower, 2.4-liter four-cylinder that teams with a six-speed automatic transmission\nOptional 274-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder with the automatic transmission\n\nSafety\nStandard safety features include:\n\n\nAntilock brakes\nSide-impact airbags for the front seats \nSide curtain airbags\nElectronic stability system\n\nOptima Hybrid\nLike its sister vehicle, the Hyundai Sonata Hybrid, the Optima Hybrid gains a re-engineered hybrid drivetrain for 2013. It now combines a more powerful 47-hp electric motor with a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine to produce a combined 199 hp and 235 pounds-feet of torque. The transmission-mounted motor works with a six-speed automatic rather than the electrically variable transmissions many hybrids employ. The electric motor draws power from a more powerful lithium-polymer battery that’s mounted behind the rear seat.\n\nThe Optima Hybrid can cruise on electric-only power under light acceleration and sufficient battery charge. EPA-estimated gas mileage for the base Optima Hybrid LX is 36/40 mpg city/highway while the uplevel EX is rated at 35/39 mpg.\n\nVisual changes amount to a hybrid badge in back, aerodynamic 16- or 17-inch alloy wheels, minor differences to the grille and front lights, and a small rear spoiler. Aerodynamic enhancements include a slight reduction in ride height and underbody covers. All told, the Optima Hybrid looks far more like the regular Optima than the Sonata Hybrid does a Sonata.\n\nStandard features include cloth upholstery, dual-zone automatic air conditioning, a CD stereo with USB connectivity, a backup camera and push-button start.  An Infinity premium stereo, navigation system, heated steering wheel, heated front and rear seats, ventilated front seats and leather upholstery are available.

      "expert_review": "The newly redesigned 2016 Kia Optima, with its blend of driving dynamics and a well-thought-out interior, remains competitive in the absolutely cutthroat midsize sedan field.\n\nThe redesigned Optima’s major improvements are under the skin: chassis tuning and an additional engine offering. For a newly redesigned car, though, the 2016 Optima doesn’t look hugely different from the previous year’s car. You can run through the rest of the changes here.\n\nI drove a 2016 Kia Optima SXL for several hours around Aspen, Colo., over the Continental Divide and through Vail on a mix of winding mountain roads and interstate highway stretches. The Optima competes with similar body-type vehicles like the Ford Fusion, Honda Accord and Nissan Altima, among others, in the midsize sedan class.\n\nExterior & Styling\nPark a 2016 Kia Optima next to the 2015 model, and it’s not glaringly obvious what the differences are. This isn’t bad, though, because I thought the previous Optima was a good-looking, if understated, car.\n\nThe grille finishes are different on the 2016, and they vary depending on trim. The SXL I tested had a satin finish; other trims get a black grille. Sharper-eyed observers will note that the new Optima has slightly different dimensions: The wheelbase is almost half an inch longer and the vehicle is 1.1 inches wider.\n\nHow It Drives\nFor most of my drive, I put the Kia Optima in Sport mode in response to the high altitude, though I did switch between Sport and Normal to get a sense of the differences between the modes. Sport mode changes the transmission and steering response. Steering becomes heavier, but it’s not a workout; I preferred how it felt in this mode. I wouldn’t put the Optima in the same league as a luxury performance sedan, like a BMW, but it’s good for the non-luxury, non-performance class. The transmission also holds on to lower gears longer, providing more immediate response in Sport mode.\n\nIn Normal mode, the transmission quickly kicks down gears. Because it’s a six-speed, as opposed to an eight- or nine-speed transmission, downshifts happen quickly. The transmission doesn’t hunt like eight- and nine-speed models typically do, and it also doesn’t produce the odd, non-mechanical/elastic feeling of a continuously variable automatic transmission, which other models in this class use. The Optima’s power steering is much lighter in Normal than in Sport mode; it’s a touch overboosted for my liking. It’s almost like a video game, in that you don’t get the same feel that you get from the best steering setups.\n\nKia said the turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine was retuned for 2016 with a smaller turbo and a torque curve that produces more lb-ft of torque at lower engine speeds. The old engine’s tuning, Kia said, provided its most power in a sudden surge higher in the rev range. The new model uses a smaller turbo and feels “gruntier,” with a broader power range. It’s a good change. Winding through tight roads was not when I wanted a sudden surge of anything.\n\nFor 2016, Kia added a new engine to the Optima mix. It’s a 178-horsepower, turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder that’s paired with a seven-speed, dual-clutch automatic transmission. I briefly drove an LX 1.6T with this engine for just a quick jaunt up and down a hilly route. I didn’t have enough time in the vehicle to pass judgment on the powertrain, but I wasn’t bowled over.\n\nPerhaps because of the hills, the Kia Optima with the 1.6-liter four cylinder seemed sluggish off the line. Once it got moving, though, it got with the program and provided better response. The shifts felt pretty smooth, but didn’t happen as quickly as I was expecting. My driving partner described it as lazy, and that echoes my initial impression of the powertrain. Further testing is warranted, because other Cars.com staffers who tested the same engine in a less hilly region had the opposite impression.\n\nThe ride in either model I tested is impressive. Our drive consisted of some fairly bumpy roads in alloy wheels, and the Optima always felt composed and predictable. It did a good job isolating the ripples and undulations of the road and dealt with all but the biggest bumps well. Kia said it reworked the chassis to include a different mix of high-strength and ultra-high-strength steel, and it altered the Optima’s suspension geometry and components to improve the chassis dynamics. The work has paid off.\n\nThe Kia Optima is also a quiet car. Wind noise was negligible, and little road noise came into the cabin. Kia said the chassis changes that helped improve the car’s dynamics also aimed to reduce cabin noise, vibration and harshness. Here again the work seems to have paid off.\n\nThere are three engines available in the Kia Optima. In addition to the two engines I tested, there’s also a 185-hp, 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine. That engine gets 24/35/28 mpg. The turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder gets 22/32/25, while the turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder gets 28/39/32 mpg.\n\nCompared with the Fusion, Accord and Altima, the Kia Optima’s mileage is competitive. The best mileage the 2016 Ford Fusion gets is 28 mpg combined. The 2016 Honda Accord with a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine tops out at 31 mpg combined, while the 2015 Altima tops out at 31 mpg combined as well (the EPA hasn’t yet rated the 2016).\n\nTo look at other differences between the competitors, check out this comparison.\n\nInterior\nFront-seat passengers can rejoice, because they now can have basically the same seat controls as the driver, including height adjustment, so those of short stature can see down the road better. And that’s not just for the highest trim levels: In an Optima LX I took for a quick jaunt, the passenger’s manually adjusting seat also had height adjustment. I did notice, however, that the lumbar support on the passenger side in the SXL isn’t height-adjustable as it is for the driver.\n\nThe center controls are canted toward the driver, but not so far that I couldn’t easily adjust the climate controls or read the navigation screen from the passenger seat. (In fact, if Kia hadn’t told me the controls were angled toward the driver, I doubt I would have noticed.) There’s good room for the front-seat passenger; I never felt pinned in or bumped elbows with my driving partner.\n\nOverall, the interior’s design is OK, but it’s let down by an element I just don’t think works. Kia’s designers used a trim piece to create a distinct horizontal line across the dashboard. Above the line is a touch-screen, below it are physical controls. It almost works, except that passengers are then faced with a broad expanse of empty dashboard that I just didn’t find pleasing. I also didn’t like the graining or texture of the dashboard. This was less of an issue when I was driving, but as a passenger I wasn’t impressed.\n\nIn terms of materials, the top-of-the-line SXL has padding where you want it; in general, it felt like it measured up to its class. A nit I have to pick is that I didn’t like the horn button. Something about the plastic graining and its round shape stuck out in a bad way. It just didn’t look as rich as I wanted it to.\n\nWhile I wasn’t able to spend as much time in the lower LX 1.6T trim, I can say the cloth seats felt supportive and high-quality. I wasn’t as sold on how the cloth looked. It’s not terrible, but I wouldn’t put it at the top of the segment. The overall look of the interior — including the stitching and horizontal segmentation of the dashboard — remains in the lesser trim. While it’s not as opulent as the SXL, it looks presentable.\n\nIn terms of interior room, the 2016 Kia Optima offers more legroom up front and more headroom front and rear than the Fusion, Accord or Altima, but it offers the least legroom in back. Compare interior specs for the SXL trim I tested with the other models’ high-end trims here.\n\nPractically, though, backseat room is competitive with the class. With the driver’s seat set where I’d want it, I had plenty of room for my legs in the seat behind it. My knees were raised slightly, but I don’t think it’d be intolerable even on a longish drive. It certainly didn’t feel worse than other midsize vehicles I’ve been in lately. Headroom is also good, even with the panoramic moonroof on the SXL I drove.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nErgonomically, the Kia Optima is a very sound vehicle. The controls are easy to find and use, nothing felt awkward, and everything was laid out in a straightforward manner. The only control whose location I kept forgetting was the button that switched between Sport, Normal and Eco modes. Experience tells me that’s not a button I use with any great frequency in my day-to-day driving, though, so that doesn’t bug me.\n\nOverall, the electronics worked well, allowing for easy changes between menus. The graphics, while not as crisp as those found in Ford’s MyFord Touch setup, were good for the non-luxury segment.\n\nAn especially good electronic feature Kia offers is an around-view camera setup that gives you a 360-degree surround-view around the Optima. I found Kia’s system to be the best of any such system I’ve tested; it seemed to offer the widest view around the Optima. Some systems — particularly the first ones on the market — gave a sense only of what was within 6 inches of the side of the car. The Kia system stretches the field of vision to show a much larger area. Other carmakers should take note of how well this system works.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe new Kia Optima’s slightly larger dimensions result in a slightly larger trunk. Kia says the 2016 Optima’s trunk is half a cubic foot larger than the 2015 model. The trunk is a good size and wide, but it isn’t the deepest opening from front to back in the class.\n\nAs far as the cabin goes, there’s a nice selection of bins and cubbies for things like water bottles, phones and notebooks. In particular, there was a nice-sized tray ahead of the gearshift, with a second (very useful) cubby between that and the cupholders.\n\nSafety\nThe 2016 Kia Optima had not been crash-tested by either the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration as of publication.\n\nIn addition to the required front airbags, antilock brakes and electronic stability system, Kia offers a number of safety features, including rear cross-traffic alert, blind spot warning, lane departure warning, forward collision warning with autonomous braking  and the aforementioned around-view monitor.\n\nAll those features are standard on the SXL I tested and optional on the SX trim. The autonomous braking system, lane departure warning and around-view monitor are not available on EX or LX models. Check the entire list of safety specifications here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe 2016 redesign is a good effort that puts the Optima among the top of the class. Highlights include the improved chassis and overall interior quality.\n\nWhile I didn’t like some of the interior design choices, and I wasn’t blown away by the newest engine, nothing in what I saw suggests Kia has screwed up the Optima. That’s significant when you’re dealing with a vehicle that was already good to start with.\n\nYet while substantial work has been done under the skin, there’s little outward sign that the Optima has been redesigned. To sense the improvements, you really need to drive it. And in the midsize sedan market, where every significant automaker has an offering, having a little outward pizzazz indicating this is the new Kia Optima wouldn’t be the worst idea.\n\nAs it is, Kia has an improved, good midsize sedan that impresses, but does little to grab your attention when it passes by.\n\nSend Bill an email",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe Kia Optima midsize sedan’s first update since its 2010 debut brings a lightly restyled nose and tail, new seats and more high-tech electronics.\n\nAvailable in LX, EX, SX and SX-Limited trim levels, the Optima competes with everything from the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry to the Ford Fusion and Volkswagen Passat — to name a few in this expansive class.\n\nExterior\nThe exterior changes are clustered around the front and rear. There are new LED daytime running lights, fog lights and larger LED taillights that present the diffuse, almost neon glow seen in other recent Kia redesigns and new models.\n\nStandard elements include new 16-inch alloy wheels, fog lights, chrome-accented door handles, dual chrome tailpipes and heated side mirrors with turn signal lights. The EX trim level adds 17-inch wheels. The SX trim steps up to 18-inch polished alloy wheels and unique lower bumpers and side sills. The SX-T adds xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights. The top trim level, Limited, has its own 18-inch chrome wheels, chrome side sills, different LED fog lights and red brake calipers.\n\nInterior\nInterior upgrades for 2014 include redesigned seats. Cloth upholstery is standard on the LX. The EX gets leather upholstery, an eight-way power adjustable driver’s seat and illuminated cupholders. The Limited adds premium leather and an electronic parking brake in place of the pedal.\n\nAlso new are a 4.3-inch display in the instrument panel and an optional 8-inch touch-screen for the navigation system, which also includes UVO eServices, an eight-speaker Infinity sound system, HD Radio, SiriusXM Satellite Radio and SiriusXM Traffic.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe powertrains carry over from 2013 and include a 2.4-liter four-cylinder, a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder and a hybrid system, all mated to a six-speed automatic transmission. The turbo engine, which Kia offers instead of a V-6, is available only on the Optima SX.\n\nThe SX also includes a new Drive Mode Select feature, the various modes of which allow the driver to adjust the accelerator sensitivity, transmission shift points and power-steering assist to suit conditions or personal preference.\nSafety\nStandard safety features include the required antilock brakes, electronic stability system with traction control and six airbags: frontal, front-seat-mounted side-impact airbags and side curtains along the front and rear seats. Active safety options include blind spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert and rear parking sensors.",

      "expert_review": "If I told you a car is stylish, fun to drive, fuel efficient, filled with upscale features and costs less than $30,000, you’d have a hard time believing me. If I told you — sight unseen — that the 2011 Kia Optima is such a car, you’d have a really hard time believing me until you saw this gorgeous midsize sedan. Of course, if I showed you the 2011 Optima’s price tag, your disbelief would kick in again.\n\nAfter years of lingering in forgettable territory, the redesigned 2011 Optima is now unforgettable and poised to conquer its competition.\n\nI’m not the only one who thinks that. Cars.com named the 2011 Optima its Best of 2011. Major exterior and interior face-lifts as well as a powerful new engine combine to make it one of the most appealing choices in the midsize sedan market. The 200-horsepower engine helps make the driving experience more memorable. It has ample power and a smooth ride for day-to-day driving.\n\nThe Optima starts at $19,200, and my test car, the EX, had a starting MSRP of $22,700. It ultimately rang up at $27,440 with the inclusion of the $2,000 Technology Package and the $2,250 EX Premium Package.\n\nEXTERIOR\nWhen the Optima first appeared in my driveway, my husband kept referring to it as “the Lexus.” He couldn’t believe that it wasn’t a luxury-brand vehicle. He especially couldn’t believe it was a Kia. He had pigeonholed Kia to its 1990s’ introductory vehicles, some of which looked like chubby Suzuki Samurais. Kia has come a long, long way, and the 2011 Optima is nothing short of lovely.\n\nThe all-new Optima has a lower roofline and a new face with angular headlights that bookend a black mesh grille. The Optima EX I drove comes standard with 17-inch alloy wheels, fog lights and dual exhaust pipes with chrome tips. My test car also had the optional panoramic sunroof.\n\nAs you’d expect from a midsize sedan, the Optima is easy for everyone — even a tiny 2-year-old — to get in and out of. The doors are light enough that no one will suffer a concussion should they get hit by one (my little ones are at the optimal height for being hit by opening or closing car doors). The trunk is also easy to open and close, but it would be improved if it popped open and up once unlocked rather than simply popping open and sitting there. With three kids, I often don’t have a free hand to lift up the trunk lid.\n\nThe trunk space is about average for this class at 15.4 cubic feet. There is nothing extraordinary about the trunk — no pass-through and no hidden first-aid kits or flashlights — but it serves its purpose and that’s good enough for me, especially when the rest of the car is filled with so many great things.\n\nMy test car, the Optima EX, is powered by a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine that delivers a healthy 200 hp. It gets an EPA-estimated 24/34 mpg city/highway. I drove and drove and drove this car and still didn’t have an empty tank at the end of my weeklong test drive. A sport-tuned SX trim and a turbocharged EX trim are also available and come with a turbocharged 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine that delivers 274 hp.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Groove-On\n\nINTERIOR\nThe Optima’s interior looks just as good as the outside does, and it feels good, too. The faux wood trim was tasteful enough that I’d have loved more of it around the cabin, but the more prominent black-colored plastic that covered everything looked and felt decent, too.\n\nIn addition to looking good, the Optima’s cabin is filled with upscale features. Standard fare includes dual-zone automatic temperature control, USB and auxiliary inputs, Bluetooth connectivity, auto-dimming rearview mirror with HomeLink and compass, and a glove box with a cooling feature for icy beverages. It also has eight cupholders, and the center console is tiered and ample. The center stack’s controls are easy to reach and manage. Comfortable leather-trimmed seats complete the appearance of more luxury than expected in a car this price.\n\nThis car offers many of the same options you’d find in a Lexus, Land Rover or Infiniti. A heated steering wheel, automatic panoramic sunroof and backup camera are available features and priced well within reach. There’s also the option of heated and cooled front seats, heated rear seats and driver’s seat memory. When all is said and done, the Optima offers the opportunity to have a well-outfitted car that costs far less than a luxury brand.\n\nSome car reviewers have complained about the Optima’s tight headroom in the rear seats, but my 5-foot-8 frame fit quite comfortably, even with the panoramic sunroof that diminishes headroom. In fact, I found head-, leg- and shoulder room to be sufficient, even for the front passenger with a rear-facing infant-safety seat installed in the rear seat behind it.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2011 Kia Optima is an Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s Top Safety Pick. It earned the highest rating of Good in frontal-offset, side-impact, rear and roof-strength crash tests. It also has an electronic stability system, another must for IIHS’ Top Safety Pick status. The Optima also earned an overall crash-test rating of five stars from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nThe Optima has two sets of lower Latch anchors in the outboard rear seats. They’re easy to get to and use. I could fit a backless booster seat, a convertible and a rear-facing infant seat across the backseat, but it was too tight for a child in the booster seat to buckle up. The Optima really fits two car seats. To see how the Optima did in MotherProof.com’s Car Seat Check, click here.\n\nThe Optima safety features include front-wheel drive, traction control, active front head restraints in the front row and six airbags, including side curtains for both rows. My test car came equipped with the optional Technology Package that includes a backup camera.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2011 Kia Optima here.",

      "expert_review": "The voice on the other end of the line was saying, “We’re going to get you a Kia Optima to test drive.” Despite heroic efforts to mentally bury my worst fears, three words raced through my brain: cheap, underpowered, small. Thankfully, fears do not always translate to reality, and the 2001 Kia Optima SE sedan I recently climbed into revealed how far the Korean automaker has come in raising the bar of quality transportation.\n\nThe Optima is a real car, with good looks, real interior room, substantial power and genuine comfort.\n\nHistorically, Kia’s niche has been selling motor vehicles that are cheaper than most. And it was no surprise that paying less meant sacrificing much of the quality and many of the amenities found in pricier autos sold by bigger automakers.\n\nThe Optima is Kia’s attempt to break the mold — which it does. Optima is the largest and fanciest vehicle Kia has brought to the United States. And the $22,269 bottom line on my test model certainly topped the prices I’ve seen on past Kia offerings. No surprise there. The Optima was built for the purpose of competing against two midsize segment heavyweights — the Toyota Camry and the Honda Accord.\n\nStop laughing. Optima really is competitive. Here’s how.\n\nA base 2001 Camry — we’re talking about a CE version with a manual gearbox — starts at $17,675. Among other things, that gets you a four-cylinder engine. Want a Camry with a V-6? The fare starts at $22,385.\n\nMy Optima came with a standard 2.5-liter V-6 rated at 170 horsepower. Base price: $19,949. An LX version of the Optima, also with a V-6 matched with an automatic transmission, drops the starting price to $18,499.\n\nHow about the Honda Accord? The base DX sedan starts at $15,400, but that translates to a four-cylinder engine and a list of appointments much smaller than that found on my Optima SE. The Honda LX sedan with a V-6 starts at $22,400.\n\nGet the picture? Kia is using the tried-and-true formula of loading up a sedan with standard features and pricing it well below the competition.\n\nAnd then there are the warranties.\n\nThe Optima package includes five years or 60,000 miles of basic coverage, 10 years or 100,000 miles on the powertrain, a five-year/100,000-mile anti-perforation warranty and a five-year/unlimited-mileage roadside-assistance program. More car, pay less, long-standing security. Yeah, I’d say that’s competitive.\n\nAnd, by the way, the Optima was just plain nice.\n\nThe interior was quiet, comfortable and capable of transporting five adults — not a given in many so-called “midsize” four-door models. Standard interior features included a pleasant AM/FM/cassette/CD sound system, an eight-way power driver’s seat, an all-power package (windows, locks, mirrors), wood-grain accents, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and a power moonroof.\n\nThe exterior standard package included fog lamps and a power antenna. Front seat side-impact air bags and a first-aid kit were part of the standard safety equipment.\n\nAmazingly, the short options list included anti-lock brakes — a $795 charge to the bottom line. Why Kia included so much in the standard package and left out ABS is a mystery to me.\n\nStill, the sum total is impressive. Throw out the optional $995 leather package on my Optima SE and the $80 in floor mats, and the well-appointed car would list for just a few bucks over $21,000 (including a $450 freight/handling charge).\n\nNot a bad deal at all, especially given the surprisingly nimble handling characteristics of the sedan. The Optima SE performed well during acceleration, braking, freeway driving, city driving and uphill climbs.\n\nThe off-the-line bursts were robust enough that I was tempted to get out of the car and read the nameplate, just to make sure it really was a Kia-made car I was driving. The V-6 is not meek machinery.\n\nThe Optima upgrade has been expected since Hyundai’s late 1990s acquisition of Kia. Hyundai has been upgrading its U.S. offerings for years, with the Hyundai Santa Fe sport-utility vehicle being a recent, prime example of a Korean-made vehicle seriously competing against deep-pocket competitors.\n\nHowever, Kia’s U.S. mission with the Optima will not be easily accomplished. Despite a saucy television commercial that favorably touts Optima’s standard features and price compared with a Camry, it won’t be easy to compete against the popular Toyota make or the much-loved Honda Accord.\n\nToyota and Honda have the advantage of supremely established — and for the most part, deserved — reputations among American car buyers for building quality autos. Kia, on the other hand, is battling not only that but also its own past reputation for producing economy cars that lacked juice and comfort.\n\nReputations aside, if you’re looking for a nicely priced sedan with some pop and enough comforts to please a modest family, the Optima is worth a serious look.\n\nKia Optima at a glance\n\nMake/model: 2001 Kia Optima SE\n\nVehicle type: Midsize, five-passenger, front-drive, four-door sedan\n\nBase price: $19,949 (as tested, $22,269)\n\nEngine: 2.5-liter V-6 with 170 horsepower at 6,000 revolutions per minute and 169 pounds/foot torque at 4,000 rpm\n\nEPA fuel economy: 19 miles per gallon city; 25 mpg highway\n\nTransmission: Electronic four-speed automatic with overdrive and clutchless shifting option\n\nSteering: Power rack and pinion\n\nBrakes: Power front/rear discs with $795 anti-lock option\n\nSuspension type: All-independent with double wishbones, coil springs and anti-roll bar on the front; multi-link with coil springs and anti-roll bar on the rear\n\nInterior volume: 100 cubic feet\n\nTrunk volume: 13 cubic feet\n\nFuel tank: 17.2 gallons\n\nCurb weight: 3,190 pounds\n\nFront track: 60.6 inches\n\nRear track: 59.8 inches\n\nHeight: 55.5 inches\n\nLength: 185.9 inches\n\nWheelbase: 106.3 inches\n\nWidth: 71.5 inches\n\nGround clearance: 6.1 inches\n\nTires: P205/60R15\n\nPoint of entry: Benicia",

      "expert_review": "The Gilded Era of the Motor Car, in which exclusiveness and extravagance often trumped common sense, is ending. It is a demise hastened by technological, environmental and economic change, the latter stemming from growing pressure on automakers to design and develop affordable vehicles just to stay in business.\n\nIt is why historically exotic nameplates such as Lamborghini, Ferrari, Rolls-Royce and Porsche are now sponsored by generally profitable mass-market car companies. For example, Italy’s Lamborghini can afford to design, develop and market a $387,000 Aventador Coupe for a privileged few in the United States and elsewhere only because Lamborghini’s parent, Volkswagen/Audi, sells hundreds of thousands of affordable automobiles worldwide.\n\nThe story is familiar: The contributions of many support the luxurious pursuits of a few.\n\nIt is a pity — for those still clinging to the baubles and presumed prestige of what they deem to be “luxurious” — that South Korean automobile-manufacturing partners Hyundai and Kia either don’t understand or don’t appreciate the concept.\n\nBy using advanced technology to make once-uncommon amenities and components both common and inexpensive, and by enthusiastically responding to global demands for cleaner, more fuel-efficient automobiles, the South Koreans have destroyed traditional notions of automotive luxury and have rendered meaningless the pursuit of motorized “prestige” — at least, for most of us.\n\nConsider this week’s subject vehicle, the 2012 Kia Optima SX T-GDI sedan. It comfortably seats five. The Lamborghini coupe seats two. Bring a couple of overnight bags, if that, in the Lamborghini. Bring luggage for you and four passengers in the Optima.\n\nIf you are laughing and shouting “apples and oranges,” you are missing the point. Similar comparisons can be made with the Optima SX ­T-GDI and almost any other super-luxury automobile.\n\nDo you like the rich, supple leather in the $450,000 extended-wheelbase version of the Rolls-Royce Phantom sedan? The perforated leather with mesh trim in the Optima SX T-GDI is not nearly as rich or fancy. But the combination is engineered for a long, pleasant ride, and it cleans easily in the event of messy spills. The Optima’s front seats can be heated in the winter and cooled in the summer, just as efficiently and reliably as heated and cooled seats in more expensive luxury sedans.\n\nWhat about navigation and a rearview backup camera? Both are available in the SX T-GDI, as options, but for a fraction of the cost of equipment included in more expensive automobiles, and with arguably better quality. For example, the backup camera in the Optima has better definition and is more enjoyable to use than the cameras in almost any sedan — luxury or mainstream — I’ve driven.\n\nOf course, the midsize SX T-GDI won’t beat something like the Aventador Coupe off the starting line. The all-wheel-drive Lamborghini comes with a 6.5-liter, 48-valve V-12 engine (509 foot-pounds of torque, 700 horsepower). By comparison, the front-wheel-drive SX T-GDI is a wimp — a 2-liter, 16-valve in-line four-cylinder engine (269 foot-pounds of torque, 274 horsepower).\n\nBut, driving on regulated roads and staying reasonably within posted speed limits — the Lamborghini driver is not likely to get that far ahead of a Kia or anything else, especially not in the traffic of the District of Columbia and surrounding areas, where speeding, in any kind of car, is likely to draw the attention of the authorities.\n\nConventional wisdom says that someone who can afford the asking price of a Lamborghini isn’t worried about the pump price of gasoline. But not even Lamborghini officials believe that. I spoke with several of them during a recent visit to the Lamborghini factory in Bologna. To paraphrase, the Lamborghini bosses said their clients are rich, not stupid. Those clients, too, are concerned about gas prices and consumption and are pressuring Lamborghini to “improve fuel efficiency without harming Lamborghini’s DNA,” said Stephan Winkelmann, Lamborghini president and chief executive. And what is that DNA? “Power, speed, superior handling — all the things that Lamborghini has been known for,” he said.\n\nKia executives, meanwhile, have never had to carry that burden of “prestige,” one getting heavier in a world increasingly concerned about fossil-fuel costs and sourcing, land use to accommodate population growth, and making ends meet.\n\nKia’s DNA has always been to surprise, to give customers far more car than they expected to get at a price far lower than they expected to pay. As demonstrated by the Optima SX T-GDI, loaded with practically every amenity and technology available in more expensive sedans, it is doing that.\n\nIn the process, Kia and Hyundai are forcing their competitors to do the same. So it comes down to is a matter of perspective. Are Kia and Hyundai taking the “special” out of formerly special automobiles, turning them into commodities? Or have they democratized “special” and “luxury,” making those things affordable for — and, even more important, expected by — car shoppers everywhere?",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: A stylish redesign that should have left its new name and optional touchscreen system on the drawing board.\n\nVersus the competition: A more attractive take than Hyundai’s frowny new Sonata, the K5 is plenty competitive, but the disparity between its available touchscreen systems is an opportunity missed, and while its powertrain lag might boost gas mileage, it would be wiser to outperform competitors equipped with continuously variable automatic transmissions.\n\nWhen I reviewed the 2020 Sonata, I was impressed Hyundai hadn’t phoned in its redesign at a time when interest in sedans is waning. Many automakers have ceded the mid-size sedan class to stalwarts like the Honda Accord, Nissan Altima and Toyota Camry — either completely, by bailing out, or passively, by starving their models of resources. Now you can add another brand, though a related one, that hasn’t thrown in the towel: Kia. With a model the company pitches as so different it deserved a new name, the K5 (formerly the Optima) has a lot in common with the new Sonata (which is also quite different yet retains its name). The two cars share a platform, though the Sonata is built in Montgomery, Ala., and the K5 comes together in West Point, Ga.\n\nRelated: 2021 Kia K5: Mr. Optima, I Presume\n\nThe K5 has a slightly longer wheelbase than the Sonata (112.2 versus 111.8 inches), and its track is wider, by more than an inch when you compare some trim levels. Currently it comes only with the 180-horsepower, turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine that powers the Sonata SEL Plus and Limited trim levels. Though the eight-speed automatic transmission is the same, the K5 has a traditional gear selector lever rather than the Sonata’s push-button controls.\n\nI tested two trim levels: the GT-Line (the red sample in the photos) and an EX (the blue). To understand the K5 lineup, you need to know what’s coming later this year: the K5 GT 2.5T. As the name suggests, it will have a turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine that will generate 290 hp — presumably comparable to the coming 2021 Hyundai Sonata N-Line.\n\nWait, a GT-Line Isn’t a GT 2.5T?\n\nUnfortunately, Hyundai’s use of “N-Line” only confuses things further, as Kia is using a different approach with the word “line.” The K5 GT-Line I tested is the middle of five trim levels, and it’s no GT 2.5T. Where Hyundai uses “N-Line” to designate its performance models, Kia’s use of “line” takes a page from German brands like Audi and BMW, who create sportier-looking trim levels that borrow from their top performance versions but aren’t necessarily more robust. For example, an Audi A5 with the S Line package might look like an Audi S5, but only the latter has the more powerful engine. Ditto for the Kia K5 GT-Line, which definitely looks sportier and has a flat-bottom steering wheel, but is otherwise mechanically identical to the other non-GT 2.5T trim levels. The performance goods will come later this year with the GT 2.5T, currently scheduled for November.\n\nNote that the base, LX, trim is typically stripped down to achieve its starting price of $24,455. It lacks push-button start, an engine immobilizer, a folding backseat and power rear child safety locks, and it’s not eligible for satellite radio. It includes Kia’s basic forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, but it doesn’t have rear cross-traffic alert with automatic braking or a blind spot collision avoidance system, both of which are standard on all other K5 trims. The LXS adds more standard features and eligibility for some options the LX can’t have, such as heated seats. Then come the GT-Line and EX I tested, of which the EX represents the greater increase in actual content — apart from the styling differences.\n\n2021 Kia K5 GT-Line | Cars.com photo by Joe Wiesenfelder\n\nI tested front-wheel-drive versions, but later this year Kia will begin to offer all-wheel drive on the LXS and GT-Line. Asked why AWD wouldn’t be offered on the EX, Kia representatives said it’s not out of the question, but for now the company is following the research, which said the middle of the lineup is where most demand will be.\n\nHesitate, Accelerate\n\nI had mixed impressions about the powertrain. The engine is fine in some respects; it’s impressive how much power and torque — 195 pounds-feet at 1,500 rpm — a tiny four-cylinder can provide, but with this small displacement and a turbo, some lag is inevitable no matter what technological steps are taken. I started noticing a consistent delay every time I stepped on the accelerator while already in motion, regardless of speed. Truly. Every. Single. Time. Ultimately I determined by watching the tachometer that the transmission would downshift before the car would accelerate, explaining the lag — something I’ve experienced in a couple other cars with small engines and high gear counts over the years. The gear ratios are close enough and the transmission refined enough that you don’t really notice the shift, but you can’t miss the time it takes before the car accelerates.\n\n2021 Kia K5 GT-Line | Cars.com photo by Joe Wiesenfelder\n\nJust to check myself, I switched to manual shifting using the gear selector (steering-wheel paddles come only on the GT 2.5T), and sure enough the delay vanished, but I had to choose a lower gear to accelerate appreciably. What’s all this about? Typically it’s the way the drivetrain is tuned for efficiency: The transmission picks the highest possible gear, and even a modest request for acceleration requires a downshift. The K5 has a drive mode selector knob on the console, and I found the Sport and Smart settings both cut back on the delay somewhat by holding onto lower gears in some cases, but of course these modes compromise gas mileage.\n\nReality check: Though these were both technically preproduction cars, they were pretty late preproduction and nicely buttoned up. Over the decades when we’ve raised concerns like these about transmission behavior, automakers (not necessarily Kia) have typically relied on the preproduction or “learning transmission” defense, which states, conveniently, that modern transmissions adapt to the driving styles of their operators, so it might just take a while for it to adapt (perhaps longer than we’re testing the car?). For the record, zero percent of those other-car transmission complaints magically vanished in later testing, with the exception of one Saturn that was recalled for reprogramming.\n\nIs this delay in the K5 something typical drivers will really notice? I suspect some will and some won’t. The best thing you can do is pay attention to it if you test-drive the K5. Also, know that the K5 GT 2.5T will have a different transmission altogether — an eight-speed dual-clutch versus the current conventional automatic with a torque converter.\n\n2021 Kia K5 GT-Line | Cars.com photo by Joe Wiesenfelder\n\nIf the delay I experienced is due to tuning, what does it get you? Tested in the normal drivetrain mode, the EPA-estimated fuel efficiency is 27/37/31 mpg city/highway/combined for most 1.6-liter front-drive trim levels; it’s higher, 29/38/32 mpg, for the LX. (The EPA hasn’t rated all-wheel-drive and GT 2.5T versions yet, but Kia predicts AWD will result in 26/34/29 mpg.)\n\nFor comparison, the most efficient 2021 Hyundai Sonata (a lower trim level with a different engine) gets 32 mpg combined, while higher trims powered by the 1.6-liter turbo are rated 30 mpg combined. The 2021 Accord ranges from 26 to 33 mpg combined, the 2020 Nissan Altima ranges from 29 to 32 mpg combined, and the front-drive 2020 Toyota Camry four-cylinder spans 31 to 34 mpg combined.\n\nThe K5 faces tough competition on gas mileage, but some of its rivals have continuously variable automatic transmissions, which aren’t anyone’s favorite for drivability. It might have been smarter for Kia to take the hit on mpg here in the land of cheap gas with more responsive transmission programming, and beat the others on drivability as only a well-executed step-gear transmission can.\n\nRide and Handling\n\nThe K5 rides nicely. It’s a reasonable mix of comfort and road feel that’s not trying to be too sporty — it leaves that for the coming GT 2.5T. Both my GT-Line and EX had 18-inch alloy wheels fitted with Pirelli P Zero all-season tires. LX and LXS trim levels come with 16-inch alloys, and the GT 2.5T will have 19s.\n\n2021 Kia K5 EX | Cars.com photo by Joe Wiesenfelder\n\nHandling is a similar story: competent, but not thrill-inducing. Again, the full GT is likely to be the one to watch for that, because it will have a sport-tuned suspension and its power-assist motor mounted to the steering rack rather than the column, which is generally accepted as a superior placement for feedback and performance.\n\nThe GT will also have larger brake discs, front and rear, which seems wise given the additional power. For what it’s worth, though, I found the brake pedal feel in the K5s I drove to be a welcome break from the many by-wire braking systems I’ve encountered lately. It was wonderfully linear and easy to modulate. Is it the conventional vacuum-boosted type? Yep. Did I prefer it? Sure did.\n\nIn the Cabin\n\nHow you react to the K5’s interior might depend on which one you enter. The GT-Line is so sportified on the outside I was a little let down by the inside. Apart from the flat-bottom steering wheel and identified seats, not much is special about it; it looks like a mid-level cabin — which, of course, it is. Entering from the LXS’ more modest exterior, or finding the more lush interior of an EX, might not evoke the same disappointment.\n\nThat’s not to say it’s bad. The materials are pretty nice, and the GT-Line had the smaller 8-inch touchscreen, which, as I explain below, is actually superior. The K5 doesn’t offer leather upholstery. The two lowest trim levels have manual cloth seats, the GT-Line adds a power driver’s seat and mixes cloth with leatherette (imitation leather), and the EX and GT 2.5T go full leatherette, though with separate designs. The front passenger seat has a standard height adjustment, which is nice to have (and no guarantee in today’s market). Power adjustment is optional on the EX and GT 2.5T.\n\nI found the driver’s seat to be comfortable, with exceptional seat travel — always nice for long-legged drivers. At 6-feet tall I didn’t even sit all the way back. When I raised the seat all the way, my head (not just my hair) contacted the roof alongside the panoramic moonroof, which is optional on the GT-Line and standard on the two highest trims.\n\nThe backseat’s outboard positions are also roomy and comfortable. I had about an inch of headroom to spare, and my knees were raised only a little bit by the height of the floor — an improvement over the Sonata. The center position, however, wasn’t usable by someone of my height, as my head was pushing into the ceiling. (I’ve found adequate headroom in many center rear seats, including in smaller size classes.) By the numbers, the K5’s backseat legroom is better than the Sonata’s by almost a half-inch, and it feels like it, but the Accord and Camry are both several inches roomier (see the specs side by side). The specs also show the Kia shy of backseat headroom versus the Sonata and Camry, but the Accord is listed as having 0.2 inch less.\n\n2021 Kia K5 GT-Line | Cars.com photo by Joe Wiesenfelder\nUsability and Those Touchscreens\n\nBoil it down and usability includes everything from conventional controls to what’s often minimized as the “multimedia system.” Overall, Kias can be as no-nonsense as any vehicle, depending on your perspective. A lot of folks think push-button transmissions are nonsense, so chalk one up for Kia, which uses a standard lever. Similarly, the K5’s standard issue controls are all mechanical push buttons, switches and knobs rather than touch-sensitive capacitive panels (aka, cost-saving nonsense). Drive modes can be changed via a rotary knob on the center console that you don’t have to look for — or at — in order to operate. All good.\n\n2021 Kia K5 EX with Premium Package | Cars.com photo by Joe Wiesenfelder\n\nRemote controllers with separate displays are often nonsense, but Kia went with a standard 8-inch touchscreen supported by a volume knob, a tuning knob and more mechanical buttons, along with one of the first standard wireless applications of Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Great, right? Right. My EX, however, was equipped with the optional 10.25-inch touchscreen system. In the words of Hannibal Lecter, “No no no, you were doing fine … ”\n\n2021 Kia K5 EX with Premium Package and wired Android Auto | Cars.com photo by Joe Wiesenfelder\n\nRight off the bat, this system eliminates the tuning knob, which bothers some people. It trades real buttons for capacitive ones, which bothers us. It sacrifices wireless CarPlay and Android Auto, reverting to the wired versions, for a screen that’s larger — or is it? Screens are measured diagonally, and if you bother to measure for yourself, as I did, you’ll find that the standard screen is 7 inches wide by 4 inches high. The optional screen’s image area is 9.5 inches wide but only 3.6 inches high. If you pay any attention to such things, you realize that display height is more important than width in many important areas, including mapping, backup camera views and definitely Android Auto, which gets only the left two-thirds of this screen rather than the whole one in the standard system. Android Auto users will probably conclude that this “upgrade” is actually a net loss.\n\n2021 Kia K5 GT-Line with standard touchscreen and wireless Android Auto | Cars.com photo by Joe Wiesenfelder\n\nIn fairness, though, wireless Android Auto is no bargain, in my opinion. You’re spared the unfathomable inconvenience of plugging a cord into your phone, but AA puts your phone to work, and you’re likely to leave the car with less battery life than you started out with if you don’t plug it in. I used the K5 EX’s wireless charging pad, and it still slowly lost its state of charge while my Samsung Galaxy S10 routed me and played SiriusXM. Even powerful wireless charging pads typically result in slower charging than the cord method, as we recently illustrated. (Kia’s claims of increased charging rates and a dedicated cooling fan both fell flat.) The same scenario when instead plugged into one of the K5 EX’s USB charging ports did increase the phone’s state of charge, though not by much. If you’re going to plug in anyway, you can live without a wireless smartphone interface.\n\n2021 Kia K5 GT-Line | Cars.com photo by Joe Wiesenfelder\n\nThere’s plenty wrong with the K5’s touchscreen “upgrade,” but the loss of wireless CarPlay and Android Auto isn’t it — it’s everything else detailed above. I should mention that the system also adds proprietary voice control, but I’ve never been one to control machines via voice, so I struggle to see the value. Your results may vary. Unfortunately, this feature isn’t a stand-alone option but rather part of the Premium Package ($3,400). If you want to avoid the touchscreen “upgrade” and stick with the 8-inch touchscreen, you’ll have to forgo Bose premium audio, a power front passenger seat, memory driver’s seat and outside mirrors, a heated steering wheel, the excellent Highway Driving Assist, Safe Exit Assist, rear parking collision avoidance and more.\n\nWithout the Premium Package you’ll also miss out on Active Sound Design, which augments the engine sound through the stereo, ironically making my tamer-looking K5 EX sound sportier than the sporty-looking GT-Line. What it didn’t do, however, was sound at all different when I changed the selectable settings. Kia later explained the differences are greatest under heavy load and high rpm (not my driving circumstances), and that the effect will be stronger in the GT 2.5T.\n\n2021 Kia K5 EX with Premium Package | Cars.com photo by Joe Wiesenfelder\nShould You Buy a Kia K5?\n\nEven if you skip the stripped LX trim level, the K5 is nicely equipped for the price, coming in at $25,455 for the LXS, $26,355 for the GT-Line and $28,955 for the EX, including destination charges. Once available, AWD will add $2,100 to the LXS and $3,700 to the GT-Line. These prices seem a bit steep considering Toyota’s AWD is $1,400 across the board, but the price increase includes features beyond AWD. For example, the LXS also adds heated seats and telematics to enable remote engine start, presuming the car will be used in cold climates. The GT-Line with AWD includes the Premium Package, which would be a $1,600 option with FWD. Kia’s warranty remains tops with five-year/60,000-mile bumper-to-bumper and roadside assistance coverage and a 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain plan.\n\nThe fact that Americans are more interested in SUVs hasn’t made mid-size sedans less competitive with each other; it’s actually the opposite. Any of the surviving models can do the job, but you have to check several out to gain perspective and determine what matters most to you. For example, the K5’s upgraded touchscreen system is essentially what I experienced in the redesigned Sonata; my frustration with it didn’t grow until Kia gave me the standard system in the K5 GT-Line. There’s a lot to like in the K5, and only if you experience it will you know if my hangups detailed above are ones you share.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nKia says the update of its 2009 Optima was an effort to spice up the car’s styling. To that end, the midsize sedan’s face has been thoroughly freshened, though its tail remains much the same. Revised engines add some power, but it remains to be seen whether these changes will help the Optima go head-to-head with a Toyota Camry or Honda Accord.\n\nThe Optima hits dealerships in late 2008; trim levels include the base LX, uplevel EX and sporty SX. A four-cylinder engine is standard, while a V-6 is optional.\n\nExterior\nThe Optima’s new face seems derivative of a lot of other cars — the headlights look like a Toyota Camry’s, while the interplay between the grille and lights recalls a similar pattern on the new Honda Accord.\n\nOverall length is up a couple inches over last year’s model, and most of it has been added to the car’s front overhang. Sixteen-inch steel wheels come on the four-cylinder Optima LX, while other trims have 16-inch alloys. The Optima SX has 17-inchers, along with a sport-tuned suspension, darker headlights, and turn signals integrated into the side mirrors.\n\nInterior\nKia didn’t alter the Optima’s interior as much as it did the exterior; the most notable change is probably the gauges, now framed inside three binnacles instead of a one-piece display. The stereo has an auxiliary jack for MP3 players, and a navigation system is optional for the first time.\n\nThe Optima LX comes with cloth seats, while the EX steps up to leather. SX trims have electroluminescent gauges, custom leather seats and metallic trim.\n\nUnder the Hood\nBoth the Optima’s engines have been upgraded, and Kia says gas mileage stays about the same. The 2.4-liter four-cylinder makes 175 horsepower, up from 162 hp last year; the 2.7-liter V-6 is up to 190 hp from 185 hp last year. A five-speed manual transmission is standard with the four-cylinder, while a five-speed automatic is optional. The V-6 gets only the automatic.\n\nSafety\nActive head restraints, side-impact airbags for the front seats and side curtain airbags for both rows are standard. Unfortunately, antilock brakes, an electronic stability system and traction control are grouped together in an option package; the Accord and Sonata include those features standard.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nKia’s midsize sedan, built from the same design as the Hyundai Sonata, is a lower-priced, lesser-equipped alternative to its Korean cousin and mainstays such as the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord. A four-cylinder engine is standard, while a V-6 is optional.\n\nNew for 2010\nPush-button start with a smart key is now standard on the sporty SX, V-6 models have a new blacked-out lower rear bumpers and an overhead interior light is standard on all trim levels.\n\nExterior\nOptima received a new face last year that seems derivative of a lot of cars — the headlights look like a Camry’s, while the interplay between the grille and lights recalls a similar pattern on the Accord.\n\nSixteen-inch steel wheels come standard\nOptional 16-inch alloy wheels or 17-inchers\nOptional sport-tuned suspension, darker headlights, and turn signals integrated into the side mirrors\n\nInterior\nOptima’s gauges are framed inside three binnacles instead of a one-piece display. The stereo has an auxiliary jack for MP3 players, and a navigation system is optional.\n\nStandard cloth seats\nOptional leather seats\nOptional push-button start\nCustom leather seats and trim for SX models\n\nUnder the Hood\nBoth the Optima’s engines were upgraded last year. The 2.4-liter four-cylinder makes 175 horsepower (13 more than previously), and the 2.7-liter V-6 makes 194 hp (a gain of nine).\n\nStandard five-speed manual transmission\nOptional five-speed automatic transmission\n\nSafety\nSafety features include:\n\nActive head restraints\nSide-impact airbags\nSide curtain airbags for both rows\nStandard antilock brakes\nStandard electronic stability system\nStandard traction control",

      "expert_review": "Optimally, I like to keep as much cash in my pocket as possible without compromising safety and comfort. I keep a delicate balance between the luxuries I desire and the fluff I’m willing to pay for. I’ll always gladly investigate any realistic cost-cutting measure that could amount to a small fortune (needed to keep my two children fed, clothed, schooled, entertained … and the list goes on). So, I wonder: How will the Kia Optima measure up in the automotive hierarchy? Will I expose the court jester masquerading as a member of the royal family, or a virtuous knight fighting for the greater good?\n\nI quickly learned that the Optima lives up to its tag line: “The power to surprise.” I noted the exterior’s sleek lines, and the coat of Cashmere Beige paint complemented the car nicely. Once inside, I admired the tastefully designed dash and driver controls. I stowed my sunnys in the overhead sunglass console and managed to house my 1-liter water bottle in one of the two front cupholders (amazing, considering I could barely get said Nalgene into the cupholder of the gas-guzzling behemoth I tested a few weeks earlier). I also made use of a clever 7-inch-wide by 5.5-inch-deep compartment in the dash that was perfect for the book I was toting. I’m continuously baffled by how few cars make resourceful use of the dash regarding additional storage space. I for one prefer to keep my indispensable planner or the occasional book (which I delude myself into thinking I will actually read) in a space other than the center console, which in my case is usually littered with cheese stick wrappers, loose raisins, soggy cheesy bunnies and other too-gross-to-mention kid-accompanying nastiness.\n\nAs I explored the Optima further, I was surprised to come across much of the frill that used to be reserved for higher-end vehicles. I enjoyed the five-setting seat heaters, the automatic headlight feature and the lovely moonroof. I was able to get good and comfy thanks to the eight-way power driver’s seat and the automatic pedal adjustment. Furthermore, I discovered sun visor extensions, an auto-dimming mirror and three HomeLink buttons (for garage door, lighting options etc.). My test car even came with Sport Mode, a feature that I, a multitasking mom, have no use for, but for those who desire that occasional manual transmission feel, it might be a good selling point.\n\nWhen packing for a weekend outing, I was pleased to find I could actually stow a great deal of stuff in the Optima’s trunk (including our loyal companion, the full-size stroller). If I required additional cargo space, there’s also a 60/40-split folding rear seat. While tinkering around in the back, the bright yellow trunk release button caught my eye as by far the most clearly labeled release I’ve seen so far – and anything that can potentially minimize a disaster is a safety bonus.\n\nI did uncover a few of the Optima’s shortcomings when I attempted to adjust the manual steering-wheel column. The lever is somewhat cumbersome to release, and while fiddling with the column the backs of my fingers brushed against the steering-wheel buttons. I couldn’t help but note that the plastic seems cheaply molded. Oh, and on the subject of cheap, I found the door handles to be of the blue-light-special variety, and the gearshift shares the same look. Lastly, while shifting lanes and glancing at the rather tiny side mirrors, I found myself wishing for greater surface area.\n\nI wasn’t expecting a regal-mobile when getting into the Optima, but I walked away feeling that, within a tight budget, the Kia is an optimal choice. It’s exciting to witness the shake-up of cars that used to be considered inferior, as they now surface with much of the glitter comparable cars offer, but at a fraction of the cost.\n\n*For more information on the Kia Optima and its safety features, visit www.cars.com.\n\nLET’S TALK NUMBERS\n\nLATCH Connectors: 2\n\nSeating Capacity (includes driver): 5\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair\n\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Some",
