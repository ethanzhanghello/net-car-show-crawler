      "expert_review": "One of the common criticisms leveled at auto writers is: “Why do you always have to review the most expensive model of every car?” The answer is pretty simple. The manufacturers want us to see all the options they offer, obviously in hopes of selling more expensively priced vehicles. Thus those are the cars they make available.\n\nAnother criticism is, “Why do you always have to be writing about luxury cars?” Well, we don’t. In fact, today we go as low on the economy line as you can and offer the Kia Rio, which boasts the lowest base price in the country, $8,595. The base version is what we’d have preferred to drive; unfortunately, this car, too, was “loaded” – or as loaded as a Rio can be, giving us air conditioning, an automatic transmission, floor mats, and an upgrade package that includes power steering, tilt wheel, dual vanity mirrors, wheel covers, and side moldings. It took the price to a whopping $11,784, including the $495 destination charge.\n\nSo, like a lot of things in life, we took the Kia as we found it. That meant no alarm system or power locks, crank-up windows, no cruise control, no outside temperature display, and no tachometer. But it did have the necessities – fuel and temperature gauges, a strong heater-defroster, a driver’s seat that could be adjusted to a comfortable driving position, hand-adjustable side mirrors, and rear-window defroster.\n\nThere were pleasant surprises, too, including intermittent wipers, trip odometers, and lots of storage cubbies and a couple of cup holders. And guess what? We found it to be an OK car, and then some.\n\nOurs came with more than 9,000 miles on the odometer. And, knowing my brethren in the motor press, it hadn’t been babied. Those miles actually said a lot because the suspension was still tight, and the car tracked straight and had no rattles. And it should stay that way. Kia knows the only way to crack the US market is by establishing a reputation of building dependable and affordable cars. In July, the company introduced its “Long Haul Warranty Program.” It consists of a 10-year or 100,000-mile limited powertrain warranty, a five-year or 60,000-mile limited basic warranty, a five-year or 100,000-mile rust-through warranty, and a five-year, unlimited mileage roadside assistance plan.\n\nOK, so what was the driving experience like?\n\nWell, the hamsters under the hood – actually a 1.5-liter, 16-valve, 4-cylinder engine with dual overhead cams – made a lot of noise under the hard acceleration required during the commute in and out of Boston. The power plant will produce 96 horsepower, but not until you get it turning at 5,800 rpm. Still, those hamsters got the job done, and didn’t make much noise at all when asked to produce at lesser speeds.\n\nThe four-speed automatic transmission had an on/off button to keep it from hunting between gears on hills, but we didn’t find that to be a problem.\n\nHandling was acceptable. The rear suspension is a simple torsion beam with coil sp rings, while the front is a MacPherson strut system. Fine for normal driving, but nothing to make the heart sing on a curvy country road. In short, what you’d expect from an ABC (A Basic Car).\n\nMy neighbors, who lined up rides the weekend we had a Bentley, didn’t turn up their noses at the Kia. After the inevitable, “What is it?” the usual reaction was, “It doesn’t seem to have a lot of personality.”\n\nAnd that was an accurate assessment. The unobtrusive Rio has a generic wedge shape with comfortable seating positions. You have the feeling of sitting a bit high, if anything. And it’s a car you wouldn’t mind being seen in.\n\nOne neighbor did ask for a ride, but it was because his car was out of service and he needed a lift.\n\nProducing a styling knockout wasn’t Kia’s goal. Making an affordable, high-quality vehicle was. With the Rio’s pricing and warranty, they’ve met that objective.\n\nSales seem to be following. Kia (that’s a company name, not an acronym) means to arise, ome up out of Asia. By 1999, Kia had dealerships in every state except North Dakota and sales across its line (besides the subcompact Rio, there is a Spectra hatchback sedan, Sephia compact sedan, Sportage SUV, and Sportage convertible SUV) had risen to 134,594 – up from 12,163 in 1994.\n\nFor the price, you get a new car with a great warranty for less than you’d pay for a lot of three-year-old cars. Forget the temptation to call it a bottom-feeder. It’s inexpensive, but it’s also a safe and serviceable vehicle that merits a look.\n\nSaying “you get what you pay for” seems like an unfair putdown of this vehicle. Actually, you get a bit more.\n\nWe were sitting around the kitchen table thinking of some folks who might buy his car, and we came up with a lot of possibilites. So has Kia.\n\n2001 Kia Rio\n\nBase price: $8,595\n\nPrice as tested: $11,784\n\nHorsepower: 95\n\nTorque: 98 lb.-ft.\n\nWheelbase: 94.9 inches\n\nOverall length: 165.9 inches>\n\nWidth: 65.9 inches\n\nHeight: 56.7 inches\n\nCurb weight: 2,297 lbs.\n\nSeating 5 passengers\n\nFuel economy: 25.2 miles per gallon\n\nSOURCE: Kia Motors America; fuel economy from Globe testing.\n\nLikes: A small thing, maybe, but even after 9,000 miles the wipers cleared a wide, clean swatch without leaving any streaks.\n\nAnnoyances: The gas pedal has a vibration and feels like it’s attached to a very long spring.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nFor 2002, a subcompact Rio wagon joins the front-drive Rio mini-sedan that debuted a year earlier as the least-expensive car in the U.S. market. On sale since summer 2001, the wagon is the least-expensive example of that body style sold in the United States, displacing the Suzuki Esteem, which held that title recently. Rio sedans switch from 13-inch to 14-inch tires for 2002, and a new power package is optional.\n\nSince its acquisition by Hyundai, another South Korean automaker, Kia has been coming on stronger than ever by expanding its passenger-car offerings. A brand-new midsize Optima sedan arrived in 2001, following the debut of the mini-sized Rio sedan and the Spectra hatchback version of the subcompact Sephia sedan, which has been around since 1994. Kia sold 98,256 vehicles in the United States during 2000, vs. 82,211 units in the previous year, according to Automotive News. This years new products, including the Sedona minivan, give the company a total of six models  quite a jump from the handful of Sephia sedans that began to trickle into the United States in the mid-1990s.\n\nKia provides a long-term warranty similar to that of its parent company. It covers the whole vehicle for five years/60,000 miles, major powertrain components for 10 years/100,000 miles and corrosion for five years/100,000 miles. Free roadside assistance is included for the first five years.\n\nExterior\nLed by what Kia calls an aero-look front end with memorable triangular taillamps at the rear, the Rio generally looks like a typical small sedan. Essentially, its based on the platform used by the Kia-built Ford Aspire of the mid-1990s.\n\nWith a 94.9-inch wheelbase and a 165.9-inch overall length, the mini-sized Rio is 9 inches shorter than the Spectra sedan, which is Kias larger subcompact. The four-door Rio sedan measures 65.9 inches wide and 56.7 inches tall, and its standard wheels have grown to 14 inches in diameter for 2002.\n\nInterior\nWith a claimed five-passenger capacity, the Rio has front buckets and a three-place rear seat. Still, its short wheelbase and modest width means the backseat could be tight for all occupants, except young children. The height-adjustable drivers seat has an integral armrest, but the rear seatback does not fold down for extra cargo volume. The trunk holds 9.2 cubic feet of cargo. Optional features include air conditioning, power steering, a cassette player and a tilt steering column.\n\nUnder the Hood\nKias 96-horsepower, 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine mates with either a standard five-speed manual or an optional four-speed-automatic transmission. Antilock brakes are optional, and side-impact airbags are not available.\n\nDriving Impressions\nThe Rio is not without its faults. However, Kias smallest model is a pleasantly appealing, surprisingly capable vehicle  a sizable cut above whats usually expected from small cars. With the manual shift, acceleration is eager if not exactly overpowering, whether that is during standing-start takeoffs or for passing and merging. Performance also is better than adequate with the automatic transmission, unless youre on a heavy upgrade, which can cause the Rio to struggle to maintain speed. Automatic-transmission shifts are generally quick and easy, but pushing hard on the gas pedal can produce a bit of awkwardness as the gears change.\n\nThe Rio shines brightest in ride quality, which is well-behaved and composed. Quick steering response yields a sensation of confidence thats not often found in such small cars. A certain amount of steering-wheel correction is needed on straightaways at higher speeds, but no more than in other vehicles of this sort.\n\nIts gauges are easy to read, but a tachometer is not included. Headroom is plentiful in the front seats. The backseat offers more space than many larger competitors, including the center-rear position. Because power windows are not available, occupants will have to do the cranking on their own. Radio buttons are bigger than in previous Kia models, though the lettering on the controls is still small. The Rios simple-to-use but effective air conditioner produces ample coolness on warm days.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2002 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Kia Rio?\n\nThe 2023 Kia Rio is one of the least expensive paths to new-car ownership. This front-wheel-drive, five-seat subcompact is available in sedan and four-door hatchback body styles, with an entry-level LX version for the sedan and better-equipped S trims of both the sedan and hatchback. Because the hatchback offers slightly more passenger and cargo space, we think it’s the smarter pick. Every Rio is powered by a 120-horsepower, 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine that’s paired with a continuously variable automatic transmission. Fuel economy is great, though acceleration takes (lots of) patience. The Rio’s competitors include the Nissan Versa and Mitsubishi Mirage.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Kia Rio?\n\nThe only change for the 2023 model year is a new warning light to inform the Rio’s driver if the engine is running low on oil. \n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Kia Rio Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nHeated side mirrors\nCloth upholstery\nAir conditioning\n8-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nSix-speaker stereo\nBluetooth connectivity\nPower windows\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n15-inch alloy wheels\nLED headlights\nRemote keyless entry\n60/40-split, folding backseat\nAutomatic air conditioning\nCruise control\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure steering assist\nRear-seat reminder\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nShould I Buy the 2023 Kia Rio?\n\nThe Rio is a terrific value, but there are some caveats. The entry-level trim lacks active-safety features like automatic emergency braking and forward collision warning; these and other safety systems are available on the S trim. Room in the backseat is tight for adults, and there’s only so much passing power the Rio’s fuel-sipping four-cylinder can muster. Still, in terms of getting a lot of car for your money, the Rio is a solid pick in a rapidly dwindling group of subcompact sedans and hatchbacks.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nIntroduced to the United States in July 2000, the South Korean-built Kia Rio sedan was touted as the lowest-priced car on the American market. Kia also launched a Rio Cinco wagon companion shortly before the 2002 model year began.\n\nBoth subcompact body styles were redesigned and gained some welcome power for 2003. The current 1.6-liter dual-overhead-cam four-cylinder engine generates 104 horsepower. Both models received new automatic-off headlights and optional front fog lamps. Kia claims that shoulder room and hip room are greater than the dimensions in previous models. A reinforced steering wheel and column mount were meant to produce less vibration. A larger front stabilizer bar was aimed to improve handling, while an enhanced suspension was installed to improve ride comfort.\n\nOther than the addition of lumbar support to the drivers seat, little has changed on the 2004 Rio sedan. With all of its models, Kia focuses on a blend of affordability and reliability. Kia provides a long-term warranty that covers the whole vehicle for five years/60,000 miles, major powertrain components for 10 years/100,000 miles and corrosion for five years/100,000 miles.\n\nExterior\nThe Rios front-end styling was reworked in 2003, and the sedans rear end got a new trunk lid, taillights and back bumper. Apart from that front and rear freshening, the 2004 Rio and Rio Cinco look about the same as the 2001 and 2002 versions and resemble a typical small sedan and wagon. The basic design evolved from the Kia-built Ford Aspire of the mid-1990s.\n\nInterior\nLast year, the Rio and Rio Cinco got additional standard interior equipment, including a fade-out interior light, rear-seat heater vents and LATCH child-safety seat anchors. The instrument panel and center console were updated to include new cupholders. The seat fabric was revised, and the front door panels feature map pockets with an integrated bottle holder.\n\nEven though five people can fit inside the Rio, it might be a tight squeeze in the backseat. Kia says the Rios seats are higher than normal and provide a commanding view for the driver and passengers. The height-adjustable drivers seat includes an integral fold-down armrest.\n\nPower windows and an AM/FM radio with a CD player are standard in the Rio Cinco and optional in the sedan. Air conditioning is also available as an optional feature.\n\nUnder the Hood\nKias 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine produces 104 hp. A five-speed-manual gearbox is standard, and a four-speed-automatic transmission is optional.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes are optional, but side-impact airbags are not available.\n\nRio Cinco\nExcept for its wagon body style, the Rio Cinco wagon is essentially the same as the Rio sedan. Rio Cincos gain standard alloy wheels and body-colored rear garnish for 2004. All drivers seats now have lumbar support. Cinco translates to five in Spanish, which denotes the number of doors on this Lilliputian wagon. The Rio Cinco is available in only one trim level. A body-colored rear spoiler is available. Maximum cargo volume is 44.3 cubic feet.\n\nThe Rio Cinco has front buckets and a three-place, 60/40-split, folding rear seat. A tachometer, cassette player, tilt steering wheel and power steering are standard.\n\nDriving Impressions\nEven more than the Rio sedan, the Rio Cinco wagon benefits from last years power increase. Most other features and characteristics regarding the Rio Cinco are pleasing. Its easy and fun to drive. On good roads, the ride is admirably smooth, and its handling isnt bad either. The Rio Cinco stays right on course by taking curves competently and maneuvering adeptly with quick steering response.\n\nThe seats are nicely cushioned, comfortable, well bolstered and attractively upholstered. The seat bottoms are considerably longer than what is customary in small cars. The gauges are clear and easy to read at a glance.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com;\nPosted on 11/5/03",

It became, with a sticker price on the base model of $10,570, the cheapest car offering six air bags — two in front, two on the side and two side-curtain bags.\n\nAnd it’s the second-cheapest car on the U.S. market, after the $9,455 2006 Chevy Aveo, according to www.autos.com.\n\nWith a better-than-anticipated ride and surprising roominess, it’s a solid choice for first-time or cash-strapped buyers.\n\nWhen I think about my first car, a 1981 Chevy Chevette, and remember its features (hardly any, and none good), this Rio feels luxurious.\n\nAs an aside, here’s what Eric Peters wrote in “Automotive Atrocities! The Cars We Love to Hate” (Motorbooks International, $19.95, 2004): “If you drove a Chevette when it was new, you were poor; if you got stuck with a used one as your high school ride, your parents were.”\n\nAnd I should note that aside from its impressive tally of air bags, the base-model Rio is still a pretty skimpy choice. That means no air conditioning, no stereo, no tilt steering and no split/folding rear seat.\n\nBut the Rio LX, the one that I drove, includes all that and more as standard, and it felt like a real bargain at its $13,295 base price (automatic transmission). Our tester, with an automatic transmission, options and freight, had a $14,905 sticker price. The new Rio is longer and wider than the previous model, and its longer wheelbase makes for a better ride. It offers the most passenger room (92.2 cubic feet) in the subcompact class, Kia says.\n\nThe trunk, at 11.9 cubic feet, is 29 percent larger than the one on the 2005 Rio, too.\n\nThe 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine found on all Rio models produces 110 horsepower and 107 pound-feet of torque. The previous Rio arrived as a 2001 model with a 96-horsepower motor.\n\nKia points out that the Rio has more oomph than rivals such as the Chevy Aveo, Scion xA and Toyota Echo. That’s true, but I should share with you that an all-new Aveo arrives in the summer and Toyota soon will replace the Echo with the Yaris. And, personally, I’d pick the xA over the Rio.\n\nOn the road, I found the Rio’s engine to be quite satisfactory. A bit loud perhaps, but it supplied ready and more-than-adequate power. The ride was acceptable, although the steering was a bit loose for my taste.\n\nThe best news might be the Rio’s improved fuel economy. It rates 32 mpg in the city and 35 on the highway with the standard five-speed manual and 29/38 with the optional four-speed automatic. That puts it right near the top of gasoline-powered small cars (along with the Toyota Corolla, Scion xA, Hyundai Accent and Honda Civic), according to the www.fueleconomy.gov Web site.\n\nThe design of the car is conservative, but rather stylish. There’s a cuteness about it that will appeal to some buyers. The body-color door handles are an upscale notion, and I even found the wide strip of black molding that flows from the doors to the rear of the car a nice touch.\n\nThe car’s interior features a simple, easy-to-use layout. The cup holders and various storage bins held what I carried in a proper way. And my ever-growing kids didn’t complain about the back-seat accommodations.\n\nBut our test model’s light tan interior already was looking a bit dingy after just 4,000 miles. Both of the front seats, covered with a perforated cloth, were slightly stained.\n\nU.S. buyers have been responding to the value and increasing quality offered by Kia. 2004 marked its 11th year of sales increases here.\n\nFor the record, Kia finished dead last (37th out of 37 automakers) in the J.D. Power’s 2005 Vehicle Dependability Study that measures the quality of 3-year-old cars and trucks. But it did better in the 2005 Initial Quality Study that measures the quality of this year’s cars and trucks, and its then-newest model, the Spectra, finished just behind the Toyota Prius as the highest-quality compact car.\n\n– – –\n\nContact Matt Nauman at mnauman@mercurynews.com or (408) 920-5701.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nRising gas prices may have many drivers grumbling at the pumps, but new-car buyers have a number of new fuel-sipping subcompact cars from which to choose. Kia’s offering in the segment is the Rio sedan and Rio5 hatchback, both of which have been redesigned for 2012 and are expected to get around 29/37 mpg city/highway. Competitors include the Ford Fiesta and Toyota Yaris. The Rio is scheduled to hit dealerships in fall 2011.\n\nExterior\nThe redesigned Rio incorporates design cues from the automaker’s larger Optima family sedan, including a chrome-ringed grille that leads to wraparound headlights, but the sedan’s trunk lid is relatively short. The Rio5 hatchback has a sleeker rear, finished with a forward-swept liftgate.\n\nValue-oriented LX trims come with 15-inch steel wheels, body-colored door handles and mirrors, and manual locks. The EX gets power locks and keyless entry. The top-line SX boasts 17-inch rims, fog lamps, LED daytime running lights and taillights, chrome exhaust tips and heated side mirrors with redundant turn-signal lights.\n\nInterior\nThe Rio’s cabin gets a makeover for 2012, and as with the exterior of the car, there’s a greater focus on distinctive design. Controls are within easy reach of the driver and thoughtfully arranged. With front bucket seats and three seat belts in back, the Rio theoretically has room for five people.\n\nLX models have a standard height-adjustable driver’s seat and a CD stereo with auxiliary and USB inputs. The midlevel EX has standard power windows with an automatic up/down feature for the driver, Bluetooth connectivity and a 60/40-split folding backseat.\n\nSX models add metal pedals, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, illuminated vanity mirrors, a trip computer, cruise control, and Kia’s Uvo communication and entertainment system that incorporates a backup camera. SX models can have the optional Premium Package, which includes a navigation system, push-button start, heated front seats, leather upholstery and a moonroof.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Rio has a 138-horsepower, 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine that teams with a six-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission.\n\nAn auto-stop feature is optional for the four-cylinder. Included with the Eco Package, auto-stop shuts the engine off automatically when the Rio comes to a halt, restarting when the brake pedal is released. With this system, city gas mileage is expected to increase by 1 mpg. The engine also features direct injection, an uncommon technology in this class.\n\nSafety\nStandard safety features include antilock brakes, side-impact airbags for the front seats, side curtain airbags and an electronic stability system that is required for 2012.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nIntroduced for the 2001 model year, the South Korean-built Kia Rio sedan was touted as the lowest-priced car on the American market. Kia launched a Rio Cinco wagon companion for the 2002 model year.\n\nBoth subcompact body styles were redesigned and gained some welcome power for 2003. The current 1.6-liter four-cylinder generates 104 horsepower. A reinforced steering wheel and column mount were meant to produce less vibration. A larger front stabilizer bar aimed to improve handling, while an enhanced suspension was installed to improve ride comfort.\n\nChanges for 2005 are technical in nature and include an enhanced onboard diagnostics system and the adoption of LEV-II emissions standards.\n\nWith all of its models, Kia focuses on a blend of affordability and reliability. Kia provides a long-term warranty that covers the whole vehicle for five years/60,000 miles and major powertrain components for 10 years/100,000 miles. Redesigned Rios are expected to debut for the 2006 model year.\n(Skip to details on the: Rio Cinco)\n\nExterior\nThe Rio’s front-end styling was reworked in 2003, and the sedan’s rear end got a new trunk lid, taillights and back bumper. Apart from that front and rear freshening, the Rio and Rio Cinco look about the same as the early versions. The basic design evolved from the Kia-built Ford Aspire of the mid-1990s.\n\nInterior\nThe Rio and Rio Cinco got additional standard equipment in 2003, including fade-out lighting, rear-seat heater vents and LATCH child-safety seat anchors. The instrument panel and center console were updated to include new cupholders. Updated seat fabric was installed, and the front door panels gained map pockets with an integrated bottle holder.\n\nEven though up to five occupants can fit inside the Rio, the backseat is a tight squeeze for three. Kia says the Rio’s seats are higher than normal and provide a commanding view for the driver and passengers. The height-adjustable driver’s seat includes an integral fold-down armrest.\n\nAir conditioning, a CD player and power windows are optional. An upgrade package for the sedan includes power steering, a tilt steering wheel, a tachometer and vanity mirrors.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Rio’s 1.6-liter four-cylinder produces 104 hp. A five-speed-manual gearbox is standard and a four-speed-automatic transmission is optional.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes are optional, but side-impact airbags are not available.\n\nDriving Impressions\nEven more than the Rio sedan, the Rio Cinco wagon benefits from the 2003 power increase. Most other features and characteristics regarding the Rio Cinco are pleasing. It’s easy and fun to drive. On good roads, the ride is admirably smooth and its handling isn’t bad. The Rio Cinco stays right on course by taking curves competently and maneuvering adeptly, with quick steering response.\n\nThe seats are nicely cushioned, comfortable, well bolstered and attractively upholstered. In addition, the seat bottoms are considerably longer than what’s customary in small cars. The gauges are clear and easy to read at a glance.\n\nRio Cinco\nOther than its body style, the Rio Cinco wagon is essentially the same as the Rio sedan. Rio Cincos gained standard alloy wheels and body-colored rear trim for 2004. The driver’s seat now has lumbar support. “Cinco” translates to five in Spanish, which denotes the number of doors on this Lilliputian wagon. The Rio Cinco is available in only one trim level, and a body-colored rear spoiler is available. Maximum cargo volume is 44.3 cubic feet.\n\nThe Rio Cinco has front buckets and a three-place, 60/40-split folding rear seat. A tachometer, CD player, tilt steering wheel and power steering are standard. Back to top",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nEssentially mimicking the Rio5 SX hatchback, the SX sedan includes larger wheels and a sportier interior. The Rio sedan competes with other small cars, including the Chevrolet Aveo and Toyota Yaris. In addition to the new front-wheel-drive platform, the ’06 Rio’s engine produced slightly more horsepower than the outgoing car’s. Changes for 2008 include mostly modest interior changes.\n\nThe SX functions as the top trim level for the Rio, while base and LX sedans are also available. Each Rio has six standard airbags, including the usual frontal-impact devices, seat-mounted side-impact airbags and side curtain airbags.\n\nKia’s Rio5 hatchback is covered separately in the Cars.com Research section.\n\nExterior\nThe Rio rides on a 98.4-inch wheelbase and is 166.9 inches long overall. Kia says the only exterior change for 2008 is a redesigned wheel cover for the LX.\n\nCreated with a European-inspired exterior, the Rio features a black mesh grille and swept-back headlights. The bumpers contain black inserts, and black bodyside moldings are installed. The Rio’s profile exhibits what Kia calls a subtle wedge shape, with sculpted arches at each fender.\n\nBody-colored mirrors and standard 14-inch tires are installed. Options include 15-inch wheels, all-disc brakes, fog lamps and a rear spoiler. On the Rio SX, 16-inch alloy wheels can be installed. Mudguards, a front mask, a hood protector and wheel locks are among the available accessories. Power steering is standard only on the LX.\n\nInterior\nIncreased exterior dimensions translate to more interior capacity in the five-passenger Rio. In fact, Kia claims the Rio has greater interior space than the larger Honda Civic and Toyota Corolla (though it competes more directly with the cheaper Honda Fit and Toyota Yaris). The Rio has 11.9 cubic feet of cargo space. The Fit, a hatchback, has 21.3 cubic feet of cargo space (with all seats in the upright position), while the Yaris sedan has 12.9 cubic feet of cargo space.\n\nFor 2008, Kia has added an auxiliary input jack for MP3 players in the LX and SX. The cupholder design has also been revised, and there’s a new center gauge cluster and redesigned shift knobs for both the automatic and manual transmissions.\n\nStandard equipment includes variable intermittent wipers and a rear-window defroster. Additional features in the LX sedan include air conditioning, a CD stereo with four speakers, a tilt steering column and a 60/40-split folding rear seat. An optional Power Package for the LX adds power windows and door locks, remote keyless entry, heated power mirrors and door-mounted tweeter speakers.\n\nThe Rio SX also includes chrome dashboard accents, unique sport seat fabric and a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob with red stitching.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Rio’s 1.6-liter four-cylinder features variable valve timing and produces 110 horsepower and 107 pounds-feet of torque. Either a five-speed manual gearbox or a four-speed automatic transmission can be installed. Base models are available only with the manual transmission.\n\nSafety\nSeat-mounted side-impact airbags, side curtain airbags and front seat belt pretensioners are standard. All five seating positions get three-point belts. All-disc antilock brakes are optional on all but the base model. The standard brake setup includes front discs and rear drums.\n\nDriving Impressions\nAdding a few horsepower can make quite a difference in a small sedan. The prior Rio’s performance was decidedly modest, but this recently redesigned version is easily adequate, even with the automatic transmission. Although the engine emits considerable buzz and blare when pushed hard, it’s pleasantly quiet most of the time. Automatic-transmission reactions occur promptly and without any lurching or awkward gear changes. The manual transmission makes the Rio even more appealing for lively motoring.\n\nRide comfort is another plus. Even when the road surface gets rough, the Rio’s suspension absorbs many imperfections.\n\nSpace is another story, at least in the backseat. Legroom even in the outer positions is marginal when the front seat is moved appreciably rearward. Additionally, the hard rear seatback is reclined too far for true comfort. Still, headroom is passable and foot room adequate, and getting into the backseat isn’t too difficult. Despite short seat bottoms, the front seats are rather comfortable. Visibility is unobstructed.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nA sporty SX trim level joins the Rio sedan lineup for 2007. Essentially mimicking the Rio5 SX hatchback, the SX sedan includes larger wheels and a sportier interior.\n\nFor 2006, Kia redesigned its compact Rio to sit on a longer wheelbase and a wider track. In addition to the new front-wheel-drive platform, the ’06 Rio’s engine produced slightly more horsepower than the outgoing car’s.\n\nThe South Korean automaker says its entry-level Rio has a sporty, substantial appearance. The car was introduced at the 2005 North American International Auto Show in Detroit, and its emphasis is on overall value.\n\nThe SX functions as the top trim level, while base and LX sedans are also available. Few base models are expected to reach customers. Each Rio has six standard airbags, including the usual frontal-impact devices, seat-mounted side-impact airbags and side curtain airbags.\n\nKia’s Rio5 hatchback is covered separately in the Cars.com Research section.\n\nExterior\nLarger in every dimension but overall length, the redesigned Rio that debuted for the 2006 model year rides on a 98.4-inch wheelbase. It was wider and taller than its predecessor.\n\nCreated with a European-inspired exterior, the Rio features a black mesh grille and swept-back headlights. The bumpers contain black inserts, and black bodyside moldings are installed. The Rio’s profile exhibits what Kia calls a subtle wedge shape, with sculpted arches at each fender.\n\nThe Rio has an independent front suspension, a semi-independent rear suspension, and front and rear stabilizer bars. Body-colored mirrors and standard 14-inch tires are installed. Full wheel covers appear on the LX sedan, and power steering is standard only on that model. Options include 15-inch wheels, all-disc brakes, fog lamps and a rear spoiler. On the Rio SX, 16-inch alloy wheels can be installed. Mudguards, a front mask, a hood protector and wheel locks are among the available accessories.\n\nInterior\nIncreased exterior dimensions translate to more interior capacity in the five-passenger Rio. In fact, Kia claims the Rio has greater interior space than the larger Honda Civic and Toyota Corolla (though it competes more directly with the cheaper Honda Fit and Toyota Yaris). With 11.9 cubic feet of cargo space, the trunk is 30 percent roomier than the prior-generation Rio. The Fit, a hatchback, has 21.3 cubic feet of cargo space (with all seats in the upright position), while the Yaris sedan has 12.9 cubic feet of cargo space.\n\nStandard equipment includes an eight-way manually adjustable driver’s seat, variable intermittent wipers and a rear-window defroster. Additional features in the LX sedan include air conditioning, a CD stereo with four speakers, a tilt steering column and a 60/40-split, folding rear seat. An optional Power Package for the LX adds power windows and door locks, remote keyless entry, heated power mirrors, door-mounted tweeter speakers, twin map lamps and a holder for sunglasses.\n\nThe Rio SX includes chrome dashboard accents, unique sport seat fabric and a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob with red stitching.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Rio’s 1.6-liter four-cylinder features variable valve timing and produces 110 horsepower and 107 pounds-feet of torque. Either a five-speed manual gearbox or a four-speed automatic transmission can be installed. Base models are available only with the manual transmission.\n\nSafety\nSeat-mounted side-impact airbags, side curtain airbags and front seat belt pretensioners are standard. All five seating positions get three-point belts. All-disc antilock brakes are optional. The standard brake setup includes front discs and rear drums.\n\nDriving Impressions\nAdding a few horsepower can make quite a difference in a small sedan. The prior Rio’s performance was decidedly modest, but this version is easily adequate, even with the automatic transmission. Although the engine emits considerable buzz and blare when pushed hard, it’s pleasantly quiet most of the time. Automatic-transmission reactions occur promptly and without any lurching or awkward gear changes. The manual transmission makes the Rio even more appealing for lively motoring.\n\nRide comfort is another plus. Even when the road surface gets rough, the Rio’s suspension absorbs many imperfections.\n\nSpace is another story, at least in the backseat. Legroom even in the outer positions is marginal when the front seat is moved appreciably rearward. Additionally, the hard rear seatback is reclined too far for true comfort. Still, headroom is passable and foot room adequate, and getting into the backseat isn’t too difficult. Despite short seat bottoms, the front seats are rather comfortable. Visibility is unobstructed.",

      "expert_review": "The smallest cars on the market are getting less respect from U.S. shoppers these days even as the cars themselves are getting a lot more respectable.\n\nCase in point: the redesigned 2018 Kia Rio subcompact sedan and hatchback. It’s a little bigger, nicer to be in and drive, and even a little cheaper than the 2017 version. It’s a “real car” — small enough for urban parking and crowded streets, but capable enough to make a long commute or weekend road trip a pleasant experience. But the U.S. has always been a tough market for subcompacts, and they face stiff competition for attention these days from the more fashionable group of subcompact SUVs even though sedans and hatchbacks offer better handling, great efficiency and lower prices.\n\nIt was markets outside the U.S. that made a new-generation Rio the right move for Kia: It’s the brand’s best-selling vehicle worldwide, with 400,000 sold in 2016. It’s been particularly successful in Europe, so it’s no accident the new Rio has a European flavor in its new design and driving manners.\n\nThe redone 2018, which will go on sale later this fall, will offer three trims: a base LX, top EX and new mid-range S trim. The old top trim, the SX, is gone.\n\nI tested a new Rio in and around Baltimore, on cobbled city streets, freeways and rural roads, and at a Kia-hosted introduction. (Per our ethics policy, Cars.com pays for its own airfare and lodging at such events.) I drove the top-trim EX hatchback; lower trims and the sedan were available to view but not to drive.\n\nGrown-Up Looks\n\nWhile some subcompact cars try too hard to be cute or funky, the new Rio does its best to look like a grown-up compact car. New conservative, horizontal lines aim to make the car look longer and wider than it is (in fact, it’s only slightly longer, lower and wider than the 2017). The redone Kia “tiger nose” grille is stretched thin and wide, and the headlights pull away around the corners. Vertical side vents at the front bumper corners accentuate the Rio’s stance, and the new taillights and rear bumper also pull visually to the corners to add width.\n\nThe hatchback’s horizontal roof seems to blend best with the overall look. The sedan has a sleeker fastback roof, but it ends — as is the case on many so-small sedans — in a bustle that looks stubby and chopped-off. The grown-up look would be enhanced if the new Rio were fitted with the 17-inch wheels offered in Europe rather than the kiddy-car 15s (alloy on the EX) that U.S. models sport.\n\nThe Euro-horizontal theme continues inside with a simplified dashboard that extends wide and low, enhancing the little Rio’s feeling of space. While the bare-bones base model is, as expected, loaded with molded plastic, its cloth upholstery seems durable. S and EX trims bring better materials and textured plastic, and the look and feel of the cloth upholstery is an improvement over the 2017, better rivaling the competition. The vehicle I drove was an EX Launch Edition, which had upgrades like red leather accents ($500). It was a cut above the others and is worth considering, though Kia says availability will be limited to 1,000 cars.\n\nUnexpected Comfort\n\nThe Rio cabin proved unexpectedly comfortable for a long day in a subcompact car. Kia said it worked to make the new Rio’s cabin more comfortable and less fatiguing for commuting and trips. The front seats — a weak point in the past model — have more cushion and better support. And there are enough adjustments in the EX to find a just-so position, including a height-adjustable driver’s seat, long seat travel and a telescoping steering wheel. Note, however, that achieving this perfect fit for a 6-foot-2 driver pretty much eliminated the usefulness of the already-tight backseat.\n\nSound levels aren’t whisper-quiet, but they’re far below the fatigue-inducing levels you find in some rivals, even in rainy conditions that increased road noise. The engine is quiet at idle thanks to new mounts, and while it gets buzzy when pushed, it didn’t intrude at cruising speeds thanks to gearing that keeps it below 2,000 rpm at 55 to 60 mph. Kia also added extra bracing in the hatchback’s rear floor that did a good job of cutting the open-cabin drumming you hear in many hatchbacks.\n\nStable and Confident\n\nThe Rio rides on a new, stiffer platform with a new suspension. The combination gives it a solid, stable feel despite its city-car size and weight of about 2,700 pounds. The ride is firm and sometimes a little choppy, but never harsh or fatiguing, and cornering is controlled. You feel the bumps but aren’t battered by them.\n\nThe overall effect is composed, even when pushed around in poor weather conditions that would have you biting your nails in many subcompacts. Kia says the suspension tuning — struts in front and a cost-saving semi-independent torsion beam in the rear — was dialed back a bit in firmness for U.S. roads, but not as much as for Asian markets. Stopping power was strong and linear in the EX test car, which had disc brakes all around. For 2018, LX and S trims get drums in the rear.\n\nA revised 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine provides sufficient punchiness in traffic and seems well-matched with the six-speed automatic transmission. (A six-speed manual is available but only on the base LX). The transmission shifted smoothly, if not always crisply, and willingly downshifted to deliver power as needed — more so in the EX’s Sport mode — such as when a driving partner had to get around a semi on a slight grade at 65 mph. Overall, the Rio delivers an experience that plays above its size and price and is more engaging than most rivals, such as the Nissan Versa — though it’s not quite up to Ford’s feisty Fiesta.\n\nRevisions to the four-cylinder engine drop horsepower by 8, to 130 hp, and torque by 4 pounds-feet, to 119, though Kia says power delivery now is better than the 2017 at lower engine speeds. New tuning also squeezes out slightly higher fuel economy than in 2017: Ratings for 2018 are 29/37/32 city/highway/combined for manual models and 28/37/32 mpg for automatics. Compare those with 2017 here.\n\nThe new estimates put the Rio’s combined rating ahead of some rivals, such as the Fiesta, but it’s still short of fuel-miser leaders like the Honda Fit and Versa. Compare those cars’ automatic-equipped versions here.\n\nA Little Urban Hauler\n\nKia sees the hatchback, expected to be about a third of sales, as a practical choice for a young buyer’s one and only car. If its specifications are correct, the hatchback will be a class leader with a useful 17.4 cubic feet of space for gear behind the backseat, or 32.8 cubic feet with the 60/40-split folding rear seat down (it’s standard on all hatchback trims). That utility is boosted by a bigger, wider liftgate and a new rear suspension that makes for a wider, flatter load floor. Hauling ability and space is as good or better than the competition; even the otherwise roomier Fit has just 16.6 cubic feet behind the backseat.\n\nIf maximum cargo-hauling ability is a top priority, however, know that the Rio (along with most subcompact hatchbacks) doesn’t come close to the Fit’s class-above 52.7 cubic feet of space with the seats folded, not to mention it’s Swiss Army-knife configurability, with a rear seat that flips up and a seatback that folds down, plus a front passenger seat that can recline flat.\n\nTrunk space in the sedan is 13.7 cubic feet. (Note that that’s not directly comparable to the hatch’s rating because the measuring standard is different.) That’s competitive with subcompact sedan rivals and only about a cubic foot less than the Rio’s bigger compact sibling, the Kia Forte. The sedan’s S and EX trims have a 60/40-split folding rear seatback to add cargo space. The backseat in the base sedan does not fold.\n\nShop Carefully for Tech Needs\n\nThe rule for tech features in subcompact cars is to never assume they’ll be there —  even relatively common technology. The base Rio LX is no exception, offering a 5-inch display, AM/FM/satellite radio capability, USB and auxiliary ports, and 12-volt power, but no Bluetooth technology, no backup camera and no keyless entry. Moving up to the S adds those features, plus USB charging for the rear seat, though not smartphone integration.\n\nThe top, EX trim, however, weighs in with a crisp, good-looking 7-inch touchscreen that sits tablet-style atop the dashboard at a height that’s easy to see and reach. It’s powered by Kia’s latest user-friendly UVO infotainment system, which is fast and includes Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration as well as Kia’s UVO app-based services. Built-in navigation is no longer an option, but the system does have a pair of tweeters for decent six-speaker audio. The center console also includes a very convenient, soft-surface shelf above the connections to stow your phone while you’re on the road.\n\nSafety\n\nThe 2018 Rio does not yet have NHTSA crash-test ratings. Kia officials said it has added more high-strength steel and a revised structure to target top safety ratings in Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and federal crash tests, though achieving those has generally proved difficult for cars this size. The 2017 Rio got the top rating of good in three of IIHS’ five crash tests, but rated acceptable in the side crash and just marginal in the small overlap front test. See 2017’s ratings here. If the 2018 is tested, its results will appear here.\n \nIn terms of safety technology, the Rio — significantly — adds a new low-speed front crash system with automatic emergency braking as standard equipment on the EX trim. Unfortunately, it’s not offered on cheaper models. Toyota leads in this technology, having it standard on its Yaris and Yaris iA small cars, and Honda has it in at least an option package on all Fit trim levels.\n\nValue\n\nEvery dollar counts for price-sensitive buyers looking for the cheapest ride with a new-car warranty. Kia boosted its value proposition for such buyers by lowering base prices for the improved Rio to more competitive levels. The 2018 manual LX sedan starts at $14,795, down a little from 2017, and the base Rio hatchback starts at $15,095, which is down a lot. (All prices include destination charges.) The 2017 Rio sedan started at $15,060 and the hatchback at $16,390. All Rios come with Kia’s five-year/60,000-mile bumper-to-bumper warranty, plus 10 years or 100,000 miles for the powertrain.\n\nThat entry price is important, because, unlike a lot of vehicles, a chunk of Rio sales are the bare-bones model. One Kia official said people even come to dealers asking if they have one without a radio.\n\nEven the lowered 2018 pricing leaves the Rio undercut by an entry-level 2017 Ford Fiesta sedan ($14,535) and hatch ($14,835), as well as a 2018 Nissan Versa sedan ($12,875). But it’s below some others, including entry four-door hatchbacks like the 2018 Honda Fit ($17,065), 2018 Nissan Versa Note ($16,365) and 2018 Toyota Yaris ($17,665). A wildcard competitor for the 2018 Rio is a new 2018 Accent subcompact coming from its corporate cousin, Hyundai, though Hyundai has dropped the hatchback and will offer only a sedan.\n\nThe Rio’s value for its price actually rises versus rivals as you climb up its trim levels. The more attractive new S trim, which adds such basic features as power windows, a center bin and armrest, and a backup camera, starts at $16,995 for the sedan or $17,295 for the hatch. The top-level EX — well-equipped with a 7-inch multimedia system, nicer upholstery, safety tech and other features — starts at $19,295 for the sedan or $19,595 for the hatch. There are Rio rivals that are better for specific needs, such as having performance options (Fiesta) or SUV-like utility (Fit). But the Rio holds its own as a good combination at its price of styling, a decent driving experience and cabin comfort.\n\nThe Rio’s toughest competition for value, however — at least for more adventurous buyers — may be Kia’s own tall and boxy 2018 Soul, which has similar urban parking dimensions, more rear-seat space and more utility, plus a dose of funkiness, starting at just $16,995.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe 2016 Kia Rio subcompact sedan and hatchback get a fresh new face and lightly revised interior.\n\nExteriorThe new Rio has a more sophisticated look with a restyled, narrow grille that brings it in line with the Soul and Optima, more angular headlights and additional satin-finish trim. In back, there’s redesigned taillights pushed farther to the corners for a more dynamic look. Two new colors, Urban Blue and Digital Yellow, join the color palette for 2016.\n\nInteriorKia says the Rio should be quieter thanks to additional high-density foam inside. Other interior highlights include more satin-finish trim on the control panel and a new shiny black center stack surround.\nSedan and hatchback models will again be available in LX, EX and the top-line SX trim; the new EX Designer Package offers interior upgrades like black cloth seats with gray leatherette trim, along with gray padded door panel inserts and gray stitching on the steering wheel, center console armrest and shifter. The Eco Package, which returns for 2016, now includes the updated UVO multimedia system and a backup camera.\n\nUnder the HoodRio powertrains carry over for 2016. The 138-horsepower, 1.6-liter four-cylinder pairs with a standard six-speed manual transmission on the sedan. A six-speed auto is standard on the hatchback; Kia no longer offers a manual for the hatchback.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in May 2012 about the 2012 Kia Rio. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2013, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nEditor’s note: Estimated mileage ratings have been lowered to reflect a November 2012 EPA audit of this car’s stated mileage.\n\nUp against elevated gas prices, car shoppers should take comfort in the fact they don’t have to pay a premium for a hybrid to save money at the pump. There’s a new crowd of subcompact and compact cars that are fuel-efficient, start below $15,000 and dispel some outdated notions about small cars. Available in sedan and four-door hatchback body styles, the 2012 Kia Rio is one of these cars. I tested the hatchback, which is called the 5-Door. The sedan is covered separately.\n\nWith its redesign, the 2012 Kia Rio 5-Door goes from basic transportation to a refined subcompact that’s appealing for more than just practical reasons.\n\nThe Rio 5-Door starts at $14,350 including a $750 destination charge, but our well-equipped SX trim level’s as-tested price was $20,745 and included upscale features like a navigation system and heated leather seats. To see how the Rio 5-Door’s specs compare with the Ford Fiesta, Chevrolet Sonic and Honda Fit, click here.\n\nStyling\nJust as it’s likely that a redesigned model will produce more horsepower than its predecessor, it’s also a safe bet that its styling will be more aggressive. The Rio 5-Door follows this trend, and the result is a small hatchback with the face of an angry dragonfly. Bulbous headlights border a pinched upper grille.\n\nFor a subcompact car, the Rio 5-Door has a great stance. While some of its competitors’ height is overly emphasized by a narrow track (the distance between left and right wheels), the Rio 5-Door looks wide by comparison. It’s not the widest car in this class, but it has one of the lower rooflines, contributing to its eye-pleasing proportions.\n\nFuel-Saving Features\nThe Rio 5-Door gets an EPA-estimated 29/37 mpg city/highway with the manual transmission and 28/36 mpg with the automatic. In addition to standard low-rolling-resistance tires and electrically assisted power steering, Kia also includes a selectable Active Eco mode on automatic-transmission models to squeeze more miles from each gallon of gas.\n\nWhen Active Eco is activated, the transmission upshifts sooner and downshifts later to keep engine rpm lower. It also tries to smooth gas pedal response. Although the system doesn’t lead to an official increase in the Rio 5-Door’s EPA gas mileage, Kia says Active Eco can improve fuel economy by up to 7 percent.\n\nFour-Cylinder Performance\nThere’s a downside to the Active Eco mode, and it’s a big one: Gas pedal responsiveness is severely diminished. It makes the car feel sluggish and takes away from the refined four-cylinder engine that powers this car.\n\nWith Active Eco turned off, a more accurate picture of the 1.6-liter four-cylinder emerges. It revs smoothly and offers adequate power. The six-speed automatic, which is optional on the LX and standard on the EX and SX, makes the engine look good, with quick kickdowns when you jab the gas pedal. At highway speeds, however, the four-cylinder’s passing power is pretty much exhausted.\n\nRide & Handling\nUnlike the other trim levels, the SX version is fitted with a sport suspension. Ride quality is taut and can be bouncy at times, but the car feels nicely planted, too. All versions of the Rio 5-Door have an independent front suspension and a semi-independent torsion-beam rear suspension. The electrically assisted power steering provides minimal steering feedback.\n\nCabin Roominess & Comfort\nFor a subcompact car, the Rio 5-Door feels relatively spacious up front. Unlike some of its competitors, you don’t feel like you’re crowding your front occupant’s personal space.\n\nUnfortunately, the front bucket seats compromise overall comfort. For one, the seat cushions are short. I’m 6-foot-1, so they didn’t provide enough thigh support, even though the legroom itself is good. Beyond that, the seats have a firm, boardlike feel that’s not conducive to comfort. Like other cars in this class, the Rio 5-Door’s backseat is tight for adults, as legroom is in short supply.\n\nUnexpected Amenities\nUpscale features are appearing in more new small cars, including the Rio 5-Door. Premium options include a navigation system with a 7-inch touch-screen and a backup camera, heated leather front seats, push-button start, power-folding side mirrors and Kia’s Uvo system for controlling cellphone features.\n\nSafety\nThe 2012 Rio 5-Door received a four-star (out of five) overall rating in National Highway Traffic Safety Administration crash testing, but its performance was marred by a Safety Concern warning in the side barrier crash test. In NHTSA tests, a Safety Concern highlights a situation that isn’t calculated into the star rating. While the Rio 5-Door received five stars for its overall side crash-test performance, in the side barrier test the rear door panel struck the backseat test dummy’s torso. This represents a higher likelihood of injury.\n\nThe Rio 5-Door has standard antilock brakes and an electronic stability system, features that are required on all new cars beginning with the 2012 model year. Additional standard features include side-impact airbags for the front seats, side curtain airbags and Vehicle Stability Management. Using the electric-assist power-steering system, VSM can make steering corrections to help the driver regain control in an emergency.\n\nFor a list of safety features check out the Features & Specs page, or to see how well child-safety seats fit in the Rio 5-Door see our Car Seat Check.\n\nRio 5-Door in the Market\nThe redesigned Rio 5-Door is a big step forward for the nameplate and is worth considering if you’re shopping for a subcompact. It follows a familiar path that Kia’s taken with other recent redesigns like the Optima sedan and Sorento crossover by offering a combination of standout design and value that’s too enticing to overlook.\n\nSend Mike an email",
