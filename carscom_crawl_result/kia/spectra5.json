      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nKia’s Spectra5 hatchback heads into 2008 with only minor changes, since it was restyled for 2007. It competes with several models in a growing market of small hatchbacks. Notable competitors include the Nissan Versa hatchback, the Honda Fit and the Mazda3 hatchback.\n\nEquipped with a sport-tuned suspension, the hatchback is meant to attract younger buyers. One version of Kia’s Spectra sedan, the SX, features equipment that’s similar to the Spectra5’s. The Spectra sedan is listed separately in the Cars.com Research section.\n\nExterior\nThe Spectra sedan and Spectra5 hatchback body styles are similar in appearance, but Kia promotes the hatchback’s “more extroverted personality [and] athletic stance.” Like the SX sedan, the Spectra5 features arches at each front fender and a sharp crease below the greenhouse. The sedan has a regular trunk, while the hatchback has a lift-up hatch. Their wheelbases are identical, but the sedan is about 6 inches longer overall.\n\nThe Spectra5 has what Kia calls an “assertive” front end, which features a black mesh grille. Fog lamps are installed. A strut tower bar provides additional torsional rigidity, and the Spectra5 has a fully independent suspension.\n\nInterior\nInside, there’s a center console with dual 12-volt power outlets and metallic dashboard accents. An auxiliary jack is included with the audio system for interface with iPods or other MP3 players, and a six-CD changer is optional.\n\nThe Spectra5 can seat up to five. The hatchback has a folding backseat that can expand cargo volume beyond the basic 18.3 cubic feet. A large rear opening on the Spectra5 hatchback makes it easy to load. A leather-wrapped steering wheel and gearshift knob plus metal pedals are standard.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Spectra5 is powered by a 138-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder that teams with a standard five-speed manual gearbox or the optional, revised four-speed automatic transmission. In five states, the Spectra5 equipped with Kia’s old four-speed automatic has an environmentally friendly SULEV rating, but that engine produces 136 hp.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes are optional. Seat-mounted side-impact airbags and side curtain airbags are standard.\n\nDriving Impressions\nManeuverability is a strong point for the Spectra5, which serves as a satisfying urban runabout. Unlike some small cars, it can be fun to drive and it easily heads wherever it’s pointed. Most drivers won’t try to push this hatchback too hard through curves, but it handles well for everyday motoring. On straightaways, the Spectra5 tracks well with little correction needed.\n\nRide comfort is reasonably good — slightly above average — for a small car. Performance with the manual shift is eager but not exactly action-packed. Except for some clanking, the gearshift behaves as adeptly as those in many sporty cars. The seats are softly cushioned but provide satisfactory support. Space behind the backseat is modest.\n\nThe engine is quiet in moderate driving, but it gets noisier while accelerating. Lower-body add-on components on the Spectra5 reduce the ground clearance of this hatchback, making it an unwise choice on snow-covered pavement.",

      "expert_review": "After driving around comparing cars for the past year, the Kia Spectra 5 is like having a plain vanilla ice cream cone; no nuts, no toppings, no cherry on top. There’s not much to this car and there’s nothing exciting to write about. I’m sorry to say it, but it’s just another car.\n\nThe only thing I can commend the Spectra 5 for is that it has accommodating headroom. My tall, long-legged husband doesn’t look like a sardine packed in its tin; he actually fits and is happy his shaved head doesn’t rub against the top of the car.\n\nAs for me, I can’t find anything particularly outstanding. The cargo space in the back is very small, just enough room to fit the stroller and not much else. The lack of cubbies and storage compartments has me piling junk on the passenger seat where it all slides off when I hit the brakes.\n\nOne thing Mother Proof mom reviewers have voiced strongly is the choice of leather seats over cloth. Sure, it’s less than pleasant when my skin sticks to it in the summertime, but the benefits out number the negatives. Like that fact that leather is super easy to clean; just wipe it down with a cloth.\n\nThere’s nothing worse than the smell of spoiled milk that has been fermenting in the cloth seats of a car. Trust me, I know this smell all too well. I deal with it every day I get into my own car, which has cloth seats. I’ve scrubbed it with those oxy cleaners and the smell returns. I’m going to have to cough up the money to get my car professionally cleaned to remove the stains of spilled milk. Why didn’t I get leather? Well, some cars just don’t offer it, like the Spectra 5. Be prepared for stains and strange smells when the kids infiltrate this car.\n\nThe controls for the music and AC are nicely organized in one area, all reachable from the driver’s seat. While there are six cupholders for this 5-passenger car, two of them are in the front doors (typical), two are in the center console (good) and two are in the back of the center console near the floor (not so good).\n\nSo, yawn, it’s just another car. Until I look at the price sticker and realize how affordable the Kia Spectra 5 is, not to mention its high gas mileage. Then I discover the quaint tissue holder in the center console. Ah, things are looking up. There’s nice space for a tissue box and plenty of room for some CDs and other stuff. OK, that’s a plus, but it won’t have me racing to the dealership to buy the car, even if I catch the sniffles.\n\n*For more information on the Kia Spectra5 and its safety features visit Cars.com .\n\nLet’s Talk Numbers LATCH connectors: 2 Passenger seating (including driver): 5\n\nIt’s the Little Things That Count Storage Compartments (puny, fair, ample, galore): puny Cargo/Trunk Space (puny, fair, ample, galore): fair\n\nSense and Style Family Friendly (not really, fair, great, excellent): fair Fun-Factor (None, some, good times, groove-on): none",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nKia’s Spectra5 hatchback, which is meant to attract younger buyers, is equipped with a sport-tuned suspension. A version of Kia’s Spectra sedan, the SX, features equipment that’s similar to the Spectra5; the Spectra sedan is listed separately in the Cars.com Research section. The Spectra5 competes with several models in a growing market of small hatchbacks. Notable competitors include the Toyota Matrix and Mazda3 hatchback.\n\nNew for 2009\nThe Spectra5 adds active head restraints that tilt forward in the event of a rear collision, greatly reducing the possibility of neck injury.\n\nExterior\nThe Spectra sedan and Spectra5 hatchback are similar in appearance. They’re both 68.3 inches wide, but the hatch is about 6 inches shorter at 171.3 inches long. The Spectra5 is about the same size as the Matrix, while the Mazda3 is a bit longer.\n\n16-inch alloy wheels\nBody-colored mirrors, handles and bumpers\nRear spoiler\nAutomatic headlamps\nPower heated mirrors\nOptional power moonroof\n\nInterior\nThe Spectra5 can seat up to five people. The hatchback has a folding backseat that can expand cargo volume beyond the basic 18.3 cubic feet to 52.8 cubic feet of cargo space. Passenger volume is 98 cubic feet, which makes the hatch slightly more spacious than the Mazda3 and Matrix.\n\nLeather-wrapped steering wheel and shifter\nMetal-finished trim and pedals\nAir conditioning\nPower windows and locks with remote keyless entry\nOptional six-disc CD changer\n\nUnder the Hood\nLike the SX sedan, the Spectra5 gets a sport-tuned suspension.\n\n138-horsepower, 2.0-liter inline-four with 136 pounds-feet of torque\nStandard five-speed manual transmission\nOptional four-speed automatic\n\nSafety\nSafety features include:\n\nSeat-mounted side-impact airbags\nSide curtain airbags\nActive head restraints\nOptional antilock braking system",
