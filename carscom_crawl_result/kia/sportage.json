      "expert_review": "The adage ”you get what you pay for” never was more true than for the Kia brand of vehicles from South Korea.\n\nYou don’t pay much for a Kia.\n\nAnd in terms of quality, you don’t get much, either.\n\nThe Sportage is the second Kia I’ve tested this year; earlier I spent a week driving the Sephia sedan. As with the Sephia, the Sportage has a very pleasing, contemporary appearance and a very respectable engine and transmission. Yet underneath the shapely metal lurks a host of hideous deficiencies that give the vehicle a resounding feeling of cheapness.\n\nIf you don’t mind paying less for a vehicle that delivers less, then you may not be bothered by a few rattles, soggy brakes, strange noises, parts that fit poorly, an occasional broken piece and cheap-feeling components.\n\nIf Kia engineers made a list of about 15 items to improve to Toyota standards, the Kia Sportage could be a very formidable competitor in the fast-growing minisport-utility segment.\n\nUntil then, I’m giving the Sportage two enthusiastic thumbs down.\n\nPERFORMANCE, HANDLING\n\nThe Sportage is outfitted with a 2.0-liter, 16-valve, four-cylinder engine rated at 130 horsepower. Our test vehicle came with a five-speed manual transmission. A four-speed automatic transmission is optional.\n\nMy first impression of the Sportage was a good one. I twisted the key, put it in first gear and was immediately surprised at the spunkiness of this small off-roader. It moves quickly in first and second gear.\n\nThen reality struck.\n\nAlthough the Sportage may be snappy at low speeds, it has little passing power once you get moving. Passing slower traffic on a highway must be a very calculated and well-timed exercise. Also, the double-overhead-cam engine objects loudly when revved up. You’ll hear a sound not unlike a chain saw when the tachometer needle reaches 5,000 rpm.\n\nBut the Sportage was generally easy to shift and drive in heavy traffic. The shifter and clutch work smoothly, and shifting the Sportage into four-wheel drive takes just a second or two.\n\nAlthough not particularly powerful, the Sportage has a semi-rugged, tough feel while slogging through soft sand in four-wheel drive.\n\nIthink Kia’s engineers did their best work with the Sportage’s suspension system. The vehicle has a good ride, one that reflects where it will be driven. Most minisport-utility vehicles rarely venture into the wild they are street machines.\n\nThe Sportage has double-wishbone front suspension and rear coil springs. The ride is soft but not wallowy, and the vehicle is stable when cornering. The Sportage remains easy to control over rough roads.\n\nBut the weakness of the power-assisted brakes undermines the competency of the suspension system.\n\nThese front disc, rear drum brakes are among the worst I’ve sampled recently. Step on them, and it’s as if the Sportage is riding on banana peels. They just don’t have much bite unless you really put your foot into the pedal.\n\nHowever, the power-steering system is good. The wheel turns smoothly, and it doesn’t take much effort to turn. The Sportage can turn a complete circle in a commendable 34 feet.\n\nWith better brakes and a quieter, more powerful engine, the Sportage would be a lot closer to offering the refined performance hinted at by its attractive styling.\n\nNot long after my test drive, Kia recalled the EX model Sportage to repair a faulty throttle cable. In some instances, the cable might stick, causing the engine to rev up.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nOur test vehicle came with only 1,900 miles on the odometer, yet its quality shortcomings were numerous – and aggravating.\n\nI have no reason to believe that the Sportage would break down and leave you stranded on the side of the road; the Sportage ran well during the week that I drove it. But I have plenty of reason to suspect that it would not hold up well over the long haul. Owning this vehiclem ght mean constant trips to the dealer to repair shoddy trim parts and other nonmechanical items.\n\nSome of the Sportage’s shortcomings stem from poorly designed parts, while others can be blamed on cheap components. For example:\n\nThe swing-out spare tire on the rear of our beige Sportage would not stop rattling. It appeared that the spare-tire holder would not completely latch closed. So I gave it a hard slam. Sure enough, the rattling stopped. But then the spare tire would not unlatch, so I could couldn’t open the tailgate. No amount of fiddling with the spare-tire holder would free it.\n\nThe fuse box is located on the kick-panel to the left of the clutch pedal. The plastic door would not stay closed, and I felt it every time I pressed the clutch pedal to shift gears.\n\nWind noise from the left-side mirror was loud.\n\nThere is no weatherstrip above the door that routes water away from the interior. When I opened the door after a rain, water poured in and soaked me.\n\nThe weather stripping on the fixed rear windows is poorly attached. A thief could easily remove it by lifting up on the upper corner. Then he could pull out the window and steal whatever is inside.\n\nThe turn-signal switch is the worst in the industry. It feels rubbery and flimsy.\n\nI could go on, but you get the idea.\n\nThe Sportage is not a high-quality vehicle. And that’s a shame, because it is very nicely styled. There’s also a decent amount of interior room, front and rear, and the seats are comfortable. Our Sportage also was well-equipped – it had cruise control and power windows, mirrors and door locks.\n\nPerhaps Kia will learn the same painful lesson that Korean automaker Hyundai did: Quality is the price of admission in the American market.\n\nTruett’s tip: The Kia Sportage has potential. It is a nicely styled vehicle with a decent powertrain. But the assembly is sloppy, the placement of some parts is poor, and the quality isamong the worst I’ve ever seen.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Kia’s updates to the redesigned 2017 Sportage touch every part of the compact SUV and leave it much improved.\n\nVersus the competition: The Sportage now is among the top contenders in its class, and to me is the best all-around vehicle of the bunch, combining a (dare I say) fun driving experience, plenty of cargo room and a comfortable interior.\n\nThe 2017 Kia Sportage went under the knife for a thorough redesign and emerges primed to take a spot among the most elite compact SUVs. The Sportage is Kia’s longest-running nameplate. This marks its fourth generation — and the best by a landslide. See the differences between the 2017 and 2016 versions of the Sportage here.\n\nCompact SUVs are a big battleground for automakers, with high sales figures and lots of choices for consumers. The Sportage competes against mainstays including the Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4 and Subaru Forester. Compare the updated Sportage against those models here.\n\nThere are three Kia Sportage trim levels: LX, EX and SX Turbo. The Kia Sportage LX and EX feature the base four-cylinder engine, while the SX Turbo gets a powerful turbocharged four-cylinder. I spent some time with both front- and all-wheel-drive versions of the SX Turbo to see how Kia’s updates shake out on the road.\n\nExterior and Styling\n\n\nThe exterior styling has changed all around, but most drastically up front where bulbous headlight clusters flank a version of Kia’s “tiger nose” grille. Although the new Sportage actually is longer by 1.6 inches, the changes do make it appear squatter than the previous model. The added stubbiness is not my favorite look, but take a look at our photos and decide for yourself.\n\nThere are plenty of standard exterior features, such as LED daytime running lights, 17-inch alloy wheels and a rear spoiler. EX models add 18-inch alloys, roof rails, foglights and heated side mirrors.\n\nThe SX Turbo trim I tested gets the most elaborate exterior styling, with 19-inch alloy wheels, a gloss-black finish on the grille, dual exhaust pipes and metal-finished front and rear skid plates that peek out under each bumper. It also features LED fog lights, bi-xenon headlights that swivel in the direction of a turn and LED taillights.\n\nHow It Drives\n\n\nThe 2017 new Kia Sportage has two engine options, both carrying over from last year. The base engine, found in LX and EX models, is a 181-horsepower, 2.4-liter four-cylinder. Our SX Turbo test vehicle came with a more exciting option under the hood: a 240-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder (237 hp in all-wheel-drive models). Both engines come only with a six-speed automatic transmission and take regular gas. The turbocharged engine is actually down about 20 horsepower, but it is more fuel-efficient compared with last year’s model. During driving however, I didn’t miss the extra power at all — the Sportage with the turbo is still properly quick.\n\nFront-wheel drive is standard, and all-wheel drive is optional on all three trim levels for $1,500. The AWD includes a 50/50 locking differential that sends equal power to the front and rear axles, as well as torque vectoring, which can move the power to the left or right wheels, whichever have  more traction. To test this, I put both of the passenger-side tires off the road onto gravel with only the two driver-side tires on pavement and then performed a hard launch. The Sportage pulled away quickly with impressive smoothness — there was no detectable wheel slip and no hesitation.\n\nInterestingly, I found the front-wheel-drive version to be the more engaging of the two; the all-wheel-drive version seems to lag a bit when it comes to initial acceleration, but once it gets going it can really scoot as well.\n\nOf course, none of this would really matter if the rest of the 2017 Kia Sportage weren’t sorted well — but thankfully it is. Our editors didn’t like the 2016 model’s steering, but Kia says the suspension and steering were updated with new parts and better tuning. It seems to have worked because I found the steering to be properly tuned and precise at all speeds. The ride was comfortable on straight highway stretches, but offered enough feedback in the bends to give the driver confidence.\n\nCompared with last year’s model, fuel economy figures have improved slightly in some cases and stayed the same in others. The LX gets an estimated 23/30/26 mpg city/highway/combined with FWD and 21/25/22 mpg with AWD. The EX is rated at 22/29/25 mpg with FWD and 21/25/23 mpg with AWD. Lastly, the SX Turbo is estimated at 21/26/23 mpg (FWD) and 20/23/21 mpg (AWD).\n\nThose figures represent a 1-mpg increase in combined mileage ratings for front-wheel-drive models from the 2016 model.\n\nThe new all-wheel-drive system lowers highway fuel economy on each trim level but boosts city mpg to give each trim a combined mpg rating that matches last year’s all-wheel-drive models — except for the EX, which increases by 1 mpg combined.\n\nInterior\n\n\nThe SX Turbo trim I tested is on the pricier side of the compact SUV segment, but I also found the materials quality matched the added cost. The front seats are very comfortable, with soft leather and slight bolstering; after a full day of driving I didn’t feel fatigued.\n\nOutward visibility with the old model was a sticking point among our editors, but it has been improved, thanks to thinner A- and C-pillars and more glass all around. Speaking of glass, a massive panoramic moonroof is available, and it was my favorite part of the whole interior. It is 4.1 inches longer than the previous model’s and really opens up the cabin nicely.\n\nThe backseat is very roomy, especially in headroom. The interior floor for the second row has dropped by 1.6 inches, and the rear-seat height also was lowered so there is a lot of space between head and ceiling, even with the optional moonroof installed.\n\nStandard features include Bluetooth connectivity (both phone and audio) and a USB port up front. The EX adds dual-zone automatic climate control, a rear USB charge port, push-button start, heated seats and leather upholstery. Jump up to the SX Turbo and the features list lengthens even more, adding standard ventilated front seats, Harman Kardon sound system, navigation, an auto-dimming rearview mirror and a heated, flat-bottom steering wheel.\n\nErgonomics and Electronics\n\n\nKia has made a habit of aiming the center control panel toward the driver slightly and the Sportage is no exception. Its center panel is canted by 7.2 degrees to the driver’s side, which makes controls easier to reach, even those on the far right of the screen.\n\nEach of the Kia Sportage’s three trim levels offers a different standard screen. The LX has the smallest, a 5-inch touchscreen, while the EX gets a larger 7-inch touchscreen. The EX also adds standard UVO3, the latest version of Kia’s infotainment system, and UVO eServices telematics. This system will include Android Auto at launch, while Apple CarPlay will be available starting in June/July, Kia says. For owners who bought a 2017 Sportage before that, Kia confirmed that the system can be updated to add CarPlay, either at a dealership or possibly via a flash drive. Upgrading to the multimedia system with navigation (standard on the SX Turbo) bumps you up to an 8-inch touch-screen.\n\nI like the approach Kia has taken with its eServices functions: They are subscription-free for 10 years. The system with a 7-inch screen includes 911 Assist, enhanced roadside assistance, vehicle diagnostics, parking location assist, and curfew and speed limit alerts that let parents keep tabs on young drivers. The upgraded system with navigation adds geo-fence (location) alerts and Google Local searches, which can locate points of interest on the screen like a Google Maps search.\n\nCargo and Storage\n\n\nThere are two added features for the cargo area for 2017: a “smart” power liftgate and a dual-level cargo floor. The power liftgate (standard on SX Turbo, optional on EX) now automatically opens if you stand behind the rear bumper with the key fob for more than three seconds, no kicking required. The dual-level cargo floor can lower the floor to open up more cargo room. Lift up the floor panel, slide it forward, then back and it will settle into a new position about 3 inches lower. I don’t see any particular reason that you would leave the panel in the higher position, unless you wanted the load floor to be perfectly level with the folded backseat.\n\nThe 2017 Kia Sportage has 30.7 cubic feet of cargo room behind the rear seats, which expands to 60.1 cubic feet with the 60/40-split bench folded down (both figures are with the cargo floor lowered). The rear license plate has been moved to the liftgate instead of the bumper, which Kia says drops the lift-over height for easier loading of cargo.\n\nCompared with the rest of the segment, the Kia Sportage does lag on cargo volume. The CR-V offers 37.2/70.9 cubic feet of storage and the RAV4 even more at 38.4/73.4 cubic feet.\n\nSafety\n\n\nThe redesign also expands the list of available safety technology on the 2017 Sportage, including blind spot warning, rear cross-traffic alert, lane departure, and front and rear parking sensors. A forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking also is new; it works at virtually all speeds — from zero to 112 mph, according to Kia — and comes with pedestrian detection as well. These new features are unavailable on LX, optional on EX and standard on the SX Turbo.\n\nA backup camera has been added as standard equipment.\n\nThe 2017 Kia Sportage earned the highest possible scores in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s crashworthiness and crash avoidance ratings. It is in good company, though: Five other models were rated the same, including the Hyundai Tucson, Mazda CX-5, Subaru Forester, Toyota RAV4 and Honda CR-V. A few more share the crash results but had lower-performing crash-avoidance options or lacked them entirely.\n\nAs of this writing, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration had not tested the 2017 version of the Sportage.\n\nClick here for a full list of safety features.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\n\nWhen I first read the Kia Sportage’s price tag, I was taken aback. Even if it’s a stellar compact SUV, it’s an expensive vehicle in SX Turbo form — base price starting at $33,395 (including destination). Want all-wheel-drive? Add another $1,500 to the price and you reach $34,895, which encroaches on midsize SUV territory.\n\nHowever, if you look at the body-type competition, the Sportage is much more competitively priced than it would seem. If you are looking for the new available safety features mentioned earlier, they can be added to the midlevel EX as a part of the Premium and Technology packages, which bumps the starting price up to $31,095. When I tried building competitors with similar criteria (front-wheel-drive, leather upholstery, forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking and built-in navigation), I was unable to beat that price. The CR-V offers the advanced safety features only on the Touring trim level, which starts at $32,995. The RAV4 with these features checks in at $33,180  (but also includes a bird’s-eye-view camera), and even the Mazda CX-5 is a lofty $32,125. Only the Forester is analogous at $31,790 with all-wheel-drive standard as well, but the Sportage is a better drive.\n\nFor those looking for something a bit more cost-efficient, there is the Kia Sportage LX. Outfitted with the Popular and Cool & Connected packages, which add heated front seats, dual-zone automatic climate control and the upgraded infotainment system with Android Auto/Apple CarPlay among other features, the LX settles in at $25,885 and is probably the one I’d choose.\n\nKia’s substantial powertrain warranty is also noteworthy, offering 10 years/100,000 miles of coverage.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nBesides a minor exterior tweak, the 2007 Kia Sportage is identical to last year’s model.\n\nDuring Kia’s early years in the U.S. market, the South Korean automaker offered two models: the Sephia sedan and the Sportage sport utility vehicle. A new Sportage debuted for the 2005 model year, joining the company’s larger Sorento SUV. Because Kia and Hyundai share corporate parentage, the Sportage is related to Hyundai’s Tucson.\n\nLonger in wheelbase than the original Sportage, the current model has a wider track and a more powerful standard engine. Larger and roomier than its predecessor, the Sportage is offered with front- or four-wheel drive in LX and EX trim levels.\n\nFor 2006, the Sportage received an improved spiral-type antenna and a standard air-filtration system. A tire pressure monitoring system became standard on the EX.\n\nExterior\nBuilt on a 103.5-inch wheelbase, the unibodied Sportage measures 171.3 inches long overall and 66.7 inches tall. Styling echoes the Sorento’s, and flared wheel arches help establish what Kia calls a “strong visual presence.” A horizontal-bar grille sits above a lower air intake. For 2007, the rear receives additional chrome trim.\n\nTwin roof bars are integrated into sloping D-pillars, which are outlined by black moldings. Alloy wheels hold 16-inch tires. Dual exhaust pipes are installed on V-6 models.\n\nGround clearance is 7.7 inches, and the Sportage has a four-wheel-independent suspension. A roof rack is standard. The top-hinged tailgate contains a flip-up window, and the spare tire mounts under the floor. Fog lights, bodyside cladding and a moonroof are installed on EX models.\n\nInterior\nFive occupants fit inside the Sportage. The driver’s seat has dual-height adjustment. With Kia’s “Drop & Fold” rear seating system, the seat cushion lowers and the backrest folds flat, yielding 66.6 cubic feet of cargo space. To accommodate long items, the backrest of the front passenger seat folds down.\n\nA height-adjustable center console is installed. All four doors contain cupholders.\n\nStandard equipment includes power windows with one-touch-down for the driver, power mirrors, cruise control and a six-speaker CD stereo. The EX adds heated mirrors, remote keyless entry, a cargo cover and a leather-wrapped steering wheel.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe 2.0-liter four-cylinder produces 140 horsepower, while the 2.7-liter V-6 generates 173 hp and 178 pounds-feet of torque. A five-speed manual gearbox is standard in the four-cylinder LX, and a four-speed automatic is available. All V-6 models come with the automatic.\n\nSafety\nAll-disc antilock brakes, traction control and an electronic stability system are standard. Six airbags, including side curtain devices, are also standard.\n\nDriving Impressions\nWith V-6 power, the Sportage yields a pleasant driving experience. Even on rougher pavement, the ride is well-cushioned. Suspension reactions are seldom excessive, and recovery is prompt. Even sizable bumps are partially absorbed.\n\nOther than a little tire noise on some surfaces, the Sportage is quiet, though the engine gets snarly at high rpm. Maneuvering smartly and steering with a somewhat light touch, the Sportage feels satisfyingly secure on rain-soaked pavement. On expressways, however, it takes some concentration to stay centered in your lane.\n\nAutomatic-transmission responses are prompt, but downshifting can be sluggish when passing. The gauges are simple but appropriate, and the front passenger gets a thick grab bar. A low cowl aids the view forward, and big side windows help rearward visibility.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nOnly the four-door wagon model of Kias compact sport utility vehicle remains on sale for 2002; the two-door convertible version is gone. Seat belt pretensioners have been added, speakers are upgraded and the hatch gets an outside handle. The upscale EX version gains a cladding-color roof rack and a hard spare tire cover. Sportage sales topped 62,000 units in 2000, an increase of nearly 10,000 vehicles.\n\nBuilt with trucklike body-on-frame construction, the Sportage offers 7.9 inches of ground clearance  sufficient for full offroad capabilities. Kia is currently owned by Hyundai, South Koreas largest auto manufacturer. Hyundai also markets an SUV of its own in the United States, called the Santa Fe. Kias come with similar warranties to those offered by Hyundai, which include a 5-year/60,000-mile limited basic warranty, a 10-year/100,000-mile limited warranty on major powertrain components and 5-year/100,000-mile corrosion coverage. Owners also get free roadside assistance for the first five years.\n\nKia will continue its new-product blitz in early 2002, when the automaker is expected to roll out a new SUV that will be longer in wheelbase than the Sportage and will likely be equipped with a V-6 engine.\n\nExterior\nThe Sportage measures 170.3 inches long with a 104.3-inch wheelbase. The SUV stands 65 inches tall and uses a trucklike body-on-frame construction. Tires are 15 inches, and a full-size spare is mounted on the tailgate.\n\nInterior\nThe Sportage holds five occupants in front bucket seats and a split, folding rear seat. Power windows, locks and mirrors are standard. The top-of-the-line EX model has a CD player, roof rack, air conditioning and alloy wheels, but leather seats are optional.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe 130-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine mates with a four-speed-automatic or five-speed-manual transmission. The Sportage may have either two-wheel drive or part-time four-wheel drive, which is designed only for slippery surfaces.\n\nSafety\nFront airbags protect the head and upper body, and a drivers knee airbag also is standard  a feature found on few vehicles in the U.S. market. Antilock brakes are optional.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2002 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Kia Sportage?\n\nThe Kia Sportage is a five-seat compact SUV that offers a choice of two four-cylinder engines, including a turbocharged one. All trim levels have a six-speed automatic transmission, and front- and all-wheel-drive versions are available. Competitors include the Toyota RAV4, Hyundai Tucson and Honda CR-V.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2019 Kia Sportage?\n\nThe LX Popular Package gets a 7-inch touchscreen multimedia system, automatic air conditioning, an automatic defogger and an air ionizer. New features for the mid-level EX trim include blind spot warning, rear cross-traffic alert and heated, power-folding side mirrors with integrated turn signals. The top-of-the-line SX Turbo gains an electronic parking brake with auto-hold capability.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Kia Sportage Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include 17-inch alloy wheels, cloth upholstery, air conditioning, cruise control, a 5-inch touchscreen stereo and Bluetooth. Available features include leather upholstery, heated and ventilated front seats, a heated steering wheel, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity, navigation, a Harman Kardon premium stereo and push-button start. Available active safety features include automatic emergency braking and lane departure warning.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Kia Sportage?\n\nThe top-end SX Turbo is fun to drive but is one of the pricier entrants in the class. The base LX is a good value, but the EX is more of a sweet spot and can be equipped with available active safety features. An updated Sportage arrives as a 2020 model.",

      "expert_review": "Ten years ago, Kia Sportage was a pioneer among sport utilities, blazing the trail for a whole generation of compacts.\n\nUndeniably cute and appealing, Sportage was a major hit among young drivers, who found a lot to like about its styling, four-wheel drive and, primarily, modest price tag.\n\nBut the little truckette had significant warts: harsh ride, dicey handling, cramped interior and limited capabilities. Still, Sportage was the first major success for the South Korean automaker until production stopped three years ago in the face of strong competition.\n\nSportage is back for 2005 and much improved. A near twin to Tucson by Hyundai, which now owns Kia, Sportage is bigger, roomier, more refined, better equipped and more powerful.In this hot part of the SUV market, Sportage now competes on equal terms with such popular compacts as Ford Escape/Mercury Mariner, Toyota RAV4, Honda CR-V, Mitsubishi Outlander and Jeep Liberty.\n\nSportage carries a significant price advantage, with a well-equipped base LX model starting at $15,900. The top-end EX tested here came with all the goodies, including V-6 engine and four-wheel drive for just $21,990.\n\nEven the base model comes with a full complement of safety features, including side-curtain airbags and electronic stability control.\n\nAnother plus is the strong warranty: five-year/60,000-mile bumper-to-bumper and 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain.\n\nAll of which makes Sportage a strong contender in this increasingly popular SUV arena.\n\n– – –\n\nREALITY CHECK\n\nHere’s how our featured car compares with others in its class.\n\nFord Escape XLT\n\n* Vehicle type: Five-passenger, four-door sport utility vehicle, all-wheel drive\n\n* Base price: $25,140\n\n* Engine: 3-liter V-6, 200 horsepower at 6,000 rpm, 193 pound-feet of torque at $4,850 rpm\n\n* Wheel base: 103.1 inches\n\n* EPA rating: 18 city, 22 highway\n\nHonda CR-V EX4\n\n* Vehicle type: Five-passenger, four-door sport utility vehicle, all-wheel drive\n\n* Base price: $22,650\n\n* Engine: 2.4-liter inline 4,160 horsepower at 6,000 rpm, 162 pound-feet of torque at 3,600 rpm\n\n* Wheel base: 103.3 inches\n\n* EPA rating: 21 city, 26 highway\n\n– – –\n\nPRICING\n\nBase price: $21,400.\n\nPrice as tested: $21,990.\n\nOPTIONS\n\n* All features standard in top EX package, including V-6 with automatic, full power features, power sunroof, fog lights, heated outside mirrors, leather shift knob and steering wheel, keyless remote, cargo cover, upgraded seat fabric.\n\n* Four-wheel drive adds $1,401 to $19,999 EX price.\n\n* Shipping, $590.\n\n– – –\n\nTHE LOWDOWN\n\nPERFORMANCE: The 2.7-liter V-6 is fairly small but powerful enough to propel this 3,500-pound SUV to highway speeds with decent acceleration. The 173-horsepower engine sets up a harsh roar, however, even under moderate throttle.\n\nThe competition offers more muscle, such as Escape’s 200-horsepower V-6.\n\nStandard engine is a 140-horsepower, 2-liter four that comes with a five-speed manual or automatic. The four-speed automatic, the only transmission with the V-6, sometimes shifts sluggishly.\n\nDRIVABILITY: Compact SUVs overall have improved tremendously in driving characteristics, becoming more carlike with stable handling and control.\n\nSportage is right up there with the established models, with all-independent suspension built onto a unibody sedan chassis.\n\nSportage comes standard with desirable electronic features, such as traction control, electronic stability control, anti-lock, all-disc brakes and brake-force distribution. Full safety air bags, including full side curtains, also come standard.\n\nSTYLING: The body lines are clean and streamlined but pretty standard stuff. Sixteen-inch alloy wheels, roof rack and rear privacy glass come standard.\n\nINTERIOR: Here’s where the value really shows. The fully equipped cabin looks and feels high-quality with attractive design and materials and loads of desirable features. The rear seat flops down easily to increase cargo capacity, and the audio system sounds good.\n\nInterior space is fairly roomy.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Although Sportage seems redundant compared with the slightly bigger Kia Sorento, expect the bigger SUV to grow in size and luxury in coming years. Same thing for Hyundai, where Santa Fe is moving on up.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nDuring Kia’s early years in the U.S. market, the South Korean automaker offered two models: the Sephia sedan and the Sportage sport utility vehicle. A new Sportage debuted for the 2005 model year, joining the company’s larger Sorento SUV. Because Kia and Hyundai share corporate parentage, the Sportage is related to Hyundai’s Tucson.\n\nLonger in wheelbase than the original Sportage, the current model has a wider track and a more powerful standard engine. Larger and roomier than its predecessor, the Sportage is offered with front- or four-wheel drive in LX and EX trim levels.\n\nFor 2006, the Sportage gets an improved spiral-type antenna and a standard air-filtration system. A tire-pressure-monitoring system is standard on the EX.\n\nExterior\nBuilt on a 103.5-inch wheelbase, the unibodied Sportage measures 171.3 inches long overall and 66.7 inches tall. Styling echoes the Sorento’s, and flared wheel arches help establish what Kia calls a “strong visual presence.” A horizontal-bar grille sits above a lower air intake.\n\nTwin roof bars are integrated into sloping D-pillars, which are outlined by black moldings. Alloy wheels hold 16-inch tires. Dual exhaust pipes are installed on V-6 models.\n\nGround clearance is 7.7 inches, and the Sportage has a four-wheel-independent suspension. A roof rack is standard. The top-hinged tailgate contains a flip-up window, and the spare tire mounts under the floor. Fog lights, bodyside cladding and a moonroof are installed on EX models.\n\nInterior\nFive occupants fit inside the Sportage. The driver’s seat has dual-height adjustment. With Kia’s “Drop & Fold” rear seating system, the seat cushion lowers and the backrest folds flat, yielding 66.6 cubic feet of cargo space. To accommodate long items, the backrest of the front passenger seat folds down.\n\nA height-adjustable center console is installed. All four doors contain cupholders.\n\nStandard equipment includes power windows with one-touch-down for the driver, power mirrors, cruise control and a six-speaker CD stereo. The EX adds heated mirrors, remote keyless entry, a cargo cover and a leather-wrapped steering wheel.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe 2.0-liter four-cylinder produces 140 horsepower, while the 2.7-liter V-6 generates 173 hp and 178 pounds-feet of torque. A five-speed-manual gearbox is standard in the four-cylinder LX, and a four-speed automatic is available. All V-6 models come with the automatic.\n\nSafety\nAll-disc antilock brakes, traction control and an electronic stability system are standard. Six airbags, including side curtain-type devices, are also standard.\n\nDriving Impressions\nWith V-6 power, the Sportage yields a pleasant driving experience. Even on rougher pavement, the ride is well-cushioned. Suspension reactions are seldom excessive, and recovery is prompt. Even sizable bumps are partially absorbed.\n\nOther than a little tire noise on some surfaces, the Sportage is quiet, though the engine gets snarly at high rpm. Maneuvering smartly and steering with a somewhat light touch, the Sportage feels satisfyingly secure on rain-soaked pavement. On expressways, however, it takes some concentration to stay centered in your lane.\n\nAutomatic-transmission responses are prompt, but downshifting can be sluggish when passing. The gauges are simple but appropriate, and the front passenger gets a thick grab bar. A low cowl aids the view forward, and big side windows help rearward visibility.",

      "expert_review": "We’ve a 2011 Kia Sportage backed up to a storage unit in Lynnfield. The second-row seats are folded flat to maximize cargo-carrying capacity. In goes a pole lamp followed by a good-sized rocking chair, a desk chair, several faux plants, a couple of milk crates, fishing pole, a plumbing snake, magazine rack, and assorted odds ‘n ends.\n\nPretty impressive, all things considered. This trip was intended to empty my storage area, a task that always results in more “stuff” to be loaded than anticipated. The goods are headed to a Somerville apartment.\n\nUnfortunately, after we’re packed up, there is still a bicycle, several rolled up rugs, and a stack of folding chairs left over.\n\n“Uh, we’ll get those on the next trip and drop them at my old condo’s storage area,” says my son, the beneficiary of this cargo-carrying expedition. “Uh, I don’t think so,” I say. “That’s too much driving. Let’s drop them off first.”\n\nSo out comes the cargo and in goes the other load of leftovers, heading for the secondary storage area, only a few miles away. That’s accomplished in a quick roundtrip. Then the original cargo is re-loaded and taken to Somerville. There, we park half atop a snowbank — thanks to an 18-inch snowfall — and unload.\n\nThe point being is that this Sportage, called a CUV by Kia, is a flexible vehicle in a week that included a major snowstorm, messy roads, and the final stage of a family move. We came to appreciate the all-wheel-drive system, which performed admirably in the many days before our neighborhood roads got down to bare pavement. It’s a setup that feeds power to the front wheels under normal conditions and adds drive to the rear wheels when needed.\n\nOne question is: What is a CUV? A compact utility vehicle? A crossover utility vehicle? A cute utility vehicle, the so-called Cute Ute? It’s a fair question, and any of the descriptions could apply to this Sportage, which is totally redesigned for 2011.\n\nYou can get into a decently equipped base version for $18,295 (including destination). All three versions — base, LX, EX — come with the same 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine that puts out 176 horsepower and 168 lb.-ft. of torque. A turbocharged SX version is expected out later this year. Our test version, a top-of-the-line EX with all-wheel-drive, premium package, and navigation, pushed the bottom line to $29,990.\n\nThe relatively small engine had plenty of oomph for Greater Boston driving, including on-ramps, highway passing, and accelerating from traffic lights. Loading the cargo area to capacity didn’t seem to have any adverse affects.\n\nFuel economy was an acceptable 24.3 miles per gallon given snow, traffic, and cold weather. It was in the middle of the Sportage’s 21 city to 28 highway EPA range. We credit two factors for this: the up-to-contemporary-standards six-speed automatic transmission and the AWD system that doesn’t seem to drain power.\n\nKia has made a high level of standard equipment a company trademark. The LX level has keyless entry, side-mirror mounted LED turn signal indicators, and tinted glass. The EX adds 18-inch alloy wheels, rear spoiler, and chrome trim.\n\nOur test car also had a $1,500 navigation system with rearview camera display and a $3,000 premium audio package that added heated leather seats, push-button start, panoramic sunroof, rear sonar, auto-dimming rearview mirror, heated outside mirrors, and a retractable cargo cover.\n\nKia touts the Sportage as having a sporty, tight suspension that enhances the driving experience. We found that to be true. However, we also found the ride noisy, a trait we’ve noticed in many of the Hyundai-Kia family of vehicles, especially on bumpy roads in cold weather. It’s hard to determine whether the rumbling is an NVH (noise-vibration-harshness) failing such as a lack of noise-deadening insulation or part of the suspension workings. As Mrs. G says, “Turn up the radio and stop worrying about it. It’s not that loud.”\n\nOn the outside, we thought the Sportage had a passing resemblance to the Lexus RX 350 with a high beltline that connects the headlights and taillights, both with LED enhancements. Naturally, the new Sportage is longer, lower, and wider than its predecessors.\n\nBluetooth phone connections were easy to establish and there were USB and auxiliary plugs along with a dedicated Apple adaptor wire for iPhones and iPods. Instruments and controls were intuitive for the most part and feature a three-segment instrument pod. A “trip” button cycles a digital display showing mileage information, outside temperature, and an EcoMinder light that indicates fuel-efficient driving.\n\nUnder the rear cargo floor was a hidden storage tray made from a Styrofoam-like material that’s divided into a bunch of compartments for keeping small items or tools out of sight.\n\nIf you’re a fan of these smaller CUVs, be assured that the Sportage fits nicely in this niche with the likes of the Nissan Rogue, Honda CR-V, and Toyota RAV4. We found it more than held its own — along with a lot of ours.\n\n2011 Kia Sportage EX AWD\n\nTHE BASICS\nPrice, base/as tested (with destination): $24,795 / $29,990.\nFuel economy, EPA estimated: 21 city / 28 highway.\nFuel economy, Globe observed: 24.3 mpg.\nDrivetrain: 2.4-liter I-4, six-speed automatic transmission, all-wheel-drive.\nBody: 5 passenger, 5-door unibody CUV.\n\nTHE SPECIFICS\nHorsepower: 176 @ 6,000 rpm.\nTorque: 168 lb.-ft. @ 4,000 rpm.\nOverall length: 174.8 in.\nWheelbase: 103.9 in.\nHeight: 64.4 in.\nWidth: 73 in.\nCurb weight: 3,355 pounds.\nTHE GOOD: Well equipped. Telescoping wheel helps find a comfortable driving position. Sharp styling, comfortable interior, intuitive controls.\n\nTHE BAD: Noisy suspension.\n\nTHE BOTTOM LINE: Redesign turned a decent car into an excellent choice.\n\nALSO CONSIDER: Dodge Journey, Honda CR-V, Nissan Rogue, Subaru Forester, Toyota RAV4.",

      "expert_review": "Just because the 2012 Kia Sportage is a cute-ute or compact crossover, it doesn’t make it an ideal family vehicle. Maybe I’m just getting old (gasp!) or my expectations were set a little too high, but despite its cool factor inside and out, the Sportage disappointed with its lack of cargo space and visibility issues.\n\nIt pains me to admit that I didn’t find the Sportage to be more of an ideal car for my small family of three. It’s good looking and offers some great features for its sticker price; the bottom line is the three of us got along OK inside it.\n\nMy driving-enthusiast husband kept scratching his head at my indifference toward the Sportage. I think it would’ve been a much better car for me years ago — either when I was in college and only needed a car’s cargo area to hold a few beach towels and a chair or during my honeymoon period when the husband and I would take off on spontaneous road trips.\n\nTo further support my hunch that this crossover will hit the sweet spot for a different demographic than my familial one, the available turbo four-cylinder engine will be sure to add a little more fun to a drive. I definitely felt some zip when driving it, but the overall driving experience was another area where the Sportage fell flat for me.\n\nThe 2012 Kia Sportage starts at $19,300, including an $800 destination charge, but my top-trim SX test car with its turbo engine, optional SX Premium Package and navigation system cost $31,015.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe 2012 Sportage is definitely attractive. It manages to come off as hip and youthful, making the more seasoned crossovers like the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4 look downright dated. My husband was enamored with the Sportage’s looks. While I can admit it was attractive, something about the rear just didn’t look finished.\n\nThe Sportage sits at a great height for loading kids into it, especially if they’re in child-safety seats. For kiddos who are big enough to independently get in and out of the crossover, it shouldn’t be a strain, either.\n\nI found the cargo-area access to be awkward. There’s not a traditional handle on the cargo door, which keeps the design clean-looking, but it was strange to keep reaching all the way under the cargo-door lip to open it. It was a little thing that kept irking me throughout my test drive. Because I’m always accessing the cargo area for my stroller, groceries and whatever toys my toddler has chucked back there, it would probably bother me more than most. There was no power liftgate on my upgraded test car either.\n\nThe surprising part about the Sportage was how small the cargo area seemed to be. You expect a crossover to be able to haul a bit more than a traditional sedan, but I didn’t find that to be true with the Sportage. Fortunately I was able to fit my stroller in it, but it took up most of the space and required me to remove it when heading to the grocery store. It would’ve held our luggage if the mister and I were headed on a weekend getaway, but now that we have a toddler in tow we usually have a greater demand for cargo space when heading out on an adventure. You can use the 60/40-split second row to increase your storage space, but of course, if you’ve got more than one backseat passenger, it’s not an option.\n\nMost Sportages have a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine that makes 176 horsepower, but my SX trim level has a standard 260-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine with direct injection. The 2.4-liter four-cylinder gets an EPA-estimated 22/32 mpg city/highway, and the turbo four-cylinder gets 22/29 mpg. Both engines use regular unleaded gasoline. Perhaps my lead foot is partly to blame (or too much stop-and-go traffic in Los Angeles), but I didn’t come near those numbers during my weeklong test drive.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): More than Fair/Less than Great\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nINTERIOR\nThe Sportage’s interior is sleek and sporty. Design aficionados will appreciate the modern details and be even more pleased with them considering the Sportage’s price point. I especially liked the easy-to-use multimedia system, Bluetooth phone connectivity and audio streaming, and my ventilated driver’s seat on warm days (the front passenger had to go without the feature — even at the top trim level, you’ll only score one of those seats).\n\nHowever, as much I enjoyed the inside, I couldn’t help feeling cramped in the cabin. I attribute that to the high windowsills, making the doors seem too tall and high to see out of. That was my biggest issue with the Sportage: visibility was compromised by its design. Again, someone outside of my demographic may give the Sportage a little more slack. I also had a hard time with the small rear window, making visibility limited there as well.\n\nThe Sportage is a five-seat crossover, but it’s better suited for four passengers. Two child safety seats did fit in the backseat, and there was sufficient legroom for my front seat passenger with a rear-facing seat behind them. The Sportage has two cupholders in the front row and two in the backseat; there also are bottleholders in the doors.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): More than Fair/Less than Ample\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): More than Fair/Less than Ample\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2012 Sportage has been named a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. To earn this status, a car must receive the top score of Good in front, side, rear and roof-strength crash tests. In crash tests conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the 2012 Sportage received an overall score of four stars out of five. It earned four stars in the rollover crash test and five stars in the front and side crash tests.\n\nThere are two sets of Latch anchors in the Sportage’s backseat. The anchors were some of the easier to access, and installing my daughter’s child-safety seat was a simple process. I may not have found the Sportage to be the ultimate family car, but easy car-seat installation will always earn bonus points in my book. Find out how the 2012 Sportage performed in Cars.com’s Car Seat Check.\n\nThe Sportage has standard front-wheel drive, antilock brakes with brake assist, an electronic stability system with traction control, active front head restraints and six airbags, including side curtains for both rows. A backup camera and rear parking sensors are available on lower trims, but standard on the EX and SX trims.\n\nGet more safety information on the 2012 Kia Sportage here.",

      "expert_review": "When the redesigned Kia Sportage and its Hyundai Tucson sibling arrived a few years back, they leapfrogged their competitors — pole-vaulted them, really — in safety features and value. Most have caught up, however, and today Kia’s entrant lacks its former appeal. Stripped-down versions of the Sportage are still a bargain, but as a whole, this SUV trails the pack.\n\nFront- or all-wheel-drive models come in LX or uplevel EX trims. The LX can have a four-cylinder or V-6, while the EX gets only the V-6. I drove a four-wheel-drive EX. All trims carry over with few changes for 2008; click here to see a comparison with the ’07 Sportage.\n\nRounded Styling\nThe Sportage might just have enough body cladding to qualify for this year’s Pontiac Grand Am challenge. OK, there’s no actual contest, but from any angle the Sportage’s trimmings give it an over-accessorized look, especially compared to some of the cleaner SUV designs out there. The Sportage LX starts with black mirrors, 16-inch alloy wheels and gray bumpers; EX models add fog lights, which are optional on the LX V-6. Body-colored bumpers come with an upgrade package on the EX.\n\nThe SUV’s dimensions should appeal to city drivers: It’s narrower and shorter than most major competitors, in some cases by significant margins. The Toyota RAV4 is 9.8 inches longer, while Nissan’s Rogue is nearly a foot longer. Not surprisingly, the Sportage’s 35.4-foot turning circle beats all major competitors except the Subaru Forester (34.4 feet), Toyota RAV4 (34.8 feet) and Mitsubishi Outlander (34.8 feet).\n\nThe Inside\nI suspect an immediate turnoff for many shoppers will be the driver’s seat. It’s narrow and marginally cushioned, and after a three-hour trip from Chicago to Wisconsin another editor and I agreed that the backrest felt like an ironing board. An eight-way manually adjustable driver’s seat is standard, but 6-foot-plus drivers will find it doesn’t go back far enough. Our test car had heated leather seats, but the upholstery feels downmarket of the cowhide in a Honda CR-V. The seat heaters are either hot or off, whereas others offer as many as five stages of intensity. A telescoping steering wheel is also unavailable — that’s an important feature the RAV4 and CR-V have standard.\n\nThe Sportage’s interior styling is aging fast. The contoured surfaces remind me of a previous era, and the passenger airbag still has an old-school cutout panel rather than being seamlessly integrated into the dash. In any trim, the stereo lacks an MP3 auxiliary jack and steering wheel controls; most competitors offer both. Materials quality is more respectable: The dashboard plastics are hard to the touch — typical for this class — but they have a low-gloss, attractive finish. Uplevel models add chrome door handles and silver plastic to certain areas; I’m usually not a fan of anything trying to simulate real metal, but Kia’s has a matte finish that manages to look decent.\n\nOther controls feel secure but not premium. A few years back, that would have made par for this class, but competitors from the CR-V to the Rogue have raised expectations in aspects like button damping and knob feel. Controls in the Sportage, from the hazards switch to the stability system cutoff, still have yesterday’s hollow, tinny click. The A/C knobs feel solid, but a pull-out console below them wobbles uncertainly. The automatic shifter shuffles through its positions with nowhere near the precision Honda and others have executed.\n\nThe backseat offers plenty of headroom and adequate legroom for adults, and the backrest reclines more than most. There’s also a standard folding center armrest, something the Rogue and Ford Escape still don’t have.\n\nStorage & Cargo\nThe Sportage’s 60/40-split backseat folds in a single motion to create a flat, continuous floor. (You’d think such usability would be a no-brainer, but the Escape and CR-V still manage to foul it up by requiring multiple steps.) Hard plastic seatbacks and a standard fold-flat front passenger seat should help with the Home Depot runs, and the Sportage’s 66.6 cubic feet of maximum cargo volume ranks midpack.\n\nLess competitive are the storage options with the rear seats up. Some of the center consoles in this class can swallow a mom’s purse; the Sportage’s might handle a prom-goer’s. The glove compartment is unexceptional, and cargo room with the seats up is a segment-trailing 23.6 cubic feet. Both the five-seat RAV4 and the Outlander offer about 50 percent more.\n\nHow it Moves\nMy all-wheel-drive test car came with the 2.7-liter V-6 and a four-speed automatic transmission. The engine musters energetic torque off the line but can’t match that initial thrust at higher speeds. On the highway, the automatic kicks down to 3rd without too much pedal prodding, though its downshifts aren’t always the smoothest. Passing others from 60 to 70 mph is easy enough, but the Sportage lacks the confidence of a V-6 Saturn Vue or turbocharged Volkswagen Tiguan, let alone that of the silly-fast V-6 RAV4. Opting for front-wheel drive shaves a significant 176 pounds, or 5 percent, off the Sportage’s total weight; that would likely improve passing power a bit.\n\nA 2.0-liter four-cylinder with a five-speed manual is standard; with the automatic, it comes only in front-wheel drive, so you have to upgrade to the V-6 if you want an automatic with all-wheel drive. The V-6 comes with the automatic and either driveline. Neither engine is particularly efficient: The four-cylinder/manual combo yields 20/25 mpg city/highway, which many four-cylinder competitors beat. The 2009 model does better in certain configurations, according to the EPA; a Kia spokeswoman has yet to tell me why, but the Tucson achieves similar improvements thanks to revised drivetrain calibrations, so I suspect the same is true for the Sportage. Even so, the ’09 model still trails many of its competitors for overall efficiency.\n\nDrivetrains Compared\n\tFour-cylinder\tV-6\nDisplacement\t2.0 liters\t2.7 liters\nAvailability\tLX, EX\tEX\nHorsepower @ rpm\t140 @ 6,000\t173 @ 6,000\nTorque (lbs.-ft. @ rpm)\t136 @ 4,500\t178 @ 4,000\nMaximum towing capacity (lbs.)\t1,500\t2,000\nTransmissions\tFive-speed manual, four-speed auto\tFour-speed auto\n2008 EPA mileage (city/hwy., mpg)\t20/25 (FWD manual), 19/25 (FWD auto), 19/24 (AWD manual)\t17/23 (FWD), 17/21 (AWD)\n2009 EPA mileage (city/hwy., mpg)\t20/25 (FWD manual or auto), 19/24 (AWD manual)\t18/23 (FWD or AWD)\nRecommended fuel\tRegular\tRegular\nSource: EPA and automaker data\n\nLike most compact SUVs these days, the Sportage utilizes a car-based unibody frame with independent front and rear suspensions. Ride quality is decent; the chassis remains composed over bumps, and ambient noise below 80 mph is low. The steering wheel feels evenly weighted, if a bit heavy, at low speeds; on the highway it retains a secure straight-ahead feel. Off-ramps and lane changes yield moderate body roll, but the wheels manage to hold the line nicely over mid-corner bumps.\n\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes are standard. Although they never feel particularly strong, the pedal delivers secure, linear response.\n\nSafety\nWhen the Sportage first arrived for 2005, it was among the first affordable SUVs to offer a standard electronic stability system. Others have caught up, and stability control is standard on nearly all of today’s SUVs. (Traction control, a prerequisite for any stability system, is also included.)\n\nDespite its six standard airbags — including side-impact airbags for the front seats and side curtain airbags for both rows — the Sportage earned mediocre crash-test scores from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. IIHS awarded front and side-impact scores of Acceptable, one rung down from the best rating, Good.\n\nFeatures & Pricing\nWithout the destination charge, a front-wheel-drive, four-cylinder Sportage LX starts at $16,050, some $3,000 to $5,000 below its major competitors. That’s wicked cheap, but you won’t get air conditioning, keyless entry or an automatic transmission — features most competitors include standard. (You do get power windows and a CD stereo, which might be enough for some.) A/C adds $800; it’s included if you upgrade to an automatic transmission or all-wheel drive, though both models cost considerably more.\n\nThe EX starts at $21,395 and includes the V-6 and an automatic. It also adds keyless entry, body-colored exterior trimmings, a moonroof and a leather-wrapped steering wheel. Leather upholstery, heated seats and an upgraded stereo are optional; fully loaded, the Sportage tops out under $26,000. That undercuts many fully loaded competitors, but Kia doesn’t offer features like automatic climate control or a navigation system.\n\nSportage in the Market\nOnce a strong up-and-comer, the Sportage is now falling behind: It’s competitive in several areas but rarely stands out, and its aggravations are widespread. There are some pretty steep cash-back offers available on it right now — up to $3,000 depending on the configuration — so for the moment, at least, the value appeal remains intact. That, plus Kia’s impressive 10-year powertrain warranty and above-average reliability, give the Sportage the sort of appeal an accountant might recommend. With all its shortcomings, though, I’d suggest something else.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "We’ve been hunting for the baby sport-ute equivalent of a Swiss army knife. You know, a practical, affordable tool with lots of “surprise and delight” features, as the marketing folks like to say.\n\nUnfortunately, the 1997 Kia Sportage 4×4 has more “surprise and disappoint” features – the puzzling addition of a driver’s side “knee bag,” but the lack of a passenger air bag, for instance. And the Korean baby truck also strikes us as being far too “teenage” for adult tastes.\n\nAt first glance, the under-$16,000 base price makes the Sportage seem like a real bargain against the more expensive Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4 – until you take a closer look at some of its flaws and idiosyncrasies and what you may be sacrificing up in the name of “value.”\n\nShe: I guess the first thing I’m giving up is my security blanket. I like to know that I can find a dealer with little difficulty when I buy a car. That’s the first strike against Kia. It’s only got about 200 dealers in the United States and they’re mostly located on the coasts and across the south. That may be enough of an anxiety-producer to make me pass on the Sportage, even though it has its merits.\n\nHe: Worry, worry, worry. You’re being way too fretful. Hey, I like the Sportage. Dynamically, it’s a pretty nice vehicle – better than a Suzuki Sidekick or a Geo Tracker. But for every positive thing I can say about the vehicle, there’s some negative, too.\n\nShe: You’re being way too diplomatic. I wouldn’t recommend this car to a friend or family member. Why should I foist it off on our readers? It’s a car for somebody with a teenage mentality. You know, someone who thinks they’re immortal, infallible – and infertile. They never ever dream that they’ll someday need a mechanic or get in an accident where they’d need a passenger air bag. Plus they wear those awful stuffed-animal backpacks and Tasmanian Devil baseball caps. Buy the Sportage! Adolescence rules!\n\nHe: Something wrong with my Taz hat? Oh, you just don’t like it when I wear it backwards, right? And by the way, remember you’re supposed to be an auto writer here, not a mother.\n\nShe: Go to your room.\n\nHe: You’re supposed to talk about stuff like the base engine. The one in the Sportage, for instance, is the most powerful in the class. It makes 130 horsepower and is pretty lively. The Sportage is also nimble and easy to maneuver, and seems to soak up potholes really well. On the down side, you only get rear-wheel antilock brakes. I also agree with you on one point. The lack of a passenger air bag is really inexcusable. Kia would have been better served to skip that silly knee bag, which is supposed to keep the driver from sliding under the dashboard in a collision, and just invest the money in a regular passenger bag.\n\nShe: You’re nit-picking the details on the Sportage. But I have a more overriding problem. As a brand, Kia has yet to burn itself into the culture. What the heck is a Sportage? What t he heck is a Kia? That was the consensus in every grocery store parking lot I was in here in southeastern Michigan, where Kia doesn’t plan to set up dealers until 1998. Everybody wondered what it was and nobody could define it.\n\nHe: They don’t really have that problem in Florida and southern California.\n\nShe: I also worry that there are too many sport utes on the market – just like there are too many cereal choices. It creates thoughtless consumerism. You can get what you need with a RAV4 or a CR-V. Or a Tracker or a Suzuki X-90. Why crowd the market with even more confusing choices?\n\nHe: Gee, everybody needs a Kia Pet. And it IS better than a Tracker or an X-90, hands down. In one respect, you’re probably right. The lack of name recognition has probably put a crimp in the Sportage’s chances for success. The size and price otherwise would make it a great candidate for cult-vehicle status.\n\nShe: Yeah, if you’re waiting for that space ship hiding behind Hale-Bopp\n\nHe: You sure can’t argue with all the standard features. For the $15,995 base price, you get power windows, locks and mirrors, some very comfortable reclining bucket seats in front and a split-folding bench in the rear, plus carpeting throughout the vehicle. That’s pretty remarkable even before you add in the four-wheel drive system and the twim-cam 2.0-liter engine. Plus you can customize the Sportage with fun options like a $96 bike carrier and a $121 ski rack.\n\nShe: But the price of the Sportage is deceptive. At first, I got really excited about its sticker, especially when you consider that the CR-V is priced at $20,000 and the four-door RAV4 4×4 starts at nearly $18,000. But when you’re giving up things like a dealer network, a reputation solidified over time and a passenger air bag, I’d feel a lot better if the Sportage were a true bargain – in the $10,000-$12,000 range. Then I’d figure: “Hey I’m a pioneer – I’m taking a chance on something, but there’s also something in it for me.”\n\nHe: You sound like the perfect candidate for that space ship. Why don’t you see if you can do a test-drive on THAT? I still think the Sportage has its virtues. The back seat is a little cramped, but there’s loads of room up front and plenty of cargo space. Although some of the trim pieces should fit together tighter, the vehicle we tested looks to be much better quality than the prototypes I drove last summer. One gripe that Kia still needs to attend to, and that’s the noisy driveline. It’s really noticeable above 50 miles per hour.\n\nShe: Probably the Sportage’s biggest plus is styling. Its smooth, rounded body looks like it was born to carry a canoe or a kayak. But the exterior design is not flawless. The outside spare-tire carrier was irritating to operate with its separate controls for the tire and the lift gate. If I were really hot to buy one, I’d wait until fall when the instrument panel gets redesigned and the Sportage gets that passenger air bag. And if I were at all conservative, I’d wait until Kia got more established in the United States before I took a chance on the company.\n\nHe: You’re being too harsh. The Sportage is a heck of a lot more practical than some of the so-called “youth” vehicles like the X-90 and the Tracker, and it’s simply a better vehicle, period. I went four-wheeling in it in Montana last summer and it did a great job. Fun and functional. What more could you ask for? I think you should lighten up. You can practice by buying chocolate Frosted Flakes instead of Wheaties. And quit staring at that damn comet.\n\n1997 Kia Sportage 4×4\n\nType: Front-engine, four-wheel drive, four-passenger sport-utility vehicle.\n\nPrice: Base, $15,995; as tested, $17,969 (inc. $425 destination charge).\n\nWhat’s new for ’97: Driver-side knee bolster, redesigned grille, full-size spare-tire carrier, standard power door locks, theft-deterrent system, optional AM-FM stereo with CD player, optional four-s peed automatic on two-wheel-drive models.\n\nStandard equipment: All-season radial tires, alloy wheels, automatic locking front hubs, power steering, power windows, power door locks, power outside mirrors, split folding rear seats, tachometer, digital clock, variable intermittent wipers, rear defogger, theft-deterrent system.\n\nSafety features: Driver-side air bag, inflatable knee bolster (driver side), rear-wheel antilock brakes.\n\nOptions on test vehicle: Air conditioning ($900); premium AM-FM stereo ($400); roof rack ($185); carpeted floor mats ($64).\n\nEPA fuel economy: 19 mpg city/23 mpg highway.\n\nEngine: 2.0-liter I-4; 130-hp at 5500 rpm; 127 lb-ft torque at 4000 rpm.\n\nTransmission: Five-speed manual.\n\nCompetitors: Geo Tracker, Suzuki Sidekick, Toyota RAV4, Honda CR-V, Jeep Wrangler.\n\nSpecifications: Wheelbase, 104.3 inches; overall length, 159.3 inches; curb weight, 3314 pounds; legroom, 44.5 inches front/31.1 inches rear; headroom, 3. nc es front/37.8 inches rear; shoulder room, 54.4 inches front/54.4 inches rear.\n\n12-month insurance cost, according to AAA Michigan: $1,030.

      "expert_review": "The 2013 Kia Sportage remains sharp inside and out, but increasing issues with the car demand attention — from Kia and shoppers alike.\n\nStylish and nimble, the five-seat Sportage SUV remains compelling for shoppers who drive solo, but it hasn’t evolved like some of its competitors have to accommodate small families. And too many issues — a poor crash test here, a steering problem there — cause concerns. I evaluated an all-wheel-drive Sportage EX, which is a middle trim level that’s higher than the base and LX and just below the SX. (The base comes only with front-wheel drive, while other trims have front- or all-wheel drive.)\n\nGoing & Stopping\nDrive solo and the Sportage’s 2.4-liter four-cylinder gets to highway speeds capably enough thanks to balanced low-end power and snappy accelerator response. The six-speed automatic transmission’s shifts, however, are a bit muddy at times, and it hunts for gears during rapid elevation changes. Base models employ a six-speed manual.\n\nThe weight of three adults on board required most of the drivetrain’s reserves to maintain highway speed. If you frequently haul passengers, sticking with front-wheel drive saves 169 pounds, which should free up some passing power. Or opt for Kia’s turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder, which makes 260 horsepower and 269 pounds-feet of torque — considerably more than the 2.4-liter’s 176 hp and 168 pounds-feet. Alas, it’s available only on the Sportage SX. Lesser trims employ only the 2.4-liter four.\n\nMajor competitors have surpassed the Sportage’s gas mileage, if only by a smidgen. EPA numbers with the six-speed auto and 2.4-liter four-cylinder are 21/30/25 mpg city/highway/combined. That’s 1 mpg combined short of the Chevrolet Equinox, Ford Escape, Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4. All-wheel-drive Sportages get an estimated 20/27/23 mpg, which matches the Equinox’s combined figure but falls 2 mpg short of the others. With either Sportage driveline, the 2.0-liter turbo loses 1 mpg combined. All Sportages have the same four-wheel-disc brakes with the required antilock braking. Repeat hard stops delivered linear, fade-free pedal response. Another bonus: The Sportage’s 34.7-foot turning circle makes for easy U-turns, where the Escape (38.7 feet) and Equinox (40 feet) need three-pointers.\n\nRide & Handling\nI can’t heap similar praise on the Sportage’s highway composure. At moderate speeds, the steering delivered quick, nimble cuts, with little body roll in our EX test car, but on the interstate it gravitates toward a numb, distant sensation when the wheel is at 12 o’clock. The Sportage dials back power assist well enough — it’s not too light or buoyant — but the wheel never settles in; it wanders off-center too easily, and the constant corrections to keep the SUV on track wear you down. It’s characteristic of too many vehicles from Kia and its parent company, Hyundai. Kia’s new Cadenza sedan shows signs of progress, but the evolution has yet to reach the brand’s SUVs.\n\nFitted with upgraded rear shock absorbers a year ago, the Sportage filters out individual bumps well enough, but highways still expose the gritty busyness that’s characterized the nameplate since its 2011 redesign. Our test car had higher-performance shocks, as well as 18-inch wheels and P235/55R18 tires. Both come on the EX and SX but not the base or LX trims, though all Sportages will adopt the upgraded shocks for 2014.\n\nThe Inside\nThe Sportage’s raked windshield sacrifices some forward visibility, but the cabin gets high marks for design. Inventive textures cover the dash: piano-black center controls and some chrome around the gearshift. Alas, cabin materials underline the SUV’s sub-$20,000 starting price: thin seats, harsh plastics and padding-free upper doors. The Mazda CX-5 and up-level versions of the Ford Escape have richer materials.\n\nDespite a high center console — as opposed to the upright, minivan-like dash in the Honda CR-V — the Sportage had enough knee room for my 6-foot frame. (The Escape’s console is even wider, and several editors found it pinned their knees in.) But the six-way powered driver’s seat on EX and SX trim levels forgoes a cushion-angle adjuster, and some may find the fixed angle lends too much or too little thigh support.\n\nFor an SUV that’s a few inches shorter than the Escape, CR-V and RAV4 — and more than a foot shorter than the Equinox — the Sportage’s backseat has adequate knee room. Unfortunately, the seat sits low to the floor, so adults may find their knees uncomfortably elevated. What’s more, the Sportage lacks any backseat adjustments, which many SUVs in this class offer.\n\nCargo space behind the rear seats totals a modest 26.1 cubic feet; the Equinox, RAV4, Escape and CR-V all have 30-plus cubic feet. Fold the seats down, and the Sportage tops out at 54.6 cubic feet — 9.1 to 18.8 cubic feet short of the group’s maximum figures.\n\nSafety, Resale Concerns\nIn crash tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the Sportage earned top marks in front, side and rear impacts, as well as in a roof-strength test. But the SUV scored poorly in IIHS’ new small-overlap crash test, which simulates hitting an object from your front-left corner. (Read about the test here.) The 2014 Subaru Forester and Mitsubishi Outlander Sport fared well in the test, but most other Sportage competitors also did poorly.\n\nStandard safety features on the Kia include six airbags plus the required antilock brakes and electronic stability system. The Sportage does not offer blind spot, lane departure or forward collision warning systems — increasingly widespread safety options among some competitors. Click here for a full list of safety features on the Sportage, and see how it accommodates child-safety seats in our Car Seat Check.\n\nIn its two years on the market, the Sportage has shown exemplary reliability, even in a class known for few problems. Resale value, however, is concerning. Residuals calculator ALG projects five-year resale values for the SUV to range from 34 to 38 percent, depending on trim level. That’s closer to the Equinox (31 to 34 percent) than the CR-V (38 to 40 percent) and Escape (37 to 40 percent). ALG has yet to calculate residuals for the redesigned RAV4.\n\nFeatures & Pricing\nThe base Sportage starts around $20,000, including destination charge. That’s thousands less than its major competitors, and it gets you a stick-shift car with 16-inch alloy wheels, power windows and locks, cruise control, and Bluetooth phone and audio streaming.\n\nIt would seem like a good deal, but the automatic transmission — for which nearly all SUV shoppers opt — requires stepping up to the LX (about $22,000). It also adds larger alloy wheels, headlight washers and remote entry with a car alarm, but that’s embarrassingly little to justify the $2,000 difference. Pile up the options on an EX or SX, meanwhile, and you can get leather seats and heated front seats — along with a cooled driver’s seat that works pretty well, considering most cooled seats are as effective at cooling you as a cup of decaf is at waking you up. You can also get a panoramic moonroof, navigation and a backup camera. All-wheel drive runs an affordable $1,500 on the LX, EX and SX.\n\nLoad up an all-wheel-drive Sportage SX and the total runs about $32,500.\n\nSportage in the Market\nKia’s larger Sorento overshadows the Sportage, outselling its smaller sibling at a rate of more than 3.5 to 1. More popular compact SUVs, meanwhile, outsell the Sorento by double or more. Kia’s two-SUV strategy in this group gives shoppers more choices, but the smaller of the two seems increasingly entry-level as the years go by. Small families will find better versatility among some of the Sportage’s competitors, particularly the CR-V. It should still appeal to solo drivers, but consider the drawbacks before jumping in.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThis Korean-made, pint-size sport utility vehicle comes in two-door convertible and four-door wagon body styles. Kia boasts that, unlike most small sport utes, the Sportage is designed for rugged off-road service. The company backs up this claim by pointing to the body-on-frame construction and 7.9 inches of ground clearance.\n\nInterior\nWith 11.5 inches more wheelbase than the convertible, the four-door Sportage has a longer interior that provides more leg and cargo room. The wagon seats five; the convertible four. In addition to federally required front airbags designed to protect the head and upper body, a driver-side knee airbag is standard. Power door locks, windows and mirrors are standard on all models. The top-of-the-line EX model comes with a standard CD player, with leather seats optional.\n\nExterior\nThe convertible has a hardtop over the front seats and a folding canvas top over the rear seats, an arrangement akin to the Toyota RAV4’s. The wagon is all hardtop and about 14 inches longer. Both mount a full-size spare tire on the tailgate.\n\nUnder the Hood\nAll models use a 130-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder that teams with manual or automatic transmissions. Both body styles come with 2WD or a part-time 4WD system that can be used on slippery surfaces.\n\n \n\nReported by Rick Popely  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2000 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "So attractive, so appealing, so stylish, you’d think Chrysler Corp., the industry’s reigning design guru, shaped the sheet metal on the Kia Sportage, one of the few affordable, small, sport-utility vehicles on the market.\n\nThe lines are clean and crisp, yet bold. The Toyota RAV4 looks plump and the Honda CR-V looks sterile by comparison.\n\nThe Sportage offers four-wheel-drive for all-season motoring yet delivers more than 20 m.p.g. so you don’t have to spend most of those seasons visiting your local Amoco. Or is it BPmoco?\n\nAnd with all the goodies except automatic transmission (better sit down for this: automatic is a $1,000 option) and anti-lock brakes ($490), the sticker still is about $1,500 short of $20,000.\n\nWhat’s not to love about the Kia Sportage?\n\nWell, after the styling and ability to maneuver through the snow, there’s not much to write home about.\n\nTo put it kindly, the South Korean-built Sportage is a Third World machine. The RAV4 might not win many beauty contests when marching down the same runway as Sportage, but the RAV4 at least will win the congeniality award. Sportage won’t.\n\nNow, you might argue, hasn’t the media been filled with stories about Kia being one of the industry’s fastest-growing companies? Haven’t sales been going through the roof when compared with a year ago?\n\nSure, and the reason is that Kia initially was found only in a few West Coast states and has just started moving into the Midwest. (The automaker had its Midwest coming-out party at the Chicago Auto Show in February before opening a handful of stores in the area.)\n\nSales growth is a result of dealership openings. With each new store comes an upward blip on the sales charts as the curious–and those seeking a lower-cost alternative to a $30,000 sport-ute–welcome the vehicle.\n\nWhen the novelty wears off–and it will; just ask those who sold the Yugo and the Hyundai Excel–good looks and low price no longer draw people into the showrooms unless those attractions are teamed with top quality. Sportage has a way to go to roam with the big boys.\n\nThe 2-liter, 130-horsepower, 4-cylinder engine makes quite a racket and the noise filters back into the passenger cabin. The industry watchword is that “Quiet is the sound of a well-made car.”\n\nThe 2-liter is also a bit slow when leaving the light.\n\nOur test vehicle came with the standard 5-speed manual, which wasn’t as slippery smooth as that in its chief rival, the RAV4. The 5-speed is a Getrag. Remember when GM used Getrags, the balky and hesitant and most unpleasant German-made 5-speed used in the 1980s, sending motorists to chiropractors to straighten out their arms? Nuff said.\n\nBasically the Sportage felt as if a few nuts and bolts had been left out. Sportage comes with a swing-out spare tire on the hatchback lid, a location that frees interior space for more cargo. On our test vehicle, the swing-out spare rig would swing out and close easily on one oc casion, but the next time it would take more than a try to close.\n\nWhen the rear seats are folded, Sportage offers added cargo capacity, but the seats don’t fold flat, which limits what you can do with the space.\n\nAnother Sportage shortcoming is that to keep the sticker price down, four-wheel anti-lock brakes are a $490 option–this in a vehicle aimed at youth, and one that will be used extensively in foul weather. At least optional four-wheel ABS is better than the optional rear-wheel ABS Sportage had been offering before this year.\n\nSportage is offered in two- or four-wheel-drive. Prices range from $14,895 for the base 2WD model to $17,295 for the 2WD EX, $16,395 for the base 4WD model we tested and $18,495 for the 4WD EX.\n\nStandard equipment includes dual air bags, driver’s side knee air bag (to keep you from submarining in a collision), 15-inch radial tires, power locks/windows/steering, dua l power mirrors, rear-window defogger, intermittent wipers, passenger-side visor va nity mirror, tachometer, tilt steering and digital clock.\n\nNew for 1998 are automatic locking/unlocking hubs when engaging/disengaging 4WD using the transfer case.\n\nBut since Sportage wasn’t sold in the Midwest in ’97, few here knew that you used to have to get out and lock/unlock hubs manually.\n\nOur test vehicle came with air conditioning at $900, AM/FM stereo with CD player at $545, roof rack at $195 and carpeted floor mats at $69. Add $425 for freight.\n\nIf ABS at $490 and automatic at $1,000 were added, the sticker would have gone $19 over the $20,000 mark. However, had the roof rack been left off, the sticker would have stayed $176 under $20,000.\n\nVery good idea: a low-cost, high-mileage, well-equipped, 4WD sport-ute for those who don’t want to be indebted for life for purchasing the current fashion trend.\n\nNow that Kia has captured the public’s attention, it needs to capture their respect by assigning wrenches and pliers to its engineers and having them give the machine reliability and durability–along with a quieter engine and smoother transmission.\n\nKia needs to learn the Yugo/Excel lesson: Even consumers short on funds have long memories.\n\n>> 1998 Kia Sportage 4×4\n&#169; 1998 Chicago Tribune Wheelbase: 104.3 inches Length: 170.3 inches Engine: 2-liter, 130-h.p. 4-cylinder Transmission: 5-speed manual Fuel economy: 19 m.p.g. city/23 m.p.g. highway Base price: $16,395 Price as tested: $18,104. Includes $900 for air conditioning; $545 for AM/FM stereo with CD player; $69 carpeted floor mats; and $195 roof rack. Add $425 for freight. Pluses: Stunning styling fit for Chrysler. Four-wheel-drive for all-season motoring. Good fuel economy. Priced as an economical alternative to the $25,000 to $30,000 rivals. Minuses: A Third World machine. Must carry pliers in glove box. >>",

      "expert_review": "Kia’s new large SUV, the Telluride, has been getting loads of attention after its Super Bowl closeup, but the automaker is now shining some light on one of its smallest SUVs, the Sportage. The refreshed 2020 Sportage compact SUV was unveiled today at the 2019 Chicago Auto Show.\n\nRelated: More 2019 Chicago Auto Show Coverage\n\nThe changes to the model are light and include front- and rear-end styling tweaks, additional convenience and safety equipment, and a new sport-oriented S model. Powertrains carryover from 2019. The 2020 Sportage will again be offered in LX, EX and SX trims in either front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive; the new S model adds sporty exterior and interior design features.\n\nOutside, the refreshed model gets a new headlight design with available LED turn indicators, as well as redesigned projector-beam foglights. The overall shape of the grille is the same as the outgoing model, but the new one gets some more bling courtesy of a chrome strip that now bisects the foglights. In back, the taillight design is also tweaked, as well as the exhaust-tip design. A new color joins the lineup this year: metallic Steel Grey.\n\nNew interior features include available leatherette seats, a standard 8-inch touchscreen multimedia system with Apple Car Play and Android Auto, a revised steering-wheel design and an available wireless charging tray for smartphones.\n\nThe Sportage’s list of available safety equipment also grows for 2019, and the new features make it more competitive with those in the class who already offer active safety and driver assistance systems. Newly available features include a driver attention warning system, lane keep assist, adaptive cruise control that works down to a stop, forward collision warning with pedestrian detection and a high-beam assist system.\n\nThere’s no word yet on which systems will be standard or on what model they’ll be available, but the Sportage’s Hyundai sibling, the 2019 Tucson, got a similar list of safety features this year and they’re all standard, even on the base model.\n\nThe 2020 Sportage will go on sale during the first half of 2019; Kia said it will announce pricing closer to the SUV’s on-sale date.\n\n2020 Kia Sportage | Manufacturer image\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Is the 2026 Kia Sportage Hybrid a Good SUV?\n\nThe Kia Sportage Hybrid is a spacious, nicely balanced everyday hauler that sports a few unconventional styling touches and boasts a pleasantly upscale look and feel in its top trim level.\n\nHow Does the 2026 Kia Sportage Hybrid Compare With Other Compact SUVs?\n\nAmong mainstream-brand hybrid compact SUVs, the all-wheel-drive Sportage Hybrid’s Kia-estimated fuel economy of 35 mpg in combined driving is on par with the related 2025 Hyundai Tucson Hybrid. However, its gas mileage trails class leaders like the 2025 Honda CR-V Hybrid and 2025 Toyota RAV4 Hybrid by 2-4 mpg.\n\nKia’s current-generation Sportage compact SUV debuted for 2023 with upsized dimensions and its first available hybrid and plug-in hybrid powertrains. For 2026, the entire Sportage family receives a nicely executed refresh that brings updated styling and some welcome new standard and available features. For this review, I attended the 2026 Sportage Hybrid’s press preview event in Louisville, Ky., where I drove the top-of-the-line SX-Prestige trim level. (Per our ethics policy, Cars.com pays for its own airfare and lodging when attending such manufacturer-sponsored events.)\n\nRelated: What’s the Best Compact SUV for 2025?\n\nWhat’s New for the Refreshed 2026 Kia Sportage?\n\nThe 2023 Sportage inaugurated an unorthodox front-end treatment that included boomerang-shaped daytime running lights and swoopy body-lines. A face-lift for 2026 brings a slightly blockier, more conventional look, with daytime running lights that make the Sportage look more like a downsized version of Kia’s mid-size Sorento SUV. If you found the previous Sportage’s looks to be a bit too much, the 2026’s mildly toned-down visage might be more to your liking, and it still stands out enough that you’re unlikely to have any trouble finding it in a crowded parking lot.\n\nThe gas-only Sportage’s 187-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine carries over unchanged, but both hybrid powertrains get a slight power boost thanks to upgraded electric motors. The conventional hybrid is up 5 hp, to 232 hp total, while the PHEV is up 7 hp for a total of 268 hp.\n\nAmong the new standard features are a two-spoke steering wheel with a squared-off shape, an updated panoramic dashboard panel with dual 12.3-inch displays and wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto (higher trim levels get an upgraded gauge cluster screen and infotainment system). Newly available features include a 10-inch multifunction head-up display, heated outboard rear seats, side parking sensors and an upgraded version of Kia’s Highway Driving Assist system.\n\nIn addition to the previous drive-mode settings, AWD Sportages get a standard Terrain mode with driver-selectable settings for snow, mud and sand. Additionally, the Sportage Hybrid lineup expands with new S and X-Line trim levels, both with dark-finish accents.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nHow Does the 2026 Kia Sportage Hybrid Drive?\n\nYou’d probably have to drive a 2025 and a 2026 Sportage Hybrid back to back to notice any difference in power delivery, but the SX Prestige I drove supplied respectably peppy, if not instantaneous, acceleration. The Sportage Hybrid’s conventional six-speed automatic transmission might seem a little archaic on paper compared to the continuously variable automatic transmissions of other hybrid powertrains, but it performs well. Overall, the Sportage Hybrid’s power delivery is smooth and mostly seamless.\n\nUnlike the squared-off steering wheels in some vehicles I’ve driven, the Sportage’s new steering wheel wasn’t awkward for me to use and didn’t introduce any instrument panel visibility issues. The steering feel itself is responsive but relaxed. Even among compact SUVs, the Sportage is no corner carver; it’s tuned for comfort more than crisp handling. The ride quality is comfortable and absorbent overall, but the Sportage’s composure can be upset by sharp bumps in the middle of a turn, as on a freeway on-ramp. Our test drives were entirely on pavement, so I didn’t get the chance to test the effectiveness of the Sportage’s new Terrain mode system.\n\nHow Is the 2026 Kia Sportage Hybrid’s Fuel Economy?\n\nWe haven’t had the chance to do real-world fuel-economy testing yet, either, but the best average fuel economy on the dashboard display during my driving was 34.2 mpg. That’s on par with estimates of 35/36/35 mpg city/highway/combined for AWD Sportage Hybrid trims, but it’s not outstanding for a hybrid compact SUV. It trails by 2-3 mpg the real-world numbers we achieved on a different drive route in a 2025 Honda CR-V hybrid and a 2024 Toyota RAV4 Hybrid. Kia’s gas mileage estimates for the front-wheel-drive Sportage Hybrid are an impressive 41/44/42 mpg, but FWD comes only in the entry-level LX trim.\n\nWhat Is the 2026 Kia Sportage Hybrid’s Interior Like?\n\nThe cabin ambiance in the line-topping SX-Prestige trim is suitably upscale, helped by a full complement of comfort and convenience features. The easy-to-use rotary gear selector and clever retractable cupholders aren’t new, but they’re still among my favorite features. The combination control panel that toggles between climate and audio controls is another carryover feature; it takes a little getting used to because it’s easy to forget to change from climate to audio mode and vice versa. However, the Sportage’s cargo area and backseat space are still among the most generous in the class. I’m 6 feet, 6 inches tall, and I had decent comfort in the backseat with the front seat positioned all the way back.\n\nShould You Buy a 2026 Kia Sportage Hybrid?\n\nThe Kia Sportage Hybrid was already a solid entry in a hotly contested class, and the updates it receives for 2026 enhance its standing. Its pricing remains highly competitive, too, especially considering the generous levels of standard equipment; including destination, prices start at $31,735 for the base LX trim and run to $41,835 for the SX-Prestige. The 2026 Kia Sportage lineup is arriving in dealerships now.\n\nMore Kia Sportage News From Cars.com:\n\n2026 Kia Sportage Up Close: Nothing Broken, No Fixing Required\nFace-Lifted 2026 Kia Sportage Gets More Standard Tech, Hybrid Gets (Slightly) More Power and Trims\nHow Much Is the 2026 Kia Sportage Hybrid?\nHow Much Is the 2026 Kia Sportage Plug-in Hybrid?\n2025 Kia Sportage: Minor Content Change, Minor Price Change\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "After a redesign for 2023 and minor updates for 2024, Kia’s Sportage compact SUV enters the 2025 model year with few changes. For 2025, the EX trim will offer a Premium Package and the X-Line and X-Pro trims add dark exterior trim. Prices are also up slightly; the 2025 Kia Sportage starts at $28,565, up from the 2024 model’s $28,865 base price (all prices include $1,375 destination).\n\nRelated: Kia Expands 2023 Sportage Lineup With New Plug-In Hybrid\n\nFor 2025, the newly available Premium Package adds a panoramic moonroof and smart power liftgate. Other changes for the new model year include additional standard dark-toned exterior trim for the X-Line and X-Pro trims, such as gloss black on the front and rear bumpers, as well as side sills; the X-Line also gets gloss-black alloy wheels, and both trims get additional black badges.\n\nThe Sportage’s powertrains carryover for 2025. Power comes from a 187-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine or two hybrid powertrains, each based on a turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder. The hybrid makes 227 hp combined, while the plug-in hybrid makes a total of 261 hp; the PHEV has 34 miles of electric-only driving range. Front- and all-wheel drive are available.\n\nWhile official figures for the 2025 model are not yet available, the base FWD variant of the 2024 Sportage is good for an EPA-estimated 25/33/28 mpg city/highway/combined. The FWD hybrid is rated 42/44/43 mpg (AWD drops figures to 38/38/38 mpg), and the plug-in version has an 84 mpg-equivalent rating and 35 mpg combined rating.\n\nPricing and Availability\n\nThe 2025 Sportage will go on sale soon. Model-year 2025 trim-level pricing for gas, hybrid and PHEV variants is as follows:\n\nSportage\nLX FWD: $28,565\nEX FWD: $30,665\nSX FWD: $34,165\nSX-Prestige FWD: $36,165\nLX AWD: $30,365\nEX AWD: $32,465\nX-Line AWD: $33,465\nX-Pro AWD: $37,665\nSX-Prestige AWD: $37,965\nX-Pro Prestige AWD: $39,465\nSportage Hybrid\nLX FWD: $29,965\nLX AWD: $31,765\nEX AWD: $33,765\nSX-Prestige AWD: $38,965\nSportage Plug-In Hybrid\nX-Line AWD: $41,065\nX-Line Prestige AWD: $45,565\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nIs the 2023 Kia Sportage Hybrid a Good SUV? 6 Pros and 4 Cons\n2023 Kia Sportage Hybrid Review: Great (With a Catch)\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2023 Kia Sportage Hybrid?\nFind Your Next Car\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Kia Sportage?\n\nThe Kia Sportage is a compact SUV with seating for five and a choice of a 187-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine or two hybrid powertrains, each based on a turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder. The regular hybrid makes 226 hp combined, while the plug-in hybrid makes 261 hp combined and has the added bonus of 34 miles of electric-only driving range. The base engine and regular hybrid are offered with front- or all-wheel drive, but the PHEV is AWD-only. After a complete redesign for the 2023 model year, the Sportage has one of the most daring exteriors in a field of rivals that includes the Chevrolet Equinox, Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4 and Volkswagen Tiguan.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Kia Sportage?\n\nAfter its redesign for 2023, the Kia Sportage sees only minor revisions in standard equipment for 2024. Rear airbags and LED headlights are now standard on every Sportage. \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Kia Sportage Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n8-inch touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\n12.2-inch digital gauge cluster\nBluetooth\nFront USB-C port\nSix-speaker stereo\nForward collision warning with pedestrian and cyclist detection\nLane departure steering assist\nRain-sensing wipers\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nRear parking sensors\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n12.3-inch touchscreen\nNavigation\nWireless device charging\nPanoramic moonroof\nSynthetic leather upholstery\nHarman Kardon stereo\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHands-free power liftgate\nRemote park assist\nFront parking sensors\nReverse automatic emergency braking\n360-degree camera system\nShould I Buy the 2024 Kia Sportage?\n\nThe Sportage makes a very strong case for itself among compact five-seat SUVs, but the same can be said of a number of similarly well-rounded competitors in this category. The cabin is less polarizing than the exterior; the design is elegant and the trim materials are high-quality. The power and economy of the hybrid versions are impressive, but there’s no getting around the fact that the base four-cylinder quickly runs out of steam and feels unrefined. It’s a shame given how much attention has gone into the finer details of this Kia SUV.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Comfortable, beautifully appointed and packed with useful tech, the redesigned 2023 Kia Sportage is an outstanding compact SUV — made slightly sillier with a questionable new “off-road” trim level.\n\nVersus the competition: The Sportage is bigger and more comfortable inside than most competitors, and it blows them away in terms of fit, finish, usable tech, luxurious materials and sumptuous ride quality — but its base powertrain struggles to keep up with more powerful rivals.\n\nSouth Korean brand Kia makes and sells a lot of crossover-style SUVs — seven, to be precise. They offer varying levels of space and capability; some are more SUV-like, some more carlike, but none are designed for off-road capability. Apparently, this is something buyers are looking for if the explosion of off-road trim levels of car-based SUVs is anything to go by.\n\nNow, Kia has answered this call with the latest version of its compact crossover SUV, the 2023 Sportage. The automaker has added two new trim levels to the hierarchy — the X-Pro and a better-equipped one called X-Pro Prestige — meant to cater to buyers looking for a beefier, more butch look for their on-road SUV. Kia bills it as an off-road-capable package, and while we have our doubts about that claim, we did recently get some extensive on-road time behind the wheel of a 2023 Sportage X-Pro Prestige as part of a six-SUV comparison test. We’ve definitely figured out its … X-Pros and cons. (Sorry.)\n\nRelated: What’s the Best Compact SUV of 2023? \n\nLooks That Slay\n\nThere’s no denying the latest styling adventures from Kia (and sister brands Hyundai and Genesis) are decidedly polarizing. Personally, I think the latest Sportage looks fantastic; it’s not a derivative design by any means, and it’s different without looking dumb. From the dramatic boomerang-shaped daytime running lights up front, flanking Kia’s “tiger nose” grille, to the high horizontal taillights across the rear, the new Sportage looks sleek, modern and interesting.\n\nThe X-Pro trim levels keep the same wheel size as the base LX trim, at 17 inches, but add a bunch of black plastic cladding around the wheel arches and bumpers for a rugged off-road look. Its black wheels and chunky-tread all-terrain tires are perhaps the most off-road-functional parts of the X-Pro, as they legitimately do increase the SUV’s capabilities in the dirt. Tall-sidewall tires help absorb bumpy off-road terrain — which is a good thing, as the X-Pro’s shock absorbers aren’t any different from other Sportage variants. The Sportage X-Pro doesn’t even get any more ground clearance than other all-wheel-drive Sportages, nor does it have underbody skid plate protection. Or exposed tow hooks. Or any other equipment that would help it traverse rocky terrain with greater ease and less damage. I would be anxious to take an X-Pro any farther off-road than the dirt parking lot of my local farmer’s market. At least it can have a snazzy-looking two-tone paint job that’s exclusive to the X-Pro trims.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nLet’s Stick to Pavement\n\nSo you’re not likely to tackle the Rubicon Trail in a Sportage X-Pro. Frankly, that’s OK; for someone who wants a more rugged look from their Sportage, the X-Pro certainly fits the bill — and it’s only mildly hampered by its off-road tires when it comes to the on-road driving experience.\n\nA bigger hindrance to your on-road Zen might be the X-Pro’s 2.5-liter four-cylinder gasoline engine. The Sportage’s more powerful gas-electric hybrid and plug-in hybrid powertrains are not available on the X-Pro, so you’re stuck with the base 187-horsepower mill that has to work hard to get the new, larger Sportage moving smartly.\n\nThe powertrain generates more sound than fury. Acceleration is best described as adequate; the Sportage isn’t too slow, and for most people it’ll do for urban runabout duties and cross-country highway cruising. If you don’t compare it to competitors with available turbocharged engines, the Sportage feels acceptably peppy, though its transmission does feel rather slow to kick down when you ask for more power. Put it up against turbocharged offerings from Nissan, Honda, Mazda and Ford, however, and it feels underpowered and overburdened.\n\nSadly, the Sportage doesn’t justify its lack of power with superior fuel economy: It’s EPA-rated at 23/28/25 mpg city/highway/combined. Our roughly 330-mile road-trip fuel economy test saw it return 26.3 mpg on a windy day. The fuel-economy-conscious among you will want to forgo the X-Pro models and opt for one of the Sportage’s two available hybrid variants instead. The front-wheel-drive Sportage Hybrid, for example, is rated at 43 mpg combined.\n\nThe Sportage X-Pro’s handling is quite affected by its tires — it’s soft, it rolls, and it lacks the crispness of some of its competitors. On the other hand, it’s nicely balanced and doesn’t embarrass itself on twisty roads, and what you lose in handling precision, you more than make up for in ride quality: The Sportage X-Pro soaks up bumps like a champ thanks to those balloony tires. Few road imperfections make it into the cabin, and the tires nicely mute those that do. The Sportage X-Pro practically wafts down the road, and driving it around town is a lovely experience.\n\nOut on a high-speed highway, however, the downside of that smooth ride becomes apparent in the form of serious tire noise from the soft, chunky all-terrain rubber. Brake-pedal feel isn’t all that great, either, with a mushy initial bite. Suffice it to say that if you’re looking for something sporty, sharp-handling and engaging, you’ll want to try a different Sportage trim — possibly a hybrid variant. If you’re looking for maximum ride comfort, though, with just a splash of off-road capability and style, the X-Pro is your choice.\n\nThe Interior Sells It\n\nRegardless of trim level, what hands down sells you on the Sportage is its extraordinary interior. The top X-Pro Prestige trim is chock-full of eye-popping displays, beautifully assembled shapes, top-quality materials, and comfortable seating front and rear.\n\nLet’s start with the tech. Two digital screens, one of them a touchscreen, combine to form a sweeping panoramic digital dash that wouldn’t look out of place in a much more expensive vehicle. I’ve seen similar applications in Cadillacs and Mercedes-Benzes, but Kia might actually do the touchscreen a bit better. Its icons are better organized than Mercedes’, and touch sensitivity is excellent — meaning nothing requires multiple touches to activate.\n\nThe reconfigurability of the gauge cluster is also something to behold. There are several different schemes to choose from, and they make digital clusters from other automakers feel like wasted space by comparison. If you have a digital screen, you can do anything with the space, so why do so many brands (Volvo and Lincoln in particular come to mind) choose to do almost nothing? Kia has certainly made the most of it by turning it into an opportunity for artistic expression. It really adds to the feeling that you’ve purchased something special.\n\nDriver and passenger comfort is also excellent in the Sportage, with large, supportive seats front and rear that offer great legroom, plenty of headroom (even with a panoramic moonroof) and amazing outward visibility. The dash and beltline are very low in the Sportage, meaning everything is below chest level; you’ll reach forward and down to use the controls. This gives you a commanding view outward in all directions.\n\nThe cargo area is ample, as well, especially with the rear seats folded down for additional storage. The space is both tall and wide, so putting big, bulky objects back there shouldn’t be a challenge. The liftover height is also low, further easing that task.\n\nThe Sportage’s high-quality, spacious, well-laid-out interior really is what sells it. You’ll spend a lot more time inside your car than you will looking at the outside, so it sort of has to sell it, and Kia has done a fantastic job making the Sportage’s interior the benchmark of the class.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nIs the 2023 Kia Sportage Hybrid a Good SUV? 6 Pros and 4 Cons\n2023 Kia Sportage Hybrid Review: Great (With a Catch)\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2023 Kia Sportage Hybrid?\n2023 Kia Sportage Hybrid’s $28,545 Starting Price Undercuts Rivals\nKia Expands 2023 Sportage Lineup With New Plug-In Hybrid\nStill a Good Value\n\nThe variety of flavors of Sportage offered, and the various levels of equipment that come in those trims, mean there’s a version for just about everyone. The lineup starts with a well-equipped LX FWD model for $27,615 (all prices include destination), moving up to the EX, X-Line AWD, SX, SX Prestige, X-Pro, and X-Pro Prestige. My loaded X-Pro Prestige test vehicle rang in at $38,815.\n\nThe hybrid and plug-in hybrid powertrains are more expensive. The Sportage Hybrid starts with an LX FWD for $28,815, moving up to a mid-level EX and a top SX Prestige, the latter with a starting price of $37,715. The plug-in hybrid has 34 miles of rated electric-only range and comes in two trim levels: X-Line ($40,015) and the X-Line Prestige ($44,515).\n\nEven the base Sportage LX is well equipped, representing an excellent value for the space, equipment and high-quality elements you get. Our loaded X-Pro Prestige felt like a screaming value for its price, with luxurious digs and top-notch tech, space and capabilities; if only it had a bit more oomph from its four-cylinder engine, it’d be a total knockout in the class. As it stands, with a just-adequate powerplant, the Sportage is still one heck of an effort. It’s worth adding to your shopping list.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nKias SUV gets minor changes this year, but bigger news is in the works for 2002, when a longer-wheelbase model is expected to arrive in the United States, perhaps with a V-6 engine. Until then, the Sportage continues as a two-door convertible and a four-door wagon.\n\nKia is based in South Korea and is currently owned by Hyundai, the countrys largest auto manufacturer. Kia now has the same warranty as Hyundai, a change that reflects the new ownership. The whole vehicle is covered for five years/60,000 miles, major powertrain components for 10 years/100,000 miles and corrosion for five years/100,000 miles. Buyers also receive free roadside assistance the first five years.\n\nExterior\nThe convertible has a hardtop over the front seats and a folding canvas top over the rear seats. The wagon is all hardtop and is 170 inches long, about 14 inches longer than the convertible. Both carry a full-size spare tire on the tailgate, have trucklike body-on-frame construction and sport 7.9 inches of ground clearance to give them full offroad capability.\n\nInterior\nWith 11.5 inches more wheelbase than the two-door convertible, the four-door Sportage has a longer interior that provides more legroom and cargo room. The wagon seats five, and the convertible holds four. In addition to federally required front airbags designed to protect the head and upper body, a driver-side knee airbag is standard.\n\nPower door locks, windows and mirrors are standard on all models. The top-line EX model comes with a standard CD player, and leather seats are optional.\n\nUnder the Hood\nAll models use a 130-horsepower 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that teams with manual or automatic transmissions. Both body styles come with two-wheel drive or a part-time 4WD system that can be used on slippery surfaces.\n\n \n\nReported by Rick Popely  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2001 Buying Guide",
