      "expert_review": "The verdict: Compact SUVs are like bunnies: cute, small, virtually identical and just about everywhere. With so many out there, it’s hard to keep them all straight, but the 2023 Kia Sportage Hybrid stands out thanks to its roomy footprint, pleasant road manners and thoughtfully designed cabin.\n\nAgainst the competition: The Sportage leads the compact SUV pack in value, room and infotainment system usability, but the hybrid model’s fuel economy was disappointing during a road trip.\n\nIn Kia’s SUV lineup, the Sportage sits between the tiny Seltos and three-row Sorento. Redesigned for 2023, the Sportage has grown in size and power, and Kia has added a hybrid model that looks nearly identical to the gas-powered version. See their specifications compared. I tested a hybrid model with all-wheel drive, which goes up against the likes of the Honda CR-V Hybrid and Toyota RAV4 Hybrid; see those three models’ specs compared.\n\nRelated: 2023 Kia Sportage Hybrid Joins the Party\n\nQuick and Thirsty\n\nThe hybrid is available in LX, EX and SX-Prestige trims. The LX comes with standard front-wheel drive or optional AWD, while EX and SX-Prestige trims have standard AWD. Power comes from a turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine combined with a 1.49-kilowatt-hour battery and 44-kilowatt electric motor, making for total system output of 227 horsepower. The setup is paired with a six-speed automatic transmission. (The non-hybrid version uses a 187-hp, 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine paired with an eight-speed automatic.)\n\nThe Sportage Hybrid’s brisk acceleration feels almost EV-like off the line; near instant torque from the electric motor and power from the turbo engine make for a peppy and engaging start. You can crank the drive mode selector to Sport for even more oomph on takeoff, and there’s also an Eco mode that does the opposite, dulling responsiveness to save gas. Especially in Sport mode, the Sportage Hybrid feels as quick as the RAV4 Hybrid and much quicker than the CR-V Hybrid.\n\nOn the road, the Sportage cruises comfortably, with a smooth ride, composed handling, no-nonsense shifts and precise steering with good feedback. Choosing Sport mode adds some heft to the steering for those looking for a firmer feel. It’s pretty quiet, too: The Sportage’s engine noise is well muted, as are the vehicle’s electrical whirring sounds — a hybrid hallmark that can annoy in other models, including the RAV4 Hybrid. The Sportage also lacks the odd, heavy brake pedal feel that’s typical of many hybrids’ regenerative braking systems; instead, the Sportage Hybrid’s braking action is linear, with natural pedal feel.\n\nHybrid MPG Miss\n\nThe Sportage Hybrid does, however, have its faults, including one that was a biggie in my test: disappointing real-world fuel economy on a road trip. The Sportage Hybrid has an EPA rating of 42/44/43  mpg city/highway/combined with FWD. AWD affects the numbers considerably, lowering its combined mileage to 38 mpg. In practice, though, I achieved well short of all of these figures.\n\nDuring a 408-mile road trip in an EX AWD model, I averaged a weak-sauce 33.8 mpg combined. That said, conditions were not optimal, and my trip was full of gas-hogging mitigating factors: It consisted of mostly higher-speed highway driving, so there weren’t many opportunities for regenerative braking, which boosts efficiency. Also, ambient temperatures were hot, so the air conditioning was cranked, which also lowers efficiency. Lastly, the SUV was loaded with people and gear: two adults, two kids and a cargo area filled to the max.\n\nThe AWD-only 2022 Honda CR-V has an EPA rating of 40/35/38 mpg, with a more efficient redesigned version coming for 2023. Over 165 miles of mixed city and highway driving, I averaged 40.9 mpg in the CR-V Hybrid. It’s the same story with the AWD-only Toyota RAV4 Hybrid, which bettered its 41/38/40 mpg EPA ratings by returning an average of 44.2 mpg in our 165-mile loop. Granted, driving conditions were quite different on that mileage drive from my drive in the Sportage Hybrid: one occupant, no luggage and lower overall speeds thanks to a mix of city traffic, slower suburban roads and faster interstate highways.\n\nThere’s no EV mode allowing the Sportage to travel on electric power alone, but better mileage is on the horizon. A plug-in hybrid version of the Sportage will be out later in 2022, with an estimated 32 miles of EV-only range. If it’s anything like the charming and efficient plug-in hybrid Sorento, this forthcoming model may be the just-right version of the Sportage.\n\nThoughtfully Designed Interior\n\nAs with the exterior, very little differentiates the hybrid cabin from the gas-only version. The only tell is the gear selector: It’s a rotary dial in the hybrid, while gas-only versions have a more traditional lever.\n\nAt first glance, the Sportage’s cabin is forgettably average, with predictable design and acceptable amounts of hard and soft plastics. But wait — it’s actually not. There’s some cool stuff going on: Small innovations combine to create a thoughtfully designed cabin that’s flexible and well suited to carrying people and stuff.\n\nIn front, I appreciated the multisize cupholders that can be expanded to accommodate a large drink or contracted for a regular can or bottle. Also of note up front is a deep center console storage box that easily swallowed my family’s cache of road-trip snacks.\n\nA mom hack made the second row much more family-friendly: Kia molded two coat hangers into the front head restraints, but I used them as tablet holders for my homemade rear-seat entertainment system. (Use it this way at your own risk, however, as Kia says they weren’t designed to hold tablets. ) Below those hangers are integrated hooks for shopping bags or corralling charging cables, along with large pockets to hold more stuff.\n\nIn the back, spring-loaded cargo-area handles quickly and easily pop the seats down in a 60/40 split. The dual-level cargo floor is a handy touch for corralling smaller items, and there’s a bit of underfloor storage.\n\nControl Confusion\n\nI was impressed with the Sportage’s controls for the most part. Base trim models have an 8-inch touchscreen with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay integration. The EX trim I drove, however, has a larger 12.3-inch touchscreen paired with a newly available 12.3-inch gauge cluster screen; they combine for a sleek look and high-tech feel.\n\nI could use a little more low-tech when it comes to the knobs below the screen, however. While the touchscreen’s buttons and menu structure were straightforward and easy to navigate, a pair of knobs below the screen were awkward to use because they switch functions between temperature and audio controls, similar to the controls in Kia’s electric EV6 SUV. I’m all about sharing — except when it doesn’t make sense. With the push of a paper-airplane-shaped button, the left knob becomes volume control and the right knob changes the station or track. Push the fan button, and the knobs now control cabin temps. Here’s what (comically) happened several times during my drive: I’m listening to a song I like. I want to crank the volume. Instead, I crank the cabin temp to 80 degrees. It’s not a deal breaker, but it’s a quirk that caught me several times.\n\nThere’s one other oddity, but only for us Android users: Pairing my phone with Android Auto was seamless, but the display could be better. The Android Auto interface takes up about two-thirds of the screen, with a lot of wasted blank space on the right side . Connect an iPhone, on the other hand, and it uses 100% of the screen. Again, it’s not a deal breaker, just odd.\n\nAmple Room\n\nThe new Sportage is larger than the previous model and among the largest compact SUVs in the class. That translates to more occupant space and cargo room  than the outgoing model and its CR-V and RAV4 competitors, according to automaker-provided measurements.\n\nSecond-row headroom and legroom are ample for two adults, and the seats are supportive and comfortable. In our Car Seat Check, the Sportage Hybrid easily accommodated two car seats thanks to a roomy backseat and easy-access Latch anchors. My twins’ high-back booster seats fit well, I just had to remove the head restraints to situate the boosters flush against the seatback. The twins did need a little help buckling up, however. The outboard buckles were short and hard for them to find and grasp; the middle buckle is pretty floppy and may also be tough for kids to handle on their own.\n\nThe cargo area is deep and wide, easily swallowing a week’s worth of my family’s luggage. Kia says the Sportage Hybrid has 39.6 cubic feet of space behind the backseat — about 9 cubic feet  more than the outgoing Sportage and more than hybrid versions of the CR-V (33.2) and RAV4 (37.5). Bear in mind, however, that manufacturer-provided specs aren’t always a direct comparison because not every automaker measures cargo volume the same way.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2023 Kia Sportage Hybrid?\n2023 Kia Sportage Hybrid’s $28,545 Starting Price Undercuts Rivals\n2022 Kia EV6 Review: Doing It Better Than Most\nFind Your Next Car\nSafety and Value\n\nThe Sportage Hybrid also impresses in the safety and value departments. The base Sportage Hybrid LX starts at $28,585 (all prices include destination charges) with standard FWD; AWD adds $1,800. The EX and SX-Prestige have standard AWD and start at $32,285 and $37,485, respectively. The starting price for the base Sportage Hybrid is $1,300 higher than the gas-only Sportage  LX, while the EX hybrid carries a $1,200 premium over the gas-only EX with AWD.\n\nA suite of advanced driver-assistance systems comes standard  across all trims, including driver attention warning, a rear occupant detection system, lane-centering steering, lane keep assist, and forward collision avoidance with cyclist detection and autonomous emergency braking. Optional add-ons include a blind spot monitor with collision avoidance, rear cross-traffic alert, reverse automatic emergency braking and navigation-based smart  cruise control.\n\nThe Sportage Hybrid’s sub-$30,000 starting price makes it competitive in its class. The 2022 Honda CR-V Hybrid starts at $33, 255, while the 2022 RAV4 Hybrid starts at $30,910 — although it’s worth noting that these models have standard AWD. Even with AWD, however, the Sportage Hybrid is still a few hundred dollars less than the RAV4 Hybrid.\n\nWith a strong blend of space, comfort and value, the 2023 Kia Sportage stands out as a compact SUV. On a road trip, however, it disappointed as a hybrid.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "After a redesign for 2023 and minor updates for 2024, Kia’s Sportage compact SUV enters the 2025 model year with few changes. For 2025, the EX trim will offer a Premium Package and the X-Line and X-Pro trims add dark exterior trim. Prices are also up slightly; the 2025 Kia Sportage starts at $28,565, up from the 2024 model’s $28,865 base price (all prices include $1,375 destination).\n\nRelated: Kia Expands 2023 Sportage Lineup With New Plug-In Hybrid\n\nFor 2025, the newly available Premium Package adds a panoramic moonroof and smart power liftgate. Other changes for the new model year include additional standard dark-toned exterior trim for the X-Line and X-Pro trims, such as gloss black on the front and rear bumpers, as well as side sills; the X-Line also gets gloss-black alloy wheels, and both trims get additional black badges.\n\nThe Sportage’s powertrains carryover for 2025. Power comes from a 187-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine or two hybrid powertrains, each based on a turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder. The hybrid makes 227 hp combined, while the plug-in hybrid makes a total of 261 hp; the PHEV has 34 miles of electric-only driving range. Front- and all-wheel drive are available.\n\nWhile official figures for the 2025 model are not yet available, the base FWD variant of the 2024 Sportage is good for an EPA-estimated 25/33/28 mpg city/highway/combined. The FWD hybrid is rated 42/44/43 mpg (AWD drops figures to 38/38/38 mpg), and the plug-in version has an 84 mpg-equivalent rating and 35 mpg combined rating.\n\nPricing and Availability\n\nThe 2025 Sportage will go on sale soon. Model-year 2025 trim-level pricing for gas, hybrid and PHEV variants is as follows:\n\nSportage\nLX FWD: $28,565\nEX FWD: $30,665\nSX FWD: $34,165\nSX-Prestige FWD: $36,165\nLX AWD: $30,365\nEX AWD: $32,465\nX-Line AWD: $33,465\nX-Pro AWD: $37,665\nSX-Prestige AWD: $37,965\nX-Pro Prestige AWD: $39,465\nSportage Hybrid\nLX FWD: $29,965\nLX AWD: $31,765\nEX AWD: $33,765\nSX-Prestige AWD: $38,965\nSportage Plug-In Hybrid\nX-Line AWD: $41,065\nX-Line Prestige AWD: $45,565\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nIs the 2023 Kia Sportage Hybrid a Good SUV? 6 Pros and 4 Cons\n2023 Kia Sportage Hybrid Review: Great (With a Catch)\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2023 Kia Sportage Hybrid?\nFind Your Next Car\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Kia Sportage?\n\nThe Kia Sportage is a compact SUV with seating for five and a choice of a 187-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine or two hybrid powertrains, each based on a turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder. The regular hybrid makes 226 hp combined, while the plug-in hybrid makes 261 hp combined and has the added bonus of 34 miles of electric-only driving range. The base engine and regular hybrid are offered with front- or all-wheel drive, but the PHEV is AWD-only. After a complete redesign for the 2023 model year, the Sportage has one of the most daring exteriors in a field of rivals that includes the Chevrolet Equinox, Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4 and Volkswagen Tiguan.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Kia Sportage?\n\nAfter its redesign for 2023, the Kia Sportage sees only minor revisions in standard equipment for 2024. Rear airbags and LED headlights are now standard on every Sportage. \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Kia Sportage Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n8-inch touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\n12.2-inch digital gauge cluster\nBluetooth\nFront USB-C port\nSix-speaker stereo\nForward collision warning with pedestrian and cyclist detection\nLane departure steering assist\nRain-sensing wipers\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nRear parking sensors\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n12.3-inch touchscreen\nNavigation\nWireless device charging\nPanoramic moonroof\nSynthetic leather upholstery\nHarman Kardon stereo\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHands-free power liftgate\nRemote park assist\nFront parking sensors\nReverse automatic emergency braking\n360-degree camera system\nShould I Buy the 2024 Kia Sportage?\n\nThe Sportage makes a very strong case for itself among compact five-seat SUVs, but the same can be said of a number of similarly well-rounded competitors in this category. The cabin is less polarizing than the exterior; the design is elegant and the trim materials are high-quality. The power and economy of the hybrid versions are impressive, but there’s no getting around the fact that the base four-cylinder quickly runs out of steam and feels unrefined. It’s a shame given how much attention has gone into the finer details of this Kia SUV.",

      "expert_review": "Is the 2026 Kia Sportage Hybrid a Good SUV?\n\nThe Kia Sportage Hybrid is a spacious, nicely balanced everyday hauler that sports a few unconventional styling touches and boasts a pleasantly upscale look and feel in its top trim level.\n\nHow Does the 2026 Kia Sportage Hybrid Compare With Other Compact SUVs?\n\nAmong mainstream-brand hybrid compact SUVs, the all-wheel-drive Sportage Hybrid’s Kia-estimated fuel economy of 35 mpg in combined driving is on par with the related 2025 Hyundai Tucson Hybrid. However, its gas mileage trails class leaders like the 2025 Honda CR-V Hybrid and 2025 Toyota RAV4 Hybrid by 2-4 mpg.\n\nKia’s current-generation Sportage compact SUV debuted for 2023 with upsized dimensions and its first available hybrid and plug-in hybrid powertrains. For 2026, the entire Sportage family receives a nicely executed refresh that brings updated styling and some welcome new standard and available features. For this review, I attended the 2026 Sportage Hybrid’s press preview event in Louisville, Ky., where I drove the top-of-the-line SX-Prestige trim level. (Per our ethics policy, Cars.com pays for its own airfare and lodging when attending such manufacturer-sponsored events.)\n\nRelated: What’s the Best Compact SUV for 2025?\n\nWhat’s New for the Refreshed 2026 Kia Sportage?\n\nThe 2023 Sportage inaugurated an unorthodox front-end treatment that included boomerang-shaped daytime running lights and swoopy body-lines. A face-lift for 2026 brings a slightly blockier, more conventional look, with daytime running lights that make the Sportage look more like a downsized version of Kia’s mid-size Sorento SUV. If you found the previous Sportage’s looks to be a bit too much, the 2026’s mildly toned-down visage might be more to your liking, and it still stands out enough that you’re unlikely to have any trouble finding it in a crowded parking lot.\n\nThe gas-only Sportage’s 187-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine carries over unchanged, but both hybrid powertrains get a slight power boost thanks to upgraded electric motors. The conventional hybrid is up 5 hp, to 232 hp total, while the PHEV is up 7 hp for a total of 268 hp.\n\nAmong the new standard features are a two-spoke steering wheel with a squared-off shape, an updated panoramic dashboard panel with dual 12.3-inch displays and wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto (higher trim levels get an upgraded gauge cluster screen and infotainment system). Newly available features include a 10-inch multifunction head-up display, heated outboard rear seats, side parking sensors and an upgraded version of Kia’s Highway Driving Assist system.\n\nIn addition to the previous drive-mode settings, AWD Sportages get a standard Terrain mode with driver-selectable settings for snow, mud and sand. Additionally, the Sportage Hybrid lineup expands with new S and X-Line trim levels, both with dark-finish accents.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nHow Does the 2026 Kia Sportage Hybrid Drive?\n\nYou’d probably have to drive a 2025 and a 2026 Sportage Hybrid back to back to notice any difference in power delivery, but the SX Prestige I drove supplied respectably peppy, if not instantaneous, acceleration. The Sportage Hybrid’s conventional six-speed automatic transmission might seem a little archaic on paper compared to the continuously variable automatic transmissions of other hybrid powertrains, but it performs well. Overall, the Sportage Hybrid’s power delivery is smooth and mostly seamless.\n\nUnlike the squared-off steering wheels in some vehicles I’ve driven, the Sportage’s new steering wheel wasn’t awkward for me to use and didn’t introduce any instrument panel visibility issues. The steering feel itself is responsive but relaxed. Even among compact SUVs, the Sportage is no corner carver; it’s tuned for comfort more than crisp handling. The ride quality is comfortable and absorbent overall, but the Sportage’s composure can be upset by sharp bumps in the middle of a turn, as on a freeway on-ramp. Our test drives were entirely on pavement, so I didn’t get the chance to test the effectiveness of the Sportage’s new Terrain mode system.\n\nHow Is the 2026 Kia Sportage Hybrid’s Fuel Economy?\n\nWe haven’t had the chance to do real-world fuel-economy testing yet, either, but the best average fuel economy on the dashboard display during my driving was 34.2 mpg. That’s on par with estimates of 35/36/35 mpg city/highway/combined for AWD Sportage Hybrid trims, but it’s not outstanding for a hybrid compact SUV. It trails by 2-3 mpg the real-world numbers we achieved on a different drive route in a 2025 Honda CR-V hybrid and a 2024 Toyota RAV4 Hybrid. Kia’s gas mileage estimates for the front-wheel-drive Sportage Hybrid are an impressive 41/44/42 mpg, but FWD comes only in the entry-level LX trim.\n\nWhat Is the 2026 Kia Sportage Hybrid’s Interior Like?\n\nThe cabin ambiance in the line-topping SX-Prestige trim is suitably upscale, helped by a full complement of comfort and convenience features. The easy-to-use rotary gear selector and clever retractable cupholders aren’t new, but they’re still among my favorite features. The combination control panel that toggles between climate and audio controls is another carryover feature; it takes a little getting used to because it’s easy to forget to change from climate to audio mode and vice versa. However, the Sportage’s cargo area and backseat space are still among the most generous in the class. I’m 6 feet, 6 inches tall, and I had decent comfort in the backseat with the front seat positioned all the way back.\n\nShould You Buy a 2026 Kia Sportage Hybrid?\n\nThe Kia Sportage Hybrid was already a solid entry in a hotly contested class, and the updates it receives for 2026 enhance its standing. Its pricing remains highly competitive, too, especially considering the generous levels of standard equipment; including destination, prices start at $31,735 for the base LX trim and run to $41,835 for the SX-Prestige. The 2026 Kia Sportage lineup is arriving in dealerships now.\n\nMore Kia Sportage News From Cars.com:\n\n2026 Kia Sportage Up Close: Nothing Broken, No Fixing Required\nFace-Lifted 2026 Kia Sportage Gets More Standard Tech, Hybrid Gets (Slightly) More Power and Trims\nHow Much Is the 2026 Kia Sportage Hybrid?\nHow Much Is the 2026 Kia Sportage Plug-in Hybrid?\n2025 Kia Sportage: Minor Content Change, Minor Price Change\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
