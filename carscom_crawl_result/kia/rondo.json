      "expert_review": "A faltering economy and robust fuel prices are certainly taking their toll on the automotive environment. Everyone, from major car companies to local dealerships, are feeling the heat.\n\nFor average drivers, especially those with big families or young families, there’s a whole new way of looking at their people movers. Money may be tight but they still favor a vehicle that has plenty of seats while also being inexpensive, fuel efficient, safe, reliable and comfortable. Not too ugly, either.\n\nTall order, and the void left by no-longer-desirable mammoth SUVs is hard to fill. For many people, even the standard-issue minivan is looking big and bulbous and wasteful.\n\nHere’s where Kia Rondo fits in with a pint-size minivan that could reasonably serve those who are stunned by current financial events. Though not as roomy as a standard minivan (the third row of seats is strictly for little kids) and lacking the ruggedness of an SUV, Rondo does deliver on those attributes listed above.\n\nThe compact-minivan niche is small indeed, with only Mazda5 competing for the same ground. But watch for this practical vehicle type to grow in numbers as more people downsize for economy.\n\nThough small and modestly priced, Rondo makes few compromises in drivability or accommodations. Hardly exciting the drive, the little van handles decently, rides comfortably and gets good performance from the 185-horsepower V-6. A 162-horsepower inline-4 comes standard on base models.\n\nSticklers for details might note that Rondo does not have that signature feature of today’s minivans: sliding rear doors. Instead, there are regular back doors like those on a sedan.\n\nThat’s a minor issue and shouldn’t deter those who view regular minivans as not mini enough.\n\nKia Rondo EX V-6\n\nVehicle type: Seven-passenger, four-door minivan, front-wheel drive.\n\nEngine: 2.7-liter V-6, 185 horsepower at 6,000 rpm, 182 pound-feet of torque at 4,000 rpm.\n\nTransmission: Five-sped automatic.\n\nWheelbase: 106.3 inches.\n\nOverall length: 179 inches.\n\nCurb weight: 3,443 pounds.\n\nEPA rating: 18 city, 26 highway.\n\nHIGHS: Thoughtful interior, engine power, compact size.\n\nLOWS: Mushy suspension, dowdy styling, teeny third-row seat.\n\nPERFORMANCE: The V-6 accelerates smartly and provides quiet freeway cruising. The five-speed automatic performs well enough, with occasional clunks.\n\nFuel mileage is not bad though not great. I averaged about 22 mpg.\n\nDRIVABILITY: Rondo feels balanced and competent in turns, though the soft suspension allows plenty of body sway. I’d like the ride to be more firm.\n\nThe steering is responsive and the four-wheel disc brakes are plenty strong. Standard safety features include antilock brakes, electronic stability control and full-length side air-bag curtains.\n\nSTYLING: Rondo has that jelly-bean-on-wheels look of a typical minivan, with a sloping nose and a chiseled rear. Not sure what the designers might have done otherwise, but the styling is pretty dull.\n\nINTERIOR: The interior in the test Rondo felt upmarket, with a good-looking dashboard and materials that seemed high quality.\n\nThe middle seat slides fore and aft for legroom, which helps it feel fairly roomy, though still tight for three across. As for the optional rear-most seat, well, unless you have very young children or just sometimes need extra seating, skip it.\n\nThere’s essentially no luggage space behind it, though it and the middle row flop easily into the floor for a flat loading deck.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Base models start at $17,000, and Kia shares its excellent warranty with parent company Hyundai: 10 years or 10,000 miles powertrain, five years or 60,000 miles for everything else.\n\nBase price: $20,195\n\nPrice as tested: $23,495\n\nOPTIONS\n\nPower sunroof, audio system upgrade, $1,200.\n\nLeather seats, $1,000.\n\nThird row seat, $500.\n\nShipping, $600.",

      "expert_review": "One of the biggest challenges in this new world of high fuel prices is how to haul an entire family of seven without using a giant vehicle that drinks gas faster than you can afford to pump it?\n\nNot to worry.\n\nKia now has a small crossover that can carry your big family or group of friends, yet won’t require frequent visits to the gas pumps for $75 fill-ups.\n\nIt’s the new Rondo, introduced earlier this year as a 2007 model. This is a remarkable little wagonlike crossover that has an optional third row of seating, making it the least-expensive and most fuel-efficient family hauler on the market.\n\nHow inexpensive? With the $500 extra for the third seat, our test vehicle, the Rondo LX midlevel model, listed for $18,995, including $600 freight.\n\nAnd its EPA ratings using the new 2008 formula (more realistic than the previous way of estimating mileage) are 19 miles per gallon in the city and 26 on the highway with the base four-cylinder engine. The tank holds 15.8 gallons of fuel, about half as much as some of the big SUVs.\n\nThe Rondo is one of six new vehicles Kia has introduced in the United States since January 2006 as the company, a subsidiary of South Korea’s Hyundai, pushes for a bigger share of the U.S. market. Fuel efficiency is one of the key attributes of most Kia vehicles, and helps add to the value equation.\n\nThese cars usually are priced less than their Japanese competitors, and have a much-better warranty, as well — extended powertrain coverage for 10 years/100,000 miles. The basic warranty covers the vehicle for five years/60,000 miles, and includes 24-hour roadside assistance.\n\nRondo’s only direct competitor is the Mazda 5, a microvan that also comes with a third seat. But it has room for only six, and when equipped comparably to the seven-passenger Rondo, costs a bit more.\n\nThe Rondo’s third seat is intended for occasional use, but unlike the third row in some of the other compact crossovers, the Rondo’s has enough room to hold two average-size adults. The middle seat has space for three, and there are bucket seats up front.\n\nKia says its target customers for the Rondo are “people starting a new stage in life,” primarily young couples 25-35 without children, and couples 30-40 with a child or two. But I expect this car to be a favorite among empty nesters who occasionally need the third seat for family outings with the grandkids.\n\nThe Rondo is new to the U.S. market, but Kia has sold the vehicle as the Carens in the rest of the world for several years. This is its third generation.\n\nFor consumers who want just an inexpensive little crossover without the third seat or even air conditioning, the Rondo LX base model that begins at $16,995 (with freight). That one cannot be upgraded with the third seat or any other options except air conditioning, which adds $900.\n\nIt’s not a stripped-down vehicle, though, even at that entry price. It comes with an AM/FM/single-disc CD player, as well as power windows, mirrors and door locks, among other standard features.\n\nSafety features standard on all models include electronic stability control, four-wheel antilock brakes, front seat-mounted side air bags, and side-curtain air bags for all three rows. Having all of these features in a small wagon in this price range is unusual.\n\nUnder the hood is the 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine. A four-speed automatic is standard with the four-cylinder engine, which turns out 162 horsepower and 164 foot-pounds of torque.\n\nFor more power, you can upgrade to the LX V-6 ($19,495). It comes with a 2.7-liter V-6 engine rated at 182 horsepower and 182 foot-pounds of torque. With the engine upgrade comes a five-speed automatic.\n\nEPA ratings for this one are 18 city/26 highway, nearly the same as the four-cylinder. No manual transmission is offered with either engine, although some folks might prefer a manual model if the price were lower and the fuel economy better.\n\nI have driven the Rondo with both engines, and while the extra zip of the V-6 makes it a bit more fun to drive, the base engine has plenty of power for everyday use. The V-6 might be best, though, if the car is loaded with seven people very often.\n\nThe top Rondo model is the EX, which starts at $19, 795 with the four-cylinder engine and four-speed automatic, and $20,795 with the V-6 and five-speed. Oddly, though, the EX four-cylinder is not offered with the third seat; it’s optional only on the EX V-6 and the midlevel LX and LX V-6.\n\nKia believes consumers will shop the Rondo against the Toyota Matrix/Pontiac Vibe wagon as well as the Mazda 5. The Scion xB and xD also will be competitors, although none of these competitors has the third-seat option.\n\nThe Rondo is roomier than the Matrix/Vibe and Mazda 5, because it is built on the chassis of the midsize Kia Optima sedan. The Mazda 5 is on the chassis of the compact Mazda 3 sedan.\n\nRondo’s exterior is similar to that of the Matrix, but it’s also somewhat like that of two larger crossovers, Honda CR-V and Mitsubishi Outlander, both of which cost much more.\n\nCalling the Rondo a crossover might be a stretch, though, because it does not have an all-wheel-drive option and it has limited ground clearance (less than seven inches fully loaded). It comes only with front-wheel drive; all-wheel drive is available on the CR-V and Outlander, but not on the Matrix/Vibe or Mazda 5.\n\nThere would not be enough room for the third seat if the drive system were extended to the rear wheels, Kia said. Fuel economy also was a factor in deciding not to offer all-wheel drive, which usually lowers a vehicle’s gas mileage.\n\nThe Rondo is surprisingly roomy, especially up front. The bucket seats are quite comfortable even for larger people, and middle-row passengers have decent leg and knee room. All passengers are provided cupholders. We put the 9-year-old twins in the third seat, and didn’t hear any complaints. They thought it was “cool” riding back there.\n\nOne drawback is that there is only a small cargo area behind the third seat – 6.5 cubic feet. But when that seat is folded away, the space behind the second seat expands to 31.7 cubic feet. Without a third seat at all, there is 35 cubic feet of cargo space. The third seat has a 50/50 folding feature, creating a flat load floor, and the middle seat has a 60/40 split.\n\nCloth seats are standard, but leather is offered on EX models for $1,000, which also includes front seat heaters. A six-way manually adjustable driver’s seat with height adjustment is standard, along with a four-way adjustable front passenger seat.\n\nThe middle row slides forward up to almost a foot to allow for easy access to the third row. In models without the third row, the middle seat does not move. Without the third seat, there are storage bins with lids in the cargo-area floor, in the space where the third seat would otherwise fold out of the way.\n\nOther options offered on the Rondo include a body trim kit ($995); crossbars for the integrated roof rails ($200); an LX convenience package ($300), which adds remote keyless entry and cruise control (already included on EX); and a premium package ($1,200), which tacks on a power sunroof, upgraded Infinity 10-speaker, 315-watt audio system with six-disc CD changer).\n\nNeither audio system provides an external input jack for an iPod or other MP3 player.\n\nOur seven-passenger test car came with the roof rails and LX convenience package, for a total sticker of $19,495, including freight.\n\nG.
