      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nWhen it hits dealerships at the end of 2013, the redesigned 2014 Koup will be the third body style in the new Kia Forte generation, following the sedan and four-door hatchback, aka 5-Door. With the addition of a turbocharged engine option, this will be the most powerful Forte Koup to date.\n\nThe coupe competes with the Honda Civic Si, Hyundai Veloster Turbo and Volkswagen GTI.\n\nExterior\nThe Forte Koup’s exterior has grown in ways that ultimately benefit interior volume. Its wheelbase and overall length are about 2 inches longer, and it’s more than a half-inch wider and almost a half-inch taller.\n\nThe Koup styling was updated to match the Kia family appearance. The base EX trim level has standard 16-inch alloy wheels, while the SX has 18-inch alloy wheels. The SX also has a larger front bumper and larger grilles with gloss-black inserts. It adds turn signal lights to the side mirrors. Around back it has LED taillights, dual chrome tailpipes and a diffuser with a mock carbon-fiber finish. \n\nBoth trim levels have power-folding side mirrors standard and offer optional xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights.\n\nInterior\nThe 2014 Koup is roomier, to the tune of more than 3 cubic feet of occupant volume — or 1.3 additional cubic feet if equipped with a moonroof, which eats up some space.\n\nFront legroom has come down nearly 1.5 inches but remains generous; the backseat legroom has jumped a welcome 2 inches. Likewise, front headroom has dropped fractionally, but the backseat has gained an inch.\n\nThe redesigned interior is richer. Leather is standard on the steering wheel and shift knob, and optional on the seats for both trim levels. The SX adds alloy pedals and faux carbon-fiber trim.\n\nThe EX comes well equipped with Kia’s UVO voice recognition system, backup camera, Bluetooth, tilt/telescoping steering wheel, cruise control, power windows and LED running lights and fog lights.\n\nOptions for both trim levels include navigation, a moonroof, remote keyless entry, push-button start, dual-zone climate control and leather seats with a heated front passenger seat, and heated and a cooled driver’s seat.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Forte Koup’s base engine in the EX is a 2.0-liter four-cylinder that produces 173 horsepower and 154 pounds-feet of torque. The SX gets a 201-hp, turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder that delivers 195 pounds-feet of torque. Mileage estimates aren’t final as of this writing, but the EPA recently rated the sedan version of the 2.0-liter Forte sedan at 24/36/28 mpg city/highway/combined with the six-speed automatic, which is the only option for the EX Koup. The SX will be available with either a six-speed manual or automatic transmission.\n\nThe automatic SX includes steering-wheel-mounted shift paddles. The only mechanical difference for the SX, apart from the drivetrain and wheel size, is slightly larger front brake discs. Both trim levels have the new Flex Steer feature, which allows the driver to vary the amount of power-steering assist by selecting among Comfort, Normal and Sport modes.\n\nSafety\nStandard safety features include the required antilock brakes, electronic stability system with traction control and six airbags: frontal, front-seat-mounted side-impact airbags, and side curtains along the front and rear seats.",

      "expert_review": "With a nip here, a tuck there, Kia transformed its staid Spectra into a larger sedan catering to older motorists looking for fashionable styling and a roomy, comfortable cabin that they can slip into without taking a deep breath.\n\nThe creation: the 2010 Kia Forte.\n\nA success, which as we know breeds a coupe: smaller, fewer doors and sporty, with an attractive honeycomb grille and a low, wide stance that looks ready for action.\n\nThe creation: the 2010 Forte Koup, a first from Kia of South Korea.\n\nThe major difference between sedan and Koup is the target audience. That the Koup is aimed at a younger crowd is obvious when you slip behind the wheel and spot the iPod, USB and auxiliary plugs in the lower dash to please the sound gods.\n\nCouple gripes, however, one being the use of the word Koup rather than the traditional word. It’s meant to be cute, but in a world in which motorists can barely pronounce Mitsubishi and more than half those who own an Infiniti spell it Infinity, Koup doesn’t make for warm and fuzzy feelings.\n\nThe other is size. The two-door is built on the same compact, 104.3-inch wheelbase as the sedan, but is 2 inches shorter in length, 2.4 inches lower in height and a half-inch narrower in width, numbers that translate into less cabin room and, therefore, less comfort. The Koup offers 6.1 cubic feet less interior space and 2 cubic feet less cargo room than the sedan.\n\nThat means your melon dances against the roof and rear window, and your knees are not welcome in the back seat. Front seats slide (manually) forward to create a very small aisle to squeeze in back.\n\nThe small dimensions also put stowage space at a premium. Even the glove box is small, as is the room under the center armrest and the tray in the front console.\n\nDespite the downsizing, the trunk seems more than adequate for gear or groceries, providing nothing’s too tall, as the opening isn’t very high. But the split rear seatbacks do fold to hold more stuff.\n\nThe front-wheel-drive Koup comes in EX and sportier SX versions. The EX is powered by a 2-liter, 156-horsepower 4-cylinder teamed with 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic; the SX a 2.4-liter, 173-hp 4 with a 6-speed manual or 5-speed automatic. We tested the SX with automatic, the sports version that complements the higher-output 4-cylinder with a sports suspension and larger 17-inch radials.\n\nKia boasts that its Koup is livelier in sprinting from the light than its Honda Civic, Ford Focus or Chevrolet Cobalt coupe rivals. While blessed with enough energy to take off, pass or merge, you can leave the stopwatch and race gloves at home. It doesn’t sizzle.\n\nRide is jostle-free. Wide and well-cushioned front seats contribute to the smoothness. Handling is good. The sport-tuned suspension and 17-inch radials keep it on target; no wandering. Stability and traction control are standard to ensure excellent road manners.\n\nKoup’s claim to fame is providing low-cost, high-mileage transportation for those who can’t or refuse to spend lots of dough for an attractive vehicle that doesn’t advertise cheapness. It’s an econocoupe posing as a sports model.\n\nThe 2-liter 4 is rated at a pleasing 25 mpg city/34 highway with manual or automatic, while the 2.4-liter 4 is still thrifty at 22/32 mpg with manual and 23/31 with automatic. Either engine promises to take you more than 400 miles between fills.\n\nThe Koup EX starts at $16,595 ($17,595 automatic); the SX automatic at $18,500 ($17,695 with manual). Add $1,000 for heated leather seats and $700 for a power moonroof, plus a $695 freight charge, and the sticker just tops $20,000.\n\nNot bad for a car that comes with a wealth of goodies: air conditioning, power windows/mirrors/locks (with keyless entry), cruise control, side-curtain air bags, AM/FM/CD/MP3 audio, Bluetooth connectivity, digital clock and sporty metal pedals.\n\nNeat features include rich-looking grained dash and door trim, easy-to-see-and-use controls in the center stack and a pair of power plugs in the center console flanking the iPod/USB/auxiliary ports. Like the cost-conscious Forte sedan, there’s no navi system or backup camera. Get a map and use the rearview mirror.\n\nRead Jim Mateja Sunday in Rides. Contact him at transportation@tribune.com.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe Forte is Kia’s latest entry in the compact-car segment, replacing the Spectra when it hit dealerships in summer 2009. The Forte is available with a choice of four-cylinder engines and comes standard with numerous safety features, including an electronic stability system. It’s sold as a four-door sedan, a hatchback and a coupe, which Kia calls the Koup. Competitors include the Honda Civic, Ford Focus and Toyota Corolla.\n\nNew for 2011\nThere is a new hatchback version that Kia calls a five-door, and all trims get either a six-speed manual or automatic transmission.  (Skip to details on the: Forte Koup)\n\nExterior\nThe Forte sports crisp styling that gives the sedan an athletic shape. You don’t have to look too closely to find resemblances to other small cars. The front end, for instance, looks similar to a Honda Civic coupe, and the Forte’s taillights look like the Mitsubishi Lancer’s. For 2011, a new hatchback version carries over many of the Forte sedan’s styling cues, but the roofline carries straight back to form a hatch-back body style. Exterior features include:\n\n\nStandard 15-inch wheels\nOptional 16-inch wheels\nSX versions get sport suspension, 17-inch alloy wheels and a rear spoiler\nOptional sunroof\n\nInterior\nThere are available steering-wheel-mounted audio and cruise controls. Kia says the sedan’s trunk offers 14.7 cubic feet of cargo space, and the hatchback has 19.4 cubic feet of storage space. Interior features include:\n\n\nStandard cloth seats\nOptional leather\nOptional heated seats and steering wheel\nOptional air conditioning\nOptional keyless entry\nOptional telescoping steering wheel\n\nUnder the Hood\nLX and EX models are powered by a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that makes 156 horsepower. Choosing the SX trim brings a 2.4-liter four-cylinder that generates 173 hp. Depending on which trim is ordered, a six-speed manual or a six-speed automatic transmission is available.\n\nSafety\nThe Forte has safety features such as:\n\n\nSide-impact airbags for the front seats\nSide curtain airbags\nElectronic stability system\nActive head restraints for the front seats\n\nForte Koup\nThe Forte’s two-door offshoot — Kia calls it the Koup— comes in the sedan’s two upper trims, EX and SX. Drivetrains follow suit, with the EX getting the 2.0-liter four-cylinder and the SX getting the 2.4-liter four-cylinder. A six-speed manual and automatic transmission are available with both engines and trim levels.\n\n\nStandard blacked-out grille and air dam\nStandard 16-inch wheels\nOptional 17-inch wheels\nOptional sport package with larger brakes and sport-tuned suspension\nStandard seats have larger bolsters\nCloth upholstery standard\nLeather upholstery optional\n\nBack to Top",
