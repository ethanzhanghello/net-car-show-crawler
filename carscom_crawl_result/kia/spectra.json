      "expert_review": "Korean manufacturers like Kia Motors Co. and its parent Hyundai Motor Co. are slipping into more and more automotive segments, from sport-utility vehicles to near-luxury sedans. But their bread-and-butter products continue to be small cars that provide basic transportation for buyers on a budget. Sometimes those small cars can get pretty glitzy-looking. Take the new Kia Spectra, a hatchback companion to the Kia Sephia with a base price of just under $11,000 and a front end that appears to be a direct steal from last year’s Ford Taurus. The Spectra is going head to head with such world-class small cars as the Ford Focus. We tested a loaded Spectra GSX with only four options, including a CD player and cruise control, that priced out at $14,304.\n\nDespite what appears to be an attractive sticker, we both agreed that smart shoppers will leave the Spectra near the bottom of their must-have lists.\n\nHe: My impression a week after driving the Spectra is pretty much the same as it was before I ever set foot in the car. This is not a good-looking vehicle. And it doesn’t have any truly unique features to set it apart from the competition except perhaps for its four-door hatchback body style, which isn’t wildly popular in the U.S. After spending some time in the Spectra, however, I have to give Kia credit for raising the bar on quality. This compact is nicely finished in most respects, with no glaring gaffes or misfits. It’s just not terribly exciting to drive.\n\nShe: I’m really disappointed. I pulled the “Revised Women’s Dictionary” off the Internet to help us write these columns. For example, the dictionary translates the phrase “you have to learn to communicate” to “just agree with me.” And “be romantic; turn out the lights” to “I have flabby thighs.” But I guess when it comes to the Spectra, we don’t need help. We pretty much agree. But I was a little more forgiving than you on the rating because of the quality improvements.\n\nHe: Sounds to me like we’re talking the same language. I was going back over our test-drive worksheet, and noticed some oddities. I thought the trunk looked kind of roomy, and double-checked the factory specifications. Turns out it has 11.6 cubic feet of cargo volume. Guess what? The Focus hatchback has 18.5 cubic feet. OK, so much for first impressions. Actually, the Spectra has pretty decent room inside, especially for rear-seat passengers. One of my biggest complaints as a driver was the lack of visibility. Even taller folks will have a tough time seeing out the rear window.\n\nShe: One of the first things I noticed was that weird pedal noise when you hit the brakes. It’s hard to describe, but it’s a noise I shouldn’t have heard. You step on the brakes of most domestic or Japanese products, and you don’t hear anything. And while I’m on my noise rant, the Spectra had lots of wind, engine and road noise. I’ve heard from some consumers that they just drown out that kind of stuff with the stereo. But here’s a warning: The Spectra stereo had lousy audio quality. These are all pretty big lifestyle concerns.\n\nHe: Forget about lifestyle. Let’s talk about life, period. No side air bags on this baby, even though it just hit the U.S. market earlier this year. Sorry, no excuse.\n\nShe: And antilock brakes cost extra on the Spectra. Our top-of-the-line test vehicle didn’t even have ABS installed as an option. What’s that all about? Not a good way to cut corners in my book.\n\nHe: Let’s cut right to the chase on engine power. There isn’t any. Kia quotes a horsepower figure of 125 for the twin-cam 1.8-liter four-cylinder, but torque is a mere 108 pounds-feet. You can really feel the difference when you’re trying to accelerate. If you’re still inclined to buy the Spectra, one word of caution. Skip the automatic and go for the five-speed manual transmission. It’s probably the best way to use what little juice the engine provides. And don’t expect dazzling mileage. Even with t stick, the Spectra returns only 23 miles per gallon in city driving and 29 mpg on the highway.\n\nShe: Well, the Men’s Dictionary says when you say “I’m hungry,” you mean, “I’m hungry.” When you say the Spectra gets one star, there’s no reading between the lines.\n\n2000 Kia Spectra\n\nAnita’s rating: Acceptable\n\nPaul’s rating: Subpar\n\nLikes: Noticeable improvement in quality from past Kias. Controls are simple, easy to read.\n\nDislikes: Visibility is poor. No side air bags. Antilock brakes cost extra. Engine feels anemic. Doesn’t stand up well next to a Ford Focus hatchback. Front-end styling is a ripoff of Ford Taurus.\n\nType: Front-wheel drive, five-passenger hatchback.\n\nPrice: Base, $12,995; as tested, $14,304 (incl. $450 destination charge).\n\nEngine: 1.8-liter I-4; 125-hp; 108 lb-ft torque.\n\nEPA fuel economy: 23 mpg city/29 mpg highway.\n\n12-month insurance cost, according to AAA Michigan: $1,015 (Estimate. Rates may be higher or lower, depending on coverage and driving record.)\n\nWhere built: South Korea",

      "expert_review": "Kia Spectra answers a question being asked by more and more people, especially younger drivers: What’s out there that is stylish, practical and fun but doesn’t cost a fortune?\n\nFor most, the answer is: a used car. New-car offerings in the sub-$15,000 range are mainly pathetic compromises, basic transportation and little more.\n\nBut for a base price just under $13,000, the Spectra’s upgraded GLX model comes with a full load of features, a great warranty and a sporty appearance that should appeal to even the most style-conscious. The performance is hardly stellar, but it’s no dog, either.\n\nNow in its second year, the Spectra comes in one body design, a four-door hatchback, which is popular in Europe and Asia, but not in the United States. I think a hatchback works better for a subcompact car than a minuscule trunk.\n\nThe youthful appeal is emphasized in the GLX. An unsubtle logo on the rear deck puts the “X” in bigger type and bright yellow. As a bona fide middle-ager, I felt self-conscious driving a bright-red Spectra with a bright-yellow X on its tail.\n\nStill, I could appreciate the level of features and refinement in this little critter, which serves as the Korean automaker’s sporty model.\n\nUnfortunately, the Spectra press car was significantly challenged by its automatic transmission. With a small-displacement four-banger, making just 125 horsepower, and modest torque, the automatic just sapped too much of the power. A manual transmission would be beneficial.\n\nThe Spectra escapes being just another droning econobox by its responsive steering and well-sorted suspension. Kia touts that British manufacturer and chassis-tuner Lotus helped with the design and execution. That doesn’t make Spectra handle like a Lotus Esprit, but it helps.\n\nAs it is, I found the ride to be choppy over nearly all road surfaces with an unpleasant tendency to rumble and vibrate. But what the stiffened suspension costs in ride quality, it pays back in handling. For a pint-size, low-cost passenger car, the Spectra displays solid cornering capabilities. The Lotus influence, I’m sure.\n\nThe test car was equipped with antilock brakes, an $800 option that includes rear discs instead of drums. Brake response is strong and effective, but really, this kind of safety gear should be standard, just like air bags.\n\nThe interior of the GLX is comfortable with supportive seats and decent space front and rear, considering the outside dimensions.\n\nThe base model of the Spectra starts at $10,795, but it’s a Spartan creature, with air-conditioning as a $900 option. The GLX seems a better deal, including an upgraded interior, full power features, body enhancements, alloy wheels and standard AC.\n\nOur test car was fully loaded with options, pushing the price tag dangerously over $16,000. Aside from the $800 brake package, there was the $995 automatic transmission (skip that); upgraded AM/FM/CD s tereo at $295; a $400 package that includes cruise control, stereo tweeters, variable wipers and power mirrors; $250 for remote entry; $95 for a rear-window wiper; $85 for body-color side moldings; and $70 for carpeted floor mats.\n\nKia has been sailing some rough waters recently, such as going broke and being purchased by Hyundai. Like Hyundai, the quality of Kia’s products is improving, though the jury’s still out on the Spectra. But also like Hyundai, the warranty is excellent, including a 10-year, 100,000-mile powertrain warranty and a five-year, unlimited-mileage roadside assistance program.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nFor 2007, Kia has updated front and rear styling — including the grille, bumper, lights and deck lid — on its compact Spectra sedan. Interior changes include a restyled dashboard, new seat fabrics and an upgraded audio system. Thanks to the modified exterior, the Spectra adds about an inch of length over the 2006 model.\n\nKia introduced a redesigned Spectra compact sedan as a late 2004 model. The new Spectra was larger than its predecessor and featured more power and six airbags.\n\nFitted with variable valve timing, the Spectra’s 2.0-liter four-cylinder develops 138 horsepower (132 hp in Super Ultra Low Emissions Vehicle form).\n\nTrim levels include the base LX, uplevel EX and sport-tuned SX. The SX has similar equipment to the Spectra5 hatchback.\n\nThe Spectra5 hatchback received similar styling changes for 2007. It’s listed separately in the Cars.com Research section.\n\nExterior\nOn the Spectra LX and EX, freshened exterior elements include the grille, bumper, lights and deck lid. The Spectra SX features a new face with integrated ground effects, a bright exhaust finish and redesigned wheels. Overall length increases 0.8 inches for the LX and EX sedans, and 1.2 inches for the SX.\n\nKia promotes the Spectra’s sculpted appearance and the more aggressive look it has over many of its rivals. Large, angular headlights flank the grille. Full-length body creases are meant to impart a sense of motion.\n\nSpectras have a four-wheel-independent suspension and front and rear stabilizer bars. EX sedans roll on 15-inch tires.\n\nA sport-tuned suspension with 16-inch wheels is used on the Spectra SX sedan. The installation of a strut tower bar is said to improve handling.\n\nInterior\nInterior updates include new metallic accents and revised seat fabric. The audio system adds an auxiliary jack for iPods or other MP3 players, and a six-CD changer is optional on the Spectra SX.\n\nThe Spectra sedan holds five people on front bucket seats and a 60/40-split, folding rear seat. Trunk space totals 12.2 cubic feet.\n\nAir conditioning, power windows and locks, remote keyless entry and heated power mirrors are included in the EX sedan. Extra features in the SX sedan include a perforated leather-wrapped steering wheel and gearshift knob, aluminum pedals and metal-finish trim.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Spectra’s 138-hp, 2.0-liter four-cylinder teams with a standard five-speed manual or the optional, revised four-speed automatic transmission. In the five SULEV states, Spectras with the old automatic have an environmentally friendly SULEV rating, but that engine is rated at 132 hp.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes are optional. Seat-mounted side-impact airbags and side curtain airbags are standard.\n\nDriving Impressions\nSimilar to earlier import-brand models, the Spectra steers with a pleasantly light touch and maneuvers smartly. This is a generally enjoyable car that exhibits no more body lean than other sedans in its league, but it lacks a feeling of tight control. The tires aren’t likely to squeal when cornering, though the Spectra might “plow” through curves.\n\nOn most surfaces, the ride is satisfyingly smooth. The SX sedan is tauter, with no penalty in ride comfort.\n\nAcceleration reaches past adequate with an automatic transmission, but passing yields a lot more blare than response. Kia’s easy-shifting manual gearbox works with little effort and helps extract the most power from the engine.\n\nThe seat bottoms are short, and cushioning feels adequate but not abundant. You get plenty of headroom, elbowroom and legroom. Scalloped front seatbacks help give backseat riders more knee space than some small cars offer.",

      "expert_review": "I learned to drive in a Jeep, a very old Jeep. My father wanted to be sure that I could drive a difficult stick shift, change a tire, change the oil, and engage a manual 4-wheel drive system. Sounds pretty girly, huh? I am really glad that I posses those skills, but the only one I use with any frequency is being able to drive a car with manual transmission.\n\nFor me, however, having an automatic transmission is a must in a mom-mobile. As much as I believe in limited distractions while driving, I often have a coffee cup in the cup holder and a cell phone at the ready in the console. With a manual transmission, I feel like I need another pair of hands just to take a sip or answer a phone call (with my headset attached, of course). It seems that each time my phone rings or the children need me, I am also in the midst of shifting. Holy distracted driver, Batman!\n\nEnough about my dislike for the stick shift; I am really unimpressed about some other aspects of the 2006 Kia Spectra as well. First of all, I cannot get the seat high enough. It has a manual pump-action seat hoist that seems to get me just a couple inches off the road – literally. I live in the land of giant SUVs, so feeling exceptionally low to the ground is intimidating and somewhat unnerving.\n\nSome other amenities that I really miss in the Kia Spectra are: A lighted mirror on the sun shade and an outside temperature gauge. Most disappointing of all is the size of the center console. I can fit my iPod in this space, but not much more.\n\nWhat the Spectra lacks in creature comforts it makes up for in simplicity and safety features. It is refreshing to drive this car for a week and not have to pull out the manual. The heat controls are user-friendly and the stereo is a breeze to figure out. I also appreciate the standard side curtain airbags.\n\nI am able to squeeze my family of five into the Spectra, although I would not recommend this to anyone who values their sanity. Between my husband ceaselessly adjusting his seat to get comfortable and three children fighting in the back seat, I thought I would never make it to the movie theatre, less than 5 miles from our house. The middle passenger seat in the rear is not really big enough for any person who is old enough to be out of a booster seat.\n\nThe cargo area is about what I expect in a car this size, a small weekly grocery trip is about it for capacity. It doesn’t pass the Costco test for me and I have to put some of my purchases in the front seat. The rear seats fold down with a 60/40 split which is helpful, but I am not able to fit my skis in without hitting the gearshift. So much for testing the car’s get-up-and-go in the mountains.\n\nI consider the 2006 Kia Spectra a very basic and inexpensive commuter car. Its 25 mpg in the city barely puts it in that category for me. As a mom and generally cool chick (if I do say so myself), that is about as much praise as I can muster for this car.\n\nLET’S TALK NUMBERS LATCH Connectors: 2 Seating Capacity (includes driver): 5 (barely)\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT Storage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Puny Cargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\nSENSE AND STYLE Family Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair Fun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): None\n\n*For more information on the Kia Spectra and its safety features visit Cars.com",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe Spectra hasn’t changed much for 2009; Kia restyled the exterior and interior for 2007. Trim levels include the base LX, the uplevel EX and a sport-tuned SX. The SX is similar to the Spectra5 hatchback, which is listed separately in the Cars.com Research section. The Spectra competes with small sporty cars like the Ford Focus, Honda Civic and Mazda3.\n\nNew for 2009\nThe Spectra adds active head restraints that tilt forward in the event of a rear collision to reduce the odds of a neck injury.\n\nExterior\nKia promotes the Spectra’s sculpted appearance and the more aggressive look it has over many of its rivals. Large, angular headlights flank the grille. It measures 177.2 inches long and is 68.3 inches wide — about the same as the Honda Civic and Mazda3 sedan and about 2 inches longer and wider than the Focus sedan.\n\n15- or 16-inch wheels\nStandard automatic headlamps\nStandard body-colored mirrors, handles and moldings\nFog lamps standard on SX\nPower, heated mirrors standard on EX and SX\nOptional moonroof on EX and SX\n\nInterior\nThe Spectra sedan holds five people on front bucket seats and a 60/40-split folding rear seat. There’s 97 cubic feet of passenger volume, making the Spectra the most spacious of the group. Trunk space totals 12.2 cubic feet, which is smaller than the Focus sedan, about the same size as the Civic and slightly larger than the Mazda3.\n\nCloth interior, with unique cloth interior for SX\nOptional air conditioning (standard on EX and SX)\nCruise control standard on SX and EX models\nPower windows, locks and keyless entry standard on EX and SX\nLeather-wrapped steering wheel standard on SX\n\nUnder the Hood\nOnly one power plant is available for the Kia Spectra:\n\n138-horsepower, 2.0-liter inline-four-cylinder engine with 136 pounds-feet of torque\nFive-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission\nSport-tuned suspension standard on SX\n\nSafety\nSafety features include:\n\nStandard front seat-mounted side-impact airbags\nStandard side curtain airbags\nStandard active head restraints\nOptional antilock braking system only on SX",

      "expert_review": "Kia has come an awfully long way in a short period, moving from a brand that was pretty much nobody’s first choice — you bought a Kia if you couldn’t afford, or get a loan for, a Honda or a Toyota — to a brand that is a genuine no-excuses alternative.\n\nLike most of Kia’s lineup, there’s nothing spectacular about the Spectra, but there’s nothing wanting, either. Handsome, if not particularly distinctive, the SX test car was dressed up with handsome alloy wheels, shod with wider-than-usual P205/50R-16 radials, rear spoiler and side body cladding.\n\nBased on the same platform as the last-generation Hyundai Elantra, the Spectra is a right-sized car that’s comfortable for four, passable for five, with a decent-sized, 12.2-cubic-foot trunk. Overall length is 177.2 inches, a little longer than a Honda Civic, a little shorter than a Toyota Corolla.\n\nOne of the ways Kia gained a foothold in the market is in offering more equipment than the competition for less money, and that continues with the Spectra: The $15,995 base price gets you air conditioning, power heated outside mirrors, fog lights, a six-speaker stereo with CD player, cruise control, power locks and windows, remote locking and a tilt steering wheel. Safety equipment includes side and side-curtain airbags and power disc brakes. Antilock brakes are a $400 option. The test car also had a power sunroof ($700), and an upgraded six-disc changer ($300). With options and $600 in shipping, the total price was $17,995. Add an automatic transmission, and the price would have been another $1,000.\n\nInside, the Spectra still shows a hint or two of its economy-car origins; front seats seem a little downmarket, and there’s a lot of plastic, though the leather-covered steering wheel is a nice touch. Instruments and controls are well-placed and logical.\n\nOn the road, the Spectra rides as well as any car in this class. Handling isn’t up to the level of the Civic, but it’s close. The 2.0-liter engine is well-matched to the five-speed manual transmission, and fuel mileage — 23 mpg city, 30 mpg on the highway, on regular gas — isn’t bad, but the four-speed automatic transmission is actually rated a bit higher, at 24 mpg city, 32 mpg highway. Bottom line: The Spectra, with clean styling, good performance and one of the best warranties in the industry, is a solid entry in a very competitive class.\n\nSentinel Automotive Editor Steven Cole Smithcan be reached at scsmith@orlandosentinel.com.",

      "expert_review": "Perhaps there’s something gratifying about finding a diamond in the rough, or a little uncharted territory when everyone seems to be walking in the same direction.\n\nCase in point: The 2005 Kia Spectra.\n\nKia? Am I kidding ya?\n\nNot at all. No apologies here, but Kia is really something to consider.\n\nPriced at less than $14,000 in base versions, and available with a slew of standard features and interesting options, Kia is a good value and a good car. Those two statements have not always been synonymous.\n\nKia has been the punch line of several new car jokes over the years, mostly because it was value-priced without the value.\n\nNo more.\n\nWith the involvement of parent company Hyundai (and Hyundai’s subsequent rise up the quality charts), the Koreans are onto something good here. Many think the Koreans will be a player to watch in the future. Hyundai-Kia have even targeted the end of the decade to be the world’s fifth-largest car company.\n\nNot flashy, not rakish, but definitely drivable, the Spectra is a very viable option for anyone who has never considered this car company before. The Spectra, a four-door sedan that is also available as a hatchback, is an understated vehicle that can be dressed up with a spoiler, metal pedals and fog lights.\n\nIt is not large, but it’s sporty. It is not luxurious, but it is reliable. And, mostly, it will leave money in your wallet.\n\nPowered by a 2-liter DOHC four-cylinder engine, it produces a sprightly 138 horsepower and plenty of torque for this class of vehicle. It accelerates cleanly at low and high speeds and seems to find its best range in city driving when you can zip in and out of a lane change or merge onto a highway.\n\nAt 24 miles per gallon in the city, or 32 on the highway, can you really complain?\n\nUnderneath the Spectra, Kia has installed a suspension to match the power. Kia spent a lot of time tightening things up and buttoning things down on the Spectra. Larger stabilizer bars and 16-inch wheels help structural rigidity and better performance in the turns. The turning radius is very tight, and its compact size makes it a delight to drive in mall traffic.\n\nInside was the biggest difference. Criticized in the past for using cheap, plastic materials, Kia has swapped out the old style for nice textures on the instrument panel and throughout the cabin.\n\nAn added bonus is that Kia did not skimp on standard equipment. You get more standard stuff on the Spectra than virtually any car on the market for its price.\n\nThe Spectra comes with air conditioning, AM/FM/CD audio system with six speakers, power windows, power door locks with remote keyless entry, power heated outside mirrors and a height-adjustable steering column. Four-wheel anti-lock brakes are $400 and an option I would suggest you add.\n\nBut tilt steering and heated mirrors? This isn’t the bare bones vehicle I remember. On safety, the Kia soars. As a first for Kia, there are six standard air bags, including a full-length side-curtain air bag. In other words, world-class safety without the price.\n\nAnd, with a 10-year/100,000-mile warranty (done to encourage new Kia shoppers to consider one), where can you go wrong?\n\nConsider it.\n\nEven if your neighbors never would.\n\n– – –\n\n2005 Kia Spectra\n\nVehicle type: Front-wheel-drive, front-engine, four-door, five-passenger compact sedan\n\nKey competition: Chevrolet Cobalt, Ford Focus, Honda Civic\n\nBase engine: 138 horsepower, 2-liter DOHC, 16-valve four-cylinder engine\n\nTransmission: Five-speed manual or four-speed automatic (optional)\n\nStandard safety equipment: Dual front, side and inflatable curtain air bags\n\nMPG rating: 24 city/32 highway\n\nManufactured: Korea\n\nWarranty: Basic warranty is 10 years/100,000 miles.\n\nBase price: $13,390\n\nPrice as tested (including destination and delivery): $17,140\n\n– – –\n\nJason Stein’s column appears Sundays in Business.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nIntroduced for 2001, Kias sporty four-door hatchback offshoot of the front-drive subcompact Sephia sedan earns a restyled body and interior for 2002. These changes also pertain to the Sephia, which alters its name for the 2002 model year to the Spectra sedan. The Sephia is Kias oldest model, which first began to trickle into the U.S. market in 1994.\n\nAutomatic on/off headlights are new, and the drivers seat gains lumbar support. Aluminum engine mounts and other engineering changes aim toward decreasing noise, vibration and harshness. Folding rear seatbacks help give the Spectra hatchback more cargo-carrying versatility than the sedan, which has a conventional trunk. Both body styles use the same 125-horsepower, 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine.\n\nBased in South Korea, Kia is now owned by Hyundai but maintains its own dealer network. Kia has been expanding its presence in the U.S. market with fresh products. The automaker introduced a brand-new midsize Optima sedan for the 2001 model year, following the debut of its mini-sized Rio sedan and the Sephia-derived Spectra hatchback. The newest vehicle in its lineup is the 2002 Sedona minivan, which was launched in summer 2001. Kia sold 98,256 vehicles in the United States during 2000, up from 82,211 units in the previous year, according to Automotive News.\n\nSimilar to Hyundais coverage, Kia offers a long-term warranty that covers the entire vehicle for five years/60,000 miles, major powertrain components for 10 years/100,000 miles and corrosion for five years/100,000 miles. Free roadside assistance is included for the first five years.\n\nExterior\nThe Spectra sedan is conservatively styled and comes in base and LS trims. Compared to most of its competitors, the Spectra sedan is more reminiscent of import sedans of the past. The four-door sedan rides a 100.8-inch wheelbase and measures 174.4 inches long overall  about the same as the Honda Civic. It stretches 66.9 inches wide and stands 55.5 inches tall.\n\nIn addition to having a lift-up hatch instead of a regular trunk, the Spectra hatchback has displayed different front-end styling than the sedan; but the 2002 models more closely resemble each other. Wheelbases are identical, but the hatchback is 2 inches longer overall at 176.2 inches, which is slightly longer than the Ford Focus sedan. Spectra hatchbacks come in GS and the more expensive GSX trim levels; the latter features alloy wheels and front/rear spoilers, for a sportier look.\n\nInterior\nBoth the hatchback and sedan hold five passengers and are equipped with front bucket seats. The hatchback has a folding backseat that expands cargo volume beyond the minimum 11.6 cubic feet. A larger rear opening on the Spectra hatchback makes it easier to load and unload cargo.\n\nAs for the sedan, the LS offers several features that are not available on the base model, including all-cloth seats (instead of the base models cloth and vinyl), a tilt steering column, a 60/40-split rear seatback that folds for extra cargo room and a tilt feature for the drivers seat. An optional Power Package for the LS adds air conditioning, cruise control, a tachometer, and power windows, locks and mirrors. Trunk space amounts to 10.4 cubic feet.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine develops 125 hp and teams with a standard five-speed manual or an optional four-speed-automatic transmission. Antilock brakes are optional, and side-impact airbags are not available.\n\nDriving Impressions\nThe Spectra sedan ranks as adequate but not up to the level of its most likely competitors in performance, handling and ride comfort. Driving qualities, in fact, are almost reminiscent of an earlier era. Value is what sells these sedans, even though their reputation for durability cannot match that of comparable Honda or Toyota models.\n\nEven with the manual shift, performance is not a strong suit for the Spectra. Considerable downshifting is necessary to keep the hatchback rolling along  and this is required even more if you happen to be headed uphill for a time. Although the Getrag-designed gearshift is a bit vague and rubbery, it functions with sufficient ease. Acceleration with the automatic transmission sets no records, and the unit sometimes downshifts with a jolt. On the whole, it responds as well as the automatics in most competitors. Engine noise is noticeable during acceleration, but it eases at highway speeds.\n\nWhat places the Spectra ahead of some of the competition is its smooth ride. Although the Spectra stays acceptably on course on straight highways and through modest curves, it sometimes threatens to become a little unhinged in quick maneuvers. Stabilizer bars at both ends help to keep the hatchback stable.\n\nThe front seats are comfortable and well-cushioned. As in most small cars, fitting three people  especially adults  in the backseat can get mighty snug. Headroom is adequate on both sides, and rear legroom is above average for the compact league. Radio controls are a lot better than in past Kias, and gauges are nicely laid-out and easy to read. A glove box thats bigger than most comes as a surprise.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2002 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "A respectable automotive appliance\nKia Spectra is solid, quiet, inexpensive, but AC is optional.\n\nWhen it comes to nameplates that elicit burning passion and desire, Kia is certainly not among them. Burning passion? Maybe at Kia’s corporate offices.\n\nOf course, Kia knows where it stands in the automotive food chain and, in a bid for some credibility, sponsored the music group, Sugar Ray, on their spring tour. That would make you want to buy a Kia?\n\nOkay, maybe not.\n\nWell, how about this? Thanks to parent company Hyundai, the new Kia Spectra is a respectable automotive appliance.\n\nFeeling the passion? Only if you really go for narrow panel gaps or the sound a car door makes when it shuts. It’s akin to getting passionate about a dryer that doesn’t leave lint on your clothes.\n\nBut the new Spectra is really quite respectable, in a ”buy it cheap and use it ’til the doors fall off” kind of way.\n\nThe Spectra uses the Elantra platform as a starting point. It has a surprisingly solid feel compared to Kias of old. Its plastic parts feel pretty darn nice, considering the car’s $13,160 starting price. There are two body styles, a sedan available in LX and EX trim levels, and a five-door hatchback called the Spectra5. Kia provided a base LX sedan for testing.\n\nAs nice as those plastics might be, there are still some flimsy pieces, such as the window cranks. And let’s not even talk about the seats, which are just plain awful. Flat, hard, pain-inducing and lacking in any support, they proved to be the worst part of the car.\n\nThe best part of the car? The incredibly quiet cabin, which approaches Lexus levels for tomb-like silence. This is very surprising in such an inexpensive car.\n\nPower is courtesy of a 2-liter DOHC four-cylinder engine that produces 138 horsepower mated to your choice of a five-speed manual or four-speed automatic. You might want to consider the manual, as it would be best to extract the engine’s power. The automatic seemed to have rubbery shifts, holding each gear too long. The motor makes a ruckus when revved.\n\nThe ride is small-car firm, assisted by lots of body lean, although it’s better than previous Kias. The car also tracks down the highway straight, without the need for a lot of minor corrections, a problem on previous Kia small cars. There’s even road feel — despite the fact that the car uses a fully independent suspension and four-wheel disc brakes. Anti-lock brakes are optional on all models except the base LX. You’ll never mistake this for a Ford Focus or VW Jetta, but it is miles beyond what this nameplate produced previously.\n\nFeeling the passion yet? Maybe you are. After all, the Koreans are known for producing a decent car on the cheap.\n\nGuess again. This car’s air-conditioning was an option, even though the AM/FM/CD player was not. Cruise control, power windows, power locks, power mirrors and floor mats are all options. A tilt steering wheel, cupholders, and side air-bags are not.\n\nLacking power windows, locks, mirrors, moonroof and a CD changer, this car still had a sticker price of just over $15,000.\n\nThat’s not a lot compared to some cars, but it’s not a whole lot less than a lot of other cars, making this car’s ”made in Korea” badge seem less a help than a hindrance.\n\nAnd I’m sure the guys in Sugar Ray don’t drive Kias.\n\nStill, the new Spectra is a decent appliance, and it won’t leave lint on your clothes.",
