      "expert_review": "Look, Cadenza is a stupid name. But then again, it’s memorable, and so is the new 2014 Kia Cadenza sedan itself, especially if you compare it with the Kia Amanti sold between 2004 and 2009. (I almost forgot about that one myself.)\n\nOn its own merits, the 2014 Kia Cadenza is a classy premium sedan, but its status as a Kia rather than a more esteemed brand might make its premium price harder for shoppers to swallow.\n\nKia has been building some great vehicles over the past several years, including the midsize Optima sedan, which was Cars.com’s car of the year for the 2011 model year. The Cadenza is a full-size sedan. Riding the line between more modest, high-volume cars and full luxury brands, the Cadenza competes with pricier versions of the Buick LaCrosse, Chrysler 300 and Toyota Avalon (see the cars compared side-by-side here). The Cadenza’s higher trim levels nip at the heels of the Volvo S80, the Swedish company’s flagship sedan, though one that’s closer to midsize. If midsize is OK with you, the Lexus ES sedan is a very tough competitor for its quality and starting price of $37,280 (all prices cited include destination charges). The Cadenza starts at $35,900. (See these models compared here.)\n\nNaturally, the Cadenza can’t help but compete with its sister model, the Hyundai Azera (Hyundai owns Kia), with which it shares a platform and most of its hardware. The Hyundai costs $2,755 less.\n\nFor a photo gallery, click here. For a video review, click here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nWhen viewed from the outside, the Cadenza is a handsome and fairly expensive-looking car. For years, Kias have mimicked Audis. Some of that influence remains in the rear, but the front end now evokes a BMW. (If you’re going to copy other brands, German luxury cars aren’t a bad way to go.) However, I’m disheartened to see the white stripes over the headlight clusters, which I hated on BMWs. It looks like a protective film that should have been peeled off after shipping. On the positive side, when the car’s running, these stripes illuminate and serve as daytime running lights.\n\nThe Cadenza measures about 5 inches longer, a half-inch wider and almost an inch taller than the Optima. It’s also a couple of inches longer than the Azera.\n\nIn the Cabin\nThe Cadenza may not be an enormous, rear-wheel-drive sedan, but it’s appropriately larger than the Optima where it counts the most, namely the interior volume. It has 107 cubic feet of interior volume versus 102 in the Optima, 106 in the Chrysler 300 and 102 cubic feet in the LaCrosse.\n\nThe Cadenza’s seating dimensions are all equal to or greater than the Optima’s. The biggest difference is in backseat legroom, where the Cadenza has 36.8 inches, which is 2.1 inches more than the Optima. This is an instance where legroom measurements don’t accurately reflect reality. While the LaCrosse measures 40.5 inches and the 300 is 40.1 inches, the Cadenza’s backseat still feels roomy and open. The center floor hump is very low — about ankle-high — which makes the floor space more usable. The 300’s hump is among the highest, at about a foot tall.\n\nThe roominess really pays off in accommodating child-safety seats. See the details in our Car Seat Check.\n\nThe front occupants enjoy ample room as well, particularly legroom. Nice leather upholstery is standard, and our test car had optional white Nappa leather that felt richer still. Interior quality is always difficult to summarize, because different people value different characteristics. Most of our editors found the materials quality to be appropriate, but one thought the upper doors and some surfaces lower than that seemed cheap. I know this is esoteric, but there’s something about the bright white labels on the buttons that — though legible — makes them look unsophisticated to me.\n\nSome of the features that imparted quality in our test car were options: Along with the Nappa leather in the Luxury Package were a suede ceiling liner and a 7-inch color display between the gauges that presented an analog-style speedometer with additional selectable information screens at its center.\n\nOn the Road\nGauging quality is something you also do when in motion. The Cadenza does a decent job of blocking exterior noise, though one of our editors characterized the engine noise as coarse under heavier acceleration. We agreed the ride quality is decent — better than the Optima’s — but it’s certainly not class-leading. Compared with the Chrysler 300, especially, it feels a bit choppy on rough surfaces and firm for a car that otherwise feels like a tourer, not a sport sedan. Without our car’s 19-inch wheels (included with the optional Technology Package), the Cadenza might ride a little bit softer. Eighteen-inch rims are standard.\n\nEquipped with a 293-horsepower, 3.3-liter V-6 engine, the Cadenza feels pretty sprightly, though the six-speed automatic transmission occasionally hesitates when you nail the gas once you’re already in motion. The steering is another attribute that does the job but doesn’t scream performance. The exterior styling might say BMW, but the driving experience says “chill.”\n\nAlong with a powerful V-6 comes mileage of 19/28/22 mpg city/highway/combined. Among competitors, it’s about average. Comparing combined mileage, the LaCrosse is rated an estimated 21 mpg, the Chrysler 300 is 18 mpg and the Avalon is 25 mpg. The Azera beats the Cadenza by 1 mpg.\n\nControls & Operability\nSomething about building premium or luxury cars inspires automakers to include elaborate interfaces — multifunction rotary knobs/joysticks/buttons or mouselike controllers that don’t necessarily provide clarity or functionality, much less luxury. Despite its effort to break into a higher-rent market, Kia thankfully has not fallen into this trap. The Cadenza is blissfully simple to operate. A thoughtfully selected and arranged set of real buttons provide direct control over the ventilation system. A similarly simple band of buttons below — flanked by two real rotary knobs — lets you access audio sources, music tracks, a Bluetooth-paired phone and the standard navigation system. All these features are displayed on a similarly clearly laid-out 8-inch touch-screen.\n\nWhy do other automakers find such simplicity so difficult?\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe Cadenza’s cabin has well-sized storage compartments and cupholders, and the trunk is a respectable 15.9 cubic feet. For comparison, the LaCrosse has 10.9 cubic feet (because of the battery for its standard light-hybrid system), the 300 has 16.3 cubic feet and the Avalon has 16.0 cubic feet.\n\nTo my disappointment, the Cadenza follows in the style of the Avalon, ES 350 and many full-size luxury cars by excluding a folding backseat. The 300, LaCrosse, S80 and most affordable full-size sedans do include split, folding rear seats to extend trunk space forward.\n\nSafety\nIn Insurance Institute for Highway Safety testing, the 2014 Cadenza scored very well, with top ratings of Good for frontal, side and rear crash tests and roof-strength tests. Seven of eight competing models subjected to these tests performed the same. (The 2013 Chevrolet Impala, which had two Acceptable scores, has been replaced by a redesigned 2014 that hasn’t been fully tested as of publication.) None of the vehicles in the organization’s Large Family Cars class has undergone the stringent new small-overlap crash test.\n\nIn addition to the required antilock brakes and electronic stability system, the Cadenza has eight standard airbags, including seat-mounted side-impact torso bags and side curtains for all outboard occupants, front and rear. A backup camera is also standard.\n\nTwo active-safety features, blind spot warning and lane departure warning, are optional in the $3,000 Technology Package. I’m always disappointed to see safety features bundled in high-priced packages with unrelated items. In this case, the package also includes 19-inch wheels, an electronic parking brake, adaptive cruise control and hydrophobic front door windows — the latter a water- and dirt-resistant coating that one could argue has safety advantages. A more affordable safety package would be preferable.\n\nSee all the safety features listed here.\n\nCadenza in the Market\nThe Cadenza has a decent set of standard features, not the least of which is free scheduled maintenance for the first three years or 37,500 miles — and that’s on top of the above-average five years or 60,000 miles of bumper-to-bumper and roadside-assistance coverage, plus the exceptionally generous 12-year or 100,000-mile drivetrain protection.\n\nBut a lot of the items found on the Cadenza that set premium vehicles apart are optional: In addition to the Nappa leather and instrument-panel display mentioned above, the Luxury Package on our car included a powered bottom-cushion extension and ventilation for the standard heated driver’s seat (no ventilation for the passenger), a heated and power-adjustable steering wheel with driver’s seat memory, a power rear-window sun shade and a panoramic moonroof. Our car hit $41,900 as equipped. Checking all the boxes brings it to $42,160.\n\nBut the Cadenza meets its main challenge where the Hyundai Azera, Genesis Sedan and Equus have: providing the additional allure for which luxury-car buyers pay a premium. For example, apart from its smaller size, the Lexus ES 350 is surprisingly close to the Cadenza in its standard-features list, though glaring differences include the Lexus’ standard vinyl upholstery and shorter warranties (except corrosion/perforation). What it has, however, is the Lexus name.\n\nThe Cadenza’s features and quality are comparable to — and in some cases are more generous than — competitors, but true luxury vehicles command money for a perception of value associated with the brand. Such perceptions of value are unquantifiable and perplexingly unpredictable from one shopper to the next. As long as the Cadenza and its Hyundai counterparts are sold under the same brand name as the companies’ modest models, they’ll struggle to imply any value beyond what they offer in features and quality.\n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in August 2013 about the 2014 Kia Cadenza. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2015, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nLook, Cadenza is a stupid name. But then again, it’s memorable, and so is the new 2014 Kia Cadenza sedan itself, especially if you compare it with the Kia Amanti sold between 2004 and 2009. (I almost forgot about that one myself.)\n\nOn its own merits, the 2014 Kia Cadenza is a classy premium sedan, but its status as a Kia rather than a more esteemed brand might make its premium price harder for shoppers to swallow.\n\nKia has been building some great vehicles over the past several years, including the midsize Optima sedan, which was Cars.com’s car of the year for the 2011 model year. The Cadenza is a full-size sedan. Riding the line between more modest, high-volume cars and full luxury brands, the Cadenza competes with pricier versions of the Buick LaCrosse, Chrysler 300 and Toyota Avalon (see the cars compared side-by-side here). The Cadenza’s higher trim levels nip at the heels of the Volvo S80, the Swedish company’s flagship sedan, though one that’s closer to midsize. If midsize is OK with you, the Lexus ES sedan is a very tough competitor for its quality and starting price of $37,280 (all prices cited include destination charges). The Cadenza starts at $35,900. (See these models compared here.)\n\nNaturally, the Cadenza can’t help but compete with its sister model, the Hyundai Azera (Hyundai owns Kia), with which it shares a platform and most of its hardware. The Hyundai costs $2,755 less.\n\nFor a video review, click here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nWhen viewed from the outside, the Cadenza is a handsome and fairly expensive-looking car. For years, Kias have mimicked Audis. Some of that influence remains in the rear, but the front end now evokes a BMW. (If you’re going to copy other brands, German luxury cars aren’t a bad way to go.) However, I’m disheartened to see the white stripes over the headlight clusters, which I hated on BMWs. It looks like a protective film that should have been peeled off after shipping. On the positive side, when the car’s running, these stripes illuminate and serve as daytime running lights.\n\nThe Cadenza measures about 5 inches longer, a half-inch wider and almost an inch taller than the Optima. It’s also a couple of inches longer than the Azera.\n\nIn the Cabin\nThe Cadenza may not be an enormous, rear-wheel-drive sedan, but it’s appropriately larger than the Optima where it counts the most, namely the interior volume. It has 107 cubic feet of interior volume versus 102 in the Optima, 106 in the Chrysler 300 and 102 cubic feet in the LaCrosse.\n\nThe Cadenza’s seating dimensions are all equal to or greater than the Optima’s. The biggest difference is in backseat legroom, where the Cadenza has 36.8 inches, which is 2.1 inches more than the Optima. This is an instance where legroom measurements don’t accurately reflect reality. While the LaCrosse measures 40.5 inches and the 300 is 40.1 inches, the Cadenza’s backseat still feels roomy and open. The center floor hump is very low — about ankle-high — which makes the floor space more usable. The 300’s hump is among the highest, at about a foot tall.\n\nThe roominess really pays off in accommodating child-safety seats. See the details in our Car Seat Check.\n\nThe front occupants enjoy ample room as well, particularly legroom. Nice leather upholstery is standard, and our test car had optional white Nappa leather that felt richer still. Interior quality is always difficult to summarize, because different people value different characteristics. Most of our editors found the materials quality to be appropriate, but one thought the upper doors and some surfaces lower than that seemed cheap. I know this is esoteric, but there’s something about the bright white labels on the buttons that — though legible — makes them look unsophisticated to me.\n\nSome of the features that imparted quality in our test car were options: Along with the Nappa leather in the Luxury Package were a suede ceiling liner and a 7-inch color display between the gauges that presented an analog-style speedometer with additional selectable information screens at its center.\n\nOn the Road\nGauging quality is something you also do when in motion. The Cadenza does a decent job of blocking exterior noise, though one of our editors characterized the engine noise as coarse under heavier acceleration. We agreed the ride quality is decent — better than the Optima’s — but it’s certainly not class-leading. Compared with the Chrysler 300, especially, it feels a bit choppy on rough surfaces and firm for a car that otherwise feels like a tourer, not a sport sedan. Without our car’s 19-inch wheels (included with the optional Technology Package), the Cadenza might ride a little bit softer. Eighteen-inch rims are standard.\n\nEquipped with a 293-horsepower, 3.3-liter V-6 engine, the Cadenza feels pretty sprightly, though the six-speed automatic transmission occasionally hesitates when you nail the gas once you’re already in motion. The steering is another attribute that does the job but doesn’t scream performance. The exterior styling might say BMW, but the driving experience says “chill.”\n\nAlong with a powerful V-6 comes mileage of 19/28/22 mpg city/highway/combined. Among competitors, it’s about average. Comparing combined mileage, the LaCrosse is rated an estimated 21 mpg, the Chrysler 300 is 18 mpg and the Avalon is 25 mpg. The Azera beats the Cadenza by 1 mpg.\n\nControls & Operability\nSomething about building premium or luxury cars inspires automakers to include elaborate interfaces — multifunction rotary knobs/joysticks/buttons or mouselike controllers that don’t necessarily provide clarity or functionality, much less luxury. Despite its effort to break into a higher-rent market, Kia thankfully has not fallen into this trap. The Cadenza is blissfully simple to operate. A thoughtfully selected and arranged set of real buttons provide direct control over the ventilation system. A similarly simple band of buttons below — flanked by two real rotary knobs — lets you access audio sources, music tracks, a Bluetooth-paired phone and the standard navigation system. All these features are displayed on a similarly clearly laid-out 8-inch touch-screen.\n\nWhy do other automakers find such simplicity so difficult?\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe Cadenza’s cabin has well-sized storage compartments and cupholders, and the trunk is a respectable 15.9 cubic feet. For comparison, the LaCrosse has 10.9 cubic feet (because of the battery for its standard light-hybrid system), the 300 has 16.3 cubic feet and the Avalon has 16.0 cubic feet.\n\nTo my disappointment, the Cadenza follows in the style of the Avalon, ES 350 and many full-size luxury cars by excluding a folding backseat. The 300, LaCrosse, S80 and most affordable full-size sedans do include split, folding rear seats to extend trunk space forward.\n\nSafety\nIn Insurance Institute for Highway Safety testing, the 2014 Cadenza scored very well, with top ratings of Good for frontal, side and rear crash tests and roof-strength tests. Seven of eight competing models subjected to these tests performed the same. (The 2013 Chevrolet Impala, which had two Acceptable scores, has been replaced by a redesigned 2014 that hasn’t been fully tested as of publication.) None of the vehicles in the organization’s Large Family Cars class has undergone the stringent new small-overlap crash test.\n\nIn addition to the required antilock brakes and electronic stability system, the Cadenza has eight standard airbags, including seat-mounted side-impact torso bags and side curtains for all outboard occupants, front and rear. A backup camera is also standard.\n\nTwo active-safety features, blind spot warning and lane departure warning, are optional in the $3,000 Technology Package. I’m always disappointed to see safety features bundled in high-priced packages with unrelated items. In this case, the package also includes 19-inch wheels, an electronic parking brake, adaptive cruise control and hydrophobic front door windows — the latter a water- and dirt-resistant coating that one could argue has safety advantages. A more affordable safety package would be preferable.\n\nSee all the safety features listed here.\n\nCadenza in the Market\nThe Cadenza has a decent set of standard features, not the least of which is free scheduled maintenance for the first three years or 37,500 miles — and that’s on top of the above-average five years or 60,000 miles of bumper-to-bumper and roadside-assistance coverage, plus the exceptionally generous 12-year or 100,000-mile drivetrain protection.\n\nBut a lot of the items found on the Cadenza that set premium vehicles apart are optional: In addition to the Nappa leather and instrument-panel display mentioned above, the Luxury Package on our car included a powered bottom-cushion extension and ventilation for the standard heated driver’s seat (no ventilation for the passenger), a heated and power-adjustable steering wheel with driver’s seat memory, a power rear-window sun shade and a panoramic moonroof. Our car hit $41,900 as equipped. Checking all the boxes brings it to $42,160.\n\nBut the Cadenza meets its main challenge where the Hyundai Azera, Genesis Sedan and Equus have: providing the additional allure for which luxury-car buyers pay a premium. For example, apart from its smaller size, the Lexus ES 350 is surprisingly close to the Cadenza in its standard-features list, though glaring differences include the Lexus’ standard vinyl upholstery and shorter warranties (except corrosion/perforation). What it has, however, is the Lexus name.\n\nThe Cadenza’s features and quality are comparable to — and in some cases are more generous than — competitors, but true luxury vehicles command money for a perception of value associated with the brand. Such perceptions of value are unquantifiable and perplexingly unpredictable from one shopper to the next. As long as the Cadenza and its Hyundai counterparts are sold under the same brand name as the companies’ modest models, they’ll struggle to imply any value beyond what they offer in features and quality.\n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "Competes with: Chrysler 300, Lexus ES, any other non-luxury full-size sedans that are still alive\n\nLooks like: The 2019 Kia Cadenza with a slightly more aggressive face (Be honest: Without that picture above, you would have no idea what a Cadenza looked like, would you?)\n\nPowertrain: 290-horsepower, 3.3-liter V-6; eight-speed automatic transmission\n\nHits dealerships: Later in 2020, according to Kia\n\nKia’s bringing a refreshed 2020 Cadenza to the 2020 Chicago Auto Show, our first chance to see the car stateside since its 2019 Seoul Motor Show debut as the Korean-market K7 Premier. The Cadenza gets subtle updates and upgrades for 2020 as Kia shows a commitment to the full-size sedan market even as other automakers abandon it in favor of more and more SUVs.\n\nRelated: More Chicago Auto Show Coverage\n\nKia has eliminated the Premium trim for the 2020 model year, leaving buyers to choose between either the Technology or Limited versions. The powertrain carries over from the previous model year, and Kia’s collection of safety equipment, called Drive Wise, includes new standard features. Kia also made updates to the body structure and suspension to create a quieter, more cushioned ride.\n\nExterior\n\nThe exterior updates are fairly subtle. The Cadenza’s grille is larger, deeper and a bit more aggressive-looking, using what Kia calls a “vertical waterfall.” Standard LED headlights get a new look, as do the daytime running lights. The lower portion of the Cadenza’s face is also new and includes the turn signals. In back, the trunk lid and rear bumper are updated, as are the LED taillights connected by a horizontal lighting element. The standard 18-inch and optional 19-inch wheels get fresh designs for 2020, too.\n\nInterior\n\nMore significant changes happen inside, including a new horizontal 12.3-inch touchscreen and a redone center stack that puts the audio controls above the climate controls. Three more USB ports (one in front and two in the backseat) have been added, as has high-speed wireless phone charging. Nappa leather seating is available in two new colors (Saddle Brown and Gray), and Limited models get both LED ambient lighting and quilted seat bolsters.\n\nUnder the Hood\n\nNo changes happen directly under the hood, with the same 3.3-liter V-6 from the 2019 model powering the front wheels and paired to an eight-speed automatic transmission. Structural changes aim to improve ride quality and reduce road noise, as do new shock valves and rear dampers. The optional 19-inch wheels are “resonator” wheels, and also work to reduce noise.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2020 Kia Cadenza Redesign to Bow at Chicago Auto Show\nRedesigned 2021 Kia Sorento Set for Geneva Debut\n2021 Kia Seltos Price Includes All-Wheel Drive All Around (Almost)\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2020 Kia Optima?\n2020 Best of the Year Nominees\nSafety\n\nKia calls its collection of safety features Drive Wise, and for the 2020 Kia Cadenza, newly standard features include forward collision warning and avoidance with pedestrian detection, adaptive cruise control with intelligent speed-limit recognition and the ability to slow down before a curve, high-beam assist, lane keep assist with lane-centering steering, blind spot collision avoidance and a safe-exit alert that warns the driver and passengers of oncoming traffic when opening a door.\n\nKia says pricing will be available closer to the 2020 Cadenza’s on-sale date later in 2020, and we’ll get our first look at it in person today, live from the Chicago Auto Show floor, so stay check back in with us often for coverage.\n\n2020 Kia Cadenza | Manufacturer image\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Kia’s classy redesign of the 2017 Cadenza significantly refines what it has to offer to buyers who want the stretch-out space and feature glut of a full-size luxury sedan for the same cost as a lesser model from an established luxury brand.\n\nThe near-luxury, full-size sedan market is a mixed bag, ranging from boulevard cruisers to would-be sports sedans, from hybrids to V-8s. But it’s mostly made up of V-6 sedans battling for a loyal but shrinking pool of mainly older buyers who’d rather open their wallets for a big, comfortable car than for an SUV.\n\nThe redone Cadenza is a better car than the previous generation in nearly all respects; compare the 2017 with the 2016 here. But its competition isn’t standing still, either: The Buick LaCrosse got a classy redesign for 2017, and Nissan’s Maxima got a full makeover for 2016. The class sales leader, the Toyota Avalon, was also recently refreshed. Compare these rivals here.\n\nGive Kia points for sticking with it, rolling out a second generation of a car that’s only sold about 30,000 since it debuted as a 2014 model; Kia says competing in new market segments is essential to cement its status as a mainstream brand. In Kia’s car lineup, the Cadenza slots above the mid-size Optima family sedan and below the pricey K900 luxury yacht. For 2017, the Cadenza is available in Premium, Technology and Limited trims. I tested the Limited, which comes fully loaded; there are no significant options to add.\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nRather than radical cosmetic surgery, the 2017 Cadenza got a subtle lift here and tuck there, yet the overall look is a lot more like an upscale European car and a lot less like a dressed-up version of Kia’s smaller Optima, with which the Cadenza shares a platform. As is Kia’s design tradition, you needn’t squint to see hints of Audi in the look.\n\nThe 2017 is slightly lower and wider on a wheelbase that’s been stretched about a half-inch. It’s no larger than the 2016, but it looks as if it were — an effect amplified by its wider grille and headlights that stretch around the corners. The headlight clusters include striking Z-shaped LED daytime running lights that impart a sense of motion; Technology and Limited trims add full LED headlights. The Z is amber on the Limited, allowing the LEDs to also function as distinctive turn signals. The LED Z is repeated in the wraparound taillights, and the Zs are linked by an Audi-like character line that runs the length of the car.\n\nFoglight pods on the lower front corners (they’re LEDs on the Technology and Limited trims) also house functional air inlets that channel air into the wheel wells to create an aerodynamic air curtain.\n\nThe greenhouse is stretched farther to the rear, serving both to make the car look longer and to increase rear headroom, making for more upright seating that makes the backseat feel roomier.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThe Cadenza is no sports sedan and it doesn’t pretend to be; a car like this is about sitting back and enjoying the ride. The new Cadenza lets you do that without being sloppy: Power is satisfying from an updated 290-horsepower, 3.3-liter V6 that’s mated to a new eight-speed automatic transmission designed in-house by Kia. It now has a manual mode operated using the shift lever and, on higher trims, wheel-mounted paddles. That might seem gratuitous in this car, which handles capably but doesn’t invite you to carve twisty roads, but it proved useful to manage engine braking in a trek through the Blue Ridge Mountains. Shifts were generally positive, though the transmission hesitated a couple times making up its mind on downshifts. A Sport mode perks up accelerator and transmission response, but not aggressively. It was my preferred setting.\n\nThe brakes, whose discs have been increased by an inch in diameter, are firm and linear. The steering is still a bit numb but less so now thanks to an upgraded chip in the electric assist. The ride is tuned for comfort, but a new suspension with more sophisticated shock absorbers offers more road feel without more bumps. It’s a decent balance — better than in the Avalon but slightly short of the new LaCrosse.\n\nAdding to the Cadenza’s nimbler feel is the fact that the new car is lighter and has a chassis Kia says is 35 percent stiffer than the 2016. That said, if you want sportier manners and are willing to compromise on backseat and trunk space, Nissan’s Maxima sedan might be a better fit.\n\nCity and combined fuel economy improved by 1 mpg each for 2017, to 20/28/23 mpg city/highway/combined. That’s more competitive with rival near-premium sedans. But the mileage winner in this group is the Avalon four-cylinder hybrid, which laps the field at 40/39/40 mpg.\n\nInterior\n\nComfort is a need, not a want, in near-luxury sedans, and the redone Cadenza delivers. The cabin is serenely quiet.\n\nLike the exterior design, the redone interior takes a more European turn, starting with a sweeping, horizontal dashboard. Fit and finish are excellent, but the “near” in the car’s near-premium characterization shows in a juxtaposition of luxurious and not-so-much materials. My Limited test car’s soft Nappa leather with diamond stitching on the bolsters could shame a luxury brand, and the seats were still comfy at the end of a long day’s drive. Most of the surfaces you touch feel good, and a suede-like covering for the pillars and ceiling imparts a premium look. The “wood” trim isn’t the real thing you might get from a luxury brand, but it doesn’t look cheap.\n\nThe hard plastic, however, strikes a different chord on surfaces closer to the floor, including the lower door panels. Perhaps the most discordant notes, given the $45,000-plus price of my top-trim Limited test car, were the hard plastic front seatbacks that backseat passengers encountered.\n\nMore consistent is the quality and attention to detail in the car’s array of creature comforts, from the available heated steering wheel and heated and ventilated front seats to a power sunshade in the rear. There’s also an optional huge panoramic moonroof with a power shade that gives the cabin a light, airy feel. An available memory feature for the power driver’s seat, mirror and steering wheel settings makes swapping drivers quick and easy. Among other thoughtful details: The seat heaters automatically dial back the intensity when your backside is sufficiently toasty.\n\nThe rear seat — prime real estate for these cars and their grown-up buyers — features class-leading legroom and good headroom, but only in the outboard seats. At 6-foot-2, I had room to spare behind someone of my height except in the middle seat, where a humped seat cushion and a dip in the ceiling left my head sideways.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nThe Cadenza has upped its technology game with the latest Kia UVO multimedia and emergency connectivity systems, plus standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. A 7-inch touchscreen is standard on the Premium; the Tech and Limited get an 8-inch touchscreen system with navigation and an impressive 12-speaker Harman Kardon audio system with digital surround sound.\n\nScreen response in the Limited I drove was a little slow, but voice commands were quickly recognized. There’s also a welcome array of old-school knobs and buttons (even at the price of some visual clutter). Props to Kia for resisting the temptation to follow the crowd in replacing such user-friendly controls with various touch-sensitive panels and rotary knob controls that look trendy but complicate eyes-free operation.\n\nThe knobs and buttons also have a quality feel and action, and the instrumentation and labels are clean and simple, though I found the uniform white-on-black scheme a little down-market for a premium cabin. The Limited adds a crisp head-up display, though it did not play well with my polarized sunglasses.\n\nThere’s no shortage of places to plug in. A handy covered device bin at the front of the console contains USB connectivity, an analog aux input, a 12-volt outlet and a wireless charging pad. The console bin also has a 12-volt outlet, and the rear of the console has 12-volt and USB power for backseat passengers.\n\nCargo & Storage\n\nAlong with backseat room, a big trunk is expected in this class. The Cadenza doesn’t disappoint, with 16 cubic feet of space that lands it among the class leaders. It needs it, though: Like the Avalon and many other full-size sedans, but unlike the rival LaCrosse and Maxima, the Cadenza’s backseat does not fold to expand cargo space. Kia says it was a trade-off for a quieter cabin.\n\nA downside of the 2017’s longer roofline is that the trunk has a smaller, less convenient opening. The power trunk lid on the Limited offers no-touch automatic opening if you stand near it with the key fob in your pocket or purse.\n\nSafety\n\nThe new Cadenza has not been rated by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. Once it is, it will appear in the Large cars class among competing models like the LaCrosse, Maxima and Avalon, which have been rated for 2017.\n\nThe Cadenza offers an extensive suite of driver safety technology, including a standard backup camera on the two lower trims and an excellent, 360-degree high-resolution camera system on the Limited. Like many automakers, however, Kia disappointingly continues to reserve the most sophisticated safety technology for those who can afford more expensive trim levels.\n\nThe top two Cadenza trims come with a full package of safety tech, including forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning, rear cross-traffic alert and high-beam assist. They also get cruise control with adaptive technology, which operates down to stop-and-go traffic, and blind spot detection. That feature includes not only visual and audible warnings, but also a related function Kia calls lane change assist that will brake the front wheel on the opposite side if you drift toward a vehicle in your blind spot. It doesn’t assist you in changing lanes so much as prevent you from doing so when it’s a bad idea.\n\nYou can’t, however, get that full suite with the front crash system on an entry-level model, even as an option. The base Premium does offer blind spot warning, lane change assist and rear cross-traffic alert, but only bundled in a $3,000 Luxury Package (it’s the only option package on any Cadenza) that includes such features as puddle lamps and an upgraded audio system.\n\nRivals such as the Maxima and LaCrosse are also guilty of such discrimination, but the Toyota notably equips all its Avalons with safety tech that includes a front crash prevention system with automatic braking.\n\nIn our Cars.com Car Seat Check, the Cadenza’s backseat scored “A” grades for all types of child-safety seats except for one “B” it earned for boosters. That was because its flush seat belt buckles might be difficult for kids to operate on their own. The Kia’s roomy backseat, with two sets of Latch anchors and three top tether anchors, fell just short of holding three child seats across in our testing.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nThe challenge for every car in this class is to get buyers to pay near-luxury prices for a mainstream badge. Kia’s added challenge is overcoming its image in the not-so-distant past as a purveyor of cheap rides for the budget-impaired. But since then, Kia rose in the latest J.D. Power U.S. Initial Quality Study to first among any brand — a fact that could boost perceptions.\n\nThe Cadenza also comes with a peace-of-mind bonus: class-leading warranty coverage of five years/60,000 miles for the car and 10 years/100,000 miles for the powertrain. That’s a level of security only matched among large family sedans by its corporate cousin, the Hyundai Azera.\n\nThe best value in the Cadenza lineup is the entry Premium trim, which starts at $32,890 including destination. That price is down about $1,000 from 2016 and undercuts the entry price of an Avalon by about the same amount. It’s also less expensive than many top-trim mid-size sedans, including Kia’s Optima SXL.\n\nAt that cost, you get an upscale sedan with full-size space, a standard V-6 powertrain and a decent complement of features that includes a leather interior, power front seats, a 7-inch touchscreen multimedia system and dual-zone climate control.\n\nIt’s a big price leap, however, to the mid-level Technology model, which adds a lot more luxury features but starts at $39,890 with destination. It’s an even bigger leap to my Limited test car’s $45,290 sticker.\n\nThose prices could have you considering the intangible factor of a fancier nameplate; a comparably equipped top-trim Buick LaCrosse is about $48,000, and a Lexus ES 350 starts about on par with the Technology trim while wearing a Lexus “L,” though for the same money you’ll get a mid-size sedan with fewer features and vinyl seats. Loaded with features comparable to the Cadenza Limited — and opting for luxury-car real wood trim — the smaller Lexus is still shy of $50,000.\n\nNonetheless, the Kia Cadenza Limited delivers a premium driving experience in a stylish package, with a decadent level of features at a competitive price. Only you can decide if that’s worth enough to offset badge lust for a better-known or more status-laden brand. But the Cadenza deserves a good look before you pay more.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
