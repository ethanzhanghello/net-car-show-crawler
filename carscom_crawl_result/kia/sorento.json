      "expert_review": "Some of my most unpleasant automotive experiences have been behind the wheel of Kias, made in Korea and built with all the integrity and durability that suggests.\n\nAfter all, Kia’s reputation is its bargain basement price, not rock-solid reliability.\n\nSo I couldn’t help but be impressed by how dramatically Kia has improved after spending a week with the new Kia Sorento SUV. This is a vehicle whose styling was mistaken for a Lexus on a couple of occasions. It is equipped well for the money and feels more solid than any Kia I’ve ever encountered With a sticker that starts at just $19,500 for a two-wheel-drive Sorento LX to $24,100 for a top-of-the-line 4WD Sorento EX, this mid-size SUV seems like a real buy. After all, most other manufacturers offer compact crossover SUVs in this price range.\n\nThe interior is lined in leather and wood trim. The attractively styled dash has all the controls where you’d expect to find them.\n\nIn addition to cupholders in the center console, each door contains bottle holders molded into the map pocket. The center console also has dual cell phone holders, while the driver’s door has a remote release for the hatchback. There’s even a felt-lined coin holder in the dash.\n\nOverhead, there’s storage space for your sunglasses. Four 12-volt power points, dual front and side airbags, rear wiper and washer are standard, along with cruise control, an AM/FM/CD audio system and the usual power windows, locks and mirrors. And that’s just on the base LX.\n\nStep up to the EX and you’ll also get a power sunroof, alloy wheels, power driver’s seat, steering-wheel-mounted audio controls, speed-sensitive power steering and a Homelink garage door opener.\n\nSo you get a lot of value content-wise. But that’s to be expected in a Kia. So what is it like to drive?\n\nFiring up the 3.5-liter V-6, it seems to have enough power to move this Kia with gusto. Mustering up 192 horses, the silky-smooth four-speed automatic transmission made an impressively smooth and powerful drivetrain. All the power resulted in fairly dismal fuel economy, yielding just 15 mpg including highway driving.\n\nFour-wheel-drive is automatically engaged, although the four-wheel-drive low mode is available for the rough stuff. A rotary switch to the left of the steering wheel engages the different modes.\n\nYes, this is a real SUV, with body-on-frame construction. So it can truly go off-road, unlike most of its competitors.\n\nThe downside to all this sophistication was a mixed bag when it comes to handling. The suspension pounds stiffly over bumps. Yet the body is softly sprung, so body lean comes on quickly and strongly. The chassis doesn’t feel solid when traversing craters, and the numb power steering does little to inspire confidence.\n\nThat is what you give up by settling for a Kia Sorento.\n\nOtherwise, the seating was comfortable, with buckets up front and a rear b ench that was fairly comfortable. A third row isn’t offered. The rear seats fold down easily and the headrests do not have to be removed to complete the task.\n\nSo, while the Kia Sorento is impressive when it comes to standard equipment and price, its weak point is its ride and handling. That’s where the competition excels.\n\nStill, this is a big improvement over many of Kia’s past products and went a long way towards banishing my negative feeling towards Kia.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nKia’s 2003 Sorento was the Korean automaker’s first foray into midsize sport utility vehicles. At less than 182 inches long, the Sorento technically is a compact SUV, but interior dimensions are comparatively closer to midsize SUVs such as the Toyota Highlander, Ford Explorer and Toyota 4Runner.\n\nAlthough the old Sorento’s 3.5-liter V-6 was not the most powerful engine among its competitors, its price — under $20,000 for a reasonably equipped Sorento LX — was competitive. For 2007, Kia bumps the Sorento’s V-6 to 3.8 liters, yielding a 36 percent power increase. Additional safety equipment, more standard features and a mild face-lift are also on the bill. Though Kia lists the same competitors as before, shoppers might also consider some recently upsized compact SUVs such as the Toyota RAV4 and Mitsubishi Outlander.\n\nTrim levels remain the same, with base LX and uplevel EX models. Rear-wheel drive is standard, and two types of four-wheel drive are available. The 2007 Sorento hits showrooms in fall 2006.\n\nExterior\nThe Sorento’s updated fascia looks much like Kia’s smaller Sportage SUV. Shared Sportage styling cues include a multi-slat grille, narrower air dam and larger headlights with orange borders. The revisions add 0.9 inches to the Sorento’s length, for 180.7 inches total. Wheelbase, width and height remain the same.\n\nBoth the LX and EX have 16-inch wheels. An LX Sport Package upgrades to 17 inch wheels while also adding running boards and a rear spoiler. The Sorento EX includes fog lights, while an EX Luxury Package trims the door handles in chrome.\n\nInterior\nFor 2007, the Sorento’s dashboard incorporates updated audio and climate controls as well as new instrument gauges. LX models include standard power accessories, remote keyless entry and a 10-speaker CD audio system. Amenities increase with each trim level, topping out with the EX Luxury Package, which includes dual-zone automatic climate control, leather upholstery and a moonroof.\n\nRear seats fold in a 60/40 split. Cargo volume behind the seats measures 31.7 cubic feet. That’s notably less than a similarly configured RAV4 (36.4) or Highlander (39.7). The Explorer beats all three, with 45.1 cubic feet behind its second-row seats.\n\nAll three competitors have optional third-row seats, which the Sorento lacks.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe 3.8-liter V-6 generates 262 horsepower and 260 pounds-feet of torque, a healthy gain over the previous 3.5-liter V-6’s 192 hp and 217 pounds-feet of torque. It’s not as dramatic an upsurge as Kia might have you expect, as peak torque now arrives at 4,500 rpm instead of the previous 3,000 rpm, but it’s a welcome increase nonetheless.\n\nRear-wheel drive is standard, while part-time four-wheel drive is optional on the LX, LX Sport Edition and EX. It includes a shift-on-the-fly provision and a low-range transfer case. With the EX Luxury Package, Sorento owners get Kia’s Torque-on-Demand system. Similar to all-wheel drive, Torque-on-Demand automatically transfers power if it detects wheel slippage. It also includes a low-range transfer case.\n\nKia discontinued the Sorento’s five-speed manual, leaving a five-speed automatic as the sole transmission. It now offers a sequential-shifting mode.\n\nThanks to the larger engine, towing capacity increases from 3,500 to 5,000 pounds when properly equipped. That puts the Sorento past the V-6 RAV4 and Highlander (both 3,500 pounds) and close to the truck-based V-6 Explorer (5,210 pounds).\n\nSafety\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes are standard, as are an electronic stability system and active front head restraints. Side curtain-type airbags cover the interior, and a knee airbag underneath the steering wheel aims to prevent drivers from sliding under the seat belt in a frontal collision.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nShortly after dropping its compact, first-generation Sportage, Kia introduced a larger, value-priced Sorento sport utility vehicle as a 2003 model. The midsize Sorento is available with rear- or four-wheel drive. Four-wheel-drive models can be equipped with either a part-time or full-time Torque-on-Demand system.\n\nThe Sorento comes in LX and upscale EX trims and competes against such SUVs as the Jeep Grand Cherokee, Nissan Pathfinder and Toyota Highlander.\n\nA new five-speed automatic went into 2005 models. At highway speeds, the transmission automatically downshifts to fourth gear when manual mode is engaged. The Sorento meets LEV-II emissions standards. Blacked-out headlights and side step bars are included in the Sport Package, which comes with a manual transmission.\n\nAutomatic load leveling has been dropped as an option for the 2006 model year. New alloy wheels replace the prior steel units on LX models.\n\nExterior\nThe Sorento uses body-on-frame construction with a ladder frame that contains nine cross-members. Built on a 106.7-inch wheelbase, the SUV measures 179.8 inches long overall.\n\nShort front and rear overhangs permit navigation on steep terrain. Ground clearance is 8.2 inches. All models have four-wheel disc brakes, 16-inch Michelin tires and a full-size spare tire that stows beneath the body. Additional equipment on EX models includes a power moonroof, alloy wheels, fog lamps and two-tone body cladding.\n\nInterior\nThe Sorento seats up to five people. Flip-and-fold 60/40-split rear seats fold to create a flat floor, and cargo space totals 66.4 cubic feet when the rear seat is folded down. Six cupholders and an under-seat storage tray are included.\n\nThe well-equipped LX base model has air conditioning, cruise control, an eight-speaker CD stereo, and power windows, locks and mirrors. The EX model adds an eight-way power driver’s seat, a HomeLink universal garage door opener, remote keyless entry and a Delphi premium cassette/CD stereo.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Sorento’s 3.5-liter V-6 generates 192 horsepower and 217 pounds-feet of torque; it teams with a five-speed Sportmatic automatic transmission or a five-speed-manual gearbox. Part-time four-wheel drive features a dashboard knob for shift-on-the-fly operation; the system isn’t intended for use on dry pavement. Available only on the EX, Kia’s Torque-on-Demand four-wheel-drive system operates automatically. Each transfer case includes a Low range. The Sorento can tow up to 3,500 pounds when properly equipped.\n\nSafety\nSide curtain-type airbags protect front and rear occupants. Antilock brakes are optional.\n\nDriving Impressions\nThe Sorento can clamber up steep, narrow inclines with barely a hint of strain, and its four-wheel-drive capability makes dirt-road treks easy. Performance is similarly strong on regular pavement but doesn’t necessarily beat the competition. Other than some engine blare on hard acceleration and a touch of wind noise at times, the Sorento is quiet.\n\nHandling is a major plus. Steering with a somewhat light feel, the Sorento delivers excellent control and satisfying confidence. Ride comfort actually seems better on rough gravel roads than on the interstate because body motion is a little too noticeable on paved surfaces. The taut suspension can overreact to imperfections.\n\nThe firm seats are especially comfortable and offer pleasant cushioning and impressive support. Rear-seat space is ample, and the gauges are easy to read.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nShortly after dropping its compact Sportage, Kia introduced a larger, value-priced Sorento. The Sorento is a tough, true sport utility vehicle, said Peter Butterfield, Kias chief operating officer, during the vehicles unveiling.\n\nRear-wheel-drive and four-wheel-drive versions are available. The four-wheel-drive models may be equipped with either part-time or full-time Torque-On-Demand operation. The Sorento comes in LX and upscale EX forms and competes against such SUVs as the Jeep Grand Cherokee, Nissan Pathfinder and Toyota Highlander.\n\nFew changes, including a newly available manual gearbox and metallic interior accents that replace woodgrain in the previous model, are on tap for the 2004 Sorento. A new Sport Package features side step bars, a roof rack, alloy wheels and other extras.\n\nExterior\nThe Sorento uses body-on-frame construction with a ladder frame that contains nine cross-members. It rides a 106.7-inch wheelbase and measures 179.8 inches long overall.\n\nShort front and rear overhangs permit navigation on steep terrain. Ground clearance is just over 8 inches. All models have four-wheel disc brakes, 16-inch Michelin tires, a side-opening rear hatch and a full-size spare tire that stows beneath the body. Additional equipment on the EX model includes a power sunroof, alloy wheels, fog lamps and two-tone body cladding.\n\nInterior\nThe Sorento seats five people. Flip-and-fold 60/40-split rear seats fold to create a flat floor, and cargo space amounts to 66.4 cubic feet when the rear seat is folded down. Kia claims the Sorento has 107 cubic feet of interior volume. Six cupholders and an under-seat storage tray are included.\n\nThe well-equipped LX base model has air conditioning, cruise control, an eight-speaker CD audio system, and power windows, locks and mirrors. The EX model adds an eight-way power drivers seat, a HomeLink universal garage door opener, remote keyless entry and a Delphi premium CD/cassette stereo. Leather upholstery is optional.\n\nUnder the Hood\nKias 3.5-liter V-6 engine generates 192 horsepower and 217 pounds-feet of torque; it teams with a four-speed-automatic transmission or the new five-speed-manual unit. Part-time four-wheel drive features a dashboard knob for shift-on-the-fly operation and is not intended for use on dry pavement. Available only on the EX, Kias Torque-On-Demand four-wheel-drive system operates automatically. Each transfer case includes a Low range. The Sorento can tow as much as 3,500 pounds, and an automatic-leveling system is available.\n\nSafety\nSide curtain-type airbags protect front and rear occupants. Antilock brakes are offered as optional equipment.\n\nDriving Impressions\nThe Sorento can clamber up steep, narrow inclines with barely a hint of strain, and its four-wheel-drive capability makes dirt-road treks look easy. Performance is similarly strong on regular pavement, but its not necessarily better than the competition. The automatic transmission behaves well. Other than some engine blare on hard acceleration and a touch of wind noise at times, the Sorento is quiet.\n\nIts handling is a major plus. The Sorento steers with a somewhat light feel and delivers excellent control and satisfying confidence. Ride comfort actually seems better on rough gravel roads than on the interstate because body motion is a little too noticeable on paved surfaces. The taut suspension can overreact to imperfections.\n\nThe Sorentos firm seats are especially comfortable and offer pleasant cushioning and impressive support. Rear-seat space is ample, and the gauges are easy to read.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com;\nPosted on 8/27/03",

      "expert_review": "The 2008 Kia Sorento fit in like one of the family at our house. It was a casual, no-frills kind of ride that we didn’t need to “front” for. It was obviously hard-working, with its 4×4 capabilities and high ground clearance. The Sorento had dependable qualities, too, with Kia’s 10-year/100,000-mile limited powertrain warranty and five-year/60,000-mile 24-hour roadside assistance.\n\nWhile there were enough similarities between my family and the Sorento to make us feel at home in this SUV, there were also numerous differences. For example, those in my crew tend to be somewhat slight in height and weight (aka wimpy); the Sorento is huge. The Sorento is tall and towering and difficult – no, impossible – for my kids to climb into on their own without getting filthy. I might as well add that it was also impossible for my kids to buckle in – a task that brought my 6-year-old to tears more than once during our test drive (pssst…wimpy – yup, all of us).\n\nLike us, the Sorento was, in fact, slightly clumsy and awkward; this is somehow OK in humans but not so much in cars. Getting the Sorento up to speed was tough. It felt like I was trying to push a large block of lead uphill with my spaghetti-like arms. It’s important to note that while the Sorento took a while to reach higher speeds, she was able to maintain them once they were tackled. Way to persevere, Sorento! Yeah, that’s another thing we work on in our house.\n\nOK, so there was some sluggishness and clunkiness with the Sorento. At times it was really cumbersome to drive. It didn’t have an impressive turning radius, and its exterior mirrors were too small for the size of the car, so it was often difficult to assess our location in relation to our surroundings. Likewise, the rearview mirror should have offered up a much better view than it did. Oh, and the windshield seemed like it was at a lower angle than other cars I’ve been in. Both my hubby and I had a feeling that the windshield was ready to slice right into our foreheads. But every family member has quirks, right? You just learn to work around them.\n\nFAMILY LIFESTAGE\n\nIn Diapers: There’s plenty of room for rear-facing child-safety seats. In School: It’s doable but not ideal because it’s hard for kids to climb in and buckle up. Teens: There’s space for gangly teen legs in the backseat.\n\nThis is where the Kia Sorento tugged at my familial heartstrings. It’s just so darn cute! I spent some time analyzing why I thought it looked so adorable. Did it have big round eyes (headlights) like an infant? Nope. Did it have a soft furry belly, like our dog? Nope. I’ve got it! The Kia Sorento looks like a bunny! No, I’m serious here – stick with me for a second. We have a pet bunny, and we adore him for his cuddle-ability. I won’t go into lengthy detail regarding the physical similarities, but there are several, from our bunny’s face to his ears to the rounded rear end! The Sorento is bunny-licious from every angle.\n\nI did appreciate the Sorento’s privacy glass, as well as the available chrome door handles; both added a dash of sleek sophistication to the Sorento’s cuteness. Also, the height of the car, while making it difficult to climb into and out of, was nice when pulling up to a curb to park. There was so much clearance I never had to hear that loud, grating “oops, I hit the curb again” sound.\n\nThe doors were heavy, but I haven’t figured out if this was a good or bad thing. If they’re too light, the car feels cheap, but if they’re too heavy, we get bruised. I did run into problems with the rear cargo door. I’d slam it and the interior warning light would say it was still open, which would force me to go back into the frigid temps and blowing nastiness to shut it again. This happened a couple of times while testing the Sorento.\n\nThe Kia Sorento’s interior was basic – very basic. At one point I thought the instrument panel gauges could double for fake gauges in a cardboard car. Beyond the instrument panel, though, I found the Sorento to be pretty well-appointed. The EX model I drove had the Leather Package, which included leather seats in addition to the standard leather-wrapped steering wheel. This was nice. I always prefer leather to fabric seats because it cleans well and seems more durable. However, and I’m just saying this in general, I think automakers should know that just because they throw leather in a car doesn’t mean we mistake an affordable, humble car for a super-lux model. For the record, there’s more to lux than leather.\n\nThe Sorento’s center console was appropriately multifunctional, with a deep storage bin, two cupholders and a couple of random cubbies for my stuff; it was perfect. There was an overhead console with a digital readout and map lights, which were pretty convenient.\n\nThe power-adjustable driver’s seat with lumbar support was heated in the model I drove and added some, “Who said a Kia couldn’t be comfy?” to my test drive.\n\nThe second row was less impressive because my kids just had such a hard time with it. First there was the getting-in problem, followed by the buckling-in problem. Then there was the problem of the large distance between the babies and their cupholders. It wasn’t the most well-planned space for kids.\n\nThe cargo area was awesome, though. There’s lots of space, cargo netting, a full-size spare tire, some more netting, a 12-volt plug, a liftgate with flip-up glass and…you get where I’m going with this. There was a whole lot going on in the trunk.\n\nOverall, I thought the interior of the Sorento was well-appointed for the price.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore Cargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore\n\nKia covers all the basics on safety: There are frontal-impact airbags, a driver’s knee airbag and side curtain airbags for the first and second row. The Sorento has stability and traction control, as well as active head restraints in the front row. But there’s not much beyond that safety-wise, except the Sorento’s 4×4 capabilities, which will help you get out of wintery, muddy or bouldery binds.\n\nThe Sorento also has a 10-year/100,000-mile limited powertrain warranty and five-year/60,000-mile 24-hour roadside assistance. That never hurts.\n\nDid I feel safe in the Sorento? Sure, for the most part. But I did wonder if those awkward, clunky-feeling driving moments would wear off with time or if they’d continue to pose driving challenges. Only time would tell.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair Fun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Some",

      "expert_review": "Coming off a redesign for 2021, the Kia Sorento offers a unique value proposition among three-row SUVs with a smaller footprint and price tag than its competitors. The Sorento returns for 2022 with some key changes to its trim roster. Most notably, a new plug-in hybrid (PHEV) model is added. The 2022 Sorento’s gas-only model sees a small price bump, starting at $30,665. Hybrid models are priced from $35,165, while the PHEV’s price remains under wraps (all prices include destination).\n\nRelated: 2022 Kia Sorento Plug-In Hybrid: Kia Launches First Mainstream 3-Row PHEV\n\nPlug-In Hybrid Available in 2 Trims; Pricing Still TBD\n\nFor 2021, the Sorento offered three engine choices: a 2.5-liter four-cylinder, turbo 2.5-liter four-cylinder and a turbo 1.6-liter four-cylinder hybrid. The 2022 Sorento PHEV adds a fourth powertrain option that balances efficiency with increased power: a 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine and six-speed automatic transmission, paired with a 13.8-kilowatt-hour battery and 66.9-kilowatt electric motor. The PHEV will make 261 combined horsepower (an increase of 34 over the standard hybrid), and is expected to have an all-electric range of 32 miles and a projected rating of 79 mpg-equivalent. It will be offered in two trims: SX and SX-P.\n\nHybrid Models Gain AWD\n\nFor 2021, the Sorento Hybrid came only in front-wheel drive, but an all-wheel drive option has been added for the 2022 Sorento Hybrid S and EX models. Going with an AWD Sorento Hybrid over a FWD model adds an additional $1,800-$2,300 depending on the trim.\n\n2022 Kia Sorento | Manufacturer image\nX-Line Crosses the Line Into New Trims\n\nPreviously only offered on the top SX-P model, the X-Line Package is now offered on the S, EX and SX-P trims for 2022. The package adds AWD with a center-locking differential and drive mode select, plus a more rugged exterior with specific bumpers, roof rack, wheels, exterior trim and X-Line badging. The X-Line Package adds $2,000-$3,700 depending on the trim.\n\nUpgraded Tech and Convenience Features\n\nA 10.25-inch multimedia touchscreen with navigation now comes standard on all but the base LX model. For 2021, the larger screen was standard only on higher-level trims. For 2022, it replaces a smaller 8-inch screen in the outgoing Sorento S and EX models. The top-tier SX-P model gains standard memory seats with 14-way power and a new thigh extender. Heated second-row captain’s chairs are also added as a standard feature on the SX-P.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2021 Kia Sorento: 6 Things We Like and 3 Things We Don’t\nWhat’s the Best 3-Row SUV for 2020?\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2021 Kia Sorento?\n2021 Kia Sorento Hybrid Review: Big Vehicle With Small-Vehicle Fuel Economy\nResearch the Kia Sorento\n2022 Kia Sorento Pricing\n\nThe 2022 Sorento’s gas-only models will start at $30,665 (all prices include a $1,175 destination fee), which is a modest increase of $100 over the 2021 Sorento’s base price. The starting price for the range-topping X-Line SX-P comes in at $44,265 —a $500 increase over the 2021 model’s starting price. The 2022 Sorento Hybrid starts at $35,165, which is a $400 price bump over the outgoing hybrid’s price tag.\n\nIf a smaller cabin isn’t a dealbreaker, the Sorento provides substantial savings for families in the market for an affordable three-row SUV. The 2022 Sorento’s starting price is thousands less compared to midsize competitors including the Honda Pilot ($40,285), Subaru Ascent ($33,420) and its own stablemate, the Kia Telluride ($34,015).\n\nSorento LX FWD: $30,665\nSorento LX AWD: $32,465\nSorento S FWD: $33,465\nSorento X-Line S AWD: $35,465\nSorento EX FWD: $36,565\nSorento X-Line EX AWD: $40,265\nSorento SX FWD: $39,365\nSorento SX AWD: $41,165\nSorento SX-P FWD: $42,265\nSorento X-Line SX-P AWD: $44,265\nSorento Hybrid (HEV) S FWD: $35,165\nSorento Hybrid (HEV) S AWD: $36,965\nSorento Hybrid (HEV) EX FWD: $37,165\nSorento Hybrid (HEV) EX AWD: $39,465\nSorento Plug-in Hybrid (PHEV) SX: TBD\nSorento Plug-in Hybrid (PHEV) SX-P: TBD\n\nRelated Video: 2021 Kia Sorento Review\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Kia Sorento?\n\nThe Kia Sorento is a three-row mid-size SUV with seating for up to seven, though space in the third row is cozy at best. Powering the base Sorento is a 191-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission; optional is a 281-hp, turbocharged version of the four-cylinder that’s paired with an eight-speed dual-clutch automatic. Want to stretch your fuel mileage further? The Sorento can be had as a hybrid or plug-in hybrid, with the latter providing 32 miles of electric-only range. The plug-in hybrid comes only with all-wheel drive, but other Sorentos can have front- or all-wheel drive. Rivals include the Honda Passport, Subaru Ascent and Toyota Highlander.\n\nAccording to Cars.com’s cargo measurements, the Sorento has 23.1 cubic feet of cargo space behind the second row and 10.5 cubic feet behind the third. See how it scored in our Car Seat Check here.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Kia Sorento?\n\nThe Sorento enters the 2023 model year with no major updates. Blind spot warning, safe exit assist and rear cross-traffic alert are now standard, with additional changes limited to feature shuffling among trims and powertrains.  \n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Kia Sorento Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n8-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nWireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity\nSix USB ports\nSecond- and third-row bench seats\nAutomatic emergency braking\nBlind spot warning system\nRear cross-traffic alert\nLane departure steering assist\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nPower liftgate\nPanoramic moonroof\nLeather seats\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated second-row captain’s chairs\nHeated steering wheel\nDual-zone automatic climate control\n10.25-inch touchscreen navigation system\nBose premium stereo\nWireless device charging\n360-degree camera system\nAdaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability\nShould I Buy the 2023 Kia Sorento?\n\nThe Sorento has a long list of standard safety and tech features, and while its third row is best left to kids, the added flexibility is handy. The Sorento’s ride is firmer than a number of other mid-size SUVs’, but not punishingly so. There are many powertrain choices, and the fuel-sipping hybrid and plug-in hybrid models have added eco-themed credentials. The Sorento plug-in hybrid is pricey, however, and only comes in the range-topping SX-Prestige trim.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in February 2013 about the 2014 Kia Sorento. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2015, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe redesigned 2014 Kia Sorento doesn’t look very different from the outgoing model, yet Kia says the SUV is 80% new, with a new chassis shared with the Hyundai Santa Fe Sport that brings a host of driving improvements, a redesigned V-6 engine and greater interior dimensions that aim to improve the midsize SUV’s roominess.\n\nThe redesigned 2014 Kia Sorento’s long list of changes adds refinement and desirable features, but the company’s claims of a roomier cabin fall short.\n\nThe Sorento remains an oddly sized SUV that commits neither to being a compact SUV like the Honda CR-V and Chevrolet Equinox nor a larger SUV like the Toyota Highlander and Honda Pilot. Unlike the Santa Fe Sport, which seats five, the Sorento seats five or seven occupants. Hyundai sells a larger model with three rows of seats, the Santa Fe (without the Sport suffix), for which there’s no Kia equivalent.\n\nShoppers content with the Sorento’s size will find a lot to like in the 2014’s added features, improved comfort on the road and a higher-quality look, inside and out.\n\nSorentos are available in front- or all-wheel drive with either a four- or a six-cylinder engine. I drove a 2014 Sorento SX V-6 with all-wheel drive at a Kia event in Arizona.\n\nRide and Handling\nKia hasn’t been known for its high-quality ride and handling. A 2012 Kia Sorento SX we tested in our $37,000 SUV comparison was one of Kia’s best performers at the time, exhibiting excellent road manners and a fun-to-drive zippiness that outshined the Pilot and Highlander. Those attributes are unchanged for 2014 and have matured with a new stiffer chassis that further dispels the notion of a budget Kia with budget ride quality. The Sorento’s stiffer structure makes the SUV feel more substantial and of a higher quality with less body flex and sloppiness over rough roads. The ride remains firmly sprung, though not jarring, with better control.\n\nWind noise continues to plague the Sorento, as wind howls over it at highway speeds. Road noise was a mixed bag; the Sorento rode over some roads quietly while other roads filled the cabin with obnoxious noise from the optional 19-inch tires. Road noise may vary by wheel and tire options: Standard wheels are 17 inches on base LX models, 18 inches on EX models and 19 inches on SX and SX-L trims.\n\nInterior Room\nI had hoped the redesigned Sorento would disperse its three rows more efficiently to improve room for second-row passengers as well as cargo room behind the third row. The previous Sorento attempted to cram the proverbial 10 pounds of stuff in a 5-pound bag, which limited second-row space even in models not equipped with the third row.\n\nThe 2014 Sorento’s specifications seem great on paper, with increases in second-row legroom and third-row headroom. The results aren’t evident when sitting in the second row, however. The second row now slides, reclines and folds in a 40/20/40 configuration, but at 6 feet tall and slender, I found the space tight even with the seat positioned fully rearward. The Chevrolet Equinox and Honda CR-V remain tough acts to follow with extremely generous and more comfortable second rows that don’t have to accommodate a third row like the Sorento.\n\nThe unchanged and scant 9.1 cubic feet of cargo space behind the optional third row provides little room for groceries, or much of anything. Not choosing the third row has a few advantages, like a large hidden storage area beneath the cargo floor and, of course, saving on the seat’s cost: $800 on LX models and $1,000 or more on higher-end trim levels.\n\nThe Sorento’s front-seat roominess is workable for most people but isn’t as generous as some models for exceptionally tall drivers. My 6-foot-5-inch co-driver had severe comfort issues because the driver’s seat didn’t travel back far enough and bent his knees at an uncomfortable angle.\n\nStyling\nThe Sorento’s revisited front and rear styling uses less cheapo unpainted plastic and more body-colored pieces for a higher-quality appearance. It’s a smoother and nicely updated look but not a substantial restyle, as the side profile is virtually unchanged; that’s unfortunate because obtrusive side pillars block over-the-shoulder visibility. A newly available blind spot warning system is optional and a first for Kia, though good visibility and properly aligned side mirrors largely eliminate the need for an expensive blind spot warning system. Blind spot warning is part of a $2,800 Touring Package on the LX four-cylinder and the $4,000 Touring Package on EX V-6 models; it’s standard on SX and SX-L trims.\n\nThe sleeker front and rear look is aided by a thinner Kia grille up front and LED daytime running lights on EX, SX and SX-L trim levels, plus LED taillights on all models. Inside, there’s a new center control panel design and available 7-inch LCD gauge cluster with a smoothly operating digital speedometer with an analog appearance that’s not jerky like some digital readouts. It’s not a flawless execution, though, because the speedometer appeared dull even at its brightest setting.\n\nFeatures\nFirst-time features are abundant in the 2014 Sorento, including an optional adjustable-height power liftgate. Kia says the new chassis allowed the feature for 2014 because the previous Sorento wasn’t rigid enough to support the power feature. Unlike many liftgates, the Sorento’s opens high enough for me to walk under and grab items from the cargo area without worrying about hitting my head. The liftgate is part of an expensive $2,800 Touring Package on lower trim levels, however, and it would be nice to see the useful feature offered as a stand-alone option instead of paired with navigation, an upgraded sound system, a blind spot warning system and more.\n\nThe Sorento is also more expensive for 2014 by $1,000. It now starts at $24,950, including an $850 destination charge. Kia’s mess-resistant Yes Essentials cloth seating material is now standard instead of optional on all models, and there are two leather upholstery options. Leather comes standard on EX and SX models while SX-L models come with premium Nappa leather.\n\nStandard features include a four-cylinder engine and front-wheel drive, seating for five, six-speed automatic transmission, body-colored heated side mirrors with LED turn-signal indicators, air conditioning, USB input, Bluetooth phone and streaming audio, and cruise control. Rear heated outboard seats are newly available, as is the addition of a front passenger ventilated seat to the previous driver-only ventilated seat option.\n\nUnder the Hood\nFor 2014, Kia has ditched the less powerful four-cylinder and offers only a direct-injected 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine that makes 191 horsepower. I got plenty of seat time in the new 290-hp, 3.3-liter V-6, but the four-cylinder wasn’t available for testing. Both engines pair with a six-speed automatic transmission and available all-wheel drive with a 50/50 power-split button to lock the wheels together for maximum traction on slippery surfaces.\n\nThe V-6 is quieter and more refined than previous Kia V-6 offerings. In the Sorento, its acceleration feels typical for an SUV’s V-6 and isn’t going to wow anyone. The turbocharged four-cylinder offered in the Santa Fe Sport is a more compelling engine option, with a rush of power that makes it fun to put the hammer down. The Sorento’s V-6 builds power gradually and quietly, never feeling rushed to do so.\n\nThe Sorento’s in-between size also means in-between gas mileage with a not-so-impressive 20/26 mpg city/highway EPA rating for the four-cylinder and front-wheel drive, which is the most efficient configuration. Similarly equipped compact SUVs like the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4 have much higher starting estimates: 23/31 mpg and 24/31 mpg, respectively. A larger SUV with a standard V-6 engine, the Honda Pilot is rated 18/25 mpg, equaling the Sorento’s V-6 mileage in a much larger package.\n\nChoosing all-wheel drive knocks the four-cylinder’s mpg to 19/24 mpg and the V-6 to 18/24 mpg.\n\nSafety\nAs a recent redesign, the 2014 Kia Sorento hasn’t been tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration at the time of this writing. Standard safety features include the federally required antilock brakes, electronic stability control, front airbags and a tire pressure monitoring system.\n\nThe Sorento also has front-seat-mounted side-impact airbags, side curtain airbags for the first and second rows as well as a rollover sensor and front active head restraints as standard equipment. Unlike most three-row competitors, the Sorento’s side curtain airbags do not extend to the third row. We’ve looked into the importance of third-row airbags and their absence in some SUVs. You can read our findings here.\n\n2014 Kia Sorento in the Market\nThe 2014 Kia Sorento’s refined ride quality and newly available features may not be enough to entice shoppers from other automaker camps. The Sorento continues to strike a balance between small and large SUVs, though with that comes interior room and gas mileage that’s likewise middle of the pack. Sorento shoppers who are perfectly pleased with the size and gas mileage have a lot to look forward to in the 2014 Sorento.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "While test-driving the 2011 Kia Sorento, I found myself behind a two-door soft-top Kia Sportage, circa 1995 or so. The contrast between it and the 2011 Sorento was stark and drove home how far Kia has come since entering the U.S. market. While the old Sportage looked like a chubby Suzuki Samurai, the 2011 Sorento could easily be mistaken for a BMW or Acura.\n\nLooks aren’t the only place that Kia has made improvements, however. Before this newly redesigned 2011 version, the Sorento was a truck-based SUV with not much to recommend it. The 2011 Sorento, however, sits on a car-based crossover platform; it’s a few inches longer than the previous generation, which allows for up to three rows, and offers a decent driving experience. This, when combined with improved fuel economy, make the 2011 Sorento a stylish, savvy crossover.\n\nWith a V-6 engine, acceleration was smooth and relatively quick, and the ride was smooth and pleasantly uneventful. Sure, there were a few things that I didn’t love such as the cramped second and third rows, but overall, the 2011 Sorento looked good and felt good to drive. Competitors beware: This new Sorento just may start to take a bite out of your market share.\n\nThe Sorento starts at $22,395. My test car, an EX with all-wheel drive, cost $34,045 when all was said and done, making it just about the most expensive 2011 Sorento available. My high-end Sorento included a V-6 engine, all-wheel drive and the Limited Package ($2,000), which includes a navigation system with traffic information, Infinity audio system and 18-inch mirror-finish alloy wheels. My test car also came with the Premium Package 2 ($2,700), with a panoramic sunroof, heated front seats, auto-dimming rearview mirror, backup camera and leather-trimmed seats. About the only thing my test car didn’t have was the rear entertainment system ($2,000).\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe Sorento is pretty and sleek, and it looks like it could be born from a more expensive brand. I think it most closely resembles an Acura; however, there’s no arguing that looks-wise it’s a great fit for stylish parents-on-the-go (looks do matter, people).\n\n\n\n\nThe front grille is chrome as are the door handles, which add some panache to the exterior. Seventeen-inch alloy wheels are standard on the base models, but bump up to the EX and you’ll get 18-inch wheels with a mirror finish that adds just the right amount of groove.\n\nNone of the doors, including the liftgate, are too heavy to for adults to manage. I could easily open and shut the liftgate while holding a child — sometimes two — in my arms. The step-in height is also manageable, though when it comes to small children, I find that you can’t beat a minivan (minivans are super cool, FYI). In the Sorento, my 3-year-old son could climb in without a problem, but my almost 2-year-old daughter needed a little boost. I also did just fine getting in and out of the car, thank you very much.\n\nThe Sorento has two engine offerings. The 175-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine gets an EPA-estimated 21/29 mpg city/highway when paired with a six-speed automatic transmission on a front-wheel-drive model. My front-wheel-drive test car had a 276-hp, 3.5-liter V-6 engine and a six-speed automatic transmission that got 20/26 mpg. Four-wheel drive is available and knocks the fuel-economy ratings down a bit.\n\nI was impressed with the fuel economy of this larger vehicle. My test car’s 20/26 mpg isn’t too shabby, especially considering the Sorento’s former front-wheel-drive self got 16/22 mpg.\n\n\n\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nINTERIOR\nThe Sorento is loaded with cupholders and cubbies. There are so many that you’ll never be without a place for your family’s drinks. There’s a bottleholder in all four doors and cupholders can be found next to the gearshift in the front row, in the second row’s fold-down armrest and in the plastic molding of the third row. The multileveled center console has plenty of room for snacks and wipes in the lower level, and the upper tray keeps a pair of sunglasses and lip gloss out of the way. In addition to the nicely laid-out space, the center console houses USB and MP3 jacks as well a 12-volt outlet.\n\nCargo space is great if you never use the third row and even better if you never use the second row (a whopping 72.5 cubic feet!). With the third row down, there’s 37.0 cubic feet of cargo space. With the third row up, cargo volume plummets to 9.1 cubic feet, which holds only the bare essentials from the grocery store. With three small children in three large child-safety seats, I had to leave the third row up at all times.\n\nThe logistics of getting my children into their car seats added another wrinkle to the three-row crossover. None of my children are in booster seats yet, and my test vehicle didn’t have a center aisle, which made getting everyone strapped into their car seats a nightmare. To gain access to the third row, you need to fold the second-row seat and then tumble it forward. Legroom in both the second and third rows was tight for adults. The third row is optional on all models, except for the EX V-6 trim level.\n\nComplaints about the second and third rows now aired, I can tell you that the rest of the interior was perfectly suitable. The black-colored interior on my test car was nothing exciting, but it wasn’t cheap or tacky looking, either. The Sorento’s set of standard features — dual-zone temperature control, Bluetooth connectivity and push-button start — makes it feel like a more expensive vehicle. A couple of the optional features in my test car that are worth mentioning include the panoramic sunroof, Infinity audio system with 10 speakers and navigation system with real-time traffic updates, which is a handy tool for avoiding rush-hour pileups as best as possible. For me, with three impatient babies, that’s priceless.\n\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2011 Sorento has been named a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. To earn this safety nod, a car must receive the top rating of Good in front, side, rear and roof-strength crash tests as well as have standard electronic stability control. The Top Safety Pick status applies to Sorentos built after March 2010. \n\nThe two sets of Latch connectors in the second-row outboard seat were easy enough to access and use. However, I had a difficult time getting my bulky car seats — a rear-facing infant-safety seat and two convertibles — to fit in the second and third rows. To get my rear-facing infant-safety seat to fit, I had to move the front passenger seat really far forward. I’m 5 feet 8 inches tall and my husband is 5 feet 11 inches, and neither one of us felt at ease in that passenger seat with the baby’s seat installed behind it. The forward-facing convertible fit without any problems.\n\nBesides electronic stability control, the Sorento also has standard antilock brakes, traction control and six airbags, including front- and side-impact airbags in the front row and side curtain airbags for the first and second rows, but not the third row. While I didn’t have the chance to take the Sorento deep into the mountains on this test drive, I did get it up in the foothills and these features performed nicely. I also had the occasion to confirm the reliability of the brakes while getting caught up in some alternately fast- and slow-moving traffic during a night out. \n\nGet more safety information about the 2011 Sorento here.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: With wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity added to all trim levels of the 2024 Sorento, Kia has fixed this three-row SUV’s most significant weakness and made it an even better choice than its more popular competitors.\n\nVersus the competition: The Sorento offers space, technology and a driving experience on par with — if not better than — higher-priced competitors like the benchmark Toyota Highlander, making a compelling case for shoppers drawn to larger three-row models — including Kia’s own Telluride — who don’t always need a roomy third row.\n\nIn the glut of three-row SUVs on the market, Kia’s Sorento has often been overshadowed by the Toyota Highlander. But the Sorento has seen some changes for the 2024 model year, including adding wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity standard across the board, as well as getting a subtle face-lift and a more rugged X-Pro Package with all-terrain tires.\n\nRelated: 2024 Kia Sorento: Fresh Face, Fresh Trim, Fresh Price\n\nFor this review, we drove a 2024 Kia Sorento X-Line SX-Prestige. The SX-Prestige is the Sorento’s top trim, and the X-Line Package brings a more rugged appearance and a center locking differential. Including destination, our test vehicle’s as-tested price was $48,285. Our aim was to find out if the freshened 2024 Sorento is still worth shoppers’ consideration — and still a viable alternative to the more popular Toyota Highlander.\n\nThe Sorento is also available with hybrid and plug-in hybrid powertrains, both of which are covered separately in the Cars.com Research section.\n\nTurbocharged Fun\n\nWhile the base engine in the Sorento remains a 2.5-liter four-cylinder, higher trims get a turbocharged version of that engine that makes 281 horsepower and 311 pounds-feet of torque versus the naturally aspirated version’s 191 hp and 181 pounds-feet. In the SX-Prestige, the 2.5 turbo makes the driving experience enjoyable, with ample power and quickness for a vehicle this size. There is some powertrain lag, however; there’s a noticeable beat between when you press the accelerator pedal and when you actually accelerate, but it’s acceptable in a vehicle that is very much not a sports car. The eight-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission that Kia pairs with the turbocharged engine shifts smartly and quickly.\n\nMost of the Sorento’s sporty nature comes from the turbo’s ample power; its steering is light — befitting a family SUV — and body motion is controlled but noticeable when cornering. The real drawbacks in the driving experience are brake pedal feel and chassis behavior. The brake pedal isn’t very linear, with lots of initial bite but extended pedal travel before additional stopping power kicks in. Multiple editors also noted a jittery feeling when driving the Sorento over bumpy pavement; even concrete pavement slab seams were enough to turn the Sorento into a waterbug.\n\nWith the 2.5-liter turbo engine and all-wheel drive, the Sorento earns an EPA-estimated 23 mpg combined, which is only slightly less than a comparable AWD Highlander’s 24 mpg combined rating. It’s also — unsurprisingly — less efficient than the naturally aspirated AWD Sorento’s 25 mpg combined rating. The good news here is that the turbocharged Sorento is much more enjoyable to drive than either of those choices, and the fuel-economy penalty for choosing a little bit of fun is relatively minor.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nComfortable Interior — for Four Adults\n\nThere’s a lot to like inside the Sorento. The addition of wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity in every trim fixes a significant flaw with the previous Sorento while greatly increasing convenience. A new dual-screen panoramic display includes an available 12.3-inch digital instrument panel and standard 12.3-inch center touchscreen; it looks excellent and is easy to use. Most of the materials in the uplevel trim we drove were top-notch for its price; our test vehicle had optional Sage Green leather upholstery, which to my eyes read as gray, not green (though my wife will tell you I’m terrible at seeing colors). Either way, it looked and felt great — and it only added $295 to the price. Forward visibility from the driver’s seat is excellent, and there are no overly large blind spots on the sides. Rear visibility, however, is compromised by the third-row seats’ head restraints. The SX-Prestige’s rearview camera mirror serves as a decent alternative when the view is blocked, but it makes me a little motion sick.\n\nA better camera system is Kia’s Blind View Monitor, which is standard on the Sorento SX and up. Appearing when a turn signal is activated, it shows a view of what’s beside the Sorento. It’s one of my favorite safety features around because it keeps the camera image in front of the driver, in the instrument panel, instead of over on the touchscreen, and it activates on the side of the instrument panel that corresponds with the activated signal, so you instantly know which side of the car you’re looking at.\n\nUp front, my biggest complaint is Kia’s move to a single touch panel that switches between climate and audio controls. It’s a space-saving move that looks high-tech but can be annoying to use. At least this misstep is balanced out by the excellently designed USB charge ports below it, one of which can toggle between a data or charging connection while the other is for charging only. Wireless smartphone mirroring is great, but I’m less enamored with wireless charging; an option that lets me plug in my phone without making the car think I want to use it for data is most welcome.\n\nThe second row is very comfortable for adults, though in higher Sorento trims (EX and above), the only available configuration is a set of captain’s chairs. Given the third row also seats two, higher-trim Sorentos can seat only six. (Thanks, math!)\n\nThe third row, by contrast, is not very comfortable for adults, with a high leg position and minimal head- and legroom. Passengers who do fit back there will at least appreciate its cupholders and USB charging ports, but they won’t have an easy time getting back there. While the second-row captain’s chairs power-fold and flip, the process is slow and doesn’t open up a lot of space for climbing into the way-back. Leaving the captain’s chairs upright and simply accessing the third row through the space between them might work better for smaller passengers, but the path is narrow for adults — and ample headroom in the second row doesn’t translate to ample standing room.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2025 Kia Sorento Stays Steady on Base Price, Starts at $33,365\n2025 Kia Sorento Named IIHS Top Safety Pick, Mixed Results in Grab-Bag Test Session\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2024 Kia Sorento?\nFace-lifted 2025 Kia Sorento Hybrid Starts at $40,065\nShop for a New Kia Sorento\nStill a Smart Alternative?\n\nIs the Sorento still worth your time? Absolutely. Options in the three-row SUV class continue to increase, but the Sorento is still one of the strongest offerings — especially for shoppers who don’t consistently need the third row of seats.\n\nThe turbocharged Sorento is more enjoyable to drive than a comparable Highlander, and higher trims like our test vehicle have a more upscale interior, too. Increased availability of wireless smartphone mirroring in the 2024 Sorento removes an advantage the Toyota used to have on the tech front, and the Kia’s other tech features were already better.\n\nOn top of all that, the Kia is also likely to be a relative bargain. We drove a 2024 Sorento, but pricing is already available for both the 2025 Sorento and 2025 Highlander. The 2025 Sorento starts at just over $33,000 and rises to almost $49,000 for a loaded version, while the Highlander starts over $40,000 and can cost more than $53,000 when fully loaded. An SUV that’s just as good for less money seems like a no-brainer.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The redesigned 2014 Kia Sorento doesn’t look very different from the outgoing model, yet Kia says the SUV is 80% new, with a new chassis shared with the Hyundai Santa Fe Sport that brings a host of driving improvements, a redesigned V-6 engine and greater interior dimensions that aim to improve the midsize SUV’s roominess.\n\nThe redesigned 2014 Kia Sorento’s long list of changes adds refinement and desirable features, but the company’s claims of a roomier cabin fall short.\n\nThe Sorento remains an oddly sized SUV that commits neither to being a compact SUV like the Honda CR-V and Chevrolet Equinox nor a larger SUV like the Toyota Highlander and Honda Pilot. Unlike the Santa Fe Sport, which seats five, the Sorento seats five or seven occupants. Hyundai sells a larger model with three rows of seats, the Santa Fe (without the Sport suffix), for which there’s no Kia equivalent.\n\nShoppers content with the Sorento’s size will find a lot to like in the 2014’s added features, improved comfort on the road and a higher-quality look, inside and out.\n\nSorentos are available in front- or all-wheel drive with either a four- or a six-cylinder engine. I drove a 2014 Sorento SX V-6 with AWD at a Kia event in Arizona.\n\nRide and Handling\nKia hasn’t been known for its high-quality ride and handling. A 2012 Kia Sorento SX we tested in our $37,000 SUV comparison was one of Kia’s best performers at the time, exhibiting excellent road manners and a fun-to-drive zippiness that outshined the Pilot and Highlander. Those attributes are unchanged for 2014 and have matured with a new stiffer chassis that further dispels the notion of a budget Kia with budget ride quality. The Sorento’s stiffer structure makes the SUV feel more substantial and of a higher quality with less body flex and sloppiness over rough roads. The ride remains firmly sprung, though not jarring, with better control.\n\nWind noise continues to plague the Sorento, as wind howls over it at highway speeds. Road noise was a mixed bag; the Sorento rode over some roads quietly while other roads filled the cabin with obnoxious noise from the optional 19-inch tires. Road noise may vary by wheel and tire options: Standard alloy wheels are 17 inches on base LX models, 18 inches on EX models and 19 inches on SX and SX-L trims.\n\nInterior Room\nI had hoped the redesigned Sorento would disperse its three rows more efficiently to improve room for second-row passengers as well as cargo room behind the third row. The previous Sorento attempted to cram the proverbial 10 pounds of stuff in a 5-pound bag, which limited second-row space even in models not equipped with the third row.\n\nThe 2014 Sorento’s specifications seem great on paper, with increases in second-row legroom and third-row headroom. The results aren’t evident when sitting in the second row, however. The second row now slides, reclines and folds in a 40/20/40 configuration, but at 6 feet tall and slender, I found the space tight even with the seat positioned fully rearward. The Chevrolet Equinox and Honda CR-V remain tough acts to follow with extremely generous and more comfortable second rows that don’t have to accommodate a third row like the Sorento.\n\nThe unchanged and scant 9.1 cubic feet of cargo space behind the optional third row provides little room for groceries, or much of anything. Not choosing the third row has a few advantages, like a large hidden storage area beneath the cargo floor and, of course, saving on the seat’s cost: $800 on LX models and $1,000 or more on higher-end trim levels.\n\nThe Kia Sorento’s front-seat roominess is workable for most people but isn’t as generous as some models for exceptionally tall drivers. My 6-foot-5-inch co-driver had severe comfort issues because the driver’s seat didn’t travel back far enough and bent his knees at an uncomfortable angle.\n\nStyling\nThe Kia Sorento’s revisited front and rear styling uses less cheapo unpainted plastic and more body-colored pieces for a higher-quality appearance. It’s a smoother and nicely updated look but not a substantial restyle, as the side profile is virtually unchanged; that’s unfortunate because obtrusive side pillars block over-the-shoulder visibility. A newly available blind spot warning system is optional and a first for Kia, though good visibility and properly aligned side mirrors largely eliminate the need for an expensive blind spot warning system. Blind spot warning is part of a $2,800 Touring Package on the LX four-cylinder and the $4,000 Touring Package on EX V-6 models; it’s standard on SX and SX-L trims.\n\nThe sleeker front and rear look is aided by a thinner Kia grille up front and LED daytime running lights on EX, SX and SX-L trim levels, plus LED taillights on all models. Inside, there’s a new center control panel design and available 7-inch LCD gauge cluster with a smoothly operating digital speedometer with an analog appearance that’s not jerky like some digital readouts. It’s not a flawless execution, though, because the speedometer appeared dull even at its brightest setting.\n\nFeatures\nFirst-time features are abundant in the 2014 Kia Sorento, including an optional adjustable-height power liftgate. Kia says the new chassis allowed the feature for 2014 because the previous Sorento wasn’t rigid enough to support the power feature. Unlike many liftgates, the Kia Sorento’s opens high enough for me to walk under and grab items from the cargo area without worrying about hitting my head. The liftgate is part of an expensive $2,800 Touring Package on lower trim levels, however, and it would be nice to see the useful feature offered as a stand-alone option instead of paired with navigation, an upgraded sound system, a blind spot warning system and more.\n\nThe Kia Sorento is also more expensive for 2014 by $1,000. It now starts at $24,950, including an $850 destination charge. Kia’s mess-resistant Yes Essentials cloth seating material is now standard instead of optional on all models, and there are two leather upholstery options. Leather comes standard on EX and SX models while SX-L models come with premium Nappa leather.\n\nStandard features include a four-cylinder engine and front-wheel drive, seating for five, six-speed automatic transmission, body-colored heated side mirrors with LED turn-signal indicators, air conditioning, USB input, Bluetooth phone and streaming audio, and cruise control. Rear heated outboard seats are newly available, as is the addition of a front passenger ventilated seat to the previous driver-only ventilated seat option.\n\nUnder the Hood\nFor 2014, Kia has ditched the less powerful four-cylinder and offers only a direct-injected 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine that makes 191 horsepower. I got plenty of seat time in the new 290-hp, 3.3-liter V-6, but the four-cylinder wasn’t available for testing. Both engines pair with a six-speed automatic transmission and available AWD with a 50/50 power-split button to lock the wheels together for maximum traction on slippery surfaces.\n\nThe V-6 is quieter and more refined than previous Kia V-6 offerings. In the Sorento, its acceleration feels typical for an SUV’s V-6 and isn’t going to wow anyone. The turbocharged four-cylinder offered in the Santa Fe Sport is a more compelling engine option, with a rush of power that makes it fun to put the hammer down. The Sorento’s V-6 builds power gradually and quietly, never feeling rushed to do so.\n\nThe Sorento’s in-between size also means in-between gas mileage with a not-so-impressive 20/26 mpg city/highway EPA fuel economy rating for the four-cylinder and front-wheel drive, which is the most efficient configuration. Similarly equipped compact SUVs like the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4 have much higher starting estimates: 23/31 mpg and 24/31 mpg, respectively. A larger SUV with a standard V-6 engine, the Honda Pilot is rated 18/25 mpg, equaling the Sorento’s V-6 mileage in a much larger package.\n\nChoosing AWD knocks the four-cylinder’s fuel economy mpg to 19/24 mpg and the V-6 to 18/24 mpg.\n\nSafety\nAs a recent redesign, the 2014 Kia Sorento hasn’t been tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration at the time of this writing. Standard safety features include the federally required antilock brakes, electronic stability control, front airbags and a tire pressure monitoring system.\n\nThe Kia Sorento also has front-seat-mounted side-impact airbags, side curtain airbags for the first and second rows as well as a rollover sensor and front active head restraints as standard equipment. Unlike most three-row competitors, the Sorento’s side curtain airbags do not extend to the third row. We’ve looked into the importance of third-row airbags and their absence in some SUVs. You can read our findings here.\n\n2014 Kia Sorento in the Market\nThe 2014 Kia Sorento’s refined ride quality and newly available features may not be enough to entice shoppers from other automaker camps. The Sorento continues to strike a balance between small and large SUVs, though with that comes interior room and gas mileage that’s likewise middle of the pack. Kia Sorento shoppers who are perfectly pleased with the size and gas mileage have a lot to look forward to in the 2014 Sorento.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The middle child in a family of SUV overachievers, the redesigned 2021 Kia Sorento is ready for the spotlight thanks to a thoughtfully designed cabin, comfortable road manners and a robust list of standard safety features. \n\nVersus the competition: The Sorento stands out with a slick new multimedia system and interior materials that give even luxury SUVs a run for their money; many other three-row SUVs this size, however, have more cargo room. \n\nThe Sorento three-row SUV was redesigned for 2021 and slots just below the Telluride three-row SUV in Kia’s lineup. The Sorento is bigger this year and has an updated multimedia system, a nicer cabin, an available hybrid powertrain, more standard safety features and a rugged off-road version. Compare it with the outgoing model. \n\nThe redesigned Sorento goes up against the likes of the Honda Pilot, Toyota Highlander and Volkswagen Atlas; see them compared. \n\nBest Dressed Award\n\nKia did a top-notch job with the Telluride’s interior, but it seems the automaker was just practicing for the Sorento, whose cabin belongs in a higher class. \n\nI tested the line-topping SX-Prestige X-Line trim level. It was lovely, with elegant design, high-brow materials and attention to detail. “Yes please” to cushy quilted-leather seats, classy low-gloss wood trim and soft-touch plastic padding in all the right places. I  suspect lesser trims will have less of all that, but this trim gets it right. \n\nIt’s also a thoughtfully packaged cabin, with an emphasis on small items that can make a big impact in terms of comfort and convenience. A few favorites: the big uncovered space under the controls, the small mesh pockets on the sides of the second-row seats, plenty of USB ports in all three rows and a rubber cargo mat that can be pulled down from the rear seatbacks to help contain messy items in back. \n\nThe new Sorento has grown a little for 2021, now riding on a 1.4-inch-longer wheelbase. It still has three rows, but the longer wheelbase translates into a bit more people and cargo room than the outgoing version. Mine had second-row captain’s chairs, but you can also get a bench seat that fits three. The third row seats two.\n\nIt’s on the roomier side of the class in terms of rear legroom, but the Sorento trails competitors a bit in headroom back there. I had plenty of both at 5-foot-6, and we easily fit two child-safety seats in the second row thanks to accessible Latch anchors and ample room. See our Car Seat Check for more.  Getting to the third row is also struggle-free thanks to a button on the captain’s chairs, which quickly opens a large passageway to the third row, though this doesn’t work with car seats installed. If that’s the case, passengers will have to use the aisle between the chairs instead, and it’s pretty narrow. \n\nThe outgoing Sorento’s third row was only small-kid-friendly (or for adults you’re not friendly with), and while this year’s model is slightly roomier, it’ll still be a pain for adults. Kia has done a lot with a little, however: My test model had USB ports, cupholders and storage areas big enough for a device on each side. There are also two sets of lower anchors back there and top tether anchors for car seats — a setup not every three-row SUV has. (The Highlander’s third row, for example, has no lower anchors.)\n\nOthers do cargo better, however. Kia says there’s just 12.6 cubic feet of space behind the third row; that’s up a tiny bit from 2020, but still significantly behind manufacturer-reported numbers for the Pilot (16.5 cubic feet), Highlander (16) and Atlas (20.6). Wary of how manufacturers measure cargo space, Cars.com has begun measuring the space behind our test vehicles’ second and third rows (when present), and our numbers confirmed that the Sorento trails the others, with 6.6 cubic feet behind the third row and 22.1 cubic feet with that row folded. That’s versus 14.1 and 29.9 cubic feet in the Atlas and 10.5 and 23.1 cubic feet in the Lincoln Aviator. We haven’t measured a Telluride yet, but its sister, the Hyundai Palisade, measured 11.2 and 26.2 cubic feet behind the third and second rows, respectively.\n\nTech Revamp\n\nThe Sorento’s multimedia system can also join the thoughtful-items column. New this year is a giant available 10.25-inch touchscreen (borrowed from the Telluride). It’s front and center in upper trims of the new Sorento, while a standard 8-inch unit goes in lower trims. The system checks all the boxes: It’s easy to see, read and use, with good responsiveness and straightforward menus. I found some of the graphics to be a little odd, but maybe I’m just not cool enough to understand the appeal of encapsulating radio station frequencies in old timey lightbulbs. [Editor’s note: Or old enough to recognize a vacuum tube.]  \n\nThe multimedia system uses the latest version of Kia’s Uvo software, and it has enhanced voice-control functions that allow for control of climate settings, seats, steering-wheel heating and the audio system. Uvo also has two new features: First, Find My Car uses the vehicle’s cameras to snap images of its surroundings, then shares them via the Kia Access Uvo app. The other is the Last Mile function, which provides walking directions to your final destination if it senses the car is parked between 0.1 and 1.2 miles away.\n\nOther new features in the cabin include a rotary gear selector (which wasn’t at all annoying to use, unlike some others), available wireless cellphone charging, a 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster and up to eight USB charging ports. As with 2020’s version, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration are standard. A rear-seat entertainment system is an optional feature, though at $1,500, it’s not cheap. \n\nUnruffled Road Manners\n\nThe 2021 Kia Sorento’s road manners are a match for its cabin: comfortable and refined. The redesigned SUV rides on a new platform and ditches its previous powertrains for a few new ones, including a hybrid. There’s a base 191-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine and an uplevel 281-hp, turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder. The previous V-6 is no longer available. \n\nI tested the turbo 2.5-liter with the eight-speed automatic and found the pair to be well matched; after a hint of turbo lag, power was prompt, smooth and quiet. The automatic engine stop-start system was well behaved, with nearly seamless transitions. A drive mode selector allows for Eco, Sport, Comfort and Snow modes; I favored Sport for its amped up acceleration response. \n\nThe version I drove was the new off-road-oriented X-Line SX-Prestige trim, and along with a more robust all-wheel-drive system, it also has an extra inch of ride height,  trim-specific bumper design, a roof rack and 20-inch alloy wheels. While I didn’t get to put the AWD system to the test, I found the Sorento to be stable and confident at all times, maintaining composure over bumps and steadiness in corners; some editors thought the ride was on the firm side, however. Smaller wheels will likely improve ride quality. \n\nThe Sorento will also be available with a front-wheel-drive hybrid powertrain using a 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine and electric motor for a total system output of 227 hp.  It’s EPA-estimated to get 39/35/37 mpg city/highway/combined — solid numbers for a vehicle this size. In this class, Toyota offers a hybrid version of the Highlander that’s rated 36/35/36 mpg with FWD and slightly lower with AWD, which the regular Sorento Hybrid doesn’t offer. A plug-in hybrid Sorento will offer it later in 2021. \n\nThe regular Sorento is also no slouch when it comes to fuel economy. With the base engine and AWD, it gets an EPA-estimated 23/25/24 mpg — better than base AWD versions of the Pilot (19/26/22 mpg), Atlas (20/24/22 mpg), and Highlander 20/27/23). \n\nSafety\n2021 Kia Sorento | Cars.com photo by Jennifer Geiger\n\nKia added more standard safety features for 2021, as well as some new options. Standard across the lineup is automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, a driver attention warning system, adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go, lane keep assist and automatic lane-centering.\n\nAvailable features include blind spot collision avoidance assist, a blind view monitor, rear cross-traffic collision avoidance assist, navigation-based adaptive cruise control, and a cyclist component of the forward collision warning system that helps detect cyclists in front of the vehicle and automatically brake to prevent an accident. Also available is safe exit assistance for the rear seats, which uses the SUV’s rear-facing radar to detect oncoming traffic and prevent a rear door from being opened if an approaching vehicle or bicycle is detected.\n\nThe Sorento is competitive in terms of safety features, even one-upping some other three-row SUVs on some equipment. First, there’s a standard rear-seat alert system that uses ultrasonic sensors to detect child or pet movement in the second and third rows after the doors have been locked; if movement is detected, the system sounds the horn and illuminates the hazard lamps. Many other automakers use a less sophisticated door sequence logic system that merely reminds drivers who had opened a rear door before driving if they don’t reopen it afterward. \n\nAnother standout offering is my favorite safety feature: the available blind view monitor. The monitor projects a live video view of adjacent lanes in the instrument cluster and is activated via the turn signal. I find this especially useful in congested city driving when I’m sharing the road with cars, people and bikes.\n\nBut What About the Telluride?\n2020 Kia Telluride | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nKia’s new-for-2020 Telluride SUV wowed us so much, we wondered why the automaker was even keeping its smaller Sorento around. The answer is a redesigned 2021 Sorento that’s good — but so is the Telluride, and the models’ base prices put them in competition with each other.  \n\nThe 2021 Kia Sorento starts at $30,565 in base front-wheel-drive LX trim — just below the Telluride’s $33,415 base price (all prices include destination). While you get more room in the Telluride, you also have to get a thirstier V-6 engine. See the models compared. \n\nAgainst the Honda Pilot, Toyota Highlander and Volkswagen Atlas, the Sorento is priced thousands less than all. The Sorento Hybrid starts at $34,765 and comes only in mid-level S and EX trims. The price premium for the hybrid model looks high, but it undercuts the Highlander Hybrid, which starts at $39,685 in base LE trim. \n\nKia has a strong SUV lineup, and with its 2021 redesign, the Sorento has earned some time in the spotlight, outshining many other three-row SUVs in the class — and maybe even one from the automaker’s own lineup. In this case, shoppers looking for a three-row SUV stand to benefit from a little sibling rivalry.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Every time I test-drive a Kia, my husband is flabbergasted by it. Evidently, his knowledge of Kia doesn’t reach beyond 1994 or so. He seems to have missed the hamster commercials and the numerous safety and vehicle awards. However, thanks to the 2013 Sorento, a five- or seven-seat crossover, his Kia ignorance has come to an end.\n\nThe 2013 Kia Sorento has a great price, comes with plenty of standard features, accommodates a busy family and is even fun to drive (the V-6 version, anyhow).\n\nThe Sorento comes with three engine options. My test car came with the most powerful engine, a 3.5-liter V-6. It handles the road with some pluck and plenty of power. Of course, there is always room for improvement, and Kia has redesigned the Sorento for the 2014 model year. The 2014 Sorento will arrive at dealerships in March. Read the expert review.\n\nThe 2013 Sorento has a starting price of $23,950, including an $800 destination charge. My midlevel EX trim test car with all-wheel drive, the Limited ($2,000) and Premium ($3,400) packages, a 50/50-split third row and a panoramic sunroof had an as-tested price of $36,090.\n\nEXTERIOR\nOne thing that didn’t surprise my husband about the 2013 Sorento was its looks. He bluntly noted that the parade of family crossovers in our driveway isn’t memorable. The 2013 Sorento looks just fine and like many other cars on the road. It has clean lines, a few attractive curves and a punchy grille that reminds me of a large version of airline pilots’ lapel wings.\n\nMy test car also came with the available rear spoiler that adds some sportiness without being obnoxious. Keyless entry is standard and means no more digging in your purse for those keys, which is something welcome in my world. Once those doors are unlocked, all but the smallest children should be able to get them open (if they can reach the handle). Smaller children will need some help climbing in due to the higher step-in height.\n\nOn my test car, the liftgate was of a manageable weight. An under-floor compartment in the cargo area is only useful for small things since the optional first-aid kit and tire jack take up most of the room. In another expected-from-this-class twist, cargo space moves from dismal to decent according to how many rows are in use. It does help that the optional third row has a 50/50 split and the second row has a 60/40 split; this allows for some added convenience and wiggle room. With the third row in use, there is a nearly useless 9.1 cubic feet of cargo space. When the third row is folded, the cargo area bumps up to a more useful 37 cubic feet, and with both rows folded flat, there is 72.5 cubic feet of cargo volume.\n\nA 175-horsepower, 2.4-liter four-cylinder is the entry-level engine; both a direct-injected version of the base engine that bumps up to horsepower to 191 and a 276-hp, 3.5-liter V-6 engine are available. The Sorento comes standard with a six-speed automatic transmission and front-wheel drive, though all-wheel drive is optional.\n\nFuel economy for the base four-cylinder engine is an EPA-estimated at 21/29 mpg city/highway with front-wheel drive and 20/26 mpg with all-wheel drive. The direct-injected four-cylinder gets 21/30 mpg with front drive and 21/27 mpg with all-wheel drive. The V-6 with front drive gets 20/26 mpg and 18/24 mpg with all-wheel drive.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nINTERIOR\nThe Sorento’s interior is quite attractive, particularly when you consider its price. There are charcoal-colored faux-wood trim pieces elegantly and economically placed throughout the cabin. Even with a fair amount of black plastic in the cabin, it manages to feel more upscale than down.\n\nThe center stack controls are within easy reach, and the whole system is easy to use. Kia’s UVO system affords even the most technologically impaired an opportunity to make things work. It allows you to use your voice to control pretty much everything in the car but your children. It seamlessly integrates your smartphone via Bluetooth and allows you to place calls hands-free or stream music.\n\nSeating is comfortable throughout, though it’s no surprise that the available third row, which is part of the EX V6 Premium Package ($3,400), can be cramped, and it can be tough to access it with child-safety seats installed in the second row. I was able to fit my two convertible seats in the second row, which left a small space between them that was big enough for my kindergartener, who tried to squeeze in without his booster seat (for shame!). When said kindergartner was properly placed in his booster seat in the third row, his short legs had just enough room to stretch out. I can’t say the same for my husband when he sat back there.\n\nThere are plenty of clever storage options in this seven-seater such as a cubby beneath the center stack for a cellphone and some wipes or snacks and toys. There are netted seatback pockets for second-row passengers, small door pockets and two little bins on either side of the third row. There are five cupholders and four in-door bottleholders.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair/Ample\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2013 Kia Sorento has been named a Top Safety Pick, the second highest award, by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. This means that it got the highest score of Good in front-, side-impact, rear and roof-strength crash tests. It hasn’t undergone the newest small overlap front crash test. It also earned an overall safety rating of four stars of five from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. It received four stars of five in front and rollover crash tests and five stars in the side-impact crash test.\n\nThere are two sets of lower Latch anchors in the second row’s outboard seats, and they’re easy to access between the back and bottom cushions. There are three top tether anchors midway down the second-row seatbacks. However, there are no tether or Latch anchors in the optional third row. Find out how the Sorento fared in Cars.com’s Car Seat Check.\n\nThe Sorento EX has standard front-wheel drive, four-wheel-disc antilock brakes with brake assist, hill descent control, an electronic stability system with traction control, active front head restraints, a backup camera with rear parking sensors, and six airbags, including side curtains for the first and second rows. However, it does not include side curtain airbags for the optional third row, which means that anyone in that row goes without. I don’t mean to suggest that this is a deal breaker, but it is something to be aware of, particularly if you’re planning to use the third row regularly.\n\nAll-wheel drive is optional.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2013 Kia Sorento.",

      "expert_review": "With the buzz surrounding Kia and its redesigns, I was excited to climb out of my comfortable minivan and fall in love with the budget-friendly 2012 Kia Sorento. Unfortunately, it just didn’t happen.\n\nI wasn’t impressed by the 2012 Kia Sorento’s quality of finishes, the way it drove or the space the three-row crossover provided.\n\nWhen I’m test-driving cars, my Toyota Prius and Toyota Sienna normally collect cobwebs. Whatever shiny, tech-laden test car I’m driving gets all the love from my two munchkins (and husband). A tear is shed when they see it go and we are left to climb back into our boring cars.\n\nHowever, that wasn’t the case during the week I drove the Sorento. While the crossover had the tech features that my family appreciates, we simply did not fit in it. The few times my family of four drove together in the Sorento, we found it torturous, with everyone clamoring (read: whining) for legroom. Needless to say, no tears were shed when it came time to turn in the Sorento and climb back into the minivan.\n\nMy midlevel Sorento EX with all-wheel drive had a new-for-2012 191-horsepower four-cylinder engine. It gave me a sufficient amount of power for merging onto California’s highways, but it wasn’t terribly impressive.\n\nThe 2012 Kia Sorento is budget-friendly with a starting MSRP of $22,050 (including an $800 destination charge). After adding leather, navigation and a useless third row, my EX came in at $30,550.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe Sorento’s conservative exterior isn’t exactly a head-turner, but it doesn’t scream “I have a jog-stroller in the trunk” either, which many parents may like. I appreciated its chrome accents and large, shiny grille. Kia made this easy-on-the-wallet SUV look like it wasn’t.\n\nStep-in height was what you would expect from a small SUV; it’s not quite as low and convenient as a sedan, but it’s at a helpful height for buckling up small ones in their child-safety seats.\n\nThe Sorento has an optional third row, but I’d save my money. It’s part of the Premium Plus Package that costs $3,800 and includes leather seats, heated front seats and a navigation system. The third row is ridiculously tiny, low to the ground and a waste of space. It eats up valuable cargo space, leaving a paltry 9.1 cubic feet of space. However when the third row is folded, the 37.0 cubic feet of cargo space is more than enough for a cart (or two) full of groceries.\n\nMy midlevel EX test car had a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine making 191 horsepower and paired with all-wheel drive. It gets an EPA-estimated 21/28 mpg city/highway and thankfully only requires regular unleaded gasoline. There’s also a smaller 175-hp, 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine that’s on lower level trims and paired with front-wheel drive; it gets 22/32 mpg. The available 276-hp, 3.5-liter V-6 gets 20/26 mpg with front-wheel drive.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Some\n\nINTERIOR\nAt first glance, the Sorento’s interior was quite stylish and eye-catching. I was smitten with the contrast stitching on the optional leather seats and the chrome-like trim around the gauges.\n\nOnce I closely checked out the interior, I was sorely disappointed in the quality of the finishes. With less than 7,000 miles on the three-row crossover, it looked completely beat up. The center stack’s controls were jammed and misaligned, as if they were about to pop off. It had me questioning how solid the car would be in the long run, especially when kids are involved.\n\nDespite my disappointment in the finish quality, I was pleased with the easy-to-use navigation system, and the stereo controls are laid out simply, making them a breeze to use while driving.\n\nWith only five cupholders, it appears that not even the Sorento’s designers believe that seven people can squeeze into this crossover. However, the number of storage pockets and cubbies was sufficient enough.\n\nWhen loaded with two child-safety seats in the second row, the Sorento is just too small. Even a forward-facing convertible seat ate up a ton of legroom. The rear-facing convertible seat ate up not only the second-row legroom but also the front passenger’s. Watching my husband try to fit anywhere in the car was comedic. I found myself wishing that the third row was tossed out and the second row was given a few more inches of space.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2012 Kia Sorento has been named a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. It received a top score of Good in front, side, rear and roof-strength crash tests. In crash tests by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the 2012 Sorento received an overall score of four stars of five. It earned four stars in front and rollover crash tests and five stars in side crash tests.\n\nThe Sorento has standard front-wheel drive, four-wheel-disc antilock brakes with brake assist, an electronic stability system with traction control, active front head restraints and six airbags. The side curtain airbags provide protection to first- and second-row occupants, but not those in the third row. All-wheel drive is optional.\n\nThere are two sets of Latch anchors in the Sorento’s second row. They are buried deeply in the seat bight, where the back and bottom cushions meet. It was a struggle to access them.\n\nThe third row appears to be a complete afterthought because not only is there no legroom, but there’s also a lack of Latch anchors and airbags. The seat belt buckles are somewhat floppy, making it difficult for children in booster seats to buckle themselves up.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Kia Sorento?\n\nThe Kia Sorento is a three-row mid-size SUV with seating for up to seven. The base powertrain is a 191-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine coupled to an eight-speed automatic transmission. Optional is a 281-hp turbocharged version of this engine, which pairs with an eight-speed dual-clutch automatic. The Sorento is also available with hybrid and plug-in hybrid powertrains. The hybrid employs a gas-electric powertrain with a turbo 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine that produces 227 hp and returns an EPA-estimated 36 mpg in combined city/highway driving with front-wheel drive and 34 mpg with all-wheel drive. Sitting atop the range, the Sorento Plug-in Hybrid comes standard with AWD; its 261-hp gas-electric powertrain uses a turbo 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine and has an EPA-estimated electric driving range of 32 miles on a full charge. \n\nIf toting around little ones is part of your daily routine, you can see how the Sorento scored in our Car Seat Check. The Sorento’s rivals include the Honda Passport, Hyundai Santa Fe, Subaru Ascent and Toyota Highlander.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Kia Sorento?\n\nFor 2025, the hybrid and PHEV Sorentos adopt the updates the regular-line Sorento received for 2024. These include refreshed styling, available dual 12.3-inch displays for the instrument panel and infotainment touchscreen, and wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity. The Sorento Plug-in Hybrid gains a more affordable and less well-equipped starting trim, the EX, in addition to the SX-Prestige trim that was the sole choice for 2024. The gas-only Sorento is carried over with no noteworthy changes. \n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Kia Sorento Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n12.3-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nWireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay connectivity\nFive USB ports\nSecond- and third-row bench seats\nAdaptive cruise control\nAutomatic emergency braking\nBlind spot warning \nRear cross-traffic alert\nLane departure steering assist\nRear automatic emergency braking  \n\nAvailable features include:\n\nPanoramic moonroof\nLeather upholstery \nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated second-row captain’s chairs\nHeated steering wheel\nDual-zone automatic climate control\nBose premium stereo\n12.3-inch digital gauge cluster\nWireless device charging\n360-degree camera system\nFront and rear parking sensors\nHands-free power liftgate\nShould I Buy the 2025 Kia Sorento?\n\nThe Sorento impresses with its cabin quality, a long roster of standard comfort and safety features, and bold exterior design. The hybrid and plug-in versions are more appealing, too, since they’ve gained the welcome updates the regular Sorento received previously. Compared with larger three-row rivals like the Chevrolet Traverse and Toyota Grand Highlander, the Sorento’s third row is tight and its cargo volume is stingy when the rear seats are occupied. Even so, many families might find the Sorento to be sized just right, offering the flexibility of a third row and more space all around than a compact SUV while being easier to park and maneuver than a larger three-row SUV would be.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The Kia Sorento is a jack-of-all-trades SUV that’s well-rounded in key areas, including safety features, comfort and technology.\n\nVersus the competition: The Sorento’s lack of a signature trait doesn’t hurt it; it’s as versatile an SUV as there is in this class, though it isn’t as roomy as some competitors.\n\nThe phrase “jack of all trades, master of none” is a good fit for the 2019 Kia Sorento. It doesn’t have a signature trait or even a single aspect in which it outdistances its competition, but that’s not to the Sorento’s detriment; its myriad strengths (and only one real weakness) give it a unique position in its class.\n\nThe Sorento gets a light update for 2019; the biggest change is a third row that’s now standard on all trim levels. There are also some styling updates on the outside, small tweaks to the interior and a new eight-speed automatic transmission paired with the optional V-6. Compare it with the 2018 model here.\n\nThere are still five trim levels: L, LX, EX, SX and SX Limited. Each sees a price increase for 2019, though the amount differs widely. The Sorento competes in a packed mid-size SUV class that includes the Chevrolet Traverse, Honda Pilot and our reigning class champion and Best of 2018 award winner, the Volkswagen Atlas. See them compared.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nI drove an SX Limited with the larger of the Sorento’s two available engines. The base engine is a 185-horsepower, 2.4-liter four-cylinder that’s mated to a six-speed automatic transmission; it’s standard on L and LX trims. The optional engine is more enticing: a 290-hp, 3.3-liter V-6 that makes 252 pounds-feet of torque and is mated to an eight-speed automatic. The V-6 is optional on the LX but standard on the EX and SX (it’s not offered on the L). Interestingly, front-wheel drive is standard on all trim levels regardless of engine, and all-wheel drive is an $1,800 option on all but the L.\n\nWith the V-6, the Sorento drives well enough to get out of its own way. It isn’t especially agile, but it pours on power easily and rarely feels taxed unless you really put your foot into it. The steering is too numb, but it thankfully avoids that over-assisted feeling you get from some electric power steering setups. It meshes well with the suspension to give the Sorento a comfortable ride and an easy driving experience — about all you can ask for in this class. It’s also got a surprisingly quiet cabin that’s nearly devoid of road, tire and wind noise. I didn’t get a chance to give the all-wheel drive a true off-road test, but a couple of launches with two of the wheels on gravel didn’t trip it up.\n\nFuel economy ratings have gone up for 2019, as the new eight-speed transmission helps add 2 mpg combined over last year’s V-6; it’s now EPA-rated at 19/26/22 mpg city/highway/combined with FWD and 19/24/21 mpg with AWD. The four-cylinder engine’s ratings have also improved, up 1 mpg combined over 2018 at 22/29/25 mpg with FWD and 21/26/23 mpg with AWD.\n\nEasy-to-Use Technology\n\nThe Sorento’s safety and multimedia technology don’t break any new ground, but I’m a fan of their intuitive and easy-to-use execution.\n\nThe multimedia system has standard Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, and there are no weird controllers or strange menus, just a straightforward presentation and quick-responding touchscreen that’s an easy reach from both front seats.\n\nThe safety features can be turned on and off via easily reached controls, or modified via a menu in the instrument panel. Operation was very straightforward; I tested the adaptive cruise control and lane keep assist on the highway, and both worked as advertised.\n\nThere are also plenty of helpful charging options. Everything above the base trim level comes with at least three USB ports, and the SX comes with a 110-volt household outlet in the second row (along with a 12-volt outlet for good measure). There’s a wireless smartphone charging pad up front to boot.\n\nNice Interior With Third-Row and Cargo Woes\n\nThe Sorento’s first two rows of seats are what you’d expect from a mid-size SUV: spacious, with plenty of legroom and headroom even for taller occupants. Materials quality pleasantly surprised me in a top-of-the-line SX Limited, where the fit and finish and cabin materials would have fit in for a vehicle with an even higher price tag. The interior uses a lot of black, though, which gives it a slightly Darth Vader-esque feel.\n\nIf the Sorento has a shortcoming, it’s a third row that could be a deal-breaker for shoppers who intend to use it frequently. Simply put, it lacks the space of larger competitors like the Atlas and Traverse. Those two vehicles in particular have expansive third rows that put this one to shame. The argument for the Kia’s smaller dimensions is that it makes it more city-friendly and easier to park; it’s 9.3 inches shorter from bumper to bumper than the Atlas and 15.3 inches shorter than the Traverse.\n\nThe Sorento’s smaller size also puts it at a disadvantage when it comes to cargo room, with just 11.3/38.0/73.0 cubic feet of space behind the third/second/front rows, respectively. That’s much less than the Traverse (23.0/57.8/98.2 cubic feet) and Atlas (20.6/55.5/96.8).\n\nValue Star\n\nOne area where the Sorento really shines is value, and that holds true at both the bottom and top trims. The L starts at $27,335, which is only a $445 increase over the 2018 and a small price to pay for the newly standard third row (see a more detailed breakdown of each trim level’s price changes here). That undercuts all the competitors mentioned above by nearly $4,000, though the Traverse and Pilot both have standard V-6 engines.\n\nMy SX Limited test vehicle stickered at $48,370 with some dealer-installed options, and it was luxurious enough that I’d stack it up against the top trims of the same competitors. Even at that level, it undercuts the price of the Traverse by nearly $7,000, the Atlas by almost $2,000 and the Pilot by $1,500. It’s also worth noting (as with all Kias) the Sorento’s robust powertrain warranty: 10 years/100,000 miles — still tied for the best in the industry.\n\nThe 2019 Sorento’s well-roundedness works to its benefit; I found it to be a thoroughly easy-to-use and easy-to-like family vehicle.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in April 2015 about the 2016 Sorento, but little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2017, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years. \n\nWhen shopping for a large family vehicle, you have more options than there are germs in a preschool classroom, from two- or three-row SUVs to what’s likely the subject of many marital counseling sessions: the love-it-or-hate-it minivan. Kia’s newest SUV blends attributes of all these with versatile seating for five or seven, a generous cargo area and plenty of creature comforts for carpooling, road trips and everything in between.\n\nFor 2016, the Sorento is bigger, has a revised control layout and a new, optional turbocharged four-cylinder engine. Like its predecessor, the new Sorento is available with standard seating for five, and it can seat seven with an optional third row; compare the 2015 and 2016 models here.\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nWhen Kia’s first car hit the U.S. market in 1993, style was not on the brand’s radar; the Sephia didn’t have much going for it aside from a rock-bottom price. Twenty-two years later, the automaker has arguably one of the best-looking lineups in the industry, with the eye-catching Sorento in the flagship SUV spot.\n\nThe SUV’s new face is dramatic, with an upright, studded grille; available quad-LED fog lights; and sweeping LED-accented headlights. Sculpted body sides add some muscle to its profile. The brand’s newly redesigned minivan wears the same styling (actually, from the front, it’s hard to tell the Sedona from the Sorento), giving both vehicles a commanding presence.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nPower from the new, optional turbocharged 2.0-liter is surprisingly robust once you get past a minor acceleration delay, aka turbo lag. Even loaded with adults, it never felt strained around town or on the highway. The 240-horsepower four-cylinder is EPA-rated at 20/27/23 mpg city/highway/combined with front-wheel drive, good for a vehicle this size but down from the standard 185-hp, 2.4-liter four-cylinder’s 21/29/24 mpg rating. The Ford Edge with its turbocharged 2.0-liter is rated a touch higher at 20/30/24 mpg.\n\nThere’s a third engine choice, an optional 290-hp, 3.3-liter V-6 that’s rated 18/26/21 mpg, lower than the Nissan Murano’s 3.5-liter V-6 (21/28/24 mpg) but a touch higher than the Jeep Grand Cherokee with its 3.6-liter V-6 (17/25/20 mpg).\n\nFront-wheel drive is standard and all-wheel drive is optional on all Sorento models except the base L. All the engines team with a six-speed automatic transmission, the performance of which is hit or miss. A standard selectable drive mode system alters power steering assist, shift points and acceleration response. In Sport mode, transmission upshifts were abrupt and harsh, and the accelerator pedal was too touchy. Eco mode goes in the other direction entirely: Plunge the pedal and the needle barely moves; it’s lethargic both in overall acceleration and transmission responsiveness. The default is Normal mode, which should be called “Comfort”; everything felt just right in terms of responsiveness and smoothness.\n\nOn the highway, the cabin is impressively hushed. Wind and road noise are well-checked. The steering needs work, however. I found it light and imprecise, requiring too much correction, though other editors weren’t bothered by it. Sport mode supposedly firms it up, but the Sorento still exhibited a nonspecific feel in that mode.\n\nThe Sorento’s ride and handling have come a long way; this generation maintains better composure over bumps and takes corners with less lean. Maneuverability is also good around town; a tight turning circle makes it easier to park than several other vehicles of its size.\n\nInterior\n\nWhile the Sorento’s exterior is bold, the interior plays it a little too safe. The cabin’s materials feel pleasant, with plenty of soft, textured plastic on key touch points, but the design is nothing special. The black-on-black plastic theme in my test car was broken up by bits of matte chrome and glossy black paneling, but the overall look was uninteresting. The lone premium touches in my upscale SXL test model were optional patterned leather seats; they look and feel high-end and are very long, making for good thigh support. Juice-box-proof stain-resistant fabric from YES Essentials is the standard upholstery.\n\nOverall, passenger comfort is exceptional, with plenty of headroom and legroom in the two front rows. The Sorento comes standard with a second-row bench; captain’s chairs are not available. My test model didn’t have the optional third row, so my family of five couldn’t fit because three car seats do not fit across the second row. The Jeep Grand Cherokee can fit three, but the Nissan Murano can’t quite manage it. We have not yet tested the Ford Edge.\n\nI traveled with two adults in the back and they were very comfortable. The second row reclines quite a bit, and the outboard seatbacks and bottom cushions are bolstered for a cozy fit.\n\nThe Sorento really delivers in the features department, with plenty of optional creature comforts for both rows: heated and cooled front seats, a heated steering wheel, manual roll-up sunshades for the second-row windows, and plenty of first- and second-row connectivity options (USB port, auxiliary input jack, 115-volt outlet, 12-volt outlet). Heated second-row seats are an option my Sorento didn’t have, but my 5-year-old especially loved the available giant panoramic moonroof and very bright reading lights above the outboard seats.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nThe control layout is new this year, and audio and climate controls are grouped into separate planes. On top is the available UVO multimedia system’s 8-inch touch-screen. The system’s quick response time, large buttons and logical menu structure make short work of changing audio presets or inputting a navigation destination. Its swipe functionality has a natural, smartphone-like feel. I quickly and easily paired and connected my Android phone and launched Pandora internet radio. Two handy knobs separate the volume and station-tuning functions from the touch-screen. The climate controls are totally separate below the screen, and the large, clear buttons are ergonomically placed.\n\nUVO also includes some interesting services, like a parking minder and My Car Zone. With the former, the vehicle’s location is sent to your smartphone after you park. With the latter, parents can set curfew, location and speed limits for other (teen) drivers and get alerts if (when) those boundaries are breached.\n\nCargo & Storage\n\nThe cargo area is tall and wide, and the optional power-opening hatch adds convenience, automatically opening when you stand behind it with the key fob in your purse or pocket.\n\nBy the numbers, space behind the second row (38.8 cubic feet) is competitive with the Edge (39.2), Grand Cherokee (36.3) and Murano (39.6). The second row folds easily with the flip of a lever and is extra versatile thanks to its 40/20/40-split folding setup. Cargo volume jumps to 73.5 cubic feet with the seat folded, a tad more than competitors offer. In models so equipped, space behind the third row drops to an almost useless 11.3 cubic feet — much less than most three-row crossovers.\n\nAt first glance, the Sorento’s cargo area doesn’t look like anything special, but wait. In models without the third-row option, you can pop up the cargo floor to reveal a few different deep bins, great for organizing smaller loads and tucking valuables out of sight. The liners are made of plastic or dense foam, depending on the section, for easy containment of muddy shoes and wet bathing suits. The Sorento’s cargo-corralling features, from the underfloor storage system to its many tie-downs and grocery hooks, make it really tough to be messy.\n\nOther storage highlights include mesh-style map pockets on the seatbacks that expand to hold several items (I stashed a couple kid books and a tablet); a two-tier center storage console large enough to carry a compact purse; and a small bin, good for mobile devices, that’s handily located near the USB and auxiliary input outlets.\n\nSafety\n\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety named the 2016 Sorento a Top Safety Pick. It earned top scores in most tests, plus a basic rating for its forward collision warning system. IIHS has not yet tested the 2015 Nissan Murano or the 2015 Ford Edge. The 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee earned a marginal score in the agency’s small-overlap frontal test, disqualifying it from Top Safety Pick status. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has not yet tested the 2016 Sorento.\n\nInstalling two child-safety seats in the Sorento’s second row was easy thanks to plenty of room and accessible Latch anchors; for details, see our Sorento Car Seat Check.\n\nThe Sorento has six standard airbags, but its side curtain airbags cover only the first two rows of seats — a disappointment especially in a fully redesigned model. A backup camera is standard on all models except the base L; an Around View Monitor camera system is optional on the top SX Limited trim. This standout feature displays multiple-angle views and parking guidelines, handy for parallel-parking maneuvers and backing up in a crowded parking lot.\n\nA blind spot warning system and rear cross-traffic alert system are optional on midlevel versions and standard on higher trims. Forward collision warning and lane departure warning systems are also optional on the SX Limited but unavailable on other trims. You can see all the Sorento’s safety features here.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nThe Kia Sorento is the value leader in the segment, with a base price ($25,795) that’s well below the Edge ($28,995), Grand Cherokee ($30,990) and Murano ($30,445), though the latter two have standard V-6 engines; all prices include destination charges.\n\nWith the 2016 Sorento, you don’t have to sacrifice style, safety or comfort for affordability. Aside from some minor on-road refinement issues, it delivers everything a family could want and need in an SUV.",

      "expert_review": "When shopping for a large family vehicle, you have more options than there are germs in a preschool classroom, from two- or three-row SUVs to what’s likely the subject of many marital counseling sessions: the love-it-or-hate-it minivan. Kia’s newest SUV blends attributes of all these with versatile seating for five or seven, a generous cargo area and plenty of creature comforts for carpooling, road trips and everything in between.\n\nThe 2016 Kia Sorento is an all-star family-hauler with standout styling and a comfortable, feature-filled cabin; pleasant road manners are marred by minor imperfections.\n\nFor 2016, the Sorento is bigger, has a revised control layout and a new, optional turbocharged four-cylinder engine. Like its predecessor, the new Sorento is available with standard seating for five, and it can seat seven with an optional third row; compare the 2015 and 2016 models here.\n\nThe Sorento competes against two-row SUVs like the Ford Edge, Nissan Murano and Jeep Grand Cherokee; compare all four here. If you want a third row, compare the Sorento instead with the Chevrolet Traverse and Honda Pilot, though the Kia is smaller than those models.\n\nExterior & Styling\nWhen Kia’s first car hit the U.S. market in 1993, style was not on the brand’s radar; the Sephia didn’t have much going for it aside from a rock-bottom price. Twenty-two years later, the automaker has arguably one of the best-looking lineups in the industry, with the eye-catching Sorento in the flagship SUV spot.\n\nThe SUV’s new face is dramatic, with an upright, studded grille; available quad-LED fog lights; and sweeping LED-accented headlights. Sculpted body sides add some muscle to its profile. The brand’s newly redesigned minivan wears the same styling (actually, from the front, it’s hard to tell the Sedona from the Sorento), giving both vehicles a commanding presence.\n\nHow It Drives\nPower from the new, optional turbocharged 2.0-liter is surprisingly robust once you get past a minor acceleration delay, aka turbo lag. Even loaded with adults, it never felt strained around town or on the highway. The 240-horsepower four-cylinder is EPA-rated at 20/27/23 mpg city/highway/combined with front-wheel drive, good for a vehicle this size but down from the standard 185-hp, 2.4-liter four-cylinder’s 21/29/24 mpg rating. The Ford Edge with its turbocharged 2.0-liter is rated a touch higher at 20/30/24 mpg.\n\nThere’s a third engine choice, an optional 290-hp, 3.3-liter V-6 that’s rated 18/26/21 mpg, lower than the Nissan Murano’s 3.5-liter V-6 (21/28/24 mpg) but a touch higher than the Jeep Grand Cherokee with its 3.6-liter V-6 (17/25/20 mpg).\n\nFront-wheel drive is standard and all-wheel drive is optional on all Sorento models except the base L. All the engines team with a six-speed automatic transmission, the performance of which is hit or miss. A standard selectable drive mode system alters power steering assist, shift points and acceleration response. In Sport mode, transmission upshifts were abrupt and harsh, and the accelerator pedal was too touchy. Eco mode goes in the other direction entirely: Plunge the pedal and the needle barely moves; it’s lethargic both in overall acceleration and transmission responsiveness. The default is Normal mode, which should be called “Comfort”; everything felt just right in terms of responsiveness and smoothness.\n\nOn the highway, the cabin is impressively hushed. Wind and road noise are well-checked. The steering needs work, however. I found it light and imprecise, requiring too much correction, though other editors weren’t bothered by it. Sport mode supposedly firms it up, but the Sorento still exhibited a nonspecific feel in that mode.\n\nThe Sorento’s ride and handling have come a long way; this generation maintains better composure over bumps and takes corners with less lean. Maneuverability is also good around town; a tight turning circle makes it easier to park than several other vehicles of its size.\n\nInterior\nWhile the Sorento’s exterior is bold, the interior plays it a little too safe. The cabin’s materials feel pleasant, with plenty of soft, textured plastic on key touch points, but the design is nothing special. The black-on-black plastic theme in my test car was broken up by bits of matte chrome and glossy black paneling, but the overall look was uninteresting. The lone premium touches in my upscale SXL test model were optional patterned leather seats; they look and feel high-end and are very long, making for good thigh support. Juice-box-proof stain-resistant fabric from YES Essentials is the standard upholstery.\n\nOverall, passenger comfort is exceptional, with plenty of headroom and legroom in the two front rows. The Sorento comes standard with a second-row bench; captain’s chairs are not available. My test model didn’t have the optional third row, so my family of five couldn’t fit because three car seats do not fit across the second row. The Jeep Grand Cherokee can fit three, but the Nissan Murano can’t quite manage it. We have not yet tested the Ford Edge.\n\nI traveled with two adults in the back and they were very comfortable. The second row reclines quite a bit, and the outboard seatbacks and bottom cushions are bolstered for a cozy fit.\n\nThe Sorento really delivers in the features department, with plenty of optional creature comforts for both rows: heated and cooled front seats, a heated steering wheel, manual roll-up sunshades for the second-row windows, and plenty of first- and second-row connectivity options (USB port, auxiliary input jack, 115-volt outlet, 12-volt outlet). Heated second-row seats are an option my Sorento didn’t have, but my 5-year-old especially loved the available giant panoramic moonroof and very bright reading lights above the outboard seats.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe control layout is new this year, and audio and climate controls are grouped into separate planes. On top is the available UVO multimedia system’s 8-inch touch-screen. The system’s quick response time, large buttons and logical menu structure make short work of changing audio presets or inputting a navigation destination. Its swipe functionality has a natural, smartphone-like feel. I quickly and easily paired and connected my Android phone and launched Pandora internet radio. Two handy knobs separate the volume and station-tuning functions from the touch-screen. The climate controls are totally separate below the screen, and the large, clear buttons are ergonomically placed.\n\nUVO also includes some interesting services, like a parking minder and My Car Zone. With the former, the vehicle’s location is sent to your smartphone after you park. With the latter, parents can set curfew, location and speed limits for other (teen) drivers and get alerts if (when) those boundaries are breached.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe cargo area is tall and wide, and the optional power-opening hatch adds convenience, automatically opening when you stand behind it with the key fob in your purse or pocket.\n\nBy the numbers, space behind the second row (38.8 cubic feet) is competitive with the Edge (39.2), Grand Cherokee (36.3) and Murano (39.6). The second row folds easily with the flip of a lever and is extra versatile thanks to its 40/20/40-split folding setup. Cargo volume jumps to 73.5 cubic feet with the seat folded, a tad more than competitors offer. In models so equipped, space behind the third row drops to an almost useless 11.3 cubic feet — much less than most three-row crossovers.\n\nAt first glance, the Sorento’s cargo area doesn’t look like anything special, but wait. In models without the third-row option, you can pop up the cargo floor to reveal a few different deep bins, great for organizing smaller loads and tucking valuables out of sight. The liners are made of plastic or dense foam, depending on the section, for easy containment of muddy shoes and wet bathing suits. The Sorento’s cargo-corralling features, from the underfloor storage system to its many tie-downs and grocery hooks, make it really tough to be messy.\n\nOther storage highlights include mesh-style map pockets on the seatbacks that expand to hold several items (I stashed a couple kid books and a tablet); a two-tier center storage console large enough to carry a compact purse; and a small bin, good for mobile devices, that’s handily located near the USB and auxiliary input outlets.\n\nSafety\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety named the 2016 Sorento a Top Safety Pick. It earned top scores in most tests, plus a basic rating for its forward collision warning system. IIHS has not yet tested the 2015 Nissan Murano or the 2015 Ford Edge. The 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee earned a marginal score in the agency’s small-overlap frontal test, disqualifying it from Top Safety Pick status. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has not yet tested the 2016 Sorento.\n\nInstalling two child-safety seats in the Sorento’s second row was easy thanks to plenty of room and accessible Latch anchors; for details, see our Sorento Car Seat Check.\n\nThe Sorento has six standard airbags, but its side curtain airbags cover only the first two rows of seats — a disappointment especially in a fully redesigned model. A backup camera is standard on all models except the base L; an Around View Monitor camera system is optional on the top SX Limited trim. This standout feature displays multiple-angle views and parking guidelines, handy for parallel-parking maneuvers and backing up in a crowded parking lot.\n\nA blind spot warning system and rear cross-traffic alert system are optional on midlevel versions and standard on higher trims. Forward collision warning and lane departure warning systems are also optional on the SX Limited but unavailable on other trims. You can see all the Sorento’s safety features here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe Kia Sorento is the value leader in the segment, with a base price ($25,795) that’s well below the Edge ($28,995), Grand Cherokee ($30,990) and Murano ($30,445), though the latter two have standard V-6 engines; all prices include destination charges.\n\nWith the 2016 Sorento, you don’t have to sacrifice style, safety or comfort for affordability. Aside from some minor on-road refinement issues, it delivers everything a family could want and need in an SUV.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The Kia Sorento is a jack-of-all-trades SUV that’s well-rounded in key areas, including safety features, comfort and technology.\n\nVersus the competition: The Sorento’s lack of a signature trait doesn’t hurt it; it’s as versatile an SUV as there is in this class, though it isn’t as roomy as some competitors.\n\nThe phrase “jack of all trades, master of none” is a good fit for the 2019 Kia Sorento. It doesn’t have a signature trait or even a single aspect in which it outdistances its competition, but that’s not to the Sorento’s detriment; its myriad strengths (and only one real weakness) give it a unique position in its class.\n\nThe Sorento gets a light update for 2019; the biggest change is a third row that’s now standard on all trim levels. There are also some styling updates on the outside, small tweaks to the interior and a new eight-speed automatic transmission paired with the optional V-6. Compare it with the 2018 model here.\n\nThere are still five trim levels: L, LX, EX, SX and SX Limited. Each sees a price increase for 2019, though the amount differs widely. The Sorento competes in a packed mid-size SUV class that includes the Chevrolet Traverse, Honda Pilot and our reigning class champion and Best of 2018 award winner, the Volkswagen Atlas. See them compared.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nI drove an SX Limited with the larger of the Sorento’s two available engines. The base engine is a 185-horsepower, 2.4-liter four-cylinder that’s mated to a six-speed automatic transmission; it’s standard on L and LX trims. The optional engine is more enticing: a 290-hp, 3.3-liter V-6 that makes 252 pounds-feet of torque and is mated to an eight-speed automatic. The V-6 is optional on the LX but standard on the EX and SX (it’s not offered on the L). Interestingly, front-wheel drive is standard on all trim levels regardless of engine, and all-wheel drive is an $1,800 option on all but the L.\n\nWith the V-6, the Sorento drives well enough to get out of its own way. It isn’t especially agile, but it pours on power easily and rarely feels taxed unless you really put your foot into it. The steering is too numb, but it thankfully avoids that over-assisted feeling you get from some electric power steering setups. It meshes well with the suspension to give the Sorento a comfortable ride and an easy driving experience — about all you can ask for in this class. It’s also got a surprisingly quiet cabin that’s nearly devoid of road, tire and wind noise. I didn’t get a chance to give the all-wheel drive a true off-road test, but a couple of launches with two of the wheels on gravel didn’t trip it up.\n\nFuel economy ratings have gone up for 2019, as the new eight-speed transmission helps add 2 mpg combined over last year’s V-6; it’s now EPA-rated at 19/26/22 mpg city/highway/combined with FWD and 19/24/21 mpg with AWD. The four-cylinder engine’s ratings have also improved, up 1 mpg combined over 2018 at 22/29/25 mpg with FWD and 21/26/23 mpg with AWD.\n\nEasy-to-Use Technology\n\nThe Sorento’s safety and multimedia technology don’t break any new ground, but I’m a fan of their intuitive and easy-to-use execution.\n\nThe multimedia system has standard Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, and there are no weird controllers or strange menus, just a straightforward presentation and quick-responding touchscreen that’s an easy reach from both front seats.\n\nThe safety features can be turned on and off via easily reached controls, or modified via a menu in the instrument panel. Operation was very straightforward; I tested the adaptive cruise control and lane keep assist on the highway, and both worked as advertised.\n\nThere are also plenty of helpful charging options. Everything above the base trim level comes with at least three USB ports, and the SX comes with a 110-volt household outlet in the second row (along with a 12-volt outlet for good measure). There’s a wireless smartphone charging pad up front to boot.\n\nNice Interior With Third-Row and Cargo Woes\n\nThe Sorento’s first two rows of seats are what you’d expect from a mid-size SUV: spacious, with plenty of legroom and headroom even for taller occupants. Materials quality pleasantly surprised me in a top-of-the-line SX Limited, where the fit and finish and cabin materials would have fit in for a vehicle with an even higher price tag. The interior uses a lot of black, though, which gives it a slightly Darth Vader-esque feel.\n\nIf the Sorento has a shortcoming, it’s a third row that could be a deal-breaker for shoppers who intend to use it frequently. Simply put, it lacks the space of larger competitors like the Atlas and Traverse. Those two vehicles in particular have expansive third rows that put this one to shame. The argument for the Kia’s smaller dimensions is that it makes it more city-friendly and easier to park; it’s 9.3 inches shorter from bumper to bumper than the Atlas and 15.3 inches shorter than the Traverse.\n\nThe Sorento’s smaller size also puts it at a disadvantage when it comes to cargo room, with just 11.3/38.0/73.0 cubic feet of space behind the third/second/front rows, respectively. That’s much less than the Traverse (23.0/57.8/98.2 cubic feet) and Atlas (20.6/55.5/96.8).\n\nValue Star\n\nOne area where the Sorento really shines is value, and that holds true at both the bottom and top trims. The L starts at $27,335, which is only a $445 increase over the 2018 and a small price to pay for the newly standard third row (see a more detailed breakdown of each trim level’s price changes here). That undercuts all the competitors mentioned above by nearly $4,000, though the Traverse and Pilot both have standard V-6 engines.\n\nMy SX Limited test vehicle stickered at $48,370 with some dealer-installed options, and it was luxurious enough that I’d stack it up against the top trims of the same competitors. Even at that level, it undercuts the price of the Traverse by nearly $7,000, the Atlas by almost $2,000 and the Pilot by $1,500. It’s also worth noting (as with all Kias) the Sorento’s robust powertrain warranty: 10 years/100,000 miles — still tied for the best in the industry.\n\nThe 2019 Sorento’s well-roundedness works to its benefit; I found it to be a thoroughly easy-to-use and easy-to-like family vehicle.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
