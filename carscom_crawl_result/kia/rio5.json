      "expert_review": "Just in time to give consumers more choices of fuel-efficient cars as gasoline prices continue to spike, Kia has brought us the redesigned Rio subcompacts for 2006. There are two models offered – the Rio sedan and the Rio5 hatchback/wagon, and both are value-priced and easy on the gas.\n\nFor 2006, the Rio line received a complete redesign, so the cars are up to date and better than ever. It’s the second generation of the Rio, which arrived initially for 2001 in just the sedan form; the wagon was added for 2004, and initially was called the Rio Cinco. But because most Americans had no idea that “cinco” was the word for “five” in Spanish, and therefore didn’t understand the idea that the Rio Cinco was a five-door model of the car, the name this year has been simplified to Rio5.\n\nWith the redesign, the Rio models for 2006 have roomier interiors, more standard features, more power, and slightly higher base prices.\n\nDon’t panic about the price increases, though. They’re really negligible.\n\nThe Rio already was among the cheapest sedans on the market, which was its claim to fame from the start. This year, the new base price is just $11,110, up just $720 from last year.\n\nBut that’s really not an unfair price increase, considering the extras that have been added to the base model with the redesign. Among standard features for 2006 are six air bags, including dual front and front seat-mounted side air bags, and full-length side-curtain air bags. Most vehicles in this class either don’t offer side-curtain air bags, or offer them only as an extra-cost option if they are even available.\n\nThe side-curtain bags, which are included in the base prices of all Rio sedans and the Rio5 wagon, make the Rio the lowest-priced car in the United States to have this feature as standard equipment.\n\nAt the start, when the Rio came to market in mid-2000, its customers mostly were young, first-time car buyers who could purchase a new Rio for less than they would have had to pay for a larger 2- or 3-year-old Honda Civic or Toyota Corolla.\n\nAnd despite some early quality problems, a combination of improvements to the vehicles and a 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty have boosted the vehicles’ reputation in the marketplace.\n\nThe change was dramatic enough to earn the new Rio/Rio5 a tie for a prestigious first place in the subcompact class in the 2006 J.D. Power Initial Quality Study. The study measures owners’ experiences with new vehicles during the first 90 days after purchase. The Rio tied with the Suzuki Aerio.\n\nThat seems to suggest that the Rio might come close to the long-term reliability of a Honda, Toyota, Mazda, Nissan or even Hyundai product.\n\nStill, though, the Rio’s popularity is mostly attributed to its low price and economy of operation, which continue to be hallmarks of the vehicle.\n\nEPA fuel-economy estimates are 32 miles per gallon in the city and 35 mpg on the highway for the five-speed manual-transmission versions, and 29 city/38 highway with the four-speed automatic.\n\nThat’s an impressive increase over the previous generation of the Rio, whose ratings were 26 city/33 highway for manual-gearbox models, and 25/32 for automatics.\n\nThe boost in fuel economy came with an increase in horsepower, as well. The 1.6-liter inline four-cylinder engine that comes in all Rio models now has 110 horsepower, up from 104 for 2005. Torque was increased slightly as well – to 107 foot-pounds from 104. Inside, passengers have more space than before, giving the Rio best-in-class roominess. The similar Hyundai Accent and Chevrolet Aveo, both also products of South Korea, have 92 and 91 cubic feet of interior volume respectively, compared with 92.2 for the Rio sedan.\n\nThe Rio5 also has 92.2 cubic feet of space, which puts it ahead of the Aveo five-door, with 91 cubic feet, and the Scion xA, with 86. The interior space also is more than that of the longer and more-expensive Civic and Corolla.\n\nThe ’06 Rio sedan is 1.2 inches taller and 0.6 inch wider than last year’s model, with a wheelbase of 98.4 inches, up from 94.9 inches. Surprisingly, though, the overall length of the sedan remains the same: 166.9 inches.\n\nThe Rio5 is 8.7 inches shorter than the sedan and the previous Cinco model, but has more interior space than the ’05 model. The difference in length between the sedan and five-door comes from squaring off the rear end of the sedan, where the trunk is, to create the wagon shape and add the fifth door. The increased height from the higher rear end of the wagon adds back the interior volume lost by shortening the vehicle.\n\nThese cars are basic econoboxes meant to be affordable transportation, not sports sedans or wagons. Yet they offer handling and performance similar to what one would find in some more-expensive basic-transportation vehicles, including the Ford Focus and now-discontinued Dodge Neon.\n\nHelping with the fuel economy is the light weight of the Rios. They’re both under 2,500 pounds, which allows the engine to seem to have more power than it does. The lighter the vehicle, the more-efficient the engine will be with the same horsepower.\n\nSedan models are offered in two trim levels, Base ($11,110) and LX ($12,985). Only one trim is offered in the wagon, the SX ($14,040). All three prices include $540 freight.\n\nThe cars actually look more expensive than they are. Kia said their styling was “European-inspired.” The headlights are swept back, and the front includes a new black-mesh grille. Black moldings run along the doors, and there are similar black inserts on the bumpers.\n\nThese vehicles are all new, down to the chassis. Virtually nothing carried over from the previous generation.\n\nA complaint with the previous sedan was its small trunk, but for 2006, trunk space is 11.9 cubic feet, an increase of 29 percent.\n\nThe Rio5 can be called a hatchback or a wagon (hatchback seems to resonate better with American consumers, who don’t like to drive anything called a “wagon”), but the vehicle’s cargo space is more wagonlike at 15.8 cubic feet. In comparison, the Aveo five-door has just 7.1 cubic feet or cargo space, and the xA just 11.7. With the rear seat folded, the Rio5 has 49.6 cubic feet of cargo room, compared with 42 in the Aveo and 33 in the xA.\n\nInside, the cars seem more expensive than they are, with such features as mesh fabric upholstery, an eight-way manually adjustable driver’s seat, and a fold-down armrest. Other features include cubbyholes for cell phones and MP3 players; a slot in the center instrument stack for parking passes or toll tickets; two 12-volt power outlets; and a grocery-bag hook on the back of the front passenger seat.\n\nPower front disc/rear drum brakes are standard, but four-wheel antilock disc brakes are optional on the LX sedan and the Rio5. The cars have a steel unibody – frame and body combined in one unit – that Kia says was “designed to minimize deformation of the passenger compartment in a collision.”\n\nThere is room for up to five people in these cars, and even tall people can fit in the front seat. Average-size adults fit easily in the rear seat, but it’s more comfortable for two than three.\n\nKia said the engine is all new, and features double-overhead cams and continuously variable valve timing. The improved fuel economy gives the cars a maximum range of about 450 miles, up from 370 last year, if the EPA estimates are accurate.\n\nThe five-speed manual transmission is standard on all models; an electronically controlled four-speed automatic is optional only on the LX sedan and the wagon. LX sedans come with air conditioning, AM/FM/CD audio system, power/tilt steering wheel, and a 60/40-split folding rear seat.\n\nWagons have all of the features of the LX model, plus 15-inch alloy wheels, fog lights, rear spoiler, leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, metal-grain interior trim, and metal pedals.\n\nBesides the automatic transmission and upgraded brakes, options for the LX and Rio5 include a power package that adds power windows, power door locks with keyless entry, power/heated mirrors, and tweeter speakers for the audio system.\n\nKia, a subsidiary of South Korea’s Hyundai, offers the same warranty found on Hyundai vehicles. It includes five years/60,000 miles bumper-to-bumper; 10 years/100,000 miles on the powertrain; and five years or 60,000 miles of roadside assistance.\n\nQuick facts: 2006 Kia Rio/Rio5\n\nThe basics: South Korean automaker Kia has completely redesigned its subcompact Rio sedan and wagon for 2006, and renamed the wagon the Rio5 (it was the Cinco before). These cars now are roomier, slightly more powerful and have better fuel economy.\n\nThe powertrain: The only engine used is a new 1.6-liter inline four-cylinder with double-overhead cam and variable valve timing, rated at 110 horsepower and 107 foot-pounds of torque. A five-speed manual is standard, and a four-speed automatic is optional.\n\nGas mileage: EPA ratings are 29 miles per gallon city/38 highway for the automatic models, and 32 city/35 highway for manual-gearbox versions. What they cost: Sedans begin at $11,110 and wagons at $14,040, including freight. The uplevel LX sedan is $12,985.\n\nAccolades: The new Rio tied for first place among subcompact cars in the 2006 J.D. Power Initial Quality Study, which measures problems incurred during the first 90 days of ownership.\n\nG.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nUpdates for the 2007 Kia Rio5 hatchback include new wheels and some light interior changes. Overall, it’s virtually the same as the 2006 model.\n\nBoth a sedan and a Rio Cinco wagon were offered in the prior Rio generation. For 2006, a Rio5 hatchback became available in addition to the redesigned Rio sedan, which is listed separately in the Cars.com Research section. Available only in SX trim, the Rio5 comes standard with side-impact and side curtain airbags.\n\nExterior\nCreated with a European-inspired exterior, the Rio5 features a black mesh grille and swept-back headlights. Black side moldings are installed, and the bumpers contain black inserts. The wheel well openings have a sculpted design, and body-colored mirrors are installed.\n\nThe Rio5 has an independent front suspension and a semi-independent rear suspension. The hatchback features fog lamps, a rear spoiler, 15-inch alloy wheels and power steering. For 2007, 16-inch alloy wheels are optional.\n\nInterior\nUp to five people can fit inside the Rio5. Standard equipment includes an eight-way manually adjustable driver’s seat, variable intermittent wipers and a rear-window defroster. Additional features include air conditioning, a CD stereo with four speakers, a tilt steering column, and a 60/40-split, folding rear seat.\n\nFor 2007, all Rio5s gain upgraded seat fabric, dashboard chrome accents and red stitching on the steering wheel, shift knob and door panels.\n\nThe hatchback can hold 15.8 cubic feet of cargo behind the rear seat. With the seat folded, space increases to 49.6 cubic feet. An optional Power Package includes remote keyless entry and power windows, locks and mirrors.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Rio5’s 1.6-liter four-cylinder develops 110 horsepower and 107 pounds-feet of torque. Either a four-speed automatic or five-speed manual transmission can be installed.\n\nSafety\nSeat-mounted side-impact airbags, side curtain airbags and front seat belt pretensioners are standard. Antilock brakes are optional.\n\nDriving Impressions\nThe Rio5’s handling capabilities exceed expectations; it maneuvers eagerly through urban or rural environments, and its body rolls less than anticipated.\n\nBackseat space isn’t too appealing. Legroom even in the outer positions is marginal if the front seat is moved appreciably rearward. In addition, the hard rear seatback reclines too much for true comfort. Still, headroom is passable and foot space is adequate. Climbing into the backseat isn’t too difficult.\n\nDespite short seat bottoms, the front seats are rather comfortable. Cargo space in the Rio5 is less than bountiful, but visibility is unobstructed.",

The Rio5 is related to Kia’s Rio sedan, which is listed separately in the Cars.com Research section. The Rio5 comes in moderately equipped LX and sporty SX trim levels.

The SX adds new alloy wheels and a chrome exhaust outlet. Inside, there is an optional voice-activated Bluetooth capability and a second front power outlet (replacing the cigarette lighter). All models now have a tire pressure monitoring system and red-orange interior lighting, and those with an automatic transmission add an EcoMinder indicator that glows green to denote efficient driving.\n\nExterior\nCreated with a European-inspired exterior, the Rio5 features a black mesh grille and swept-back headlights. The wheel well openings have a sculpted design, and it’s equipped with body-colored mirrors.\n\nAvailable 14-, 15- or 16-inch wheels\nStandard auto-off headlights\nOptional power heated mirrors\nOptional rear spoiler and fog lamps\n\nInterior\nThe Rio5 can seat up to five and has a 60/40-split folding rear bench.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe Rio5 is Kia’s version of a sporty European hatchback. The Rio5 is related to Kia’s Rio sedan, which is listed separately in the Cars.com Research section. The Rio5 comes in moderately equipped LX and sporty SX trim levels. Kia’s Rio5 hatchback competes with other small hatchbacks, including the Chevrolet Aveo5, Honda Fit and Toyota Yaris.\n\nNew for 2009\nThe Rio5’s radio has been revised and now has Sirius Satellite Radio and MP3 compatibility; both trims get a USB jack for iPods. Some minor revisions were also made to the instrument and radio controls.\n\nExterior\nCreated with a European-inspired exterior, the Rio5 features a black mesh grille and swept-back headlights. The wheel well openings have a sculpted design, and its equipped with body-colored mirrors. The Rio5 is 158 inches long and 66.7 inches wide; its longer than the Yaris and Aveo5 but shorter than the Fit.\n\nAvailable 14-, 15- or 16-inch wheels\nStandard auto-off headlights\nOptional power heated mirrors\nRear spoiler and fog lamps (SX)\n\nInterior\nThe Rio5 can seat up to five and has a 60/40-split folding rear bench. The Rio5 SX has chrome dashboard accents and red stitching on the steering wheel, gearshift knob and door panels. A USB connector is now standard in both the LX and SX; redesigned gauge clusters for the radio and climate controls are also new.\n\nThe hatchback has 15.8 cubic feet of cargo space behind the rear seat. With the backseat folded, space increases to 49.6 cubic feet. The cargo area beats out the Yaris and Aveo5, but it’s less than the Fit’s.\n\nAvailable cloth or sports-cloth upholstery\nStandard air conditioning\nStandard Sirius Satellite Radio\nOptional power windows and locks and keyless entry\nOptional steering-wheel-mounted controls\nStandard leather-wrapped steering wheel/shifter and metal-finished pedals (SX)\n\nUnder the Hood\n\n\n110-horsepower, 1.6-liter inline-four-cylinder engine with 107 pounds-feet of torque\nAvailable five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission\nStandard speed-sensitive power steering\n\nSafety\nConsidering its price and its competitors’ offerings, the Rio comes fairly well equipped with safety features.\n\nStandard side-impact airbags\nStandard side curtain airbags\nStandard child-safety locks\nOptional antilock brakes with rear discs",

      "expert_review": "If gas prices keep up their startling price surge, this will be the car of the future. This type of car, anyway.\n\nYour average European driver already has settled into a teeny, economical hatchback, though that’s as much a function of narrow urban streets and parking-spot rarity as fuel costs.\n\nLike it or not, American drivers now are shedding their large SUVs and passenger cars for smaller, more efficient vehicles. But with such subcompacts as the Kia Rio5, that’s not so onerous.\n\nRio5 and some others in the latest crop of subcompacts offer a decent measure of drivability and refinement along with their fuel economy. Rio5 is a five-door hatchback that also adds cargo-carrying versatility to the mix, along with such hatches as Honda Fit, Suzuki SX4, Chevrolet Aveo 5, Nissan Versa and Scion xD.\n\nRio5 is a good-looking little craft with a nicely styled interior, which serves to demonstrate how far the South Korean company has come in just a few years, under ownership by industrial giant Hyundai. Other than the original Sportage SUV, which made lots of friends due to its cheeky styling, Kia products were fairly uninspiring before the infusion of Hyundai cash for product development.\n\nBased on the Rio sedan, Rio5 offers much of the sophistication of the Japanese subcompacts. Handling is nimble around town and gas mileage is good enough to keep you from going broke.\n\nStill, it’s a little bitty car and your backseat guests may be less than satisfied with the accommodations. For this extra-tall driver, legroom was tight though workable.\n\nKia Rio5 (say that three times fast) would make a good commuting car and grocery-getter for someone who wants to leave the big gas-guzzler at home, reserved for vacation trips and other special occasions.\n\nKia Rio5 SX\n\nVehicle type: Five-passenger four-door hatchback, front-wheel drive.\n\nEngine: 1.6-liter inline 4, 110 horsepower at 6,000 rpm, 107 pound-feet of torque at 4,500 rpm.\n\nTransmission: Five-speed manual.\n\nWheelbase: 98.4 inches.\n\nOverall length: 158.1 inches.\n\nCurb weight: 2,438 pounds.\n\nEPA rating: 27 city, 32 highway.\n\nHighs: Good drivability, nice styling, good gas mileage.\n\nLows: Chintzy interior parts, highway engine roar, antilock brakes cost extra.\n\nPERFORMANCE: For a 1.6-liter engine, the four-banger provides spunky response in urban driving. But at highway speeds, the small engine sets up a subdued roar that sounds like it’s working extra hard.The five-speed manual shifted smoothly, and I fear the Kia might be underpowered with an automatic.Gas mileage was better than advertised, about 30 mpg in mainly city driving.\n\nDRIVABILITY: Surprisingly fun to drive, Rio5 felt sporty in the corners and holds the road well. The steering and brakes are responsive.Rio5 comes with a high level of safety equipment, although antilock brakes cost an extra $400. That needs to be standard. The car comes with full-length, side-impact airbags as well as seat-belt pretensioners and force limiters.\n\nSTYLING: One of the nicer-looking subcompacts, Kia5 has a sporty stance. The optional alloy wheels helped.\n\nINTERIOR: Although Rio5’s cabin is nicely designed, with a good look to the dashboard and door panels, some of the hard-plastic material seemed cheap and less-than-durable. Already, some scratches were appearing on the upper-door surfaces of this low-mileage test car.The rear seat is tight, and if you expect to get three people back there, everybody had better be small. With the back seat folded, cargo space is expansive.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Though pricing starts at about $13,000, such niceties as power windows and mirrors and antilock brakes cost extra.\n\nBase price: $13,750.\n\nPrice as tested: $15,615.\n\nOPTIONS\n\nPower package, with power windows, mirrors, door locks and keyless remote, $600.\n\nAntilock brakes, $400.\n\nAlloy wheels, $200.\n\nFloor mats, $85.\n\nShipping, $580.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: Estimated mileage ratings have been lowered to reflect a November 2012 EPA audit of this car’s stated mileage.\n\nUp against elevated gas prices, car shoppers should take comfort in the fact they don’t have to pay a premium for a hybrid to save money at the pump. There’s a new crowd of subcompact and compact cars that are fuel-efficient, start below $15,000 and dispel some outdated notions about small cars. Available in sedan and four-door hatchback body styles, the 2012 Kia Rio is one of these cars. I tested the hatchback, which is called the 5-Door. The sedan is covered separately.\n\nWith its redesign, the 2012 Kia Rio 5-Door goes from basic transportation to a refined subcompact that’s appealing for more than just practical reasons.\n\nThe Rio 5-Door starts at $14,350 including a $750 destination charge, but our well-equipped SX trim level’s as-tested price was $20,745 and included upscale features like a navigation system and heated leather seats. To see how the Rio 5-Door’s specs compare with the Ford Fiesta, Chevrolet Sonic and Honda Fit, click here.\n\nStyling\nJust as it’s likely that a redesigned model will produce more horsepower than its predecessor, it’s also a safe bet that its styling will be more aggressive. The Rio 5-Door follows this trend, and the result is a small hatchback with the face of an angry dragonfly. Bulbous headlights border a pinched upper grille.\n\nFor a subcompact car, the Rio 5-Door has a great stance. While some of its competitors’ height is overly emphasized by a narrow track (the distance between left and right wheels), the Rio 5-Door looks wide by comparison. It’s not the widest car in this class, but it has one of the lower rooflines, contributing to its eye-pleasing proportions.\n\nFuel-Saving Features\nThe Rio 5-Door gets an EPA-estimated 29/37 mpg city/highway with the manual transmission and 28/36 mpg with the automatic. In addition to standard low-rolling-resistance tires and electrically assisted power steering, Kia also includes a selectable Active Eco mode on automatic-transmission models to squeeze more miles from each gallon of gas.\n\nWhen Active Eco is activated, the transmission upshifts sooner and downshifts later to keep engine rpm lower. It also tries to smooth gas pedal response. Although the system doesn’t lead to an official increase in the Rio 5-Door’s EPA gas mileage, Kia says Active Eco can improve fuel economy by up to 7 percent.\n\nFour-Cylinder Performance\nThere’s a downside to the Active Eco mode, and it’s a big one: Gas pedal responsiveness is severely diminished. It makes the car feel sluggish and takes away from the refined four-cylinder engine that powers this car.\n\nWith Active Eco turned off, a more accurate picture of the 1.6-liter four-cylinder emerges. It revs smoothly and offers adequate power. The six-speed automatic, which is optional on the LX and standard on the EX and SX, makes the engine look good, with quick kickdowns when you jab the gas pedal. At highway speeds, however, the four-cylinder’s passing power is pretty much exhausted.\n\nRide & Handling\nUnlike the other trim levels, the SX version is fitted with a sport suspension. Ride quality is taut and can be bouncy at times, but the car feels nicely planted, too. All versions of the Rio 5-Door have an independent front suspension and a semi-independent torsion-beam rear suspension. The electrically assisted power steering provides minimal steering feedback.\n\nCabin Roominess & Comfort\nFor a subcompact car, the Rio 5-Door feels relatively spacious up front. Unlike some of its competitors, you don’t feel like you’re crowding your front occupant’s personal space.\n\nUnfortunately, the front bucket seats compromise overall comfort. For one, the seat cushions are short. I’m 6-foot-1, so they didn’t provide enough thigh support, even though the legroom itself is good. Beyond that, the seats have a firm, boardlike feel that’s not conducive to comfort. Like other cars in this class, the Rio 5-Door’s backseat is tight for adults, as legroom is in short supply.\n\nUnexpected Amenities\nUpscale features are appearing in more new small cars, including the Rio 5-Door. Premium options include a navigation system with a 7-inch touch-screen and a backup camera, heated leather front seats, push-button start, power-folding side mirrors and Kia’s Uvo system for controlling cellphone features.\n\nSafety\nThe 2012 Rio 5-Door received a four-star (out of five) overall rating in National Highway Traffic Safety Administration crash testing, but its performance was marred by a Safety Concern warning in the side barrier crash test. In NHTSA tests, a Safety Concern highlights a situation that isn’t calculated into the star rating. While the Rio 5-Door received five stars for its overall side crash-test performance, in the side barrier test the rear door panel struck the backseat test dummy’s torso. This represents a higher likelihood of injury.\n\nThe Rio 5-Door has standard antilock brakes and an electronic stability system, features that are required on all new cars beginning with the 2012 model year. Additional standard features include side-impact airbags for the front seats, side curtain airbags and Vehicle Stability Management. Using the electric-assist power-steering system, VSM can make steering corrections to help the driver regain control in an emergency.\n\nFor a list of safety features check out the Features & Specs page, or to see how well child-safety seats fit in the Rio 5-Door see our Car Seat Check.\n\nRio 5-Door in the Market\nThe redesigned Rio 5-Door is a big step forward for the nameplate and is worth considering if you’re shopping for a subcompact. It follows a familiar path that Kia’s taken with other recent redesigns like the Optima sedan and Sorento crossover by offering a combination of standout design and value that’s too enticing to overlook.\n\nSend Mike an email",
