      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2022 Kia EV6 electric crossover is easy to live with and has advantages over its competitors in regard to how it drives and charges, but it comes with some potentially large caveats.\n\nVersus the competition: Few electric cars in this price range have the goods to qualify for the trite “Tesla-fighter” label, but the EV6 comes close.\n\nNo stranger to electric vehicles, Kia has been quietly selling them in the U.S. since the Soul EV debuted for the 2014 model year. The all-new 2022 Kia EV6 electric crossover gets the full-blown modern Kia treatment, injecting tons of design and technology into this next-generation EV.\n\nAs an EV, the EV6 is well done, with high efficiency ratings from the EPA for rear-wheel-drive versions (up to 117 mpg-equivalent combined), a driving range up to 310 miles and the ability to fast-charge at higher-powered Electrify America 350-kilowatt chargers — a feature lacking in many of its non-Tesla competitors. The EV6 also has numerous tricks up its sleeve that help it match up nicely with the Tesla Model Y, especially for buyers who don’t care for the Model Y’s minimalistic interior design or other polarizing attributes.\n\nRelated: Kia Debuts Tesla-Fighting EV6 Electric SUV With Up to Nearly 600 Horsepower\n\nI drove an EV6 GT-Line with a long-range battery, all-wheel drive and 274 miles of estimated range, with a price tag of $57,410 (including destination). For all its high points, however, there’s one thing about it that warrants extra attention from shoppers.\n\nTry Before You Buy\n\nI’m not an overly tall person (6 feet tall with long legs and a short torso), yet I was never completely comfortable driving the EV6 GT-Line because my head constantly brushed up against the headliner and the ceiling-mounted grab handle. It’s not that the EV6 is a small car; it’s a high-riding hatchback (essentially a crossover) with an aggressive coupelike design that splits the difference in height between Kia’s SUVs and sedans. The EV6 has the wheelbase of a three-row Kia Telluride, is longer than a Kia Sportage and is as wide as a Kia Sorento. It has more as-measured cargo space (in our testing) than a Nissan Rogue and EVs like the Volvo XC40 Recharge and Ford Mustang Mach-E.\n\n2022 Kia EV6 moonroof | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nWhat kills headroom in this car is the GT-Line’s standard moonroof, which cuts headroom to 36.8 inches. The roof is a traditional tilt-and-slide unit that opens wide, so it sits deeper than a panoramic glass roof that doesn’t open, like those in the related Hyundai Ioniq 5 Limited or the Tesla Model Y. The lower-priced EV6 trim levels, Light and Wind, skip the moonroof altogether, which Kia says opens up a significant 2.2 inches of headroom; I haven’t sat in those versions yet.\n\nAdding insult to injury in the GT-Line, the aggressively sloping rear roofline that defines the EV6’s stylized profile severely limits visibility over the shoulder and out the back window. Kia has provided some technological workarounds for the poor visibility, like available cameras that can display an image of either blind spot in the instrument panel when the associated turn signal is activated. There’s also a standard traditional blind spot monitoring system, but as manufacturers always remind drivers, you shouldn’t rely on those. I wasn’t the only editor on staff to complain about the lack of roominess; even shorter editors who drove the car said they felt “hemmed in.” Backseat passengers have it better, with 38 inches of headroom, and I had no trouble sitting in the back, so a lesser trim without the moonroof will likely have acceptable headroom.\n\n2022 Kia EV6 | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nSo what does that mean for you? If you’re considering buying an EV6, find one and sit in it. In today’s wild market of limited inventory and the proliferation of factory ordering, your local dealership might not have one to try, or you might overlook a test drive just to get an order in sooner. Don’t do that. Go find one at a regional auto show, rent one through a peer-to-peer service, or drive to the nearest dealership that has an actual EV6 available. One foible on the top trim level wouldn’t normally be worth so much attention, but in February — the first month in which the EV6 was on sale in notable quantities — the GT-Line made up 60% of the listings that moved through Cars.com’s national inventory. In March, the GT-Line made up 38% of EV6 listings.\n\nHow the EV6 Drives\n\nThe EV6 is a sweetheart to drive. It’s refreshing, given many similarly priced EVs have questionable ride quality and firmness. The EV6 should be a message to other automakers: It’s OK for a car to have aggressive looks but not feel aggressive to drive, especially if that means comfort is sacrificed. The EV6 and its Hyundai Ioniq 5 cousin share the same underlying global architecture, and both feel comfort-oriented compared with the aggressively tuned Model Y, which I still think is top of this class for driving engagement and handling but bottom of the class for ride-firmness-induced discomfort.\n\nThe EV6 has only the slightest driving differences from the Ioniq 5, perhaps thanks to its 4-inch-shorter wheelbase (114.2 inches versus the Ioniq 5’s 118.1 inches). This makes it a little more eager to turn into corners and gives it a slightly choppier ride at highway speeds, but it’s not enough to make it a sportier driving option than the Hyundai. The shorter wheelbase certainly helps with the EV6’s smaller turning circle — 38.2 feet versus the Ioniq 5’s 39.3 feet. Be sure to check out our more thorough discussion of what’s different between the EV6 and Ioniq 5.\n\nWith one drive motor up front and one in the back, the AWD EV6 GT-Line makes 320 horsepower and 446 pounds-feet of torque, which Kia says propels the EV6 from 0-60 mph in 5.1 seconds; for comparison, Kia says its Stinger sports sedan with a turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder hits 60 mph in 5.2 seconds.\n\n2022 Kia EV6 | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nThe EV6’s acceleration is hugely dependent on your selected driving mode. In Eco mode, the EV6’s acceleration is severely hampered — not great if you need to move quickly. In Sport mode, there’s a rush of acceleration until you reach about 45 mph, when acceleration subdues. A higher-performance EV6 GT (not the GT-Line, which I drove) will come later, offering even more power and faster acceleration.\n\nOne perhaps-fun aspect of the EV6 is that you can change the acceleration sound heard inside the cabin to a number of different tones, including a customizable option that gives you a few levels to play with. None were particularly engaging to me, though, so I opted to keep them off. Other people might like the spaceship audio track.\n\nHow the EV6 Charges\n\nThe EV6 comes with no standard mobile charging equipment for plugging the car into a household outlet, though an accessory Level 1 (“trickle”) charger can be purchased from the dealership. At Level 1 speeds, going from empty to full takes roughly 68 hours for the long-range battery and 51 hours for the short-range battery. Obviously, this isn’t how you should charge your own EV, so if you’re going to get an EV6, you should consider installing a Level 2 charger at home. See our home charging guide to help you determine what kind of equipment you need.\n\nWith a Level 2 charger, an EV6 with a long-range battery can go from empty to full in as little as 7 hours and 10 minutes; the short-range battery charges in 5 hours and 50 minutes. With my test car’s 274-mile estimated range, that averages out to 38 miles of range per hour; this is the more useful charging specification to seek out, given you’ll rarely be charging from empty to full.\n\nNote that Kia’s stated maximum charge speeds result from the EV6’s competitive 10.9-kilowatt charging capacity and a 48-amp Level 2 charger (a 48-amp charger requires a 60-amp circuit and hardwired installation). A lower-rated Level 2 charger will take longer. This is common among all EVs with faster home charging speeds: A Level 2 charger that simply plugs into a 240-volt outlet and is rated 40 amps or lower won’t give you the fastest listed charging speeds.\n\nPerhaps Kia is anticipating that EV6 buyers will be seasoned EV owners and already have the requisite equipment? I think it’s acceptable that the EV6 doesn’t come with a Level 1 charger, given it makes such a small dent in battery capacity, but to not include or at least offer a Level 2 mobile charger is a missed opportunity. Lower-powered mobile Level 2 chargers can work on a house’s existing 240-volt outlet (often 30 amps). Most EVs come with at least a Level 1 charger, and some — the Ford Mustang Mach-E, Chevrolet Bolt and Bolt EUV, and the Tesla Model Y — come with a Level 1/2 mobile charger that can charge at moderate Level 2 speeds.\n\nCars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nWhen it comes to public DC fast charging, Kia says the EV6 can add 217 miles of range in 18 minutes at a 350-kW fast charger, taking the battery from 10% to 80%. The EV6’s larger battery can accept up to 240 kW, while its smaller one is limited to 180 kW. These are respectable numbers, providing near parity with a Tesla Model Y, which can charge at 250 kW. The Mach-E, Volkswagen ID.4 and Volvo XC40 Recharge can accept a maximum of only 125 to 150 kW. There’s a definite advantage here for Kia versus its competitors, and Kia exploits it through its higher-voltage battery system (roughly 700 volts in the EV6 versus 400 volts in some other EVs), but it might not be as stout in practice as it seems on paper. That’s because vehicle conditions, battery temperature and ambient temperature affect how quickly any EV can actually charge.\n\nThe fastest charge times at 350-kW stations will come at roughly room temperature, according to Kia. Those were not the conditions when I drove an EV6. I charged my EV6 test car at a 350-kW charger on a 29-degree February day, and the battery went from 23% to 84% in 30 minutes, adding 163 miles of range. I observed a maximum 134.1-kW charge speed, and that only briefly. Those are strong numbers for a non-Tesla EV, but they pale in comparison to the EV6’s best-case scenario — and to how long it takes to refuel a gasoline-powered car at the pump. There’s no denying that cold weather puts a big damper on EV ownership.\n\nFurther limiting the EV6’s real-world advantage is the fact that 350-kW chargers aren’t widespread at the moment (at least not compared with Tesla superchargers) and are still found mostly along highway corridors. There are just two 350-kW stations in the Chicago area — and saying “Chicago area” is generous, given those two stations are located in Rockford and Joliet, Ill., which are 90 and 50 miles outside the city, respectively.\n\nKia EV6’s Tricks\n\nBefore we evaluated the new EV6 and Hyundai Ioniq 5, we deemed the Model Y a benchmark for this class — and even bought one for a long-term test car — but the EV6 has a lot to offer potential EV buyers who are turned off by some of the Tesla’s controversial features, like its lack of an instrument panel. The EV6 will be an especially enticing alternative for those who like the coupe-inspired profile.\n\n2022 Kia EV6 | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nNot only does the EV6 GT-Line have an instrument panel, its all-digital display is exceptionally informative, listing everything a driver would want to see. There’s also a head-up display on the GT-Line that shows augmented-reality navigation and driver-assist graphics, so you don’t have to look down at a touchscreen as you do in the Model Y. And more traditional doesn’t mean boring; there are still some cool tricks inside the EV6, including a spaceship command-type console with touch-sensitive controls for the heated and ventilated seats and heated steering wheel; in the Model Y, these are buried in touchscreen menus.\n\nThe Kia also brings trick functionality with the climate and media controls: A digital display between two rotary knobs can transition between climate and media functions with the press of a button, making way for the elusive volume and tuning knobs. Good luck finding traditional volume and tuning knobs in other EVs; they’re increasingly hard to come by in this class.\n\nCars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nThe EV6 takes advantage of its flat-floor EV platform by leaving the area below and ahead of the center console mostly open for storage of larger items, though it doesn’t leave as much space as the Ioniq 5.\n\nFurther taking advantage of its EV-ness in ways the Tesla doesn’t, the EV6 has power transfer capability that allows it to act like a giant portable battery, capable of powering any number of electric devices, including important home appliances in a power outage. Called Vehicle-to-Load (V2L), it’s found on Wind and GT-Line trims and includes two 120-volt AC household outlets, one in the middle of the backseat near the floor (like on an airliner) and another in the form of an adapter that plugs into the exterior charge port. They can supply as much power as a 120-volt outlet in your home, with some limitations. We even charged our long-term Model Y test car using the EV6’s power transfer capability. It was painfully slow, adding only 2 miles of range per hour, but it worked. Most home-style outlets you see in gasoline-powered cars max out at 400 watts for small devices, but the EV6’s outlets have parity with most home outlets, at 16 amps and 1,900 watts (1.9 kW).\n\nPricing\n\nThe EV6’s price ranges from $42,155 (all prices include destination), for the Light trim level and its smaller 58 kilowatt-hour battery and RWD, up to $57,155, for the GT-Line trim with the larger battery and AWD. Those numbers don’t include state or federal incentives, though, and the EV6 is still eligible for a full $7,500 tax credit (so long as the buyer also qualifies).\n\nThe lower-spec car still looks good on paper, with 232 miles of range and an EPA-rated combined efficiency of 117 mpg-e. That’s slightly less range than the 2022 Niro EV (a new one is on the way) but higher efficiency, which means the EV6 uses a bit less energy to travel the same distance.\n\nThe EV6’s standard equipment list is generous, including the following notable features on the entry-level Light trim level:\n\n12.3-inch digital instrument panel\nTwo-position memory driver’s seat\nHeated front seats\nFive USB outlets: One Type-A data port, two Type-C charge ports up front and two Type-C charge ports in back\nWireless phone charger\nBlind spot warning\nLane keep assist\nLane centering\nAdaptive cruise control\nRear cross-traffic alert\nWired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto (like Kia’s other big-screen systems, wireless functionality is left out)\n\nThe base EV6 also brings Kia’s long 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty, which covers the EV battery, and five-year/60,000-mile limited basic warranty. Kia includes 1,000 kWh of fast charging at Electrify America stations, good for up to three years before the offer expires, equating to about $430 when calculated by kWh. (EA charges 43 cents per kWh for guest and non-paid-subscription members, though rates can vary depending on whether the station charges by kWh or by time used, which is determined by state regulations.)\n\nGoing back to the GT-Line trim level I drove with the limited headroom, that EV6 cost $57,410, including a $295 GT-Line Suede Seat Package. Why am I not blinking an eye at that price tag? Because the EV6 delivers not only a fairly normal car-driving experience, it’s also a good EV experience, and that’s something that just hasn’t happened with EVs in this price range before. That headroom, though …\n\nChoosing a lesser trim level (Light or Wind) with more headroom means losing the following features:\n\nMoonroof (duh)\nAero retractable door handles (might not be a bad thing, as they froze shut during our winter test drive)\nHighway Driving Assist 2 (automatic lane change and in-lane positioning)\nAutomatic evasive-steering assist, automatic collision-avoidance assist for side and oncoming lane changes\nHead-up display with augmented-reality navigation and driver assist readouts\n20-inch wheels with AWD (again, probably OK as the ride likely improves with the standard 19-inchers)\nHomeLink functions on rearview mirror\nLED accent lighting\nAlloy pedals\n\nIt’s hard to give up the head-up display because it’s so convenient (except when wearing polarized sunglasses, which makes it hard to see), but most of these features aren’t deal-breakers, while dismal headroom and visibility certainly might be.\n\nAlternatively, if you like what you’ve read here about the EV6’s overall strengths, it’s also worth a look across town at the Hyundai Ioniq 5, which shares many of the same strengths but lacks the headroom and visibility concerns. Note, however, that the Ioniq 5 isn’t sold in all 50 states yet, as is the EV6. For some buyers, though, the EV6’s styling might make it enticing enough to look past the problem areas in favor everything it does well, which is a lot.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2022 Kia EV6 on Sale Soon, Priced From $42,115\n2022 Kia EV6 One-Ups Hyundai Ioniq 5 With 310-Mile Max EPA Range\nUp Close With the 2022 Kia EV6: Coming Out Swinging\nTop 10 Most Efficient Electric Cars\nBest Electric Vehicle of 2022\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The new GT performance version of the 2023 Kia EV6 dials up the power, handling and fun of this all-electric SUV — without breaking the bank.\n\nVersus the competition: The EV6 GT delivers better top-end acceleration performance than the Ford Mustang Mach-E GT Performance Edition and is more engaging to drive than the Tesla Model Y Long Range. It also costs considerably less than both of them.\n\nWe’ve been fairly impressed with the Kia EV6 all-electric SUV, especially when it beat the Tesla Model Y when we matched a GT-Line trim level against our long-term Model Y Long Range in a head-to-head comparison consisting of street, track and charging testing.\n\nRelated: Tesla Model Y Vs. Kia EV6: Best Against Next\n\nThe EV6 was already a bit of a performance electric vehicle, but for 2023, Kia has a new high-performance GT trim that considerably sharpens and heightens the SUV’s demeanor. It features more powerful front and rear motors, bigger brakes, revised steering tuning, an adaptive suspension and an electronically controlled limited-slip rear differential. Exterior and interior changes are more modest but include 21-inch alloy wheels wrapped in Goodyear Eagle F1 summer tires and, inside, front sport seats with neon-green accents.\n\nSo how do all these changes affect the EV6 driving experience? To find out, I traveled to Las Vegas at Kia’s invitation to drive the EV6 GT both on the street and at the track (Cars.com pays for its own airfare and lodging when attending manufacturer-sponsored events). The changes make the EV6 a compelling performance machine, but they have tradeoffs, too, and the GT still has some of the same shortcomings as the regular EV6.\n\nOn the Street\n\nThe EV6’s GT-specific features come through in different ways in everyday driving and, combined, give it a clear performance focus. The adaptive suspension tuning is firm even in the Normal drive mode, and it gets even less forgiving when you choose GT mode. The ride isn’t as harsh (or as loud in the cabin) as in a Model Y, but you always feel the suspension reading the road and communicating back to you the pavement’s general condition. Even if you’re on a road that looks perfectly smooth, the EV6 GT will let you know that it’s not as it reacts to unseen bumps and dips.\n\nThe suspension tuning’s benefit is evident in the car’s controlled body motions, as the EV6 GT stays impressively level when charging through fast corners, and it isn’t unsettled when the road drops from under you when cresting a hill. The car’s curb weight is considerable at nearly 4,800 pounds, but around 1,000 pounds is from the high-voltage battery pack. The battery is in the floor, which helps lower the EV6’s center of gravity, and this, along with the suspension tuning, benefits handling.\n\nThe new steering tuning also contributes to the GT’s performance feel. The steering ratio is quicker, the wheel itself has quite a bit of heft to it, and the Sport and GT drive modes further increase steering effort. There’s also a bit of feedback through the rim of the wheel to let you feel what’s happening at the tires.\n\nThe only tires the GT offers are summer performance rubber. The Eagle F1s do tend to pick up and launch small road debris like sand and pebbles at the wheel liners, creating a bit of a background soundtrack when driving, but the tires themselves aren’t noisy, and the cabin is impressively quiet overall, with wind noise only noticeably intruding above 70 mph.\n\nThe GT’s new front and rear electric motors are powerful, delivering total output of 576 horsepower and 545 pounds-feet of torque. That’s a big jump from an all-wheel-drive GT-Line, which makes 320 hp and 446 pounds-feet of torque but is also around 300 pounds lighter. Kia claims the GT is good for 0-60 mph in just 3.4 seconds and has a top speed of 161 mph.\n\nMoving up the drive modes from Eco to Normal to Sport to GT heightens accelerator-pedal response, to the point where it’s very immediate in the GT mode. GT mode also unlocks the car’s full 576 hp; it’s limited to 429 hp in Normal and Sport, and 286 hp in Eco. GT mode offers the most aggressive acceleration response, but Normal and Sport modes also provide effortless acceleration that’s more than enough for everyday driving. Drive more conservatively, and the EV6 GT turns into a docile EV that can get decent efficiency; I observed 3.5 miles per kilowatt-hour during one 36-mile stretch of highway and rural two-lane-road driving, which is similar to the 3.3 miles per kWh that an EV6 GT-Line got during a highway range test as part of our Model Y comparison.\n\nThe EV6 includes adjustable regenerative braking and a one-pedal driving mode that are controlled by paddles on the steering wheel. When one-pedal driving is active, vehicle speed is controlled by the position of the accelerator pedal alone; let off on the pedal, and the car slows immediately. This turned out to be an unexpected performance feature, as it helped manage speed when entering a corner.\n\nAt the Track\n\nI also drove the EV6 GT on a road course and drag strip adjacent to Las Vegas Motor Speedway, and both places further showcased the car’s handling and acceleration performance.\n\nPerhaps the most surprising thing about the EV6 GT’s road course manners was just how willing, in GT mode, the rear end is to step out if you’re not careful getting back on the accelerator pedal when exiting a corner — there’s a looseness that you don’t always see in modern performance cars, let alone electric SUVs. The rear motor is powerful — it contributes 362 hp to the car’s total output — and GT mode dials back the stability system’s willingness to intervene (it can be turned off completely, too). The resulting tail happiness added a bit of unexpected fun when pushing the SUV on the track. If you really want to let it all hang out, there’s a Drift setting that uses the rear motor to create oversteer when cornering.\n\nThe EV6 GT will get around a tight road course reasonably well thanks to its well-controlled body motions and stout power, but you can feel the car’s considerable heft — particularly when mashing the brake pedal before entering a turn. The car’s beefier brakes — the front ventilated discs measure 15 inches, while the rears are 14.2 inches, and there are quad-piston front calipers — do a good job shedding speed, but you can tell they’re working hard.\n\nThe drag strip revealed just how strong the EV6 GT’s dual-motor drivetrain is, as the SUV consistently ran quarter-mile times in the 11.4-second range at around 118 mph. We’ve tested the Model Y Long Range with its Acceleration Boost unlocked versus a Genesis GV60 Performance, as well as a Ford Mustang Mach-E GT Performance Edition, at our home drag strip in Union Grove, Wis., and the EV6 GT was faster than all of them. I was particularly impressed with the EV6 GT’s ability to sustain its acceleration during the latter half of the quarter-mile; the Mustang Mach-E GT Performance Edition, by comparison, loses a considerable amount of steam, resulting in unimpressive quarter-mile performance.\n\nA Familiar Cabin — For Better or Worse\n\nApart from the new front sport seats and some distinctive green accents, the GT’s cabin is very similar to the GT-Line version of the EV6 with mostly black trim and suede-style accents. It looks stylish and sporty, and the various controls are easy enough to use.\n\nThe front sport seats are a good addition overall, as their bolstered sides do a good job holding you in place during fast corners, but they’re not perfect. For one, the seats have manual as opposed to power adjustments like the GT-Line, and though they’re heated, they lack adjustable lumbar support and ventilation, which are also GT-Line features. The seats’ overall lack of amenities seems out of place in an SUV with a starting price north of $62,000. What’s more, the seats’ hard cushioning wasn’t particularly comfortable; most seats in the cars I test agree with me, but the EV6 GT’s are a notable exception.\n\nThere are other comfort shortcomings, too, that are also present in other EV6 models and are particularly relevant if you’re taller than 6 feet, as I am. Front-seat headroom is especially limited in moonroof-equipped trim levels like the GT where it’s standard and, in the backseat, you sit with your thighs elevated at an uncomfortable angle because the seat cushion and floor are close. The rear backrest reclines, which improves overall comfort somewhat, but the combination of a black headliner and short side windows make the backseat feel a bit closed-in.\n\nEfficiency, Range and Charging\n\nLike other performance EVs, the EV6 GT is less efficient and has a shorter estimated driving range than its less powerful siblings, but the difference is more dramatic than its competitors. The GT gets an EPA-estimated 79 mpg-equivalent combined and has an estimated range of 206 miles, but the most efficient AWD EV6 is rated 109 mpg-e combined with a range of 282 miles. The efficiency and range spread between regular and performance versions is closer for the Model Y, Mustang Mach-E and GV60.\n\nThe Model Y Performance’s 303-mile driving range is considerably longer than the EV6 GT’s, but the Kia’s 800-volt architecture supports faster DC charging, which is an advantage we observed during our comparison test of the Model Y and EV6. The EV6 GT also comes with 1,000 kWh of complimentary energy at Electrify America chargers to use within the first three years of ownership.\n\nThe GT’s 206-mile range is modest by modern EV standards, but it should still be more than enough for most daily driving needs, making home charging the more relevant consideration. All EV6s have a 10.9-kilowatt onboard charger that Kia says can recharge the battery in around 7 hours using a Level 2 charger operating at 48 amps. Like other EV6s, the GT has a 77.4-kWh battery pack, and in earlier testing, using a Wallbox Level 2 home charger operating at 48 amps, an EV6 added 11.2 kWh of energy in an hour, so Kia’s roughly 7-hour charging time estimate seems reasonable.\n\nA Surprising Performance Value\n\nThere’s been some hefty price hikes recently on EV offerings from Tesla and Ford, to name two automakers, and the result has made models like the Model Y and Mustang Mach-E quite expensive, with the Model Y Performance starting at $71,440 and the Mustang Mach-E GT Performance Edition priced from $77,195 (all prices include destination).\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the EV6 GT is a performance bargain with a starting price of $62,695. There aren’t any option packages to boost the overall price; the only extra-cost items are some available accessories and certain paint colors.\n\nFinding highly anticipated performance cars selling at their sticker price without any dealer markups has long been difficult, and it’s a situation that’s been exacerbated with new-car inventory remaining tight coming out of the pandemic. Kia only plans to build 2,000 to 2,500 GTs a year for the U.S., so finding one for sale at its MSRP could very well be challenging. The thrills the EV6 GT offers, however, will make it worth your while.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2023 Kia EV6 GT: Performance Soars as Range Sinks\n2023 Kia EV6 Earns IIHS Top Safety Pick Plus Award\n2023 Kia EV6 Turns Out the Light, Adds GT and $1,000 More to Start\nHow Much Does It Cost to Charge an Electric Car?\nWhat It Cost to Outfit 6 Homes With EV Chargers\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The refreshed 2025 Kia EV6 is minimally but meaningfully updated, gaining new looks that bring its futuristic styling more in line with Kia’s other models and a larger available battery pack that should provide more range. We got to examine it more closely for the first time at the 2024 Los Angeles Auto Show.\n\nRelated: More 2024 L.A. Auto Show Coverage\n\nNeater, Techier Inside\n\nUpdates inside the EV6’s cabin include newly standard wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity, as well as Kia’s Connected Car Cockpit software that the brand says is faster and capable of over-the-air updates. These changes should make for a more up-to-date cabin experience for drivers and passengers alike. My personal favorite change, however, is the updated cabin materials that ditch much of the piano-black finish from interior surfaces and, thus, the mess of fingerprints covering the stylish interior. It’s the little things.\n\nIssues that remain after this update are the gigantic B-pillar blind spots and generally not-great outward visibility, along with restricted rear headroom. These are the prices for the EV6’s unique styling, but they’re definitely something shoppers should test out and consider before purchasing or leasing.\n\nStylish Exterior\n\nThe slightly longer body — 0.6 inch, to be precise — and updated front and rear styling make the EV6 look both more futuristic and less outlandish, while also making it look more like other Kias. In person, it has a bit more of a wagon feel than the previous EV6, too, which I like.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2025 Kia EV6: Longer Body, Bigger Batteries\n2026 Kia EV9 GT: An Electric Rocket for the Whole Family\nFace-Lifted 2026 Kia Sportage Gets More Standard Tech, Hybrid Gets (Slightly) More Power and Trims\nHow Fast Does the 2024 Kia EV9 Charge?\nFind Your Next Car\nKnown Unknowns\n\nThe elephant in the room is the EV6’s larger optional battery pack. Kia says the long-range rear-wheel-drive variant should max out at 319 miles now, up from the current 310. Power is also slightly increased for certain versions. We can’t test those updates on the show floor, though, so stay tuned once we get our hands on the updated EV6.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Kia EV6?\n\nThe Kia EV6 is a five-seat electric crossover that’s available in Light, Wind, GT-Line and high-performance GT trim levels. The Light offers a choice of a 58-kilowatt-hour or 74-kWh battery with rear-wheel drive; the latter combination unlocks the EV6’s maximum estimated driving range of 310 miles. All other trims come standard with the larger battery, and all save the GT offer a choice of rear- or all-wheel drive. Horsepower ratings with RWD are 167 hp with the smaller battery and 225 hp with the larger battery; AWD models have 320 hp. \n\nThe GT gets stronger electric motors that deliver a total of 576 hp, as well as a limited-slip rear differential, a performance-tuned suspension, upgraded brakes, sport front seats and unique styling touches. It can accelerate from 0-60 mph in less than 4 seconds, but its estimated driving range is only 218 miles. The EV6’s rivals include the Chevrolet Blazer EV, Ford Mustang Mach-E, Hyundai Ioniq 5, Tesla Model Y and Volkswagen ID.4.  \n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Kia EV6?\n\nThe EV6 is mostly unchanged for the 2024 model year. The entry-level Light trim returns to the lineup after a hiatus for 2023, lowering the EV6’s starting price by almost $6,000.\n\nHow Much Range Does the 2024 Kia EV6 Have?\n\nThe EV6’s EPA-estimated driving range runs from 218 to 310 miles, depending on trim, battery pack, drive wheels and wheel size.\n\nHow Long Does It Take to Charge the 2024 Kia EV6?\n\nThe EV6’s charging times range from an estimated 7 hours and 10 minutes on a standard 240-volt Level 2 charger to an estimated 18 minutes on a 350-kilowatt DC fast charger (to go from a 10% charge to 80%).\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Kia EV6 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\n12.3-inch infotainment touchscreen\nWired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nFive USB ports\nWireless device charging\nSatellite radio\nWi-Fi hot spot\n12.3-inch digital instrument display\nDual-zone climate control\nHeated front seats\nProximity keyless entry\nBlind spot warning\nLane departure steering assist\nRain-sensing wipers\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nRear cross-traffic alert\nDriver attention monitor\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nSynthetic leather upholstery\nHands-free power liftgate\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nMoonroof\nAmbient interior lighting\n14-speaker Meridian audio system\n21-inch alloy wheels\nLimited-slip differential\nReverse automatic emergency braking\nSurround-view parking camera system\nShould I Buy the 2024 Kia EV6?\n\nThe Kia EV6 is definitely worth consideration thanks to its sporty driving demeanor, powertrain variety, sleek looks and quick DC fast-charging capabilities. Its low-slung styling, however, brings some compromises in cabin space and visibility; the related Hyundai Ioniq 5 is more practical for everyday use — and a bit more affordable, too. We’re also not big fans of the EV6’s capacitive-touch dashboard controls.",
