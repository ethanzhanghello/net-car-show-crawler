      "expert_review": "If you’re on the bubble about your first electric vehicle, hoping for something reasonably affordable and also more practical than a small car, Kia has a deal for you: the friendly SUV-ish Niro EV. It’s a full-battery model of the long-roof hatchback that Kia already offers in hybrid and plug-in hybrid form. And while the Niro’s styled to look like an SUV, let’s be honest: It’s a well-designed front-wheel-drive wagon. And that’s just fine — no body shaming here.\n\nRelated: Hyundai Kona Electric Vs. Chevrolet Bolt EV: Which Is the Better Electric Car?\n\nThe Niro electric version is a corporate sibling of the appealing Hyundai Kona Electric, but it’s bigger and more well-rounded than the Kona, with a few more inches of length and wheelbase. That’s enough for a roomier and grown-up feel in the front seats, more comfort in the backseat and more family-friendly cargo space (about 18 cubic feet behind the backseat and more than 50 with the 60/40-split seatbacks folded). It’s a practical vehicle that just happens to be a competent electric vehicle, a combination that would make it a good first electric car and daily driver for a broad swath of buyers beyond EV early adopters.\n\nIf you’re ready to go all in on a plug-in, here are eight reasons the Niro EV is a good choice to be the first EV in your garage when it goes on sale in May — along with one reason making that happen might not be easy where you live:\n\nThings We Like\n1. It’s Affordable (by Today’s Standards)\n\nEVs aren’t cheap and for many, the leap from the sub-$30,000 non-plug-in Niro hybrid will be too much. But Niro EV pricing has just been announced and the base EX is moderately priced at $39,495, including a $995 destination charge, while the EX Premium starts at $44,995. Subtract the $7,500 federal credit and the EX comes in at about the average transaction price for a new car, while the fancier Premium still is well south of $40,000 — and that’s before state and local subsidies available in many places. And unlike Chevrolet’s Bolt EV and Tesla’s luxury electric vehicles, which are losing the federal credit, Kia has plenty of headroom before hitting the sales limit.\n\nFor the Niro EV’s purchase price, you get mobility with a smaller carbon footprint. But in what a recent Cars.com survey found, potential buyers might be at least as enticed by saving green as being green, and the Niro EV will save money over time with lower fuel and maintenance costs than a gasoline vehicle.\n\n \n\n2. It Has Miles to Burn\n\nA full charge of the 64-kilowatt-hour battery offers 239 miles of range, just 19 fewer than the smaller Kona with which it shares the powertrain. That’s enough for most people to handle their daily driving without anxiety and only have to plug in at home a couple of times a week.\n\nMost people … but not all, or not yet. If your household can get by on one car but also needs one for weekend rambling beyond the reach of handy chargers, the Niro’s also-appealing plug-in hybrid variant might be a more suitable first step. Its 26-mile all-electric range can handle a lot of commuting and you retain gas-engine flexibility when needed. You also still get federal plug-in subsidy for the purchase, albeit a smaller $4,543 versus $7,500 for the EV version.\n\n \n\n3. Fast Charging Is Onboard\n\nBeyond range, the Niro EV offers you the reassuring flexibility to use DC fast charging, which increasingly is becoming available at public stations. With a typical 7.2-kilowatt Level 2 home AC charger, a full charge of the 64-kilowatt-hour battery is an overnight thing at 9 hours and 35 minutes. But if you need a quick shot, the Niro EV comes ready to accept a fast charge that can fill the battery to 80 percent in 75 minutes on a 50-kW charger and in 60 minutes on the growing number of 100-kW fast chargers. You’ll likely rarely need that, but if, like me, you start puckering when your phone is at 50 percent, it’s comforting to know you can. Time on a regular home plug? Don’t ask. You need to budget for a Level 2 home charger for your new EV.\n\n \n\n4. It’s Not Weird\n\nThe Niro doesn’t overwhelm you with gadgets and gauges, and science-project design. The fact is that EVs are less complicated to drive and maintain than a gasoline car. And Kia ran with that, giving the Niro a familiar look and feel. It also simplified use, putting essential information such as range up front and making charging the car nearly as simple as charging your phone. Sure, it still has fancier EV graphics and electric-specific features that you can master at your leisure as you adapt to new habits to get the most mileage out of your juice — but the hardest thing to learn for a newbie might be remembering to turn the Niro off without the prompt of hearing a gas engine still running.\n\n \n\n5. It’s Hushed\n\nEVs are quiet. It’s a revelation of how much white noise you don’t consciously hear in a gasoline car, like a night in the country is a revelation to a city dweller. But a downside is that little noises you’d never otherwise notice will now stand out. Neither of these is exclusive to the Niro, but Kia has done a very good job of filtering out and suppressing potential annoyances in the hushed cabin, even gliding at low speeds with the whirring alert broadcasting a techy “on your left” warning to unwary pedestrians on their phones.\n\n \n\n6. It’s Comfortable\n\nSaving the planet should have rewards — and not just a pass for the HOV lanes. The Niro EV’s payback is a nicely designed and simple cabin that carves out a lot of space for its size, and is trimmed in quality materials and soft-touch surfaces above your elbows. The Niro has an upright driving position with excellent visibility all around. The buttons and switches are logically arranged, though I found myself wishing the touchscreen were a little higher. It has very comfortable front seats, and head and leg space for tall adults in the back. Cabin storage for your stuff is better than in many small SUVs, including a clever tray under the open front of the center console. A bonus in the EX Premium test car was good-looking gray leather upholstery with blue trim and stitching — even a blue accent in the leather perforations, and a red light signature around the console and rotating shift knob.\n\n \n\n2019 Kia Niro EV | Cars.com photo by Fred Meier\n7. You Can Have All the Modern Conveniences\n\nThe cabin may be simple, but the tech is not. Both the EX and EX Premium versions come with a buffet of driver-assistance and safety tech, including adaptive cruise control, a forward collision system with automatic braking and pedestrian detection, lane-centering steering assist, driver attention alert and a blind spot monitor with rear cross-traffic alert. While the base model is by no means stripped, the upscale EX Premium test car was loaded with, in addition to the leather seats, heated and ventilated front seats, a heated steering wheel, an 8-inch touchscreen system with navigation (the EX has a 7-inch screen), competent Harman Kardon premium audio, USB ports, wireless phone charging, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration, parking sensors, a smallish moonroof and upscale LED lighting inside and out.\n\n \n\n8. It’s Not a Dog\n\nThe electric powertrain puts out a healthy 201 horsepower and will pull the Niro EV to 62 mph from zero in 7.8 seconds and from 50 to 75 mph for passing in 5 seconds. It feels faster than that in town owing to the electric motor’s instant 291 pounds-feet of torque, leaping like our family cat and even sometimes chirping the eco-efficient tires. In addition to the Normal, Eco and Eco Plus (which I’d only use if running on empty), there is a more satisfying Sport mode that’s fun at the price of some electrons.\n\nThe underfloor battery gives the Niro EV a planted feel, though not without some body lean in the corners. The steering is very light but is precise with changes of direction. The ride is firm, not harsh, but a little brittle on rough streets — I’m not sure if that’s the suspension, the low-resistance tires or both. The regenerative braking system has an otherworldly feel at times, but there is no grab in the transition from regeneration to the standard brakes. My favorite braking feature is the variable regenerative braking paddles on the steering wheel that allow mostly one-pedal driving in the stop-and-go city.\n\nThings We Don’t\n1. Sold? It’s Not as Simple as Writing a Check\n\nThe Niro EV, like the mechanically similar Kona and coming Kia Soul EV, is built in South Korea and must share, says Kia, a currently short supply of batteries. So initial quantities for the U.S. will be constrained, with sales limited to California and a dozen other states — mostly those where a percentage of EV sales is or will be required. If you only have a limited number to sell, it makes sense to start with the “have to” states. Of course there’s nothing to stop you from going to L.A. to buy one if you can locate one on the ground (check back with Cars.com after it goes on sale).\n\n2019 Kia Niro EV | Cars.com photo by Fred Meier\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Following a significant redesign for 2023, Kia’s Niro EV enters the 2024 model year with minimal changes and a commensurate price increase of just $50. The 2024 model makes the dual-level cargo floor standard, drops Fire Orange Metallic exterior paint, and the base Wind variant no longer offers the Light Grey interior option.\n\nRelated: 2024 Kia Niro Hybrid: Minimal Updates, Loads of Efficiency and Safety Tech\n\nThe 2024 Niro EV Wind will start at $40,925, while the top Wave trim rings in at $45,925 (all prices include a $1,325 destination fee). Both trims of the all-electric hatchback are powered by the same single-motor, front-wheel-drive setup with a 64.8-kilowatt-hour battery that’s good for an EPA-estimated 253 miles of range.\n\nWe’re fans of the Niro EV, having named the 2023 model our Top Pick for Commuters. It’s also on our list of the cheapest EVs you can buy despite its starting price north of $40,000. One of the most notable competitors is the larger Volkswagen ID.4 SUV, which is slightly more affordable in its base RWD configuration with 209 miles of range; however, its closest competitor is the redesigned-for-2024 Hyundai Kona EV. We’ve driven the gas-powered version of the Kona, which is more expensive than the previous-gen model, but we don’t yet have pricing for the 2024 Kona EV.\n\nIf you’re interested in a different flavor of the Niro, you can choose a traditional hybrid or plug-in hybrid, as well. The 2024 Niro hybrid (the 2023 was our Best Car of 2023 winner) is priced from $28,165, while the 2024 Niro PHEV starts at $35,615.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2024 Kia Niro PHEV: 33 Miles of Electric Range for $35,615\nWhat to Know Before Purchasing an Electric Vehicle: A Buying Guide\nAuto Show Faceoff: 2024 Hyundai Kona Electric Vs. 2023 Kia Niro EV\nTop 10 Most Efficient Electric Cars\nWhat Are the Most Fuel-Efficient Cars?\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "After overhauling the compact electric SUV for the 2023 model year, Kia mostly left the Niro EV alone for 2024, tacking another $50 onto its base price. The brand is pretty much doing it again for 2025, with no major changes and prices staying the same for both the entry-level Wind and pricier Wave.\n\nRelated: Can You Road-Trip the 2023 Kia Niro EV With Its 253 Miles of Range?\n\nPowertrain Specs and Range\n\nKia offers the Niro in tiered levels of electrification: hybrid, plug-in hybrid and fully electric. The Niro EV is powered by a single electric motor on the front axle that generates 201 horsepower and 188 pounds-feet of torque. With a 64.8-kilowatt-hour battery pack, the Niro EV’s range is an EPA-estimated 253 miles.\n\nSafety Features and Trim Levels\n\nStandard on the 2025 Niro EV, Kia’s Drive Wise safety suite includes forward collision warning with pedestrian and bicyclist detection, automatic emergency braking, front cross-traffic alert, adaptive cruise control, lane departure steering assist, lane-centering steering, blind spot monitors, rear cross-traffic alert, a driver attention monitor, automatic high beams and a rear-seat reminder. Rear parking sensors with automatic braking are also included.\n\nThe entry-level Wind trim rides on 17-inch wheels and has LED taillights, rain-sensing windshield wipers, and keyless entry and start. It’s upholstered in a blend of synthetic leather and cloth and features a power-adjustable driver’s seat, heated front seats, dual-zone automatic climate control and ambient lighting. The standard tech suite consists of wireless phone charging, six speakers, a 10.25-inch digital instrument cluster and a 10.25-inch touchscreen with navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.\n\nTo that, the uplevel Wave trim adds some meaningful upgrades, including bidirectional charging, Hyundai’s Highway Driving Assist II hands-on semi-autonomous driving tech with automatic lane changes, automated parking, and front parking sensors. Exterior upgrades include LED front lighting, chrome and gloss-black exterior accents, and a power moonroof. Inside, the Wave gains ventilated front seats, a heated steering wheel, power-adjustable passenger seat and a Harman Kardon audio system.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2023 Kia Niro Review: More Personality, Still Practical\nKia EV Owners to Get Free Charging Adapters\nEvery New Electric Car Starting Price and Range Available Right Now\nWhat’s Bidirectional Charging and Which EVs Offer It?\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2023 Kia Niro EV?\nAvailability and Pricing\n\nThe 2025 Kia Niro EV will go on sale later in the year.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The redesigned Kia Niro family gains cargo room, new technology, expressive styling and improved efficiency across the model lineup, making all three Niro versions more attractive choices. \n\nVersus the competition: The Niro straddles several vehicle classes as an efficient alternative to a number of compact hatchbacks, subcompact and compact SUVs, and all-electric vehicles.   \n\nThe new-car marketplace — especially the mainstream-brand EV segment — have changed quite a bit since the first-generation Kia Niro was introduced for the 2017 model year. Since then, hybrid and plug-in-hybrid small SUVs have proliferated, as have dedicated-platform all-electric vehicles. With its redesign for 2023, the Niro sticks with its three-in-one electrified powertrain strategy (hybrid, PHEV and pure EV), but it gets a more distinctive look inside and out, better efficiency, new technology and mildly upsized dimensions. I attended the 2023 Niro’s press preview in Encinitas, Calif., to drive each and see how they stack up. (Per our ethics policy, Cars.com pays for its own airfare and lodging when attending manufacturer-sponsored events.)  \n\nRelated: 2023 Kia Niro: Three Familiar Flavors, One Spicy New Look\n\nFlashier Flanks \n\nIn terms of footprint and overall profile, the Niro lands in the gray area between a compact hatchback and a subcompact or compact SUV. It has SUV-like features such as a tallish body height and contrasting-color wheel and fascia cladding, but it doesn’t offer all-wheel drive or fortifications for all-terrain capability. Unlike the first-gen Niro offered only in select states, the new one is available nationwide. \n\n2023 Kia Niro (from left) PHEV, EV and hybrid | Cars.com photo by Damon Bell\n\nThe previous-gen Niro’s appearance was rather anonymous, but you’ll have a harder time losing the new one in a parking lot. The bolder look was inspired by Kia’s HabaNiro concept, and styling highlights include sharply angled LED daytime running lights, a contrasting-color panel that runs along the lower body sides, and “Aero Blade” accent panels on the rear quarters; Kia says the panels are functional, aiding airflow underneath the rear roof pillars. Body-color Aero Blades are standard, but top-line models can be outfitted with contrasting-color panels (black on the HEV and PHEV, gray on the EV) if you want a flashier look. \n\nDriving the Niro \n\nNiro EV \n\nThe Niro EV is the quickest Niro, with its 150-kilowatt electric motor rated at 201 horsepower supplying smooth, quiet acceleration that’s satisfyingly quick in city and highway driving. Accelerator pedal response is immediate and easy to modulate, and choosing the Sport drive mode makes things extra snappy, while Eco mode mutes the acceleration response, though not to the point of lethargy.  \n\nNiro \n\nI swapped into the Niro hybrid after getting out of the EV, and the noise from the four-cylinder gasoline engine was especially striking after the near-silent whirr of the EV’s powertrain. The engine’s exhaust note is a bit coarse and gravelly, especially when accelerating quickly — or at least as quickly as the hybrid can muster. Its 1.6-liter four-cylinder and 32-kW electric motor combine to produce 139 hp and 195 pounds-feet of torque, which is enough for adequate acceleration but nothing more. Choosing the Sport mode brought a slightly peppier feel, but also more noise, as the transmission held lower gears longer for higher-rpm operation.  \n\nNiro PHEV \n\nI also got brief seat time in the plug-in version, which gets the same 1.6-liter four-cylinder as the regular hybrid but pairs it with a 62-kW electric motor for a total output of 180 hp and 195 pounds-feet of torque. Fully charged, the PHEV can deliver an EPA-rated 33 miles of all-electric driving; unfortunately, my test vehicle’s battery had been fully depleted when I drove it, so I could only sample it in hybrid mode — no EV for me. Even as a hybrid, however, the PHEV’s 41-hp advantage over the dedicated Niro hybrid is apparent as it feels noticeably peppier overall.  \n\nBoth the hybrid and PHEV use a six-speed dual-clutch automatic that performs well, with none of the occasional bogging-and-surging feel or clunkiness in low-speed driving that some DCTs exhibit. Kickdowns for extra passing power are prompt and smooth, and there’s no herky-jerkiness in stoplight-to-stoplight driving. Likewise, the transitions from gas to electric power are laudably smooth in both hybrids, almost to the point of being undetectable.\n\nAll three Niros have multiple levels of regenerative braking — from no regen up to an “i-Pedal” one-pedal driving mode (exclusive to the EV) — that are selected via the steering-wheel paddles. The i-Pedal enables one-pedal driving that in many driving situations can bring the vehicle to a stop without pressing the brakes at all. The hybrid and PHEV include a Smart Regeneration System that automatically adjusts the braking regen level based on road conditions or a vehicle being detected in front. Regardless of the setting, regen feel is smooth and predictable, and I like having the option to choose my own setting based on driving conditions.  \n\nThe Niro is a competent handler overall in part because of its relatively trim dimensions, but overt athleticism is not its forte. The steering feel doesn’t offer much in the way of road feel or feedback, though it’s nicely weighted and accurate. The EV weighs 500-plus pounds more than the hybrid Niro and around 200-plus pounds more than the PHEV, depending on equipment, but it doesn’t feel noticeably heavier or more cumbersome in the corners. The Niro’s ride quality is pleasant and composed regardless of powertrain, at least on the pristine San Diego-area roads of our test-drive routes. The EV comes solely with 17-inch wheels; the hybrid and PHEV come with 16s or 18s, depending on the model.  \n\nEfficiency \n\nThough there are no major changes to the 2023 Niro’s powertrains compared to the first-generation models, efficiency has been improved across the board. The hybrid is EPA-rated at 53/54/53 mpg city/highway/combined, but those numbers drop substantially to 53/45/49 mpg if you choose an EX Touring or SX Touring due to 18-inch wheels. The two Tourings’ projected driving range drops significantly, too, from 588 to 479 miles.  \n\nThe PHEV’s all-electric driving range is an EPA-estimated 33 miles on a full charge (up from 26 miles previously) and combined driving range is 510 miles. Kia says the PHEV’s 11.1-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion polymer battery pack can be charged from zero to full in less than three hours via a Level 2 charger.  \n\nThe Niro EV’s driving range has been improved to an EPA-rated 253 miles, up from 239 miles in the first-gen model. That’s right in the ballpark of max range with the Chevrolet Bolt EV (259 miles) and Bolt EUV (247 miles), Toyota bZ4X (252 miles) and Volkswagen ID.4 (275 miles), but it doesn’t match the best two-wheel-drive versions of EVs such as the Ford Mustang Mach-E (314 miles), Hyundai Ioniq 5 (303 miles) and Kia EV6 (310 miles).  \n\nThe NIro EV’s 64.8-kWh battery can be recharged from empty to full in about seven hours on a Level 2 charger thanks to an onboard charger that has been upgraded from 7.2 kW to 11 kW. (The 2022 Niro EV took about 9.5 hours.) A maximum DC fast-charging capability of 85 kW means that the Niro EV can be charged from 10% to 80% in about 45 minutes. Again, most rival EVs do better: The extended-range EV6 can be charged from 10% to 80% in about 18 minutes thanks to its 240-kW capability. \n\nSpeaking of the EV6, the Niro EV gains the same vehicle-to-load onboard generator functionality offered in the EV6 and Ioniq 5: Plug the supplied adapter into the car’s exterior charge port, and the car supplies 120-volt power for various household appliances and other devices. That charge port is located at the nose of the Niro EV instead of the driver-side front fender as it is on the PHEV. We’ve experienced the front-mounted charge-port doors of some EVs get iced shut in nasty Chicago winter weather and have had to use hot water or windshield-washer fluid to get them to open. Kia has given some thought to the EV’s cold-weather usability, however: An optional heat pump and battery warmer are available to help preserve driving range in frigid temperatures. \n\nInside Story \n\nThe 2023 Niro’s mildly upsized dimensions include a 2.5-inch stretch in overall length that provides improved cargo volume and slightly better occupant room; 6-footers should find ample space in the front seats and respectable room in the rear seats. I had sufficient space in the driver’s seat for my 6-foot-6-inch frame even under the moonroof’s housing, which usually steals an inch or two of headroom, but I wished the steering wheel telescoped out a bit farther for an optimal driving position.  \n\nRear-seat space is tight for extra-tall passengers as legroom shrinks quickly when the front seats are adjusted rearward, and the front seat backs are entirely hard plastic, so there’s no cushioning at all if your knees and shins rub against them. Also, the Niro EV’s battery-pack hardware raises the floor in the rear-seat area, which further compromises legroom for tall passengers. On the plus side, the rear-seat climate control vents (standard on all but the hybrid’s base LX model) are generously sized, there’s a handy USB charging port built into the inboard side of both front seatbacks, and the PHEV and EV versions can be equipped with heated outboard rear seats.  \n\nThe Niro’s cargo volume is better than most compact hatchbacks and subcompact SUVs, approaching the capacity of some smaller compact SUVs. The cargo area’s load floor is rather high, but the hybrid’s cargo-floor panel can be installed in a lower position to free up a few inches of extra vertical space. The EV includes a small frunk under the hood with its own hinged, latched cover and a tie-down net for loose items. Inside, small-items storage is about average among compact hatchbacks. The front and rear door pockets are a bit stingy, but one of my favorite features from the first-gen Niro carries over: clever retractable cupholders that can be stowed to create an undivided cargo bin.  \n\nKia touts the fact that the Niro’s interior is finished in several animal-free, enviro-conscious materials, such as a headliner made from recycled wallpaper and upholstery material made from eucalyptus leaves. That’s nice, but what’s also nice is that those eco-focused materials don’t look or feel cut-rate. A variety of padded surfaces and satin-finish accents give the cabin a respectably classy ambiance for a mainstream compact, at least in the top-line versions I drove.  \n\nThe dynamic dashboard layout is highlighted by a pair of 10.25-inch screens on top models, one for the instrument cluster and one for the infotainment touchscreen. Most controls are straightforward and easy to use. As with the first-gen Niro, the PHEV and EV versions get an ergonomically agreeable rotary-dial gear selector, while the hybrid sticks with a more traditional T-handle shift lever. \n\nLike the EV6 and redesigned-for-2023 Sportage compact SUV, all Niros use a dual-purpose capacitive-touch panel that toggles between climate and infotainment controls at the touch of a virtual button; this includes the panels’ two physical knobs, which switch from volume and tuning functions to driver and passenger temperature control functions. This dual-purpose setup is space-efficient, but it necessitates an extra step when you need to switch from climate to infotainment controls and vice-versa. On the whole, however, the layout strikes the right balance between flashy and functional; it’s easier to live with day to day than some current EVs that seem to aim for a “different for the sake of different” control layout (looking in your direction, VW ID.4). \n\nMore From Cars.com: \n\nKia Announces 2023 Niro Hybrid Prices \nUp Close With the 2023 Kia Niro EV, PHEV and Hybrid \nHere Are the 11 Cheapest Electric Vehicles You Can Buy \nWhat Are the Most Fuel-Efficient Cars for 2022? \n2020 Kia Niro PHEV Review: Old-School Hybrid With Old-School Issues \n2022 New York Auto Show: Best in Show \nTechnology and Safety \n\nAll Niros come standard with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, but it’s wireless only on the base HEV LX model; on the rest, you’ll need to plug in your phone. Available features include a wireless charging pad, ambient cabin lighting, a head-up display, power liftgate, Kia Connect remote-access services, a digital key and eight-speaker Harman Kardon audio. \n\nThe HEV and PHEV offer a Green Zone Drive Mode feature that Kia says uses navigation data to automatically activate EV mode in residential areas and near schools and hospitals. Navigation-based adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability and automatic road-curve speed reduction is also available. Kia’s Highway Driving Assist II driver-aid system is also optional; it adds lane centering and lane change assist to cruise control capabilities (the driver must keep his or her hands on the steering wheel).   \n\nKia’s Drive Wise suite of safety features is also standard and includes forward collision warning with pedestrian detection and automatic emergency braking, lane departure steering assist, driver-attention and blind-spot monitors, rear cross-traffic alert with automatic braking, and a safe-exit warning system. All but the base LX hybrid include forward collision avoidance assist with junction turning, which can help avoid collisions in intersections.  \n\nValue \n\nKia has only released pricing for the Niro hybrid and PHEV so far. The hybrid is starting to arrive in dealerships now; the PHEV and EV will follow. The hybrid starts at $27,785 (all prices include $1,295 destination) in base LX trim and runs up to $36,085 for the SX Touring. Those prices should make the Niro competitive with rivals such as the soon-to-arrive Toyota Corolla Cross, though the latter is available with AWD. \n\nThe PHEV starts at $35,035 in EX trim and $40,785 in SX Touring form, which puts it right in the mix with the Ford Escape PHEV and Subaru Crosstrek Hybrid (also a plug-in). We’ll have to wait and see where the EV lands price-wise, but my hunch is that it will compare well with the Toyota bZ4X and VW ID.4. \n\nThe Niro doesn’t break new ground in efficiency or driving range, but the numerous enhancements and welcome new features for 2023 make it a compelling competitor to any number of compact vehicles regardless of which powertrain you choose. \n\nRelated Video: \n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2022 Kia Niro?\n\nA four-door hatchback that seats five, the Kia Niro is available with a hybrid, plug-in hybrid or battery-electric drivetrain, all with front-wheel drive. Competitors include the Subaru Crosstrek Hybrid, Toyota Prius and Hyundai Kona EV.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2022 Kia Niro?\n\nAll Niro variants wear Kia’s new corporate logo. New standard features for the Niro EV include a 10.25-inch touchscreen navigation system and a Harman Kardon premium stereo.\n\nWhat Features in the 2022 Kia Niro Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nDual-zone automatic air conditioning\nCloth seats\n60/40-split folding backseat\n8-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nPower moonroof\nRemote start\nSimulated leather upholstery\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\n25-inch touchscreen navigation system with wired CarPlay and Android Auto\nHarman Kardon premium stereo\nSatellite radio\nWireless device charging\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane-keeping assist\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nAdaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nShould I Buy the 2022 Kia Niro?\n\nThe Niro is a great choice for anyone who wants to limit their gas station visits; opt for the all-electric Niro EV and you’ll never have to visit one again, though its EPA-estimated 239 miles of range is significantly less than the Niro hybrid and plug-in hybrid offer thanks to the addition of a gas engine. Agile and easy to drive, the most affordable Niro is the hybrid. Downsides include modest power from the hybrid drivetrains and a lack of available all-wheel drive.",
