      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2020 Cadillac XT5’s new Sport trim level doesn’t change its character much, but you’re left with a well-executed and roomy, if unexciting, SUV.\n\nVersus the competition: Straddling a line between “premium” and “luxury,” what the XT5 lacks in refinement and impressive features, it makes up for with user-friendly technology and a polished powertrain.\n\nWhen we last dug into the Cadillac XT5, a 2018 model took advantage of its large size on its way to a fourth-place finish in a seven-SUV comparison test. Not great, but not terrible.\n\nSince that time, Cadillac has made a variety of changes to the XT5 for 2020 including a slight face-lift, an updated infotainment system and this: a new mid-level Sport trim that wears unique 20-inch wheels and dark exterior accents meant to make it look a little meaner. Does the XT5 Sport inject a dose of fun into the staid SUV?\n\nRelated: Is the 2020 Cadillac XT5’s Updated CUE Any Better With Buttons?\n\n‘Sport’ Ain’t Nothing but a Name\n\nAs part of the Sport treatment, Cadillac gives the XT5 slightly quicker steering and what it calls “more aggressive chassis tuning.” It also gets a standard suspension with active damping. That sounds great in theory, but in practice the changes aren’t especially noticeable. The steering is still on the vague side, and lots of body roll around corners remains. Cadillac hasn’t turned the husky XT5 into a canyon-carving sports car, or done much to change its nature at all.\n\nBut that’s not a bad thing. The XT5 Sport still has a smooth and comfortable ride, even on its standard 20-inch wheels (the base Luxury and mid-level Premium Luxury come standard with 18s). Power from its 310-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 comes on smoothly with a nine-speed automatic transmission that always seems to know the right gear for the driving situation.\n\nGas mileage with the Sport’s standard all-wheel drive and V-6 is subpar, rated at just 18/25/20 mpg city/highway/combined, but the XT5’s V-6 has an advantage over most luxury competitors (and the turbo four-cylinder that’s standard on non-Sport XT5s): It recommends regular gas instead of premium.\n\nComfortable but Not Flashy Inside\n\nWhere the XT5 Sport’s larger size is a weakness for sportiness, it’s a strength for interior comfort. There’s plenty of room for adults front and rear, and a sizable cargo area to boot — Cadillac measures it at 30.2 cubic feet behind the rear seats and 63 cubic feet with the backseat folded down.\n\nInterior quality and luxury are middle of the road. There are some carbon-fiber accents for the Sport, but otherwise it’s a normal XT5 interior. Materials are mostly good but not great and there’s no real “wow” factor, an impression that feels consistent across Cadillac’s “X” SUVs: XT4, XT5 and XT6. If you’re looking for a truly luxurious Cadillac interior, you’ll have to spend a fair amount more to get the redesigned 2021 Escalade.\n\nUser-Friendly Tech (Mostly)\n\nI’ve detailed my thoughts on the XT5’s updated CUE — Cadillac User Experience — infotainment system already, but it still shines as one of the easier systems to use. It’s not the fastest, and it’s not my favorite, but the addition of physical controls is a significant improvement over previous CUE iterations. None of the infotainment technology in the XT5 feels cutting-edge, but for the most part it works with minimal fuss and less confusion than centerpiece systems like Mercedes-Benz’s MBUX or Audi’s MMI.\n\nUnfortunately, there are still touch-sensitive climate controls, which are aggravating, and the 8-inch display screen is actually starting to look relatively small. There’s one other strange quirk: The wireless device charging pad is located in front of the center armrest at an unusual angle, and the structure to keep your device from flying away while driving may require removing bulky cases before using it. Fortunately, there’s plenty of storage space up front.\n\nSafety\n\nThe XT5 earned the highest possible rating in most of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s tests, though its headlights received a low rating and it didn’t win either of the IIHS safety awards, unlike 11 other SUVs in its class. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gives the XT5 a five-star overall rating. It also performed well in Cars.com’s own Car Seat Check.\n\nStandard safety tech on the XT5 Sport includes forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking and pedestrian detection, and blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert. Weirdly, while adaptive cruise control is optional on the XT5, this test vehicle didn’t have it, unusual for a presumably “luxury” vehicle.\n\nShould You Buy an XT5 Sport?\n\nI don’t think the “sporty” tweaks amount to anything, but XT5 shoppers probably aren’t looking for a sporty driving experience. \n\nAt our test vehicle’s price of $59,340 (including destination), this XT5 Sport doesn’t feel like a bargain, but it’s larger than similarly priced compact luxury SUVs and cheaper than similarly sized mid-size luxury SUVs. While it may not have the stunning high-tech features of some of its rivals, or their more dynamic driving experiences, the XT5 Sport is a solid SUV with more marks in the plus column than the minus.\n\nIf Cadillac starts trickling down some of the new Escalade’s more advanced features to the XT5, the competition will really heat up.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2020 Cadillac XT5?\n2020 Cadillac XT5 Adds More Standard Tech, New Base Engine\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto: Where Are They Now?\nWhat’s the Most Reliable New-Car Brand for 2020?\n2021 Cadillac Escalade Review: Expensive, and Worth It\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Cadillac XT5?\n\nThe Cadillac XT5 is a mid-size, five-seat luxury SUV powered by a 235-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine. Optional is a 310-hp, 3.6-liter V-6. Both engines are paired to a nine-speed automatic transmission and can be had with front- or all-wheel drive. Three main trims are offered: Luxury, Premium Luxury and Sport.\n\nCompetitors include the Lexus RX, Lincoln Nautilus and Volvo XC60. A quiet ride and comfortable suspension give the XT5 a relaxed air, but its handling sharpness and acceleration trail much of the competition. It does, however, offer plenty of storage space. The XT5 has 20.3 cubic feet of cargo volume behind the backseat, according to Cars.com’s measurements. See how it fared in our Car Seat Check.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Cadillac XT5?\n\nThe XT5 loses its previously available Platinum Package and infrared night-vision feature for 2025.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Cadillac XT5 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n8-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nAmazon Alexa\nWi-Fi hot spot\nBose stereo\nSatellite radio\nHeated front seats\nDual-zone climate control\nPower liftgate\nFront and rear parking sensors\nAutomatic high beams\nLane departure warning\nLane departure steering assist\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nHands-free power liftgate\nLeather seats\nVentilated front seats\nHead-up display\n360-degree camera system\nRearview camera mirror\nAdaptive cruise control\nReverse automatic braking\nShould I Buy the 2025 Cadillac XT5?\n\nThe Cadillac XT5 does many things well, but the competition is fierce and time marches on in the hotly contested luxury SUV market. In terms of value and driving comfort, the XT5 earns praise. Neither the turbo four nor the optional V-6 delivers dazzling performance, but each is reasonable in terms of fuel economy, and the V-6 runs on regular gasoline. Storage space is another plus: The cargo area is large, and there are lots of nooks and crannies throughout the interior. The XT5 doesn’t, however, have the level of poise and polish that can be found in nearly all its direct rivals.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Cadillac XT5? \n\nThe Cadillac XT5 is a mid-size luxury SUV with seating for five people in two rows. It’s powered by a standard 235-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine; a 310-hp, 3.6-liter V-6 is optional. Both engines team with a nine-speed automatic transmission, and front- and all-wheel-drive models are offered. \n\nCompetitors include the Lexus RX 350, Lincoln Nautilus and Volvo XC60.

We like the available V-6 engine’s power and the fact that it runs on regular gas. The XT5 isn’t as luxurious as some competitors, however, and we don’t care for its touch-sensitive climate controls.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2021 Cadillac XT5? \n\nThe Cadillac XT5 is a mid-size luxury SUV with seating for five in two rows. It’s powered by a standard 235-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine; a 310-hp, 3.6-liter V-6 is optional. Both engines pair with a nine-speed automatic transmission. Front- and all-wheel-drive versions are available, and competitors include the Lexus RX 350 and Audi Q5. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2021 Cadillac XT5? \n\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity is new, along with Amazon Alexa functionality. \n\nWhat Features in the 2021 Cadillac XT5 Are Most Important? \n\nStandard features include:\n\n18-inch alloy wheels\nLED headlights\nPower liftgate\nDual-zone automatic air conditioning\nHeated front seats\n8-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nBose stereo\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane-keeping assist\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nHands-free liftgate\nPanoramic moonroof\nLeather upholstery\nVentilated front seats\nHeated rear seats\nNavigation\nWireless device charging\nHead-up display\n360-degree camera system\nRearview camera mirror\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nAdaptive cruise control\nReverse automatic braking\nAdaptive suspension\nShould I Buy the 2021 Cadillac XT5?\n\nThe XT5 is a comfortable mid-size luxury SUV, if not one of the sportier entries in the category. We like the available V-6 engine’s power, and the fact that it runs on regular gas. The XT5 isn’t as luxurious as some competitors, however, and we don’t care for its touch-sensitive climate controls.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2017 Cadillac XT5 excels at offering a luxurious experience that should tempt midsize luxury crossover SUV shoppers — and worry its competitors.\n\nVersus the competition: There’s no mistaking the Cadillac XT5 for anything but a luxury car. It feels more composed than the Lexus RX 350, but lighter and more fun than the Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class. It also offers a more comfortable ride than either of them and has a top-of-the-class interior.\n\nExterior & StylingFrom the outside, the first thing that stands out about the Cadillac XT5 five-passenger SUV is how fresh it looks compared with the SRX it replaces. It’s not that the SRX was an ugly car, but to my eye, it’s been around so long that it kind of blends in. Not so with the XT5: It has a pronounced grille and manages to look more aggressive. It’s not radically different, but since it’s taking over for a handsome car, I don’t think it needs to be.\n\nIt’s roughly the same size as the outgoing model. The Cadillac XT5 sits on a slightly wider track and is roughly the same length than the model it replaces, though the wheelbase is about 2 inches longer. What’s significant is the increased length goes right where it’s needed: into more rear-seat legroom. You can compare the two Cadillac models here.\n\nHow It DrivesThe old SRX was a comfortable SUV that I’d have no issue taking on a long drive along highways, but I wouldn’t want to take it anywhere with twisty roads. The SRX felt a bit too heavy and ponderous for that sort of thing. That’s not so in the XT5.\n\nThe Cadillac XT5 is 292 pounds lighter than the SRX, and it shows in its driving dynamics. The XT5 still is tuned to be a luxury car, but on the tight roads and twists of the driving route it never felt like it was wallowing or plowing. That it’s able to provide stable handling along with a comfortable ride over bumps is impressive.\n\n\nThe steering is well balanced and offers a decent feel of the road. It’s light enough to maneuver around a parking lot, but it still is OK on twisty stuff. Competitors such as the BMW X5 offer more road feel but also require more effort on the part of the driver. I think that for the luxury market, though, Cadillac may have found the sweet spot between being too light or too heavy. \n\nThere’s also an available Sport drive mode that alters the steering to offer a quicker response (as well as changing the shifting of the transmission for more aggressive driving), but I honestly didn’t notice much of a difference during my test of it.\n\nAll XT5 models are powered by a 310-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 engine with an eight-speed automatic transmission and can be had with front-drive or all-wheel drive. All the versions I drove had AWD.\n\nWhat’s interesting about the Cadillac XT5’s setup is that it uses a dual-clutch system to swap power front to rear and can send 100 percent of the power to either end of the car. The AWD system also can split torque from side-to-side on the rear axle.\n\n\nWhat drivers are likely to notice most, though, is that the system will require some input from them. With the XT5, you have to switch from front-wheel (called Touring drive mode) to all-wheel drive. The system won’t do it automatically — as others do. It will sense road conditions and outside temperatures and suggest to drivers that they swap modes.\n\nStaying in front-wheel drive helps mileage. The new Cadillac XT5 gets an EPA-estimated 19/27/22 mpg city/highway/combined with two-wheel drive and 18/26/21 mpg city/highway/combined with AWD. But I’m not sure asking the driver to swap modes to engage AWD is the best solution. (If you select AWD, the XT5 will remain in it until you change modes. So if you park for the night, the XT5 won’t default to front-drive when you restart the car and drive away.)\n\n\nThe XT5 deserves praise for a stop-start system that is among the least intrusive on the market. In stop-and-go traffic, it was hard to notice that the engine was shutting down or powering back up. This is something that competitors — notably the Mercedes-Benz GLE – fall short on. I really noticed it only when the engine turned on at a stoplight to run the air conditioner.\n\nThe XT5’s engine power is good but unremarkable. It did what I wanted it to do — making passes with ease and not making a lot of noise — but it’s not a barn burner.\n\nConsidering the competitors, the Lexus RX offers the most immediate accelerator response, but after that isn’t exceptional, and the Cadillac XT5 and GLE are similar in that they don’t offer that immediate accelerator response but otherwise offer satisfactory power for the class. In terms of handling, the RX 350 feels light but bounces around and doesn’t feel as composed as the XT5. The GLE, while it feels composed, also feels like it weighs significantly more than 400-ish pounds that it has over the XT5. You can compare the cars here. \n\nInteriorWhile there is more room for backseat passengers, they had better be either short or willing to recline the seat; there’s just not a lot of headroom. Granted, I’m 6 feet 2 inches tall and I carry a lot of my height in my torso, but others who aren’t as tall as I am also noticed the XT5’s tight rear headroom. There’s actually less room than in the SRX. Cadillac says that reclining the leather seat solves the problem by effectively giving you more room — and it does — but I’m just not sold. The fact is, if you’re a taller sort who likes to sit upright, the XT5’s backseat likely is going to be a problem.\nMy drive was in cars that had preproduction interiors, so I won’t speak to the craftsmanship, but the choices of the materials and the overall design are good. There are numerous decorative trim options including carbon fiber, two types of aluminum and three types of real wood.\n\nThey vary by trim level, so I got to sample only one of the aluminum and one of the wood interiors, and I was impressed. The wood managed to look like real wood — something that isn’t always the case. The same goes for the aluminum; it had the right sheen and, were I opting for the Cadillac XT5, it’d be the choice I’d go for. It seemed best to fit a modern car.\n\n\nIn a welcome change from the SRX, visibility is improved. Cadillac moved the side mirrors from the windshield pillars to the door, and fitted glass where the mirror was to open up the cabin. This has a big effect on making forward visibility better from the power-adjustable front seats, though the pillars sweep back in such a way that they obstruct surround-view visibility somewhat.\n\nI think the Cadillac does a better job than either the RX 350 or GLE in offering a truly luxurious interior. The RX 350 uses too much plastic that doesn’t look attractive enough to beat out either the Cadillac or Mercedes-Benz. The GLE-Class offers materials that rival the Cadillac’s, but I still think they fall short. Finally, a personal preference of mine is having the infotainment screen integrated in the dash, rather than the tablet-jammed-atop-the-dashboard look that’s the current fashion. Of the set, only the XT5 integrates the screen.\nErgonomics & ElectronicsCadillac retains its Cadillac User Experience system to handle the multimedia and navigation control. I didn’t play too much with the CUE system, but the little bit that I did showed that while it might not be the most intuitive right off the bat, I could pick it up pretty quickly. However, it doesn’t have a volume knob, so I found myself using the steering-wheel controls for that function. In either event, it’s nice to have a touch-screen to swap between menus as opposed to the awful mouse controller that Lexus uses. Apple CarPlay is standard.\n\nI extensively tested Cadillac’s rear camera mirror and liked what I saw. Unlike a backup camera, it provides a full-time rear view while driving forward. Built right into the conventional inside rearview mirror, the display offers such a wide, distortion-free view to the rear that on the highway I almost felt like I didn’t need side mirrors. And if I had the rear seats full, I’d find it handy to be able to see behind me rather than see my passengers’ smiling faces. I want to test the rear camera mirror at night to see how well it works, but during the day, it’s a treat. Things that appear in the rearview are a bit closer than they appear, but not so much that I’d say it’s a flaw. It’s just something to get used to.\n\nFor those who live in areas where a lot of road salt is used, the camera has a washing system to keep the rear lens clear. That’s a nice touch.\nCargo & StorageCadillac switched from a conventional, mechanical gearshift to an electric knob and, weirdly, its biggest payoff is in creating a space under the center console that’s large enough for a small messenger bag or purse. That came in handy on my test drive, and it’s something I’d see myself using a lot on a day-to-day basis.\n\nThe cargo area is not extraordinary, in that it’s not particularly large but not so tiny that it’s not useful.\nSafetyAs it’s a new car on a new platform, crash-test results for the XT5 are not available as of publication.\n\nCadillac offers a variety of safety features, most of which are bundled in the optional Driver Awareness and Driver Assist packages, and include automatic front and rear emergency braking for low-speed conditions, lane departure prevention, rear cross-traffic alert, blind spot warning and adaptive cruise control.\n\nYou can browse the full list of features here.\nValue in Its classSometimes when cars are redesigned it can be hard to see why it was done. The 2017 Cadillac XT5, however, takes a comfortable, aging car design and brings it up toward the top of the class.\n\nIt excels in being a luxury crossover SUV, meaning that its strengths are a high-quality interior and a comfortable ride. Its handling also is improved and moves it well ahead of the Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class and Lexus RX350.\nI’m still not sold on the all-wheel-drive system, though. The competitors don’t have a similar setup, and the difference between the all-wheel-drive and two-wheel-drive versions is only 1 mpg, so it feels really unnecessary. Still, after many hours driving the Cadillac XT5, that seemed to be its biggest flaw, and I think that says a lot.\n\nSend Bill an email",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Cadillac XT5? \n\nThe Cadillac XT5 is a five-seat, luxury mid-size SUV powered by a 235-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine. Optional is a 310-hp, 3.6-liter V-6. Both engines are paired to a nine-speed automatic transmission and can be had with front- or all-wheel drive. There are three trims offered: Luxury, Premium Luxury and Sport. Competitors include the Lexus RX, Lincoln Nautilus and Volvo XC60.\n\nThe XT5 has 20.3 cubic feet of cargo volume behind the backseat, according to Cars.com’s measurements. See how it fared in our Car Seat Check.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Cadillac XT5? \n\nThe XT5 gets a few cosmetic updates, including two new exterior colors and three accent-color packages on the Sport trim level. Twenty-inch wheels are now standard on the Premium Luxury trim.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Cadillac XT5 Are Most Important? \n\nStandard features include: \n\n8-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nAmazon Alexa\nWi-Fi hot spot\nBose stereo\nSatellite radio\nHeated front seats\nDual-zone climate control\nPower liftgate\nFront and rear parking sensors\nAutomatic high beams\nLane departure warning \nLane departure steering assist\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nHands-free power liftgate\nLeather seats\nVentilated front seats\nHead-up display\n360-degree camera system\nRearview camera mirror\nAdaptive cruise control\nReverse automatic braking\nAdaptive suspension\nShould I Buy the 2024 Cadillac XT5?\n\nThe Cadillac XT5 does many things well, but the competition is fierce and time marches on in the hotly contested luxury SUV market. In terms of value and driving comfort, the XT5 earns praise. Neither the turbo four-cylinder nor the optional V-6 delivers dazzling performance, but each is reasonable in terms of fuel economy, and the V-6 runs on regular gasoline. A quiet ride and comfortable suspension give the XT5 a relaxed air, though its handling sharpness and acceleration trail much of the competition. It does, however, offer plenty of storage space: The trunk is large, and there are lots of nooks and crannies throughout the interior. Still, the XT5 no longer has the level of poise and polish found in nearly all its direct rivals.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Cadillac XT5?\n\nOne of the hottest segments in the automotive industry is the luxury SUV class, and one of Cadillac's entrants is the five-seat XT5. The XT5 is powered by a standard 310-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 engine that works with an eight-speed automatic transmission. Front- and all-wheel-drive models are available, and competitors include the Audi Q5, BMW X3 and Mercedes-Benz GLC 300.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2019 Cadillac XT5?\n\nAn upgraded wireless charging system is designed to charge devices faster. Meanwhile, a newly available Sport Package features a gloss-black grille, LED headlights, clear-lens taillights, side steps, 20-inch gray aluminum wheels and sport pedals.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Cadillac XT5 Are Most Important?\n\nAll XT5 models come with the Cadillac User Experience multimedia system. CUE includes an 8-inch touchscreen, four USB ports, and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity. Navigation, wireless device charging and a Bose surround-sound stereo are available.\n\nOther standard features include dual-zone automatic climate control, a power-adjustable steering column, remote start and a power liftgate. Convenience options include a heated steering wheel, leather upholstery, a head-up display, a panoramic moonroof, heated and ventilated front seats, heated rear seats, a 360-degree camera system and a rearview camera mirror.\n\nAvailable active safety features include forward collision warning, lane departure warning, lane keeping assist, adaptive cruise control, front and rear automatic emergency braking, and blind spot warning.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Cadillac XT5?\n\nThe XT5 is slightly bigger than the compact luxury SUV norm, and a benefit of the extra size is good backseat legroom. Unfortunately, backseat headroom is limited, and the V-6's power underwhelms. We're also not fans of CUE's touch-sensitive controls for the air conditioning and audio systems, which can be frustrating to use.",
