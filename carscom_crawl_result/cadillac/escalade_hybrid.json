      "expert_review": "I see a lot of Cadillac Escalades on the road where I live in Los Angeles. I don’t know if it’s Tony Soprano or what, but these big ol’ things are popular around here. When I got a chance to drive the 2009 Escalade Hybrid I was pretty excited to see what all the, er, excitement was about, and now I’m just confused. Are people really that influenced by trends and good looks? Because as far as I can tell that’s just about all the Cadillac Escalade Hybrid has to offer.\n\nThe Escalade Hybrid is cumbersome, plasticky and overpriced, and it gets truly awful gas mileage. While it’s rated by the EPA to get 20/21 mpg city/highway, in my hilly area this monster could barely crack 13 mpg, even with my attempts to keep the needle in the “green” area. So, don’t let the ginormous hybrid decals fool you; this behemoth is no planet-saver. I really can’t see what makes the Escalade Hybrid so popular.\n\nI have to admit that the Escalade Hybrid drives nicely, for an SUV. The V-8 is coupled with a Two-Mode hybrid system that assists the engine during acceleration. The ride is smooth over rough roads and minor bumps, but turning requires caution because of its squishy ride.\n\nI had no trouble remembering that I was driving a massive truck; from the giant steering wheel to the giant side mirrors, everything about the Escalade Hybrid is huge. Except interior space. Oddly, for such a large vehicle, the interior felt cramped. This SUV feels wider than it is long, with a third row that is fit only for children, and virtually no cargo space when the third row is in place.\n\nI got lots of looks and comments during my week in the Escalade Hybrid, and I spent a lot of time shaking my head and trying to see the appeal. There is a bunch of technology in the Escalade, but none of it seems to integrate well. It’s like Caddy just tossed in a long list of options without thinking how they would be used. There are two different buttons to open and close the sunroof. There is a great remote-start function, but the Escalade Hybrid still uses an old-school key. Even though you can start the car from your living room via the key fob, you still need to insert a key and turn it to drive off in the Escalade Hybrid. You get OnStar with Turn-by-Turn Navigation in the Escalade Hybrid, but there’s also a DVD-based navigation system. Cadillac was clearly swinging for the fences with this Escalade, but, wow, did they miss with me. This is one trend I’m happy to avoid.\n\nExterior\n\nIf you go for big, shiny and flashy, then the Escalade is for you. It’s huge; it commands the road and demands to be noticed. Helping out with that is the chrome that virtually drips off the SUV’s body like tinsel on a Christmas tree. A massive five-corner chrome grille with the Cadillac emblem in the center dominates the front of the Escalade Hybrid. Enormous, rectangular, vertical bi-xenon headlights own the corners, and a fearless front bumper sports a couple of fog lights that look teeny by comparison.\n\nThe hybrid’s profile is equally shiny, with chrome trim on the windows, door handles, side mirrors, running board and roof rack. What really catch the eye are the 22-inch chromed aluminum wheels. Woooo, fancy! The rear of the Escalade has its share of shine, as well. There’s a wide piece of chrome trim above the license plate, and the step of the tailgate is also chrome. Just for good measure, the rear wiper has a narrow strip of chrome trim. When the sun is shining, the Escalade can be blinding.\n\nThe Escalade Hybrid gets some added shine with chrome and enamel “Hybrid” badges on the front-quarter panels and C-pillars, and there’s also a giant decal that runs along the bottom of the doors. There’s another “Hybrid” badge on the tailgate and another decal on the rear window of the Escalade Hybrid, just in case you missed the other six. Cadillac wants to make sure that everyone knows that this SUV is no gas-guzzler. (Except it is.)\n\nBecause this SUV is so huge, Caddy helps out with things like running boards and wide-opening doors. Getting in and out was easy for me and my kids. The doors aren’t too heavy for little arms to manage, and the power liftgate removes one more struggle from my day. The rear window also opens separately from the rest of the tailgate, although I don’t really see the advantage of that.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\n\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Some\n\nInterior\n\nWhen I first got into the Escalde Hybrid, I thought, “Wow, that’s a lot of plastic!” As I spent more time in it, I found even more plastic. I didn’t know what was the bigger contradiction: all the plastic in a supposedly “green” vehicle or all the plastic in a supposedly “luxury” vehicle. I’m not talking about cleverly disguised plastic that’s textured and painted; I’m talking about cheap, lightweight, molded plastic. The bottom half of the doors are plastic. The door bins are molded plastic. The fake wood trim is “tap, tap,” yep, plastic. The center instrument stack is set in flat, black plastic.\n\nThe seats and center armrest are covered in a supple leather. The front seats are heated and cooled, and they adjust in 14 ways, including height. The pedals also are power adjustable, and when you factor in the power tilt steering wheel, finding the perfect driving position is easy for drivers of any size. The steering wheel is leather-wrapped and has controls for the audio system and the Bluetooth connection. I had no problem setting things up, and my phone worked well.\n\nA large color touch-screen provides navigation and traffic information; it also shows a graphical representation of the SUV’s hybrid system. The Escalade Hybrid comes with satellite radio, an MP3 jack and a six-disc CD changer. The touch-screen system’s panel seemed clumsy and old-fashioned in its design. The DVD-driven navigation system didn’t seem to be well-planned either. A drive just below the touch-screen houses the map info, and I could hear it running as soon as I started the car. Most navigation systems are housed somewhere out of the way; with little people who like to press buttons in the car, I think out of the way is generally a good idea.\n\nStorage isn’t a problem in the Escalade. There are plenty of cupholders and bottleholders. A decent-sized center console bin holds all the essentials; the top of the large armrest is a great place to set electronics. There are two seatback pockets and four door bins.\n\nThe second row folds and tilts to provide access to the third row, but it’s heavy and cumbersome to use. Usually, my kids had jumped over the seatbacks long before I had managed to tilt the second-row seats. I also wasn’t fond of the rear seat belts. They have a cozy little pocket to hide in and tend to flop around while little ones are trying to buckle up.\n\nThere was plenty of room in both the second and third rows for child-safety seats, and a rear-facing infant-safety seat could easily fit in the second row. The Latch connectors are easy to access and not hidden at all.\n\nThe third row is fairly mediocre. It only sits about 3 inches off the floor, so legroom is nonexistent. I’d feel awful asking an adult to sit back there. It was bad enough when I climbed back there to check it out. I almost couldn’t get out! When the third row is in place, there’s almost no cargo room. I could fit a few grocery bags or backpacks back there, but that was it. Folding the third-row seats is a chore, as well. It’s a two-part process that involves folding the seats, then tilting them forward. It’s awkward and clumsy and leaves large tracks on the cargo floor – just perfect for collecting gunk – instead of a nice, smooth floor like in other SUVs.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\nSafety\n\nCadillac has included some of the latest safety features in the Escalade Hybrid. It has traction control and stability control to make sure all four wheels are doing their jobs. Its four-disc antilock brakes are powerful enough to bring this beast to a stop when you need to.\n\nBi-xenon headlights illuminate the road ahead, and a blind spot warning system helps you be aware of what’s around you. A backup camera and rear sensors warn you about objects or people that are behind the SUV, and they help to greatly improve this SUV’s not-so-great visibility. The Escalade Hybrid’s wipers come on automatically when they sense rain and have heated washer fluid to keep the windshield clear in the iciest weather.\n\nThe Escalade Hybrid has front-impact airbags for the front passengers and side curtain airbags for all three rows of seats. However, it doesn’t have side-impact airbags, which is something we’d like Cadillac to improve upon.\n\nFAMILY LIFESTAGE\n\nIn Diapers: Easily accessible Latch connectors and wide seating makes it easy to install child-safety seats.\n\nIn School: Running boards make it easy for kids to climb in, but floppy seat belts provide challenges inside.\n\nTeens: It’s got a coolness factor of 10.",

      "expert_review": "It’s like driving an oxymoron: A giant SUV whirling along on just electric power.\n\nBut that’s what the 2011 Cadillac Escalade hybrid does.\n\nIt quietly uses its gas-electric hybrid powertrain to whisk away the driver and up to seven other people in more style and luxury than anyone deserves â€” except of course, Cadillac owners. If anyone is looking for one reason to give rich people a tax break, look no farther than the front bumper of this fantastic SUV.\n\nFor a brand dead set on taking on the luxury European carmakers, this car has no place in that lineup. Cadillac’s cars are sleek and sporty. They want to attack corners and then dart away into the night. The Escalade has none of those Euro-centric charms, sitting atop the Crest and Wreath food chain.\n\nThat’s why I like it so much. From its massive grille to its giant vertical tail lights, the Escalade hybrid sticks out like a Yank at a World Cup match. It’s brash and bold and probably wears white socks when it wants to be comfortable. It’s the Ugly American everyone hates because they really like it.\n\nThey should: This SUV is very likeable. It may be big, but it still gets decent gas mileage â€” its 20 miles per gallon in the city matches the likes of many midsize sedans â€” and its 23 mpg on the highway shows that hybrids are not strictly city crawlers.\n\nYes, the Aniline leather encased interior is supple and over the top at the same time â€” but isn’t that what luxury is about? My ultra high-end Platinum hybrid edition costs $89,000; it better offer me out-of-this-world luxury. If we lived in a utilitarian world, all vehicles would ride around on 15-inch steel wheels and every vehicle would be red.\n\nThe Escalade hybrid flaunts its 22-inch big wheels and glides with just the right touch of arrogance that says, “I’ve made it, you haven’t, now get out of my way.” Is anything more American?\n\nIf this SUV were an airline mileage card, I’d always get bumped to first class and even get a special little lounge to rest my frightened bones after an enhanced pat down.\n\nThen again, if I owned the Escalade Hybrid Platinum, why fly?\n\nJust do the math: The 1,150-mile trip from Detroit to Orlando would only cost $150 in the Escalade hybrid, burning up 50 gallons of fuel at 23 mpg on the highway. A single plane ticket costs more and, in the Escalade, I could take my six closest friends, have the legroom of a king and magnetic ride control all the way there. (I mention six friends, because I like the Escalade more with the captain’s chairs in the second row. If you have the one with a bench seat in the second row, you can seat a total of eight people.)Either way, though, the Escalade hybrid is no muss, no fuss and no TSA.\n\nPlus, the ride literally glides along the highway. The 6-liter engine and electric motor produce absolutely silky smooth acceleration. At low speed, the electric motor alone can propel the Escalade hybrid, using no gasoline whatsoever, which is quite a feat considering this SUV can weigh as much as three tons.\n\nThe Magnetic Ride Control should change its name to Magical Ride Control because of the way it uses a magneto-rheological fluid to adjust the dampening system in about 5 milliseconds. It’s constantly reading the road and smoothing out the ride.\n\nThe electric rack-in-pinion steering feels exact without feeling overbearing. The Escalade is surprisingly easy to maneuver, and the advantage of the electric motor operating the steering system means it can tighten up at higher speeds and loosen up when silently cruising around parking lots.\n\nThe regenerative braking â€” that system that stores the energy normally lost as heat during braking but instead, converts to electricity and then stores it back in the batteries â€” is unnoticeable.\n\nThe Escalade hybrid feels just like the regular Escalade, but still, it feels better.\n\nThe ride is quieter and the performance just as good.\n\nPlus, the exterior is just downright beautiful. Even the regular non-hybrid Escalade denotes power and luxury. Its big offensive grille dominates anyone’s rearview mirror, and the little hybrid badges let people know you’re driving a hybrid â€” and if that wasn’t important, no one would put the word “hybrid” on outside of their car.\n\nBut the real story of the Escalade hybrid is inside the cabin.\n\nFor the 2011 model year, Cadillac has added additional sound dampening throughout the cabin adding a new, laminated windshield and front side windows, as well as other changes inside and out to cut off the noisy outside world.\n\nThe entire cabin feels luxurious. The big front seats are comfortable and can be adjusted into almost any configuration conceived. The second row seats are just as nice as the front, with the optional DVD entertainment system screens mounted directly into the back of the headrest of the front seats.\n\nThe leather-covered dash features olive ash and walnut burl wood trim and touches of aluminum throughout. Nearly everything comes standard on the Escalade hybrid Platinum â€” as the name might suggest. From heated and cooled cup holders to the power lift gate that opens and closes at the touch of a button, it’s luxury at your finger tips. Drivers and passengers feel pampered the moment they get in until the moment they hear the electric running board open up outside the vehicle, gracefully allowing for an easy exit.\n\nIt’s also just a little obscene which makes it so good and bad at the same time â€” and American to its core. It’s easily the Cadillac of Cadillacs.\n\nsburgess@detnews.com (313) 223-3217",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nCadillac’s eight-seat Escalade Hybrid uses GM’s 2-Mode Hybrid system to reduce fuel consumption yet retain the traditional capabilities of a full-size SUV. It’s available in rear- or four-wheel-drive form, and its hybrid system works with a 6.0-liter V-8 gasoline engine. Primary competitors include the related Chevrolet Tahoe Hybrid and GMC Yukon Hybrid.\nNew for 2013\nThere are no significant changes for 2013.\nExteriorThe overall shape of the Escalade Hybrid differs little from its conventional counterpart, but Cadillac has added hybrid badges to the front fenders, C-pillars and liftgate. With all that extra trim work, there won’t be any question in the minds of passers-by as to what type of vehicle you’re driving. Exterior features include:\n\n\nStandard 22-inch chrome wheels\nStandard power liftgate\nStandard xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights\nOptional LED headlights\nOptional power-retractable running boards\n\nInteriorThe cabin is largely the same as a regular Escalade’s, but there are a few hybrid-specific features. The Escalade Hybrid’s instrument cluster gains an additional gauge that monitors the efficiency of the vehicle, and the instrument panel gets some hybrid graphics, too. The standard navigation system screen can display a graphical representation of the hybrid system and its operation. Interior features include:\n\n\nStandard leather interior\nThree rows of seats accommodate up to eight\nStandard power front seats\nStandard heated and cooled front seats\nStandard tri-zone automatic climate control\nStandard USB/iPod port\nAvailable heated and cooled cupholders\n\nUnder the HoodThe 2-Mode Hybrid system allows the Escalade Hybrid to accelerate from a stop and cruise at slow speeds on electric power alone. When more power is needed, the gas engine will kick on to provide supplementary power. Like most hybrids, the Escalade Hybrid captures energy during braking and stores it in the hybrid battery pack for later use. Free scheduled maintenance for four years or 50,000 miles is included. Mechanical features include:\n\n\n332-horsepower, 6.0-liter V-8 engine\nEngine uses regular gas\nAutomatic transmission incorporates two electric motors\nStandard Magnetic Ride Control replaces mechanical shock absorbers with electronically controlled shocks that GM says react to the road more quickly\n5,800-pound (2WD) or 5,600-pound (4WD) towing capacity\n\nSafetyStandard safety features include:\n\n\nAntilock brakes\nElectronic stability system with rollover-mitigation technology\nSide-impact airbags for the front seats\nThree-row side curtain airbags\nRear parking sensors\nBackup camera",

      "expert_review": "Do you ever have those days as a parent when you just wish you had an extra hand or two? If you have a load of bucks to spend, the 2010 Cadillac Escalade Hybrid will not only lend you that hand but do it in total luxury and style. You’ll feel like a rock star — an environmentally conscious one no less — whether driving the Escalade Hybrid with or without the kiddos.\n\nThe Escalade Hybrid base model has an MSRP of $73,425. My rear-wheel-drive test car had the top-of-the-line Platinum trim and cost $86,175, which is the price of a small house in some parts of the country. It’s a lot of money, but it’d be worth it after considering how much easier this SUV made my life. That’s assuming I had that kind of dough to spend on a car.\n\nSure, the Escalade is a humongous SUV, but it’s something I could get used to driving if I needed all that space on a regular basis. Considering its size, it has a pretty tight turning radius, so pulling a U-turn at the end of the carpool lane was never an issue. Not only is this a large SUV, it’s also tall and you get a bit of the roly-poly feel you’d expect when cornering.\n\nAccelerating in the Escalade Hybrid is a surprising treat, though. You’d think it’d feel heavy and sluggish, but it doesn’t. It’s quick on its feet and responsive; the SUV’s hybrid-ness is seamless enough that the average driver wouldn’t even notice it switch from gas to electric power and back again. Braking felt a little heavy, but what do you expect when trying to stop that much metal?\n\nEXTERIOR\nNobody can doubt the sex appeal and versatility of the Cadillac Escalade Hybrid. You can roll onto a Hollywood lot with the stereo’s base booming or a school parking lot and feel at home. My test car was decked out in Silver Lining paint, a pearly light silver color that was all class and no clash.\n\nWith the blingy-but-not-overdone hybrid badging on the outside, I wasn’t scowled at for driving such a fuel beast. The Escalade Hybrid has a 332-hp, 6.0-liter V-8 engine that’s paired to an electric motor, which allows the SUV to stop and cruise at slow speeds on electric power only. The Escalade Hybrid’s 2-Mode Hybrid technology improves the SUV’s fuel economy significantly in city driving over its non-hybrid model, which gets an EPA-estimated 14/20 mpg city/highway. Don’t get too excited, though, this is no Toyota Prius. My rear-wheel-drive Escalade Hybrid gets an EPA-estimated 21/22 mpg.\n\nApproaching the Escalade Hybrid is like having the red carpet rolled out for you. Opening any of the doors also folds out the power-retractable running boards, so passengers young and old can climb in easily. The grab handle placement on the inside of the B-pillar helps even more. Have an armful of kids and groceries to load up? A press of the key fob opens the liftgate automatically for you. Want to cool the car down before Grandma gets in? Another press of the key fob starts the car and adjusts it to your preferred temperature settings.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Excellent\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nINTERIOR\nThe inside of the Escalade Hybrid is what really stands out as great — well, mostly great. In the front there’s plenty of storage to keep family life organized. The in-door storage with a bottleholder in both front doors are great junk collectors. A huge, cavernous center console is large enough to stash a laptop, but I used it to keep the two wireless headphones tucked away.\n\nMy favorite feature of all is the heated and cooled cupholders. With the push of a button, your tall soy decaf caramel Frappucino will stay icy that much longer. Want your booty cool, too? Heated and cooled front seats are standard.\n\nIn the second row, two cupholders are in the center armrest and two more are stashed at the base of the center console. Heated seats are in the second-row outboard positions. Although the second row doesn’t slide back and forth, there’s so much legroom back there that my daughters used it as their personal changing room when we headed downtown to the theater after they got out of dance-team practice. Not while I was driving. Safety first.\n\nAccess to the third row could definitely use improvement. The second-row outboard seats fold first and then tumble forward to create a passageway. However, the tumbling action requires a bit of muscle power, something kids won’t be able to accomplish on their own. For $80,000-plus, I want this to be power-folding. The third row is built for little ones with little legs. I sat back there and had my knees up to my chest. However, there’s enough width to comfortably accommodate three kids.\n\nThe second- and third-row passengers will be thrilled by the entertainment options in the Escalade. My test car came equipped with not one but three screens for watching DVDs or playing video games; it had an 8-inch flip-down overhead screen in the second row and two 7-inch screens in the back of the front seat head restraints.\n\nThe cargo space behind the third row is puny; there’s enough space for a light grocery run and an umbrella stroller, but not much more than that. Expanding the cargo space isn’t simple, either. You can fold the back of the third row down, but this doesn’t create a flat surface. To get more usable cargo space you have to tumble it forward like the second-row seats. Who wants to struggle with that? Many competitors have a fold-flat third row; surely Cadillac can figure out how to do it, too.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore\n\nSAFETY\nThere’s so much space in this car that an indefinite number of child-safety-seat configurations is possible. While there are only two sets of easy-to-use Latch connectors in the second row (center and right outboard positions), there’s plenty of legroom for rear-facing infant-safety seats, and there’s enough width in either the second or third rows to really pack the car seats in. The seat belt buckle receptors are all on flimsy bases (a pet peeve), but the wide seats allowed room for little ones in booster seats to buckle up on their own with enough space to maneuver their little hands.\n\nThe Escalade Hybrid doesn’t skimp on standard safety features. It has antilock brakes, traction control and an electronic stability system with anti-roll control. It also has standard front- and side-impact airbags for the first row and side curtain airbags for all three rows of seats.\n\nIn such a large SUV, blind spots can really be a problem, so I appreciated the standard blind spot warning system. A lighted icon on the side mirror alerted me if there was a car in my blind spot, while a standard backup camera and ultrasonic park assist system gave me an extra set of eyes in the back of my head. I’d have loved park assist for the front of the car, as well.\n\nBecause it’s a GM product, the Cadillac Escalade Hybrid is equipped with my favorite safety feature of all time, OnStar communication system, giving you access to a live guardian-angel-like operator to help out in any number of potential safety, maintenance or concierge scenarios.\n\nGet more safety information about the Cadillac Escalade Hybrid here.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nCadillac’s eight-seat Escalade Hybrid uses GM’s 2-Mode Hybrid system to reduce fuel consumption yet retain the traditional capabilities of a full-size SUV. It’s available in rear- or four-wheel-drive form, and its hybrid system works with a 6.0-liter V-8 gasoline engine. Primary competitors include the related Chevrolet Tahoe Hybrid and GMC Yukon Hybrid.\nNew for 2012Apart from some enhancements to the navigation system and more anti-theft features, there are no significant changes for 2012.ExteriorThe overall shape of the Escalade Hybrid differs little from its conventional counterpart, but Cadillac has added hybrid badges to the front fenders, C-pillars and liftgate. With all that extra trim work, there won’t be any question in the minds of passers-by as to what type of vehicle you’re driving. Exterior features include:\n\nStandard 22-inch chrome wheels\nStandard power liftgate\nStandard xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights \nOptional LED headlights\nOptional power-retractable running boards\nStandard rear parking sensors and backup camera\n\nInteriorThe cabin is largely the same as a regular Escalade’s, but there are a few hybrid-specific features. The Escalade Hybrid’s instrument cluster gains an additional gauge that monitors the efficiency of the vehicle, and the instrument panel gets some hybrid graphics, too. The standard navigation system screen can display a graphical representation of the hybrid system and its operation. Interior features include:\n\nStandard leather interior\nThree rows of seats accommodate up to eight\nStandard power front seats\nStandard heated and cooled front seats\nAvailable heated second-row outboard seats\nStandard tri-zone automatic climate control\nAvailable moonroof\nAvailable heated and cooled cupholders\nStandard USB/iPod port\n\nUnder the HoodThe 2-Mode Hybrid system allows the Escalade Hybrid to accelerate from a stop and cruise at slow speeds on electric power alone. When more power is needed, the gas engine will kick on to provide supplementary power. Like most hybrids, the Escalade Hybrid captures energy during braking and stores it in the hybrid battery pack for later use. Free scheduled maintenance for four years or 50,000 miles is included.
