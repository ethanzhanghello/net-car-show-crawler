      "expert_review": "After receiving an interior overhaul for the 2025 model year that saw the installation of a 33-inch digital dashboard combining the instrument cluster and infotainment touchscreen, the Cadillac CT5 rolls into 2026 unchanged. But, in V-Series Blackwing form, the CT5 remains a standout in one area that is absolutely crucial to hardcore enthusiasts: The CT5-V Blackwing is the last mid-size sports sedan with an available six-speed manual transmission. For 2026, the CT5 starts at $50,095 (all prices include $1,495 destination charge).\n\nRelated: Which New Cars Have Manual Transmissions?\n\nRelease Date and Pricing\n\nThe 2026 Cadillac CT5 is on sale now. Full line pricing is as follows; the Blackwing’s pricing includes gas-guzzler tax.\n\nPremium Luxury: $50,095\nSport: $51,095\nV-Series: $59,095\nV-Series Blackwing: $101,195\nWhat Are the 2026 CT5’s Trim Levels?\n\nAs Cadillac’s entry in the popular mid-size luxury sedan class, the CT5 features an extensive list of standard equipment. It rides on 18-inch wheels and includes LED exterior lighting, rain-sensing windshield wipers, keyless entry and start, and remote start. Leather upholstery is standard, with power-adjustable, heated, ventilated and massaging front seats. Also standard are a heated steering wheel, dual-zone automatic climate control, a power tilt/telescoping steering column, wireless device charging, 15 speakers and ambient lighting. The 33-inch dash display features wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.\n\nThe Sport trim is largely the same as the Premium Luxury, but it includes black window trim, 19-inch wheels, and a body kit including a unique front bumper, sill extensions and a body-color spoiler. Inside, the Sport gets aluminum pedals and synthetic leather upholstery, but it does not have ventilated front seats.\n\nCadillac hones the CT5 V-Series for performance, fitting a sport suspension with adaptive dampers, Brembo front brakes, a limited-slip rear differential and dark-finish 19-inch wheels wrapped in summer performance tires. GM’s Performance Traction Management allows drivers more stability control choices, while launch control optimizes the vehicle for quick acceleration from a stop. Inside, the V features sport front seats and a 15-speaker AKG audio system.\n\nBuilding off the V-Series foundation, the Blackwing features an even more aggressive suspension, widened front fenders, a unique front bumper with a splitter, Brembo front and rear brakes, a differential cooler, a hands-free power trunk lid and upgraded headlights that turn with the steering wheel. Inside, the perforated leather and ventilated front seats return, and Cadillac fits a thick-rim sport steering wheel, head-up display, 16-speaker AKG sound system, and Performance Data Recorder to shoot video and log data when on a racetrack.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2025 Cadillac CT5-V, CT5-V Blackwing Refreshed With In-Car Driving Coach\n2025 Cadillac CT5 Up Close: Be Happy It’s Still Here\nCadillac Reveals Precision Package for 2025 CT5-V Blackwing\nResearch the Cadillac CT5\nFind Your Next Car\nStandard and Available Safety Features\n\nAside from the Blackwing’s head-up display, nearly all safety tech available on the CT5 is standard across the lineup. That’s because GM’s Super Cruise hands-free semi-autonomous highway-driving tech is standard, and the technologies that feed into it also enable numerous other functions. The list includes forward collision warning with pedestrian and bicyclist detection, automatic emergency braking, blind spot intervention, front and rear cross-traffic alert with automatic braking, adaptive cruise control, a driver attention monitor, a 360-degree parking camera and road-sign recognition. Automated parking is also standard.\n\nThe one exception is the Blackwing with its standard six-speed manual, which forfeits many of the systems whose operation would be complicated by the vehicle’s computers not having full control over the transmission, including Super Cruise and autonomous parking. (Opting for the automatic transmission, however, adds those functions back in.) Instead, the manual Blackwing gets lane departure steering assist and front and rear parking sensors.\n\nWhat Are the 2026 CT5’s Powertrain Specs and MPG?\n\nThe standard engine in the CT5 is a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder with 237 horsepower and 258 pounds-feet of torque. A 335-hp, twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 is available in the Premium Luxury for $3,500 and makes 405 pounds-feet. The twin-turbo 3.0-liter also powers the CT5-V, but with an additional 25 hp, for a total of 360; torque is unchanged. A massive, supercharged 6.2-liter V-8 tortures the Blackwing’s rear tires with 668 hp and 659 pounds-feet.\n\nA 10-speed automatic transmission is standard on every CT5 except the Blackwing, which comes with a six-speed manual; the 10-speed costs $5,875 on the Blackwing. Rear-wheel drive is standard on every CT5, and all-wheel drive is an additional $2,000 on the Premium Luxury, Sport and V-Series but is not available on the Blackwing.\n\nThough official EPA ratings for the 2026 CT5 lineup are not yet available, they should stay the same as the 2025 model’s. The 2025 2.0-liter CT5 returns an EPA-rated 23/32/26 mpg city/highway/combined with RWD and 21/30/25 with AWD. With the twin-turbo 3.0-liter, the regular CT5 is rated at 19/28/22 with rear-drive and 18/26/21 with AWD. The V-Series slips to 18/27/21 with rear-drive and 17/26/20 with AWD. With either the six-speed manual transmission or the 10-speed automatic, the Blackwing returns 13/20/15 mpg.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Look, we all know sedans aren’t long for this world. GM, Cadillac’s parent company, has been steadily phasing them out for a while now for most of its brands. Buick doesn’t have any anymore, Chevy’s down to just the Malibu (and not for long), and Cadillac has three: the CT4, CT5 and upcoming $300,000-plus Celestiq ultra-luxury electric vehicle. But instead of just dropping its sedans like the rest of GM’s brands, Cadillac saw fit to refresh one of them, the CT5, with some useful upgrades and subtle styling improvements.\n\nRelated: More 2023 Detroit Auto Show Coverage\n\nThe CT5 might not be around much longer, who knows. But we’ll rejoice that it’s here now and still has Cadillac’s attention. The updates the brand has made for the 2025 model year make what is already an outstanding sedan even more user-friendly, and that should be celebrated.\n\nCatching Up With the Rest of the Lineup\n\nFirst, there’s the styling, which gets a redo to give the CT5’s face more of a cohesive look with the rest of Cadillac’s changing lineup. Seeing as how everything new to the brand seems to be on the electric side of the aisle, the big grille that’s not necessary on its EV brothers actually does seem to serve a purpose here. But flanked as it is by new headlight designs that retain the traditional Cadillac light-pipe LED running lights, the new grille looks good on the CT5 — maybe even better than how the new designs look on SUVs like the Lyriq or Escalade IQ EV.\n\nThe big news is inside, however, where the dashboard gets a complete refresh to bring it in line with other Cadillac interiors. The new dash features a single glass-pane display that sweeps across the dashtop and incorporates both the gauge cluster and multimedia screen. It’s resplendent in 9K resolution, making for super crisp images and slick-looking displays. The new Google operating system is now present here, too, so if you have an Android device, you’ll feel right at home integrating everything into your techy ecosystem; if you have an Apple device, GM is still allowing CarPlay to be used for the time being, as it hasn’t phased that out yet (but it plans to with a switch to EV platforms in the next few years).\n\nSince the CT5’s powertrains are completely carried over and received no attention, there’s no need to mention them aside to say just that, and that they still are excellent.\n\nThe moral of the story with the new 2025 Cadillac CT5 is to enjoy it while you can. Enjoy having a sedan while sedans are still available, enjoy Apple CarPlay in a GM product while it’s still offered, and enjoy not being forced to buy an SUV if you’re interested in a Cadillac — because who knows for how much longer you’ll be able to.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2025 Cadillac CT5 Gets Big Face, Big Screen\n2020 Cadillac CT5 Review: Get the Turbo Six, When You Can Find One\n2023 Cadillac Lyriq Sings a Song of an All-Electric Future\n2023 Cadillac XT4 Adds Safety Equipment and New Colors, Starts at $37,490\nFind Your Next Car\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The 2023 Cadillac CT5 is entering the new model year with minor updates and an increased entry price of $39,590 (all prices include destination), aiming to stay fresh against segment rivals like the BMW 5 Series, Audi A5 and Mercedes-Benz E-Class.\n\nRelated: Which Cars Have Panoramic Moonroofs or Sunroofs?\n\nThe CT5’s exterior and interior styling carries over from the outgoing 2022 model, but for 2023, the standard CT5 lineup gains three new extra-cost exterior color choices: Argent Silver Metallic, Midnight Steel Metallic and Radiant Red Tintcoat. CT5-V and CT5-V Blackwing models largely follow the same core script but add a fourth color called Maverick Noir Frost. Blackwing models also add a newly standard rear pedestrian alert system and a Blackwing badge on the trunk lid.\n\nPowertrains also carry over, with a standard turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that makes 237 horsepower and 258 pounds-feet of torque. An optional twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 makes 335 hp in the standard CT5 and 360 hp in the V-Series. The range-topping CT5-V Blackwing is powered by a supercharged 6.2-liter V-8 that makes 668 hp and 659 pounds-feet of torque. A 10-speed automatic transmission is standard on nearly all variants except the Blackwing, which has a standard six-speed manual transmission that can be swapped out for the 10-speed automatic.\n\nPricing and Release Date\n\nThe 2023 Cadillac CT5 and CT5-V lineup are available at dealerships now. Rear-wheel drive is standard on the CT5, while all-wheel drive adds $2,000 to $3,090, depending on the powertrain; the CT5-V Blackwing is RWD only. The available twin-turbo 3.0-liter V-6 adds $3,500 to the Premium Luxury trim, and opting for an automatic in the CT5-V Blackwing costs $3,175.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Cadillac CT5?\n\nThe Cadillac CT5 is a five-seat luxury sedan available with a choice of three engines, including an absolute powerhouse of a supercharged 6.2-liter V-8 in the range-topping CT5-V Blackwing variant. With 668 horsepower and an available six-speed manual gearbox, the Blackwing is one of the quickest sedans available today. For those who don’t need tire-melting acceleration, the base engine is a 237-hp turbo four-cylinder paired to a 10-speed automatic. In the middle of the lineup is a twin-turbo 3.0-liter V-6 that makes 335 hp in standard tuning or 360 hp in the CT5-V. Rear-wheel drive is standard, though all-wheel drive can be added to any model in the range with the exception of the mighty Blackwing. The CT5’s rivals include the Audi A4, BMW 3 Series and Genesis G70.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Cadillac CT5?\n\nTo celebrate the 20th anniversary of its V performance sub-brand, Cadillac is offering four new colors on the CT5-V and CT5-V Blackwing along with subtle exterior badging to mark the occasion. The standard CT5 continues with no notable updates or changes.   \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Cadillac CT5 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nSynthetic leather upholstery\n10-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nWi-Fi hot spot \nWireless device charging\nBlind spot warning \nRear cross-traffic alert\nLane departure steering assist\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nRain-sensing wipers\nRear-seat reminder\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nLeather-trimmed seats\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nDigital instrument panel\nBose premium stereo\nNavigation\nHead-up display\n360-degree camera system\nSuper Cruise hands-free driver-assist system\nShould I Buy the 2024 Cadillac CT5?\n\nThe Cadillac CT5 certainly provides plenty of choices for a mid-size luxury sedan. From the base turbo four-cylinder with RWD up to the brutally fast (albeit very pricey) CT5-V Blackwing, this Cadillac sedan can be eminently practical or a high-speed roller coaster with seating for five. Available features like AWD and Cadillac’s highly regarded Super Cruise hands-free highway driving aid further bolster the CT5’s credentials.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2022 Cadillac CT5?\n\nThe Cadillac CT5 is a five-seat luxury sports sedan with rear- or all-wheel drive. It comes standard with a 237-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine; an optional twin-turbo 3.0-liter V-6 is rated at 335 hp in the Premium Luxury trim and 360 hp in the V-Series. Both engines work with a 10-speed automatic transmission. For even greater performance, there’s also a new CT5-V Blackwing, which is powered by a 668-hp, supercharged 6.2-liter V-8. \n\nCompetitors include the BMW 3 Series, Genesis G70 and Audi A4. The CT5 has 13.3 cubic feet of trunk space, according to Cars.com’s cargo measurements. You can see how it scored in our Car Seat Check here.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2022 Cadillac CT5?\n\nOther than the addition of the CT5-V Blackwing at the top of the lineup, there are no significant changes this year. \n\nWhat Features in the 2022 Cadillac CT5 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nLED headlights \nRemote start \n10-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nWi-Fi hot spot (data subscription required after trial)\nWireless device charging\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nLane keep assist\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nPanoramic moonroof\nLeather-trimmed seats\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nDigital instrument panel\nBose premium stereo\nNavigation\nHead-up display\n360-degree camera system\nSuper Cruise hands-free driver-assist system\nShould I Buy the 2022 Cadillac CT5?\n\nThe Cadillac CT5 offers a driving experience that’s relaxed and refined, with sportier trim levels delivering a higher degree of performance. While the cabin is an improvement over previous Cadillac sedans, there are some areas that still look low-grade, and the trunk is on the small side. The availability of all-wheel drive is a plus, however, as is the car’s large backseat.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Starting $10,000 less than the Cadillac CTS it replaces, the new 2020 Cadillac CT5 maintains a generously sized interior in a more affordable package. \n\nVersus the competition: The CT5’s turbo V-6 and generous size for its price are a rarity, though there are some questionable interior choices for a luxury car. \n\nThe Cadillac CTS is finito for 2020, replaced by the Cadillac CT5, which has been redesigned and repositioned to be a more appropriate competitor for compact luxury sedans like the BMW 3 Series, Audi A4 and Mercedes-Benz C-Class. The Cadillac CT5 has standout attributes, but that doesn’t make it any less of an odd duck compared with the CTS; in fact, its awkward place in the class is what defines the CT5.\n\nRelated: 2020 Cadillac CT5-V Test Drive: Great Car, Awful Timing\n\nDespite a distinct pricing advantage compared with its compact rivals — it starts at $37,890 with destination charge — the CT5 has a nearly identical footprint and interior volume as pricier mid-size luxo-sedans like the BMW 5 Series, Audi A6 and Mercedes-Benz E-Class. The CT5 seems to be taking a page from the Book of Genesis — the version written by Hyundai, that is — offering a large car at a low price. That said, even Genesis seems to be changing its ways, given the redesigned 2021 Genesis G80 is now priced closer to the traditional mid-sizers, leaving a nice spot for the CT5.  \n\nAnother distinct difference between the CT5 and its German rivals is that it lets you add its more powerful optional engine without forcing you into an entire performance package. Opting for a BMW M340i, Audi S4 or Mercedes-AMG C43 is the only way to get competitors’ up-level turbo-six engines, but they also come with sport suspensions and seats that can compromise comfort — and your wallet. Cadillac has a competitor for those hotter versions — the CT5-V, which has 360 horsepower (see the review) — but it also offers a less spicy 335-hp 3.0-liter as an upgrade over the 237-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter base engine.\n\nFor this review, I tested a CT5 Premium Luxury 3.0-liter with all-wheel drive that was sparsely optioned, with a final price tag of $52,155. For comparison, the last BMW 3 Series we tested were loaded versions of the turbo four-cylinder 330i and M340i, which stickered at $57,000 and $70,000, respectively.\n\n2020 Cadillac CT5 | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\nSizable Interior, Questionable Appointments\n\nAt 193.8 inches long, the CT5 comes within an inch of those mid-size German sedans, and it’s 6 to 9 inches longer than a 3 Series, A4 or C-Class. Some of that length is found in the backseat, which has plenty of legroom for passengers. I was perfectly comfortable in the backseat, and I’m a 6-foot-tall man who carries his height in his legs. I also carted around a rear-facing convertible child seat that left heaps of room for the front passenger. Overall comfort was exceptional compared with competing vehicles; in a 330i, for example, my wife had very little front legroom with the same car seat installed behind it. Taller rear passengers should note, however, that I was at the upper limits of the Cadillac’s backseat headroom.\n\n2020 Cadillac CT5 | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nThe Cadillac’s size advantage, however, is contrasted by its odd choices when it comes to interior styling and quality. The CT5’s interior styling doesn’t take any wild swings from its predecessor, and there’s no digital dashboard like you’ll find in the 3 Series, or the previous CTS; one will be available in the CT5 starting in 2021. There aren’t any standout touches, like the available quilted Nappa leather interior in the Genesis G70.\n\n2014 Cadillac CTS (top); 2020 Cadillac CT5 (bottom) | Cars.com photos by Evan Sears and Joe Bruzek\n\nThe CT5’s overall vibe is the same conservative styling as the CTS, where the most notable characteristic is the center touchscreen and controls, though this time it’s in a good way. The former touch-sensitive controls are replaced by genuine buttons and a volume and tuning knob. One of my largest criticisms of Cadillac’s capacitive-control design — besides it simply not working — was that it felt cheap because the whole panel flexed when a button was pressed. Now, with real buttons, there’s no such concern.\n\nThe touchscreen has a redundant dial controller rearward of the gear selector, but I didn’t use it because I got everything I needed from the touchscreen. It’s a good alternative for those with limited mobility or short arms. The new electronic gear selector is a plastic blob on the center console; I miss the stitched upholstery and mechanical feel of the CTS’ traditional gear selector. Competitors’ electric gear selectors are prettied up a bit more than the CT5’s.\n\n2020 Cadillac CT5 | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nThe CT5 Premium Luxury trim I tested had real leather seats (leatherette is standard) and interior materials that were mostly good for the class, like soft-touch padding on the upper doors and the console’s nicely grained wrap. This also translates to the backseat, where there’s very little falloff in materials quality. One odd choice, however, was the plastic marbled trim on the door panels and dashboard of my test car’s Sahara Beige interior. It had a bright sheen and didn’t look like it was imitating wood, metal or carbon fiber. It was most similar to the trim you’d see in a cheaper car, where it’s more of an afterthought than a highlight. There are a number of accent trims available, though, depending on interior color and package, so perhaps those are more convincing. \n\n2020 Cadillac CT5 | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\nA Six You Might Not Be Able to Get, At First\n\nWhat I don’t need to be convinced of is that the CT5’s twin-turbo V-6 is a solid pick, but it might be a rare one. As of publication, there were about 2,600 CT5s in Cars.com’s national inventory, of which 2,400 have the four-cylinder and 200 have the six-cylinder. The CT5 launched late in 2019 with the four-cylinder, and six-cylinders only started shipping in early 2020 just as the COVID-19 pandemic halted production. Cadillac anticipates six-cylinder inventory to eventually make up 20-30% of CT5s, but for now, at least, the V-6 isn’t widely available. \n\nThe CT5’s twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 makes 335 hp and 405 pounds-feet of torque that scoot the all-wheel-drive CT5 with a refined vigor and minimal delay. Cadillac says the CT5’s V-6 does 0-60 mph in 4.9 seconds, compared with the four-cylinder’s 6.6 seconds — a sizable difference. We found the four-cylinder to be underwhelming in the CT5, especially compared with BMW’s potent 330i base engine, whose 0-60-mph time we measured at 5.6 seconds.\n\nYou’ll pay for the 3.0’s performance at the pump, though. It’s rated 19/26/21 mpg city/highway/combined, versus the 2.0-liter’s EPA-estimated 23/32/26 mpg. At 15,000 miles a year and current prices for premium fuel (required for both), that could cost an extra $350 a year, according to the EPA. The V-6’s rating is also lower than comparable AWD six-cylinder competitors: the M340i is rated 25 mpg combined, the S4 is rated 23 mpg combined and the AMG C43 is rated 22 mpg combined.  \n\nThe powertrain experience is fairly seamless, with few hiccups from the 10-speed. I wanted more input on whether Performance Shift was activated or not; it’s denoted only by a green gear outline in the instrument cluster. Performance Shift holds gears longer, shifts firmer/faster and is automatically activated by throttle input, but that gave it a delay and sometimes inappropriate shifting for what I was demanding. Pontiacs used to have a Performance Shift button on the gear selector, which would be nice functionality to have again.\n\n2020 Cadillac CT5 | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nTour and Sport modes are activated by a toggle switch ahead of the gear selector. They adjust the expected parameters of engine and transmission responsiveness, as well as how the engine sounds through electronic augmentation via the sound system’s speakers. The 3.0-liter has a naturally tight, sharp soundtrack, so the electronic help comes across as natural and pleasing rather than artificial, as it does with many four-cylinders. \n\nChoosing Sport mode also changes how the brake pedal feels, thanks to a drive-by-wire braking system that replaces the traditional vacuum brake assist. It’s still using hydraulic fluid and lines for braking, but the boost in brake pressure now comes from an electric motor, not engine vacuum, and the brake pedal is electronic and can alter pedal feel. The difference in brake feel is most apparent in heavy braking use when quickly running up on a sharp corner, not during normal stop-and-go traffic. In Sport mode, the brake pedal’s action is a touch higher in the pedal stroke and pushes back more than in Tour mode. I’m still adjusting my own calibrations to these kinds of systems in non-hybrid or electric vehicles, but the ones in GM’s cars and trucks have a short, hard brake pedal that’s more binary than linear — except the 2020 Chevrolet Corvette, which has the most natural tuning of any GM vehicle I’ve experienced.\n\nSport Suspension Optional\n\nCadillac’s appropriately hyped Magnetic Ride Control is available only on the CT5-V, with unique suspension tuning, so what you get in the regular CT5 is a fixed-firmness, passive shock absorber package. It delivers a comfortable ride that communicates road feel without being jarring. It’s not a sport suspension, per se, but this is definitely modern Cadillac suspension tuning, more along the lines of the outgoing ATS and CTS, which were among the most dynamic sedans of their time. \n\nThe previous ATS and CTS were ahead of the competition in terms of giving you what you want from the steering wheel: enough road feel to be communicative but not high-strung, with light assist and quick-ratio steering. The CT5, as well as a CT4-V I drove at the same time, are missing some of that magic. The steering lacks on-center bite and has a slow steering ratio that takes too much steering angle to get a response from the front end. I experienced early understeer — possibly from the all-season tires and relaxed body control — but that concern could be addressed by the existence of the CT5-V, which is a milder sport package, like the former CTS V-Sport versus the powerhouse CTS-V. I caveat these impressions by stating both versions I drove were all-wheel drive. The all-wheel-drive CT5 has a fixed steering ratio versus the rear-wheel-drive CT5’s variable steering ratio, so perhaps the rear-wheel drive’s steering is more responsive, though I haven’t driven one to confirm. \n\nThe larger issue is that BMW is back, and in a bad way for Cadillac. Where Cadillac’s proficient handling package used to embarrass BMW’s, the BMW 3 Series has now found the edge it lost in its previous generation. Pitting the CT5 against a contemporary 3 Series, with or without the M Sport Package and with or without all-wheel drive, would not be a winning move for Cadillac. \n\nHowever, the CT5’s larger size and longer wheelbase deliver ride quality that’s sublime, if a little busy, with no jarring jolts over broken pavement. Helping the pleasant highway experience is minimal wind and road noise; any luxury automaker would be thrilled to have the CT5’s isolation. The cabin is well-sealed-off from the outside — most obviously when I took the CT5 through a car wash and it felt like the massive air dryer was a million miles away.\n\n2020 Cadillac CT5 | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\nIs The CT5 Worth the Money?\n\nThe six-cylinder CT5 isn’t at the level of its dedicated sport package compatriots — and it definitely doesn’t match the acceleration of the M340 — but it’s a happy alternative with an appropriate price tag: $52,155 as-tested, including destination charge and optional equipment. What the CT5 didn’t have at that price was adaptive cruise control, which is part of a Driver Assist and Advanced Security Package, or Super Cruise, Cadillac’s hands-free adaptive cruise control, which won’t be available on the CT5 until the 2021 model year. BMW’s Extended Traffic Jam Assistant — one of the only other hands-free systems out there — is available on the 3 Series. \n\nTwo features stood out in my testing, including a standard high-resolution backup camera that provided some of the best clarity around; a multiview 360-degree top-down system is optional. The other was in-car Wi-Fi, which seemed gimmicky at best in pre-pandemic times. Now, though, I used the CT5’s cellular Wi-Fi to remotely video conference from my laptop, and it delivered a presentable enough video feed. It’s not something I would have needed prior to 2020, but the CT5 made it doable. Almost all competitors offer in-car Wi-Fi, but what makes the CT5 stand out is that the backseat is a decently accommodating workstation; there’s even a USB-C outlet back there.  \n\nWith the optional V-6, the CT5 is a compelling offering that’s roomier than its competitors, and certainly a bargain buy when put up against other optional turbo-sixes. Our reviewers weren’t particularly thrilled with the CT5’s 2.0-liter, but the V-6 fills the gap without going overboard with firm suspension tuning or exorbitant cost. Pricing for the CT5 V-6 starts around $45,000 — competitive with the pricing of four-cylinder competitors — which means it’s even more unfortunate that this is the engine that makes the CT5, but will be hard to find until more fill the market.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Starting $10,000 less than the Cadillac CTS it replaces, the new 2020 Cadillac CT5 maintains a generously sized interior in a more affordable package. \n\nVersus the competition: The CT5’s turbo V-6 and generous size for its price are a rarity, though there are some questionable interior choices for a luxury car. \n\nThe Cadillac CTS is finito for 2020, replaced by the Cadillac CT5, which has been redesigned and repositioned to be a more appropriate competitor for compact luxury sedans like the BMW 3 Series, Audi A4 and Mercedes-Benz C-Class. The Cadillac CT5 has standout attributes, but that doesn’t make it any less of an odd duck compared with the CTS; in fact, its awkward place in the class is what defines the CT5.\n\nRelated: 2020 Cadillac CT5-V Test Drive: Great Car, Awful Timing\n\nDespite a distinct pricing advantage compared with its compact rivals — it starts at $37,890 with destination charge — the CT5 has a nearly identical footprint and interior volume as pricier mid-size luxo-sedans like the BMW 5 Series, Audi A6 and Mercedes-Benz E-Class. The CT5 seems to be taking a page from the Book of Genesis — the version written by Hyundai, that is — offering a large car at a low price. That said, even Genesis seems to be changing its ways, given the redesigned 2021 Genesis G80 is now priced closer to the traditional mid-sizers, leaving a nice spot for the CT5.  \n\nAnother distinct difference between the CT5 and its German rivals is that it lets you add its more powerful optional engine without forcing you into an entire performance package. Opting for a BMW M340i, Audi S4 or Mercedes-AMG C43 is the only way to get competitors’ up-level turbo-six engines, but they also come with sport suspensions and seats that can compromise comfort — and your wallet. Cadillac has a competitor for those hotter versions — the CT5-V, which has 360 horsepower (see the review) — but it also offers a less spicy 335-hp 3.0-liter as an upgrade over the 237-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter base engine.\n\nFor this review, I tested a CT5 Premium Luxury 3.0-liter with all-wheel drive that was sparsely optioned, with a final price tag of $52,155. For comparison, the last BMW 3 Series we tested were loaded versions of the turbo four-cylinder 330i and M340i, which stickered at $57,000 and $70,000, respectively.\n\n2020 Cadillac CT5 | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\nSizable Interior, Questionable Appointments\n\nAt 193.8 inches long, the CT5 comes within an inch of those mid-size German sedans, and it’s 6 to 9 inches longer than a 3 Series, A4 or C-Class. Some of that length is found in the backseat, which has plenty of legroom for passengers. I was perfectly comfortable in the backseat, and I’m a 6-foot-tall man who carries his height in his legs. I also carted around a rear-facing convertible child seat that left heaps of room for the front passenger. Overall comfort was exceptional compared with competing vehicles; in a 330i, for example, my wife had very little front legroom with the same car seat installed behind it. Taller rear passengers should note, however, that I was at the upper limits of the Cadillac’s backseat headroom.\n\n2020 Cadillac CT5 | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nThe Cadillac’s size advantage, however, is contrasted by its odd choices when it comes to interior styling and quality. The CT5’s interior styling doesn’t take any wild swings from its predecessor, and there’s no digital dashboard like you’ll find in the 3 Series, or the previous CTS; one will be available in the CT5 starting in 2021. There aren’t any standout touches, like the available quilted Nappa leather interior in the Genesis G70.\n\n2014 Cadillac CTS (top); 2020 Cadillac CT5 (bottom) | Cars.com photos by Evan Sears and Joe Bruzek\n\nThe CT5’s overall vibe is the same conservative styling as the CTS, where the most notable characteristic is the center touchscreen and controls, though this time it’s in a good way. The former touch-sensitive controls are replaced by genuine buttons and a volume and tuning knob. One of my largest criticisms of Cadillac’s capacitive-control design — besides it simply not working — was that it felt cheap because the whole panel flexed when a button was pressed. Now, with real buttons, there’s no such concern.\n\nThe touchscreen has a redundant dial controller rearward of the gear selector, but I didn’t use it because I got everything I needed from the touchscreen. It’s a good alternative for those with limited mobility or short arms. The new electronic gear selector is a plastic blob on the center console; I miss the stitched upholstery and mechanical feel of the CTS’ traditional gear selector. Competitors’ electric gear selectors are prettied up a bit more than the CT5’s.\n\n2020 Cadillac CT5 | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nThe CT5 Premium Luxury trim I tested had real leather seats (leatherette is standard) and interior materials that were mostly good for the class, like soft-touch padding on the upper doors and the console’s nicely grained wrap. This also translates to the backseat, where there’s very little falloff in materials quality. One odd choice, however, was the plastic marbled trim on the door panels and dashboard of my test car’s Sahara Beige interior. It had a bright sheen and didn’t look like it was imitating wood, metal or carbon fiber. It was most similar to the trim you’d see in a cheaper car, where it’s more of an afterthought than a highlight. There are a number of accent trims available, though, depending on interior color and package, so perhaps those are more convincing. \n\n2020 Cadillac CT5 | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\nA Six You Might Not Be Able to Get, At First\n\nWhat I don’t need to be convinced of is that the CT5’s twin-turbo V-6 is a solid pick, but it might be a rare one. As of publication, there were about 2,600 CT5s in Cars.com’s national inventory, of which 2,400 have the four-cylinder and 200 have the six-cylinder. The CT5 launched late in 2019 with the four-cylinder, and six-cylinders only started shipping in early 2020 just as the COVID-19 pandemic halted production. Cadillac anticipates six-cylinder inventory to eventually make up 20-30% of CT5s, but for now, at least, the V-6 isn’t widely available. \n\nThe CT5’s twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 makes 335 hp and 405 pounds-feet of torque that scoot the all-wheel-drive CT5 with a refined vigor and minimal delay. Cadillac says the CT5’s V-6 does 0-60 mph in 4.9 seconds, compared with the four-cylinder’s 6.6 seconds — a sizable difference. We found the four-cylinder to be underwhelming in the CT5, especially compared with BMW’s potent 330i base engine, whose 0-60-mph time we measured at 5.6 seconds.\n\nYou’ll pay for the 3.0’s performance at the pump, though. It’s rated 19/26/21 mpg city/highway/combined, versus the 2.0-liter’s EPA-estimated 23/32/26 mpg. At 15,000 miles a year and current prices for premium fuel (required for both), that could cost an extra $350 a year, according to the EPA. The V-6’s rating is also lower than comparable AWD six-cylinder competitors: the M340i is rated 25 mpg combined, the S4 is rated 23 mpg combined and the AMG C43 is rated 22 mpg combined.  \n\nThe powertrain experience is fairly seamless, with few hiccups from the 10-speed. I wanted more input on whether Performance Shift was activated or not; it’s denoted only by a green gear outline in the instrument cluster. Performance Shift holds gears longer, shifts firmer/faster and is automatically activated by throttle input, but that gave it a delay and sometimes inappropriate shifting for what I was demanding. Pontiacs used to have a Performance Shift button on the gear selector, which would be nice functionality to have again.\n\n2020 Cadillac CT5 | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nTour and Sport modes are activated by a toggle switch ahead of the gear selector. They adjust the expected parameters of engine and transmission responsiveness, as well as how the engine sounds through electronic augmentation via the sound system’s speakers. The 3.0-liter has a naturally tight, sharp soundtrack, so the electronic help comes across as natural and pleasing rather than artificial, as it does with many four-cylinders. \n\nChoosing Sport mode also changes how the brake pedal feels, thanks to a drive-by-wire braking system that replaces the traditional vacuum brake assist. It’s still using hydraulic fluid and lines for braking, but the boost in brake pressure now comes from an electric motor, not engine vacuum, and the brake pedal is electronic and can alter pedal feel. The difference in brake feel is most apparent in heavy braking use when quickly running up on a sharp corner, not during normal stop-and-go traffic. In Sport mode, the brake pedal’s action is a touch higher in the pedal stroke and pushes back more than in Tour mode. I’m still adjusting my own calibrations to these kinds of systems in non-hybrid or electric vehicles, but the ones in GM’s cars and trucks have a short, hard brake pedal that’s more binary than linear — except the 2020 Chevrolet Corvette, which has the most natural tuning of any GM vehicle I’ve experienced.\n\nSport Suspension Optional\n\nCadillac’s appropriately hyped Magnetic Ride Control is available only on the CT5-V, with unique suspension tuning, so what you get in the regular CT5 is a fixed-firmness, passive shock absorber package. It delivers a comfortable ride that communicates road feel without being jarring. It’s not a sport suspension, per se, but this is definitely modern Cadillac suspension tuning, more along the lines of the outgoing ATS and CTS, which were among the most dynamic sedans of their time. \n\nThe previous ATS and CTS were ahead of the competition in terms of giving you what you want from the steering wheel: enough road feel to be communicative but not high-strung, with light assist and quick-ratio steering. The CT5, as well as a CT4-V I drove at the same time, are missing some of that magic. The steering lacks on-center bite and has a slow steering ratio that takes too much steering angle to get a response from the front end. I experienced early understeer — possibly from the all-season tires and relaxed body control — but that concern could be addressed by the existence of the CT5-V, which is a milder sport package, like the former CTS V-Sport versus the powerhouse CTS-V. I caveat these impressions by stating both versions I drove were all-wheel drive. The all-wheel-drive CT5 has a fixed steering ratio versus the rear-wheel-drive CT5’s variable steering ratio, so perhaps the rear-wheel drive’s steering is more responsive, though I haven’t driven one to confirm. \n\nThe larger issue is that BMW is back, and in a bad way for Cadillac. Where Cadillac’s proficient handling package used to embarrass BMW’s, the BMW 3 Series has now found the edge it lost in its previous generation. Pitting the CT5 against a contemporary 3 Series, with or without the M Sport Package and with or without all-wheel drive, would not be a winning move for Cadillac. \n\nHowever, the CT5’s larger size and longer wheelbase deliver ride quality that’s sublime, if a little busy, with no jarring jolts over broken pavement. Helping the pleasant highway experience is minimal wind and road noise; any luxury automaker would be thrilled to have the CT5’s isolation. The cabin is well-sealed-off from the outside — most obviously when I took the CT5 through a car wash and it felt like the massive air dryer was a million miles away.\n\n2020 Cadillac CT5 | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\nIs The CT5 Worth the Money?\n\nThe six-cylinder CT5 isn’t at the level of its dedicated sport package compatriots — and it definitely doesn’t match the acceleration of the M340 — but it’s a happy alternative with an appropriate price tag: $52,155 as-tested, including destination charge and optional equipment. What the CT5 didn’t have at that price was adaptive cruise control, which is part of a Driver Assist and Advanced Security Package, or Super Cruise, Cadillac’s hands-free adaptive cruise control, which won’t be available on the CT5 until the 2021 model year. BMW’s Extended Traffic Jam Assistant — one of the only other hands-free systems out there — is available on the 3 Series. \n\nTwo features stood out in my testing, including a standard high-resolution backup camera that provided some of the best clarity around; a multiview 360-degree top-down system is optional. The other was in-car Wi-Fi, which seemed gimmicky at best in pre-pandemic times. Now, though, I used the CT5’s cellular Wi-Fi to remotely video conference from my laptop, and it delivered a presentable enough video feed. It’s not something I would have needed prior to 2020, but the CT5 made it doable. Almost all competitors offer in-car Wi-Fi, but what makes the CT5 stand out is that the backseat is a decently accommodating workstation; there’s even a USB-C outlet back there.  \n\nWith the optional V-6, the CT5 is a compelling offering that’s roomier than its competitors, and certainly a bargain buy when put up against other optional turbo-sixes. Our reviewers weren’t particularly thrilled with the CT5’s 2.0-liter, but the V-6 fills the gap without going overboard with firm suspension tuning or exorbitant cost. Pricing for the CT5 V-6 starts around $45,000 — competitive with the pricing of four-cylinder competitors — which means it’s even more unfortunate that this is the engine that makes the CT5, but will be hard to find until more fill the market.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
