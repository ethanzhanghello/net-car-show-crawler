      "expert_review": "The all-electric Cadillac Escalade IQ may not be an Escalade underneath (its Ultium architecture differs from the truck-derived underpinnings of its gas-burning forebear), but Cadillac is all-in on treating it like one. Just as the Escalade is available in standard and extra-length sizes, so, too, is the IQ.\n\nRelated: 2025 Cadillac Escalade IQ Up Close: More Lyriq XL Than Escalade EV\n\nWhat Is the Escalade IQL?\n\nIf you buy the long-wheelbase version of the Escalade with the internal-combustion engine, you get an ESV, but Cadillac is calling the extended EV the Escalade IQL. Rather than stretching the wheelbase, as it does to make an ESV, Cadillac simply added more length aft of the rear wheels for the IQL. At 228.5 inches long, the IQL is 4.2 inches longer than the standard Escalade IQ, all of which — and then some — goes into the third-row seat. Occupants in the way back enjoy 4.4 more inches of legroom than they do in the IQ, as well as an extra inch of headroom thanks to a flatter roofline.\n\nThe IQL gets a touch more cargo space than the regular-length IQ, too. According to Cadillac’s measurements, the IQL gets 24.2 cubic feet behind the third-row seat and 125.2 with the second and third rows folded versus 23.7 and 119.2, respectively, in the IQ. Even including the 12.2-cubic-foot frunk, however, the IQL pales in comparison to the ESV’s cavernous 41.5 and 142.8 cubic feet.\n\nLike its shorter sibling, the IQL will be available with an Executive Second Row Package that includes power-adjustable seats with heating, ventilation, and massage and speakers in the head restraints. Stowable tray tables, dual 12.6-inch entertainment screens, a touchscreen for the climate controls and power doors, and two wireless charging pads are also included in the package.\n\nWhat Are the Escalade IQL’s Powertrain Specs and Range?\n\nAlso like the standard Escalade IQ, the IQL will only be offered with all-wheel drive. Two electric motors, one at each axle, combine to produce 680 horsepower and 615 pounds-feet of torque. Velocity Max mode unlocks an additional 70 hp and 170 pounds-feet for short periods, bumping total output to 750 hp and 785 pounds-feet and sending the IQL screaming from 0-60 mph in a claimed 4.7 seconds. The Escalade IQL is also rated to tow 7,500 pounds, 500 fewer than the IQ.\n\nAt 205 kilowatt-hours, the IQL’s battery pack can store 5 kWh more than the standard Escalade IQ’s, but Cadillac claims the same 460-mile range for both vehicles (official EPA-rated range estimates are not yet available). Like the IQ, the IQL will come standard with an 11.5-kilowatt onboard charger; a 19.2-kW unit will be available. Cadillac says the IQL will be able to add up to 116 miles in 10 minutes on a DC fast charger.\n\nRelease Date and Pricing\n\nThe 2026 Cadillac Escalade IQL will go on sale in the second half of 2025, carrying a premium of about $2,800 over the shorter Escalade IQ. Full line pricing is as follows (all prices include a $2,290 destination charge):\n\nLuxury: $132,695\nPremium Luxury: $152,995\nSport: $133,195\nPremium Sport: $153,495\nWhat Are the Escalade IQL’s Trim Levels?\n\nNot surprisingly, the Escalade IQL’s standard equipment tracks that of the regular Escalade IQ. GM’s Super Cruise hands-free semi-autonomous highway-driving tech is included across the lineup, as is the full suite of safety features depending on the same battery of sensors, including forward collision warning with pedestrian and bicyclist detection, automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning, lane departure steering assist, blind spot intervention and a 360-degree parking camera.\n\nAs with the IQ, the IQL’s four trim levels are split into two lines, Luxury and Sport. The only difference between the two are that the Sport variants feature black and dark-chrome trim instead of the Luxury line’s brighter bits. The Luxury and Sport ride on an adaptive air suspension with rear-wheel steering and 22-inch wheels. Other features include a panoramic moonroof, a 55-inch digital dashboard that reaches from A-pillar to A-pillar, a heated steering wheel, heated and ventilated front seats, heated second-row captain’s chairs, a power-folding third row, a 21-speaker AKG Studio sound system and a head-up display.\n\nUpgrading to Premium Luxury or Premium Sport nets buyers 24-inch wheels, power-operated doors, massaging front seats, night vision and a 38-speaker AKG Studio Reference audio system. The Premium trim levels also unlock access to more optional equipment, including the aforementioned Executive Second Row Package.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2025 Cadillac Escalade IQ Is Electric (Boogie Oogie Oogie)\nWhat to Know Before Purchasing an Electric Vehicle: A Buying Guide\nWhich Electric Cars Are Still Eligible for the $7,500 Federal Tax Credit?\nResearch the Cadillac Escalade IQ\nFind Your Next Car\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
