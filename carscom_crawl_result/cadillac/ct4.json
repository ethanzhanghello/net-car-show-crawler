      "expert_review": "The Cadillac CT4 blends luxury with state of the art performance and competes with rival sedans like the Alfa Romeo Giulia, Audi A4, BMW 3 Series and Mercedes-Benz C-Class. The GM luxury brand is leaving the CT4’s formula largely unaltered for the 2023 model year, with the only changes being new exterior colors and a starting price of $35,790 (all pricing includes $1,395 destination charge).\n\nRelated: Cadillac Gears Up to Add Manual Transmission to CT4, CT5 Blackwings\n\nNew Colors Paint Largely Carried-Over Picture\n\nThe CT4’s lone major update for 2023 is the addition of three new extra-cost exterior colors: Radiant Red Tintcoat, Argent Silver Metallic and Midnight Steel Metallic. The range-topping CT4-V Blackwing adds a fourth hue called Maverick Noir Frost that’s exclusive to the Sebring IMSA Edition. The Blackwing will also get a late-availability Blackwing badge on its trunk.\n\nOtherwise, powertrains are the same: Luxury and Sport trims continue to be powered by a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that makes 237 horsepower; the Premium Luxury trim has an optional 310-hp, turbo 2.7-liter four-cylinder; the V-Series also uses the turbo 2.7-liter, but power is bumped up to 325 hp; and the CT4-V Blackwing gets a 472-hp, twin-turbo 3.6-liter V-6. An eight-speed automatic transmission is standard on the 2.0-liter, the 2.7-liter gets a 10-speed automatic, and the Blackwing gets either a six-speed manual or the 10-speed automatic.\n\nPricing and Release Date\n\nThe 2023 CT4 is available now. Full pricing is below:\n\nLuxury: $35,790\nPremium Luxury 2.0: $40,690\nPremium Luxury 2.7: $45,790\nSport: $41,890\nV-Series: $47,990\nV-Series Blackwing: $61,890\n\nRear-wheel drive is standard, while all-wheel drive adds $2,000 to the CT4’s price and $500 to the V-Series (it remains unavailable with the Blackwing). The automatic transmission is an extra $3,175 on the CT4-V Blackwing.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2022 Cadillac CT4-V, CT5-V Blackwing to Get Nifty Performance Touches Inside\nWhen Hands-Free Ain’t Free: What’s the Cost of Self-Driving Tech?\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2020 Cadillac CT4-V?\n2021 Cadillac CT4, CT5 Add Safety Features, Hands-Free Super Cruise\nResearch the Cadillac CT4\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Cadillac CT4?\n\nThe Cadillac CT4 is a small luxury sedan that comes standard with a 237-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission. One rung higher is a turbocharged 2.7-liter four-cylinder that comes with a 10-speed automatic. This powertrain develops 310 hp in Premium Luxury trim or 325 hp in the sportier CT4-V. Sitting atop the range is the high-performance CT4-V Blackwing, which boasts a 472-hp, twin-turbo 3.6-liter V-6 and can be had with the 10-speed automatic or a six-speed manual gearbox. The Blackwing comes only with rear-wheel drive, but other CT4s are available with RWD or all-wheel drive. According to Cars.com’s cargo measurements, the CT4-V has 13.7 cubic feet of trunk volume.

      "expert_review": "Cadillac is busy pumping out new, bigger and faster electric SUVs, so the brand’s entry-level sedan receives little love this year. Rolling into its seventh model year, the CT4 is unchanged for 2026 but still offers a variety of powertrain configurations at a base price that undercuts most of its competitors. The 2026 Cadillac CT4 starts at $37,095 (all prices include the $1,495 destination charge).\nRelated: Which New Cars Have Manual Transmissions?\nRelease Date and Pricing\nThe 2026 Cadillac CT4 is on sale now. Full line pricing is as follows:\n\nLuxury: $37,095\nPremium Luxury: $41,395\nSport: $45,295\nV-Series: $51,495\nV-Series Blackwing: $64,195\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n    What Are the 2026 Cadillac CT4’s Trim Levels?\nThe base Luxury trim features 17-inch wheels, LED exterior lighting, and keyless entry and start. Its cabin is upholstered in synthetic leather and outfitted with heated and power-adjustable front seats, a heated steering wheel, dual-zone automatic climate control, wireless phone charging, eight speakers, and an 8-inch infotainment touchscreen with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.\nUpgrading to the Premium Luxury nets 18-inch wheels, rain-sensing windshield wipers, genuine leather and upgraded front seats with ventilation. The Sport trim gets a unique front bumper, an integrated rear spoiler, black exterior trim, adjustable thigh support for the front seats and aluminum pedals.\nThe CT4 V-Series gets a high-performance overhaul consisting of adaptive dampers (on rear-drive models), a limited-slip rear differential, Brembo front brakes and GM’s Performance Traction Management graduated stability control with launch control. It also boasts a 14-speaker Bose sound system.\nBuilding off the V-Series, the Blackwing packs yet more power, an upgraded limited-slip differential, Brembo front and rear brakes, and a unique front bumper with ground effects. It switches to a 15-speaker AKG audio system and adds navigation and a 12-inch digital instrument cluster.\nStandard and Available Safety Features\nStandard safety tech across the 2026 CT4 lineup includes forward collision warning with pedestrian detection, automatic emergency braking, blind spot monitors, rear cross-traffic alert, lane departure warning, lane departure steering assist, a following distance indicator, automatic high beams and rear parking sensors. The Premium Luxury trim level adds adaptive cruise control, front parking sensors and reverse automatic braking. A head-up display, GM’s Super Cruise hands-free highway driving tech and a 360-degree parking camera are optional from the Premium Luxury on up.\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2022 Cadillac CT4-V Blackwing Quick Spin: Saving the Best for Last\nCadillac CT4 Vs. CT5: Comparing Cargo Space and Dimensions\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2020 Cadillac CT4-V?\nResearch the Cadillac CT4\nFind Your Next Car\n\nWhat Are the 2026 Cadillac CT4’s Powertrain Specs and MPG?\nThe CT4’s base engine is a 237-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder with 258 pounds-feet of torque. It is mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission. A turbocharged 2.7-liter four-cylinder is available on the Premium Luxury trim level for $4,950; it makes 310 hp and 350 pounds-feet and is mated to a 10-speed automatic transmission.\nRear-wheel drive is standard, and all-wheel drive is a $2,000 option. Cadillac says the 2.0-liter CT4 returns an EPA-rated 22/32/26 mpg city/highway/combined with RWD and 21/31/25 mpg with AWD (official ratings for the 2026 model are not yet available). The 2.7-liter is rated at 21/31/25 mpg with rear-drive and 21/29/24 mpg with AWD.\nThe CT4 V-Series also packs the turbocharged 2.7-liter four, but here it generates 325 hp and 380 pounds-feet of torque. The 10-speed automatic and rear-drive are again standard, but AWD costs only $500 on the V. It returns 20/29/23 mpg with RWD and 20/28/23 with AWD.\nCadillac reserves the Blackwing badge for its hardest-core performance models, and in the CT4, that means a twin-turbocharged 3.6-liter V-6 churning out an impressive 472 hp and 445 pounds-feet paired to a standard six-speed manual transmission. There’s no AWD offered on the Blackwing, but the 10-speed automatic is available for $3,175. With the stick shift, the Blackwing is rated at 15/23/18 mpg; the automatic increases those figures to 16/24/19 mpg.\nRelated Video:\n\n  \n    \n\n  \n    Cars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Cadillac CT4?\nThe Cadillac CT4 is a luxury sports sedan that comes standard with a 237-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission. One rung higher is a turbocharged 2.7-liter four-cylinder that comes with a 10-speed automatic; this powertrain develops 310 hp in Premium Luxury trim or 325 hp in the sportier CT4-V. Sitting atop the range is the high-performance CT4-V Blackwing, which boasts a 472-hp, twin-turbo 3.6-liter V-6 and can be had with the 10-speed automatic or a six-speed manual gearbox.

      "expert_review": "Competes with: BMW 3 Series, Audi A4, Mercedes-Benz C-Class, Lexus IS\nLooks like: Cadillac’s flagship CT6 sedan scaled down\nPowertrain: A 237-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder or 309-hp, turbocharged 2.7-liter four-cylinder engine mated to either an eight- or 10-speed automatic transmission; rear- or all-wheel drive\nHits dealerships: March\nThe 2020 Cadillac CT4 is the new entry-level sedan from GM’s luxury brand, and it replaces the discontinued ATS in the Caddy lineup. In addition to the performance-oriented CT4-V, the CT4 will offer Luxury, Premium Luxury and Sport trim levels. Cadillac also announced that its Super Cruise hands-free driving system, which is being expanded to more roads, will become available on the CT4 in 2020.\nRelated: 2020 Cadillac CT4-V: Less Performance, More Affordable\n\n  \n    \n  \n    Exterior\nCadillac says the CT4 is a bit bigger than the ATS, and its overall softer lines — particularly in the non-V models — and fastback profile echo Cadillac’s big CT6 sedan a little more than the new 2020 CT5.\nThe grille and exterior trim in bright finish distinguish the CT4 Luxury and Premium Luxury trim levels, while the Sport trim level offers the darkened trim and grille as well as some of the more aggressive bumper and trim design aspects of the V model (as well as its Brembo front brakes) in a lower-performance version.\nInterior\nThe CT4 cabin features an 8-inch touchscreen powered by GM’s latest operating system. Standard features include keyless entry and push-button start, a leather-wrapped steering wheel (heated optional), color dual-display driver information center, LED interior lighting and premium audio with active noise cancellation.\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nR.I.P.

It works with an eight-speed automatic transmission. That’s down from 272 hp for the base 2.0-liter in the outgoing ATS. A turbocharged 2.7-liter four-cylinder that also goes in the V model is available. It’s an option for the Premium Luxury trim level, but in a detuned version putting out 309 hp and 348 pounds-feet of torque versus 325 hp and 380 pounds-feet of torque in the CT4-V. This engine teams with a 10-speed automatic.\nRear-wheel drive is standard; all-wheel drive is offered on all models. All models also offer selectable drive modes that, depending on equipment, can alter settings for shifting, suspension, steering and brake feel, AWD front and rear torque split, and exhaust note. The modes include Tour, Sport, Snow/Ice, Track and a personal mode; the V gets an additional performance V Mode.\nSafety\nAvailable active safety features include forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, front pedestrian braking, blind spot warning, rear cross-traffic alert, adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning, lane-keeping assist, reverse automatic braking, automatic high-beam headlights and GM’s Safety Alert Seat.\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
