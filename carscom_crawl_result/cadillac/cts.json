      "expert_review": "When I first stepped into the Cadillac CTS, I saw the strangest thing poking out of the floor. It was a stickshift. This was a Cadillac with a five-speed manual transmission. How bizarre.\n\nBut also, how symbolic of the new direction taken by Cadillac to turn its ponderous division away from the cushy land yachts (such as the DeVille that my dad drives) normally associated with General Motors’ luxury division.\n\nCadillac’s stunning turnaround of late has come with products that seem incongruous: the big Escalade sport utility vehicle embraced by sports figures and chic urban types, and now the CTS, a $30,000 midsize sedan with edgy styling and road manners that approach BMW standards.\n\nNext up for 2004 is the SRX, which is a car-based sport utility vehicle, and a gorgeous two-seat roadster called XLR based on Chevrolet Corvette.\n\nRecently, Cadillac wowed the Detroit Auto Show with its Sixteen concept car, aggressively styled and powered by a V-16 engine rated at 1,000 horsepower.\n\nThese are part of Cadillac’s efforts to regain its international status as a top maker of luxury vehicles, now eclipsed by Mercedes-Benz and Lexus.\n\nUnder its recent partnership with General Motors, the Bob Bondurant School of High Performance Driving in Chandler has started using Corvettes, as one would expect, but also Cadillac CTS sedans to replace Ford Mustangs.\n\nThe idea of a Cadillac for performance training would have been laughable not very long ago. But CTS is a rear-wheel-drive car that handles like a sports coupe and would work well on the tightly curving Bondurant track.\n\nCaddy’s previous efforts at marketing a midsize entry-level sedan have been flops. Recently, the Catera was saddled with boring looks and a silly ad campaign that featured a cartoon duck and the sappy slogan, “The Caddy that zigs.”\n\nBefore that was the truly terrible Cimarron, a lackluster piece of 1970s badge engineering that attempted to turn a bland Chevy Cavalier into a Cadillac. It didn’t work.\n\nThe CTS is a whole new ballgame. With sharply creased, angular body contours, CTS stands out from the crowd. To some eyes, its aggressive style is appealing and world-class. To others, it’s an ugly mess. No one seems to be neutral, but that’s the whole point. Here’s a sedan that stirs passions at first glance. And that’s a good thing.\n\nThe interior feels solid and nicely designed, with a modular look more attuned to European style than typical Cadillac. The front seats are very roomy, but it’s a bit tight in back.\n\nFor me, the five-speed enhanced the driving experience, though Cadillac expects to sell only about 5 percent of its CTS cars so equipped. This is a Getrag gearbox with a short-throw shifter that is smooth and precise. Most CTS’s will get a automatic transmission, the same brand they put in BMWs.\n\nThere’s just one engine choice, a 3.2-liter V-6 that puts out a convinci ng 220 horsepower. Acceleration is quick, though accompanied by some engine noise. The throttle is a drive-by-wire electronic system, not that the driver would notice the difference.\n\nThere is talk about the CTS getting Cadillac’s formidable Northstar V-8 in the near future. But with the strong V-6 and slick five-speed, as well as responsive rack-and-pinion steering and four-wheel-disc brakes, the current CTS should romp on the Bondurant track.\n\nThe CTS started at just under $30,000, but a few packages of desirable options quickly boosted the price past $38,000. These included a $3,500 Luxury Sport package with a host of extras, including computerized driver settings, a Talknote recorder (for those on-road inspirations), sport-tuned suspension with load leveling, zebrano wood interior trim, and 17-inch alloy wheels shod with V-rated tires; a $2,700 Bose audio system with GPS navigation; $1,100 for a sunroof; $500 for high-intensity headlights; $400 for heated front seats; and $640 for shipping.\n\nCadillac CTS\n\nVehicle type: Five-passenger, four-door sedan, rear-wheel drive.\n\nBase price: $29,350\n\nPrice as tested: $38,190\n\nEngine: 3.2-liter V-6, 220 horsepower at 6,000 rpm, 218 pounds-feet of torque at 3,400 rpm.\n\nTransmission: Five-speed manual.\n\nWheelbase: 113.4 inches.\n\nCurb weight: 3,509 pounds.\n\nEPA mileage: 18 city, 25 highway.\n\nHighs:\n\nSharp performance.\n\nSporty image.\n\nA new kind of Cadillac.\n\nLows:\n\nLove/hate styling.\n\nModerate gas mileage.\n\nExpensive options.",

      "expert_review": "Ready to run with Germany’s big dogs\n\nWhen first we drove the Cadillac CTS, we called it a nascent Autobahn burner –meaning it eventually might be ready to run with the big dogs from Germany such as Mercedes Benz, BMW, and Audi.\n\nWe used the word nascent because, with a 6-cylinder engine and 255 horsepower, it wasn’t yet up to a romp on that Teutonic, no-holds-barred freeway of speed that is the Autobahn. But watch out, we said, for tomorrow.\n\nWell, tomorrow is here.\n\nGreet the CTS-V, which, while it won’t outrun the best of the ‘Bahn burners, will surely leave some flames in its wake.\n\nIt has been written here before that General Motors has given Cadillac an edge: literally with its sharp-lined, crisp design and figuratively by turning the brand into one that someone other than an older gentleman would want to drive.\n\nThe Cadillac line now includes a hot, two-seat convertible, hotter SUVs, a sedan, and the CTS, that, even with 6 cylinders, was a powerful commuter along American highways.\n\nAll that and refined interiors.\n\nSo first, a word on the interior of the CTS-V, which aims to, as I said, run with the big dogs. Firm seats, well bolstered. Cool navigation package. Spacious.\n\nFor safety, there are six air bags that include side curtains and front side-impact bags.\n\nStabiliTrak controls your driving and can be switched off if you want to go racing — or pretend you are.\n\nThe motor — look up Corvette in your reference guide — is a 5.7-liter V-8 that delivers 400 horsepower and 395 lb.-ft. of torque. You could tow a big boat with this rig.\n\nIt is very fast off the line, though I was concerned about a certain chatter from the rear axle as I drove it harder than most folks will. But once at speed, it is powerful and smooth, cruising the highway better than your basic ‘Vette. And that’s saying something for a sedan.\n\nIf you go fast, you need to stop, and big Brembo brakes with vented rotors stop that scenery outside from screaming past you, wicked fast.\n\nThe ride is a bit stiff, but you want that. It’s not as stiff as, say, a BMW M3 — which tends toward sports car — but it’s softer than an M5 or a Mercedes C32 AMG.\n\nIt’s a good compromise for an American product aimed at Americans who want performance and comfort.\n\nThe torque band seems to run forever, from down near 2,800 r.p.m. all the way up to 6,000-plus. This is most noticeable in fourth gear at high commuter speeds, where it pulls out in pure silk and swishes past laggards. The shifter is a six-speed manual.\n\nOn backroads, there is a tendency to understeer if pushed hard — a trait I find uncommon in rear-wheel-drive cars.\n\nBut every car has steering peculiarities, and you learn to adjust.\n\nFrom the outside, this car has been tuned for eye appeal.\n\nIts sharp edges burn with the impression of speed.\n\nIts nose-scraping front spoiler looks like it is ready to suck up wind and distance.\n\nAnd the short chop from the back of the rear door to the trunk is a humped and aggressive stance.\n\nThey tested and treated this car on Germany’s infamous Nurburgring race circuit, and, having driven it myself, I can tell you that any car that can be pushed through that screaming and scary course has some serious mustard beneath its hood as well as bolstering its suspension.\n\nThere was a time that Cadillac slipped from finned fantasy to boxed obsolescence.\n\nBut that was yesterday.\n\nIf this is the standard for Cadillac and its promise, then finned fantasy will give way to edgy, reborn, American muscle — even if we don’t get to set the Autobahn on fire.",

      "expert_review": "A Corvette sedan?\n\nWell, that’s probably a bit of a stretch, but the Cadillac CTS-V might be about as close as you can get to that in a General Motors car that has four doors and can carry five people and their luggage. Try that in a ‘Vette.\n\nSo for those who might lust for a Corvette, but have to face the realities of family life – specifically, that a two-seat sports car just isn’t suitable for hauling the kids around town – the CTS-V could be the answer.\n\nUsing the body of the popular midsize CTS sedan, Cadillac created the CTS-V performance model almost three years ago. It looks almost the same as the regular V-6 versions of this sedan line, but comes with a secret weapon under the hood.\n\nRegular versions of the CTS come with a choice of two V-6 engines, but the CTS-V has the 6.0-liter LS2 V-8 engine from the Corvette C6 base model, rated at 400 horsepower and 395 foot-pounds of torque. It’s connected to the same six-speed manual gearbox used in the current ‘Vette.\n\nThis gives the consumer a family sedan with the power of a Corvette for about the same price — $50,675 (plus $720 freight) for the 2006 model, which we tested. There are no changes on the 2007 model, but prices have not yet been announced.\n\nEverything you can get on a CTS is included in that price, so there are no add-ons to raise the sticker above that. That gave our test vehicle a list price of $51,395 (including freight), which is out of range for a lot of consumers, but certainly in line with prices of other cars in this class.\n\nWhen GM debuted the CTS-V for 2004, it came with the 5.7-liter, LS6 V-8 from the fifth-generation Corvette. But after last year’s introduction of the C6, with its new 6.0-liter engine, GM shared that new power plant with the CTS-V and other vehicles in its lineup that had carried the 5.7-liter ‘Vette engine.\n\nNow, for those of you who are aghast that I would even suggest that someone buy a gas-guzzling, high-performance V-8 in the light of rising fuel prices and controversy over our dependence on foreign oil, let me say that the 2006 CTS-V has an EPA rating of 25 miles per gallon on the highway. That’s similar to the fuel economy of many V-6 powered midsize sedans. City mileage is 16 mpg, and even that beats most of the midsize and larger SUVs on the market; and most of them don’t come close to the CTS-V’s highway mileage.\n\nThere is a racing version of the CTS-V that gets even more power (500 HP), but it’s not street-legal. The 400 HP model will have to do if you’re going to drive the car to work or for weekend family outings.\n\nThis car is like driving a Corvette with a back seat – a full-size, adult-accommodating back seat. Driving a sedan has never been more fun. The CTS-V brings lots of attention, too. Car people already know what it is, but for the rest, you might have to explain about the Corvette engine, 400 horsepower, and six-speed gearbox.\n\nMost people think it costs much more than it does, so in that respect, the CTS-V comes across as a bargain. Many people pay $50,000-plus for a sport utility vehicle with much less curb-appeal.\n\nThe CTS-V appeals mostly to those who would love to own a Corvette or the Cadillac XLR two-seater (based on the C6 platform and built on the Corvette assembly line in Bowling Green, Ky.), but must buy a sedan or SUV because of family considerations. The CTS-V has the power and feel of a ‘Vette, but with not only the back seat, but a roomy trunk as well – the same 12.8 cubic feet as on the V-6 CTS models.\n\nSome special styling cues help to differentiate the CTV-V from the regular CTS, such as the metal mesh grille and lower air intake below the front bumper, the 18-inch alloy wheels and the CTS-V badging on the front fenders and the rear end.\n\nAt the heart of the car is the engine, and it turns the CTS into a beast. Connected to a true dual-exhaust system, the engine sounds like the beast it is.\n\nThe six-speed manual transmission is a necessary part of the performance equipment on this car; an automatic just wouldn’t be as much fun. No automatic is even offered, although I wouldn’t be surprised to see one offered sometime in the future just because so many people these days can’t or won’t learn how to drive a manual-shift car. Automatic transmissions outsell manuals in the Corvette, although with the current generation of the ‘Vette, the automatic is no longer the base transmission as it was in the C5. Base cars get the six-speed manual.\n\nGeneral Motors says top speed of the CTS-V is 163 mph, compared with 142 mph for the 3.6-liter V-6 model.\n\nDon’t try that on public highways, though. Besides being irresponsible, it could get you thrown in jail. Find a track that you can use for the high-speed stuff.\n\nWhat the CTS-V’s power will do for you, legally, is allow you to pass other cars or merge onto the freeway wherever and whenever you want to.\n\nMy only complaint with the original CTS, which came only with the 3.2-liter engine, was that it lacked the kind of power the car needed to live up to Cadillac’s billing of it as a “sport sedan.” Even an optional turbocharger or supercharger would have given that engine enough extra zip to make it appeal to performance-oriented drivers – the ones Cadillac said it was going after with the introduction of the CTS with its optional Getrag five-speed manual gearbox.\n\nWith the 220-horsepower rating, the car still was pretty quick with the five-speed manual. But for 2004, Cadillac rolled out a 3.6-liter V-6 with variable valve timing and a big boost in power: 255 horsepower and 252 foot-pounds of torque.\n\nAnd even though Cadillac had been offering a five-speed manual gearbox in the CTS from the start, a new six-speed manual was introduced as a perfect companion to the 255-horsepower engine.\n\nThere also is a new base engine, a 2.8-liter V-6 that has 210 horsepower, and is designed for those who want the styling and other amenities of the CTS, but don’t care about the extra power. The 2.8 model is about $21,000 less than the CTS-V, as well. No manual is offered with that engine, however.\n\nMost premium sedan buyers want an automatic transmission, but they also want enough power to keep up with the competition. Hence, the volume leader among the CTS offerings is a model with the 3.6-liter engine and automatic gearbox.\n\nThe 400 HP model has more power than most of its competitors, including similarly priced Jaguar, Lexus and Infiniti V-8 sport sedans.\n\nAs expected, the CTS-V is loaded with standard amenities.\n\nAmong them are four-wheel Brembo four-piston disc brakes with 14-inch vented rotors; Stabilitrak all-speed traction control; tower-to-tower cross bracing for extra rigidity; leather seats with suede fabric inserts; power, heated front seats with power lumbar adjustment; split-folding rear seat; power windows/mirrors/door locks with remote, of course; cruise control; AM/FM/compact-disc stereo with eight speakers, integrated with a DVD navigation system; XM Satellite Radio; OnStar; fog lights; automatic headlights; and an alarm system.\n\nFor safety’s sake, the CTS-V comes with driver and front passenger seat-mounted side-impact air bags, as well as side-curtain air bags for front and rear passengers. Run-flat tires also are standard.\n\nA power sunroof is now included in the base price, where it has been a $1,200 option before.\n\nThe tank holds 17.2 gallons of fuel, and premium unleaded is recommended.\n\nG.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nLittle has changed on Cadillac’s CTS sedan for 2007, though the optional navigation system’s NavTraffic overlay does gain some additional features.\n\nLaunched as an early 2003 model, the CTS was built on a new Sigma rear-wheel-drive platform and featured square-edge styling and a 220-horsepower, 3.2-liter V-6. Suspension revisions and interior changes for 2004 were intended to soften the ride and reduce noise. Cadillac also added a 255-hp, 3.6-liter V-6 to the options list in 2004, and in 2005 the base V-6 was replaced by a smaller, 210-hp engine. A manual or automatic transmission is available with either engine.\n\nA high-performance CTS-V sedan is also available.\n\n(Skip to details on the: CTS-V)\n\nExterior\nStyling themes for the CTS are rooted in Cadillac’s Evoq concept car. Cadillac touted the CTS as “the first 100 percent application of Cadillac’s art and science approach to passenger-car design.”\n\nCadillac has described the CTS body as lean, bold and chiseled, incorporating “sharp edges and crisp intersecting lines” and a short front overhang. Measuring 190.1 inches long overall, the CTS rides a 113.4-inch wheelbase. Integrated, traditionally styled vertical headlights and taillights are installed. The large, shield-shaped, louvered eggcrate grille is reminiscent of Cadillacs dating back to the 1930s. Cadillac’s wreath-and-crest symbol is incorporated into the grille.\n\nCast-aluminum wheels hold 16-inch tires. An optional Sport Package includes Cadillac’s StabiliTrak electronic stability system, a sport-tuned suspension, a load-leveling rear suspension and 17-inch wheels. The Sport Performance Package includes 18-inch wheels, revised suspension tuning, xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights, StabiliTrak and a tire pressure monitoring system.\n\nInterior\nFive people fit inside the CTS sedan. Wood is used only in areas where it will come in contact with occupants: on the three-spoke steering wheel, gearshift knob and door pulls. The seats have leather seating surfaces, and heated front seats are optional. General Motors’ OnStar communication system is standard. Trunk capacity measures 12.8 cubic feet.\n\nAn optional navigation system includes XM NavTraffic, which displays traffic congestion, accidents and other information. For 2007, NavTraffic incorporates OnStar Connections and Directions. The service includes spoken directions, concierge service, vehicle diagnostics and more.\n\nUnder the Hood\nCadillac’s 3.6-liter V-6 produces 255 hp, and the 2.8-liter V-6 generates 210 hp. Both engines work with an Aisin six-speed manual transmission or an optional five-speed automatic. A button for the automatic allows drivers to select Sport, Winter or Economy mode. Engine braking occurs in all five gears, which gives the transmission a sportier feel.\n\nSafety\nSix airbags are installed: dual-stage front airbags, seat-mounted side-impact airbags and roof-mounted side curtain airbags. Antilock brakes and all-speed traction control are standard.\n\nAn electronic stability system is optional — an unfortunate omission, given many CTS competitors include the technology as standard equipment.\n\nDriving Impressions\nControversial CTS styling might be considered either alluring or alarming, but there’s less to argue about when it comes to this car’s excellent driving characteristics. An excellent, quick-shifting automatic transmission assists subtle yet bountiful performance.\n\nFor the most part, drivers can expect the feel of a European sport sedan, but the CTS isn’t quite as refined as an Audi or BMW. Still, the CTS is exceptionally stable on the road and easy to drive around town. Steering response is on the sporty side, too.\n\nThe controls are somewhat unorthodox, but the driver’s seat is especially comfortable and adequately supportive. Headroom, elbowroom and leg space are abundant up front.\n\nCTS-V\nCadillac launched a performance offshoot of the CTS during the 2004 model year. Rather than the relatively mild-mannered V-6 engines that go into regular CTS sedans, the 2006 CTS-V gets a new, larger 6.0-liter V-8 that produces the same 400 hp and 395 pounds-feet of torque as the 2005 model. Only a Tremec six-speed manual gearbox is offered.\n\nThe CTS-V is the first of several V-series models developed by GM’s Performance Division. Differences between the CTS-V and the regular CTS include a unique front fascia and a tightened suspension. Performance-tuned shocks, springs and stabilizer bars are installed on the CTS-V, and Brembo brakes use 14-inch rotors. The performance-packed CTS-V behaves as promised, accelerating with energetic haste. Back to top",

      "expert_review": "The Cadillac CTS-V is the first model to be developed by the General Motors Performance Division, an in-house center designed to create enthusiast-oriented versions of production models.\nThe CTS-V has some impressive hardware, including a 400-horsepower 5.7-liter V-8 engine, heavy-duty Brembo brakes, and 18-inch Goodyear performance run-flat tires.\nWe were a bit less than enthusiastic, however, about this hot-rod edition of Cadillac’s entry-level sedan. We tested a $53,680 version with a single option — a $1,200 sunroof.\nSHE: So I’m at the beauty shop getting my hair highlighted and as I’m sitting under the dryer, I realize that I’m running out of time on the parking meter. So I scrounge around my purse for a quarter and rise when my stylist Lizzy tells me to sit back down. “We have assistants who can run out and feed the meter,” she says. But I don’t want any of the assistants who all look like they came out of a modeling agency to see what I’m driving. It’s a ruby-slipper-red CTS-V with a big mesh grille. This is the type of salon where you have to be really careful to do your hair before you go in there, and make sure you wear heels. “Just tell them it’s not really my car,” I plead. Looking back, I think that little story — even though it reflects on my shallowness — tells you in a nutshell how I feel about the souped-up CTS-V. Even though it cost more than $50,000, it didn’t really make me feel that great about myself.\nHE: Whew, you’re brutal! That same night, we were sitting in the parking lot of the local Dairy Queen when two post-teenage guys walked by and whistled. Didn’t that one dude actually say, “Sweet ride, man”?\nSHE: Dairy Queen parking-lot jocks — the perfect demographic for the CTS-V. Even though you were preening, I also recall you cursing moments later as we made our way through some stop-and-go downtown traffic, and you couldn’t get the transmission into second gear.\nHE: Oh, that. You’re talking about the blasted Tremec six-speed gearbox that wouldn’t be so bad if GM hadn’t added a “fuel-saving” gimmick — a device that locks you out of second and third gear unless you’re accelerating pretty aggressively, which is not really advisable in the middle of our small town. And when that transmission forces itself from first into fourth gear while you’re still doing only 15-20 miles an hour, you can’t help but wonder why Cadillac would put such a device on what it pitches as its ultimate performance car. However, when you do put your foot into the throttle, that old pushrod V-8 springs to life, the exhaust note emits a satisfying burp and you’re off to the races.\nSHE: OK, here are the things I liked about the CTS-V: The standard OnStar emergency communications system, with the free one-year “Safe & Sound” subscription package. I like the standard XM satellite radio with 130 channels. I like the standard Stabilitrak, a stability control system that helps keep the CTS-V firmly planted in the rain. But I can get all those features on a base CTS, for a lot less money.\nHE: The money factor is critical, specifically value for money on the performance side of the equation. I like what Cadillac has done with the V-series, especially in terms of improved handling and braking. For the most part, the additional hardware is impressive. But the basic CTS still retains too many flaws that were not addressed on the V-series, and there are too many competitors who do it so much better. Let me cite only one example — the Chrysler 300C SRT-8 — which is bigger than the CTS-V, has more displacement and horsepower, and better ride quality and essentially kicks the Cadillac’s butt, for about 10 grand less.\nSHE: We both had major issues with the cabin. There were way too many things that looked cheap, from the carpet to the overhead console — stuff you’d expect to find on a $12,000 compact, not a $50,000 luxury sedan.\nHE: We’ve complained before about the chintzy-looking plastic that Cadillac used on the instrument panel and doors of the CTS, and unfortunately they’ve done nothing to improve or rectify the situation on the V-series. We also noticed some glaring problems with assembly quality. So we’re left with the overarching question: Is the V-series really worth $20,000 more than the base CTS?\nSHE: Regardless of whether you’re an enthusiast or not, the answer seems to be no.\nAnita and Paul Lienert are partners in Lienert & Lienert, an Ann Arborautomotive information services firm.",

      "expert_review": "Who would ever think that Cadillac, the luxury automaker best known for wallowing barges and overwrought SUVs, could build a midsize sports sedan that beats the performance imports at their own game?\n\nTruth. Caddy’s dramatic turnaround from building half-baked midsize cars to introducing the well-done 2008 CTS sport sedan is a story best told in reference to General Motors’ general product improvement during the past few years. That includes the fine 2008 Chevy Malibu that took top prize as North American Car of the Year.\n\nCTS, first seen in 2002, was a bold departure for conservative Cadillac. Its knife-edge contours were distinctive and controversial, and the ride was dialed in to firm drivability rather than plush luxury.\n\nThis year’s CTS is all new, with styling that’s refined but still recognizable and drivability that competes head-on with the likes of BMW and Audi. No, that’s not hyperbole. CTS actually could lure some Euro drivers back to Detroit.\n\nThis is a satisfying car to drive, quick and maneuverable when you want it to be and quiet and poised on the highway. The performance intent is apparent, with a six-speed manual transmission offered as standard and automatic optional. There’s also an all-wheel-drive version.\n\nThe CTS I drove was the base model, powered by a 263-horsepower V-6, automatic and about $10,000 worth of options. A direct-injection version of the same engine boosts horsepower to 304 for $2,300 more. The hyper-performance CTS-V skips a year before returning in 2009.\n\nWith prices starting at just more than $32,000, CTS steeply undercuts the Europeans, at least until you start loading on the options. CTS buyers also can enjoy a decent expectation of reliability, as GM closes the gap with the Japanese automakers.\n\nVehicle type: Five-passenger, four-door sedan, rear-wheel drive.Engine: 3.6-liter V-6, 263 horsepower at 6,400 rpm, 253 pound-feet of torque at 3,100 rpm.\n\nTransmission: Six-speed automatic.\n\nWheelbase: 113.4 inches.\n\nOverall length: 191.6 inches.\n\nCurb weight: 3,861 pounds.\n\nEPA rating: 16 city, 25 highway.\n\nHIGHS: Crisp handling, distinctive new styling, moderate pricing.\n\nLOWS: Stiff suspension is sometimes harsh, lazy downshifts, mystery traffic warning.\n\nTHE LOWDOWN\n\nPERFORMANCE: The lesser V-6 has plenty of pull, with good torque for crisp off-the-line acceleration, although it runs out of juice as the tachometer climbs. Fuel mileage is not great but acceptable for a midsize sport sedan.\n\nThe six-speed automatic works well in most instances, reacting quickly to throttle input. But with the manual-shift option, downshifts are annoyingly slow to engage.\n\nDRIVABILITY: The CTS is an excellent road car, tight and balanced and ready to run. High-speed cruising is quiet and effortless, Cadillac style, while cornering is sharply responsive in the style of the best imported sport sedans.\n\nThe firm sport suspension is appreciated, although it sometimes turns harsh over rough surfaces.\n\nCTS is enhanced with stability control, traction control, antilock brakes and a full contingent of safety airbags.\n\nSTYLING: The look is softened from the original CTS, but still distinctive and aggressive. The bold grille stretches down below the bumper, similar to Audi and VW.\n\nINTERIOR: Upgraded and restyled for 2008, the cabin is both elegant and businesslike, with solid-looking trim, supportive seats and a navigation screen that descends into the dashboard when you’re not using it. Nice. Gauges and controls are simple and sporty-looking.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: An excellent update of Cadillac’s best car to date. There was one technical glitch: On Interstate 17, a disembodied voice urgently warned of a serious accident just ahead. Nope, no crash.\n\nPRICING\n\nBase price: $32,245.\n\nPrice as tested: $42,330.\n\nOPTIONS\n\n* Performance collection, including sport suspension, limited-slip differential, alloy wheels, $3,300.\n\n* Audio and navigation package, with Bose surround sound, 40 gig MP3 hard drive, satellite radio, navigation system, $3,145.\n\n* Automatic transmission, $1,300.\n\n* Luxury package, with rain-sensing wipers, upgraded audio, alarm, $850.",

      "expert_review": "With all the gloom and doom talk about General Motors, it’s important to realize that the company makes some excellent cars. The Cadillac CTS is one.\n\nThe CTS is a midsize, rear-wheel-drive sedan that can take on European brands without apology. The styling is lean and attractive, the interior is well-appointed and comfortable, and the V-6 engine has enough power to be entertaining while delivering decent gas mileage.\n\nThe base 3.6-liter engine with variable valve timing has 263 horsepower, while a direct-injection version of the same engine produces 304 horses. The transmission is a six-speed automatic that can be shifted manually.\n\nPrices start at $35,905 for the base model. All-wheel drive with the direct-injection engine begins at $40,760. Standard features include a Bose stereo with eight speakers, the Stabilitrak vehicle stability program, dual climate control, a tire-pressure monitoring system, 17-inch wheels, traction control and anti-lock brakes.\n\nThe sedan’s styling hints at forward motion, and fat fender flares emphasize the car’s muscular stance. The rear fenders taper toward the trunk as if to add an exclamation point to the performance look.\n\nRear-wheel drive is standard and all-wheel drive is optional. Rear-wheel drive gives the best balance for handling, while all-wheel drive gives enhanced traction for snow and rain.\n\nThe test car was equipped with the base engine and the sport suspension. The engine is smooth and quiet, and the power is spread across a wide power band that gives the car enhanced drivability. Acceleration is brisk, and the transmission’s firm shifts are pleasant. To reduce noise, Cadillac uses sound-deadening panels around the engine and seals the hood opening with a rubber seal like that on the doors.\n\nThe sports suspension yields responsive handling without creating a harsh ride.\n\nThe CTS interior is one of the best ever from Cadillac. The choice of materials seems fitting for a car in this segment, and the fit and finish of interior panels is excellent. The instrument panel is covered with a heavily textured material that is accented with French stitching. Three gauges rest under a small hood, and the center stack is covered with brushed aluminum. Tasteful strips of wood-grain trim highlight the dash and door panels.\n\nAt night, LEDs highlight items such as the door handles, and they also emit a soft glow from the bottom edge of the wood trim on the instrument panel.\n\nOn the road, the CTS is extremely quiet. Triple door seals and a windshield with no visible seal help reduce wind noise.\n\nThe CTS embodies a host of technological features that include a 40-gig hard disc that not only stores music but also allows the listener to pause the radio for up to 60 minutes and resume listening without a break. A surround-sound stereo is optional.\n\nThe optional navigation screen pops up from the center of the dash, and its display is easy to read and use. Voice activation is standard. Real-time traffic information is available over the XM satellite radio. The CTS has a single-slot DVD video system that enables DVDs to be viewed when the car’s transmission is in park.\n\nOther CTS features include a heated windshield washer fluid system, rear ultrasonic park assist, heated and ventilated front seats and a power tilt-and-telescoping steering column.\n\nPrice\n\nThe base price of the test car was $35,905. Options included 18-inch wheels with performance tires, a limited-slip differential, heated leather seats, Bose stereo with CD player, cooled front seats, tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel and keyless ignition. The sticker price was $44,450.\n\nWarranty\n\nFour years or 50,000 miles with a five-year, 100,000-mile powertrain warranty.\n\n2009 Cadillac CTS\n\nEngine: 3.6-liter, 263-hp V-6\n\nTransmission: Automatic\n\nRear-wheel drive\n\nWheelbase: 113.4 inches\n\nCurb weight: 3,845 lbs.\n\nBase price: $35,905\n\nAs driven: $44,405\n\nMPG rating: 18 city, 26 hwy.\n\nTo reach Tom Strongman, send e-mail to tom@tomstrongman.com.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in September 2013 about the 2014 Cadillac CTS. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2015, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\nNot everyone is a fan of Lady Gaga. Sure, she’s popular and talented, but only a certain type of person can appreciate her loud, flashy style. The same can be said for Cadillac’s redesigned CTS: Understated, it is not, but talented, it most definitely is.\nThe redesigned 2014 Cadillac CTS sedan provides an enticing blend of sport and comfort; its striking styling and athletic moves are exciting, and its tailored, luxurious interior coddles you.\nFresh looks are joined by some new powertrains, the Cadillac User Experience multimedia system and additional safety features. Only the regular sedan version is redesigned; the coupe and wagon carry over on the previous platform, as does the high-performance CTS-V sedan. Compare the 2013 and 2014 models here.\nCadillac is aiming for German heavyweights the BMW 5 Series and the Mercedes-Benz E-Class, the top sellers in the midsize luxury segment. The CTS also competes against the Lexus GS. Compare all four here.\nExterior & StylingWith its sharp creases and bold angles, the CTS was never at risk of blending into the background, and the 2014 version takes that attitude to new heights.\nThe sedan grew about 5 inches in length and takes on a longer, lower and wider stance. The sharp creases and angles are still a focal point but wear a softer, sleeker look. The biggest stunner, however, is the front end. Gorgeous, blade-like headlights slice through the oversized grille for an effect that’s both glamorous and imposing. Part of the emotion comes from the design, but the LEDs themselves — all 198 of them in front and back — contribute to the drama.\nThe overall result is striking and helps distinguish the sedan from the understated luxury-car pack in stylish defiance.\nHow It DrivesI first sampled a rear-wheel-drive version of the 272-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder and was underwhelmed. Around town, power was adequate, but accelerator hesitation was evident from a stop, and it took lots of pedal prodding to keep up on the highway.\nThe 2.0-liter works with a six-speed automatic, and it, too, had trouble keeping up. It would often annoyingly hunt for gears, and it held them too long on downhill stretches, causing the engine to rev high with a loud, harsh sound. Drivers shouldn’t have to wonder what the heck their transmission is doing.\nBetter matched are the 321-hp, 3.6-liter V-6 and the eight-speed automatic transmission. This combo was smooth and refined, delivering strong, even power through clean, prompt shifts. The eight-speed exhibited none of the six-speed’s confusion and supplied quick power out of corners for an engaging drive. Both the 2.0-liter and the V-6 are available with rear- or all-wheel drive.\nUnfortunately, neither engine provides competitive fuel economy. When equipped with rear-wheel drive, the 2.0-liter is EPA rated at 20/30/23 mpg city/highway/combined and the V-6 at 18/29/22 mpg. Premium fuel is recommended on the 2.0-liter but not the regular V-6. The BMW 528i’s turbo four-cylinder is rated at 23/34/27 mpg. The Mercedes E250’s four-cylinder turbo diesel gets an estimated 28/45/34 mpg, while the base gas-powered E-Class, the E350, is rated 21/30/24 mpg, a slight advantage over the base CTS sedan. The Lexus GS 350’s 3.5-liter V-6 brings up the rear with a 19/28/23 mpg rating.\nFuel-economy figures aren’t out yet for the newest addition to the lineup, the new rear-wheel-drive Vsport model, but chances are its buyers won’t care (this engine requires premium fuel). It offers pin-you-in-your-seat power with its 420-hp, twin-turbocharged V-6; its near-instantaneous torque, sport-tuned suspension and firm, precise steering elevate the car’s connected-to-the-road feel.\nThe new model is not to be confused with the 556-hp V-8-powered CTS-V, which carries over and wears the old generation’s design for 2014. Instead, the Vsport bridges a gap between the regular CTS and the CTS-V. It features 18-inch wheels, a quicker steering ratio, Brembo-brand brakes, a Track mode for the transmission, a heavy-duty cooling system, an electronic limited-slip differential and Cadillac’s Magnetic Ride Control adaptive suspension. Click here for a video review of the Vsport.\nOn the road, the 2.0-liter model demonstrated a high level of road isolation; bumps felt impressively damped and the cabin was whisper quiet. Jumping up from the model’s standard 17-inch wheels to the 3.6 version’s optional 19s changes everything. Its ride is firmer and choppier, and road noise is a constant presence. Cadillac shoppers looking for both performance and comfort should opt for the 3.6 but skip the larger wheels.\nHandling also impresses. Body lean is minimal, and the sedan slings through corners with a flat, balanced, controlled feel. Despite growing for 2014, it exhibits the agility of a smaller vehicle, partly thanks to weight savings. Due to extensive use of aluminum, the CTS weighs a couple hundred pounds less than its competitors, as well as its previous generation.\nInteriorOnce you sit in the CTS, you may never want to leave. The sedan is as luxurious inside as it is bold outside. Eight color palettes are available and all the trim is real: wood, aluminum, leather, suede and carbon fiber. Leather isn’t standard on the base model, however. Although there’s a dizzying array of materials pieced together, the colors and textures blend well and complement each other. Everything feels rich, and it’s obvious a lot of thought went into the cabin’s design and craftsmanship.\nMy favorite combines a low-gloss dark wood with a leather-wrapped dash, detailed stitching and suede panels. My least favorite is a cabin draped entirely in blue leather and suede — totally over the top.\nThe front seats are firm and supportive but comfortable on long trips. The sedan grew bigger for 2014, and the interior does feel more expansive. Front headroom and legroom are plentiful; with 39.2 inches of headroom, the CTS falls in the middle of the competition but bests them all with 42.6 inches of front legroom.\nMy 6-foot 2-inch drive partner found headroom pinched in back. With just 37.5 inches, the CTS has less than sedan versions of the 5 Series (38.3), E-Class (38.2) and GS (37.8). That sexy sloping roofline sacrifices some headroom.\nThe backseat is wide enough to hold three adults, but a tall center floor hump renders the middle seat unusable. There are several nice touches in back, including individual reading lights above the side windows, a fairly large storage bin in the pop-down center armrest and optional window sunshades.\nErgonomics & ElectronicsCadillac’s CUE voice-activated and touch-screen multimedia system is now standard, replacing the old version’s pop-up screen. The 8-inch unit is large with clear, easy-to-understand graphics. Under that, however, things become less than clear.\nLike the setup in the larger XTS and smaller ATS sedans, audio and climate functions are controlled via touch-sensitive panels under the screen and it’s definitely an acquired taste. I was having trouble adjusting the volume (the biggest thing on my CUE wish list is a traditional volume knob) and an engineer advised me to “caress” the panel rather than swipe or push it. The eyebrow-raising suggestion worked well, however. The learning curve was steeper for my drive partner; he continually bumped the seat-heater panel and accidentally muted the radio several times.\nOverall, the system is easier to understand and operate than central knob-based ones like BMW’s iDrive, but there’s still much more room for error than a traditional button-based setup. One nice feature is CUE’s flexible favorites menu. It allows you to make not only radio stations as pre-set favorites, but also navigation destinations and phone numbers; getting to the menu, however, requires another skilled caress.\nCargo & StorageThe CTS’ trunk seems huge with a wide opening, but by the numbers, it’s at the low end in terms of cargo capacity. With just 13.7 cubic feet of volume, it provides less than sedan versions of the 5 Series (14), E-Class (15.9) and GS (14.3).\nSmall-item storage is good, however. There’s a handy under-floor bin in the trunk, a large hidden cubby behind the CUE system good for cellphones and devices, and a fairly big center storage console. There are two cupholders in the front (look for them under strange power-sliding covers) and two in the back.\nAnnoyingly, a 60/40-split folding seat isn’t standard on the base model. A center pass-through is included across the lineup, however.\nSafetyThe CTS has not yet been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\nThe CTS gets several additional safety features for 2014, but they’re optional and bundled into pricey packages. The Driver Awareness Package includes blind spot warning, rear-cross traffic alert, forward collision alert and lane departure warning. All of these features alert the driver by vibrating the driver’s seat. The Driver Assist Package includes the Front and Rear Automatic Braking System, adaptive cruise control and Advanced Safety Belt Tightening. The latter cinches the seat belt if hard braking is detected in order to better situate front seat occupants in a crash.\nClick here for a full list of safety features.\nValue in Its ClassAt the drive event, Cadillac representatives talked a lot about elevating the CTS, and that they did — it’s more athletic, more luxurious and more stylish but also more expensive. Along with the Vsport model, the 2014 CTS is available in Standard, Luxury, Performance and Premium trims. Rear-wheel-drive 2.0-liter base models start at $46,025, about $6,000 more than model-year 2013 sedans.\nAlthough it got pricey, the new CTS gives you more substance for your buck — Cadillac says it added 20 standard features to the new model. Leather and navigation aren’t standard on the base version, however.\nEven with its newly inflated price, the CTS still undercuts German and Japanese rivals. Base sedan models of the 2014 BMW 528i start at $50,425, the 2014 Mercedes-Benz E250 Bluetec at $52,325 and the 2013 Lexus GS at $48,160; all prices include destination charges.\nLuxury isn’t a logical left-brain need; rather, it’s an emotional right-brain want and Cadillac is appealing to the latter. The CTS’ in-your-face opulence might not be for everyone, but premium sedan shoppers looking to break away from boring will want to check out Cadillac’s head-turning new sedan.\n\n\n\n          email",

      "expert_review": "Cadillac hates to call the CTS sedan the brand’s flagship.\n\nThat name lacks the prestige it once held. Flagships nowadays are more than the biggest and most expensive cars in any brand’s lineup. They are the spirit of a brand, which is not always tied to the highest sticker price.\n\nCadillac refers to the CTS sedan as its centerpiece vehicle, which is probably more appropriate.\n\nIt’s the center for Cadillac design, the center for a litany of CTS off shoots, such as the CTS Wagon, the CTS-V, the CTS Coupe and now the CTS Performance Collection — the sporty one between the base sedan and the mega-powerful supercharged CTS-V.\n\nSo what is the Performance Collection? My guess is that it’s a kind of new trim level for future Cadillacs and it premiers on the 2010 Cadillac CTS. Cadillac hasn’t admitted as much just yet (give it time).\n\nThey should, though, because the CTS Performance Collection creates a sport-centric Cadillac that focuses on mountain-curves fun, always tipping the scales toward performance. Ready to launch\n\nThis CTS starts with a 3.6-liter direct injection V-6 and the 304 horsepower it creates. The rear-wheel drive only version (other CTS sedans include an all-wheel drive options) stays true to performance cars.\n\nStrap yourself into the Recaro high performance seats, press down on the metal accelerator and launch. NASA couldn’t do it better.\n\nThe acceleration is direct and quick. The 19-inch performance summer-only tires grab the road and won’t let go. The sport suspension keeps the body stiff through cornering but pliant and comfortable on open roads. It’s a good combination that will leave the daily commuter relaxed and the boy racer satisfied.\n\nWhile I’m not a fan of paddle shifters in general, I found myself using them on this CTS when accelerating because I liked pressing the six-speed automatic transmission and holding gears a little longer than the car would let me under normal driving conditions. On the highway, I could drop to fifth and quickly pass someone before putting it back into overdrive and slowing down a little on Interstate 75 to avoid the watchful radar of state troopers near the Eureka Road exit.\n\nThis particular CTS also includes performance brakes and a performance cooling system to handle extra wear and tear.\n\nHave a seat\n\nPrior to the Performance Collection, buyers could get the Recaro seats only if they purchased a car with more than 500 horsepower — the V Series. The seats are now available in a car that won’t cost tens of thousands of dollars more.\n\nThe seats themselves are incredibly comfortable, holding driver and passenger snugly. With adjustable bolsters, you can actually sit down and hug yourself by adjusting the amount of air inside them. (There are 14 adjustable points on these seats and you can spend 30 minutes in the driveway trying to get exactly the right position.) These seats may cost $2,800, but they are worth every penny.\n\nFor real racers, the seats are designed to keep their bodies from flopping around as they push through corners on the race track. In the CTS, it puts you in the perfect position to respond to whatever’s in front of you.\n\nEasy to use\n\nThere were other features in my $52,000 test vehicle that I also enjoyed. They include the Bose 5.1 surround sound stereo and the navigation system. The CTS is well laid out with the driver in mind. The pop-up navigation system, which lifts out of the dash, is also ingenious. The graphics are clean and easy to read, and the stereo’s interaction with an iPod, which allows you to operate your music device through the touch screen, remains one of the best in the business.\n\nFor 2010, all CTS vehicles will include the under the hood strut brace to add rigidity to the body as well as a cool look when you lift the hood. (There’s also an appearance package under the hood to clean up the ugly wires and things other engines show off.)\n\nAnd the performance CTS maintains its sharp looks — the angular exterior, crisp headlights and tall tail lamps. It’s distinctive and stands out.\n\nThe CTS sedan is the lifeblood of Cadillac. Its face can be seen on nearly every vehicle in the brand’s lineup. This version is just another take on the popular sedan.\n\nJust don’t call it a flagship. Cadillac hates that.\n\nSburgess@detnews.com (313) 223-3217",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in May 2012 about the 2012 Cadillac CTS. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2013, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe 2012 Cadillac CTS sedan offers shoppers an attractive blend of design, luxury and performance.\n\nNow in its fifth model year, the CTS is the luxury sedan that began Cadillac’s design-led transformation when the car debuted as a 2003 model, and the second-generation car that launched for 2008 furthered the brand’s push into the sport-sedan market.\n\nThe CTS sedan starts at $36,810 (all prices include an $895 destination charge), but our test car was a high-end Premium model with a starting price of $49,185. With options, the as-tested price was $52,345. To see how the car’s specs compare with models from Infiniti, BMW and Mercedes-Benz, click here.\n\nStyling\nThe first-generation CTS set Cadillac on its current styling direction with its creased, angular shape, but the design philosophy really hit its stride with this second-generation car. Sharp edges create a look that’s uniquely Cadillac, but the design isn’t forced like it was in some places on the first-gen car.\n\nYou also can get the CTS in coupe and wagon body styles, but the design looks best to my eye on the sedan. Its rear styling is the most cohesive with the front end, which doesn’t differ much among body styles.\n\nThe 2012 CTS gets new grille styling, but the changes are subtle and the overall shield shape that’s become a familiar Cadillac design cue remains.\n\nRide & Handling\nOur test CTS had the optional performance suspension, and the car felt as firm as one of the high-performance V-Series versions that Cadillac sells, with harsh, jarring responses over bumps. It’s not far removed from the suspension tuning on Mercedes’ AMG models, like the C63 AMG, which is a firm-riding sport sedan.\n\nThe payback, however, is minimal body roll, which is welcome when the road bends. The performance suspension includes thicker front and rear stabilizer bars — as well as a limited-slip differential if you opt for summer tires — but the steering prevents the car from being as engaging as it might otherwise be; steering effort is light and steering feedback expectations remain unmet.\n\nTires play a significant part in the ride and handling equation, which is why it was unfortunate that our rear-wheel-drive CTS arrived with Bridgestone Blizzak winter tires on its 19-inch wheels. With temperatures in the 50s, spring was well under way when we drove the car. The summer tires that are normally part of the optional Performance Package would have been a better match for the conditions.\n\nEngine & Transmission\nThe CTS comes standard with a 3.0-liter V-6 engine, but our test car’s optional 3.6-liter V-6 and six-speed automatic transmission are a special pair among drivetrains. The transmission’s shifts are unobtrusive, and it’s always in the right gear for the driving situation. The automatic is also incredibly responsive; press down on the gas pedal and it downshifts immediately. A lot of automatics make you wait before kicking down, which makes it refreshing to drive one that’s so attentive to the driver’s wishes.\n\nThe 3.6-liter V-6 has power in reserve for accelerating around other cars on the highway, and the transmission responsiveness remains. The sedan moves out well, and the V-6’s mechanical growl sounds good in the process. This V-6 makes more power for 2012 — 318 horsepower, an increase of 14 hp — and is also 20 pounds lighter than its predecessor. The engine received a number of changes, including new cylinder heads with integrated exhaust manifolds, a composite intake manifold and lighter, stronger connecting rods.\n\nWith the automatic transmission, the 3.6-liter V-6 is rated at an EPA-estimated 18/27 mpg city/highway. That’s slightly better than the 2012 Infiniti M37’s estimate of 18/26 mpg, but it trails the ratings for the 2012 BMW 535i (21/31 mpg) and the 2012 Mercedes-Benz E350 (20/30 mpg). However, unlike those three models, the CTS can run on regular gas as opposed to more expensive premium fuel. Only the supercharged CTS-V requires premium.\n\nInterior Quality & Comfort\nThe CTS’ cabin quality has held up well since this generation first hit the road as a 2008 model, and it’s still competitive against newer entrants like the 535i and M37. Among the highlights are consistently applied premium materials including stitching on the dashboard and door trim, and smartly integrated features like an available navigation touch-screen that can rise from the dash or, when lowered, display a list of radio presets. The location of the air-conditioning controls at knee-level seemed a little curious, but it didn’t take long to understand the logic of the setup; your hand falls right to the controls, so you barely need to move it to adjust the temperature.\n\nWhile the cabin is high on premium materials and luxury features, what it doesn’t have in abundance is space. The front of the cabin is comfortable but snug, and the optional Recaro-brand sport seats — similar to those available in the CTS-V — contribute to the sensation with adjustable side bolsters that keep you locked down in corners.\n\nThe Recaro bucket seats have adjustable lumbar support, but even with it backed off completely, you can still feel the curve of the backrest pushing against your lower back. It wasn’t painful, but if you’re sensitive to this kind of thing, it definitely warrants extra attention if you take the CTS for a test drive.\n\nThe CTS sedan’s bigger problem is backseat space. Despite being significantly larger on the outside than the redesigned BMW 3 Series sedan, the CTS’ backseat feels smaller. I’m 6 feet 1 inch tall and didn’t have enough legroom or headroom. It’s not nearly as comfortable as a midsize four-door needs to be.\n\nSafety\nThe CTS sedan performed well in crash tests conducted by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. It received the IIHS’ 2012 Top Safety Pick designation, which is awarded to cars that receive Good scores in each of its four tests, as well NHTSA’s five-star rating, the highest possible.\n\nStandard safety features include antilock brakes and an electronic stability system, which are required on cars beginning with 2012 models. Also standard are side-impact airbags for the front seats, side curtain airbags for both rows and active front head restraints. GM’s emergency communications system, OnStar, includes one year of complimentary service that has features like automatic crash notification, stolen car assistance and the ability to remotely unlock the doors.\n\nA backup camera and rear parking sensors are optional. For a list of safety features, check out the Features & Specs page, or see how well child-safety seats fit in the CTS Car Seat Check.\n\nCTS in the Market\nIt’s hard to overstate what the CTS has meant to Cadillac from a design and performance perspective. It’s been the cornerstone of the brand’s reinvention over the past decade and has come to represent the modern Cadillac image.\n\nThe CTS checks most of the boxes it needs to in the luxury sport sedan segment with its distinctive design, upscale interior and refined 3.6-liter V-6 drivetrain. That said, discerning handling enthusiasts will get more enjoyment from the more expensive BMW 5 Series.\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "It’s difficult to find a way to describe the Cadillac CTS-V sedan in a way that would appeal to a parent’s priorities when shopping for a car. Things like, “This was the most fun car I’ve ever driven!” and “I felt like a total badass in it!” probably aren’t statements that will put the CTS-V on responsible parents’ radar. But all of the above statements are absolutely true.\nIf you’re in the rare position to use your car as both a family taxi and a toy, you’ll hit the jackpot with this high-performance 2012 Cadillac CTS-V sedan.\nCadillac’s CTS-V can be a family car if you want it to be. The four-door sedan is capable of transporting a family and the cargo area will hold your stroller or suitcases, but you’ll be paying an awful lot to not use its best feature: a supercharged 6.2-liter V-8. This is coming from a mom who usually cares about paint colors and cupholders rather than the numbers and decimal points on the window sticker.\nI was blown away by the driving experience in the CTS-V. In addition to the staggering amount of male attention I received on the road, the CTS-V was constantly tempting me to take corners faster, accelerate from red lights quicker and engage in otherwise inappropriate behavior for someone with a convertible child-safety seat installed in the backseat. It’s powerful, it’s fast, it handles incredibly, it looks sharp and it’s an absolute thrill to drive.\nThe CTS-V comes in just as high on pricing as it does with the thrills. With a starting price of $64,110, including an $895 destination charge, it may be out of a family’s reach for reasons more than its raciness. I tested an upgraded model with sport details like 19-inch polished aluminum wheels, Recaro-brand sport seats and a faux-suede-wrapped steering wheel and gearshift that bumped my test car’s price to $71,485.\nEXTERIORThe 2012 CTS-V is refined and dignified but menacing at the same time. It’s such a classic, handsome sedan that at first glance you wouldn’t suspect there’s one of the fastest engines in production under the hood. The tell-tale sign that separates the CTS-V from a regular CTS sedan is the tricolored-checkered V badge on the side. It’s got a much more impressive-looking front grille, too.\n\nIts exterior styling only caused two minor inconveniences for me. The angular rear door openings seemed small when I leaned in to strap my daughter into her child-safety seat, and the CTS-V’s high sidewalls and small windows made for slightly compromised visibility. Its average step-in height won’t cause problems for most, but the car has heavy doors that children may need assistance with.\nThe CTS-V’s trunk is average sized; it can hold grocery bags and a single stroller at the same time. While I found the trunk to be spacious enough for my things, I question its ability to fit a double-stroller because of the shallow trunk opening.\nThe CTS-V has a supercharged 6.2-liter V-8 engine that makes 556 horsepower. With those kinds of specs, I especially enjoyed that my test car had a six-speed manual transmission. The part that wasn’t so enjoyable was seeing the low fuel-economy numbers the trip computer would spit at me. The manual-transmission CTS-V I drove gets an EPA-estimated 14/19 mpg city/highway; the automatic-transmission CTS-V averages 12/18 mpg. With my almost exclusive stop-and-go city driving during my weeklong test drive, my fuel-economy average was in the single digits. To add salt to that particular wound, the supercharged engine requires premium gasoline.\n\nSENSE AND STYLEFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): More than Fair/Less than GreatFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Groove-On\nINTERIORThe CTS-V’s interior is luxurious but a bit dated, especially when looking at the displays and multimedia interface.\n\nLooks aside, all the amenities are there — keyless start and entry, dual climate control, heated front seats, Bluetooth connectivity, LED interior ambient lighting and a screen that pops up from the dash to display maps. My upgraded test car came with optional ventilated front seats, which is the ultimate in luxury in my opinion. No one wants to sweat inside a classy car like the CTS-V.\nCabin space is a little tight inside the five-seater, but not prohibitive. Being a midsize sedan, I was expecting it to feel larger inside. Taller adults sitting in the second row might find themselves wanting more legroom.\nStorage space is on the lighter side in the CTS-V, as well. There are four cupholders and an average-sized center console and glove box. The front door pockets are almost useless because they’re so small. There are seatback pockets, but they’re better suited for magazines than the thick board books my toddler enjoys taking along in the car.\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNTStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): FairCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): More than Fair/Less than Ample\nSAFETYThe 2012 Cadillac CTS-V sedan earned an overall safety score of five stars out of five from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. It received five stars in front- and side-impact crash tests and four stars in the rollover crash test.  It also has been named a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, earning the top score of Good in front, side, rear and roof-strength crash tests.\nOne of my favorite things about the CTS-V (and all GM vehicles in general) is OnStar comes standard, but only for a limited time and then a subscription is required. OnStar is great to have not only in case of emergencies, but it also keeps temptations and distractions at a minimum when you’re on the road and trying to use the navigation system. Instead of hurrying to type a street name at a red light into the nav system, you can use OnStar to get directions that are automatically downloaded to the car. Less fiddling with tech in the car while driving equals a much safer ride.\nThe CTS-V also has standard rear-wheel drive, four-wheel-disc antilock brakes with brake assist, an electronic stability system with traction control, active front head restraints, rear parking sensors, a backup camera and six airbags, including side curtains for both rows.\nI found car seat installation to be relatively painless in the CTS-V, though access to the two sets of Latch anchors was a bit tough due to stiff seat cushions and deeply inset anchors. Since my daughter is now in a forward-facing convertible, my husband still had a reasonable amount of legroom in the front passenger seat, but if she was in a rear-facing safety seat, his legroom would most likely be severely compromised.

      "expert_review": "I want a Batmobile. Since I’m making requests, I’d also like an Alfred, too. In the absence of funds for either of those things, I’ll happily accept a 2011 Cadillac CTS-V Sport Wagon. I christened it the BatMOMbile, because driving it made me feel like a superhero and not at all frumpy.\nThe 2011 CTS-V Sport Wagon is the kind of car that makes you forget you’re running errands and instead makes you feel like the world is as conquerable as picking up your dry cleaning.\nThe CTS-V wagon is stealthy. Outside, it looks like the Batmobile with its angles and sharp corners. On the inside, it wraps its passengers in comfort with a touch of sportiness and faux suede. This car will get you from the Justice League to the Commissioner’s office in no time flat. It’s got a 556-horsepower, supercharged V-8 engine and a standard six-speed manual transmission to make any parent transform from an innocent bystander to a vigilante grocery shopper who’s quicker than Superman in a phone booth.\nSorry, wrong hero.\nThe CTS-V Sport Wagon is a performance-oriented car, and its manual transmission was a lot more fun than I imagined it would be. I really enjoy driving a stick-shift, but I was worried that all my stop-and-go driving would wear me out. But the response and the handling was thrilling and so very worth the effort.\nThe 2011 CTS-V Sport Wagon has a starting MSRP of $62,360. My test car cost $66,085.\nEXTERIORThere’s no mistaking a Cadillac for any other car. The distinctive angles of the CTS-V earned some looks out on the road, and I won’t pretend I didn’t enjoy that. The grille was predominantly mesh and added to the masculinity of a typically female-oriented segment. It reminded me of a shield.\n\nThe CTS-V Sport Wagon was not completely perfect all the time. Visibility takes a little getting used to at first. There is a low roof that many parents will likely hit their heads on while loading smaller kids into the car.\nMy older kids had few issues opening and closing the wagon’s doors, making me feel less like Alfred. I like that. The step-in height ensures that you won’t need to provide any additional assistance to kids than any other wagon or sedan out there.\nThere are also some niceties like a standard power liftgate, enabling me to load groceries in a single bound. Be prepared, Super Moms and Dads, the cargo area has a high floor. On the other hand, it’s deep and has a pass-through to the second row in the event you need it.\nUnder the hood, the CTS-V wagon has a 556-hp, supercharged 6.2-liter V-8 that was surprisingly quiet. I thought for sure there’d be a lot of rumbling and grumbling and throaty exhaust notes. I got them at idle and was pleased with the sound.  However, when pushed, the CTS-V maintained its stealth status. I was expecting a lot more noise and would have enjoyed it.\nThe CTS-V wagon gets an EPA-estimated 14/19 mpg city/highway and uses premium gas. With the optional six-speed automatic transmission, the wagon gets 12/18 mpg.\n\nSENSE AND STYLEFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): GreatFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Groove-On\nINTERIORWhere the BatMOMbile, er, Cadillac CTS-V wagon really saved this damsel was the interior. The Recaro-brand sport seats were infinitely adjustable and thus comfortable for fancy sport seats.  They were lean and not cushy by any stretch, but they felt and looked luxurious with their faux suede inserts. They hugged me tight, like the warm embrace of Bruce Wayne.\n\nThe center stack was an array of buttons and controls that made me think I’d need the help of a sidekick to help me operate them. I got used to them, but it sure felt like Mission Control. The center stack had piano-black trim pieces, but it didn’t look too over the top.\nWhat I loved the most about the center stack was the optional navigation display that would rise out of the dash and display information or the view from the backup camera when the car was in Reverse. Put the car in Drive and the screen would drop back down into the dash and display only pertinent information, like my radio station. I really appreciated that with the push of a button the screen would come up and stay there, or that I could drop it back down at will.\nThe wagon is a tight fit widthwise. This car is narrow but long. While we were close to each other in the CTS-V wagon, we had plenty of legroom. There was a lot of room in the long cargo area, too. I never once maxed it out and was never let down in its grocery-getting endeavors. To add to its functionality, there were cargo anchors to tie down your arch-nemesis once you’ve caught him red-handed.\nThe only time I’m reminded of an arch-nemesis in the CTS-V is when I wondered who designed the rear cupholders. They’re shallow, so any drink’s spill-ability is increased with a turn at a corner. And trust me, there are no slow corners taken in the BatMOMbile.\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNTStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): AmpleCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\nSAFETYI was worried about the CTS-V Sport Wagon’s backseat because I was sure that the rear seats would be too sculpted to find a good fit for child-safety seats.\nWhile the slanted seatback lessened the gap between it and the booster seat, there were some fit issues with the seat’s narrowness. The boosters occasionally traveled over the seat belt buckles, so there was definitely a “sweet spot” where the seat fit great. When the boosters weren’t in the “sweet spot,” it was a little frustrating for my kids. In this car, a booster seat with Latch connectors (Clek, for example) is a great idea to minimize whining and angst from kids (and parents) when buckling.\nThe two sets of lower Latch anchors sit behind a zippered opening. A rear-facing infant-safety seat fit well when finally installed and had about an inch to spare with the driver’s seat adjusted to my height. Find out how the 2011 CTS-V wagon performed in MotherProof.com’s Car Seat Check.\nThe CTS-V Sport Wagon has standard rear-wheel drive, adaptive headlights, all-disc antilock brakes, an electronic stability system with traction control, a backup camera with rear parking sensors, active head restraints and six airbags, including side curtains for both rows.\nGet more safety information about the 2011 Cadillac CTS-V Sport Wagon here.",

      "expert_review": "Not everyone is a fan of Lady Gaga. Sure, she’s popular and talented, but only a certain type of person can appreciate her loud, flashy style. The same can be said for Cadillac’s redesigned CTS: Understated, it is not, but talented, it most definitely is.\n\nThe redesigned 2014 Cadillac CTS sedan provides an enticing blend of sport and comfort; its striking styling and athletic moves are exciting, and its tailored, luxurious interior coddles you. \n\nFresh looks are joined by some new powertrains, the Cadillac User Experience multimedia system and additional safety features. Only the regular sedan version is redesigned; the coupe and wagon carry over on the previous platform, as does the high-performance CTS-V sedan. Compare the 2013 and 2014 models here.\n\nCadillac is aiming for German heavyweights the BMW 5 Series and the Mercedes-Benz E-Class, the top sellers in the midsize luxury segment. The CTS also competes against the Lexus GS. Compare all four here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nWith its sharp creases and bold angles, the CTS was never at risk of blending into the background, and the 2014 version takes that attitude to new heights.\n\nThe sedan grew about 5 inches in length and takes on a longer, lower and wider stance. The sharp creases and angles are still a focal point but wear a softer, sleeker look. The biggest stunner, however, is the front end. Gorgeous, blade-like headlights slice through the oversized grille for an effect that’s both glamorous and imposing. Part of the emotion comes from the design, but the LEDs themselves — all 198 of them in front and back — contribute to the drama.\n\nThe overall result is striking and helps distinguish the sedan from the understated luxury-car pack in stylish defiance.\n\nHow It Drives\nI first sampled a rear-wheel-drive version of the 272-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder and was underwhelmed. Around town, power was adequate, but accelerator hesitation was evident from a stop, and it took lots of pedal prodding to keep up on the highway.\n\nThe 2.0-liter works with a six-speed automatic, and it, too, had trouble keeping up. It would often annoyingly hunt for gears, and it held them too long on downhill stretches, causing the engine to rev high with a loud, harsh sound. Drivers shouldn’t have to wonder what the heck their transmission is doing.\n\nBetter matched are the 321-hp, 3.6-liter V-6 and the eight-speed automatic transmission. This combo was smooth and refined, delivering strong, even power through clean, prompt shifts. The eight-speed exhibited none of the six-speed’s confusion and supplied quick power out of corners for an engaging drive. Both the 2.0-liter and the V-6 are available with rear- or all-wheel drive.\n\nUnfortunately, neither engine provides competitive fuel economy. When equipped with rear-wheel drive, the 2.0-liter is EPA rated at 20/30/23 mpg city/highway/combined and the V-6 at 18/29/22 mpg. Premium fuel is recommended on the 2.0-liter but not the regular V-6. The BMW 528i’s turbo four-cylinder is rated at 23/34/27 mpg. The Mercedes E250’s four-cylinder turbo diesel gets an estimated 28/45/34 mpg, while the base gas-powered E-Class, the E350, is rated 21/30/24 mpg, a slight advantage over the base CTS sedan. The Lexus GS 350’s 3.5-liter V-6 brings up the rear with a 19/28/23 mpg rating. \n\nFuel-economy figures aren’t out yet for the newest addition to the lineup, the new rear-wheel-drive Vsport model, but chances are its buyers won’t care (this engine requires premium fuel). It offers pin-you-in-your-seat power with its 420-hp, twin-turbocharged V-6; its near-instantaneous torque, sport-tuned suspension and firm, precise steering elevate the car’s connected-to-the-road feel.\n\nThe new model is not to be confused with the 556-hp V-8-powered CTS-V, which carries over and wears the old generation’s design for 2014. Instead, the Vsport bridges a gap between the regular CTS and the CTS-V. It features 18-inch wheels, a quicker steering ratio, Brembo-brand brakes, a Track mode for the transmission, a heavy-duty cooling system, an electronic limited-slip differential and Cadillac’s Magnetic Ride Control adaptive suspension. Click here for a video review of the Vsport.\n\nOn the road, the 2.0-liter model demonstrated a high level of road isolation; bumps felt impressively damped and the cabin was whisper quiet. Jumping up from the model’s standard 17-inch wheels to the 3.6 version’s optional 19s changes everything. Its ride is firmer and choppier, and road noise is a constant presence. Cadillac shoppers looking for both performance and comfort should opt for the 3.6 but skip the larger wheels.\n\nHandling also impresses. Body lean is minimal, and the sedan slings through corners with a flat, balanced, controlled feel. Despite growing for 2014, it exhibits the agility of a smaller vehicle, partly thanks to weight savings. Due to extensive use of aluminum, the CTS weighs a couple hundred pounds less than its competitors, as well as its previous generation.\n\nInterior\nOnce you sit in the CTS, you may never want to leave. The sedan is as luxurious inside as it is bold outside. Eight color palettes are available and all the trim is real: wood, aluminum, leather, suede and carbon fiber. Leather isn’t standard on the base model, however. Although there’s a dizzying array of materials pieced together, the colors and textures blend well and complement each other. Everything feels rich, and it’s obvious a lot of thought went into the cabin’s design and craftsmanship.\n\nMy favorite combines a low-gloss dark wood with a leather-wrapped dash, detailed stitching and suede panels. My least favorite is a cabin draped entirely in blue leather and suede — totally over the top. \n\nThe front seats are firm and supportive but comfortable on long trips. The sedan grew bigger for 2014, and the interior does feel more expansive. Front headroom and legroom are plentiful; with 39.2 inches of headroom, the CTS falls in the middle of the competition but bests them all with 42.6 inches of front legroom.\n\nMy 6-foot 2-inch drive partner found headroom pinched in back. With just 37.5 inches, the CTS has less than sedan versions of the 5 Series (38.3), E-Class (38.2) and GS (37.8). That sexy sloping roofline sacrifices some headroom.\n\nThe backseat is wide enough to hold three adults, but a tall center floor hump renders the middle seat unusable. There are several nice touches in back, including individual reading lights above the side windows, a fairly large storage bin in the pop-down center armrest and optional window sunshades.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nCadillac’s CUE voice-activated and touch-screen multimedia system is now standard, replacing the old version’s pop-up screen. The 8-inch unit is large with clear, easy-to-understand graphics. Under that, however, things become less than clear.\n\nLike the setup in the larger XTS and smaller ATS sedans, audio and climate functions are controlled via touch-sensitive panels under the screen and it’s definitely an acquired taste. I was having trouble adjusting the volume (the biggest thing on my CUE wish list is a traditional volume knob) and an engineer advised me to “caress” the panel rather than swipe or push it. The eyebrow-raising suggestion worked well, however. The learning curve was steeper for my drive partner; he continually bumped the seat-heater panel and accidentally muted the radio several times.\n\nOverall, the system is easier to understand and operate than central knob-based ones like BMW’s iDrive, but there’s still much more room for error than a traditional button-based setup. One nice feature is CUE’s flexible favorites menu. It allows you to make not only radio stations as pre-set favorites, but also navigation destinations and phone numbers; getting to the menu, however, requires another skilled caress.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe CTS’ trunk seems huge with a wide opening, but by the numbers, it’s at the low end in terms of cargo capacity. With just 13.7 cubic feet of volume, it provides less than sedan versions of the 5 Series (14), E-Class (15.9) and GS (14.3). \n\nSmall-item storage is good, however. There’s a handy under-floor bin in the trunk, a large hidden cubby behind the CUE system good for cellphones and devices, and a fairly big center storage console. There are two cupholders in the front (look for them under strange power-sliding covers) and two in the back.\n\nAnnoyingly, a 60/40-split folding seat isn’t standard on the base model. A center pass-through is included across the lineup, however.\n\nSafety\nThe CTS has not yet been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nThe CTS gets several additional safety features for 2014, but they’re optional and bundled into pricey packages. The Driver Awareness Package includes blind spot warning, rear-cross traffic alert, forward collision alert and lane departure warning. All of these features alert the driver by vibrating the driver’s seat. The Driver Assist Package includes the Front and Rear Automatic Braking System, adaptive cruise control and Advanced Safety Belt Tightening. The latter cinches the seat belt if hard braking is detected in order to better situate front seat occupants in a crash.\n\nClick here for a full list of safety features.\n\nValue in its Class\nAt the drive event, Cadillac representatives talked a lot about elevating the CTS, and that they did — it’s more athletic, more luxurious and more stylish but also more expensive. Along with the Vsport model, the 2014 CTS is available in Standard, Luxury, Performance and Premium trims. Rear-wheel-drive 2.0-liter base models start at $46,025, about $6,000 more than model-year 2013 sedans.\n\nAlthough it got pricey, the new CTS gives you more substance for your buck — Cadillac says it added 20 standard features to the new model. Leather and navigation aren’t standard on the base version, however.\n\nEven with its newly inflated price, the CTS still undercuts German and Japanese rivals. Base sedan models of the 2014 BMW 528i start at $50,425, the 2014 Mercedes-Benz E250 Bluetec at $52,325 and the 2013 Lexus GS at $48,160; all prices include destination charges. \n\nLuxury isn’t a logical left-brain need; rather, it’s an emotional right-brain want and Cadillac is appealing to the latter. The CTS’ in-your-face opulence might not be for everyone, but premium sedan shoppers looking to break away from boring will want to check out Cadillac’s head-turning new sedan.\n\nemail",
