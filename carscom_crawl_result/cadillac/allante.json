      "expert_review": "The last thing we remember was the wife trying to revive us in thedriveway.\n\nHaving graduated cum laude in resuscitation, she knew immediately what to do when the old man did a header onto the pavement.\n\n“Toss a brew in his face and try not to get it on his tie,“ she ordered No. 1 twin.\n\nThe reason for performing a full gainer was that we foolishly looked-without glasses-at the window sticker on the 1993 Cadillac Allanteconvertible we were test-driving.\n\nWithout the magnifiers the sticker appeared to read: $82,375, apparentlyexplaining why some refer to General Motors Corp. as the “Mark ofExtravagance,“ or a slogan along those lines.\n\nOnce the bifocals were attached to the nose, we realized the price wasonly $62,375. Oh happy days. While $60,000 is ridiculous, $80,000 is absurd.\n\nCadillac General Manager John Grettenberger said Allante is Cadillac`stest-bed vehicle. Allante helped check out the reliability of systems such as computer-command ride control and traction control before they were includedin other Cadillac cars.\n\nGrettenberger said there will always be a low-volume test-bed car atCadillac (Cadillac sells about 2,000 Allantes annually), though it may notalways be the Allante. In the future the midsize “baby“ Cadillac theautomaker is developing might be the technology guinea pig.\n\nIt`s not that Allante is a DeSoto masquerading as a Cadillac, it`s justthat low volume doesn`t justify a high price-test bed or no test bed.\n\nThe Allante debuted in 1987. The 1993 version is light-years better thanthe original in performance, ride, handling and quiet.\n\nPerformance gets a huge boost in 1993 with the introduction of the 4.6-liter, 32-valve, 295-horsepower Northstar V-8 engine to replace the 4.5-liter, 200-horsepower V-8 of 1992. The Allante boasts a 0-to-60 m.p.h. timeof 7 seconds and a top speed of 150 m.p.h., and if it weren`t for the rumblesound effects of the exhaust, you probably wouldn`t know the engine wasrunning.\n\nThe engine is smooth and quiet and delivers a kick. What it doesn`tdeliver is fuel economy. The mileage rating is 14 m.p.g. city/21 highway,which brings the car a gas-guzzler tax of about $1,700.\n\nNot only does the mileage rating require frequent stops for petrol, those visits are less than entertaining because the fuel-filler neck is low on thebody panel behind the driver`s door. The location means you have to stoop tofill. Michael Jordan would have to get down on one knee to reach the fillerneck-if Chevrolet would let him.\n\nCadillac says Northstar is a “world-class“ engine, strong words fromthe same folks who brought us the $62,375 price tag. “World-class“ is theindustry`s new buzzword.\n\nThe Allante delivers world-class quiet, perhaps. But world-classreliability, durability and dependability? Hey Cadillac, two weeks on themarket does not world-class make. And world-class mileage? Absolutely not.\n\nW here world-class takes on meaning is when you drive Allante and realizethe care and attention given the management of ride and handling. There`sindependent four-wheel suspension so that the bump you hit with the left fronttire doesn`t transmit harshness to the other three.\n\nThere also is something called “road sensing,“ which means thesuspension “reads“ the road by measuring the vehicle`s wheel position andbody motion. Sensors monitor road conditions to instantly change suspensionsettings from soft to firm or vice versa. In layman`s terms, it`s calledpampering.\n\nTraction-control also is standard. That system prevents wheels fromspinning and the car from slipping and sliding when it takes off from thestoplight, as the Allante`s anti-lock brakes keep wheels from locking and the car from skidding when it tries to stop at the light.\n\nWhen we drove in heavy rain, we accelerated from the light and theAllante dug in and kept gaining speed as if the pavement we re dry. Cars to ourright and left were tiptoeing through the water while our car stepped lively. Traction control provides a most reassuring feeling when you know much of yourmotoring will be in snow.\n\nAdd to all this the Allante`s speed-sensitive steering, which varies theamount of steering effort required based on vehicle speed-less effort to pull between those narrow yellow lines at the mall, a bit more to cross the lineseparating lanes on the interstate.\n\nAnother plus is the driver-side air bag. But Cadillac needs to put the“SRS,“ or “supplemental restraint system,“ lettering on the steeringwheel hub housing the bag. If you are going to provide the safety cushion, letthe person behind the wheel know it`s there.\n\nBecause Allante is a test bed for new technology at Cadillac, why didn`tthe automaker opt to test the addition of a passenger-side air bag? At least, to Cadillac`s credit, the steering wheel offers a tilt option, a feature notalways available when a bag is offered.\n\nAnother plus is that this convertible doesn`t have blind spots. There are small glass panels behind the driver`s and passenger`s windows; they provideenough of an opening so you can see other vehicles on the side before youchange lanes.\n\nThe convertible top is semi-powered, meaning it unlocks and locks fromthe front header when you pull a control knob, but still requires a lift/pull/push routine to get the top down and under the tonneau cover and fasten thelatch on that cover.\n\nA couple of gripes, however, are that the cupholders block access to theashtray, and that there is an overwhelming number of buttons, dials andnumbers on the instrument panel above the console, including the radio, airconditioning, compact disc player and driver information center (time,temperature, miles until the gas tank is empty and the like, plus suchwarnings as “headlights suggested“).\n\nThe final complaint is with the passenger`s seat, which rattled each time we struck a bump. It wasn`t a world-class rattle, but enough of a nuisancethat we`d be at the front of the line at the dealer`s service department themorning after the car was purchased.\n\nAdditional standard equipment includes every item that starts with thedescription “power.“\n\nNotes\n\nFor 1993 Chevrolet has dropped the GEO Storm hatchback, the ugly attemptat making a sedan look like a wagon. The Storm coupe adds a new color, a crossbetween plum and purple. Very nice.",

      "expert_review": "Usually, I get to drive each test car for a week. During that time I try to drive at least 500 miles in every driving situation one could hope to encounter in Central Florida. That gives me a good feel for the way car a reacts in our tough driving environment.\n\nBut this week’s test drive is a little different. Because of a scheduling mix-up, Cadillac had an Allante in its test fleet that had reached the end of its road and soon would be auctioned. I got to keep it for a few extra weeks.\n\nI have said that Cadillac’s Allante, the most expensive American production car you can buy, is well-worth the price. I still feel that way after an extended test drive, but there are some minor improvements that could make the car even better.\n\nENGINE, PERFORMANCE\n\nCritics rapped the first luxury/sports two-seater convertibles, citing their disappointing performance. Much has changed since 1987.\n\nThis year the car’s fuel-injected 4.5-liter, V-8 engine produces 200 horsepower and delivers superb performance. Cadillac says 0 to 60 mph takes just 8.0 seconds.\n\nAnd those numbers are going to improve. Late in the 1992 model year, Cadillac will debut in the Allante what could to be the finest American V-8 engine produced. Called the Northstar, the Cadillac-only engine will feature overhead camshafts and 32 valves. Horsepower is expected to be near 300.\n\nAn Allante with a Northstar V-8will pace next year’s Indy 500 stock car race – without modifications.\n\nBut this year’s engine is wonderful. You never think of Cadillacs as racy, but you should hear the Allante’s burbling exhaust. With the top down, it inspires spirited driving. With the top up, you can’t hear it unless you really wind up the engine.\n\nI found the engine to be a willing – though not overpowering – performer. That’s good, because a car like the Allante needs to impress with finesse as well as with muscle. Cadillac has struck a nice balance between the two.\n\nThe four-speed automatic transmission proves General Motors makes the world’s finest automatics. Not only is the shifting perfectly calibrated, it is ultra-smooth and the gears are designed to extract a decent mix of performance and economy.\n\nIntown, the Allante delivered 15 miles per gallon. On the highway, I got better than 23 mpg.\n\nYou expect a slew of standard equipment on a car that costs over $50,000. Cadillac delivers. The Allanteis equipped with traction control. Because it is a V-8-powered, front-wheel-drive car, things could get a little loose on wet pavement. However, the traction control ensures that tires never lose their grip.\n\nSTEERING, HANDLING, BRAKING\n\nThe Allante is not billed as a sports car, but it could be.\n\nIt excels in every driving situation – on smooth, flat roads; through fast, sweeping curves; during hard braking; and into quick turns. In fact, any twist in the road you might find likely will present no problem for the Allant e.\n\nThe suspension is firm, but that does not translate into a ride that rattles your spine over speed bumps and bad pavement. If you like cars with superior mechanical specifications and high-tech equipment, you’ll be pleased with the Allante.\n\nFIT, FINISH, CONTROLS\n\nThis was another area where the original Allantes came up short. Some say that’s still the case because the car does not have a power top.\n\nAfter you learn to operate the top, it can be raised and lowered in less than a minute. Unlike other convertibles, you have do this standing outside of the car. It would be more convenient to have an automatic top, but raising and lowering the black canvas top is not a problem.\n\nI do have a complaint in this area, though. There was wind noise around the windows and where the top and body join.\n\nI think the Allante’s interior is better than that of any other American car. The power red leather seats were excellent. After several long trips, I fel great. The interior has a nice, warm ambience.\n\nThe car’s powerful computer system provides the driver with all the information he could need. Included are range, miles to empty, oil condition, trip odometer and trip time, outside temperature – among others.\n\nThe test car featured big, analog gauges that were clear, easy-to-read and glare-free. The speedometer and computer system also give metric readouts. All the switches are easily reached, sensibly laid out and lighted. The sound system, AM/FM stereo cassette with CD player, is terrific.\n\nThe trunk is fairly large for a two-seater. It can hold 16.5 feet of cargo. There is more storage space behind the seats.",
