      "expert_review": "As I was motivatin’ over the hill, I saw Maybelline in a Coup DeVille.\n\n”Maybelline” Chuck Berry’s Maybelline is of a certain age now and her DeVille is history, replaced by the 2006 Cadillac DTS.\n\nAnd unlike the scenario in the song, an old V-8 Ford would not catch this newest Cadillac — not with 275 horsepower echoing from a 4.6-liter V-8. The car also has electronic stability control to keep it straight and even an alarm that pings if a turn signal is left on too long.\n\nThe turn-signal warning is worth mentioning because it flies in the face of the company’s mission. Like all Cadillacs of recent vintage, the DTS is marketed to younger drivers, not older ones. Yet Cadillac does not want to leave Maybelline behind.\n\nThis is a hefty cruiser made for the highway, capable of running across Interstate 80 the way a German driver might hustle up the Autobahn in a 6 Series BMW or an S Class Mercedes-Benz. But at a price under $50,000 — even loaded with lots of luxury and refinement — it’s significantly less expensive than those Bahn-burners.\n\nSmoothly powerful, its four-speed automatic transparent during operation, the DTS rolls the roads with the straight-ahead surge some Americans will relish, and it exhibits little of the boaty body roll during cornering that for years has come with large American steel.\n\nIt also has front-wheel drive, a bit odd for a big luxury vehicle and, surprisingly, not a major help on snowy roads. Instead of digging in to draw, as most FWD vehicles do, it seemed to become light up front. I found myself being a bit defensive, even in a couple of inches of snow. That lightness was also noticeable during subtle steering at highway speeds, yet in corners, the car became heavier and tighter.\n\nStrange.\n\nBut most of the time, the DTS rode flat, solid, and steady. The Luxury II level I drove was roomy, powerful, and well-appointed.\n\nThe DTS starts out with dual-depth front-passenger air bags, head- and side-curtain air bags, antilock braking, adjustable front bucket seats (a rare bench is also available), three-zone climate control, and high-intensity discharge headlamps.\n\nBump up to the test model (about $3,000 above the base price of $42,000), and you get heated and cooled front seats, heated rear seats, and electronic parking assist. Other model upgrades feature enhanced performance, seats that massage, upgraded Bose sound systems, and real wood trim.\n\nThe outside is more big Cadillac than the smaller, edgier models of the past couple of years, but still forward looking. Upright headlamps at each end of an egg-crate grille create a solid frontal stance, while a sharply defined, boxy trunk is a short chop of the endless rear decks of old.\n\nInside, the front is a veritable cockpit, with a dash and center control stack sloped up and away, making the interior feel spacious. In the back, a couple of large folks on either side would have plenty of room, while a smaller passenger would be comfortable in the center.\n\nCadillac has done a fine job of plucking performance, power, and even some styling from its other models, while retaining the luxury-cruiser look many older customers still covet. And thanks to that alarm, none of them will be leaving the turn signal on.\n\n– – –\n\nTHE BASICS\n\nBase price/as tested: $43,695/$47,775\n\nFuel economy: 21.1 miles per gallon in Globe testing\n\nAnnual fuel cost: $1,463 (at $2.374 per gallon, regular, 13,000 miles per year)\n\nTHE EARLY LINE\n\nIt’s a Cadillac that has to maintain tradition, even as the company successfully adopts an edgier image.\n\nTHE SPECIFICS\n\nDrivetrain: Front-wheel drive\n\nSeating: 5 occupants\n\nHorsepower: 275\n\nTorque: 292 lb.-ft.\n\nOverall length: 207.6 inches\n\nWheelbase: 115.6 inches\n\nHeight: 57.6 inches\n\nWidth: 74.8 inches\n\nCurb weight: 4,009 lbs.\n\nTHE SKINNY\n\nNice touch: The upright, rectangular, retro clock at mid-dash. Amidst electronic wizardry, this timepiece will take you back in time.\n\nAnnoyance: I’m not sure they should not have kept rear-wheel drive for this model.\n\nWatch for: Younger drivers being attracted to some expansive American luxury.\n\nRoyal Ford can be reached at ford@globe.com.",

      "expert_review": "The Cadillac DTS might be among the last of the big boats, but it’s no ordinary land yacht.\n\nThis car has the comfort of a cruise ship, and all that’s lacking is white-clad waiters bringing food and drink.\n\nWith a car such as this one, you could ride in the spacious back seat while someone did the driving for you, and enjoy food, libations and the car’s excellent audio system.\n\nDon’t permanently relegate yourself to the back seat, though. Our test vehicle, as comfy and cushy as it was, offered a bit of driving fun, too. You might want to take the helm (before imbibing) for at least part of your journey.\n\nOur vehicle was the 2007 DTS Performance Sedan ($48,540 plus $820 freight), which comes with the uplevel 4.6-liter V-8 engine, rated at 292 horsepower (vs. 275 for the base 4.6 engine). Besides the more-powerful engine, the performance model has GM’s patented Magnetic Ride Control system, Stabilitrak electronic stability control, a performance suspension, 18-inch chrome wheels (17-inch wheels are on the base model), and upgraded H-rated tires.\n\nThere is a slight decrease in fuel-efficiency with the more-powerful engine – 17 miles per gallon city/24 highway vs. 17/25 with the base engine. But the extra peak horsepower adds some fun to the mix for that slight drop in highway mileage. This could be improved upon if Cadillac would upgrade the DTS from its four-speed automatic transmission to perhaps at least a six-speed. In this area, the DTS is lagging other luxury cars in today’s market – most have at least six speed automatics, and the new Lexus LS has eight speeds.\n\nThe Performance Sedan’s price includes almost everything you can get on a DTS, whose base model begins at just $41,390. Leather seats are standard, of course, but ours came with the upgraded Tehama leather ($1,995), as well as the optional GPS/DVD navigation system ($1,945). These extras raised the sticker price to $53,300 (including freight).\n\nBesides the performance upgrades, this version also has a long list of convenience items that are included in the higher price. Among them are tri-zone automatic climate control, power massaging front seats, heated and cooled front bucket seats, heated outboard rear seats, heated leather/wood steering wheel, memory for two drivers, heated outside power mirrors with turn-signal indicators, ultrasonic front and rear parking assist, heated washer fluid, remote start, four-way power lumbar control for the rear seat, eight-speaker Bose audio system with CD changer (replaced in our car by the nav system upgrade), power tilt/telescopic steering column, dark walnut interior trim, and rain-sensing windshield wipers, one of the great new auto technologies.\n\nAs for the DTS in general, this is the car that Cadillac called the DeVille until last year, when it was significantly upgraded and renamed.\n\nFor 2007, the DTS, comes with a few enhancements. Among new standard equipment this year are chrome wheels, which come with new center caps featuring the Cadillac wreath-and-crest badge in color.\n\nGM says options such as XM satellite radio, a cargo mat and rear sunshades – previously offered only in the most-expensive packages, are now more readily available. Some changes in exterior colors have been made for ’07, as well. And inside, the dark Cashmere accent and aniline leather have been replaced with a cocoa hue, Cadillac said. In addition, the center stack is now dark argent metallic.\n\nA new Cadillac key fob makes its debut as well, not only with the DTS but on several other Cadillac models as well.\n\nAnd indicative of GM’s expanding global marketing of Cadillac, the navigation system now is offered with maps for Korea and Taiwan, and Arabic is available as one of the languages on the driver-information center, replacing Italian. The analog clock on the instrument panel also been improved to make it easier to read.\n\nJust as with the DeVille, the DTS is aimed almost entirely at the over-60 crowd, with no obvious features to appeal to younger buyers except for the performance package. This is understandable, as Cadillac already has a full stable of new vehicles designed for younger buyers.\n\nThe DeVille became the DTS to follow the same pattern as the other alphabet names of recent new Cadillac cars – such as CTS, SRX, XLR, STS – but otherwise remained much the big boat that its predecessor was. It also retained its front-wheel drive, while all of the other Cadillacs now come with rear- or all-wheel drive.\n\nSome restyling was involved with the change to the DTS, even though its overall look is clearly DeVille-like. The “art and science” design theme of other recent Cadillacs is evident in the front and rear of the DTS. The front end has all-new sheet metal, along with a new grille, fascia and high-intensity-discharge Xenon headlamps. Cadillac says that the deck lid, rear quarter panels, rear fascia and taillights also are new.\n\nInside, the DTS has new seats that GM says are “optimally engineered for comfort and support”; a new instrument panel; and new wood trim.\n\nStandard or optional high-tech features include four-channel antilock brakes and traction control, four-channel StabiliTrak with brake assist, and Magnetic Ride Control. The massaging front seats come on the two most-uplevel models.\n\nAs for the stated fuel-economy ratings, many DeVille owners have reported getting even better highway mileage than the EPA estimates suggest. That’s probably because these are drivers who usually take it easy and conserve fuel with their driving habits.\n\nWe earlier tested the DTS with the base 275-horsepower engine, and found it to be quite peppy and certainly more than adequate for this heavy car, which weights just over two tons..\n\nNeither model of the DTS offers the sporty driving experience of the smaller STS and CTS sedans or SRX wagon. This car trades suspension stiffness for a softer ride to accommodate its older consumers.\n\nChassis tuning “focused on achieving a smooth, quiet, refined ride,” the company says. Not that the previous version didn’t already have that, mind you. The new one is just better, and even on some of the jarring speed bumps that dot our neighborhoods these days, the car rode quite comfortably.\n\nThe seats are quite comfortable, even in the back. While our car came with bucket seats, the DTS base model still comes with a three-person front bench seat, which remains the favorite arrangement of many older customers.\n\nThe trunk has 18.8 cubic feet of space, and the lid opens to a fully vertical position, leaving a large opening for easy loading and unloading of large objects.\n\nThe car’s high-tech features – which largely go unnoticed by the driver and passengers – include four-channel antilock brakes and traction control.\n\nAlso standard are dual-stage (driver) and dual-depth (front passenger) air bags, roof-rail curtain air bags and front seat side-impact thorax air bags; cruise control; OnStar; XM satellite radio; and a tire-pressure monitoring system, among other things.\n\nAn “express-open” sunroof is optional, but was not included on our car.\n\nCadillac says the DTS comes with a “body-frame integral construction; strategically engineered crumple zones in front and rear; and comprehensive use of high-strength steel,” designed to help protect the occupants in a collision.\n\nAll 2007 Cadillac owners – not just DTS buyers – get 12 months of access to the “Cadillac Virtual Advisor” through the OnStar system.\n\nThis feature gives the driver three-day weather forecasts and traffic reports in most major markets. The system also monitors traffic on as many as three personalized routes and reports on up to 10 selected stocks, GM says — at the touch of a single button.\n\nG.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nFor 2006, a new front-wheel-drive sedan called the DTS replaced the long-lived DeVille in Cadillac’s lineup. The DTS had been the top-level model in the DeVille series. For about two decades, the DeVille has accounted for nearly half the sales in its segment. Competitors include the Audi A6 and Infiniti M35. For 2008, Cadillac introduced two new safety options for the DTS: Lane Departure Warning and Side Blind Zone Alert systems.\n\nSix airbags are installed, and one of two Northstar V-8s powers the DTS.\n\nExterior\nStyling of the DTS is “more architectural and linear,” said Gary Cowger, former president of General Motors North America, during its initial appearance. The new model’s styling evokes Cadillac’s STS sedan.\n\nLed by an eggcrate grille with central wreath-and-crest badging and fresh front-end sheet metal, the DTS features vertical xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights and LED taillamps.\n\nNew color options for 2008 include Crystal Red, Black Cherry, Double Espresso and Blue Diamond. Cadillac says there will be a limited edition Carbon Flash Metallic DTS, but it will not go on sale until the spring of 2008 and no details are available.\n\nA four-channel StabiliTrak electronic stability system with brake assist is standard, and Magnetic Ride Control is optional. Seventeen-inch chrome wheels are standard, and 18-inch wheels are optional. Riding a 115.6-inch wheelbase, the DTS sedan is 207.6 inches long overall and 74.8 inches wide.\n\nThe Platinum DTS edition, available in the fall of 2007, boasts 18-inch wheels, a 292-horsepower Northstar 4.6-liter V-8 engine and a standard sunroof and DVD navigational system.\n\nInterior\nThe DTS can hold either five or six occupants, with a choice of front bucket seats or a front bench. Genuine burl wood trim is available.\n\nDual-zone automatic climate control is standard, and a tri-zone system is optional. Available features include heated and cooled front seats, heated rear seats, a heated steering wheel, Adaptive Remote Start (with a personalization provision), power folding mirrors, rain-sensing wipers and heated windshield-washer fluid. Front and rear ultrasonic parking assistance, IntelliBeam automatic high-beam headlights, an in-dash six-CD changer with MP3 capability and adaptive cruise control also are available. Additional features include XM Satellite Radio, a DVD-based navigation system and GM’s OnStar communication system.\n\nUnder the Hood\nCadillac’s 4.6-liter Northstar V-8 comes in a choice of two configurations in the DTS. The base V-8 produces 275 hp and 295 pounds-feet of torque. Optional is a quicker-revving Northstar that makes 292 hp and 288 pounds-feet of torque. Both engines work with a four-speed automatic transmission.\n\nSafety\nTwo new optional safety systems were introduced for 2008. The Lane Departure Warning system uses a camera between the rearview mirror and windshield to detect and warn drivers when they’ve strayed from their lane. The Side Blind Zone Alert uses radar to sense when objects are in the driver’s blind spots.\n\nSix standard airbags include side-impact, side curtain and a new dual-depth front passenger unit that deploys either shallow or deep depending on crash severity, seat belt usage and occupant position. All-disc antilock brakes are standard, as is an electronic stability system.",
