      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Cadillac CT6?\n\nThe Cadillac CT6 is a full-size sedan that seats five. It’s Cadillac’s flagship car and competes with the Genesis G90 and Volvo S90. The CT6’s standard engine is a 335-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6. A 500-hp, twin-turbocharged 4.2-liter V-8 goes in the Platinum trim level, and the CT6-V gets a 550-hp version of the engine. Both engines work with a 10-speed automatic transmission, and all-wheel drive is standard. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Cadillac CT6?\n\nNewly standard active safety features include forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, lane keep assist, blind spot warning, rear cross-traffic alert and GM’s Safety Alert Seat. Heated, power-folding side mirrors are also standard. The available Super Cruise hands-free driver-assist system is now usable on more than 200,000 miles of highways in the U.S. and Canada. \n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Cadillac CT6 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard all-wheel drive will resonate with many luxury car shoppers in northern parts of the country. Other standard features include navigation, heated front seats and remote start. Available features include Magnetic Ride Control, 20-inch wheels, adaptive cruise control, night vision, a rearview camera mirror, a digital instrument panel, a head-up display, ventilated front seats, heated rear seats, a heated steering wheel, rear sunshades and a hands-free trunk lid. \n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Cadillac CT6?\n\nThe CT6 offers contemporary styling, a quiet cabin and a powerful available V-8 engine. The base version is competitively priced, but the high-end Platinum version is expensive. The suspension could also be more athletic, and cabin materials don’t quite reach the level of quality offered by some competitors.",

      "expert_review": "Competes with: Audi S8, Mercedes-AMG E63, BMW 750\n\nLooks like: A sleeper car to dust all varieties of luxury sedans, with the only giveaway to its performance focus being a small “V” badge on the back\n\nDrivetrain: 550-horsepower, twin-turbocharged 4.2-liter V-8 and 627 pounds-feet of torque; 10-speed automatic transmission; all-wheel drive\n\nHits dealerships: TBD\n\nCadillac has taken the wraps off the 2019 CT6 V-Sport, its flagship sedan’s performance variant boasting an exciting new engine under the hood.\n\nRelated: More 2018 New York Auto Show Coverage\n\nThe CT6 is the third Cadillac model to offer a V-Sport variant, joining the CTS and XTS sedans. It also serves as a preview for the other changes to come to the 2019 CT6 lineup as a whole. The CT6 will offer Luxury and Sport trims with unique features as well as new headlight and taillight designs.\n\nExterior\n\nThe CT6 V-Sport looks fairly innocuous — without closer inspection, it looks like a normal sedan. But there are a few touches that hint at the monster lurking underneath the hood: The front has a V-inspired mesh grille and new, horizontally oriented LED headlights. The CT6 V-Sport retains the vertical LED signature lighting of last year’s model, with an LED line dripping off the outside of the headlight and down into the lower fascia. There are also unique lower aero trim pieces, gloss-black side window covers and 20-inch V-Sport-specific wheels.\n\nInterior\n\nThe biggest change inside appears to be the shedding of the touchpad interface for the multimedia system; it’s replaced by a circular knob control with dedicated buttons around it for commonly used features like the audio system, phone or navigation (if equipped). The multimedia screen is still 10.2 inches and has 1080-pixel HD resolution.\n\nUnder the Hood\n\nUnder the hood of the CT6 V-Sport is a brand-new engine that is exclusive to Cadillac, according to Automotive News. Cadillac calls the engine a “clean-sheet design” with a few unique engineering flourishes that allow it to remain compact enough to fit into the CT6’s engine bay, which otherwise holds a four-cylinder or a V-6.\n\nThe twin-turbocharged 4.2-liter V-8 makes dizzying power numbers: 550 horsepower and 627 pounds-feet of torque. The turbochargers actually sit in the middle of the “V” formed by the cylinders, which Cadillac says also helps eliminate turbo lag, as they’re mounted closer. A 10-speed automatic transmission and a retuned all-wheel-drive system with a mechanical limited-slip differential in the rear and revised torque split are both standard. There are also tweaks to the steering and magnetic-ride-control shock absorbers for sportier engagement.\n\nThe CT6 V-Sport’s 20-inch wheels are wrapped in summer-only performance tires, developed exclusively for Cadillac. There is also a new 19-inch Brembo brake system — also said to be tailor-made for the CT6 — to bring things to a quick halt when needed.\n\nSafety\n\nInterestingly, Cadillac will not offer its superb Super Cruise system on V-Sport versions of the CT6; it will, however, be offered on the other CT6 trim levels. Further available safety features include forward collision alerts, forward and reverse automatic emergency braking, blind spot warnings, lane keep assist, night vision in the instrument panel, around-view monitor, automatic parking assists, front pedestrian detection and a surround-vision recorder, which serves as a front and rear dash cam when driving and activates the 360-degree camera system when the security system is activated. There is also one final new feature available on the 2019 CT6 that’s worth noting: rear pedestrian detection.\n\nNo word yet on the 2019 CT6 V-Sport’s price or release date, but I’m champing at the bit to get behind the wheel of one.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
