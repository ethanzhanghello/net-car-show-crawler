      "expert_review": "Cadillac overhauled the CTS-V for 2016, giving it gobs more power and a new platform featuring all sorts of performance goodies. A few features and packages are new for 2017, but otherwise it’s the same 640-hp supersedan loaded with big power, big brakes and big capabilities. Compare the current-generation CTS-V with the previous one here.\n \nI drove a feature-packed CTS-V that came in at $103,360. To keep me from totaling this rear-wheel-drive rocket ship in colder Chicago weather, Cadillac ditched its standard Michelin Pilot Super Sport summer tires in favor of winter tires.\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nA Carbon Black exterior package is a new option for 2017. The $6,950 package includes the Carbon Fiber Package and really does add a lot to the V’s appearance. The Carbon Black Package says goodbye to the regular tacky chrome mesh grille and replaces it with a black chrome piece, plus it also includes Cadillac’s aerodynamics-enhancing Carbon Fiber Package, which gives the V a more aggressive front splitter, a hood vent, a rear diffuser and a taller rear spoiler.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThe Cadillac CTS-V’s supercharger is smaller and more efficient than in the previous-generation CTS-V, and Cadillac says that helps it build power-making boost more quickly. Hot damn, did it work. It’s the supercharger that helps the CTS-V stand out among high-powered sedans. There’s immediacy to the acceleration that the Cadillac’s turbocharged counterparts lack.\n\nMany high-powered turbocharged cars, like the Audi RS 7 and BMW M5, have a lag between cracking the throttle and experiencing max acceleration. On the V, the whine of the supercharger is audible as soon as the accelerator is even slightly opened. Much to the chagrin of the rear tires, further opening the throttle unleashes the car’s 640 hp instantaneously. Cadillac says zero-to-60 mph happens in 3.7 seconds. BMW says the M5 does it in 4.2 seconds and Audi specs the more powerful version of the RS 7 at 3.6 seconds with all-wheel drive; the V and M5 are only available with rear-wheel drive. Compare the Cadillac CTS-V with its competitors here.\n\nThe Cadillac’s 640 hp is perfectly harnessed by an eight-speed automatic transmission, which might be the true star of the show. The combination of low-end power and torque from the engine with a transmission that screams through its first few gears makes the CTS-V a riot to drive, even when you can’t blast around at wide-open throttle. A few throttle blips here and there from a stoplight give a little taste of its capabilities. When unleashed, and when the tires finally find traction, the CTS-V’s pure acceleration is the gut-wrenching type that makes you feel like you’ve fallen off a cliff. The track-capable V pulls hard and can hit an advertised top speed of 200 mph.\n\nYou’d think a 600-plus horsepower, supercharged V-8 would be more than capable of providing enough visceral engine and exhaust noise to not need electronically augmented engine sounds, like turbocharged competitors have, but apparently you’d be wrong. The Cadillac CTS-V electronically augments engine noise, piping the natural sound of the engine through the stereo, but it clearly sounds digitized. How is it possible that a 640-hp V-8 needs help sounding good?\n\nOur 2017 Cadillac CTS-V wore Pirelli Sottozero winter tires in factory sizes. Winter tires typically numb steering responsiveness, turn handling to mush, and give up dry acceleration and braking traction. I can’t say for sure if it was the car or the tires, but the CTS-V retained top-of-the-class steering precision with these winter tires; I felt no diminished or loosened connectivity to the road. Either the tires were really good or the Cadillac’s steering is so good that there’s still plenty of feedback left with mushy winter tires, giving the V a performance-sedan edge even with tires that are a much safer alternative in cold weather.\n\nInterior\n\nThe Cadillac CTS-V comes up short on interior quality at its $103,000 as-tested price, and I think a lot of that cheapness comes from the dashboard’s center control panel, which is littered with touch-sensitive controls. The face is piano black with matte silver highlights and looks like it belongs in a much cheaper car.\n\nBeyond the horrible usability of this center stack, which we’ll get to later, having traditional dials and mechanical buttons allows another touch point that can be covered in metal or a polished, high-quality material, which you don’t get with touch panels. There’s a hidden storage compartment behind the faceplate that’s flimsy and loose when opened, though the hidden cubby itself is a nice touch, with its USB port and a wireless charging pad.\n\nThe interior is otherwise nicely covered in high-quality materials, including generous use of imitation suede (called sueded microfiber) on the door pockets, ceiling and seats. The Carbon Black Package adds carbon fiber interior trim and a steering wheel covered in the sueded microfiber. Like I said earlier, not a whole lot of substance for the price.\n\nThe sueded-microfiber-lined front seats are probably the single greatest pair of sports seats I’ve experienced in a factory performance sedan. These optional Recaro seats ($2,300) should be studied and copied by all performance-car automakers (sorry, Cadillac). After being abused by the Nissan GT-R’s horrible front seats on a long trip over the summer, I was relieved to spend a few hundred miles in a sports car seat that was not only form-fitting but also supremely comfortable. Plus, it had power adjustment and heated functions (unlike, say, the Ford Mustang GT350’s Recaro seats).\n\nIt wasn’t just me who found the Recaro seats noteworthy, either. My wife called them out as extra comfortable, and she rarely finds good things to say about sports cars. My dad praised them, too, and he has two fake hips. That’s a shining endorsement from the Bruzek family.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nThe Cadillac User Experience multimedia system — CUE for short — encompasses the connectivity and car features displayed on the large touchscreen. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are standard; they integrate smartphone features of voice calling, text messaging, streaming audio apps and more as seamlessly as ever. Both services display through the touchscreen and look brilliant on the massive display. In fact, I don’t recall CarPlay looking this user-friendly in other cars, with its easy to read — and touch — buttons and text.\n\nCUE usability starts to fail when you’re required to use the surrounding touch panels for the home button and the volume and climate controls, which have vague feedback and are hard to find without looking. The “buttons” vibrate with a haptic touch that feels like you’re using a cheap smartphone. CUE itself isn’t that bad of an operating system for controlling multimedia functions, but interacting with the volume and home button, as well as controlling the climate functions, is off-putting.\n\nA lot happens on the screen through the use of various cameras, including a standard Curbview camera that peers down at the CTS-V’s expensive, protruding front splitter to show when the car is close to a parking block. It’s a grand idea, but unfortunately the car’s screen size has outpaced the quality of its parking cameras. It’s hard to get a sense of dimension from the low-resolution images.\n\nCargo & Storage\n\nThe CTS-V’s 13.7 cubic feet of trunk space is narrow but deep, and the optional folding backseat can accommodate longer items, though its opening isn’t the full width of the backseat. It’s more of a cutout between the passenger area and the trunk. It’s included in the $2,075 Luxury Package. Overall cargo space is similar to sedans like the M5’s 14 cubic feet and the Mercedes E63’s 12.9 cubic feet, but it comes up short versus the RS 7, which is a hatchback.\n\nSafety\n\nThe 2017 Cadillac CTS underperformed in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s small overlap front crash test, earning a marginal rating on its scale of good, acceptable, marginal and poor. The BMW 5 Series also scored marginal in this test. Another knock against the V in terms of safety is that it doesn’t offer an automatic braking function as part of its collision warning system; it only alerts the driver when a collision is imminent.\n\nLike the Curbview camera, the CTS-V’s front and rear parking cameras’ images are low-quality. The backup camera image lacks definition and clarity compared with the same from Mercedes, Audi and BMW.\n\nWhat you won’t find in competitors’ cars, however, is Cadillac’s optional rearview mirror camera. Part of the Luxury Package, the rearview mirror can be flipped between the regular reflective mirror and a display that uses a dedicated camera to show an image of what’s behind the CTS-V. I still haven’t grown used to this type of display and its wide field of view; I prefer the traditional mirror.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nThe previous Cadillac CTS-V we tested cost less than $100,000, which I think is the sweet spot for this supersedan that starts at $86,590. Above $100,000, the CTS-V’s interior starts to feel less impressive, mainly because competitors like the M5, RS 7 and E63 are right at home as $100,000 luxury sedans. An M5 starts at $95,095 and the RS 7 begins at $111,650. The 2018 E63 doesn’t have pricing yet, but the 2016 S — the only E63 offered — was $102,625.\n\nPerhaps the V’s greatest asset is that you get the bulk of its capability without opting for an additional performance package or trim level, like those German competitors. The M5’s Competition Package and the RS 7 Performance trim include significant performance-enhancing hardware and are big-money upgrades: The M5 package adds $7,300 and the RS 7 Performance trim costs $18,800 more than the base RS 7. What’s under the skin of the 2017 CTS-V is a bargain in this price range, and you don’t have to pay extra to get it.\n\nEditor’s note: This post was updated Jan. 6 to reflect an update to the test vehicle’s price.",

      "expert_review": "Extreme performance sedans like the 2016 Cadillac CTS-V are often so focused on performing on a track that they make a commute or quick drive to the grocery store a lesson in discomfort.\n\nNot the 2016 Cadillac CTS-V. It’s gone so far to please daily drivers that some buyers might prefer more visceral delight from this 640-horsepower track star — just to break up the mundanity.\n\nI tested the CTS-V on a fast track — Road America in Elkhart Lake, Wis. — and around suburbs and rural roads over a few days in late summer. It’s a remarkable machine and, in a way, quite a bargain even at $85,990 including destination and gas-guzzler tax.\n\nExterior & Styling\nCadillac has taken its all-edges design about as far as it can go with the CTS. It’s a modern look, but it’s aged well on past generations. There’s no reason to think this interpretation won’t stand the test of time as well.\n\nThe V-Series model adds a side vent that dramatically alters the car’s profile, as well as three air vents on the hood that are harder to see at a quick glance. As with past generations of the CTS-V, the 2016 gets a unique open-mesh grille instead of the three wide slats that make up the standard CTS grille.\n\nI’ve never been a fan of the CTS-V’s looks myself; to me it seems more like an aftermarket product than an original design.\n\nHow It Drives\nUltra-sport sedans like the BMW M5 and Mercedes-Benz E63 AMG have a habit of reminding you of their ultra-ness over every bump in the road. In the CTS-V, there were times tooling around the farmlands of Wisconsin that I really did forget I was in a performance car.\n\nThe ride is extremely comfortable even on rather rough roads, and the exhaust that rip-roars when the car is in Track mode goes mostly silent when in Tour. But then a turn approaches and the CTS-V reacts like an extension of your arms through the steering wheel, and you snap back to the realization that you’re piloting something special. And when you need to pass … well, the other car knows it, too.\n\nIn between those times, though, the CTS-V doesn’t spark you to demonstrate its prowess. Soon after driving the CTS-V, I was piloting Audi’s RS 7 around Chicago and it was the opposite. While not quite as comfortable as the CTS-V, it was just on the right side of a rough ride, and every touch of the accelerator brought renewed interest in me opening it up. Perhaps Cadillac went too far to please those who ask for such daily compliance.\n\nOn the track, though, there’s little to quibble about.\n\nRoad America is a long course that shows best with cars that pump out a lot of power. The CTS-V checks that box quite well. The car’s supercharged, 6.2-liter V-8 generates 640 hp at 6,400 rpm and 630 pounds-feet of torque at 3,600 rpm. It drives the rear wheels through an eight-speed automatic transmission.\n\nIt wasn’t really the long straights — where you could hit a top speed of more than 150 mph — that impressed me most; it was coming out of a corner and being able to quickly get speeds back into triple digits before the next tight turn approached.\n\nThen the huge brakes — 15.3-inch rotors up front and 14.3 in the rear — kick in. I probably could have pushed the brakes much harder than I did. There’s another layer of performance in this car that a moderately skilled driver like myself won’t be able to touch, but that’s the beauty of the CTS-V.\n\nThe CTS-V does, however, make you a better driver on a course like Road America — or at least feel like one. I’ve taken many a car around this track over the years, and unlike something like a Dodge Viper, which tests the very limits of your driving ability just to stay straight, the CTS-V lets you go into the toughest turns with pure confidence. Maybe it’s the advanced limited-slip differential — or the Michelin Pilot Super Sport high-performance tires — but I was amazed at how rarely I scurried to recover the times I went into a corner too fast or without the proper line.\n\nComing up the hill to Road America’s front straight is a gut-dropping experience, and even with that elevation I was able to touch just north of 150 mph. That speed in that location requires quite a bit of effort, and of course a lot of braking on the other end. Two turns later, on a bit of open road, I was reaching 130 without effort — that’s a showcase for the car’s true speed.\n\nInterior\nThe typical high-performance niceties are all over the cabin of the CTS-V, like a thick steering wheel wrapped in microfiber (the generic term for synthetic suede most associated with the Alcantara brand). The application in the CTS-V is indeed suedelike, not the feel of those towels you use to detail such a machine after a wash.\n\nThere’s microfiber all over the CTS-V. It serves as the headliner and seat inserts and covers the steering wheel, shift knob and shift boot. Even the seatbacks are covered with it, whether you get the base seats or the optional Recaro seats.\n\nLet’s talk about those seats.\n\nThe base seats are indeed comfortable, and I drove extensively with no complaints from my finicky back. Usually I’m not a fan of Recaros because they sacrifice too much comfort for the “performance” of hugging your body, often too tightly for my taste.\n\nThese Recaros, however, I do recommend. Not only do they hug in a Goldilocks, just-right way, but because after hours of pushing the limits around Road America, I felt not a scant bit of soreness in my back. I was 45 minutes into my drive home from the event in a Mercedes C-Class before my back was uncomfortable. Get the Recaros if you’re checking off boxes at a Cadillac dealership.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe 2016 CTS-V and the regular CTS get Apple CarPlay, which I hadn’t experienced before this evaluation. (Android Auto will be offered later in the model year.) Integrated within Cadillac’s advanced Cadillac User Experience system, it completely takes over when accessed … which is strange. I did prefer CarPlay’s straightforward menus, and the Siri integration for messaging worked well, too. But some things Cadillac does well — like shortcut presets for functions from navigation destinations to radio stations — were sorely missed. You can go back and forth between CarPlay and the CUE menus, of course, but that seems counterintuitive.\n\nThe system still sits amid a center console adorned with touch-sensitive control panels for stereo and environmental systems. Many on our staff are not fans of those panels. While executed about as well as possible, it still feels somewhat odd to use these controls, which align with raised pieces of metal trim. You have to place your finger just right to get the desired reaction.\n\nI’ve never been a fan of the motorized cupholder cover in the CTS, which is present here as well. It seems unnecessary and easy to break.\n\nCargo & Storage\nWith 13.7 cubic feet of cargo volume, the CTS-V’s trunk sacrifices no space compared with the regular CTS — not a guarantee in a track-optimized car. Similarly, a split, folding backseat is still available.\n\nCompare other CTS and CTS-V specifications here.\n\nSafety\nIn Insurance Institute for Highway Safety testing, the CTS received top scores in all crashworthiness tests to which it was subjected, which excluded the small overlap front crash test.\n\nThe CTS-V includes blind spot warning, rear-cross traffic alert, forward collision alert and lane departure warning. All these features alert the driver by vibrating the driver’s seat. Unfortunately, the CTS-V doesn’t offer the Front and Rear Automatic Braking System that’s optional on the CTS. With this option, the CTS scores superior in IIHS’ front crash prevention rating. With collision alert only, its rating is basic.\n\nValue in Its Class\nIt’s not easy to say $85,990 is a bargain, especially given I just recommended adding the $2,300 Recaro seats. And you should really get the $5,500 Carbon Fiber Package, too, not just because it provides more downforce on the track, but because it looks better. So the CTS-V I’d want is $97,140 when all is said and done.\n\nBut the Cadillac is faster and better equipped than the 2016 BMW M5, which starts at $96,395, or the 2016 Mercedes E63 AMG, which costs $102,625. Sadly, I have not tested those two cars in the same way at Road America. But on the street they definitely sacrifice daily comfort that the CTS-V does not. (Compare these three models side by side.)\n\nSend David an email",
