      "expert_review": "The first truck in the 96-year history of the Cadillac brand is destined to be a bestseller for General Motors’ otherwise stagnant luxury-vehicle line.\n\nBut the 1999 Escalade isn’t a new vehicle. It’s a gussied-up GMC Yukon/Chevrolet Tahoe, built alongside the others at GM’s plant in Arlington, Texas.\n\nBecause Cadillac dealers were screaming to GM for a sport-utility vehicle to battle the highly popular Lincoln Navigator and to entice people under retirement age into their showrooms, GM rushed the Escalade from concept to market in less than a year.\n\nPlans originally were to wait until the new-generation Suburban, Tahoe and Yukon debuted this fall to roll out a Cadillac sport-utility vehicle, but dealers insisted that they get an SUV sooner.\n\nEven though there was a rush to bring the Escalade to showrooms, GM didn’t cut any corners. This vehicle is a worthy competitor for the Navigator and other vehicles in the burgeoning full-size SUV market segment, which includes the Range Rover, Isuzu Trooper/Acura SLX and Toyota Land Cruiser/Lexus LX 470.\n\nMy significant other, who is a great fan of full-size SUVs, pronounced the Escalade her favorite among the class. “Tell them we’re not giving it back, just to send us the payment book,” she said during our week with the Escalade.\n\nBut at a list price of $45,875 (plus $640 transportation), it had to go back, even though I didn’t want it to. I have children to feed.\n\nThis is the ultimate Yukon or Tahoe, complete with comfortable perforated leather seats (a bit cooler on the backside than solid leather seats in hot climates like Texas’), rugged yet refined four-wheel drive (suited for any driving conditions, including deep snow or off-road mountain climbing), a built-in satellite navigation system linked to live operators at GM’s OnStar communications center (they can unlock your doors by satellite remote control if you lock yourself out of the vehicle), and a 255-horsepower V-8 engine that pushes this vehicle along with the best of them.\n\nAs a lifelong off-road driving aficionado, I appreciate that GM kept the great off-road attributes of the Tahoe and Yukon in the Escalade. The only differences are the highway tires that come standard on the Escalade and a slightly softer suspension. If you want to do some serious exploring, you can put off-road tires on the Escalade, but even the stock tires will work for mild off-roading. The Escalade, like the four-wheel-drive versions of the Tahoe and Yukon, even has a low-range gearbox setting for serious hill-climbing. And unlike the Tahoe and Yukon, the Escalade is not offered in a cheaper two-wheel-drive version.\n\nOf course, I understand that most Escalade buyers won’t take their vehicles off-road, but I’m sure they will appreciate that the vehicle can handle the wilderness if they ever want to go.\n\nThe Escalade will mostly be an around-town family hauler and on-the-road travel machine, perhaps pulling a horse trailer, sailboat or camper. It can tow up to 6,000 pounds.\n\nWhat the Escalade does for Cadillac dealers is perhaps its most significant achievement. It brings baby boomers into showrooms for the first time. Cadillac hopes that some of those boomers will pass on the Escalade and buy another Cadillac product such as the Seville STS — a truly remarkable vehicle that they might never have considered if they hadn’t been drawn into the dealership by the big SUV.\n\nLincoln is finding that to be true of its Navigator. People who wouldn’t have considered visiting a Lincoln showroom before the Navigator are coming in now and driving away in other Lincolns.\n\nMy only complaint with the Escalade is the same one I have with the Tahoe and Yukon equipped with heated seats. The switch for the driver’s seat heater is on the lower left side of the seat near the seat-position controls, completely out of sight. It is easily bumped on while adjusting the seat, and within minutes, e driver begins melting away. The first time I drove a Tahoe, I accidentally turned on the seat heater and had to stop the car a few minutes later, take the owner’s manual from the glovebox, and figure out where the switch was so I could turn it off.\n\nLike the Tahoe and Yukon, the Escalade is a shortened version of the Suburban, the national car of Texas. That means that it doesn’t have room for a third seat; consumers have to choose one of its competitors to get that feature. A third seat is available in the Navigator and Land Cruiser/LX 470, as well as in the smaller but also competitive Mercedes-Benz M-class.\n\nThe Escalade seats five full-size adults in comfort, and there is 66.9 cubic feet of cargo space available behind the rear seat. Fold the rear seat down and that space expands to 118.2 cubic feet.\n\nThe 5.7-liter V-8 engine is the only power plant offered, but it is more than adequate for this vehicle. As heavy as it is — nearly 5,573 pounds — the Escalade can go from zero to 60 mph in 10.5 seconds. The transmission is a smooth-shifting four-speed automatic with overdrive.\n\nEscalade’s top speed is 110 mph, and even at highway speeds, the vehicle handles rather well. Among the standard features are speed-sensitive power steering and four-wheel antilock brakes.\n\nInside, passengers ride in the luxury and comfort they would expect from a Cadillac, even though it is a truck. The Escalade is elegant, but unlike many Cadillac cars of the past, the elegance isn’t ridiculously overdone.\n\nAll controls are within easy reach of the driver, and gauges are large and easy to read.\n\nStandard is a Bose Acoustimass music system with cassette and single compact-disc players in the dash, as well as a six-disc remote CD changer. There are four speakers in the doors, two in the headliner and a subwoofer in the console. Rear-seat passengers have their own stereo controls and headphones so they can listen privately to something different from what is being played up front.\n\nAutomatic climate control isn’t offered on the Escalade; it uses the same manual heating/air-conditioning system that comes with the Suburban, Tahoe and Yukon. There is a separate control for the rear fan, however.\n\nMost other luxury features are standard, including power windows/mirrors/door locks, automatic-dimming mirrors, high-tech theft-deterrent system, running boards for easy entry/exit, remote locking/unlocking, front and rear consoles, eight cupholders, 10-way power driver and passenger seats, leather-wrapped steering wheel and cruise control.\n\nThe Escalade comes fully loaded, so there are no options offered. Total sticker is $46,515, including transportation.\n\nEPA fuel-economy ratings are about average for this class: 13 miles per gallon in the city and 16 mpg on the highway. The tank holds 30 gallons of gasoline, and regular unleaded is recommended.\n\nTHE PACKAGE: Full-size, four-door, five-passenger, V -8 power, four-wheel-drive sport-utility wagon based on the Chevrolet Tahoe/GMC Yukon.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS: The first truck-based Cadillac product offers luxury, elegance and performance in a full-size SUV package. There is good power, comfortable seating, a roomy interior, and excellent on- and off-road performance.\n\nNEGATIVES: Front-seat heater switches are in an awkward place, out of sight on the sides of the seats.\n\nMAJOR COMPETITORS: Ford Expedition/Lincoln Navigator, Isuzu Trooper/Acura SLX, Land Rover Discovery, Range Rover, Toyota Land Cruiser/Lexus LX 470, Mercedes-Benz M-class.\n\nEPA FUEL ECONOMY: 13 miles per gallon city, 16 highway.\n\nBASE PRICE: $45,875 plus $640 transportation.\n\nPRICE AS TESTED: $46,515, including transportation.\n\nON THE ROAD RATING: A-plus.",

      "expert_review": "Full-size, luxury sport-utility vehicles: Automakers just can’t seem to make enough of ’em.\n\nLincoln, Lexus, Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Toyota, Cadillac and GMC all build one, and it’s amazing how they sell. Roughly 500,000 have been sold in the last seven years.\n\nAfter the initial impact of the Navigator, Cadillac realized it couldn’t wait any longer to jump into the SUV pool, so it grabbed a readily available life preserver, the GMC Denali, and quickly turned it into a Cadillac SUV by changing the grille and making the interior more luxurious. Introduced in 1998 as a 1999 model, the Escalade is intended to be “a bridge to the more carlike SUV already under development,” according to Cadillac.\n\nThe Escalade is all about comfort, including a ride so soft that it feels almost as plush as a Caddy sedan. To that end, the front suspension has torsion bars, while leaf springs are used in back. German Bilstein shock absorbers swallow bumps without upsetting the occupants, but handling is less confident and responsive as well.\n\nChrome, 16-inch wheels have fat tires that are as soft as fresh Krispy Kreme doughnuts, and the ride they provide is just about as sweet. They have passenger-car tread for less noise, but that makes them unsuitable for anything more rugged than gravel roads.\n\nCompared to the Denali, the Escalade’s seats are wider, softer, covered in glove-soft leather and heated both front and back. Zebrano wood trim is fitted to the dash, door panels and sections of the steering wheel.\n\nThe Escalade, and Denali, are based on the previous generation GMC Yukon. As such, it lacks the newer powertrain, bigger brakes and hydroformed frame of the 2000 Yukon. The engine is a 5.7-liter V8 with 255 horsepower and the ability to tow a 6,600-pound trailer. It is smooth and discreet, but 255 horsepower in a 5,572-pound vehicle produces only moderate acceleration. This engine is certainly adequate, but it doesn’t have the enthusiastic and endearing character of the new 5.3-liter V8 that is used in the 2000 Yukon, Tahoe and Suburban.\n\nGM’s AutoTrac four-wheel-drive system is standard. Set the dash-mounted switch to 2HI and it works like conventional rear-wheel drive. The Auto setting keeps the vehicle functioning in rear-wheel drive until the back wheels slip, at which time a viscous clutch transfers power to the front wheels.\n\n4HI splits power equally between front and rear, while 4LO is used for heavy mud, snow or off-road terrain. Few folks will ever subject an Escalade to off-roading any more serious than a dirt road, so the fact that its four-wheeling capabilities may be somewhat limited isn’t really important.\n\nThe front-disc, rear-drum brakes feel mushy and have only adequate stopping power. In a recent drive of an Escalade I was surprised at how much attention it generated. Perhaps it’s because people aren’t used to seeing the Cadillac crest on an SUV, or perhaps there’s just somethin g mystical about an SUV this size, but it drew admiring looks all over town.\n\nInside, the well-padded seats are about as cozy as living room chairs. Covered in perforated leather that is more pleasant in a wide variety of temperatures, they are superior to those in the Denali, but should be, considering the Cadillac’s price. Cadillac says there is more head, leg and shoulder room than a Navigator.\n\nTo me, the instrument panel doesn’t have the look and feel of a super-luxury SUV. There is a large, leather-covered center console that has a six-disc CD player inside. A notebook clip built into the underside of its lid is a handy touch for jotting notes. The AM/FM stereo also has a single-slot CD player in the dash.\n\nOnStar is standard equipment. This system uses a GPS locating system and a cellular network to connect with a 24-hour center that gives drivers directions, points out places to stay, tracks the vehicle in case it is stolen, unlocks the doors if you are ocked out and provides emergency medical help. In case of an airbag deployment, the vehicle automatically notifies the center so that help can be dispatched.\n\nOther safety features include anti-lock brakes and dual airbags, although side airbags are not offered.\n\nAround back, total cargo space is a generous 118.2 cubic feet with the back seat folded down. In addition to the two-piece split tailgate, a single, top-hinged door is also offered. I prefer the single unit since it does not require leaning across the open half of the tailgate to reach gear inside.\n\nConsidering that Cadillac views this generation of the Escalade as a temporary step to an SUV that is more luxurious and carlike, the next one is likely to have more power, better brakes and smooth handling.\n\nPrice\nThe base price of our test vehicle was $46,225. All equipment is standard, which means the sticker price was $46,875 including freight.\n\nWarranty\nFour years or 50,000 miles.\n\nTo get in touch with Tom Strongman call (816) 234-4349 or e-mail: strongmn@kcstar.com.\n\nPoint: The Escalade puts comfort first: in the seats, in the ride and in the level of standard equipment. The OnStar GPS system also provides peace of mind.\n\nCounterpoint: The brakes need to be stronger, the engine could use more powerand Cadillac needs more differentiation between the Escalade and the Denali. That should all come in the next generation.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\nENGINE: 5.7-liter, V8\nTRANSMISSION: automatic\nCONFIGURATION: Four-wheel drive\nWHEELBASE: 117.5 inches\nCURB WEIGHT: 5,572\nBASE PRICE: $46,225\nPRICE AS DRIVEN: $46,875\nMPG RATING: 12 city, 16 hwy.",

      "expert_review": "It was rather like walking up to a frisky horse (they always KNOW a tenderfoot when they see one). “Easy, big fella, we’re going to have fun together, and then I’m going to get you some really nice oats.”\n\nIn this case it was, “I’m going to get you the highest-octane fuel I can find.” The Cadillac Escalade nominally stands just an inch higher than I do (74.2 inches), but with its roof rack and twin protuberant antennas on the front part of the roof, it was effectively about 6-6.\n\nWith its shiny black paint and deep-tinted windows, it looked like some battle wagon the Secret Service would tool around in – or a ride for a mid-level contraband pharmaceuticals distributor.\n\nSubtle, it’s not. But what Cadillac ever was? Hasn’t the point always been (carefully inculcated through decades of advertising), “I have a Cadillac, and you don’t, you poor slob.” Lest anyone miss the message, a grille-mounted Caddy crest is echoed by one of near-pie pan size mounted, like a diamond solitaire, on the rear hatch. The tester even had chromed wheels to dazzle the plebeians.\n\nThe new Escalade was introduced last year as a 2002, parting ways with the GMC-truck-based predecessor. It is still more truck than car, with a ladder-frame unitized structure, although an independent front suspension and some tricky chassis engineering have imbued it with the kind of ride the high rollers expect from a truck.\n\nFor 2003, it picks up important enhancements: power-adjustable brake and accelerator pedals; dual-level and passenger-sensing air bag system; high-intensity-discharge headlamps; a satellite radio system; optional second-row bucket seats, a restyled instrument panel, enhanced audio system and numerous small improvements.\n\n(For those who need to make an even stronger statement than this 199-inch garage stuffer makes, there’s an extended version due out before year’s end, based on the Escalade EXT (the rich man’s version of the mutating Chevy Avalanche sedan/pickup), that will take up 221 inches of parking spot).\n\nThe 116-inch-wheelbase standard Escalade should do for most folks. With naught aboard save a half-tank of fuel, it goes 5,809 pounds in base form, which of course is anything but shabby.\n\nEquipped with the standard bench-type second seat, it nominally will carry eight people. Mini Me wouldn’t have too much problem with that fantasy, but most of us would. Go for the second-row buckets and fold or remove the third row, and you have first-class accommodations for four adults, plus 63 cubic feet of their stuff, about four large-auto trunks’ worth. If you prefer to travel as a twosome, lose the third row, drop the second row seats and see how long it takes you to fill 108 c.f.\n\nGM’s thought is that many buyers will be interested in using Escalade as a prime mover for a boat or horse trailer. It’s rated at 7,300 pounds of drayage with the rear-drive setup, or 7,800 with all-wheel drive. If that doesn’t s uffice, better go check some dualies at the GMC store or look for “hauling services” in the Yellow Pages.\n\nThere’s a $3,400 difference between the 2WD and 4WD versions of Escalade, but the AWD version gets an upsized engine, too, a fire-breathing 6-liter.\n\nIt may be “old tech,” with its iron block and overhead-valve construction, but you can’t beat cubes for torque – here, 380 foot-pounds at 4,000 rpm, and a bunch below that. Less relevant but more advertisable is the horsepower figure: 345 at 5,200 rpm. Burdened only with me, this baby scoots – 0-60 in 8.4 seconds would be good for a sedan. In a leviathan like this, it’s impressive.\n\nTo realize those numbers, you’ll need to buy premium fuel, although GM says it will be content with regular. It would be worth trying 87-octane for non-stressful activities. EPA estimates are 12 mpg city, 16 highway. You’d be crazy to take this machine very far off-road, so I confined my four-wheeling to a muddy lot. Mostly, though, cruised highway and byway, and somehow wound up with a mileage figure of 17.2 (using premium). Perhaps it’s because in such running the throttle doesn’t need much cracking.\n\nThe tester, like all Escalades, had traction control, a road-sensing suspension and StabiliTrak. This lattermost is the increasingly-familiar electronic overseer which works to keep a driver’s excessive cornering demands in check by selectively applying a brake or brakes and/or cutting power if desire exceeds ability.\n\nIt can be turned off, but this is no sports car, and I found it not at all obtrusive, but then, I had taken my meds that day and didn’t try to powerslide and hang the rear end out. I did, however, seek out the same stretch of road on which the previous-generation Escalade had given me a major dose of religion. This one did far better, although it was still slave to the laws of inertia. That adjustable suspension (effected with variable shock valving) made for a very comfortable ride, even over moderately disgraceful pavement.\n\nThe real test came when the heavens opened and gave us a serious deluge. Adventuring on capricious Hoosier roads, I felt the only limitation was how well I could see the road ahead. The Escalade was rock-solid upon its 265/70/17 all-season Goodyear’s. In this weight range, 18s or even 19s would not be out of place, but they’re not offered yet.\n\nThe Escalade would spoil most anybody’s day in a crash, and that surprisingly might include its own driver. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration crashed a 2002 into a fixed barrier at 30 mph. The supposititious co-pilot made out pretty well, with a four-star protection rating on the feds’ 5-star scale. The driver, however, only had 3-star protection and there was even a special note that there was a high probability of a thigh injury. Side-impact tests were not performed, and the calculated rollover resistance was average for SUVs, three stars. Unfortunately, the Insurance Institute has not tested any large SUVs. It would be interesting to see how the dreadnoughts handle a 40-mph frontal offset test, and how their bumpers fare.\n\nThis year the big guy gets four-wheel disc brakes with antilock and they were of suitable size, rendering surprisingly short stopping distances along with good pedal feel. The Escalade’s running board step-up was deadly in the wet – slippery despite its textured look. A passenger noted that the assist grip was misplaced, on the A pillar instead of farther back and higher.\n\nThis was my first experience with the new satellite radio and it was impressive, if you like that sort of thing. A hundred channels are beamed down to anywhere in the 48, and you can even dial in a musical preference. Sound quality, through the awesome upgraded Bose system, was excellent – clear as a CD, but of course vanishing in tunnels. That radio receiver is an extra, but GM’s OnStar satellite-directed system is standard.\n\nAlso included, commendably, is a rear sonar system which alerts the driver via a chime and interior lights when she is getting close to a barrier OR when someone is behind the vehicle. A little someone would be impossible to see, given the size of the rear window and its distance from the driver’s eye.\n\nGM offers the Escalade as an alternative to the Lincoln Navigator, Lexus LX 470 and Mercedes-Benz M-class machines. They are different enough that a potential buyer would be well-advised to check the specs and spend some pleasant seat time comparing them. Escalade certainly is a contender, very nicely finished and the most potent of the bunch.\n\nBase price on the big E is $53,205. Tester had rear-seat DVD and wireless headphones for $1,295; chromed wheels, $795; XM satellite radio, $325, and trailer package, $169. Heated bucket seats were provided at no charge for second class in place of a bench. Total price, with freight, was $56,559. Edmunds.com says on average, buyers are wangling about $3,500 discounts. At manufacturer’s suggested, payments on the tester would be $1,147 a month, assuming 20 percent down, 10 percent interest and 48 coupons.",

      "expert_review": "The very idea seems ludicrous: a pair of large, high-end pickup trucks from America’s most prestigious luxury brands.\n\nWhat weird confluence of wealth-driven market forces brought about the existence of the Cadillac Escalade EXT and the Lincoln Blackwood? What fickle powers of mass appeal made one a raging success and the other an obscure oddball?\n\nRecently, both Escalade and Blackwood took turns casting big shadows in my driveway. The similarities were striking but so were the differences.\n\nAs a pickup truck, the Cadillac is the more practical by a long shot. Derived from the ungainly but successful Chevrolet Avalanche, Escalade EXT is a four-door, crew-cab truck that shares the innovative ability of folding its rear seat and expanding its short pickup bed into a full 8-foot bed.\n\nThis is an excellent feature, which has helped sell many thousands of $35,000 Avalanches and a significant number of $50,000 EXTs. It works as a passenger truck, an all-wheel-drive utility truck and a full-size pickup.\n\nOn the test truck, there was a segmented bed cover that made the bed more usable, and a heavy rubber liner that made the bed more durable. But the bed cover was heavy and cumbersome to remove.\n\nBlackwood, on the other hand, has the world’s strangest and least-practical pickup bed. Sure, there’s a motorized cover that raises majestically at the push of a remote control, but the cover is not removable, which limits cargo capacity.\n\nThe bed is beautifully carpeted, lined with stainless steel, and lit around its edges by glowing LED lighting. It looks like a cross between a vampire coffin and a disco floor. Obviously, nothing that’s the least bit dingy or rough-edged could ever be carried within. Maybe it’s really the world’s biggest jewel box.\n\nBlackwood is also a $50,000-plus land yacht. But although this expensive bauble lacks any functionality as a pickup, I found it to be strangely appealing and oddly likable. I preferred its road feel and handling over the Escalade’s, and its styling is more sleek and classy.\n\nEXT’s popularity goes beyond such mundane concerns as practicality or versatility. Like its sport utility sibling, the non-EXT Escalade, this pickup has picked up a heavy aura of pop culture cool. Here’s a street machine with enough gaudy flash to earn the praise of rappers, professional athletes and other purveyors of urban chic.\n\nFor me, a bona fide midlifer who relates the name Cadillac with a past generation, it’s startling to see young people all psyched about a Caddy. A sport utility and a pickup, no less.\n\nThe folks at Cadillac must be tickled pink (at least that’s a color I relate to Cadillac) that they scored a major inroad with youth, after fretting all these years that its geriatric constituency was dying off.\n\nNo such luck for Blackwood. This crew-cab variation on the popular Navigator has failed to strike a chord among either hip urbanites or suburban yuppies. Sales are slack, even less than Ford’s limited production goal.\n\nNaturally, both trucks were optioned up to their gunwales with luxury features, including leather and wood interiors, communications systems, and lots of bins and cubby holes. In the EXT, I was appalled by the poor design of bin covers that, when opening, created a gap that allowed items to fall into the bowels of the console.\n\nBoth test trucks were glossy black, the EXT accented with lots of gleaming chrome highlights and the Blackwood distinctively decorated with horizontal aluminum stripes around its low pickup bed. In the concept-truck version of Blackwood, the bed was trimmed with black wood. Thus the name. This pricey affectation was switched to faux wood grain for production.\n\nEscalade EXT is powered by a booming 6-liter Vortec V-8 that pounds out 345 horsepower and 380 pound-feet of torque, enough to accelerate this heavyweight with some real muscle, or tow that boat out to the lake with ease. EXT also benefited from General Motors’ Stabilitrac stability system, road-sensing suspension and a self-leveling system to compensate for heavy loads.\n\nBlackwood’s V-8 hits 300 horsepower and 355 pound-feet, also a formidable powerhouse. Unlike the all-wheel-drive EXT, Blackwood comes only in two-wheel drive.\n\nBlackwood is a more gentrified craft, and it would look pretty towing a trailer filled with show horses. Just don’t stash any messy hay bales in the truck bed.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in August 2006 about the 2007 Cadillac Escalade. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what details are different this year, check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nAfter a week in the all-new Cadillac Escalade I have now reviewed each of GM’s full-size SUVs, including the Chevy Tahoe and GMC Yukon. The Escalade is the top fish in the pond, complete with a more powerful V-8 engine, high-end leather appointments and plenty of flashy chrome.\n\nIt’s too bad the Escalade has such an established reputation as a show-off vehicle, because I found the look of my dark blue test vehicle extremely elegant. It’s as utilitarian as its less expensive siblings, but it adds what the others can’t: style.\n\nFor such a large SUV, the Escalade — like the Yukon and Tahoe — is easy to drive, but unlike the slightly less powerful Yukon Denali it packed plenty of punch. Its spirited launches, though, are taken in from the extreme comfort of heated and cooled front leather seats, making the Escalade a fine place to be. The problem only comes when you check the sticker price and realize there are a lot of fine luxury SUVs on the market that offer as much or more for the money. Our all-wheel-drive tester started at $56,405; after almost all of the available options were tacked on, we were north of $65,000.\n\nExterior & Styling\nWhen I saw the first press images of the all-new Escalade, I was aghast. The new front grille seemed way too extravagant for what is essentially an all-American SUV. Then I saw it in black-metallic painted flesh at the Detroit auto show and realized that this would be a big seller. I’ve only seen black Escalades on the streets, and I was delighted to receive the dark blue test vehicle. How do you tone down all the chrome? Get a subtle color like this blue. Overall I’m a bigger fan of the traditional look of the Range Rover, but it’s easy to see why people are attracted to this Escalade.\n\nThe front is overwhelmed by the multi-faceted chrome grille, so much so that you barely notice the huge headlights. In back, vertical LED taillights add a high-end touch and — if you think about it — tie this un-car-like SUV right into the rest of Cadillac’s lineup. Large chrome wheels finish off the package, and while I would opt for something more practical, they weren’t at all gaudy. Even as someone well outside any of the target markets for the Escalade — I’m neither hip nor old enough to be a former Cadillac owner — I felt comfortable being seen behind the wheel.\n\nThe Inside\nIf I had to drive forever in the Escalade’s optional heated and cooled seats, I don’t think I could complain. Why every luxury car doesn’t come with ventilation is a mystery. On a hot hour-long ride home from a weekend getaway the cooling seat meant I didn’t have to blast the other occupants with cold A/C while I sat in the sun.\n\nThe thick, padded armrest and storage bin were nice, but I prefer the handy cell phone indentation the Yukon and Tahoe have in their centers, compared to the Escalade’s ornamental wood strip. It’s a little thing, but I thought that was a nifty use of space.\n\nAlong with others in the office I’m a bit perplexed as to why Cadillac chose to stray from the standard center stack controls that the Yukon and Tahoe have and instead use the slightly more outdated Cadillac ones also seen in the STS sedan. They’re adequate, but the environmental controls are much more confusing and forced my eyes from the road too often.\n\nThe sound system and center LCD screen were above par and almost identical to the Yukon Denali’s in terms of quality. Unlike a bad road trip in the Denali, though, the Escalade’s navigation did not get us lost (even returning to the same exact home address). On the weekend trip to a nearby resort town, my wife and I were accompanied by her parents. My wife and mother-in-law sat in the second-row captain’s chairs and enjoyed the chauffeured life the Escalade provides. My wife even popped a romantic comedy — I’m generally not a fan of the genre — into the DVD player. With the remote in hand and wireless headphones in place, we didn’t hear from her the rest of the trip. Now I know why parents love these things.\n\nRide & Handling\nI hate to keep referencing other vehicles in a review of the Escalade, but the Cadillac retains all the same favorable handling traits of the Yukon and Tahoe. None of these models feel bloated, and they all refute the stereotype of full-size SUVs being hard to navigate around town. Unlike the Yukon’s somewhat rough ride, the Escalade was much smoother on the highway and winding country roads. Road noise was minimal, as was wind noise — a surprise given the vehicle’s many sharp exterior surfaces.\n\nGoing & Stopping\nAgain with the comparison, but the Escalade and Yukon Denali I tested have the exact same 6.2-liter V-8, yet they felt worlds apart. Sure, the Escalade is tuned to turn out 403 horsepower versus the Denali’s 383 hp, but at that end of the spectrum — and in this large of a vehicle — it shouldn’t have made such a big difference. The Escalade and its six-speed transmission felt powerful, where the Denali was often straining to get to speed. And this was with four passengers and luggage, and with the A/C on constantly.\n\nBraking in the Escalade offered the same tried and true delivery, but was kicked up a notch. Whether GM just made the Escalade slightly better or is holding the Yukon Denali back I don’t know, but if you can afford the roughly $10,000 difference there’s no question which vehicle provides the better experience for drivers.\n\nSafety\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gave the 2007 Escalade a five-star frontal crash-test rating; it hadn’t done a side-impact test as of this writing. Rollover ratings were listed at three stars, which means in a single-vehicle crash the Escalade has a 22 – 24 percent chance of rolling over. That’s about average for SUVs of this class. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has not yet rated the Escalade or any other new full-size SUV.\n\nThe Escalade comes with plenty of safety features, including stability control, rollover mitigation, antilock brakes and side curtain airbags for all three rows of seats.\n\nCargo & Towing\nJust like the Yukon, the Escalade’s cargo configuration is less than optimal, but for four passengers on a weekend trip it was great. Three overnight bags, two golf bags and a garment bag on top all fit in the rear cargo area after the third row had been folded in half then swung forward. Unfortunately none of the passenger seats fold flat, so this system has to do unless you remove the seats entirely. The huge center aisle between the second row seats held our snacks and cooler, and everyone had ample legroom. Headroom wasn’t even a consideration. Given how tall the Escalade is, getting in and out could have been easier for everyone on the trip, myself included.\n\nFor four people, the Escalade is always going to be easy to live with; even for three couples the rear row is adequate. Thus you’ll have a Cadillac shuttle to use to go out to a very nice dinner all in one vehicle. The money you save at the valet, of course, will go right back into the gas tank.\n\nWhile the Escalade’s sticker says it gets 13/19 mpg in city/highway driving, I observed a 13 mpg average over the course of about 300 miles of mixed highway and suburban driving in summer weather bordering the 90s. And as I mentioned before, for about 120 of those miles we had a full load of people and cargo. The air conditioning was used liberally the entire time, along with those cooling seats. In better conditions I’d expect the Escalade to provide better mileage in the middle of its advertised range.\n\nTowing is rated at 7,700 pounds, about 200 pounds less than the Yukon Denali and about equal with the Range Rover Sport.\n\nEscalade in the Market\nGM has managed to build the best Escalade to date, but I’m still torn as to where it rates in the still-growing luxury SUV segment. If you have this kind of money and want to be seen in a fancy SUV with power, I would think the Range Rover Sport — especially the supercharged version — would be more desirable at a similar price. I certainly prefer it. Of course the difference there would simply be about who wants to be seen in which vehicle. And those are the intangibles we’ll never be able to gauge.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "Why the Bad Rap?\n2004 Cadillac Escalade\n\nLet’s accept difference — me from you, you from me, us from them, them from we.\n\nLet’s understand that what you like, others abhor. You want two-wheel drive. Others want four.\n\nLet’s leave one another alone.\n\nYou drive away in a small-car parade. I’ll take the Cadillac Escalade. It’s huge, yes, with a wide-mouth grille. Its 6-literV-8 roars and sends a chill — almost as scary as its gasoline bill.\n\nDriving the 2004 Escalade from city to city, 2,000 miles, almost emptied my kitty. The gas bill tallied 240 U.S. dollars, a tab that made me scream and holler. You don’t have to be a scholar to know that’s a crazy way to spend a dollar.\n\nBut, hey, the cash was mine, and if I wanted to drive something as big and fine as the Escalade with its leather seats and very thick carpeting beneath my feet, with standard XM Satellite Radio and rear-seat DVD, why did you frown and scowl at me?\n\nDo I tell you where to live, how to dress? Do I put you under duress for the thousands you spend on earthly things, such as neckwear bling-bling and diamond rings?\n\nWhat about the millions you take in campaign donations to take power for you, but from the rest of the nation? You waste gas flying from city to city making promises to empty the public’s kitty.\n\nLet’s leave one another alone.\n\nThe Escalade isn’t for everyone. But those who love it say it’s fun. I saw them on the road in various rest-area parking lots. Some had the smaller, more fuel-economical Vortec 5300, 5.3-liter, 285-horsepower V-8; others drove what I drove, the Vortec High-Output, 345-horsepower V-8 with liters six.\n\nBut all of them said they got their kicks from the Escalade’s power and ride, the latter of which is a mix of truck and sedan, which is General Motors Corp.’s plan to make truck-based vehicles palatable for the common man — and woman.\n\nSurely, by now, most of you know the Escalade is the GMC Yukon and Chevrolet Tahoe. In its 1999 birth year, the Escalade and siblings shared more than a gear. Changed badges and plastic pieces did not hold critics at bay, but the public bought the Escalade anyway. The evidence can be found with the GM bank teller who has been raking in cash on a bona fide bestseller.\n\nNow with bold, new styling and a bank of standard equipment, the Escalade looks and feels really different. People now know it on sight, like the young brother at a New Jersey rest stop the other night: “Hey, man, that’s the new Escalade!” Yeah, man, you’re right.\n\nThe new Escalade is much easier to control. It has standard StabiliTrak to help prevent a roll. It comes with four-wheel anti-lock disc brakes and two side air bags, too — one for the driver and front-seat passenger, assuming that passenger is you.\n\nThe Escalade’s high-intensity-discharge headlamps burn blue- white bright. They help enhance the driver’s sight. But if you’re coming toward the Escalade in the dead of the night, those lamps startle, give you a fright. GM and other car companies should do more to get this right.\n\nWhat else can I say? How better to explain why different things appeal to different women and men? Their preferences make them no better than you, no worse than me. You can’t ask a man “What would Jesus drive?” if his name is Muhammad Ali. They’re just doing what they have a right to do in the Land of the Free.\n\nLet’s leave one another alone.\n\nNuts & Bolts\n\nComplaints: I expected poor gas mileage and got it, an average 15 miles per gallon. Also, the Escalade’s high-intensity-discharge lights bother drivers coming toward the vehicle and they irritate those driving immediately in front of it. GM needs to rethink this.\n\nPraise: An absolutely wonderful ride, exceedingly comfortable. Credit here goes to GM’s compute -controlled Road Sensing Suspension System (RSS), which delivers an excellent compromise between truck and sedan ride — even over bad roads.\n\nHead-turning quotient: “Hey, man, that’s the new Escalade!” The people who love it love it and the people who hate it hate it. It’s America.\n\nAcceleration and handling: Excellent on both counts. If the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration wants to implement rollover protection rules for sport-utility vehicles, it had better hurry up. GM has its StabiliTrak System. Volvo now employs an anti-roll system developed by Autoliv. Wagner Engineering has developed its patented Link-X Stability System. They all work well. If the technology has moved ahead of NHTSA’s regulatory efforts, what does NHTSA have to regulate?\n\nVehicle design and layout: The Escalade is a truck-based, body-on-frame sport-utility vehicle with four side doors and a hatchback. It has a front-mounted engine. It is available with two-wheel or all-wheel drive.\n\nCapacities: The Escalade can seat up to seven people. Fuel capacity is 26 gallons; regular unleaded gasoline is recommended. Depending on equipment chosen, the Escalade can tow up to 8,100 pounds and carry a payload up to 1,433 pounds.\n\nPrice: Base price on the tested 6-liter Escalade AWD is $54,880. Dealer invoice price on that model is $50,215. Price as tested is $55,695, including $815 in transportation charges.\n\nPurse-strings note: The Escalade is a bestseller, but it has lots of competition. You can bargain. Compare with GMC Yukon, Chevrolet Tahoe, Ford Expedition, Lincoln Navigator, Volvo XC 90, Lexus LX 470, Land Rover Range Rover.",

      "expert_review": "After a week in the all-new Cadillac Escalade I have now reviewed each of GM’s full-size SUVs, including the Chevy Tahoe and GMC Yukon. The Escalade is the top fish in the pond, complete with a more powerful V-8 engine, high-end leather appointments and plenty of flashy chrome.\n\nIt’s too bad the Escalade has such an established reputation as a show-off vehicle, because I found the look of my dark blue test vehicle extremely elegant. It’s as utilitarian as its less expensive siblings, but it adds what the others can’t: style.\n\nFor such a large SUV, the Escalade — like the Yukon and Tahoe — is easy to drive, but unlike the slightly less powerful Yukon Denali it packed plenty of punch. Its spirited launches, though, are taken in from the extreme comfort of heated and cooled front leather seats, making the Escalade a fine place to be. The problem only comes when you check the sticker price and realize there are a lot of fine luxury SUVs on the market that offer as much or more for the money. Our all-wheel-drive tester started at $56,405; after almost all of the available options were tacked on, we were north of $65,000.\n\nExterior & Styling\nWhen I saw the first press images of the all-new Escalade, I was aghast. The new front grille seemed way too extravagant for what is essentially an all-American SUV. Then I saw it in black-metallic painted flesh at the Detroit auto show and realized that this would be a big seller. I’ve only seen black Escalades on the streets, and I was delighted to receive the dark blue test vehicle. How do you tone down all the chrome? Get a subtle color like this blue. Overall I’m a bigger fan of the traditional look of the Range Rover, but it’s easy to see why people are attracted to this Escalade.\n\nThe front is overwhelmed by the multi-faceted chrome grille, so much so that you barely notice the huge headlights. In back, vertical LED taillights add a high-end touch and — if you think about it — tie this un-car-like SUV right into the rest of Cadillac’s lineup. Large chrome wheels finish off the package, and while I would opt for something more practical, they weren’t at all gaudy. Even as someone well outside any of the target markets for the Escalade — I’m neither hip nor old enough to be a former Cadillac owner — I felt comfortable being seen behind the wheel.\n\nThe Inside\nIf I had to drive forever in the Escalade’s optional heated and cooled seats, I don’t think I could complain. Why every luxury car doesn’t come with ventilation is a mystery. On a hot hour-long ride home from a weekend getaway the cooling seat meant I didn’t have to blast the other occupants with cold A/C while I sat in the sun.\n\nThe thick, padded armrest and storage bin were nice, but I prefer the handy cell phone indentation the Yukon and Tahoe have in their centers, compared to the Escalade’s ornamental wood strip. It’s a little thing, but I thought that was a nifty use of space.\n\nAlong with others in the office I’m a bit perplexed as to why Cadillac chose to stray from the standard center stack controls that the Yukon and Tahoe have and instead use the slightly more outdated Cadillac ones also seen in the STS sedan. They’re adequate, but the environmental controls are much more confusing and forced my eyes from the road too often.\n\nThe sound system and center LCD screen were above par and almost identical to the Yukon Denali’s in terms of quality. Unlike a bad road trip in the Denali, though, the Escalade’s navigation did not get us lost (even returning to the same exact home address). On the weekend trip to a nearby resort town, my wife and I were accompanied by her parents. My wife and mother-in-law sat in the second-row captain’s chairs and enjoyed the chauffeured life the Escalade provides. My wife even popped a romantic comedy — I’m generally not a fan of the genre — into the DVD player. With the remote in hand and wireless headphones in place, we didn’t hear from her the rest of the trip. Now I know why parents love these things.\n\nRide & Handling\nI hate to keep referencing other vehicles in a review of the Escalade, but the Cadillac retains all the same favorable handling traits of the Yukon and Tahoe. None of these models feel bloated, and they all refute the stereotype of full-size SUVs being hard to navigate around town. Unlike the Yukon’s somewhat rough ride, the Escalade was much smoother on the highway and winding country roads. Road noise was minimal, as was wind noise — a surprise given the vehicle’s many sharp exterior surfaces.\n\nGoing & Stopping\nAgain with the comparison, but the Escalade and Yukon Denali I tested have the exact same 6.2-liter V-8, yet they felt worlds apart. Sure, the Escalade is tuned to turn out 403 horsepower versus the Denali’s 383 hp, but at that end of the spectrum — and in this large of a vehicle — it shouldn’t have made such a big difference. The Escalade and its six-speed transmission felt powerful, where the Denali was often straining to get to speed. And this was with four passengers and luggage, and with the A/C on constantly.\n\nBraking in the Escalade offered the same tried and true delivery, but was kicked up a notch. Whether GM just made the Escalade slightly better or is holding the Yukon Denali back I don’t know, but if you can afford the roughly $10,000 difference there’s no question which vehicle provides the better experience for drivers.\n\nSafety\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gave the 2007 Escalade a five-star frontal crash-test rating; it hadn’t done a side-impact test as of this writing. Rollover ratings were listed at three stars, which means in a single-vehicle crash the Escalade has a 22 – 24 percent chance of rolling over. That’s about average for SUVs of this class. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has not yet rated the Escalade or any other new full-size SUV.\n\nThe Escalade comes with plenty of safety features, including stability control, rollover mitigation, antilock brakes and side curtain airbags for all three rows of seats.\n\nCargo & Towing\nJust like the Yukon, the Escalade’s cargo configuration is less than optimal, but for four passengers on a weekend trip it was great. Three overnight bags, two golf bags and a garment bag on top all fit in the rear cargo area after the third row had been folded in half then swung forward. Unfortunately none of the passenger seats fold flat, so this system has to do unless you remove the seats entirely. The huge center aisle between the second row seats held our snacks and cooler, and everyone had ample legroom. Headroom wasn’t even a consideration. Given how tall the Escalade is, getting in and out could have been easier for everyone on the trip, myself included.\n\nFor four people, the Escalade is always going to be easy to live with; even for three couples the rear row is adequate. Thus you’ll have a Cadillac shuttle to use to go out to a very nice dinner all in one vehicle. The money you save at the valet, of course, will go right back into the gas tank.\n\nWhile the Escalade’s sticker says it gets 13/19 mpg in city/highway driving, I observed a 13 mpg average over the course of about 300 miles of mixed highway and suburban driving in summer weather bordering the 90s. And as I mentioned before, for about 120 of those miles we had a full load of people and cargo. The air conditioning was used liberally the entire time, along with those cooling seats. In better conditions I’d expect the Escalade to provide better mileage in the middle of its advertised range.\n\nTowing is rated at 7,700 pounds, about 200 pounds less than the Yukon Denali and about equal with the Range Rover Sport.\n\nEscalade in the Market\nGM has managed to build the best Escalade to date, but I’m still torn as to where it rates in the still-growing luxury SUV segment. If you have this kind of money and want to be seen in a fancy SUV with power, I would think the Range Rover Sport — especially the supercharged version — would be more desirable at a similar price. I certainly prefer it. Of course the difference there would simply be about who wants to be seen in which vehicle. And those are the intangibles we’ll never be able to gauge.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "The biggest, baddest American luxury vehicle is undisputedly the Cadillac Escalade, a blingy behemoth that prowls the streets of the United States in all its chrome-grille glory, rumbling and roaring its anti-environmental presence. While foreign automakers maintain flagship sedans, like the Mercedes-Benz S-Class and Lexus LS 460, the American love for trucks has elevated rigs like the Escalade to that position here.\n\nIt had been a while since we last experienced Cadillac’s range-topper, so we spent a week with the latest example, a 2017 Cadillac Escalade four-wheel-drive Platinum. We drove a short-wheelbase version that tickled the $100,000 MSRP mark and lacked nothing on the model’s options list except the extra length of the Escalade ESV (see the changes from 2016 to 2017 here).\n\nExterior and Styling\n\nDespite sharing a basic structure with the more plebian (and less expensive) Chevrolet Tahoe and GMC Yukon, the Cadillac Escalade looks nothing like those trucks. Cadillac has done an admirable job of differentiating the Escalade from its brethren, adding distinctive Cadillac cues like blade-style vertical headlights and tall LED tailfins — er, taillights.\n\nThe Escalade’s garish chrome grille is the only blemish on an otherwise smooth-sided, slick and modern design. Integrated side steps that fold out when the doors open add another level of design sophistication, allowing for the function of running boards without the design interruption of fixed boards. Despite some of its more outlandish design elements, this Cadillac Escalade is still a more subdued and sophisticated design than previous models; it doesn’t look out of place when parked among Land Rover Range Rovers and Mercedes-Benz GLS-Class SUVs in the country club parking lot.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nYou’d expect a vehicle this size to feel massive and ponderous, heavy in its body motions and hesitant to change direction, accelerate or brake. And that’s pretty much what you get with the Escalade. There’s no disguising the fact that it’s truly a huge truck, powerful though it may be.\n\nStill built on a stout, steel body-on-frame truck design, the Cadillac Escalade hasn’t gone through any of General Motors’ latest weight-reduction efforts. The Escalade does feature GM’s Magnetic Ride Control, an adjustable suspension that reads the road and adapts shock absorber firmness in lightning-fast time, which helps in controlling squat, dive, roll and other body motions.\n\nIt doesn’t help steering and handling much, as the Escalade’s heft makes it a better cruiser than dancer. It also doesn’t make for a very quiet or supple ride, as there’s only so much you can do to damp 22-inch wheels shod with super-low-profile tires. The smaller 20-inch wheels with taller sidewalls on lesser trims would likely make the Escalade’s ride more luxurious.\n\nThanks to its burly 6.2-liter V-8 engine, the Escalade feels decently quick for a truck of its size. (Cadillac reports its zero-to-60-mph time at a tick less than 6 seconds.) It fires to life with a surprising roar that’s especially loud from outside the vehicle, which you’ll hear if you’re using the remote start. You’d swear the Escalade has an aftermarket exhaust system, so loud and rumbly is its engine, but it comes that loud from the factory.\n\nThe big engine makes 420 horsepower and is mated to a standard eight-speed automatic transmission. My test vehicle came with selectable four-wheel drive, but rear-wheel drive is standard. One benefit of this truck-based setup is the ability to tow 8,300 pounds (8,100 on the longer Escalade ESV), meaning the Cadillac Escalade could pull a good-sized camper trailer or personal watercraft (or two).\n\nFuel economy on this monster is better than you might expect thanks to technology like cylinder deactivation. The EPA rates the four-wheel-drive Escalade at 15/20/17 mpg city/highway/combined, and my week in one netted an observed fuel economy of 18 mpg combined. Not exactly hybrid territory, but for a vehicle this size, it’s acceptable.\n\nCompetitors aren’t much different, with the V-8 powered Mercedes-Benz GLS550 coming in at 14/18/16 mpg, almost matching the performance of the V-8 Land Rover Range Rover, which is rated 14/19/16 mpg. They’re all better than the dismal performance of the Infiniti QX80, however, which is rated 13/19/15 mpg.\n\nInterior\n\nOpen the door to the Cadillac Escalade Platinum’s completely leather-wrapped interior and an automati,c integrated side step folds out of the lower sills to aid you in climbing up. Presumably, this is because the Escalade doesn’t offer an adjustable air suspension to raise and lower the vehicle, as many of its competitors do. Once situated in the cabin, you’ll realize a great effort has been made to make the Escalade feel special and upscale — an effort that doesn’t quite succeed.\n\nThe truck doesn’t feel terribly spacious for something so massive on the outside. The wide center console eats into passenger hip room, and the driving position is awkward; the steering wheel isn’t centered on the driver, a trait common to GM’s full-size trucks that needs to be corrected. Front occupants have plenty of leg and headroom, but second-row passengers may be surprised to find legroom isn’t as plentiful as they might expect in a vehicle this big. Third-row passengers have it even worse, with a seat that will make them feel almost as if they’re sitting on the floor.\n\nMaterial quality is also mixed, as is assembly quality. The surfaces covered in leather feel quite nice, but all the black plastic control surfaces feel cheap. The steering wheel in particular has controls that don’t feel like they belong in a flagship vehicle costing just shy of $100,000, as our test vehicle did. Drop into a Mercedes-Benz GLS or Range Rover and you’ll see what a $100,000 premium luxury interior looks and feels like. Sit in the Escalade’s mishmash of nice cowhides and cheap black plastic, and you’re likely to be disappointed.\n\nElectronics and Ergonomics\n\nThe Cadillac User Experience multimedia system is front and center in the Cadillac Escalade. It’s a more advanced version of the Chevrolet MyLink and Buick/GMC IntelliLink systems. It has a more upscale look to it, and it definitely functions better than it used to, with speedy actions and reliable voice recognition. The touchscreen itself provides haptic feedback when making selections; there’s a barely detectable “thump” when you touch an icon. CUE is better than any system from Lexus or Infiniti in its sophistication, ease of operation and speed, but the Mercedes-Benz system looks classier and works equally well.\n\nFor backseat passengers, there’s not one but two rear entertainment systems. One has a screen that comes down from the ceiling, and the other’s screens are in the backs of the front-seat head restraints. There’s no excuse for second- and third-row passengers to be bored in an Escalade.\n\nCargo & Storage\n\nThe Cadillac Escalade comes in two sizes: regular and ESV. They basically correspond to the lengths of the Chevrolet Tahoe (regular) and longer Suburban (ESV). That extended length comes in both the wheelbase and the rear cargo compartment.\n\nI drove a standard-length Escalade featuring 15.2 cubic feet of cargo room behind the third row and 51.6 cubic feet with the third row stowed. It should be noted, however, that the third row doesn’t exactly fold into the floor in the Escalade. The SUV features a raised rear floor so it appears flush, but unlike the Lincoln Navigator with its independent rear suspension, the Escalade uses a solid rear axle, necessitating a higher cargo floor. Fold the second and third rows and you’ll get a maximum of 94.2 cubic feet of cargo space in the standard Cadillac Escalade. That compares to the Mercedes-Benz GLS and is far more than the Range Rover. It’s a little short of the volume you get in a standard Navigator.\n\nSafety\n\nThe 2017 Cadillac Escalade has not been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, but it has been tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. NHTSA awarded it a four-star rating overall out of five, but only a three-star rollover rating.\n\nThe new Cadillac Escalade features forward and rear automatic emergency braking, which can prevent you from hitting the car in front of you or backing over something in the driveway. New for 2017 is an automatic parallel and perpendicular parking feature, but the really novel new item is the Rear Camera Mirror that has made its way to the Escalade. At the flip of a toggle under the rearview mirror — one that, in most cars, would switch between the normal and darkened mirror for nighttime driving — the mirror instead becomes a high-definition display that uses the rear-mounted camera to show the view behind the vehicle, as if the backseat and rear pillars of the truck weren’t there.\n\nThe camera offers a wider-angle view than the typical mirror, so it definitely takes some getting used to — mostly because it requires you to refocus your eyes. When you’re driving along with a conventional mirror, you’re already looking and focused well ahead of the vehicle. When looking at your rearview mirror, you’re also looking well behind the vehicle — your eyes are focused on a point well off in the distance.\n\nBut if you switch the mirror to the camera display, that same focus isn’t going to work because you’ll no longer be looking at a reflection, but rather a video. It’s as if you had switched your gaze to the radio or speedometer, and while drivers are used to refocusing like that, they’re not used to it when looking at the rearview mirror. Retraining myself to consciously refocus my eyes for the mirror’s camera view took all week. I still wasn’t entirely comfortable doing it by the end of the test, but I was at least more used to it.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nThis is where I have a hard time swallowing what Cadillac is selling. The price for a standard-length, rear-wheel-drive, base Escalade is $74,590. From there, you can go up to Luxury, Premium Luxury and Platinum trims. My Platinum model started at $96,390 for a 4×4 version, then added special Red Passion paint, a chrome exhaust tip and wheel locks for an as-tested price of $97,100. If you opt for the longer ESV and equip it like my test vehicle, the sticker tops $102,000 — frankly, an outrageous price for what is essentially a somewhat nicer Chevrolet Suburban.\n\nLuxury competitors in this price class are not hard to find. The one that matches up best with the standard Cadillac Escalade is the Mercedes-Benz GLS, which comes in only one size but with multiple powertrain options. It doesn’t appear as big on the outside but offers comparable interior space to the standard Escalade and only slightly less towing capacity. The Infiniti QX80 is less expensive than the Escalade but is meant to compete in the same realm. It’s not as powerful as the Cadillac but feels comparably luxurious.\n\nThe Land Rover Range Rover isn’t as big as the Cadillac Escalade but is much more luxurious, and like the Mercedes-Benz, it’s available with several powertrain options. The Lincoln Navigator used to be a direct competitor to the Escalade, but the Cadillac’s past redesign pushed the Escalade well out in front of the Lincoln in terms of luxury, amenities, style and power. The Navigator features a much less powerful twin-turbo V-6 as its only engine option, and until a new Navigator arrives in the next year or two, its size is the only aspect that competes favorably with the Escalade.

      "expert_review": "It’s easy to consider the Cadillac Escalade a superstar because of its flash and reputation, but after my experience in the 2011 Cadillac Escalade ESV, I’m convinced it’s more like a diva. This SUV is ginormous, and I was interested to see how it really worked as an everyday family hauler. However, the Escalade ESV didn’t really care what I thought. It was going to do whatever it wanted.\n\nThe 2011 Cadillac Escalade ESV hits the high notes like singer Katy Perry — it gets there but works awfully hard to do so.\n\nThe three-row Escalade ESV, which is 20 inches longer than the Escalade, drove like a mansion on wheels and felt like one when we were in it. With its V-8 engine, driving on the highway was awesome as long as the road was mostly straight. Parking lots were difficult and I couldn’t imagine running errands in the Escalade ESV without parking far away from the other cars so I wouldn’t worry about the Escalade ESV’s butt hanging out of the spot.\n\nThis SUV lacked some significant (and expected) family-friendly features, too. The Escalade ESV was interested in pampering me, but it had to be done its way or not at all. Some might argue that’s not really pampering then.\n\nWith a starting MSRP of $66,080, the Escalade ESV isn’t for the faint of heart. My test car, a top-of-the-line Premium Edition with four-wheel drive, cost $88,295. Let’s just get the obvious out of the way: The Escalade ESV with four-wheel drive gets an EPA-estimated 13/18 mpg city/highway. Ouch. So much for the kids’ college fund.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe 2011 Escalade ESV was so big it made all the other cars around it feel like an entourage of hangers-on. It has plenty of chrome and shined like an opera singer dressed for the stage and ready to hit the high notes.\n\nThe high notes aren’t so much new notes. The Escalade ESV has shiny 22-inch wheels, chromed air vents, and a power liftgate and running boards. The running boards were a source of pain early in my test drive because I kept whacking my shins on them as they automatically dropped down when I opened the door. I did finally remember they were there and seldom hit my shins after a few days. The diva had slayed me.\n\nMy kids — ages 7 and 9 — had few problems getting in the ESV, but closing the doors once they were inside was another matter. If your kids are young they’re going to need some assistance.\n\nThe Escalade ESV is 222.9 inches long. Make sure to measure your garage before bringing this beast home. I could fit it in my garage but couldn’t close the garage door because the bumper obscured the door’s sensor. Don’t say you weren’t warned.\n\nThe Escalade ESV has a 403-horsepower, 6.2-liter V-8. It uses regular gas or E85 ethanol, which lowers its fuel economy to 9/13 mpg.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair-Great\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nINTERIOR\nThere’s something about the Escalade ESV that feels old school. It could be its old-fashioned gear shifter on the steering-wheel column or its key for starting the SUV. Yes, in this $88,000-plus SUV I had to put the key in the ignition and start it myself.\n\nWith standard seating for seven, many might think of the Escalade ESV as a minivan alternative. An optional second-row bench seat increases seating capacity to eight. The problem is it isn’t family-friendly; it’s more Hollywood-friendly. There are only two sets of lower Latch anchors in its three rows of seats, and the second row’s cupholders are on the rear of the front row’s center console. This position is difficult for kids in car seats to use. There also aren’t any bottleholders in the doors.\n\nIn the front row, I enjoyed the heated and cooled seats and the heated steering wheel. The heated and cooled cupholders, which worked well, won my heart. However, the brushed-aluminum trim on the center stack and center console kept reflecting the sunlight right into my eyes. I’m such a whiner. Who’s the diva now?\n\nIt’s in the third row where the Escalade ESV pays off. It has 9.3 inches of extra legroom in the third row versus the regular Escalade, and it seats three, which is awesome. What’s not awesome is the third row is split 50/50, so the person in the center position sits on a big crack between the seats. The major hiccup I had is there’s no power-folding mechanism for the third row, and because the cargo area is ginormous and long, it requires you to climb into the cargo area to fold the seats. They don’t fold flat, but they’re removable. When removed, there’s not a flat load floor because of the third row’s footwell, which is great when sitting in the third row. The second row has a power-folding mechanism, but I had to unfold the seats manually. Ultimately, it seems as though the Escalade ESV has to muscle a lot of features when it should be finessing these things by now.\n\nIf your kids are in high school, the Escalade ESV is a good fit. And for crying out loud, if you ever tow anything the ESV is a good fit. If you have a small garage, a small wallet or small children, you’ll want to seriously consider whether this SUV is a good fit.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore\n\nSAFETY\nThe Escalade ESV’s second-row captain’s chairs had the only Latch anchors in this three-row SUV. The Latch anchors are easy to access. The tether anchors are at the bottom of the captain’s chair seatbacks, so their accessibility isn’t great but this isn’t uncommon. A variety of child-safety seats fit without a problem in the Escalade ESV, with the exception of the third row’s center seating position.\n\nThe 2011 Escalade ESV received three out of five stars in rollover crash-test ratings by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, but it hasn’t undergone the agency’s other crash tests. It also hasn’t been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.\n\nStandard safety features include rear-wheel drive, all-disc antilock brakes, an electronic stability system with rollover mitigation technology, traction control, a blind spot warning system, a backup camera with rear parking sensors, and six airbags, including side curtains for all three rows. Four-wheel drive is optional.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2011 Cadillac Escalade ESV here.",

      "expert_review": "This summer my brood went from a four-pack to a family of five. With three wee ones in child-safety seats, I jump at the chance to test-drive any vehicle that boasts three rows. Tack on the 2013 Cadillac Escalade’s price tag of more than $75,000 and I thought I was in for the one of the best weeks of my automotive life. Boy, was I mistaken.\n\nWhile the 2013 Cadillac Escalade may have three rows and a long list of standard luxury features, its high step-in height and severe lack of legroom or cargo space left me sorely disappointed.\n\nThis three-row SUV was a behemoth to drive and seemed even larger when I was parking. It felt bloated on the road. When merging onto the highway, I felt like I really had to push its 6.2-liter V-8 engine to get up to speed.\n\nThe base Escalade has a starting price of $64,165, including a $995 destination charge. My test car was a well-equipped Premium trim and came in at a jaw-dropping $75,220. Don’t pick your jaw up yet; the top-of-the-line Platinum trim starts at $80,940.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThere’s no doubt about it — the Escalade is flashy. Thanks to the 22-inch “ultra-machine finished” wheels and chrome-trimmed everything, it’s an SUV that turns heads. It’s big and bulky, but with its recognizable hash-tag-like grille, it’s undoubtedly a Cadillac.\n\nLike most SUVs, the Escalade has a high step-in height and heavy doors. Thanks to the power running boards, it wasn’t an issue for me, but my small children struggled with the height. By struggled I mean couldn’t climb in by themselves, leaving me to lift them up and into the Escalade every time. It also took a significant heave-ho to lift my newborn and her infant carrier into the second row.\n\nWith the third-row bench in use, the cargo area is non-existent. An umbrella stroller and maybe a couple bags of groceries might fit, but that’s it. I had to keep the cargo area completely clear because my 4-year-old and I used it as a loading dock of sorts. Thanks to her two younger sisters and their child-safety seats in the second row, she was banished to the tiny third row. Unfortunately, she’s not quite coordinated enough to buckle up by herself, so I had to hurl myself up into the cargo area to reach over the back of the third row and buckle her. I appreciated the extra calorie burn, but by the second day of 20-minute buckle-ups I was cursing Cadillac. Thankfully, a power liftgate comes standard or else my daughters would have added even more colorful words to their vocabularies.\n\nIt’s a three-step process to fold and tumble the third-row seats. The seats were bulky and heavy, and I broke a sweat anytime I had to maneuver them. If you’re comfortable with a four-seater SUV, the Escalade’s third row can be removed, and if you ever go to Costco, you may have to do that.\n\nThe 2013 Cadillac Escalade has a 6.8-liter V-8 engine with 403 horsepower and a six-speed automatic transmission; it uses regular unleaded gasoline. With rear-wheel drive, the Escalade gets an EPA-estimated 14/18 mpg city/highway. My all-wheel-drive test car gets 13/18 mpg. During my test drive of mostly city driving, I only averaged 10 mpg.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Not Really\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): None\n\nINTERIOR\nWith plush leather seats that are heated and cooled and a heated leather-wrapped steering wheel, the Escalade’s interior is not only fancy but also comfortable. Unfortunately, that’s where my positive marks end for the Escalade. I struggled from the get-go with its multimedia system and had to reference the owner’s manual to pair my smartphone to it. That was a first for me. While the multimedia system comes standard, I just wasn’t a fan. The controls weren’t well laid out, making it one of the least intuitive systems I’ve used in a while.\n\nEven though the 2013 Escalade has seating for seven with second-row captain’s chairs or eight if you opt for the available three-seat bench in the second row, I find the numbers to be laughable. My family of five — with three in child-safety seats — lacked legroom in all rows and were cramped overall. With my two youngest in the second-row captain’s chairs, my preschooler and her booster were put in the third row. Considering the complete lack of legroom in the last row, she is probably the largest person I would allow back there.\n\nFor an SUV of this size, I expected more storage. What’s the point of having a beautifully appointed car if it’s cluttered and has items rolling about? While the center console was beautiful to look at, I needed more nooks and crannies for all the junk that comes with hauling around a bunch of munchkins, and I could have used some more cupholders and bottleholders.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair-Ample\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2013 Escalade has received an overall safety rating of four stars of five from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. It also earned five stars in front and side crash tests and three stars in rollover crash tests. It hasn’t been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.\n\nAlthough the Escalade has three rows of seats, it only has two sets of lower Latch anchors, which are found in the second row. My infant’s rear-facing car seat was a tight fit in the Escalade’s second row; this isn’t a surprise as many cars have this problem. However, even my daughter in her forward-facing convertible had complaints. With the front seats set for my 6-foot-2 husband, my middle daughter’s feet were touching the seatback (and that’s with her knees bent).\n\nThe Escalade Premium has standard rear-wheel drive, four-wheel-disc antilock brakes, an electronic stability system with antiroll control and traction control, a blind spot warning system, a backup camera with rear parking sensors and six airbags, including side curtains for all three rows.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2013 Cadillac Escalade here.",

      "expert_review": "Like a linebacker in an expensive suit, the Escalade has dynamite looks and slick moves, and while its price matches foreign competitors, its sophistication falls just short.\n\nIn the 16 years since the Cadillac Escalade first appeared as General Motors’ answer to the Lincoln Navigator it’s been a popular model, and for good reason: What you see here is essentially the flagship American luxury vehicle — a seven-seat SUV (eight if you get the second-row bench). The only other luxury vehicle made by an American company on American soil that’s more expensive than the Escalade is a Tesla Model S, but its volume and appeal are so small that I feel safe in giving the crown to the Escalade (for now).\n\nFor 2015, the big Cadillac has received a complete redesign, as have its Chevrolet Tahoe/Suburban and GMC Yukon siblings (compare 2015 and 2014 models here). As before, if you need more space you can opt for the Suburban-sized, long-wheelbase ESV model. The powertrain carries over, but the sheet metal and much of the mechanical bits are completely new, resulting in an Escalade that feels different from the outgoing model.\n\nExterior & Styling\nAt first glance, this doesn’t look like a mild makeover, with a new shape that’s considerably sharper than the outgoing model. It has a creased, pressed look, but its bulk cannot be disguised as anything other than mass; the overall appearance brings to mind a linebacker in an expensive, well-tailored suit. The nose fully keeps with the current Cadillac look, featuring jewel-like headlamps that stretch up into the fenders.\n\nIn my test truck, the lamps were the optional full-LED style. A new body-side crease runs the full length of the truck, from the headlamps to the tail, and the doors no longer wrap into the roof like they used to. They’re now fully enclosed in the body-side, which Cadillac says improves wind noise on the road. Out back, the taillights run from the bumper to the top of the roof, like a Volvo wagon. The look is modern, clean and nicely updated — a far cry from the phoned-in, mild makeover Lincoln gave the Navigator for 2015.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe only engine available in the 2015 Cadillac Escalade is the big 420-horsepower, 6.2-liter V8, which is the optional large motor for most of GM’s full-size pickups, mated to a six-speed automatic transmission that drives either the rear or all four wheels. The engine is more than capable of eliciting some rapid movement out of the big Escalade, accompanied by a matching basso profundo soundtrack that lets everyone know that this is most definitely not a twin-turbo six-cylinder.\n\nAcceleration is strong but not overpowering. Handling is surprisingly tight for such a big truck-based SUV, but the ride is the most impressive attribute. Cadillac’s Magnetic Ride Control suspension is present here, actively monitoring changing pavement and terrain conditions and adjusting the shock absorbers in minute, nearly instant response to smooth out whatever you happen to roll over. It creates a calm, controlled, serene experience when driving over rough pavement or smooth asphalt. Even with the big 22-inch alloy wheels, which on some vehicles produce a harsh and choppy ride, the Cadillac Escalade just glides on with the faintest of cabin thumps and bumps, with no harsh feedback through the steering wheel or pedals. If the driving experience is a bit too calm for you, there’s a selectable Sport mode that changes the transmission shift pattern, ride firmness and the degree of power-steering assist. But why anyone would want to put a behemoth such as this into Sport mode is a mystery — it will never be mistaken for anything approaching athletic, not with this size and mass to contend with.\n\nCompetitors are similar in price, but not in nature. The recently revised Lincoln Navigator has a new twin-turbocharged EcoBoost V-6 as its only engine, replacing a V8, which leaves the less-expensive Navigator with a 40-hp deficit versus the Escalade. Like the Cadillac Escalade, however, it does have an optional active suspension that does wonders for its body-motion control. The Mercedes-Benz GL-Class is a worthy competitor: Not quite as big as an Escalade, it features far more powertrain options, from V-6 and twin-turbocharged V-8 gas engines to diesels. It feels a lot more expensive and sophisticated, as well. The Lexus LX 570 is a fancied-up version of Toyota’s already impressive Land Cruiser, which is given an expensive Lexus treatment but just one powertrain. Like the Escalade, it’s available only with a V-8 engine, but one that’s nearly 40 hp shy of the Cadillac’s figure.\n\nFuel economy for the Cadillac Escalade is above-average for its class thanks to technologies like cylinder deactivation, but it will still give environmentalists fits. The 2015 4×4 model is rated 14/21/16 mpg city/highway/combined, and I managed to squeeze out 16.5 mpg during a week of mixed city and highway use. Perhaps more surprising is the fact that the new turbocharged V-6-powered Navigator isn’t any better than the more-powerful V-8 Escalade, rated 15/20/17 mpg for 4×4 models. That bests the Cadillac by 1 mpg in city and combined mileage, but falls short by 1 mpg on the highway. The Escalade is better than the V-8-powered GL550 and its 13/18/15 mpg rating, and even that is better than the LX 570’s dismal 12/17/14 mpg rating. The fact that the big Escalade can do so well against physically smaller competitors with smaller, less-powerful motors speaks well to the engineering work that’s gone into it.\n\nInterior\nThe cabin is where Cadillac Cadillac put a lot of effort, and it shows in a design that’s light years ahead of the outgoing model (and puts the latest Lincoln Navigator back on the delivery truck). The newest Chevrolet Tahoe and GMC Yukon feature excellent, high-quality interiors, but the Cadillac’s shapes and materials are even more impressive. Dark chocolate leather stitched in rich red thread covers the dash and doors, while real wood and matte-finish metal abound. The seats are big and comfortable, covered in equally high-quality leather. Thanks to exceptional attention to detail (including areas not normally clad with leather, like the panel between the dashboard and the door), the Cadillac Escalade luxury finally feels special inside, allowing you to forget its humble roots.\n\nSecond-row seating is available as individual captain’s chairs (as my test truck had) or as a bench seat, giving the Cadillac Escalade flexibility to seat either seven or eight occupants, as the third row technically seats three. It’s a little tight for three full-sized adults back there, however; two is a much more reasonable idea, though it would fit three children.\n\nSecond-row legroom is not quite as plentiful as one might expect in such an enormous vehicle. Front-seat passenger space is also not as copious as expected, with the wide center console eating up a lot of real estate that could have been used for elbow room.\n\nIt is quiet, however, even at highway speeds. The V8 delivers a muted burble through the floor that seems appropriate to the size of the truck, and though tire slap on expansion joints can be an issue, wind noise is largely absent — until one opens the shade for the optional moonroof and hears a rushing whoosh intrude upon the Zen calm. It may be that the moonroof isn’t sealing properly, or just that the aerodynamics of a brick-shaped truck mean that this is where the wind noise will be, but it made me keep the shade closed when the moonroof wasn’t open. With everything buttoned up, having conversations with any of the three rows of occupants is not difficult.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nDespite the dramatically higher quality of the Cadillac Escalade’s interior, all is not perfect. My biggest gripe: The touch-sensitive panels that have proliferated through the Cadillac lineup like an invasive weed have finally appeared in the Escalade, and they’re just as annoying here as anywhere else. The shiny black plastic surfaces attract fingerprints, and the haptic feedback ‘bump’ is simply no substitute for the quality feel of a well-done switch or button. These touch-sensitive panels are now used for just about everything in the Escalade, even ancillary controls like adjustable pedals and the glove box opener.\n\nThe standard Cadillac User Experience is a mixed bag, as it is in other Cadillacs. As multimedia systems go, it’s easy to use and its many connectivity features provide a great deal of functionality. From the swipe motions for changing screens to the Pandora streaming audio, it’s useful. But as with other GM multimedia systems, the voice controls are painfully slow. Push the button, speak your command, count to eight or nine and then CUE will usually do what you’ve asked it to do. That kind of delay is longer than it should be, and needs to be quickly improved.\n\nCargo & Storage\nBeing a full-size SUV, the Cadillac Escalade has an amazing amount of room — more than you’ll find in any import-brand luxury SUV — but there’s less than there was last year due to a change in the way Cadillac has engineered the third row of folding seats. The Lincoln Navigator has an advantage over the Escalade in the way its rear suspension is configured, which allows the Lincoln to have truly fold-flat seats that drop down between the frame rails. The Escalade (and all of GM’s full-size SUVs) cannot do this, and in previous generations that meant requiring the user to physically remove the third row of seats to get a truly flat load floor. The new Escalade’s third-row seat folds flat, but at the cost of several inches of height above it.\n\nHow much did that impact the Escalade? It lost 1.7 cubic feet of cargo room, dropping to 15.2 cubic feet behind the third row. The modifications make the standard Escalade’s cargo room the worst among its main competitors: The Navigator comes in at 18.1 cubic feet behind the third row, while the GL550 sports 16.0 cubic feet and the LX 570 has 15.5 cubic feet. With all rows stored, the Navigator comes out on top again with a standard 103.3 cubic feet to the Escalade’s 94.2, the GL550’s 93.8 and the LX 570’s 83.1. If you require more room, the Escalade is also available in an ESV extended-length version, with most of the length increase coming behind the second row. That truck delivers 39.3 cubic feet of cargo room behind the third row, expandable to 120.9 cubic feet. That still comes up short of the extended-length Navigator L’s 42.6 cubic feet and 128.2 cubic feet of maximum cargo room.\n\nIf you really need more cargo room than the Escalade can provide inside, hook up a trailer and haul it. This is where big, truck-based SUVs like the Cadillac Escalade truly shine over competitors that aren’t quite as ruggedly built — towing things like boats, campers, ATVs or even other cars is something the Escalade excels at, with a tow rating of 8,100 pounds. The Navigator bests that with an 8,600-pound rating, and the Benz and Lexus come close with 7,500- and 7,000-pound ratings themselves, but try pulling as much with one of the more soft-road luxury trucks on the market, like the Audi Q7.\n\nSafety\nThe 2015 Cadillac Escalade received a five-star crash-test rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in side crash tests, but just three stars for rollover protection. (Three-star rollover ratings are rare, most often appearing among full-size, truck-based SUVs and off-road SUVs.) The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has not yet tested the Escalade. See the results of all crash tests here.\n\nMajor safety upgrades include front and rear automatic braking that relies on short-range radar to detect objects and halt the vehicle autonomously, part of an optional Driver Assist Package that also includes full-speed adaptive cruise control. A new, model-exclusive front-center airbag deploys between the front seats in the event of a side-impact crash, while blind spot alert, cross traffic alert and lane change alert are standard on Luxury and Premium trim levels. An optional Driver Awareness Package adds forward collision alert, lane departure warning and the safety alert seat that vibrates to warn drivers of dangerous situations. While not technically a safety system, if you were planning to steal a new Escalade, know that new anti-theft measures have been added, too, such as glass-breakage sensors, motion detectors and a level orientation indicator to prevent wheel theft. See all the Escalade’s standard safety equipment here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nAlong with the bump in refinement, luxury, safety equipment and technology has come a bump in price. The new Cadillac Escalade base price starts at $72,690 (including destination charge) for a base 4×2 model; my Premium 4×4 began at $83,790. It was pretty well loaded at that point, so added options were few: retractable power side steps for $1,695, 22-inch wheels for $500 and Majestic Plum Metallic paint for $495, bringing the total to $86,480. That’s an eye-popping sum of money for a GM SUV, but at least the latest Escalade brings significant technology and content to justify some of that lofty price tag.\n\nThe Cadillac Escalade’s main competitor is the newly revised Lincoln Navigator, but it seems the Escalade has the upper hand with its latest redesign. Aside from an active suspension, additional safety systems and an entirely new powertrain, the Navigator hasn’t been visually updated much, inside or out. It has the advantage on interior space, however, especially in terms of cargo room. The Navigator’s pricing is well-matched to the Escalade, starting at $62,475 and stretching up past $78,000 for a loaded long-wheelbase version — still considerably more affordable than the Escalade (for now). The Lexus LX 570 is a sizable SUV, as well, with a powerful V-8 engine and room for seven (or eight, in cramped conditions), but its onboard electronics pale in comparison to the sophisticated Cadillac multimedia suite. A 4×4 version starts at $83,855, making it considerably more expensive than most competitors — except the Mercedes-Benz GL550, that is. The V-8-powered Benz SUV starts at $90,875 but is also available in much less expensive V-6 and diesel versions. Compare all four competitors here.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in October 2014 about the 2015 Cadillac Escalade. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2016, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nLike a linebacker in an expensive suit, the Escalade has dynamite looks and slick moves, and while its price matches foreign competitors, its sophistication falls just short.\n\nIn the 16 years since the Cadillac Escalade first appeared as General Motors’ answer to the Lincoln Navigator it’s been a popular model, and for good reason: What you see here is essentially the flagship American luxury vehicle — a seven-seat SUV (eight if you get the second-row bench). The only other luxury vehicle made by an American company on American soil that’s more expensive than the Escalade is a Tesla Model S, but its volume and appeal are so small that I feel safe in giving the crown to the Escalade (for now).\n\nFor 2015, the big Cadillac has received a complete redesign, as have its Chevrolet Tahoe/Suburban and GMC Yukon siblings (compare 2015 and 2014 models here). As before, if you need more space you can opt for the Suburban-sized, long-wheelbase ESV model. The powertrain carries over, but the sheet metal and much of the mechanical bits are completely new, resulting in an Escalade that feels different from the outgoing model.\n\nExterior & Styling\nAt first glance, this doesn’t look like a mild makeover, with a new shape that’s considerably sharper than the outgoing model. It has a creased, pressed look, but its bulk cannot be disguised as anything other than mass; the overall appearance brings to mind a linebacker in an expensive, well-tailored suit. The nose fully keeps with the current Cadillac look, featuring jewel-like headlamps that stretch up into the fenders.\n\nIn my test truck, the lamps were the optional full-LED style. A new body-side crease runs the full length of the truck, from the headlamps to the tail, and the doors no longer wrap into the roof like they used to. They’re now fully enclosed in the body-side, which Cadillac says improves wind noise on the road. Out back, the taillights run from the bumper to the top of the roof, like a Volvo wagon. The look is modern, clean and nicely updated — a far cry from the phoned-in, mild makeover Lincoln gave the Navigator for 2015.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe only engine available in the 2015 Escalade is the big 420-horsepower, 6.2-liter V-8, which is the optional large motor for most of GM’s full-size pickups, mated to a six-speed automatic transmission that drives either the rear or all four wheels. The engine is more than capable of eliciting some rapid movement out of the big Escalade, accompanied by a matching basso profundo soundtrack that lets everyone know that this is most definitely not a twin-turbo six-cylinder.\n\nAcceleration is strong but not overpowering. Handling is surprisingly tight for such a big truck-based SUV, but the ride is the most impressive attribute. Cadillac’s Magnetic Ride Control suspension is present here, actively monitoring changing pavement and terrain conditions and adjusting the shock absorbers in minute, nearly instant response to smooth out whatever you happen to roll over. It creates a calm, controlled, serene experience when driving over rough pavement or smooth asphalt. Even with the big 22-inch wheels, which on some vehicles produce a harsh and choppy ride, the Escalade just glides on with the faintest of cabin thumps and bumps, with no harsh feedback through the steering wheel or pedals. If the driving experience is a bit too calm for you, there’s a selectable Sport mode that changes the transmission shift pattern, ride firmness and the degree of power-steering assist. But why anyone would want to put a behemoth such as this into Sport mode is a mystery — it will never be mistaken for anything approaching athletic, not with this size and mass to contend with.\n\nCompetitors are similar in price, but not in nature. The recently revised Lincoln Navigator has a new twin-turbocharged EcoBoost V-6 as its only engine, replacing a V-8, which leaves the less-expensive Navigator with a 40-hp deficit versus the Escalade. Like the Escalade, however, it does have an optional active suspension that does wonders for its body-motion control. The Mercedes-Benz GL-Class is a worthy competitor: Not quite as big as an Escalade, it features far more powertrain options, from V-6 and twin-turbocharged V-8 gas engines to diesels. It feels a lot more expensive and sophisticated, as well. The Lexus LX 570 is a fancied-up version of Toyota’s already impressive Land Cruiser, which is given an expensive Lexus treatment but just one powertrain. Like the Escalade, it’s available only with a V-8 engine, but one that’s nearly 40 hp shy of the Cadillac’s figure.\n\nFuel economy for the Escalade is above-average for its class thanks to technologies like cylinder deactivation, but it will still give environmentalists fits. The 2015 4×4 model is rated 14/21/16 mpg city/highway/combined, and I managed to squeeze out 16.5 mpg during a week of mixed city and highway use. Perhaps more surprising is the fact that the new turbocharged V-6-powered Navigator isn’t any better than the more-powerful V-8 Escalade, rated 15/20/17 mpg for 4×4 models. That bests the Cadillac by 1 mpg in city and combined mileage, but falls short by 1 mpg on the highway. The Escalade is better than the V-8-powered GL550 and its 13/18/15 mpg rating, and even that is better than the LX 570’s dismal 12/17/14 mpg rating. The fact that the big Escalade can do so well against physically smaller competitors with smaller, less-powerful motors speaks well to the engineering work that’s gone into it.\n\nInterior\nThe cabin is where Cadillac put a lot of effort, and it shows in a design that’s light years ahead of the outgoing model (and puts the latest Lincoln Navigator back on the delivery truck). The newest Chevrolet Tahoe and GMC Yukon feature excellent, high-quality interiors, but the Cadillac’s shapes and materials are even more impressive. Dark chocolate leather stitched in rich red thread covers the dash and doors, while real wood and matte-finish metal abound. The seats are big and comfortable, covered in equally high-quality leather. Thanks to exceptional attention to detail (including areas not normally clad with leather, like the panel between the dashboard and the door), the Escalade finally feels special inside, allowing you to forget its humble roots.\n\nSecond-row seating is available as individual captain’s chairs (as my test truck had) or as a bench seat, giving the Escalade flexibility to seat either seven or eight occupants, as the third row technically seats three. It’s a little tight for three full-sized adults back there, however; two is a much more reasonable idea, though it would fit three children.\n\nSecond-row legroom is not quite as plentiful as one might expect in such an enormous vehicle. Front-seat passenger space is also not as copious as expected, with the wide center console eating up a lot of real estate that could have been used for elbow room.\n\nIt is quiet, however, even at highway speeds. The V-8 delivers a muted burble through the floor that seems appropriate to the size of the truck, and though tire slap on expansion joints can be an issue, wind noise is largely absent — until one opens the shade for the optional moonroof and hears a rushing whoosh intrude upon the Zen calm. It may be that the moonroof isn’t sealing properly, or just that the aerodynamics of a brick-shaped truck mean that this is where the wind noise will be, but it made me keep the shade closed when the moonroof wasn’t open. With everything buttoned up, having conversations with any of the three rows of occupants is not difficult.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nDespite the dramatically higher quality of the Escalade’s interior, all is not perfect. My biggest gripe: The touch-sensitive panels that have proliferated through the Cadillac lineup like an invasive weed have finally appeared in the Escalade, and they’re just as annoying here as anywhere else. The shiny black plastic surfaces attract fingerprints, and the haptic feedback ‘bump’ is simply no substitute for the quality feel of a well-done switch or button. These touch-sensitive panels are now used for just about everything in the Escalade, even ancillary controls like adjustable pedals and the glove box opener.\n\nThe standard Cadillac User Experience is a mixed bag, as it is in other Cadillacs. As multimedia systems go, it’s easy to use and its many connectivity features provide a great deal of functionality. From the swipe motions for changing screens to the Pandora streaming audio, it’s useful. But as with other GM multimedia systems, the voice controls are painfully slow. Push the button, speak your command, count to eight or nine and then CUE will usually do what you’ve asked it to do. That kind of delay is longer than it should be, and needs to be quickly improved.\n\nCargo & Storage\nBeing a full-size SUV, the Escalade has an amazing amount of room — more than you’ll find in any import-brand luxury SUV — but there’s less than there was last year due to a change in the way Cadillac has engineered the third row of folding seats. The Lincoln Navigator has an advantage over the Escalade in the way its rear suspension is configured, which allows the Lincoln to have truly fold-flat seats that drop down between the frame rails. The Escalade (and all of GM’s full-size SUVs) cannot do this, and in previous generations that meant requiring the user to physically remove the third row of seats to get a truly flat load floor. The new Escalade’s third-row seat folds flat, but at the cost of several inches of height above it.\n\nHow much did that impact the Escalade? It lost 1.7 cubic feet of cargo room, dropping to 15.2 cubic feet behind the third row. The modifications make the standard Escalade’s cargo room the worst among its main competitors: The Navigator comes in at 18.1 cubic feet behind the third row, while the GL550 sports 16.0 cubic feet and the LX 570 has 15.5 cubic feet. With all rows stored, the Navigator comes out on top again with a standard 103.3 cubic feet to the Escalade’s 94.2, the GL550’s 93.8 and the LX 570’s 83.1. If you require more room, the Escalade is also available in an ESV extended-length version, with most of the length increase coming behind the second row. That truck delivers 39.3 cubic feet of cargo room behind the third row, expandable to 120.9 cubic feet. That still comes up short of the extended-length Navigator L’s 42.6 cubic feet and 128.2 cubic feet of maximum cargo room.\n\nIf you really need more cargo room than the Escalade can provide inside, hook up a trailer and haul it. This is where big, truck-based SUVs like the Escalade truly shine over competitors that aren’t quite as ruggedly built — towing things like boats, campers, ATVs or even other cars is something the Escalade excels at, with a tow rating of 8,100 pounds. The Navigator bests that with an 8,600-pound rating, and the Benz and Lexus come close with 7,500- and 7,000-pound ratings themselves, but try pulling as much with one of the more soft-road luxury trucks on the market, like the Audi Q7.\n\nSafety\nThe 2015 Escalade received a five-star crash-test rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in side crash tests, but just three stars for rollover protection. (Three-star rollover ratings are rare, most often appearing among full-size, truck-based SUVs and off-road SUVs.) The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has not yet tested the Escalade. See the results of all crash tests here.\n\nMajor safety upgrades include front and rear automatic braking that relies on short-range radar to detect objects and halt the vehicle autonomously, part of an optional Driver Assist Package that also includes full-speed adaptive cruise control. A new, model-exclusive front-center airbag deploys between the front seats in the event of a side-impact crash, while blind spot alert, cross traffic alert and lane change alert are standard on Luxury and Premium trim levels. An optional Driver Awareness Package adds forward collision alert, lane departure warning and the safety alert seat that vibrates to warn drivers of dangerous situations. While not technically a safety system, if you were planning to steal a new Escalade, know that new anti-theft measures have been added, too, such as glass-breakage sensors, motion detectors and a level orientation indicator to prevent wheel theft. See all the Escalade’s standard safety equipment here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nAlong with the bump in refinement, luxury, safety equipment and technology has come a bump in price. The new Escalade starts at $72,690 (including destination charge) for a base 4×2 model; my Premium 4×4 began at $83,790. It was pretty well loaded at that point, so added options were few: retractable power side steps for $1,695, 22-inch wheels for $500 and Majestic Plum Metallic paint for $495, bringing the total to $86,480. That’s an eye-popping sum of money for a GM SUV, but at least the latest Escalade brings significant technology and content to justify some of that lofty price tag. Option one up your way here.\n\nThe Escalade’s main competitor is the newly revised Lincoln Navigator, but it seems the Escalade has the upper hand with its latest redesign. Aside from an active suspension, additional safety systems and an entirely new powertrain, the Navigator hasn’t been visually updated much, inside or out. It has the advantage on interior space, however, especially in terms of cargo room. The Navigator’s pricing is well-matched to the Escalade, starting at $62,475 and stretching up past $78,000 for a loaded long-wheelbase version — still considerably more affordable than the Escalade (for now). The Lexus LX 570 is a sizable SUV, as well, with a powerful V-8 engine and room for seven (or eight, in cramped conditions), but its onboard electronics pale in comparison to the sophisticated Cadillac multimedia suite. A 4×4 version starts at $83,855, making it considerably more expensive than most competitors — except the Mercedes-Benz GL550, that is. The V-8-powered Benz SUV starts at $90,875 but is also available in much less expensive V-6 and diesel versions. Compare all four competitors here.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "The biggest, baddest American luxury vehicle is undisputedly the Cadillac Escalade, a blingy behemoth that prowls the streets of the United States in all its chrome-grille glory, rumbling and roaring its anti-environmental presence. While foreign automakers maintain flagship sedans, like the Mercedes-Benz S-Class and Lexus LS 460, the American love for trucks has elevated rigs like the Escalade to that position here.\n\nIt had been a while since we last experienced Cadillac’s range-topper, so we spent a week with the latest example, a 2017 Cadillac Escalade four-wheel-drive Platinum. We drove a short-wheelbase version that tickled the $100,000 MSRP mark and lacked nothing on the model’s options list except the extra length of the Escalade ESV (see the changes from 2016 to 2017 here).\n\nExterior and Styling\n\nDespite sharing a basic structure with the more plebian (and less expensive) Chevrolet Tahoe and GMC Yukon, the Cadillac Escalade looks nothing like those trucks. Cadillac has done an admirable job of differentiating the Escalade from its brethren, adding distinctive Cadillac cues like blade-style vertical headlights and tall LED tailfins — er, taillights.\n\nThe Escalade’s garish chrome grille is the only blemish on an otherwise smooth-sided, slick and modern design. Integrated side steps that fold out when the doors open add another level of design sophistication, allowing for the function of running boards without the design interruption of fixed boards. Despite some of its more outlandish design elements, this Cadillac Escalade is still a more subdued and sophisticated design than previous models; it doesn’t look out of place when parked among Land Rover Range Rovers and Mercedes-Benz GLS-Class SUVs in the country club parking lot.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nYou’d expect a vehicle this size to feel massive and ponderous, heavy in its body motions and hesitant to change direction, accelerate or brake. And that’s pretty much what you get with the Escalade. There’s no disguising the fact that it’s truly a huge truck, powerful though it may be.\n\nStill built on a stout, steel body-on-frame truck design, the Cadillac Escalade hasn’t gone through any of General Motors’ latest weight-reduction efforts. The Escalade does feature GM’s Magnetic Ride Control, an adjustable suspension that reads the road and adapts shock absorber firmness in lightning-fast time, which helps in controlling squat, dive, roll and other body motions.\n\nIt doesn’t help steering and handling much, as the Escalade’s heft makes it a better cruiser than dancer. It also doesn’t make for a very quiet or supple ride, as there’s only so much you can do to damp 22-inch wheels shod with super-low-profile tires. The smaller 20-inch wheels with taller sidewalls on lesser trims would likely make the Escalade’s ride more luxurious.\n\nThanks to its burly 6.2-liter V-8 engine, the Escalade feels decently quick for a truck of its size. (Cadillac reports its zero-to-60-mph time at a tick less than 6 seconds.) It fires to life with a surprising roar that’s especially loud from outside the vehicle, which you’ll hear if you’re using the remote start. You’d swear the Escalade has an aftermarket exhaust system, so loud and rumbly is its engine, but it comes that loud from the factory.\n\nThe big engine makes 420 horsepower and is mated to a standard eight-speed automatic transmission. My test vehicle came with selectable four-wheel drive, but rear-wheel drive is standard. One benefit of this truck-based setup is the ability to tow 8,300 pounds (8,100 on the longer Escalade ESV), meaning the Cadillac Escalade could pull a good-sized camper trailer or personal watercraft (or two).\n\nFuel economy on this monster is better than you might expect thanks to technology like cylinder deactivation. The EPA rates the four-wheel-drive Escalade at 15/20/17 mpg city/highway/combined, and my week in one netted an observed fuel economy of 18 mpg combined. Not exactly hybrid territory, but for a vehicle this size, it’s acceptable.\n\nCompetitors aren’t much different, with the V-8 powered Mercedes-Benz GLS550 coming in at 14/18/16 mpg, almost matching the performance of the V-8 Land Rover Range Rover, which is rated 14/19/16 mpg. They’re all better than the dismal performance of the Infiniti QX80, however, which is rated 13/19/15 mpg.\n\nInterior\n\nOpen the door to the Cadillac Escalade Platinum’s completely leather-wrapped interior and an automati,c integrated side step folds out of the lower sills to aid you in climbing up. Presumably, this is because the Escalade doesn’t offer an adjustable air suspension to raise and lower the vehicle, as many of its competitors do. Once situated in the cabin, you’ll realize a great effort has been made to make the Escalade feel special and upscale — an effort that doesn’t quite succeed.\n\nThe truck doesn’t feel terribly spacious for something so massive on the outside. The wide center console eats into passenger hip room, and the driving position is awkward; the steering wheel isn’t centered on the driver, a trait common to GM’s full-size trucks that needs to be corrected. Front occupants have plenty of leg and headroom, but second-row passengers may be surprised to find legroom isn’t as plentiful as they might expect in a vehicle this big. Third-row passengers have it even worse, with a seat that will make them feel almost as if they’re sitting on the floor.\n\nMaterial quality is also mixed, as is assembly quality. The surfaces covered in leather feel quite nice, but all the black plastic control surfaces feel cheap. The steering wheel in particular has controls that don’t feel like they belong in a flagship vehicle costing just shy of $100,000, as our test vehicle did. Drop into a Mercedes-Benz GLS or Range Rover and you’ll see what a $100,000 premium luxury interior looks and feels like. Sit in the Escalade’s mishmash of nice cowhides and cheap black plastic, and you’re likely to be disappointed.\n\nElectronics and Ergonomics\n\nThe Cadillac User Experience multimedia system is front and center in the Cadillac Escalade. It’s a more advanced version of the Chevrolet MyLink and Buick/GMC IntelliLink systems. It has a more upscale look to it, and it definitely functions better than it used to, with speedy actions and reliable voice recognition. The touchscreen itself provides haptic feedback when making selections; there’s a barely detectable “thump” when you touch an icon. CUE is better than any system from Lexus or Infiniti in its sophistication, ease of operation and speed, but the Mercedes-Benz system looks classier and works equally well.\n\nFor backseat passengers, there’s not one but two rear entertainment systems. One has a screen that comes down from the ceiling, and the other’s screens are in the backs of the front-seat head restraints. There’s no excuse for second- and third-row passengers to be bored in an Escalade.\n\nCargo & Storage\n\nThe Cadillac Escalade comes in two sizes: regular and ESV. They basically correspond to the lengths of the Chevrolet Tahoe (regular) and longer Suburban (ESV). That extended length comes in both the wheelbase and the rear cargo compartment.\n\nI drove a standard-length Escalade featuring 15.2 cubic feet of cargo room behind the third row and 51.6 cubic feet with the third row stowed. It should be noted, however, that the third row doesn’t exactly fold into the floor in the Escalade. The SUV features a raised rear floor so it appears flush, but unlike the Lincoln Navigator with its independent rear suspension, the Escalade uses a solid rear axle, necessitating a higher cargo floor. Fold the second and third rows and you’ll get a maximum of 94.2 cubic feet of cargo space in the standard Cadillac Escalade. That compares to the Mercedes-Benz GLS and is far more than the Range Rover. It’s a little short of the volume you get in a standard Navigator.\n\nSafety\n\nThe 2017 Cadillac Escalade has not been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, but it has been tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. NHTSA awarded it a four-star rating overall out of five, but only a three-star rollover rating.\n\nThe new Cadillac Escalade features forward and rear automatic emergency braking, which can prevent you from hitting the car in front of you or backing over something in the driveway. New for 2017 is an automatic parallel and perpendicular parking feature, but the really novel new item is the Rear Camera Mirror that has made its way to the Escalade. At the flip of a toggle under the rearview mirror — one that, in most cars, would switch between the normal and darkened mirror for nighttime driving — the mirror instead becomes a high-definition display that uses the rear-mounted camera to show the view behind the vehicle, as if the backseat and rear pillars of the truck weren’t there.\n\nThe camera offers a wider-angle view than the typical mirror, so it definitely takes some getting used to — mostly because it requires you to refocus your eyes. When you’re driving along with a conventional mirror, you’re already looking and focused well ahead of the vehicle. When looking at your rearview mirror, you’re also looking well behind the vehicle — your eyes are focused on a point well off in the distance.\n\nBut if you switch the mirror to the camera display, that same focus isn’t going to work because you’ll no longer be looking at a reflection, but rather a video. It’s as if you had switched your gaze to the radio or speedometer, and while drivers are used to refocusing like that, they’re not used to it when looking at the rearview mirror. Retraining myself to consciously refocus my eyes for the mirror’s camera view took all week. I still wasn’t entirely comfortable doing it by the end of the test, but I was at least more used to it.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nThis is where I have a hard time swallowing what Cadillac is selling. The price for a standard-length, rear-wheel-drive, base Escalade is $74,590. From there, you can go up to Luxury, Premium Luxury and Platinum trims. My Platinum model started at $96,390 for a 4×4 version, then added special Red Passion paint, a chrome exhaust tip and wheel locks for an as-tested price of $97,100. If you opt for the longer ESV and equip it like my test vehicle, the sticker tops $102,000 — frankly, an outrageous price for what is essentially a somewhat nicer Chevrolet Suburban.\n\nLuxury competitors in this price class are not hard to find. The one that matches up best with the standard Cadillac Escalade is the Mercedes-Benz GLS, which comes in only one size but with multiple powertrain options. It doesn’t appear as big on the outside but offers comparable interior space to the standard Escalade and only slightly less towing capacity. The Infiniti QX80 is less expensive than the Escalade but is meant to compete in the same realm. It’s not as powerful as the Cadillac but feels comparably luxurious.\n\nThe Land Rover Range Rover isn’t as big as the Cadillac Escalade but is much more luxurious, and like the Mercedes-Benz, it’s available with several powertrain options. The Lincoln Navigator used to be a direct competitor to the Escalade, but the Cadillac’s past redesign pushed the Escalade well out in front of the Lincoln in terms of luxury, amenities, style and power. The Navigator features a much less powerful twin-turbo V-6 as its only engine option, and until a new Navigator arrives in the next year or two, its size is the only aspect that competes favorably with the Escalade. Compare the Cadillac Escalade with its competitors here.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe full-size Cadillac Escalade SUV has appealed to celebrities and affluent 20-somethings since 2001, when a flashier version debuted. Its competitors include the Lincoln Navigator, Lexus LX 570, Infiniti QX56 and other luxury SUVs. In the spirit of excess, the Escalade boasts available 22-inch wheels and a 6.2-liter V-8 with more than 400 horsepower. It can be configured to seat up to eight people and is available with rear- or all-wheel drive.\n\nNew for 2012\nApart from a revised navigation system and a variety of new anti-theft features, there are no significant changes for 2012.\n\nExterior\nThree-tier headlights and a large crisscrossed grille define the Escalade’s styling, while chrome applications throughout emphasize the vehicle’s luxury status.

      "expert_review": "The biggest, baddest American luxury vehicle is undisputedly the Cadillac Escalade, a blingy behemoth that prowls the streets of the United States in all its chrome-grille glory, rumbling and roaring its anti-environmental presence. While foreign automakers maintain flagship sedans, like the Mercedes-Benz S-Class and Lexus LS 460, the American love for trucks has elevated rigs like the Escalade to that position here.\n\nIt had been a while since we last experienced Cadillac’s range-topper, so we spent a week with the latest example, a 2017 Cadillac Escalade four-wheel-drive Platinum. We drove a short-wheelbase version that tickled the $100,000 MSRP mark and lacked nothing on the model’s options list except the extra length of the Escalade ESV (see the changes from 2016 to 2017 here).\n\nExterior and Styling\n\nDespite sharing a basic structure with the more plebian (and less expensive) Chevrolet Tahoe and GMC Yukon, the Cadillac Escalade looks nothing like those trucks. Cadillac has done an admirable job of differentiating the Escalade from its brethren, adding distinctive Cadillac cues like blade-style vertical headlights and tall LED tailfins — er, taillights.\n\nThe Escalade’s garish chrome grille is the only blemish on an otherwise smooth-sided, slick and modern design. Integrated side steps that fold out when the doors open add another level of design sophistication, allowing for the function of running boards without the design interruption of fixed boards. Despite some of its more outlandish design elements, this Cadillac Escalade is still a more subdued and sophisticated design than previous models; it doesn’t look out of place when parked among Land Rover Range Rovers and Mercedes-Benz GLS-Class SUVs in the country club parking lot.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nYou’d expect a vehicle this size to feel massive and ponderous, heavy in its body motions and hesitant to change direction, accelerate or brake. And that’s pretty much what you get with the Escalade. There’s no disguising the fact that it’s truly a huge truck, powerful though it may be.\n\nStill built on a stout, steel body-on-frame truck design, the Cadillac Escalade hasn’t gone through any of General Motors’ latest weight-reduction efforts. The Escalade does feature GM’s Magnetic Ride Control, an adjustable suspension that reads the road and adapts shock absorber firmness in lightning-fast time, which helps in controlling squat, dive, roll and other body motions.\n\nIt doesn’t help steering and handling much, as the Escalade’s heft makes it a better cruiser than dancer. It also doesn’t make for a very quiet or supple ride, as there’s only so much you can do to damp 22-inch wheels shod with super-low-profile tires. The smaller 20-inch wheels with taller sidewalls on lesser trims would likely make the Escalade’s ride more luxurious.\n\nThanks to its burly 6.2-liter V-8 engine, the Escalade feels decently quick for a truck of its size. (Cadillac reports its zero-to-60-mph time at a tick less than 6 seconds.) It fires to life with a surprising roar that’s especially loud from outside the vehicle, which you’ll hear if you’re using the remote start. You’d swear the Escalade has an aftermarket exhaust system, so loud and rumbly is its engine, but it comes that loud from the factory.\n\nThe big engine makes 420 horsepower and is mated to a standard eight-speed automatic transmission. My test vehicle came with selectable four-wheel drive, but rear-wheel drive is standard. One benefit of this truck-based setup is the ability to tow 8,300 pounds (8,100 on the longer Escalade ESV), meaning the Cadillac Escalade could pull a good-sized camper trailer or personal watercraft (or two).\n\nFuel economy on this monster is better than you might expect thanks to technology like cylinder deactivation. The EPA rates the four-wheel-drive Escalade at 15/20/17 mpg city/highway/combined, and my week in one netted an observed fuel economy of 18 mpg combined. Not exactly hybrid territory, but for a vehicle this size, it’s acceptable.\n\nCompetitors aren’t much different, with the V-8 powered Mercedes-Benz GLS550 coming in at 14/18/16 mpg, almost matching the performance of the V-8 Land Rover Range Rover, which is rated 14/19/16 mpg. They’re all better than the dismal performance of the Infiniti QX80, however, which is rated 13/19/15 mpg.\n\nInterior\n\nOpen the door to the Cadillac Escalade Platinum’s completely leather-wrapped interior and an automati,c integrated side step folds out of the lower sills to aid you in climbing up. Presumably, this is because the Escalade doesn’t offer an adjustable air suspension to raise and lower the vehicle, as many of its competitors do. Once situated in the cabin, you’ll realize a great effort has been made to make the Escalade feel special and upscale — an effort that doesn’t quite succeed.\n\nThe truck doesn’t feel terribly spacious for something so massive on the outside. The wide center console eats into passenger hip room, and the driving position is awkward; the steering wheel isn’t centered on the driver, a trait common to GM’s full-size trucks that needs to be corrected. Front occupants have plenty of leg and headroom, but second-row passengers may be surprised to find legroom isn’t as plentiful as they might expect in a vehicle this big. Third-row passengers have it even worse, with a seat that will make them feel almost as if they’re sitting on the floor.\n\nMaterial quality is also mixed, as is assembly quality. The surfaces covered in leather feel quite nice, but all the black plastic control surfaces feel cheap. The steering wheel in particular has controls that don’t feel like they belong in a flagship vehicle costing just shy of $100,000, as our test vehicle did. Drop into a Mercedes-Benz GLS or Range Rover and you’ll see what a $100,000 premium luxury interior looks and feels like. Sit in the Escalade’s mishmash of nice cowhides and cheap black plastic, and you’re likely to be disappointed.\n\nElectronics and Ergonomics\n\nThe Cadillac User Experience multimedia system is front and center in the Cadillac Escalade. It’s a more advanced version of the Chevrolet MyLink and Buick/GMC IntelliLink systems. It has a more upscale look to it, and it definitely functions better than it used to, with speedy actions and reliable voice recognition. The touchscreen itself provides haptic feedback when making selections; there’s a barely detectable “thump” when you touch an icon. CUE is better than any system from Lexus or Infiniti in its sophistication, ease of operation and speed, but the Mercedes-Benz system looks classier and works equally well.\n\nFor backseat passengers, there’s not one but two rear entertainment systems. One has a screen that comes down from the ceiling, and the other’s screens are in the backs of the front-seat head restraints. There’s no excuse for second- and third-row passengers to be bored in an Escalade.\n\nCargo & Storage\n\nThe Cadillac Escalade comes in two sizes: regular and ESV. They basically correspond to the lengths of the Chevrolet Tahoe (regular) and longer Suburban (ESV). That extended length comes in both the wheelbase and the rear cargo compartment.\n\nI drove a standard-length Escalade featuring 15.2 cubic feet of cargo room behind the third row and 51.6 cubic feet with the third row stowed. It should be noted, however, that the third row doesn’t exactly fold into the floor in the Escalade. The SUV features a raised rear floor so it appears flush, but unlike the Lincoln Navigator with its independent rear suspension, the Escalade uses a solid rear axle, necessitating a higher cargo floor. Fold the second and third rows and you’ll get a maximum of 94.2 cubic feet of cargo space in the standard Cadillac Escalade. That compares to the Mercedes-Benz GLS and is far more than the Range Rover. It’s a little short of the volume you get in a standard Navigator.\n\nSafety\n\nThe 2017 Cadillac Escalade has not been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, but it has been tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. NHTSA awarded it a four-star rating overall out of five, but only a three-star rollover rating.\n\nThe new Cadillac Escalade features forward and rear automatic emergency braking, which can prevent you from hitting the car in front of you or backing over something in the driveway. New for 2017 is an automatic parallel and perpendicular parking feature, but the really novel new item is the Rear Camera Mirror that has made its way to the Escalade. At the flip of a toggle under the rearview mirror — one that, in most cars, would switch between the normal and darkened mirror for nighttime driving — the mirror instead becomes a high-definition display that uses the rear-mounted camera to show the view behind the vehicle, as if the backseat and rear pillars of the truck weren’t there.\n\nThe camera offers a wider-angle view than the typical mirror, so it definitely takes some getting used to — mostly because it requires you to refocus your eyes. When you’re driving along with a conventional mirror, you’re already looking and focused well ahead of the vehicle. When looking at your rearview mirror, you’re also looking well behind the vehicle — your eyes are focused on a point well off in the distance.\n\nBut if you switch the mirror to the camera display, that same focus isn’t going to work because you’ll no longer be looking at a reflection, but rather a video. It’s as if you had switched your gaze to the radio or speedometer, and while drivers are used to refocusing like that, they’re not used to it when looking at the rearview mirror. Retraining myself to consciously refocus my eyes for the mirror’s camera view took all week. I still wasn’t entirely comfortable doing it by the end of the test, but I was at least more used to it.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nThis is where I have a hard time swallowing what Cadillac is selling. The price for a standard-length, rear-wheel-drive, base Escalade is $74,590. From there, you can go up to Luxury, Premium Luxury and Platinum trims. My Platinum model started at $96,390 for a 4×4 version, then added special Red Passion paint, a chrome exhaust tip and wheel locks for an as-tested price of $97,100. If you opt for the longer ESV and equip it like my test vehicle, the sticker tops $102,000 — frankly, an outrageous price for what is essentially a somewhat nicer Chevrolet Suburban.\n\nLuxury competitors in this price class are not hard to find. The one that matches up best with the standard Cadillac Escalade is the Mercedes-Benz GLS, which comes in only one size but with multiple powertrain options. It doesn’t appear as big on the outside but offers comparable interior space to the standard Escalade and only slightly less towing capacity. The Infiniti QX80 is less expensive than the Escalade but is meant to compete in the same realm. It’s not as powerful as the Cadillac but feels comparably luxurious.\n\nThe Land Rover Range Rover isn’t as big as the Cadillac Escalade but is much more luxurious, and like the Mercedes-Benz, it’s available with several powertrain options. The Lincoln Navigator used to be a direct competitor to the Escalade, but the Cadillac’s past redesign pushed the Escalade well out in front of the Lincoln in terms of luxury, amenities, style and power. The Navigator features a much less powerful twin-turbo V-6 as its only engine option, and until a new Navigator arrives in the next year or two, its size is the only aspect that competes favorably with the Escalade.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Cadillac Escalade?\n\nThe Cadillac Escalade full-size SUV seats up to eight in three rows. It also comes in extended-length ESV form that offers more cargo space and third-row legroom than the regular-length version. Rear- and four-wheel-drive models are offered, and all Escalades are powered by a 420-horsepower, 6.2-liter V-8 that works with a 10-speed automatic transmission. The Escalade shares its platform with the Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban and the GMC Yukon and Yukon XL. Competitors include the Lincoln Navigator, Lexus LX 570 and Infiniti QX80.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Cadillac Escalade?\n\nThere are no significant changes this year. A redesigned Escalade is expected soon.\n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Cadillac Escalade Are Most Important?\n\nAll Escalades come standard with the Cadillac User Experience multimedia system. CUE features an 8-inch touchscreen, navigation, five USB ports, and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Other standard features include wireless device charging, a power-adjustable steering column, tri-zone automatic climate control, 4G LTE connectivity with a Wi-Fi hot spot (data subscription required after initial trial), power-adjustable pedals, heated and cooled front seats, heated second-row seats, a heated steering wheel, a 360-degree camera system, a power-folding third row and a Bose surround-sound audio system.\n\nPremium options include 18-way power-adjustable front seats with a massage feature for the driver, a cooled center console and a rearview camera mirror. Available active safety features include forward collision warning, lane departure warning, lane keep assist, blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert, adaptive cruise control, and front and rear automatic emergency braking.\n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Cadillac Escalade?\n\nThe Escalade is known for big, flashy styling, a powerful V-8 and a luxurious interior. It comes at a steep price, though, as the Escalade starts at more than $76,000. If you choose one of the top trims, a six-figure price tag is in sight. Unfortunately, there’s less space in the Escalade’s cabin than its exterior bulk suggests, and the SUV’s touch-sensitive cabin controls aren’t the easiest to use. We recommend checking out the Navigator, too, if the Escalade is on your shopping list. Also be aware that a redesigned Escalade is expected soon.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2021 Cadillac Escalade is a technological showcase, a coddling limousine and a worthy claimant of the flagship American luxury vehicle title.\n\nVersus the competition: The new Escalade easily challenges the Lincoln Navigator for American luxury supremacy, and it even provides a legitimately refined, technologically advanced rival for BMW, Land Rover and Mercedes-Benz.\n\nBehold, ladies and gentlemen, the absolute pinnacle of the modern American luxury vehicle: the all-new 2021 Cadillac Escalade. Gone is the garish, cringeworthy styling, the oversized features, the questionable chrome. Gone are the cheap plastics, the laughable switches and the cramped third row. In its place, we have style. Poise. Actual honest-to-God refinement. Technology and power and equipment that makes the Escalade a fully competitive, modern luxury vehicle. At first glance, it seems the Cadillac team has reinvented the Escalade, leaving behind the rebodied badge job of past models and creating something fresh and impressive. But have they? Or is this new Escalade’s beauty only skin deep?\n\nRelated: 2021 Cadillac Escalade: Very Good, But Good Enough?\n\nNewfound Style, Outside and In\n\nThe new ’21 Escalade is the last of GM’s three big SUVs to get a redesign, joining the 2021 Chevrolet Tahoe and GMC Yukon, sitting on an all-new platform that’s bigger in almost every dimension, inside and out. The Escalade has received all-new styling to go with it, and it’s a refreshingly clean and modern take on what traditionally has been something of a garish hot mess. Yes, there’s still plenty of chrome on the new Escalade, especially on the top-of-the-line Platinum trim, but it’s been added in tasteful strips and accents, not slathered on in sheets. And if you’d rather not have any chrome, you can opt for the blacked-out Sport trim, which brings a truly menacing, murdered-out look to the Escalade. The front end swaps the old Escalade’s vertical headlight orientation for a more horizontal look, making it seem wider and lower. Out back, the signature super-tall, slim LED taillights carry over from the old model, stretching up from the bumper to the roof. The overall look is fully in keeping with the latest Cadillac design aesthetic, which has taken most of its inspiration from the 2016 Cadillac Escala concept car. It looked good on that concept and it looks good here, too.\n\nInside is where the new Escalade really sets itself apart from the old one and makes you start to wonder if Cadillac has finally produced a luxury SUV that can be compared with the likes of Mercedes-Benz and Range Rover without a bunch of “yeah, buts.” The centerpiece of the cabin is the massive new curved organic light-emitting diode touchscreen and gauge display that extends from in front of the driver to mid-dashboard. It’s 38 inches (diagonally) of some of the clearest, sharpest digital display I’ve ever experienced regardless of venue — automotive, personal electronics, flatscreen TV, anything. It’s not just that the icons are big, but they’re easy to read and pop off the impossibly deep-black background even in bright, direct sunlight.\n\nOn your left is a digital touch panel that controls aspects of the trip computer, head-up display and central gauge cluster. The instrument-panel area is reconfigurable to show traditional gauges, a full-width navigation map, an optional night-vision display or a new augmented reality camera navigation system that overlays virtual signs and prompts over a live view forward. It’s all easy to use, positioned high enough not to be distracting, and low enough not to block your view outward. The screen to your right is a full multimedia touchscreen that allows a level of control and customization to the Escalade that is new to the brand, and it finally delivers on the promise of a unique, Cadillac-oriented multimedia system to set it apart from GM’s lesser brands. Simply put, the display technology in the Escalade goes a long way toward justifying the price premium the Escalade commands over a loaded GMC Yukon Denali. It is gorgeous, remarkable and beautifully executed.\n\nThe rest of the interior is finally representative of a proper luxury SUV. High-quality leather wraps the seats, dash, doors, even that curved digital display. But it’s not all touch-sensitive panels; Cadillac tried that route already and understands now that luxury is conveyed through precision mechanical movement of switches and buttons, not just nice-to-touch but immobile materials. The climate control display panel looks and feels as good as anything you’d find in a Mercedes-Benz, which I personally hold up as today’s benchmark for a luxury interior.\n\nThe stunning technology extends to the audio system, as well, with a standard 19-speaker AKG Studio audio system or what this model has — the optional 36-speaker AKG Studio Reference premium audio system. Yes, that’s right: 36 speakers. They’re everywhere. The roof, the pillars, the doors, the cargo area, even in the head restraints just inches from your ears. It sounds amazing — easily a rival for the equally stellar top Revel system that you’ll find in the latest Lincoln Navigator. And it sounds amazing from every seat in the Escalade, even in the surprisingly comfortable third row.\n\nThere’s a bunch of other impressive technology, too, like an electronic conversation aid that broadcasts people’s voices using microphones and the Escalade’s speakers, and illuminated USB ports at every seat. Eventually, Cadillac’s Super Cruise semi-autonomous driving system will return to the showroom in the Escalade (it wasn’t quite ready at the time of our test drive). And it’s not just the technology that’s impressive: The extra 10 inches of legroom for the third row and sliding second-row seats mean there isn’t an uncomfortable seat anywhere. Between the massive influx of flagship technology and the vastly improved interior packaging and comfort, Cadillac’s starting to back up the Escalade’s lofty price with some true justification.\n\nThe Engine Is Irrelevant\n\nThe driving experience only reinforces that idea. To start, all Escalades will be powered by a standard 420-horsepower, 6.2-liter V-8 that’s the top optional engine in the Chevrolet Tahoe and GMC Yukon (a turbo-diesel 3.0-liter six-cylinder is a no-cost option). Rear-wheel drive is standard; four-wheel drive is optional. The big V-8 comes mated to a 10-speed automatic transmission, and it’s silky smooth in its always-ready power delivery. The transmission is perfectly tuned to this engine, never hunting for a gear, always ready to launch the Escalade without drama or fuss. It’s kind of a shame that there’s no more power here than you’ll find in the Chevy, but honestly, the changes to the Escalade have largely made what’s under the hood … sort of unimportant.\n\nThe idea seems to be that the engine shouldn’t matter much if you can’t hear or see it, and as long as there are no complaints about its performance, why give it more power just to give it more power? Cadillac is counting on buyers not really giving the engine much attention — between the noise cancellation efforts, the astonishingly quiet cabin’s lack of wind or road noise, and the whisper quiet exhaust when cruising along at highway speeds, the engine just isn’t what you focus on when driving the Escalade.\n\nInstead, the new Escalade’s luxuriously serene, silent cruising operation makes piloting this massive land yacht an experience in nostalgic American luxury. Driving the Escalade is effortless, relaxing and coddling in ways that luxury cars haven’t felt in years. The ride quality is exceptional thanks to an air suspension and GM’s magical Magnetic Ride Control shock absorbers, and while you’ll feel some of the road’s surface imperfections transmitted into the cabin because of the enormous wheels, they’re by no means going to disturb your zen. The steering is nicely weighted, not floaty, and the body control is flat in corners. You’re not going to attack a twisty stretch of road with gusto in this Escalade — it’s much too heavy and isolating for that — but neither are you going to make yourself or your passengers sick when transitioning from your home high in the Hollywood hills down to lunch with your agent in Malibu. The Escalade feels well controlled and just nimble enough to further feed that sensation of effortless, luxurious serenity that Cadillac engineers have successfully created.\n\nIt’s Still Expensive but Finally Feels Worth It\n\nNone of this newfound serenity and sophistication comes cheap in the Escalade. The entry price for a base model Escalade Luxury trim is $77,490 (prices include destination), but if you start ticking the options off with a heavy finger, you’ll quickly arrive at this Platinum 4WD’s as-tested price of $109,965. That’s not even where it tops out; choose a long-wheelbase Escalade ESV Platinum 4WD with every possible option and your new flagship Cadillac SUV will easily top $122,000.\n\nI drove the new 2021 GMC Yukon Denali a few weeks prior to driving this latest Escalade and came away mightily impressed with the GMC. I said then that Cadillac had better come up with something truly dynamite to justify the extra cost of the Escalade over the already high price of the outstanding Yukon Denali. After experiencing what Cadillac has created in the new Escalade — an exceptionally refined, technology-packed, outstanding American flagship luxury vehicle — I can finally, finally say that the Escalade feels like it’s worth the kind of money Cadillac wants you to pay for one.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Competes with: Mercedes-AMG G63, BMW Alpina XB7, Land Rover Range Rover SV\n\nLooks like: An Escalade Sport Platinum with different wheels\n\nDrivetrain: 682-horsepower, supercharged 6.2-liter V-8; 10-speed automatic transmission; full-time all-wheel drive\n\nHit dealerships: Late summer 2022\n\nFor just a few moments, Cadillac would like you to forget everything it’s been saying for the last year or two regarding the brand’s push for electrified vehicles. Right now, Cadillac is a strange mix of two brands with two very different missions, with a little devil sitting on one shoulder and an angel on the other. The angel is pushing hard for a responsible, environmentally friendly, fully electric future with models like the new 2023 Lyriq SUV EV, while the devil keeps tempting buyers with a slew of late-to-the-party high-performance, gasoline-gulping cars like the stunningly good, fire-breathing CT5-V Blackwing sport sedan. The latest model to arrive in the Cadillac showroom is repping the indulgent, hedonistic side of the brand: the 2023 Cadillac Escalade-V, the brand’s first-ever V-branded SUV and, according to Cadillac, the most powerful full-size performance SUV you can buy, period.\n\nRelated: 2021 Cadillac Escalade: 5 Things We Like (and 3 Not So Much)\n\nAll About Power\n\nThe highlight of the new Escalade-V, and the SUV’s basic reason for existing, is under the hood where Cadillac has implanted a hand-assembled supercharged 6.2-liter V-8 engine very similar to what’s in the CT5-V Blackwing. Featuring some slightly different tuning for the SUV’s different airflow, it makes 682 horsepower and 653 pounds-feet of torque, and shunts it all through a 10-speed automatic transmission to all four wheels. A limited slip differential is employed, but all-wheel drive is a full-time feature, with at least some torque always being applied to the front wheels, according to Cadillac.\n\nThe power should be good for an estimated 0-60 mph time of less than 4.4 seconds and a quarter-mile time of 12.7 seconds at 110 mph. Cadillac claims this is the most powerful full-size SUV you can buy, outdoing the 2022 Mercedes-AMG G63 (577 hp, 627 pounds-feet of torque), the 2022 BMW Alpina XB7 (612 hp, 590 pounds-feet of torque) and anything else out there. Of course, this is a bit problematic, as really the only other true full-size SUVs are from Ford and Stellantis these days, and neither offer high-performance versions of the Lincoln Navigator or Jeep Wagoneer (yet).\n\nOther mechanical changes are limited to special tuning for the standard Magnetic Ride Control and air suspension; the addition of standard Brembo six-piston front calipers (an option on other, lesser Escalades); a standard performance exhaust; and the addition of V-Mode, which allows the driver to create a special mode tailored to exactly how they want to set up the Escalade-V. With just the push of a button, V-Mode can adjust the suspension, steering feedback, brake pedal feel, AWD, engine performance and exhaust.\n\nWhat all this does not do is try to turn the big Escalade into a track-ready SUV; that is not the Escalade-V’s mission, according to Cadillac representatives. Track-monster Cadillacs wear the Blackwing badge, while street-oriented performance cars wear the V badge. V’s are for driving to the track, while V Blackwings are for driving on the track, brand reps said during a conference call with the media. This is why the Escalade-V instead emphasizes straightline performance instead of handling improvements, and given the SUV’s very high center of gravity, track use would just be silly. This strategy differentiates the Cadillac Escalade-V’s approach compared with rivals like Mercedes-Benz’s AMG brand, in which everything has to have a track-capable mode, even when these vehicles are rarely taken to racetracks.\n\nFlying Under the Radar?\n\nWhere the new Escalade-V falls a little short might be in the cosmetic changes that turn it from Sport Platinum (which also has blacked-out trim) to V. On the outside, there are new front and rear bumpers, with a dedicated four-outlet rear exhaust that’s distinct from the bumper itself (no fake tips here). There are also special dark 22-inch wheels designed to help improve brake cooling and distinct V badging. All in all, it doesn’t look that much different from a standard Sport Platinum trim.\n\nInside, there are even fewer differentiation points. The only changes from a loaded Sport Platinum trim are a specific look to the digital gauge cluster and a “V” badge on the steering wheel. The rest of the cabin is straight-up Sport Platinum trim, with standard Zebra wood trim and your choice of either black or Dark Auburn semi-aniline leather throughout.\n\nThe 38-inch curved OLED screen seen in all Escalades is present, and the 36-speaker AKG premium audio system is also standard. The only curious bit: Cadillac wants to include the latest and greatest version of the Super Cruise semi-autonomous driving system when the Escalade-V goes on sale late this summer, but the automaker fully admits that this is going to depend on the status of the microchip shortage that’s impacted automakers around the world. If the system does appear, it will be added late in the year.\n\n2023 Cadillac Escalade-V | Manufacturer image\nThe Most Expensive Escalade Yet\n\nHow much will it cost you to get this special engine and extra tuning? The 2023 Cadillac Escalade-V starts at $149,990, including destination, or nearly $25,000 more than a totally loaded 2022 Sport Platinum model. A long-wheelbase Escalade-V ESV will also be available, but pricing was not given for that model; Cadillac said that it had not been finalized, but given that the standard price add for going from a regular to long-wheelbase Escalade is about $3,000, the company said to figure on that price difference transferring to the V model.\n\nCadillac also said that production of the Escalade-V will be limited; the automaker wouldn’t give a set number but said that the brand wants to maintain exclusivity for the V. And while no preorder system is being set up, distribution of the Escalade-V will follow the pattern of normal Escalade sales, with more units going to areas that sell more of the model. So if you want to get on the list of preorders, you need to get chummy with your local Cadillac dealer so they’ll give you a call when the order books open for deliveries.\n\nMore From Cars.com: \n\n2021 Cadillac Escalade Review: Expensive, and Worth It\nCadillac Escalade: Which Should You Buy, 2021 or 2022?\nBest Luxury Car of 2022\n2023 Toyota Sequoia vs. 2022 Chevrolet Tahoe: Comparing the Interiors\n2022 Cadillac Escalade Specs and Reviews\nFind a 2022 Cadillac Escalade Near You \n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

The Escalade’s standard powertrain is a 420-horsepower, 6.2-liter V-8 that sends power to the rear wheels via a 10-speed automatic transmission. Also available is a relatively fuel-efficient 277-hp, turbo-diesel 3.0-liter six-cylinder. Rear-wheel drive is standard, and four-wheel drive is available with either engine. \n\nThe high-performance Escalade-V borrows the supercharged V-8 used in Cadillac’s CT5-V Blackwing performance sedan; it has an earth-moving 682 hp, as well as specific styling touches, upgraded brakes and suspension, retuned air suspension settings and standard 4WD. \n\nCadillac also offers the Escalade in an extended-length ESV version with even more cargo space and third-row legroom. You can see how cargo space varies by checking Cars.com’s cargo measurements. If car seats are part of your daily routine, you can see how the Escalade scored in our Car Seat Check here.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Cadillac Escalade? \n\nAfter gaining the outlandish Escalade-V for 2023, Cadillac’s biggest SUV sees minor changes in standard equipment for 2024. Among other adjustments, GM’s Super Cruise hands-free driving-assist system is now standard on all but the base Luxury trim level. Escalade-V models get a 20th Anniversary V-Series Package with subtle cosmetic tweaks and an available Black Diamond Tricoat color.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Cadillac Escalade Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nHeated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nCurved organic light-emitting diode digital dashboard\nWireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity\nAKG Studio sound system\nNavigation system with augmented-reality capability \nWireless device charging\nAutomatic emergency braking\n360-degree camera system \n22-inch alloy wheels\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nSoft-closing doors \nAdaptive air suspension\nPanoramic moonroof\nVentilated and massaging front seats\nConsole refrigerator\nHead-up display\nRearview camera mirror\nDual-screen rear entertainment system\nSuper Cruise hands-free driving system\nAdaptive cruise control\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nReverse automatic emergency braking\nNight Vision system\nShould I Buy the 2024 Cadillac Escalade?\n\nThe Escalade offers acres of space and gobs of power, especially the outrageous Escalade-V model. Few SUVs serve up this much interior room and luxury, and the Escalade is absolutely brimming with tech and comfort features. Downsides include a steep asking price and poor fuel economy with its two available V-8 engines. Given its sheer size, the Escalade is easier to maneuver than you might imagine, but there’s no getting around the fact that this is a huge sport ute, so plan your parking spots accordingly.",

      "expert_review": "Is the 2025 Cadillac Escalade V a Good Luxury SUV?\n\nThe styling updates look good, and the new screens are impressive, but the 2025 Escalade takes a step back in terms of interior plastics and trim quality, which don’t keep pace with its ever-increasing price tag. \n\nHow Does the 2025 Cadillac Escalade V Compare to Other Luxury SUVs?\n\nThe Escalade V is loud and brash, making a scene wherever it goes, while its competitors tend to be more subdued, focused more on luxury trimmings than boisterousness. The Cadillac’s full-size space and immense power, however, can’t be had in any foreign-brand competitor.\n\nCadillac’s full-size Escalade luxury SUV has long been considered the ultimate American luxury vehicle. It has a serious following among many different demographics, and yes, while you’re as likely to see one cruising Rodeo Drive as you are to see one arriving as your Uber Black ride-share car, it still commands a premium price and sells in good numbers. \n\nRelated: All-Electric 2026 Cadillac Escalade IQL Follows in the (Longer) Footsteps of the ESV\n\nFor 2025, there’s a new Escalade sharing showroom space with the traditional gas-powered model: An all-electric behemoth called the Escalade IQ, which is even larger, more expensive and more powerful than the OG Escalade. That also meant it was time to update the gas version, so the traditional ‘Slade gets a refreshed look and an all-new interior, the latter of which is partially shared with the IQ to help spread costs around. But is the new, updated Escalade worthy of the kudos the last one received for its groundbreaking interior tech, legit luxury trimmings and available eye-popping V performance model? We spent a week with a new ‘25 Escalade V in and around the desert community of Palm Springs, Calif., hauling around a truckful of friends to find out. \n\nHow Much Does a 2025 Cadillac Escalade Cost?\n\nYou can have an Escalade in a number of configurations, including the regular Escalade and an extended-length Escalade ESV. Both are available with rear- or four-wheel drive in several trim levels, and there’s an all-wheel-drive “V” high-performance version at the top of the lineup. All prices below are for a standard-length RWD model (with the exception of the AWD Escalade V). Adding 4WD to the variants listed below ups the price by $3,000, and opting for the longer ESV version adds another $3,000. All prices include a $2,195 delivery fee:\n\nLuxury: $90,295\nPremium Luxury: $99,495\nPremium Luxury Platinum: $119,095\nSport: $100,095\nSport Platinum: $119,595\nV (AWD): $164,695\n\nLike most Cadillacs, the Escalade offers two styling paths for buyers: Luxury and Sport. Luxury comes with more blingy chrome trim, while Sport swaps the shiny chrome trim and bright wheels for glossy black adornments. Looks vary inside, as well, with the Luxury trims getting more shiny bits and the Sport getting racier carbon-oriented appliques. Cadillac’s Magnetic Ride Control suspension is standard on all models except the base Luxury trim, and all non-V models are powered by a 6.2-liter V-8 that makes 420 horsepower and 460 pounds-feet of torque, mated to a 10-speed automatic transmission.\n\nMy test vehicle, however, was off in its own category: The Escalade V is the top trim and features a supercharged 6.2-liter V-8 making 682 hp and 653 pounds-feet of torque. It also brings some modified styling, special exhaust, a genuine carbon-fiber-trimmed interior, a ton of standard equipment, and a price tag as massive as its power output; as tested, the Escalade V I drove stickered at $165,320. That’s a stunning price increase over the other trim levels — though a fully loaded 4WD Sport Platinum and its own performance package and upgrades nearly halves that gap, from around $45,000 to about $22,000. So is it worth it? And is the new Escalade’s screen-heavy, touch-sensitive interior a step in the right direction?\n\nRelated Video:\n\nNew Style Inside and Out\n\nOne element common to all 2025 Escalades is new styling inside and out, bringing the look of this big, gas-powered luxury SUV in line with Cadillac’s electric SUV lineup. On the outside, a new front end carries on the look of the “-iq” SUVs (Optiq, Lyriq, Vistiq and Escalade IQ). It’s a sleeker, more streamlined look than before, but it still incorporates the signature vertical light pipes that many people now associate with the Cadillac brand. Unlike an electric SUV, however, the gas-powered Escalade needs a proper grille to allow airflow to that big 6.2-liter engine, so you get mesh instead of a plastic panel full of dancing LEDs. The V blacks out the trim for a dark chrome effect that looks menacing; it worked very nicely with my test vehicle’s extra-cost Aegean Stone gray-green paint. The V rides on huge 24-inch wheels and tires, and there are some subtle “V” badges, as well, but the cosmetic differences between the V and the rest of the Escalade lineup aren’t huge. And that’s pretty much how Cadillac wants it; this is meant to be more of a sleeper performance model — until you fire up that engine, at which point sleep is not possible. Not for you, not for your neighbors, not for anyone nearby. More on that in a minute.\n\nIt’s Not How You Feel, It’s How You Look\n\nThe Escalade’s new interior is also a bit of a departure from the prior model’s cabin, sharing a number of parts and pieces with the electric Escalade IQ. It starts with the 55-inch door-to-door screen, which is actually three screens side-by-side under a single cover panel. The display in front of the driver is reconfigurable, but much of it is obscured by the Escalade’s round steering wheel — a curious decision, given the Lincoln Navigator and many other vehicles with big screens like this have gone with a flattened ovoid “squircle” wheel to allow for better screen visibility. GM has such steering wheels (there’s one in the Chevrolet Corvette), but the Escalade sticks with the round wheel. It limits the gee-whiz factor of the impressive digital display. \n\nNext to the gauge display is a center touchscreen running the latest Google Built-In operating system, for better or worse. At least it still incorporates Apple CarPlay — a departure from the electric Cadillacs, which GM has decided aren’t allowed to have it. It’s clear and easy to use, but the reliance on Google Built-In — which requires an active data connection to the cloud for all its functions to work — can be problematic if you live somewhere that doesn’t have solid cell data coverage. You won’t, for instance, be able to change the satellite radio station by voice command if you’re driving through Joshua Tree National Park; you’ll have to do it manually. I miss the old systems that did everything without the need for cloud computing. \n\nBelow the central touchscreen is a lower touchscreen that houses climate controls, as well as a host of options and functions, such as the Escalade’s optional automatic opening and closing doors. The climate controls might be the more frustrating function to have in this screen, as touch-sensitive climate controls never really work properly. The icons are at least big and mostly well defined, so it’s a step up from what companies like BMW are trying to do. Finally, on the far right side of the dash is a passenger screen that, when the vehicle is in motion, is not visible to the driver but clear to the front passenger. It features everything from a web browser to several ancillary controls.\n\nThe display is impressive, but Cadillac is in danger of falling into the same trap as European luxury brands, confusing screens and gadgets for proper luxury trimmings. While the screens and tech got upgraded for 2025, the Escalade’s interior materials quality took a step backward: Everything in the Escalade looks great but feels thin, hollow and cheap. Panels creak, and tapping on surfaces resonates below the panel. Nothing inside feels expensive, which is a problem for a vehicle costing $165,000. At least the seats are comfortable and decently spacious in every position. Their power-folding mechanism makes getting into the third row a breeze, enabling us to tote seven people around Palm Springs comfortably and with ease. \n\nWhat the Escalade V is not lacking: amenities. From the power-opening-and-closing doors to a refrigerated center console cooler to a 38-speaker AKG Studio Reference sound system, the Escalade V is absolutely packed with interesting and useful tech. There’s also a full-color head-up display, night vision camera and even augmented-reality displays when you use the Google-based navigation system. The powered doors feel heavy, but when you learn how to use them properly (just give the handle a squeeze and step back), they become second nature. Standard Super Cruise hands-free cruise control works as well in the Escalade V as it does everywhere else I’ve tried it. But while the V is loaded with useful goodies, its best feature is actually under the hood.\n\n‘All Ate Up With Motor’\n\nEvery other gas-powered Escalade comes with the aforementioned 6.2-liter V-8, but for the V, Cadillac has slapped a supercharger on it and tuned it to make huge power — and huge noise. Every time you start the V, everyone nearby will know it. Do it at a valet stand, and everyone waiting jumps. Do it at 5 a.m. to go to the gym, and your neighbors will hate you in short order. It’s loud all the time, with that basso profundo rumble permeating the cabin, echoing off buildings, and rattling around canyons — both desert and urban. But it’s not like you don’t know that going in; nobody buying the Escalade V is surprised that it makes a lot of noise — and a lot of speed. \n\nPush the “V” button on the steering wheel to put the SUV into V Mode, and all the various adjustable systems are turned up to their maximum setting. Stomp the accelerator, and the V rears up on its haunches and barrels forward like a charging rhino. It’s astonishingly quick for a vehicle as big as it is; Cadillac says it can go from 0-60 mph in 4.4 seconds, and its big Brembo high-performance front brakes help haul it down from speed just as easily. The regular Escalade is no slouch, but the extra speed and brute force of the V is truly intoxicating to use. Just be prepared for constant stares of annoyance from passersby when doing so. \n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2025 Cadillac Escalade IQ Review: Is Anyone Ready for an Electric Escalade?\nEscalade Escalated: 2025 Cadillac Escalade Price Climbs $5,700\n2025 Cadillac Escalade Goes All In on Dazzling Screens\n2025 Cadillac Escalade IQ Is Electric (Boogie Oogie Oogie)\nCadillac Escalade: Which Should You Buy, 2023 or 2024?\n\nThe rest of the Escalade experience is intact, including an astonishingly supple ride delivered by the adaptive air suspension working in concert with Magnetic Ride Control shocks. Nothing you roll over disturbs the comfort of passengers (who will already be a little on edge from the V’s instant acceleration and continuous rumble). Its handling is what you’d expect a huge, heavy three-row luxury SUV like this to deliver — floaty, tippy and not terribly communicative. But then this isn’t a canyon-carver, it’s a battleship meant to blast in a straight line. The MRC and adaptive air suspension help keep things as level as possible, but there’s no disguising all this mass if you really start driving aggressively. Perhaps don’t drive so aggressively and just enjoy all the power and drama instead.\n\nCarrying People and Stuff in Style\n\nUnlike some other luxury SUVs, the Escalade V is still all about being seen, making noise and announcing one’s arrival in grand fashion. Its size allows for easy, comfortable accommodation of seven or eight people (depending on seating configuration) — and by that I mean seven or eight adult-sized people; the third row is not just reserved for children. There’s also plenty of cargo room behind the third row and tons of space if you drop that seat. And if that’s not enough, there’s even more space available if you drop another $3K for an ESV. \n\nBut while the Escalade’s pricing is on par with imported luxury brand SUVs, its interior materials are slipping dangerously close to “not worth the money.” This is curious, because lesser Cadillac models — like the new Optiq EV SUV, which costs half as much as an Escalade — have higher-quality cabins with better materials. If this is the flagship SUV for the Cadillac brand, they’d better be careful not to slip any further down that material quality ladder. \n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "In the sage words of social satirist Julie Brown in the 1988 science-fiction cinematic masterpiece “Earth Girls Are Easy,” “I like ‘em big and stupid.” And when it comes to SUVs, well, they don’t come any more big ‘n’ stupid than what we have right here: the new 2023 Cadillac Escalade-V. We don’t know why it’s taken Cadillac this long to actually get a V performance version of the Escalade out the door, but they finally have — and you’d better enjoy it now, as it just might be the last new internal-combustion-powered Cadillac you ever see given Caddy’s stated strategy of going fully electric in the next few years. I guess they decided that if they’re going to start sunsetting their gas-powered offerings, why not go out with a bang?\n\nRelated: 2023 Cadillac Escalade-V: The New Boulevard Race Champ\n\nAnd it’s hard to top the kind of bang you get from this beast, powered as it is by a 682-horsepower, supercharged V-8 engine and swaddled with an ultra-posh cabin. I had several days with the Escalade-V in the urban wilds of Los Angeles motoring around the traffic-choked highways, but I also made sure to take it up into the beautiful canyon roads through Malibu out to the coast, where I could see just how capable this sports truck was at providing an entertaining driving experience. The answer? A resounding yes.\n\nYou Wouldn’t Know It to Look at It, But …\n\nThe V performance series is what Cadillac uses to designate their high-performance, track-capable models, ones that look only subtly more aggressive but which often possess massive power increases and tons of suspension technology meant to blow the doors off competitors (usually German) on roads and race courses. I’ve had my brain melted behind the wheel of a Cadillac CTS-V, been mightily impressed with the latest CT4-V and CT5-V Blackwings, and now I’ve experienced what Cadillac has wrought in their big daddy SUV, the Escalade-V.\n\nLooking at it, there’s not much to distinguish it as something special — it looks pretty much like an Escalade in the Sport Platinum trim, with big wheels, a slightly lower stance, and blacked-out and body-color trim instead of chrome. The only unique features seem to be the subtle V badging on the doors, and slightly different front and rear bumpers, all of which is easily overlooked. The Escalade-V is apparently meant to fly under the visual radar of passersby, and it does so successfully … until you put your foot down.\n\nOMG, That Noise\n\nNestled under the long hood of the Escalade-V is a hand-built, supercharged 6.2-liter V-8 engine that’s related to the one found in the CT5-V Blackwing sedan, though it features a larger supercharger. In the Escalade-V, it produces a whopping 682 hp and 653 pounds-feet of torque, a bit more than the 668 hp the CT5-V Blackwing makes but slightly less than the sedan’s 659 pounds-feet of torque. But what accompanies the Escalade-V’s power is “the roar” — the earth-shaking basso profundo bellow that the thing produces on startup (especially when it’s cold) that will make you leap out of your skin when you remote-start it in an airport parking garage; that’s good for a thousand laughs when the valet at the hotel starts it at a busy stand and makes everyone standing behind the beast jump like a bomb went off in the driveway. It’s a noise you just don’t expect from an SUV like this. Your neighbors will immediately begin phoning the local HOA the day after you bring it home. It’s big, stupid fun — and I love it.\n\nConsider that noise fair warning for what this massively powerful engine does for the Escalade, itself a portly boulevard cruiser that was never really meant to be a canyon-carving sports machine or a drag-strip warrior. According to Cadillac, this seven-seat truck-based SUV can rocket from 0-60 mph in less than 4.4 seconds, which is an incredible time for a vehicle this size. Push the button just ahead of the shifter for the configurable V-Mode and you can have all the vehicle settings at their maximum insanity, boosting response for throttle, suspension, shifting, exhaust — all of it. It transforms the Escalade-V from a sedate but rumbly luxury touring SUV into one that, while not exactly what you’d call athletic, is far more capable out on fast and twisty two-lane blacktop.\n\nAcceleration is fierce, as one might expect, but it comes on in a smooth rush — there’s no gut punch like you get in some electric vehicles, but it’s still a hang-on-for-dear-life experience for you and your passengers. Braking is also extremely strong thanks to six-piston Brembo front brakes that haul you down with firmness and alacrity, and they do so time and again despite how hard you’re mashing them before approaching a corner. Steering — which is normally numb and light, enabling you to pilot the Escalade through mall parking lots with ease — becomes much more solid and communicative when you push the V button; there’s actual feedback through the steering wheel of what the huge 22-inch wheels and tires are doing, and it’s genuinely enjoyable. You can chuck the big ‘Slade into a long, sweeping corner with aggressive verve, and while it does tend to push and understeer rather dramatically, stabbing the gas will help rotate it and keep it on course.\n\nIs it a sports car level of pure driving enjoyment? Of course not; it’s still an absolutely massive SUV that weighs more than 6,200 pounds (or 6,400 pounds if you opt for the longer ESV version). You still get thrown around in the huge, comfy seats, and the sheer mass of the Escalade cannot be totally hidden regardless of whatever magic the standard Magnetic Ride Control 4.0 and Air Ride adaptive suspension can muster. These systems do a remarkable job of letting the Escalade-V be both a softly riding, beautifully damped luxury SUV and a mostly flat corner carver with noticeably less body roll, but they can only do so much. Suffice it to say that if your commute includes twisty mountain or fast canyon roads between your manse in the hills and the Morton’s steakhouse in the city, an Escalade-V is a massively entertaining way to make that trip. You’ll still be pulling over to the shoulder to let faster motorists in proper sports cars and sportbikes past you, but you’ll be going sufficiently quick to curse the mouth-breathing tourists in front of you who refuse to do so.\n\nThe Art and Science Lives on Inside\n\nWhile the sporting capabilities and aural assault of the Escalade-V are half the equation, the other half of it comprises the opulent cabin that Cadillac has crafted. It’s easily the finest interior the brand has created, with excellent leather (in all three rows), beautiful “zebra wood” trim and comfort for occupants in every seating position. The 36-speaker AKG Studio Reference sound system is mind-blowing, and the absolutely enormous 38-inch curved organic light-emitting diode dash display has super-sharp visuals and reconfigurable controls.\n\nMy test vehicle’s cabin was done up in a gorgeous deep burgundy, a color not often seen anymore in vehicle interiors, and it looks just as good here as it has in Cadillacs of old. My only gripe: This is the Platinum-trim interior that’s available on lesser Escalades, and not much about it other than a couple of V badges is unique to the V. It’s a beautiful interior and a big reason the Escalade landed our Best Luxury Car of 2022 award, but considering the price premium of an Escalade-V over a loaded Escalade Sport Platinum, the interior needs something more than the fact that it’s just as lovely as other Escalades.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2021 Cadillac Escalade Review: Expensive, and Worth It\nCadillac Escalade: Which Should You Buy, 2021 or 2022?\n2023 Toyota Sequoia vs. 2022 Chevrolet Tahoe: Comparing the Interiors\n2023 Cadillac Escalade Specs and Reviews\nFind a 2023 Cadillac Escalade Near You\nIt Costs How Much?\n\nAh yes, this is where the painful bit starts — well, this and fuel economy, which I’ve avoided mentioning as it’s kind of irrelevant in a vehicle like this. You don’t buy an Escalade-V for its efficiency, and that’s good, because it doesn’t have any; my long weekend with the truck netted 11 mpg, which is abysmal but not unexpected (the Escalade-V is EPA-rated at 11/16/13 mpg city/highway/combined).\n\nStill, that’s not the truly stunning number. What is: $152,590, which is the Escalade-V’s starting price including destination and a required $1,500 option package for three years of OnStar connected services. That’s around a $40,000 premium over a Sport Platinum trim, which while not as fast or athletic, is visually nearly identical and has just as nice an interior. That 40 kilodollar addition for the supercharged V-8 engine, upgraded brakes, super-loud exhaust, and special tuning for the suspension and various other systems is indisputably hefty. The question is, has Cadillac crafted something special enough to warrant that price premium?\n\nTo fans of the Escalade who are already intending to spend over a hundred grand for a Sport Platinum, I’d say probably yes. If you’re shopping the Escalade-V against vehicles like the comparably priced Mercedes-AMG GLS63, BMW Alpina XB7 or Land Rover Range Rover Autobiography, it might be a tougher sell. The Escalade-V has far more interior room than any of these European competitors, but most are quicker and more athletic.\n\nThe Escalade-V is truly a high-performance SUV for people who need the extra space or might at some point tow a boat. If your family is a bit too big for one of the Euro luxe rocketships, the Escalade-V might just be a suitable option.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
