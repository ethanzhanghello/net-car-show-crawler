      "expert_review": "The all-new 2013 Cadillac XTS is a tip of the hat to the the smooth road-yacht Cadillacs of old that people made synonymous with big, easy, luxury. The XTS replaces the DTS and STS models and harkens back to the Cadillacs that enthralled consumers in the mid-20th century.\n\nThe 2013 Cadillac XTS is long and wide on the outside, roomy and comfortable on the inside and it struts its best stuff when cruising, particularly at speeds between 60 and 70 mph.\n\nThis full-size sedan with its V-6 engine is smooth and incredibly quiet on the road; it makes any driver feel safe and in control. It’s not youthful and nimble, but mature and leisurely. The XTS is sure to find a place in the market with buyers who are nostalgic for the big, easy luxury upon which Cadillac based much of its early reputation.\n\nThe 2013 XTS has a starting price of $44,925, including a $920 destination charge. It comes in four trim levels: Standard, Luxury, Premium and Platinum. I tested the Premium trim with available all-wheel drive and a fancy paint job. It cost $57,725.\n\nEXTERIOR\nAlthough the XTS represents a nod to the days of old, it’s not outdated or old-fashioned looking. The headlights and taillights are long and lean, giving both ends of the car a stately posture. The taillights play heavily to a sense of nostalgia because they resemble Cadillac tailfins from the past.\n\nIt’s a big car that is more than 16 feet long and 6 feet wide, which makes it longer than competitors such as the Audi A6 and the Mercedes-Benz E-Class. The front grille is defined with a stylish mesh and a large Cadillac emblem. Shiny 19-inch aluminum wheels with chrome inserts are standard, though 20-inch wheels are available. The top-level Platinum trim comes standard with an even blingier-looking front grille and polished aluminum 20-inch wheels.\n\nBecause it’s a five-seat sedan, it was easy for kids of nearly all sizes to get in and out of the XTS. There’s 18 cubic feet of cargo space in the trunk, which is near the top of what you can get without opting for a SUV or minivan. This trunk swallows all of your daily necessities plus lots more, and there’s a pass-through in case you ever have skis or other long items to transport.\n\nThe XTS has a 304-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 that’s matched to a six-speed automatic transmission. Front-wheel drive is standard; all-wheel drive is available, and it was the drivetrain I tested. The front-wheel-drive XTS gets an EPA-estimated 17/28 mpg city/highway. The all-wheel-drive version gets 17/26 mpg. Regular unleaded fuel is required.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Some\n\nINTERIOR\nWith standard features like a 14-speaker Bose stereo system, a heated steering wheel, heated and ventilated front seats, and heated outboard rear seats, the XTS proves that it’s a 21st-century Cadillac.\n\nThe new Cadillac User Experience multimedia system also signals the automaker’s modernity. Cadillac promises every 2013 XTS buyer an iPad so they can use the included CUE application to better familiarize themselves with the system. In my experience, people will need to refer to this app again and again and again. The CUE system has been loved by some and not-so-loved by others. I fall somewhere in between with a tendency toward the latter. The system was complicated and the voice and touch capacities were fickle.\n\nThe voice control system was like talking to my dear departed grandmother who couldn’t hear a thing. You know, you say “Directions to Nordstrom” and she says, “Huh? A detective? A storm?” or something even more off-base. Despite several attempts to use voice commands to control CUE, communication just doesn’t occur. I also found CUE’s center stack’s buttons — really just thin, polished aluminum bars — finicky. If I didn’t touch them in just the right way, they wouldn’t respond. However, you can also control CUE via steering-wheel controls, which worked well.\n\nPerhaps given more time to explore it and an iPad app to help me, I might have learned to enjoy CUE. It does include a remarkably clear 8-inch touch-screen that offers swipe and touch functionality much like that of an iPad or tablet. It’s also uncluttered until your fingers get close to the screen at which point more control options and icons appear on the screen as if by magic. The downside is that such a lucid screen also highlights grimy fingerprints really well.\n\nPerforated leather upholstery, front seats with thigh bolsters and an abundance of head- and legroom in both the front and rear seats create the luxurious comfort expected from a Cadillac. The XTS’ interior is roomy in both the first and second rows. There are a few clever storage cubbies including a compartment to the left of the steering wheel that’s perfect for a cellphone and wallet. There are only four cupholders, but for the demographic that’s going to consider this car, that’s plenty.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2013 Cadillac XTS received an overall safety rating of five stars out of five from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. It earned five stars in front and side crash tests and four stars in a rollover crash test. It hasn’t been crash-tested yet by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.\n\nThe XTS has standard front-wheel drive, four-wheel-disc antilock brakes, adaptive bi-xenon headlights, front and rear parking sensors, a backup camera, a blind spot warning system and 10 airbags, including seat-mounted side-impact airbags for the rear outboard passengers. An introductory subscription to OnStar is also standard.\n\nAll-wheel drive is optional. A lane departure warning system, rear cross-traffic alert and forward collision alert are in the optional Driver Awareness Package ($2,395). When these systems detect a precarious situation — it’s pretty sensitive — the driver’s seat vibrates noticeably to grab your attention. Though it’s startling at first, after a while I found myself veering out of my lane just to get the good vibrations.\n\nAs for the Latch anchors, there are two sets in the outboard seats and a single anchor in the middle. I’m of the mindset that Cadillac should have added a sixth anchor or kept off the fifth, but the extra anchor allows parents to install child-safety seats in a variety of positions using Latch anchors.\n\nThe anchors aren’t easy to access because of the stiff seat cushions. Furthermore, the top tether hooks are tough to use because of the rear window’s angle. Three child-safety seats won’t fit across the backseat, but rear-facing child-safety seats fit easily.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Cadillac XTS?\n\nThe five-seat Cadillac XTS full-size luxury sedan is offered with front- or all-wheel drive. The car received a mild refresh last year that brought updated styling, additional sound-deadening material for a quieter ride, and an updated version of the Cadillac User Experience multimedia system. A 304-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 engine is standard, and the V-Sport trim level uses a twin-turbo version that produces 410 hp. Both engines team with a six-speed automatic transmission. Competitors include the Lincoln Continental and Lexus ES.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2019 Cadillac XTS?\n\nAn upgraded wireless charging system is designed to charge devices faster.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Cadillac XTS Are Most Important?\n\nAll XTSs come standard with leather upholstery, dual-zone automatic climate control, an 8-inch touchscreen for Cadillac’s CUE multimedia system, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity, Bluetooth streaming audio and wireless device charging. Navigation is available, along with a Bose surround-sound stereo, 22-way power-adjustable front seats, heated and ventilated front seats, heated rear seats and a color head-up display.\n\nA 360-degree camera system is optional. Available active safety features include blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert, forward collision warning, forward and reverse automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning and lane-keeping assist.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Cadillac XTS?\n\nCadillac currently offers two full-size luxury sedans: the XTS and CT6. They’re similar in size and price, yet the CT6 is a bit bolder and more aggressive. The XTS is more of a traditional choice, but we like its roomy cabin, large trunk and the upscale interior materials on its high-end trims.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in November 2013 about the 2014 Cadillac XTS. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2015, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nWith its new twin-turbo V-6 engine, the 2014 Cadillac XTS Vsport boasts a compelling blend of performance and luxury that’s diminished by a too-firm ride.\n\nThe XTS is the largest car in Cadillac’s lineup. It’s also the only one based on a front-wheel-drive platform, though all-wheel drive is available. The biggest change for 2014 is the newly available 410-horsepower, twin-turbo V-6, but the car also gains more features, like rear entertainment and a self-parking system. To see the 2013 and 2014 versions compared, click here.\n\nPrimary competitors include the Acura RLX, Lincoln MKS and Volvo S80 (see them compared), but well-equipped XTS models also compete against cars from Audi, Infiniti and Lexus. The XTS starts at $45,525 including a $925 destination charge, but the sticker price of the all-wheel-drive XTS Vsport Platinum we tested was $70,020.\n\nHow It Drives\nA soft, cushy ride has defined Cadillac’s large cars for generations — until now. The XTS breaks from that tradition by letting you feel bumps and breaks in the road, even in the adjustable suspension’s normal mode. Magnetic Ride Control, GM’s adaptive suspension technology, is standard, and selecting the system’s Sport mode makes the ride even firmer. The Platinum trim level also comes with 20-inch wheels wrapped with P245/40R20 all-season tires. These low-profile tires likely amplify the firm ride; 19-inch wheels with slightly taller 45-series tires are standard.\n\nAfter experiencing both suspension modes, I wanted a more comfort-oriented normal mode — not as soft as Cadillacs past, but something that recognizes the XTS for what it is: a full-size sedan, not a sport sedan.\n\nThe firm suspension does a great job controlling body roll, however. I noticed some mild pitching, but that’s the only thing that reminds you the XTS is a large car.\n\nThe twin-turbo V-6 in Vsport models is delightful. The engine’s smooth, forceful acceleration transforms the XTS from a car that has decent power with its base V-6 to one with sports-car quickness.\n\nWe have our friend, Mr. Torque, to thank for this. The base V-6 makes 264 pounds-feet of torque at 5,200 rpm, while the twin-turbo V-6 produces 369 pounds-feet at just 1,900 rpm. Considerably more torque at considerably lower rpm equals a wider grin on your face. The XTS swiftly quickens the pace when you jab the gas pedal at highway speeds, and it squats down and lunges forward when you floor the pedal, letting out a refined roar.\n\nThe twin-turbo V-6 teams with a responsive six-speed automatic transmission. Though it made some lurching shifts in heavy rush-hour traffic, when the road is clear the transmission has a keen sense for what you want the car to do and quickly chooses the right gear. Automakers frequently tout their transmissions for having seven, eight and even nine speeds, but what really matters is how they perform in the real world, and the XTS’ six-speed automatic is exceptionally intuitive.\n\nChoosing the twin-turbo V-6 brings all-wheel drive, and this version of the XTS gets an EPA-estimated 16/24/19 mpg city/highway/combined. That’s not much less than all-wheel-drive versions with the base V-6 (17/26/20 mpg). Front-wheel-drive cars are the most efficient, with an EPA rating of 18/28/21 mpg.\n\nThe XTS has large, vented brake rotors and Brembo-brand front calipers. Pedal feel is consistent and natural to a full stop.\n\nInterior\nThe top-of-the-line Platinum interior is as good as anything from Audi, BMW or Lexus. The leather-wrapped and wood-trimmed cabin feels rich and elegant, enhanced by unique design cues like perforated dashboard trim and purple accent stitching. There’s no wind noise in the cabin, even at highway speeds, but you hear tire noise as the road surface changes.\n\nHeated and ventilated front bucket seats are optional. The seats provide firm support, and I felt fine after a two-hour drive. I’m 6-foot-1, but a shorter editor had a sore upper back after a 30-minute trip. You feel the individual cushions that make up the seat, kind of like a dentist’s chair.\n\nThe view out the rear window from the driver’s seat isn’t great. The trunk is pretty tall, and that prevents you from seeing what’s right behind the car. Large C-pillars limit side-to-side views when backing up. A backup camera is optional but necessary; it provides the low-angle view behind the car that’s missing. (Rear parking sensors are standard.)\n\nThere’s lots of backseat legroom; with the driver’s seat adjusted for me, I still had four or five inches between my knees and the back of the front seat. Headroom is decent and the side windows are large enough to ward off claustrophobia. The back door armrests are narrow, though.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nAll XTS trim levels come standard with Cadillac User Experience. CUE is a multimedia system that consists of an 8-inch touch-screen in the center of the dashboard and a touch-sensitive panel below it. The system has haptic feedback, too; the controls pulse when touched.\n\nThe CUE touch-screen is more responsive than the one paired with Ford’s MyFordTouch, and the haptic feedback makes it easier to know when you’ve changed one of the touch-sensitive panel’s controls. However, the system isn’t as fast as Chrysler’s Uconnect, which has an easy-to-understand touch-screen interface supplemented by physical knobs for stereo volume, fan speed and radio tuning, which beat touch-sensitive panels any day from an ease-of-use standpoint.\n\nThe touch-sensitive panel requires a good amount of pressure before it’ll change the cabin temperature, for instance. The optional rear-seat climate controls also have a touch-sensitive panel like in front — sort of a mini CUE — but without the haptic feedback. Interestingly, these are much more responsive than the main CUE system; just a slight tap changes the temperature or climate mode.\n\nCUE offers a number of different ways to bring portable media into the car, with USB connectivity, an SD card slot, an MP3 jack and Bluetooth streaming audio. Options include a navigation system, a color head-up display, a digital instrument panel with a 12.3-inch screen in place of the standard analog dials, and a dual-screen rear entertainment system that can play Blu-ray discs.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe trunk measures 18 cubic feet. Lifting the trunklid reveals a wide opening. While the trunk is deep, it’s not that tall. The trunklid is supported by arms that move within enclosed spaces at the sides of the cargo area, so you don’t have to worry about them inadvertently crushing your groceries. A power-operated trunklid isn’t offered.\n\nThe standard 60/40-split backseat folds nearly flat with the cargo floor to reveal a wide-but-not-tall opening between the trunk and cabin. The larger backrest section is heavy to lift. There’s also a lockable center pass-through, which is useful for carrying long items while preserving outboard rear seating.\n\nStorage areas include a small glove box, door pockets, a center console bin and a large cubby to the left of the steering wheel. There’s also a hidden storage area behind the center control panel; it opens when you touch its lower edge.\n\nSafety\nThe XTS has been recognized as a 2013 Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and received an overall score of five out of five stars from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for its crash-test performance.\n\nThe optional Driver Awareness Package includes lane departure warning, blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert, forward collision alert and Cadillac’s safety alert seat that warns the driver of any of the above collision hazards by vibrating different sections of the seat cushion. The optional Driver Assist Package features adaptive cruise control, automatic collision preparation, and front and rear automatic braking. Automatic high-beam headlights are also optional.\n\nFor a full list of safety features, check out the Features & Specs page. See how child-safety seats fit in the Car Seat Check.\n\nValue in Its Class\nEven at its most expensive, the XTS represents something of a value buy when compared with flagship full-size luxury sedans from Japan and Germany while still offering the kind of luxury accommodations and performance expected in that class. More moderately priced XTS versions from $50,000 to $60,000 come with many of the sedan’s defining elements, like CUE, as well as luxury features like heated front and rear seats, leather upholstery and wood trim.\n\nThere’s still room at the top of the Cadillac lineup for a traditional flagship luxury sedan. Until there’s a car like that, however, there’s enough variety in the XTS lineup for it to compete with a broad spectrum of luxury cars.\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "With its new twin-turbo V-6 engine, the 2014 Cadillac XTS Vsport boasts a compelling blend of performance and luxury that’s diminished by a too-firm ride.\n\nThe XTS is the largest car in Cadillac’s lineup. It’s also the only one based on a front-wheel-drive platform, though all-wheel drive is available. The biggest change for 2014 is the newly available 410-horsepower, twin-turbo V-6, but the car also gains more features, like rear entertainment and a self-parking system. To see the 2013 and 2014 versions compared, click here.\n\nPrimary competitors include the Acura RLX, Lincoln MKS and Volvo S80 (see them compared), but well-equipped XTS models also compete against cars from Audi, Infiniti and Lexus. The XTS starts at $45,525 including a $925 destination charge, but the sticker price of the all-wheel-drive XTS Vsport Platinum we tested was $70,020.\nHow It Drives\nA soft, cushy ride has defined Cadillac’s large cars for generations — until now. The XTS breaks from that tradition by letting you feel bumps and breaks in the road, even in the adjustable suspension’s normal mode. Magnetic Ride Control, GM’s adaptive suspension technology, is standard, and selecting the system’s Sport mode makes the ride even firmer. The Platinum trim level also comes with 20-inch wheels wrapped with P245/40R20 all-season tires. These low-profile tires likely amplify the firm ride; 19-inch wheels with slightly taller 45-series tires are standard.\n\nAfter experiencing both suspension modes, I wanted a more comfort-oriented normal mode — not as soft as Cadillacs past, but something that recognizes the XTS for what it is: a full-size sedan, not a sport sedan.\n\nThe firm suspension does a great job controlling body roll, however. I noticed some mild pitching, but that’s the only thing that reminds you the XTS is a large car.\n\nThe twin-turbo V-6 in Vsport models is delightful. The engine’s smooth, forceful acceleration transforms the XTS from a car that has decent power with its base V-6 to one with sports-car quickness.\n\nWe have our friend, Mr. Torque, to thank for this. The base V-6 makes 264 pounds-feet of torque at 5,200 rpm, while the twin-turbo V-6 produces 369 pounds-feet at just 1,900 rpm. Considerably more torque at considerably lower rpm equals a wider grin on your face. The XTS swiftly quickens the pace when you jab the gas pedal at highway speeds, and it squats down and lunges forward when you floor the pedal, letting out a refined roar.\n\nThe twin-turbo V-6 teams with a responsive six-speed automatic transmission. Though it made some lurching shifts in heavy rush-hour traffic, when the road is clear the transmission has a keen sense for what you want the car to do and quickly chooses the right gear. Automakers frequently tout their transmissions for having seven, eight and even nine speeds, but what really matters is how they perform in the real world, and the XTS’ six-speed automatic is exceptionally intuitive.\n\nChoosing the twin-turbo V-6 brings all-wheel drive, and this version of the XTS gets an EPA-estimated 16/24/19 mpg city/highway/combined. That’s not much less than all-wheel-drive versions with the base V-6 (17/26/20 mpg). Front-wheel-drive cars are the most efficient, with an EPA rating of 18/28/21 mpg. \n\nThe XTS has large, vented brake rotors and Brembo-brand front calipers. Pedal feel is consistent and natural to a full stop. Interior\nThe top-of-the-line Platinum interior is as good as anything from Audi, BMW or Lexus. The leather-wrapped and wood-trimmed cabin feels rich and elegant, enhanced by unique design cues like perforated dashboard trim and purple accent stitching. There’s no wind noise in the cabin, even at highway speeds, but you hear tire noise as the road surface changes.\n\nHeated and ventilated front bucket seats are optional. The seats provide firm support, and I felt fine after a two-hour drive. I’m 6-foot-1, but a shorter editor had a sore upper back after a 30-minute trip. You feel the individual cushions that make up the seat, kind of like a dentist’s chair.\n\nThe view out the rear window from the driver’s seat isn’t great. The trunk is pretty tall, and that prevents you from seeing what’s right behind the car. Large C-pillars limit side-to-side views when backing up. A backup camera is optional but necessary; it provides the low-angle view behind the car that’s missing. (Rear parking sensors are standard.)\n\nThere’s lots of backseat legroom; with the driver’s seat adjusted for me, I still had four or five inches between my knees and the back of the front seat. Headroom is decent and the side windows are large enough to ward off claustrophobia. The back door armrests are narrow, though. Ergonomics & Electronics\nAll XTS trim levels come standard with Cadillac User Experience. CUE is a multimedia system that consists of an 8-inch touch-screen in the center of the dashboard and a touch-sensitive panel below it. The system has haptic feedback, too; the controls pulse when touched.\n\nThe CUE touch-screen is more responsive than the one paired with Ford’s MyFordTouch, and the haptic feedback makes it easier to know when you’ve changed one of the touch-sensitive panel’s controls. However, the system isn’t as fast as Chrysler’s Uconnect, which has an easy-to-understand touch-screen interface supplemented by physical knobs for stereo volume, fan speed and radio tuning, which beat touch-sensitive panels any day from an ease-of-use standpoint.\n\nThe touch-sensitive panel requires a good amount of pressure before it’ll change the cabin temperature, for instance. The optional rear-seat climate controls also have a touch-sensitive panel like in front — sort of a mini CUE — but without the haptic feedback. Interestingly, these are much more responsive than the main CUE system; just a slight tap changes the temperature or climate mode.\n\nCUE offers a number of different ways to bring portable media into the car, with USB connectivity, an SD card slot, an MP3 jack and Bluetooth streaming audio. Options include a navigation system, a color head-up display, a digital instrument panel with a 12.3-inch screen in place of the standard analog dials, and a dual-screen rear entertainment system that can play Blu-ray discs.Cargo & Storage\nThe trunk measures 18 cubic feet. Lifting the trunklid reveals a wide opening. While the trunk is deep, it’s not that tall. The trunklid is supported by arms that move within enclosed spaces at the sides of the cargo area, so you don’t have to worry about them inadvertently crushing your groceries. A power-operated trunklid isn’t offered.\n\nThe standard 60/40-split backseat folds nearly flat with the cargo floor to reveal a wide-but-not-tall opening between the trunk and cabin. The larger backrest section is heavy to lift. There’s also a lockable center pass-through, which is useful for carrying long items while preserving outboard rear seating.\n\nStorage areas include a small glove box, door pockets, a center console bin and a large cubby to the left of the steering wheel. There’s also a hidden storage area behind the center control panel; it opens when you touch its lower edge.Safety\nThe XTS has been recognized as a 2013 Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and received an overall score of five out of five stars from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for its crash-test performance.\n\nThe optional Driver Awareness Package includes lane departure warning, blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert, forward collision alert and Cadillac’s safety alert seat that warns the driver of any of the above collision hazards by vibrating different sections of the seat cushion. The optional Driver Assist Package features adaptive cruise control, automatic collision preparation, and front and rear automatic braking. Automatic high-beam headlights are also optional.\n\nFor a full list of safety features, check out the Features & Specs page. See how child-safety seats fit in the Car Seat Check. Value in Its Class\nEven at its most expensive, the XTS represents something of a value buy when compared with flagship full-size luxury sedans from Japan and Germany while still offering the kind of luxury accommodations and performance expected in that class. More moderately priced XTS versions from $50,000 to $60,000 come with many of the sedan’s defining elements, like CUE, as well as luxury features like heated front and rear seats, leather upholstery and wood trim.\n\nThere’s still room at the top of the Cadillac lineup for a traditional flagship luxury sedan. Until there’s a car like that, however, there’s enough variety in the XTS lineup for it to compete with a broad spectrum of luxury cars.\n\nSend Mike an email",
