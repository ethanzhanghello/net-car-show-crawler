      "expert_review": "‘Crossover’ with attitude\n\nCadillac has enjoyed a roaring success in recent years, transformed from an aging luxury brand weighed down by padded roofs and a geriatric image to a happening collection of hip-hop Escalades and sporty CTS sedans.\n\nWith new styling that has been described as “knife edge,” Cadillac has carved out a unique niche that’s distinctly different from such competitors as Lexus and Mercedes-Benz.\n\nThe beefy Escalades have retained their hold as custom-wheeled status symbols beloved by urban youth. And CTS cars can be seen zooming around the racetrack at Bob Bondurant School of High Performance Driving in Chandler, which would never have happened with Grandpa’s DeVille.\n\nThe latest Caddy with an attitude is the SRX, a luxurious “crossover” vehicle that combines the attributes of a passenger car, minivan and SUV. What it is, really, is a tall station wagon built on the chassis of the sharp-handling CTS.\n\nGoing up against such crossovers as Lexus RX 330, Mercedes-Benz M Class and Chrysler Pacifica, SRX has the look and performance to uphold Cadillac’s new image. For affluent drivers who shy away from minivans, SRX provides the space without the bulk, as well as plenty of style.\n\nThe test car was powered by a powerful V-8, an option that trumps the mostly V-6-powered crossover field, as well as optional all-wheel drive.\n\nSRX lacks the mighty presence of Escalade, however, and seems destined to appeal more to suburban families than sports stars. Still, it should be another score for the turnaround king of luxury cars.",

      "expert_review": "I don’t know if Cadillac is satisfied with the sales of its SRX sport ute — the company moved 18,415 of them in the first 10 months of 2006, down more than 1,000 from the same period in 2005 — but I’ve always been surprised the SRX isn’t more popular. It’s one of my favorite luxury SUVs, and it has been since it hit the market in 2003 as an ’04 model.\n\nThe SRX is a true “crossover,” which is an SUV that is based on a car, not a truck. We have been struggling for a better term to describe these light-duty SUVs, which are closer to a station wagon than to a true truck-based SUV, such as the Cadillac Escalade. Crossover doesn’t mean much, but it’s all we have.\n\nWith a crossover, you can expect a carlike ride, and minimal off-road ability, and that certainly describes the SRX. Based on the same platform as the CTS sedan, the SRX is one of the most-comfortable, best-handling sport utes available at any price.\n\nThe test model had a 255-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 engine with a five-speed automatic transmission. Though all-wheel drive is an option, the test model was rear-wheel drive. The SRX is reasonably heavy, but the V-6 worked well enough with the transmission to make acceleration more than acceptable. Regular gas is fine with this engine, too.\n\nThe SRX also is offered with Cadillac’s Northstar, a 4.6-liter, 320-horsepower V-8 that comes with a new six-speed automatic transmission. It’s a great engine, but it costs an extra $6,205 — you get additional equipment with that, sure, but it’s a pretty big premium to pay. Base price on the test SRX was $37,110, and with shipping and some options, list price was $42,105.\n\nSome of those options were nice — heated seats, bigger tires and wheels, an enormous power sunroof — but the base-model SRX is nicely equipped, and at less than $38,000 with shipping, it’s a bargain: You get, after all, a power liftgate, rear parking assist, a Bose stereo with XM satellite radio; front, side and side-curtain air bags, stability control and leather upholstery — all features that often cost extra.\n\nOutside, the SRX looks pretty much as it did when it was introduced, but inside, the interior has been redesigned for 2007. Fine, but there was nothing wrong with the old interior — that’s something every Cadillac has been getting right for at least five years. Front seats were extremely comfortable, and the rear seats were fine, but taller passengers riding in back might wish for more legroom if the front passengers are tall, as well. There’s an optional third-row seat, but the test model didn’t have it. On the road, the SRX is exceptionally quiet, and the ride is smooth on even rough pavement. Handling is excellent for an SUV.\n\nIn October 2003, I wrote that the SRX, “for what it is, may be the best Cadillac in decades.” That still applies.",

      "expert_review": "Crossover SUVs are the hot ticket because they mix the best of both worlds. They blend the function of an SUV with the handling of a car in a package that is lighter and more fuel-efficient than larger truck-based SUVs.\n\nCadillac’s SRX is an excellent example of the concept. It can function as a luxury sedan one minute and an SUV the next. Such flexibility is appealing, particularly when it comes in such a well-designed package.\n\nThe SRX is derived from the unibody platform of the CTS sedan, but the wheelbase has been stretched to 116 inches. The creased edges, angular shape and vertical headlights reflect what has become the design vocabulary for the Cadillac brand. The SRX is one of the best-looking models in the brand.\n\nFor 2006, the SRX gets a standard power liftgate, reduced step-over for easier exiting and different color and trim combinations.\n\nPrices start at $36,990 for the V-6. All-wheel drive is a $1,900 option, and the test vehicle was so equipped. For most regions, all-wheel drive is worth the extra money because it adds safety and security in heavy rain and snow.\n\nAlthough the SRX can be ordered with a Northstar 4.6-liter V-8, the 3.6-liter aluminum V-6 is a more cost-effective alternative. It produces 255 horsepower and has variable intake and exhaust valve timing, electronic throttle control and a dual-stage intake manifold.\n\nThe V-6-powered SRX feels so accommodating because the engine’s power is spread across a wide range. It has strong low-speed response as well as good high-rpm power.\n\nThe five-speed automatic transmission downshifts automatically to help slow the vehicle when braking or descending a hill. The transmission can also be shifted manually when desired.\n\nInside, the SRX is comfortable and pleasant. The instrument panel is covered with a nubby black texture. The gauge package has white letters on a black background. Wood is used sparingly on the steering wheel, shift knob and door pulls.\n\nThe center stack, shaped to resemble a computer tower, looks better with new gauges, but conceptually it is rather dated. A new dash would be more than welcome.\n\nThe test car was equipped with a navigation system, XM satellite radio and optional Bose audio system. XM and Bose are a tough combination to top. Steering-wheel audio controls are great, especially the little thumb wheel for volume control.\n\nThe SRX has the kind of agility one expects to find in a midsize sedan. The tall roof doesn’t make it feel top-heavy or bulky in turns. The ride is compliant and the handling crisp. The wishbone-type suspension uses aluminum components to save weight and enhance responsiveness.\n\nThe DVD-based navigation system has a clever 3-D viewing option.\n\nOne interesting option is the Ultraview power sunroof, which is about twice as large as a standard sunroof. This huge opening lets back-seat passengers enjoy open-air motoring, too.\n\nThe split-folding second-row seats have tons of legroom and fold flat when you need to carry a large or long load. The tailgate is hinged at the top.\n\nThe optional power third seat is terrific even if legroom is tight. Cars without the third-row seat can have a cargo system integrated into the rear floor.\n\nThe crossover SRX shows just how versatile Cadillac can be.\n\nPrice\n\nThe base price of the test vehicle was $36,990. Options included the Bose premium audio system, third-row power seat, rear air conditioning, heavy-duty cooling system, navigation system and all-wheel drive. The sticker price was $42,990.\n\nWarranty\n\nFour years or 50,000 miles.\n\nEngine: 3.6-liter 255-hp V-6\n\nTransmission: automatic\n\nAll-wheel drive\n\nWheelbase: 116 inches\n\nCurb weight: 4,438 lbs.\n\nBase price: $36,990\n\nAs driven: $42,990\n\nMpg rating: 15 city, 22 hwy.\n\nAt A Glance\n\nPoint: The SRX combines luxury and practicality in a handsome package that drives like a car while having the room of an SUV. The interior is nicely appointed, the seats are comfortable, and the V-6 has more than enough power.\n\nCounterpoint: The computer tower shape of the instrument panel’s center stack looks a bit dated.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nCadillac launched the SRX midsize sport utility vehicle as an early 2004 model, available with a V-6 or V-8 under the hood. The 2008 model comes with an Adaptive Remote Start system, which enables drivers to start the engine, adjust the interior temperature and turn on defrosters from up to 200 feet away. Competitors include the Lexus RX 350, Acura MDX and Volvo XC90. The SRX got a new interior for 2007 and goes into 2008 with mostly minor changes.\n\nBridging the gap between luxury sedans and powerful SUVs, the SRX was Cadillac’s first crossover — a model that features the attributes of more than one vehicle class.\n\nBuilt on the same platform as Cadillac’s CTS sedan, the SRX promises a low center of gravity. The automaker says this improves ride and handling “without compromising [the] driver’s commanding view of the road.” The SRX can be equipped with either rear- or all-wheel drive.\n\nCadillac promotes the driving dynamics of the SRX. The automaker’s active suspension system, called Magnetic Ride Control, is optional. MRC applies electrical current to a coil in the damper’s piston, thus varying the viscosity of the fluid, which holds iron particles.\n\nExterior\nStyling features include a V-shaped grille and chiseled vertical taillamps. The SRX’s 116-inch wheelbase is 9 inches longer than the Lexus RX 350’s. The SRX is nearly 9 inches longer overall, too. Weight distribution approaches 50/50, front to rear.\n\nFor 2008, buyers can add the SRX Sport appearance package, which features front and rear sport additions, a new body-colored grille with V-series mesh backing, 4-inch dual polished exhaust tips, a six-speed automatic with Drive Control shift, all-wheel drive and a limited-slip differential.\n\nSeventeen-inch wheels are standard on V-6 models, while the SRX V-8 comes with 18-inchers. Twenty-inch wheels are optional.\n\nInterior\nCadillac substantially remodeled the SRX’s interior for 2007. It features a curvy center stack and conventional slatted air vents.\n\nSeven occupants can fit inside when an optional, powered, flip-folding third-row seat is installed. Without it, seating capacity is five. All passengers sit higher in the SRX than in a luxury sedan but lower than occupants in a typical SUV.\n\nAn optional UltraView roof offers 5.6 square feet of open space above the first and second rows. The available UltraView Plus setup adds a fixed glass roof over the third row, complete with a power sunshade.\n\nMaximum cargo volume totals 69.5 cubic feet versus the Lexus RX 350’s nearly 85 cubic feet. Side storage bins are installed in the cargo area. GM’s OnStar communication system is standard, as is a Bose stereo system. Available features include a navigation system, upgraded Bose 5.1 digital audio, XM Satellite Radio and a backseat DVD entertainment system.\n\nUnder the Hood\nBoth a V-6 and V-8 engine are available, and each features variable valve timing. The 3.6-liter V-6 produces 255 horsepower and 254 pounds-feet of torque. Cadillac’s 4.6-liter Northstar V-8 generates 320 hp and 315 pounds-feet of torque. The V-6 teams with a five-speed automatic transmission. The V-8 gets a six-speed automatic. Both transmissions employ a manual-shift provision.\n\nCadillac’s all-wheel-drive system incorporates a limited-slip differential and an electronic traction control system to shift torque from the wheels that are slipping to those that have grip.\n\nSafety\nAn electronic stability system and four-channel antilock brakes with brake assist are standard. Side-impact airbags mounted in the backrests of the front seats provide torso protection, while side curtain airbags protect the heads of outboard occupants in the first two rows.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nCadillac launched the SRX midsize sport utility vehicle as an early 2004 model, available with a V-6 or V-8 under the hood. The 2009 model comes with an Adaptive Remote Start system, which enables drivers to start the engine, adjust the interior temperature and turn on defrosters from up to 200 feet away. Competitors include the Lexus RX 350, Acura MDX and Volvo XC90. The SRX can hold up to seven people with its optional third-row seat.\n\nNew for 2009\nThere are no significant changes to the 2009 Cadillac SRX.\n\nExterior\nThe SRX is longer than the RX 350, MDX and XC90 by several inches. Weight distribution approaches 50/50, front to rear. Buyers can add the SRX Sport appearance package, which features front and rear sport additions, a body-colored grille with V-series mesh backing, 4-inch dual polished exhaust tips, a six-speed automatic with Drive Control shift, all-wheel drive and a limited-slip differential.\n\nV-shaped grille\nSeventeen-inch wheels standard on V-6 models\nChiseled vertical taillamps\nSRX V-8 outfitted with 18-inch wheels\nTwenty-inch wheels optional\n\nInterior\nMaximum cargo volume totals 69.5 cubic feet, versus nearly 85 cubic feet for the RX 350, 83.5 cubic feet for the MDX and 85.1 cubic feet for the XC90. Seven occupants can fit inside when an optional, powered, flip-folding third row is installed. Without it, seating capacity is five. All passengers sit higher in the SRX than in a luxury sedan but lower than occupants in a typical SUV.\n\nCurvy center stack\nConventional slatted air vents\nOptional UltraView roof offers 5.6 square feet of open space above the first and second rows\nSide storage bins in the cargo area\nGM’s OnStar communication system standard\nStandard Bose stereo system\nAvailable navigation system, upgraded Bose 5.1 digital audio, XM Satellite Radio and a backseat DVD entertainment system\n\nUnder the Hood\nBoth a V-6 and V-8 engine are available, and each features variable valve timing. The 3.6-liter V-6 produces 255 horsepower and 254 pounds-feet of torque. Cadillac’s 4.6-liter Northstar V-8 generates 320 hp and 315 pounds-feet of torque. The V-6 teams with a five-speed automatic transmission. The V-8 gets a six-speed automatic.\n\nAll-wheel drive employs limited-slip differential on Sport models\nElectronic stability system standard\n\nSafety\nStandard safety equipment includes:\n\nElectronic stability system\nFour-channel antilock brakes with brake assist\nSide-impact airbags\nSide curtain airbags",

      "expert_review": "DETROIT — The second time around was better. The whining noises that marred a previous drive through the Allegheny Mountains were gone. The weight that once seemed more albatross than potentially protective benefit was mitigated by an increase in power — 308 horsepower in the 2012 Cadillac SRX wagon driven for this column, up from 265 horsepower in last year’s SRX V-6.\n\nIt’s a cliche in automobile manufacturing to say that the only good horsepower is more horsepower. But more, in this case, was a definite benefit in moving something as weighty as the 2012 Cadillac SRX, at 5,467 pounds, across mountain roads.\n\nIt’s funny how life works.\n\nA couple of years ago, when I drove here from my home in Northern Virginia, I was more worried about fuel economy than I was about power. Money was tight. Gasoline prices were high. On paper, a Cadillac with a 265-horsepower V-6 engine seemed like a good compromise — enough power and comfort for a long road trip, with minimum fuel costs.\n\nIt turned out to be a delusional drag fest — a fancy, sharp-edged, totally luxurious Cadillac wagon with the heart and soul of a Hyundai Elantra economy sedan. Driving it was like spending a night in a castle without light, heat or food.\n\nLeaving that first SRX parked in Detroit was both blessing and epiphany. I was glad to be done with it, and I was hoisted on my own intellectual petard.\n\nI have long been among those automotive journalists who have argued for more fuel economy and less horsepower. Worldwide, the automobile industry has been trying to deal with the same argument.\n\nBut it’s a difficult issue. More fuel economy sounds good when you are driving short distances, when you don’t have much to carry or when you have seemingly forever to get where you are going. But it’s a sop of a concern when what you really need is power.\n\nI discovered as much on my latest drive to Detroit in the 2012 Cadillac SRX. The extra 43 horsepower in the new engine seems to have made all the difference in the world — no whining, no straining, just a smooth, steady ride up and down hills and around curves, the kind of vehicle performance that takes the stress out of long-distance driving.\n\nThanks to advances in drivetrain technology — engine and transmission — fuel consumption in the 2012 Cadillac SRX (the performance model) was not much different from that in the 2011 model — about 17 miles per gallon in the city and 24 on the highway.\n\nThe bottom line is that the 2012 Cadillac SRX wagon feels like a Cadillac, but with a bit of an environmental twist. There is now enough power there to make it a serious contender with the Audi Q5 and other luxury crossover-utility wagons. There certainly are enough amenities. It could use a diesel engine, or perhaps some form of hybridization, to further increase its now-marginal fuel economy.\n\nBut after being pulled through the Alleghenies with zest and gusto, and not worrying about how the new SRX would handle steep inclines, I’m willing to live with the so-so fuel economy a bit longer.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in March 2014 about the 2014 Cadillac SRX. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2015, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe Cadillac SRX isn’t the newest luxury crossover on the market, but what it lacks in freshness it makes up for with impressive technology, a comfortable ride and a well-appointed interior.\n\nCadillac’s compact luxury crossover is now one of the oldest models in the brand’s lineup, but the SRX also continues to be one of the more popular ones. Completely redesigned for the 2010 model year to better compete with segment leaders like the Lexus RX and Acura MDX, it’s due for a makeover in the not-too-distant future, though Cadillac has done a good job keeping it up to date with the latest electronics and features. Barely anything changes between the 2013 and 2014 models; you can compare the two here. I tested a fully loaded, top-of-the-line SRX all-wheel drive Premium model for a week, putting the luxury crossover through rigorous suburban duties (groceries, airport shuttling) to see if a model nearly five years into its current generation is still a contender.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe SRX’s shape hasn’t changed since its 2010-model-year redesign, and it’s an attractive figure. Cadillac’s overall styling is still a development of the “art and science” theme that started with the original CTS sedan in 2002. The SRX hasn’t received the latest version of this theme, but it still looks like it belongs next to updated models like the latest CTS and ATS sedans. The large chrome grille up front and upright-towel-dispenser side flourishes will need an update soon, yet the vestigial tail-fin taillights are still cool and a fun way for Cadillac to recall its heritage while presenting a fully modern design.\n\nFor 2014, the only styling change is the late availability of 18-inch chrome-plated wheels on the Luxury Collection trim, plus three new paint colors: Graphite Metallic, Terra Mocha Metallic and Sapphire Blue Metallic. My tester came with 20-inch painted aluminum wheels, part of the Premium trim level, which filled out the wheel wells quite nicely.\n\nHow It Drives\nOnly one powertrain is available for the SRX these days: the 3.6-liter V-6 engine that GM uses in dozens of its cars across its brands. In the SRX, it makes 308 horsepower and is mated to a six-speed automatic transmission, powering the front wheels on base trims or all of them with the optional all-wheel-drive system. The engine provides plenty of power for all conditions; whether moving out from a stoplight, aggressively merging onto a highway or attempting a passing maneuver, the SRX never lacked oomph. The six-speed transmission is smooth and quiet, and it’s geared to allow for a quiet and comfortable level of noise at highway cruising speeds. That noise level is helped by an active noise cancellation program that counters road noise via the audio system’s speakers. You never hear it working, but the quiet is noticeable.\n\nHandling is fairly numb and inoffensive, with considerable boost from the electric power steering keeping things predictable, if not exactly sporting. Given the competition, however, and the SRX’s mission in life, it should tackle suburban duties and family-shuttling without any issue, coming across as confident and easy to drive at any speed. The brakes are a little soft, lacking the immediate grab one expects in a luxury vehicle. This, combined with soft and ponderous body control, makes the vehicle seem rather heavy — which at more than 4,400 pounds with all-wheel drive, it is. (That’s anywhere from 100 to 300 pounds heavier than its competitors).\n\nThat weight issue shows in the SRX’s fuel economy numbers, which are below those of major competitors. The all-wheel-drive SRX is rated 16/23/18 mpg city/highway/combined — not the greatest performance of the group. My week of driving netted about 20 mpg in what turned out to be heavier-than-normal highway use. By comparison, the Lexus RX 350 all-wheel drive is rated 18/24/20 mpg with its six-speed transmission and 18/26/21 mpg with its optional eight-speed automatic in the F-Sport model, while the Acura MDX all-wheel drive nets an estimated 18/27/21 mpg with a six-speed. The MDX does, however, require premium fuel, while the Caddy and Lexus make do with regular unleaded. The front-wheel-drive SRX comes in at 17/24/19 mpg.\n\nInterior\nThe Cadillac is quite nice inside, as this was one of the first models in the brand’s lineup to receive significant attention to detail, electronic upgrades and high-quality materials. Despite being a few years old, the SRX still looks up to date, featuring modern shapes and high-quality leather on most surfaces. Most controls are located on touch-sensitive panels in the center console that go dark when the car is switched off. It’s a clean look; nobody would accuse the SRX interior of being too busy or ostentatious. It’s luxurious and interesting in a way that many competitors are not. The Cadillac User Experience (CUE) multimedia system, standard on the SRX, is front and center, though our opinion of it remains mixed. It’s one of the better systems for ease of use and function, but the voice command can be finicky and inconsistent in terms of operational speed.\n\nComfort level is high in the SRX, with big seats up front and in the second row, yet legroom for the rear passengers isn’t as much as one might hope. This is one of the smaller luxury SUVs on the market — strictly a two-row setup with seating for five only — but dimensionally it offers competitive room for those five occupants. The front seats are the preferred place to be, with low windowsills and a low hood making for good outward visibility. Thanks to the fairly tall roofline, headroom is plentiful, front or rear, and it wasn’t diminished by the optional moonroof in my test car.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe controls and gauges are modern and look great, but they’re something of a mixed bag to operate. While CUE works very well most of the time, it sometimes lags and gets confused on voice commands or when asked to do things immediately after startup. Likewise, the controls for everything from climate control to seat heaters are also flat, blank-plastic, touch-sensitive panels. While they work reliably, they require you to remove your eyes from the road in order to confirm that the function has been selected. Most touch-sensitive controls provide no tactile feedback, but an essential quality of a luxury vehicle is that it feel luxurious; the tactile operation of its buttons and switches is part of that feel. With touch-sensitive panels, that luxurious feel is absent. Cadillac tries to make up for it with a vibrating console that “bumps” when you touch a control, but the sensation just doesn’t work the same. Touch-sensitive controls don’t work for Lincoln, and they don’t work here, either.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe SRX may offer competitive passenger room, but it comes up a bit short on cargo space versus its competition. With the seats up, the SRX features 29.8 cubic feet of cargo space, climbing to a more respectable 61.1 cubic feet with the rear seats folded. By comparison, the more spacious Lexus RX has 40.0 cubic feet of room behind the second row of seats, or 80.3 with its second row folded. The Acura MDX manages to squeeze a third row into the cargo space, but when it’s folded offers up 38.4 cubic feet behind the second row. That number grows to 68.4 cubic feet with everything laid down. My test vehicle featured a track-and-groove cargo management system, which included tubular metal dividers that could be set at different positions to secure cargo. Its usefulness is questionable, however, and I found myself folding it out of the way or removing it entirely most of the time.\n\nSafety\nThe SRX received a five-star overall safety rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, and it scored a rating of good in most Insurance Institute for Highway Safety crash tests. See all of the SRX’s safety equipment here.\n\nCadillac has packed quite a lot of its newest safety technology into the SRX, including optional radar-based adaptive cruise control with automatic front and rear braking; that latter addition is a less common system that prevents the car from backing into something at low speeds. Also available are a backup camera, blind spot and cross-traffic alert, and Cadillac’s exclusive Safety Alert Seat, which rumbles the driver’s seat instead of sounding a chime whenever a warning is needed.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe SRX is Cadillac’s only crossover-style SUV, meant to go head-to-head with similar vehicles from Lexus, Acura and Infiniti. It covers a wide range of pricing, as well, starting at $38,430, including destination charge, for a base front-wheel-drive model. Three higher trim levels offer increasing levels of equipment (labeled Luxury, Performance and Premium). My tester was an all-wheel-drive Premium model, which rings up at $51,880; add in a Blu-ray-compatible rear-seat entertainment system for $1,595, the Driver Assist Package (with adaptive cruise control and automatic braking) for $2,395, and 20-inch polished wheels for $595, and you get an as-tested price of $56,465. That’s a lot of money for a smallish five-seater, regardless of brand, but at this price the SRX does come equipped with some very impressive technology. Configure one how you’d like it here.\n\nThe market is tough, however, with the perennial best-selling Lexus RX 350 considered to be the SRX’s nemesis. An RX 350 F-Sport all-wheel drive starts at $48,360 but doesn’t include things like navigation, a blind spot monitor or a premium sound system. Its optional rear-seat entertainment system is also twice as pricey as the Cadillac’s. It does have an advantage in fuel economy, however, thanks to the F-Sport’s eight-speed transmission. Tagging all the boxes on an RX 350 brings it up to $54,775, but it still doesn’t feature some of the SRX’s more advanced safety technologies. Acura’s MDX is another worthy competitor. It was recently redesigned and features three rows of seats at a starting price of $43,185 for a base front-wheel-drive version, climbing to $57,400 for a fully loaded, all-wheel-drive Advance trim level. Acura has no options at that level, however, preferring to bundle options into trim levels. It, too, features better fuel economy than the SRX and almost as much technology, including a follow function for the automatic distance-keeping cruise control that can brake and accelerate the car in stop-and-go traffic. If you want to stick with domestic brands, Lincoln’s MKX crossover is built with similar intentions. It starts at $39,470 for a front-wheel-drive base model and climbs to more than $54,500 if you add big wheels, all-wheel drive, technology packages and more. It features Ford’s advanced MyLincoln Touch system, which has improved in recent years but still comes with flat plastic touch panels in the center console. Compare the four competitors for yourself here.\n\nThe SRX is likely due for a full redesign in the near future, but Cadillac has kept the current version relevant and competitive thanks to some technology updates. Here’s hoping the next one loses the touch-sensitive controls, gains a bit of fuel economy and keeps its upscale looks.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "The Cadillac SRX isn’t the newest luxury crossover on the market, but what it lacks in freshness it makes up for with impressive technology, a comfortable ride and a well-appointed interior.\n\n \n\nCadillac’s compact luxury crossover is now one of the oldest models in the brand’s lineup, but the SRX also continues to be one of the more popular ones. Completely redesigned for the 2010 model year to better compete with segment leaders like the Lexus RX and Acura MDX, it’s due for a makeover in the not-too-distant future, though Cadillac has done a good job keeping it up to date with the latest electronics and features. Barely anything changes between the 2013 and 2014 models; you can compare the two here. I tested a fully loaded, top-of-the-line SRX all-wheel drive Premium model for a week, putting the luxury crossover through rigorous suburban duties (groceries, airport shuttling) to see if a model nearly five years into its current generation is still a contender.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe Cadillac SRX’s shape hasn’t changed since its 2010-model-year redesign, and it’s an attractive figure. Cadillac’s overall styling is still a development of the “art and science” theme that started with the original CTS sedan in 2002. The SRX hasn’t received the latest version of this theme, but it still looks like it belongs next to updated models like the latest CTS and ATS sedans. The large chrome grille up front and upright-towel-dispenser side flourishes will need an update soon, yet the vestigial tail-fin taillights are still cool and a fun way for Cadillac to recall its heritage while presenting a fully modern design.\n\n \n\nFor 2014, the only styling change is the late availability of 18-inch chrome-plated wheels on the Luxury Collection trim, plus three new paint colors: Graphite Metallic, Terra Mocha Metallic and Sapphire Blue Metallic. My tester came with 20-inch painted aluminum wheels, part of the Premium trim level, which filled out the wheel wells quite nicely.\n\nHow It Drives\nOnly one powertrain is available for the SRX these days: the 3.6-liter V-6 engine that GM uses in dozens of its cars across its brands. In the Cadillac SRX, it makes 308 horsepower and is mated to a six-speed automatic transmission, powering the front wheels on base trims or all of them with the optional all-wheel-drive system. The engine provides plenty of power for all conditions; whether moving out from a stoplight, aggressively merging onto a highway or attempting a passing maneuver, the SRX never lacked oomph. The six-speed transmission is smooth and quiet, and it’s geared to allow for a quiet and comfortable level of noise at highway cruising speeds. That noise level is helped by an active noise cancellation program that counters road noise via the audio system’s speakers. You never hear it working, but the quiet is noticeable.\n\n \n\nHandling is fairly numb and inoffensive, with considerable boost from the electric power steering keeping things predictable, if not exactly sporting. Given the competition, however, and the SRX’s mission in life, it should tackle suburban duties and family-shuttling without any issue, coming across as confident and easy to drive at any speed. The brakes are a little soft, lacking the immediate grab one expects in a luxury vehicle. This, combined with soft and ponderous body control, makes the vehicle seem rather heavy – which at more than 4,400 pounds with AWD, it is. (That’s anywhere from 100 to 300 pounds heavier than its competitors). \n\n \n\nThat weight issue shows in the Cadillac SRX’s fuel economy numbers, which are below those of major competitors. The AWD SRX is rated 16/23/18 mpg city/highway/combined — not the greatest performance of the group. My week of driving netted about 20 mpg in what turned out to be heavier-than-normal highway use. By comparison, the Lexus RX 350 AWD is rated 18/24/20 mpg with its six-speed transmission and 18/26/21 mpg with its optional eight-speed automatic in the F-Sport model, while the Acura MDX AWD nets an estimated 18/27/21 mpg with a six-speed. The MDX does, however, require premium fuel, while the Caddy and Lexus make do with regular unleaded. The front-wheel-drive SRX comes in at 17/24/19 mpg.\n\nInterior\nThe Cadillac is quite nice inside, as this was one of the first models in the brand’s lineup to receive significant attention to detail, electronic upgrades and high-quality materials. Despite being a few years old, the Cadillac SRX still looks up to date, featuring modern shapes and high-quality leather on most surfaces, including leather seats. Most controls are located on touch-sensitive panels in the center console that go dark when the car is switched off. It’s a clean look; nobody would accuse the SRX interior of being too busy or ostentatious. It’s luxurious and interesting in a way that many competitors are not. The Cadillac User Experience (CUE) multimedia system, standard on the SRX, is front and center, though our opinion of it remains mixed. It’s one of the better systems for ease of use and function, but the voice command can be finicky and inconsistent in terms of operational speed.\n\n \n\nComfort level is high in the Cadillac SRX, with big seats up front and in the second row, yet legroom for the rear passengers isn’t as much as one might hope. This is one of the smaller luxury SUVs on the market — strictly a two-row setup with seating for five only — but dimensionally it offers competitive room for those five occupants. The front seats are the preferred place to be, with low windowsills and a low hood making for good outward visibility. Thanks to the fairly tall roofline, headroom is plentiful, front or rear, and it wasn’t diminished by the optional sunroof in my test car.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe controls and gauges are modern and look great, but they’re something of a mixed bag to operate. While CUE works very well most of the time, it sometimes lags and gets confused on voice commands or when asked to do things immediately after startup. Likewise, the controls for everything from climate control to seat heaters are also flat, blank-plastic, touch-sensitive panels. While they work reliably, they require you to remove your eyes from the road in order to confirm that the function has been selected. Most touch-sensitive controls provide no tactile feedback, but an essential quality of a luxury vehicle is that it feel luxurious; the tactile operation of its buttons and switches is part of that feel. With touch-sensitive panels, that luxurious feel is absent. Cadillac tries to make up for it with a vibrating console that “bumps” when you touch a control, but the sensation just doesn’t work the same. Touch-sensitive controls don’t work for Lincoln, and they don’t work here, either.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe SRX may offer competitive passenger room, but it comes up a bit short on cargo space versus its competition. With the seats up, the SRX features 29.8 cubic feet of cargo space, climbing to a more respectable 61.1 cubic feet with the rear seats folded. By comparison, the more spacious Lexus RX has 40.0 cubic feet of room behind the second row of seats, or 80.3 with its second row folded. The Acura MDX manages to squeeze a third row into the cargo space, but when it’s folded offers up 38.4 cubic feet behind the second row. That number grows to 68.4 cubic feet with everything laid down. My test vehicle featured a track-and-groove cargo management system, which included tubular metal dividers that could be set at different positions to secure cargo. Its usefulness is questionable, however, and I found myself folding it out of the way or removing it entirely most of the time.\n\nSafety\nThe SRX received a five-star overall safety rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, and it scored a rating of good in most Insurance Institute for Highway Safety crash tests. See all of the SRX’s safety equipment here.\n\n \n\nCadillac has packed quite a lot of its newest safety technology into the SRX, including optional radar-based adaptive cruise control with automatic front and rear braking; that latter addition is a less common system that prevents the car from backing into something at low speeds. Also available are a backup camera, blind spot and cross-traffic alert, and Cadillac’s exclusive Safety Alert Seat, which rumbles the driver’s seat instead of sounding a chime whenever a warning is needed.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe SRX is Cadillac’s only crossover-style SUV, meant to go head-to-head with similar vehicles from Lexus, Acura and Infiniti. It covers a wide range of pricing, as well, starting at $38,430, including destination charge, for a base front-wheel-drive model. Three higher trim levels offer increasing levels of equipment (labeled Luxury, Performance and Premium). My tester was an all-wheel-drive Premium model, which rings up at $51,880; add in a Blu-ray-compatible rear-seat entertainment system for $1,595, the Driver Assist Package (with adaptive cruise control and automatic braking) for $2,395, and 20-inch polished wheels for $595, and you get an as-tested price of $56,465. That’s a lot of money for a smallish five-seater, regardless of brand, but at this price the SRX does come equipped with some very impressive technology. Configure one how you’d like it here.\n\n \n\nThe market is tough, however, with the perennial best-selling Lexus RX 350 considered to be the SRX’s body-type nemesis. An RX 350 F-Sport all-wheel drive starts at $48,360 but doesn’t include things like navigation, a blind spot monitor or a premium sound system. Its optional rear-seat entertainment system is also twice as pricey as the Cadillac’s. It does have an advantage in fuel economy, however, thanks to the F-Sport’s eight-speed transmission. Tagging all the boxes on an RX 350 brings it up to $54,775, but it still doesn’t feature some of the SRX’s more advanced safety technologies. Acura’s MDX is another worthy competitor. It was recently redesigned and features three rows of seats at a starting price of $43,185 for a base front-wheel-drive version, climbing to $57,400 for a fully loaded, all-wheel-drive Advance trim level. Acura has no options at that level, however, preferring to bundle options into trim levels. It, too, features better fuel economy than the SRX and almost as much technology, including a follow function for the automatic distance-keeping cruise control that can brake and accelerate the car in stop-and-go traffic. If you want to stick with domestic brands, Lincoln’s MKX crossover is built with similar intentions. It starts at $39,470 for a front-wheel-drive base model and climbs to more than $54,500 if you add big wheels, all-wheel drive, technology packages and more. It features Ford’s advanced MyLincoln Touch system, which has improved in recent years but still comes with flat plastic touch panels in the center console. Compare the four competitors for yourself here.\n\nThe Cadillac SRX is likely due for a full redesign in the near future, but Cadillac has kept the current version relevant and competitive thanks to some technology updates. Here’s hoping the next one loses the touch-sensitive controls, gains a bit of fuel economy and keeps its upscale looks.\n\n \n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "The 2013 Cadillac SRX is one of those rare crossover SUV vehicles that feels like a positive addition to my family life, making my daily journey just a bit more comfortable with every corner we take.\n\nThe Cadillac SRX has a few changes for 2013, most notably (in my book) some active safety features, along with a slight price increase to reflect those changes. See the 2013 and 2012 models side by side here.\n\nThe five-seat 2013 Cadillac SRX comes in base, Luxury Collection, Performance Collection and Premium Collection trim levels. See them all here. The base has front-wheel drive, while the others offer a choice of front- or all-wheel drive (AWD). I drove the top-of-the-line all-wheel-drive SRX Premium.\n\nIf you’re in the market for a small luxury crossover, you may also want to look at the Lexus RX, the Audi Q5 and the BMW X3.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe SRX’s exterior styling was a bit of a mixed bag for my family. While I tend to prefer sleeker, smoother-looking cars, at least the sharp angles of the Cadillac SRX stand out and look unique on the road. I appreciate driving a vehicle that looks like something, rather than a beige, bland blob on wheels.\n\nMy husband, however, mused that while Cadillac’s distinctive sharp lines look modern today, they may start to date its vehicles in a few years’ time. Style is obviously subjective, so you’ll have to decide for yourself.\n\nThe SRX’s low step-in height made it quite easy for all three of my daughters (ages 8, 10 and 12) to clamber in and out of the car without the grave risk of tumbling out in front of their buddies in the carpool lane or tearing their super-cool new tie-dyed tights.\n\nFAMILY-FRIENDLY FEATURES\nWhile the Cadillac SRX has definitely focused on safety, drivability and edgy angular design, it also includes many practical family-friendly features, along with a couple of blatant oversights.\n\nThere are two-tier, in-door storage bins in all four doors, providing plenty of space to store family “junk.” There are also netted pockets on the backs of both the driver and passenger seats, and a fold-down center armrest in the backseat that includes cupholders and a covered storage bin to keep the kids organized.\n\nThe armrest storage bin is sized perfectly to stash two sets of the Cadillac SRX’s wireless bluetooth headphones and gaming-inspired remote control, both of which have been newly redesigned. They come with the optional entertainment system and Blu-ray player. My kids instantly gravitated toward the “super cool” remote that was easy to hold and operate. They were quickly able to navigate their way through the system — without help from me — while remaining securely buckled.\n\nOur family also really enjoyed the large available panoramic glass roof, which allowed us to enjoy some “virtual” top-down motoring in the winter and some stargazing at night.\n\nThe Cadillac SRX features 36.3 inches of backseat legroom, just slightly less than the Lexus RX and the BMW X3, both of which have 36.8 inches of legroom. The Audi Q5 has 37.4 inches. While sliding rear seats aren’t common in this category (oddly enough, they’re more common in lower-cost crossovers like the Chevrolet Equinox), Cadillac should have taken the initiative to put them in. I kept reaching down to try to slide the seats back and give the kids some much-needed legroom.\n\nCargo space in the SRX also falls on the shorter end of the spectrum compared with other small luxury crossovers. The SRX has 61.1 cubic feet of maximum cargo capacity (with the rear seats folded). The Q5 has 57.3 cubic feet, the X3 has 63.3 and the RX takes the cargo cake with 80.3 cubic feet. See these models compared side by side with the SRX here.\n\nThe power liftgate — standard on the Luxury, Performance and Premium collections — was much appreciated by me and my husband. None of our kids could reach the button to close it, as it’s located on the bottom edge of the raised gate, out of reach even for our 12-year-old. While it drove the kids crazy, in hindsight I prefer to operate this feature myself anyhow, keeping the kids away from any head-bumping potential.\n\nUp front, as both a driver and a passenger I appreciated the Cadillac SRX’s luxurious fit and finish, but I loathed the front cupholders. They were sized so that a standard tall Starbucks cup fit with the lid flush up against the top of the cupholder. In order to remove my cup, I had to lift my hot latte precariously by the lid alone, then try to grab the cup quickly before the lid popped off, spilling its contents over the entire center console.\n\nCadillac’s new CUE — Cadillac User Experience — controls and touch-screen were novel and seemed cool at first, but I got over them pretty quickly. The smooth, piano-black surface on the console readily shows fingerprints, and the white print and icons were already beginning to wear off on the most used areas. The smooth surface of the panel and the large touch-screen give you haptic feedback when you tap the buttons, which essentially means they sort of thump when you touch them. I think I’d prefer some old-school physical buttons.\n\nThe driver’s leather seat (power-adjustable in eight ways on all trims and heated on upper ones), tilt and telescoping steering wheel (heated on upper trims), and adjustable pedals on the upper trim levels managed to create a perfect fit both for me, at 5-feet, 3-inches, and for my husband, who is nearly a full foot taller. That’s a tall order that the SRX stretched to fit seamlessly.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nBEHIND THE WHEEL\nFrom a driver’s standpoint, the all-wheel-drive (AWD) Cadillac SRX handles much more nimbly than a stereotypical family-hauler. On dry roads, its 306-horsepower, 3.6-liter V6 engine paired to a 6-speed auto transmission was fun to drive, with ample power and very little body roll on the topsy-turvy roads in my neighborhood. The SRX had a very drivable blend of comfort and V6 performance, and with its active noise-canceling technology proved to be an easy daily driver regardless of how many hours I spent chauffeuring my family around.\n\nOur other editors noted a mushy feel to the brake pedal, but this wasn’t something that stood out for me. I did feel ever so slightly disconnected from the road when driving during a severe Colorado snowstorm, but that’s compared with my personal AWD sedan that has a very low center of gravity.\n\nThe 2013 SRX gets an EPA-estimated 17/24 mpg city/highway with front-wheel drive and 16/23 mpg with AWD. The combined city/highway ratings are 19 and 18 mpg, respectively. That’s not great for this class: With two-wheel drive, the RX 350 and Mercedes-Benz GLK-Class are rated 21 mpg combined, the Q5 gets up to 23 mpg combined and the X3 gets 24 mpg. On the upside, the SRX can drink either regular gasoline or E85 ethanol blend. Most luxury SUVs in this class require premium gas.\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2013 Cadillac SRX is an Insurance Institute for Highway Safety Top Safety Pick, having received the organization’s top rating of Good in front-, side- and rear-impact tests, as well as a roof-strength test. The SRX received an overall rating of five out of five stars in crash tests performed by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nAs is required on all new models starting with the 2012 model year, the SRX has standard antilock brakes, electronic stability control and traction control. The SRX has standard dual-stage driver and passenger front airbags, side-impact airbags for all four outboard positions and side curtain airbags that extend from the front to the rear passengers.\n\nSafety upgrades in the 2013 Cadillac SRX are numerous — something I’m always aware of as a parent. Cadillac introduced the Driver Awareness and Drive Assist technology packages with Safety Alert Seats in the SRX this year.\n\nThe Safety Alert Seat’s vibrating seat has got to be my new favorite feature of all time. It saved my family from a rear collision during a shopping trip. We were reversing out of a parking space while singing loudly to the included satellite radio when the SRX’s cross-path detection system “saw” a vehicle speeding through the parking lot to the rear and side of my own vehicle. The Safety Alert Seat jolted a little vibration on the left driver-side of my seat, letting me know there was possible danger coming from the left. I felt the vibration, applied the brakes and checked over my shoulder, only to discover the small sedan zooming past that would have hit me had I not stopped.\n\nThe optional Safety Alert Seat jolts to alert you of potential cross-traffic front collisions, as well, and the automatic front and rear braking can intervene to completely stop the car to help avoid a collision should the driver not react and brake fast enough.\n\nI was disappointed, however, that the seat vibration was not connected to the Cadillac SRX’s available blind spot warning system.\n\nThe outboard seat belt buckles were on stable bases and easy for the kids to use. The center belt buckle was floppy and more difficult, but we used that seat only occasionally. For families installing child-safety seats with Latch, the lower anchors in the two outboard seats are not buried too deeply, but there’s not much clearance around each of the anchors, which may cause accessibility issues for some types of child safety seats. Because the SRX’s backseat didn’t change for 2013, our 2012 Car Seat Check applies to the current model as well.\n\nSee all the standard safety features listed here.\n\nSend Kristin an email",

      "expert_review": "When the 2010 Cadillac SRX arrived in my driveway for a test drive, I was preparing for a trip north with my family. Talk about perfect timing! If I’d had the option to pick any crossover for our road trip, the SRX would have been my choice. It’s packed with luxurious appointments for the front and backseat passengers, including a rear entertainment system. That’s a beautiful sight for any parent psyching themselves up for a three-hour ride with the family.\n\nThis crossover, with its sharp exterior and lush interior, has amazing cargo space, which is a must on any long trip with the family. It held our cooler, suitcases and beach equipment with ease.\n\nIn the driver’s seat, I enjoyed an elevated view and great forward visibility. Of course, I also enjoyed the SRX’s turbocharged V-6, which  allowed me to keep pace with all the other cars rushing north for some R & R. I liked the SRX’s agility and quick-to-respond braking, which were gained without taking obvious or drastic weight reduction measures from the crossover. All the doors were solid and hefty, with no tinny “ding” when closed. Instead, each offered an assuring “thud” with every entrance and exit.\n\nMy loaded test car, a SRX Turbo Premium, will set car shoppers back $53,980. The base model starts at $33,830, so a lower price point does exist.\n\nEXTERIOR\n\nRedesigned for 2010, the SRX caught my eye right away. It’s sharp-looking. Literally. The body comes to a point both in the front and back. This car looks so good and represents GM’s attempt to grab the attention of younger buyers and more aggressive drivers. That said, my dad, who’s in his 50s, liked the SRX’s looks as much as I did.\n\nThe SRX sits just high enough off the ground to give the driver a great view of the road. That same stance, however, caused problems for little ones trying to get in and out of their second-row seats. The second-row’s doors didn’t open wide enough for my kids (or me when I tried it), and the step-in height was significant enough that my boys had to climb onto the floor and then climb up into their seats. Between the small door openings and the limited floor space, this was a tough maneuver for them.\n\nFront-row passengers have a much easier time getting in and out of the crossover since the doors and openings are larger.\n\nSpace isn’t an issue in the huge cargo area. A power liftgate with programmable height positioning, which allows the liftgate to open to a preprogrammed height, makes life with luggage and/or groceries simple.\n\nMy test car, the Turbo Premium with all-wheel drive, is the top-of-line trim. It boasts a 300-horsepower, turbocharged 2.8-liter V-6, and yes, it was quick. Despite the spec sheet saying regular gasoline would do the trick in the five-seater, the sticker on the fuel door requested premium. I obliged … begrudgingly. The SRX gets an EPA-estimated 15/22 mpg city/highway. During my week test driving it, I averaged just over 20 mpgs.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great \nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nINTERIOR\n\nIn true Cadillac style, the SRX had every standard amenity I could dream up: heated and cooled front seats, navigation, rearview camera, rear entertainment system, XM Satellite Radio, auto everything, and front and rear parking sensors to keep me from hitting anything ever. It felt like feature overload and made me think I’d need a college-level course to understand all I could do with this car.\n\nI’ll give it to the SRX’s interior designers though, who managed to package all of this technology in an appealing way. With touches of genuine wood trim on the door, gearshift, center stack and steering wheel, I couldn’t help but be reminded of a country club lounge with mahogany paneling. Even the legroom in the front row reminded me of a lounge, with plenty of room to stretch out. The only thing that threw off my country club image was the amazing panoramic sunroof, which let in a ton of light and was anything but stodgy.\n\nWhile the legroom in the front was ample, it wasn’t so great in the second row. But thanks to the rear entertainment system with dual screens tucked into the front seats’ seatbacks, my kids had no complaints once we were buckled in and rolling. The kids also liked that the backseat had its own air-conditioning controls, so they could keep the temperature just right for them. In the fold-down armrest, the kids had easy access to two cupholders and a storage cubby that could hold snacks and small toys or the available wireless headphones for the entertainment system. A bottleholder can be found in each door.\n\nIn the cargo area, there’s a hidden storage well beneath the cargo floor that’s surprisingly spacious. It’d easily hold the kids’ soccer gear, an overnight bag or two, or maybe even a smaller stroller.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore\n\nSAFETY\n\nThe Cadillac SRX has been named a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. To earn the safety honor, a car must achieve the highest score of Good in front, side-impact, rear and rollover crash tests. It also must have standard stability control, which the 2010 SRX does.\n\nIn addition to stability control, the SRX has standard four-wheel-disc antilock brakes with brake assist, traction control, front and rear parking sensors, a backup camera and six airbags, including side-impact airbags for the front row and side curtains for both rows. A one-year OnStar subscription with Turn-by-Turn Navigation is standard. All-wheel drive is optional.\n\nI especially appreciated all of the parking sensors. I like these little helpers because the parking lot at my sons’ elementary school gets so chaotic at times that it’s scary.\n\nWith two kids in booster seats, I found myself relying on the SRX’s light-up display in the instrument cluster that let me know when all of my rear passengers were buckled. With a quick glance, I could tell if my gaggle was ready to go. My boys’ booster seats fit well in the SRX. However, it could be difficult to fit a rear-facing convertible or infant-safety seat in the second row because of the legroom constraints. A forward-facing convertible should fit without any problems. The lower Latch anchors are buried under the seat cushions, but aren’t too hard to get at.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2010 Cadillac SRX here.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in November 2009 about the 2010 Cadillac SRX. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2011, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nSmaller and less expensive than its predecessor, Cadillac’s redesigned SRX moves squarely into the entry-luxury crossover segment — a corner of the market that luxury carmakers are fast descending upon. The SRX is certainly worth a look, particularly if you’re partial to its styling. In a lot of ways in which competitors go the distance, however, Cadillac merely makes the grade. These days, I’m not sure that cuts it.\n\nA five-seater, the SRX is available with front-wheel drive in base, Luxury, Performance and Premium trim levels; click here to compare it with the 2009 SRX. All-wheel drive is optional on all but the base trim. A normally aspirated 3.0-liter V-6 is standard, with a turbocharged 2.8-liter V-6 available next year in all-wheel-drive Performance and Premium editions. We tested an all-wheel-drive, 3.0-liter SRX Performance.\n\nSleeker, Smaller\nThe new SRX shares the current, second-generation Cadillac CTS sedan’s windswept style and friendlier face, just as the outgoing SRX emulated the sharp creases and upright angles of the first-generation CTS.\n\nIn an industry where redesigns typically add weight and size, Cadillac made the new SRX significantly smaller. It’s slightly wider than before, but it’s length drops 4.7 inches and it’s 2.1 inches shorter. Gone are options like a third-row seat and a V-8 engine, moving the SRX out of the territory occupied by the BMW X5 and Volvo XC90.\n\nThe Inside\nLike the second-generation CTS that introduced this era of Cadillac interiors, the SRX’s cabin is logically arrayed and a handsome bit of work. The controls have decent quality, and the gauges offer a quick read, aided by an LCD screen that displays digital mph or other information. Get the optional navigation system, and it rises out of the dashboard, using theatrics similar to those of the CTS nav screen. It’s a user-friendly setup, with decent graphics, a touch-screen interface and plenty of shortcut buttons.\n\nI’m less enthusiastic about the cabin materials. Genuine wood trim and upholstery-stitched dashboard panels add an upscale touch, but the frosted silver plastic around the steering wheel and center controls drag the quality down — especially when a number of competitors gird their cabins with real aluminum.\n\nThe front seats are supportive and comfortable, with good adjustment range for drivers of varying sizes. However, some may find that the SRX’s low roofline hurts the view through the windshield, and a combination of factors — narrowing back-door windows, tiny rear-quarter windows and large C-pillars — make for a hefty blind spot.\n\nThe backseat has adequate headroom and legroom, but I found the bottom cushions to be on the short side; the seat sat too low for my 5-foot-11-inch frame to get adequate thigh support. The seats fold down for 61.2 cubic feet of maximum cargo volume. That’s down 8.3 cubic feet versus last year, but it’s competitive for this price range.\n\nCargo Room Compared\n \tBase price\tBehind 2nd row (cu. ft.)\tBehind 1st row (cu. ft.)\nVolvo XC60\t$32,395\t30.8\t67.4\nAcura RDX\t$32,520\t27.8\t60.6\nCadillac SRX\t$33,330\t29.2\t61.2\nInfiniti EX35\t$33,800\t18.6\t47.4\nMercedes-Benz GLK350\t$34,600\t23.3\t54.7\nLand Rover LR2\t$35,500*\t26.7\t58.9\nLexus RX 350\t$37,250\t40.0\t80.3\nAudi Q5\t$37,350*\t29.1\t57.3\nLincoln MKX\t$38,345\t32.3\t68.6\nBMW X3\t$38,750*\t30.0\t71.0\n*Denotes models with standard AWD. Others have 2WD standard.\nSource: Automaker data\n\nGoing & Stopping\nDon’t let its 265-horsepower rating fool you: The base V-6 left me wanting. Displacing 3.0 liters, it’s in the same direct-injection family as the 3.6-liter V-6 that adeptly moves several GM products, from the Cadillac CTS to the Chevy Camaro. Alas, I’m less enthralled with this sibling. Here, like in other GM cars that use it, the 3.0-liter lacks the power to propel you with much authority. Our all-wheel-drive SRX felt modestly powered, and the six-speed automatic’s hesitance to downshift quickly didn’t help. At least there’s no accelerator lag in normal conditions; the V-6 GMC Terrain we recently drove uses the same drivetrain, and it had a creeping case of lag.\n\nSticking with front-wheel drive shaves 163 pounds off the SRX’s curb weight, which may prove enough to improve acceleration. What’s more likely to hasten on-ramp sprints is the turbocharged V-6. Once we drive that, I’ll add my impressions in this space. By the numbers, it looks promising — a modest 35 more hp, but, more important, another 72 pounds-feet of torque.\n\nThat should be a welcome addition. The Infiniti EX35 leaps from stoplights, and the BMW X3, Mercedes GLK, Audi Q5 and turbo Volvo XC60 aren’t far behind. Anyone stepping up from a four-cylinder crossover will think the 3.0-liter SRX moves swiftly enough, but drive the competition before making up your mind. Like the lukewarm Land Rover LR2, the SRX can’t beat merging semitrailers as well as some of its competitors can.\n\nThere’s a bit of redemption in fuel costs: At an EPA-rated 18/25 mpg city/highway with front-wheel drive and 17/23 mpg with all-wheel drive, the 3.0-liter SRX ranks midpack, but it runs fine on regular fuel, which is something few in this class can boast. Most competitors recommend premium; the GLK and X3 require it.\n\nEPA Gas Mileage (Combined City/Highway, MPG)\n \tAWD\t2WD\tFuel usage\nLexus RX 350\t20\t21\tPremium (recommended)\nAudi Q5\t20\t—\tPremium (recommended)\nBMW X3\t20\t—\tPremium (required)\nAcura RDX\t19\t21\tPremium (recommended)\nCadillac SRX (3.0L)\t19\t21\tRegular\nLincoln MKX\t19\t20\tRegular\nInfiniti EX35\t19\t19\tPremium (recommended)\nVolvo XC60\t18\t21\tRegular\nMercedes GLK350\t18\t18\tPremium (required)\nLand Rover LR2\t17\t—\tPremium (recommended)\nSource: EPA and automaker data\n\nAlthough final EPA estimates are pending for the turbocharged SRX, Cadillac estimates it will get 15/21 mpg; it comes standard with all-wheel drive. That’s disappointing — made more so because the turbo recommends premium fuel.\n\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes are standard, but the brake pedal feels mushy and trucklike, making it difficult to smooth out stops. At 3,500 pounds, maximum towing capacity is down versus the outgoing SRX’s 4,250-pound capacity, but it’s competitive for this class.\n\nNoise, Ride & Handling\nRoad and wind noise are low, but you’ll hear more adjacent traffic than I’d expect in a luxury crossover. The Lincoln MKX and GLK, to name a couple competitors, are superior in this regard.\n\nWith the 20-inch wheels on Performance and Premium trim levels, the SRX rides on the firmer side. All-wheel-drive Performance and Premium trims, including our test car, get a sport-tuned adaptive suspension. It soaks up stretches of uneven pavement well enough, but major disruptions — expansion joints, potholes — make for a lot of noise and movement. The RDX has similar characteristics, and the X3 and EX35 are firmer still. Other competitors, particularly the LR2 and MKX, ride smoother.\n\nThe front-wheel-drive SRX adopts softer suspension tuning — albeit with a fixed rather than adaptive setup. The base and Luxury SRX could be cushier still, thanks to their normal suspension tuning and 18-inch wheels with higher-series tires. If ride comfort is paramount, be sure to sample all three setups.\n\nThe steering wheel turns with light effort, but its sloppy turn-in precision doesn’t encourage spirited cornering. Body roll, at least, seems contained. No matter the configuration, though, the SRX’s 40.3-foot turning circle will have you making a lot of three- and four-point turns. It’s one of the widest in this group.\n\nSafety & Features\nIn front-, side- and rear-impact tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the SRX earned the top score of Good. It hasn’t been subjected to IIHS’ roof-crush tests, so it’s not eligible for the organization’s 2010 Top Safety Pick status. Of this group, the XC60 is the only contender to earn that title.\n\nStandard safety features on the SRX include six airbags, antilock brakes and an electronic stability system. Click here to see the full list.\n\nThe base SRX starts at $33,330 and includes vinyl upholstery — or leatherette, as it’s often marketed — plus a Bose CD stereo with an MP3 jack, dual-zone automatic climate control and a power driver’s seat. Move up the chain, and you can get a power passenger seat, a USB/iPod-compatible stereo with surround-sound technology, a navigation system, a panoramic moonroof, a third climate zone for rear passengers, heated rear seats, and heated and ventilated front seats.\n\nBase trims come only with front-wheel drive. All-wheel drive runs an extra $2,495 on the Luxury trim and $3,645 on Luxury and Premium trims. The sport-tuned adaptive suspension, included on all-wheel-drive Luxury and Premium models, accounts for the $1,150 difference. On all-wheel-drive Luxury and Premium models, the turbo V-6 adds $3,820.\n\nLoad up an all-wheel-drive, turbocharged SRX Premium, and the sticker runs just shy of $55,000.\n\nSRX in the Market\nCompared with its competitors, there are few attributes that make the SRX stand out. Its driving experience is unexceptional, in terms of both excitement and refinement. Interior quality is worlds beyond what GM used to send to the plate, but you still won’t revel in the cabin’s luxury or marvel at its utility.\n\nIf the box office were full of snoozers, I might recommend — reluctantly — a two-and-a-half-star sequel. But this season, the class is brimming with hits. The SRX will charm its share of shoppers, but I’m not sure Cadillac has the makings of a blockbuster.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",
