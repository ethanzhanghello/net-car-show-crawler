      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nOnly one version of Cadillac’s Seville sedan is available in the 2004 model year, and that one will be discontinued in December 2003. Cadillac halted production of the STS (Seville Touring Sedan) in May 2003, leaving only the lower-priced SLS (Seville Luxury Sedan) edition. The Seville is disappearing to make way for the company’s new STS performance sedan, which is based on Sigma architecture; it will go into production in the summer of 2004. Used for the first time in 1956, the Seville nameplate will be retired completely.\n\nNothing has changed for the final Seville SLS, which earned a freshening in 2003. The Seville is still loaded with technical features, including GM’s StabiliTrak electronic stability and OnStar communication systems, rain-sensing wipers and side-impact airbags. An Ultrasonic Rear Parking Assist system warns of obstacles to the rear while parking. XM Satellite Radio and a navigation system are optional.\n\nExterior\nFront-wheel-drive Sevilles have served as Cadillac’s primary export models due in part to their moderate size. Sevilles are 201 inches long overall, which is 6 inches shorter than the Cadillac DeVille. Unlike the rounded appearance of the DeVille, the Seville has retained a more angular profile. The Seville is less than 56 inches tall and rides a 112.2-inch wheelbase.\n\nInterior\nAll Sevilles accommodate five people. Front bucket seats with 10-way power adjustment and power-operated lumbar support are standard. A power tilt/telescoping steering wheel is among the Seville’s convenience features. Standard equipment includes leather upholstery, a leather-wrapped steering wheel with radio and climate controls, heated front and rear seats, and a cassette/CD player.\n\nA navigation system with touchscreen controls and a 5-inch color display screen in the dashboard is optional. GM’s OnStar communication system is standard, and two premium services are available. As a safety feature, Web-browsing and e-mail capabilities do not function unless the car is stopped.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe 4.6-liter Northstar V-8 engine in the SLS produces 275 horsepower and 300 pounds-feet of torque. It drives a four-speed-automatic transmission. The engine will run on regular fuel, but Cadillac recommends the use of premium gasoline for the best performance and fuel economy.\n\nSafety\nThe Seville has side-impact airbags for the front seats, antilock brakes and traction control. StabiliTrak is also standard.\n\nDriving Impressions\nSevilles have long been considered the sportiest-handling Cadillacs; they deliver a satisfying highway experience with impressive control. Performance also is a bonus. Even with the lower-powered SLS engine, the Seville driver needs to merely tap the throttle to unleash vigorous responses that are aided by a smooth-shifting automatic transmission. Sevilles are loaded with technological extras that don’t diminish the car’s basic attributes.",

      "expert_review": "It seems only fitting that Cadillac Motor Car Division bring an international automobile to an international automobile race. So it is no great surprise that Cadillac’s STS model has shown up as a support vehicle for the division’s participation in this year’s Indianapolis 500-Mile Race.\n\nSTS stands for Seville Touring Sedan, a four-door that has impressed even the most jaded of foreign-car devotees.\n\nAn aerodynamically styled automobile that is a complete departure from Sevilles of the past, the car can blend into the scenery of the highway or speedway.\n\nCadillac doesn’t make race cars per se. And the STS isn’t one. It is representative of the luxury image afforded the Cadillac nameplate virtually since its beginning, but there is an added flair to this car that is a happy marriage between performance and comfort.\n\nThe sedan, which was named 1992 Car of the Year by three major automotive magazines, is designed not only to offer an abundance of features to luxury-car buyers, but also to appeal to a broad range of that market.\n\n“The input we’re getting,” said Dave Watts, new-car sales manager for Lockhart Cadillac, “is we can’t keep them in stock. That’s a pretty good testimonial for the car.”\n\nThe STS that Cadillac’s Bill O’Neill had at the Speedway was its own car, even though it has the same overall dimensions as the division’s standard Seville model.\n\nSome key differences\n\nThe most obvious decorative difference was the Indianapolis 500-Mile Race logos on the body. In addition, the car sported subtle exterior changes.\n\nUp front, a body- colored grille replaced the chrome grille found on the standard model. The traditional “wreath and crest” emblem has been redesigned in a pewter color, and moved from the hood to the center of the grille.\n\nOther exterior changes include a specific front fascia that is body-colored and contains integral fog lamps along with a wide, slotted air intake opening. Chrome moldings have been replaced with black moldings along all window areas.\n\nSpecific STS body-colored rocker panel moldings extend up to the midway point on the door, and continue to the rear into a body-color rear fascia. The taillights are a wraparound assembly with a wide export-style license plate pocket in the center.\n\nThe rear deck lid has a full-length center-mounted stop light that carries the STS emblem.\n\nIt all results in a pretty racy effect, especially when applied to the body’s vanilla-white paint scheme.\n\nCar handles well\n\nAs good as the car looks, if it doesn’t go and doesn’t handle, all the appearance features in the world aren’t going to make it a good automobile. But the designers of the STS did their homework, and the car is a top piece of machinery in both quarters.\n\n“We’re seeing younger luxury-car buyers that never have been in a Cadillac,” said Dave Moll, new-car manager for Tutwiler Cadillac-Peugeot. “And that’s due in part to the way it handles and performs.\n\n“These younger professionals have been i mport buyers, and after they have been in the car they can’t say enough good about it.”\n\nEngine upgraded\n\nEngine and drive train consist of a 4.9-liter V-8 and a 4T60-E electronic four-speed automatic transmission which are shared basically with the standard Seville. However, the STS has structural differences from the Seville as well as a retuned chassis and modifications to the drive train.\n\nTo enhance acceleration, the STS has been given a 3.33-to-1 (the higher the number the lower the gear) final-drive ratio, vs. a 2.97-to-1 ratio for the Seville. In addition, the Computer Command Ride, or CCR, system has been revised.\n\nThe system includes four electronically controlled suspension struts and a lateral (sideways) accelerometer that offer three speed- controlled modes of ride.\n\nAt speeds up to 40 miles per hour, the struts are in a floating comfort mode. From 40 to 60 mph, they shift to a normal mode for a more balanced ride. Above 60 mph, they shift to a firm mode to enh ance high-speed control.\n\nThe lateral accelerometer controls the struts in the firm mode to prevent body roll under aggressive driving conditions.\n\nThe resulting action is a ride that ranges from the traditional Cadillac boulevard-type ride to that approaching sports-car control.\n\nIt took only a touch of the wheel to weave the “500” support STS through traffic. And it would go through high-speed sharp corners almost as if it was on rails, completely absent of body flounder.\n\nPricey set of wheels\n\nThe model is definitely an expensive automobile, so owners may not really be all that interested in playing road racer.\n\n“The price structure for the ones we’ve had,” Watts said, “has been between $41,000 and $42,000. That’s without a sunroof. If you want a sunroof, that’s another $1,400.”\n\nThe STS maintains the Cadillac flavor through the use of\n\nleathers, Zebrano woods, and a full complement of comfort and convenience equipment. If you can find one, it makes motoring a quite pleasant experience.\n\nAvailability is tight, but it is improving. It has been rare to find more than one on a sales floor. Once that situation is rectified, sales projections are that the STS will represent about 12 percent to 15 percent of Cadillac sales.\n\nIt already is showing signs of making conquest sales.\n\n“We’re making a lot of them,” Moll said. “The Jaguar and Lexus crowd, cars like that.\n\n“This (STS) car is bringing these people in. And frankly, they probably wouldn’t be in here if we didn’t have it.”",

      "expert_review": "The current-generation Seville Touring Sedan exemplifies Cadillac’s efforts to re-invent itself as an American luxury automaker with a more European flavor.\n\nThat Old World seasoning is evident in the supple ride, slick handling and restrained styling.\n\nBut making its wares attractive to import buyers is really only part of a larger re-invention. The company also wants to reclaim its reputation for cutting edge technology it enjoyed through most of the 20th Century. That impulse also is evident in the new STS. Redesigned for the 1998 model year, and repeatedly tweaked since, the STS is one of the most technologically advanced production cars in the world.\n\nWhen you consider the hardware and software it is packing, and the window stickers on the typically less-advanced imports with which it competes, its $48,480 base price seems quite fair.\n\nThe hi-tech highlights of the STS begin with its freshly re-engineered Northstar V-8. What’s interesting is that the designers were able to maintain the 300 horsepower developed by this 4.6-liter beauty while lowering its emissions, noise levels and octane requirements. The result is the only high-end luxury sedan I can think of that runs on regular gas.\n\nThis engine feeds into a four-speed automatic transmission that acts like a manual gearbox during aggressive driving. Using a series of vehicle sensors, the Performance Algorithm Shifting (PAS) feature intuits driving situations and provides for them.\n\nFor example, when you brake for a corner, the transmission will shift down to the correct gear, just as a skilled driver would with a manual box. It will then stay in that gear as you accelerate out of the corner. As I found out on the road course at Pocono International Raceway, this is a wonderful way to prevent those mid-corner upshifts that can upset the balance of the car.\n\nThe STS also has StabiliTrak, a stability-control system that selectively applies one of the front brakes to counteract a sideways slide of the front or back wheels. This year, it has been improved to nail both front brakes if the car loses lateral traction at both the front and rear wheels.\n\nThe STS also has Continuously Variable Road-Sensing Suspension (CVRSS), a system that instantly tailors the shock absorber damping at each wheel to changing driving conditions. The result is greater ride smoothness, less impact feel and more control during emergency maneuvers.\n\nCVRSS improvements for 2000 include using shock damping to counteract body roll during cornering.\n\nThe STS even has a “road-texture detection” feature that makes the anti-lock braking system work better by measuring road roughness and adjusting brake operation for it.\n\nAlso available on this car is an STS exclusive called “adaptive seating.” Based on a technology first used in hospital burn units, adaptive seating recognizes an occupant’s shape and position and adjusts 10 air cells to fit the person.\n\nNew this year is a nifty, CD-ROM-based navigation system.\n\nWhen you put all this hardware in league with more commonplace safety and hedonism gear, such as side air bags and a Bose sound system, you get an exceptionally safe and comfortable automobile. You also get an exceptionally athletic one. The STS handles quite well for a large sedan. It’s acceleration and braking are also out of the ordinary.\n\nA pretty car inside and out, the STS left little to gripe about. The only sour test car notes that come to mind were limited legroom space in the front passenger seat and body fits that weren’t quite world class.\n\nCADILLAC STS\n\nBase model: Front-drive, 4.6-liter engine, four-speed automatic transmission, power anti-lock disc brakes, speed-sensitive power steering, 16-inch alloy wheels, P235/60HR16 touring tires, anti-slide system, road texture detection, automatic shock absorber damping, traction control, front and side air bags, seat belt pre-tensioners, automati headlights and wipers, theft deterrent system, leather power seats, zebrano wood trim, dual-zone climate control, power windows, power mirrors, power door locks with keyless entry, power tilt and telescopic steering wheel with memory, Bose sound system with cassette and CD players, compass/mirror.\n\nTest model: Adaptive seats, garage door opener, heated front and rear seats, navigation system, chromed alloy wheels, P235/ZR16 performance tires, special paint, extra wood trim, six-disc CD changer, ultrasonic rear parking assist.\n\nBase price: $48,480\n\nTest price: $55,952 (inc. shipping)\n\nEPA city mileage: 17\n\nTest mileage: 19.5\n\nWarranty: Four years/50,000 miles bumper to bumper, roadside assistance.",

      "expert_review": "The open road is the ideal place to discover the virtues of Cadillac’s redesigned Seville Touring Sedan (STS), so it was with anticipation and excitement that I merged onto Interstate 10 at Baton Rouge and headed east to New Orleans, a southern American city overlayed with European character.\n\nLike New Orleans, the STS is a mix of cultures. It can be as spicy as Creole hot sauce or as coolly elegant as European architecture. But what makes it a road-car extraordinaire is the way it drives, like an amalgam of Tokyo, Detroit and Munich. It wafts down the road as quietly as a Japanese car and holds the road with the tautness of a German car, yet it bulges with 300 American horsepower from its Northstar V8.\n\nThe redesign, now based on the third generation of the G platform used for the Oldsmobile Aurora, is so evolutionary that unless you have a sharp eye for detail it is hard to distinguish the new model from the old. I wish it were bolder, more of a departure from the past car. What you can’t see are significant changes: The wheelbase is longer, the overall length is shorter and the track is wider. The interior is more spacious, too, and much better finished. Best of all, it now possesses the kind of polished performance found in high-class cars.\n\nThe price is considerable — our test car stickered at $50,402 — which puts it in the same ballpark as the BMW 540i, Mercedes-Benz E420 and Lexus LS 400. Stiff competition, to be sure.\n\nIn keeping with its multi-national personality, Cadillac expects this car to have international appeal, which is why export versions for Europe and Asia are available with right-hand drive.\n\nFor those who want a softer ride, more luxury and less horsepower (275), there’s the Seville Luxury Sedan (SLS). We chose to stick with the STS because it best captures the character Cadillac was trying to achieve.\n\nMy wife and I were on vacation and through the good graces of Cadillac, we were able to log more than 1,200 miles on an STS, a car that has been in short supply since late last year when it was first introduced. It barreled along the bayous in lounge-chair comfort, yet it tackled the twisting mountain roads of northwestern Arkansas with the quiet aggressiveness of a German sports sedan.\n\nThe 4.6-liter Northstar V8, which has been around since 1992, is a terrific engine. This year it is quieter and smoother. Accessories, such as the water-cooled generator, are mounted directly to the engine block to eliminate vibration, and resonators were added to the intake tract for less noise under full throttle. It doesn’t feel quite as raucous as before, nor as fast, but certainly more refined. Cruising at 75 most of the time, it averaged 20.9 mpg according to the built-in trip computer.\n\nThe STS is an electronic bonanza. Not only does it have traction control and anti-lock brakes, but it also has a continuously variable suspension and StabiliTrak. StabiliTrak uses a combination of sensors, computer processor and brakes to enhance vehicle stability by selectively applying or releasing individual front brakes to keep the car on the proper course through a turn. I could not feel it working on dry pavement, although it would at high enough speeds. It would be most useful in snow, ice or rain.\n\nThe speed-sensitive power steering (Magnasteer) was fine most of the time, but in mountain turns it felt artificially heavy, and relatively numb.\n\nThe transmission’s performance algorithm matches gear shifts to the speed of the car, which is handy on twisty roads.\n\nInside, the STS now has an interior on par with the best in its class. The genuine wood trim, on the dash, door panels and steering wheel, is beautiful. The leather upholstery was buttery soft and plush. Vacuum-fluorescent analog gauges are similar in appearance to that of the Lexus LS 400 and Lincoln Continental.\n\nSecondary controls for climate control and stereo are near clones of those i the Lexus LS 400, which is not a bad thing. They are large, simple, clearly marked and ideally located. They work smoothly and have a quality feel.\n\nOur test car was equipped with the optional Adaptive Seat Package, which was handy for day-long drives. A network of 10 air cells located in the seat cushion, back and sides automatically inflates to determine the size and shape of the occupant. Each cell then adjusts to create a custom fit for each person.\n\nAnother nice touch: The seatbelts are built into the seat so they always fit properly, even when the seat is reclined.\n\nIn addition to front airbags, side airbags are built into the seat backs.\n\nSpending a week traveling with Cadillac’s ultimate road car was a good test. Except for a cruise control that periodically stopped working, we encountered no problems. A couple of items, such as windshield wipers that automatically speed up as rainfall gets heavier, and the adaptive seats, were most appreciated. Now, if only the price weren’t quite so high.\n\nPrice\n\nThe base price of our test car was $46,995. Options included the adaptive seats, wood trim package, Z-rated tires and chrome wheels. The sticker price was $50,402.\n\nWarranty\n\nThe basic warranty is for four years or 50,000 miles.\n\nVehicles for The Star’s week-long test drives are supplied by the auto manufacturers.\n\nPoint: The STS may well be the best car built by General Motors. It is quick, quiet and smooth, with sharp handling and good ergonomics. Instrumentation is excellent and controls fall readily to hand.\n\nCounterpoint: The evolutionary styling could be bolder; the steering, particularly on mountain roads, felt artificially heavy; and the price is pretty steep.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\n\nENGINE: 4.6-liter, V8\n\nTRANSMISSION: automatic\n\nWHEELBASE: 112.2 inches\n\nCURB WEIGHT: 4001 lbs.\n\nBASE PRICE: $46,995\n\nPRICE AS DRIVEN: $50,402\n\nMPG RATING: 17 city, 26 hwy.",

      "expert_review": "People above a certain age will remember that, when something was the best, it was called the “Cadillac” of its class.\n\nAlas, quality control problems and bad marketing decisions in the ’70s and ’80s turned that into an anachronism.\n\nBut things changed when the Seville STS was introduced in the early ’90s, and the new interior and drive train refinements of this year’s model enhance the experience it offers.\n\nStart with looks. This crisply formed car stands out in a broad-shouldered, crisp manner that’s elegant and sporty at the same time. With its deep white paint and sparkling chrome wheels, it’s clearly distinguished in a sea of bland black blobs that pass themselves off as luxury cars. No, the STS looks more like Arnold in a tuxedo.\n\nIt drives that way, too. Thanks to the Northstar system (that’s Cadillac-speak for their 4.6-liter, double overhead cam V-8), the car really moves. From O-60 takes a mere 7.3 seconds because this Caddy packs 300 horsepower through the front wheels. Despite full-speed traction control, this front-wheel drive sedan gets squirmy on hard takeoffs — but then, reining in all this power is half the fun.\n\nThe muscle is put down through a four-wheel, independent suspension with front and rear stabilizer bars. Additionally, Cadillac has fitted the STS with road-sensing suspension, which reads the inputs from the steering wheel and adjusts the damping at all four corners, as well as adjusting brake modulation and cornering traction.\n\nThe results of all this computerization is a firm but well-controlled ride. There’s some isolation, but cornering can be done with confidence.\n\nIt proved invaluable while piloting through the blizzard of ’96. The STS handled snow-covered, icy roads with the confidence of a four-wheel-drive vehicle. The traction control was a real boon on ice. The quick steering, GM’s electromagnetic system, varies the effort needed as speeds increase or decrease, but hasa disconnected feel to it. However, you’ll definitely still take the long way home.\n\nThat’s because this car can play the sedate luxury cruiser role very well. You glide majestically all day. But ask it to pound through the corners and the dual exhaust lets loose with a muted but audible growl. It’s sophisticated, but with a muscle-car character. As the scenery starts rolling by you faster, the only thing you’ll do is smile.\n\nAnd you’ll be coddled all the way. The interior is new this year. The center console is now home to ventilation, stereo system and minor controls. The look is not too far afield of Lexus, but it’s an improvement. The radio and climate controls sport big, easy to use knobs. The AM/FM-cassette-CD player with 12-disc changer offers superb sound. The plastics and real wood veneer used are of fine quality.\n\nBy moving some controls to the center console, space was freed up to make the speedometer, tachometer and other gauges larger and easier to re ad. It’s a big improvement over last year. Door-mounted controls for windows, locks and mirrors have a more ergonomic feel this year. There are steering wheel-mounted paddles for the stereo and climate control. They’re very convenient and easier to use than the center-console controls.\n\nOf course, a Cadillac has to pamper, and the STS does. The leather seats are rich and supportive, proving very comfortable. Heat for those seats and a power moonroof are optional. Automatic headlights are back this year, joined by a new Caddy feature, Rainsense. A module located behind the rearview mirror sends out a laser beam. This infrared beam counts the raindrops as they fall and activates the windshield wipers for you at the appropriate speed.\n\nThis car is too sweet to allow anyone else behind the wheel. From its powerful drive train to its athletic looks, the STS has tons of character, something increasingly rare in today’s automotive world.\n\nCadillac Seville STS tandard: 4.6-liter V-8, four-speed automatic transmission, speed-sensitive steering, Goodyear Z-rated tires, anti-lock brakes, keyless entry, Twilight Sentinel, power trunk pulldown, cellular telephone wiring, leather seats, electronic climate control, full console with cupholders, power seats, AM/FM-cassette.

      "expert_review": "Cadillac Motor Car Division has two Seville models that meet the adage of something for everybody — in the luxury car field.\n\nTabbed the SLS for Seville Luxury Sedan, and STS for Seville Touring Sedan, the two are kissing cousins. Their body construction is identical, and their primary mechanical features almost so.\n\nThe STS get an additional 25 horsepower but gives up 10 foot-pounds of torque through a little higher valve lift and valve duration. Both cars are powered by Cadillac’s 4.6-liter (279 cubic inch) Northstar V-8.\n\nThe Seville Touring Sedan also has a suspension tuned differently than the SLS, plus some exterior trim and interior appointment differences. These add up to a higher price sticker.\n\nUnder normal conditions, there really isn’t a great deal of difference in the way the two cars drive.\n\nThe tourer has a little tighter suspension for those who want to fly into the corners with the pedal to the metal. But somehow, Cadillac drivers who like to live on the ragged edge seem to be the exception rather than the rule.\n\nThe SLS that General Motors Corp.’s Terri Phillips provided for a test car would do just about anything any car on the road can do, including motoring into society.\n\nIts luxury theme was fulfilled by new powertrain, chassis and interior features for 1994. This was particularly fulfilled by the addition of the Northstar system.\n\nThe four-cam, 32-valve V-8 is a first-class engine in anybody’s league. And matched with GM’s advanced 4T80-E four-speed automatic, road-sensing suspension, speed-sensitive steering, anti-lock braking and traction control, it’s an automobile that can cut a wide swath on any street or highway.\n\nThe SLS is about as easy a car to drive as you would want. You can sit high or low by virtue of a six-way power seat, and you can drop the tilt steering wheel almost into your lap.\n\nThe only thing I miss here is the telescopic wheel of earlier Cadillacs, but that was before the days of air bags.\n\nThere’s no better introduction to the attributes of the SLS than to lean on the throttle and steer. It takes off like the proverbial scalded cat.\n\nThe 270-horsepower V-8 accelerates far more rapidly than Cadillac’s push-rod/rocker-arm engine. It goes up the rpm scale right now, and takes a 3,830-pound luxury sedan with it.\n\nNo matter how fast you’re going in an SLS, a driver has the distinct impression the car is going to go where he or she wants it to. You can mark this up to the sensitivity of the steering and the suspension.\n\nAt high speed there is nominal power- steering assistance, giving the driver a high degree of feel. It took but minute movement of the wheel to change lanes or negotiate fast turns. As speed is reduced, the power effort is increased, and was at maximum when parking.\n\nUnlike earlier luxo-boats that tended to float along with an easy ride, the STS’s RSS (road-sensing suspension) system gave a computerized ride that optimized ride control and road feel.\n\nBy controlling the acti on of the shock absorbers relative to speed and road conditions, the four independently sprung wheels absorbed all but the roughest of pavement conditions. And even then, there was minimum vibration transmitted to the passenger compartment.\n\nThe result was almost as smooth as a limo, and just about as quiet.\n\nThe name Cadillac has been synonymous with fine motor cars from its beginnings in 1903. While the SLS isn’t as big as Cadillac’s rear-drive Fleetwood or front-drive DeVille, all the accouterments were present for refined motoring.\n\nThe standard power accessories were on board, along with zebrano woods, keyless entry and the like. Some options such as a Delco-Boise stereo system, leather and a sport interior added a bit of extra flavor.\n\nOverall, the SLS can be classified as one of Cadillac’s better efforts, with the only quality glitch a service light that remained on due to a stuck oil switch.\n\n1994 Cadillac Seville LS Base price: $41,430.As tested: $46 ,192.Type: Front engine, front- drive, five-passenger luxury sedan.Engine: 4.6 liters, DOHC V-8, 32 valves, fuel-injected, 270 horsepower, 300 foot-pounds of torque.Transmission: Four-speed automatic.Mileage: 16 mpg city, 25 mpg highway.Acceleration: 0-60 mph in 7.5 seconds.Wheelbase: 111.0 inches.Length: 204.1 inches.Width: 74.2 inches.Height: 54.5 inches.Curb weight: 3,830 pounds.Options: Delco-Bose stereo with cassette, compact disc player, sport interior, leather, white diamond exterior, power lumbar support, automatic day/night mirror, chrome wheels, theft deterrent system.",

      "expert_review": "The Cadillac Seville makes my heart ache.\n\nWithout question, the elegantly styled Seville is the sexiest-looking Cadillac ever made. To these eyes, the sleek Seville doesn’t have a bad angle or awkward line.\n\nThe Seville has the looks and character so badly lacking in large Japanese luxury sedans, and it has the muscle and style usually found in European luxury cars.\n\nBut a 1,000-mile test drive left me feeling that owning this car would be something of a love-hate relationship.\n\nI would love the Seville for its head-turning looks, refined performance and exceptional fuel mileage.\n\nBut I would hate the car for the things it does not have, namely, a sunroof – a standard fixture on cars this expensive – memory seats, a better air conditioning system and better assembly.\n\nAnd frankly, despite its many strong points, the Seville’s price is a major sore point with me. The current generation of the Seville started out three years ago at just under $35,000. Except for the addition of the wonderful Northstar V-8 engine and a sophisticated new automatic transmission, the car is basically the same. I don’t see $7,000 worth of improvements.\n\nThis year the Seville comes in two distinct models: the sporty Seville Touring Sedan (STS) and the softer-riding and quieter Seville Luxury Sedan (SLS), which I tested.\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nCadillac has a world-class engine in its powerful, dependable 4.6-liter Northstar V-8. This 32-valve, four-cam V-8 delivers 275 horsepower and is capable of propelling the Seville to 60 mph in just 7.5 seconds. That’s an impressive show of force.\n\nHorsepower and exhaust system noise are two major differences between the Seville SLS and the STS. The STS has more of both. It comes with 25 more horsepower and a rumbling dual exhaust system. The 275-horsepower SLS is quieter, perhaps geared to older buyers.\n\nCadillac has designed the Northstar so that it requires little maintenance. Other than changing fluid and filters, no tuneups or adjustments are required until the car reaches 100,000 miles.\n\nCadillac engineers have tuned the Seville well. It is very responsive from a stop; just a light touch of the accelerator is all it takes to get moving quickly. Once in motion, GM’s exceptionally refined four-speed automatic makes a nearly seamless transition from one gear to the next.\n\nThanks to computers that link the engine to the transmission, shifts – up or down – are barely discernible in most instances.\n\nI took the car on a long trip – a 750-mile excursion to Pensacola and back. With the cruise control on and the air conditioner running, the Seville used a gallon of premium unleaded every 26.9 miles. That is nothing less than astounding for a large V-8-powered, four-door luxury sedan carrying three passengers.\n\nIn the city, the Seville returned nearly 19 mpg.\n\nThe Seville, Cadillac says, can go 500 miles on the highway between fill-ups. I know of no sim ilar gasoline-powered foreign or domestic car that uses fuel more efficiently.\n\nHANDLING\n\nThe Seville’s four-wheel independent suspension system is equipped with a maze of sensors connected to a computer. Cadillac says the Seville’s brake, traction control, steering and suspension systems monitor and react to different driving conditions.\n\nI have to wonder what this sophisticated hardware really adds to the Seville’s handling characteristics. I have tested other luxury cars that didn’t have electronically controlled suspension systems, and I can tell you that the differences between them and the Seville are small at best.\n\nThe Seville SLS, a very refined touring sedan, has a semi-soft ride, powerful brakes and crisp steering. The STS on the other hand, offers a stiffer suspension and a more aggressive ride.\n\nOn a long trip, the SLS devours the miles. Generally, the car is quiet over the road. (There was, however, a trace of wind noise from the area near the mirrors.) But on concrete roads the tires slap the seams between the slabs o f concrete, and the noise finds its way into the cabin.\n\nOverall, though, the SLS is an easy luxury sedan to drive because the visibility is excellent and you feel comfortable and in control almost immediately.\n\nThe power-assisted rack-and-pinion steering has a wonderfully smooth and consistent feel, and it reacts sharply to slight movements.\n\nSeville SLS is outfitted with a set of strong four-wheel anti-lock disc brakes.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nDuring the past three years, Cadillac has made great strides in improving the way it builds the Seville.\n\nThe first of the new Sevilles had a slew of problems – components didn’t work well or trim parts didn’t fit together properly.\n\nToday’s models may look the same, but the increased attention to detail is clearly evident.\n\nI remember the first time I drove a new Seville. I could see a portion of the temperature sensor for the air conditioner sticking out from a slight indentation under the dash just to the right of the instrument panel. It looked as if there was a hole in the dash.\n\nThat temperature sensor is still in the same place, but unless you specifically look for it, you won’t notice it. The top of the dash appears to fit tighter.\n\nA minor point, yes. But if Cadillac is asking more than $46,000 for a car, the vehicle should meet the high quality standards set by Lexus and a few other automakers.\n\nWith one minor exception, our gorgeous blue test car was assembled well. The weather stripping near the windshield didn’t look as if it was installed properly. It did not seal tightly against the body, and it looked as if water could easily get between the seal and body. Although I drove through a heavy downpour, I saw no leaks.\n\nThat said, our test car came with a supple and attractive set of tan leather bucket seats and a handsome floor-mounted shifter. A full length console – complete with a rear-passenger-controlled fan – added a touch of class to the European-inspired interior.\n\nThe instrument panel, however, was unimpressive. The plain-looking analog speedometer and tachometer are fairly small, and they are flanked by controls for the air conditioner on the right and the computer system on the left.\n\nTo work the controls for the air conditioner or to access information from the car’s computer, you have to reach to either side of the steering wheel – not a very user-friendly setup.\n\nUnlike other similarly priced luxury cars, you can’t fine-tune the Seville’s air-conditioning system. That is, if you want air directed only at face level or only at your feet, you are out of luck.\n\nAlso, the only way you can shut off outside air (setting the system to recirculate inside air) is to lower the computerized air-conditioning system to its coldest setting. There is no recirculate button, as found on many other cars. That means that if you a re driving down the road and a smoke-belching diesel truck is spewing fumes in front of the Seville, you can’t just press a button to quickly switch to recirculated air.\n\nHowever, on hot days the air conditioner’s ample cooling power makes the interior comfortable very quickly.\n\nAs you would expect on any Cadillac, room in the interior and trunk is abundant.\n\nOur test car came with a superb AM/FM cassette/CD player. The powerful audio system proved easy to use.\n\nAlthough our test car had built-in holders in the overhead console for a garage door opener and sunglasses, the interior proved a difficult place in which to store small things.\n\nUnless you open up the somewhat bulky center console – which is designed to hold CDs – there really is no convenient place to store such items as a set of keys or a wallet. All the Seville really needs here is pockets in the front-door panels.\n\nHere’s my recipe for the perfect Seville: Keep the exterior styling exactly asit is, get rid of the costly computerized suspension system, outfit the car with a more expressive and functional interior (one that includes better controls for the air conditioner and nicer-looking gauges) and price it at $40,000.\n\nThe way I see it, that price would make the Seville a more reasonable alternative to such vehicles as the mechanically similar Oldsmobile Aurora ($33,000), the new Lincoln Continental ($41,000) and imports such as the BMW 540i ($45,000).\n\nTruett’s tip: Cadillac’s Seville SLS is a superbly engineered luxury sedan that offers excellent performance, a soothing yet sporty ride, terrific fuel economy and gorgeous styling – all at a rather hefty price.",

      "expert_review": "As a former Top 40 disc jockey as well as a classically trained pianist, music is as much a part of my test drives as the actual driving.\n\nSo it goes without saying that my interest in testing out a 2002 Cadillac Seville with a new XM Satellite Radio was intense.\n\nXM was named Fortune magazine’s “Product of the Year” for 2001. Time named it “Invention of the Year.” Popular Science dubbed it the “Best of What’s New.”\n\nIs the hype justified?\n\nYes.\n\nTo a true music pig like myself, having 100 channels to choose from was nirvana (the feeling not the group.) After all, leaving the house without any CDs or tapes can be a frustrating experience. With most commercial-drenched radio stations playing some bland, boring derivation of rock, there’s little to truly choose from among broadcast stations. Their playlists are strangled by consultants, who play the same stagnant music over and over. Pleasure isn’t the key here, profits are.\n\nYou don’t have to buy a Cadillac to get the service. Several audio manufacturers sell aftermarket XM receivers for about $300, about the cost of the XM option on the Cadillac. Once activated, you pay $9.99 a month.\n\nIf you’re wondering why you should pay for radio, take a look at what you get: 100 channels, about two-thirds of which are commercial-free. Once you find what you like, you can preset the car radio buttons and drive across the country. The stations stay with you coast-to-coast, beamed from XM’s satellite as well as earth- based repeaters. The signal is digital and the sound beats even your best CD.\n\nThere is no local content, so you must tune to one of the monotonous local stations for weather and traffic. But that’s it. Otherwise, XM has you covered.\n\nThere are six stations covering an individual decade of music, from the ’40s through the ’90s. Six stations broadcast country, 15 broadcast Top 40 hits, 10 play rock, 7 broadcast urban music, 6 play jazz, 4 are dedicated to dance, 5 play Latin and 6 offer world music. Long-ignored classical music lovers will note the presence of four classical stations, including one “hits” station and another just for opera. There are two children’s stations, Radio Disney and XM Kids. Twelve news stations vie for your attention, including CNN, The Weather Channel, CNBC, CNNfn, Bloomberg, C-Span and Fox News. There are five sports channels (including CNN SI, ESPN and NASCAR Radio) as well as three comedy channels. Finally, there is Variety, with 9 channels of varied material (E!, Family Talk, Discovery Radio and so on.)\n\nDespite the mind-boggling array, I quickly settled on a few favorites.\n\nXM Pops played my favorite classical pieces; The Groove played old-school R &amp; B; Laugh USA had me in stitches.\n\nBut three channels quickly became my favorites: Fred, which played a distinctive blend of alternative rock (“Instanbul” by T he Might Be Giants, “Lust For Life” by Iggy Pop, followed by “So In Love” by OMD) that broadcast radio could never stoop to play.\n\nFrank’s Place celebrated not just Frank Sinatra, but the classic American songbook, with stars such as Nat King Cole, Tony Bennet and Dinah Washington singing with class and sophistication, lacking in most modern music.\n\nAnd “Hank’s Place” played the sort of classic honky tonk drenched country music that today’s hat acts can’t touch. When was the last time you heard Merle Haggard, Hank Williams Sr., Bill Anderson or other classic country acts bemoaning their battles with women and booze?\n\nWhat’s so nice about this digital dollop of entertainment is that each song is listed on the radio’s dial with title and artist. What’s not so nice is that some of the programming that comes out of XM’s 82 studios contain the same obnoxious patter as broadcast radio. And there’s no PBS station, although BBC World Service is a de ent substitute.\n\nAnd it all comes in crystal-clear. Occasionally, the station will drop for a few seconds. It’s like hearing a CD skip. In driving all over the Lehigh Valley, two places were problem spots. Otherwise, it was fine, even driving under overpasses and through hilly mountain roads.\n\nXM is a Cadillac exclusive for 2002, but it will become available on more than 20 GM models for 2003, from Chevrolet Cavalier to Cadillac\n\nDeVille.\n\nFor those of you who thought something was missing from radio, it is. True choice. And that is well worth $9.99 a month.\n\nAnd the Cadillac Seville? Nice car.",

      "expert_review": "Like most couples, we don’t see eye-to-eye on many things. And, like most couples, we usually can find some common ground or compromise that satisfies both of us. But not on the 1999 Cadillac Seville STS.\n\nPaul thinks the latest edition of the STS may just be the best car built in America. Anita dismisses it as “stodgy” and wouldn’t buy one on a bet. Not surprisingly, Paul gave it four stars, our top rating. Anita agreed to give it three stars only because “my respect for old geezers bumped it up a notch.”\n\nShe: OK, so I snuck out of work one afternoon last week to visit my parents at their condo, which is the center of the universe for aspiring Cadillac owners. It is the vehicle to have if you’re trying to impress your neighbors there. And therein lies the tale of this test drive from my perspective. If you’re over 70 and retired, you’ll go bonkers over the 1999 Seville STS we tested. I’m happy to report that I’m still young enough that I just don’t get the appeal of the STS. Even its high-tech veneer doesn’t eliminate the stodginess factor. It’s still the car my parents want to drive. Not me. I guess it’s more for your age group, dear. I know you love it.\n\nHe: Hey, I’m not ashamed to admit two things. One, I’m considerably older than you. And I have more facial hair. Oh, sorry, what I really meant was, I love the STS. Is it better than a BMW 540i? No, but it’s darn close, not to mention several thousand dollars cheaper.\n\nSkip some of the fancy stuff we had on our test car, such as the sunroof and adaptive front seats, and the sticker price comes in under $50,000. Not bad for a vehicle that will run circles around a Lincoln Continental and most of the Japanese competition. My biggest complaint concerns the exterior design, which I think is unduly conservative, given the grace, performance and comfort of the STS.\n\nShe: Let’s go back to those adaptive seats, which have a Norman Bates-y cheap-motel kind of creepiness. Not to mention that they cost an extra $1,627. I don’t care if they’re used in burn units or whatever. I don’t want the seat in my car massaging me.\n\nHe: I can arrange to have the chauffeur massage you.\n\nShe: That would be much better. You do have to give Cadillac credit for making a car that will get you safely down to Florida and back. I really like features such as the built-in seat belts in the seats. They’re far more comfortable than the ones mounted on the center pillar, which can sometimes make you feel like you’re on the gallows. The Seville has front and side air bags, standard anti-lock brakes and traction control and even an advanced stability-control system similar to the ones offered on BMW and Mercedes-Benz.\n\nHe: You can keep making all the old-people jokes you want, but I’m still impressed by a luxury sedan that can zip from zero to 60 in 6.7 seconds. And with the optional Z-rated Goodyear Eagle LS tires that came on our test car, the STS has a top speed of 150 mph. But more than those raw numbers, it’s the sheer handling capability of the car, and its superior ride quality, that leave a lingering impression. If I had to pick a car to make a 1,000-mile round trip, or better still, to live in for a year, the STS would be at the top of my list.\n\nShe: I couldn’t live in it with that intimidating all-black interior. And I didn’t much care for that glossy, artificial-looking wood Cadillac uses on the interior. You know what? They need to take the car over to Audi to have the cabin redesigned. At the very least, I would pick the oatmeal interior over the black.\n\nHe: Sorry, kiddo. I love the black cockpit. Very Germanic. And totally macho. The backlit gauges are pretty cool, too. And it seems like the trim fits and the quality of the material keeps getting better and better.\n\nShe: Wait a minute. Did you say “Germanic?” Isn’t this car built at the Poletown plant in Detroit? Who are you kidding?\n\nHe: So it doesn’t push yourem ional or ethnic buttons. Tough. I’m giving it four stars. And hope I make enough money some day to own one.\n\nShe: I know exactly the condo you’ll end up in.\n\n1999 Cadillac Seville STS\n\nAnita’s rating: above average\n\nPaul’s rating: world class\n\nType: Front-engine, front-wheel-drive, five-passenger luxury sedan.\n\nPrice: Base, $48,050; as tested, $53,242 (including $670 destination charge).\n\nEngine: 4.6-liter V-8; 300 hp at 6,000 rpm; 295 lb-ft torque at 4,400 rpm.\n\nEPA fuel economy: 17 mpg city/26 mpg highway.\n\n12-month insurance cost, according to AAA Michigan*: $1,517. (Estimate. Rates may be higher or lower, depending on coverage and driving record.)\n\nWhere built: Detroit.\n\nWhat we liked: May be the best car built in America (Paul); superb dynamic behavior (Paul); good value (Paul); excellent application of advanced technology (Paul); love the all-black interior (Paul); impressive safety features; terrific acceleration.\n\nWhat we didn’t like: Feels like an old person’s car (Anita); technology that borders on the creepy, like massaging seat (Anita); too expensive (Anita); all-black interior looks intimidating (Anita); boring exterior design.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nNew telematics features and a sport suspension package for the STS model are the main additions for the Seville, Cadillacs flagship sedan.\n\nThe new Infotainment option provides voice-operated services such as navigation assistance and downloading e-mail from the Internet (and having it read aloud). The package includes hardware for docking a cellular phone that can be operated by voice or keypad, an infrared port for personal digital assistants and a voice memo recorder.\n\nThe e-mail and Web-browsing capabilities, which are disabled while the car is moving, will be test marketed in several areas to determine if there is sufficient demand to offer it nationally.\n\nOnStar is standard on all Cadillac models and includes emergency services and assistance in finding destinations. Two premium services will be added later in the model year. These services include personal calling, which allows hands-free, voice-activated calls from the car without an additional cellular phone contract, and virtual advisor, which provides Internet-based information such as headlines, sports scores, stock quotes and weather conditions, also through voice activation.\n\nThe sport package for the STS includes 17-inch wheels and tires (16-inchers are standard) and firmer suspension settings.\n\nExterior\nWith an overall length of 201 inches, the front-drive Seville is 6 inches shorter than the DeVille. The Seville is smaller because it is Cadillacs key export model, and most European garages can hold cars that are a little over 5 meters long.\n\nInterior\nFront buckets are standard on both the SLS (Seville Luxury Sedan) and STS (Seville Touring Sedan) models and can be equipped with Cadillacs adaptive seating feature. Ten air cells in the upholstery change pressure about every 4 minutes to adapt the seat to the occupant and the way the passengers are sitting.\n\nA navigation system with a 5-inch color display in the dashboard and touch-screen controls also is optional on both Seville models.\n\nUnder the Hood\nBoth models use a 4.6-liter V-8, but this engine comes two ways. It produces 275 horsepower in the SLS and 300 hp in the STS. Both can operate on regular gasoline, though Cadillac recommends premium gas for best performance and economy. A four-speed automatic transmission comes with both engines.\n\nSafety\nSide-impact airbags for the front seats, antilock brakes, traction control and StabiliTrak  a lateral-skid control system  are standard on both Seville models.\n\nGeneral Motors had planned to add a suppression system last year that would turn off the front passenger-side airbag if the seat was empty or occupied by a small child. However, GM withdrew those plans because the system was not reliable in testing.\n\n \n\nReported by Rick Popely  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2001 Buying Guide",
