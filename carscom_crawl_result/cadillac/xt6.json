      "expert_review": "Cadillac is in the midst of a product rollout to fill holes in its lineup that lagged the market shift to SUVs, having just added the XT4 small utility for 2019. The latest addition is the 2020 XT6 that fills a big gap below the super-sized (and super-priced) Escalade.\n\nRelated: 2020 Cadillac XT5 Adds More Standard Tech, New Base Engine\n\nLike the GMC Acadia with which it shares its DNA, the new mid-size XT6 is a “tweener” with a modest third row rather than a full-on three-row model, leaving a gap in the lineup with the full-size, truck-based Escalade and its even more capacious ESV stretch variant. And there is an even bigger gap in price, with the ‘Slade starting more than $20,000 higher.\n\nThe XT6 seats seven with a second-row bench or six with optional captain’s chairs and is offered in just two trim levels: Premium Luxury with a bit more bling and a Sport version with black trimmings and some added performance bits. The two reflect Cadillac’s current “Y strategy” for trim levels that diverge into a luxury track or a sportier track. Both XT6 variants offer a Platinum package with additional upscale trimmings, as well as additional tech and feature packages, but the choices still remain relatively simple compared with European brands’ a la carte menus.\n\n2020 Cadillac XT6 Premium Luxury | Cars.com photo by Fred Meier\n\nI drove both trim levels — each with additional packages — on Washington, D.C., streets and in the Virginia foothills at a Cadillac drive event. (Per our ethics policy, Cars.com pays for its own lodging and travel for such automaker-sponsored events.) The event also included a preview of the refreshed 2020 XT5, Cadillac’s global best-seller and its contestant in the red-hot luxury compact SUV market.\n\nA day in the new XT6, which is on sale now, revealed it to be a capable and comfortable SUV without glaring faults, but also one that doesn’t raise the bar for the breed with the kind of surprises or additional variants — or “presence” — that rival Lincoln brought to the SUV party with the new Aviator. Other premium rivals, by size and price, include the Acura MDX and Audi Q7.\n\n2020 Cadillac XT6 Sport | Cars.com photo by Fred Meier\nHow It Drives\n\nThe standard (and only) power is GM’s ubiquitous 310-horsepower V-6 that puts out 271 pounds-feet of torque, mated to a nine-speed automatic transmission and front- or all-wheel drive. The competent V-6 is up to the job, with strong power delivery and adequate, if not flashy, acceleration, both off-the-line and in mid-range passing or on-ramps. The transmission is well-behaved, with smooth shifts and willing downshifts, and the tuning is well-matched with the V-6 in this SUV. It does seem a little noisy when pushed, not intruding on the quiet cabin but sounding a little coarser than I expected in a luxury SUV. The automatic engine stop-start is very smooth and no doubt helps with the XT6’s EPA-estimated 20 mpg combined, but it also comes with an off switch.\n\nThe XT6 is no sports sedan, but its driving manners are more carlike and agile than its size would lead you to expect. It’s a fairly big SUV but feels smaller, with modest lean in corners and controlled body motion. That is especially true with the Sport trim level, which includes an adaptive suspension (optional on the Premium Luxury), as well as a quicker steering ratio and sportier transmission tuning. A bonus with the adaptive suspension is noticeably better ride quality both on city streets and on the highway. The standard suspension also had a smooth ride but seemed busier and bumpier by comparison.\n\n2020 Cadillac XT6 Sport | Cars.com photo by Fred Meier\n\nThe Sport also gets its own torque-vectoring all-wheel-drive system with an electronically controlled dual-clutch rear differential that can shift torque side to side. It provided improved cornering and understeer, and added a feel of rear bias.\n\nThe variable steering was light enough for parking lots but firmed up nicely at speed, and it was precise though without much road feedback. Braking was strong and pedal feel was linear.\n\nOn balance, the XT6 is well-behaved and comfortable, though also unexceptional, and its overall appeal would benefit from a more exciting power option. The tow rating is a relatively modest 4,000 pounds, but if your needs are more substantial or you tow a lot, the Escalade is Cadillac’s better choice.\n\n2020 Cadillac XT6 Sport | Cars.com photo by Fred Meier\nDoes It Say Luxury\n\nWhether the vehicle says luxury tends to matter to luxury buyers. Comparisons to the Lincoln Aviator are inevitable, and in both exterior and interior design, the XT6 simply has a less luxurious presence. It also offers no high-end upgrades, such as a fancy Black Label trim level or the coming 400-plus-horsepower hybrid Aviator. The front end has some of the edgier look of Cadillac’s Escala concept, but the XT-6’s sedate look overall is the least edgy in the Cadillac lineup. Inside, the materials and trim are high-quality and authentic, with real wood veneers or carbon fiber, but the look is similarly generic next to the high-style Aviator and much of the European competition, not to mention the in-house XT4 and XT5. If you’re looking at it next to an Acura MDX, it’s more than competitive (at least until a new-generation MDX rolls out), but that would hardly seem to be Cadillac’s — or an XT6 buyer’s — highest aspiration.\n\nThe XT6 also has some luxury detail lapses, such as windows that are one-touch-down all around, but aren’t one-touch-up for the rear doors. Also, a configurable instrument cluster is an option even though this feature is standard in many lesser vehicles now. And where are the surprise-and-delight options such as fancy massaging seats, cabin aromatherapy or fancy display graphics? A small slice of people might take these options, just as few will opt for others’ over-the-top trim levels with nosebleed prices, but they do have a halo effect on the whole line.\n\n2020 Cadillac XT6 Premium Luxury | Cars.com photo by Fred Meier\nWell-Equipped, Including Safety Tech\n\nStill, the XT6 in either trim level comes with an impressive array of standard equipment, from a power panoramic moonroof, a power-folding third row, a heated steering wheel and front seats, tri-zone climate control, a power tilt-and-telescope steering wheel, a hands-free power liftgate, LED front and rear lighting, eight-speaker Bose audio, wireless phone charging and both USB-A and newer USB-C ports for the first two rows and a pair of USB-C ports for the third row. It also gets Cadillac’s latest-generation media system with a knob-and-button “joystick” controller on the center console along with the touchscreen.\n\nAlso standard, and important for such an SUV, is more than adequate interior storage, including ample bins in front, a pull-out storage drawer for the second-row seat and removable underfloor storage in the cargo area that also stores the cargo cover.\n\n2020 Cadillac XT6 Sport | Cars.com photo by Fred Meier\n\nMore important, the XT6 has a load of standard safety and driver assistance tech (as many GM products do not) that includes a low-speed (up to 50 mph) front collision prevention system with automatic braking and pedestrian detection, front and rear parking sensors, a blind spot monitor with rear cross-traffic alert, auto-dimming inside and outside mirrors, lane departure warning, lane keeping assist, automatic high beams and cornering lamps. Available option packages add adaptive cruise control, a higher-speed front collision system, rear automatic braking and pedestrian alert, a video rearview mirror, a very capable 360-degree camera system, head-up display, an automatic parking system and a slick infrared night vision system that displays on the dash and alerts to upcoming hazards.\n\n2020 Cadillac XT6 Sport | Cars.com photo by Fred Meier\nGood Enough\n\nThe XT6 puts Cadillac on the board in the three-row competition but seems like more of an effort to fill the slot quickly and be good enough. It is a much nicer Acadia. It is very competitive on price and features, starting at $53,690 including destination, with the entry prices for similar-size rival SUVs including the MDX, Aviator and Q7. And while the latter two offer more variety in features and powertrains, they also can climb to near an Escalade’s price if you check all the boxes. Compare rival prices and features here and get more information on XT6 pricing here. The XT6 was enjoyable and comfortable to drive but also unremarkable, and it feels a little like a placeholder. It looks like we’ll have to wait for a next-generation XT6 to see if Cadillac can break out with something truly distinctive in a three-row SUV.\n\n2020 Cadillac XT6 Sport | Cars.com photo by Fred Meier\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Cadillac’s three-row XT6 SUV hasn’t really undergone any significant changes since it debuted as a 2020 model. Power choices are either a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder (introduced as the base engine for the 2021 model) or 3.6-liter V-6, both paired to a nine-speed automatic transmission, and buyers can choose from either front- or all-wheel drive. We recently drove a V-6-powered 2022 XT6 Premium Luxury, the model’s most luxurious trim, to see how it stacks up a few years after our initial drive. Aside from genuine sticker shock in response to our test vehicle’s nearly $71,000 price, the XT6 didn’t leave much of an impression among our four editors who drove it.\n\nRelated: Best Luxury Car of 2022\n\nDriving the XT6\n\nWith the 310-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 under the hood, this XT6 is the most powerful available in the lineup, but we’ve been clamoring for a more powerful engine option since the XT6 debuted. We’re still waiting. There’s adequate power, certainly, and the nine-speed automatic does a good job of kicking down when called upon, but there really isn’t much going on from any sort of performance perspective. Managing Editor Joe Bruzek called the experience “pedestrian,” and I’m inclined to agree; under hard acceleration, the V-6 can be loud and unrefined, unbecoming of a luxury SUV.\n\nRide and handling aren’t much more interesting, either. “Ride quality is comfort-oriented overall even with the 20-inch wheels and tires on our test vehicle,” according to Senior Research Editor Mike Hanley. “Our XT6 also had the Platinum Package, which includes an adaptive suspension. Especially rough pavement disturbs the sense of calm in the cabin, but for the most part, the XT6’s ride quality is composed and refined. The XT6 doesn’t care much for corners, though, and the driver’s seat doesn’t have much side bolstering to keep you in place.”\n\nIf you’re looking for a comfortable, calm ride from A to B — and that’s not a bad thing — the XT6 has what you seek in spades. But if you want even a dash of excitement or a drop of hot sauce with your meal, look elsewhere. It’s hard to find a truly fun three-row SUV, but the Acura MDX drives well, and the Genesis GV80’s twin-turbo 3.5-liter V-6 provides more power than the XT6’s naturally aspirated one.\n\nLuxurious Materials, Aged Tech Inside\n\nHanley felt the XT6’s interior delivered on its luxury promise, though third-row passengers get shorted.\n\n“The Platinum Package wraps the interior in rich materials like semi-aniline leather upholstery and a microfiber headliner, which joins swaths of wood trim. The premium materials are befitting our XT6’s premium price tag, and they carry through to the second row. Trim quality drops a bit in the third row, where there’s more hard plastic surfaces.”\n\n“While competent and of decent quality for the price (base price, here), the interior was stylistically uninteresting,” countered Bruzek. “I know this gets into a gray area of subjectivity, but the colors, style and materials were all very bland and traditional. And that’s somewhat of a bummer considering the exterior’s aggressive and muscular styling.”\n\nI’ve had similar issues with other Cadillac interiors, and they continue here; it may be nice inside, but it left me and Bruzek unimpressed. And lest you think Cadillac interiors can’t impress us, the larger Escalade’s interior is a key reason it’s a repeat winner of our Luxury Car of the Year award.\n\nInterior tech was also a sore spot. An 8-inch touchscreen display was once an impressive piece of technology, but it seemed small and dated to both me and Hanley. “The XT6’s tech features seem especially far behind what’s in the Escalade full-size SUV,” according to Hanley. Wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are nice-to-have features, however, and unlike in many other vehicles, I never had issues with the XT6’s wireless phone charger keeping my iPhone 12 charged while in its case. The sleeve-style charger is very effective, if a bit awkwardly designed.\n\nWe had mixed feelings about the XT6’s head-up display, too. While we were fans of the information displayed and that it remained visible while wearing polarized sunglasses, Bruzek noted “the light-colored dashboard reflected on the windshield, making the HUD appear like a giant black square on the windshield. The contrast of the HUD against the light dashboard color was very distracting. Solution: Choose a darker interior color.”\n\nThe XT6’s third row isn’t roomy enough for adults, though the available USB-C ports are a nice touch. The two-seat third row may be better left folded down for additional cargo space; Hanley pointed out that “the third-row backrest is powered in Premium Luxury trims, which makes switching from extra passenger to extra cargo duty easy.”\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nWhich Cars Have Panoramic Moonroofs or Sunroofs?\nWhich 3-Row SUVs Offer Captain’s Chairs?\nWhich New Cars Have Free Maintenance?\nWhich Used Cars Still Have Free Maintenance?\nCadillac Escalade: Which Should You Buy, 2021 or 2022?\nSticker Shock\n\nWhile Hanley pointed out that the interior materials matched our XT6’s price, that $70,965 price tag is too much to swallow when considering the vehicle on a whole.\n\n“I thought this would have been a competent car at $60,000,” noted Bruzek, “but the $70,000 asking price of our test car put it in the ‘nope’ category pretty easily.” Cars.com’s national inventory showed new 2022 XT6s with a median listing price of $59,891 in February. Our test vehicle came with seemingly every option — $14,775 in total, including the $5,000 Platinum package, $2,350 Technology Package and more. Options add up quickly.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that at more than $70,000 as equipped, our XT6 was close to the starting price of its Escalade big brother. Whether that closeness actually exists in today’s market is a different matter — as of this writing, the median price for a 2022 Escalade Luxury on Cars.com is currently $81,515 — but a base Escalade might be more appealing than a loaded XT6. Even if you’re not considering a larger (and more expensive) SUV, the XT6 isn’t a very exciting or interesting choice — and that seems to be intentional on Cadillac’s part.\n\nWhen we first drove the XT6, we called it “unremarkable” before we deemed it “good enough.” With so little altered since 2020, the first conclusion still holds: The XT6 is a thoroughly unremarkable SUV, But in just its third year, it’s not really “good enough” anymore, not in a growing segment with such strong competition.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Cadillac XT6?\n\nThe Cadillac XT6 is a three-row mid-size luxury SUV with seating for six or seven people, depending on whether a second-row bench or dual captain’s chairs are ordered. Available with front- or all-wheel drive, the XT6 comes standard with a 235-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder. This engine gets decent fuel economy, but it misses a beat (or two) if you’re after swift acceleration. Optional is a 310-hp, 3.6-liter V-6 that packs more straight-line punch. The XT6’s competitors include the Acura MDX, Infiniti QX60, Lexus TX and Volvo XC90.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Cadillac XT6?\n\nThe 2025 XT6 receives minor packaging updates: The Platinum Package for the Premium Luxury and Sport trims now includes Cadillac’s night vision feature and Super Cruise highway driving assist.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Cadillac XT6 Are Most Important?\n\n Standard features include:\n\n8-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nWi-Fi hot spot\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nSix USB ports\nSatellite radio\nTri-zone climate control\nBlind spot warning\nDriver attention monitor\nBose audio system\nHeated front seats\nRemote start\nPower liftgate\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nWireless device charging\nPower-folding third row\nRear camera mirror\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated rear outboard seats\nHeated steering wheel\nAdaptive cruise control\nSuper Cruise highway driving assist\nHead-up instrument display\n360-degree camera system\nNight vision\nHands-free power liftgate\nShould I Buy the 2025 Cadillac XT6?\n\nThe Cadillac XT6 is right in the thick of the three-row luxury SUV battle. Working in its favor is an ample lineup of tech and safety features, not to mention a fuel-efficient turbo four-cylinder that’s decently powerful for most driving situations. The optional V-6 does have the edge in performance, of course, and it doesn’t equate to a massive drop in mpg, either. Cargo room with every seat occupied gets tight, however, and the interior ambiance isn’t opulent enough for the price Cadillac asks. Thankfully, the XT6’s infotainment system is excellent, and it responds quickly to touchscreen commands.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Cadillac XT6?\n\nThe 2024 Cadillac XT6 is a three-row luxury mid-size SUV with seating for six or seven people, depending on whether a second-row bench or dual captain’s chairs are ordered. Available with front- or all-wheel drive, the XT6 comes standard with a 237-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder. Optional is a 310-hp, 3.6-liter V-6 that packs more straight-line punch. The XT6’s competitors include the Acura MDX, Infiniti QX60, Lexus TX and Volvo XC90. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Cadillac XT6? \n\nIn addition to a few new exterior colors, the XT6 gets Blue, Bronze and Red Accent Packages on the Sport trim that add color-matched exterior accents.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Cadillac XT6 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n8-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nWi-Fi hot spot \nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nSix USB ports\nSatellite radio\nTri-zone climate control\nBlind spot warning\nDriver attention monitor\nBose audio system\nHeated front seats\nRemote start\nPower liftgate\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nWireless device charging\nPower-folding third row\nRear camera mirror\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated rear outboard seats\nHeated steering wheel\nAdaptive cruise control\nSuper Cruise highway driving assist\nHead-up instrument display\n360-degree camera system\nNight vision \nHands-free power liftgate\nShould I Buy the 2024 Cadillac XT6?\n\nThe Cadillac XT6 is right in the thick of the luxury three-row SUV battle. Working in its favor is an ample lineup of tech and safety features, not to mention a fuel-efficient turbo four-cylinder that’s decently powerful for most driving situations. This engine gets decent fuel economy, though it misses a beat (or two) if you’re after swift acceleration. The optional V-6 does have the edge in performance, of course, and it doesn’t equate to a massive drop in fuel economy, either. Cargo room with every seat occupied gets tight, however, and the interior ambiance isn’t really opulent enough for the prices Cadillac asks. Thankfully, the XT6’s infotainment system is excellent, and it responds quickly to touchscreen commands.",

      "expert_review": "Cadillac is in the midst of a product rollout to fill holes in its lineup that lagged the market shift to SUVs, having just added the XT4 small utility for 2019. The latest addition is the 2020 XT6 that fills a big gap below the super-sized (and super-priced) Escalade.\n\nRelated: 2020 Cadillac XT5 Adds More Standard Tech, New Base Engine\n\nLike the GMC Acadia with which it shares its DNA, the new mid-size XT6 is a “tweener” with a modest third row rather than a full-on three-row model, leaving a gap in the lineup with the full-size, truck-based Escalade and its even more capacious ESV stretch variant. And there is an even bigger gap in price, with the ‘Slade starting more than $20,000 higher.\n\nThe XT6 seats seven with a second-row bench or six with optional captain’s chairs and is offered in just two trim levels: Premium Luxury with a bit more bling and a Sport version with black trimmings and some added performance bits. The two reflect Cadillac’s current “Y strategy” for trim levels that diverge into a luxury track or a sportier track. Both XT6 variants offer a Platinum package with additional upscale trimmings, as well as additional tech and feature packages, but the choices still remain relatively simple compared with European brands’ a la carte menus.\n\n2020 Cadillac XT6 Premium Luxury | Cars.com photo by Fred Meier\n\nI drove both trim levels — each with additional packages — on Washington, D.C., streets and in the Virginia foothills at a Cadillac drive event. (Per our ethics policy, Cars.com pays for its own lodging and travel for such automaker-sponsored events.) The event also included a preview of the refreshed 2020 XT5, Cadillac’s global best-seller and its contestant in the red-hot luxury compact SUV market.\n\nA day in the new XT6, which is on sale now, revealed it to be a capable and comfortable SUV without glaring faults, but also one that doesn’t raise the bar for the breed with the kind of surprises or additional variants — or “presence” — that rival Lincoln brought to the SUV party with the new Aviator. Other premium rivals, by size and price, include the Acura MDX and Audi Q7.\n\n2020 Cadillac XT6 Sport | Cars.com photo by Fred Meier\nHow It Drives\n\nThe standard (and only) power is GM’s ubiquitous 310-horsepower V-6 that puts out 271 pounds-feet of torque, mated to a nine-speed automatic transmission and front- or all-wheel drive. The competent V-6 is up to the job, with strong power delivery and adequate, if not flashy, acceleration, both off-the-line and in mid-range passing or on-ramps. The transmission is well-behaved, with smooth shifts and willing downshifts, and the tuning is well-matched with the V-6 in this SUV. It does seem a little noisy when pushed, not intruding on the quiet cabin but sounding a little coarser than I expected in a luxury SUV. The automatic engine stop-start is very smooth and no doubt helps with the XT6’s EPA-estimated 20 mpg combined, but it also comes with an off switch.\n\nThe XT6 is no sports sedan, but its driving manners are more carlike and agile than its size would lead you to expect. It’s a fairly big SUV but feels smaller, with modest lean in corners and controlled body motion. That is especially true with the Sport trim level, which includes an adaptive suspension (optional on the Premium Luxury), as well as a quicker steering ratio and sportier transmission tuning. A bonus with the adaptive suspension is noticeably better ride quality both on city streets and on the highway. The standard suspension also had a smooth ride but seemed busier and bumpier by comparison.\n\n2020 Cadillac XT6 Sport | Cars.com photo by Fred Meier\n\nThe Sport also gets its own torque-vectoring all-wheel-drive system with an electronically controlled dual-clutch rear differential that can shift torque side to side. It provided improved cornering and understeer, and added a feel of rear bias.\n\nThe variable steering was light enough for parking lots but firmed up nicely at speed, and it was precise though without much road feedback. Braking was strong and pedal feel was linear.\n\nOn balance, the XT6 is well-behaved and comfortable, though also unexceptional, and its overall appeal would benefit from a more exciting power option. The tow rating is a relatively modest 4,000 pounds, but if your needs are more substantial or you tow a lot, the Escalade is Cadillac’s better choice.\n\n2020 Cadillac XT6 Sport | Cars.com photo by Fred Meier\nDoes It Say Luxury\n\nWhether the vehicle says luxury tends to matter to luxury buyers. Comparisons to the Lincoln Aviator are inevitable, and in both exterior and interior design, the XT6 simply has a less luxurious presence. It also offers no high-end upgrades, such as a fancy Black Label trim level or the coming 400-plus-horsepower hybrid Aviator. The front end has some of the edgier look of Cadillac’s Escala concept, but the XT-6’s sedate look overall is the least edgy in the Cadillac lineup. Inside, the materials and trim are high-quality and authentic, with real wood veneers or carbon fiber, but the look is similarly generic next to the high-style Aviator and much of the European competition, not to mention the in-house XT4 and XT5. If you’re looking at it next to an Acura MDX, it’s more than competitive (at least until a new-generation MDX rolls out), but that would hardly seem to be Cadillac’s — or an XT6 buyer’s — highest aspiration.\n\nThe XT6 also has some luxury detail lapses, such as windows that are one-touch-down all around, but aren’t one-touch-up for the rear doors. Also, a configurable instrument cluster is an option even though this feature is standard in many lesser vehicles now. And where are the surprise-and-delight options such as fancy massaging seats, cabin aromatherapy or fancy display graphics? A small slice of people might take these options, just as few will opt for others’ over-the-top trim levels with nosebleed prices, but they do have a halo effect on the whole line.\n\n2020 Cadillac XT6 Premium Luxury | Cars.com photo by Fred Meier\nWell-Equipped, Including Safety Tech\n\nStill, the XT6 in either trim level comes with an impressive array of standard equipment, from a power panoramic moonroof, a power-folding third row, a heated steering wheel and front seats, tri-zone climate control, a power tilt-and-telescope steering wheel, a hands-free power liftgate, LED front and rear lighting, eight-speaker Bose audio, wireless phone charging and both USB-A and newer USB-C ports for the first two rows and a pair of USB-C ports for the third row. It also gets Cadillac’s latest-generation media system with a knob-and-button “joystick” controller on the center console along with the touchscreen.\n\nAlso standard, and important for such an SUV, is more than adequate interior storage, including ample bins in front, a pull-out storage drawer for the second-row seat and removable underfloor storage in the cargo area that also stores the cargo cover.\n\n2020 Cadillac XT6 Sport | Cars.com photo by Fred Meier\n\nMore important, the XT6 has a load of standard safety and driver assistance tech (as many GM products do not) that includes a low-speed (up to 50 mph) front collision prevention system with automatic braking and pedestrian detection, front and rear parking sensors, a blind spot monitor with rear cross-traffic alert, auto-dimming inside and outside mirrors, lane departure warning, lane keeping assist, automatic high beams and cornering lamps. Available option packages add adaptive cruise control, a higher-speed front collision system, rear automatic braking and pedestrian alert, a video rearview mirror, a very capable 360-degree camera system, head-up display, an automatic parking system and a slick infrared night vision system that displays on the dash and alerts to upcoming hazards.\n\n2020 Cadillac XT6 Sport | Cars.com photo by Fred Meier\nGood Enough\n\nThe XT6 puts Cadillac on the board in the three-row competition but seems like more of an effort to fill the slot quickly and be good enough. It is a much nicer Acadia. It is very competitive on price and features, starting at $53,690 including destination, with the entry prices for similar-size rival SUVs including the MDX, Aviator and Q7. And while the latter two offer more variety in features and powertrains, they also can climb to near an Escalade’s price if you check all the boxes. Compare rival prices and features here and get more information on XT6 pricing here. The XT6 was enjoyable and comfortable to drive but also unremarkable, and it feels a little like a placeholder. It looks like we’ll have to wait for a next-generation XT6 to see if Cadillac can break out with something truly distinctive in a three-row SUV.\n\n2020 Cadillac XT6 Sport | Cars.com photo by Fred Meier\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Cadillac XT6?\n\nThe Cadillac XT6 is a three-row mid-size luxury SUV with seating for six or seven people. Available with front- or all-wheel drive, the XT6 has two engines to choose from: the standard 237-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder and an optional 310-hp, 3.6-liter V-6. As you’d expect, the turbo-four is better when it comes to fuel economy, but the V-6 packs more punch when you hit the gas pedal. Both engines are coupled with a nine-speed automatic transmission. Rivals to the XT6 include the Lincoln Aviator, Infiniti QX60, Mercedes-Benz GLE and Acura MDX.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Cadillac XT6?\n\nThe 2023 XT6 rolls into the new model year with relatively few changes. Heated and ventilated front seats and heated second-row seats are now standard on the Premium Luxury and Sport trims, as is onboard navigation. Three new exterior colors have also been added: Radiant Red, Opulent Blue and Argent Silver.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Cadillac XT6 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n8-inch touchscreen multimedia system\n4G LTE Wi-Fi hot spot\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nSix USB ports\nTri-zone climate control\nBlind spot warning\nDriver attention monitor\nBose audio system\nHeated front seats\nRemote start\nPower liftgate\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane keeping assist\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nWireless smartphone charging\nPower-folding third row\nRear camera mirror\nAdaptive cruise control\nSuper Cruise drive assist\nHead-up display\n360-degree parking camera\nNight vision\nShould I Buy the 2023 Cadillac XT6?\n\nThe XT6 has a lot going for it in terms of quietness and comfort. While the cabin isn’t as opulent as you’ll find in some competing luxury SUVs, its lineup of standard features is ample, and there’s plenty of space for passengers and cargo. The turbo four-cylinder engine is fine for daily driving needs, and the optional V-6 gives the XT6 much more pep for those who want it. In the plus column, the Cadillac’s infotainment system is user-friendly in how it functions, and standard tech includes wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, six USB ports, satellite radio and a Wi-Fi hot spot.",
