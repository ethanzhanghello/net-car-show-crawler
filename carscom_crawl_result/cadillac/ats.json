      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Cadillac ATS?\n\nThe compact ATS serves as a direct competitor to the BMW 3 Series for GM's luxury brand, but Cadillac has dropped the sedan version, leaving only a two-door coupe. The ATS coupe is available with a 272-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine or a 335-hp, 3.6-liter V-6. Both engines are available with rear- or all-wheel drive. A high-performance ATS-V coupe comes with a 464-hp, twin-turbo 3.6-liter V-6, rear-wheel drive and the choice of a six-speed manual or eight-speed automatic transmission.\n\nWhat's New on the 2019 Cadillac ATS?\n\nIn addition to dropping the sedan body style, Cadillac has discontinued the six-speed manual transmission for the regular ATS. ATS models have a standard eight-speed automatic. A Pedestal Edition trim package for the ATS-V includes carbon-fiber interior trim, Recaro seats, black exterior trim, painted alloy wheels and red Brembo brake calipers.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Cadillac ATS Are Most Important?\n\nAll ATS models provide crisp handling and a fun-to-drive demeanor, as well as spirited acceleration; the ATS-V elevates those qualities to higher levels. Being able to choose a four-cylinder or V-6 and rear- or all-wheel drive on ATS models is a plus. The ATS also comes with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity, plus the CUE multimedia system, which was improved for 2018 but can still be frustrating to operate.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Cadillac ATS?\n\nWe probably would have answered \"maybe\" if asked this question about the 2018 ATS, because of the availability of a sedan, but with a coupe-only lineup for 2019 the ATS is harder to recommend. The coupe has the same drawbacks as the sedan, with its tight interior and limited cargo space, and the lack of rear doors makes it harder to get in and out of the backseat. Because of its handling ability, the ATS still appeals as a luxury joy ride, but its practical aspects have slid.",

      "expert_review": "The 2013 Cadillac ATS is GM’s luxury brand’s latest attempt to compete in the compact sport sedan class. This is a company whose previous compact efforts included the Cimarron (the 1980s poster car for “badge engineering”) and the Catera (a rebadged Opel that counted among its spokes-mammals both supermodel Cindy Crawford and a cartoon duck). Kids, I truly wish I were making that up.\n\nWith its excellent dynamics and quality interior, the new 2013 ATS finally drives Cadillac into the ranks of world-class compact sport sedans, driving memories of its previous debacles into the recesses of your mind.\n\nYou might be experiencing déjà vu, because Cadillac previously presented its CTS sedan as a player in the class dominated by BMW’s 3 Series. Well, the CTS was always larger, and in preparation for the ATS, which starts at $33,990 (including an $895 destination charge), Cadillac has discontinued the base CTS sedan, which for 2012 was priced at $36,810. For 2013, the CTS sedan line starts with the Luxury trim, priced at $39,990.\n\nTo use the BMW 3 Series for comparison, there’s now a 328i and a 335i, each of which has a turbocharged engine (a four-cylinder and six-cylinder, respectively). Cadillac introduces the ATS 2.0L Turbo and ATS 3.6L, named for their turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder and normally aspirated 3.6-liter V-6 engines. The ATS also has a base engine, a normally aspirated 2.5-liter four-cylinder. Compare the ATS and 3 Series versions of your choice here.\n\nAll ATS engines mate to a six-speed automatic transmission, but only the 2.0L offers a manual as a “delete option” that knocks $1,180 off the price of lower trim levels, $1,280 off the Performance and $1,475 off the Premium. All-wheel drive is optional on the 2.0L and 3.6L. The 2.5L is rear-wheel drive only. In addition to the base ATS, the car comes in Luxury, Performance and Premium trim levels — or “collections,” as Cadillac calls them. The 3.6L starts with the Luxury trim. I drove almost every combination. See the most affordable versions of each compared here.\n\nChoice of Power\nEndowed with 202 horsepower and 191 pounds-feet of torque, the 2.5L accelerates from zero to 60 mph in roughly 7.5 seconds. It’s a decent clip, but it feels poky sometimes because the car’s suspension can harness much more. The 3 Series no longer includes an engine this modestly powered.\n\nThe ATS 2.0L makes 272 hp and 260 pounds-feet of torque, and it feels similar to BMW’s turbo four: plenty of low-rev torque and quick sprints. When equipped with rear-wheel drive, the 2.0L hits 60 mph in 5.7 seconds with the automatic and 5.8 seconds with the manual, according to Cadillac.\n\nThe 3.6L’s V-6 generates 321 hp but only 275 pounds-feet of torque, so it didn’t feel much quicker than the 2.0L in normal driving. The 2.0L’s turbo engine hits its torque peak around 1,700 rpm and stays there through 5,500 rpm while the 3.6L’s V-6 peaks closer to 5,000 rpm — in a car with a 7,200-rpm redline. Only when it was truly wound out did the V-6 earn its keep. Cadillac estimates its zero-to-60 time at 5.4 seconds.\n\nIf the acceleration estimates are correct, the ATS’ more powerful variants essentially match the 328i and 335i sedans, even though the ATS has horsepower and weight advantages over comparable automatic BMWs: The 2.0L has 32 more hp and is 88 pounds lighter than the 328i, and the 3.6L has 21 more hp and is 133 pounds lighter than the 335i. However, the 3 Series’ eight-speed transmission is an advantage in its own right.\n\nThe base ATS 2.5L has EPA-estimated mileage ratings of 22/33/26 mpg city/highway/combined. The 2.0L is rated 21/31/24 mpg, and the 3.6L is 19/28/22 mpg. (All mileage specs cited are for automatic, rear-drive versions. With all-wheel drive, the combined mileage is the same for the 2.0L and 1 mpg lower for the 3.6L, at 21 mpg.) BMW’s EPA-estimated ratings are 23/33/26 mpg for both the 328i and the 335i. Another advantage for Cadillac is that the 2.5L and 3.6L use regular gas. The 2.0L prefers premium for full output but can also run on regular, Cadillac says.\n\nThe ATS’ standard automatic transmission is a no-nonsense unit with Touring, Sport and Snow modes. You can also shift manually by moving the gloriously conventional gear selector to the left and then pushing it forward and back. (Metal steering-wheel shift paddles come only on the Performance and Premium trim levels.) The transmission upshifts smoothly and doesn’t dally when you call for passing power. It’s more responsive than the CTS’ automatic, which I’ve criticized for excessive lag.\n\nAlthough I love manual transmissions, I’m lukewarm on the execution of the 2.0L. When you hit the clutch and let off the gas to upshift, the engine speed drops so lazily that it’s not rev-matched enough when you let the clutch back out. The transmission bucks back as a result in the lower gears. I also found it too easy to catch the Reverse gate, which is to the left, when going for 1st or 2nd gear. You can rev-match better on the downshift because the accelerator doesn’t exhibit too much lag, especially when Sport mode is engaged, as it makes the throttle more sensitive.\n\nThe ATS does a pretty good job of damping out engine sounds — always a concern with the capable but raucous Ecotec engine family. BMW’s turbo-four sounds faintly diesel at idle but improves with speed. Of the three ATS engines I drove, the sound of the 3.6 stood out to me — and not in a positive way. I quickly tired of the engine’s droning sound when cruising on the highway. Otherwise, the ATS’ cabin is admirably quiet, with the main source of noise being the tires, plus the occasional wisp of wind noise.\n\nRide Quality\nThe ATS’ ride quality is confident and comfortable. A difference of 1 inch in wheel diameter isn’t always noticeable, but I found the 2.5L with its 17-inch wheels to ride a little softer than the other versions I drove, which had 18-inch wheels. The difference was felt mainly over rippled surfaces and tar patches.\n\nAll engines and trims come with the same suspension, except for the Premium trim level with rear-wheel drive, which includes Magnetic Ride Control, or MRC. This adaptive suspension automatically adjusts shock-absorber firmness on the fly to match road conditions. It teams with upgraded Brembo brakes and Bridgestone Potenza summer performance tires.\n\nIt seems unwise that all-season tires aren’t offered with MRC. At minimum, all-season tires should be a no-cost option. Cadillac recommends winter tires for use in appropriate climates, and dealerships should be happy to oblige, but I don’t see why these or all-season tires aren’t an official option.\n\nHandling\nThe ATS’ handling is the car’s claim to potential fame. Several Cadillac models have been introduced since the 2003 CTS sedan set the company’s new tone for world-class athleticism, yet none has come close — until now. With its balanced weight distribution, light weight (hardly a GM strong suit) and meticulously tuned suspension, the car has great reflexes both on the road and on the track.\n\nI took a few blistering laps in a 2.0L manual and a 3.6L automatic at Atlanta Motorsports Park. The Bridgestone summer tires were fantastic and very well-matched to the cars, both of which had the MRC suspension.\n\nRobbing the ATS 2.0L Turbo of its composure was like trying to get a reaction out of a Buckingham Palace guard. I kept adding more and more speed through the hairpins, trying to unsettle it, with limited success. Only with the added power of the V-6 was I able to induce some under- and oversteer. Were it not for the electronic stability system’s Competition mode — a provision that comes only with the MRC suspension and allows more sliding — the dynamics would have been so good as to be boring.\n\nThe V-6 immediately felt more nose-heavy to me than the four-cylinder cars. Cadillac says it shifts the weight distribution forward to 51.5/48.5 percent front/rear, versus 50.1/49.9 with the 2.0L manual. That might not seem like much, but it was my first impression both on the track and on the road.\n\nThe electric power steering is precise and well-tuned — not the best feedback I’ve experienced, but certainly not the worst. The brakes were similar — also not the best feedback and pedal feel, but fine controllability, very linear on application and decent on release. That held true with both the standard and Brembo brakes.\n\nIn the Cabin\nWithout a doubt, the ATS feels a lot like the recently redesigned 3 Series sedan, with comparable attributes inside as well. The backseat has more than an inch less legroom than the 3 Series, feeling similarly snug, and my legs were raised more than I would like. Mostly I noticed the 0.9 inch less headroom, which made it just workable for me at 6 feet tall. The long front-seat travel, however, provided legroom for people taller than me.\n\nThe cabin is well-appointed, with high quality materials like aluminum, wood and carbon fiber. The optional Cadillac User Experience system with its advanced touch-screen is sure to appeal to people wary of multifunction controller knobs, but I don’t think history will be kind to the touch-sensitive “capacitive” non-buttons it also uses. I know I won’t be.\n\nSafety\nIn National Highway Traffic Safety Administration tests, the Cadillac ATS received top scores of five stars out of five in every category — frontal and side-impact crash tests and rollover resistance — for a five-star overall score.\n\nAs is required of all new cars as of the 2012 model year, the ATS has antilock brakes and an electronic stability system with traction control. Also standard are frontal, knee and side-impact torso airbags for the front seats, as well as side curtains alongside the side windows. Side-impact torso airbags are optional for the backseat starting with the Luxury trim level.\n\nOptional active-safety features include forward collision warning, lane departure warning, a backup camera, and front and rear parking sensors. OnStar is included with one year of free service.\n\nParents who might ferry children in the ATS should check out our Car Seat Check here. View all the safety features here.\n\nATS in the Market\nOverall, Cadillac seems to have done a good job squaring up against BMW, for better and for worse. For example, you can get an advanced head-up display … and you can also pay extra for items like leather upholstery and a folding backseat. That’s definitely meeting the competition on its own turf.\n\nBMW’s compact-luxury king has been “gone after,” “gunned for” and “taken on” more than any model in the market, and still his highness remains on the throne, his anteroom littered with bones. We’ll need more time with the ATS to know whether it’s merely a pretender to the throne. So far, it looks as close as any challenger to date.\n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in January 2013 about the 2013 Cadillac ATS. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2014, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe 2013 Cadillac ATS is GM’s luxury brand’s latest attempt to compete in the compact sport sedan class. This is a company whose previous compact efforts included the Cimarron (the 1980s poster car for “badge engineering”) and the Catera (a rebadged Opel that counted among its spokes-mammals both supermodel Cindy Crawford and a cartoon duck). Kids, I truly wish I were making that up.\n\nWith its excellent dynamics and quality interior, the new 2013 ATS finally drives Cadillac into the ranks of world-class compact sport sedans, driving memories of its previous debacles into the recesses of your mind.\n\nYou might be experiencing déjà vu, because Cadillac previously presented its CTS sedan as a player in the class dominated by BMW’s 3 Series. Well, the CTS was always larger, and in preparation for the ATS, which starts at $33,990 (including an $895 destination charge), Cadillac has discontinued the base CTS sedan, which for 2012 was priced at $36,810. For 2013, the CTS sedan line starts with the Luxury trim, priced at $39,990.\n\nTo use the BMW 3 Series for comparison, there’s now a 328i and a 335i, each of which has a turbocharged engine (a four-cylinder and six-cylinder, respectively). Cadillac introduces the ATS 2.0L Turbo and ATS 3.6L, named for their turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder and normally aspirated 3.6-liter V-6 engines. The ATS also has a base engine, a normally aspirated 2.5-liter four-cylinder. Compare the ATS and 3 Series versions of your choice here.\n\nAll ATS engines mate to a six-speed automatic transmission, but only the 2.0L offers a manual as a “delete option” that knocks $1,180 off the price of lower trim levels, $1,280 off the Performance and $1,475 off the Premium. All-wheel drive is optional on the 2.0L and 3.6L. The 2.5L is rear-wheel drive only. In addition to the base ATS, the car comes in Luxury, Performance and Premium trim levels — or “collections,” as Cadillac calls them. The 3.6L starts with the Luxury trim. I drove almost every combination. See the most affordable versions of each compared here.\n\nChoice of Power\nEndowed with 202 horsepower and 191 pounds-feet of torque, the 2.5L accelerates from zero to 60 mph in roughly 7.5 seconds. It’s a decent clip, but it feels poky sometimes because the car’s suspension can harness much more. The 3 Series no longer includes an engine this modestly powered.\n\nThe ATS 2.0L makes 272 hp and 260 pounds-feet of torque, and it feels similar to BMW’s turbo four: plenty of low-rev torque and quick sprints. When equipped with rear-wheel drive, the 2.0L hits 60 mph in 5.7 seconds with the automatic and 5.8 seconds with the manual, according to Cadillac.\n\nThe 3.6L’s V-6 generates 321 hp but only 275 pounds-feet of torque, so it didn’t feel much quicker than the 2.0L in normal driving. The 2.0L’s turbo engine hits its torque peak around 1,700 rpm and stays there through 5,500 rpm while the 3.6L’s V-6 peaks closer to 5,000 rpm — in a car with a 7,200-rpm redline. Only when it was truly wound out did the V-6 earn its keep. Cadillac estimates its zero-to-60 time at 5.4 seconds.\n\nIf the acceleration estimates are correct, the ATS’ more powerful variants essentially match the 328i and 335i sedans, even though the ATS has horsepower and weight advantages over comparable automatic BMWs: The 2.0L has 32 more hp and is 88 pounds lighter than the 328i, and the 3.6L has 21 more hp and is 133 pounds lighter than the 335i. However, the 3 Series’ eight-speed transmission is an advantage in its own right.\n\nThe base ATS 2.5L has EPA-estimated mileage ratings of 22/33/26 mpg city/highway/combined. The 2.0L is rated 21/31/24 mpg, and the 3.6L is 19/28/22 mpg. (All mileage specs cited are for automatic, rear-drive versions. With all-wheel drive, the combined mileage is the same for the 2.0L and 1 mpg lower for the 3.6L, at 21 mpg.) BMW’s EPA-estimated ratings are 23/33/26 mpg for both the 328i and the 335i. Another advantage for Cadillac is that the 2.5L and 3.6L use regular gas. The 2.0L prefers premium for full output but can also run on regular, Cadillac says.\n\nThe ATS’ standard automatic transmission is a no-nonsense unit with Touring, Sport and Snow modes. You can also shift manually by moving the gloriously conventional gear selector to the left and then pushing it forward and back. (Metal steering-wheel shift paddles come only on the Performance and Premium trim levels.) The transmission upshifts smoothly and doesn’t dally when you call for passing power. It’s more responsive than the CTS’ automatic, which I’ve criticized for excessive lag.\n\nAlthough I love manual transmissions, I’m lukewarm on the execution of the 2.0L. When you hit the clutch and let off the gas to upshift, the engine speed drops so lazily that it’s not rev-matched enough when you let the clutch back out. The transmission bucks back as a result in the lower gears. I also found it too easy to catch the Reverse gate, which is to the left, when going for 1st or 2nd gear. You can rev-match better on the downshift because the accelerator doesn’t exhibit too much lag, especially when Sport mode is engaged, as it makes the throttle more sensitive.\n\nThe ATS does a pretty good job of damping out engine sounds — always a concern with the capable but raucous Ecotec engine family. BMW’s turbo-four sounds faintly diesel at idle but improves with speed. Of the three ATS engines I drove, the sound of the 3.6 stood out to me — and not in a positive way. I quickly tired of the engine’s droning sound when cruising on the highway. Otherwise, the ATS’ cabin is admirably quiet, with the main source of noise being the tires, plus the occasional wisp of wind noise.\n\nRide Quality\nThe ATS’ ride quality is confident and comfortable. A difference of 1 inch in wheel diameter isn’t always noticeable, but I found the 2.5L with its 17-inch wheels to ride a little softer than the other versions I drove, which had 18-inch wheels. The difference was felt mainly over rippled surfaces and tar patches.\n\nAll engines and trims come with the same suspension, except for the Premium trim level with rear-wheel drive, which includes Magnetic Ride Control, or MRC. This adaptive suspension automatically adjusts shock-absorber firmness on the fly to match road conditions. It teams with upgraded Brembo brakes and Bridgestone Potenza summer performance tires.\n\nIt seems unwise that all-season tires aren’t offered with MRC. At minimum, all-season tires should be a no-cost option. Cadillac recommends winter tires for use in appropriate climates, and dealerships should be happy to oblige, but I don’t see why these or all-season tires aren’t an official option.\n\nHandling\nThe ATS’ handling is the car’s claim to potential fame. Several Cadillac models have been introduced since the 2003 CTS sedan set the company’s new tone for world-class athleticism, yet none has come close — until now. With its balanced weight distribution, light weight (hardly a GM strong suit) and meticulously tuned suspension, the car has great reflexes both on the road and on the track.\n\nI took a few blistering laps in a 2.0L manual and a 3.6L automatic at Atlanta Motorsports Park. The Bridgestone summer tires were fantastic and very well-matched to the cars, both of which had the MRC suspension.\n\nRobbing the ATS 2.0L Turbo of its composure was like trying to get a reaction out of a Buckingham Palace guard. I kept adding more and more speed through the hairpins, trying to unsettle it, with limited success. Only with the added power of the V-6 was I able to induce some under- and oversteer. Were it not for the electronic stability system’s Competition mode — a provision that comes only with the MRC suspension and allows more sliding — the dynamics would have been so good as to be boring.\n\nThe V-6 immediately felt more nose-heavy to me than the four-cylinder cars. Cadillac says it shifts the weight distribution forward to 51.5/48.5 percent front/rear, versus 50.1/49.9 with the 2.0L manual. That might not seem like much, but it was my first impression both on the track and on the road.\n\nThe electric power steering is precise and well-tuned — not the best feedback I’ve experienced, but certainly not the worst. The brakes were similar — also not the best feedback and pedal feel, but fine controllability, very linear on application and decent on release. That held true with both the standard and Brembo brakes.\n\nIn the Cabin\nWithout a doubt, the ATS feels a lot like the recently redesigned 3 Series sedan, with comparable attributes inside as well. The backseat has more than an inch less legroom than the 3 Series, feeling similarly snug, and my legs were raised more than I would like. Mostly I noticed the 0.9 inch less headroom, which made it just workable for me at 6 feet tall. The long front-seat travel, however, provided legroom for people taller than me.\n\nThe cabin is well-appointed, with high quality materials like aluminum, wood and carbon fiber. The optional Cadillac User Experience system with its advanced touch-screen is sure to appeal to people wary of multifunction controller knobs, but I don’t think history will be kind to the touch-sensitive “capacitive” non-buttons it also uses. I know I won’t be.\n\nSafety\nIn National Highway Traffic Safety Administration tests, the Cadillac ATS received top scores of five stars out of five in every category — frontal and side-impact crash tests and rollover resistance — for a five-star overall score.\n\nAs is required of all new cars as of the 2012 model year, the ATS has antilock brakes and an electronic stability system with traction control. Also standard are frontal, knee and side-impact torso airbags for the front seats, as well as side curtains alongside the side windows. Side-impact torso airbags are optional for the backseat starting with the Luxury trim level.\n\nOptional active-safety features include forward collision warning, lane departure warning, a backup camera, and front and rear parking sensors. OnStar is included with one year of free service.\n\nParents who might ferry children in the ATS should check out our Car Seat Check here. View all the safety features here.\n\nATS in the Market\nOverall, Cadillac seems to have done a good job squaring up against BMW, for better and for worse. For example, you can get an advanced head-up display … and you can also pay extra for items like leather upholstery and a folding backseat. That’s definitely meeting the competition on its own turf.\n\nBMW’s compact-luxury king has been “gone after,” “gunned for” and “taken on” more than any model in the market, and still his highness remains on the throne, his anteroom littered with bones. We’ll need more time with the ATS to know whether it’s merely a pretender to the throne. So far, it looks as close as any challenger to date.\n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "Despite being on the older side of the class, the 2017 Cadillac ATS holds its own against more recently redesigned compact luxury sports sedans. I tested the ATS during Cars.com’s Luxury Sports Sedan Challenge, in which we pitted the ATS 2.0L Turbo against the BMW 330i, Audi A4, Mercedes-Benz C300, Alfa Romeo Giulia, Jaguar XE and Lexus IS 200t. The ATS finished fourth, beating the BMW 3 Series and standing out in a few key areas.\n\nOur 2.0L Turbo Luxury Coupe trim had rear-wheel drive and a new-for-2017 Carbon Black appearance package, which gave it the look of a mini ATS-V. \n\nHow It Drives\n\nDuring the Luxury Sports Sedan Challenge, the ATS Sedan was a favorite of mine both on our tight handling course and while careening though the sweeping backroads of northern Georgia. The ATS wasn’t the fastest, but it had the most connected-feeling driving experience, with direct, natural steering that was perfectly weighted and acutely communicated what the front and rear of the car were doing. The way the rear-wheel-drive ATS hunkers down mid-corner and can slide around with the throttle exiting a corner is big fun.\n\nThe Cadillac ATS doesn’t ride too roughly at highway speeds, but it’s busy on less than perfect roads. The rear-drive spirited handling payoff is worth it, however. Competitors like the 3 Series and C-Class require optional suspensions to get the most sporting character out of them, while the ATS does it without any expensive suspension or ATS-V performance options. Our test car was equipped with the base suspension and all-season tires, so the experience would only intensify with the optional, higher-performance suspension, plus summer tires and a limited-slip rear differential.\n\nA 272-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder scoots the ATS to 60 mph in 6.2 seconds and to the quarter-mile in 14.3 seconds at 97.9 mph. That was quick enough for fourth place in our 60-mph sprint and third place in the quarter-mile; both times are nearly identical with the 2017 BMW 330i.\n\nThe Cadillac’s engine is strong and responsive, but it sounds gravelly compared with the smoother, more-refined sounds of competitors, including the BMW.\n\nA six-speed manual transmission is standard, but the ATS Coupe we drove came with the eight-speed automatic transmission. Having eight gears in this class is now more normal than not. The Cadillac hiccupped during spirited driving and banged uncomfortably on upshifts, and at times wouldn’t downshift when I wanted it to in its more aggressive driving modes.\n\nOur ATS Luxury didn’t have the steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters that some of its competitors did, but rather a gear selector with a manual mode that wasn’t as quick-shifting as others. Paddle shifters are available on the ATS, but the Luxury trim we tested doesn’t have them.    \n\nInterior Room and Quality\n\nThe Cadillac ATS puts the “compact” in compact luxury sedan. Its backseat is tiny compared with bigger-overall cars like the Audi A4 and Mercedes-Benz C300, and it’s made worse by the optional, bulky Recaro front sport seats. Those Recaros are spectacular at keeping you planted while throwing the car around corners — and they look cool, too — but their heavily arched backing cuts into backseat room, and the lack of adjustable head restraints makes the fitment questionable for some.\n\nEven without the Recaros, seating both in front and back feels narrow and snug. The ATS’ 10.4 cubic feet of trunk space is small compared with the 13 cubic feet in competitors like the Audi A4 and BMW 3 Series. You can compare them all side by side here.  \n\nEven if the new Cadillac ATS is on the snug side, its quality makes it a nice place to be for the as-tested $45,830 – the midsize CTS and CTS-V are longer. Materials are soft and appropriately luxurious (though not class-leading), and the optional Carbon Black appearance package adds real carbon-fiber interior accents.\n\nThe interior’s downfall is the center dashboard’s piano-black face and dull-silver touch-sensitive buttons; the look isn’t as luxurious as an Audi A4’s high-quality dials, tactile controls and digital readouts. The Cadillac’s whole touchscreen faceplate flips up to reveal a small storage cubby that’s made smaller by an optional wireless charging pad. The feature cheapens the interior because it’s not a very rigid construction, exhibiting lots of play while opening and closing. \n\nCUE the Complaining\n\nCadillac has been hit with complaints from both us and consumers over its complicated Cadillac User Experience system for controlling multimedia, vehicle and climate systems, but there’s now a decent workaround at least for the media and phone aspects in the form of standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. The integrations of each are designed to incorporate your phone’s navigation into the main touchscreen. They also make streaming audio, making and taking calls, and voice texting easier by acting as their own interface, circumventing some of CUE’s annoyances. It’s not a fix for everything, considering the whole center dashboard is filled with capacitive controls that are still more demanding to use than a regular volume knob, but it’s a decent workaround.\n\nSafety\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gave the ATS its highest overall rating of five stars. The ATS hasn’t yet been tested by our preferred test organization, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.\n\nSeveral crash-avoidance technologies are offered, though few were equipped on our $45,000 test car. A lane departure prevention system, forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, and blind spot warning are all optional. A backup camera is standard on all trims, and the Luxury trim we tested included front and rear parking sensors.\n\nIs the ATS Worth It?\n\nOur $45,830 as-tested Cadillac ATS was the least expensive car in Cars.com’s Luxury Sports Sedan Challenge. That’s significant because the ATS didn’t lack important convenience features compared with more expensive competitors, and it finished a respectable fourth out of seven cars. A heated steering wheel, real leather seats (not leatherette like the BMW and Mercedes we tested), wireless phone charging and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration are all part of the as-tested ATS, which also packs an undeniably good driving experience.\n\nThe Cadillac ATS didn’t finish higher than fourth because its small size affected front and backseat scores, cargo room and Car Seat Check scores. It’s not a sedan that pulls off family duty as easily as larger competitors, and even as a second car to an SUV, the ATS would be pushing it for occasional family use. Still, you get a lot for the money. Our judges scored the ATS an 8.5 out of 10 on the value scale, which topped all competitors.",

      "expert_review": "Featuring top-notch driving dynamics, a comfortable ride and classy styling, the Cadillac ATS coupe is almost ready to out-German the Germans; terrible touch-sensitive controls and cheap gauges are holding it back, though.\n\nCadillac is looking to up its game versus the German luxury brands, taking the fight to BMW and Mercedes-Benz with products designed to go toe-to-toe with their best. Rear-wheel-drive platforms, lightweight designs, sharp handling — and now, a compact coupe based on the ATS sedan to match up with the BMW 4 Series, Audi A5 and Lexus RC 350 (the Mercedes-Benz C-Class coupe hasn’t been updated to match its new sedan yet).\n\nDebuting for 2015, the new ATS coupe is arriving two years after the sedan was introduced and provides an alternative for the admittedly limited number of buyers shopping for a personal luxury coupe. Featuring two of the sedan’s three engines, revised two-door bodywork and some suspension changes, the coupe isn’t all that different from the sedan on paper. Is it good enough, then, to bring legions of BMW coupe buyers out of their repetitive buying habits and into something American?\n\nExterior & Styling\nWhen the car was unveiled, I initially lamented the fact that the ATS coupe didn’t look all that different from the sedan on which it’s based. The previous generation of the bigger CTS sedan and coupe were very different-looking animals, with the CTS coupe taking on a wildly futuristic, angular look that I absolutely loved — but apparently nobody else did, given Cadillac barely sold any.\n\nThe brand played it safer with the ATS coupe; the car looked good as a four-door, and the changes to create the two-door are definitely on the conservative side. There’s a slightly revised front bumper and grille, and of course there are only two longer doors instead of four. The roof is slightly lower, as well. The front track is wider than the sedan’s, so the front fenders are slightly different to accommodate the additional width between the wheels. Yet the overall effect after you gaze at the car for a few days is really quite classy — more elegant than aggressive. I’m onboard with the styling now.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe Cadillac ATS was already a stellar performer, and the coupe is just that much better. The highlight of the car, without a doubt, is its handling abilities. While my test car, a 2.0T Premium with all-wheel drive and an automatic transmission, did not have the high-end Magnetic Ride Control suspension, it still performed beautifully. Its sport suspension tuning was well-balanced between sporty feel and compliant ride, and the 18-inch wheels handled cratered streets in Ann Arbor, Mich., with surprising aplomb.\n\nSteering feel is outstanding, with effort and feedback that recalls how BMWs used to feel. Body motions are equally well-controlled, with no bobbing or bucking on broken pavement and no odd sensations that make you feel like the car is struggling to maintain its composure. It’s easily a match for the BMW 4 Series, feels a little more communicative than the latest Audi A5 and pretty much blows the Lexus RC 350’s handling out of the water.\n\nThe turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder, which is the midrange engine offering in the sedan, serves as the base engine in the coupe, making 272 horsepower and sending it to either the rear wheels or all four wheels. The optional all-wheel drive means you get a standard six-speed automatic transmission with three selectable drive modes: Touring, Sport and Ice/Snow. Putting the car in the spectacular Ice/Snow mode employs the all-wheel-drive system in bad weather, which made the ATS nigh unstoppable when Ann Arbor got smacked with a winter storm during my test drive.\n\nThe turbo-four provides adequate power to get the ATS up and moving quickly, but you’ll want to keep it in Sport mode if you like frequent brisk acceleration. While not as torquey as the optional V-6, it’s easily competitive with the turbo four-cylinder motors in the 428 and A5. The Lexus RC comes only with a V-6, but it doesn’t feel appreciably faster than the turbocharged Cadillac, likely due to the extra weight it’s lugging around.\n\nThe ATS coupe’s lightness plays a part in its outstanding performance. As tested, my car weighed just more than 3,570 pounds — about 65 pounds lighter than a 428i and almost dead even with the Audi A5. It weighs a significant 320 pounds less than a Lexus RC 350 AWD, but again that car features a bigger, more powerful engine. The four-cylinder ATS coupe can easily keep up with four-cylinder versions of the BMW and Audi as long as its Sport mode is engaged, but you may encounter some situations where you’ll wish you’d popped for the bigger, more expensive V-6.\n\nWhere you won’t make that wish is at the pump, thanks to the ATS coupe’s EPA rating of 20/28/23 mpg city/highway/combined with all-wheel drive. I averaged only about 20 mpg combined, but with my aggressive driving it’s no mystery as to why. The all-wheel-drive BMW and Audi are both rated considerably higher than the Cadillac, however, with the 428i garnering a 22/33/26 mpg rating thanks to its eight-speed automatic, while the A5 snags a more comparable 22/31/25 mpg rating. The all-wheel-drive Lexus RC 350 gets a 19/26/21 mpg rating with its standard V-6.\n\nInterior\nThings are a bit cramped in the ATS coupe. It feels a little narrower than some of its competitors, but headroom is ample despite being lower than the four-door. Backseat hip room is considerably less than the sedan; this is a four-seater, as opposed to the sedan’s five-occupant accommodations. Visibility to the front and sides is acceptable, but seeing into your rear blind spots is difficult due to the thicker C-pillars. That’s the price one pays for coupe style.\n\nThe front seats are very comfortable, with an optional leather trim that looks fantastic. My car was done up in optional deep Kona Brown leather that complemented the Black Raven exterior paint beautifully. Most interior materials are also quite good, with high-grade, soft-touch leather and plastic for most surfaces. Compared with the 428i and A5, the ATS coupe feels completely up to par, and it surpasses the substandard dash plastics in the Lexus RC 350.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nWhere the ATS falls short of its German competition is in its controls, displays and multimedia systems, which do not feel as sophisticated or as high-quality. Two areas in particular are woefully inadequate: the center console control panel, which is made up completely of capacitive touch-sensitive buttons, and the standard gauges. For a luxury car to feel luxurious there must be tactile feedback in the controls and switches, and the muted “bump” provided by the Cadillac touch-panel system doesn’t provide this. One has to focus too much on where on the panel to touch, and oftentimes more than one touch is required to activate a function, be it climate control, radio volume, etc. It’s not a pleasant control system, and combined with the still-problematic Cadillac User Experience multimedia system, it nearly ruins the entire experience of driving the ATS. For many prospective buyers, I’m sure it will be a deal-killer.\n\nThe other area that feels cheap is the set of standard gauges behind the steering wheel. It’s a three-dial affair that looks ridiculously plain in an otherwise upscale luxury coupe. The display looks like something from General Motors’ cheapo 1980s days, when budgets and bean counters outranked stylists and engineers. A more sophisticated, all-electronic display available on the larger CTS would remedy this issue, but it’s not available on the ATS. For a coupe that costs more than $50,000, this is just unacceptable.\n\nAn available head-up display projects limited information onto the windshield (and remarkably does not disappear when one puts on sunglasses, as it does in BMWs), but this isn’t enough to overlook these two glaring flaws in an otherwise well-done cabin.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe ATS coupe features as much cargo room as the sedan version, with 10.4 cubic feet. A split, folding backseat is standard. All that is exactly on par with the Lexus RC 350 coupe, which also features exactly 10.4 cubic feet of room and standard split, folding seats. But the 428i and A5 feature more cargo room in back, with 15.7 and 12.2 cubic feet, respectively.\n\nSafety\nIn National Highway Traffic Safety Administration crash tests, the Cadillac ATS coupe earned five stars across the board — an excellent result. You can see the crash test results here. As for standard safety equipment, the ATS coupe features eight airbags and a backup camera system, but if you’re willing to spend a little extra there are some interesting options available: A Driver Awareness Package includes a vibrating safety alert seat, forward collision alert, lane departure warning, lane keep assist, rain sensing wipers and more. Taking it to the next level involves opting for the Driver Assist Package, which adds adaptive cruise control with stop-start, electronic parking brake, automatic front and rear collision avoidance braking (to prevent you from hitting a pole as you’re backing up, for instance), rear cross-traffic alert and the full color head-up display. See all the ATS’ standard and available safety features here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe Cadillac ATS coupe starts at $38,990 with rear-wheel drive and the 2.0-liter turbo engine; the 2.5-liter non-turbo engine in the base sedan cannot be had in the coupe. The coupe’s price bumps up to $41,440 when all-wheel drive is selected. Four trim levels are available: Base, Luxury, Performance and Premium.\n\nMy test car was a Premium model, which starts at $49,200 but includes a lot of standard equipment, such as a sport suspension, 18-inch wheels, performance seats, navigation, remote keyless entry with remote start, the head-up display, front and rear park assist, the Driver Awareness Package and more. Only two separate options were specified on my car: the $1,295 Kona Brown leather interior and $850 polished 18-inch wheels, for a total sticker price of $51,345, including destination.\n\nStick with a rear-wheel-drive turbo model and forgo the fancy multimedia systems and leather interior, and you can get into an ATS coupe for less than $40,000. Spec out an all-wheel-drive V-6 model with all the options, and you can top $60,000.\n\nThis pricing is perfectly in competition with the major players. The BMW 428i starts at $41,700, a bit more than the ATS coupe, and rises to $43,700 when all-wheel drive is specified. As with most BMWs, however, you’ll start paying through the nose on options. Every paint color except non-metallic white or black costs $550; any leather interior requires the addition of both the Luxury Line and the Premium Package, adding $3,800 right off the bat.\n\nWith options similar to what I had on my ATS coupe test car, the 428i would cost more than $57,000 — quite a premium over the Cadillac. The Audi A5 comes only with quattro all-wheel drive, so the base version costs $40,925. Optioning one up to match my test car brought the A5 to $52,325, quite comparable to the Cadillac. Unlike the Cadillac, both the 428i and A5 have several trim and color combinations for sportier equipment and appearance packages, giving them more versatility and personalization options. The Lexus RC 350 starts at $43,715 for a rear-wheel-drive coupe and $45,950 for the all-wheel-drive version, but as mentioned before it comes with a much larger, more powerful standard engine than its competitors. Optioning the RC 350 up to the same level of features as the others brings it to just more than $52,000, as well. See how these four luxury coupes stack up against each other here.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in March 2015 about the 2015 Cadillac ATS. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2016, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nFeaturing top-notch driving dynamics, a comfortable ride and classy styling, the Cadillac ATS coupe is almost ready to out-German the Germans; terrible touch-sensitive controls and cheap gauges are holding it back, though.\n\nCadillac is looking to up its game versus the German luxury brands, taking the fight to BMW and Mercedes-Benz with products designed to go toe-to-toe with their best. Rear-wheel-drive platforms, lightweight designs, sharp handling — and now, a compact coupe based on the ATS sedan to match up with the BMW 4 Series, Audi A5 and Lexus RC 350 (the Mercedes-Benz C-Class coupe hasn’t been updated to match its new sedan yet).\n\nDebuting for 2015, the new ATS coupe is arriving two years after the sedan was introduced and provides an alternative for the admittedly limited number of buyers shopping for a personal luxury coupe. Featuring two of the sedan’s three engines, revised two-door bodywork and some suspension changes, the coupe isn’t all that different from the sedan on paper. Is it good enough, then, to bring legions of BMW coupe buyers out of their repetitive buying habits and into something American?\n\nExterior & Styling\nWhen the car was unveiled, I initially lamented the fact that the ATS coupe didn’t look all that different from the sedan on which it’s based. The previous generation of the bigger CTS sedan and coupe were very different-looking animals, with the CTS coupe taking on a wildly futuristic, angular look that I absolutely loved — but apparently nobody else did, given Cadillac barely sold any.\n\nThe brand played it safer with the ATS coupe; the car looked good as a four-door, and the changes to create the two-door are definitely on the conservative side. There’s a slightly revised front bumper and grille, and of course there are only two longer doors instead of four. The roof is slightly lower, as well. The front track is wider than the sedan’s, so the front fenders are slightly different to accommodate the additional width between the wheels. Yet the overall effect after you gaze at the car for a few days is really quite classy — more elegant than aggressive. I’m onboard with the styling now.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe Cadillac ATS was already a stellar performer, and the coupe is just that much better. The highlight of the car, without a doubt, is its handling abilities. While my test car, a 2.0T Premium with all-wheel drive and an automatic transmission, did not have the high-end Magnetic Ride Control suspension, it still performed beautifully. Its sport suspension tuning was well-balanced between sporty feel and compliant ride, and the 18-inch wheels handled cratered streets in Ann Arbor, Mich., with surprising aplomb.\n\nSteering feel is outstanding, with effort and feedback that recalls how BMWs used to feel. Body motions are equally well-controlled, with no bobbing or bucking on broken pavement and no odd sensations that make you feel like the car is struggling to maintain its composure. It’s easily a match for the BMW 4 Series, feels a little more communicative than the latest Audi A5 and pretty much blows the Lexus RC 350’s handling out of the water.\n\nThe turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder, which is the midrange engine offering in the sedan, serves as the base engine in the coupe, making 272 horsepower and sending it to either the rear wheels or all four wheels. The optional all-wheel drive means you get a standard six-speed automatic transmission with three selectable drive modes: Touring, Sport and Ice/Snow. Putting the car in the spectacular Ice/Snow mode employs the all-wheel-drive system in bad weather, which made the ATS nigh unstoppable when Ann Arbor got smacked with a winter storm during my test drive.\n\nThe turbo-four provides adequate power to get the ATS up and moving quickly, but you’ll want to keep it in Sport mode if you like frequent brisk acceleration. While not as torquey as the optional V-6, it’s easily competitive with the turbo four-cylinder motors in the 428 and A5. The Lexus RC comes only with a V-6, but it doesn’t feel appreciably faster than the turbocharged Cadillac, likely due to the extra weight it’s lugging around.\n\nThe ATS coupe’s lightness plays a part in its outstanding performance. As tested, my car weighed just more than 3,570 pounds — about 65 pounds lighter than a 428i and almost dead even with the Audi A5. It weighs a significant 320 pounds less than a Lexus RC 350 AWD, but again that car features a bigger, more powerful engine. The four-cylinder ATS coupe can easily keep up with four-cylinder versions of the BMW and Audi as long as its Sport mode is engaged, but you may encounter some situations where you’ll wish you’d popped for the bigger, more expensive V-6.\n\nWhere you won’t make that wish is at the pump, thanks to the ATS coupe’s EPA rating of 20/28/23 mpg city/highway/combined with all-wheel drive. I averaged only about 20 mpg combined, but with my aggressive driving it’s no mystery as to why. The all-wheel-drive BMW and Audi are both rated considerably higher than the Cadillac, however, with the 428i garnering a 22/33/26 mpg rating thanks to its eight-speed automatic, while the A5 snags a more comparable 22/31/25 mpg rating. The all-wheel-drive Lexus RC 350 gets a 19/26/21 mpg rating with its standard V-6.\n\nInterior\nThings are a bit cramped in the ATS coupe. It feels a little narrower than some of its competitors, but headroom is ample despite being lower than the four-door. Backseat hip room is considerably less than the sedan; this is a four-seater, as opposed to the sedan’s five-occupant accommodations. Visibility to the front and sides is acceptable, but seeing into your rear blind spots is difficult due to the thicker C-pillars. That’s the price one pays for coupe style.\n\nThe front seats are very comfortable, with an optional leather trim that looks fantastic. My car was done up in optional deep Kona Brown leather that complemented the Black Raven exterior paint beautifully. Most interior materials are also quite good, with high-grade, soft-touch leather and plastic for most surfaces. Compared with the 428i and A5, the ATS coupe feels completely up to par, and it surpasses the substandard dash plastics in the Lexus RC 350.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nWhere the ATS falls short of its German competition is in its controls, displays and multimedia systems, which do not feel as sophisticated or as high-quality. Two areas in particular are woefully inadequate: the center console control panel, which is made up completely of capacitive touch-sensitive buttons, and the standard gauges. For a luxury car to feel luxurious there must be tactile feedback in the controls and switches, and the muted “bump” provided by the Cadillac touch-panel system doesn’t provide this. One has to focus too much on where on the panel to touch, and oftentimes more than one touch is required to activate a function, be it climate control, radio volume, etc. It’s not a pleasant control system, and combined with the still-problematic Cadillac User Experience multimedia system, it nearly ruins the entire experience of driving the ATS. For many prospective buyers, I’m sure it will be a deal-killer.\n\nThe other area that feels cheap is the set of standard gauges behind the steering wheel. It’s a three-dial affair that looks ridiculously plain in an otherwise upscale luxury coupe. The display looks like something from General Motors’ cheapo 1980s days, when budgets and bean counters outranked stylists and engineers. A more sophisticated, all-electronic display available on the larger CTS would remedy this issue, but it’s not available on the ATS. For a coupe that costs more than $50,000, this is just unacceptable.\n\nAn available head-up display projects limited information onto the windshield (and remarkably does not disappear when one puts on sunglasses, as it does in BMWs), but this isn’t enough to overlook these two glaring flaws in an otherwise well-done cabin.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe ATS coupe features as much cargo room as the sedan version, with 10.4 cubic feet. A split, folding backseat is standard. All that is exactly on par with the Lexus RC 350 coupe, which also features exactly 10.4 cubic feet of room and standard split, folding seats. But the 428i and A5 feature more cargo room in back, with 15.7 and 12.2 cubic feet, respectively.\n\nSafety\nIn National Highway Traffic Safety Administration crash tests, the Cadillac ATS coupe earned five stars across the board — an excellent result. You can see the crash test results here. As for standard safety equipment, the ATS coupe features eight airbags and a backup camera system, but if you’re willing to spend a little extra there are some interesting options available: A Driver Awareness Package includes a vibrating safety alert seat, forward collision alert, lane departure warning, lane keep assist, rain sensing wipers and more. Taking it to the next level involves opting for the Driver Assist Package, which adds adaptive cruise control with stop-start, electronic parking brake, automatic front and rear collision avoidance braking (to prevent you from hitting a pole as you’re backing up, for instance), rear cross-traffic alert and the full color head-up display. See all the ATS’ standard and available safety features here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe Cadillac ATS coupe starts at $38,990 with rear-wheel drive and the 2.0-liter turbo engine; the 2.5-liter non-turbo engine in the base sedan cannot be had in the coupe. The coupe’s price bumps up to $41,440 when all-wheel drive is selected. Four trim levels are available: Base, Luxury, Performance and Premium.\n\nMy test car was a Premium model, which starts at $49,200 but includes a lot of standard equipment, such as a sport suspension, 18-inch wheels, performance seats, navigation, remote keyless entry with remote start, the head-up display, front and rear park assist, the Driver Awareness Package and more. Only two separate options were specified on my car: the $1,295 Kona Brown leather interior and $850 polished 18-inch wheels, for a total sticker price of $51,345, including destination.\n\nStick with a rear-wheel-drive turbo model and forgo the fancy multimedia systems and leather interior, and you can get into an ATS coupe for less than $40,000. Spec out an all-wheel-drive V-6 model with all the options, and you can top $60,000. Option one up your way here.\n\nThis pricing is perfectly in competition with the major players. The BMW 428i starts at $41,700, a bit more than the ATS coupe, and rises to $43,700 when all-wheel drive is specified. As with most BMWs, however, you’ll start paying through the nose on options. Every paint color except non-metallic white or black costs $550; any leather interior requires the addition of both the Luxury Line and the Premium Package, adding $3,800 right off the bat.\n\nWith options similar to what I had on my ATS coupe test car, the 428i would cost more than $57,000 — quite a premium over the Cadillac. The Audi A5 comes only with quattro all-wheel drive, so the base version costs $40,925. Optioning one up to match my test car brought the A5 to $52,325, quite comparable to the Cadillac. Unlike the Cadillac, both the 428i and A5 have several trim and color combinations for sportier equipment and appearance packages, giving them more versatility and personalization options. The Lexus RC 350 starts at $43,715 for a rear-wheel-drive coupe and $45,950 for the all-wheel-drive version, but as mentioned before it comes with a much larger, more powerful standard engine than its competitors. Optioning the RC 350 up to the same level of features as the others brings it to just more than $52,000, as well. See how these four luxury coupes stack up against each other here.\n\nemail",
