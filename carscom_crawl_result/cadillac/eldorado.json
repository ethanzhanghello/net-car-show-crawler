      "expert_review": "If you took a look at the 1992 Cadillac Eldorado Touring Coupe but were unimpressed by the old hardware under the hood, you may want to consider a return trip to the Cadillac dealer.\n\nThis time, you might like what you see in the ’93 model.\n\nThe 1993 Eldorado Touring Coupe (as well as the Seville STS and Allante) comes with Cadillac’s new Northstar 32-valve V-8 engine.\n\nThe Northstar is not just another new engine. It’s an mechanical marvel that showcases the best of American engineering talent and creativity.\n\nWith the Eldorado Touring Coupe, Cadillac has made its intentions clear: General Motors’ luxury car division intends to claim a large piece of the luxury sport coupe market.\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nCadillac engineers designed the Northstar with two things in mind: high performance and low maintenance.\n\nThe Northstar engine is rated at 295 horsepower. That’s enough power to propel the 3,640 pound coupe from 0-to-60 mph in 7.5 seconds. That places the Caddy about even in performance with the new Lincoln Mark VIII and Lexus SC 400.\n\nSmooth, responsive and vocal is the best way to sum up the Eldorado’s demeanor. Though it’s quick off the line, the Eldorado really hustles between 30 and 65 mph.\n\nAnd the exhaust snarls like no Cadillac ever has. This may come as a bit of a surprise because Cadillac has built a large part of its reputation on designing quiet automobiles.\n\nBut with the Eldorado (and the Seville), Cadillac is trying to get younger, affluent buyers out of their imported luxury cars. Those baby boomers who grew up admiring Detroit muscle cars of the ’60s are likely to be impressed with the Eldorado’s power and performance.\n\nAs for maintenance, the Northstar V-8 is unlike any other engine you can buy.\n\nConsider this: Cadillac engineers drained the coolant out of a Northstar-equipped test car and drove it to and from Detroit to Toledo, Ohio – around 90 miles. Then they took the engine apart.\n\nThanks to a high-tech engine management system that prevents overheating, none of the engine’s parts were damaged.\n\nAlso, the Northstar won’t need a tuneup until it reaches 100,000 miles.\n\nRegular oil and filter changes are all the maintenance the Northstar will need, Cadillac says.\n\nHANDLING\n\nCadillac’s suspension engineers did a masterful – though not perfect – job with the front-wheel-drive Eldorado.\n\nUnless you floor the accelerator, you probably wouldn’t have a clue that the front wheels are doing all the work.\n\nBut a fast start from rest will cause the Eldorado’s rear end to dip slightly.\n\nA car’s weight distribution is one of the things that influences handling. In the Eldorado, about 63 percent of the weight is concentrated on the front half of the car, while the remaining weight is over the rear wheels.\n\nThe best handling cars have the weight evenly distributed. But a sharp turn at moderate speeds on wet pavement can cause the Eldorad o’s tires to lose traction.\n\nThe Eldorado Touring Coupe is equipped with the necessary hardware needed to compete with other high performance luxury/sport coupes. It has power rack and pinion steering, four-wheel anti-lock disc brakes, traction control and a computerized suspension system.\n\nIf you are comparing the Eldorado against its two main competitors, the Lexus SC 400 and the new Lincoln Mark VIII, you’re likely to notice that the Eldorado is a bit quicker off from a stop, but that the ride isn’t as quiet.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nThe dark blue test car drew admiring glances and compliments from a number of passengers as well as from other motorists.\n\nWecould argue all day about the merits of front-wheel drive vs. rear-wheel drive – both have good and bad points – but few are likely to be put off by the Eldorado’s styling. Rather square, it is tough and aggressive-looking.\n\nThe four chromed oval exhaust tips poking from under the rear bumper undersc ore the car’s serious performance capabilities. They are not just for show.\n\nA set of tan leather bucket seats separated by a console mounted floor shifter as well as a full set of analog gauges help give the test car its sporting pedigree.\n\nCadillac has done a fine job in designing the Eldorado’s interior. The one-piece dash is contemporary in style. And it isn’t cluttered with endless rows of buttons and switches.\n\nThe Eldorado’s interior comes off as a bit classier than the interior of the new Lincoln Mark VIII. The Eldorado has wood inserts on the dash and door panels.\n\nThe headlights are light-sensitive, so the driver doesn’t have to fuss with the switch. Nice touch. The computerized air conditioner allows the driver to choose the temperature.\n\nIf you like European or Japanese luxury cars, you are definitely going to find the Eldorado’s performance, equipment and ease of maintenance appealing.\n\nTruett’s tip: The Cadillac Eldorado is a luxury hot rod that will blast apart any lingering doubts about Cadillac’s resolve to compete with the imports.",

      "expert_review": "Big coupes seem to be a GM specialty. Whether you’re talking about the 1963 Buick Riviera, the 1976 Cadillac Eldorado or the 1984 Corvette, GM has a heritage of function following form when it comes to coupes. The latest samples, Buick’s Riviera and Cadillac’s Eldorado are two of GM’s newer entries.\n\n1996 BUICK RIVIERA\n\nRedesigned last year, this big boat sees little change save the addition of real wood accents that help warm the otherwise cold plastic interior, and a more powerful optional engine.\n\nThat engine, Buick’s supercharged 3.8-liter V-6, gets 240 horses with 280 pound-feet of torque. That’s enough to propel this 3,722-pound land yacht to 60 in just about 8 seconds. The engine makes its presence known to the crew a bit more than in the Park Avenue, but given this car’s cruiser mission, it’s easy to overlook.\n\nWhat might not be easy to overlook is the car’s nautical handling. If you prefer a soft ride, with oceans of body lean, you’ll feel right at home. Otherwise, you might be dismayed.\n\nDespite the waves made by the handling, this front-wheel-driver has tremendous grip –meaning that you might be kissing the windows if you take a corner too fast, but the car hangs in there. Most of us sea-faring types won’t care, though, because the car looks so good.\n\nThe styling is some of GM’s best — glamorous and distinctive, yet clearly a Riviera. The subtle ridge that sweeps along the side of the car is a new Buick styling touch, one coming for 1997’s redesigned Park Avenue.\n\nThe interior has good front seat space, but the back is best for the adventurous — it is comfortable as long as you’re not traveling eight hours back there. The front bucket seats and console can be replaced with a split bench seat.\n\nThe captain of the ship will be well-treated. The captain’s chair is heated and it faces a dash with a retro-’60s feel to it. All controls fall readily to hand.\n\nThis car carries a full range of safety items, including anti-lock disc brakes, dual air bags and traction control. The EPA rating is 18 mpg city, 27 mpg highway.\n\nThis beautiful boat can’t carve the corners, but that’s not its intent. This car is about looking good, about oozing down the street with a car that makes you look good.\n\nAt about $33,700, it’s one heck of a deal in luxury liner.\n\n1996 CADILLAC ELDORADO\n\nThe Eldorado is every bit as flashy on the outside as its corporate cousin, yet more sublime.\n\nThe exterior plays off the styling heritage of the original 1967 Eldorado. But this front-driver is very up to date. The base Eldo comes equipped with Cadillac’s superb Northstar engine. This 4.6-liter V-8 is rated at 275 horsepower and 300 pound feet of torque. Power delivery is smooth and assured, with seamless shifts from the electronically controlled automatic.\n\nFaster than the Buick, it also handles with more poise and is a bit more fun t o toss through corners. Gas mileage was better than the Buick’s 18 mpg, netting 19 mpg.\n\nBeing the base car, there weren’t so many features as were found on its nautical cousin. Missing from GM’s premier coupe were heated seats and dual climate controls. But the Eldorado was much more of a driver’s car, despite being every bit as big. Both cars had good trunk space, but the Caddy’s squared-off roof gave it superior back-seat space. Both were well-built and quiet, yet the Eldorado clearly felt more expensive, with refined handling and polished interior amenities. But then again, at 41 big ones, you should get something more for your money.\n\nOverall, both cars offer distinct personalities. The Eldorado has a very European feel to its suspension and handling, with a more refined feel than its Buick brother. What the Riv offers is more features for the money, giving heavy dollops of luxury over a dynamic driving experience.\n\nEither one allows its drivers so ething beyond the typical four-door sedan. Both offer their owners shapes beyond the ordinary.\n\nYou might call each a coupe de grace to the competition.",

      "expert_review": "Cadillac, the division that brought us the V-8-6-4 engine and the Allante as well as the infamous diesel, deserves a few winners after a string of also- rans-or in the case of the diesel, no run at all.\n\nAnd so it has been blessed with the new Seville sedan and Eldorado coupe for 1992.\n\nSeville/Eldorado have been enlarged and totally restyled for 1992 after serving penance since 1986when several inches and many pounds were lopped from both for the sake of downsizing. In miniaturizing them, however, Cadillac whittled away the character, personality-and prestige.\n\nWe last drove the new Cadillac luxury cars at a preview of the 1992 lineup at the division`s own headquarters and test track in Hamtramck, Mich. (Cartalk, Sept. 8). The problem with previews is that the cars can be finely tuned and honed in preparation for being turned over to media nitpickers.\n\nWe now have had a chance to test drive the Eldorado in Chicagoland with no loving Cadillac engineers at hand to tweek, twist or tighten the merchandise.\n\nRegardless of the locale, Eldorado is a special car, though we should quickly clarify that the top-of-the-line Touring Coupe is a breed of its own. The base Eldo is rather ordinary. Same is true of Seville. The STS is the creme de la creme of the lineup, the base Seville is simply creme de la so-so. What sets the Touring Coupe and STS apart from their siblings is the touring suspension in each. In base form without the touring suspension, Seville and Eldorado are simply pleasant machines that don`t offend by transmitting road harshness back into the wheel or seat. Unfortunately, they do so by being mushily sprung.\n\nThe difference in suspensions means you ride in a Seville or Eldorado, you drive an STS or Touring Coupe.\n\nWe found a vacant straightaway and conducted a series of quick lane changes-into the left lane back to the right lane, into the left, back to the right.\n\nThe wife once owned a 1984 Eldorado. If that same left/right maneuver had been done in an `84 Eldo two things would have happened: We would have thrown up along about the third left/right and the car would be rocking sideways for about 30minutes after the little test was completed.\n\nWith the Touring Coupe it was simply one quick maneuver after another as the tires held the pavement and the body refused to rock, float or wobble uncontrollably.\n\nOK, try a sharp corner.\n\nThe front end pointed into the turn, the body-the car`s and our own-took the trip at the same time without the car body leaning or our body sliding over into the passenger`s seat. Also, when you take that sharp turn it`s the fancy tread pattern on the bottom of those 16-inch all-season Goodyear radials that bite the pavement, not the sidewalls.\n\nBumps in the road.\n\nThe pavement may have been wavy, but the Touring Coupe sat flat and didn`t give in to the tendancy most luxury cars would h ave of bouncing severely in order to cushion the passenger from suffering rear-end bruises. The bouncing may camouflage the blemishes in the road, but it doesn`t provide you with total control of the vehicle.\n\n“Control“ is an apt description of the Touring Coupe. Give the car a command either by pressing a pedal or moving the wheel, and it responds. You dictate conditions and aren`t just along for the ride as you would have been in that 1984 version. You feel weight in the wheel, but it`s the feeling of substance, not excess.\n\nWith the touring suspension you have a luxury car with the manners of a sports model-entertain the clients during the week, entertain yourself on the weekends.\n\nThe Touring Coupe requires less wheel effort going into the wide turn and minimal wheel pressure in the turn. All the while the car sits flat, and the driver is in control. Coming out of the turn, there`s no lean or sway, so you`re ready to sprint down the straightawa y without having to adjust the wheel to reposition the nose.\n\nThe focus was on little things, such as stiffening the front frame member to reduce bending or twisting or shake; retuning the engine and body mounts to combat noise and vibration; running a bar of tubular steel behind the instrument panel to reduce instrument panel shake and steering column motion; revising transmission mounting brackets to provide added stiffness to reduce torque steer; upgrading control arm bushings to increase impact isolation; and changing variable spring rates for better ride.\n\nThe Touring Coupe also has speed-sensitive power steering that the base models don`t have. There`s too much wheel play in the base models in maneuvers. In the Touring Coupe, steering movement is more in harmony with the driver`s commands.\n\nThe Touring Coupe also adds front and rear stabilizer bars while all four struts have been revalved to control vehicle motion. When you accelerate or brake, the struts shift into a firm mode to prevent lift or nosedive. During aggressive driving, the struts also shift into the firm mode to increase stability.\n\nThe car is powered by a 200-horsepower, 4.9-liter V-8 with quick yet quiet off-the-line response. Luxury car buyers measure performance in how quickly they get started. They don`t want to have a Crown Vic or Caprice scoot from the light ahead of them. The 4.9 delivers, though at about 70 m.p.h. it seems to say, “Hey, I got you this far, give me a break,“ and wants to take a siesta.\n\nIn April, Cadillac will unveil the North Star V-8, a 32-valve, 300-h.p. powerplant that will bow in the `93 Allante(which comes out in the spring) before being offered in Seville/Eldorado, probably for the `93 model year. That engine should extend the power surge of the current V-8.\n\nEldorado stays on the same 108-inch wheelbase, but length was increased by 10.8 inches, to 202.2 inches. Body width swelled by 3.4 inchesbecause, despite jogging and aerobics, human bodies never underwent the same shrinkage that cars did in 1986.\n\nWith the larger dimensions comes new sheet metal. Styling will be debated, just like it was when Cadillac brought out the bustle back Seville, a love/hate attempt to be unique. The `92 sheet metal leaves us a bit cold.\n\nCadillac General Manager John Grettenberger told us Eldorado and Seville were to have been introduced in the 1991 model year, rather than 1992, but were delayed was because he wasn`t pleased with the Eldorado styling. Five additional styling versions were ordered after the first one failed to please Cadillac officials.\n\nDespite Eldorado`s increased length, the bulk of the added inches seems to be devoted to trunk space-length but not depth, so you can hold golf clubs easily, but grocery bags are a trick.\n\nThe back seat could have used some of that added space. Leg room suffers. There are numerous nice touches, howev er, and obvious attention paid to detail, such as large, wide bodyside moldings to prevent parking lot pock marks. If you price body work on a car with clear coat/base coat you`d see the value of wide bodyside moldings.\n\nThe center console houses a button to activate a windshield de-icer. We had ample opportunity to check out the de-icer. Typically two minutes is all it takes from freeze to thaw so after a wisk with the wiper you`re ready to drive.\n\nOther nice touches include simple-to-understand and easy-to-use controls in the instrument panel, including a continuous outside temperature reading and average mileage and mileage range based on fuel-in-tank readings, fan and vent controls for rear seat occupants and a center armrest up front with two stowage compartments and coin/cassette holder.\n\nAlso, automatic door locks engage when you put the car in gear and unlock when you put the selector in park; eye glass and automatic garage door opener holders are hidden in the roof; lighted mirrors and pullout plastic sunshade extensions are in each visor (though we`re surprised Cadillac didn`t employ pop-open mirrors instead of pull-open that would be hard on women`s nails); doors open wide for easy front seat entry or exit; the trunk lid opens about 90 degrees for easy loading or unloading of luggage or golf clubs; and seats can be heated by pressing a console button.\n\nBut the seats are those dumb bladder-inflated type, unnecessary because they already are wide and comfortable with terrific support.\n\nAlso, Cadillac should rethink the front-seat shoulder belt system. It`s comfortable to use, but it blocks entry to the rear seat for your guests. There`s no graceful way for a woman in gown or man in tux to get in or out of that back seat unless you enter through the moonroof via a crane.\n\nThere`s an ashtray for smokers, but it opens at a such a weird angle it`s not designed to hold ashes. It`s hard to describe its exact position, but imagine standing an ashtray on its side, then try flicking an ash into it.\n\nStandard equipment includes anti-lock brakes, driver-side air bag, power brakes and steering, air conditioning, cruise control, side- and rear-window defoggers, heated outside power mirrors, power door locks, electronic level control, driver messenger center that displays warnings from low fuel to oil life, AM-FM stereo with cassette, leather seats, retained accessory power so windows and radio work when the ignition is turned off, tinted glass, tilt wheel, power windows with driver`s express down and platinum-tipped spark plugs for 100,000 miles of usage, to name some of the goodies.\n\nThe Eldorado Touring Coupe starts at $34,970.\n\n>> 1992 Eldorado Touring Coupe\nWheelbase: 108 inches Length: 202.2 inches Engine: 4.9 liter, 200 h.p.V-8 Transmission: 4-speed automatic Fuel economy: 16 m.p.g. city/25 m.p.g highway Base price: $34,970 Strong point: Superb suspension system and nimble response from speed sensitive power steering makes for command of the road, larger dimensions for much needed room, ABS and driver`s side airbag standard.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThis slow-selling luxury coupe adds features for its standard OnStar satellite-based communication system but is otherwise a carryover. The front-drive Eldorado formerly was a two-door companion to the Seville sedan, but when the Seville was redesigned for 1998, the Eldo continued in the old design. General Motors has not said how much longer it will build the Eldorado or whether the model name (used by Cadillac since 1953) will transfer to another model, such as a roadster that will be based on the Evoq concept cars design.\n\nOnStar, which includes emergency services and routing assistance, adds two premium services later in the model year. One is personal calling, which allows hands-free, voice-activated calls from the car without an additional cellular phone contract. The other is virtual advisor, which provides Internet-based information such as news, sports scores, stock quotes and weather reports, also through voice activation.\n\nExterior\nThe Eldorado maintains a traditional formal look and wide rear roof pillars, which hamper the drivers visibility. The Eldorado Touring Coupe (ETC) distinguishes itself from the base Eldorado with a monochromatic exterior treatment and seven-spoke aluminum wheels.\n\nInterior\nFour adults fit comfortably in the Eldorados opulent interior, but climbing into the rear seat requires limber bodies and the wide doors require a lot of room to fully open. The ETC gets a different dashboard than the base model with more conveniently placed controls and a more stylish look.\n\nUnder the Hood\nBoth models use Cadillacs 4.6-liter Northstar V-8 engine. In the base model, it produces 275 horsepower and the ETC produces 300 hp. Both can operate on regular unleaded gas, but premium is still recommended for best performance. The engines team with a four-speed automatic transmission.\n\nThe extra 25 hp in the ETC doesnt produce a huge difference in acceleration. You might notice more of a difference from the ETCs larger tires and firmer suspension, which create a stiffer ride.\n\n \n\nReported by Rick Popely  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2001 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "When it comes to selecting cars to test drive, the criteria I use is easy. Is it new? Is it interesting?\n\nSo, it’s been an interesting week behind the wheel of a 2002 Cadillac Eldorado Touring Coupe.\n\nAfter all, this car is DOA. GM ceased building them in late April, although they are still to be found on dealer lots.\n\nBut, this car has become incredibly scarce. Only 2,638 will leave the factory in 2002. Only 7,713 were built last year.\n\nSo, despite its familiar styling, my bright red test car turned quite a few heads. No doubt, it’s the styling.\n\nLong one of my favorites, the car’s modern take on the angular ’67 Eldorado is masterful. The trunk’s simple line is nestled between vestigial fins. The hood’s crisp styling and tailored fenders are classic in their beauty. The large greenhouse has a massive, but stylistically essential, blind spot.\n\nAll these things give the car its character. It is unmistakably an Eldorado.\n\nThat also means that most other drivers probably assumed I was older than dirt. The best proof of this was being cut-off by a cap- wearing cretin while cruising in New Jersey. His BMW 530i (with its GM-sourced automatic transmission) was no match for the Northstar V- 8’s 300-horsepower. As I watched his lack of progress from the Eldorado’s rear-view mirror, the look of surprise on his face made my day. The old saying is true: there is no substitute for cubic inches.\n\nIf you are interested in an Eldorado, you might want to know it comes in two trim levels, a base car and the Eldorado Touring Coupe (or ETC in Caddy speak.) The difference between the two is subtle, but significant. Both versions use Cadillac’s Northstar engine. But the base car uses a lower horsepower version of the double-overhead- cam mill; 275 horses vs. 300 in the ETC.\n\nThe ETC also gets a firmer suspension. While most enthusiasts would welcome this, the ETC’s balance between handling and ride comfort is a little behind the rest of the Cadillac line. Part of this is due to the fact that the Cadillac rides on an older version of the G-Body platform unlike its DeVille and Seville stablemates.\n\nThe Eldorado pounds over pothole-marked pavement, yet some wallowing still makes its way through. The steering is light, but the car is nimble enough to do some highway gymnastics.\n\nThe rest of the car is pure modern Cadillac.\n\nThe wood trim and leather upholstery has a rich, welcoming feel. Again, the details of the interior show how much better current stablemates are finished. The express-down drivers window has no express-up feature. The seats are somewhat lumpy and short, lacking good thigh or lower back support. The Bose audio system is good, but the sound lacks the punch of other Caddys.\n\nStill, it’s style that sells cars and this Eldo has it in spades.\n\nLarge two-door cars are automotive dinosaurs in the eyes of many automakers. The Lexus SC300/400, the Lincoln Mark series, even fellow-GM cars — the Oldsmobile Tornado and Buick Riviera — have all faded into history.\n\nSo too will the Eldorado.\n\nThe final run of 1,596 Collectors Edition Eldorados has been made: 1,064 in white and 532 in red. The Cadillac Museum will get the last one off the line.\n\nBut there’s still time to grab a piece of history. Ten years after the current generation’s introduction, the Eldorado still has the styling and power to draw stares.\n\nNow that’s interesting.\n\nCADILLAC ELDORADO TOURING COUPE\n\nEngine: 4.6-liter all-aluminum V-8\n\nTransmission: 4-speed automatic\n\nTires: P235/60HR-16\n\nWheelbase: 108 inches\n\nLength: 200.6 inches\n\nWidth: 75.5 inches\n\nWeight: 3,865 pounds\n\nCargo volume: 15 cubic ft.\n\nBase price: $45,265\n\nAs tested: Not available\n\nEPA rating: 18 city, 25 highway\n\nTest mileage: 18.5 mpg\n\nFuel type: Regular\n\nBuilt in: Lansing, Mich.",

      "expert_review": "In the old days, it was the Cadillac Coupe DeVille that bore the mantle of “The banker’s hot rod.”\n\nToday, it’s the 1995 Eldorado Touring Coupe, a luxury, sports-oriented performance vehicle that far surpasses anything ever done with the big luxo-boats of yesteryear.\n\nThe Eldorado, which has been part and parcel of the Cadillac line since big was considered grand and bigger grandest, now is a slimmed-down set of wheels that embraces performance shielded in the velvet glove of luxury.\n\nThe ETC, as the coupe is called, is the Eldorado model that whets the appetite of drivers. It’s a luxury car with a certain degree of aggressiveness, courtesy of upscale technology in the engine, suspension and drivetrain.\n\nThe first Touring Coupe made its debut in 1992 with Cadillac’s trustworthy but hardly exciting push-rod/rocker-arm V8 and a boulevard-style ride favored mainly by the more matronly.\n\nIn the following two years there were upgrades in engine and suspension, and for 1995 drivers have a really sharp rig.\n\nThere’s 300 horsepower under the hood. A road-sensing suspension system keeps all four wheels on the ground, on rough pavement or smooth.\n\nA new system integrating anti-lock braking with traction control and a steering-angle sensor optimizes stopping and cornering traction. A computer- controlled shock-absorber system creates a soft or firm ride, depending upon road conditions and vehicle speed.\n\nWith all these systems and components functioning as a unit, you have a car you can really drive. That’s what we did with the ETC that General Motors’ Terri Phillips provided for a test car.\n\nThe coupe is one of those rare machines that make you feel at home the first time you sit behind the wheel. It’s like putting on a familiar old coat — everything feels warm and comfortable.\n\nIn an Eldorado with all the power accessories and adjustments at hand, it’s virtually impossible not to find a comfortable driving position — and finding one is recommended. You want to feel like part of the car when going fast, because these things top out at 150 miles an hour.\n\nThe luxury of woods, leather and full analog instrumentation was expected. I hadn’t driven an Eldorado in two or three years, yet it felt like it was only yesterday. Everything just seemed to come to hand.\n\nAll controls are grouped around the driver, who doesn’t have to flounder around to activate buttons or switches. An electronic driver information center tells you everything going on with the car. And convenience items include storage bins, cup holders and an overhead console for a garage-door opener or sunglasses.\n\nThere was even an electronic compass for an extra hundred bucks, just in case you got lost in the wilds of Indianapolis.\n\nThe Eldorado has been a prime beneficiary of Cadillac’s now-fabled 4.6-liter (279-cubic-inch) V8. This is a world-class engine as good as anything being produced by anybody, domestic or foreign.\n\nWith its four overhead cams and four valves per cylinder, t he Northstar motor is the heart of a system that unites engine, transmission and chassis.\n\nThe power is up five horsepower from the 1994 version by virtue of refinements to the intake manifold. That takes it to a level that induces torque steer (pulling to one side) for the front driving wheels during full-throttle acceleration from a standing start.\n\nThe transmission is GM’s advanced 4T80-E electronically controlled four-speed automatic, which features equal-length driving axles to limit torque steer. But when those 300 horses paw the ground on a standing start, the driving axles don’t get rid of the torque steer completely.\n\nIn high-speed maneuvering, the coupe felt like it was on rails, in part due to a speed- sensitive chassis control system, speed-sensitive steering and Z-rated rubber that put down a tire print that looked like it belonged to Bigfoot.\n\nI ran the car just beforethe recent snowfall, so I didn’t get a chance to try it in bad weather. But the standa rd Goodyear Ea gle GA Z-rated P225/60ZR 16- inch all-season tires get a huge bite on the pavement. It translated into excellent tractive effort whether accelerating or braking, and it should let the car plow through the white stuff.\n\nThe ride of the coupe was relative to the speed and the condition of the road surface. Wheel dampening leaned just slightly toward the firm side, but never was harsh or uncomfortable. It took some pretty rough pavement to experience vibration in the driver’s compartment.\n\nFrom its inception the Eldorado was never designed to be an econobox, and the 1995 ETC is no exception.\n\nYou’re looking at something around $43,000 to drive one of these things off the showroom door. But you’ll drive a luxury coupe that will “lux” with the best of them. And if the urge to play Mario Andretti strikes, just lean on that throttle and steer.\n\n1995 Cadillac Eldorado Touring Coupe Model year: 1995.Base price: $41,535.As tested: $43,362.00Type: Front engine, front-wheel drive, five-passenger, sports touring coupe.Engine: 4.6-liters, DOHC V- 8, 32 valves, fuel injected, 300-horsepower, 295 foot-pounds of torque.Transmission: Four-speed automatic.Mileage: 16 mpg city; 25 mpg highway,Acceleration: 0-60 mph in 7.2 seconds.Top speed: 150 mph.Wheelbase: 108.0 inches.Length: 202.2 inches.Width: 75.5 inches.Height: 53.6 inches.Curb weight: 3,814 pounds.Options: Delco-Bose stereo/w disc player and cassette, heated front seats, electronic compass.",
