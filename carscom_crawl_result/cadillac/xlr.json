      "expert_review": "Gutsy Roadster Says Cadillac Is Back\n2004 Cadillac XLR Roadster\n\nSome extravagances are worth the money. Consider this week’s test car, the 2004 Cadillac XLR roadster.\n\nIt is the car as abstract art, a sculptured ode to the spirit of driving — the speed, freedom and beauty of it. There is something timeless in its promise of unfettered movement, of going from one place to another just for the sheer joy of it, and doing it in a style that defies imitation.\n\nIt is a completely polarizing car, and that pleases me immensely. The artists, poets and musicians I love don’t hold committee meetings before they create. They don’t hire focus groups. They reach within themselves for the expression of an idea. They look for something different and, often as a result, see things differently. That is the case with the Cadillac XLR.\n\nIt does not have the sleek, sinewy body of a Jaguar XK-8 convertible. It eschews the luxurious roundness of a Lexus SC430. It lacks the bullet-in-flight persona of a Porsche 911 Carrera.\n\nInstead, the XLR is a work of severely sharp angles, multiple creases and contrapuntal lines — some stopping where they seem to begin, others starting where they would seem to stop. Its interior, highlighted by an instrument panel that reflects its exterior, is equally provocative.\n\nThe XLR does not seek transient popularity. It demands the passionate love of a relative few.\n\nWhether that love will sustain the XLR’s life in a brutally fickle automotive market remains to be seen. But that it will hold its place in the hearts of people who love cars, who admire bold design, is without question.\n\nPeople who love it truly love it. There is no need to explain the car to them. They approach you at stoplights in Los Angeles, Phoenix, New York and the District of Columbia. They are all ages, all ethnic groups. They simply dig the XLR’s funk and audacity.\n\nPeople who hate the XLR do so with a vengeance verging on vitriol. They, too, are of all ages and ethnic groups. They regard the car as an ugly, obsessively exhibitionist extravagance. Explaining the car to them is useless. I am not a member of their camp.\n\nI love the XLR. I’m tickled by its adherence to the Middle Digit School of Design, which invites the offense of many in pursuit of memorable difference. Legends do not grow from mediocrity. There is nothing mediocre about the XLR. But there is something Corvette about it, because it shares the same rear-wheel-drive platform with the Chevrolet Corvette C6 sports car.\n\nBut the Corvette is about running fast and hard all the time. It is genuinely unhappy at cruising speeds. By comparison, the XLR, equipped with General Motors Corp.’s 4.6-liter, 32-valve, 320-horsepower Northstar V-8 engine, is about running fast only when its driver has a need or desire to do so. Otherwise, it is reasonably happy at boulevard speeds — cruising w ith its automatically retractable hardtop roof down, gathering both crowns and frowns.\n\nHow different this is from Cadillac’s endeavors in years past, when it rolled out car after car bereft of distinction, save for the Cadillac crests on their hoods and rear hatches. Those models, produced in the 1970s and 1980s, the worst of which was the inept Cadillac Cimarron, turned “luxury” into a cliche and the Cadillac motto, “The standard of excellence,” into a joke.\n\nCadillac began putting that bad reputation behind it in the late 1990s. Successful models such as the full-size Escalade sport-utility vehicle, the swank SRX wagon/SUV, and the CTS and CTS-V sports sedans helped turn Cadillac’s image — and sales — around. The XLR continues that revolution. But its $70,000-plus price tag and edgy styling mean it isn’t likely to become a sales leader, per se. Here’s betting, though, that the XLR and others of its Cadillac siblings have the stuff to become classics.\n\nNuts & Bolts\n\nDownside: Tall people said they felt cramped in the XLR’s tight, two-seat cabin. It felt just right to me. But I’m a short dude.\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: Excellent ride — in fact, surprisingly good for a roadster, especially on less-than-perfect roads where roadsters and similar sports cars tend to give you a beating. Excellent acceleration. Handling is excellent at highway speeds. But that grade falls to “good” in city traffic, where the XLR’s weight of 3,547 pounds becomes more pronounced.\n\nHead-turning quotient: Rarely have I been in a car that attracted as much attention, pro and con, as the XLR. It generates enough passion to start a cult.\n\nBody style/layout: The XLR is a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive, two-door, two-seat roadster equipped with an automatically retractable hardtop (glass rear window with defogger).\n\nEngine/transmission: The car’s 4.6-liter, 32-valve, double overhead-cam Northstar V-8 engine develops 320 horsepower at 6,400 revolutions per minute and 310 foot-pounds of torque at 4,400 revolutions per minute. The engine is linked to an electronically controlled five-speed automatic transmission that also can be operated manually.\n\nCapacities: Seats two people. Carries 11.6 cubic feet of cargo with its top up, the equivalent of a couple of overnight bags. When the top is retracted, that drops to 4.4 cubic feet. Gasoline tank holds 18 gallons. Regular unleaded gasoline is okay.\n\nMileage: I averaged 23 miles per gallon, mostly in highway travel.\n\nSafety: Front/rear ventilated disc brakes with anti-lock protection; standard traction and stability control; dual front air bags with head protection, side air bags.\n\nTechnical highlight: GM’s “Magnetic Ride Control” active suspension system. Using sensors, it “reads” the road 1,000 times per second — completely reading every inch of the road at a speed of 60 miles per hour — and makes instant, multiple suspension adjustments to create a smooth ride.\n\nPrice: Base price is $75,385 with a dealer invoice price on the base model of $69,731, according to Edmunds.com. Price as tested is $76,525, including $325 for XM Satellite Radio installation and an $815 destination charge.\n\nPurse-strings note: You can bargain. Compare with Jaguar XK-8, Lexus SC430, Mercedes-Benz SL500 and Porsche 911 Carrera. Also note that the Cadillac XLR remains virtually unchanged for 2005.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nAfter going more than a decade without one, Cadillac added a two-passenger sports car to its lineup for 2004. Named the XLR, the retractable-hardtop coupe gave Cadillac a luxury roadster with a performance-oriented chassis and structure. Changes for 2008 include a heated steering wheel and a limited edition Alpine White XLR in addition to last year’s Platinum edition.\n\nCadillac promotes the “harmonious blend of technologies and materials meant to add pleasure, not complexity, to the driving experience.” A long list of technical features includes a head-up display, radar-operated adaptive cruise control and an electronic stability system.\n\nCadillac has revised the XLR’s Magnetic Ride Control. The system provides magnetic-fluid-based real-time damping and has been retuned to improve ride and handling, Cadillac says. Keyless Access with push-button start permits true no-key operation. For safety’s sake, the engine will not start unless the remote fob is in the car and the driver is depressing the brake pedal.\n(Skip to details on the: XLR-V)\n\nExterior\nCadillac says stealth fighters inspired the XLR, which serves as “a contemporary expression of Cadillac’s heritage of landmark design and advanced technology.” Its linear form hints of the marque’s history. The XLR’s vertical headlights are part of Cadillac’s current design philosophy.\n\nThe roadster has a rear-mounted transmission that makes the weight distribution close to 50/50. Cadillac says the XLR’s steel hydroformed frame rails couple with an aluminum cockpit structure and balsa-cored composite flooring to provide “rigidity without bulk.” Run-flat tires eliminate the need for a spare.\n\nBuilt on a 105.7-inch wheelbase, the XLR is 177.7 inches long overall. Retracting the hardtop takes less than 30 seconds. Made of aluminum and magnesium, the top structure features composite exterior panels, a heated glass back window and glass rear-quarter windows.\n\nEighteen-inch wheels are standard. The new Alpine White and the Platinum edition will receive special chrome wheels and grille, though tire sizes remain the same. For 2008, the XLR is available in six interior/exterior color combinations and has a hand-crafted leather interior.\n\nInterior\nTwo occupants fit inside the XLR’s luxurious interior, which can feature light or dark eucalyptus wood and aluminum accents. The seatbacks and cushions are heated and cooled. For 2008, the steering wheel is also heated. The DVD navigation/entertainment system has a 7-inch screen in the upper center console, but the entertainment system operates only when the gear selector is in Park. The XLR also comes with a head-up display that projects information for the driver onto the windshield.\n\nA nine-speaker Bose audio system includes an in-dash six-CD changer. XM Satellite Radio and GM’s OnStar communication and navigation systems are standard. Trunk capacity is 11.6 cubic feet with the top up, but space drops to 4.4 cubic feet when the roof is retracted.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 4.6-liter Northstar V-8 with variable valve timing produces 320 horsepower at 6,400 rpm and 310 pounds-feet of torque at 4,400 rpm. Premium fuel is recommended. The XLR has a six-speed automatic transmission that incorporates a manual-shift mode.\n\nSafety\nSide-impact airbags are installed in the seats. The seat belts have powered pretensioners. Four-channel all-disc antilock brakes, traction control and a stability system are standard.\n\nDriving Impressions\nWith a low driving position like Chevrolet’s Corvette, the XLR is one sweet road machine. Acceleration for passing is close to stunning, and the XLR is also quick from a standstill. Ride comfort beats most sports cars by a mile, and steering is tight and impressively precise. High sills demand some twisting to get inside.\n\nXLR-V\nThe performance-packed V edition of the XLR is fitted with a supercharged 4.4-liter V-8 that develops 443 hp at 6,400 rpm and 414 pounds-feet of torque at 3,900 rpm. A six-speed automatic transmission incorporates Performance Algorithm Shifting and Performance Algorithm Liftfoot systems, along with Driver Shift Control for manually selected gear changes.\n\nThe XLR-V will be available in a new color, Elektra Blue, for 2008. Unique XLR-V design features include polished wire-mesh upper and lower grilles, a sculpted hood and four stainless-steel exhaust tips. The interior has Zingana wood trim and aluminum accents on the wheel. It also has a rear stabilizer bar and a larger front stabilizer bar. (Back to top)",

      "expert_review": "During my week of driving a Cadillac XLR-V, a lot of people were surprised that Cadillac makes a two-seat, retractable-top roadster. They were even more surprised when they learned that the V-series has a supercharged engine that puts out 443 horsepower.\n\nThis high-performance roadster is relatively new for Cadillac, and it competes with the Mercedes-Benz SL 55 AMG, Jaguar XK-R and the Lexus SC.\n\nThe XLR comes in two models: XLR and XLR-V. The standard XLR is fast and luxurious, but refinement and comfort are emphasized over outright performance.\n\nThe supercharged XLR-V, however, is for buyers who want a sports car that will knock their socks off. It can hit 60 miles per hour in less than five seconds, according to Cadillac\n\nThe XLR starts at $78,760 and the XLR-V is priced at $100,000. That guarantees that you won’t see one on every block, or even in every town.\n\nThe XLR-V is essentially Cadillac’s version of the Corvette, and it is built on the Corvette assembly line in Bowling Green, Ky. The fiberglass body sits on a frame that is nearly the same one as that of the Chevy’s legendary sports car.\n\nEach supercharged Northstar V-8 is hand-built by a single person in GM’s Performance Build Center in Wixom, Mich.\n\nThe 4.4-liter engine is strong and smooth. The supercharger pastes you back in the driver’s seat when you nail the throttle, but the engine is quite docile when you want to drive moderately. This engine produces 90 percent of its torque between 2,200 and 6,000 rpm, and that means it doesn’t have to be driven hard to be satisfying.\n\nGM’s six-speed automatic transmission is the perfect companion.\n\nThe XLR-V has subtle styling that makes it discreet. It moves quickly without getting flustered. The ride is supple and the brakes are excellent. This is not a hard-core sports car, but a very fast touring machine.\n\nThe suspension swallows bad pavement, sharp turns and flat roads. One key to its stability is the Magnetic Ride Control. This system electronically controls the magnetic fluid in the shock absorbers, making adjustments in one millisecond. The ride is smooth over little bumps one instant and firm for bigger dips the next instant.\n\nThe folding hardtop turns the XLR-V into an al fresco cruiser at the touch of a button. The occupants sit fairly low in the vehicle. Wind buffeting is not severe at reasonable speeds. A wind blocker behind the front seat would be welcome. The folded top consumes almost all of the trunk space, so you have to travel light if you’re going to enjoy the fresh air.\n\nThe Caddy’s interior is modern and understated. Soft leather and real wood are accented with touches of satin metallic trim. The seats are generally good, but longer thigh cushions would offer better support.\n\nThe XLR-V has a radar-controlled adaptive cruise control that automatically slows the vehicle when you close in on a car in front.\n\nThe XLR-V competes against an elite group of sports cars, and it does so quite well.\n\nPrice The XLR-V’s base price is $97,460. Destination charges and a $1,700 gas-guzzler tax bring the sticker price to $100,000.\n\nWarranty Four years or 50,000 miles with a five-year, 100,000-mile powertrain warranty.",

      "expert_review": "Gazing out over the long, sharp-edged hood of the 2006 Cadillac XLR-V, you might ask: Is this a sports car?\n\nSitting as low as you do in the car’s firm leather driver’s seat, the answer has to be yes.\n\nYet considering you are at the wheel of nearly 2 tons of steel (and lots of aluminum just to keep from adding even more weight), you have to wonder how it is possible.\n\nBut then hit the gas — hard. The supercharger that force feeds the 4.4-liter Northstar V-8 engine whines and those 2 tons leap forward, as though it were a far lighter car.\n\nIt’s true, Cadillac has indeed built itself a world-class sports car, which is what it set out to do in 2004 with the XLR. That car was not as powerful as this one, and did not have such a firm suspension, but it was nonetheless a good attempt. The V model, however, is another beast entirely.\n\nKeep in mind that this is essentially a tweaked, reskinned Chevrolet Corvette, the world-class sports car that may be the best buy on the planet, considering its high quality. Of course, for the $100,000 you would pay for the XLR-V, you could nearly put two Vettes in the garage.\n\nBut for all that cash invested in the Cadillac, you will get lots of standard gear. There is a six-speed automatic transmission that can be shifted manually — which is recommended when you set out to play in this car. The transmission lets you be in charge, a good thing.\n\nThe XLR-V also features General Motors’ magnetic ride control, which senses what sort of driving you are doing and adjusts the ride accordingly.\n\nBasically, magnetic ride control features a liquid that contains metal filings. During gentle driving the liquid remains soft, and so does the suspension. Get aggressive, however, and a computer watchdog orders the fluid’s magnetic properties to stiffen up, turning it into a rigid mass.\n\nThis means that the same system that was letting you float softly down the highway also holds the car stiff and flat if you get into hard cornering.\n\nStability and traction controls are standard on the SLR-V, as are front- and side-impact air bags, adaptive forward lighting that “looks” around the corners as you turn into them, and run-flat tires.\n\nThe Cadillac’s hard convertible top goes up and down in less than 20 seconds and, while there is decent trunk space with the top up, two people on vacation looking forward to drop-top driving will have to travel light.\n\nThe front seats are heated and cooled and have an eight-way power adjustment. XM satellite radio is standard, and free for the first three months. Voice-recognition navigation is also standard.\n\nThe car starts with the push of a button, and an adjustable display on the windscreen feeds the driver performance and utility information in a way that is not intrusive.\n\nLike most Cadillacs these days, the XLR-V’s outer appearance is distinct. In fact, the sharp edges designers have sculpted onto today’s Caddies may work best on this two-seater.\n\nOn the road, the interior was relatively quiet, with just a bit of wind noise and the inevitable soft sound of the supercharger when it kicked in. But it was a pleasant accompaniment to the raw power — so unexpected that it sets you back in your seat, even accelerating from highway speeds.\n\nThere were times when it did actually feel like a 2-ton car, particularly in slower maneuvering. It also had a tendency to feel just a bit off-center when steering into corners, feeling at times like it wanted to plow ahead.\n\nIt was a risk for General Motors to step into this high-class realm by developing a sporty Cadillac, but for those loyal to the brand — and who would not be caught in a European sports car — this is fine American luxury with more performance than imaginable — until you actually drive the car.\n\nRoyal Ford can be reached at ford@globe.com.",
