      "expert_review": "Competes with: Audi E-Tron, Ford Mustang Mach-E, Jaguar I-Pace, Mercedes-Benz EQE SUV, Nissan Ariya, Tesla Model X and Model Y\n\nLooks like: The XT6 of the future\n\nPowertrain: 340-horsepower, single-motor rear-wheel drive or 500-hp, dual-motor all-wheel drive; 12-module, 102 kilowatt-hour battery pack; DC fast charging supported\n\nThe all-electric Cadillac Lyriq SUV arrived in 2022 as the brand’s first model in a “portfolio” of six electric vehicles. The 2023 Lyriq uses GM’s new Ultium battery pack — shared with the GMC Hummer EV pickup truck — and is built on a dedicated EV platform. Cadillac’s inaugural EV offers a generous range of up to 312 miles, sleek exterior styling and a high-tech interior.\n\nRelated: Lyriqs to Go: Cadillac’s Quest to Enter EV Market Starts With Dropping New Lyriq\n\nExterior\n\nCadillac’s next generation of design language takes shape in the Lyriq, with its “black crystal” grille design that includes exterior lighting elements. Extremely slim, vertically oriented LED headlights flank the grille.\n\nAround the side of the Lyriq, dark glossy wheel arches are joined by rocker panels of the same material, and the doors are generously sculpted. An angular waistline runs the length of the Lyriq, and the large C-pillars include a lighting or reflective element that’s visible in profile. Out back, the Lyriq’s aggressive rear haunches surround a narrow liftgate that is horizontally bisected by LED lighting elements, and additional slim, vertical taillights roughly mirror the headlight design and position.\n\nAccording to Cadillac, the various lighting elements illuminate in a coordinated greeting sequence when the driver approaches. The 2023 Lyriq rides on standard 20-inch alloy wheels, and 22-inch alloys are available.\n\nInterior, Tech and Safety\n\nThe focal point of the Lyriq’s minimalistic interior is a single 33-inch curved LED display that stretches across most of the dashboard and encompasses the instrument panel and infotainment screen. The SUV comes with standard Google Built-In and offers wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. The center console area is very minimalistic and features a knob control for the infotainment system. The console itself protrudes outward toward the instrument panel but, without a traditional transmission tunnel, leaves lots of space underneath it for storage.\n\nThe Lyriq’s active road noise cancellation keeps the cabin quiet, allowing occupants to fully take advantage of the premium 19-speaker AKG-brand sound system and head restraint-integrated speakers in the front seats. And, like the exterior, the interior includes “orchestrated lighting elements.”\n\nThe Lyriq features the latest version of Cadillac’s Super Cruise hands-free driving technology, which can be activated on over 200,000 miles of U.S. highways and includes automated lane changes. Additionally, the SUV offers the Cadillac Smart System driver-assist suite with standard features like automatic emergency braking, forward collision warning and rear park assist.\n\nDriving Range, Performance and Charging\n2023 Cadillac Lyriq | Manufacturer image\n\nA 12-module, 102-kilowatt-hour battery powers the SUV’s two variants. The single-motor RWD model gets an automaker-estimated 340 horsepower and 325 pounds-feet of torque, as well as an EPA-rated 312-mile range, while the dual-motor AWD model bumps total system horsepower to 500 and torque to 450 pounds-feet. The SUV employs a five-link front and rear suspension, which contributes to its smooth ride and handling, according to Cadillac. Four driver-selectable modes are available: My Mode, Sport, Snow/Ice and Tour. The Lyriq will be able to use DC fast charging at rates of up to 190 kilowatts, which adds 76 miles of range in about 10 minutes, according to the automaker’s estimates. Meanwhile, Level 2 home charging will max out at 19 kW, adding 52 miles of range per hour.\n\n2023 Cadillac Lyriq | Manufacturer image\n\nAdditionally, the Cadillac Lyriq offers one-pedal driving with Cadillac’s Regen on Demand technology that allows the driver to control the speed at which the SUV comes to a stop with a pressure-sensitive paddle on the steering wheel.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nAre We Driving Too Fast Toward a Self-Driving Future?\n2021 Cadillac XT6: New Entry-Level Luxury Trim, More Standard Features\nWhat’s New With Electric Vehicles for 2023?\nWhat to Know Before Purchasing an Electric Vehicle: A Buying Guide\nCadillac Celestiq: 300 Miles of Range for $300,000\nTrim, Pricing, Release Date\nCadillac Lyriq | Manufacturer image\n\nCurrently, orders for the 2023 Lyriq are full, and shoppers will need to wait to order the 2024 model, which will come in three trim levels: Tech, Luxury and Sport. The on-sale date and pricing for the 2024 model has not yet been announced; for 2023, the price for RWD variants started around $63,000 and $65,000 for AWD. Additionally, the Lyriq comes with a $1,500 credit to use toward the cost of installing Level 2 home charging or two years of unlimited charging sessions at EVgo public charging stations.\n\nRecent changes to the federal EV tax credit guidelines recategorized the Lyriq as an SUV instead of a car. This means eligible shoppers will most likely be able to take advantage of the $7,500 credit as the SUV now falls under the $80,000 price cap.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Cadillac Lyriq?\n\nThe Cadillac Lyriq is a luxury electric SUV that’s roughly the size of gas-powered SUVs like the Audi Q7, BMW X5 and Cadillac’s own XT6. It’s available with either a single motor on the rear axle, producing 365 horsepower and 325 pounds-feet of torque, or with front and rear motors providing all-wheel drive and a combined 515 hp and 450 pounds-feet. A 102-kilowatt-hour battery pack gives rear-wheel-drive Lyriqs an EPA-rated range of 326 miles per charge, while AWD versions are rated at 303 or 319 miles, depending on trim. Lyriq competitors include the Acura ZDX, Audi Q8 e-Tron, BMW iX, Mercedes-EQ EQE SUV and Volvo EX90.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Cadillac Lyriq?\n\nIntroduced for the 2023 model year, the Lyriq is largely unchanged for 2025. A standard OnStar package now provides eight years of automatic crash response and remote vehicle access, while uplevel trims get a standard hands-free power liftgate and rearview mirror camera that provides a clear view behind the vehicle even when the driver’s line of sight is obstructed by passengers or cargo.\n\nHow Much Range Does the 2025 Cadillac Lyriq Have?\n\nThe Lyriq’s EPA-estimated range runs from 303-326 miles, depending on drivetrain and trim.\n\nHow Long Does It Take to Charge the 2025 Cadillac Lyriq?\n\nCadillac does not quote charge times, instead giving maximum range added per hour of charging. With a standard 11.5-kilowatt 240-volt Level 2 charger, the Lyriq adds about 30 miles of range per hour. An available 19.2-kW charger bumps that up to about 50 miles per hour of charging. On a DC fast charger, the Lyriq can go from an unspecified “low state of charge” to 80% in about 45 minutes.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Cadillac Lyriq Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nFixed panoramic glass roof\nPower liftgate\nSynthetic leather upholstery\nHeated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\n33-inch combination digital instrument cluster and infotainment screen \nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nWireless phone charging\nBlind spot intervention\nForward collision warning with automatic emergency braking\n360-degree camera system\nAutomated parking\nSafety Alert Seat (vibrates the sides of or the entire driver’s seat bottom cushion to alert the driver to the direction of a potential hazard)\nTeen Driver (limits certain vehicle functions when a specific key fob is used to start the vehicle)\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nSuper Cruise hands-free highway driving\nOpening and closing panoramic glass roof\nNappa leather upholstery\nTri-zone climate control\nVentilated, massaging front seats\nHeated second-row seats\n19-speaker AKG Studio sound system\nShould I Buy the 2025 Cadillac Lyriq?\n\nAmericans buy more Lyriqs than any other Cadillac except the Escalade, and for good reason. Electric motors lend themselves particularly well to luxury vehicles, with silent operation and substantial low-speed torque enhancing their stately environment and sense of power. The Lyriq’s cabin and seats are comfortable, market-leading tech is either standard or available, it has a reasonable range, and it’s priced competitively.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The all-electric Lyriq is a classy, good-looking luxury mid-size SUV that drives like a classic Cadillac: big, heavy, quiet and — above all else — comfortable.\n\nVersus the competition: It’s far more stylish and opulent inside than anything from Tesla, and it’s easier to use than anything from Mercedes-Benz; with its distinctive good looks, solidly competitive range and decent pricing, the Lyriq is a viable choice for luxury electric SUV shoppers.\n\nThe Cadillac Lyriq has been in dealerships for two years now, but would you believe this was our first chance to get behind the wheel of one for more than a couple of minutes? GM had a very slow production ramp-up of the 2023 Lyriq, with just a trickle making it out of the automaker’s Tennessee factory in its first year-plus of production, supposedly due to an issue with the new Ultium battery system. Now, for the 2024 model year, the bugs have been worked out and cars are flowing onto dealer lots in much higher volumes — and into press fleets. Now that we’ve finally, finally had some seat time in one, we can give you our take on this significant addition to Cadillac showrooms. \n\nRelated: All-Electric 2024 Cadillac Lyriq Gains New Equipment, Starts at $58,590\n\nAfter two years of waiting, what do we think of the two-row all-electric Lyriq SUV? Is it any good? Is an electric Cadillac just a fad? Is it better than a Tesla Model X or Mercedes-EQ EQE SUV? \n\nJust What Is an ‘Ultium Vehicle’?\n\nGM has created a whole electric vehicle architecture called “Ultium.” That name refers both to the battery system and the platform itself, both of which can be scaled up or down depending on the size of the vehicle using it. That means an Ultium vehicle can be as huge as a GMC Hummer EV heavy-duty pickup truck or as small as a Chevrolet Equinox EV compact SUV. The Lyriq is the first (but not the last) Cadillac to use the Ultium platform, and it’s a fairly hefty two-row mid-size SUV that will be one of four electric SUVs in Cadillac showrooms in the next couple of years. Slotting above the Lyriq will be a three-row Vistiq (coming next year) and the flagship Escalade IQ; coming in below it will be the new Optiq compact SUV. The platform also forms the basis of the hand-built, super-luxury, totally made-to-order Celestiq luxury car.\n\nThe Lyriq also features the newest expression of Cadillac styling, which is either bold and avant garde or a bit of an angular mess, depending on whom you ask. It’s certainly not conventionally beautiful, but it is striking and unique. From its accent lighting up front to its segmented taillights, nothing else looks quite like the Lyriq. Cadillac is also doing some absolutely dynamite paint colors, including the one on my test vehicle, which Cadillac calls Nimbus Metallic but you and I would probably just call baby blue. My test vehicle was a Luxury trim (there are also base Tech and distinctly styled Sport trims) with 22-inch wheels and a black painted roof option. \n\nUnder the Hood\n\nPowering the Lyriq is one of two electric powertrains: a rear-wheel-drive single-motor setup that’s good for 340 horsepower or an all-wheel-drive dual-motor system pumping out 500 hp; both are powered by a 102-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack. The RWD version has 314 miles of EPA-estimated range, while the AWD model has 307 miles of range. Using a Level 2 charger, recharging can happen at rates up to 19.2 kilowatts in a Lyriq equipped with an optional 19.2-kW-capable onboard charger; that setup can add up to 51 miles of range per hour of charge time. The Lyriq can DC fast-charge at up to 190 kW in ideal conditions, getting you 77 miles of range in about 10 minutes. Those numbers are about mid-pack these days in terms of DC charging speed and driving range — perfectly adequate, but certainly not class-leading. As always, the speed at which your vehicle charges on a DC fast charger depends on a lot of things, including the battery’s state of charge, ambient and battery temperature, the load on the charger itself and many other factors. \n\nMy bigger question with the Lyriq was how well its 340 hp and 325 pounds-feet of torque would move a vehicle this hefty; lithium-ion batteries are not light, and a 102-kWh pack is pretty sizable. The Lyriq weighs more than 5,500 pounds, which is as much as a Chevrolet Tahoe full-size SUV. Would 340 hp be enough to deliver adequate performance?\n\nBig and Comfy, Cadillac-Style\n\nThe Lyriq’s driving experience is quite good. You feel the heft of this car, but its weight is down low because that big battery is in the floor beneath your feet. The steering feels firm and hefty, the brakes are quite strong, and acceleration (even in the less powerful RWD model) is more than adequate. The Lyriq is also a supremely stately highway cruiser, with quiet operation, a compliant ride and very comfortable seats. It is not, however, athletic; you won’t want to flog this thing down back roads. But that isn’t its mission. This is a luxury SUV meant for comfortably transporting people and cargo, and it does very well in that regard. \n\nThere are a couple of interesting driving-related features in the Lyriq. It does have different drive modes, but they’re buried in a menu and require a few taps on the touchscreen to change between them — meaning you’re not likely to do so while driving. There’s a one-pedal-driving button that’s easier to find on the touchscreen, and the system can be adjusted for normal or highly aggressive operation. On the back of the steering wheel is an interesting pressure-sensitive paddle that also activates the regenerative braking system. The harder you pull on it, the more aggressively it slows the Lyriq; you almost never have to touch the brakes when driving this car. And, of course, GM’s Super Cruise hands-free driving system, which can change lanes on its own, is available. It generally works as flawlessly as ever. \n\nLovely to Look At, Cheap to the Touch\n\nTaking a look around the Lyriq’s interior, at first glance, it really looks fantastic. It’s beautifully styled, with interesting shapes, clever lighting and neat details, like knurled-metal-look trim on the cupholders and dash. Once you start touching bits of it, however, you realize Cadillac had to thin out a lot of the trim in order to keep the car from weighing over 6,000 pounds. That leaves nearly everything in the interior looking great but feeling cheap, including the center console plastic and the hollow-sounding dash. \n\nCadillac did spend a bit of money on the 33-inch organic light-emitting diode digital display, however, which is a continuous curved panel with touchscreen sections flanking both sides of a reconfigurable instrument cluster. The multimedia system runs Google Built-In software, but unlike many of GM’s other new electric cars, you also get wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto in the Lyriq (which makes me really doubt GM’s excuses as to why it leaves this connectivity out of the Chevy Blazer EV and Equinox EV, as well as the upcoming Cadillac Optiq). The touchscreen works about as well as most touchscreens, which is to say not perfectly, but Cadillac deserves major props for retaining physical climate and volume controls. Those props, of course, have to be taken right back due to the touch-sensitive controls on the Lyriq’s steering wheel, which is a control type that should never be on any steering wheel. Have we learned nothing from Mercedes-Benz?\n\nNot Even Crazy Expensive\n\nAs a luxury SUV, the new Lyriq is really quite nice. It’s comfy, relatively spacious, beautiful to look at, lovely to use, and it behaves like most other electric SUVs. There’s nothing too crazy or unusual about any of it aside from its rather eye-catching styling, and it’s not even too outrageously priced, with my test vehicle coming in at $73,000 and change (including destination fee). Given it qualifies for a $7,500 federal tax credit, that brings the price down to the mid-$60,000 range, which is even better. It’s not hard to see why Cadillac has seen sales of the Lyriq steadily climb as supply finally catches up with demand. It’s a solid entry in the luxury electric SUV field, and it’s worthy of a look.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2024 Cadillac Lyriq EV’s Federal Tax Credit Restored\nWhat to Know Before Purchasing an Electric Vehicle: A Buying Guide\nElectric Cars With the Longest Range\nResearch the 2024 Cadillac Lyriq\nShop for a 2024 Cadillac Lyriq\n\nRelated Video: \n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Is the New Cadillac Lyriq-V Quick?\n\nAbsolutely! Cadillac quotes the Lyriq-V’s 0-60 mph time at 3.3 seconds, made possible by the SUV’s impressive 615 horsepower, instant 650 pounds-feet of torque and standard launch control.\n\nWhat Does the Cadillac Lyriq-V Compete With?\n\nMain competitors include the more expensive Mercedes-AMG EQE SUV and BMW iX M70, the smaller Porsche Macan Electric and the less powerful Audi SQ6 e-Tron.\n\nI’d be genuinely impressed if you understand the true ethos of the new 2026 Cadillac Lyriq-V purely from Caddy’s messaging. The brand is quite vocal that this 615-horsepower all-electric SUV is the quickest-accelerating production Cadillac in history but doesn’t mention that this is more of a happy personality quirk than an intentional characteristic. In other words: Caddy’s first all-electric “V” was always going to be quick by virtue of its electric powertrain.\n\nRelated: 2026 Cadillac Lyriq-V: Slicker and Quicker\n\nThe rest is more subtle. The lack of a Blackwing nameplate appendage here is the biggest tell: In the same tempo as the non-Blackwing CT4-V and CT5-V, think of the new Lyriq-V and forthcoming Optiq-V as Caddy’s alternatives to Audi’s S-line e-Tron products, Mercedes-AMG’s EQs and BMW’s iX M70. Like the rest of this competitive field, the Lyriq-V’s character is that of balance, not brutality — the latter available in the Blackwings and AMG’s hybrid E Performance variants.\n\nHow Much Power Does the 2026 Cadillac Lyriq-V Have?\n\nA rather long-winded way to say the Lyriq-V offers measured fun that’ll mash your face on an empty on-ramp, then massage your rump on a clogged off-ramp. The V’s 615 hp and 650 pounds-feet of torque isn’t too hair-raising when compared to the standard dual-motor Lyriq’s 515 hp and 450 pounds-feet, but it’s the Lyriq-V’s delivery of this extra-cream top that’ll have passengers reaching for the “Please slow down!” grab handle.\n\nA regular dual-motor Lyriq cracks 0-60 mph in the sprightly, modestly thrilling high-four-second range, so achieved through simply flooring it from a stoplight, on-ramp, Trader Joe’s parking lot exit or your annoying neighbor’s side yard. Engage the Lyriq-V’s standard launch control function, and the official 0-60 figure drops to 3.3 seconds en route to a quarter-mile time “under 12 seconds,” according to Cadillac.\n\nImpressive on paper, impressive in the real world. I engaged launch control a number of times during the drive program’s feature demo and reckon the acceleration rides the fine, carbon-fiber line between neat and nauseating. Your average Lyriq buyer likely wouldn’t want more than what the Lyriq-V offers, as it has more than enough neck-straining accelerative gut pressure to surprise even the most jaded of CTS-V enthusiasts.\n\nEqually surprising is how well this medium-spicy Lyriq takes to an autocross or one of the lovely wooded back roads weaving through the lush Pacific Northwest. An inventory of the V’s go-get-’em weaponry is telling: There are Brembo calipers for just the front wheels, and a traditional, valve-based adaptive suspension contrasts with the widespread use of magnetorheological-based Magnetic Ride Control in other GM performance cars.\n\nHow Does the 2026 Cadillac Lyriq-V Handle?\n\nSo, not a comprehensive motorsports-ready setup, but it’s a well-balanced one that allows for some dynamic fun when a Lyriq-V owner finds themselves facing down an empty mountain pass. With nothing at risk other than some crushed cones, I hurled the Lyriq-V through Cadillac’s parking-lot autocross with a level of aggression and abuse exponentially beyond what you can expect any electric crossover to suffer in day-to-day use.\n\nIt’s hardly the second coming of ye olde CTS-V Sport Wagon, but the Lyriq-V pulls a decent impression of a finely appointed 5,980-pound hot hatch. The standard performance tires — measuring P275/40R22 front and rear — return admirable grip, with loud, screaming understeer only occurring well beyond the threshold of reasonable capability. Directional changes are also impressive for the SUV’s size and bulk, but there’s absolutely no mistaking the Lyriq-V for the mid-size electric crossover that it is.\n\nSteering and braking are expectedly digital and nearly devoid of feel or nuance, but that’s the case all the way up the electric-vehicle ladder save for very few exceptions. Brake blend (the balance between the regenerative resistance and physical brakes) is average, with more than a few moments of herky-jerky braking during my 120-mile drive. Operator error? Most certainly, but I found it difficult to fully adapt to by the end of the day.\n\nHow Comfortable Is the 2026 Cadillac Lyriq-V?\n\nThe on-demand regen paddle on the left of the steering wheel is a hoot, as it is in other GM EVs. Familiar since the dearly departed Chevrolet Volt, this cheeky regen paddle has evolved from a moderately effective binary on/off brake button to a well-tuned rheostat that can provide a bit of braking or seriously scrub speed. In concert with the automatic max-regen setting and front Brembo clampers, the 3-ton Caddy hauls itself down from a 615-hp rush with face-smushing effectiveness.\n\nAs for drive modes, I oscillated between the Lyriq-V’s Tour (comfort) and V-Mode settings, depending on both environment and attitude. Left alone, the Lyriq-V is a requisitely comfortable day-to-day luxury crossover, with only a moderate amount of compromise in ride quality over broken or rough pavement. Noise and road-grain isolation is appropriate for the price, purpose and badge, though buyers who simply want the topline Lyriq might do well to get a loaded, non-V dual-motor version instead.\n\nStill, you can expect a loaded Lyriq-V to have all the interior finery and tech present elsewhere in the lineup. This includes the model’s elegant 33-inch dashtop display that combos as both driver information cluster and center infotainment interface and is supported by an augmented reality head-up display as well as a strip of physical controls for climate and volume functions.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nIs the 2025 Cadillac Lyriq a Good Electric SUV? 5 Pros, 2 Cons\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2025 Cadillac Lyriq?\nElectric Cars With the Longest Range\nWhat to Know Before Purchasing an Electric Vehicle: A Buying Guide\nShop for a 2026 Cadillac Lyriq Near You\nDoes the 2026 Cadillac Lyriq-V Have Apple CarPlay and Android Auto?\n\nCadillac’s Google-based infotainment system is both handsome to look at and reactive to use. Wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are present, but the built-in Google navigation is begrudgingly becoming my preferred method. Everything else is exactly what you’d expect in an $80,000-plus Cadillac, with its heated, ventilated and massaging front seats, wireless device charging, available leather upholstery, intricate trim, knurled accents, and a comprehensively muted and softened environment that’ll be familiar to the modern Cadillac customer.\n\nAnd for those already versed in Lyriq, both charging and range will be familiar. Though it’s powered by the same 102-kilowatt-hour battery, all that extra power predictably cuts the Lyriq-V’s estimated driving range to 285 miles, down from the regular dual-motor Lyriq’s 319 miles. The brand was a bit cagey about the V’s max DC fast-charging rate, but I expect it’ll be identical to the regular Lyriq’s 190-kilowatt maximum rate based on the stated charging scenarios. According to Cadillac, the Lyriq-V will gain “up to 75 miles of range in about 10 minutes of charging” and will go “from a low state of charge to 80% in about 41 minutes.” Not bad, but not great.\n\nIt’s satisfying when a vehicle adheres solidly to its expectations even if there’s a bit of a philosophical tangle to unravel. The 2026 Cadillac Lyriq-V is one of the brand’s high notes, embodying all the duality expected of the badge. Just make sure you wouldn’t be better served by the less expensive, longer-legged and still-powerful dual-motor Lyriq.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
