      "expert_review": "When it comes to automobiles, images and perceptions don’t change easily.\n\nDespite such recent cars as the sporty, import-oriented Seville and Eldorado and the recently deceased Allante convertible, Cadillac still is best known for building huge, chrome-laden V-8-powered luxury cars that are fast, plush and comfortable.\n\nAnd those three words – fast, plush and comfortable – best sum up this week’s test car, the Deville Concours.\n\nCadillac has made an aggressive move toward capturing a younger group of buyers with its array of fast sports sedans and coupes. But the General Motors luxury car division hasn’t abandoned its older customers, those who want nothing to do with bucket seats, tachometers and floor shifters.\n\nThe Concours is a traditional six-passenger Cadillac that has been outfitted with a responsive suspension system and a high-tech drivetrain.\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nWith a curb weight of just under 2 tons, the Deville Concours is one of the heaviest cars on the market.\n\nBut you’d never know that by the fast pace in which it accelerates or by the efficient manner in which it uses unleaded premium fuel.\n\nUnder the long, wide hood of the Deville rests Cadillac’s magnificent 270-horsepower, 32-valve double overhead cam Northstar V-8. Thanks in part to its platinum-tipped spark plugs, the Northstar engine won’t need any maintenance other than regular fluid and filter changes for 100,000 miles.\n\nPower, sent to the front wheels through a computer-controlled four-speed automatic, is smooth, plentiful and abundant. Cadillac says the Concours can accelerate from 0-to-60 mph in a respectable 8.2 seconds. Traction control, which prevents the front wheels from spinning on slick surfaces, is standard.\n\nEven with four passengers aboard, the Deville Concours has no trouble muscling past slower traffic.\n\nThe transmission shifts through the gears without giving much notice to the driver. However, when accelerating at fullspeed, one can feel a very slight tugging to the left or right as the front tires attempt to bite the road.\n\nUsing the air conditioner, I averaged 17.2 mpg in city driving and 27 on the highway.\n\nHANDLING\n\nThe Concours is no sports sedan, but it handles gracefully through a curve and offers a very quiet ride. Cadillac engineers have done a nice job keeping engine and road noise out of the interior of the car.\n\nThe car’s underpinnings include a four-wheel independent suspension system, speed-sensitive power-assisted rack-and-pinion steering and four-wheel anti-lock disc brakes.\n\nYou won’t expend much effort to drive the Concours. It seems to be engineered with older drivers in mind. For instance, the steering is fairly light, but it’s tight and responsive. There is little or no play in the wheel.\n\nUnlike older, full-size Cadillacs, the Concours’ body won’t lean much as you hustle around a corner.\n\nThe ride is soft and most bumps are easily di spensed with without affecting the driver’s ability to control the car. That is, not much turbulence finds its way back to the helm.\n\nOverall, the car is stable, predictable and easy to live with.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nInitially, I found the interior a bit awkward. When you first open the door and sit down, you feel as if you are sitting too low to the ground.\n\nThe flat bench seats seem low in relation to the floor. Yet, once ensconced in the seats, you notice that front, rear and side visibility are excellent and that you are surrounded by a nicely designed and arranged interior.\n\nMost of the controls that adjust the seat are on the door panel, so, unlike other GM vehicles, you don’t have to reach down to the lower portion of the seat and fumble with switches and buttons.\n\nThe speedometer consists of an easy-on-the-eyes digital readout that shows you how fast you are going in big blue electronic numbers.\n\nOur test car came with a terrific Delco stere system that included a CD player.\n\nTwo rear-seat passengers were impressed with the lighted fold-d own mirrors in the headliner, just behind the front seat. Makeup can be checked and freshened without undue stress and strain, they said.\n\nAs with any full-size Cadillac, the Concours offers abundant room. Four of us traveled to a Sunday brunch in Mount Dora in comfort. The Concours easily could have accommodated another person.\n\nThere are two things that I didn’t care for. One is the fuel gauge. Actually, there isn’t a fuel gauge, just a computerized readout that shows you how many gallons of fuel you have left. I prefer the old-style gauge which tells when the tank is empty.\n\nThe second item is the trunk lid, which seemed flimsy. Also, when you press the remote control button on the key ring, the trunk pops open with enough force to knock out your dentures.\n\nIn any case, our test car sported one of the nicest paint jobs I’ve seen lately, a deep metallic green that was rich and full of luster. It really gave the test car a classy look.\n\nTruett’s tip: The 270-horsepower Deville Concours from Cadillac is a luxury sedan that is big, fast and comfortable.",

      "expert_review": "I SAID I liked the car. She smirked.\n\n“You’re not that old,” she said. “We’re not that old.”\n\nShe folded her arms and sat stone-faced in the front passenger seat. Spouse Person was upset. It had something to do with her approaching birthday, an event that would put her smack dab in the middle of middle age.\n\nShe was uncomfortable about this, and more than chary about anything that would signal her proximity to age 50, and this coming birthday puts her close to that turning point. I’m sure that’s really why she didn’t like the 1995 Cadillac Sedan DeVille.\n\n“Even the name sounds like an old folks’ home,” she said. “I hate this big ol’ car.”\n\nBut it was this week’s testmobile. So we drove it, and she complained: about the seats, “too low, too wide. Does Cadillac think that all old people have fat butts?”; the power seat buttons, “too many and poorly arranged”; the power window buttons, “too many”; and the side-view mirrors, “too narrow.”\n\nBackground: Spouse Person had a point. The huge, front-wheel-drive Sedan DeVille is designed specifically for people “over 50,” according to Cadillac’s marketers. To wit: “DeVille is for accomplished and confident people with active and diverse lifestyles, over 50, who want a prestigious large luxury vehicle which offers distinctive styling and superior power, comfort, convenience, and value,” according to Caddy promotional material.\n\nBut the reality is that the average age for a DeVille buyer is 67 — still active, perhaps, but at least two years past retirement. Those buyers have an average household income of $75,000, according to a Caddy marketing survey. Some 44 percent of DeVille buyers are college graduates, 69 percent are male, and 83 percent are married.\n\nWhen DeVille buyers leave Cadillac, they go to one of three places: Heaven, Hell or to a Ford Motor Co. dealership, where they buy a Lincoln Town Car.\n\nThus, Cadillac does what it can to make these customers as comfortable as possible in a bid to hold on to them as long as possible. That’s why all four of the sedan’s doors are wide. That makes it easier for less-nimble people to slide in and out of the car. That’s why the seats are not too high — older people often don’t want to climb up into a car. And comfort is why the front passenger seats are sooo wide.\n\nThe Sedan DeVille is a puffmobile. It has a 4.9-liter V-8 engine, which is not to be confused with Cadillac’s Northstar 32-valve V-8. The Sedan DeVille’s V-8 is a relatively conventional affair rated 200 horsepower at 4,100 rpm with torque set at 275 pound-feet at 3,000 rpm. The DeVille engine is quiet and reasonably capable of moving the car, which weighs 3,761 pounds.\n\nOf course, dual-front air bags are standard along with anti-lock brakes, traction control, wiper-activated headlamps (wipers on, lights on), and all of the appropriate side-impact barrier protection equipment, which reportedly allows the car t o be struck laterally at 15 mph without serious injury to vehicle occupants.\n\nThe Sedan DeVille seats six full-size adults comfortably, and it has enough trunk space, 20 cubic feet, to carry their stuff.\n\nComplaints: The seats are a bit too low and wide for younger backsides. There are too many buttons in disparate places to operate the power seats and windows. The side-view mirrors are too narrow.\n\nPraise: An excellent full-size sedan — a cruiser, easy to drive. Once you get accustomed to the DeVille’s seats, it’s quite comfortable to drive too. Heck, I like the thing, flaws and all.\n\nHead-turning quotient: Dignified. Respectable. Responsible. Stiff.\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: Superior ride. The Sedan DeVille literally floats. Very decent handling, considering the size, weight and less-than-sporting intentions of the car. So-so acceleration, zero to 60 in 9.4 seconds. Very good braking.\n\nMileage: About 23 miles per gallon (20-gallon tank, estimated 440-mile range on usable volume of required premium unleaded), running mostly highway with two occupants and light cargo.\n\nSound system: Ten-speaker AM/FM stereo radio and compact disc, GM Active Audio System. Very good.\n\nPrice: Base price is $34,900. Dealer invoice price is $36,051. Price as tested is $38,337 including $1,965 in options, $837 in federal luxury taxes and a $635 destination charge.\n\nPurse-strings note: The Cadillac Sedan DeVille is truly one of a kind. You either hate it or you love it. The closest competitor is the Lincoln Town Car, which has a more European flavor.",

      "expert_review": "Some people won’t buy a General Motors Corp. vehicle. One of them is a colleague. He had a bad experience with a Chevrolet Blazer, and he isn’t going back to GM any time soon. This column isn’t for him.\n\nOthers would buy a GM product, but not a Cadillac. They view Caddies as hearses. They want to hold on to life. Reminders of demise aren’t part of their value system. This column is for them.\n\nOpening their minds could lead to a better life, especially on the road. I have the key: the 2000 Cadillac DeVille DHS sedan.\n\nThe DHS will remain pretty much the same for 2001. That’s a good thing. As presented, the car is a nearly perfect blend of tradition and innovation.\n\nTradition bespeaks comfort, luxury, convenience–things that Cadillac once thought appealed exclusively to affluent older people. That’s why many Cadillac buyers are in their mid-sixties. They didn’t become “rich” until their children were off the parental dole and the mortgage was paid.\n\nBut “rich” and “affluent” no longer mean what they used to, at least not in terms of age. Nowadays, there are a bunch of 30- and 40-somethings running around with big bucks, albeit it in somewhat unstable Internet dollars. Those people buy luxury vehicles, but they tend to go foreign.\n\nCadillac’s strategy is to woo the young wealthy while holding on to the gray rich. It is a cautious tactic that involves going after the affluent 20- and 30-somethings with the sporty Catera, wooing the 40- and 50-somethings with the light and tight Seville STS, and pursuing hipsters 45 to 55 years old with the larger, sporty DeVille DTS.\n\nThe DHS is for folks 55 to 65 years old who remain interested in performance in all aspects of their lives but who have a growing taste for elegance. These people delight equally in surprising their mates and shocking their rivals, and doing both with style.\n\nThe DHS is perfect for that mission.\n\nFirst, it’s a good-looking car, as evidenced by the heads it turned and favorable comments it received during nearly 500 miles of driving.\n\nSecond, the car can run. Credit Cadillac’s 32-valve, double-overhead-cam 4.6-liter Northstar V-8, which produces 275 horsepower in the DHS. Numerous improvements have been made to that engine since its introduction in 1992, but the latest model has the best fix yet. It’s designed to run on regular unleaded gasoline, so there’s no need to buy the substantially more expensive 93-octane premium fuel required for earlier Northstars.\n\nThird, the DHS suspension system, though softer than that in the DTS model, still does an excellent job of keeping the car stable and wobble-free in tight curves and crash-avoidance maneuvers. That is partly because the tested DHS came with Cadillac’s optional StabiliTrak 2.0 system, which electronically controls side-to-side movement and the amount of steering effort needed, for example, to negotiate curves. StabiliTrak is standard on the DTS.\n\nFinally, there is the matter of security. The OnStar emergency communications and navigation system comes as standard equipment in all DeVille models. For 2001, Cadillac is adding wireless Internet access as part of an upgraded “infotainment system” that will keep you in touch with the world, assuming you’re interested in remaining linked.\n\nThere also is an optional infrared night-vision system that allows you to see beyond the headlights, giving you more time to react to animals or people wandering along dark roads.\n\nPut simply, luxury-car shoppers who cling to an anti-Cadillac bias and ignore the DeVille DHS could be cutting themselves out of one of the best automotive values of their lives.\n\nNuts &amp; Bolts\n\n2000 Cadillac DeVille DHS Suggestion: GM should make the night-vision controls more accessible. They currently are situated underneath the left side of the dashboard, making them hard to reach, especially f or in-traffic adjustments.\n\nPraise: This is a finely crafted, well-engineered, highly competitive full-size luxury car. It takes on all comers in its category.\n\nHead-turning quotient: Very high and favorable. This is the first Cadillac I’ve driven that actually inspired envy.\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: A triumvirate of excellence. No complaints. It also stops smartly. Brakes include power four-wheel discs with standard anti-locks.\n\nLayout: Tranversely mounted engine, front-wheel drive.\n\nModels: Base DeVille, full-luxury DHS, sporty-luxury DTS.\n\nCapacities: Seats six people. Trunk capacity is 19.1 cubic feet. Holds 18.5 gallons of gasoline. Can be equipped to tow up to 2,000 pounds (though to use this car this way would be an abomination).\n\nMileage: I averaged 26 miles per gallon in mostly highway driving.\n\nPrice: Bring money. Base price on the tested DHS is $45,095. Dealer invoice price on base model is $41,874. Price as tested is $53,185, including $7,420 in options and a $670 destination charge.\n\nPurse-strings note: Compare with Lincoln Town Car, Acura RL and Lexus LS 400.",

      "expert_review": "Once the industry’s top-selling luxury car, Cadillac now ranks fifth behind Lexus, Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Lincoln.\n\nLots of reasons for the decline, one being more luxury cars from which to choose, especially entry-level vehicles around $30,000, where Cadillac flubbed with the Catera in the 1997 model year, a nice midsize, rear-wheel-drive sedan that failed to generate interest because it looked like a Chevy.\n\nFool ’em once, as Cadillac tried with the Cimarron, a Chevrolet Cavalier with leather seats and Cadillac crest in the grille in the ’80s, but not twice, as it tried with Catera.\n\nOthers argue Cadillac suffers from styling gone bleak. Valid argument, except that nothing in the luxury segment forces eyes to pop from sockets.\n\nOne reason for Cadillac’s woes hasn’t gotten a lot of notice. Cadillac has been a technological innovator (OK, some flubs, like the V-8-6-4 as well as diesel engines in the ’80s) and has pioneered of a variety of high-tech systems the luxury crowd craves.\n\nBut the systems are inside or underneath so you can’t see, smell, taste or touch them.\n\nFor example, Cadillac brought out StabiliTrak to keep the vehicle pointed in the direction you wanted to go regardless of road surface thanks to sensors that corrected for oversteer or understeer to prevent slip, slide or skid.\n\nAnd then it added road-sensing suspension to even out the rough spots on the pavement by adjusting suspension softness or firmness every 6 to 7 inches of roadway travel to control body and wheel motion.\n\nAnd the Cadillac Northstar V-8 is every bit as good as the V-8-6-4 was bad.\n\nCadillac also pioneered OnStar emergency communications to summon mechanical or medical help, and Night Vision, an infrared heat imaging system to project on the lower windshield whatever is lurking in or along the road regardless of darkness or weather.\n\nYet these are all take-it-for-granted systems. When you don’t skid, you don’t tip your hat to StabiliTrak, you pat yourself on the back for being a skilled driver.\n\nWe tested a pair of offerings that epitomize Cadillac’s past, the 2001 DeVille DTS, and its future, the 2002 Escalade all-wheel-drive sport-utility vehicle.\n\nThe ’02 Escalade has been redesigned so it doesn’t look like the thinly disguised (leather seats/Cadillac crest in grille) derivative of the GMC Yukon/Chevy Tahoe SUVs it has been since it was rushed to market in the middle of the 1999 model year, when Cadillac saw folks standing in line for large SUVs with Lincoln logos in the grille.\n\nThe 2002 Escalade sports the Cadillac look of the future, with sharply chiseled body lines and grille/hood that borrows its design from Cadillac concepts, the Evoq roadster in 1999 and the Imaj sedan in 2000. That’s the same design theme to be used in the Catera replacement; a Luxury-Activity Vehicle, or LAV, sport-ute/wagon; and a two-seat roadster in the ’03 timeframe, as w ell as an assortment of redesigned vehicles beyond that, many rear-wheel-drive.\n\nWith its bold front end; flared, sharply creased wheel wells; and large, protective plastic lower body extensions, the ’02 Escalade doesn’t look like a Yukon/Tahoe.\n\nAnd Escalade has StabiliTrak to help it behave like a family sedan; road-sensing suspension to ensure the boat doesn’t float; responsive steering system so it acts like a sport-ute half its size; and OnStar in case you need mechanical or medical help, or, heaven forbid, to locate the vehicle if stolen with the system’s global positioning satellites.\n\nAnd there are little touches, like pushing a button so the power outside mirrors fold up and aren’t bumped in the carwash; perforated leather seats that breathe so you stay dry in the summer; enough power plugs for a fleet of cellphones or computers; and three rows of seats to hold the family.\n\nHowever, with three rows of seats in use, you don’t have a lot of car room behind. And to get to the third seat, you have to fold the second seat back and climb over. At least when you need more cargo room, the third row quickly flips and folds out of the way.\n\nThe 6-liter, 345-horsepower V-8 in the 4WD Escalade we tested is alert off the line or into and out of the passing lane, while being smooth and quiet.\n\nAt a time when many folks are hiding their eyes when passing SUV showrooms and/or gas pumps, Escalade sales are up 38 percent since March, when the 2002 model began arriving at dealerships.\n\nBase price: $49,290. Only option is a power sunroof, overpriced at $1,550. A less expensive $47,290 two-wheel-drive Escalade for the Sun Belt with a 5.3-liter, 285-h.p. V-8 has been added for 2002.\n\nDavid Schiavone, assistant brand manager for Escalade, said the sales target for this year is about 32,000 units. In the fall, Cadillac will add an EXT, basically Escalade with a small pickup bed, a luxury clone of the Avalanche SUV/truck hybrid from Chevy.\n\nTurning to DeVille, we tested the five-seat DTS (with buckets and a center console; six seats in DHS with bench), which has all the electronic magic in Escalade. It has the size and weight that luxury buyers favor, at least the older luxury buyers to whom bigger is better and who still weep at the loss of tailfins. (The new breed of luxury buyer tends to favor smaller, lighter, more nimble entry-level types.)\n\nDeVille is powered by a quiet, yet powerful 4.6-liter, 300-h.p. Northstar V-8 (275 h.p. in DHS) with another novel but rarely noticed feature, starter disengage so that if you mistakenly twist the key to the “on” position while idling, the starter disengages to prevent the metallic grind that notifies all around that a goofus forgot the engine was running and tried to start it again.\n\nContinuously variable, road-sensing suspension provides a smoother ride and more sure-footed handling without lean, sway or float than many luxury sedans deliver. While Japanese luxury sedans tend to rock you to sleep if not bore you to tears, DeVille, like European luxury sedans, allows you to enjoy the driving experience.\n\nAnd there’s StabiliTrak, OnStar, Night Vision, four-wheel anti-lock brakes, all-speed traction control, rain-sensing wipers with wiper-activated headlamps, 12-way power heated and massaging (rollers that move up and down) front seats/heated rear seats and ultrasonic rear parking assist that uses visual and audio warnings of how close you are to objects (a car when parking, a child on a bike when leaving the driveway) when backing up.\n\nThe cabin is roomy and cozy, front to rear, and the trunk lets you slip the golf bags in and out without hang-up.\n\nA fault? Sure, the tail end looks bulky and bulbous. And the DTS designation leaves us cold. But DeVille can’t be blamed for its biggest fault, the fact Cadillac doesn’t have a noteworthy $30,000 companion to get young folks into the family so they’ll move up to DeVille and eventually Escalade as income and age increase.\n\nBase price: $46,267. Only option really needed is Night Vision, at a stiff $2,250.\n\nFor 2003 the Catera replacement, to be called CTS, will be built off GM’s new Sigma platform, which reportedly will be shared by the LAV and next-generation DeVille and Seville, but not Eldorado, which will be dropped.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nA Protection Series sedan, offered in both standard and stretch versions, has joined the DeVille lineup for 2005. It’s equipped with bullet-resistant glass and ballistic protection for the roof and rear seatback.\n\nFor all DeVille models, the standard OnStar communication system gains upgraded hands-free capability.\n\nTwo versions of Cadillac’s Northstar V-8 engine are available in the DeVille, which is Cadillac’s largest model and the last remaining one with front-wheel drive.\n\nCadillac last redesigned its full-size front-drive sedan for the 2000 model year, and another redesign is due for 2006. At that time, the DeVille name will be dropped in favor of DTS, currently the name of a trim level. Cadillac’s optional Night Vision system, introduced with the 2000 redesign, is no longer available for factory ordering.\n\nExterior\nThe current DeVille is more rounded and bulky in appearance than models of the 1990s and before. Measuring 207 inches long overall, the four-door sedan rides a 115.3-inch wheelbase. GM’s StabiliTrak electronic stability system is standard on the DTS trim level and optional on the base and DHS models. The extended-length Protection Series sedan is 215.2 inches long overall on a 123.6-inch wheelbase.\n\nInterior\nA split front bench seat is standard in the base and DHS models. The DTS comes only with front bucket seats and a floor-mounted shift lever. Rear legroom is ample even when the front seats are moved all the way back. The trunk holds 19.1 cubic feet of cargo and has a low liftover for easy loading.\n\nHeated and cooled front seats and a heated steering wheel are standard in the DHS and DTS sedans and optional in the base DeVille. GM’s OnStar communication system can be fitted with premium services. XM Satellite Radio and a navigation system are optional.\n\nUnder the Hood\nBase, DHS and Protection Series versions are equipped with Cadillac’s 275-horsepower, 4.6-liter Northstar V-8, while a 290-hp version of that engine is installed in the DTS. Both V-8s work with a four-speed-automatic transmission and can run on regular fuel, but Cadillac recommends premium gasoline for peak performance and fuel economy.\n\nSafety\nSide-impact airbags are standard for the front seats and optional for rear-seat positions. The front airbag on the passenger side also protects the middle passenger. An ultrasonic rear parking-assist system is available.\n\nDriving Impressions\nThe DeVille may be a Cadillac of the old school, but it is packed with modern technology. Strong Northstar V-8 performance blends with admirable transmission operation in the smooth-functioning powertrain. Downshifts are prompt and certain, yet smooth. The DTS practically leaps ahead from a standstill and responds almost as effectively for passing and merging. At certain speeds, the response is a little less vigorous.\n\nThe DeVille steers with a light touch and doesn’t feel as taut as some competitors � especially import brands. But the easygoing, genteel ride also isn’t as woozy or floaty as Cadillacs of the past.\n\nAll seats are big, relatively soft and reasonably supportive, and the instruments in the DTS are very easy to read. Engine noise is blissfully subdued and muted, and other sounds are minimal.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nAn armored edition that is available in both standard and stretch versions joins the Cadillac DeVille lineup for 2004. Heated and cooled front seats are now standard in the DHS and DTS sedans and optional in the base DeVille; a heated steering wheel is included. Cadillac’s adaptive seat feature has been dropped, and a manual parking-brake release is now used.\n\nCadillac redesigned its full-size front-wheel-drive sedan for the 2000 model year, softening its shape and making it the first car to offer Night Vision. Employing infrared, heat-sensing technology, Night Vision projects an image of the road into a head-up display ahead of the windshield. Thus, the driver can see three to five times farther than the headamps’ reach. Night Vision is newly optional for the base DeVille. Two versions of Cadillac’s Northstar V-8 engine are available.\n\nExterior\nThe DeVille is more rounded and bulky in appearance than models of the 1990s and before. The sedan is 207 inches long overall and rides a 115.3-inch wheelbase. GM’s StabiliTrak electronic stability system is standard on the DTS sedan and optional on other trim levels.\n\nInterior\nA split, front bench seat is standard in the base and DHS models. The DTS comes only with front bucket seats and a floor-mounted shift lever. The backseat has ample legroom even when the front seats are moved all the way back. The trunk holds 19.1 cubic feet and has a low liftover for easy loading; its lid swings open 90 degrees.\n\nGM’s standard OnStar communication system can be fitted with premium services. An XM Satellite Radio and a navigation system are offered as options.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe base and DHS versions are equipped with Cadillac’s 275-horsepower, 4.6-liter Northstar V-8, while a 300-hp version of that engine is installed in the DTS.

An ultrasonic rear parking-assist system is optional.\n\nDriving Impressions\nThe DeVille may be a Cadillac of the old school, but it comes packed with modern technology and gadgetry. Strong Northstar V-8 performance blends with admirable transmission operation in the smooth-functioning powertrain. Downshifts are prompt and certain yet smooth and nearly gentle. The DTS practically leaps ahead from a standstill and responds almost as effectively for passing and merging. At certain speeds, the response is a little less vigorous. The DeVille steers with a light touch and doesn’t feel as taut as some competitors, especially those in the ranks of some import brands. The easygoing, genteel ride isn’t as woozy or floaty as Cadillacs of the past.\n\nThe seats are big, relatively soft and reasonably supportive, and the instruments in the DTS are exceptionally easy to read. Engine noise is blissfully subdued and muted, and other sounds are minimal. Visibility is generally good; the back window is a tad squat, and massive rear roof pillars may limit the driver’s view for parking and lane changes.",

      "expert_review": "Even the longest journey, it is said, starts with a single step.\n\nCadillac has taken that step, though admittedly a small one, by slipping past Acura into fourth place in luxury-car sales through July from fifth in May.\n\nBut the luxury-car maker still has to journey past BMW, Lexus and Mercedes-Benz to regain the top spot it last held in the 1998 calendar year.\n\nIt’s still about 10,000 units behind Mercedes, but has closed the gap from about 25,000 units at the end of last year.\n\nCredit the Escalade sport-utility and Escalade EXT sport-ute/truck as well as the CTS sedan for helping Cadillac gain sales momentum. Escalade sales are up 36 percent for the year, and CTS sales are up 134 percent from last year when Cadillac was selling its predecessor, the Catera.\n\nAfter years of promises that it was going to revamp its lineup, Caddy has delivered with Escalade and CTS attracting some folks into showrooms for the first time and old folks back after a lengthy absence.\n\nThe snub by the old folks is one reason–all the added competition the other–that Caddy is on the outside looking in when it comes to dominance in the luxury segment.\n\nEscalade and CTS will be followed by a host of new vehicles–the Escalade ESV, a larger SUV, early next year as a 2003 derived from the Chevrolet Suburban (the current Escalade is derived from the smaller Chevy Tahoe); the SRX, a so-called sport-activity vehicle crossover; and the XLR roadster for ’04; the next-generation Seville sedan for ’05; and the next-generation DeVille for ’06.\n\nUnfortunately, DeVille, the last of the remakes, is the volume leader. Caddy loyalists, not to mention Caddy insiders, are frustrated by having to wait for the flagship to get with the program.\n\nBut with Escalade and CTS here and SRX and XLR coming soon, it’s not that Cadillac will be without toys to attract folks into showrooms–and most of those folks are expected to be younger than traditional DeVille owners awaiting the ’06 transformation. The average DeVille buyer is 64 and 60 for DTS.\n\nIt’s not that Cadillac lacks innovative technology, it’s that it lacks innovative and fashionable styling, a problem Escalade and CTS have addressed and SRX and XLR will.\n\nWe tested the ’02 DeVille in DTS version, which was all new for the 2000 model year. The luxury sedan is a showcase for technology.\n\nThe 4.6-liter, 300-horsepower Northstar V-8 engine is smooth yet powerful. The mileage rating is 18 m.p.g. city/27 m.p.g. highway. GM plans to offer displacement-on-demand technology in V-8 engines that would shut off 4 cylinders at cruising when not needed to conserve fuel.\n\nWhile it would help a vehicle the size of a DTS, it first will be offered in full-size trucks that need it most beginning in the 2005 model year (Cars, July 4) and then spread to full-size SUVs before reaching full-size sedans.\n\nBut we digress. Northstar comes with a starter-disengage fe ature. If you mistakenly turn the key while idling, the starter disengages to prevent that embarrassing metallic screech that brings neighbors out on the porch to giggle at the offender.\n\nContinuously variable road-sensing suspension smoothes ride and complements handling by adjusting the suspension to compensate for flaws in the pavement under your 17-inch, all-season, radial tires.\n\nThere’s StabiliTrak along with all-speed traction control to prevent slip, slide or skid by sensing oversteer or understeer or unnecessary lateral movement to keep you pointed in the right direction.\n\nYou feel weight in the wheel, but at all times you feel in control of it and don’t sense it as unruly bulk. Smooth, quiet, comfortable, just not the most fashionable looking machine on the road–at least not as sit-up-and-take-notice appealing as the CTS. Have to wait for ’06.\n\nAnd there’s four-wheel anti-lock brakes, dual front and side air bags, rain-sensing wipers teamed with per-activated headlamps and power/heated outside mirrors.\n\nIn case there still is a problem, you get the OnStar emergency communication system, which can perform a variety of functions, from pinpointing where you are via global positioning satellite and sending help, to unlocking your doors if you accidentally leave the keys inside.\n\nThe system also automatically summons medical help if a front or side air bag deploys. Starting in 2004, GM expands that service to summon help when struck front, side, or in the rear–whether a bag deploys or not. It also will alert 911 and give it data on the speed of impact and where your vehicle was struck so emergency personnel can determine the extent of possible injuries to help rescuers plan for treatment. OnStar has a monthly subscription fee of $16.95.\n\nIn addition, the DTS comes with such comfort features as 10-way power seats with power massaging lumbar control, heated front and rear seats, climate control, AM/FM with cassette and CD player and power-activated everything.\n\nBase price: $47,780.\n\nThe test car also came with a comfort/convenience package for $1,985 that adds rear side air bags and ultrasonic rear parking assist that beeps to warn you of an object behind when backing up or parking.\n\nAnd it came with Night Vision at $2,250, the infrared heat-imaging system that shows images of objects in the road ahead–vehicles, humans or animals, anything that gives off heat–along the lower windshield in front of the driver regardless of darkness or foul weather.\n\n(Ford is developing a Night Vision system that shows objects in color while GM’s shows them in white on black like picture negatives. But while GM shows those images on a large area low on the windshield glass so you don’t have to take your eyes off the road, Ford shows them in a small area on a screen in the instrument panel, which requires you to move your eyes.)\n\nCaddy has spoiled owners with a high-tech security blanket. When road-sensing suspension, StabiliTrak and traction control function as designed to keep the motorist out of trouble, the driver is unaware they are working and is led to believe that he or she is an alert, focused motorist with above-average skills.\n\nBut despite all those sophisticated goodies, what system caught our fancy? The new XM satellite radio system that offers 100 channels of coast-to-coast digital sound.\n\nIt was nice to travel 330 miles without radio static or commercial interruption while alternating between nonstop ’60s music/comedy.\n\nWe cheated a couple of times and pushed the button to slip up into the ’70s, ’80s and ’90s stations, but as the decades went up, words switched to wailing and it was back to the Beach Boys and Cosby.\n\nXM runs $295, plus a $9.99 monthly fee. Only drawback is that like satellite TV, there’s more quantity than quality and of the 100 stations offered, about 90 have no appeal.\n\nXM is offered on t he DeVille and Seville for ’02 and on all Cadillacs for ’03.",

      "expert_review": "For a modest extra charge, you can get one with a live-in chauffeur; so don’t expect the Cadillac DeVille to be a great deal of fun to drive. In fact, the rear compartment is probably the best place to be.\n\nWhat the DeVille is about is luxurious transportation for four adults, luxurious being defined as a high-quality environment and considerable riding comfort. Judged by that measure, it stacks up quite well. And considering how prices of equivalent Japanese and European full-size luxury sedans have gone through the roof, the Caddy starts to look like a bargain, even though it’s the price of a pair of nice midsize sedans.\n\nThere are three series of DeVille. The base DeVille is $44,345, freight included; the higher-trim DHS, $48,995, and the DTS, also $48,995.\n\nThe DTS is the touring sedan version, for those who desire something just a quantum more sporty than the stock DeVille. That’s what we’re riding in this week. Slide in through the wide portal; ease down on the soft leather, and relax.\n\nMechanically, the DTS only differs in small ways from the more fogey-ish series. It has electronically-adjustable shocks, bigger wheels, a more aggressive final drive ratio and a more powerful engine, sort of.\n\nActually, GM is doing a little smoke-and-mirrors stuff with the engine specs. In either case it’s the justly-renowned 4.6-liter Northstar V-8, double-overhead-cam, 32 valves, aluminum head and block.\n\nIn standard tune, it delivers 275 hp at 5,600 rpm and 300 foot-pounds of torque at 4,000. In the DTS, it’s rated at 300 hp – this time at 6,000 rpm – and 295 foot-pounds of torque at 4,400.\n\nIn essence what they’ve done is bump the horsepower to a nice round number for the marketing gals, giving away some torque in the process. All things being equal, this should result in inferior acceleration and responsiveness in the 0-70 realm to which we’re legally confined. That’s where the different final drive ratio comes in. By raising it from 3.11:1 to 3.71:1 – a hefty jump as these things go, and effected without any change in intermediate gear ratios – they’ve made sure the engine will turn faster at every road speed, compared with its sibs. It thus will perform at least as their equal (and will burn more gasoline, too, in real life, though the EPA ratings are the same).\n\nWhichever engine you choose, you’ll be pleased to the extent of 20 cents a gallon to find the Northstar thrives on 87-octane fuel, a good trick for such a high-tech powerplant. EPA mileage ratings are 18 mpg city, 27 highway. I logged 22.7, with a mix for fast freeway driving and lots of country cruising.\n\nAt a curb weight of just over two tons, the DTS is relatively svelte, considering the weight of luxury-oriented midsize sedans. The Mercedes-Benz S-Class, with which Cadillac somewhat implausibly compares the DTS, weighs a bit more and has fewer horses in its base trim. The other point of comparison, the Lexus LS430, weighs a little less than DTS, has almost as much horsepower and more torque. From the outside, the DTS has that familiar Caddy look, although it has been buffed and smoothed for the new millennium. Restrained or bland, depending on your point of view, it offers nothing to love or hate.\n\nThe inside, however, is a place you might not be just willing, but rather prone to spend extended stretches. The leather and wood trim are elegant and not overdone. Amenities include 10-way power seats for both driver and co-pilot that incorporate not only heaters (separate for seat and backrest), but also adjustable lumbar support with massaging action. The driver in particular will appreciate this coddling, because the seats per se are not supportive enough for the long haul.\n\nTwo intrepid test subjects tried the rear compartment and didn’t want to leave. There’s enough room for the lanky to luxuriate and leave the driving to Jeeves.\n\nWith independent suspension front and rear, as well as road-sensing shock and hefty coil springs, the DTS strikes a nice balance between handling and comfort, certainly biased to the comfort end of the spectrum. Which is not to say the handling isn’t pretty good for a car of this type. It gives away a modicum of on-the-edge response by being front-wheel drive, unlike the named competitors. But the presumed upscale, mature folks heading for the lodge or country club will likely appreciate the interior room (115 cubic feet) and big trunk (19 c.f.) more than a theoretical ability to pull Gs.\n\nIn the spirit of scientific enquiry, I tossed the big boy around rather more vigorously than any passengers would tolerate and it behaved itself quite well. Some credit must go to the all-speed traction control and GM’s StabiliTrak system. The latter reins in the G-happy by applying braking force to the appropriate wheel when what the driver asks is more than the car has to give, considering the instantaneous coefficient of friction. I found it quite subtle, and, imagining myself a chauffeur for some swell the target of a kidnap attempt, was surprised at how well the DTS went along with the game.\n\nThe test car was fitted with a $2,250 night vision system. This is basically an infrared sensor, similar to those the military and police use, for discerning heat sources (including errant animals and people) at night. The sensor in the center of grille picks up heat signals and relays them to a projector which displays a black-and-white “head-up” window in front of the driver, just above the base of the windshield.\n\nIt’s cute and fun to fiddle with for a while, but in my opinion, nearly worthless. The picture is low-resolution and, in the one tested, of low sensitivity, too. What’s the value of looking at an electronic display of oncoming headlamps? I’d rather have xenon headlamps. Which unfortunately are not offered – definitely a demerit in this class.\n\nThe far more useful “premium luxury package” gets you things like rear side air bags, and automatically-dimming outside rearview mirror and power tilt and telescope steering wheel. The piece de resistance is the sonar rear parking assist, which starts beeping a few feet from a relatively solid object and increases in frequency as you near the danger. Diodes mounted inside and above the rear window augment the audible warning. On a car that stretches 207 inches, that’s very useful.\n\nOther nifty features include real-time monitoring of each tire’s pressure, an XM satellite receiver and large, diode-driven turn signals in the outside rearview mirrors. The stop lights also use diodes instead of conventional incandescent bulbs, because they respond more quickly and are unlikely to ever burn out.\n\nI had fun watching the tire pressures climb by a couple of pounds as the tires heated on a extended freeway run. More importantly an alarm is triggered if pressures are too low.\n\nGM has embr aced the XM satellite radio service – there’s only one competitor, Sirius. Both require a special antenna, a digital receiver and a subscription. The sound quality – through the standard Bose 8-speaker stereo – is excellent and the programming quite diverse, from Latin music through hip-hop, Discovery Channel to CNN. The big sell is that all 100 channels are received from coast to coast. I must say, the comedy channel (R-rated, by the way) made traffic jams infinitely more endurable.\n\nThe DTS and its stablemates have disc brakes front and rear. Stopping distances were quite good, considering the mass, and the stoppers were easily modulated with good pedal feedback. In the government’s crash tests, the front-impact results are listed as “under review”, which probably means GM’s lawyers raised a stink. The side-impact tests got the DeVille a four-star rating (out of five) for protection of front and rear occupants.\n\nThe insurance industry bashers have not had their way with eVille. With its mass and front and side air bags, it certainly should offer a decent level of protection, but I’d like to see side-curtain air bags, too, in this price range.\n\nIn addition to the luxury and night vision add-ons I mentioned, the test car also was graced with a power moonroof ($1,550), 17-inch chrome wheels ($795), 6-disc CD changer ($595), integrated cell phone kit ($325) and the XM rig ($325). Total suggested price, with freight: $56,745. Sure is easy to tack on eight grand, isn’t it? Good news: Edmunds.com surveys show most buyers are wangling about $3,000 off.",

It’s about your daddy’s Caddy, the DeVille Concours.\n\nThis is a real Cadillac, tipping the scales at slightly more than 4,000 pounds, a tad more than 209 inches long and reveling in the big-barge glory that is Cadillac. All the cues are there, from the subtle deck-lid ridges that echo the glories of Cadillac’s fins, the big chrome-y, egg-crate grille up front.\n\nThis car is as big and confident as they come.\n\nAlthough not as large as the leviathans of the past, this one still would be considered large by most standards. Large and A-mer-i-can.\n\nThen you climb inside. This is one American with an identity crisis. The interior is beautiful, but it’s clearly Lexus-derived.\n\nSomeone call in a shrink, quick!\n\nIt doesn’t mean this is not a good car. Quite the contrary, this is an excellent car. Snicker if you will, but this DeVille is quick, confident and well-built. And it’s seen some changes for 1997.\n\nStyling is refined. The hood is resculpted, the restyled grille and headlamps are better integrated into a new front end. Out back, the rear wheels are no longer covered, and the tires are pulled out further toward the edge of the body for a more modern look.\n\nThere are actually three series of DeVilles. There’s the base DeVille, meant mostly as a value leader and for those who desire a bench seat. If you need your DeVille encrusted with gold (and probably would love to see shag carpet come back into style) plop out the extra dough for a DeVille d’Elegance.\n\nBut there’s really only one DeVille to consider: the Concours.\n\nStart under the hood. Your dad always liked a car with lots of guts. He’d love Cadillac’s Northstar engine. The Concours gets the most powerful version of this double-overhead-cam 4.6-liter V8. With300 horsepower and 295 foot-pounds of torque, this is one strong power plant. With a factory quoted 0-60 time of 7.5 seconds, its strength is quite sufficient. (So is its gas mileage of 15 mpg on premium unleaded only). But there’s more to the engine than just brute force. It delivers the juice with a silky, strong feel that’s world class.\n\nEven Mercedes-Benz admits this is one of the most sophisticated engines in the world. In the event of coolant loss, there’s a limp-home mode, in which the engine runs on four cylinders at speeds of up to 50 mph for about 50 miles without damaging the engine. This is accomplished because the engine runs alternatively on four of its eight cylinders. The other four deliver air, not fuel, to the engine, helping to keep it cool. In addition, the tune-up interval is 100,000 miles.\n\nThis engine is integrated into Cadillac’s Integrated Chassis Control System. The system integrates the car’s engine, anti-lock brakes, traction control, ste ering and suspension systems. Under all conditions, the car reads the road surface and yaw rate, then compares that to the driver’s input of steering, acceleration or braking. It will then apply the brakes or take other measures to ensure vehicle stability.\n\nThe result of all this Star Wars-like wizardry is a car quite adept at delivering its occupants swiftly. While it’s too big to carve corners with a BMW, it is a lot more fun than the Caddys of yore. This is so even though, despite all the gimmickry, the suspension delivers some mild float at times. Even with the added athleticism, it still favors ride quality.\n\nBut this is the Cadillac tradition. It doesn’t bound and dip like a parade float. And despite being a front-drive car, torque steer on hard take-offs is well-controlled.\n\nMeanwhile, the interior sees revision, with a new dash and console that mimic those of the Eldorado and Seville, which mimic the Lexus. That means front buckets and a console. The eig t-way power leather seats were comfy and rich. The high-gloss wood accents the interior in current luxo-car fashion. This is an ideal cocoon in which to watch the miles pass. But it will only hold five people. (Your dad might object — he sometimes needs to transport six people.) The ergonomics are excellent, with controls that are easy to understand and operate.\n\nThe car comes with all the obligatory luxury conveniences that cars like this come with. One really worth noting is the OnStar system. Basically, this a voice-activated cellular phone hooked to a satellite navigation system. Hit a toggle paddle at the side of the steering wheel and tell the phone the number you wish to dial. You also can call the OnStar center, which can pinpoint your location within a few hundred feet. If you’re lost, center personnel can give you directions. If you need to find a decent restaurant in a strange city, they can oblige. They can even unlock your car if you accidentally lock your keys in it. This didn’t fail to impress even the most jaded journalist on the staff. Neat stuff.\n\nAt an as-tested price of $45,372, there was little to fault. This car not only brims with technology, it also keeps its sense of tradition intact, something that can’t be said of the new small Cadillac, the Catera.\n\nBut reinventing any Caddy in the image of Lexus makes the Caddy a second-rate Lexus rather than a first-rate Cadillac. The technological innovation of this car is more impressive than its artistic mimicking. But it deserves a look from anyone looking in this price range — you or your father.\n\n1997 Cadillac DeVille Concours Base price: $41,995 As tested: $45,372 Major options: Heated front seats, chrome wheel covers, audio system upgrade, safety/security package.

      "expert_review": "At the turn of the century, Cadillac released one of the classic advertisements of all time, “The Penalty Of Leadership.” \n “If the leader truly leads, he remains the leader” says the copy. \n The ad never mentioned the car Cadillac         produced, rather it talked about leadership, something Cadillac has done for several decades, until this year. \n In 1998, Lincoln surpassed Cadillac in sales for the first time. For 1999, Lexus is number one in the luxury field with Cadillac third and  Lincoln fourth. \n Why is this? Take a look at the DeVille. \n Actually, you know the shape by now. It’s the same shape Caddy has been selling at least for three decades. If you don’t think that’s a long time, imagine selling the same basic styling of the 1929 Cadillac in 1959. While it may be acceptable to Cadillac’s traditional clients, it fails to attract younger ones. This will be solved hopefully this fall when a new DeVille arrives. \n But, while the styling has all the appeal of an effete      lemur, what it hides is a world class drivetrain and a terrific car. It’s like finding Claudia Schiffer hiding in the guise of Jessica Tandy or Tom Cruise hiding in the body of Buddy Ebsen. \n Start Cadillac’s truly great Northstar engine. This          double-overhead-cam 32-valve V-8 is world class, pumping out 275 horsepower in Base and D’Elegance DeVilles and 300 horsepower in the sportier DeVille Concours. Smooth and fast, this engine moves the Deville with the might of the Spanish Inquisition. \n That Cadillac feeds it all of the power through the front wheels means that occasionally there is a tug of torque steer on hard launches, but it’s well-controlled overall. \n Hooked to a typically smooth-shifting four-speed automatic, this Caddy lacks   nothing in the power department. Certainly it leaves its chief competitor, the Lincoln Town Car, in the dust. \n It also requires no tune-ups for 100,000 miles, with engine coolant that can last as long as 150,000 miles. \n Should a coolant leak       develop, the engine can run for 50 miles in a limp-home mode without damaging the engine. An oil monitoring unit measures oil life. No more guessing when to change it. \n More importantly is the chassis-control setup Cadillac uses. It starts with        computer controlled shock absorbers, which shifts the settings of the shock absorbers depending on what sensors tell the computer about the speed of the vehicle and the position of the wheels in relation to the body. In addition, Stabilitrak, an option on the base and mid-level Caddies and standard on the Concours, measures yaw and lateral acceleration and then compares the input from the driver against what the car is doing. It then stabilizes the car to ensure the driver’s wishes are met. \n It’s all   tied into the engine. The result is a drivetrain that’s as sophisticated as any in the world. It allows the car an amazing amount of stability, even over the most rippled road surfaces. \n Of course, it can’t overcome everything. You migh                t find the tail twitchy while going through bumpy corners. But the fact that you can sling this big boy around at all with any gusto might surprise most people. \n So too will the interior. \n To those of us who grew up knowing only the garish,        chrome-encrusted interiors of 70s-era Caddys, the Lexus-inspired interiors that Cadillac has been using for the past few years is a refreshing change. It speaks in the current luxury idiom in a way the exterior does not. \n The base DeVille and          mid-level D’Elegance come with a bench seat. The Concours has front buckets with a console. The seats are wide and flat, meant more for gentle cruising than fast cornering. \n The rear seat is amazingly comfortable and roomy, with two illuminated visor  vanity mirrors and lots of stretch-out space. \n But the special option that will surprise everyone is Cadillac’s massaging seat. This is an option in the best Cadillac tradition, like the Twilight Sentinel. Tapping on the lumbar support button startst                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  he massaging feature. The lumbar in the seat rolls up and down for 10 minutes. Being a total hedonist, I couldn’t resist trying it. The feel is like the seat is breathing. Whether other automakers will pick up this feature is anyone’s guess. \n The      audio system, like so many other parts of the car, is also sophisticated. The radio features a radio data system or RDS. It allows the radio to receive data transmitted from a radio station, such as call letters and format. It can include other data such  as stock quotes or traffic information. Few stations in the area use the technology, but Cadillac was the first domestic automaker to use it. \n It’s clear that Cadillac is trying to become a technological force to be reckoned with and that it has the   ability to do this isn’t in doubt. \n A drive in the DeVille Concours will prove that. But Cadillac has to outpace everyone, like it once did. \n Their own ad tells the story. “That which is good or great makes itself known, no matter how loud the     clamor of denial.” But image is harder to change. \n Styling will be taken care of, certainly the technology is. But Cadillac has to change the little things that turn off younger buyers such as the tacky gold keys or hokey model names like the          D’Elegance. \n For under the same old thing is a great car, hiding in outdated styling sized XXL. If the styling doesn’t bother you, try this traditional slice of large American luxury car — a surprisingly adept large car that coddles in the best Caddy tradition. \n1999 Cadillac DeVille Concourts \nEngine 4.6-liter DOHC 32-valve Northstar V-8 Transmission: 4-speed automatic Standard: Speed-sentive power steering, Stabilitrak Chassis System, anti-lock 4-wheel disc brakes, traction control, aluminum   wheels, keyless entry, security system, wood trim, automatic windshield wipers, Twilight Sentinel, auto-dimming rear-view mirror with compass, dual zone automatic climate control, 11-speaker AM/FM/Cassette/CD, memory drivers settings.
