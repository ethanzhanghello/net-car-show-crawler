      "expert_review": "Even Cadillac is amazed by the booming success of its Escalade sport utility vehicle, a newly minted pop icon that has bullied its way into the consciousness of a new generation of Cadillac aspirants.\n\n“The success is greater than any number we had for it,” said Mark LaNeve, Cadillac’s 44-year-old general manager. “Just the way it has shown up in pop culture, like MTV videos.”\n\nLaNeve called Escalade “the turning point for Cadillac,” when the venerable General Motors luxury division went from stodgy to hip overnight. There’s a note of humility in that statement: that Escalade just happened to be in the right place at the right time with the right stuff.\n\n“It became the cool car,” LaNeve said in wonderment. “And everyone knows you can’t control cool.”\n\nFor 2003, Escalade ESV is the latest in a trio of Caddy trucks. Twenty-two inches longer than the standard Escalade, it becomes a looming presence that rules the strange world of luxury SUVs.\n\nHere is today’s version of the classic land yacht, once exemplified by the sleek 1959 Cadillac with its record-setting tail fins. The Escalade may be big and boxy, but the spirit is still there.\n\nOpulent, excessive and wasteful are words that could describe the ESV. But so does the word “cool.”\n\nWhat it is:\n\nThe third member of the Escalade family, which includes the regular Escalade and the Escalade EXT crew-cab pickup truck. The ESV adds a third row of adult-size seating and prodigious cargo capacity to the formula. Basically an upscale version of the Chevrolet Suburban, it’s the largest full-size luxury sport utility vehicle on the market.\n\nEngine and transmission:\n\nA 6-liter, 345-horsepower V-8 is plenty of motivation for the ESV. This is the same engine as that in the performance-laden Silverado SS pickup truck, and it provides the Escalade with plenty of gutsy power.\n\nDespite its massive heft, the ESV moves out quickly, accelerating to highway speed with a roaring rush. The heavy-duty automatic shifts smoothly, and it’s eager to kick down a gear under throttle for immediate response.\n\nTowing capacity is rated at a beefy 7,400 pounds.\n\nOf course, all that weight and power comes at a price. The EPA rates the biggest Escalade at 12 miles per gallon city and 16 mpg highway, though that seems optimistic. I spent a lot of time pumping gas into this behemoth.\n\nHandling and drivability:\n\nIt’s really amazing how well the ESV drives, considering its size and weight. It handles corners as nicely as many automobiles with little sense of top-heaviness or body sway. It also maneuvers well in urban driving with good steering response and excellent braking.\n\nThe steering feels too light, however, especially at midrange speeds around 40 mph. Here it’s numb and twitchy with too much of a vague feel when traveling in a straight line. On the freeway, it firms up nicely.\n\nElectronic enhancements include all-wheel-drive; Stabilitrac, which helps prevent skids; traction control, which prevents wheel spin; Road Sensing Suspension, which continuously adjusts the shock absorbers for road conditions; and Ultrasonic Rear Parking Assist, which warns if you’re about to back into something.\n\nStyling:\n\nFor me, the beauty of the Escalade is purely in the eye of the beholder. Plenty of people love this image, which speaks of affluence and hip urban culture. There are lots of appreciative stares, especially from young people.\n\nI found the ESV to look overly formal, too big and not really appealing. In glossy black, it felt more like a vehicle for Secret Service agents to use while protecting the president than a showy ride for a night on the town.\n\nThe looming presence of the test truck was tempered with chrome trim and gleaming chrome wheels, and Cadillac’s broad, signature grille. Caddy designers have hit on a style that people recognize and appreciate, and there is no mistaking this truck for anything but part of the Escalade clan.\n\nInterior:\n\nDespite lovely and comfortable leather seating and a plethora of electronic features, the interior treatment is a weak point in the package. The console feels cheap with fake-wood plastic covers on cup holders and a stowage bin.\n\nAn attractive Bulgari analog clock is set into the console but too low and off-center. It should be a focal point.\n\nSeven people fit comfortably in here. The third row does require a climb to access.\n\nThe middle row folds flat, but the third row must be removed to create a broad loading area. Although the seat is easy to detach, it is heavy and cumbersome.\n\nThe test truck was loaded with goodies, including XM satellite radio and a DVD video system.\n\nPricing:\n\nNaturally, Escalade comes fully loaded for its steep baseline price of $57,975. The test vehicle included the DVD system, $1,295; 17-inch chrome wheels, $795; XM radio, $325 (subscription fee is extra); trailer package, $190; and shipping, $790. Total is an exclusive $58,765.\n\nBottom line:\n\nBig and bold, the most massive fashion statement on wheels, the Escalade ESV should help continue Cadillac’s reign in this diverse upscale SUV segment.\n\nCadillac Escalade ESV\n\nVehicle type: Seven-passenger, four-door sport utility vehicle, all-wheel drive.\n\nBase price: $55,370.\n\nPrice as tested: $58,765.\n\nEngine: 6-liter V-8, 345 horsepower at 5,200 rpm, 380 pound-feet of torque at 4,000 rpm.\n\nTransmission: Four-speed automatic.\n\nWheelbase: 130 inches.\n\nCurb weight: 5,839 pounds.\n\nTowing capacity: 7,400 pounds.\n\nEPA mileage: 12 city, 16 highway.\n\nHighs:\n\nRoomy capability.\n\nPower, handling.\n\nThe essence of cool.\n\nLows:\n\nInterior trim issues.\n\nSteering vagueness.\n\nMighty thirst for fuel.",

      "expert_review": "Answers to common questions heard while driving a 2007 Cadillac Escalade ESV:\n\nNo, it does not have its own ZIP code.\n\nNo, you can’t actually see the fuel gauge go down when you stomp on the accelerator. Almost, maybe, but no.\n\nYes, you do feel a little like breaking into a rap song while driving it.\n\nYes, I feel a bit guilty, but that’s true with everything. Woody Allen has less guilt than I do.\n\nI really have no idea how many cows died to upholster all these seats.\n\nIt weighs almost three tons.\n\n403 horsepower.\n\n13 miles per gallon in the city, 19 on the highway. Yes, I know that is just the EPA estimate. Yes, I know that “my mileage may differ.” It does, in fact.\n\nThe gas tank holds 31 gallons. At $2.60 a gallon, that would be $80 to fill it up.\n\nYes, I am rich. Quite rich. Now go away.\n\nIndeed, there is a very long list of problems with the 2007 Cadillac Escalade ESV; however, none concern the vehicle itself. It is, in fact, pretty excellent. It might be, in fact, the best big SUV built. Certainly I can’t think of one I would prefer over the Escalade ESV.\n\nBut you might find yourself justifying the ESV, especially if your seat is the only one of the eight that is occupied, and you aren’t towing a horse trailer, and you aren’t carrying groceries to the nearest food bank.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency’s Web site, fueleconomy.gov, breaks it down for you. The Escalade ESV’s “energy score” is 22.8, representing how many barrels of oil per year the average driver will use. The Toyota Prius’ energy score is 6.2 barrels. Apparently, this is like golf: Low score wins. Luckily, I don’t play golf.\n\nThe ESV is the largest of the three Escalade models. The EXT is the one with the little pickup bed, like the Chevrolet Avalanche. The regular Escalade is like the Chevrolet Tahoe and GMC Yukon. And the ESV is 21 inches longer than the regular Escalade, about the size of a Chevrolet Suburban, upon which the ESV is based. This means that you have three usable rows of seats and still have 45.8 cubic feet of storage space in the back, with all seats occupied.\n\nTo the driver, the ESV feels smaller than it is, and I mean that as a compliment. Handling is surprisingly good, though enter a tight corner quickly, and there’s no way to mask the inertia. The engine is just superb, and the six-speed automatic transmission could not be much better. No one, I mean no one, is building a better truck powertrain.\n\nInside, there’s luxury, without being tacky or ostentatious. DVD players, a navigation system, lots of air bags and electronic safety features — if General Motors makes it, it is probably here.\n\nAnd the price reflects it, though it’s pretty close to the competition. Base price on the all-wheel-drive ESV is $59,470, and the test model lists for $69,675. You can save money if, say, you don’t want heated and cooled seats, but who doesn’t?\n\nI do. And that’s the last question I’m answering.",

      "expert_review": "I’m a bit skeptical about driving the Cadillac Escalade ESV Platinum Edition. For one thing, it’s really huge, both in size and in price. Heck, for $70,000, I could almost buy a little condo. Does anyone really need to spend this much money on a gas guzzler that barely fits in an average parking space?\n\nAfter driving it for a week I can say with some certainty that I now see the appeal. I can drive this car to the PTA, or fit right into a rap video. You can’t say that about a station wagon.\n\nInstalling my children’s child safety seats gives me my first positive impression of the 2005 Escalade ESV. The Latch connectors in the two bucket seats are visible and easy to use. For my 5-year-old who’s in a booster seat, the seatbelt is easy for her to use on her own. For larger children just outside of booster seat age, the Escalade ESV features seatbelt positioners to help keep the belt from crossing on their neck.\n\nHowever, I feel great pity for the mom of an infant who has to heft that honking big infant carrier up into this car. She better find a great chiropractor.\n\nThe third row seats three more people and even adults will fit. However, the center seat only has a lap belt which is not the safest option for child travelers. Thanks to separate DVD screens for the “back” and the “way back,” everyone gets a great view of the movie. Side note: My daughter told me to write in my review that she can’t watch a movie and drink a smoothie at the same time because the headphones keep slipping off, so she has to hold them on -taking her hands away from her drink.\n\nOn the downside, this vehicle does not feature curtain side airbags, leaving rear passengers in a potentially precarious position should the car roll. For $70k you’d think GM could throw those in -when in reality they should be standard for all vehicles, despite the car’s price.\n\nCargo space in the Escalade ESV is amazing. As a matter of fact, I could probably install a little restroom and a kitchenette back here. That’d be great for me with my youngest just out of diapers who wants nothing more than to eat oatmeal five times a day.\n\nI like this vehicle more from the standpoint of a passenger than a driver. Its large size feels overwhelming to me. However, I am impressed with the great visibility from the driver’s seat, that is, with the exception of the blind spot on the left side of the vehicle. Turning my head around to peak at the blind spot yields a really great view of … the driver’s seat head restraint. Of course, my husband, who’s an entire foot taller than me, doesn’t have this same complaint.\n\nThe 2005 version of this Cadillac Escalade ESV Platinum Edition features an “all-new cooling system with [a] more powerful 160-amp alternator.” I don’t know what that is, but the AC in this car is amazing! Within a matter of seconds the car cools down to goose-bump level, despite 100 plus degree temperatures.\n\nChilled seats blow cold air up my -well, you get the idea. This is my greatest summer pleasure. Chilled seats, just imagine! Wait, it gets even better than that: The cupholders in front can be electronically cooled or heated, depending on your beverage of choice (watch for curious little hands around these when heated).\n\nFor all the little (and not so little) extras, this luxury SUV earns its high price tag. For those of you who still think that size equals safety, I’m sorry to be the one to break it to you: That’s not always the case.\n\n*For more information on the Cadillac Escalade ESV and its safety features visit Cars.com.\n\nLET’S TALK NUMBERS\n\nLATCH Connectors: 2\n\nSeating Capacity (includes driver): 7\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\n\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nCadillac expanded its sport utility vehicle lineup to three models when it added the full-size Escalade ESV during the 2003 model year. Not only is this the largest luxury SUV on the market, but it’s also the biggest Cadillac ever produced. Measuring 22 inches longer than the regular Escalade, the ESV provides more than 20 additional inches of interior length.\n\nFor 2005, a premium instrument cluster featured bright chrome trim, and burled walnut was added to the interior. Nothing has changed for the 2006 model year.\n\nThe Escalade ESV competes against such vehicles as the Land Rover Range Rover, Lexus LX 470 and Lincoln Navigator, but the ESV’s dimensions set it apart.\n\nIn addition to a 345-horsepower V-8, the Escalade ESV has full-time all-wheel drive and General Motors’ StabiliTrak electronic stability system. Technical features include a Road Sensing Suspension System and Ultrasonic Rear Parking Assist. XM Satellite Radio, a trailering package and a tire-pressure monitor are standard.\n\nJoining the lineup in 2004 was an ESV Platinum Edition equipped with 20-inch chrome-plated aluminum wheels and a premium interior that included an ebony and shale dashboard, shale leather seating surfaces and pleated door panel bolsters. The 2006 Platinum Edition also includes a dual-screen DVD rear entertainment system that has a screen for the second row and another for the third row.\n\nExterior\nCadillac notes that the ESV “shares the same bold exterior design and commanding road presence” as the regular Escalade. High-intensity-discharge headlights flank an eggcrate grille. The front fascia incorporates recessed tow hooks and rectangular fog lamps.\n\nChrome badging features the Cadillac wreath-and-crest insignia. Signature seven-spoke chrome-plated aluminum wheels hold 17-inch tires. Power folding and heated mirrors include turn-signal indicators. A functional step bumper at the rear shrouds a trailer hitch. Built on a 130-inch wheelbase, the ESV measures 221.4 inches long overall, stands 75.7 inches tall and has a ground clearance of 10.7 inches.\n\nInterior\nDepending on the ESV’s seating configuration, either seven or eight people can luxuriate on soft, aromatic Nuance leather seating surfaces. The front bucket seats have 14-way power adjustment, power-adjustable side bolsters, power lumbar and seatback recliner controls, and independently heated seatbacks and cushions. Second-row bucket seats have heated cushions, and customers can choose a bench seat for this row. The third-row bench seat folds down and can be removed to increase cargo capacity. Front- and second-row seats are heated and cooled in the Platinum Edition, which also features burled walnut accents and embroidered floormats.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Escalade ESV’s 6.0-liter V-8 generates 345 hp and 380 pounds-feet of torque; it teams with a four-speed-automatic transmission. Full-time all-wheel drive is standard.\n\nSafety\nDual-stage front airbags, a passenger-sensing system and side-impact airbags for the front seats are installed.\n\nDriving Impressions\nDespite the ESV’s massive dimensions, engine response is quite vigorous and the automatic transmission is well-behaved. The suspension is on the soft side, but the ESV handles with a reasonable degree of confidence. Visibility is terrific because of the massive glass area. The second-row seats are especially comfortable and grant ready access to the back row.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nCadillac’s Escalade ESV offers more room for those who find the Escalade, a full-size SUV, just a bit too small. Its wheelbase is 14 inches longer than the full-size Escalade, and its total length exceeds the standard model by more than 20 inches. Third-row occupants benefit from increased legroom, and cargo capacity behind them nearly triples. The model was redesigned for 2007, so changes for 2008 are minimal.\n\nAs with the regular-wheelbase Escalade, the Escalade ESV gets a full complement of luxury equipment, including leather seats for up to eight occupants, plenty of exterior chrome and optional 22-inch wheels. It is now available in two- as well as all-wheel drive.\n\nExterior\nBuilt on the same platform as the Chevrolet Suburban and GMC Yukon XL, the Escalade ESV stretches 20.4 inches longer than the regular Escalade. Fourteen of those inches go to extending the wheelbase, which allows for larger rear doors unconstrained by wheel wells. Height increases by 1.2 inches, and width remains about the same. Despite the bigger dimensions, curb weight increases by just 126 pounds.\n\nExterior details are identical to the regular Escalade’s, with jeweled headlights flanking Cadillac’s now-familiar grille up front, and large, rectangular taillights in back. Eighteen-inch wheels are standard; 22-inch wheels are optional.\n\nInterior\nThe ESV’s extended dimensions don’t yield significant gains for first- or second-row occupants, but third-row passengers gain nearly 10 inches of legroom. Cargo volume behind the third row increases from 16.9 cubic feet to 45.8 cubic feet. With the third-row seat removed and the second-row seats folded forward, maximum cargo volume is 137.4 cubic feet — about 28 cubic feet more than the standard Escalade offers.\n\nIn the Escalade ESV, the optional DVD entertainment system includes a second 8-inch screen for third-row passengers. A leather interior, automatic climate control and power-operated front seats are standard. Total seating capacity is seven, though an optional second-row bench expands capacity to eight.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Escalade ESV uses the same engine as does the regular Escalade: a 6.2-liter V-8 with 403 horsepower and 417 pounds-feet of torque. It works through a six-speed automatic transmission.\n\nTowing capacity increases 100 pounds over the regular Escalade, to a maximum of 7,800 pounds when properly equipped.\n\nSafety\nStandard safety items include four-wheel-disc antilock brakes and an electronic stability system. The system has rollover mitigation technology that senses imminent rollovers and applies individual brakes in an effort to avert the accident.\n\nSide curtain airbags that protect all three rows of seats are standard. Front-seat side-impact airbags are not available.",

      "expert_review": "Escalade ESV Platinum’s luxury eases long haul\n\nOCEAN ISLE BEACH, N.C. – Once, a long time ago, the Cadillac Escalade ESV Platinum sport-utility would have seemed out of place at this family beach resort, a coastal barrier island just a seashell’s toss from the South Carolina border.\n\nThe Ocean Isle of my youth was somewhere between undiscovered and taken for granted. My parents would rent a cottage almost every summer, and my brothers and sister and I would play in the surf all day until we were burned red and exhausted. Then, under the stars, we would go out and watch the sand crabs scurry on the beach.\n\nToday, the Escalade ESV, Cadillac’s version of the super-size Chevy Suburban, and especially the limited-edition (5,000 a year) Platinum Edition version, fit right in at Ocean Isle. Oh, this seven-mile spit of sand hasn’t gone South Beach or Newport Beach yet, but it has become more fully developed and now there’s even a very fancy restaurant that sits adjacent to a gated community.\n\nStill, my extended family — 12 of us including three 1-year-old nieces and nephews — forged our own memories of a weekend at Ocean Isle. And the Escalade ESV got plenty of appreciative nods.\n\nBefore the Hummer H2 and various Bentleys began populating music videos and parking lots for pro athletes, the Escalade was the chariot of choice, the begetter of bling-bling.\n\nAnd make no mistake, the nearly $70,000 Escalade ESV Platinum is the king of bling.\n\nOur smooth-sided test vehicle was painted quicksilver, a light gold-beige color. But its huge 20-inch chrome wheels and tires reflected the noon-time sun and attracted many a glance. The massive chrome grille, coupled with dinner-plate-size Cadillac wreath-and-crest emblem on the vehicle’s front and rear, told the other tourists that we weren’t just driving any old Chevy or GMC SUV.\n\nOcean Isle’s permanent population of 426 swells to around 22,000 during the summer. And the Cadillac SUV’s proportions seem similarly expansive. It’s nearly 18.5 feet long, just over 6.5 feet wide and just under 6.5 feet tall. The vehicle’s ultrasonic rear-parking assist system is much appreciated, as normal parking lot spaces require much negotiation.\n\nIt weighs nearly 6,000 pounds unloaded (5,820 pounds), only gets 13 mpg in city driving (17 mpg on the highway) and the use of premium unleaded fuel is recommended.\n\nBut when a family of four travels more than 1,800 miles — we spent time in another favorite spot, Cades Cove in Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Tennessee, too — with eight bags (we later added a ninth), a cooler, three baseball gloves and more, a vehicle of some size is required.\n\nAnd this one provided transportation at its most luxurious.\n\nOur kids, who have enjoyed rear-seat DVD players on long trips in the past, got a new treat this time — a second seven-inch screen above the third-row seats joinin g the first above the second-row seats. Up front, their mom and I enjoyed the Escalade’s XM satellite radio, which provided great reception even when we were far from the beaten path.\n\nBoth the front- and second-row seats of this seven-seat vehicle had buttons that allowed them to be either heated or cooled. In the hot and humid South, reaching for the seat-chiller button was my first task after switching on the ignition.\n\nTwo of the front cup holders even offered heating and cooling buttons for our drinks, although experiments with both Styrofoam cups of coffee and plastic bottles of water proved the system worked only adequately well.\n\nFrom its wide leather seats and chrome-trimmed gauge faces to its plentiful use of walnut, including on the steering wheel and far up on the dashboard, the Escalade ESV Platinum doesn’t shrink from its country-club aspirations. The vehicle also comes with a DVD-based navigation system, the OnStar safety/concierge system, a B se audio system and even an analog Bulgari clock.\n\nWith the third row down, the Escalade ESV offered spacious cargo room. The vehicle is 22 inches longer than the base Escalade.\n\nOn the road, the all-wheel-drive Escalade ESV with its 345-horsepower, 6.0-liter V-8 engine cruised effortlessly over interstate and back road. The ride was smooth, although the vehicle’s size and weight made for less-than-precise handling.\n\nEven on days when I drove 250 to 300 miles, I never tired of piloting the Escalade ESV and fidgeting with its gadgets.\n\nSure, we once visited Ocean Isle Beach in a battered station wagon. And, these days, a minivan would have offered similar passenger and cargo space at half the price. But for those who can afford it, the Escalade ESV Platinum brings luxury to the forefront, or, in this case, the shore-front.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nCadillac’s Escalade ESV offers more room for those who find the Escalade, a full-size SUV, just a bit too small. Its wheelbase is 14 inches longer than the full-size Escalade, and its total length exceeds the standard model by more than 20 inches. Third-row occupants benefit from increased legroom, and cargo capacity behind them nearly triples. The ESV competes with other extended-body luxury SUVs such as the Lincoln Navigator L and Infiniti QX56.\n\nAs with the regular-wheelbase Escalade, the Escalade ESV gets a full complement of luxury equipment, including leather seats for up to eight occupants, plenty of exterior chrome and optional 22-inch wheels. It is available in two- and all-wheel drive.\n\nNew for 2009\nThe ESV’s 6.2-liter V-8 gains E85 capability.\n\nExterior\nBuilt on the same platform as the Chevrolet Suburban and GMC Yukon XL, the Escalade ESV stretches 20.4 inches longer than the regular Escalade. Fourteen of those inches go to extending the wheelbase, which allows for larger rear doors unconstrained by wheel wells. Height increases by 1.2 inches, and width remains about the same. Despite the bigger dimensions, curb weight increases by just 217 pounds. The wheelbase is 7 inches longer than the QX56’s and 1 inch shorter than the Navigator L’s.\n\nJeweled headlights\nCadillac’s now-familiar grille up front\nRectangular taillights in back\n18-inch wheels standard\n22-inch wheels optional\n\nInterior\nThe ESV’s extended dimensions don’t yield significant gains for first- or second-row occupants, but third-row passengers gain nearly 10 inches of legroom. Cargo volume behind the third row increases from 16.9 cubic feet to 45.8 cubic feet. With the third-row seat removed and the second-row seats folded forward, maximum cargo volume is 137.4 cubic feet — about 28 cubic feet more than the standard Escalade.\n\nOptional DVD entertainment system includes a second 8-inch screen for third-row passengers\nStandard leather interior, automatic climate control, power-operated front seats\nStandard seating capacity is seven; optional second-row bench expands capacity to eight\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Escalade ESV uses the same engine as does the regular Escalade: a 6.2-liter V-8 with 403 horsepower and 417 pounds-feet of torque. It works through a six-speed automatic transmission.\n\n7,800 pounds of towing capacity when properly equipped\n\nSafety\nSafety equipment includes:\n\nStandard four-wheel-disc antilock brakes\nStandard electronic stability system with rollover mitigation technology\nStandard side curtain airbags in all three rows of seats\nNo side-impact airbags",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nGM has been steadily updating its full-size pickup truck and SUV lineup over the past year, and the capstone is its 2015 Cadillac Escalade SUV, the most expensive and luxurious one of all. Offered in regular- and extended-wheelbase ESV form, the redesigned Escalade has a bold new face punctuated by distinctive headlights, a revamped interior with a focus on premium materials, more entertainment and safety technology and a new V-8 drivetrain. Hybrid and EXT pickup truck versions are no longer offered. The SUV hits dealerships in spring 2014.\n\nExterior\nLike its Chevrolet and GMC siblings, the redesigned Escalade has a more angular, chiseled shape than before. There’s a clear connection to the prior SUV in its front-end design, but the look is amplified by a giant three-bar grille and LED headlights with vertical accent lighting. Lighting also plays a role in the SUV’s rear styling, which features tall LED taillights with an illuminated Cadillac wreath-and-crest logo.\n\nThe Escalade has an aluminum hood and liftgate to save weight, but at 5,603 pounds in base form, it isn’t exactly light. The liftgate includes hands-free operation and programmable opening heights. Naturally, 20-inch aluminum wheels are standard with 22-inch rims available.\n\nInterior\nThe all-new interior is reminiscent of the one in Cadillac’s XTS full-size sedan with its focus on premium materials like real wood and integrated technology. The Escalade comes standard with the Cadillac User Experience multimedia system, which consists of an 8-inch touch-screen and touch-sensitive controls. There’s also a 12.3-inch screen in place of traditional analog instrumentation. A full-color head-up display that projects vehicle information at the base of the windshield is available, as is a Blu-ray-compatible rear entertainment system that has one 9-inch screen in the Escalade and two 9-inch screens in the ESV.\n\nThe front bucket seats should be more accommodating as the Escalade gains 4 inches of legroom and nearly 2 inches of extra headroom. Heated and cooling functions for the front seats are standard.\n\nThe extended-wheelbase version of the Escalade provides more headroom and legroom in the second and third rows, with third-row legroom benefiting the most as passengers gain nearly 10 inches extra. Cargo room behind the third row jumps considerably, too, from 15.3 cubic feet to 38.7 cubic feet in the ESV.\n\nThe Escalade now has a fold-flat third-row seat, which makes it easier to go from hauling people to cargo compared to the prior generation’s removable third row, but maximum cargo volume for the regular Escalade (94.2 cubic feet) and ESV (120.5) is about 15 cubic feet less than before.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Escalade’s 6.2-liter V-8 engine has been overhauled and now makes more power at 420 horsepower and torque at 460 pounds-feet. The engine features direct injection, variable valve timing and cylinder deactivation for improved performance and efficiency (official fuel-economy estimates haven’t been released as of this writing). There are also active shutters in front of the radiator that close at highway speeds for better aerodynamics.\n\nRear- and four-wheel-drive models are offered, and power is channeled through a six-speed automatic transmission. Maximum towing capacity is 8,200 pounds for the rear-wheel-drive regular-length Escalade and 8,000 pounds for the four-wheel-drive version.\n\nThe Escalade still uses an independent front suspension and a solid rear axle, but GM’s Magnetic Ride Control adaptive damping system is now standard. Magnetic Ride Control varies suspension firmness by charging iron-particle-infused shock absorber fluid. It also includes two driver-selectable modes: Tour and Sport.\n\nSafety Features\nThough the Escalade’s popularity with thieves has waned a little recently, it’s still a prime target. The 2015 version has a number of technology features designed to make it harder to steal, including an intrusion sensor, inclination sensor and sensors that monitor if a window has been smashed. It also has a stolen vehicle tracking feature through GM’s OnStar emergency communication system.\n\nSafety features designed to protect people inside and outside the SUV include front and rear automatic braking, which issues alerts and can autonomously apply the brakes to avoid a low-speed collision. The Escalade also offers a center-mounted side airbag between the front seats.\n\nAdditional available safety features include forward collision warning, lane departure warning, a safety alert seat that warns the driver by vibrating sections of the cushion, a blind spot warning system and rear cross-traffic alert.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nCadillac’s Escalade ESV offers more room for those who find the Escalade, a full-size SUV, just a bit too small. Its wheelbase is 14 inches longer than the full-size Escalade, and its total length exceeds the standard model by more than 20 inches. Third-row occupants benefit from increased legroom, and cargo capacity behind them nearly triples. With seating for up to eight, the ESV competes with other luxury SUVs such as the Lincoln Navigator L and Lexus LX 570.\n\nAs with the regular-wheelbase Escalade, the Escalade ESV gets a full complement of luxury features, including leather seats, plenty of exterior chrome and optional 22-inch wheels. It’s available with rear- or all-wheel drive.\nNew for 2013\nThere are no significant changes for 2013.\nExterior\nBuilt on the same platform as the Chevrolet Suburban and GMC Yukon XL, the Escalade ESV stretches more than 20 inches longer than the regular Escalade. Fourteen of those inches go to extending the wheelbase, which allows for larger rear doors unconstrained by wheel wells. Despite the bigger dimensions, curb weight increases by just 260 pounds for rear-wheel-drive models. Exterior features include:\n\n\nJeweled headlights\nCadillac’s now-familiar eggcrate grille \nRectangular taillights in back\nEighteen-inch wheels standard\nAvailable Platinum Edition features LED headlamps and unique 22-inch wheels\nPower liftgate standard\n\nInterior\nThe ESV’s extended dimensions don’t yield significant gains for first- or second-row occupants, but third-row passengers gain nearly 10 inches of legroom. Cargo volume behind the third row increases from 16.9 cubic feet to 45.8 cubic feet. With the third-row seat removed and the second row folded forward, maximum cargo volume is 137.4 cubic feet — about 28 cubic feet more than the regular Escalade. Interior features include:\n\n\nOptional DVD entertainment system includes a second 8-inch screen for third-row passengers\nStandard leather interior, automatic climate control and power-operated front seats\nStandard seating capacity is seven; available second-row bench expands capacity to eight\nAvailable Platinum Edition features a heated steering wheel, heated and cooled cupholders, a leather-wrapped interior and a DVD entertainment system with two extra screens integrated in the back of the front head restraints\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Escalade ESV uses the same engine as the regular Escalade: a 6.2-liter V-8 with 403 horsepower and 417 pounds-feet of torque. It works with a six-speed automatic transmission. Cadillac includes standard scheduled oil changes, tire rotations, replacement of engine and cabin air filters and multipoint vehicle inspections for four years or 50,000 miles. Mechanical features include:\n\n\n8,000 pounds (RWD) or 7,700 pounds (AWD) of towing capacity when properly equipped\nOptional Magnetic Ride Control replaces mechanical shock absorbers with electronically controlled shocks that GM says react to the road more quickly \nAvailable full-time all-wheel drive\n\nSafety\nSafety features include:\n\n\nStandard four-wheel-disc antilock brakes\nStandard electronic stability system with rollover-mitigation technology\nStandard side curtain airbags in all three rows of seats\nStandard front-seat side-impact airbags\nOptional blind spot warning system",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nCadillac’s Escalade ESV offers more room for those who find the Escalade, a full-size SUV, just a bit too small. Its wheelbase is 14 inches longer than the full-size Escalade, and its total length exceeds the standard model by more than 20 inches. Third-row occupants benefit from increased legroom, and cargo capacity behind them nearly triples. The ESV competes with other luxury SUVs such as the Lincoln Navigator L and Lexus LX 570. As with the regular-wheelbase Escalade, the Escalade ESV gets a full complement of luxury equipment, including leather seats, plenty of exterior chrome and optional 22-inch wheels. It’s available with rear- or all-wheel drive.\n\nNew for 2010\nThe Cadillac Escalade ESV’s 6.2-liter V-8 now features cylinder deactivation, a technology designed to save gas by automatically shutting off four cylinders when driving conditions allow. The clock from prior Platinum trims is now standard across the lineup, and there are new side-impact airbags for the front seats. There’s a USB port for connecting a portable music player to the audio system.\n\nExterior\nBuilt on the same platform as the Chevrolet Suburban and GMC Yukon XL, the Escalade ESV stretches 20.4 inches longer than the regular Escalade. Fourteen of those inches go to extending the wheelbase, which allows for larger rear doors unconstrained by wheel wells. Height increases by 1.2 inches, and width remains about the same. Despite the bigger dimensions, curb weight increases by just 217 pounds for rear-wheel-drive models.\n\nJeweled headlights\nCadillac’s now-familiar grille up front\nRectangular taillights in back\nEighteen-inch wheels standard; 22-inch wheels optional\nPower liftgate standard\n\nInterior\nThe ESV’s extended dimensions don’t yield significant gains for first- or second-row occupants, but third-row passengers gain nearly 10 inches of legroom. Cargo volume behind the third row increases from 16.9 cubic feet to 45.8 cubic feet. With the third-row seat removed and the second row folded forward, maximum cargo volume is 137.4 cubic feet—about 28 cubic feet more than the regular Escalade.\n\nOptional DVD entertainment system includes a second 8-inch screen for third-row passengers\nStandard leather interior, automatic climate control, power-operated front seats\nStandard seating capacity is seven; available second-row bench expands capacity to eight\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Escalade ESV uses the same engine as the regular Escalade: a 6.2-liter V-8 with 403 horsepower and 417 pounds-feet of torque. It works with a six-speed automatic transmission.\n\n7,600 (RWD) or 7,800 pounds (AWD) of towing capacity when properly equipped\n\nSafety\nSafety equipment includes:\n\nStandard four-wheel-disc antilock brakes\nStandard electronic stability system with rollover mitigation technology\nStandard side curtain airbags in all three rows of seats\nFront-seat side-impact airbags new for 2010",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nCadillac’s Escalade ESV offers more room for those who find the Escalade, a full-size SUV, just a bit too small. Its wheelbase is 14 inches longer than the full-size Escalade, and its total length exceeds the standard model by more than 20 inches. Third-row occupants benefit from increased legroom, and cargo capacity behind them nearly triples. The ESV competes with other luxury SUVs such as the Lincoln Navigator L and Lexus LX 570. As with the regular-wheelbase Escalade, the Escalade ESV gets a full complement of luxury equipment, including leather seats, plenty of exterior chrome and optional 22-inch wheels. It’s available with rear- or all-wheel drive.\n\nNew for 2011\nCadillac now includes standard scheduled oil changes, tire rotations, replacement of engine and cabin air filters, and multipoint vehicle inspection for four years or 50,000 miles.\n\nExterior\nBuilt on the same platform as the Chevrolet Suburban and GMC Yukon XL, the Escalade ESV stretches more than 20 inches longer than the regular Escalade. Fourteen of those inches go to extending the wheelbase, which allows for larger rear doors unconstrained by wheel wells. Height increases by 1.2 inches, and width remains about the same. Despite the bigger dimensions, curb weight increases by just 217 pounds for rear-wheel-drive models. Exterior features include:\n\n\nJeweled headlights\nCadillac’s now-familiar grille up front\nRectangular taillights in back\nEighteen-inch wheels standard; 22-inch wheels optional\nPower liftgate standard\n\nInterior\nThe ESV’s extended dimensions don’t yield significant gains for first- or second-row occupants, but third-row passengers gain nearly 10 inches of legroom. Cargo volume behind the third row increases from 16.9 cubic feet to 45.8 cubic feet. With the third-row seat removed and the second row folded forward, maximum cargo volume is 137.4 cubic feet — about 28 cubic feet more than the regular Escalade. Interior features include:\n\n\nOptional DVD entertainment system includes a second 8-inch screen for third-row passengers\nStandard leather interior, automatic climate control, power-operated front seats\nStandard seating capacity is seven; available second-row bench expands capacity to eight\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Escalade ESV uses the same engine as the regular Escalade: a 6.2-liter V-8 with 403 horsepower and 417 pounds-feet of torque. It works with a six-speed automatic transmission. Mechanical features include:\n\n\n7,600 (RWD) or 7,800 pounds (AWD) of towing capacity when properly equipped\n\nSafety\nSafety equipment includes:\n\n\nStandard four-wheel-disc antilock brakes\nStandard electronic stability system with rollover mitigation technology\nStandard side curtain airbags in all three rows of seats",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Cadillac Escalade?\n\nThe Cadillac Escalade full-size SUV seats up to eight in three rows. It also comes in extended-length ESV form that offers more cargo space and third-row legroom than the regular-length version. Rear- and four-wheel-drive models are offered, and all Escalades are powered by a 420-horsepower, 6.2-liter V-8 that works with a 10-speed automatic transmission. The Escalade shares its platform with the Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban and the GMC Yukon and Yukon XL. Competitors include the Lincoln Navigator, Lexus LX 570 and Infiniti QX80.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2019 Cadillac Escalade?\n\nA new hands-free liftgate is standard. A new available Sport Edition features gloss-black exterior trim and 22-inch wheels.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Cadillac Escalade Are Most Important?\n\nAll Escalades come standard with the Cadillac User Experience multimedia system. CUE features an 8-inch touchscreen, navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and five USB ports. Other standard features include wireless device charging, a power-adjustable steering column, tri-zone automatic climate control, 4G LTE connectivity with a Wi-Fi hot spot (data subscription required after initial trial), power-adjustable pedals, heated and cooled front seats, heated second-row seats, a heated steering wheel, a 360-degree camera system, a power-folding third row and a Bose surround-sound audio system.\n\nPremium options include 18-way power-adjustable front seats with a massage feature for the driver, a cooled center console and a rearview camera mirror. Available active safety features include forward collision warning, lane departure warning, lane keeping assist, blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert, adaptive cruise control, and front and rear automatic emergency braking.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Cadillac Escalade?\n\nThe Escalade is known for big, flashy styling, a powerful V-8 and a luxurious interior. It comes at a steep price, though, as the Escalade starts at more than $76,000. Choose one of the top trims, and a six-figure price tag is in sight. Unfortunately, there's less space in the Escalade's cabin than its exterior bulk suggests, and the SUV's touch-sensitive cabin controls aren't the easiest to use. We recommend checking out the Navigator, too, if the Escalade is on your shopping list.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Cadillac Escalade?\n\nThe Cadillac Escalade full-size SUV seats up to eight in three rows. It also comes in extended-length ESV form that offers more cargo space and third-row legroom than the regular-length version. Rear- and four-wheel-drive models are offered, and all Escalades are powered by a 420-horsepower, 6.2-liter V-8 that works with a 10-speed automatic transmission. The Escalade shares its platform with the Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban and the GMC Yukon and Yukon XL. Competitors include the Lincoln Navigator, Lexus LX 570 and Infiniti QX80.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Cadillac Escalade?\n\nThere are no significant changes this year. A redesigned Escalade is expected soon.\n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Cadillac Escalade Are Most Important?\n\nAll Escalades come standard with the Cadillac User Experience multimedia system. CUE features an 8-inch touchscreen, navigation, five USB ports, and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Other standard features include wireless device charging, a power-adjustable steering column, tri-zone automatic climate control, 4G LTE connectivity with a Wi-Fi hot spot (data subscription required after initial trial), power-adjustable pedals, heated and cooled front seats, heated second-row seats, a heated steering wheel, a 360-degree camera system, a power-folding third row and a Bose surround-sound audio system.\n\nPremium options include 18-way power-adjustable front seats with a massage feature for the driver, a cooled center console and a rearview camera mirror. Available active safety features include forward collision warning, lane departure warning, lane keep assist, blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert, adaptive cruise control, and front and rear automatic emergency braking.\n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Cadillac Escalade?\n\nThe Escalade is known for big, flashy styling, a powerful V-8 and a luxurious interior. It comes at a steep price, though, as the Escalade starts at more than $76,000. If you choose one of the top trims, a six-figure price tag is in sight. Unfortunately, there’s less space in the Escalade’s cabin than its exterior bulk suggests, and the SUV’s touch-sensitive cabin controls aren’t the easiest to use. We recommend checking out the Navigator, too, if the Escalade is on your shopping list. Also be aware that a redesigned Escalade is expected soon.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2022 Cadillac Escalade?\n\nThe Cadillac Escalade is a full-size luxury SUV with room for seven or eight in three rows of seats. It’s powered by a standard 420-horsepower, 6.2-liter V-8 engine or an available 277-hp, turbo-diesel 3.0-liter six-cylinder. Both engines team with a 10-speed automatic transmission, and both rear- and four-wheel drive are available. \n\nCadillac also sells an extended-length ESV version with more cargo space and third-row legroom. Competitors include the Lincoln Navigator and Jeep Grand Wagoneer. \n\nThe regular-length Escalade offers 30.9 cubic feet of cargo space behind its second row and 13.2 cubic feet behind its third row, according to Cars.com’s cargo measurements. You can see how it scored in our Car Seat Check here.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2022 Cadillac Escalade?\n\nLane-keeping assist with lane departure warning is now standard. \n\nWhat Features in the 2022 Cadillac Escalade Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n22-inch alloy wheels \nHeated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nCurved OLED digital dashboard\nWireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity\nAKG Studio sound system\nNavigation system with augmented-reality capability \nWireless device charging\nAutomatic emergency braking\n360-degree camera system \n\nAvailable features include:\n\nAdaptive air suspension\nSoft-closing doors \nPanoramic moonroof\nLeather-wrapped interior \nVentilated and massaging front seats\nConsole refrigerator\nHead-up display\nRearview camera mirror\nDual-screen rear entertainment system\nSuper Cruise hands-free driving system\nAdaptive cruise control\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nRear automatic braking\nNight Vision system\nShould I Buy the 2022 Cadillac Escalade?\n\nIf the price doesn’t scare you off, the Escalade is an excellent choice among full-size luxury SUVs; the redesigned 2021 version won our Luxury Car of the Year award. \n\nThe 2022 Escalade has an outstanding interior packed with tech features and offering comfort in all three rows of seats. The V-8 engine is powerful and quiet, though quite thirsty. Given its size, the Escalade is remarkably easy to drive, but its substantial bulk hinders maneuverability and handling.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Cadillac Escalade?\nThe Cadillac Escalade is a full-size luxury SUV with space for seven or eight people in three rows of seats. Rivals of Cadillac’s largest and most luxurious SUV include the Jeep Grand Wagoneer, Lincoln Navigator and Mercedes-Benz GLS. The Escalade’s standard powertrain is a 420-horsepower, 6.2-liter V-8 that sends power to the rear wheels via a 10-speed automatic transmission. Also available is a relatively fuel-efficient 277-hp, turbo-diesel 3.0-liter six-cylinder. Rear-wheel drive is standard, and four-wheel drive is available with either engine. \nThe high-performance Escalade-V borrows the supercharged V-8 used in Cadillac’s CT5-V Blackwing performance sedan; it has an earth-moving 682 hp, as well as specific styling touches, upgraded brakes and suspension, retuned air suspension settings and standard 4WD. \nCadillac also offers the Escalade in an extended-length ESV version with even more cargo space and third-row legroom. You can see how cargo space varies by checking Cars.com’s cargo measurements. If car seats are part of your daily routine, you can see how the Escalade scored in our Car Seat Check here.\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Cadillac Escalade? \nAfter gaining the outlandish Escalade-V for 2023, Cadillac’s biggest SUV sees minor changes in standard equipment for 2024. Among other adjustments, GM’s Super Cruise hands-free driving-assist system is now standard on all but the base Luxury trim level. Escalade-V models get a 20th Anniversary V-Series Package with subtle cosmetic tweaks and an available Black Diamond Tricoat color.\nWhat Features in the 2024 Cadillac Escalade Are Most Important?\nStandard features include:\n\nHeated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nCurved organic light-emitting diode digital dashboard\nWireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity\nAKG Studio sound system\nNavigation system with augmented-reality capability \nWireless device charging\nAutomatic emergency braking\n360-degree camera system \n22-inch alloy wheels\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nSoft-closing doors \nAdaptive air suspension\nPanoramic moonroof\nVentilated and massaging front seats\nConsole refrigerator\nHead-up display\nRearview camera mirror\nDual-screen rear entertainment system\nSuper Cruise hands-free driving system\nAdaptive cruise control\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nReverse automatic emergency braking\nNight Vision system\n\nShould I Buy the 2024 Cadillac Escalade?\nThe Escalade offers acres of space and gobs of power, especially the outrageous Escalade-V model. Few SUVs serve up this much interior room and luxury, and the Escalade is absolutely brimming with tech and comfort features. Downsides include a steep asking price and poor fuel economy with its two available V-8 engines. Given its sheer size, the Escalade is easier to maneuver than you might imagine, but there’s no getting around the fact that this is a huge sport ute, so plan your parking spots accordingly.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Cadillac Escalade?\n\nThe Cadillac Escalade is a full-size luxury SUV with space for seven or eight people in three rows of seats. Rivals of Cadillac’s largest and most luxurious sport utility include the Lincoln Navigator, Jeep Grand Wagoneer and Mercedes-Benz GLS. The Escalade’s standard powertrain is a 420-horsepower, 6.2-liter V-8 that sends power to the rear wheels via a 10-speed automatic transmission. Also available is a relatively fuel-efficient 277-hp, turbo-diesel 3.0-liter six-cylinder. Rear-wheel drive is standard, and four-wheel drive is available with either engine. Newly added for the 2023 model year is the high-performance Escalade-V. \n\nCadillac also offers an extended-length ESV version, covered separately in Cars.com’s Research section, with even more cargo volume and third-row legroom. You can see how cargo space varies by using Cars.com’s cargo measurements. If car seats are part of your daily driving routine, you can see how the Escalade scored in our Car Seat Check here.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Cadillac Escalade? \n\nCadillac brings the Escalade into its V-Series of high-performance vehicles with the addition of the outlandish Escalade-V. Borrowing the supercharged V-8 used in the CT5-V Blackwing performance sedan, it has an earth-moving 682 hp, as well as specific styling touches, upgraded brakes and suspension, retuned air suspension settings and standard four-wheel drive. \n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Cadillac Escalade Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nHeated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nCurved organic light-emitting diode digital dashboard\nWireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity\nAKG Studio sound system\nNavigation system with augmented-reality capability \nWireless device charging\nAutomatic emergency braking\n360-degree camera system \n22-inch alloy wheels\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nSoft-closing doors \nAdaptive air suspension\nPanoramic moonroof\nVentilated and massaging front seats\nConsole refrigerator\nHead-up display\nRearview camera mirror\nDual-screen rear entertainment system\nSuper Cruise hands-free driving system\nAdaptive cruise control\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nReverse automatic emergency braking\nNight Vision system\nShould I Buy the 2023 Cadillac Escalade?\n\nThe Escalade offers acres of space and gobs of power, especially with the arrival of the outrageous Escalade-V. Few SUVs serve up this much interior room and luxury, and the Escalade is absolutely brimming with tech and comfort features. Downsides include a steep asking price and poor fuel economy with the two available V-8 engines. Given its sheer size, the Escalade is easier to maneuver than you imagine, but there’s no getting around the fact that this is a huge ‘ute, so plan your parking spots accordingly.",
