      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Cadillac XT4?\n\nThe Cadillac XT4 is a five-seat luxury compact SUV that’s powered by a 235-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine paired with a nine-speed automatic transmission. All trim levels are offered with front- or all-wheel drive, and an adaptive suspension is available. The XT4’s rivals include the Audi Q3, BMW X1, Mercedes-Benz GLA and Volvo XC40.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Cadillac XT4?\n\nAfter a refresh for 2024 that included updated exterior styling and a 33-inch dashboard screen encompassing the instrument panel and infotainment displays, the XT4 is little changed for 2025. The base Luxury trim has been discontinued, and previously optional active-safety features are now standard equipment.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Cadillac XT4 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n33-inch infotainment/instrument display\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\n5G Wi-Fi hot spot\nSatellite radio\nPower liftgate\nDual-zone climate control\nRemote start\nAutomatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nAdaptive cruise control\n360-degree camera system\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nHeated front and rear seats\nVentilated and massaging front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nWireless device charging\nRearview camera mirror\nHead-up display\nAdaptive suspension\nShould I Buy the 2025 Cadillac XT4?\n\nDespite its small footprint, the XT4’s interior is roomy, and it benefits from easy-to-understand controls. While many competitors still feel more luxurious in terms of cabin-trim quality, the XT4’s 33-inch curved dashboard display and intuitive infotainment controls are standout features. The turbo four-cylinder has reasonable pep, but it gets loud and uncouth under hard acceleration. The ride is also firmer than what you get in many other small luxury SUVs.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Cadillac XT4?\n\nThe Cadillac XT4 is a small, five-seat luxury SUV that competes with the Audi Q3, BMW X1 and Volvo XC40. All XT4s are powered by a 235-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that works with a nine-speed automatic transmission. Front- and all-wheel-drive versions are available, as is an adaptive suspension. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Cadillac XT4?\n\nLane departure steering assist and blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert are newly standard on the entry-level Luxury trim. \n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Cadillac XT4 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n18-inch alloy wheels \nPower liftgate\nLED headlights and taillights\n8-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity \nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure steering assist\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n20-inch alloy wheels\nLeather-trimmed seats\nMassaging front seats\nHeated front and rear seats\nVentilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nNavigation\nBose premium stereo\nWireless device charging\nRearview camera mirror\n360-degree camera system\nHead-up display\nAdaptive cruise control\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nShould I Buy the 2023 Cadillac XT4?\n\nDespite its small footprint, the XT4’s interior is roomy, and it benefits from easy-to-understand controls. Brake-pedal feel isn’t the best, however, and the front seat cushions could be longer. The competition in this corner of the market is strong, so it’s worth checking out some rivals before making a purchase.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Cadillac’s smallest new SUV packs a well-rounded and accommodating vehicle into a tidy package, but the XT4 suffers teething pains in the form of a numb brake pedal and early transmission problems.\n\nVersus the competition: The XT4 fits well in a subcompact class that’s mostly smaller, yet a price that rises quickly with options puts it in league with compact models that are mostly larger. \n\nCaveat: This review is based on my driving a few XT4s, which I detail below, but I’m compelled first to issue a caveat regarding what might charitably be called teething pains for this new model: Consumer reviews of this new Cadillac on Cars.com — which typically are overwhelmingly positive — average a relatively low 3.5 stars, dragged down by low ratings accompanying claims of transmission failures. Eight Cars.com consumers from California to New York called out transmission problems as recently as April 26, including five replacements under warranty and one vehicle buyback.\n\nCadillac has not recalled the XT4, but it did issue a technical service bulletin (No. 18-NA-378) in December 2018 (and updated February 2019) with the subject “Surge, Chuggle, Fishbite, Shudder Feel During Driving Maneuvers” — a hilarious name, but probably not very funny to an XT4 owner. It details the possibility of a defective stack plate heat exchanger allowing coolant to contaminate the transmission fluid. If signs of contamination are found, both the transmission and the exchanger will be replaced under warranty.\n\nWhat Is an XT4?\n\nMany Cadillacs are the automotive equivalent of half sizes. The XT5, which competes pricewise with what we consider compact SUVs, is arguably in the mid-size class. Similarly, the XT4 starts (key word starts) at the top of the subcompact price range, at $35,790 including destination charges, but is likewise on the higher end of this class in terms of size and roominess, along with the BMW X1. Contrast that with the super-snug subcompact Infiniti QX30 and Mercedes-Benz GLA-Class, which share a platform and much more (see them all side by side).\n\nThe XT4 comes in three trim levels, starting with a low-cost base version called simply Luxury. An additional $4,500 will score either a Premium Luxury or Sport trim level. I tested both versions, which totaled $55,085 and $56,835 as equipped, respectively. Visible differences are few, but you’ll know you’re looking at a Sport if you see a solid gloss-black grille without the chrome facets that appear on other trims. The Sport also has body-colored door handles and gloss-black roof rails and window surrounds, and its taillight lenses are white rather than red. The Premium Luxury has illuminated exterior door handles.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThe XT4 has precise steering and just the right amount of road feel. The main mechanical difference between the Premium Luxury and Sport I drove was the Sport-exclusive Active Sport Suspension option ($1,200), which employs adaptive shock absorbers. Both had optional 20-inch wheels in place of the standard 18s. Overall, the Premium Luxury’s standard suspension is firm but reasonably comfortable without losing a feel for the road, and it controls body motions well in turns. Having a longer wheelbase than most models its size surely helps, and the optional 20-inch wheels didn’t seem to hurt — a good thing considering the optional Driver Assist Package, which includes adaptive cruise control and automatic emergency braking, requires the larger wheels. That said, we don’t like seeing important safety features bundled with other items like this — especially things like larger wheels that are more susceptible to damage and, along with their larger tires, more expensive to replace.\n\nThe Active Sport Suspension manages to retain a character similar to the standard suspension’s, but it ups ride comfort a bit. Following the current trend, there’s little to no difference in ride firmness when you switch the XT4 into Sport mode so long as you’re driving straight. The value in adaptive suspensions is how they monitor conditions and adjust automatically, such as controlling body roll in turns. Though this system uses more conventional adaptive shocks rather than the magnetic system GM uses in some models, Cadillac says they can change damping 500 times a second. The difference between these two adaptive suspension types is minimal compared with a suspension equipped with neither.\n\nBecause of its effect on the drivetrain, you might want to use Sport mode all the time; it holds low gears longer and reduces steering boost. (It isn’t the default mode simply because it’s less efficient.) In models without the adaptive suspension, these are the only changes Sport mode makes. It doesn’t seem to change the accelerator pedal sensitivity — or at least does so minimally — to which I say, hallelujah. My only objection to the drive modes is that one button cycles through them, and the selection isn’t as obvious in the instrument panel or optional head-up display as it could be. An up/down rocker or separate buttons for each mode is a better approach.\n\nThe XT4 marks the debut of a new turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder with variable valve lift and, in limited circumstances, active fuel management (the deactivation of two cylinders). Fortunately, the tech hocus-pocus felt seamless, and the four-cylinder easily went about its job of providing 237 horsepower and a stout 258 pounds-feet of torque from 1,500 to 4,000 rpm. Cadillac says 97 percent of the car’s peak torque is on tap up to 5,000 rpm.\n\nOn the road, the XT4 is no speed demon, but it’s more than adequately powered and the experience is as positive as the torque specs suggest. Unfortunately, it doesn’t sound so great, especially at high revs. Some people object to artificial augmentation of engine sound through the stereo, but this is yet another turbo four-cylinder that reminds me of that particular parlor trick’s merit.\n\nShould Cadillac decide to build a more powerful V-Sport or full-blown V-Series version of the XT4, the vehicles I tested felt like they could handle it.\n\nSeeing a nine-speed automatic transmission struck terror initially — even before we’d learned of the related technical service bulletin — because I associate that number with a nine-speed transmission supplied by Germany’s ZF that I’ve declared irredeemable when paired with small engines in everything from Jeeps to Land Rovers. But this transmission is GM’s, and unlike some of the problems owners have reported, it behaved fine for us — much better than the ZF, with reasonable responsiveness and minimal hunting. I can’t say it’s a favorite because it isn’t as quick as the eight-speed in the Alfa Romeo Stelvio (our most fun compact), and it freewheels too long between gears when downshifting manually with the paddles, but that isn’t likely to register with casual drivers; I’d take it over any continuously variable automatic transmission, such as that in the compact Infiniti QX50 SUV, and certainly over the ZF nine-speed.\n\nAll-Wheel Drive — or Not\n\nBoth of my test vehicles had optional all-wheel drive ($2,500), which is designed to decouple completely when Touring drive mode is selected. In that case, the XT4 reverts to front-wheel drive and stays that way even if the wheels slip. Both the AWD and Sport modes activate the system, which employs two additional clutches in the rear differential to send all available torque to one or the other rear wheel when needed. In spirited driving, the XT4 feels more balanced with AWD activated. What’s the cost of keeping it on? Engineers say as much as 1 mpg.\n\nThe EPA-estimated ratings are 24/30/26 mpg city/highway/combined for front-wheel-drive-only models and 22/29/24 mpg with all-wheel drive, both on required premium gasoline. This is decent mileage compared with subcompact luxury competitors and good compared with most compacts. Among 2019 front-drive subcompacts, the XT4 matches the BMW X1 sDrive28i (26 mpg combined) and is just behind the Infiniti QX30 and Mercedes-Benz GLA250 (27 mpg), but it falls farther behind the Buick Encore (28 mpg) and the most efficient version of the Volvo XC40: the T4 with FWD (29 mpg).\n\nMost of the larger, compact luxury models are thirstier, but there are exceptions: The 2019 BMW X3 sDrive30i matches the XT4, and the 2019 Infiniti QX50 edges it out with 27 mpg combined.\n\nThose Brakes …\n\nThe brakes mark the Cadillac debut of electrohydraulic by-wire power brake assist in place of the usual vacuum assist — a design that’s just beginning to proliferate in the market. Cadillac says this approach cuts down on parasitic losses and has other benefits, including consistency, extended hill holding and stronger pressure for panic-braking assist.\n\nIn practice, the braking proved merely OK. I don’t question its ability to stop the XT4 quickly, but the pedal is hard and a bit difficult to modulate smoothly. In my experience, the average driver doesn’t pay much attention to pedal feel, but I think this might be bad enough to land on the average driver’s radar. All our editors commented on it, and the best anyone said was “the pedal feel isn’t great.”\n\nI support the move toward by-wire brakes because of all the potential advantages and because using vacuum in a car is terribly outdated. I think what we’re seeing here is exactly what we experienced with the first couple of generations of electric power steering: a worthy modernization that has the potential not merely to equal but to surpass the old way of doing things — but that isn’t ready for prime time yet.\n\nCue the New CUE\n\nFortunately, Cadillac ditched the touch-sensitive panels long associated with earlier generations of Cadillac User Experience and went with a generous selection of conventional, mechanical buttons. There’s also an 8-inch touchscreen that’s pretty well-laid-out, has quality maps, and supports Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.\n\nI’d like the volume knob on the dashboard better than the center console, but at least there is one. It doubles as a track-skip joystick and is accompanied by direct-access buttons for the audio, navigation and phone menus, as well as a rotary knob that lets you move around the display if you don’t want to, uh, touch the touchscreen. Given the display’s relatively low placement and the fact that it’s a touchscreen, these controls simply aren’t necessary. But, they do no harm — and if you’re finicky about fingerprints on your displays, they will mitigate that. In a class with maddening touchpad controllers and no-touch displays from the likes of Acura and Lexus, I can’t overstate what a big deal this simple touchscreen system is.\n\nMy main criticism regarding Cadillac’s approach is the touchscreen’s angle: it’s tilted away from occupants rather than facing them directly. It might look neater this way, but it results in too many reflections. I know some people object to a floating display that they say looks like it was added after the fact, so I’m guessing the form-follows-function warriors lost this battle. Some Honda touchscreens are angled back but mitigate the glare with a matte finish; Cadillac ought to look into that. It would cut down on fingerprints, as well.\n\nThe Cabin\n\nLeatherette (imitation leather) is standard on the base (Luxury) and Sport trim levels, while real leather is standard on the Premium Luxury and optional on other trims in the Comfort and Convenience Package, which also adds more adjustments to the front passenger seat as well as massage and ventilation features to both front seats. I experienced only these optional seats, which were comfortable, though I wouldn’t mind a little more thigh support from the front seats; a cushion extension would be great.\n\nOutward visibility to the rear isn’t great due to giant D-pillars, but it’s mitigated by the optional Rear Camera Mirror, which is adjustable for height and zoom. The front cupholders aren’t very large, which becomes even more frustrating once you realize the front door pockets don’t have integral bottle holders.\n\nOn the flip side, I particularly like the optional 15-watt wireless smartphone charging pad because of its placement and an adjustable bottom rest that allows you to use the phone in place by raising the armrest (when the vehicle’s not in motion, of course). Too many vehicles tuck these pads away. If you’re not wireless, you’ll find a regular USB and USB-C port both front and back, plus 12-volt outlets in the front and the cargo area.\n\nBackseat passengers will find more space than they expect with more legroom not just than subcompact competitors, but more than compact SUVs such as the Acura RDX, Audi Q5 and BMW X3 (see them side by side). Headroom is also better than most subcompacts and even rivals the compacts; it’s a bit tight for tall people alongside the optional giant glass moonroof, and the backrest doesn’t recline. If you’re willing to make that small sacrifice, the moonroof gives the cabin an open feel, and it’s equipped with a powered shade that’s opaque and thick enough to absorb sound effectively.\n\nCargo\n\nA roomy backseat often makes for smaller cargo volume behind it, but with the exception of the X1, which has almost 5 cubic feet more space, the XT4 is superior to most subcompacts. With their backseats lowered, the XT4’s maximum volume is 10 cubic feet smaller than the X1’s. In most cases, compact competitors exceed the XT4’s cargo volume.\n\nRather than projecting a logo on the ground on either side just to show off, the XT4 uses its discreet Cadillac crest to mark where to kick your foot to operate the optional hands-free power liftgate. Neat use of the feature.\n\nSafety and Advanced Features\n\nAs of publication, the XT4 had not been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. When it is, scores will appear here or here, depending on how IIHS classifies it. In a broader sense, the XT4’s active-safety and convenience features are just barely competitive because of their limited availability across trim levels, plus it’s missing one high-value feature: The base trim level comes with rear parking sensors and a backup camera, but it isn’t eligible for the following features that are available on the Premium Luxury and Sport.\n\nFront parking sensors (standard)\nBlind spot warning (standard)\nRear cross-traffic alert (standard)\nForward and rear automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection (optional)\nLane departure warning and prevention (optional)\nRearview camera mirror (optional)\n360-degree camera system (optional)\nAdaptive cruise control (optional)\nActive parking assist (optional)\n\n \n\nOne glaring omission is lane-centering steering. The optional Lane Keep Assist corrects the XT4 if it strays out of its lane, but many competitors now keep the vehicle centered in its lane — during highway driving at minimum. Though Cadillac debuted one of the most ambitious such systems, called Super Cruise, on the CT6 sedan, it won’t begin to spread to other GM vehicles until 2020.\n\nShould You Buy the Cadillac XT4?\n\nEven though the early transmission problems don’t inspire confidence, it seems the cause was clear, and there’s a chance this obstacle is in the XT4’s proverbial rearview mirror. If you’re considering one, I’d pay as much attention to the shortcomings that aren’t going to change, such as the brake pedal feel or anything else above that conflicted with your preferences. Otherwise, I found the XT4 to be a well-rounded and appealing choice with the potential to sell well.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: A big, honkin’ 33-inch touchscreen and suite of subtle aesthetic changes to both the exterior and interior make the refreshed 2024 Cadillac XT4 a “killer app” in the fiercely competitive luxury compact SUV class.\n\nVersus the competition: The 2024 Cadillac XT4 swims in quite the populated class, butting headlights with mainstays like the Lincoln Corsair and Lexus NX. Cadillac has deliberately positioned the XT4 as a tweener size, larger than crossovers like the BMW X1 but smaller than the X3, ditto with the Mercedes-Benz GLA and larger GLC. For some buyers, this Cadillac will be the perfect size; for others, springing for the next size up might make more sense.\n\nCadillac’s future is electric, but the luxury marquee’s present bills are primarily paid by its healthy selection of gas-powered SUVs (which, for the moment, still enjoy strong sales). This bevy of battery-powered cars in the pipeline, meanwhile, functions as the brand’s trickle-down technology launchpad. The refreshed XT4 is a perfect example of this, offering buyers a crack at the electric Lyriq’s expansive 33-inch touchscreen in a far more conventional package.\n\nRelated: 2024 Cadillac XT4 Gets New Styling, Safety Tech, 33-Inch Touchscreen\n\nThe XT4’s 2024 refresh has been a long time coming. Caddy’s subcompact SUV has cruised virtually untouched since its introduction for the 2019 model year, and while the tweaks and twiddles it sees for 2024 are hardly an overhaul, they bring the XT4 more in line with the brand’s latest offerings.\n\n2024 Cadillac XT4 | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\nFresh(ish) Threads\n\nCadillac’s holistic design language has shifted slightly since the XT4 was wrapper-fresh, and a slightly massaged schnozz for the 2024 version is the most apparent exterior change. The XT4’s new, sleeker headlights, more sculpted lower front end and sharper grille split the difference between Cadillac’s larger XT6 and Escalade SUVs, albeit at scale. In back, good luck pinpointing what’s different without a side-by-side comparison; repositioned rear reflectors are the most significant change, shifted from a strip at the bottom to scallops on the outer edges of the bumper. There’s also a new selection of available wheel designs.\n\nInside, there’s some new upholstery colors and a smorgasbord of available trim materials, including wood, aluminum and carbon fiber. The XT4 also adds a cluster of new standard tech to its active safety suite: blind zone steering assist, rear cross-traffic braking, front braking for pedestrians and cyclists, automatic high-beam headlights and lane departure steering assist. Automatic cross-traffic emergency braking, speed limit assist and traffic sign recognition have been added to the XT4’s available Active Safety Package.\n\nSuper Screen\n2024 Cadillac XT4 | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\n\nThe 33-inch elephant — or maybe tapir — in the cabin is by far the 2024 XT4’s most significant upgrade. The new 33-inch curved touchscreen pulls much of its presentation and interface from Cadillac’s larger, all-electric Lyriq SUV. Serving as a contiguous display that includes both the instrumentation and infotainment screens, it’s the first thing you’ll notice in the XT4’s cabin.\n\nCadillac says the screen’s resolution peaks at 9K, and based on the rich presentation and needle-sharp animation, we believe it. Touch capability extends from the center portion to the far left driver-side section, where you can swap display styles, themes and standard data readouts, including trip mileage and fuel consumption. In practice, the display is as gorgeous as it is intuitive and quick-responding. Menu and screen transitions are nearly as quick and clean as a new iPad, and users can navigate them either through standard touch or via redundant hard controls on the center console.\n\nNervous yet, Apple CarPlay fans? Fret not: While GM is looking to purge both Apple CarPlay and Android Auto from future vehicles, the 2024 XT4 not only still offers both, they’re both wireless and complemented by Google Built-In infotainment architecture.\n\n2024 Cadillac XT4 | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\nInterior Intricacy\n\nHooray for CarPlay and hooray for physical buttons. We’re at least a generation removed from Caddy’s infamous touch-capacitive Cadillac User Experience system, but we’re still grateful for the gradual industrywide return to physical controls in place of touch-based ones. In the XT4, a strip of soft-touch switches toggle climate controls and a selection of driver-assist functions. The climate controls are augmented by a ridiculously smooth digital display for temperature and fan functions; it’s a seemingly trivial feature, but these little details add up to a slick package.\n\nThere’s a handful of these “surprise and delight” features and design flourishes spread throughout the cabin. Approach the XT4 directly from the front and you’ll see a modestly sized metallic Cadillac crest mounted proudly on the back of that new screen, a tiny flair that’s easily visible through the windshield. On the passenger’s portion of the dash, the center trim doubles back on itself, capped with metallic trim inscribed with the traditional “Cadillac” script.\n\n2024 Cadillac XT4 | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\nSubstance for All That Style?\n\nTime to drive. In this regard, prior opinions on the XT4’s dynamic capabilities — or lack thereof — remain unchanged. The XT4’s mechanical hardware remains the same, with the familiar turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder as the sole powertrain and a choice of front- or all-wheel drive.\n\nThe engine makes 235 horsepower and 258 pounds-feet of torque and works with a nine-speed automatic transmission. The pair returns more-than-adequate merging and passing power, though our FWD test car noticeably tugged the wheel during our hardest on-ramp efforts. Still, there are no real complaints here — we’re just glad there’s enough torque to notice. Driver inputs are as unremarkable and inoffensive as they should be in a premium (sub)compact SUV, though steering was slower than both expectations and preference. It’s less about thrill-seeking and more about wishing for a tighter ratio in Los Angeles parking lots — something to keep in mind if you plan to thread your new XT4 through some tight spots.\n\n2024 Cadillac XT4 | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\n\nAfter crisscrossing what felt like the entire Los Angeles metroplex twice over, the 2024 XT4 proved itself the comfortable, refined and well-appointed premium runabout we expected it to be. It does, however, display some moderately jouncy suspension tuning; serving as a trans-L.A. hiking shuttle for a pair of friends, both politely complained of minor motion sickness from the XT4’s disjointed body control and noticeably rough suspension rebound.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nRefreshed 2024 Cadillac XT4 Starts at $39,090, Gets Updated Tech\nAll About the Optiqs: Cadillac Reveals 2025 Optiq EV\n2026 Cadillac Vistiq: Electric, 3 Rows, All Else TBA\nResearch the 2024 Cadillac XT4\nShop for a 2024 Cadillac XT4\nMoney Matters\n\nAll in, the 2024 Cadillac XT4 is a stylish reminder that the premium compact SUV class is one of the more attractively priced corners of the market, especially for buyers who don’t require more space. At $48,625 (including destination) for our mid-grade Premium Luxury trim, the refreshed XT4 represents a meaningful material and aesthetic upgrade from downmarket segment siblings like a well-equipped Chevrolet Equinox or Toyota RAV4, both of which can easily top $40,000.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2022 Cadillac XT4?\n\nThe Cadillac XT4 is a small, five-seat luxury SUV that competes with the Audi Q3, BMW X1 and Volvo XC40. All XT4s are powered by a 235-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that works with a nine-speed automatic transmission. Front- and all-wheel-drive versions are available, as is an adaptive suspension.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2022 Cadillac XT4?\n\nThere are no significant changes this year.\n\nWhat Features in the 2022 Cadillac XT4 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n18-inch alloy wheels\nPower liftgate\nLED headlights and taillights\n8-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n20-inch alloy wheels\nLeather-trimmed seats\nMassaging front seats\nHeated front and rear seats\nVentilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nNavigation\nBose premium stereo\nWireless device charging\nRearview camera mirror\n360-degree camera system\nHead-up display\nAdaptive cruise control\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nLane-keeping assist\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nShould I Buy the 2022 Cadillac XT4?\n\nDespite its small footprint, the XT4’s interior is roomy and benefits from easy-to-understand controls. Brake-pedal feel isn’t the best, however, and the front seat cushions could be longer. The competition in this corner of the market is strong, so it’s worth checking out some rivals before making a purchase.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2021 Cadillac XT4?\n\nThe Cadillac XT4 is a five-seat, small luxury SUV that competes with the Audi Q3, BMW X1 and Volvo XC40. All XT4s are powered by a 237-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that works with a nine-speed automatic transmission. Front- and all-wheel-drive models are available, as is an adaptive suspension. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2021 Cadillac XT4?\n\nWireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity and a power liftgate are now standard. Sport trim levels now have red brake calipers, and Premium Luxury and Sport models add heated, power-folding side mirrors with an auto-dimming feature for the driver’s mirror. \n\nWhat Features in the 2021 Cadillac XT4 Are Most Important?\n8-inch touchscreen multimedia system \n4G LTE Wi-Fi hot spot (data subscription required after trial)\nAutomatic emergency braking\nAvailable wireless device charging \nAvailable dual-pane panoramic moonroof\nAvailable lane-keeping assist and adaptive cruise control  \nShould I Buy the 2021 Cadillac XT4?\n\nDespite its small footprint, the XT4’s interior is roomy and benefits from easy-to-understand controls. However, brake-pedal feel isn’t the best, and the front seat cushions could be longer. The competition in this corner of the market is strong, so it’s worth checking them out before making a purchase.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Cadillac’s smallest new SUV packs a well-rounded and accommodating vehicle into a tidy package, but the XT4 suffers teething pains in the form of a numb brake pedal and early transmission problems.\n\nVersus the competition: The XT4 fits well in a subcompact class that’s mostly smaller, yet a price that rises quickly with options puts it in league with compact models that are mostly larger. \n\nCaveat: This review is based on my driving a few XT4s, which I detail below, but I’m compelled first to issue a caveat regarding what might charitably be called teething pains for this new model: Consumer reviews of this new Cadillac on Cars.com — which typically are overwhelmingly positive — average a relatively low 3.5 stars, dragged down by low ratings accompanying claims of transmission failures. Eight Cars.com consumers from California to New York called out transmission problems as recently as April 26, including five replacements under warranty and one vehicle buyback.\n\nCadillac has not recalled the XT4, but it did issue a technical service bulletin (No. 18-NA-378) in December 2018 (and updated February 2019) with the subject “Surge, Chuggle, Fishbite, Shudder Feel During Driving Maneuvers” — a hilarious name, but probably not very funny to an XT4 owner. It details the possibility of a defective stack plate heat exchanger allowing coolant to contaminate the transmission fluid. If signs of contamination are found, both the transmission and the exchanger will be replaced under warranty.\n\nWhat Is an XT4?\n\nMany Cadillacs are the automotive equivalent of half sizes. The XT5, which competes pricewise with what we consider compact SUVs, is arguably in the mid-size class. Similarly, the XT4 starts (key word starts) at the top of the subcompact price range, at $35,790 including destination charges, but is likewise on the higher end of this class in terms of size and roominess, along with the BMW X1. Contrast that with the super-snug subcompact Infiniti QX30 and Mercedes-Benz GLA-Class, which share a platform and much more (see them all side by side).\n\nThe XT4 comes in three trim levels, starting with a low-cost base version called simply Luxury. An additional $4,500 will score either a Premium Luxury or Sport trim level. I tested both versions, which totaled $55,085 and $56,835 as equipped, respectively. Visible differences are few, but you’ll know you’re looking at a Sport if you see a solid gloss-black grille without the chrome facets that appear on other trims. The Sport also has body-colored door handles and gloss-black roof rails and window surrounds, and its taillight lenses are white rather than red. The Premium Luxury has illuminated exterior door handles.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThe XT4 has precise steering and just the right amount of road feel. The main mechanical difference between the Premium Luxury and Sport I drove was the Sport-exclusive Active Sport Suspension option ($1,200), which employs adaptive shock absorbers. Both had optional 20-inch wheels in place of the standard 18s. Overall, the Premium Luxury’s standard suspension is firm but reasonably comfortable without losing a feel for the road, and it controls body motions well in turns. Having a longer wheelbase than most models its size surely helps, and the optional 20-inch wheels didn’t seem to hurt — a good thing considering the optional Driver Assist Package, which includes adaptive cruise control and automatic emergency braking, requires the larger wheels. That said, we don’t like seeing important safety features bundled with other items like this — especially things like larger wheels that are more susceptible to damage and, along with their larger tires, more expensive to replace.\n\nThe Active Sport Suspension manages to retain a character similar to the standard suspension’s, but it ups ride comfort a bit. Following the current trend, there’s little to no difference in ride firmness when you switch the XT4 into Sport mode so long as you’re driving straight. The value in adaptive suspensions is how they monitor conditions and adjust automatically, such as controlling body roll in turns. Though this system uses more conventional adaptive shocks rather than the magnetic system GM uses in some models, Cadillac says they can change damping 500 times a second. The difference between these two adaptive suspension types is minimal compared with a suspension equipped with neither.\n\nBecause of its effect on the drivetrain, you might want to use Sport mode all the time; it holds low gears longer and reduces steering boost. (It isn’t the default mode simply because it’s less efficient.) In models without the adaptive suspension, these are the only changes Sport mode makes. It doesn’t seem to change the accelerator pedal sensitivity — or at least does so minimally — to which I say, hallelujah. My only objection to the drive modes is that one button cycles through them, and the selection isn’t as obvious in the instrument panel or optional head-up display as it could be. An up/down rocker or separate buttons for each mode is a better approach.\n\nThe XT4 marks the debut of a new turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder with variable valve lift and, in limited circumstances, active fuel management (the deactivation of two cylinders). Fortunately, the tech hocus-pocus felt seamless, and the four-cylinder easily went about its job of providing 237 horsepower and a stout 258 pounds-feet of torque from 1,500 to 4,000 rpm. Cadillac says 97 percent of the car’s peak torque is on tap up to 5,000 rpm.\n\nOn the road, the XT4 is no speed demon, but it’s more than adequately powered and the experience is as positive as the torque specs suggest. Unfortunately, it doesn’t sound so great, especially at high revs. Some people object to artificial augmentation of engine sound through the stereo, but this is yet another turbo four-cylinder that reminds me of that particular parlor trick’s merit.\n\nShould Cadillac decide to build a more powerful V-Sport or full-blown V-Series version of the XT4, the vehicles I tested felt like they could handle it.\n\nSeeing a nine-speed automatic transmission struck terror initially — even before we’d learned of the related technical service bulletin — because I associate that number with a nine-speed transmission supplied by Germany’s ZF that I’ve declared irredeemable when paired with small engines in everything from Jeeps to Land Rovers. But this transmission is GM’s, and unlike some of the problems owners have reported, it behaved fine for us — much better than the ZF, with reasonable responsiveness and minimal hunting. I can’t say it’s a favorite because it isn’t as quick as the eight-speed in the Alfa Romeo Stelvio (our most fun compact), and it freewheels too long between gears when downshifting manually with the paddles, but that isn’t likely to register with casual drivers; I’d take it over any continuously variable automatic transmission, such as that in the compact Infiniti QX50 SUV, and certainly over the ZF nine-speed.\n\nAll-Wheel Drive — or Not\n\nBoth of my test vehicles had optional all-wheel drive ($2,500), which is designed to decouple completely when Touring drive mode is selected. In that case, the XT4 reverts to front-wheel drive and stays that way even if the wheels slip. Both the AWD and Sport modes activate the system, which employs two additional clutches in the rear differential to send all available torque to one or the other rear wheel when needed. In spirited driving, the XT4 feels more balanced with AWD activated. What’s the cost of keeping it on? Engineers say as much as 1 mpg.\n\nThe EPA-estimated ratings are 24/30/26 mpg city/highway/combined for front-wheel-drive-only models and 22/29/24 mpg with all-wheel drive, both on required premium gasoline. This is decent mileage compared with subcompact luxury competitors and good compared with most compacts. Among 2019 front-drive subcompacts, the XT4 matches the BMW X1 sDrive28i (26 mpg combined) and is just behind the Infiniti QX30 and Mercedes-Benz GLA250 (27 mpg), but it falls farther behind the Buick Encore (28 mpg) and the most efficient version of the Volvo XC40: the T4 with FWD (29 mpg).\n\nMost of the larger, compact luxury models are thirstier, but there are exceptions: The 2019 BMW X3 sDrive30i matches the XT4, and the 2019 Infiniti QX50 edges it out with 27 mpg combined.\n\nThose Brakes …\n\nThe brakes mark the Cadillac debut of electrohydraulic by-wire power brake assist in place of the usual vacuum assist — a design that’s just beginning to proliferate in the market. Cadillac says this approach cuts down on parasitic losses and has other benefits, including consistency, extended hill holding and stronger pressure for panic-braking assist.\n\nIn practice, the braking proved merely OK. I don’t question its ability to stop the XT4 quickly, but the pedal is hard and a bit difficult to modulate smoothly. In my experience, the average driver doesn’t pay much attention to pedal feel, but I think this might be bad enough to land on the average driver’s radar. All our editors commented on it, and the best anyone said was “the pedal feel isn’t great.”\n\nI support the move toward by-wire brakes because of all the potential advantages and because using vacuum in a car is terribly outdated. I think what we’re seeing here is exactly what we experienced with the first couple of generations of electric power steering: a worthy modernization that has the potential not merely to equal but to surpass the old way of doing things — but that isn’t ready for prime time yet.\n\nCue the New CUE\n\nFortunately, Cadillac ditched the touch-sensitive panels long associated with earlier generations of Cadillac User Experience and went with a generous selection of conventional, mechanical buttons. There’s also an 8-inch touchscreen that’s pretty well-laid-out, has quality maps, and supports Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.\n\nI’d like the volume knob on the dashboard better than the center console, but at least there is one. It doubles as a track-skip joystick and is accompanied by direct-access buttons for the audio, navigation and phone menus, as well as a rotary knob that lets you move around the display if you don’t want to, uh, touch the touchscreen. Given the display’s relatively low placement and the fact that it’s a touchscreen, these controls simply aren’t necessary. But, they do no harm — and if you’re finicky about fingerprints on your displays, they will mitigate that. In a class with maddening touchpad controllers and no-touch displays from the likes of Acura and Lexus, I can’t overstate what a big deal this simple touchscreen system is.\n\nMy main criticism regarding Cadillac’s approach is the touchscreen’s angle: it’s tilted away from occupants rather than facing them directly. It might look neater this way, but it results in too many reflections. I know some people object to a floating display that they say looks like it was added after the fact, so I’m guessing the form-follows-function warriors lost this battle. Some Honda touchscreens are angled back but mitigate the glare with a matte finish; Cadillac ought to look into that. It would cut down on fingerprints, as well.\n\nThe Cabin\n\nLeatherette (imitation leather) is standard on the base (Luxury) and Sport trim levels, while real leather is standard on the Premium Luxury and optional on other trims in the Comfort and Convenience Package, which also adds more adjustments to the front passenger seat as well as massage and ventilation features to both front seats. I experienced only these optional seats, which were comfortable, though I wouldn’t mind a little more thigh support from the front seats; a cushion extension would be great.\n\nOutward visibility to the rear isn’t great due to giant D-pillars, but it’s mitigated by the optional Rear Camera Mirror, which is adjustable for height and zoom. The front cupholders aren’t very large, which becomes even more frustrating once you realize the front door pockets don’t have integral bottle holders.\n\nOn the flip side, I particularly like the optional 15-watt wireless smartphone charging pad because of its placement and an adjustable bottom rest that allows you to use the phone in place by raising the armrest (when the vehicle’s not in motion, of course). Too many vehicles tuck these pads away. If you’re not wireless, you’ll find a regular USB and USB-C port both front and back, plus 12-volt outlets in the front and the cargo area.\n\nBackseat passengers will find more space than they expect with more legroom not just than subcompact competitors, but more than compact SUVs such as the Acura RDX, Audi Q5 and BMW X3 (see them side by side). Headroom is also better than most subcompacts and even rivals the compacts; it’s a bit tight for tall people alongside the optional giant glass moonroof, and the backrest doesn’t recline. If you’re willing to make that small sacrifice, the moonroof gives the cabin an open feel, and it’s equipped with a powered shade that’s opaque and thick enough to absorb sound effectively.\n\nCargo\n\nA roomy backseat often makes for smaller cargo volume behind it, but with the exception of the X1, which has almost 5 cubic feet more space, the XT4 is superior to most subcompacts. With their backseats lowered, the XT4’s maximum volume is 10 cubic feet smaller than the X1’s. In most cases, compact competitors exceed the XT4’s cargo volume.\n\nRather than projecting a logo on the ground on either side just to show off, the XT4 uses its discreet Cadillac crest to mark where to kick your foot to operate the optional hands-free power liftgate. Neat use of the feature.\n\nSafety and Advanced Features\n\nAs of publication, the XT4 had not been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. When it is, scores will appear here or here, depending on how IIHS classifies it. In a broader sense, the XT4’s active-safety and convenience features are just barely competitive because of their limited availability across trim levels, plus it’s missing one high-value feature: The base trim level comes with rear parking sensors and a backup camera, but it isn’t eligible for the following features that are available on the Premium Luxury and Sport.\n\nFront parking sensors (standard)\nBlind spot warning (standard)\nRear cross-traffic alert (standard)\nForward and rear automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection (optional)\nLane departure warning and prevention (optional)\nRearview camera mirror (optional)\n360-degree camera system (optional)\nAdaptive cruise control (optional)\nActive parking assist (optional)\n\n \n\nOne glaring omission is lane-centering steering. The optional Lane Keep Assist corrects the XT4 if it strays out of its lane, but many competitors now keep the vehicle centered in its lane — during highway driving at minimum. Though Cadillac debuted one of the most ambitious such systems, called Super Cruise, on the CT6 sedan, it won’t begin to spread to other GM vehicles until 2020.\n\nShould You Buy the Cadillac XT4?\n\nEven though the early transmission problems don’t inspire confidence, it seems the cause was clear, and there’s a chance this obstacle is in the XT4’s proverbial rearview mirror. If you’re considering one, I’d pay as much attention to the shortcomings that aren’t going to change, such as the brake pedal feel or anything else above that conflicted with your preferences. Otherwise, I found the XT4 to be a well-rounded and appealing choice with the potential to sell well.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
