      "expert_review": "Curve dancing done well requires good music and a nimble automobile. No ordinary car will do. No truck need apply. You can’t salsa with a wimp. You can’t tango with an elephant.\n\nCurve dancing demands a tight body and responsive soul. It is ritualistic art — engine humming, music pumping, speed building, approaching the entrance to the curve, easing into its apex, letting the curve take you as you take it, flowing into a graceful exit.\n\nThat is the joy of driving a car such as the 2005 Cadillac STS Northstar V-8 sedan. It is made to dance. Its body is sleek versus slick, chiseled yet sensuous, stunning without the slightest hint of being overdone — purposeful.\n\nMay I have this dance?\n\nCurves?\n\nYes.\n\nThe music was Armik, the Rev. Al Green, Ray Charles and B.B. King. The routes were U.S. 50 East running into Annapolis and Bay Ridge, Md.; and after a visit there with friends, it was back on U.S. 50 again, this time heading west toward a hookup with Interstate 66 on the way to Virginia’s Shenandoah Valley.\n\nIf you love dancing and driving, you know that the only difference between the two is the size of the floor. In a car that can boogie, the floor is as wide and long as the road you’re on. If the road has cozy and exciting corners, so much the better. You and your partner can become familiar in those spots, which is where I learned a few things about the STS V-8.\n\nTwo months before going out with that car, I had driven many other automobiles — high-enders such as the Aston Martin DB9, the Bentley Arnage and Continental GT, and the Mercedes-Benz CL600 — all of them good dancers, all of them costing substantially more than the STS V-8.\n\nBut bigger prices do not guarantee better talent. (Base price on the tested Cadillac STS V-8 is $47,025. Dealer’s invoice price on the base model is $43,025.) The STS V-8 danced as well as all of the pricey exotics, and in the case of the elegant but stiff-bordering-on-stuffy $243,000 Bentley Arnage, it danced a heck of a lot better. If that surprises you, it’s a safe bet you haven’t driven a Cadillac, or haven’t even been a passenger in one, for at least 15 years, which means you’ve missed a lot. Cadillac has changed tremendously for the better in recent years; and the new rear-wheel-drive STS V-8 and its siblings — the rear-wheel-drive STS V-6 and the STS V-8 all-wheel-drive — are proof. The cars collectively replace the Cadillac Seville, which was introduced in 1956.\n\nCadillac’s workmanship now rivals that of any luxury automobile manufacturer from Europe or Asia. Exterior and interior gaps have been reduced to the most narrow of apertures. The STS V-8, for example, feels solid, tight, rattle-free right.\n\nThe car has a curb weight — factory weight minus passengers and cargo — of 4,230 pounds, but the STS V-8 feels hundreds of pounds lighter than that. You can swing with it. It goes exactly where you point it, exactly when you point it, keeping up with every movement of your hands with precision and grace.\n\nThe interior is comfortable and finely crafted. The seats are all leather, and it is rich and supple. There are attractive, judicious applications of eucalyptus wood trim on the center console and door panel, and the vinyl portions of the instrument panel are high-quality, soft-to-touch vinyl.\n\nTechnologically, the truly expensive luxury mobiles have nothing discernibly, measurably better than the STS V-8. For example, the Cadillac’s touch-screen navigation system works better than anything lately used by BMW or Mercedes-Benz. Its standard OnStar emergency telecommunications system has long been the best in the business. The STS V-8 also is available with Bluetooth wireless networking capability and an advanced voice-recognition system.\n\nIn summary, the car is smart, sexy, hot — very hot. The Northstar V-8 has a maximum 320 horsepower, and although you’ll probably never use all of it, it’s just fun thinking about the possibility.\n\nThe valves are electronically controlled (variable valve timing) for more precise air/fuel intake, combustion and exhaust, which help increase power without a big jump in fuel consumption. Maximum torque is 315 foot-pounds at 4,400 rpm. A 255-hp V-6 is available for the more fuel-conscious buyer.\n\nBoth engines are mated to five-speed automatic transmissions that also can be shifted manually.\n\nAnd to all of the street spectators who asked: Yes, it’s a Cadillac designed and engineered by General Motors Corp. No, it’s not a Lexus, BMW, Italian car or any other foreign luxury car with a Cadillac grille and badge. It’s a Cadillac. OK?\n\nPurse-strings note: Check out all three STS versions. Compare with Audi A6, BMW 5 Series, Lexus GS 430, Mercedes-Benz E-Class.",

      "expert_review": "ANN ARBOR — Over pizza and pop one night in the late ’90s, John Smith, Cadillac’s then-general manager, shared his vision for the brand: A new and distinctive family look that would tie Cadillac’s disparate product portfolio closer together, topped by an exclusive series of limited-edition performance models that would rival Europe’s best.\n\nThe culmination of that dream is the 2006 Cadillac STS-V, one of the most powerful American-built sedans ever and the first serious challenger to BMW’s M-series cars and the AMG range from Mercedes-Benz.\n\nThe new STS-V is just reaching U.S. dealers and eventually will head across the Atlantic to tackle the German supercars on their home turf. It is the second of Cadillac’s high-performance V-series cars, following the fast, but flawed 2005 CTS-V. The $77,090 STS-V (the price includes shipping and a $2,100 gas guzzler tax) is not the most expensive Cadillac ever. That honor is reserved for the third entry in the series, the new 2006 XLR-V, which retails for a cool $100,000.\n\nThe V-series Cadillacs have generated lots of buzz for the division, nearly all of it positive. In fact, nearly a decade later, Smith’s long-range strategy has played out so successfully for General Motors Corp. and its prestige marque that Cadillac’s current leadership already is plotting an even more potent “Super V” range later in the decade.\n\nFor the time being, however, the STS-V more than holds its own against the M5 and the E55 AMG.\n\nThe exterior lines of the standard STS are sharply chiseled, in the modern-day Cadillac design idiom first established by the CTS, albeit in a more subdued execution. The V edition doesn’t look radically different, adding a modest deck spoiler in the rear and a garish wire-mesh grille — you’ve seen it before on aftermarket dress-up kits for the Chrysler 300C — to distinguish the go-fast variant from its garden-variety sibling.\n\nThe stance looks more aggressive, in part because Cadillac engineers have fitted low-profile Pirelli EMT tires on unique alloy wheels — 18s in front, 19s in the rear. But in basic black (or “black raven,” as the marketing department has dubbed it), this is as close to a stealth sport sedan as you’re liable to find in this price/performance class.\n\nInside, the STS-V’s two-tone cabin is much warmer than the stark, metallic look of the M5 we recently tested.\n\nIt may be a little bland, but the cockpit is pleasantly trimmed in rich leather and a smoky, grayish polished ash.\n\nThe electroluminescent gauges are clean and simple, although the red needles aren’t nearly as cool and tasteful as the blue needles on the new Escalade.\n\nThe STS-V comes with no options; all the amenities — and there are many — are standard. (If you don’t like the sunroof, you can delete it when you order the car.) Features include keyless access with remote start, heated front and rear seats, power tilt/telescope steering column, DVD navigation, XM satellite radio and a Bose 5.1 premium audio system.\n\nThe standard safety equipment is also top drawer, consisting of stability and traction control, antilock brakes with electronic brake assist, side air bags and side curtains, ultrasonic rear park assist, rain-sensing wipers and tire pressure monitor.\n\nOur gripes are few: A rather austere rear compartment that doesn’t provide enough leg or knee room, massive rear pillars and a tall rear parcel shelf that reduce rearward visibility, and a nav system that is not as intuitive as those offered by some competitors.\n\nAnd now we get down to the nitty-gritty, the STS-V’s raison d’etre — the superb chassis and driveline.\n\nThe heart of this M-fighter is a new supercharged 4.4-liter variant of GM’s great Northstar V-8, packing 469 horsepower and 439 pounds-feet of torque. One of the most powerful American-built engines, it is coupled with a six-speed automatic gearbox with manual shift capability (although it lacks fingertip shift controls). The engineers have tuned the exhaust note so it’s throaty, but not raucous, while the engine itself sounds amazingly silky and civilized, considering its race-track breeding.\n\nPerformance, needless to say, is exceptional. Acceleration is smooth and controlled; thanks to the extra wallop from the supercharger, the STS-V is capable of galloping from zero to 60 m.p.h. in just under five seconds, which is nearly as quick as the rocket-like V-10 in the M5. The Cadillac’s six-speed box shifts much more smoothly than the herky-jerky SMG in the BMW. On the downside, the EPA ratings are pretty dismal — 14 mpg in the city and 20 on the highway, which earns the STS-V the aforementioned guzzler penalty.\n\nBut a hot motor isn’t much fun without the right accoutrements — wheels, tires, brakes, steering and suspension. In this case, we can’t say enough good things about the STS-V chassis, which is world-class. Cadillac has upgraded the critical suspension bits, increasing both roll and ride stiffness to give the STS-V a firm, yet controlled ride that is surprisingly compliant, despite the harder sidewalls on the Pirelli run-flat tires. A quicker ZF steering gear bestows a razor-sharp precision, while oversize Brembo brakes dramatically reduce the stopping distance.\n\nAs good as the STS-V is right out of the box — and it is truly a joy to drive — we’d love to see just a few improvements. Our wish list would start with all-wheel drive, larger wheels and tires (at least 20s), shift paddles or fingertip controls for the gearbox, a more tasteful and distinctive front end, some richer matte-finish wood in the cabin and a roomier, more luxurious rear seating compartment.\n\nPerhaps Cadillac will address some of those issues on the next iteration — the so-called Super V, or whatever it will be branded. Until then, the 2006 Cadillac STS-V is pretty awesome and a worthy competitor to the M5 and the E55 AMG.\n\nIndeed, this Cadillac is simply the best American luxury/sport sedan ever.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nLittle is changed on Cadillac’s STS sedan for 2007. Engines include a 3.6-liter V-6 or 4.4-liter Northstar V-8, both shared with a wide range of Cadillac vehicles. The latter engine receives a new six-speed automatic transmission for 2007, replacing last year’s five-speed automatic.\n\nAll-wheel drive is available with either engine.\n\nCadillac stepped into rear-wheel-drive territory with its STS sedan, which replaced the front-wheel-drive Seville for 2005. Built on a Sigma-based architecture, like the company’s smaller CTS sedan and SRX sport utility vehicle, the STS was Cadillac’s first rear-drive luxury performance sedan in a quarter of a century.\n\nTechnology, whether standard or optional, is a big part of the STS picture. A Performance Algorithm Liftfoot system controls transmission operation to enhance spirited driving. Two-mode Magnetic Ride Control is optional. Keyless Access lets you enter and start the vehicle by carrying a special key fob. Smart Remote Start operates from up to 200 feet away.\n\nOptional Adaptive Cruise Control uses radar to maintain a set distance from vehicles ahead. IntelliBeam automatically selects either the high- or low-beam headlights in response to oncoming lights. The driver gets a four-color head-up display.\n\nA high-performance STS-V sedan joined the lineup in 2006. It packs a supercharged 4.4-liter V-8 with 469 horsepower.\n(Skip to details on the: STS-V)\n\nExterior\nDesigned with a chiseled look, the four-door STS features what Cadillac says is a “faster profile” with “more rake” than the CTS. Cadillac styling touches include a wide airfoil grille with dual horizontal slats, a dihedral-shaped hood and vertically stacked twin-projector headlights. The sides of the STS are devoid of decoration. LED taillamps contain indirect optics to provide a more even lighting pattern.\n\nBody-panel gaps promise close tolerances. Either 17- or 18-inch wheels can be installed.\n\nInterior\nFive occupants get to enjoy soft all-leather seats. Offerings include heated and ventilated seating and a heated steering wheel. The STS features genuine eucalyptus wood and aluminum trim.\n\nEight-way power front seats include four-way power lumbar adjustment, and a memory feature is optional. Trunk space totals 13.8 cubic feet.\n\nOptions include Bose 5.1 Studio Surround Sound and a DVD/CD changer that can play DVD audio discs as well as MP3 CDs. A DVD-based navigation system is available. General Motors’ OnStar communication system includes automatic crash notification.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe 3.6-liter V-6 produces 254 hp and 252 pounds-feet of torque; it teams with a five-speed automatic transmission. Cadillac’s 4.6-liter Northstar V-8 generates 320 hp and 315 pounds-feet of torque. It runs through a six-speed automatic. Both transmissions include a manual-shift feature.\n\nSafety\nSix airbags, including front-seat side-impact and side curtain airbags, are standard. All-disc antilock brakes include brake assist. GM’s StabiliTrak electronic stability system is also standard.\n\nDriving Impressions\nCadillac’s Seville was known for years as a potent road car. The STS builds solidly upon that reputation, adding a stylish exterior and ample technology.\n\nSmooth-riding and well-controlled on good pavement, the STS isn’t especially troublesome on rougher patches, either. The sedan steers with a light feel, comports itself neatly on wet pavement and yields confident sensations.\n\nUnfortunately, the ride seems worse with Magnetic Ride Control. When rolling through broken or lumpy pavement, the model equipped with all-wheel drive felt less confident.\n\nSTS-V\nA performance-oriented V edition of the STS went on sale as a 2006 model. Equipped with a supercharged 4.4-liter V-8 that produces 469 hp at 6,400 rpm and 439 pounds-feet of torque at 3,800 rpm, the STS-V can accelerate from zero to 60 mph in less than 5 seconds. The supercharged Northstar engine teams with a new six-speed automatic transmission. Cadillac says that during shifts, power is instantly lowered and then carefully ramped back up, making gear changes virtually unnoticed.\n\nSpecial STS-V design touches include a larger, polished stainless-steel wire-mesh grille; a lower front fascia that contains a bigger grille; brake-cooling ducts; and a splitter to counteract lift. Rocker panels are lower than usual, and the special sculpted hood allows space for the engine’s supercharger. The STS-V features 10-spoke, painted, aluminum-alloy wheels. Features inside include hand-wrapped leather surfaces, Olive Ash Burl wood appointments and suede fabric seat inserts. Back to top",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in August 2007 about the 2008 Cadillac STS. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s changed for 2009, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nWith its exterior, feature and engine upgrades, the 2008 Cadillac STS may make some car buyers think this midsize sedan is one of the automaker’s latest and greatest — something in the vein of the redesigned CTS sedan or Escalade SUV.\n\nThat could have been the case, were it not for the interior. This is the Cadillac of three or four years ago: weighty doors and cushy leather, but too many shoddy finishes and some embarrassingly confusing buttons. It’s a shame, because the driving experience reflects Cadillacs of today: capable yet comfortable. Your opinion will likely depend on what’s more important to you.\n\nThe STS is Cadillac’s midsize sedan; it competes with cars like the BMW 5 Series, Infiniti M and Lexus GS. All four offer rear- or all-wheel drive, V-6 or V-8 engines and price tags north of 40 large. Cadillac also sells the supercharged STS-V; it’s covered separately in the Cars.com Research section. I drove an STS V-6 with rear-wheel drive.\n\nWhat’s Changed\nUnified styling gets a lot of lip service these days, but few carmakers have managed to craft an entire lineup as cohesive as Cadillac has. Of late, the look has evolved to include more substance and fewer angles for the sake of angles. The STS follows suit, with a two-tone grille that matches the narrower air dam below. New side portals sit behind the front fenders, and there’s a monotone bumper in back.\n\nSeventeen-inch alloy wheels are standard, and 18-inchers are optional. The window sills and rocker panels have subtle chrome strips. Those who want to be seen should consider the STS Platinum Edition, which dresses the wheels, door handles and grille in bright chrome.\n\nUnder the hood, the STS has GM’s direct-injection 3.6-liter V-6. The engine delivers 302 horsepower, which is 47 hp more than last year’s port-injected V-6. A 320-hp Northstar V-8 is also available. The engines’ reported 18-hp difference is likely even less in reality, as the V-8 has not been certified under the industry’s latest engineering standards, which tend to result in slightly lower numbers. Both engines use a six-speed automatic transmission.\n\nGas mileage is on par with the competition. Note, however, that the V-6 runs fine on regular gas; all major competitors recommend premium gas.\n\nDrivetrains Compared\n \tV-6\tV-8\nSize\t3.6 liters\t4.6 liters\nHorsepower (@ rpm)\t302 @ 6,300\t320 @ 6,400*\nTorque (lbs.-ft. @ rpm)\t272 @ 5,200\t315 @ 4,400*\nTransmission\tSix-speed auto\tSix-speed auto\nEPA fuel economy (city/highway, mpg)\t17/26 (RWD or AWD)\t15/24 (14/21 w/AWD)\nRecommended fuel\tRegular (87 octane)\tPremium (91 octane)\n*Certified under old SAE rating system.\nSource: EPA, automaker data\n\nThe V-6 proves remarkably versatile. It delivers enough low-end grunt for crisp acceleration from a standing start, and things get fairly potent later on. Power builds in a linear fashion — there is more as you rev, but it doesn’t peak all at once. The transmission moves things along, though it isn’t the most responsive one out there; I noticed some clunky shifts at lower speeds. There is a manual-shift mode, but like most it takes a moment or two to induce a shift. Should the computer think the car needs a downshift, it’s quick to override any actions to the contrary.\n\nI haven’t driven the V-8, but you might consider a test-drive to compare highway acceleration. The V-6 proves expedient enough at 60-to-70 mph passing, but the automatic can take a second or so to find the right gear when downshifting, and the engine doesn’t muster enough low-end power to muscle its way through the hesitation. With more torque at lower rpms, the V-8 might handle such situations better.\n\nThe standard four-wheel-independent suspension can incorporate GM’s Magnetic Ride Control. The system uses liquid-filled shock absorbers at the rear wheels that continuously adjust firmness to changing road conditions. It comes with the optional Performance Package, which also adds larger rear stabilizer bars on rear-wheel-drive models.\n\nReal-time suspension damping is designed to enhance handling without sacrificing ride comfort, and as such, it’s growing more popular in luxury cars. With the Performance Package, my test car felt relaxed on straightaways and agile in corners. On the highway, the suspension helps preserve high-speed stability and relative silence in the cabin.\n\nBody roll is impressively low, which plays right into the spot-on steering. BMW and Infiniti fans may find the Cadillac turns with too light a touch, but few will take issue with its precision. Dial the wheel into a corner, prod the gas and off you go — no need to worry about sloppy steering response or body roll. Note that my car had the optional high-precision ZF steering system. The standard rack-and-pinion setup might prove a bit lazier.\n\nPush the STS hard, and the chassis tends to understeer. It does so predictably, plowing wider as you turn harder but never feeling out of control. The rear wheels come out to play eventually, but only under the most aggressive conditions. Lateral bumps induce remarkably little wheel hop, making it easy to correct course over even the most riddled pavement.\n\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes are standard. The Performance Package adds Brembo four-piston calipers and enormous 14-inch discs — on paper, the sort of hardware you’d see on a Jaguar XJR or Mercedes S600. I never had the opportunity to slam them hard (a good thing, perhaps) but in normal situations, they proved as powerful as anything I’ve tested recently.\n\nWhat’s Stayed the Same\nStop here, and Cadillac has a real winner. Unfortunately, the STS falls short inside. It’s comfortable and lined with respectable materials, but the execution leaves a lot to be desired. Most of the flaws could have been fixed with a modest freshening, something on par with what the outside received. No such luck.\n\nThe front seats have plenty of range for different-sized drivers, and the leather upholstery is both supportive and well-cushioned. I’m 6 feet tall, and I had just enough headroom in back. Rear-seat legroom is ample, and should someone up front need to scoot all the way back, the front seatbacks have cutouts to give your knees an inch or so more room.\n\nThe dashboard and center controls sport the same edgy contours that characterize the outside. Most surfaces are trimmed in soft-touch materials, and the wood and metal inlays integrate well with their surroundings. An optional Bose 5.1 surround-sound stereo boasts 15 speakers, including two in each front seat. It sounds terrific.\n\nLook closely, however, and rough edges start to show: The overhead map lights click on and off with a hollow echo, and the power window switches look awfully down-market. The cruise controls are crowded onto the turn-signal stalk, an old GM trick that it needs to stop doing. Worst of all, my test car had gaps between the center panel and glove compartment that you could fit a nickel into.\n\nThe center controls are the same story: small dials, mismatched buttons and convoluted displays. I’ll save my rants for the picture captions — check out the thumbnails for the navigation system and center controls. Suffice it to say Cadillac has largely moved well beyond this grade of interior quality, and it’s time the STS caught up.\n\nTrunk volume measures 13.8 cubic feet, which is at the low end for this segment. The short deck lid makes for a rather small luggage opening.\n\nSafety\nAs of this writing, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has not crash tested the 2008 STS. Standard safety features include six airbags, four-wheel-disc antilock brakes, traction control and an electronic stability system. On all-wheel-drive V-8 models, the stability system incorporates an active steering mechanism that can steer the STS out of a skid.\n\nAdaptive cruise control, which adjusts the car’s speed depending on the distance to the car ahead, is optional. So is a head-up display, which aims to keep your eyes on the road by projecting a readout with vehicle speed and other essential details onto the windshield.\n\nIf you forget to turn off your high beams when approaching other drivers, an Intellibeam feature will do so automatically. It’s included with the optional xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights. Note that when flashed momentarily, the high-beams stay on for half a second. That makes it impossible to flash them two or three times in rapid succession, a tactic some drivers — including me — use in certain situations to alert others to their presence. Cadillac spokesman David Caldwell says he hasn’t heard of any complaints about it from STS owners.\n\nParents should note that the rear seat has two Latch child-seat anchors for each position. Most cars have anchors only for the outboard positions. In the STS, up to three seats can be installed; if you’re traveling with one kid, the seat can easily latch into the center position, which is the safest spot. There are top-tether anchors for all three positions on the backseat shelf.\n\nTwo other safety options deserve discussion. One is a new Side Blind Zone Alert System, which warns drivers of cars lurking in adjacent lanes. Starting at the side mirrors, the system scans an area roughly 11 feet out and 16 feet back. If there’s a car in that zone, a small orange icon illuminates in the mirror (check out the “Blind Spot” photo to see). It isn’t as immediately noticeable as a similar system from Volvo, which illuminates a light at the base of the A-pillar, but it attracts enough attention.\n\nThe feature represents the last line of defense against potential collisions, and is not a green light for willful lane-changing. In practice, the warning icon stayed illuminated from the time cars approached the side mirror to the moment after they emerged into my peripheral vision. One editor found the system didn’t light up until the cars were plainly in his view, so its effectiveness could depend on where you position your mirrors.\n\nThe system picks up faster cars as they pass, but it isn’t designed to detect slower cars as you pass them. That’s unfortunate — slower traffic may pose less risk, but it still represents a potential hazard should you need to swerve suddenly. It’s also designed to ignore parked cars and inanimate objects. It did not always do so: In the parking garage near our Chicago offices, the light sometimes stayed on past entire rows of cars. In at least two other instances, a vehicle directly behind me with its lights on triggered the warning.\n\nThe second option is a Lane Departure Warning System, which uses a small camera mounted at the top of the windshield to scan the road for lane markings. It works similarly to a system from Infiniti, sounding a quick succession of beeps should you wander near the lane’s edge. The feature engages at around 35 mph, and it won’t beep if your turn signal is activated.\n\nThe Cadillac system works well, sounding beeps from the left or right of the cabin depending on which way the STS is drifting. I drove over plenty of diagonal ruts and old lane markings, and the system never sounded a false alarm. The same can’t be said of Infiniti’s system.\n\nThe blind-spot alert, lane departure warning and head-up display comprise a $1,290 Driver Awareness Package. If you find them intrusive, all three can be turned off.\n\nFeatures & Pricing\nWithout the destination charge, prices range from $42,390 for the V-6 to $51,810 for the V-8. All-wheel drive costs $1,900 on the V-6 and $1,550 on the V-8. Load a V-8 STS with options, and the bottom line can run just over $70,000.\n\nStandard features include leather upholstery, a power-adjustable steering wheel, sonar rear parking assist, power front seats, dual-zone automatic climate control, a keyless access system and an eight-speaker CD stereo. Heated and cooled seats, a heated steering wheel, Bose premium sound, a moonroof, a navigation system and the high-tech safety features outlined above are optional. Two items common in this class, a rear backup camera and an auxiliary jack for MP3 players, are unavailable.\n\nSTS in the Market\nI suspect a lot of Cadillac buyers spend more time luxuriating in their cars than driving them hard. If those buyers are looking for value, the STS may prove to be the right choice. Factor in the starting price, gas mileage and GM’s impressive 10-year warranty, and the car undercuts most of its competitors — especially if Cadillac dishes out its usual sales incentives. In that case, a bare-bones version may be just what a buyer looking to stretch a $35,000 budget is looking for — compared to sedans in that price range, the interior might not seem so fatally flawed. Luxury lovers who can afford a genuine $50,000 car, however, will find better choices elsewhere.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "With its exterior, feature and engine upgrades, the 2008 Cadillac STS may make some car buyers think this midsize sedan is one of the automaker’s latest and greatest — something in the vein of the redesigned CTS sedan or Escalade SUV.\n\nThat could have been the case, were it not for the interior. This is the Cadillac of three or four years ago: weighty doors and cushy leather, but too many shoddy finishes and some embarrassingly confusing buttons. It’s a shame, because the driving experience reflects Cadillacs of today: capable yet comfortable. Your opinion will likely depend on what’s more important to you.\n\nThe STS is Cadillac’s midsize sedan; it competes with cars like the BMW 5 Series, Infiniti M and Lexus GS. All four offer rear- or all-wheel drive, V-6 or V-8 engines and price tags north of 40 large. Cadillac also sells the supercharged STS-V; it’s covered separately in the Cars.com Research section. I drove an STS V-6 with rear-wheel drive.\n\nWhat’s Changed\nUnified styling gets a lot of lip service these days, but few carmakers have managed to craft an entire lineup as cohesive as Cadillac has. Of late, the look has evolved to include more substance and fewer angles for the sake of angles. The STS follows suit, with a two-tone grille that matches the narrower air dam below. New side portals sit behind the front fenders, and there’s a monotone bumper in back.\n\nSeventeen-inch alloy wheels are standard, and 18-inchers are optional. The window sills and rocker panels have subtle chrome strips. Those who want to be seen should consider the STS Platinum Edition, which dresses the wheels, door handles and grille in bright chrome.\n\nUnder the hood, the STS has GM’s direct-injection 3.6-liter V-6. The engine delivers 302 horsepower, which is 47 hp more than last year’s port-injected V-6. A 320-hp Northstar V-8 is also available. The engines’ reported 18-hp difference is likely even less in reality, as the V-8 has not been certified under the industry’s latest engineering standards, which tend to result in slightly lower numbers. Both engines use a six-speed automatic transmission.\n\nGas mileage is on par with the competition. Note, however, that the V-6 runs fine on regular gas; all major competitors recommend premium gas.\n\nDrivetrains Compared\n\tV-6\tV-8\nSize\t3.6 liters\t4.6 liters\nHorsepower (@ rpm)\t302 @ 6,300\t320 @ 6,400*\nTorque (lbs.-ft. @ rpm)\t272 @ 5,200\t315 @ 4,400*\nTransmission\tSix-speed auto\tSix-speed auto\nEPA fuel economy (city/highway, mpg)\t17/26 (RWD or AWD)\t15/24 (14/21 w/AWD)\nRecommended fuel\tRegular (87 octane)\tPremium (91 octane)\n*Certified under old SAE rating system.\nSource: EPA, automaker data\n\nThe V-6 proves remarkably versatile. It delivers enough low-end grunt for crisp acceleration from a standing start, and things get fairly potent later on. Power builds in a linear fashion — there is more as you rev, but it doesn’t peak all at once. The transmission moves things along, though it isn’t the most responsive one out there; I noticed some clunky shifts at lower speeds. There is a manual-shift mode, but like most it takes a moment or two to induce a shift. Should the computer think the car needs a downshift, it’s quick to override any actions to the contrary.\n\nI haven’t driven the V-8, but you might consider a test-drive to compare highway acceleration. The V-6 proves expedient enough at 60-to-70 mph passing, but the automatic can take a second or so to find the right gear when downshifting, and the engine doesn’t muster enough low-end power to muscle its way through the hesitation. With more torque at lower rpms, the V-8 might handle such situations better.\n\nThe standard four-wheel-independent suspension can incorporate GM’s Magnetic Ride Control. The system uses liquid-filled shock absorbers at the rear wheels that continuously adjust firmness to changing road conditions. It comes with the optional Performance Package, which also adds larger rear stabilizer bars on rear-wheel-drive models.\n\nReal-time suspension damping is designed to enhance handling without sacrificing ride comfort, and as such, it’s growing more popular in luxury cars. With the Performance Package, my test car felt relaxed on straightaways and agile in corners. On the highway, the suspension helps preserve high-speed stability and relative silence in the cabin.\n\nBody roll is impressively low, which plays right into the spot-on steering. BMW and Infiniti fans may find the Cadillac turns with too light a touch, but few will take issue with its precision. Dial the wheel into a corner, prod the gas and off you go — no need to worry about sloppy steering response or body roll. Note that my car had the optional high-precision ZF steering system. The standard rack-and-pinion setup might prove a bit lazier.\n\nPush the STS hard, and the chassis tends to understeer. It does so predictably, plowing wider as you turn harder but never feeling out of control. The rear wheels come out to play eventually, but only under the most aggressive conditions. Lateral bumps induce remarkably little wheel hop, making it easy to correct course over even the most riddled pavement.\n\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes are standard. The Performance Package adds Brembo four-piston calipers and enormous 14-inch discs — on paper, the sort of hardware you’d see on a Jaguar XJR or Mercedes S600. I never had the opportunity to slam them hard (a good thing, perhaps) but in normal situations, they proved as powerful as anything I’ve tested recently.\n\nWhat’s Stayed the Same\nStop here, and Cadillac has a real winner. Unfortunately, the STS falls short inside. It’s comfortable and lined with respectable materials, but the execution leaves a lot to be desired. Most of the flaws could have been fixed with a modest freshening, something on par with what the outside received. No such luck.\n\nThe front seats have plenty of range for different-sized drivers, and the leather upholstery is both supportive and well-cushioned. I’m 6 feet tall, and I had just enough headroom in back. Rear-seat legroom is ample, and should someone up front need to scoot all the way back, the front seatbacks have cutouts to give your knees an inch or so more room.\n\nThe dashboard and center controls sport the same edgy contours that characterize the outside. Most surfaces are trimmed in soft-touch materials, and the wood and metal inlays integrate well with their surroundings. An optional Bose 5.1 surround-sound stereo boasts 15 speakers, including two in each front seat. It sounds terrific.\n\nLook closely, however, and rough edges start to show: The overhead map lights click on and off with a hollow echo, and the power window switches look awfully down-market. The cruise controls are crowded onto the turn-signal stalk, an old GM trick that it needs to stop doing. Worst of all, my test car had gaps between the center panel and glove compartment that you could fit a nickel into.\n\nThe center controls are the same story: small dials, mismatched buttons and convoluted displays. I’ll save my rants for the picture captions — check out the thumbnails for the navigation system and center controls. Suffice it to say Cadillac has largely moved well beyond this grade of interior quality, and it’s time the STS caught up.\n\nTrunk volume measures 13.8 cubic feet, which is at the low end for this segment. The short deck lid makes for a rather small luggage opening.\n\nSafety\nAs of this writing, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has not crash tested the 2008 STS. Standard safety features include six airbags, four-wheel-disc antilock brakes, traction control and an electronic stability system. On all-wheel-drive V-8 models, the stability system incorporates an active steering mechanism that can steer the STS out of a skid.\n\nAdaptive cruise control, which adjusts the car’s speed depending on the distance to the car ahead, is optional. So is a head-up display, which aims to keep your eyes on the road by projecting a readout with vehicle speed and other essential details onto the windshield.\n\nIf you forget to turn off your high beams when approaching other drivers, an Intellibeam feature will do so automatically. It’s included with the optional xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights. Note that when flashed momentarily, the high-beams stay on for half a second. That makes it impossible to flash them two or three times in rapid succession, a tactic some drivers — including me — use in certain situations to alert others to their presence. Cadillac spokesman David Caldwell says he hasn’t heard of any complaints about it from STS owners.\n\nParents should note that the rear seat has two Latch child-seat anchors for each position. Most cars have anchors only for the outboard positions. In the STS, up to three seats can be installed; if you’re traveling with one kid, the seat can easily latch into the center position, which is the safest spot. There are top-tether anchors for all three positions on the backseat shelf.\n\nTwo other safety options deserve discussion. One is a new Side Blind Zone Alert System, which warns drivers of cars lurking in adjacent lanes. Starting at the side mirrors, the system scans an area roughly 11 feet out and 16 feet back. If there’s a car in that zone, a small orange icon illuminates in the mirror (check out the “Blind Spot” photo to see). It isn’t as immediately noticeable as a similar system from Volvo, which illuminates a light at the base of the A-pillar, but it attracts enough attention.\n\nThe feature represents the last line of defense against potential collisions, and is not a green light for willful lane-changing. In practice, the warning icon stayed illuminated from the time cars approached the side mirror to the moment after they emerged into my peripheral vision. One editor found the system didn’t light up until the cars were plainly in his view, so its effectiveness could depend on where you position your mirrors.\n\nThe system picks up faster cars as they pass, but it isn’t designed to detect slower cars as you pass them. That’s unfortunate — slower traffic may pose less risk, but it still represents a potential hazard should you need to swerve suddenly. It’s also designed to ignore parked cars and inanimate objects. It did not always do so: In the parking garage near our Chicago offices, the light sometimes stayed on past entire rows of cars. In at least two other instances, a vehicle directly behind me with its lights on triggered the warning.\n\nThe second option is a Lane Departure Warning System, which uses a small camera mounted at the top of the windshield to scan the road for lane markings. It works similarly to a system from Infiniti, sounding a quick succession of beeps should you wander near the lane’s edge. The feature engages at around 35 mph, and it won’t beep if your turn signal is activated.\n\nThe Cadillac system works well, sounding beeps from the left or right of the cabin depending on which way the STS is drifting. I drove over plenty of diagonal ruts and old lane markings, and the system never sounded a false alarm. The same can’t be said of Infiniti’s system.\n\nThe blind-spot alert, lane departure warning and head-up display comprise a $1,290 Driver Awareness Package. If you find them intrusive, all three can be turned off.\n\nFeatures & Pricing\nWithout the destination charge, prices range from $42,390 for the V-6 to $51,810 for the V-8. All-wheel drive costs $1,900 on the V-6 and $1,550 on the V-8. Load a V-8 STS with options, and the bottom line can run just over $70,000.\n\nStandard features include leather upholstery, a power-adjustable steering wheel, sonar rear parking assist, power front seats, dual-zone automatic climate control, a keyless access system and an eight-speaker CD stereo. Heated and cooled seats, a heated steering wheel, Bose premium sound, a moonroof, a navigation system and the high-tech safety features outlined above are optional. Two items common in this class, a rear backup camera and an auxiliary jack for MP3 players, are unavailable.\n\nSTS in the Market\nI suspect a lot of Cadillac buyers spend more time luxuriating in their cars than driving them hard. If those buyers are looking for value, the STS may prove to be the right choice. Factor in the starting price, gas mileage and GM’s impressive 10-year warranty, and the car undercuts most of its competitors — especially if Cadillac dishes out its usual sales incentives. In that case, a bare-bones version may be just what a buyer looking to stretch a $35,000 budget is looking for — compared to sedans in that price range, the interior might not seem so fatally flawed. Luxury lovers who can afford a genuine $50,000 car, however, will find better choices elsewhere.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",
