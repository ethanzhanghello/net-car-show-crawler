      "expert_review": "German automotive pioneer Ferdinand Porsche was a man who marched to his own beat.\n\nHe never was much of a believer in putting the engine at one end of the car and the driving effort at the other. And when he designed the Auto Union race cars and Volkswagen passenger car, he combined the engine and drive system at the back.\n\nThis is the same principle embraced by the new 1995 Porsche Carrera Coupe, a fitting tribute to Porsche’s work.\n\nThe 911, with its flat (opposed) six-cylinder engine mounted behind the rear driving wheels, is the model most associated with the Porsche name. And its general styling has been a Porsche trademark for the past 30 years.\n\nWith the 1995 Carrera, the body retains the overall traditional 911 shape, but with more flowing, rounded lines.\n\nEllipsoid headlights are integrated into the fender shape. Rear quarter windows and the rear window are flush-mounted. Functional air outlets are ahead of the front wheels.\n\nThe center brake lights have been redesigned. And improved aerodynamics contribute to a myriad of styling revisions.\n\nThe 911 has always been manufactured with the driving enthusiast in mind, and Porsche has upgraded the 1995 Carrera with more power; a new, standard six-speed manual transmission; more offset for the front and rear wheels; wider standard rear tires; larger front brake discs; and a new Bosch ABS 5 anti-lock brake system.\n\nWith all this in hand, you can really go. And go is what we did with the 911 coupe that Porsche’s Barbara Manha provided for a test car.\n\nA first encounter with one of these rockets dictates a few miles of driving to make the mechanicals user-friendly. Things go much better with a moderately light touch, and determining what the car likes and doesn’t like.\n\nThe transmission was the six-speed manual rather than Porsche’s Tiptronic automatic. With 270 horsepower in hand, a gain of 23 horses over the 1994 car, the coupe wasn’t an automobile you could drive in an absent-minded fashion.\n\nIt took a balance between engine speed and a sensitive clutch to pull away smoothly from a standing start. But once under way, just point the thing.\n\n.Zero to 60 miles an hour comes in at 5.4 seconds, fractionally quicker than the 1994 coupe. The rated top speed at 168 mph is a full 6 mph faster than the 1994.\n\nThe engine still is Porsche’s air-cooled 3.6-liter (220-cubic-inch) flat-6, but with more torque, hydraulic valve lifters, a lighter valve train and a new free-flow exhaust system, it accelerates right now. And as you go faster, an electronically controlled rear spoiler generates more down force.\n\nDuring conventional motoring modes, you develop varying shift patterns with the six-speed gearbox. You never use all six speeds, with sixth in fact being sort of an autobahn gear. For urban and suburban motoring, you’ll fall into patterns of 1-2-4, or 2-4, or 2-3-5, depending on traffic conditions.\n\nClutch effort leaned a little toward the heavy side. It also was necessary to put the pedal all the way down to avoid hanging up the gears during a shift. But once this became an automatic habit, the transmission would shift as smoothly as anything you would want.\n\nThe test car was equipped with optional 17-inch alloy wheels and tires, and this raised the steering effort a bit when going slow. However, the wide rubber gripped the road like they were suction cups, and you can go through high-speed corners like there’s no tomorrow.\n\nPorsche is, and always was, a rather expensive automobile. And even though the 1995 911 is several thousand dollars less than the 1994, you’re still looking at the north side of $60,000. As a consequence, all the accouterments expected in a luxury automobile were found in the coupe.\n\nEntrance and exit require a minor degree of acrobatics, standard fare in a sports car. But once inside, driver and passenger room is quite comfortable.\n\nThe test carhad what is known as 2-plus-2 seating, meaning there’s a back seat. But rear seating is ma inly for children, preferably small ones.\n\nPorsche could help itself on its instrumentation if the gauges had a white background with black numbers, rather than the other way around. Shadows develop driving into the sun, and it fades the readability of the dials.\n\nFor reasons known only to the Germans, the ignition switch is on the left side of the steering post. That’s great for left-handed drivers, but a little awkward for the rest of us.\n\nAnd if it wasn’t for a light on the ignition key, the switch would be almost impossible to find in the dark.\n\nPorsche’s 1995 911 Carrera carries forward the Teutonic zest for quality and engineering in a sports car that appeals to a highly personalized market.\n\nThe new 911 furthers the aura of being in a class by itself. And it almost takes another Porsche to reside in that lofty atmosphere.\n\n1995 Porsche 911 CarreraBase price: $59,990.

      "expert_review": "The sleek and fast 2006 Porsche 911 C4 sitting in my yard presented an incongruous picture:\n\nIt was, like the yard, cloaked in snow. So were all roads leading to civilization.\n\nBeneath all the white was the beauty and utility of this repeat winner of New England Motor Press Association awards for its winter behavior: The ”4″ after the ”C” stands for how many wheels get power when needed. That means all of them, and that means snow is no problem.\n\nThat’s an unusual quality in the world of high-performance cars.\n\nIn this often slippery, slick, and snowbound corner of the world, those who prefer their cars to be shaken and stirred at high r.p.m. (but hold the ice) must usually make a seasonal compromise: Can I afford this ride for summer while making payments on another vehicle for winter?\n\nThe C4 — so named because power can be delivered to all four wheels — displayed its prowess in climbing snaking hills coated with a couple of inches of snow. The car also features Porsche Stability Management, which combines traction and skid control.\n\nWith the C4 — in its base and S versions — you need not make that choice, unless you feel the need to travel unplowed roads deep with snow, and thus run into clearance problems.\n\nBut yes, this can be your daily, year-round commuter car.\n\nIf any Porsche is best viewed from behind the wheel — eyes gazing over five escalloped gauges and a three-spoke steering wheel out to bulging front fenders — then the second-best view of the C4 is from the rear.\n\nThat is because it is nearly two inches wider than the 911 C2, and the extra inch at each wing gives it a fierceness that promises lots of grunt where its wide tires meet the road.\n\nSome purists will argue that a Porsche without rear-wheel drive is not a classic Porsche. Hogwash. Given the way viscous couplings have replaced mechanical links in AWD systems, and considering the easy flow of power between front and rear when needed, the C4 virtually proves you can have your rear-wheel drive and your AWD, too.\n\nThat is because, under normal operation, 95 percent of the torque goes to the rear wheels. And it’s possible to induce the rear-end twitch that signals throttle steer. Push it very hard and the redistribution of power is invisible — but there’s a sense that help, fore and aft if you need it — is on the way.\n\nA few spins in a snowy, empty parking lot resulted in the rear tires kicking up snow, and then, as the arcs intensified, all four wheels shooting snow.\n\nIt was a fitting illustration of the same physics that could occur even on dry pavement. The C4 also displayed its prowess in climbing snaking New Hampshire hills coated with a couple of inches of snow.\n\nAiding the precise, on-center control was Porsche Stability Management, which combines traction and skid control and uses throttle and ABS at its heart. The new PSM system also detects sudden lifts of the gas pedal and, assuming that means emergency braking is about to begin, gently boosts the brake system’s hydraulics, so that the pads are lightly touching the rotors even before the driver’s foot hits the pedal. Strike the brake hard and an assist system speeds the brakes to full power milliseconds before the pedal travels to the floor.\n\nAnd these brakes are gripping discs more than a foot wide, front and rear.\n\nWhich is a good thing, since you are stopping a car powered by a 3.6-liter boxer-6 engine with 325 horsepower. (The upgraded C4 S model comes with 355 horsepower and a price tag that starts at about $10,000 over the C4’s $77,000 base.)\n\nTransmission options include a six-speed manual (as tested) or a five-speed Tiptronic S. The manual is so tight and quick, and the Tiptronic so futuristic and faster, that I can’t decide which one I prefer.\n\nBut living in New England, I know that I prefer my vehicles to have all-wheel drive. An all-wheel drive high-performance car is just frosting on the frost.\n\nRoyal Ford can be reached at ford@globe.com.",

      "expert_review": "It’s easy to see where Porsche spent most of its money a few years ago when the German sports car maker redid the 911.\n\nThe boys down in engineering walked away with most of the loot. The interior decorators apparently didn’t have much to work with.\n\nBut that’s OK.\n\nI can point out plenty of reasons why the 911 is crude. But they are all wiped out by the fact that the car is terrific fun to drive.\n\nYes, it would be nice if the seats were more comfortable, if the radio were easier to operate, if any person, even a child, could fit in the back seat and if the ignition switch were on the proper side of the dash, not planted off to the left.\n\nBut as soon as the turbinelike whoosh of the engine enters your eardrums and as soon as the world begins to pass by in a blur, none of that matters.\n\nThis car looks great and makes you feel great.\n\nApparently, Porsche still thinks that drivers and their guests should suffer a bit. How old school.\n\nBut Porsche may be the only automaker in the world that can still get away with such a thing. Perhaps the next 911 will offer a more user-friendly interior.\n\nPerformance, handling\n\nWhen Porsche revamped the 911 two years ago, the German automaker said goodbye to the company’s long-running and famous air-cooled engine. Though the layout of the new engine remains the same — the cylinders are horizontally opposed — the cooling is now done the traditional way, with water.\n\nThat seems to make everything work better.\n\nThe new 911 isn’t bothered by long waits in broiling traffic jams. As I recall, the old 911 could get a little cranky when traffic came to a crawl on a hot summer day. The car would run a bit rough, and the air conditioner wouldn’t blow very cold. All that is gone now. The engine purrs all the time, and the air conditioner blows cold no matter what speed the car is moving.\n\nOur test car sported Porsche’s all-wheel drive system. The added weight of the front-drive components didn’t seem to hinder performance much. Porsche says the car can reach 60 mph in 5.2 seconds, and I believe it.\n\nThe engine delivers a solid kick of power, but when the tachometer needle passes 5,000 rpm, the pitch of the exhaust changes from a howl to a mean growl. Our test car seemed to run better the harder I drove it.\n\nThe six-speed manual transmission took a bit of getting used to, however. The clutch is very direct. It’s either in or out — there’s very little middle ground. This makes moving from a stop a bit tricky. But the shifter clicked smoothly into each gear. And you can shift as quickly as needed.\n\nBecause the 911 has such a short wheelbase, the ride is a bit choppy over bumps. But when it comes to rounding a corner, the 911 seems attached to the road in the manner of a high-speed roller coaster. It just never comes unbalanced.\n\nAnd therein lies the beauty of the machine. With the engine making its wonderful symphony in the rear, yo u come to anticipate and relish those moments when you can push the car through a fast curve.\n\nThe gigantic, vented, four-wheel disc brakes — outfitted with an anti-lock system, of course — are very strong. The rack-and-pinion steering is razor sharp. Technically, the 911 Carrera 4 is an excellent sports car.\n\nFit and finish\n\nIn one respect, the 911 Carrera 4 reminds me of the 1976 Triumph TR6 I once owned and loved.\n\nThat car was uncomfortable to the nth degree. But its looks were intoxicating — so much so that the compliments it drew kept me behind the wheel long after I knew it was time for it to go.\n\nThe 911, I’m sorry to report, hasn’t progressed as much inside as it has underneath.\n\nThe upper part of the driver’s seat is too narrow and constantly squeezes your sides. I never could adjust the seat so that I was comfortable enough that I didn’t think about it when driving. The back seats are virtually unuseable. It’s better jus t to fold them forward and forget they are there.\n\nAs with the Boxster, the gauge cluster looks tacked on to the top of the dash. Those big gauges, however, are nicely designed and easy to read. Interestingly, you get two readouts for the speedometer — one on the speedometer gauge, the other on the bottom of the tachometer, as a digital readout. Now, you really have no excuse for speeding.\n\nThe air conditioner is controlled by a series of buttons that show you on a bar graph how fast the fan is blowing. The temperature readout is given in numbers. The system is fairly easy to use. But in such an expensive car, it would be nice to have the controls for the air conditioner and radio on the steering wheel.\n\nOther demerits must be handed out for the metal inserts on the shifter and the emergency brake, which get so hot during the summer that they can nearly burn your hands, and for the quirky radio, which is hard to tune.\n\nAll these things, I suppose, add to the Porsche’s aura. You don’t get mad at the quirks and the lack of comfort. You deal with them — because when you turn the key and head out into the world, you are driving a very special car.\n\n1999 Porsche 911 Carrera 4\n\nBase price: $70,480. Safety: Dual front and side air bags, traction control and anti-lock brakes. Price as tested: $82,515. EPA rating: 17 mpg city/24 mpg highway. Incentives: None.",

      "expert_review": "Some cars are theater. Their use requires proper staging. Such is the case with the new Porsche 911 Carrera 4.\n This is no ordinary car; nor is it an ordinary Porsche. It comes with four-wheel drive and two rear seats that actually are usable, at least for small people.\n Equipped with a two-in-one Tiptronic S transmission–an automatic that doubles as a manual–it can be driven as a daily urban commuter or as a long-distance runner. And should you and your insurer think it wise, you can take it to    the local racetrack for a thrilling spin.\n But that is not what I mean by staging. Porsches in general, and the 911 Carrera 4 in particular, are works of art. They are four-wheeled dance, high-powered music, automotive poetry. To thoroughly enjoy them, to feel their essence, you must take them out of the context of ordinary motoring.\n How to do this?\n You need music, of course–and a different road.\n I chose B.B. King’s “Blues on the Bayou” and “Why I Sing the Blues.” My roads weren’t           different–I’m addicted to the perennial beauty of Virginia’s Shenandoah Valley. My driving time was different, however.\n It was dawn Saturday, mid-September, a time of waning summer and rising fall. Hurricane Floyd was terrorizing the Florida coast,   but the Virginia air was crisp and bright. There was little traffic.\n The car was absent a six-speed manual transmission, the preferred gearbox of Porsche purists. But I was never much for purity. The five-speed Tiptronic S in the test car suited me    just fine. To the extent that I actually needed more control over gearing, on downhill curves and in sharp turns, the rocker-type manual-mode switches atop the 911 Carrera 4’s steering wheel proved sufficient.\n There being no wet highways on which to   try out the car’s four-wheel-drive system, I hunted for less-adhesive surfaces and found them on a variety of dirt and gravel-covered back roads, which also provided perfect scenery for B.B. King’s music.\n What fun! Drive power shifted from wheel to    wheel, compensating for slippage with grippage, helping to keep the car perfectly under control, despite flying dust and gravel. Porsche’s “four-wheel drive” really is a sophisticated version of permanent all-wheel drive. It employs a multi-plate, viscous clutch that transmits power from the rear-drive system to the front axle, depending on which wheels are slipping most.\n That technology, combined with Porsche’s “stability management” system (think of a super anti-lock braking system), turned the drive into a modern dance, complete with rhythm, funk and exciting moves. There is just something about a perfectly balanced body in motion that pumps you up, gets you going. To be a part of that body, as in the case of driver behind wheel, simply sends the     spirit soaring!\n But the sun was rising. People were stirring, taking to the road for Saturday errands and weekend recreation. However, the pleasure of a theater is diminished by the number of people in the a                                             udience, particularly if they are given to rudeness. It was time to go home.\n  2000 Porsche 911 Carrera 4 \n Complaint: My eldest daughter, Binta, put it best: “This car is a lot of fun, but it’s also a lot of frustration. There are very few places   in this country where you can enjoy it.”\n Praise: If you’re lucky enough to find those places, you’ll discover the meaning of pleasure, the joy of driving. There aren’t many cars that drive this well this easily. Fast, smooth, exceptionally well        balanced.\n Head-turning quotient: Bespeaks power. Some people like that. Others hate it. Not a car for shy or humble people.\n Ride, acceleration and handling: Triple aces. You’ll have to do something stunningly foolish to trip this one up.           Compensates for honest driving errors, such as accidental oversteering or slamming on the brakes at the apex of a curve.\n Brakes: Stops as confidently as it starts. Two-circuit brake system, with circuits subdivided individua lly per axle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Vented discs front and rear, with anti-lock standard. Porsche’s stability-management system is designed to shorten stopping distances and eliminate or reduce skidding during a variety of panic stops.\n Engine: 3.4-liter, 16-valve, water-cooled,          horizontally opposed aluminum six-cylinder engine designed to produce 300 horsepower at 6,800 rpm and 258 pound-feet of torque at 4,600 rpm.\n Capacities: Can hold two large and two small people (tiny folk in the rear). Skimpy, up-front luggage          capacity, 3.5 cubic feet. Fuel tank holds 14.8 gallons; premium unleaded required.\n Tires: Seventeen-inch, speed-rated radials standard; 18-inch tires optional.\n Mileage: Not much. Not a car for conservationists. About 12.4 miles per gallon in       city-highway driving. Estimated 168-mile range.\n Safety: Rigid construction, standard side air bags, lots of active safety devices (which keep you from crashing in the first place), such as the stability-management system.\n Price: “Base” price is    $73,900. Dealer invoice on “base” model is $63,961. Price as tested is $82,633, including $7,968 for active air spoiler system, and a $765 destination charge.\n Purse-strings note: How much would you pay for a Picasso original? How much does it cost to  put on a hit Braoadway play? I mean, get outta here.",

      "expert_review": "Porsche AG of Stuttgart, Germany, plays the numbers game for 1992, and those winning numbers are 968 and 911.\n\nThe Porsche 968 Coupe and Cabriolet, and the Porsche 911 America Roadster, are new models joining the automaker’s 1992 lineup.\n\nThe company is putting major emphasis on 968, giving the car a new body and some new mechanical features.\n\nThe 968 replaces Porsche’s 944 S2 model. The marketing game plan is to move 944 owners into the new car and attract owners of other makes.\n\n“I’m looking for pricing in the $45,000-to-$50,000 range,” said Britten Killinger, sales manager for Giganti Porsche. “So I believe going from a 944 to a 968 will be what I consider is a lateral move.\n\nThe 968 is influenced by three Porsche models — the 911, the 959, and the 928.\n\nIt’s distinctively Porsche whether approached from the front or the rear. Up front are large, round headlamps and an arrow-like hood profile. And in true Porsche tradition, the fenders rise above the hood line. To make it easier to guide this land-bound rocket at night, driving/fog lights are integrated into the front spoiler.\n\nA new integrated design consists of energy-absorbing front and rear bumpers. There are newly designed side-view mirrors, and new five-spoke Turbo-design wheels.\n\n“I think it’s a beautiful car,” Killinger said. “I think the lines are outstanding, and the color combinations will be extremely favorable for our market.”\n\nA Porsche doesn’t live by looks alone, and the 968 is rife with engineering features.\n\nThe top speed is rated at 156 miles per hour, a speed at which it is highly desirable to keep all four wheels firmly planted on the pavement. As a consequence, the coupe has been given near zero-lift aerodynamically. This is harder to do with the cabriolet, and running with the top down initiates all sorts of aerodynamic drag.\n\nEngine-wise, the power is all high-tech, with Porsche doing some interesting things with four cylinders.\n\nThere is the expected double-overhead cams and four valves per cylinder, parameters that follow the standard Speedway engine design configuration. What is not common is Porsche’s using 3.0 liters of displacement with but four cylinders.\n\nMost of the world’s auto manufactures go to a V-6 for a 3.0-liter engine. Not Porsche. It gives its 16-valve 4 a bore and stroke that virtually is the equivalent of the big rear-drive Cadillac Brougham’s V-8.\n\nThe bore on the Porsche 4 is 4.09 inches, and the stroke 3.46 inches. With the Caddy V-8, it’s 4 inches by 3.48 inches.\n\nThis translates into 236 horsepower and 225 foot-pounds of torque. And when this four-banger goes chuffa-chuffa-cuffa, you’d better have the car pointed in the direction you want to go by about that third chuffa.\n\nA definite contributor to the engine’s performance characteristics is Porsche’s Variocam electric/hydraulic variable valve timing system. The cams run a dual-lobe system for each valve, with the individual lobes having different valve lift characteristics. The electronic/ hydraulic actuation changes valve operation from one cam lobe to another depending on engine speed and load. That improves horsepower and torque and reduces emissions.\n\nReal drivers also are going to find in the 968 a manual transmission that will be near and dear to their hearts. New is a six-speed, close-ratio manual gearbox that puts 968 chauffeurs (transmission-wise) on a par with the Indy-car boys. However, Porsche also will offer its Tiptronic dual-function automatic transmission. You can shift this unit manually, or it will shift automatically.\n\n“I think you will find the car will appeal to the traditional Porsche buyers,” Killinger said. “And it’s going to attract owners of competing sports cars. I think you’ll also find that, because of the pricing, it will open the market up to other potential buyers.\n\n“We don’t know specifically what the price will be, butI’m glad to see they didn’t price it too high. I think they’re trying to keep it in li ne with the 944.”\n\nPorsche will announce set prices for the coupe and cabriolet when they become available on the American market in November. The company says it also will introduce its other new entry, the 911 America Roadster, at about the same time.\n\nThis model takes its name from the 1952 Porsche 356 America Roadster. It is a derivative of Porsche’s 911 series of models that use the company’s well-established 3.6-liter flat (opposed) six-cylinder engine. Unlike the 356, the new car offers modern amenities like power windows and a five-speed manual or Tiptronic transmission. Suspension and brakes come from Porsche’s 911 Turbo model.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The new generation of the 911 ups the car’s performance ceiling, and its effortless thrills spoil you — perhaps too much.\n\nVersus the competition: Though some competitors can keep up with the 911’s speed, none can match how it feels to drive the rear-engine Porsche.\n\nNew generations of the Porsche 911 bleed together thanks to the subtlety of the car’s stylistic evolution and a strict adherence to tradition the German automaker insists upon for its most iconic model. The 2020 Porsche 911 continues in this vein, serving as an introduction to the model’s eighth generation (called the 992 series). But to get stuck on the subtlety of the car’s surface changes would be to miss the litany of changes under the skin. The interior has been completely reshaped and a new engine delivers a big leap forward in performance.\n\nRelated: My 2020 Porsche 911 Fantasy Configuration\n\nThe easiest way to pick out a 992 is from the back, where the taillights now stretch across the entire width of the car. The bumpers and lower valence both front and rear are different, as well, adding more dimension to the 911’s styling and playing well against the smoothness of its sides. All told, these styling updates don’t add up to much — it’s still hard to pick out the new car unless you find it parked next to a previous-generation 991. Hop behind the wheel, however, and it will quickly become evident that it’s a very different beast.\n\nA weekend wedding in Charleston, S.C., provided a nice excuse to check out these changes up close. I flew into Atlanta to grab a new 911 Carrera S from Porsche’s North American headquarters and head east to the Atlantic. My route included a detour into the Chattahoochee-Oconee National Forest to let the car stretch its legs on some proper roads. Over the course of about 900 miles, I got to know the new 911 quite well and found a lot to love, along with one catch I didn’t see coming. (Per Cars.com’s ethics policy, Porsche provided only the car; the trip was mine.)\n\nThe 911 will initially come only in Carrera S and Carrera 4S (all-wheel-drive) coupe variants, with convertible versions of both to follow. Expect a slew of 911 variants to rain down over the next few years offering a wide range of performance (and price tags). My test vehicle was a rear-wheel-drive Carrera S with the Sport Chrono Package ($2,720) and rear-axle steering ($2,090).\n\nSome of the 911’s competitors include the new mid-engine 2020 Chevrolet Corvette and front-engine 2020 Jaguar F-Type and 2020 Mercedes-AMG GT.\n\n2020 Porsche 911 Carrera S | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\nRear Engine, Rear Drive\n\nTucked behind the seating area is the beating heart of the 911 Carrera S: a 443-horsepower, twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter boxer-six-cylinder that makes 390 pounds-feet of torque. It comes mated to an eight-speed dual-clutch automatic (PDK in Porsche-speak) transmission. A manual transmission of some kind will eventually be offered on the 911, but it’ll be automatic only at launch.\n\nThe new 911’s subtle exterior changes do a poor job hinting at the car’s performance gains. The new engine only bumps power up 23 hp and 22 pounds-feet of torque compared with the previous-generation Carrera S, but there’s a big difference between the two cars in sheer speed. Porsche says the new Carrera S will run from 0-60 mph in just 3.3 seconds (with the optional Sport Chrono Package), which is 0.4 second faster — a significant gap in the auto world.\n\nThe 911’s powertrain is an absolute delight. Its instant response to throttle inputs makes the engine feel like an extension of your foot as you drive. The copious acceleration and chorus of pops and hisses as you lift off the pedal provide sensory delights. PDK is still electronic wizardry of the best kind; if you trust the transmission, it does a great job picking the right gear for every situation. If you don’t, the paddle shifters rip off shifts in a blink.\n\nThe Sport Chrono Package feels like a must on this car. It adds launch control, a more aggressive Sport Plus driving mode and a Sport Response button on the steering wheel. This button sits in the middle of a dial that selects different drive modes, and pressing it induces 20 seconds of maximum responsiveness from the engine and transmission. It could alternatively be called the “oh sh*t” button, because that’s what all your passengers will say the first time you hit the button and then the gas. Driving the Carrera S makes me wonder what the rest of this 911 lineup has in store: Porsche says this car will end up being the second slowest variant of the group. The prospect of higher trim levels has me excited and scared at the same time.\n\nCars.com photo by Brian Wong\nNo More Drama in My Life\n\nThe 911 comes with a standard adaptive suspension that adjusts damping force at each wheel based on conditions and whether the suspension is in Normal or Sport mode. A sport suspension is also offered that lowers the car even more, and there’s an optional dynamic chassis control system that works to further suppress body roll when cornering.\n\nThe multiple suspension settings allow the 911 to excel as a luxury tourer, not just a sports car — albeit one with a pretty firm suspension. As long as the roads are decent, the 911 cruises at any speed and eats up pavement without any drama or chatter. You’ll feel it through the seat when you hit rough pavement and the car will get loud, but that’s the trade-off for choosing a car that’s optimized for going fast.\n\nI found the stability of the previous 911 to be fairly shocking given the car’s reputation for the opposite, but it’s somehow improved in the new car. It is seriously planted. You can ride it into corners at speeds that seem unsustainable and it’ll grip, yawn, take a sip of tea and shoot you out the other side. The steering is dialed in just right, with perfect weight on the wheel and an initial bite on turn-in that feels like you’re physically grabbing the nose of the car with your hand and shoving it into the turn. For a car with so much weight over the back wheels, the nose feels wonderfully grounded.\n\nTo say I was impressed by the 911’s handling and powertrain would be an understatement; this is a superlative sports car that awes at every turn. However, I do feel that something might be missing in the quest for more speed and stability. The casualness with which the Carrera S takes turns at speed is incredible to behold, but in a detached sort of way. I never found a public road I could drive at a safe speed that made this car sweat. I missed feeling like the car was working as hard as I was; it’s so nearly perfect, it’s also nearly inaccessible.\n\nOn the Button\n\nI was pleased to see the 911 gets its own interior control scheme. It doesn’t use the touch-sensitive panels Porsche put in the Cayenne and Panamera, but rather buttons and switches for the climate controls, drive settings and some multimedia functions. Those piano-black panels on either side of the gear selector may look touch-sensitive, but there’s a mechanical click to register inputs as a conventional button would have.\n\nThere are three new screens up top: two in front of the driver, flanking the tachometer, and a 10.9-inch touchscreen display in the center of the dash. The updated multimedia system is the same one found in the Panamera and Cayenne. The various displays are clear, with large icons, and there’s a nice infrared feature that can detect your hand approaching the screen to bring menus up. That said, it’s still not the easiest system to use. There’s no easy way to skip between radio station favorites, and the menus can run pretty deep. But it’s good-looking, with high-quality graphics, and after some extended time with the system in a few different Porsche vehicles, I found my frustration with it waning somewhat. As an alternative, iPhone users can use Apple CarPlay instead, though Android Auto remains unavailable, leaving Android users stuck with the native software.\n\nPeek behind the front seats and you’ll find what technically counts as two more seats in the back, but they’re more vestigial than useful. They won’t fit adults under any circumstance; climbing back there to take photos of the dashboard meant doing some gymnastics I don’t care to repeat.\n\n2020 Porsche 911 Carrera S | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\nValue\n\nMy 911 Carrera S test vehicle was modestly optioned (by 911 standards) and stickered at $128,800 including destination charges. That’s $14,150 more than its base price of $114,650. In addition to the Sport Chrono Package and rear-axle steering mentioned previously, it added brown leather seats ($5,340), cooled seats ($840), power sport seats ($2,330) and silver paint ($830). You can easily crank the price dial on the Carrera S even farther; I set the price limit for my fantasy configuration of the car at $140,000, but it can approach $180,000 if you really go crazy on the options.\n\nThe Carrera S is worth that price from a performance standpoint, but not at all from a safety one. Forward automatic emergency braking is standard, but that’s it as far as advanced driver safety features go — aside from a new Wet Mode feature, which detects moisture on the road and adjusts traction control and throttle accordingly. All the safety features we’re starting to take for granted on other new vehicles (that cost far less money) will require you to pony up. That matters less in this case because this is a 911, and its level of performance can smooth over deficiencies. Nevertheless, their absence is felt.\n\nThe 2020 911 Carrera S is an amazing machine with a jump in capability and speed versus the previous generation that’s laudable. To drive it is to be impressed by it; you can feel the car working underneath you, smoothing things out. But therein lies my biggest contention: It all feels a bit mechanical. Like a Vulcan-trained sports car, it’s separated all the emotion from the experience. I both loved driving it and wanted more liveliness from it at the same time.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "You hear top speed of more than 190 miles per hour.\n\nYou hear 0-60 in four seconds.\n\nYou hear 0-100 in less than 10 seconds.\n\nYou hear 415 horsepower, 11-inch-wide rear tires, and sizzling twin turbochargers, and you think twitchy exotic – fast, expensive, impractical, hard to handle.\n\nThe 2001 Porsche 911 is all of these things, except impractical, hard to handle, or twitchy.\n\nIn fact, even with its price tag ($114,000 market driven to $150,000), I wouldn’t call it an exotic. What it is, in fact, is probably the safest, best-handling, fastest everday car you could own.\n\nWe won’t get into why anyone needs a car that can top 190 miles per hour. If you need to ask that question, go find yourself a sedate sedan. What we will get into is this: Porsche has built, using lessons learned on the race track, its fastest, easiest to drive, most ferocious street car to date.\n\nIt even looks different.\n\nSure, one look at the profile and you know it’s a Porsche. But look closer.\n\nNotice the fascia with its gaping air intakes to cool radiators, brakes, and provide downforce on the front suspension. Check out the air intakes behind each door that help dual intercoolers breathe. Note the sedate spoiler on the rear – no awful whale tail – that pops up at 75 miles per hour.\n\nLook at it from behind and see those wide tires on 18-inch wheels. See the wide fenders needed to blanket those tires and the aggressive stance they give to the car.\n\nBack here, at speed, you get a rare thing – downforce on the rear end.\n\nIt’s a Porsche, all right, but some kind of different Porsche.\n\nWhen they built the new 911, Porsche engineers had a choice between two base powerplants – the 996 Carrera or the GT1. They decided the 996 version would take too much tinkering so they turned to the Le Mans-prepped GT1.\n\nWhat they ended up with is a twin-turbo, 24-valve, intercooled 3.6-liter engine that packs a whalloping 415 horsepower and 413 lb.-ft. of torque.\n\nIts torque band, seamless in any gear from around 2,500 rpms to more than 4,500 rpms, gives you absolute throttle/shift control over the car’s behavior.\n\nA key to this engine’s performance is what Porsche calls the VarioCam. As the car’s computer senses, via throttle, what you are asking it to do, the VarioCam can adjust camshaft angle, and thus timing. But further, it also controls lift and duration of the two intake valves on each cylinder. Punch the gas in third gear, for instance, and you get a 3-millimeter lift of short duration that bolts you forward. Keep the gas punched and it’s as if the car says, ”Oh, you want more, Hotfoot?” and responds by using two cam lobes for a high lift of 10-millimeter and long duration.\n\nThe result is the sensation that between each gear there is yet another gear – one you do not shift into yourself, one you cannot see on any shift indicator, but one that pushes your head back against the headrest and sucks your butt down into the seat, as it rockets you forward. Keep shifting up and it does this gear-by-gear, torque distributed appropriately front and rear to its all-wheel-drive system.\n\nA week of hard New England driving resulted in this Porsche getting just over 16 miles per gallon.\n\nThis is a car I had driven earlier this year on the West Coast where I got to really open it up – triple-digit speeds on a hill climb course, just over 175 miles per hour on a straight course in the desert – so I was anxious to have it for a week of ”normal” use.\n\nRealistically, there’s nothing ”normal” about driving this car. I mean, can you really let some yahoo in a Mitsubishi Spyder pass you on the highway? Can you realistically expect to head into a sharp turn on a dry deserted country lane and not at least feed the Porsche like it wants to be fed? Can you really, with a wide open and empty space of highway ahead of you, let it pass without a quick blast o the twin turbos?\n\nNo, no, and no.\n\nIn the West and East Coast tests, I got to drive both the six-speed manual and the five-speed Tiptronic transmissions and came away liking both. The manual, used in New England, is a wonder of clipped shifts and short throws. The Tiptronic makes you feel as though you are in some video game, punching up performance with your thumbs.\n\nOf course, to handle punched-up performance, you need a finely tuned suspension, and with struts, lower lateral arm links, trailing links, coils springs, tube shocks and antiroll bar up front, and a 5-link, coil spring, tube shock, antiroll bar setup in the rear, the 911 Turbo delivers a stiff, remarkably stable ride.\n\nJust as when, while accelerating, you feel it low in the butt, the same goes for cornering. All the pull seems to be down in the seat. No great forces against head or shoulders. No sense of lateral roll.\n\nEverything seems to happen in this car in that magical place between hands, seat, and pedals.\n\nBraking – big discs a Porsche trademark – is rapid, sure, and straight, even from three-digit speeds. Ceramic composite brakes, billed to last forever, are an option.\n\nIf there is anything to be said negatively about this as an everyday car it is that it does not like to run smoothly at low revs. It is easy – embarrassing if it happens in front of the onlookers this car draws – to stall it in first or reverse if you let the clutch out while babying the gas pedal. And at low speeds, there are odd little twitches and adjustments going on that only smooth out at higher speeds.\n\nThe interior, beautifully sculpted in finely stitched leathers, is comfortable and pleasingly unremarkable. Understatement at its best. The front bucket seats are thin, comfortable and firm. The rear quasi-seats are a great place for children or luggage.\n\nI’ve been to almost crazy speeds in tenuous conditions with this car; been through guardrail-less hairpin turns at high Western altitudes; driven kids to soccer, garbage to the recycling center (that raised some eyebrows), and said no, no, and no when opportunities to decline challenges presented themselves.\n\nAnd so I ask myself: Is this the fastest, most stable, most fun car I have ever driven?\n\nYes, yes, and yes.\n\nNice touch:\n\nThe onboard computer that lets you check oil levels with a simple couple of flicks of a stem on the steering wheel. Wouldn’t want dipstick-stained hands gripping this leather wheel.\n\nAnnoyance:\n\nSquealing brakes. I asked a Porsche engineer about it. All he would say, with Teutonic determination, is that that’s just the way they are.",

      "expert_review": "There are but a handful of automobile manufacturers worldwide whose names are associated with truly supercar performance capabilities.\n\nOne is Porsche, the manufacturer of the 1996 Porsche 911 Turbo, a coupe whose engineering design put it on a rarified plain of automotive excellence.\n\nThe 1996 911 Turbo is based on the latest revisions of the 911 model’s 21-year history.\n\nKey elements include an exterior styling which has been updated without losing the 911 styling theme, a redesigned rear suspension, the fifth level of ABS braking, a stronger body shell, and enhanced driver/passenger levels of comfort and ergonomics.\n\nAdded to this package are the four-wheel drive system from the Porsche 911 Carrera 4, bodywork that features the fixed Turbo-wing rear spoiler, and extensive luxury equipment.\n\nThe 911 Turbo is the epitome of the adage “Speed costs money, how fast do you want to go?”\n\nFor those who can afford it, this machine can give you a real ride, like on the order of 180 miles per hour and 0-60 in 4.4 seconds. Porsche says this performance data is supplied for information purposes only. The company recommends owners obey all traffic laws.\n\nThe 911 Turbo is not for everyone. With a $105,000 base price, it’s obvious that you need to bring money.\n\n“Generally, prices run from about $110,000 to $115,000,” said Chad Spidle, new car manager for Tom Wood Porsche. “Buyer demographics are professional people whose ages run from the late 40s to early 60s. Right now, I have more customers than cars.”\n\nFor that type of expenditure, you get the most powerful production Porsche ever offered for sale in the United States.\n\nThe engine is based on the traditional Porsche flat-6 (opposed or so called boxer) design. While the “in” thing among engine design these days is dual overhead cams and four valves per cylinder, the Turbo sticks with a single overhead cam, two valves per cylinder, and a hemispherical combustion chamber.\n\nThe results from 3.6 liters of displacement (220 cubic inches) and twin turbochargers with dual intercoolers is 400-horsepower and 400 foot-pounds of torque.\n\nThis kind of power is guaranteed to get your attention, particularly when flat-footing through Porsche’s six-speed gearbox.\n\nThe six-speeder is the only way the 911 Turbo comes. Porsche makes a very excellent four-speed Tiptronic automatic transmission which can be manually shifted or run as fully automatic. The torque developed from turbocharging is a little beyond the safety capacities of the automatic.\n\nPorsche has designed a manual gearbox that is strong enough to withstand the power of the Turbo’s motor but is easier to drive in stop-and-go traffic than earlier models. Double-cone synchromesh on first and second gears reduce shifting effort by 40 percent, and a hydraulically assisted clutch needs some 25 percent less effort and has 15 percent less pedal travel.\n\nIf you want to take a lesson from the horse that pulls the wagon with all four feet, Porsche’s AWD (all -wheel drive) system is the right way to drive a motor car. Not only is it an advantage on slippery pavement, but all four wheels driving give the car the sense of balance through fast corners that assures drivers that everything is going the way they want it to go.\n\nThe 911 Turbo is no spartan, roaring, vibrating sports car. It is luxury personified.\n\nThe interior features Porsche’s traditional 2-plus-2 seating, but with 89.5 inches of wheelbase and 167.8 inches of overall length the rear seats mainly are for little people.\n\nA five-gauge instrument panel dominates the dash board. Porsche designers had the good sense to include an oil pressure and oil temperature gauge to monitor the turbocharged engine.",

      "expert_review": "Tired of all the dreary news?\n\nThen slip behind the wheel of a 2009 Porsche 911 Carrera for a little R&R.\n\nWe briefly felt guilty about enjoying a high-performance sports car at a time when some are losing sleep over conserving an ounce of fuel, until we pulled the ruby red Porsche into a mall lot as a bumblebee yellow Smart was pulling out.\n\nIt appeared the man piloting the Smart shed a tear while gazing fondly at the Porsche. At $4 a gallon for gas, his Smart looks a lot better. At the $1.79 the day our paths crossed, the Porsche won out.\n\nPorsche offers the rear-wheel-drive Carrera and Carrera S (coupe and cabriolet), plus all-wheel-drive Carrera 4 and Carrera 4S coupe and cabrio. The 4 denotes a new AWD system borrowed from the 911 Turbo; the S a bolder 6-cylinder.\n\nWe tested the 911 Carrera 4S cabrio. AWD helps it stick to the pavement as if attached to a rail. Exceptional handling and stability, especially at high speed. And to keep you in command, stability control and traction control are standard.\n\nThe power top on the 4S cabrio opens and hides behind the rear seats in about 20 seconds. Ditto for the return trip. Though it wasn’t quite 40 degrees, we went top down, turned the heat up full blast and hoped Bernie Madoff could see from his cell.\n\nEven topless, the cabin remains quiet enough for conversation, though if the wind deflector had been behind the front seats, the talk would have been about something other than cold necks.\n\nJust in case, reinforced windshield pillars serve as a roll bar; a second roll bar mounted behind the rear seats deploys when sensors detect an impending rollover.\n\nThe Carrera line has been upgraded for 2009 with a 3.6-liter, 345-horsepower (up from 325) 6 in the base models, and a 3.8-liter, 385-h.p. (up from 355) 6 in the S, which also gets 19-inch radials (18-inchers in the base models).\n\nThere’s a choice of 6-speed manual or 7-speed automatic transmission, the latter with Doppelkupplungsgetriebe, or PDK to Porsche. The new double-clutch tranny-one for even numbered gears, one for odd-replaces Tiptronic, the clutchless manual that shifted by tapping steering-wheel paddles.\n\nWith computer technology, the transmission shifts twice, out of one gear and into another, on its own faster than a human can. Shifts are smooth and seamless. The 4S sprints from the light. Raw power. No hesitation or stumbling, just blistering quick yet exceptionally sure-footed movement.\n\nThe 4S cabriolet accelerates from zero to 60 m.p.h. in 4.7 seconds with standard 6-speed manual; 4.5 seconds with 7-speed automatic and PDK. Top speed is 183 m.p.h. Brakes are beefed up in keeping with Porsche’s philosophy that quick starts deserve even quicker stops.\n\nWhile 4S aims to please enthusiasts, the mileage minded are served, too, by an 18 m.p.g. city/27 m.p.g. highway rating with PDK, 2 m.p.g. better than with 6-speed manual. While no economy car, it’s no guzzler either.\n\nWhere the 4S falls short is in rear-seat room, where a couple leather buckets reside to keep insurance agents from charging the two-seater rate. Likewise, the trunk upfront holds only a small duffel bag. Golf clubs? Try tennis.\n\nAmenities atone for shortcomings. Heated seats ($500) are also ventilated ($800) to cool by circulating air through the seatback and bottom cushions. There’s also Bluetooth phone as well as iPod, USB and MP3 player connections ($440).\n\nStyling changes are minor: new covers for the headlamps, larger air inlets, larger exterior mirrors and dual, round, polished exhaust outlets on the 4S.\n\nThe 911 Carrera 4S starts at $102,900, so buyers aren’t worried about $4 gas.\n\n“But they aren’t immune to what’s going on with the economy,” said Porsche spokesman Gary Fong, citing a 40 percent dip in December sales, though noting “only” an 11 percent decline in February.\n\nYet, the $102,900 is only the initiation fee. The 4S added PDK at $4,080, beige leather interior at $3,655, power comfort memory seats at $1,550 and an adjustable sport suspension package with firmer settings and programmed shifts for the track at $960, to name a few.\n\nBut at $120,000, it gets more smiles per gallon than a yellow bumblebee.\n\nRead Jim Mateja Sunday in Rides.

      "expert_review": "The 2013 Porsche 911 is a civilized sports car that embraces the needs of both luxury- and performance-minded car buyers in a way that prior generations never have.\n\nAll you need is a wide-open wallet.\n\nA redesigned 911 debuted as a 2012 model and, as is Porsche tradition, additional variants have begun to appear in subsequent model years. Our test car, a 911 Carrera 4S Cabriolet (convertible), is one of those variants. This version is fitted with all-wheel drive and a more powerful flat-six engine and starts at a lofty $118,480, including a $950 destination charge. A staggering $28,695 worth of optional features (see them all by clicking here) made the as-tested price swell to $147,175. Prime competitors include the Audi R8, BMW M6 and Jaguar XKR, all of which also come as both coupes and convertibles; to see these cars’ specs compared with the 911, click here.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe 911 driving experience — especially in convertible form with the top down — is all about engaging your senses. From the distinctive turbinelike whine of the rear-mounted flat-six engine to the way the car feels on different road surfaces, the 911 is a machine that’s always communicating with you. It refreshingly embraces its sounds in an era when other luxury performance cars try to mute them.\n\nThe most surprising thing about the 911 is how workable it is as an everyday car. In the car’s regular or Sport modes, ride quality is firm but livable; it didn’t beat me up when commuting on some less-than-smooth surfaces. That changes when you choose the optional Sport Plus setting, which firms up the ride considerably. On Chicago’s beat-up post-winter roads, it didn’t take long to grow weary of this setting.\n\nWhat isn’t tiresome about Sport Plus is the rev-matching feature for the seven-speed — yes, seven-speed — manual transmission. It makes you look like a pro even if you’re not trying, by automatically blipping the throttle on downshifts to perfectly match engine rpm to the new gear. The gas pedal is responsive enough in normal mode and more immediate in Sport, so it isn’t hard to match revs on your own, but it is hard to beat the automated system’s consistency, shift after shift.\n\nThe other thing that doesn’t get old is the optional sport exhaust, which opens a freer-flowing path for exhaust gases in Sport and Sport Plus modes. The resulting sound is deep with plenty of burbles, and there’s enough crackling and popping when decelerating to bring a smile to your face. It’s quite a bit different from the sport exhaust’s regular mode, where you hear more of the turbinelike engine sound than the exhaust rumble.\n\nWith a 400-horsepower, 3.8-liter flat-six engine driving all four wheels, the 911 4S Cabriolet builds speed quickly — and sounds great in the process. With the seven-speed manual, Porsche cites a zero-to-60-mph time of 4.5 seconds. The available seven-speed double-clutch automatic transmission is even quicker to 60 mph, taking just 4.3 seconds — or 4.1 seconds with the optional Sport Chrono Package. With the majority of engine torque directed to the rear wheels on dry roads, the 911 4S Cabriolet feels and behaves like a sure-footed rear-wheel-drive car.\n\nWhether you get the manual or dual-clutch gearbox, the transmissions’ seven speeds contribute to respectable gas mileage for a sports car. With the manual, the 911 4S Cabriolet gets an EPA-estimated 18/26 mpg city/highway, and the dual-clutch transmission gains 1 mpg extra in city driving for a 19/26 mpg rating.\n\nWith a driving experience that’s so sensory, the one aspect that’s a little diluted is the steering setup. While precise and responsive, the electromechanical system doesn’t provide the kind of steering feedback we’re used to from Porsche. It’s been filtered out to a large degree, and the steering is quite a bit lighter than you might expect, though our test car had the optional Power Steering Plus, which provides more steering assistance when traveling below 31 mph. At a minimum, there needs to be a mode with demonstrably less assist, perhaps tied to the Sport or Sport Plus modes.\n\nLuxury-Oriented Cabin\nDespite their premium pricing, Porsche interiors aren’t known for being especially luxurious, and for some time the 911 was no exception. That began to change with the introduction of the Panamera sedan a few years ago, and the theme of high-end finishes has since spread throughout the lineup, with the 911 getting its own luxury-oriented theme with its 2012 redesign. Though the cabin has a function-oriented layout, upscale materials on the doors and dashboard help justify the purchase price, where the prior-generation 911’s interior failed to do so.\n\nOne of the best changes to the new 911 is the driving position, which I found much more comfortable compared with the prior-gen car. The front-seat cushioning is among the firmest you’ll find in a passenger car, but the support is appreciated when working the manual transmission’s firm clutch pedal, which will give your leg a workout in stop-and-go traffic.\n\nI wasn’t thrilled, however, with the location of the 911’s various performance-oriented buttons, like the ones for Sport, Sport Plus and the sport exhaust. They’re clustered together near your hip on the center console, which means you have to look down and away from the road to use them — not something you want to be doing when driving at a good clip. It’d make a lot of sense to put them on the steering wheel within easy reach of your hands, especially because there were no buttons — not even audio controls — on our test car’s SportDesign steering wheel, which is a $250 option.\n\nConvertible Commentary\nOne of the great things about the convertible version of the 911 is that it lets you more fully experience the mechanical symphony happening behind your head when you lower the power soft-top, which takes about 18 seconds. It takes a little less time — about 16 seconds — for the top to go back up, and once it’s raised the cabin is pretty quiet when cruising at highway speeds, with just some mild tire noise. (We tested the 911 4S Cabriolet in the springtime, but it was still fitted with a set of winter tires, so we don’t know how the regular tires sound.) The fully automatic soft-top works at speeds up to 31 mph, Porsche says.\n\nThe other thing that’s powered is a wind deflector that motors out from the rear of the passenger compartment, covering the two rear seats, at the push of a button. Manual wind blockers tend to be a nightmare to install; they’re a kind of automotive origami that’s typically more trouble than it’s worth, and I suspect quite a few are collecting dust in garages the world over. The 911’s powered one, in contrast, is so simple to operate that you’ll probably use it quite a bit.\n\nWith the screen deployed, there isn’t any buffeting at highway speeds with the top down — even with the side windows lowered. It’s just mildly breezy. The screen completely covers the rear seats, but as actual places for sitting, these seats are highly suspect to begin with: The cushions are tiny and the backrest is vertical.\n\nTop-up visibility is limited in a few directions, primarily when looking out the rear window or checking your right-side blind spot. Parking sensors give you a better feel for your surroundings, but I’m surprised our test car didn’t have a backup camera.\n\nAs convertibles go, the 911’s chassis is one of the stiffer ones out there, but I did drive some roads that made the car’s body shudder. A rough patch in the middle of a sweeping turn brought on some body flex, but there was less when the car met the same type of surface on a straightaway.\n\nSafety\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety haven’t crash-tested the 911, and the model’s comparatively low sales volume means it’s unlikely that the car will be tested in the future.\n\nSafety features include antilock brakes, an electronic stability system, traction control, seat-mounted side-impact airbags, door-mounted side curtain airbags designed to provide head protection, and pop-up roll bars behind the backseat that deploy if the car rolls over.\n\nFor a full list of safety features, check out the Features & Specs page.\n\n911 Carrera 4S Cabriolet in the Market\nThere aren’t many sports cars that have been around as long as the 911 — the car marks its 50th anniversary this year — and none that have stayed as true to the original’s formula. At the same time, Porsche has managed to transform the 911 into a modern sports car with the performance and amenities buyers expect. It’s an icon of the sports car world, and shoppers have responded to the latest generation in a big way: 911 sales were up 42 percent last year. After driving it, it’s easy to understand its appeal.\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "There’s an unwritten rule when it comes to test driving cars that you drive the base model before slipping into the top-of-the-line rendition.\n\nThat way, you can appreciate the base model for what it is, low-cost entry into the lineup, and the top-of-the-line model for what it represents, the best in the stable and what owners of the base model can aspire to.\n\nWe broke the rule when it came to a pair of Porsche 911s, the 2002 Targa and Carrera 4S, with the high-performance 4S taken first, the open-top Targa second.\n\nThe Targa is no slouch. It’s powered by the same 3.6-liter, 320-horsepower 6-cylinder engine teamed with 6-speed manual as the 4S. But the 4S comes with all-wheel-drive that allows the 6 to perform at its best when it comes to zero- to 60-m.p.h. acceleration while providing optimum handling at any speed.\n\nThe ’02 911 series bowed in February after being redesigned and upgraded. All 911s sport new front ends with the Targa sharing the look of the regular 911, the 4S the look of the 911 Turbo, complete with spoiler to reduce rear-end lift at speed.\n\nOther than basic styling, what also sets the two apart is that the all-wheel-drive 4S, which replaces the 4 coupe, and rear-wheel-drive Targa we tested came with 18-inch radials. But the 4S is shod with wider profile tires so you benefit from a larger paw print on the road. The result is better takeoffs, quicker response to turns and corners and less road harshness transmitted back into the cabin. The Targa’s standard tires are 17-inch radials (the upgrade to 18 costs $1,325). Moving up to 18s costs $1,325.\n\nThe 4S has a fixed roof, the Targa a retractable glass roof about the size of a picture window. Great visibility to the world above and open-air motoring without lots of wind turbulence penetrating the cabin.\n\nWe’ve reached an age when buffeting wind finds little mane to muss. But even those with long flowing locks can travel with the glass roof fully open without having to reach for the spray.\n\nWhile the Targa roof is best appreciated when fully open–and when fully open it provides about a 20-inch gap to gaze at the stars–it did present some visibility problems.\n\nWhen the glass retracts, it slides back directly under the rear window. You’d expect that being forced to now look through two layers of glass would present a problem. It didn’t, but then the Targa roof and rear window glass were perfectly clean.\n\nWhat we didn’t expect, however, is that when you open the Targa only part way, about 8 inches or so, the solid metal strip that separates roof from rear window–and retracts with the glass–blocks the rear view. Depending on how far you open the glass, you can block out anything following in the same lane.\n\nNot good if someone is approaching quickly from behind. Not good as well if you open the glass part way before backing up from the parking stall.\n\nWe’ve found that the public will exude sympathy a nd rush to your aid when a problem develops when driving a Chevrolet or Ford. But the same folks will sit back and guffaw when you have a snafu with a Porsche, Ferrari, Rolls-Royce or other vehicle that caters to those with blue blood and silver spoons.\n\nThe 20-inch roof opening is twice that of normal sunroofs. Living under a glass roof, of course, does present some problems along about July, so the Targa comes with a power cloth shade to control the glare and ward off some of the heat directed into the cabin.\n\nPorsche says the shade only works when the roof is closed. Not in our test vehicle, which allowed the shade to operate when the roof was open, too.\n\nWhat made both Porsches special, and the 4S even more so, was the addition of the German automaker’s stability management system–standard on the 4S, a $1,230 option on the Targa.\n\nThe system uses the anti-lock brakes and throttle control so you don’t lose contact wth the pavement. The benefits are even ore pronounced, of course, with the high-performance 4S, which tends to be driven a bit more aggressively anyway.\n\nThis is also the first Porsche Targa built off the coupe body and not the cabriolet, or convertible. By coming off the coupe, there’s more built-in rigidity, which translates into a quieter cabin.\n\nAs noted, the 4S and Targa share a 3.6-liter, 320-h.p. 6 teamed with 6-speed manual, an upgrade from the former 3.4-liter, 300-h.p. 6. The 3.6-liter also delivers 15 more foot-pounds of torque, to 273 foot-pounds, for more noticeable response to throttle input and more spirited starts.\n\nThe 4S claims a zero- to 60-m.p.h. time of 5.1 seconds and a top speed of 174 m.p.h. and the Targa claims 5.2 seconds and a top speed of 171 m.p.h. The reason for the difference despite the same engine is that with all-wheel-drive, the 4S is quicker off-the-line and comes with a three-chamber exhaust that reduces back pressure–as well as giving it a little bark to go with the bite.\n\nWhile a 6-speed manual is standard in both, a Tiptronic automatic with manual clutchless shifting is optional at $3,430. Only about 25 percent of Porsche buyers opt for Tiptronic, the automaker said.\n\nBase price of the 4S is $80,200, the Targa $75,200.\n\nStandard in both are all the power goodies and comfort amenities as well as ABS and door-mounted side air bags.\n\nNoteworthy touches include a locking glovebox for the first time to go along with the locking console, stowage in the door armrests, back rests on the mock seats in back (there to allow four-seat rather than higher two-seat insurance premiums) that fold to form a ledge to store items; a redesigned cupholder that slides out and sideways from the dash rather than straight back (it gave the cupholder engineer something to do), and also for the first time an optional Bose audio system to atone for the fact that Porsche has never been known as a showcase for sound systems.\n\nThe Bose system comes in a package called advanced technic that runs $3,240 and includes a six-disc CD changer and Xenon headlamps. Porsche expects a 75 percent installation rate.\n\nThe 4S added such major options as the Bose system and an advanced design package at $4,385, which basically is an interior decor package with the focus on decorative trim around air vents, instrumentation, speakers, switches, dials, and door sills.\n\nThe Targa added the Bose package, 18-inch wheels, stability management and a comfort package at $2,100 that includes power seats with height and lumbar adjustment and memory settings, memory inside mirror and passenger-side tilt down outside mirror when backing up.\n\nSales of the $68,000 to $180,000 Porsche 911 lineup totaled 10,763 in 2001, up from 9,093 in ’00. Boxster, the entry-level $43,000 to $52,000 roadster, slipped to 12,278 from 13,312.\n\n“The 911 buyer hasn’t been affected by the economy. The buyers are Boomers reaching their peak earning s years,” Porsche spokesman Bob Carlson said.\n\nEither Boxster buyers were more affected by the economy or they are waiting for a redesign coming for ’03.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nBecause last years changes to Porsches long-lived 911 series were extensive, only the addition of an in-dash CD player is new for the 2003 model year. Porsches 2003 lineup includes seven versions: the rear-wheel-drive (RWD) Carrera coupe, convertible and Targa coupe; the all-wheel-drive (AWD) Carrera 4 Cabriolet (convertible) and 4S coupe; the higher-powered AWD Turbo coupe; and the limited-production 911 GT2.\n\nFreshly shaped at the front end in 2002, the 911 has Turbo-like headlights and a wider rear-end panel above restyled oval exhaust tailpipes. Additional power also emerged in 2002 as the rear-mounted six-cylinder engine grew from 3.4 liters to 3.6 liters and from 300 to 315 horsepower. The body structures were also strengthened, and a glass rear window replaced the previous polycarbonate pane in the convertible models, which have a power-operated top.\n\nThe Targa coupes feature a sliding glass roof thats twice the size of a customary sunroof, which opens to 20 inches. A wind deflector is installed at the leading edge. A cloth blind protects against the sun and adds cold-weather insulation.\n\nFirst introduced in 1996, the current Carrera 4S was created in the image of the 911 Turbo, says Porsche spokesperson Robert Carlson. In fact, the basic coupe body, suspension and AWD system are shared with the 911 Turbo. The front end resembles that of the Turbo, but the Turbos large air intakes are not needed.\n\nThe 4S has the same automatic-deploying rear spoiler that the other 911 models have; it raises at 75 mph and lowers at 50 mph. Solid-spoke wheels hold 18-inch tires. Porsches Stability Management System is standard on the 4S and Carrera 4 Cabriolet and optional on the other models.\n\nTwin turbochargers in the 911 Turbo help the 3.6-liter six-cylinder engine crank out 415 hp. AWD and a six-speed-manual transmission are standard. A five-speed automatic with Porsches Tiptronic system is also available; it permits manual gear changes.\n\nDuring the 2002 model year, Porsche also introduced a new temptation to satisfy even the most power-frenzied sports-car enthusiasts. Billed as the ultimate Porsche and called the 911 GT2, it adds a batch of racing-derived features to the 911 Turbo foundation and takes on an extra 41 horsepower in the process.\n\nEven better for performance, the 911 GT2 weighs about 220 pounds less than the Turbo for a power-to-weight ratio of 6.8 pounds per horsepower. Instead of all-wheel drive like the 911 Turbo, the 911 GT2 is equipped with rear-wheel drive, which helps keep the weight down. Porsche claims a 0-to-62-mph acceleration time of about 4 seconds and a top track speed of 195 mph. Porsches Ceramic Composite Brakes, which are optional on the 911 Turbo, are standard on the 911 GT2.\n\nGradually reaching dealerships since the 2002 season, the 911 GT2 is priced at $181,700. Porsche expects to send approximately 250 units to the United States each year. Competitors come from the exotic sports car crop: the Aston Martin V12 Vanquish, Dodge Viper, Ferraris and Lamborghinis.\n\nExterior\nEven though the 911s sleek, low, curvaceous shape has remained essentially the same since the car was redesigned for 1999, the latest Carreras look more assertive. Carrera 4 convertibles come with a removable hardtop, while the regular Carrera has only a fabric top. Carrera models can have an optional sport suspension and roof rack.\n\nNearly devoid of extraneous trim, the smoothly contoured 911 body looks the part of a near-supercar. The Turbos appearance is even bolder with its wide stance, especially at the rear. Three large intake grilles dominate the lower front fascia, which sends air to the Turbos three radiators. Air scoops integrated into the leading edges of the rear fenders channel air to intercoolers. A biplane two-piece rear spoiler on the Turbo differs from that on other models and is supposed to enhance high-speed stability.\n\nEven though the basic appearance of the 911 GT2 is similar to that of the 911 Turbo, several design changes are noticeable  and theyre functional and not just decorative touches. The front air intakes are larger, and distinctive air intakes sit ahead of the front hood. Air-intake scoops at the rear have been moved far to the outside. Standing 50.2 inches tall, the 911 GT2 rides a 92.7-inch wheelbase and measures 175 inches long overall.\n\nA one-piece fixed wing replaces the automatic-deploying rear spoiler on the 911 Turbo, but the wing can be adjusted manually by 6 degrees for racetrack driving. The 911 GT2s wing is taller, extends farther to the rear than the Turbos spoiler and produces greater downforce at higher speeds. Ducts at the wing ends deliver fresh air to the engine.\n\nReworking the suspension has produced a 0.78-inch lower center of gravity. The wheels and tires are also larger than the Turbos, measuring P235/40ZR18 up front and a massive P315/30ZR18 at the rear. Ceramic composite brakes reduce unsprung weight by 36.6 pounds, which helps enhance suspension response.\n\nInterior\nCalled four-passenger automobiles by Porsche, the 911s have plenty of space for front-seat occupants but backseat riders are likely to be in trouble, especially in convertible models. A tachometer and three-spoke steering wheel sit ahead of the driver, with the ignition switch to the left of the dashboard. A locking glove box is included.\n\nThe bucket seats are made of a synthetic material and upholstered in leather. Standard equipment includes power windows, remote keyless entry, automatic climate control, a CD player and an anti-theft system. Automatic climate control, cruise control and natural leather trim are optional.\n\nUnder the Hood\nDubbed a boxer engine because of its horizontally opposed cylinder layout, the base six-cylinder is mounted at the rear of the car and develops 315 hp. Although the Turbos 3.6-liter displacement is almost the same as the Carreras, bore and stroke dimensions differ. Turbos are fitted with twin turbochargers and produce 415 hp and 415 pounds-feet of torque; an optional power kit boosts horsepower to 444.\n\nBoth engines team with a six-speed-manual or optional five-speed-automatic transmission  the latter is fitted with Tiptronic, which allows manual gear selection. Manual-shift buttons are mounted on the steering wheel.\n\nTo derive the 911 GT2s 456 hp from the engine used in the 911 Turbo  which makes 415 hp  Porsche engineers attached twin turbochargers to give the fuel/air mixture an even stronger boost as it makes its way into the cylinders. The 3.6-liter horizontally opposed six-cylinder achieves its peak horsepower at 5,700 rpm and develops 457 pounds-feet of torque through the 3,500 to 4,500 rpm range.\n\nMufflers present less back pressure than on the Turbo. A modified six-speed-manual gearbox is the only available transmission.\n\nSafety\nAll 911 models have side-impact airbags and all-disc antilock brakes. Supplemental safety bars pop out of the convertibles rear deck if sensors detect an impending rollover. Porsches Stability Management System is standard on Turbo and AWD models and optional on RWD Carreras.\n\nDriving Impressions\nPiloting a Porsche 911 in any form is like savoring a legend in its own time. Measured against Porsches of the past, recent models are comparatively easy to drive and quite civilized. They provide a oneness with the road and also blend a reasonably smooth, extra-stable ride with vigorous performance and utmost handling talents. Even the familiar engine whine isnt as omnipresent as it used to be, and the exhaust note is subdued yet exuberant. Porsches six-speed gearbox is as good as they get.\n\nWedded-to-the-road handling and directional stability are neatly enhanced by the Carrera 4s AWD system. The highway ride is super, but the 911s suspension sometimes reacts harshly on rougher pavement. Acceleration is energetic in all six forward speeds, even without the Turbo.\n\nThe snug-fitting leather-trimmed seats are tempting to many riders but may be disdained by others. Storage space is meager.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com\nPosted on 3/26/03",

      "expert_review": "One of the great regrets of my auto-reviewing career has been that I apparently instill fear in the good people at Porsche.\n\nI know this because I rarely have had the opportunity to test drive the company’s primo sports cars. Oh, sure, I’ve driven all versions of the Cayenne, but testing a Porsche sport-utility vehicle really doesn’t count. To most motorists, Porsche equates to top-tier sports car fun.\n\nMaybe the German automaker is still upset with me for frying the clutch on a Porsche 968. But gosh, that was years ago.\n\nImagine my surprise when I received a call to test a 2005 Porsche 911 Carrera S Cabriolet. I tried to remain cool, but I was audibly salivating when I accepted the offer.\n\nWhat showed up was a bright-red, black-leather-interior rocket of a convertible – the kind of car that draws more attention than Tom Cruise popping anti-depressants on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills.\n\nI half expected a California Highway Patrol officer to stroll up with a cordial offer: “Would you like me to follow you home or write up your ticket right here and now?”\n\nNearly as breathtaking as the car was the bottom line on the sticker – $100,535. The struggle of instinct vs. reality was on.\n\nMaybe it’s a male thing, but getting an opportunity to drive a car such as a Porsche 911 Carrera tempts one to step into the driver’s seat, fire it up and flatline the accelerator on the nearest stretch of semi-quiet road. But at the same time, you don’t want to put a dent in a $100,000 car that is not yours, and you don’t want to risk a chance encounter with the ever-vigilant CHP.\n\nFortunately, those testosterone-suppression classes I took online came in handy, and I settled for a spirited run up to Stateline, Nev., and back.\n\nThe driving experience was memorable. What a way to close out the 2005 model year – driving a Porsche that is the essence of the German automaker’s high-performance art.\n\nThere are plenty of cars that have more horsepower than the tested Carrera S Cabriolet’s 355, but few make better use of them. Response from the 3.8-liter, horizontally opposed six-cylinder engine was instantaneous. The Porsche easily breezed up the steepest inclines and made quick work of other autos in the short, Highway 50 passing zones between here and Lake Tahoe.\n\nThere’s a satisfying growl from the power plant, and its favorite tune came forth during hard accelerations. The engine seemed to hate slow start-ups, emitting an angry “whuputa, whuputa, whuputa” sound. You could almost hear it begging, “C’mon, let’s get moving!”\n\nThe sport-tuned, independent suspension was so finely tweaked that I was able to do things with the Porsche that I would never try on a sporty $50,000 coupe. The Porsche was monorail-solid on high-speed corners … not even a hint of a wiggle.\n\nThe downside of such fine tuning is feeling every bump and imperfection in the road. The nearly two-hour run up to Stateline felt like four hours on my tailbone and lower back.\n\nGetting out of the low-slung car is interesting as well. At 6-feet-4-inches tall, I had to swing both legs up and over the side, then sit waiting for two arms to lift me up, like a quarterback expecting a little help from the linebacker who just flattened him.\n\nNaturally, I understand that a silky, smooth ride is not the nature of the car. Performance rules. You take a Porsche 911 Carrera S Cabriolet out for a heart-pumping spin, not a freeway road trip to your high school reunion in Topeka.\n\nWhy else would Porsche place a chronograph at the top of the dashboard? It’s a great idea for keeping track of lap times or elapsed time between Points A and B.\n\nHowever, I resisted the temptation to make too many timed, high-speed runs, figuring there might be other folks out there timing me – the kind of folks who can compel you to pay money to the court clerk for your speedy indiscretions.\n\nFor a car that broadcasts performance, the tested Porsche was nicely equipped inside. A high-end Bose audio system projected impressively above the engine noise and exterior sounds. And the climate-control system – sometimes undependable in the small confines of a convertible – worked admirably. It quickly cooled or heated – and maintained temperatures – as desired.\n\nAs for the two back seats, don’t go there. Unless you’re transporting miniature circus clowns who get out of those tiny cars in the center ring, the back seats are more suited for a small suitcase than two human beings.\n\nThis Porsche is what it is: a guilty pleasure. It’s an immensely enjoyable road-burner for those who can afford the fare.\n\nMy week was certainly enjoyable. And Porsche has nothing to fear.\n\n– – –\n\nPORSCHE 911 CARRERA AT A GLANCE\n\nMake/model: 2005 Porsche 911 Carrera S Cabriolet.\n\nVehicle type: Four-passenger, two-door, rear-drive, high-performance, luxury convertible.\n\nBase price: $88,900 (as tested, $100,535).\n\nEngine: 3.8-liter, horizontally opposed six-cylinder with 355 horsepower at 6,600 revolutions per minute and 295 foot-pounds of torque at 4,600 rpm.\n\nEPA fuel economy: 19 miles per gallon city; 26 mpg highway.\n\nTransmission: Five-speed Tiptronic with clutchless manual shifting feature.\n\nSteering: Power-assisted rack and pinion.\n\nBrakes: Power four-wheel, ventilated discs.\n\nSuspension: Independent, MacPherson strut-type on front; independent multi-link on rear (coil springs front, rear).\n\nFuel tank: 16.9 gallons.\n\nCargo volume: 4.8 cubic feet.\n\nCurb weight: 3,131 pounds.\n\nTrack: 58.5 inches on front; 59.7 inches on rear.\n\nGround clearance: 3.8 inches.\n\nHeight: 51.2 inches.\n\nLength: 175.6 inches.\n\nWheelbase: 92.5 inches.\n\nWidth: 71.2 inches.\n\nTires: P235/35ZR19 performance tires on front; P295/30ZR19 on rear.\n\nFinal assembly point: Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany.\n\nAbout the writer: The Bee’s Mark Glover can be reached at (916) 321-1184 or mglover@sacbee.com.",

      "expert_review": "The Porsche 911 Carrera S is almost mythical.\n\nSpotting one on the open road in Michigan is like trying to lasso a unicorn.\n\nBut they are out there and when you see one bolt past, you have to wonder what it’s like to drive one.\n\nAllow me to explain: It’s better.\n\nThe 911 S is a mechanical dream, watch-like precision in a car. There’s a reason German engineering comes with such a glorified reputation and the 911 S proves this at every turn.\n\nWhen I sat inside the cabin for the first time, I was in awe — it didn’t even matter that I was driving the 2009 model of the 911 S when the 2010 version with a few updates was starting to roll into dealerships. (There have been some additions to the 2010 model year, but most are minor and the 2009 is a good representation.)\n\nSo as I took the keys and started it up, I listened to the 3.8 liter purr like a Katzen after a bowl of Milch. Unlike big American V-8s that rumble and chug and delight the senses with their nearly grotesque power, the Porsche offers a higher pitched growl that doesn’t do its abilities justice. The difference is like an accent — it’s not better or worse, but when it’s foreign there’s an inexplicable appeal to it.\n\nPumping out 385 horsepower and 310 pound-feet or torque, both respectable but not through-the-roof numbers, the Porsche’s engine is only part of the package. This car is a study in efficiency and performance. It weighs a mere 3,100 pounds and uses all of its muscle to toss this car around as if it were in a video game. The only thing it might feel challenged by is the driver.\n\nPushing this car to its limits would require a racetrack and a professional driver. I found driving the 911 S both exhilarating and humbling at the same time. Blasting around corners, the car never blinked at what I asked it to do; I did. The independent suspension held me tightly to the ground, and the 19-inch wheels stuck to the pavement like Velcro. The steering is exact and perfectly balanced. There is no flaw in this car’s performance.\n\nEven after the Porsche spell wore off — it takes about three days to not feel in awe of it — I never felt I was stretching this car’s abilities. It will do 100 mph as easily as it starts. And every time you click through the six-speed manual transmission, the short throws ever so clean, the 911 S rewards you. There is always more power available, reassuring you that you can pass anything on the road.\n\nThis is one of those $90,000 machines that can serve every purpose a person might conceive.\n\nSatisfying in every way\n\nThe cabin is luxuriously practical — offering an encased leather cockpit for surgically dissecting the road. It complements the exquisite exterior. The profile is pure icon, with the curved hood and sloping roof. People could walk out of a cave and see the 911 S for the first time and still know this car was special. There’s a reason Porsche always does so well in consumer satisfaction surveys — it’s because the car is simply so satisfying in every way.\n\nBetter yet, the front fenders slope out and above the hood; you can see them cutting the way ahead of you from the driver’s seat. It’s just another reminder of what you’re driving. When you’re sitting inside this vehicle, even if you’re just running to the drug store to get a pint of milk, you feel special.\n\nThere’s something subtle about this car that’s also blatantly in your face. The dichotomy is yet another rewarding aspect about it.\n\nPerhaps it’s the S that follows the 911.\n\nIt strokes your ego like few other vehicles ever could and rewards even the worst driver with obedience and compliance. It can race on the track, race around the block, and handle Sunday drivers in comfort and style. It provides decent gas mileage: 18 miles per gallon city and 25 mpg on the highway with premium gasoline, and just feels right.\n\nThe downside\n\nThere are some downsides. The second row makes this car more of a 2+2 instead of a four-passenger coupe. Children might be able to fit in the back, but why anyone would want to put a child in this car is beyond me. Some things were just meant for grownups and the 911 S is one of them. Though if you have a child, naming her Carrera would certainly be better than Mercedes.\n\nThe car also has lots of road noise leaking into it at high speeds, but that’s also because I was traveling at very high speeds. The 235-watt stereo can cancel out that noise.\n\nWhen you drive the 911 S, however, you don’t want to listen to anything but the engine — the rhythmic sounds of driving the rpm higher, shifting gears, and then doing it all over again. It’s a modern-day Wagner. Pure Rheingold.\n\nThe only way to understand this is to drive one. The mystique is real, it’s deserving, it’s Porsche. And now that I’ve finally driven one, I must hold my breath until I get to do it again.\n\nSburgess@detnews.com (313) 223-3217",

      "expert_review": "We were coming into a sharp left-hand turn on a narrow two-lane road, the Porsche 911’s flat-six-cylinder engine singing sweetly, when I noticed a little problem just ahead.\n\nA mess of gravel and dirt was spewed on the blacktop, the kind of stuff that can slide a $90,000 sports car into the guardrail.\n\nI turned in and eased on the brake, hoping for the best. But sure enough, the brilliantly engineered Porsche took over and saved the day. Aside from superb handling and balance, electronic systems such as Porsche Stability Management, antilock brakes, and variable-ratio power steering helped ease the rear-engine car through the messy turn with easy grace.\n\nI was impressed. So was my passenger, once he opened his eyes again.\n\nYou gotta love this car. Now in its sixth generation, the Porsche 911 Carrera is perhaps the purest and most joyful form of performance sports car. With almost metaphysical agility and power, 911 remains a driver’s car of the highest order.\n\nPorsche has kept the faith for more than 40 years with the rear-engine layout and signature styling, instantly recognizable despite evolutionary changes through the decades. Although no longer a simple, unembellished sports car with an air-cooled engine, the latest retains the raw excitement of the original, although at a premium price.\n\nI drove the latest Carrera Cabriolet, a ragtop that adds open-air enjoyment to the mix, and it delivered on Porsche’s promise of excellent fun without compromise.\n\nPERFORMANCE: The base Carrera has the least powerful engine of the 911 collection, but with 325 horsepower, there’s still a lot of kick for a car weighing just over 3,000 pounds. The 911 S ups the ante to 355 horses, and the Turbo model, well, that boosts it to a wild 480. The flat-six engine, with cylinders that lie on either side of the crankshaft, revs smoothly as it propels the 911 with muscular acceleration and solid response. The six-speed manual transmission shifts with easy precision. A Tiptronic automatic is available. The test car had a heavy feel to the clutch, though that could have been from thousands of miles of rough abuse by previous journalist drivers.\n\nDRIVABILITY: This agile and responsive craft can fool you into thinking you’re some kind of Michael Schumacher Formula 1 driver. Twisty back roads become a playground, with the Porsche nosing in eagerly for every turn. Steering is wonderfully responsive, and the brakes are amazing.\n\nSTYLING: Though I prefer the style of the classic coupe, the convertible looks great and has the huge advantage of open-air motoring. Top up, the cabin feels slightly claustrophobic with poor visibility to the rear. Trunk space up front is surprisingly roomy, enough for actual luggage if you pack light.\n\nINTERIOR: The simple, businesslike interior remains comfortable and accommodating, though the switches are fussy and small. The key remains in its traditional Porsche location on the left. The vestigial backseat is a signature feature of 911, too small for anything but a pampered pet Pekinese. The stiffly bolstered driver seat feels too narrow.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: More a luxury grand tourer these days than a hardcore sports car, Porsche’s flagship 911 is still an amazing (and expensive) leather-lined beast, and it carries on its storied legacy.\n\nVersus the competition: Porsche’s latest 911 Turbo aims for models like the Mercedes-AMG GT and the Bentley Continental GT — super-expensive personal luxury coupes that also happen to be blisteringly quick; if you’re looking for a more track-oriented sports car, there are better versions of the 911 to consider.\n\nYou just have to love the Porsche 911. For decades now, few vehicles on the planet could claim such a single-minded purpose — a mission so dedicated they’ve barely wavered since their introduction. But in the wake of a massive, global consumer shift toward tall-riding wagons masquerading as all-purpose off-road vehicles, the 911 stands firm as a purpose-built sports machine. It seats two comfortably (four in your dreams), with state-of-the-art suspension technology, exceptional handling and looks that are immediately recognizable a mile away.\n\nRelated: 2021 Porsche 911 Targa 4 Review: All the 911 Goodness, Just Breezier\n\nOne of the beautiful things about the 911 is that there are a dozen different models and trims to choose from: Do you want a luxury grand touring machine or a razor-sharp, track-focused race car? The model I drove was the new Turbo, which was the 911’s top performance trim a long time ago but has now become something a bit more like a prestige GT, facing off against other super-expensive luxury grand touring coupes like the Mercedes-AMG GT or the Bentley Continental GT. It’s still blisteringly fast and chock-full of technology aimed at making average Joes feel like racetrack heroes, but the point of this new Turbo seems to be filling the role of civilized gentleperson’s tourer. So how does it do in this role? \n\nA Shape for the Ages\n\nThere’s almost no reason to talk about the way the Porsche 911 Turbo looks; every successive version is just a slight modification of the prior one, and that’s been the case since its inception. It gets a bit bigger with each generation, a bit smoother and sometimes it incorporates new tech, like LED lights or active aerodynamics. Park a 2021 911 next to the original, though, and the family lineage will be blatantly clear. \n\nThat’s not a bad thing. There are few truly iconic shapes in automotivedom, but the 911’s is most certainly one of them. The latest version has a few body modifications versus the old one that result from the model’s bigger changes, which happen under the hood. Turbo versions are always wider than lesser 911 Carrera models, but this new Turbo is even wider than the previous one. All four fenders cover a wider track, front and rear, and the traditional vent openings in the rear fenders have a new purpose: They no longer draw in cooling air (that now happens via a new vent on the decklid below the rear window), they draw in “process air” meant for other purposes, Porsche says. \n\nMore Punch Than the Last Turbo\n\nThe biggest change for the ’21 model year is the 3.8-liter boxer six-cylinder engine, which now makes 572 horsepower and 553 pounds-feet of torque. That’s a boost of 32 hp over the old car, and Porsche says it makes this 911 Turbo nearly as powerful — and just as quick — as the 2019 Porsche 911 Turbo S. (A new Turbo S is on the way, and it promises to be even quicker and more powerful than the ’21 Turbo.) \n\nGiven we live in a world of 700-plus-hp cars that can be bought for a relative song, 572 hp somehow no longer seems like an extraordinary achievement, but it’s all in how you use it — and the 911 Turbo uses it quite well. Porsche says it makes the 0-60 mph sprint in just 2.7 seconds — 0.2 second faster than the prior Turbo. But let’s be real here: That kind of improvement is really just semantics and bragging rights. Your seat-of-the-pants meter is not going to register a 0.2-second difference between two vehicles, even if you drive them back-to-back. \n\nThe engine is mated to an eight-speed PDK dual-clutch transmission. It’s the only one available — no manual transmission here — which feels like yet another concession to the Turbo being more of an everyday commuter than an enthusiast’s toy. The transmission, however, is just as well executed as the rest of the car: intuitive, well matched to the engine, adjustable via various modes and always ready to dance. Suffice to say the Turbo’s acceleration is absolutely mind-blowing. A jab at the throttle in any of the car’s sport modes will snap your head back and take your breath away. There’s also a dedicated button on the steering wheel that activates a brief switch into the car’s most aggressive settings for a sudden burst of performance, and it’s too much fun not to push it on a regular basis. My only complaint is that this control should be bright red, not black plastic; drivers need some warning as to what they’re about to experience. \n\nAs with all modern 911s, the Turbo’s steering is practically flawless. It provides just enough boost not to be heavy and just enough feedback to tell you what’s going on. It helps secure the Turbo’s status as a brilliant road car.\n\nI love how you can feel things working in the Porsche 911. Piloting the Turbo along one of Michigan’s terribly maintained but entertaining switchbacks (yes, we do have a few), I could feel the suspension working to keep the car on course with minimal drama. The steering wheel communicates what the tire is rolling over, your rear end feels muted bumps through the very comfortable but still supportive sport seats, and you notice that the motions of the car don’t match the terrain exactly — meaning Porsche’s magical suspension management system is doing its job. \n\nThe Turbo is an absolute joy to drive: smooth, fast and incredibly forgiving for amateur drivers, yet rewarding for seasoned professionals. Its electronic minders will help beginners feel like advanced racers while working to keep them out of trouble should they get in over their heads. Of course, most of these electronic minders can be deactivated, but do so at your own risk. The 911 Turbo isn’t a sports car, it’s a supercar — with all the speed and potential for danger that entails. \n\nReally, though, despite its incredible abilities — and even a package that includes an electronic lap timer — this latest Turbo isn’t aimed at track day enthusiasts. It’s a grand touring personal performance coupe aimed more at wealthy buyers looking for a prestige model than at weekend track warriors. (For those drivers, Porsche makes models like the latest GT3, which is a street-going race car that’s more expensive and provides a far more visceral experience than the cushy Turbo.) Not everyone wants a race car, and for folks whose goal is to use a beautifully balanced personal coupe for their commute to the office and occasionally blast it through early-morning canyons, this Turbo delivers in spades. \n\nThe Posh Experience\n\nWith a price approaching nearly 200 kilodollars, you’d expect the interior of the 911 Turbo to be opulent — and you’d be mostly correct. The interior is constructed out of some very nice materials (despite some questionable, highly reflective shiny black plastic on the center console), but what you’re paying for isn’t exclusive wood or exotic animal hides, it’s the ability to customize the interior to your exact whims — to cover just about every piece of the interior in leather, or paint special trim pieces however you like, or even specify what paint color you want it all done up in, inside and out. That level of personalization is horribly expensive, as it requires interruption of the production line and staggering part-number complexity, and it’s why you’ll never see this level of personal preference available on something like a mass-produced Toyota Corolla. But go explore the build configurator on Porsche’s website and you’ll see just how much personalization is possible with a 911.\n\nWe first experienced the latest 911 in the new Targa version, and the Turbo’s interior isn’t all that different. It’s comfortable, with plenty of room for two, and features much easier ingress and egress than other cars in this price category. The binnacle in front of the driver still houses Porsche’s classic five-gauge cluster, but only the centered tachometer is still an actual gauge; much of the rest of it is digital and reconfigurable, but it’s all very well done and super-clear. The central multimedia screen is on the small side of modern systems, but that’s also acceptable; the point of getting a Porsche 911 is to drive it, not screw around with ancillary concierge features while blasting down the autobahn. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are present, but the Turbo’s small screen does squish a lot of their features down more than usual. \n\nOne area where Porsche deserves as much praise as we can heap upon it is in the car’s various buttons and controls. There are a lot of them scattered around the cockpit, but at least they’re actual buttons and toggle controls. There are no touch-sensitive surfaces in here (as you’ll find in the Porsche Taycan EV), and that’s a very good thing. It enables you to learn where the controls are and then operate them by touch, without needing to remove your eyes from the road to check if you’ve touched the right spot on a screen hard enough to do whatever it is you’re trying to do. We desperately hope Porsche continues to resist following this German automaker trend into the 911, but we won’t be holding our breath. \n\nAs with other Porsche 911s, a couple of noteworthy areas come to mind. The first is the frunk — the storage space up front that serves as the 911’s cargo area. It’s plenty big enough for larger roll-aboard bags or soft-sided duffels. Combine it with the second space that comes to mind — Porsche calls it a backseat, we’ll call it the space behind the rear seats — and you have plenty of room to pack for a weekend away for two. Porsche offers a Lightweight Package option on the 911 that eliminates these two vestigial seats, and I’d heartily recommend selecting it. You’ll never fit anyone back there anyway; the space makes a lot more sense as a cargo bench than a backseat. That package also includes carbon-fiber seats, a carbon roof and lightweight glass for a bit of extra racing cred.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2020 Porsche 911 Review: Is There Such a Thing as Too Good?\n2021 Porsche 911 Turbo: Not Quite the Turbo S, Still Quite the Sports Car\n2021 Porsche 911 Turbo S: 911’s Next Top Model\nWhich Convertibles Have AWD for 2020?\nMore Porsche News\nPriced to Maintain Exclusivity\n\nThe 911 has come to be as much a status symbol as a track weapon, and its pricing has reflected that for some time now. The 2021 Turbo coupe starts at $172,150 (including destination), while the cabriolet begins at $184,950. And given very few Porsches escape the dealership without options, you can expect your car’s price to go north of that. My test vehicle pictured here rang in at a lightly optioned $180,130 thanks to having just a few ticks on the options sheet. Those included a $2,770 front-end lift system for going over obstacles, like parking lot speed bumps or steep driveway transitions, as well as the $1,510 Porsche Active Suspension Management system,  ventilated, 18-way power sport seats ($1,990), and a few other odds and ends. It should be noted that this sum also includes a $1,000 gas-guzzler tax, a result of the Turbo’s less-than-stellar EPA fuel economy estimates (15/20/17 mpg city/highway/combined). \n\nStart playing hot and heavy with the Turbo’s option sheet and its custom colors and interiors, and you can quickly go well beyond the $200,000 mark — Bentley Continental GT territory. A Mercedes-AMG GT C Coupe starts a bit lower than the 911 Turbo, at $154,550, but quickly builds to a competitive price once you start adding options. These are rare, exclusive machines made for well-heeled buyers who are willing to pay such prices, so calling them too expensive is inaccurate; they’re appropriately priced for their market. \n\nThe new 2021 Porsche 911 Turbo is a fantastic machine, an everyday-usable supercar that builds upon decades of heritage and legacy — and successfully maintains that mystique for its loyal buyers. The latest version has made it even more of an icon. Even if it does comes slathered in leather and comfort, with layers of technology sandwiched between the driver and the road, it still satisfies in ways only a Porsche 911 Turbo can. \n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "You may recall from your psychology classes the name Harry Harlow, a controversial researcher known for his wire monkey-surrogate mother experiments. One group of baby rhesus monkeys was taken away from its mothers and given a maternal figure made of terry cloth; another group was given a figure made of just bare wire. These experiments demonstrated the famous Harry-Harlow-was-a-toolbag principle.\n\nIn Porsche’s laboratory, the relatively luxe 911 Turbo (what with its padded seats and all) is the terry-cloth monkey and the new GT2 — stripped utterly to its essentials, inhospitable, a harsh mockery of the comforts of the automobile — is the wire monkey. To love the GT2 is to embrace its malign indifference to your well-being. To cuddle one is to feel the cold bite of steel against your cheek. Mommy, why won’t you hold me?\n\nBasically a Porsche Motorsport version of the 911 Turbo (or turbocharged version of the track-ready GT3 RS, if you like), the GT2 is the most hard-core 911 ever to wear a license plate and the first production 911 to exceed 200 mph. Because, obviously, the Turbo’s 480 hp is too, too paltry for real Porsche men, the boys in Weissach kicked up the output another 50 hp, with highly capacious intake manifolds and titanium exhaust plumbing on either side of the turbochargers. Lift the engine lid and all you see are the car’s enormous lungs ducted from air intakes integrated into the dual-foil spoiler, which looks like something Klingons would carry into battle.\n\nThe GT2’s steroid regime also includes lots of good old hot-rodding. The Turbo’s all-wheel-drive system is jettisoned in favor of a lighter and racier rear-wheel transaxle shared with the GT3 RS. Also shared with the GT3 are the phenomenal 15-inch carbon ceramic front disc brakes and fully adjustable suspension inspired by the paint-shaking machine at Home Depot. The GT2’s lightweighting program concludes with ditching the rear seats, tossing out all the sound-deadening material, stripping some interior panels to bare carbon fiber and supplanting the front seats with leather-lined carbon shells padded with . . . well, nothing. The resulting car (3,270 pounds) is 225 pounds lighter than the 911 Turbo and is about as cozy as an MRI machine.\n\nAnd yet I find it hilarious that Porsche, having thus perverted the car’s power-to-weight ratio, chose to retain the two swing-arm cup holders. This begs the question: What the hell is in the cups?\n\nMy guess is money: The GT2 retails for a not-insubstantial $192,560. Yes, it offers performance at or above the best supercars in the world; yes, it comes with the finest pedigree in all of motorsports. But 200 grand for a 911? I will talk more about the price later when I address the fewer than 200 or so trustafarians in the U.S. who might be inclined to pony up for the GT2.\n\nFrom the extraneous metaphor file: The GT2 is like lighting a cigarette on an erupting volcano. It’s like cutting a line out of a kilo of cocaine and then snorting the kilo.\n\nThis car is quite simply insane and, frankly, kind of scary, not because of any dynamic flaw but because of the way the stupendous forces in hand are delivered with such seeming effortlessness. To begin with, everything is ultra-hard: the seats, the suspension, the steering and brakes, the monocoque chassis that feels made entirely of Higgs bosons. All the slack, wobble and flex has been scourged from the car, leaving — as the only tactile source of elasticity — the throttle.\n\nThe gestalt of the car, then, is of something enormously powerful but also very locked down and secure, some giant in chains. Squeeze the gas and ramp up to redline in the first three gears (you’ll be well in excess of 100 mph when you do) and the car feels totally untroubled. It feels alert, yes, awake, certainly — and the deep chortle and hiss of the turbocharged engine is something out of Dante. But the GT2 gives off almost none of the clues that provide a frame of reference, no early warning system that you’re going too fast. I mean, it has a speedometer, but who ever looks at those?\n\nHere I will defer with thanks and praise to the boffins at Motor Trend, whose instrumented testing of the GT2 (the same car I drove) recorded a 0-60 mph acceleration of 3.4 seconds and a quarter-mile time of 11.4 seconds. Both of those numbers put the GT2 in the ranks of Ferrari Enzos and Koenigsegg CCXs and Pagani Zondas and a few other cars you’ve never heard of. And yet the salient figure from Motor Trend’s tests is the trap speed: At the end of the quarter-mile, the GT2 can be traveling at 127.4 miles per hour. From there it’s a short and exhilarating escalator ride to over 200 mph.\n\nLet me unpack those numbers for you. It means that when you jump on the GT2’s throttle — something you’ll be sorely tempted to do — it practically explodes in a furious, jaw-slacking, gut-churning hullabaloo of weapons-grade torque such that accelerating from 60 to 120 mph takes one gearshift and a few scant seconds. This, to state the obvious, is kind of fun. But it’s the sort of performance you dare not access on the street. Drivers a half-mile ahead can dutifully check their mirrors before changing lanes, and in the time it takes to signal and turn the wheel, the GT2 can materialize beside them like it’s dropping out of hyperspace.\n\nUnfortunately, the 405 Freeway does not connect to the Autobahn. The trouble with the GT2 is that it feels so unfulfilled driven at regular speeds. Indeed, this is a problem with most supercars: The suspension and brakes, the steering and engine aren’t being at all taxed by the velocities and forces invoked by just muttering up the Angeles Crest Highway. But this sensation is particularly acute with the GT2, which is a thoroughbred race car. To get the GT2 to really harmonize, to come into itself dynamically, you have to go at it really hard, and that is simply too dangerous on the street. Not that the car is undriveable; on the contrary, it’s as complaisant and tractable as any other 911. The engine’s got loads of low-end torque; the controls aren’t really race-car heavy. It’s even got a decent nav and audio system. But the overwhelming sense of the car is one of deep, almost painful frustration.\n\nThis brings me to a truism, a Zen koan of automobility: It’s more fun to go fast in a slow car than slow in a fast car.\n\nWhom is this car for? First, it’s for extremely well-heeled club-racing enthusiasts, who will weep with joy behind the wheel. Second, it’s for organizations like Motor Trend that have independently verified the car’s astonishing — though kind of irrelevant — 0-60 mph acceleration. The GT2 marks the first appearance of Porsche’s launch control system that goes by the hilarious euphemism of “Start-off Assist.” The way it works is this: Toggle through the menu on the instrument panel until the boost gauge is displayed. Put the car in first gear, rev to about 5,000 rpm (or 14 pounds of boost) and drop the clutch. The system automatically feathers the throttle to maximize grip and hole-shot acceleration. For a similar sensation, put a rodeo barrel on a train track, climb in and wait.\n\nThere’s a charming note in the owners manual that says, basically, use of Start-Off Assist will considerably shorten the life of certain driveline components. No duh.\n\nIn any event, the GT2’s 0-60 mph number is pure marketing, the glowing numerical nimbus of incomparable performance around this, Porsche’s halo car. Nobody who owns this car is going to be flogging it at Irwindale Speedway on test-and-tune night — like I did (sorry, Porsche).\n\nIt ain’t me, babe. I continue to love the 911 Turbo, with its all-wheel drive and available automatic transmission, comfy seats, compliant suspension and proper upholstery. The Turbo churns up virtually all of the same Porsche-brand adrenaline while still being livable and lovable. So it only goes 0-60 mph in 3.6 seconds. So it only goes 190 mph. Call me a wuss.\n\nThe GT2 is too bad a monkey for me.\n\ndan.neil@latimes.com",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in June 2013 about the 2013 Porsche 911. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2014, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe 2013 Porsche 911 is a civilized sports car that embraces the needs of both luxury- and performance-minded car buyers in a way that prior generations never have.\n\nAll you need is a wide-open wallet.\n\nA redesigned 911 debuted as a 2012 model and, as is Porsche tradition, additional variants have begun to appear in subsequent model years. Our test car, a 911 Carrera 4S Cabriolet (convertible), is one of those variants. This version is fitted with all-wheel drive and a more powerful flat-six engine and starts at a lofty $118,480, including a $950 destination charge. A staggering $28,695 worth of optional features (see them all by clicking here) made the as-tested price swell to $147,175. Prime competitors include the Audi R8, BMW M6 and Jaguar XKR, all of which also come as both coupes and convertibles; to see these cars’ specs compared with the 911, click here.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe 911 driving experience — especially in convertible form with the top down — is all about engaging your senses. From the distinctive turbinelike whine of the rear-mounted flat-six engine to the way the car feels on different road surfaces, the 911 is a machine that’s always communicating with you. It refreshingly embraces its sounds in an era when other luxury performance cars try to mute them.\n\nThe most surprising thing about the 911 is how workable it is as an everyday car. In the car’s regular or Sport modes, ride quality is firm but livable; it didn’t beat me up when commuting on some less-than-smooth surfaces. That changes when you choose the optional Sport Plus setting, which firms up the ride considerably. On Chicago’s beat-up post-winter roads, it didn’t take long to grow weary of this setting.\n\nWhat isn’t tiresome about Sport Plus is the rev-matching feature for the seven-speed — yes, seven-speed — manual transmission. It makes you look like a pro even if you’re not trying, by automatically blipping the throttle on downshifts to perfectly match engine rpm to the new gear. The gas pedal is responsive enough in normal mode and more immediate in Sport, so it isn’t hard to match revs on your own, but it is hard to beat the automated system’s consistency, shift after shift.\n\nThe other thing that doesn’t get old is the optional sport exhaust, which opens a freer-flowing path for exhaust gases in Sport and Sport Plus modes. The resulting sound is deep with plenty of burbles, and there’s enough crackling and popping when decelerating to bring a smile to your face. It’s quite a bit different from the sport exhaust’s regular mode, where you hear more of the turbinelike engine sound than the exhaust rumble.\n\nWith a 400-horsepower, 3.8-liter flat-six engine driving all four wheels, the 911 4S Cabriolet builds speed quickly — and sounds great in the process. With the seven-speed manual, Porsche cites a zero-to-60-mph time of 4.5 seconds. The available seven-speed double-clutch automatic transmission is even quicker to 60 mph, taking just 4.3 seconds — or 4.1 seconds with the optional Sport Chrono Package. With the majority of engine torque directed to the rear wheels on dry roads, the 911 4S Cabriolet feels and behaves like a sure-footed rear-wheel-drive car.\n\nWhether you get the manual or dual-clutch gearbox, the transmissions’ seven speeds contribute to respectable gas mileage for a sports car. With the manual, the 911 4S Cabriolet gets an EPA-estimated 18/26 mpg city/highway, and the dual-clutch transmission gains 1 mpg extra in city driving for a 19/26 mpg rating.\n\nWith a driving experience that’s so sensory, the one aspect that’s a little diluted is the steering setup. While precise and responsive, the electromechanical system doesn’t provide the kind of steering feedback we’re used to from Porsche. It’s been filtered out to a large degree, and the steering is quite a bit lighter than you might expect, though our test car had the optional Power Steering Plus, which provides more steering assistance when traveling below 31 mph. At a minimum, there needs to be a mode with demonstrably less assist, perhaps tied to the Sport or Sport Plus modes.\n\nLuxury-Oriented Cabin\nDespite their premium pricing, Porsche interiors aren’t known for being especially luxurious, and for some time the 911 was no exception. That began to change with the introduction of the Panamera sedan a few years ago, and the theme of high-end finishes has since spread throughout the lineup, with the 911 getting its own luxury-oriented theme with its 2012 redesign. Though the cabin has a function-oriented layout, upscale materials on the doors and dashboard help justify the purchase price, where the prior-generation 911’s interior failed to do so.\n\nOne of the best changes to the new 911 is the driving position, which I found much more comfortable compared with the prior-gen car. The front-seat cushioning is among the firmest you’ll find in a passenger car, but the support is appreciated when working the manual transmission’s firm clutch pedal, which will give your leg a workout in stop-and-go traffic.\n\nI wasn’t thrilled, however, with the location of the 911’s various performance-oriented buttons, like the ones for Sport, Sport Plus and the sport exhaust. They’re clustered together near your hip on the center console, which means you have to look down and away from the road to use them — not something you want to be doing when driving at a good clip. It’d make a lot of sense to put them on the steering wheel within easy reach of your hands, especially because there were no buttons — not even audio controls — on our test car’s SportDesign steering wheel, which is a $250 option.\n\nConvertible Commentary\nOne of the great things about the convertible version of the 911 is that it lets you more fully experience the mechanical symphony happening behind your head when you lower the power soft-top, which takes about 18 seconds. It takes a little less time — about 16 seconds — for the top to go back up, and once it’s raised the cabin is pretty quiet when cruising at highway speeds, with just some mild tire noise. (We tested the 911 4S Cabriolet in the springtime, but it was still fitted with a set of winter tires, so we don’t know how the regular tires sound.) The fully automatic soft-top works at speeds up to 31 mph, Porsche says.\n\nThe other thing that’s powered is a wind deflector that motors out from the rear of the passenger compartment, covering the two rear seats, at the push of a button. Manual wind blockers tend to be a nightmare to install; they’re a kind of automotive origami that’s typically more trouble than it’s worth, and I suspect quite a few are collecting dust in garages the world over. The 911’s powered one, in contrast, is so simple to operate that you’ll probably use it quite a bit.\n\nWith the screen deployed, there isn’t any buffeting at highway speeds with the top down — even with the side windows lowered. It’s just mildly breezy. The screen completely covers the rear seats, but as actual places for sitting, these seats are highly suspect to begin with: The cushions are tiny and the backrest is vertical.\n\nTop-up visibility is limited in a few directions, primarily when looking out the rear window or checking your right-side blind spot. Parking sensors give you a better feel for your surroundings, but I’m surprised our test car didn’t have a backup camera.\n\nAs convertibles go, the 911’s chassis is one of the stiffer ones out there, but I did drive some roads that made the car’s body shudder. A rough patch in the middle of a sweeping turn brought on some body flex, but there was less when the car met the same type of surface on a straightaway.\n\nSafety\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety haven’t crash-tested the 911, and the model’s comparatively low sales volume means it’s unlikely that the car will be tested in the future.\n\nSafety features include antilock brakes, an electronic stability system, traction control, seat-mounted side-impact airbags, door-mounted side curtain airbags designed to provide head protection, and pop-up roll bars behind the backseat that deploy if the car rolls over.\n\nFor a full list of safety features, check out the Features & Specs page.\n\n911 Carrera 4S Cabriolet in the Market\nThere aren’t many sports cars that have been around as long as the 911 — the car marks its 50th anniversary this year — and none that have stayed as true to the original’s formula. At the same time, Porsche has managed to transform the 911 into a modern sports car with the performance and amenities buyers expect. It’s an icon of the sports car world, and shoppers have responded to the latest generation in a big way: 911 sales were up 42 percent last year. After driving it, it’s easy to understand its appeal.\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nA 40th Anniversary Carrera coupe edition of Porsche’s long-lived 911 series is on sale for 2004. Only 1,963 will be built, and these versions will have an engine rated at 345 horsepower rather than the usual 320 hp. The 2004 Carrera 4S model is also available in Cabriolet (convertible) and coupe body styles. A Turbo Cabriolet has joined the lineup.\n\nPorsche’s lineup thus includes 11 versions: the rear-wheel-drive Carrera coupe, Targa coupe and Cabriolet; 40th Anniversary Carrera coupe; all-wheel-drive Carrera 4 Cabriolet; 4S coupe and 4S Cabriolet; all-wheel-drive Turbo coupe and Cabriolet; and the limited-production GT2 and GT3. (Skip to details on the: 911 Turbo | 911 GT2 | 911 GT3)\n\nThe Carrera 4S was “created in the image of the 911 Turbo,” said Porsche spokesman Robert Carlson. In fact, its basic body, suspension and all-wheel-drive system are shared with the Turbo.\n\nExterior\nNearly devoid of extraneous trim, the smooth-bodied 911 looks the part of a near-supercar. Even though the sleek, low, curvaceous shape has remained essentially the same since a redesign in 1999, the latest Carreras look more assertive. Each 911 has Turbo-like headlights and a wide rear-end panel above oval exhaust tailpipes.\n\nCabriolet models have a glass rear window and power-operated top. Carrera 4 convertibles include a removable hardtop. Targa coupes feature a sliding glass roof that’s twice the size of a customary sunroof. A sport suspension goes into the 40th Anniversary model.\n\nNew 4S options include an Aerokit and the Porsche Ceramic Composite Brake system. An automatic-deploying rear spoiler rises at 75 mph and lowers at 50 mph. Solid-spoke wheels on Carrera 4S models hold 18-inch tires. Other 911s have standard 17-inch tires, but 18-inch tires are offered as optional equipment.\n\nInterior\nCalled four-passenger automobiles by Porsche, 911s have plenty of space for front-seat occupants but backseat riders are in for a squeeze — especially in the convertibles. The driver faces a large tachometer and a three-spoke steering wheel, and the ignition switch is on the left. A locking glove box is included. Sport seats in dark gray leather and a numbered plaque go into 40th Anniversary models.\n\nUnder the Hood\nDubbed a “boxer” engine because of its horizontally opposed cylinder layout, the base 3.6-liter six-cylinder is mounted at the rear and develops 320 hp. The 40th Anniversary engine is rated at 345 hp. Each engine teams with a six-speed manual, and some can be fitted with an optional five-speed-automatic transmission. The automatic gearbox is fitted with Tiptronic S, which allows manual gear selection using steering-wheel buttons.\n\nSafety\nAll 911 models have side-impact airbags and all-disc antilock brakes. Supplemental safety bars pop out of the convertibles’ rear deck if sensors detect an impending rollover. Porsche Stability Management is standard or optional, depending on the model.\n\nDriving Impressions\nPiloting a Porsche 911 in any form is like savoring a legend. Recent models are comparatively easy to drive and quite civilized. They blend a reasonably smooth, extra-stable ride with vigorous performance and utmost handling talents. Even the familiar engine whine isn’t as omnipresent as it used to be, while the exhaust note is subdued yet exuberant. Porsche’s six-speed gearbox is as good as they get.\n\nWedded-to-the-road handling and directional stability are neatly enhanced by the Carrera 4’s all-wheel-drive system. Even though the highway ride is super, the 911’s suspension sometimes reacts harshly on rougher pavement. Acceleration is energetic in all six speeds, even without the Turbo. Snug seats fit many riders but may be disdained by some.\n\nRelated Model: 911 Turbo\nFor 2004, a Cabriolet joins the high-performance 911 Turbo lineup. The Turbo’s appearance is even bolder than the regular 911 and features a wider stance, especially at the rear. Three large intake grilles that send air to the Turbo’s three radiators dominate the lower front fascia. Air scoops integrated into the leading edges of the rear fenders channel air to intercoolers. A biplane, two-piece rear spoiler on the Turbo differs from that on other models and is supposed to enhance high-speed stability.\n\nTwin turbochargers in the 911 Turbo help its 3.6-liter six-cylinder engine crank out 415 hp and 415 pounds-feet of torque. An optional power kit boosts output to 450 hp. A six-speed-manual transmission and all-wheel drive are standard. A five-speed automatic with Porsche’s Tiptronic S system, which permits manual gear changes, is also available. Back to top\n\nRelated Model: 911 GT2\nDuring the 2002 model year, Porsche introduced the 911 GT2 — a new temptation to satisfy even the most power-frenzied sports-car enthusiasts. The 911 GT2 added a batch of racing-derived features to the 911 Turbo’s foundation and injected an extra 41 hp in the process. The rear-drive 911 GT2 also weighed about 220 pounds less than the Turbo, for a power-to-weight ratio of 6.8 pounds per horsepower.\n\nThis model’s 3.6-liter six-cylinder gains 21 hp for 2004; it is now rated at 477 hp. A modified six-speed-manual gearbox is the only available transmission. Suspension and brake tuning have been revised. Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes, which are optional on the 911 Turbo, are standard on the 911 GT2. This year, the GT2 gains new four-channel ABS 5.7 equipment. Porsche claims the 911 GT2 can accelerate from zero to 62 mph in approximately 4 seconds and achieve a top track speed of 198 mph.\n\nEven though the basic appearance of the 911 GT2 is similar to that of the 911 Turbo, several functional design changes are present. Front air intakes are larger, and distinctive air intakes sit ahead of the front hood. Back to top\n\nRelated Model: 911 GT3\nIntended as a limited-production 2004 model, the 911 GT3 was “created for Porsche driving purists,” said Peter Schwarzenbauer, Porsche Cars North America president and chief executive officer. Even though the coupe is “dedicated to high-performance driving, [it] can be driven on a daily basis.” Many electronic controls have been eliminated in the 911 GT3. Only a few hundred will be produced each year.\n\nEven though the basic shape of the 911 GT3 is similar to that of a conventional 911, a unique rear wing was designed to produce increased downforce in corners and enhance high-speed directional stability. The wheels are lighter and wider than usual and measure 18 inches in diameter. A redesigned front apron helps the 911 GT3 achieve a 0.30 coefficient of drag. A sport suspension is installed.\n\nThe GT3’s six-speed-manual gearbox incorporates transmission oil cooling and injection lubrication, as well as additional reinforcement. The front brakes use a six-piston design. A 3.6-liter flat-six engine produces 380 hp and 285 pounds-feet of torque — that’s sufficient to yield a 0-to-60-mph acceleration time of 4.3 seconds. Porsche says the 911 GT3’s top speed is 190 mph. Back to top",

      "expert_review": "Is the Porsche 911 a Good Car?\n\nWith shocking performance, near-perfect driver inputs and capability that far outstrips its model positioning, the refreshed 2025 911 Carrera S remains one of the most compelling and complete sports cars you can purchase that has a warranty.\n\nHow Does the Porsche 911 Compare With Other Sports Cars?\n\nLook for most to cross-shop the new 911 Carrera S against the Mercedes-AMG GT, Chevrolet Corvette Z06 and Aston Martin Vantage. Throw a dart — you simply can’t go wrong here — but the 2025 911 Carrera S offers one of the best balances of performance, refinement and usability.\n\nA $148,395 volume model? Such is the market right now when navigating the Porsche 911 lineup. Folks who can afford a new 911 like to load ‘em out, and the mid-tier Carrera S is often the first and final stop for a fiercely loyal subset of Porsche buyers. According to the German brand, 35% of all 911s sold in the U.S. are a Carrera S, accounting for 33% of all Carreras sold globally.\n\nRelated: 2025 Porsche 911 Carrera S Gets More Power, $148,395 Base Price\n\nWhat Is the 2025 Porsche 911 Carrera S?\n\nIf you understand any Carrera S from the 997 generation (2005-11 model years) on, understanding the new 992.2-generation 911 Carrera S is a cinch: Take the base Carrera and turn the performance dial up 15% to 35%, depending on the generation. In the 992.2, you’ll see a bigger leap than is historically expected, with the twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter flat-six-cylinder thrumming at 473 horsepower and 390 pounds-feet of torque, up 85 hp and 59 pounds-feet over the standard Carrera and Carrera T. That’s a big gulf considering the 992.1 generation (2020-24 model years) of the 911 Carrera S added 64 hp to the regular Carrera.\n\nThe rest of the refreshed Carrera S is familiar fare. Bigger brakes, louder exhaust, stiffer suspension, stickier tires and a spikier powertrain are all hallmarks of that “S” appendage, now further tweaked for the new generation. Porsche Active Suspension Management and Porsche Torque Vectoring Plus are standard, as is the sport exhaust. The optional PASM Sport suspension drops the ride height by nearly 0.4 inch, now without helper springs and incorporating damper tech from the prior GTS.\n\nSpeaking of the GTS, its big ol’ 16-inch front and 14.9-inch rear brake discs are now standard on the 2025 911 Carrera S, with carbon-ceramic discs as an option. Also optional is the trick rear-steer setup. This is also the first Carrera S you must fully untether from the corresponding GTS trim; the 2025 911 Carrera GTS’ 3.6-liter hybrid drivetrain is not only the first electrified production Porsche 911 in history, it’s also wholly distinct from the 3.0-liter hearts in the Carrera, Carrera T and Carrera S.\n\n911 Carrera S Vs. 911 Carrera GTS T-Hybrid\n\nSo, the family tree tessellates further. I’ve yet to drive that revolutionary GTS T-Hybrid, but I had the keys to the freshly squeezed Carrera S for an entire afternoon facing down nothing but a loop of California canyon road squiggling through the mountains north of San Diego. My first run was in a deep blue Carrera S Cabriolet; despite the 992.2 generation’s updates, the car remains intimately familiar, with the overwhelming majority of switchgear and cabin presentation carried over from the prior generation.\n\n… Only, it’s not exactly as I left it. The left-hand ignition is now a simple push-button toggle, a downgrade from the prior twist-start dongle that was at least a fun simulacrum of a key, itself a downgrade from the 991 generation’s (2012-19 model years) requirement of an inserted key fob. Forum folk are quite incensed by this but, eh, I’ve already wasted enough digital ink on this — who cares. If this is the carbon-fiber strand that broke the camel’s back, you weren’t in the market for a new 911 to begin with, and this is coming from one of the biggest Porsche obsessives you’ll meet.\n\nReturning motifs like the Braun-shaped gear selector are contrasted by concessions to modernity. The 992.2 standardizes lane departure steering assist, a tech antithetical to the very essence of the 911 that can, thankfully, be defeated quickly. And the driver’s display is now entirely digital, the 992.1’s partly analog readout replaced with pure, uncut electrons.\n\nHow Does the 2025 Porsche 911 Carrera S Drive?\n\nFrankly, I only noticed this change the following afternoon as I sifted through both product information and interior photos. It’s still very much a 992, and I was far too thrilled with the view out the front and the accelerative pressure on my chest to take note of the minutiae. Porsche claims a 0-60 mph scramble in 3.3 seconds for the Cabriolet and 3.1 seconds for the coupe, both absurd figures that snap into sharp relief the first time you hit that red “overtake” button on the steering-wheel-mounted drive selector.\n\nThe new Carrera S is, as far as I can tell, about as quick in a straight line as you’d ever need a sports car to be. It’s the perfect balance of satisfaction and stupefaction, quickly — and I mean quickly — reaching speeds that’d skip you straight to the backseat of the cop cruiser without utterly overwhelming the senses like the 911 Turbo. The S is supposed to be a simple step up in performance, but it makes the standard 911 Carrera feel like a base Boxster.\n\nWhile the speedo spins, you’ll crease your boots at that toe-curlin’ scream. The turbo 3.0-liter six-cylinder isn’t as sonorous as the two free-breathing 4.0-liter engines found elsewhere in Porsche’s family tree, but the S’ whistling, ripsaw rasp channels every bit of the flat-six’s high-strung, nitro-sewing-machine character. In the mountains, I set the dual-mode exhaust to wide open, spooking deer and trucks alike to the side of the pass.\n\nNaturally, it’s equally as satisfying and impressive to blast through a zag of tarmac as it is frustrating to write about considering each stint behind the wheel of a Carrera sees me invariably babbling with the same breathless chorus. No matter the configuration, a modern 911 is one of the most immediately confident and familiar driving experiences you can have, regardless of environment. The brake pedal bite, the accelerator response, the PDK dual-clutch transmission’s shift logic — it’s all nearly perfect.\n\nGrip is tremendous, buoyed in no small part by the gluey Pirelli P Zeroes, 245 width in front and 305 width for the rear. Front-end composure is some of the best in the business, allowing turn-in speeds and sharp directional changes that you swear would unsettle most other cars. There are faster cars than a 911, but there are none that are so effortlessly confident over a fast road.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nPurists’ Porsche: 911 Carrera T Returns for 2025\nPorsche Fills Out Performance 2025 911 Lineup With GT3 and GT3 Touring Package\n2025 Porsche 911 Gives One of Its Hottest Trims a Hybrid System\n2024 J.D. Power APEAL Study: Porsche, Mini Top List on Owner Satisfaction\nResearch the Porsche 911\nWhat’s the Difference Between a 911 Carrera Coupe and Cabriolet?\n\nThis was particularly true of the coupe. The Carrera S cabriolet (or any 911 cab, really) is about the best top-down motoring experience with a warranty that you can have for under $200,000 with what feels like 95% of the capability of the fixed-roof car, only with the slightest of cowl shake. My Guards Red coupe test car, on the other hand, was a missile thanks to the addition of the sport suspension and carbon-ceramic brakes. Dump the power wherever — on the straight, midcorner, anywhere — and the remarkable combination of torque vectoring, ceramic brakes and rear-axle steer lends preternatural levels of firepower containment, while that sport suspension sharpens a stick that could already split an atom.\n\nAll right, I’m getting a bit dramatic at this point, but it’s simply one of the most fulfilling and enjoyable new cars on offer today, even if you’ll have the devil’s own time keeping the purchase price under $150,000. Each time I approach any 911 positioned under the GT3, I forget my prior experience and believe there’s simply no way it could possibly meet expectations — and each time, I’m forced to write the same article.\n\nIt’s just that damn good.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nEditor’s note: What follows is preliminary information about the 2015 Porsche 911 Targa. Check back later for full details.\n\nIn the continuing and endless list of variants of Porsche’s venerable 911 sports car, the Targa model has always been an interesting choice. Not quite a convertible, not quite a coupe, it features a fixed rear wraparound glass window and a retractable roof panel to open up the cabin.ExteriorThe new 911 Targa looks mostly like the coupe, but the retractable top that slides down into the rear window creates a different greenhouse. Gone is the sweeping oval window opening along the car’s side, interrupted now by a metal hoop that stretches over the car like a roll bar. It’s brushed metal and accompanied by a wraparound rear window that takes away some of the 911’s fluidic grace and replaces it with a more upright profile.\n\nPress a button and the entire rear glass section lifts up to allow the roof panel to fold down behind the rear seats. Cargo room is unaffected, of course, as is the trunk up front; the 911 is a rear-engine sports car.InteriorThe passenger cabin of the 911 Targa is nearly identical to the coupe, with the exception of the aforementioned retractable top and wraparound rear window. It offers the same high-quality materials and construction, leather and real metal, and customization options that can add tens of thousands of dollars to the price tag.\nUnder the HoodThe Targa comes in two versions, and both feature standard all-wheel drive. The Targa 4 comes with a 3.4-liter boxer six-cylinder engine making 350 horsepower and 287 pounds-feet of torque, while the 4S ups that to a 3.8- liter boxer six that pumps out 400 hp and 325 pounds-feet of torque. Transmissions are a choice of a standard seven-speed manual or dual-clutch PDK automatic. With the PDK and optional Sport Chrono Package, Porsche says that the Targa 4 will do zero to 60 mph in 4.8 seconds, a time that drops to 4.2 seconds for the Targa 4S.\n\nBoth variants are expected to go on sale later this summer in the U.S. The starting price for the Targa 4 will be $102,595, while the Targa 4S will go for a cool $117,195, including destination fee.",

      "expert_review": "There is no vehicle that epitomizes the Porsche name more than the 911, and for 2017 the Carrera and Carrera S get significant updates, including new engines, updated styling and the addition of a standard adaptive suspension. Despite these updates, the 2017 edition is still the seventh generation, designated 991, which debuted in 2012. Compare the 2017 911 Carrera with the 2016 model here.\n\nToday, Porsche will sell you no less than 14 varieties of the 911, with different engines, different roofs (coupes and convertibles) and different drivetrains (rear- and all-wheel drive). I tested a base 911 Carrera with the lowest starting price of any 911: $90,450 (including a $1,050 destination charge). The top Turbo S Cabriolet with all-wheel drive costs more than twice as much.\n\nI was pleased to test a base model complete with a manual transmission, which is arguably the purest form of Porsche 911 you can buy now. My test car didn’t include any performance options, either, save a sport exhaust system that makes the new turbocharged flat-six engine sing. It gives 911s, even the Carrera S Cabriolet,  with the rear-engine, rear-wheel-drive setup a chance to shine and show how unique they are compared with the competition, which includes the Chevrolet Corvette, Mercedes-AMG GT and Audi TT RS (compare those cars side by side here).\n\nPerformance Upgrades\n\nAll Porsche 911 models now feature turbocharging, and in the case of the 911 Carrera, that means goodbye to the old 3.4-liter, naturally aspirated, horizontally opposed six-cylinder engine and hello to a twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter flat-6. The new engine makes 370 horsepower and 331 pounds-feet of torque, improvements of 20 hp and 44 pounds-feet over the old one.\n\nPorsche Adaptive Suspension Management is also standard equipment this year. It offers two settings for the suspension: Normal and Sport. Normal softens up the suspension for daily driving, while Sport firms up the shock absorbers to keep the car flat and stable in more aggressive driving.\n\nThe two transmission options carry over: a seven-speed manual and an optional seven-speed dual-clutch automatic; Porsche calls the automatic PDK, and it’s a $3,210 option. My test vehicle came with the manual, which is sublime. The shift action is especially satisfying, accompanied by a slight mechanical click. The very clear gates make it easy to find the gear you want. The clutch action is a bit heavy, with a high engagement point; it can make driving the 911 in traffic a bit of a chore, but it’s a joy to operate on open roads.\n\nFuel-economy estimates for the Porsche 911 Carrera are 20/29/23 mpg city/highway/combined with the manual transmission and 22/30/25 mpg with the automatic PDK. Premium gas is required.\n\nSublime Handling\n\nOlder Porsche 911 sports cars have a reputation for being a bit surly; having the engine in the rear puts a lot of weight on the rear tires, which can cause the back end to be twitchy when the car is pushed. I was prepared for that with the new version, as well, but was surprised to find that the car felt extremely planted. The adaptive suspension helps keep the car flat throughout and seems to help keep the nose of the car down, too. On corner entry, turn-in is sharp and abrupt, while the wide power band on the new engine (maximum torque is available from 1,700 to 5,000 rpm) makes it easy to keep the car in the power upon exit. The carbon-ceramic brakes don’t hurt.\n\nI’ve always preferred the Boxster/Cayman in a few ways, mostly because the mid-engine architecture in those cars gives them incredible balance. The Porsche 911 Carrera isn’t quite that, but it’s close — and pretty amazing.\n\nOne other bit of kudos to Porsche: It has the best electric power steering I’ve driven. This technology is widely used now, and with the old-school, hydraulic power-steering systems all but gone, Porsche’s effort is as close as you’ll get to replicating that feel. The typical complaint about these systems is that they’re too light, or that they’re heavy but don’t offer enough feedback. Not so here; I didn’t detect any vagueness, and the wheel was communicative about the status of the front wheels, which is very important on a car that’s so nose-light.\n\nMissing in Action\n\nMost of the cars we test are loaded, but my test vehicle in this instance was lightly optioned. Porsche does offer option packages, but almost all of its optional features can be had a la carte. The biggest addition to my test car was a $2,950 sport exhaust system that sounds amazing; I left it turned on pretty much all the time (sorry, neighbors). Also added to my tester were auto-dimming mirrors ($420), heated seats ($690), ventilated seats ($840), four-way powered sport seats ($800), a GT Sport steering wheel ($330) and, finally, seat belts in racing yellow ($540), which matched the screaming paint job on the exterior. That put the final price tag at $97,010.\n\nThere are aspects of this car that match its lofty price tag: Its performance credentials are unquestioned, and it drives and looks like something that costs nearly six figures. But if you’re looking for technology and safety features to match the price, you’ll be disappointed.\n\nThe first letdown is the multimedia system. For 2017, the Porsche 911 gets an updated system with a 7-inch touchscreen and navigation, but it’s also curiously missing some other options. It has Apple CarPlay but no Android Auto, so if you have an Android phone, you’ll be out of luck.\n\nSafety features are also surprisingly absent. There’s a backup camera as well as forward and rear parking sensors that help keep the 911’s low front splitter from hitting parking blocks or curbs, but there are no standard autonomous driver aids to speak of. Adaptive cruise control and automatic emergency braking are optional ($2,490 for both systems), as is a blind spot monitoring system ($850). Those feel like weird omissions from the 911’s standard equipment list given the direction more affordable cars are headed.\n\nCan It Be Practical?\n\nThe 911 Carrera and Carrera S are technically four-seaters, but the rear seats in these coupes are more like vestigial limbs than anything useful. I had to climb back there to take photos of the interior and I’m still trying to get the kinks out of my neck. There’s no real legroom to speak of, and the passenger seat’s head restraint (which can’t be adjusted) hits the roof when you tilt the backrest forward unless the seat has first been lowered to its very bottom setting and moved back. There are two sets of lower Latch anchors for child-safety seats back there, but good luck contorting yourself to get even the seat in, let alone a child.\n\nWith its rear-engined and rear-wheel design, the trunk is up front; it provides 5.12 cubic feet of space. That’s enough to fit one piece of checked luggage and not much else — any additional bags would have to go in the backseat, which has a bit more room than the trunk: 9.18 cubic feet.\n\nThis makes the Porsche 911 a bit more practical than a Boxster or Cayman, or some other two-seat sports cars. If you want to go golfing, though, nobody else can ride along because the clubs will be buckled into the front seat.\n\nIn the Market\n\nThe 2017 911 Carrera’s updates bolster its performance credentials, and the move to being turbocharged means a more responsive engine that makes more power than last year’s model. Yes, there are some weird quirks to the multimedia system, and this car doesn’t offer the latest in driver aids and autonomous safety features, but to me, those concerns are secondary. The primary reason to buy one of these expensive machines is how it drives: The Porsche 911 Carrera is an unflinching, wickedly fun ride.",

      "expert_review": "Recently, Porsche 911 Carrera buyers wanting all-wheel drive have faced a significant hurdle: AWD was only available on the GTS, the $200,000-plus Turbo and the even pricier Turbo S. While the newly hybridized GTS enjoys 532 horsepower, it’s also saddled with a base price over $170,000. Now, with the introduction of the 2026 911 Carrera 4S coupe, 911 Carrera 4S Cabriolet and 911 Targa 4S, Porsche is dropping the price of entry for an AWD 911 by thousands of dollars.\n\nRelated: 2025 Porsche 911 Carrera S Review: What More Could You Possibly Need?\n\nLike the S, But With a 4\n\nOther than the AWD system, the 2026 911 Carrera 4S family is identical to the rear-wheel-drive S models. They’re powered by a 473-hp, twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter flat-six-cylinder engine with 390 pounds-feet of torque. As with all other current 911s aside from the T and GT3, an eight-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission is standard. Porsche says the 4S coupe will accelerate from 0-60 mph in 3.1 seconds with launch control and the optional Sport Chrono Package on its way to a top speed of 191 mph.\n\nLike the regular 911 Carrera S lineup, the new 4S models ride on staggered wheels measuring 20 inches up front and 21 in the rear. A sport exhaust, 16.1-inch front and 15-inch rear brakes from the previous-generation 911 Carrera GTS are also standard. Rear-wheel steering is standard on the Targa, but it’s optional on the 4S coupe and convertible. Carbon-ceramic brakes and an adaptive sport suspension that lowers the ride height by nearly 0.4 inch are also available. As with other current 911s, the coupe can be had either as a two-seater or with a backseat for no extra cost; the Cabriolet and Targa include a rear seat as standard equipment.\n\nAvailability and Pricing\n\nPorsche says that, historically, AWD models account for about half of all 911 Carrera S sales. The 2026 911 4S models are available to order now, with deliveries to start in the fourth quarter of this year. Pricing has yet to be finalized and will be announced at a later date.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2025 Porsche 911 Carrera Cabriolet Review: Effortless Excellence\n2025 Porsche 911 Carrera S Gets More Power, $148,395 Base Price\n2025 Porsche 911 Gives One of Its Hottest Trims a Hybrid System\nWhat Is a Boxer Engine?\n2021 Porsche 911 Targa 4 Review: All the 911 Goodness, Just Breezier\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Legends regarding the “hounds of hell” have existed since Greek mythology, but I wasn’t entirely sure what their baying would sound like until the 2011 Porsche 911 Turbo S arrived: Punch the throttle, and there’s a pack of them right behind you, and the sound is both exhilarating and a little terrifying.\n\nThe all-wheel-drive Turbo S, with a twin-turbocharged, 3.8-liter six-cylinder engine that pumps out 530horsepower, can be as docile as a puppy when you cruise around town. But it comes with this evil, addictive feature called “launch control:” Find the nearest dragstrip – or in our case, a long private road owned by a friend – and come to a stop. Press the “sport plus” button, Place your left foot on the brake, and your right foot on the accelerator. Yes, all the way to the floor. Then take your left foot off the brake.\n\nThe Porsche, all four wheels clawing for traction, leaps forward like a pouncing cougar. The engine sounds like you are destroying it, and you’d think the double clutches in the transmission would fry like eggs on a Florida sidewalk, but there is no post-launch drama. This is what the Porsche 911 Turbo S is built to do, over and over if you like, and one reason it costs $162,460.\n\nIt is astounding how race-track-ready this Porsche is, despite the leather interior, Bose stereo, heated seats, power sunroof, navigation system, Bluetooth – anything you’d expect on a luxury car. By far the largest number of entries in sports car races like the Rolex 24 Hours of Daytona, or the 12 Hours of Sebring, are Porsche 911s. Years ago I track-tested a full-on Porsche race car that later sold for well over $1 million. After climbing into the single carbon fiber seat and cinching up all the safety belts, I asked, “Where is the starter button?” The crew chief said, “This is a Porsche. Turn the key.” That Porsche would put a key in a 200-mile-per-hour race car suggests how serious the company is about maintaining that narrow gap between race car and street car.\n\nThat said, what kind of street car does the Porsche 911 Turbo S make? Actually, a very good one. There’s a “Sport” and the aforementioned “Sport Plus” button, either of which stiffens up the suspension and places the transmission shift pattern into a nervous, edgy condition that makes around-town driving feel like you’ve had far too much caffeine. But on the regular setting, the 911 is docile and reasonably quiet, with a ride that is comfortable on all but the roughest roads.\n\nThe 911 has a rear seat, but I’ve yet to actually try and wedge anyone back there. It serves mostly as a convenient, extra storage space, complementing the 3.7-cubic-foot trunk up front. Raise the rear hatch and you’ll find that it’s quite full of engine.\n\nOne of the most interesting aspects of the car is the PDK transmission, which stands for Porsche Doppelkupplung, meaning it has a dual-clutch gearbox. It operates like a regular automatic transmission, but with the internal clutches, the sensation is very much like a manual transmission’s operation, but you don’t have to shift, and there is no clutch pedal. There are levers on the steering wheel that allow you to shift up and down manually, but the PDK is so competent and intuitive, I just let it shift for itself.\n\nThe list of performance features is long and complicated, and includes PASM – Porsche Active Suspension Management– a super-sophisticated system that makes split-second adjustments to the firmness of the suspension, based on what the onboard computer is telling it. The all-wheel-drive system is transparent, as it should be, in normal driving, but very evident in “launch control” mode. The huge ceramic composite disc brakes are incredible, and in concert with the massive 19-inch tires, make the 3,500-pound car feel like it weighs far less.\n\nBase price of the car was $160,700, and with heated seats ($525) and “Porsche crest on headrests” ($285), total price was $162,460, including shipping. This is a spare-no-expense car, and it feels like it.\n\nBut Porsche 911 turbo models hold an amazingthepercentage of their resale value for a very long time, and the 911 Turbo S is the sort of vehicle that I can envision crossing a collector-car auction block in 30 years, and selling for a sort of price a classic deserves. Is it expensive? Oh, my, yes. But when Porsche spares no expense in building it, they expect the handful of customers who can afford it to spare no expense, either. Good for them: They’re getting a remarkable car.\n\nSCSmith3@Tribune.com.\n\n2011 Porsche 911 Turbo S\n\nBase price: $160,700\n\nPrice as tested: $162,450\n\nEPA rating: 17 miles per gallon city driving, 25 mpg highway\n\nEngine: 3.8-liter, twin-turbocharged, 530-horsepower six-cylinder\n\nTransmission: Automatic\n\nLength: 176.3 inches\n\nWheelbase: 95.5 inches\n\nIn a nutshell: A future classic, and priced like it.",

      "expert_review": "Porsche took another step forward in its quest to catch Baskin-Robbins by offering more flavors of its 911 sports car. The latest addition is the 2018 911 Carrera T, which comes with weight savings and a familiar powertrain.\n\nRelated: 2018 Porsche 911 GT3: Great to Date, But Is It Monogamy Material?\n\nI headed to Napa Valley in Northern California to see if the Carrera T has anything unique to offer to the crowded 911 lineup. Per company policy, Cars.com pays for its own lodging and transportation to such automaker events.\n\nWhat Makes the 911 a T?\n\nThe Carrera T is based closely on the 911 Carrera coupe, but can be distinguished by a few visual touches including the “911 Carrera T” decal painted on the doors. The decal is in Agate Gray, which matches the side mirrors, rear logos and rear engine grille slats. The 20-inch wheels might look like Agate Gray but don’t be fooled! That’s Titanium Gray. Big difference.\n\nBesides the visual connection, they share many mechanical similarities. The 911 Carrera T has the same engine and transmission options, but is only offered in rear-wheel drive. Powering the T is is a twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter flat-six-cylinder engine that makes 370 horsepower and 331 pounds-feet of torque. It’s available with a standard seven-speed manual with some interesting changes for the 911 Carrera T, and Porsche’s seven-speed PDK dual-clutch automatic transmission that’s optional for an extra $3,730.\n\nThere are standard suspension upgrades on the Porsche 911 Carrera T you don’t get on the 911 Carrera, including the Porsche Active Suspension Management Sport suspension that lowers the car by 0.39 inch, the lightweight Sport Chrono Package and Porsche Torque Vectoring with a mechanical locking rear differential on manual transmission models. Rear axle steering is optional and not available on the 911 Carrera.\n\nCounting Calories\n\nThe Carrera T wears an interesting title: It is the lightest 911 you can buy, weighing in at 3,142 pounds with the seven-speed manual, thanks to slew of weight-saving changes. Those include reduced sound-deadening material, lighter door panels with fabric pulls instead of handles and lightweight glass in the rear and rear side windows.\n\nA quick note on that lightweight glass: It doesn’t have a rear defroster, but if that’s something you want/need, you can opt for regular glass, though it adds back almost 8 pounds.\n\nAdd it all up and you save … 11 pounds versus a 911 Carrera. However, Porsche says that if you added the mechanical features on the Carrera T (such as the PTV system with differential and the larger wheels) to the 911 Carrera, the weight difference would be about 45 pounds.\n\nThere’s also one last option for those wanting maximum weight savings: lightweight bucket seats made of carbon fiber reinforced plastic. This option also deletes the rear seats. This saves an additional 45 pounds for $5,200.\n\nBut Does It Make a Difference?\n\nThe “T” in the car’s name stands for “touring” and that matches how I’ve come to feel about the 911 Carrera. It’s an athletic car to be sure, but it’s most at home being driven on meandering country lanes rather than being pushed hard. This rings true for versions of the Carrera T that come with the PDK gearbox.\n\nAn automatic 911 T was the first version I tested and it also had rear-wheel steering. In this setup, you don’t catch the weight savings or benefits from the lowered suspension. Dynamically, it feels close to the 911 Carrera. The sport suspension adds a small bit of crispness, but the car still felt most comfortable on the portions of our drive that softly wound up the coast, rather than the parts with quicker corners and harder elevation changes.\n\nThe T’s cabin is noticeably louder — thinner glass and less sound-deadening material will do that. With the sport exhaust triggered it’s hard to have conversations in the cabin; however, the engine note is rather appealing, so just drive with someone who you don’t need to talk much.\n\nIn all, I didn’t get the appeal of the Carrera T at first. But then I drove the manual and flipped that notion on its head.\n\nIn the manual transmission 911 Carrera T, Porsche shortened the shifter’s throws and modified the constant transaxle ratio for improved acceleration. It also comes with PTV and that mechanically locking rear differential, two features missing on the automatic that may have helped put power down. My manual test car also came with the optional bucket seats, so it maxed out the lightness potential of the Porsche 911 Carrera T. This was as lean and mean as you can get the T to be — and it didn’t disappoint.\n\nThe car comes alive with the manual. The engine jumps up into the power quicker, and though the PDK is a better gearbox than I will ever be (machine is greater than man is this regard), the feeling of direct control over the gearing offers a greater sensation to the driver. Gear changes are fast and come with a satisfying (albeit inaudible) mechanical click when you pop the car into gear. It doesn’t get old.\n\nWith the engine freed thanks to the revised transaxle ratio, it also transforms the handling. Crank the Sport Chrono dial into Sport plus to maximize the suspension firmness, dial up the Sport mode on traction control and the 911 Carrera T with the manual corners with controlled brake precision. It allows for just a touch of wheel slip — a quick blip of the throttle rebalances the car, then launches it out of turns to hunt for the next one. After driving the manual, my confusion turned into something resembling joy.\n\n2018 Porsche 911 Carrera T | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\nGet the Manual Transmission\n\nThe difference in the car’s nature from automatic to manual was enough to completely reverse my position on the 911 Carrera T. It went from a more expensive version of the 911 Carrera that didn’t offer enough uniqueness to a rather different machine. The 911 Carrera T carries an $11,000 price premium over the 911 Carrera, starting at $103,150 (including destination charges). This starting price fits it in between the 911 Carrera and the 911 Carrera S, which is $3,000 more ($106,150).\n\nThe manual version of the Carrera T I tested came exactly how I would option it: rear-axle steering ($2,090), GT sport steering wheel and shift knob in Alcantara ($910), and the full bucket seats to save maximum weight ($5,200). That pushed the total price of the car to $111,350 (including destination charges).\n\nSo, if you’re looking for a lighter, more aggressive alternative to the Porsche 911, then the Porsche 911 Carrera T with that charged-up manual transmission fits the bill. But if the automatic is your cup of tea, stick with the 911 Carrera and save some money (along with your eardrums) .\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Many years ago, I stopped reading reviews of the Porsche 911, as they all seemed to be derived from the same common set of adjectives: It’s amazing, it’s incredible, it’s perfection incarnate, it’s the only sports car you’ll ever want or need — if you can afford one.\n\nBut then I got my chance to drive one. As cliche as it may sound, you never forget your first Porsche 911 experience. Mine came in 1996, and I stalled the thing repeatedly trying to get used to the motion of the floor-mounted clutch. Since then, I’ve lost count of the 911s I’ve been fortunate enough to pilot, but one thing sticks in my memory: They only keep getting better — and more expensive.\n\nThat Magic Moment\n\nSitting behind you in the surprisingly comfortable, perfectly sized cockpit of the 911 Turbo S is a twin-turbocharged 3.8-liter flat-six engine humming out 580 horsepower. That’s 40 hp more than the regular 911 Turbo, and it’s good enough to propel the Turbo S from zero-to-60 mph in just 2.8 seconds, Porsche says. All 911 Turbo models have the Sport Chrono Package standard for 2018, which is key to this performance. It involves four selectable modes that increase boost to the turbochargers, pumping torque up from the normal 516 pounds-feet to a peak of 553 pounds-feet. The mode selector has moved from the center console to a dedicated knob and button on the GT Sport steering wheel, which also now includes what all “Knight Rider” fans will recognize as a “Turbo Boost” button.\n\nThat magic little button in the center of a diminutive knob, called the Sport Response button, serves as a shot of adrenaline to the 911 Turbo S. Regardless of what mode you’re in (Normal, Sport or Individual) when you push it, the car instantly pops into Sport Plus mode for 20 seconds. The transmission and throttle program go into special aggressive modes, the suspension tightens up to its maximum setting, the steering firms up, the turbochargers undergo a number of temporary performance changes and the transmission drops a gear. This is perfect for the sudden urges you may feel when entering a highway on-ramp, or passing on a tight two-lane road with limited distance, or anywhere you decide you suddenly need racecar behavior right freakin’ now. At the end of your 20 seconds, which counts down on a timer on the dash, you return to whatever mode you were in before. It’s nothing short of absolutely thrilling. This is the giggle button.\n\nWithout all that crazy electronic boosting, the 911 Turbo S is calm and comfortable, a perfect grand tourer. You can drive it all day long at five-tenths effort and be rewarded with a stylish, sedate cruiser that won’t upset your mother-in-law if you bring her along for a ride. The ride is firm but not overly stiff, with the Porsche Active Suspension Management system doing an amazing job of damping out road imperfections despite its massive 20-inch wheels and performance-rated tires.\n\nThe only transmission offered in the Turbo S is the PDK dual-clutch automatic, which is fine. It shifts faster than any human can and seems to intuitively know what gear it needs to be in given the driver’s moment-by-moment demand. It only gets better and more tuned-in to what the driver wants as you move through various drive modes. Motive force is delivered to all four wheels through a standard all-wheel-drive system, which makes sense given the car’s prodigious power and rear-engine balance characteristics.\n\nA Classic Cabin Meets Today’s Tech\n\nThe exterior styling looks much as it has since the original 911, but the interior has shown more progress toward modernization. There are still some classic elements that remain, however: Five round gauges face you through the steering wheel, but one of them is now a digital screen that’s reconfigurable to a number of options, including a navigation screen, Sport Chrono timers, trip information and more.\n\nTo the right of that is a wide center console laden with buttons. There’s no touchscreen overload here; all the critical components, systems and gadgets have dedicated buttons, but they’re arranged in a way that makes it easy to find what you need. Nothing is hidden from view or hard to find. There are, however, a number of dead switch blanks — glaring reminders that despite the fact that you’re piloting a $200,000 car, there are still options you’re not getting. The blanks are artfully integrated into the center console in a way that tries to minimize their omission, but it’s still a painful reminder that Porsche makes almost all its options an a la carte affair.\n\nTo that point, it’s also astonishing that there are basic items this car doesn’t come with, such as keyless entry and push-button start. You still need to dig a fob out of your pocket to unlock the doors, then insert that key into the dash and twist to start the engine. In a vehicle this new — which includes a fully updated multimedia touchscreen equipped with Apple CarPlay — this is a bizarre omission, but one that’s indicative of Porsche’s longtime philosophy of extreme customization. You can order just about any Porsche exactly how you want it, down to the minutiae of the options list. It’s one of the reasons Porsches are so expensive — a staggering number of build combinations introduces expensive complexity in the factory, and that cost is passed on to consumers.\n\nAside from the quirks of the build sheet, the 911’s interior is comfortable and decently spacious, and it features excellent outward visibility. Yes, you sit low in the car, which can make for some difficulty seeing overhead stoplights if you creep forward too far at intersections, but the relatively upright windshield and large side windows help maximize your view forward better than competitors like the Mercedes-AMG GT or Jaguar F-Type. Craftsmanship is excellent, materials quality is outstanding, and all the buttons and switches move with typical German precision. There’s a delicate quality to much of the interior, a sense that the size of the controls has been optimized for space and weight. Even the steering wheel feels tidy compared with monsters like the AMG GT. The rim is thin, the spokes seem minimalist and even the overall diameter seems more compact than most competitors. It lends to the overall sports car feel of the 911 and gives you a sense that function was weighted equally with form in its design.\n\nFront-seat comfort is excellent, and ingress and egress isn’t much of a challenge despite the car’s low stance. The backseat is best described as “vestigial” — it’s not suitable even for children, as any child small enough to fit there should instead be buckled into a child-safety seat. The 911 is a 2+2, definitely not a four-seater, despite how many seat belts there are.\n\nTrunk space is acceptable for a car like this, with a deep well up front that can accommodate a single big roll-aboard suitcase or a couple of duffels. The space behind the front seats doubles as a useful storage area for parcels, but there’s a distinct lack of storage space for things like personal electronics. As with previous 911s, the cupholders are an afterthought — fold-out affairs stored in the passenger-side dashboard that look about as sturdy as a plastic lawn chair. I certainly wouldn’t put an open beverage in them, precariously perched several inches above the center console.\n\nLimited Safety, for a Price\n\nNearly all the extra safety systems beyond the required antilock brakes and stability control are extra-cost items on the 911 Turbo S. Adaptive cruise control and blind spot warning aren’t standard even at this top trim level, and features like autonomous braking with pedestrian warning and lane keep assist aren’t even offered. Neither the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration nor the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety have crash-tested the Porsche 911, but this isn’t unusual for a low-volume sports car.\n\nTop of the Line and Priced Accordingly\n\nThe 911 Turbo S is meant to be Porsche’s ultimate everyday 911. There are versions that are more track-oriented, like the GT3 or GT2 RS, but for one that’s meant to do primary duty as a daily driver and grand tourer with only rare visits to a racetrack, the Turbo and Turbo S are the go-to weapons of choice. Starting price for this 2018 model is an eye-popping $191,750, including destination. My car had only two options — lane change assist and ventilated seats — bringing its total up to $193,440. That’s a stunning sum for a car that doesn’t have keyless entry or a sunroof. Start adding all the customizable options for a 911 Turbo S and you’ll be looking at a quarter-million-dollar price tag in short order. The 911 model covers a staggering range of prices, with the base 911 starting at $100,000 less than the Turbo S and the range-topping GT2 RS starting at $100,000 more.\n\nBut that’s OK, as the competition costs just as much. If you want something with the capabilities of a 911 but very different aesthetics, slide over to a Mercedes-Benz dealer and have a look at the AMG GT coupe and convertible. With a big V-8 up front, just two seats and proportions that couldn’t be more different, it’s an alternative take on the expensive personal luxury sports car. Jaguar’s F-Type is less expensive in its base models but can easily approach the 911 Turbo’s top price tag in higher-spec SVR versions. If you’re less concerned about badge cachet at the valet, you can opt for a Nissan GT-R, which undercuts the Porsche on price but easily keeps up with it on a racetrack or canyon road. Compare all four vehicles here.\n\nWe’re likely to see a new Porsche 911 in the next year or two, which will hopefully address the lacking safety systems in this one. As for the rest of the car, there are few vehicles on the planet that can match the 911 Turbo S’ combination of sheer ability, comfortable surroundings and earned pedigree. There’s a reason any 911 is an aspirational vehicle for so many auto enthusiasts — it delivers on all fronts better than just about any other sports car out there.\n\nEditor’s note: This story was updated Oct. 24, 2018, to reflect that Android Auto is not available.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The Porsche 911 may largely be known for its capabilities on tarmac these days, but the model also has a rich rally history that includes a second-place finish at the 1978 Safari Rally. However, while many Safari conversions have appeared through various aftermarket companies over the years, Porsche didn’t offer such a creation with a factory-backed warranty. That’s now changing, with the brand taking the veil off the 2023 Porsche 911 Dakar at the 2022 Los Angeles Auto Show.\n\nRelated: More 2022 L.A. Auto Show Coverage\n\nThe 911 Dakar’s exterior styling shows strong familial ties with the pavement-focused 911 Carrera, but the Dakar gets a 2-inch lift thanks to a revised suspension system. This ground clearance can be extended further for a grand total of 7.5 inches when the Dakar is set to its highest suspension setting. Unlike some of its closest rivals that automatically lower when speeds reach 25 mph, the Dakar can maintain this height up to 105 mph before it lowers, with Porsche claiming it allows owners to do “spirited off-road driving.” The exterior also gets a large black rear spoiler, front-mounted tow hooks, larger wheel flares and stainless-steel components.\n\n911 Dakar Trades Track Tires for Trail-Ready Tires\n\nIn addition to the trick suspension, the 911 Dakar also comes with model-exclusive Pirelli Scorpion All Terrain Plus Tires that feature dual-layer construction to help enhance resistance to damage from rocks and other obstacles. The tire’s 0.35-inch tread depth helps maximize wet-weather grip, but the trade-off is that the 911 Dakar won’t hit 200 mph. To help preserve the tires, the top speed is instead limited to a tamer (and we use that word lightly) 150 mph.\n\nThe 911 Dakar comes equipped with all-wheel drive and a twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter boxer engine that makes 473 horsepower and 420 pounds-feet of torque, allowing for a sprint to 60 mph in 3.2 seconds. The engine is mated to a standard eight-speed automatic transmission.\n\nPricing and Release Date\n\nWhen the 2023 911 Dakar makes its way to dealerships in spring 2023, it’ll have a base price of $223,450 (including a $1,450 destination charge), and production will be limited to just 2,500 units worldwide.\n\nPorsche will also be offering an enviable arsenal of optional accessories for the 911 Dakar including an optional roof tent and a cargo basket that can hold up to 92 pounds of gear. Meanwhile, to commemorate Porsche’s victory at the 1984 Paris-Dakar Rally, a separate Rallye Design Package adds two-tone paint and a start number on each side of the car.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2021 Porsche 911 Turbo Review: How to Successfully Maintain a Legacy\n2021 Porsche 911 Turbo: Not Quite the Turbo S, Still Quite the Sports Car\n2021 Porsche 911 Targa Travels Back in Time With 4S Heritage Edition\nStalk Car?

      "expert_review": "Like the Porsche 911 Carrera coupe, the 911 Carrera Cabriolet convertible was redesigned for 2012. Because they share features and most specifications, I’ll refer you to my recent coupe review and devote this report to the convertible aspects.\n\nA hardtop is certainly the purer sport experience in any car, but the redesigned 2012 Porsche 911 Carrera Cabriolet convertible gives up little to its exceptional coupe sibling.\n\nAs with the coupe, the sixth and new seventh generations were both built as 2012 models (a practice so fraught with problems that it’s thankfully rare). If you shop for one, the giveaway for telling them apart is the new generation’s parking brake switch on the dashboard, replacing the older version’s conventional console lever. The 2013 models — all of which will be seventh generation — should hit dealerships well before 2012 ends.\n\nAt $94,650 including a $950 destination charge, the base Carrera Cabriolet is priced almost $12,000 above the equivalent coupe. It also exceeds Porsche’s other redesigned convertible, the 2013 Boxster roadster, in cost by more than $44,000. (See all three compared side-by-side.)\n\nSoft-Top: Mostly Pros, Few Cons\nBoth the Cabriolet and Boxster are soft-tops, and for good reasons. Retractable hardtops need trunk space for their lowered roof panels, and as mid-engine (Boxster) and rear-engine (911) cars, the Porsches don’t have the room to spare. Their primary storage trunks are in the front. Soft-tops typically weigh less, too. The 911 Cabriolet weighs just 155 pounds more than the coupe, accounting for the top and reinforcement to maintain stiffness in the absence of a fixed roof.\n\nThe soft-top’s main shortcoming is rear visibility when the top’s up, where the cloth C-pillar is characteristically wide. There’s no problem when the top’s down, however, because it tucks down low and active roll bars stay out of sight unless a rollover causes them to deploy upward.\n\nA powered rear screen is also pretty easy to see through. Meant to diminish wind buffeting at higher speeds, it motors upward when you hold down a button on the center console. It might not have impressed me as much as it did if the 2013 Boxster’s screen were less obstructive. Between that car’s screen (removable but not powered) and the fixed roll bars that bookend it, the Boxster’s rear visibility is poor for a roadster.\n\nThe 911 convertible has some other common soft-top advantages, including quick operation — about 15 seconds, up or down, at the touch of a button. Unlike retractable hardtops, it doesn’t require clearance behind the car for the trunk lid to tilt back, and it can be operated when the car’s in motion. It also doesn’t steal too much cargo space. The main difference is the area behind the cabin, which isn’t a continuous storage hatch as it is in the coupe. Instead there’s a compartment accessible from the rear when the top’s up that’s occupied when it’s down.\n\nThe Cabriolet isn’t as prone as you might expect to a traditional soft-top tradeoff: cabin noise. You hear some sounds from behind you when the top’s up, but it’s mainly the engine, and the same is true in the coupe. The cabin’s well-isolated from exterior noise — for a convertible. It’s actually better than the similarly priced 2013 Mercedes-Benz SL550 I recently reviewed, despite its retractable hardtop, which is a presumed advantage when it comes to noise isolation.\n\nStill a Two-Seater\nSometimes lowering a convertible’s top makes otherwise worthless rear seats usable, but not in this case. The legroom back there remains scant at best, and the backrests are essentially vertical. You’re best off folding them forward and using the space for storage. The sole advantage over the coupe back there is you can transport something tall with the top down. You can’t exactly let cargo stick out of the 911’s trunk — what with it being in front of you.\n\nBehind the Wheel\nApart from the roof, the main difference between this car and the coupe I reviewed is that the Cabriolet is a regular Carrera while the coupe was the more powerful Carrera S. Even this car had spirited acceleration and a nice sound, including the optional sport exhaust and its “loud” button. Both non-S Carrera versions lose roughly two-tenths of a second in the zero-to-60 mph sprint, meaning a worst case of 4.8 seconds for the Carrera Cabriolet. As on the coupe, the optional PDK dual-clutch automatic transmission and Sport Chrono Package — both featured on my test car — each shave 0.2 tenths, for an estimated 4.4-second zero-to-60. Porsche says a comparably equipped Carrera S Cabriolet does it in 4.1 seconds.\n\nAnyone can tell you a car with a fixed hard roof is the stiffer, lighter way to go, but the 911’s convertible version is admirably rigid and exhibits all the coupe’s athleticism. Like the coupe, it’s a car you wear rather than sit in and operate. If you don’t mind the other small tradeoffs, you’re not giving up much. The Cabriolet doesn’t even sacrifice mileage to the coupe: It’s EPA-rated 20/28 mpg city/highway for the base engine with PDK in either body style, and 19/27 mpg for all other versions, regardless of transmission or body style.\n\nThe smaller engine’s auto stop/start feature is notably more intrusive, though still not too bad. It might be coincidental, but so far I’ve found larger and/or more powerful engines to auto-start more smoothly, even when two sizes are available in the same car, as is the case here.\n\nAnnoyances: A Second Look\nReturning to the things that bugged me in the coupe: The fake-metal trim and ridiculous retracting “cupholders” are as offensive as ever. Though this stereo was a different brand, its automatic volume again failed to compensate for changing noise levels. The Cabriolet’s darker dashboard produced less windshield glare than the coupe’s optional beige color, but I still think polarized sunglasses are a must.\n\nThis test car also added the optional keyless ignition, which is a lot like others, though most employ a push button or a small knob. In the 911 it’s a big dummy key that sticks out of the dashboard as a regular keyfob would. It works fine; it’s just odd looking. Ask anyone.\n\nSafety\nDue to their low volume, Porsches aren’t crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nThe 911 Carrera has six airbags — the front two along with two-piece side-impact airbags on either side. A torso airbag deploys from the seatback, and a head-protection airbag deploys upward from the door rather than downward from the ceiling. This gives the Cabriolet version head protection that some convertibles lack.\n\nAs is required of all new cars starting with the 2012 model year, the 911 has antilock brakes and an electronic stability system with traction control. See all the standard safety features here.\n\n911 Cabriolet in the Market\nSportiness is about feel, not specifications, and convertibles are often geared toward what automakers call a more “casual driver.” This is why it might be harder to find, say, a Chevrolet Corvette with a manual transmission. Even more than the coupes on which they’re based, convertibles tend to lean toward touring rather than sport. Bucking that trend is what makes the 911 Cabriolet stand out even more than the 911 coupe does among its rivals: For its combination of sportiness and open-air driving, the Cabriolet’s high price might be more justified than the coupe’s.\n\nSend Joe an email",
