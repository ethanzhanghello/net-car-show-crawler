      "expert_review": "Porsche has unveiled the new 2017 718 Cayman and higher performance 718 Cayman S. Featuring the same engines and styling updates as the Boxster.\n\n\nThe Cayman receives styling updates similar to the Boxster's. A new front bumper and lower air intakes, slimmer bi-xenon headlamps and integrated LED daytime running lights all combine to give the Cayman a wider, more substantial look than the outgoing car. In back, a new set of LED taillights with a distinctive floating four-point light signature and a gloss-black strip that incorporates the Porsche logo complement the wider stance of the car. The big difference from the Boxster is the fixed coupe roof, which provides a different silhouette than its 911 big brother.\n\nInside, the 718 Cayman shares the same updates seen on the 718 Boxster. The upper portion of the dashboard has been redesigned, including new air vents, while the steering wheel is taken from the ultra-exclusive 918 Spyder supercar. An eight-speaker audio system and Bluetooth connectivity are standard, with USB, Apple CarPlay and Porsche Car Connect multimedia systems optional.\n\nPowering the new 718 Cayman are the same pair of brand-new turbocharged flat-four engines first seen in the 718 Boxster. The base car gets a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder making 300 horsepower and 280 pounds-feet of torque, while the 718 Cayman S gets a larger 2.5-liter unit making 350 hp and 309 pounds-feet of torque.\n\nWhen combined with the dual-clutch automatic transmission and the Sport Chrono Package, Porsche reports a zero-to-60-mph time of 4.5 seconds and a top speed of 170 mph for the 718 Cayman, and 4.0 seconds and 177 mph for the 718 Cayman S.\nThe new 718 Cayman also gets some suspension updates, including a retuned sport suspension with a quicker steering rack adapted from the 911 Turbo and wider rear wheels with new tires. An adjustable suspension (Porsche Active Suspension Management, or PASM) is available, as is Porsche Torque Vectoring.\n\nThe Sport Chrono Package allows for adjustment of various vehicle settings from the steering wheel controls, adding an Individual setting to the previously available Normal, Sport and Sport Plus modes. New, larger brakes are standard, with the base 718 Cayman now using the brakes from the previous-generation Cayman S, while the 718 Cayman S now uses the four-piston calipers from the 911 Carrera combined with thicker front rotors.",

      "expert_review": "It was only a matter of time before the recently redesigned Porsche 718 Boxster convertible and 718 Cayman coupe offered even more performance. We didn’t have to wait very long; just a year it turns out. New for model-year 2018, the 718 Boxster and Cayman GTS are now the most powerful cars in the 718 lineup.\n\nRelated: Is a Porsche 911 Worth the Upgrade From a Boxster or Cayman?\n\nI tested both the base and S versions of the 718 last year and somewhat surprisingly, I preferred the Porsche 718 Cayman S to the 911 Carrera. Its supreme balance and responsive powertrain won me over against the classic styling and rear-engine layout in the 911. To say I was excited to get behind the wheel of the GTS would be putting it mildly.\n\nI headed to Napa Valley in Northern California to sample the new vintages of the 718 sports car. Per company policy, Cars.com pays for its own lodging and transportation to such automaker events.\n\nWhat Does the 718 GTS Get You?\n\nThe GTS badge comes with some cosmetic updates that set it apart from other versions of the 718, including a unique front apron, dark tinted headlights and taillights, 20-inch Carrera S wheels in black and black tailpipes. Inside, “GTS” is stitched into the head restraints, the gauges are finished in black, and the steering wheel, shift knob and parts of the door panel/center console bin are all covered in Alcantara.\n\nThat’s all potatoes. What enthusiasts will care about are the changes underneath the skin. The Porsche Active Suspension Management comes standard; it lowers the GTS by 0.39 inch over the standard 718 suspension. Want to go even lower? PASM Sport is optional ($290) and lowers the car another 0.39 inch to a 0.78-inch total and offers even more stiffness for greater response. Porsche Torque Vectoring also comes standard — it uses dynamic braking at the rear wheels and a rear differential lock to increase the car’s lateral dynamics and stability, as well as offer a sharper turn-in.\n\nThe engine’s upgrades including new intake manifolds for improved airflow and changes to the turbocharger, such as a larger compressor wheel diameter. The turbocharger also has variable turbine geometry (shared with S versions) that allows the guide blades that feed exhaust gases into the turbine of the turbocharger to open and close, depending on conditions. The larger compressor wheel allows the GTS to produce 18.1 pounds of boost pressure versus 16.7 pounds for S models.\n\nThis bumps engine output to 365 horsepower and 317 pounds-feet of torque, improvements of 15 hp and 8 pounds-feet of torque over S models. Transmission options are the same: a six-speed stick or a seven-speed PDK system, Porsche’s dual-clutch automatic transmission. The new GTS gets the Sport Chrono Package standard, another feature that’s an option on the S – this adds a Sport plus driving mode and launch control on PDK models.\n\nThe GTS doesn’t translate to vastly different acceleration and top speed figures. The GTS has a slightly higher top-speed than S models, 180 versus 177 mph. But with the manual transmission, the GTS actually matches the zero-to-60-mph time of the S models (4.4 seconds). PDK models see the slightest of improvements; they are 0.1 second faster than a comparable S model (with Sport Chrono Package optioned) at 3.9 seconds from zero-to-60 mph.\n\nTell Your Significant Other It’s a Value Buy\n\nBelieve it or not, Porsche says the GTS does have some value if you stack it up against S models: If you were to outfit a Boxster S or Cayman S with all of the available styling options that made it look like a GTS and added PASM, PTV and Sport Chrono, than the S models would cost roughly 6 to 8 percent more than the GTS’ starting price – and that’s without the engine power gains and improvements.\n\nThe GTS models start at $23,800 more than the respective base models for each car. That prices the 2018 Porsche 718 Cayman GTS at $80,850 (including destination charges) and the 2018 718 Boxster GTS at $82,950 (both models come standard with the six-speed manual).\n\nIf you wanted to add only the performance parts? Taking a Cayman S and adding PASM, PTV and Sport Chrono pushes the price to $75,550, which is within about $5,000 of the GTS. That car comes with smaller wheels, however, and without that perfectly sized GT sport steering wheel.\n\nCan You Feel the Difference?\n\nSlap all the cosmetics you want on it. To justify the GTS’ price increase, there needs to be a commensurate gain in performance.\n\nThe 718 Cayman S I last reviewed came with the PASM sport suspension, PTV and Sport Chrono, making it closely equipped to a GTS from a suspension perspective, and the two cars ended up handling close to the same. That’s a good thing; both vehicles are superbly balanced, and things that would normally unsettle the car (such as heavy braking) are swallowed up instantly. The 718 Cayman GTS is a car you can brake very late into a corner and it will almost immediately return to neutral balance to get through the corner swiftly.\n\nThis is especially true with the optional carbon ceramic brake package, a $7,410 mark-up over the standard brakes and easily identifiable by yellow brake calipers. The carbon ceramics offer some weight savings (15 pounds worth) and greater stopping power, but the price tag is tough to swallow. The standard brakes are identical to those found on the Boxster/Cayman S and will be plenty for those who will be driving the car on the street. Opting for the carbon ceramics is more justifiable if you plan to track or autocross the vehicle.\n\nWith the PASM Sport suspension box checked (which I definitely would), there is a stark difference between Normal and Sport suspension modes, so much so that I’d be swapping through the two constantly. Normal is much more pliant and suitable for day-to-day driving, albeit with a stiffer suspension than most other vehicles – this is still a sports car after all. But Sport really firms things up for an aggressive setup that gives the Porsche 718 Cayman GTS its trademark handling edge.\n\nThere’s more distinction with the engine changes than in the suspension. Though the published figures don’t offer much separation, I thought the GTS engine felt more responsive and quicker to get into the power than the Cayman S. It’s impressive how much response Porsche has built into the GTS throttle and engine; the gas pedal is nearly as telepathic as the steering is.\n\nAnother benefit of the new intake manifolds and larger turbocharger is more engine noise. Thankfully, it’s a pleasant noise because the sound is with you at all times. The cabin is noticeably louder, whether you have sport exhaust activated or not. I like that it gives the GTS more of an edge, and it’s even better in the Boxster GTS where you can drop the top to really hear it sing.\n\n2018 Porsche 718 Cayman GTS | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\n718 Boxster GTS or 718 Cayman GTS?\n\nThe 718 Boxster/Cayman GTS isn’t a sea change. The GTS doesn’t broach any new ground but rather serves to enhance the strengths of the 718 Boxster and Cayman, giving them a bit more edge. Shoppers considering adding suspension and powertrain upgrades to an S model might find that jumping up to the GTS, which includes many of those same options as standard, makes a lot of sense.\n\nThe Cayman GTS I tested stickered at $92,580 thanks in large part to those ceramic brakes. And the Boxster GTS was even more, adding mostly cosmetic touches (that Chalk paint job by itself was $2,580) and a GTS Interior Package ($3,690) for a final price of $95,700.\n\nI’ll take the Cayman GTS of the two I tested – I’d rather spend more on the sharper driving car, not the sharper looking one.\n\nI said before I preferred the 718 Cayman S to the 911 Carrera, and the same holds true for the GTS, even if you factor in the 911 Carrera T that I also tested on this trip. There’s something about mid-engine cars that speaks to me on a visceral level, and though I concede that the 911 will always be the more quintessential Porsche, I’m a bit new school in my approach. In fact, I find that the GTS offers the most bang for your performance buck and I’d take it over most 911 varieties, up to the GT3 (at that point give me the GT3 because it’s insane).\n\nThose who want a 911 are not making a wrong choice — it’s still a great driver’s car and some want the cachet, the tradition and the chance to say, “I drive a 911.” But not me dear reader, no, no, no. You and I, we don’t get caught up on such pretenses.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The range-topping models of the 2020 Porsche 718 Cayman and 718 Spyder are both getting a new engine — a 4.0-liter, naturally aspirated flat-six that produces 414 horsepower and 309 pounds-feet of torque. True to the brand’s roots, both models are only available with a six-speed manual transmission featuring downshift rev-matching — which can be turned off if you want to do your own throttle blipping.\n\nRelated: 2019 Porsche 911 Speedster First Impressions: Be Still My Beating Heart \n\nThe new engine has an 8,000-rpm redline and propels both models to 60 mph in a claimed 4.2 seconds; the Cayman GT4 will reach a 188-mph top speed, while the Spyder will hit 187. Porsche also says this Cayman GT4 is 10 seconds quicker around the Nurburgring Nordschleife than its predecessor.\n\nAnother nifty feature is Porsche Active Suspension Management with adaptive damping and a 1.18-inch lower ride height than other 718 models. Camber, toe, ride height and anti-roll bar settings are all manually adjustable, bringing the worlds of Gran Turismo and Forza into real life. Both cars have standard brakes adapted from the 911 GT3, and carbon-ceramic brakes are — of course — optional. A mechanical limited-slip differential is also standard.\n\nBoth models get updated exterior looks and feature a front lip spoiler with a debossed model designation, an air outlet in front of the front trunk, a new rear diffuser to reduce lift and tinted taillights. The soft-top for the 718 Spyder is manual for weight savings and can be optioned as a two-tone red-and-black top in honor of historic Porsche racecars. The 718 Spyder also has a unique, automatically extending rear spoiler. The hardtop Cayman GT4’s side air intakes have additional side blades now, and the model’s giant rear wing is manually adjustable.\n\nInside both cars, there’s Alcantara faux suede everywhere, as befits two hardcore track-focused cars. The shifter in both has shorter throws than standard 718 models, and driver and passenger each get standard Porsche Sport Seats Plus. Full bucket seats or 18-way power sport seats are optional. Unlike hardcore Porsche models of the past, climate control and multimedia systems are standard instead of optional. A two-tone leather trim is optional on the 718 Spyder, and the Spyder also has exterior-paint-colored cabin trim pieces instead of the Cayman GT4’s brushed aluminum.\n\nAll this goodness will cost you a pretty penny: Before options but including destination fee, the 718 Spyder will cost $97,550 and the Cayman GT4 will set you back $100,450. Both are available for ordering now, with deliveries expected in the spring of 2020.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Shopping for a new Porsche 718 Boxster or 718 Cayman and find the manual-transmission-only trim levels appealing? Well, we’ve got some good news and some bad news: The good news is that all 2021 718 models gain some additional standard features that, frankly, should be standard in a $60,000-plus car from a luxury brand. The bad news (for purists) is that Porsche is making its seven-speed PDK dual-clutch automatic transmission available across the lineup, ending the row-your-own exclusivity of the GTS 4.0 trim levels as well as the Boxster Spyder and Cayman GT4.\n\nRelated: Porsche 718 GTS 4.0: You Make Me Feel Like a Natural Sports Car\n\nMore Standard Goodies\n\nAll 718 models now include dual-zone automatic climate control, heated front seats and rain-sensing, auto-dimming mirrors. Porsche is also adding Apple CarPlay as standard equipment across all 718 models, as well as making bi-xenon headlights the standard method of illuminating the road ahead.\n\nAdded standard features don’t come without an added cost — this is still Porsche, after all — as base models of the 718 Cayman increase in price by $2,400. A 2021 718 Cayman will now cost $61,250, and the Boxster will be priced from $63,350 (all prices include $1,350 destination fee).\n\nAutomatic for the (Wealthy) People\n2021 Porsche 718 Boxster and Cayman interior | Manufacturer image\n\nUntil now, the highest levels of performance in the 718 lineup came exclusively with a six-speed manual transmission. GTS 4.0 trim levels of the Boxster and Cayman as well as the Boxster Spyder and Cayman GT4 paired that six-speed with a naturally aspirated 4.0-liter six-cylinder engine that produced 394 horsepower in GTS guise and 414 hp for the Spyder and GT4.\n\nFor 2021, however, Porsche is letting customers order those models with its seven-speed PDK system. Not only does that allow more customers to buy the more expensive performance models, it also makes the cars quicker, according to Porsche. Just how much quicker isn’t clear yet, but expect somewhere between two-tenths and half a second to get knocked off GTS models’ 4.3-second 0-60 times and the Spyder and GT4’s 4.2-second sprint.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2021 Porsche Cayenne GTS, Cayenne GTS Coupe Revealed\n2021 Porsche 911 Targa Travels Back in Time With 4S Heritage Edition\nStalk Car? Porsche 911 Buyers Can Track Their Dream Car’s Every Move\nPorsche 911 Targa 4 and 4S Keep Retro Looks for New Generation\nWhat’s the Right Way to Say Porsche?\nHigh-Performance Pricing\n\nPricing for the automatic-equipped GTS 4.0 models hasn’t been disclosed yet (or for the Spyder or GT4), but with the manual transmission, 2021 718 Cayman GTS 4.0 models will be priced from $88,150 while Boxster GTS 4.0 models will carry a starting price of $90,250. Ordering is open now, and Porsche expects automatic-equipped six-cylinder models to arrive at dealerships early in 2021.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
