      "expert_review": "LOWER LAKE – To some, the idea of a French restaurant in this tiny Lake County town (population 1,755) sounds as incongruous as, well, a sport-utility from Porsche.\n\nYet, parked on Main Street (naturally) outside of Robert’s French Restaurant one day earlier this month were a half-dozen Porsche Cayenne SUVs.\n\nPorsche purists howled at the audacity of the German sports car maker. But company executives thumbed their noses at the how-dare-yous, insisting a sport-utility was needed for Porsche to remain profitable, to remain independent, to remain relevant.\n\nJust wait and see, those Porsche pencil-pushers cautioned, and judge us when the rubber hits the road. Then, tell us whether Porsche and SUV make for such an odd couple after all.\n\nSo, after 152.1 hard miles on some wonderful roads — Berryessa-Knoxville Road, Oakville Grade Road, Dry Creek Road — in Sonoma, Napa and Lake counties, this skeptic became a believer.\n\nThe 2003 Porsche Cayenne is a wonder. On road, it can do things that other sport-utilities can’t. Despite its weight and size — around 2 1/2 tons and nearly 16 feet long — the Cayenne is strong and fast, tight and precise.\n\nMy off-road experience was limited to driving through 4-inch deep flowing water, but other writers who have had the chance to journey unpaved with the Cayenne have come away impressed.\n\nOf course, all this comes at a price. The base model Cayenne, which Porsche designates as S, has a starting price of $55,900. That places it neatly between the Boxster S ($51,600) and the 911 Carrera coupe ($68,600).\n\nThe S gets a 4.5-liter V-8 that generates 340 horsepower at 6,000 RPM and 310 pound-feet of torque at 2,500 to 5,500 RPM.\n\nThe upscale Cayenne — if Porsche had named it the Paprika, this would be the Hungarian version — is called the Turbo. Here, twin-turbo-chargers prompt 450 horsepower at 6,000 RPM and 457 pound-feet of torque at 2,250 to 4,750 RPM from the 4.5-liter V-8.\n\nThis model costs $88,900. That places it above most of the 911 variants — coupe, cabriolet, all-wheel-drive cabriolet, targa and 4S — and only below the Turbo ($116,200) and the GT2 ($181,700).\n\nPorsche expects that 80 percent of Cayenne owners will buy the S model.\n\nAll Cayennes have a full-time all-wheel-drive system and a six-speed automatic transmission with Tiptronic, which allows clutch-less shifting. SUVs are familiar territory for U.S. Porsche owners, 56 percent of whom already own a sport-utility.\n\nTo me, the lack of a manual transmission is the biggest drawback of the Cayenne, but Porsche officials insists it was a decision made for both financial (offering only one type of shifter costs less) and real-world reasons (nearly all SUV buyers want automatic transmissions).\n\nWhat’s also missing is a spare tire. It was left off to make room for a better stereo. For the off-roading Cayenne owner, a rear-door spar e-tire holder (and spare tire) is a dealer-installed option.\n\nSome also would insist that that expected Porsche elegance, a sinewy exterior design that connotes motion even when the car (or truck, now) is standing still, is also absent.\n\nAnd, yes, neither the Cayenne’s bulging front end with its large air openings and triangular light pods nor its blocky, econo-box-inspired rear hatch will win any beauty contests.\n\nA quick glance at a black Cayenne — from a certain angle, under specific lighting — brought to mind a steroid-infused Mini Cooper. But, certainly, there’s little Boxster and absolutely none of the classic 911 beauty here.\n\nOn the inside, however, the Cayenne is a real crowd pleaser. By far, Porsche’s most fully evolved interior, the Porsche is both luxurious and sporty. A Turbo model I drove with the Havanna/sand beige smooth leather interior was positively Lexus-like in its sophistication and Audi-like in its innovation. With a healthy splash of light wood trim, the package was very appealing.\n\nDuring very aggressive driving, the firm seats held fast and offered appropriate (and much needed) support to both driver and front-seat passenger. (If your significant other is both behind the wheel and a little nuts, you’ll happily note the shotgun seat has not one, not two, but three grab handles for holding onto dear life.)\n\nAll isn’t perfect inside the Cayenne, however. Yes, you’ll find Porsche’s traditional five-ring gauges, nicely trimmed in metal, but neither the tachometer nor the speedometer is set dead center in front of the driver. The triangle-shaped steering-wheel pod is both artsy and useful, with redundant controls for shifting and other functions.\n\nThe second seat actually accommodates full-size adults — again, another first for Porsche. Both headroom and legroom is quite nice. The rear cargo space is very nice at 19 cubic feet, and grows greatly to 62.5 cubic feet when the seats fold down. (BMW’s X5 offers 23.8 and 54.4 cubic feet, in comparison.)\n\nPorsche spokesman Bob Carlson identified the BMW X5 4.6is as the on-road and the Land Rover Range Rover as the off-road targets of the new Cayenne.\n\n“Those two set the bar before we hit the market,” he said.\n\nCarlson said the arrival of the Cayenne has prompted most of its 203 North American dealers to upgrade their “tired” showrooms or build new ones. That was needed to handle increased traffic, he said.\n\nBy 2005, largely due to the Cayenne, Porsche expects its sales in this country to double from the 23,000 units sold in 2002. (In March, Porsche dealers sold 899 Cayennes.)\n\nAnother knock on the Cayenne is that it shares a platform and a number of electric parts with a much less expensive model, the Volkswagen Touareg sport-utility that’ll be priced from $35,000 to $41,000 when it goes on sale in June.\n\nBut, unlike the beef at Lower Lake’s best French restaurant, the idea behind the Cayenne wasn’t half-baked. And the idea of a Porsche sport-utility makes certain sense in America, circa 2003.\n\n“We’re not straying from our Porsche heritage,” Carlson said.\n\nTo me, that heritage — get in, go fast — fully applies to the Cayenne.",

      "expert_review": "Ritzy Porsche Cayenne SUV is cool, but not hot\n\nGerman sports-car maker Porsche drew heavy criticism from purists last year when it introduced the brand’s first-ever sport utility vehicle, a close cousin to the Volkswagen Touareg dubbed Cayenne.\n\nBut the Cayenne has boosted the Stuttgart, Germany-based company’s fortunes, especially in SUV-crazed North America, where the “off-road” Porsche competes with high-priced machinery such as the Mercedes-Benz G500 and the Range Rover.\n\nWe tested a 2004 Cayenne S with a base price of $55,900 and more than $10,000 in options, including leather upholstery and air suspension.\n\nThe bottom line: $67,970 — which puts this Porsche out of the reach of all but the most affluent consumers.\n\nHE: I think I’m in the minority of people who not only like the Cayenne, but also think Porsche did a good job in designing an SUV that actually looks like a Porsche. On the other hand, Volkswagen, with the Touareg, did a better job of building an SUV that is not only a demon off-road, but looks and feels like a luxury product that’s also just right for everyday driving chores. For the money, I prefer the Touareg. But if you’ve gotta have a Porsche the Cayenne is not a bad choice.\n\nSHE: Sorry, I can’t warm up to the Cayenne. And I’m even less inclined to fall for it after reading the ludicrous Porsche ads touting the 450-horsepower turbo version of the Cayenne as the perfect vehicle for people who need to get diapers in a hurry. Sounds like the fantasy of an ad writer who has neither children nor brains. The Cayenne is not a good compromise vehicle for a sports car-loving dad and a school-car pooling mom. It’s not a good SUV choice for families. It’s too nice on the interior to handle the ravages of the toddler set and it’s just not flexible enough for growing families — especially with the lack of a third row.\n\nHE: That diaper line was totally tongue-in-cheek, Ms. Serious. The Cayenne isn’t exactly about family transportation. That’ll have to wait for the new four-seater Porsche that’s supposedly in the pipeline. And I’m surprised that you totally missed the real target female audience, what the New York Times called the “affluent oppressed” — those women “with everything and yet not nearly enough.”\n\nSHE: My grandmother would call that particular demographic “spoiled rotten.”\n\nHE: But you have to admit that the Cayenne provides a brawny, feature-laden package with great performance for people with a lot of money who love the Porsche brand, but don’t want to compromise on space or functionality.\n\nSHE: I’ll admit that the cabin of the Cayenne is pretty slick, with shiny metal controls and optional stone/steel leather upholstery. The driver is outfitted with a steering wheel that has push button transmission controls that let you shift manually, in addition to audio controls. The rear-seat passengers are well cared for, with a storage console, cupholders, vents and temperature controls. In the cargo hold, you get power outlets, cargo hooks and a tonneau cover to hide packages. Oddly, the audio controls on the instrument panel have too-tiny buttons, a puzzling design, given that the Cayenne, like all others Porsches, is really aimed at men.\n\nHE: The buff magazines have all raved about the 450-horsepower turbo engine, but the standard twin-cam 4.5-liter V-8 in the Cayenne S that we tested is no slouch. It makes 340 horsepower, and packs a pretty good wallop in a vehicle this heavy.\n\nSHE: You can talk about power all day, but I give Porsche credit for loading up the Cayenne with an impressive list of standard safety features. You get everything from stability control, which helps to keep you from fish-tailing on slippery roads, to dual side curtain air bags that protect all the outboard occupants. Porsche has done a superior job in the Cayenne of providing enough equipment to keep o pants safe and secure.\n\nHE: I still have a few beefs. As good as the engine is, there is still some noticeable throttle lag, and the fuel economy is dismal — 14 miles per gallon in city driving and 18 on the highway. And Porsche-philes may be disappointed by the truck-like handling. But, hey, this is an SUV, right? So what’s not to like?\n\nSHE: They may have to coin a new buzz phrase for guys who are attracted to this vehicle — the affluent obsessed.\n\n2004 Porsche Cayenne S\n\nType: Front-engine, all-wheel drive, five-passenger sport-utility vehicle\n\nPrice: Base, $56,665; as tested, $67,970\n\nEngine:\n\nEPA fuel economy: 14 mpg city/ 18 mpg highway\n\nKey competitors: BMW X5, Cadillac Escalade, Cadillac SRX, Infiniti QX56, Lexus LX470, Lincoln Aviator, Lincoln Navigator, Mercedes-Benz G500, Mercedes-Benz ML500, Range Rover, Volkswagen Touareg\n\n12-month insurance cost: $2,074\n\nWhere built: Germany\n\n1: Includes $765 destination charge; 2: Estimated by AAA Michigan. Rates may vary depending on coverage and driving record.\n\nRating system: 1- unacceptable; 2- subpar; 3- acceptable; 4- above average; 5- world class\n\nAnita’s rating: 3 out of 5\n\nLikes: Comfy ride, with adjustable suspension settings. Good rear-seat controls. Great safety features, including stability control and side-curtain air bags for front and rear occupants. Surprisingly good visibility.\n\nDislikes: Not crazy about the bug-eyed styling. Optional leather seat package costs $3,200. Difficult to park in a tight space. Have to remove headrests to lower rear seat. Radio control buttons are too tiny.\n\nPaul’s rating: 4 out of 5\n\nLikes: Looks like a Porsche, at least on the outside. Lusty V-8. Extremely capable off-road — if you really want to take your Porsche off-road. Good headroom. Steering-wheel shift controls for automatic transmission.\n\nDislikes: Cabin is not as ritzy as VW Touareg. Noticeable throttle lag, especially when accelerating from rest. Mediocre fuel economy. Not enough rear-seat legroom. Porsche-philes may be disappointed by the truck-like handling.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nPorsche finally introduced its eagerly awaited Cayenne sport utility vehicle in early 2003. Like the stimulating pepper of the same name, this luxury midsize SUV ranks as a hot number � especially when it’s the Cayenne Turbo, which has a 450-horsepower twin-turbo V-8. A 340-hp Cayenne S and a base model powered by a 247-hp V-6 are also offered.\n\nA standard six-speed-manual transmission is fitted in the V-6 Cayenne for 2005. New options include Sirius or XM Satellite Radio and a Sport Design package.\n\nAll models have permanent all-wheel drive, an inter-axle differential lock and additional Low-range gearing. The Porsche Stability Management stability system is standard. Volkswagen markets a related SUV named the Touareg.\n\nExterior\nEven though the Cayenne’s styling is distinctive, its front end is reminiscent of the automaker’s 911 sports car. Like the 911 coupes, the Cayenne exhibits what Porsche calls “taut lines and tight curves that communicate a feeling of elegance and speed.”\n\nThe Cayenne Turbo gets additional front air inlets, power domes on the hood and a quartet of tailpipes. Each model rides a 112.4-inch wheelbase and measures a little more than 188 inches long overall. The Turbo’s pneumatic suspension adjusts to six ground-clearance levels, from 6.18 to 10.75 inches. Cayennes are available with 17- , 18- , 19- or 20-inch wheels.\n\nInterior\nSeating for up to five occupants on leather seating surfaces is standard; full leather seats are available. Front and rear parking assistance is included. Cargo capacity totals 19.1 cubic feet and expands to 62.5 cubic feet when the backseat is folded.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Cayenne S and Turbo use 4.5-liter V-8s that team with a six-speed-automatic transmission featuring a manual gear-shift provision. The V-8 in the Cayenne S develops 340 hp and 310 pounds-feet of torque. With its bi-turbo setup, the Cayenne Turbo’s V-8 produces 450 hp and 460 pounds-feet of torque.\n\nPorsche’s V-6-powered Cayenne produces 247 hp from its 3.2-liter engine. It works with a six-speed manual or a six-speed automatic with a manual-shift provision.\n\nPorsche claims the Cayenne Turbo can accelerate from zero to 62 mph in 5.6 seconds. Permanent all-wheel drive is standard on all models. A rocker switch engages Low-range gearing. Towing capacity is 7,716 pounds.\n\nSafety\nSeat-mounted side-impact airbags and side curtain-type airbags are standard in all models.\n\nDriving Impressions\nBoth Cayenne V-8 models are refined, civilized and muscular, but their performance personalities differ as much as their prices. Acceleration from a standstill is downright startling in the Cayenne Turbo. Passing and merging response is less consistent � sometimes it’s ferociously fast but it’s occasionally hesitant at lower speeds. Tiptronic shifts are barely noticeable, especially in the upper gears. You may feel a bit of motion transmitted from the road in Sport mode, but never a hint of less-than-perfect control.\n\nCayenne handling could hardly be better. Reactions are quick, certain and confident. The seats are firm but excellent, with snug bolstering and long bottoms for superior thigh support.\n\nPerformance is strong in the less-flamboyant Cayenne S but not in the same league as the Turbo. The Cayenne S may suffer a similar hesitation from the transmission when cornering, but it’s about as surefooted and confident as its more costly sibling.",

      "expert_review": "On a winding road or racetrack, the 2015 Porsche Cayenne will go toe-to-toe with a lot of performance cars, but its annoyances as an SUV will test just how much you care about that.\n\nLarger than it’s sedan sister the Panamera, and heavily revised for 2015, the five-seat SUV comes in twin-turbo V-6 (Cayenne S) and twin-turbo V-8 (Cayenne Turbo) drivetrains; we drove the latter. There’s also a turbo-diesel V-6 in the Cayenne Diesel, plus a Cayenne S E-Hybrid. The E-Hybrid pairs a supercharged V-6 with an electric motor. We cover the hybrid separately in the Research section. All-wheel drive is standard across the board. Compare the Cayenne trims here, or go here to stack up the 2015 and 2014 models.\n\nExterior & Styling\nAbout the same length but significantly wider than before, the Porsche Cayenne sports a reshaped lower grille with sculpted borders. It’s a squared-off take on the same three-portal theme as before, and the changes are subtle. Porsche says the hood, bumper and fenders are new, but you’d have to put the 2014 and 2015 Cayenne side by side to see the differences.\n\nThe updates are easier to spot in back, where the redesigned taillights have a thinner appearance than last year’s more bulbous shapes. The old lights look cartoonish by comparison; this is a big improvement.\n\nUnlike the 911, the Porsche Cayenne doesn’t have a ton of visual changes between base and high-level trims. Aside from some modest ground effects, the biggest visual difference is the wheels. Eighteen-inch alloys are standard, while optional rims run all the way to 21 inches.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe sport-oriented Porsche Cayenne Turbo eats pavement like your dog would chow table scraps at a Brazilian steakhouse. Its twin-turbo V-8, rated at 520 horsepower and 553 pounds-feet of torque for 2015, is up 20 hp and 37 pounds-feet versus last year’s eight-cylinder Porsche Cayenne Turbo. Curb weight is roughly the same, and fuel economy is not a concern.\n\nMash the accelerator and the SUV launches to triple-digit speeds with a degree of ferocity that’s sure to alarm unsuspecting passengers. Interstate passing maneuvers have the standard eight-speed automatic kicking down as many as five gears at once to catapult the SUV in ways no SUV should be able to catapult. Keep a lighter foot on the gas and the eight-speed can occasionally gear hunt, but Sport mode effectively eliminates that with decisive kickdowns.\n\nPorsche lists a zero-to-60-mph time of just over 4 seconds in the Cayenne Turbo, and there’s no reason to doubt it. It’s entirely unnecessary, though, given the Cayenne S’ twin-turbocharged V-6 gets you there in just over 5 seconds — which is still quicker than any SUV needs to be. If you’re wondering what happened to the base, GTS and Turbo S variants, Porsche will bring them back for the 2016 model year. Oh, and the Turbo S’ 570 hp brings a scorching 3.8-second zero-to-60-mph time.\n\nOur Cayenne Turbo employed a three-mode adaptive air suspension, the most elaborate of three setups available in the Cayenne. (Lesser trims offer a steel suspension in fixed and adaptive setups.) Ride quality in the Turbo is on the soft side, keeping with the lux-SUV norm. Its three modes — Comfort, Sport and Sport Plus — are noticeably different, with Sport Plus adding some road feel over most bumps. Still, even at its firmest setting the Cayenne is comfortable.\n\nQuiet and smooth, though — not so much. An aggressive idle-shutoff function cuts engine power a moment before the SUV comes to a complete stop, divesting you of power-steering assist in the process. You can turn the system off, which you’ll want to do; our editors found it a constant annoyance. And the suspension, though comfortable, is noisy, thwacking away at bumps in a manner unbecoming a $100,000-plus SUV. At most speeds, the Michelin Latitude Sport 3 P295/35R21 summer tires on our test car emitted a constant hum. It’s all the more pervasive because at anything less than heavy throttle, the engine’s damn near silent.\n\nLike acceleration, handling goes well beyond the SUV norm. Throw the Porsche Cayenne into a cloverleaf interchange and those Michelin tires grip the pavement like the car is half its weight. The steering has good feedback and sharp turn-in precision. The chassis shows hints of nose-heavy understeer, but a little extra throttle can draw the tail around to straighten you out. Activate Sport Plus mode and the suspension eliminates body roll like no SUV ought to be able to do.\n\nThe suspension can alter ride height by about 3.5 inches between its lowest and highest driving settings. Another console switch engages an off-road program with optimized suspension and drivetrain systems; it can also engage the Cayenne’s locking center and rear differentials. Adjusted to its most hardcore modes, the Cayenne clawed its way through inches-deep mud and split-traction surfaces with little drama, which is probably the extent to which most Cayenne owners will venture off-pavement.\n\nInterior\nAmid acres of wood, chrome and leather, the Porsche Cayenne’s wraparound cockpit rivals Mission Control for buttons and rocker switches. It takes some getting used to, and Porsche should consolidate some buttons. Larger drivers may want more knee and thigh room, which the Cayenne’s high center tunnel inhibits.\n\nOur test car had optional adaptive sport seats that hug your every dimension, but some editors found them uncomfortable despite a plethora of power adjustments. The standard seats have smaller bolsters and fewer adjustments, so be sure to evaluate both types during your test drive.\n\nThe rear seats are adjustable forward and backward, and they can recline a few degrees. The bench sits high enough off the floor, but it could use another inch or so of cushion length for adult-friendly thigh support. Legroom and headroom are good, though a large center floor hump takes up some footwell space.\n\nCargo & Storage\nPorsche seems to think SUV drivers don’t have much stuff. The dearth of storage space in this SUV is downright mean-spirited; when it comes to cabin storage, this is more of a sports car than an SUV. The center console is embarrassing. The cupholders allow travel mugs to tip at the slightest corner. Beyond them and a tiny ashtray (or a like-sized cubby in non-smoking cars), there’s no convenient open storage.\n\nThe limitations extend rearward. Porsche makes the most of the cargo area’s 23.7 cubic feet with a low load floor and rectangular, obstruction-free space. But the overall volume is modest; many two-row luxury SUVs have more room (a lot more, in the case of Mercedes-Benz’s M-Class). The Cayenne’s rear seats fold in a 40/20/40 split, but there’s a significant incline in the extended load floor when they’re down, and any forward adjustment of the seats creates a cargo-catching gap. Hoi-polloi alternatives like the Lexus RX have engineered solutions to this problem, and Porsche needs to do the same.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nStandard equipment includes a touch-screen navigation system with USB/iPod integration and Bluetooth phone/audio. In stark contrast to the hoard of buttons surrounding it, the unit is fairly intuitive. If you want an audio upgrade, surround-sound systems from Bose or Burmester are available.\n\nSafety\nLike the Panamera, the Porsche Cayenne has not been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Lane departure and blind spot warning systems are optional, as is a forward-collision warning system with automatic braking. Click here for a full list of standard safety features or here to see our Car Seat Check.\n\nThe Cayenne Turbo gets larger disc brakes than lesser trims. High-performance carbon-ceramic composite brakes are available on any model, but they’ll run you more than $8,500.\n\nValue in Its Class\nFor about $63,000, including a destination fee, the cheapest 2015 Porsche Cayenne — the Porsche Cayenne diesel — has power seats, dual-zone automatic climate control, leather-and-vinyl upholstery and a pretty generous multimedia setup. (For 2016, a gasoline V-6 base model drops the starting price to just over $59,000.) Typical of German luxury cars, however, features like heated seats, a moonroof, keyless access and a backup camera cost extra in the Cayenne.\n\nThe Cayenne also offers nearly every option under the sun, from soft-close doors and giant wheels to leather trim in every conceivable part of the cabin. Go to town on a Cayenne Turbo and the price tag can spiral past $200,000.\n\nEven at that, the Porsche Cayenne remains a flawed SUV. It’s opulent, stylish and enthralling to drive hard, but not every commute involves winding back roads free of traffic. In the tug of war between sport and utility, the Cayenne remains decidedly on the sport side. Decide if that’s right for you.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "I expected more for $93,000 – the rounded price, including myriad options, of the 2011 Porsche Cayenne S sport-utility vehicle driven for this week’s column.\n\nThe options did not include an available rear-view camera. “Available” means you get the camera, necessary equipment on something as large as an SUV, for several thousand dollars more as part of Porsche’s Premium Package Plus.\n\nTotal cost for the triple-P option, which also includes onboard navigation, bi-xenon headlamps, 14-way power seats with memory, front and rear parking proximity sensors, and a host of other electronic servants, is $11,650.\n\nBut my “meteor grey metallic” Cayenne S, with $27,560 worth of options, did not include a rear-view camera. How is that possible? What’s going on here?\n\nI can get a rear-view camera as standard equipment, or as part of an options package, on an SUV or a car costing one-third as much as this week’s sample Cayenne S. I can get a 2011 Ford Explorer, Jeep Grand Cherokee, Dodge Durango or Toyota Land Cruiser, all fully loaded including rearview camera, for substantially less than the option-bloated price tag of the Cayenne S.\n\nOkay, Porsche fanatics, let me have it. A Ford or Jeep is not a Porsche. Porsche is premium. Porsche is tops.\n\nMy response: Baloney!\n\nIt takes only one serious winter storm to put that nonsense to rest. The Cayenne S, equipped with all-wheel drive, did not get stuck in the snow. But neither did the all-wheel-drive Ford Explorer XLT, which, by the way, was every bit as comfortable and well-made as the Cayenne S. For that matter, the front-wheel-drive Nissan Altima 2.5 S mid-size sedan ($25,450 with options, including rearview camera) did quite well in the snow.\n\nI realize that my complaint here seems silly to many self-avowed “auto enthusiasts, or might come off as low-rent quibbling among the financially well-endowed. But I take it seriously.\n\nWhen does price stop making sense? Exactly what am I getting for $93,000 that I’m not getting for $60,000, $50,000 or $30,000?\n\nFrankly, in the Cayenne S, I don’t think I’m getting much, at least not much that makes any real-world sense.\n\nConsider: The Cayenne S, redesigned for 2011, equipped with a 4.8-liter V-8 engine (400 horsepower, 369 foot-pounds of torque), can move from 0 to 60 mph in 5.6 seconds. It supposedly can reach a cruising speed of 160 mph. So what? In our recent East Coast snowstorms, my Cayenne S moved at the same speed as every other vehicle on the road, which was barely moving at all. And where, oh, where in the heavily regulated United States of America am I going to legally, safely drive anything at 160 mph?\n\nObservers of the U.S. automobile market will note that Porsche has withdrawn the Cayenne GTS and Turbo S, the most off-road-worthy models of the Cayenne line, from its 2011 lineup. There’s a reason for that. Overall, strong Cayenne sales have boosted Porsche’s fortunes in the United States and elsewhere. But the Cayenne GTS and Turbo S weren’t pulling their share of the retail load. It figures.\n\nNot many people will spend the money that Porsche is asking for its SUVs to get them dinged, dented and scratched in the rough.\n\nThey’ll buy Jeeps, Ford Explorers, and four-wheel-drive Dodge Durango and Toyota Highlander models to do that rough stuff. Others with more money will shop at Audi and Land Rover and still spend less money than they’ll spend at Porsche. And nearly all of them will drive away with at least a rearview camera and a vehicle that will serve them as well, as reliably as the Cayenne S serves Porsche’s owners.\n\nI applaud Porsche for innovations such as the eight-speed automatic transmission, with a fuel-saving stop-go feature, in the Cayenne S. And, yes, Porsche’s traction-management system is a wonder to behold around mountain curves and other tricky roads. But stop-go, designed to shut off a vehicle’s engine at stop signs and red lights and automatically restart when the gas pedal is tapped, is also available on many far-less-expensive vehicles. And many less-expensive vehicles can handle mountain curves with aplomb.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in August 2010 about the 2011 Porsche Cayenne. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2012, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nIn its first full redesign since the model’s 2003 debut, the 2011 Porsche Cayenne is quicker, larger, roomier, more efficient and richer than the previous version — and it is still very much a Porsche, on both road and track. Along with new exterior and interior styling, the Cayenne comes with a sliding backseat, increased power and, according to Porsche, better mileage in all versions. Compare the new and old generations here.\n\nV-8-powered Cayenne S and Turbo versions are arriving at dealerships now, and the V-6 version will return this fall along with a new addition: the Cayenne Hybrid S. I’ll evaluate the hybrid in a future review; here I concentrate on the Cayenne S and Turbo, which I tested. The V-6 is still in development and wasn’t available to drive.\n\nIn 2003 I thought the very idea of a Porsche SUV was ill-advised. When the company made it a hefty off-road-capable model rather than a lightweight autobahn-stormer, my outlook became more dire. Wrongo: In short order, the Cayenne became Porsche’s best-selling model. A year later, when Porsche announced it would sell a version powered by a six-cylinder engine — from Volkswagen, no less — again I foresaw disaster. The prospect of staring at the taillights of “lesser” models like the Infiniti FX45 and Jeep Grand Cherokee SRT8 would certainly keep buyers away. Wrong again! In its first six model years, the six-cylinder Cayenne has accounted for 33.8 percent of sales, second to the Cayenne S at 46.4 percent. The high-performance Turbo and Turbo S have made up the rest.\n\nThe model’s success is a testament to the strength of Porsche’s brand and its ability to make a relatively heavy vehicle perform well. For 2011, the Cayenne has shed nearly 400 pounds — that’s a lot in car terms — a chunk of it from the elimination of the previous generation’s two-speed transfer case. Porsche recognized that the additional crawl gear appealed to too few owners to justify its inclusion, and the new eight-speed automatic transmission allows for a very short 1st gear. This change, plus a new multiplate clutch in the standard all-wheel drive, gives the Cayenne all the off-road capability it needs, Porsche says.\n\nPick Your Power\nAs in the 2010, a 3.6-liter V-6 powers the base Cayenne, now with 300 horsepower, up from 290 hp. The S version has a 4.8-liter V-8 and 400 hp, up from 385 hp. The turbocharged version of this engine produces 500 hp, unchanged from 2010, though Porsche says all trim levels are roughly 20 percent more efficient based on the European mileage test cycle. (U.S. figures aren’t available as of this writing.) The base Cayenne is the only model offered with a manual transmission, a six-speed, and it’s standard equipment there.\n\nThe Cayenne definitely feels lighter. Its tires don’t have to work as hard to control lateral inertia, and its reflexes seem sharper. I wouldn’t say it feels light, though. This is still a substantial, large vehicle that may surprise you with its athleticism, but it’s not a car. Porsche cites a zero-to-60 mph time of 5.6 seconds for the Cayenne S, which is nothing to sneeze at, yet it felt — of all things — a bit underpowered on the track at Barber Motorsports Park in Birmingham, Ala. Perhaps it’s the impressive suspension refinement that made the V-8 feel like it wasn’t keeping up. Maybe it’s the quietness inside the cabin, or the generous runoff space at Barber — as well as the wide-open Alabama countryside — that made this urban dweller feel like he was hardly moving.\n\nYet the Cayenne Turbo didn’t give this sensation. It simply goes like mad, with a throatier exhaust note and a satisfying blat with each upshift when under full throttle. Porsche cites the zero-to-60 time as 4.4 seconds, and it hustles from turn to turn, easily reined in by strong brakes with six-piston front and four-piston rear calipers. With each successive trim level, the brake discs get larger, and I was fortunate to take to the track in a loaded Turbo with the ultimate: ceramic composite brake discs, which are optional on all three trim levels for a staggering $8,150 to $8,840, depending on the trim. The Turbo’s standard brakes, which I also tested, do the job, but the ceramics seem to maintain their stopping power time after time with no noticeable brake fade.\n\nTorque Vectoring: A Plus\nThis model was also equipped with the optional Porsche Torque Vectoring Plus system. Available on all trim levels, PTV Plus varies torque between the rear wheels and employs a computer-controlled limited-slip differential. By braking the inside rear wheel, the system essentially overdrives the outside wheel, not unlike Acura’s Super-Handling All-Wheel Drive. Compared with the stock Cayenne Turbo, this one cut corners more sharply, hugged the inside of hairpins and felt more balanced, front to rear, than all other versions, even though the Turbo has the most weight up front — 55.5 percent, according to Porsche. The Cayenne S has 55.0 percent in front and the V-6 will have 54.2 percent with the automatic and 53.9 percent with the six-speed manual.\n\nThough the Cayenne is beyond competent on the track, PTV Plus makes any driver faster by allowing a tighter line. Where some electronic nannies are too intrusive, this one doesn’t seem to cost you any speed — or at least not more than it ultimately makes up for. I thought I could sense that brake nibbling away at the inside rear wheel, but it wasn’t pronounced and it never interrupted my progress.\n\nWhile the Cayenne S can be driven fast, the Turbo begs to be. And for all its capability, it doesn’t give up much in terms of comfort. The standard adaptive suspension has Comfort, Normal and Sport modes, and all three provide decent ride quality of their kind. The Cayenne S models I drove also had this system as an option, along with the air springs that come in handy when it’s time for off-roading — or easing entry, exit or loading by squatting closer to the ground. So equipped, the Cayenne S provided a bit more ride comfort than the Turbo, but I can’t comment on the standard suspension, which necessarily makes a compromise between comfort and sport.\n\nThe Hybrid Influence\nThe Cayenne S and Turbo now have a feature that’s rare outside of hybrid vehicles: Auto Start Stop. The system can automatically turn off the engine when you come to a stop — like at a traffic light — and then restart it when you take your foot off the brake. It’s practically seamless, and impressive. If you’re not impressed, you can turn it off, or, technically, never turn it on from the default off position. Whatever you choose, it will remember your preference every time you start the car. (A centrally located on/off button allows a spouse to change it easily if the better half likes it the other way.)\n\nAlong with this functionality comes another hallmark of hybrids: regeneration of electricity, or, as Porsche calls it, recuperation. In lieu of a simple alternator, there’s a motor/generator, as well as a higher-capacity battery with more deep-cycle characteristics than the typical car battery. This allows the Cayenne to generate electricity when it’s coasting or cruising. Unlike hybrids, this isn’t regenerative braking. The brake pedal doesn’t trigger an increase in generation, but the system will take advantage of states like deceleration, coasting and downhill descent, all under automatic control. According to Porsche, the provisions above are good for 1 or 2 percent of efficiency gain in the European test cycle. Here in the U.S., it could be less.\n\nThough Porsche assures me the brakes have no regenerative function outside of the Cayenne S Hybrid, I have to say I was disappointed by the brake-pedal feel. In both trim levels it felt a little numb and nonlinear on release.\n\nEight-Speed Tiptronic\nThe new eight-speed is well-behaved in Drive and Sport modes, though I thought it upshifted a bit soft under full throttle and occasionally hesitated on the downshift. Overall, though, you have to pay pretty close attention in normal driving to even know it’s there.\n\nIf you opt to shift manually, using the gear selector or the steering-wheel buttons, you’ll find the transmission kicks down with reasonable speed, but it’s not nearly as quick as Porsche’s dual-clutch automated manual. The Cayenne uses a more conventional Tiptronic transmission to provide the off-road capability and high towing capacity: The V-6 model’s maximum is healthy, at 5,952 pounds, and the S and Turbo can handle 7,716 pounds. The latter capacity matches the Land Rover Range Rover Sport exactly and beats the V-8-powered BMW X5 xDrive48i (6,000 pounds) and Infiniti FX50 (3,500 pounds).\n\nInterior\nThe interior is as extensively upgraded as the exterior. Rich materials, including convincing faux metals, replace surfaces that had been substandard since the model’s debut. Authentic materials like brushed aluminum, various woods and carbon fiber are optional, as are expanded leather packages that upholster everything from the dashboard to the steering column.\n\nThe 2011 combines the previous version’s signature center-mounted grab handles with a high center console that rises upward to meet the dashboard, a design adopted from the Panamera sedan. The center-mounted gear selector is delightfully conventional: It goes from P to R to N to D and stays wherever you put it — unlike the regrettable floppy-toggle approach BMW has adopted.\n\nThe front seats are roomy and supportive. Sport seats are standard in the Turbo and optional on the lower trim levels. The number of power adjustments also varies with trim, topping out with optional adaptive sport seats that let you adjust the bottom-cushion length as well as the low and high side bolsters. It makes for quite the cluster of switches on the seat, but Porsche wisely moved the seat-memory buttons to the door, where they’re easily reached.\n\nBackseat roominess is increased, thanks in part to seats that slide forward and back 6.3 inches, allowing passengers to choose copious legroom with less cargo volume behind the backseat, or less legroom with more cargo volume than was available in the 2010 model (23.7 cubic feet, up from 19.1). The 60/40-split backrests also recline now, in three increments. It’s a much more pleasant place to spend time, with or without the optional twin-screen video displays.\n\nSafety\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety hasn’t crash-tested the Cayenne — or any other Porsche — apparently ever. Low-volume models typically go untested, and Porsche, as a brand, is low-volume. The European New Car Assessment Program, whose stringent tests provide some indication of an American model’s crashworthiness, also hasn’t tested any Porsches. Though we find the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s five-star program of limited value, it’s not relevant. That organization hasn’t tested the Cayenne either.\n\nThe Cayenne’s front occupants get frontal, knee and seat-mounted side-impact airbags. There are also side curtain airbags for the front and rear seats, antilock disc brakes and an electronic stability system with traction control. A new blind spot warning system option indicates when another vehicle is in the Cayenne’s blind spot on either side. For a list of all the Cayenne’s standard safety features, see the Safety and Security section on the Standard Equip. & Specs page.\n\nCayenne in the Market\nThe Cayenne seemed a terrible idea to many, and it proved us wrong. Even though the greater movement is away from SUVs, there’s still plenty of interest in crossovers, though those are increasingly hard to define. If it can tow and go off-road like the Cayenne and is relatively inefficient, can you call it a crossover just because it has a unibody platform? Ultimately it doesn’t matter what you call it. As a brand that encompasses both luxury and performance, Porsche can overcome the drift toward more efficient vehicles — especially with this substantially improved Cayenne. For anyone who’s not tied to brand names, though, there are affordable sporty choices in the market, too. Now more than ever this is the case in all vehicle classes, but it doesn’t seem to be hurting Porsche.\n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nPorsche introduced its Cayenne sport utility vehicle in early 2003. Like the stimulating pepper of the same name, this luxury midsize SUV ranks as a hot number — especially the Cayenne Turbo, which has a 450-horsepower twin-turbo V-8. A 340-hp Cayenne S and a V-6 base model are also offered.\n\nA standard six-speed-manual transmission went into the V-6 Cayenne for 2005. New options included Sirius or XM Satellite Radio. For 2006, an electronic logbook is optional and a new three-button remote key is included.\n\nAll Cayennes have permanent all-wheel drive, an inter-axle differential lock and switch-activated Low-range gearing. The Porsche Stability Management system is standard. Volkswagen markets a related Touareg SUV.\n\nExterior\nEven though the Cayenne’s styling is distinctive, its front end is reminiscent of the automaker’s 911 sports car. Like the 911, the Cayenne exhibits what Porsche calls “taut lines and tight curves that communicate a feeling of elegance and speed.”\n\nThe Cayenne Turbo gets additional front air inlets, power domes on the hood and a quartet of tailpipes. The Turbo’s pneumatic suspension adjusts to six ground-clearance levels, from 6.18 to 10.75 inches. Cayennes are available with 17- , 18- , 19- or 20-inch wheels.\n\nInterior\nSeating for up to five people on leather seating surfaces is standard; full leather seats are available. Front and rear parking assistance is included. Cargo capacity totals 19.1 cubic feet and expands to 62.5 cubic feet when the backseat is folded.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Cayenne S and Turbo use 4.5-liter V-8s that team with a six-speed-automatic transmission that incorporates a manual-shift provision. The V-8 in the Cayenne S develops 340 hp and 310 pounds-feet of torque. With its bi-turbo setup, the Cayenne Turbo’s V-8 produces 450 hp and 460 pounds-feet of torque. An optional Power Kit for the Turbo ups engine output to 500 hp.\n\nPorsche’s V-6-powered Cayenne elicits 247 hp from its 3.2-liter engine. Either a six-speed manual or six-speed automatic can be installed.\n\nPorsche claims the Cayenne Turbo can accelerate from zero to 60 mph in 5.2 seconds. Towing capacity is 7,716 pounds.\n\nSafety\nSeat-mounted side-impact airbags and side curtain-type airbags are standard.\n\nDriving Impressions\nBoth Cayenne V-8 models are refined, civilized and muscular, but their performance personalities differ as much as their prices. Acceleration from a standstill is downright startling in the Cayenne Turbo. Passing and merging response is less consistent — sometimes it’s ferociously fast but it’s occasionally hesitant at lower speeds. Tiptronic shifts are barely noticeable, especially in the upper gears. You may feel a bit of motion transmitted from the road in Sport mode, but control is unaffected.\n\nThe Cayenne’s handling could hardly be better. Reactions are quick and confident. The seats are firm, with snug bolstering and long bottoms for superior thigh support.\n\nPerformance is strong in the less-flamboyant Cayenne S but not in the same league as the Turbo. The S is about as surefooted and confident as its more costly sibling.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The Cayenne impresses on the road with fantastic performance credentials, but SUVs need to do more than that, and its control scheme is confounding.\n\nVersus the competition: Though the Cayenne can drive circles around much of its competition, other vehicles offer more family-friendly features at lower prices.\n\nThe 2019 Porsche Cayenne is a full redesign, marking the third generation of the mid-size SUV. Most changes are found in the Cayenne’s engine compartment and interior. When it made its debut at the Frankfurt International Motor Show, Porsche said “the new Cayenne retains a strong visual connection to its predecessors” — a fun way of saying the styling (at least on the outside) isn’t changing much. And that’s fine, because the Cayenne still looks plenty unique; when you see one on the road, you know exactly what it is. The same is true of the new one, but it’ll be a little bit hard to tell if it’s the new generation. The easiest way is to spot the larger front air intakes or the new design of the LED headlights and taillights.\n\nRelated: 2020 Porsche Cayenne S Coupe: 3 Things You Should Know\n\nAs much as things look the same on the outside, the experience behind the wheel is completely different thanks to new engines and a comprehensively redesigned and outfitted cabin. Some of the changes seem to be for the better (the engines), while others are mixed (the interior). Compare the new Cayenne with its 2018 predecessor.\n\nIt’s rare for me to drive two variants of a vehicle for a review, but in this case it seemed warranted because there’s quite a gap between the two in terms of both price and power. I drove a base Cayenne as well as a Cayenne Turbo, which sits below only the Cayenne Turbo S E-Hybrid in the Cayenne hierarchy. There was a difference of 206 horsepower and $58,900 between the two vehicles, and after driving each over an approximately 700-mile road trip, I found …\n\nResearch the 2019 Porsche Cayenne now.\n\nThe Base Is Good\n\nI started out in the base Cayenne. The engines are all turbocharged for 2019, replacing the 2018’s naturally aspirated base V-6 with a turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 that makes 335 hp and 332 pounds-feet of torque. It’s mated to a Tiptronic S eight-speed automatic transmission and standard all-wheel drive. My test vehicle was also outfitted with an adaptive air suspension ($4,160), Off-Road Package and Sport Chrono Package. The latter adds additional sport modes and controls, including a configurable Individual mode, launch control that makes the Cayenne quicker off the line, an additional stability system mode, and both analog and digital stopwatches.\n\nFor a base engine, this powertrain is more than adequate. It adds power quickly and smoothly in a near telepathic fashion. The transmission helps in that regard, knocking off shifts quickly and — more importantly — only when you want it to. It holds gears in corners when pushed (especially in Sport or Sport Plus drive modes) and doesn’t misstep on passing maneuvers.\n\nThe Cayenne’s suspension is also fairly remarkable considering it’s a pretty high-riding SUV with some heft to it (4,377 pounds). My test vehicle rode on 21-inch wheels to boot, which usually means the ride is going to get choppy. Though firmer than most SUVs, it doesn’t beat you up over broken pavement or even a short stint down a gravel road, and that pays off as the road gets twisty. The Cayenne makes its way around a corner better than it has any right to; body roll is present but feels controlled and predictable. For a base model, the Cayenne is rather impressive, but then …\n\nFind a 2019 Porsche Cayenne near you.\n\n… More Turbo Is Better\n\nI hopped next into the Turbo, which jumps from a V-6 up to a twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 that pumps out 541 hp and 568 pounds-feet of torque with the same eight-speed transmission.\n\nHow much difference does 206 hp make? A lot.\n\nIf the base Cayenne’s engine is adequate, the Turbo’s is delightfully excessive. With Sport Chrono, as mine had, the Cayenne Turbo dashes from zero to 60 mph in just 3.7 seconds, with a top speed of 177 mph, Porsche says. That’s in an SUV. Speed doesn’t pour on so much as it’s dumped on top of your head as if from a bucket. In a straight line, the Cayenne Turbo exists as a nondescript dragster with plenty of room for five in its SUV body. To put this into perspective, the BMW M4 and Ford Mustang GT (with Performance Pack 2) that we tested in 2018 posted 0-60 times of 4.15 and 4.25 seconds, respectively, which means the Cayenne Turbo would easily walk away from both of them.\n\nMy test vehicle also added Dynamic Chassis Control ($3,590) and a torque-vectoring rear differential ($1,500) on top of its standard air suspension with active suspension management. It cornered harder and faster than the base Cayenne, and even with all that power underfoot, it shot from bend to bend with nary a misstep. It’s strange to feel so confident driving such a large vehicle quickly, but on dry California roads with summer tires and a suspension working overtime underneath me, the Cayenne Turbo was a delight. If I had one nit to pick, it’s that the suspension is doing so much work that you might feel a touch detached from the road beneath you. That’s the price of keeping everything so tidy.\n\nThe Cayenne Turbo is a true performance SUV, taking the competence of the base model and dialing everything up, especially the acceleration. I particularly liked that the Turbo’s performance remains … reasonable; it doesn’t feel like too much, which sometimes happens with these types of vehicles. Though the cabin remains calm, you know you’re leaving a raucous V-8 din outside and a cloud of dust in your wake.\n\nOut of Control\n\nInside, the five-seat Cayenne has plenty of room for passengers. On one trip, I put three adults in the backseat and didn’t hear any complaints or have to deal with a mutiny after a five-hour drive. Even the middle seat is usable, though the floor hump is quite sizable, so outer passengers must share their footwells. The Cayenne also does one of my favorite things for backseat passengers: put air vents in the B-pillars so you’re not just getting air from the center console.\n\nUp front, there’s a new multimedia system and a redesigned center console. These changes echo the ones found in the Porsche Panamera, and the layout looks great. All the smooth, glossy black panels lead to a 12.3-inch touchscreen, and the whole setup looks very modern and clean. A welcome addition: The screen itself is large and clear with a quick response time, and it even has sensors that can detect when your hand is approaching to bring up a menu of shortcut buttons.\n\nThere are some problems, though. Some simple tasks take way too long, such as changing the radio station. You can’t even move to the next favorite station on your list in one action; you’ll have to pull up the favorites menu and sift through it, using either the touchscreen or a small dial below it. If you use the dial, it starts you not at the station you’re on, but at the beginning of your list. There’s no mechanical button to go to the next track, and the programmable button on the steering wheel simply jumps to the next station on the dial rather than among your presets. These kinds of small oversights add up and get frustrating.\n\nThe touch-sensitive panels on the center console also get a mixed response from me. Each “spot” does require you to press down fairly firmly to activate the control, so you won’t accidentally turn them on or off simply by brushing them with your hand. But the panel itself is a fingerprint magnet; every touch leaves evidence behind. It also works as a kind of mirror, so you might look down and feel like you’re staring directly at the sun if it’s in just the right (or wrong) spot. One final annoyance: In sunlight, you can see labels under the panel for functions your Cayenne may not have.\n\nThankfully, the Cayenne retains physical controls for the volume and basic climate functions, which are easier to use and require less time with your eyes off the road. The Porsche setup isn’t as difficult to use as the dual-screen system in Land Rover and Jaguar products, but it could be made easier with a few updates.\n\nFor those who like to plug in, Apple CarPlay is available but Android Auto is nowhere to be found.\n\n2019 Porsche Cayenne Turbo | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\nPricey Safety\n\nUnfortunately, the Porsche Cayenne has not been crash-tested, which is typical of low-volume luxury vehicles.\n\nThe Cayenne has few standard active-safety features, limited to automatic forward emergency braking with pedestrian detection, front and rear parking sensors and a backup camera. That’s it. No adaptive cruise control, blind spot warnings, lane keep assist or 360-degree camera systems. All are available either as individual options or as part of safety packages, but those boxes weren’t checked on either of my test vehicles save for a blind spot warning system on the Cayenne Turbo that came as part of another package.\n\nGiven the high price of both vehicles, I expected more on the safety front. Perhaps driving all those highway miles without adaptive cruise control and lane keep assist just left me a little cranky, but I do find it ridiculous for features that are increasingly standard on more affordable cars to be left off on the luxury side.\n\nValue\n\nThe Cayenne starts at $66,750 (including a $1,050 destination charge), but my test vehicle jumped all the way up to $82,780 with options, mostly on the performance side. The Cayenne Turbo also comes with quite a price tag, starting at $125,850 (with a $1,250 destination charge). My test vehicle rung up at $146,590 — the biggest culprit being the carbon-ceramic brakes, which were $5,580 all by themselves.\n\nThese Cayennes aren’t cheap, and what you’re paying for is their on-road proficiency — which is, admittedly, very impressive. So much so, in fact, that at times it made me forget my frustrations with the control scheme or the lack of standard safety tech. It really is a fun SUV to drive, and Porsche’s determination to not lose driving feel or precision even in its larger vehicles is laudable. But in real-world situations, where you’re not ripping the Cayenne around, those other issues pop up over and over, and I came away wishing the rest of the vehicle had been given the same attention to detail.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The sports-car SUV enters its second generation this month. It’s the 2008 Porsche Cayenne, the vehicle that gives consumers the most fun you can have driving a family vehicle.\n\nJust the fact that the little German sports-car maker would even have considered creating a sport utility vehicle is surprising. But the company did just that with the launch of the first generation of the Cayenne for 2003.\n\nAnd as Porsche vehicles go, it has been quite successful. In fact, more than 150,000 of them have been sold since production began in the Leipzig, Germany, factory in 2002 – 60,000 of those in North America alone. That makes the Cayenne the best-selling Porsche model, allowing the company to set sales records in the United States for three years in a row.\n\nNow comes the second generation of the Cayenne, with some stylish exterior changes, including new headlights and LED taillights; more interior comfort and conveniences; new safety features; and, of course, more performance.\n\nAnd did I mention – better fuel efficiency, too.\n\nThe Cayenne isn’t cheap, of course. But there are three models to choose from, with prices ranging from almost affordable to quite outrageous.\n\nFor $43,400, the entry-level model, called just the Cayenne, offers a 3.6-liter V-6 engine that produces 290 horsepower and 283 foot-pounds of torque. That’s an increase of 40 horsepower from the 2006 model that the ’08 version replaces. (Porsche did not produce a 2007 model.)\n\nWhile this engine might not have the thrilling power of the next two models up the ladder, it can go from zero to 60 mph in 7.5 seconds, and has a top track speed of 141 mph.\n\nDuring the recent international media introduction of the Cayenne in San Antonio and at the Continental Tire Co. proving grounds near Uvalde, I was able to put the Cayenne models though their paces at a closed test facility, as well as driving them over some rather fun Hill Country roads.\n\nEven the base Cayenne has a suspension is tuned like that of a sports car, allowing the vehicle to hug the pavement quite well on the curves. The Cayenne has the feel of a low-slung sports car, something you won’t find on other SUVs.\n\nEPA fuel-economy ratings for the V-6 model are 14 miles per gallon in the city and 20 mpg on the highway, which puts this vehicle on par with most of the midsize SUVs on the market. These ratings are based on the EPA’s new testing criteria that take effect for model year 2008, so they can’t be compared directly with the 2007 ratings of competitive vehicles, which will be lower next year.\n\nThe 2006 Cayenne with the 240-horsepower engine was rated at 15 city/20 highway, but those figures would be lower than those of the ’08 model using the new criteria. The mileage estimates are the same with either the six-speed manual or six-speed automatic gearbox.\n\nNext is the S model, which comes with a normally aspirated 4.8-liter V-8 engine producing 385 horsepower and 369 foot-pounds of torque. That’s up 45 horsepower from the 2006 model. List price is $57,900.\n\nThis one can go from zero to 60 mph in 6.5 seconds, and has a top speed of 155 mph. EPA ratings are 13 mpg city/19 highway.\n\nThe ultra-high-performance model is the Cayenne Turbo, which lists for $93,700. It has a twin-turbo version of the 4.8-liter V-8 engine, rated at 500 horsepower and 516 foot-pounds of torque. EPA estimates are 12 mpg city/19 highway — quite respectable for this much power.\n\nThis model can reach 60 mph in just 4.9 seconds, and has a top speed of 171 mph. Helping to improve power and fuel-efficiency on the new models is Porsche’s all-new direct fuel injection technology for the Cayenne. It’s standard on all three models. The Cayenne is a rather heavy SUV that can carry five adults and all of their luggage, so the performance figures are quite impressive. Curb weights range from 4,762 pounds for the V-6 with manual gearbox to 5,191 pounds for the Turbo model.\n\nThe manual gearbox is offered only with the V-6 engine; the S and Turbo models come only with the six-speed Tiptronic S automatic, which is optional on the base Cayenne.\n\nFor those who want to get the best performance out of the Cayenne, the Tiptronic transmission offers manual shifting without having to worry about a clutch. Paddles on each side of the steering wheel allow for quick up- and downshifts.\n\nThe car also comes with a “sport” mode that lowers the automatic transmission’s shift points for quicker acceleration.\n\nWith all of that weight and power, brakes are important, and Porsche doesn’t scrimp on them. The brake calipers and discs are larger than those of competing premium SUVs. The biggest and best brakes are on the Turbo model, and are designed to handle the extra horsepower and torque of that vehicle.\n\nThe brake calipers are painted bright red, and are fully visible through the sport wheels. A computer-controlled antilock system is standard, of course, as is electronic brake assist.\n\nAlso new this year is the optional Porsche Dynamic Chassis Control system, which features “active anti-roll bars that almost completely offset body roll in turns, improving handling, comfort and active safety on-road while providing enhanced off-pavement traction,” the automaker says.\n\nAdaptive headlights are another new feature. They turn slightly in the direction the car is turning, allowing for better forward vision. The system is standard on the Turbo and optional on the other models.\n\nIncluded on all models is electronic stability control, a safety feature that is becoming standard throughout the SUV realm, and also is being added to many cars, as well. The Cayenne’s system, called Porsche Stability Management, brings such new functions as pre-loading of the braking system when needed, trailer stability control, and off-road antilock braking. The vehicle can tow trailers weighing up to 7,716 pounds.\n\nThe new Cayennes also come with a rollover sensor that locks the seatbelt latches and deploys the side-curtain air bags if the vehicle begins to roll.\n\nA key option on the Cayenne is the air suspension system (standard on the Turbo), which raises the vehicle to as high as 10.67 inches above the ground for clearing rocks and other obstacles while driving off-road. The regular suspension offers 8.58 inches of ground clearance, which close to that of the base Jeep Wrangler.\n\nThat brings us to another dimension of the Cayenne that is quite surprising for a vehicle that drives like other Porsche sports cars on paved highways. Unlike those other Porsches, the Cayenne can go off-road, too.\n\nWhile it lacks low-range gearing for the most-serious off-roading the Cayenne can tackle most trails – especially when equipped with the air suspension.\n\nThe stability management system with its traction-control features help keep the vehicle under control on dirt roads, something I found out while testing it on an off-road course at the Continental proving grounds.\n\nIn normal driving, the four-wheel-drive system sends 62 percent of the power to the rear wheels, but the ratio changes automatically if wheel-slipping is detected. Power is sent automatically to the wheels that have the best grip.\n\nOther new features for 2008 include a standard power rear lift gate, optional 21-inch sport wheels, a rail-mounted cargo management system, and XM satellite radio.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in July 2015 about the 2015 Porsche Cayenne. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2016, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nOn a winding road or racetrack, the 2015 Porsche Cayenne will go toe-to-toe with a lot of performance cars, but its annoyances as an SUV will test just how much you care about that.\n\nHeavily revised for 2015, the five-seat SUV comes in twin-turbo V-6 (Cayenne S) and twin-turbo V-8 (Cayenne Turbo) drivetrains; we drove the latter. There’s also a turbo-diesel V-6 in the Cayenne Diesel, plus a Cayenne S E-Hybrid that pairs a supercharged V-6 with an electric motor. We cover the hybrid separately in the Research section. All-wheel drive is standard across the board. Compare the Cayenne trims here, or go here to stack up the 2015 and 2014 models.\n\nExterior & Styling\nAbout the same length but significantly wider than before, the Cayenne sports a reshaped lower grille with sculpted borders. It’s a squared-off take on the same three-portal theme as before, and the changes are subtle. Porsche says the hood, bumper and fenders are new, but you’d have to put the 2014 and 2015 Cayenne side by side to see the differences.\n\nThe updates are easier to spot in back, where the redesigned taillights have a thinner appearance than last year’s more bulbous shapes. The old lights look cartoonish by comparison; this is a big improvement.\n\nUnlike the 911, the Cayenne doesn’t have a ton of visual changes between base and high-level trims. Aside from some modest ground effects, the biggest visual difference is the wheels. Eighteen-inch alloys are standard, while optional rims run all the way to 21 inches.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe Cayenne Turbo eats pavement like your dog would chow table scraps at a Brazilian steakhouse. Its twin-turbo V-8, rated at 520 horsepower and 553 pounds-feet of torque for 2015, is up 20 hp and 37 pounds-feet versus last year’s Cayenne Turbo. Curb weight is roughly the same.\n\nMash the accelerator and the SUV launches to triple-digit speeds with a degree of ferocity that’s sure to alarm unsuspecting passengers. Interstate passing maneuvers have the standard eight-speed automatic kicking down as many as five gears at once to catapult the SUV in ways no SUV should be able to catapult. Keep a lighter foot on the gas and the eight-speed can occasionally gear hunt, but Sport mode effectively eliminates that with decisive kickdowns.\n\nPorsche lists a zero-to-60-mph time of just over 4 seconds in the Cayenne Turbo, and there’s no reason to doubt it. It’s entirely unnecessary, though, given the Cayenne S’ twin-turbo V-6 gets you there in just over 5 seconds — which is still quicker than any SUV needs to be. If you’re wondering what happened to the base, GTS and Turbo S variants, Porsche will bring them back for the 2016 model year. Oh, and the Turbo S’ 570 hp brings a scorching 3.8-second zero-to-60-mph time.\n\nOur Cayenne Turbo employed a three-mode adaptive air suspension, the most elaborate of three setups available in the Cayenne. (Lesser trims offer a steel suspension in fixed and adaptive setups.) Ride quality in the Turbo is on the soft side, keeping with the lux-SUV norm. Its three modes — Comfort, Sport and Sport Plus — are noticeably different, with Sport Plus adding some road feel over most bumps. Still, even at its firmest setting the Cayenne is comfortable.\n\nQuiet and smooth, though — not so much. An aggressive idle-shutoff function cuts engine power a moment before the SUV comes to a complete stop, divesting you of power-steering assist in the process. You can turn the system off, which you’ll want to do; our editors found it a constant annoyance. And the suspension, though comfortable, is noisy, thwacking away at bumps in a manner unbecoming a $100,000-plus SUV. At most speeds, the Michelin Latitude Sport 3 P295/35R21 summer tires on our test car emitted a constant hum. It’s all the more pervasive because at anything less than heavy throttle, the engine’s damn near silent.\n\nLike acceleration, handling goes well beyond the SUV norm. Throw the Cayenne into a cloverleaf interchange and those Michelin tires grip the pavement like the car is half its weight. The steering has good feedback and sharp turn-in precision. The chassis shows hints of nose-heavy understeer, but a little extra throttle can draw the tail around to straighten you out. Activate Sport Plus mode and the suspension eliminates body roll like no SUV ought to be able to do.\n\nThe suspension can alter ride height by about 3.5 inches between its lowest and highest driving settings. Another console switch engages an off-road program with optimized suspension and drivetrain systems; it can also engage the Cayenne’s locking center and rear differentials. Adjusted to its most hardcore modes, the Cayenne clawed its way through inches-deep mud and split-traction surfaces with little drama, which is probably the extent to which most Cayenne owners will venture off-pavement.\n\nInterior\nAmid acres of wood, chrome and leather, the Cayenne’s wraparound cockpit rivals Mission Control for buttons and rocker switches. It takes some getting used to, and Porsche should consolidate some buttons. Larger drivers may want more knee and thigh room, which the Cayenne’s high center tunnel inhibits.\n\nOur test car had optional adaptive sport seats that hug your every dimension, but some editors found them uncomfortable despite a plethora of power adjustments. The standard seats have smaller bolsters and fewer adjustments, so be sure to evaluate both types during your test drive.\n\nThe rear seats are adjustable forward and backward, and they can recline a few degrees. The bench sits high enough off the floor, but it could use another inch or so of cushion length for adult-friendly thigh support. Legroom and headroom are good, though a large center floor hump takes up some footwell space.\n\nCargo & Storage\nPorsche seems to think SUV drivers don’t have much stuff. The dearth of storage space in this SUV is downright mean-spirited; when it comes to cabin storage, this is more of a sports car than an SUV. The center console is embarrassing. The cupholders allow travel mugs to tip at the slightest corner. Beyond them and a tiny ashtray (or a like-sized cubby in non-smoking cars), there’s no convenient open storage.\n\nThe limitations extend rearward. Porsche makes the most of the cargo area’s 23.7 cubic feet with a low load floor and rectangular, obstruction-free space. But the overall volume is modest; many two-row luxury SUVs have more room (a lot more, in the case of Mercedes-Benz’s M-Class). The Cayenne’s rear seats fold in a 40/20/40 split, but there’s a significant incline in the extended load floor when they’re down, and any forward adjustment of the seats creates a cargo-catching gap. Hoi-polloi alternatives like the Lexus RX have engineered solutions to this problem, and Porsche needs to do the same.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nStandard equipment includes a touch-screen navigation system with USB/iPod integration and Bluetooth phone/audio. In stark contrast to the hoard of buttons surrounding it, the unit is fairly intuitive. If you want an audio upgrade, surround-sound systems from Bose or Burmester are available.\n\nSafety\nThe Cayenne has not been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Lane departure and blind spot warning systems are optional, as is a forward-collision warning system with automatic braking. Click here for a full list of standard safety features or here to see our Car Seat Check.\n\nThe Cayenne Turbo gets larger disc brakes than lesser trims. High-performance carbon-ceramic composite brakes are available on any model, but they’ll run you more than $8,500.\n\nValue in Its Class\nFor about $63,000, including a destination fee, the cheapest 2015 Cayenne — the diesel — has power seats, dual-zone automatic climate control, leather-and-vinyl upholstery and a pretty generous multimedia setup. (For 2016, a gasoline V-6 base model drops the starting price to just over $59,000.) Typical of German luxury cars, however, features like heated seats, a moonroof, keyless access and a backup camera cost extra in the Cayenne.\n\nThe Cayenne also offers nearly every option under the sun, from soft-close doors and giant wheels to leather trim in every conceivable part of the cabin. Go to town on a Cayenne Turbo and the price tag can spiral past $200,000.\n\nEven at that, the Cayenne remains a flawed SUV. It’s opulent, stylish and enthralling to drive hard, but not every commute involves winding back roads free of traffic. In the tug of war between sport and utility, the Cayenne remains decidedly on the sport side. Decide if that’s right for you.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe all-wheel-drive Porsche Cayenne was redesigned for the 2011 model year. Along with new exterior and interior styling, the Cayenne came with a sliding backseat, increased power and better mileage in all versions. A Cayenne S Hybrid is claimed to deliver the acceleration of a V-8 with the mileage of a V-6. A new Cayenne Diesel debuts for 2013. The five-seat crossover competes with the Infiniti FX, BMW X5 and Land Rover Range Rover Sport.\n\n(Skip to details on the: Cayenne S Hybrid)\n\nNew for 2013\nPorsche’s first diesel engine for the U.S. makes its debut in the 2013 Cayenne SUV. With an estimated 20/28 mpg city/highway, the Cayenne Diesel should get 21 percent better fuel economy than a base Cayenne with a gas V-6 and an automatic transmission. It hits dealerships in fall 2012 with a starting price of $55,750 plus a destination charge.\n\nPower comes from a 240-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 diesel engine that makes 406 pounds-feet of torque at 1,750 rpm. The engine works with an eight-speed automatic transmission and standard all-wheel drive. Porsche cites a zero-to-60-mph time of 7.2 seconds, a top speed of 135 mph and a driving range of 740 miles, longer than most of your passengers will be willing to tolerate in one sitting.\n\nIn addition to the Cayenne Diesel, a new Cayenne GTS also debuts. The GTS is based on the Cayenne S but makes 20 hp more from its V-8 engine for a total of 420 hp, and it features a 20-millimeter lower ride height and a lower final-drive ratio. The V-8 drives an eight-speed automatic that sends power to each of the wheels through an all-wheel-drive system. Its zero-to-60-mph time is 5.4 seconds, according to Porsche, with a top speed of 162 mph.\n\nSpecial GTS styling cues include gloss-black trim, wider wheel arches, a hood and front end shared with the Cayenne Turbo and 20-inch wheels. Unique cabin features include sport seats with Alcantara simulated suede accents and a system that directs engine intake sounds into the passenger compartment. The Cayenne GTS arrives in August 2012 priced at $82,050 plus a destination charge.\n\nA new Cayenne Turbo S trim gets a tuned version of the Cayenne Turbo’s 4.8-liter V-8, making a powerful 550 hp and 553 pounds-feet of torque. With a zero-to-60-mph acceleration time of 4.3-seconds, the 2013 Cayenne Turbo S is Porsche’s quickest SUV. Standard features include unique 21-inch wheels, advanced adaptive handling and chassis control systems, gloss-black exterior accents and an exclusive two-tone leather interior.\n\nExterior\nThe 2011 restyling produced a streamlined crossover that looks more like Porsche’s cars, especially in the headlight design. Even the Turbo, which has the boldest front end with the largest air intakes, looks less exaggerated than the previous generation. The Cayenne is both lighter and longer compared with the prior generation. Exterior features include:\n\nAvailable skid plates and underbody protection for off-roading\nAvailable panoramic glass roof or tilt/sliding moonroof\nLED taillamps\nStandard rear spoiler\nStandard 18-inch wheels; 19-, 20- or 21-inch wheels available\n\nInterior\nWith the Cayenne’s redesign, the interior was as extensively upgraded as the exterior. Rich materials, including convincing faux metals, replace surfaces that had been substandard since the model’s debut. The crossover combines the previous version’s signature center-mounted grab handles with a high center console that rises upward to meet the dashboard.\n\nBackseat roominess was increased, thanks in part to seats that slide forward and back 6.3 inches, allowing passengers to choose copious legroom with less cargo volume behind the backseat or less legroom with more cargo volume than was available in the previous generation (23.7 cubic feet, up from 19.1). The 60/40-split backrests also recline in three increments. Interior features include:\n\nTouch-screen dash display\nOptional Bose or Burmester stereos\nOptional six-CD changer\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 300-hp, 3.6-liter V-6 engine powers the base Cayenne. The new Cayenne Diesel has a 240-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 diesel engine. The S version has a 400-hp, 4.8-liter V-8 (420 hp in the GTS). The turbocharged version of this engine produces 500 hp. The high-performance Turbo S makes 550 hp. Mechanical features include:\n\nBase Cayenne comes with six-speed manual or eight-speed automatic transmission\nDiesel and V-8 models are only available with an automatic transmission\nAutomatic-transmission models feature fuel-saving stop/start technology (except Cayenne Diesel)\nLeft-right torque vectoring and a locking differential are optional on the rear axle\nOptional adaptive suspension\nOptional active suspension\n\nSafety\nThe Cayenne’s front occupants get frontal, driver’s knee and seat-mounted side-impact airbags. There are also side curtain airbags for both rows of seats. Additional safety features include:\n\n\nAntilock brakes\nElectronic stability system\nTraction control\nOptional blind spot warning system\nOptional adaptive cruise control\n\n \n\nCayenne S Hybrid\nThe Cayenne S Hybrid combines acceleration comparable to that of the V-8-powered Cayenne S with the efficiency of a V-6, according to Porsche. It teams a 333-hp, supercharged 3.0-liter V-6 with two electric motors and a 288-volt battery pack for a combined 380 hp and 428 pounds-feet of torque.\n\nUnlike some hybrids, the Cayenne S Hybrid uses a step-gear automatic transmission, a version of the eight-speed automatic in the other Cayennes. The hybrid can accelerate up to 40 mph in electric mode, which compares to other hybrids, but it also utilizes a “sailing” mode that shuts the engine off, allowing coasting at speeds as high as 97 mph. The Cayenne S Hybrid also features stop/start technology that’s found in other Cayennes. Porsche claims the Cayenne S Hybrid will go from zero to 60 mph in 6.1 seconds and achieve a top speed of 150 mph. Back to top",

Competitors include the BMW X6 and Land Rover Range Rover Sport.\n\n(Skip to details on the: Porsche Cayenne Turbo S)\n\nNew for 2010\nFor 2010, the Cayenne receives two limited-production models, the Cayenne S Transsyberia and GTS Design Edition 3. Transsyberia models are rally-inspired editions with Porsche’s height-adjusting suspension and available roof-mounted auxiliary lights. The GTS Design Edition 3 is a cosmetic package that adds styling pieces from Porsche’s design team.\n\nExterior\nThe Cayenne shares a strong resemblance to its Porsche-family relatives. The Cayenne Turbo gets additional front air inlets, power domes on the hood and a quartet of tailpipes.\n\nPower liftgate\nPower/heated side mirrors\nRain-sensing wipers with heated washer jets\nOptional panoramic sunroof\nOptional 17-, 18-, 19-, 20- or 21-inch wheels\nOptional headlight washers\nOptional adaptive bi-xenon headlamps\n\nInterior\nThe Cayenne’s five-seat interior carries over mostly unchanged for 2010. Like other Porsches, the Cayenne features the make’s signature instrument cluster and a sporty three-spoke steering wheel.\n\nLeather upholstery\nSteering-wheel-mounted cruise and audio controls\nLeather-bound dash and center console\nOptional genuine wood, carbon fiber or metal trims\nOptional 14-speaker Bose audio system\nOptional navigation system\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Cayenne’s base engine is a V-6, while the midlevel Cayenne gets a V-8. If you want even more power, there’s a turbocharged V-8 on the Turbo and Turbo S.\n\nStandard full-time all-wheel drive\n290-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 with 273 pounds-feet of torque (base)\n385-hp, 4.8-liter V-8 with 369 pounds-feet of torque (S)\n405-hp, 4.8-liter V-8 with 369 pounds-feet of torque (GTS, S Transsyberia)\n500-hp, twin-turbocharged 4.8-liter V-8 with 516 pounds-feet of torque (Turbo)\n540-hp, twin-turbocharged 4.8-liter V-8 with 516 pounds-feet of torque (Turbo with Power Kit)\n550-hp, twin-turbocharged 4.8-liter V-8 with 553 pounds-feet of torque (Turbo S)\nOptional adaptive air suspension with ride control\nOptional speed-sensitive, sport-tuned steering\nOptional limited-slip differential\nOptional ceramic brakes\n\nSafety\n\n\nSide-impact airbags\nSide curtain airbags\nAntilock brakes with brake assist\nElectronic stability system\nTraction control\nOptional front/rear parking sensors\nOptional backup camera\n\nPorsche Cayenne Turbo S\nThis flagship manages to muscle out more power from the Turbo’s V-8. The Turbo S can accelerate from zero to 60 mph in 4.7 seconds. The model comes standard with Porsche’s Dynamic Chassis Control, which features active suspension control that limits body lean during sharp turns.\n\nUnique visual features include extended wheel arches and a matte-finished grille. The dual-twin tailpipes are made of cast aluminum and were inspired by the Carrera GT’s, Porsche says.\n\n550-hp, twin-turbocharged 4.8-liter V-8 with 553 pounds-feet of torque\nSix-speed automatic transmission with manual shift control\n21-inch alloy wheels, equipped with performance tires\nLeather seats, steering wheel, gearshift and dash\nCarbon fiber trim inserts\nSimulated-suede headliner Back to top",

      "expert_review": "Believe it or not, Porsche’s best-selling car is an SUV. The Cayenne outsold Porsche’s signature 911 lineup in 2008, and that trend has continued this year.\n\nWith five Cayenne trim levels and two special editions, the SUV has almost as many variants as the 911, which gives it a huge range of consumer appeal. Positioned squarely in the middle of the Cayenne lineup is the GTS, which is the model I tested.\n\nThere’s no doubting the Cayenne’s authenticity as a performance SUV — after all, it’s a Porsche. As a modern SUV fit for everyday driving, however, it misses the mark. Even with $15,575 worth of upgrades and a $90,175 as-tested price, some seemingly useful features — that we see in much less expensive SUVs — were absent.\n\nGTS, Defined\nThe GTS gets a 405-horsepower, 4.8-liter V-8, a standard air suspension with electronic adjustable dampening (you choose your preferred level of firmness) and a bevy of appearance add-ons. The Cayenne lineup ranges from $44,600 for a base Cayenne up to $123,600 for the Turbo S. The GTS starts at $70,900 for the manual version and $74,600 for an automatic.\n\nI tested the automatic. There’s nothing wrong with it, but I suspect a manual would have added credibility to the Cayenne’s sport-themed performance. The available manual transmission is one of the Cayenne’s unique features that isn’t available in any of its competition, like the BMW X5 or Land Rover Range Rover Sport.\n\nAcceleration & Handling\nThe 405-hp V-8 moves the GTS quickly, but it isn’t what I’d call fast. Porsche says zero to 60 mph takes 6.1 seconds for the automatic version I tested, while the manual goes in 5.7 seconds. For similar dough, you can get a 555-hp BMW X5 M that scoots to 60 mph in just 4.5 seconds. Now that’s fast.\n\nThe best part of the GTS engine is the way it sounds. The V-8 changes tone with the push of a button: When the Sport button is pressed, an intoxicating soundtrack taunts you to play with the accelerator. I gladly obliged, even though it was a case of more bark than bite.\n\nIn everyday driving, the Cayenne feels like a substantial SUV, with heavy steering. It wasn’t until I started throwing the SUV into corners that the hefty feeling was transformed into a surprising display of agility. Thank a tag-team of acronyms for the GTS’ handling prowess: Porsche Traction Management (PTM), Porsche Active Suspension Management (PASM), automatic brake differential (ABD) and anti-slip regulation (ASR) all work together to make the GTS corner with minimal body roll, and to keep power planted to the ground.\n\nThe suspension and all-wheel drive (Porsche Active Suspension Management and Porsche Traction Management) can adjust on the fly to best maneuver the heavy SUV by lowering and stiffening the suspension, as well as transferring power between the wheels.\n\nAvailable suspension modes include Sport, Normal and Comfort. Sport mode lowers the air suspension and firms up the shocks. It’s noticeably stiffer than Normal mode’s settings and reduces body roll during spirited driving. I had a tougher time discerning between Normal and Comfort modes.\n\nMore Sport Than Utility Vehicle\nYou don’t expect to find many conveniences in a sports car’s driver’s compartment, like storage or cupholders, but you do in an SUV. The Cayenne disappoints with only two cupholders up front — and they barely fit a bottle of water. Even an ordinary medium-sized fast-food cup didn’t fit securely. C’mon, Porsche, you do realize Americans are buying the Cayenne, don’t you?\n\nIn the back, creating a flat load floor in the cargo area requires multiple steps. None of those steps are particularly graceful, and it’s a pain to remove the headrests, flip up the bottom seat cushions, and fold and secure the head restraints. You can arrange a flat load floor in most SUVs with one pull of a lever and no head-restraint removal.\n\nFor an SUV that sits high off the ground and has limited rear visibility, a rear backup camera and parking sensors are essential. The Cayenne’s $3,300 navigation option doesn’t include a backup camera or parking sensors. They’re optional — and they’re expensive. These are commonly found in less expensive SUVs, either included with the navigation system or available as a stand-alone option.\n\nInside\nFor the most part, the inside is covered in quality materials you would expect from Porsche. Fine stitching carries through the leather-covered dashboard, center console, seats and door panels. The optional Alcantara simulated suede looks classy in its highlighted use on the pillars and front and rear seats. The speedometer and tachometer gauges are classic old-school Porsche. The amber-colored backlighting looks outdated to me, but those buying a Porsche may appreciate its dedication to heritage.\n\nNot so classy is the aluminum-looking plastic on the door panels and gear selector. A few editors commented on how cheap those materials looked, and even a few passengers I carted around said the same thing. I think just adding a brushed finish would have spiced up the bland appearance.\n\nThe front and rear seats are stylish, and even the rear seats have side bolstering I would argue is more aggressive than some front seats out there. The front seats were comfortable on short rides, but after longer excursions my lower back became sore because I couldn’t find a comfortable seating position. You may have better luck finding the sweet spot than I did.\n\nFeatures & Pricing\nIn typical Porsche fashion, be prepared to empty your wallet for the simplest conveniences, like satellite radio and a USB input for iPods. Adding those two options meant an additional $1,190 on our tester. To give some perspective, a USB input and satellite radio come standard on a 2010 Hyundai Sonata, which costs less than $20,000. (In fairness, Hyundai is ahead of the curve on USB inputs, but some luxury carmakers are also starting to make them standard.)\n\nThose features are a drop in the bucket compared with the cost of the leather interior with Alcantara highlights ($3,170) and the navigation system ($3,300). The optional Bose sound system ($1,690) sounded good, but could have used some more punch from the bass; its price, however, is reasonable considering what some other options cost. All in all, our tester checked in at an eye-popping $90,175.\n\nRemember the missing backup camera and parking sensors? That package costs $2,670, and it’s only available if you’ve already added the navigation system.\n\nWhat Else $90,175 Can Get You\nThat high sticker price was hard to justify after spending a week in the GTS. Every time I got into the car I couldn’t help thinking, “What else could I get for $90,000?”\n\nThat high price tag is already hard to swallow, but the introduction of the $85,400, 555-hp 2010 BMW X5 M makes it an even bigger knock against the Porsche. The GTS is quick, but the X5 M approaches ludicrous speed with its awesome acceleration. To be honest, the first time I planted the accelerator to the floorboard in the X5 M I felt as giddy as a 16-year-old taking his dad’s sports car out alone for the first time. I was able to find many X5 M’s in Cars.com’s inventory in the $85,000 – $95,000 range.\n\nCayenne GTS in the Market\nGiven that it’s a Porsche, you’re not looking at a value winner with this SUV. That was clear in our loaded tester, which didn’t even feel like it had all the necessary SUV options and provisions for daily driving. It did at least feel like a Porsche in the way it performed on the pavement and the way it sounded and looked, though, and that may be enough for some to overlook its flaws.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "The world didn’t exactly need another four-door SUV “coupe,” but Porsche did, and it’s making up for lost time with its new 2020 Cayenne Coupe. It’s silly to call these things “coupes,” but at least this one is from a company that also has a great line of actual coupes. The Cayenne Coupe follows the current fashion of taking a big SUV, trading practicality for a trendier look and jacking up the price over the SUV upon which it is based: The Cayenne Coupe starts just shy of $10,000 more than a squared-off Cayenne, at $76,550.\n\nRelated: 2019 Cayenne: Porsche Didn’t Mess With a Good Thing\n\nPorsche is late to get into this competition. The Cayenne Coupe will challenge the X6 from BMW, which also already has the X4 and X2 SUV coupes; Mercedes-Benz offers coupe versions of its GLE– and GLC-Class SUVs; and Audi is in the game (sorta, given the more moderate profile) with the new Q8. Still, better to be a little behind the trend than too far ahead — a moment of silence here for the dearly departed Acura ZDX.\n\nWhat you don’t get for more money with the Cayenne Coupe versus the Cayenne classic is more power. Under the hood of the base model is the same turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 putting out 335 horsepower, good for zero-to-60 mph in 5.7 seconds and a top speed of 151 mph. The top-of-the-line Cayenne Turbo Coupe gets the familiar twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8 putting out 541 hp; Porsche puts its zero-to-60 time at 3.7 seconds and top speed at 178 mph.\n\nThe starting price for the Turbo, the only other model that will be offered at launch in the U.S. in the fall, is $131,350, a relative bargain at just $5,500 more than the Cayenne Turbo’s $125,850 entry price. If you check all the option boxes, including orange paint and black 22-inch wheels, you could pad the check to just shy of $200,000 (configurator here), or you could be more restrained and use the savings to also take home a Boxster for your weekend car.\n\nHere are six things you do get with a base Cayenne Coupe versus a regular Cayenne for 10 grand more:\n\n1. A (Much) Sleeker Roofline\n\nThe roof starts 0.78 inch lower, creating a shorter windshield, and front roof pillars curve back and down into a slightly broader rear end that’s better looking than most in this genre. As with the Panamera, the slope and shape of the back pillar are intended to evoke the 911 roofline.\n\n2. A Glass Roof (Carbon Fiber Optional)\n\nThe standard roof is a fixed panoramic dark-glass panel (with a sunshade included). A carbon-fiber roof is optional as part of one of three “lightweight sports packages” that shave a few pounds from the hefty SUV.\n\n3. Two Rear Spoilers\n\nThe sloping roof allows both a standard roof spoiler above the rear window and a standard adaptive spoiler below the window that rises 5.3 inches at speeds above 56 mph. The regular Cayenne makes do with a roof spoiler (adaptive on the Cayenne Turbo).\n\n4. More Standard Performance Gear\n\nThe base model includes Porsche’s adaptive suspension, Sport Chrono Package with launch control and 20-inch wheels.\n\n5. A Cozy Backseat\n\nStandard individual sport seats create a backseat for two, though you can opt for the Cayenne-style bench. Porsche did not offer specs for room but noted that the Coupe’s rear seats are 1.18 inches closer to the floor (and your knees higher) to provide “plenty of headroom despite the vehicle’s sporty lowered silhouette.”\n\n6. Less Cargo Space\n\nCargo space in the base model is 22 cubic feet behind the rear seats and 54.3 with the seat backs folded. That compares to 27.2 and 60.3 cubic feet, respectively, in the base version of the Cayenne SUV. The Turbo has even less room for your stuff, at 21.2 and 53.3 cubic feet.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "It’s fast, it’s rare and it’s astonishingly expensive — but the 2014 Porsche Cayenne Turbo S is also extremely capable, the apparent answer to the question of what the ultimate Porsche station wagon would look like.\n\nThe moaning and wailing from purists was palpable when sports car brand Porsche introduced the five-seat Cayenne SUV, but given that the truck has become Porsche’s most popular seller and has allowed the German automaker to continue to produce the road rockets that everyone with a pulse enjoys driving, the appropriateness of the idea of a Porsche SUV is no longer a valid discussion.\n\nSuffice it to say that the popular Cayenne has done wonders for Porsche’s bottom line, so we sampled one to see what all the fuss was about. Our test vehicle was a 2014 Porsche Cayenne Turbo S, a top-of-the-line model with the most powerful engine available, the strongest brakes available and the model’s most opulent interior. It comes with an opulent price tag, as well: $177,305, including the destination charge. The Cayenne received some mild revisions for 2014, including a new eight-speed automatic transmission (compare the 2013 and 2014 models here).\n\nExterior & Styling\nIt certainly doesn’t look like a Volkswagen Touareg — the big SUV with which the Cayenne shares its basic structure — except perhaps around the doors, which are the only shared sheet metal between the two. The front end looks distinctively Porsche, with big, round headlights flanking a low and gaping grille opening. The taillights are also suitably Porsche-like, and the whole truck is easily identifiable as part of the Porsche family. The Turbo S adds a few sportier trim options, like gloss-black air intakes and headlight and mirror housings, while the wheels are upgraded to standard 21-inch gloss-black units with full-color Porsche crests. My test car was decked out in white paint but still managed to turn heads thanks to a combination of black wheels, yellow brake calipers and a bright red interior. You can have a more subtle color combination, but when spending this kind of money, why would you?\n\nHow It Drives\nThe Cayenne has a surprising number of available powertrains, including a base 300-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6; a 240-hp, diesel 3.0-liter V-6; three variants of a 4.8-liter V-8; and, at the top of the line, the 550-hp, twin-turbocharged 4.8-liter V-8 that was in our Turbo S. That engine is mated to a standard eight-speed automatic that sends power to all four wheels.\n\nThe combination rockets the Cayenne Turbo S from zero to 60 mph in just 4.3 seconds on its way to a 178 mph top speed — astonishing performance for a big vehicle that weighs more than 4,800 pounds. A Sport mode button changes various settings to allow for even more aggressive performance, with more immediate shifts and a more sensitive throttle as well, but leaving it in Normal mode is perfectly acceptable given the car’s impressive power reserves. Acceleration is extraordinarily strong, downshifts are quick and snappy, and at no point is there any lag or wait for the turbos to spool up. Put your foot down, and you’re gone.\n\nHandling is not quite as Porsche-direct as in the company’s sports cars, but for a big SUV it’s more than acceptable. The Cayenne Turbo S feels like a large sport sedan, with flat cornering and decent feedback through the steering wheel to let you know what the tires are doing. Ride quality is outstanding only when in Normal mode — click into Sport mode, and the suspension stiffens up considerably. It would be best for twisty canyon commuting in the Los Angeles mountains, but in the Midwest’s typical straight, flat, long-distance highway driving, Normal mode is the way to go. My only quibble with the Cayenne Turbo S’ performance involves the brakes — massive carbon-ceramic composite units that do indeed stop the Cayenne with authority and considerable force. In normal operation, though, they make an unbelievable amount of noise — these are racing brakes, best suited to cars that see more use on a track than on a grocery run. They’re questionable on any kind of street car, but they’re patently ridiculous on an expensive SUV that’s never going to be driven in anger around a racetrack. Unless they’re broiling hot and being subjected to hard lap after hard lap, they’re eventually going to do what they did on my test vehicle — squeal like a poorly maintained city bus. Stopping at every light became an exercise in modulating the pedal to try to avoid the noise, as its considerable volume would invariably attract unwanted, annoyed stares and rattle my passengers. The standard brakes on the Cayenne — even the Turbo S — are conventional steel rotors. Save yourself $8,840 and stick with those rather than opting for the carbon-ceramic composite kit.\n\nThe Cayenne’s competitors also go after premium SUV buyers searching for performance capability along with passenger utility. The Land Rover Range Rover Autobiography has a supercharged 5.0-liter V-8 that makes a similar 510 hp; it also features an eight-speed automatic transmission and an opulent interior. Its recent all-aluminum redo means it’s considerably lighter than it used to be, but it still weighs nearly 440 pounds more than the Porsche, making it slower and skewed more toward opulent luxury than performance. The Mercedes-Benz ML63 AMG, however, has performance in spades, featuring a 550-hp, twin-turbocharged 5.5-liter V-8 and the sport suspension, brakes and trim pieces needed to make use of it. It seats five, like the Porsche, but is considerably less expensive.\n\nIf forced induction motors aren’t your thing — and you think there’s just no replacement for displacement — have a go at the Jeep Grand Cherokee SRT with its naturally aspirated 6.4-liter Hemi V-8. It pumps out only 470 hp, but it weighs less than the Range Rover and makes a basso soundtrack that none of its competitors can replicate. While not as sophisticated as the Cayenne Turbo S, it’s also a fraction of that SUV’s cost and very nearly as fast.\n\nFuel economy for the Turbo S model is predictably poor: it’s rated 14/20/16 mpg city/highway/combined, and that jives with the 16.2 mpg I saw in a week of mixed use that included several hundred highway miles. If you’re worried about fuel economy, go for the Cayenne Diesel, featuring a turbocharged V-6 diesel engine good for 20/29/23 mpg, or the Cayenne S Hybrid, rated 20/24/21 mpg. For what it’s worth, the Cayenne Turbo S fares better than most competitors’ sporty SUVs, besting the ML63 AMG’s 13/17/15 mpg and the Grand Cherokee SRT’s 13/19/15 mpg, and barely edging out the Range Rover’s 14/19/16 mpg.\n\nInterior\nWhatever your opinion of the exterior styling, the interior silences all critics. It is a truly stunning piece of art, vastly different from the VW Touareg. Sculpted forms in the dash use real aluminum trim to evoke the idea of exposed metal structure, and combined with the fantastic deep-red, two-tone leather and contrasting stitching, the cabin looks like a modern, appealing and thoroughly sporty environment.\n\nOutward visibility is good, thanks to the high seating position. Space up front is plentiful, with front passengers having no shortage of room to spread out in multi-adjustable, heavily bolstered sport seats. Backseat space, though, is surprisingly cramped for such a big vehicle, with leg and hip room feeling comparable to a compact car. The seats do slide forward and back, allowing parents easier access to little ones in child-safety seats there. Fully individual four-place climate control comes standard in the Turbo S, meaning there’s a raft of buttons for the backseat as well.\n\nSome of the competition is bigger on the inside than the Cayenne — most notably the Range Rover, whose long-wheelbase model has 47.5 inches of second-row legroom that beats all competitors (Porsche does not publish rear-seat dimensions for the Cayenne).\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nApparently, Porsche doesn’t believe in the latest trend of using menus in the multimedia system to control functions, and that’s OK by me; I prefer having a dedicated switch whose position and function I can learn to having to hunt through menus using a rotary knob or touch-screen. The problem is that there’s an almost unbelievable number of buttons on the dash and center console — I counted more than 50 buttons, switches, knobs and toggles. They operate everything from climate control to various suspension and engine settings. Finding what you need at a glance isn’t going to happen, so you’d best study the arrangement before you go anywhere.\n\nThe Cayenne’s multimedia system works well but is not the most intuitive to use. The optional Burmester sound system is impressive, with excellent adjustability for various music types. Multimedia voice commands are old-school, however — very basic and menu-specific: You can’t give a navigation command if the system display is on the audio screen, for example, and changing radio bands is a mystery I was never able to figure out.\n\nCargo & Storage\nJust as this isn’t the most spacious SUV for passengers, neither is it the biggest cargo-hauler. With the seats up, the Cayenne features 23.7 cubic feet of cargo room, expandable to 62.9 cubic feet with the backseat folded. The Range Rover beats that with 32.1 cubic feet of space, expandable to 82.8 cubic feet thanks to that long wheelbase, but even the standard-length Range Rover comes with 71.7 cubic feet of total room (space behind the second row is unchanged). The latest Grand Cherokee SRT is bigger than one might expect, featuring 35.1 cubic feet of cargo space behind the backseat, with a maximum of 68.7 cubic feet, while the ML63 AMG features the most rear cargo space, at 38.2 cubic feet that’s expandable to 80.3 cubic feet — almost as much as the LWB Range Rover.\n\nSafety\nThe Porsche Cayenne has not been crash-tested. A decent list of safety equipment is optional, however, including lane departure warning, automatic cruise control with full autonomous braking, front and rear park assist with a backup camera, and the Porsche Dynamic Lighting System, which creates an optimum headlight illumination pattern. See the full list of Porsche Cayenne standard equipment here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe Cayenne has a considerable price range, starting at $50,595, including destination, for a base V-6 model and stretching up to an eye-popping $146,995 (excluding options) for the Turbo S model we drove. But being a Porsche, its sticker price doesn’t end there. A laundry list of leather-wrapped, custom-painted or carbon-fiber-trimmed options can be specified, with my test car including items such as $800 ventilated front seats, $1,090 illuminated carbon-fiber door sills, $2,690 active cruise control, the $3,990 Burmester sound system and an $8,840 ceramic composite brake option. The grand total for this well-equipped Cayenne Turbo S: an astonishing $177,305. Choose your own options for the Cayenne here.\n\nAs high as this seems, it’s possible to option up competitors to similar levels. The Range Rover Autobiography model with a supercharged V-8 starts at $137,675, climbing to $143,025 for the LWB model. That’s pretty much loaded, however, with only a couple of options, like lane departure warning, to add to the price. Slightly less expensive but no less capable is the Mercedes-Benz ML63 AMG, starting at $98,175 and climbing to more than $115,000 if you tick all the options. The performance bargain of the group is the Jeep Grand Cherokee SRT. With its massive V-8 engine, brutal speed and comfortable accommodations for five, it’s a bargain at just $65,375 to start or $75,840 if you load it up with a panoramic roof and fancy leather seats.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2024 Porsche Cayenne nails every point on the spectrum of the driving experience from sedate to sporty, and its updated cockpit brings welcome technological advancements with only minor complaints.\n\nVersus the competition: Few luxury SUVs are anywhere near as engaging to drive as the Cayenne, and it doesn’t mistake technology for luxury in the way that some competitors do — but it doesn’t come cheap.\n\nMost SUVs struggle to exist in multiple worlds. Focusing on practicality can negatively impact performance and vice versa. I was recently one of three judges in a comparison test of mainstream compact SUVs, and the two most fun-to-drive entrants — and they were legitimately fun to drive — finished in last and next-to-last place.\n\nThe alchemy that goes into making an SUV engaging to drive with minimal sacrifice to practicality may or may not involve invoking eldritch gods, but whatever it takes, Porsche is close to mastering it after decades of practice with its Cayenne SUV. For the 2024 model year, Porsche gives the Cayenne subtly updated styling, ups the power across the lineup and refines the suspension to improve handling. The cockpit is also all-new and borrows heavily from the Taycan electric sedan. Not new: All versions of the Cayenne come standard with all-wheel drive and an eight-speed automatic transmission and, with the exception of the coupe-only Turbo GT, are available in both SUV and four-door “coupe” (read: sloped roofline) body styles.\n\nRelated: 2024 Porsche Cayenne: Spicy SUV Gets Upgraded Performance, New Styling, New Tech\n\nI recently traveled to Los Angeles to spend some time behind the wheel of the updated Cayenne (per Cars.com’s ethics policy, we pay for our travel and lodging at such manufacturer-sponsored events). Given a choice of European-market Cayennes to take out for the day, I grabbed a Cayenne S coupe, which turned out to be closest from a features standpoint to the model that’ll be sold here. I wanted to try out the new V-8 engine in the Cayenne S, and while I would’ve preferred the more popular SUV body style, sometimes you take what you can get. For what it’s worth, about 30% of Cayenne sales since the coupe’s introduction in the 2020 model year have been coupes, according to Porsche. Porsche sells far fewer plug-in hybrid Cayennes, regardless of body style.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nDriving Excellence\n\nWith 468 horsepower and 442 pounds-feet of torque, the Cayenne S gets an additional 34 hp and 37 pounds-feet of torque out of its new twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8 compared with the previous S variant’s twin-turbo 2.9-liter V-6. Power feels more than ample; press the accelerator pedal, and you can feel the force building before it comes on in a flood. There’s a bit of a delay in its power delivery, but it’s not overly frustrating, and it never hampered passing or merging. Want to skip the delay? Opt for the Sport Chrono Package and get access to Sport Response mode, which for 20 seconds primes the turbos and transmission for more immediate response. The active exhaust system burbles and pops for a pleasant soundtrack in the Cayenne’s most aggressive driving mode, Sport Plus, but in its quieter setting, it won’t annoy the neighbors.\n\nDriving enjoyment in a Porsche is about more than just going fast in a straight line, and despite nearly 5,000 pounds of bulk, the Cayenne delivers. The optional air suspension that was on my test vehicle is new, and Porsche says it provides greater differentiation than the old version between Normal, Sport and Sport Plus driving modes.\n\nThere wasn’t a previous-generation Cayenne to validate that claim in the moment, but I can say that the new air suspension does an incredible job of making the Cayenne feel comfortable in Normal then dialing up the performance as you move through Sport into Sport Plus. Even in Normal mode, there’s very little body roll in corners, and it lessens as the modes get more aggressive; regardless of driving mode, the isolation from bumps and road imperfections is outstanding. Even with my test car’s optional 22-inch wheels (20s are standard) making the ride feel firm, it was never harsh, and as the suspension firmed up, the degree of control increased. Steering feel is excellent and incredibly communicative, making the Cayenne feel nimble and far smaller than it is. The optional rear-axle steering helps with this, too, particularly in lower-speed maneuvers.\n\nThe eight-speed automatic isn’t new but it bears mentioning simply for how good it is. It was never in the wrong gear and is capable of seamless five-gear kickdowns under hard acceleration. The paddle shifters are fun to use, but the transmission behaves so well when left to its own devices that they become one less thing to worry about.\n\nThe optional carbon-ceramic brakes have incredible stopping power along with good, linear pedal feel. They also provide so much initial bite that it can be difficult to come to a smooth stop in traffic; unless you’re taking your Cayenne to the track, I have a feeling the standard (and larger for 2024) brakes will suffice.\n\nAll in all, the S model feels like it might be the sweet spot of the Cayenne lineup, with more power and performance than the base SUV, but not the extra bulk of the E-Hybrid’s plug-in hybrid powertrain or the significantly higher price tag of the Turbo GT. I certainly had more fun driving the Cayenne S than driving things like the BMW X3 M Competition or Audi RS Q8.\n\nTaking From the Taycan\n\nDriving performance isn’t the only thing Porsche aimed to improve with the new Cayenne. Inside, a new 12.6-inch digital instrument panel and 12.3-inch touchscreen display increase the level of technology considerably. The gauge cluster is highly configurable but also easy-to-use. The same goes for the center touchscreen, which includes standard wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity (or, at least, it will; our Euro-spec cars had some issues with the feature here in the U.S.). The display takes some time to boot up, but once it does, it’s very responsive. All of this will look familiar to those who have seen or been inside a Taycan, and it’s a welcome improvement overall. Front passengers can also have an optional 10.9-inch dashboard touchscreen for streaming videos, controlling navigation and more — it remains invisible to the driver, however, to prevent distraction.\n\nDespite the improvements, Porsche didn’t mistake technology for luxury. Mercedes-Benz has been the biggest offender in this area of late, with giant, confusing screens and unnecessarily complex controls, but in the Cayenne, everything is straightforward to use and materials are high-quality throughout. Ease of use, comfort and materials are what truly make a vehicle luxurious — at least to me. Tradition helps, too; while the turn-key ignition in the Cayenne has been replaced by a push-button starter, it remains to the left of the steering wheel per Porsche tradition.\n\nOne quibble with the interior is the almost delicate, dash-mounted gear selector that lacks a substantial feel I think the Cayenne deserves. It does, however, free up space on the center console for a new climate control panel that has a combination of touch-sensitive controls and rocker switches. The switches feel great, and the touch controls respond well enough that they’re not frustrating, but the entire panel moves whenever you press an “individual” control. It’s the one area of the Cayenne’s interior that feels cheap.\n\nIt’s not surprising but still worth noting that the coupe’s rear visibility leaves something to be desired. It’s not Tesla Model Y bad, but it could be better. But that’s the price you pay for style — if you can call a coupe SUV stylish. I prefer the SUV’s lines to the coupe’s, but I will say the Cayenne coupe looks better to me than the BMW X6 or Mercedes-Benz GLE coupe.\n\nBackseat space, even in the coupe, is abundant. The sloping roofline cuts into rear-seat headroom considerably, but even then, my hair was only brushing the roofline, and I’m 6-foot-1. I’d be comfortable back there even on a long road trip (but I’d still rather be behind the wheel).\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2024 Porsche Cayenne Interior Debuts Porsche Driver Experience, Adds Passenger Display\nBest Luxury Car of 2023\nPorsche Hits the Sand With 2023 911 Dakar, Only 2,500 to Be Built\nIs the Porsche Taycan Cross Turismo Turbo S a Good EV? 6 Pros, 3 Cons\nWhich Vehicles Have the Best Warranty Coverage?\nMore to Come — and More to Come Out of Your Bank Account\n\nAs of this writing, we’re still waiting on official fuel economy estimates for the 2024 Cayenne lineup. Suffice to say, my enthusiastic driving wasn’t very fuel efficient. The previous Cayenne S with the twin-turbo V-6 was rated at 18 mpg combined, and it would be surprising if a more powerful V-8 version bested that. We’re especially looking forward to finding out how the upgrades to the E-Hybrid, including a larger battery pack and more power, affect its all-electric range, which was previously 14 miles.\n\nPricing is available, however, and the new Cayenne doesn’t come cheap. Standard equipment has improved — Porsche Active Suspension Management, safety tech like lane departure steering assist and lane change assist, a 15-watt wireless device charging pad and Comfort Access keyless entry are all newly standard — but prices are up across the board. The Cayenne S coupe I drove has a base price of $103,750 (including destination). Porsche takes pride in the configurability of its cars and its customers’ ability to build them precisely to their liking; there are literally tens of thousands of dollars’ worth of options available and, with Porsche’s paint-to-sample option, you can spend more than $10,000 on the paint alone. Optional features on my test car totaled nearly $50,000, for an as-tested price of more than $150,000.\n\nWith many people facing difficult economic times, it feels wrong to recommend something with a six-figure price, but I’m nonetheless enamored with the Cayenne S. If you have the means, I highly recommend it.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Porsche has a habit of releasing new cars one trim at a time, and the latest pieces of its model lineup are the 2021 Cayenne GTS and related Cayenne GTS Coupe. The new SUVs — “coupe” is a marketing play — are more powerful than base and S models, and they feature a sportier appearance along with lower ride height and centers of gravity for improved performance.\n\nRelated: 2020 Porsche Cayenne Coupe: 6 Things You Get for 10 Grand More\n\nSporty Engine\n\nBoth models will have a twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8 that produces 453 horsepower and 457 pounds-feet of torque, paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission. Porsche says both SUVs will sprint from 0-60 mph in 4.5 seconds or 4.2 seconds with the Performance Start feature, part of the Sport Chrono Package that’s standard on the Cayenne Coupe and optional on the Cayenne. The previous-generation Cayenne GTS, by contrast, hit 60 mph in 4.8 seconds with the package and 4.9 seconds without it. Top speed for both 2021 Cayenne GTS models is 168 mph.\n\nSporty Sound and Looks\n\nGTS models come standard with a sport exhaust system that produces “a fitting soundtrack to the enhanced dynamics.” While that system has tailpipes at the outboard sides of the rear, a center exhaust system is available as part of the optional Lightweight Sport Package. Both models also sit more than an inch lower than Cayenne S models thanks to revised adaptive shock absorbers, which helps to lower the GTS’ center of gravity and improve handling.\n\nThe Sport Design appearance package is standard on GTS models and features black exterior accents. Also standard are black 21-inch wheels and tinted LED headlights and taillights.\n\nInside, the interior makes generous use of Alcantara suede and black brushed-aluminum accents. Power eight-way front sport seats are exclusive to the GTS and feature taller side bolsters and GTS logos on the head restraints. GTS logos also appear on the tachometer, door sills and front doors.\n\nLofty Price\n\nThe 2021 Cayenne GTS will start at $108,650 while the 2021 Cayenne Coupe GTS will start at $111,850; both prices include a $1,350 destination fee. Porsche expects GTS models will arrive at dealerships in the fall.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The 2024 model year was a big one for the Porsche Cayenne, which received a thorough exterior and interior rework and saw a V-8 engine replace the V-6 that previously powered the S variants. For the 2025 model year, things have calmed down quite a bit — though in a range that encompasses two body styles and 13 trim levels with base prices spanning nearly $120,000 and outputs from 348 horsepower to more than double that, calm never means boring when it comes to the Cayenne.\n\nRelated: Our Editors Will Look at a 2024 Porsche Cayenne S and (Mostly) Just Think, ‘Hell Yeah’\n\nWhat’s New?\n\nThe GTS variant rejoins the Cayenne lineup for 2025. It pairs a bump in twin-turbo V-8 power relative to the S trim with handling bits from pricier models. Both the traditional Cayenne and swept-roof “coupe” version are available in the GTS trim.\n\nNewly standard equipment on all trims includes a 360-degree camera system with automated parking, soft-close doors and ambient lighting.\n\nTrim Levels and Powertrain Specs\n\nEvery Cayenne powertrain except the Turbo GT is available in both the SUV and coupe body styles; the Turbo GT is only available as a coupe. Despite its lower profile, the coupe is slightly heavier than the SUV, but 65 pounds or so is a drop in the bucket for a vehicle that weighs nearly 4,700 pounds in its lightest configuration. Additionally, Coupe and Turbo variants also include the Sport Chrono Package, which includes additional powertrain and chassis settings, as well as Launch Control.\n\nBase Cayennes are powered by a turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 making 348 hp and 368 pounds-feet of torque. An eight-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive are standard on every Cayenne. The base powertrain is good for 0-60 mph in 5.7 seconds.\n\nThe E-Hybrid tucks a beefy electric motor generating 174 hp and 339 pounds-feet into the Cayenne’s transmission, bumping total output to 463 hp and 479 pounds-feet; it works with a 25.9-kilowatt-hour battery pack. The hybrid gear weighs some 650 pounds, but the additional power more than makes up for it. Porsche claims the E-Hybrid will hit 60 mph in 4.6 seconds.\n\nWithout the extra electric gear, the S weighs some 450 pounds lighter than the S E-Hybrid, and its twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8 makes a comparable 468 hp and 442 pounds-feet. Porsche says it’s good for 0-60 in 4.7 seconds. In the S E-Hybrid, the electrical components remain the same, but the gas engine is retuned. It gives up a little horsepower to the non-S hybrid — with a combined 455 hp — but gains an extra mountain of torque, with 553 pounds-feet. That whittles 0.3 second from Porsche’s 0-60 claim.\n\nThe GTS is the (relative) flyweight with a (relatively) light price tag. Its twin-turbo V-8 squeezes out an extra 25 hp and 45 pounds-feet compared to the Cayenne S, for totals of 493 hp and 487 pounds-feet, respectively. It rides 0.4 inch lower than other Cayennes on a standard adaptive air suspension and features some front suspension pieces from the range-topping Turbo GT for sharper steering. Additionally, it gets the Turbo GT’s upgraded drivetrain cooling system to keep the AWD system happier during prolonged bouts of enthusiastic driving. Porsche says it will hit 60 mph in just 4.2 seconds.\n\nNow we arrive at the Turbo variants, where sanity leaves the building without so much as a polite head nod. In the Turbo E-Hybrid, the twin-turbo V-8 gets cranked up to 591 hp and 590 pounds-feet of torque. Add in the output from the same stout electric motor as the regular E-Hybrid, and the plug-in Turbo makes a staggering total of 729 hp and 700 pounds-feet. It’ll go from 0-60 in just 3.5 seconds and on to a top speed of 183 mph — though if you want to drive in EV mode, your puttering maxes out at 84 mph.\n\nOnly available as a coupe, the Turbo GT does without the hybrid components but forces 650 hp and 627 pounds-feet of torque from a heavily revised twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8. It rides lower than the rest of the line on a revised suspension with stiffer dampers and wider tires. Unique design features inside and out include a carbon-fiber roof panel, larger rear spoiler, unique wheels, and sport seats with simulated suede inserts.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2024 Porsche Cayenne S E-Hybrid Completes SUV’s Hybrid Lineup\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2024 Porsche Cayenne?\nIs the 2024 Porsche Cayenne S a Good SUV? 4 Pros and 3 Cons\n2024 Porsche Cayenne Turbo E-Hybrid Gets Big Boost to Power, Battery Size\n2024 Porsche Cayenne Interior Debuts Porsche Driver Experience, Adds Passenger Display\nAvailability and Pricing\n\nThe 2025 Porsche Cayenne is available to order now, and deliveries will begin in the fall.
