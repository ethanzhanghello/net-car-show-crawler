      "expert_review": "For the Boxster’s 20th birthday this year, Porsche gave it a revised name and a full redesign. The 2017 Porsche 718 Boxster has revised styling and interior technology, plus two new engines. The engines are turbocharged horizontally opposed four-cylinders, replacing the naturally aspirated flat-six-cylinders found in all previous Porsche Boxsters. Compare the 2017 718 Boxster with last year’s model here.\n\nThe new engines give the 718 Boxster even more performance, making an already engaging car even sharper. The Boxster competes against the Audi TT and Mercedes-Benz SLC-Class, as well as its fixed-roof stablemate, the Porsche Cayman GTS coupe. Compare the Boxster with those vehicles here.\n\nWhat We Tested\n\nThe Porsche 718 Boxster sports car starts at $57,050 (including destination charge) with a six-speed manual transmission, but it goes up quickly from there given Porsche’s preference for offering features a la carte rather than bundling them into packages. My test vehicle had too many options to list individually, but here are the major ones:\n\nSeven-speed automatic transmission\nPorsche Active Suspension Management: $1,790\nPorsche Torque Vectoring: $1,320\nSport Chrono: $2,605\nHeated seats: $530\nNavigation: $1,730\nPorsche Connect Plus smartphone connectivity: $1,300\nTwo-way powered sport seats: $800\n19-inch Boxster S wheels: $1,970\n\nAdd it all up and my test car cost $73,125. The more powerful 718 Boxster S starts at $69,450.\n\nNew Engines\n\nPorsche said that to hit its power and performance goals for this new Boxster without a turbocharged engine, it would have had to significantly increase the displacement of the existing engines. The twin-turbocharged flat-six used in the 911 Carrera wouldn’t fit, either, so the choice was made to downsize and add forced induction.\n\nJust because the new engines are smaller, however, doesn’t mean they’re any less potent. In fact, they’re more powerful: The 718 Boxster features a 300-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter flat 4-cylinder engine that makes 280 pounds-feet of torque, an improvement of 35 hp and 74 pounds-feet of torque compared with last year’s Boxster. The Porsche 718 Boxster S models comes with a 350-hp, 2.5-liter flat turbo four-cylinder that makes 309 pounds-feet of torque. Both cars have rear-wheel drive and the same transmission options: a standard six-speed manual or optional seven-speed dual-clutch PDK automatic.\n\nThe power gains for the Porsche 718 Boxster, combined with the fact that the new engine is more responsive and offers more low-end torque, means the new base Boxster sports car is just as quick from zero-to-60 mph (4.5 seconds) as last year’s Boxster S when both are equipped with PDK, Porsche says. The new 718 Boxster S makes the same sprint in 4.0 seconds.\n\nThe move down to smaller engines hasn’t benefitted fuel economy as much as performance. The new 718 version of the Porsche Boxster gets an EPA-estimated 21/28/24 mpg city/highway/combined with the manual transmission, 22/29/25 mpg with PDK. The 718 Boxster S checks in at 20/26/22 mpg with the manual, 21/28/24 mpg with PDK. For the 718 Boxster, these figures match the combined ratings for last year’s model exactly (not for the 718 Boxster S). Premium fuel is required.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThe new engines add power, which is appreciated, but what distinguishes the new 718 version of the Porsche Boxster is still its handling. The car’s construction gives it a leg up when it comes to balance; having the engine mounted in the middle of the car puts a lot of weight in the center of the vehicle, which keeps it composed through corners. Add the two chassis systems on my test car (active suspension management and torque vectoring), and the Porsche 718 Boxster is an impeccable canyon-carver.\n\nThe torque-vectoring system works in concert with the rear axle’s mechanical differential lock to brake the inside rear wheel when cornering at high speed andshift more power to the outside wheel. This improves the precision of turn-in, as the outside wheel essentially helps steer the car into the turn. It has real impact; the 718 Boxster dives into corners headlong, with great enthusiasm. Combined with an updated steering system (standard on all 718 Boxsters) that has a quicker ratio (it was lifted from the 911 Turbo), it makes the whole car feel responsive and agile.\n\nThe adaptive shock absorbers also work magic, dropping ride height 0.39 inch (0.78 inch in the Boxster S) and providing two suspension settings, Normal and Sport. In Normal mode, the suspension is more pliant and rides well over road imperfections. It’s stiffer than your average car but definitely livable for everyday driving. Flip it into Sport mode, however, and the shocks stiffen up noticeably as the 718 Boxster stays even more neutral on turn-in. Even in moments when you feel like the car should start to step out or be out of balance, it stays preternaturally flat. Sport isn’t the mode I’d choose for a commute or a highway, but if you’re on a twisty road and looking for some fun, it’s perfect.\n\nDrawbacks\n\nAs good as the Porsche 718 Boxster is in the performance aspect, it is not without what we’ll call compromises, to be gentle. (If we’re not being gentle, they’re drawbacks.)\n\nCargo room is small. There are two trunks, a 5.3-cubic-foot trunk up front and a smaller 4.4-cubic-foot area in the rear (remember, the engine is in the middle, behind the seats). That amounts to 9.7 cubic feet total. Not a bad number for a car this size, but being divided brings limitations. For example, the rear cargo area won’t fit a roll-aboard suitcase; it’ll have to go in the front trunk — and yes, only the one will fit.\n\nThere’s also the problem of visibility. With the powered top down, it’s easy to see in all directions — but when the roof is up, the opposite is true. The canvas forms large blind spots to both sides, and the rear window is small. Make sure your mirrors are set up perfectly, since you’ll have to depend on them a fair amount.\n\nMy final gripe has to do with the list of standard equipment. There are many options available, but they’re expensive. There are a few things I think should be included standard in a car that costs this much, including automatic climate control and automatic emergency braking.\n\nConclusion\n\nThese caveats don’t change the fact that the Porsche 718 Boxster achieves its goal: It’s an unabashed sports roadster that puts a premium on drivability, balance and agility — and it doesn’t just complete that mission, it excels at it. Of course, a two-seat drop-top convertible that doesn’t fit much cargo is not for everyone; kids or a spouse could easily sway the calculus a bit on a car like this. And the price tag is steep for something that offers so little practicality and not-great fuel economy.\n\nBut if your mission is as singular as the Porsche 718 Boxster’s and your objective is to find the car that’s the most fun to drive, I promise you won’t be disappointed.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "It was only a matter of time before the recently redesigned Porsche 718 Boxster convertible and 718 Cayman coupe offered even more performance. We didn’t have to wait very long; just a year it turns out. New for model-year 2018, the 718 Boxster and Cayman GTS are now the most powerful cars in the 718 lineup.\n\nRelated: Is a Porsche 911 Worth the Upgrade From a Boxster or Cayman?\n\nI tested both the base and S versions of the 718 last year and somewhat surprisingly, I preferred the Porsche 718 Cayman S to the 911 Carrera. Its supreme balance and responsive powertrain won me over against the classic styling and rear-engine layout in the 911. To say I was excited to get behind the wheel of the GTS would be putting it mildly.\n\nI headed to Napa Valley in Northern California to sample the new vintages of the 718 sports car. Per company policy, Cars.com pays for its own lodging and transportation to such automaker events.\n\nWhat Does the 718 GTS Get You?\n\nThe GTS badge comes with some cosmetic updates that set it apart from other versions of the 718, including a unique front apron, dark tinted headlights and taillights, 20-inch Carrera S wheels in black and black tailpipes. Inside, “GTS” is stitched into the head restraints, the gauges are finished in black, and the steering wheel, shift knob and parts of the door panel/center console bin are all covered in Alcantara.\n\nThat’s all potatoes. What enthusiasts will care about are the changes underneath the skin. The Porsche Active Suspension Management comes standard; it lowers the GTS by 0.39 inch over the standard 718 suspension. Want to go even lower? PASM Sport is optional ($290) and lowers the car another 0.39 inch to a 0.78-inch total and offers even more stiffness for greater response. Porsche Torque Vectoring also comes standard — it uses dynamic braking at the rear wheels and a rear differential lock to increase the car’s lateral dynamics and stability, as well as offer a sharper turn-in.\n\nThe engine’s upgrades including new intake manifolds for improved airflow and changes to the turbocharger, such as a larger compressor wheel diameter. The turbocharger also has variable turbine geometry (shared with S versions) that allows the guide blades that feed exhaust gases into the turbine of the turbocharger to open and close, depending on conditions. The larger compressor wheel allows the GTS to produce 18.1 pounds of boost pressure versus 16.7 pounds for S models.\n\nThis bumps engine output to 365 horsepower and 317 pounds-feet of torque, improvements of 15 hp and 8 pounds-feet of torque over S models. Transmission options are the same: a six-speed stick or a seven-speed PDK system, Porsche’s dual-clutch automatic transmission. The new GTS gets the Sport Chrono Package standard, another feature that’s an option on the S – this adds a Sport plus driving mode and launch control on PDK models.\n\nThe GTS doesn’t translate to vastly different acceleration and top speed figures. The GTS has a slightly higher top-speed than S models, 180 versus 177 mph. But with the manual transmission, the GTS actually matches the zero-to-60-mph time of the S models (4.4 seconds). PDK models see the slightest of improvements; they are 0.1 second faster than a comparable S model (with Sport Chrono Package optioned) at 3.9 seconds from zero-to-60 mph.\n\nTell Your Significant Other It’s a Value Buy\n\nBelieve it or not, Porsche says the GTS does have some value if you stack it up against S models: If you were to outfit a Boxster S or Cayman S with all of the available styling options that made it look like a GTS and added PASM, PTV and Sport Chrono, than the S models would cost roughly 6 to 8 percent more than the GTS’ starting price – and that’s without the engine power gains and improvements.\n\nThe GTS models start at $23,800 more than the respective base models for each car. That prices the 2018 Porsche 718 Cayman GTS at $80,850 (including destination charges) and the 2018 718 Boxster GTS at $82,950 (both models come standard with the six-speed manual).\n\nIf you wanted to add only the performance parts? Taking a Cayman S and adding PASM, PTV and Sport Chrono pushes the price to $75,550, which is within about $5,000 of the GTS. That car comes with smaller wheels, however, and without that perfectly sized GT sport steering wheel.\n\nCan You Feel the Difference?\n\nSlap all the cosmetics you want on it. To justify the GTS’ price increase, there needs to be a commensurate gain in performance.\n\nThe 718 Cayman S I last reviewed came with the PASM sport suspension, PTV and Sport Chrono, making it closely equipped to a GTS from a suspension perspective, and the two cars ended up handling close to the same. That’s a good thing; both vehicles are superbly balanced, and things that would normally unsettle the car (such as heavy braking) are swallowed up instantly. The 718 Cayman GTS is a car you can brake very late into a corner and it will almost immediately return to neutral balance to get through the corner swiftly.\n\nThis is especially true with the optional carbon ceramic brake package, a $7,410 mark-up over the standard brakes and easily identifiable by yellow brake calipers. The carbon ceramics offer some weight savings (15 pounds worth) and greater stopping power, but the price tag is tough to swallow. The standard brakes are identical to those found on the Boxster/Cayman S and will be plenty for those who will be driving the car on the street. Opting for the carbon ceramics is more justifiable if you plan to track or autocross the vehicle.\n\nWith the PASM Sport suspension box checked (which I definitely would), there is a stark difference between Normal and Sport suspension modes, so much so that I’d be swapping through the two constantly. Normal is much more pliant and suitable for day-to-day driving, albeit with a stiffer suspension than most other vehicles – this is still a sports car after all. But Sport really firms things up for an aggressive setup that gives the Porsche 718 Cayman GTS its trademark handling edge.\n\nThere’s more distinction with the engine changes than in the suspension. Though the published figures don’t offer much separation, I thought the GTS engine felt more responsive and quicker to get into the power than the Cayman S. It’s impressive how much response Porsche has built into the GTS throttle and engine; the gas pedal is nearly as telepathic as the steering is.\n\nAnother benefit of the new intake manifolds and larger turbocharger is more engine noise. Thankfully, it’s a pleasant noise because the sound is with you at all times. The cabin is noticeably louder, whether you have sport exhaust activated or not. I like that it gives the GTS more of an edge, and it’s even better in the Boxster GTS where you can drop the top to really hear it sing.\n\n2018 Porsche 718 Cayman GTS | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\n718 Boxster GTS or 718 Cayman GTS?\n\nThe 718 Boxster/Cayman GTS isn’t a sea change. The GTS doesn’t broach any new ground but rather serves to enhance the strengths of the 718 Boxster and Cayman, giving them a bit more edge. Shoppers considering adding suspension and powertrain upgrades to an S model might find that jumping up to the GTS, which includes many of those same options as standard, makes a lot of sense.\n\nThe Cayman GTS I tested stickered at $92,580 thanks in large part to those ceramic brakes. And the Boxster GTS was even more, adding mostly cosmetic touches (that Chalk paint job by itself was $2,580) and a GTS Interior Package ($3,690) for a final price of $95,700.\n\nI’ll take the Cayman GTS of the two I tested – I’d rather spend more on the sharper driving car, not the sharper looking one.\n\nI said before I preferred the 718 Cayman S to the 911 Carrera, and the same holds true for the GTS, even if you factor in the 911 Carrera T that I also tested on this trip. There’s something about mid-engine cars that speaks to me on a visceral level, and though I concede that the 911 will always be the more quintessential Porsche, I’m a bit new school in my approach. In fact, I find that the GTS offers the most bang for your performance buck and I’d take it over most 911 varieties, up to the GT3 (at that point give me the GT3 because it’s insane).\n\nThose who want a 911 are not making a wrong choice — it’s still a great driver’s car and some want the cachet, the tradition and the chance to say, “I drive a 911.” But not me dear reader, no, no, no. You and I, we don’t get caught up on such pretenses.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Even in the twilight years of its production, the Porsche 718 Boxster GTS 4.0 remains one of the purest and most satisfying driving experiences available at any price.\n\nVersus the competition: It’s getting lonely in the $100,000-ish sports car class. A well-equipped Chevrolet Corvette is likely the Porsche’s closest competitor, and that choice comes down to experiential preferences.\n\nThis is one of the most unpleasant writeups I’ve ever put to keyboard.\n\nThe car? Brilliant. As close to faultless as a modern mid-engine sports car can be, and therein lies the anguish: Porsche has officially confirmed that the 718 family — and therefore the current 718 Boxster and Cayman  — will be discontinued in 2025 to make way for the next generation of the car that’s confirmed to be all-electric, all the way.\n\nThere will be no more gas-powered 718 Boxsters or Caymans going forward. No conventional transmissions, no turbos, no natural aspiration. Just electrons and a miles-deep well of instant torque that Porsche hopes will wash memories of free-breathin’ six-cylinder screamers from your memory.\n\nRelated: Purists’ Porsche: 911 Carrera T Returns for 2025\n\n2024 Porsche 718 Boxster GTS 4.0 | Cars.com photo by Brandon Lim\n\nI’m not here to bash that decision, but rather to lament and reflect. My recent spin in this white 2024 Porsche 718 Boxster GTS 4.0 is one of many adventures I’ve had over the years both in this generation of the car and the previous one, including extended seat time in the GT4 and Spyder variants. For us Porsche freaks (could you guess?), the upper-end of the 718 family line represents some of the greatest driving experiences to be had at or just above the $100,000 mark. Some served as whopping alternatives to the increasingly heavy, complex and expensive 911.\n\nAn Old Friend\n\nThis was my third time in a GTS 4.0, but the thrill never tarnishes. Most of the time a 718 loaner is a toy, a bit of candy between meals — er, commuting — but not this time. This time I found myself fortunate enough to have the time and budget to attend Monterey Car Week, so I requisitioned something low, fast and hot, planning to point it directly and unerringly north from Los Angeles, slithering the long way up the Pacific Coast Highway.\n\nMuch of the first two hours of this drive cuts between the traffic-clogged U.S. Highway 101 and extended inland stretches, but the 90-mile coastal California cruise between Cambria and Monterey couldn’t be more jaw-droppingly gorgeous if you had six Oscar-winning cinematographers on the job. It’s truly one of the world’s greatest drives, with any appetite for beauty quickly overstimulated by an endless scrawl of postcard vistas. The late, great David E. Davis put it best: “The rolling deep-cut countryside is so beautiful that the ocean views become sort of anticlimactic, a bit like having ice cream on your ice cream.”\n\n2024 Porsche 718 Boxster GTS 4.0 | Cars.com photo by Brandon Lim\n\nImagine my excitement and anticipation facing this in the sublime Boxster. Then imagine the cold, 300-pound iron ingot in my stomach when I learned the PCH through Big Sur — the best bit — was closed for the season, and no, there’s no way around it from the coastal side. Instead, I’d have to drive one of the least picturesque commutes in California: up Interstate 5 through the central valley. That’s five or so hours of dusty plains, almond orchards and simmering summer heat.\n\nBackroads Break \n\nBut first, a day in the familiar Malibu canyons. That network of roads punishes the powerful and portly; bigger, wider cars like Corvettes and Aston Martins feel every bit their size and 6 million horsepower when maneuvering cliff hairpins. The Boxster, on the other hand, sings and flows, with even the most casual of weekend cruisers able to drink every drop of its 394 hp.\n\nThe Boxster has more balance and chassis than power despite performance figures good enough to land it supercar status 15 years ago. The naturally aspirated 4.0-liter flat-six engine is one of the best watercooled sixers Porsche has ever made, a bored-out, de-turbo’d derivation of the twin-turbo 3.0-liter six-cylinder from the 911. It’s a ripsaw of an engine, with almost more intake snort and valvetrain gnash than exhaust, but it still howls with a 7,800-rpm titanium zing that’s an echo of yesteryear’s 911s.\n\n2024 Porsche 718 Boxster GTS 4.0 | Cars.com photo by Brandon Lim\n\nA sound-off between this and a current- or prior-generation 911 Carrera would be a stark comparison. The smaller turbocharged mill in the 911 has the rasp, but it’s muffled under the turbo’s mattress; on full blast, the 4.0 crescendos with a sharpness usually reserved for weapons from Porsche’s GT division.\n\nPerfect Performance \n\nThat makes a bit of sense considering you’ll find the same 4.0-liter engine in the now-discontinued 718 Cayman GT4 and Boxster Spyder, albeit with 20 hp extra from minor tuning differences. This is not the same heart as the GT4 RS/Boxster Spyder RS, which is ostensibly sourced from the contemporary 911 GT3, but you’ll never feel like you’re missing out on a single rev or a lone pony.\n\nPorsche reports 3.8 seconds for the 0-60 mph sprint when equipped with its whip-quick PDK seven-speed dual-clutch transmission, with the fan-favorite six-speed manual clocking in a few ticks behind that. In keeping with history, that’s a conservative figure; you can expect a few fractional seconds to fall off in a real-world scoot. There’s enough low-end grunt to enter any highway at excessively supra-legal speeds, but the delivery is linear enough to never catch you unawares if you become a bit too brave mid-corner.\n\nMechanical grip and sensational input is the name of the game here. As is the case with the basest of base Boxsters to the gnarliest GT2 RS, a modern Porsche sports car remains as predictable as a bag of Lay’s Classic — and strangely familiar in a way you thought only your weatherworn La-Z-Boy could be. Steering inputs impart immensely satisfying granularity and weighted balance even if the days of a purely hydraulic steering rack are long behind us. Braking feel is just so, with better-balanced pedal actuation and effort than you’ll find in anything short of a supercar.\n\nGiddy? Of Course \n\nIt can be frustrating to review hotter Porsche stuff; as you’ll notice, one can come off babbly and gushing, even the third — or is this the fourth? — time around. It’s far from the best or most exciting car I’ve driven, but the GTS 4.0 is simply one of the most comprehensively well-packaged and balanced setups available at any price, riding the micron-thin line between fatiguing excitement and daily banality.\n\nThat’s its party trick. Left in Comfort mode with the active exhaust wedged closed, its happy poodling around town or cruising at highway speeds, inducing no more stress than an automatic-transmission Subaru BRZ — at least for a while. It took close to five of the six-and-a-half hours of the first leg of my road trip for me to fray under the GTS’ stiffened suspension and modestly louder cabin. This was exacerbated by the Boxster’s retracted soft top eating up the beautifully usable rear storage area you’ll find in the Cayman, which opens up the cabin a bit.\n\n2024 Porsche 718 Boxster GTS 4.0 | Cars.com photo by Brandon Lim\n\nA little joint and back stiffness meant I was happy to park this car up for the night, but the next morning came fast. For the rest of Monterey Car Week, the Boxster was treated with the same spiritual reverence as a rental car — I had many places to be and many traffic jams to endure. Save some blissful rips through Pebble Beach’s devastatingly gorgeous 17-Mile Drive, occasional full-throttle pulls through traffic breaks and one short venture down the PCH, it was just transportation.\n\nBut what transportation it was — size and cargo limitations aside. That said, the Boxster’s frunk and trunk swallowed a hard-shell carry-on bag, full-size duffel, large backpack, shoebox and small pile of clothes; nothing got stuffed in the passenger seat. For two smart-packing folks, there’s enough stowage for an extended weekend in the country.\n\nMore From Cars.com: \n\n2025 Porsche 911 Gives One of Its Hottest Trims a Hybrid System\nPorsche Fills Out Performance 2025 911 Lineup With GT3 and GT3 Touring Package\nThree New 2025 Porsche Taycan Trims Include Return of Sport Turismo Wagon\n2025 Porsche Cayenne: More Standard Equipment, Starts at $86,695\nShop for a 2024 Porsche 718 Boxster\nStealthy Sublimity \n\nIn direct contrast with this Boxster’s remarkable driving character, it’s impressive how unremarkable it can become in the right context. GTS 4.0 badging aside, there’s nothing particularly eye-catching about a white-over-red-over-black Boxster, especially when flanked by literally hundreds of examples of assorted automotive exotica. More than once, I found myself in a caravan of Ferraris and Lamborghinis only to see their garnered attention atomized by a passing line of Bugattis and Koenigseggs. Yeah, no one looked twice at the Boxster.\n\n2024 Porsche 718 Boxster GTS 4.0 | Cars.com photo by Brandon Lim\n\nThat has to be part of the package, right? This Porsche can deliver one of the best drives of your life, then manage your commute home without (much) stress, and no one outside of friendly Porsche dorks will bother you for photos or questions. Even back on the mean Mercedes-clogged streets of Los Angeles, the only attention I got was from my neighbor and garage mate, who asked if I got a new car.\n\nThe Boxster 718 GTS 4.0 is, without pretense, one of automotive history’s sweet spots. If you have the financial fitness to swallow its $103,795 starting price tag (or $101,695 for the Cayman GTS 4.0; both prices include destination), I implore you to get one before it’s too late. And if you don’t have the cash, maybe see if you can finagle something anyway. It would surely be one of the most gratifying ways to go into crippling debt.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Shopping for a new Porsche 718 Boxster or 718 Cayman and find the manual-transmission-only trim levels appealing? Well, we’ve got some good news and some bad news: The good news is that all 2021 718 models gain some additional standard features that, frankly, should be standard in a $60,000-plus car from a luxury brand. The bad news (for purists) is that Porsche is making its seven-speed PDK dual-clutch automatic transmission available across the lineup, ending the row-your-own exclusivity of the GTS 4.0 trim levels as well as the Boxster Spyder and Cayman GT4.\n\nRelated: Porsche 718 GTS 4.0: You Make Me Feel Like a Natural Sports Car\n\nMore Standard Goodies\n\nAll 718 models now include dual-zone automatic climate control, heated front seats and rain-sensing, auto-dimming mirrors. Porsche is also adding Apple CarPlay as standard equipment across all 718 models, as well as making bi-xenon headlights the standard method of illuminating the road ahead.\n\nAdded standard features don’t come without an added cost — this is still Porsche, after all — as base models of the 718 Cayman increase in price by $2,400. A 2021 718 Cayman will now cost $61,250, and the Boxster will be priced from $63,350 (all prices include $1,350 destination fee).\n\nAutomatic for the (Wealthy) People\n2021 Porsche 718 Boxster and Cayman interior | Manufacturer image\n\nUntil now, the highest levels of performance in the 718 lineup came exclusively with a six-speed manual transmission. GTS 4.0 trim levels of the Boxster and Cayman as well as the Boxster Spyder and Cayman GT4 paired that six-speed with a naturally aspirated 4.0-liter six-cylinder engine that produced 394 horsepower in GTS guise and 414 hp for the Spyder and GT4.\n\nFor 2021, however, Porsche is letting customers order those models with its seven-speed PDK system. Not only does that allow more customers to buy the more expensive performance models, it also makes the cars quicker, according to Porsche. Just how much quicker isn’t clear yet, but expect somewhere between two-tenths and half a second to get knocked off GTS models’ 4.3-second 0-60 times and the Spyder and GT4’s 4.2-second sprint.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2021 Porsche Cayenne GTS, Cayenne GTS Coupe Revealed\n2021 Porsche 911 Targa Travels Back in Time With 4S Heritage Edition\nStalk Car? Porsche 911 Buyers Can Track Their Dream Car’s Every Move\nPorsche 911 Targa 4 and 4S Keep Retro Looks for New Generation\nWhat’s the Right Way to Say Porsche?\nHigh-Performance Pricing\n\nPricing for the automatic-equipped GTS 4.0 models hasn’t been disclosed yet (or for the Spyder or GT4), but with the manual transmission, 2021 718 Cayman GTS 4.0 models will be priced from $88,150 while Boxster GTS 4.0 models will carry a starting price of $90,250. Ordering is open now, and Porsche expects automatic-equipped six-cylinder models to arrive at dealerships early in 2021.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
