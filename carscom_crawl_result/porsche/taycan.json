      "expert_review": "We’ve just started getting to know the Porsche Taycan — the automaker’s first-ever all-electric vehicle — and it’s already getting an update. The Taycan debuted for 2020 and is receiving some new features for 2021.\n\nRelated: 2020 Porsche Taycan 4S Makes Your Money — and You — Go a Little Further\n\n1. Head-Up Display\n\nA new color head up display is now available on the electric sedan. It can project content, such as calls or voice control commands, directly in front of the driver. It’s  also configurable and can be set to project navigation details, the power meter and other info.\n\n2. Programmable Suspension\n\nThe new Smartlift function allows drivers to program their Taycan’s suspension to automatically raise in certain locations, like speed bumps or driveways. Note that this feature is only included on models with the adaptive air suspension, however.\n\n3. Over-the-Air Add-Ons\n\nPorsche is also adding some features to its Function on Demand option, which allows drivers to add convenience and assistance systems after purchasing their Taycan thanks to over-the-air software updates. New additions include Active Lane Keep Assist and Porsche InnoDrive, which adapts the speed of the car to the conditions ahead, taking into account speed limits, turns, traffic circles and other traffic situations.\n\n4. Smarter Charging\n\nA new battery preservation feature can regulate the charging capacity (at DC fast-charging stations, for instance) to around 200 kilowatts. Drivers can enable this setting on the Taycan’s central display, and Porsche says the feature can extend the battery’s service life and reduce overall power loss while charging. A charging capacity of up to 270 kW remains available at 800-volt high-power charging stations for drivers who don’t enable the system.\n\n5. Infotainment Options\n\nUpdates to the multimedia system include the availability of SiriusXM 360L, the ability to select Apple podcasts as an individual media source, more flexibility in ordering and displaying media preferences, as well as the option to highlight compatible charging locations.\n\nAnd More …\n\nOther new highlights include a more secure way to pay for vehicle charging at Electrify America charging points, along with seven new exterior colors: Mahogany Metallic, Frozenberry Metallic, Cherry Metallic, Coffee Beige Metallic, Chalk, Neptune Blue and Ice Grey Metallic. Inside, four new interior options are now available: black/Limestone Beige (standard), Blackberry and Blackberry/Slate Grey leather, Graphite Blue/Slate Grey Race-Tex and Basalt Black/Meranti Brown OLEA Club Leather.\n\nThe 2021 Porsche Taycan goes on sale in early 2021.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Porsche Taycan?\n\nThe Porsche Taycan sedan and Taycan Cross Turismo hatchback blend the German brand’s knack for expert engineering with full electrification. No matter which body style you choose, the Taycan is speedy. It corners with absolute precision and delivers an unflappable ride. The base Taycan sedan is rear-wheel drive, but all other Taycans have all-wheel drive. The range-topping Turbo and Turbo S come with super-performance powertrains, making 670 and 750 horsepower, respectively, when their launch-control modes are activated. (Both have 616 hp in regular mode.) The main drawback to the Taycan is its limited driving range compared with rivals like the Lucid Air, Mercedes-EQ EQS and Tesla Model S.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Porsche Taycan?\n\nPorsche has introduced a round of software updates aimed at improving the driving range and recharging time of both the Taycan and Taycan Cross Turismo. The improvements are small, but they can also be applied to already-sold Taycans.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Porsche Taycan?\n\nThe Porsche Taycan sedan and Taycan Cross Turismo hatchback blend the German automaker’s knack for expert engineering with full electrification. Whichever body style you choose, the Taycan is speedy. It corners with absolute precision, and it delivers an unflappable ride. The base Taycan sedan is rear-wheel drive, but all other Taycans have all-wheel drive. The range-topping Turbo and Turbo S come with super-performance powertrains, making 670 and 750 horsepower, respectively, when their launch-control modes are activated (both have 616 hp in regular mode). The main drawback to the Taycan is its limited driving range compared with rivals like the Lucid Air, Mercedes-Benz EQS and Tesla Model S. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Porsche Taycan?\n\nThe Taycan and Taycan Cross Turismo see no significant changes for 2024.\n\nHow Much Range Does the 2024 Porsche Taycan Have?\n\nThe Taycan’s and Taycan Cross Turismo’s EPA-estimated driving ranges run from 206 to 246 miles, depending on battery pack and trim.\n\nHow Long Does it Take to Charge the 2024 Porsche Taycan?\n\nThe Taycan’s and Taycan Cross Turismo’s charging times range from an estimated 10 hours and 30 minutes on a standard 240-volt Level 2 charger (to go from a 5% charge to 80%) to an estimated 23 minutes on a 350-kilowatt DC fast charger (to go from a 5% charge to 80%).\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Porsche Taycan Are Most Important? \n\nStandard features include:\n\n10.9-inch touchscreen\n16.8-inch digital gauge display\nPower-adjustable front seats\nHeated front seats\nWireless device charging\n10-speaker audio system\nNavigation\nSatellite radio\nLane departure steering assist\nFront and rear parking sensors\nRain-sensing wipers\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nSurround-view parking camera system\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nMassaging front seats\nPanoramic moonroof\nHead-up instrument display\nAdaptive cruise control\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\n21-speaker Burmester audio system\nRear-seat entertainment system\nCarbon-coated brakes\nAdaptive air suspension\nNight-vision assist\nTorque vectoring steering\nShould I Buy the 2024 Porsche Taycan?\n\nFrom its sleek, wind-cheating shape to its mind-boggling acceleration and cutting-edge cabin, the Taycan and Taycan Cross Turismo prove Porsche can work its magic on fully electrified vehicles. Problems arise, however, when comparing the driving range of the Taycan with direct rivals from Tesla and Lucid. And while upper trims like the Turbo S are amazingly quick and snake around curves, they also have starting prices perilously close to $200,000.",

      "expert_review": "We’re cutting right to the chase with the 2025 Porsche Taycan: Our stationary seat time in Porsche’s refreshed performance electric sedan at the 2024 New York International Auto Show didn’t reveal all that much about the new-ish car. The overwhelming majority of the changes are found under the skin, not on it, so you’re gonna have to wait until we get some real seat time out on the road.\n\nRelated: More 2024 New York Auto Show Coverage\n\nBut, this means it’s good news for folks who liked the prior Taycan but were holding out for some much-needed hardware improvements. There’s plenty of that, starting with juicer battery tech and revised motors across the range, but you can check out our full breakdown from the car’s debut earlier this year.\n\nA Little Retouched\n\nOur first in-person taste arrives with a top-shelf 2025 Taycan Turbo S in a demure hue of Shade Green Metallic, continuing Porsche’s full exploration of the color spectrum. At first look, it seems like everything is where we left it, though our eyes are quickly drawn to the revised front end. The retouched areas of the lower bumper stylistically work well, lending slight angularity and a distinct techno-cool vibe that’s right in line with the modern electric-vehicle design language.\n\nThere’s new 20- and 21-inch wheel designs, and we dig the darkened 21-inchers on the display car. This was our first chance to check out the brand’s new Turbonite trim, and the smoked, metallic Porsche crests perfectly complemented the dull green paint. It works in the “now,” but we can totally see this dark motif appearing rather “2020s” in the coming decades.\n\nSubtle Changes Inside\n\nInterior wise, the show car wore none of the new upholstery options like the leather-free Race-Tex kit, so it’s mostly as we left it in the prior model. We also didn’t get a chance to pair our phones to check out the MyPorsche app in Apple CarPlay, but both Porsche’s infotainment interface and the general interior design weren’t really in dire need of an upgrade, so we’re fine with the subtle changes.\n\nFrustrated we don’t have more insights on the 2025 Porsche Taycan? Hey, we’re working with what we’re given, and in the case of the refresh, it’s all happening behind the scenes. Check back later this year after we’ve gotten some quality ­moving seat time for our full thoughts.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2025 Porsche Taycan Turbo GT: Up to 1,000-Plus HP for $231,995\nWhich EVs Have All-Wheel Drive?\nWhich New Electric Vehicles Come With Free Charging?\nIs the Porsche Taycan Cross Turismo Turbo S a Good EV? 6 Pros, 3 Cons\n2020 Porsche Taycan 4S Makes Your Money — and You — Go a Little Further\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "With brands from Kia to Rolls-Royce realizing the marketing potential of the word “black,” Porsche is plundering its own famously extensive options catalog to create a series of Black Editions. Available on the all-electric Taycan, Taycan 4 and Taycan 4S sedans, the Black Edition combines numerous style and functionality upgrades at a substantial discount.\n\nRelated: Three New 2025 Porsche Taycan Trims Include Return of Sport Turismo Wagon\n\nWhat Do the Taycan Black Editions Include?\n\nOn the exterior, the Taycan Black Editions derive their name from the SportDesign lower bumper and sill panels, window trim, badging, mirror caps and the “Porsche” script in the rear light strip, all of which are finished in black. Inside, a “Black Edition” badge on the center console assures occupants all of this black is not a coincidence. That’s particularly important if buyers don’t choose black paint or interior upholstery; the entire exterior palette and most interior choices are available.\n\nThe Black Editions also boast a hearty load of equipment from the Taycan’s regular options catalog. The most significant of these is the Performance Battery Plus, which increases the pack’s storage capacity from 89 kilowatt-hours to 105. Porsche’s upgraded LED headlights, puddle lamps and 21-inch wheels are also included.\n\nInside, the Black Edition is outfitted with 14-way power front seats with memory, Porsche crests on the head restraints, black embossed-leather trim, black brushed illuminated sill plates and a 14-speaker Bose sound system with Porsche Electric Sport Sound, which generates futuristic zooming noises in the cabin while you drive. There’s also more standard tech than on the regular Taycan, too, including a 360-degree camera system, automated parking and lane change assist.\n\nAs Porsche’s options portfolio is specifically geared towards buyers whose response is always “more,” there’s also an extended Black Edition variant. For $1,570, it includes “Black Edition” script on the front doors and sill plates, with the name repeated in silver on the key fob.\n\nRelease Date and Pricing\n\nThe 2026 Porsche Taycan Black Edition is available to order now, with deliveries set to begin in the fall. Full pricing (including the $2,350 destination charge) is as follows. The Black Edition represents a meaningful savings; a base Taycan similarly equipped would run about $130,000.\n\nTaycan Black Edition: $122,950\nTaycan 4 Black Edition: $126,950\nTaycan 4S Black Edition: $140,850\n\nRelated Video:\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2025 Porsche Taycan Turbo S Up Close: We Go Skin-Deep\nPorsche Charging Service Adds Locations, In-App Payments for ChargePoint Stations\n2025 Porsche Taycan Turbo GT: Up to 1,000-Plus HP for $231,995\nResearch the Porsche Taycan\nFind Your Next Car\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
