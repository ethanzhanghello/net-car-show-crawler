      "expert_review": "The first thing you should learn about the all new 2010 Porsche sedan is its name. Panamera. It is not panoramic. And it is not Pan-American. One is a camera setting and the other a highway from the top of North America to the bottom of South America.\n\nThat particular highway, which is really a series of roads that stretch for nearly 30,000 miles, would be a perfect place to try out this new sedan. It’s an absolute thrill machine that allows you to share the fun with three other people — something Porsche has not been able to do before with its cars.\n\nNow, all of this speed and luxury does come with a hefty price tag. My turbocharged test vehicle topped $150,000, though the “base” model starts at around $90,000. That’s a lot of schnitzel, even for these Autobahn racers by the legendary German brand.\n\nBut people who buy this car don’t worry that much about the price. And this remains a groundbreaking vehicle for Porsche, showing the world even an old German can learn a new trick.\n\nThere are also things we can learn from these kinds of cars, such as what supreme fit and finish looks like, what performance features could eventually make their way into everyday vehicles, and how cool a sedan can become.\n\nSee, for the most part, the automotive world believes in a trickle-down philosophy of technology. It’s very similar to trickle-down economics but doesn’t require bipartisan support. It works like this: Create new things, put them in really expensive cars, and eventually everyday people slogging through traffic will get them in their cars. In other words, the Panamera is a glimpse at the future.\n\nSo let’s pull back that curtain and take a peek, shall we?\n\nFirst, this car is pure Porsche. Yes, it is a sedan — purposely embracing all four doors and providing adequate space in the second row to allow passengers with actual legs enough room to sit (there are 33.3 inches of legroom back there). The traditional 2+2 models were designed for two people and two briefcases.\n\nWhile the back seats are comfortable, if not downright luxurious, the place every person wants to sit is behind the steering wheel. Every part of this car feels like a Porsche when you’re sitting there — and it’s impossible to not be comfortable in the 14-way adjustable seat. (An 18-way adjustable seat is optional.)\n\nInstead of a traditional center stack with knobs and buttons on the dash, Porsche puts a color display screen in the center of the dash and most of the controls stretch down in two rows along the center console that goes all the way through to the second row.\n\nIt feels like you’re piloting a space ship, clicking through the different buttons. A very swanky leather-encased space ship, for sure.\n\nThere is a smaller set of switches on the ceiling that controls the moon roof and parking assist controls. And you will want to turn off the parking assist beeper because it provides 360 degrees of annoyance. (Just pull up to a Dunkin’ Donuts and you’ll see how the parking assist just beeps and beeps and beeps when you haven’t even had your coffee yet.)\n\nAt night, the controls glow ominously along with the adjustable ambient lighting throughout the cabin in the foot wells and storage spots.\n\nThere are also rear seat reading lights as part of the ambient lighting package.\n\nOne of the gauges in the five-gauge cluster instrument panel is actually a 4.8-inch high-resolution display that can bring up lots of information as well as show the navigation screen.\n\nThis means that the passenger can still monkey around with the bigger display screen on the dash while the driver will never lose his way. It’s genius.\n\nRocket power\n\nThe long list of safety and other features on this car is truly impressive. The only thing it felt like it needed was a blind spot detection system, but it’s easy enough to keep people out of your blind spot by just always passing them.\n\nThere’s also plenty of room in the back to store stuff, and Porsche offers a roof rack for things like skis and snowboards. The automatic lifting tailgate operates from the key, which has the same shape as the car.\n\nLike a true sports car, the tachometer is the dominate gauge, and you have to be careful watching your speed because the numbers count off in 25 mph increments. That means on the highway, you should be able to see the number 75 right above the needle, not below it.\n\nOf course, staying below the 75 marking on the speedometer can be difficult, especially with the twin turbocharged 4.8-liter V-8 under the hood. This car launches like a space shuttle. For a sedan, it can go from 0 to 60 mph in four seconds flat. Keep your foot mashed against the accelerator, and in five more seconds you’re hitting 100 mph. This car has comes with a top speed of 188 mph.\n\nNow, those speeds won’t get you the EPA gas mileage numbers of 15 mpg in the city and 23 mpg on the highway, which are pretty respectable for the amount of power this car pushes. And the non-turbo model still pumps out impressive power too. The regular 4.8-liter V-8 in the Panamera still provides 400 horsepower and 369 pound-feet of torque.\n\nThat means in the highway’s acceleration lane, no matter which car you’re driving, you will pass people. Almost anywhere on the road, when you look around, you can be pretty confident that you are the fastest vehicle within eyesight.\n\nLithe as a cat\n\nWhile the twin turbos were supposed to help eliminate turbo lag — that gap of time between when the driver says, “OK now, hang on” and the moment the passenger says “whoa,” the Panamera still has a bit of moment. It’s as if it’s just taking a second to collect its thoughts before it heads for warp speed.\n\nBut it’s a minor complaint because the Panamera is such a thrill to drive. The optional air suspension is adjustable to three modes that makes the sedan silky smooth or sport-centric harsh. The engine pushes out 500 horsepower and 516 pound-feet of torque. It’s a rollercoaster on freefall. When you hit the gas, the kids in the back might toss their arms up into the air.\n\nBetter yet, it keeps all of Porsche’s cat-like maneuverability. Its big wheels stick to the road as if it were flypaper, and you can rip around corners. The giant brakes make stopping this 4,300-pound beast a breeze. The steering is sharp and precise to a level that blows you away when you spend most of your driving cars with price tags a quarter or less than the Panamera.\n\nThat’s yet another reason to get behind the wheel of this vehicle. It’s the pure speed and luxury. How can someone evaluate chocolate if he’s never tasted the best?\n\nAs for its long hood and wide body, the Panamera somehow adds two doors and still keeps its distinctive Porsche silhouette. The style remains understated, but pure Porsche.\n\nPurists may not care for this car, but it wasn’t designed for them from the beginning. This is ideal for the man or woman who had to give up the Porsche because the family was growing. Then it just wasn’t practical.\n\nNow it is.\n\nThe Panamera doesn’t break the mold as much as it recasts it.\n\nNow, people just need to learn how to pronounce it.\n\nsburgess@detnews.com (313) 223-3217\n\nReport Card\n\nOverall: *** 1/2\n\nExterior: Good. Keeps distinctive Porsche looks while going bigger and wider.\n\nInterior: Excellent. Extremely comfortable and luxurious interior. It’s nearly impossible to not find a comfortable position in the seats, and displays and layout are ideal for drivers.\n\nPerformance: Excellent. It may be big, but it drives much smaller. The twin turbocharged engine provides maximum power, and the air suspension gives you maximum performance.\n\nPros: This sedan lives up to the Porsche legacy in every way.\n\nCons: Turbo model starts at over $130,000 and, well, you’ve just gotta get the turbo.\n\nGrading Scale\n\n**** Excellent *** Good ** Fair * Poor",

      "expert_review": "Competes with: Audi A8, BMW 8 Series Gran Coupe, Lexus LS 500, Mercedes-Benz S-Class\n\nLooks like: Porsche isn’t messing with the Panamera formula, at least not on the outside\n\nPowertrains: 348-horsepower, turbocharged 2.9-liter V-6 or 670-hp, twin-turbo 4.0-liter hybrid V-8; eight-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission; rear- or all-wheel drive\n\nHits dealerships: Spring 2024\n\nPorsche’s Panamera enters its third generation with a redesigned model set to hit U.S. showrooms in the spring of 2024. The Sport Turismo wagon body style drops from the lineup, and it takes a close examination to tell the difference between the second- and third-generation hatchbacks from the outside. Appearances aside, though, Porsche has packed the new car with loads of trick tech — and, of course, power.\n\nRelated: 2024 Porsche Cayenne S E-Hybrid Completes SUV’s Hybrid Lineup\n\nPlatform and Powertrain Specs\n\nMeasuring 198.9 inches long, 76.3 inches wide and 56 inches high, the 2024 Panamera’s basic dimensions are similar to its predecessor’s. The air intakes in the front are slightly larger than before; a thin slit above the front license plate is new; and squared-off headlights — LEDs are standard for 2024 — sit slightly more proudly from the hood. Mostly, though, what distinguishes the 2024 Panamera from the outgoing generation is under the skin.\n\nAn air suspension with Porsche Active Suspension Management adaptive shock absorbers is standard. Rear-wheel steering is available, and hybrid Panameras offer Porsche Active Ride, with new active shocks the company claims offer a wider spread of comfort and performance settings. Driven by a hydraulic pump, this setup can, in Porsche’s words, “overcompensate pitch and roll movements,” leaning the car into turns, forward under acceleration and back under braking. We’re excited to plant a cup of coffee in a cupholder and see just how extreme the movements are.\n\nAs before, Porsche will offer the Panamera with a choice of V-6 and V-8 engines, although, so far, the company is only sharing details on the base V-6 and Turbo E-Hybrid. Eventually, Porsche says it will offer four different E-Hybrid powertrains; our guess is they will again be rear- and all-wheel-drive V-6s as well as AWD Turbo and Turbo S variants. The base Panamera still uses a turbocharged 2.9-liter V-6, although revised tuning nets gains of 23 horsepower and 37 pounds-feet of torque over 2023, for totals of 348 hp and 368 pounds-feet, respectively. All Panamera engines are mated to an eight-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. Porsche says the rear-drive Panamera will accelerate to 60 mph in 5 seconds and hit a top speed of 169 mph, while the AWD Panamera 4 will hit 60 mph in 4.7 seconds and top out at 168 mph.\n\nBattery capacity for the Panamera hybrids increases from 17.9 kilowatt-hours to 25.9 kWh. Porsche claims an accompanying increase in electric-only range of 70%. The 2023 Turbo S E-Hybrid only managed 17 miles on juice alone, so expect the 2024 model to come close to, if not surpass, 30 miles.\n\nIn addition to the electric motor, the 2024 Panamera Turbo E-Hybrid packs a revamped twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8. Total system output of 670 hp and 658 pounds-feet should fling the plug-in to 60 mph in just 3 seconds flat and on to a top speed of 195 mph.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nIs the 2024 Porsche Cayenne S a Good SUV? 4 Pros and 3 Cons\n2024 Porsche Cayenne Turbo E-Hybrid Gets Big Boost to Power, Battery Size\n2024 Porsche 718 Spyder RS: Open-Top Driving at 9,000 RPM\nMore Porsche News\nSimplified Interior, Updated Safety Tech\n\nSince the Panamera debuted in 2009, its center console has been a busy place, packed with buttons and switches. The 2024 model’s is massively cleaned up, with even the gear selector moved to the dashboard, just behind the steering wheel. Porsche has yet to share many details of the Panamera’s digital instrument cluster and touchscreen infotainment system, but it does say a 10.9-inch passenger screen will be available. Android Auto, Apple CarPlay and a wireless charging pad are standard.\n\nPorsche has updated many of the car’s safety features, as well. The adaptive cruise control integrates traffic sign recognition and can automatically adjust the car’s speed accordingly. The lane departure steering assist system is updated, and emergency steering assist is also available. The optional Remote ParkAssist not only enables the Panamera to automatically enter or exit a parking space, but allows it to do so with the driver outside of the vehicle.\n\nAvailability and Pricing\n\nThe 2024 Porsche Panamera will arrive at dealerships in the spring of 2024 — or V-6 models will, anyway; Porsche will announce timing and pricing for the Turbo E-Hybrid later. With RWD, the V-6 Panamera will start at $101,550; the AWD Panamera 4 will start at $108,550 (prices include $1,650 destination fee).\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The new V-6 Porsche Panamera sedan is a lower-priced but perfectly viable alternative to the more powerful versions that made their debut close to a year ago.\n\nCars.com editor Mike Hanley gave a comprehensive rundown of fthe first two trim levels in his review of the 2010 Porsche Panamera S and the Panamera Turbo. Comprehensive specs and pricing aren’t available for the 2011 lineup as of this writing, but we do know that the new V-6 model, called simply the Panamera, starts at $74,400 and the all-wheel-drive Panamera 4 is $78,900. The S and Porsche Panamera 4S are $89,800 and $94,700, respectively, and the Turbo is $135,300.\n\nI’ll share my driving impressions of both V-6 versions, which I drove both on roads and a track.\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nThe new trim level looks like the higher ones, but a few things distinguish it. The most obvious is the trim surrounding the side windows, which is matte black rather than chrome. The dual exhaust terminates in single versions of the Panamera Turbo’s split tailpipes. The Panamera S has two round pipes per side. Five-spoke, 18-inch alloy wheels are standard, as are black brake calipers. The Panamera S has silver calipers, and the Turbo’s are red.\n\nAn optional brake package includes ceramic composite brake discs and yellow-painted calipers.\n\nSatisfying Power\n\nJust a few years ago I would have written off the Panamera’s V-6 version as falling short of Porsche buyers’ expectations. Two things have changed my perspective: One is the power provided by Porsche’s new V-6. The second is the surprising success of the Cayenne SUV’s V-6 version — following my dire predictions to the contrary.\n\nIt might be a V-6, but the Porsche Panamera has more than enough power for secure, even spirited, driving. Teamed with a seven-speed, dual-clutch automated manual transmission, the 300 horsepower moves the vehicle with authority. Unlike some of today’s V-6 engines, Porsche’s doesn’t skimp on torque, either. It’s a healthy 295 lb-ft at 3,750 rpm. Redline is at 6,700 rpm. The car does zero to 60 mph in 6 seconds, and the Porsche Panamera 4 is a couple tenths of a second quicker. The added traction of all-wheel drive more than overcomes its additional weight. If you want to be quicker still, the optional Sport Chrono Package provides a launch-control feature that shaves another two-tenths by allowing the engine to rev high before it dumps the clutch. The top speed is 160 mph, according to Porsche.\n\n2011 Panamera Trim Levels Compared\n \t Panamera\tPanamera 4 \tPanamera S \tPanamera 4S \tPanamera Turbo \n0-60 (sec.)\t6.0\t5.8\t5.2\t4.8\t4.0\n0-60 w/ Sport Chrono package* (sec.)\t5.8\t5.6\t5.0\t4.6\t3.8\nTop speed (mph)\t160\t159\t175\t175\t188\nCity mpg\t18\t18\t16\t16\t15\nHighway mpg\t27\t26\t24\t24\t23\nCombined mpg\t21\t21\t19\t19\t18\nWeight distribution (front/rear, percent)\t52.6/47.4\t52.7/47.3\t53.9/46.1\t54.6/45.4\t55.3/44.7\n\n\nSource: Porsche\n\n*The Sport Chrono option also includes a launch-control function that allows the engine to achieve high rpm before taking off.\n\n \n\nThe PDK transmission (where “P” stands for Porsche and “DK” is for the German translation of dual-clutch transmission) works well with the smaller engine. Like most transmissions of this type, there’s a slight lurch from a standing start if you don’t wait a beat after letting off the brake before you hit the accelerator. It lets the clutch engage more smoothly. Upshifts and downshifts are reasonably quick and decisive. Where the transmission wasn’t as good as some was in reading my mind, kicking down at the most appropriate time without my having to resort to the shift buttons on the steering wheel. To be fair, modern transmissions are designed to adapt to one’s driving style, and the gearbox and I didn’t have much time to get to know each other.\n\nThe Panamera has a standard Auto Start Stop feature whereby the engine turns off when you come to a complete stop. It starts again, seamlessly, when you lift off the brake pedal. Porsche says the provision is good for mileage gains of a percentage point or two, though the U.S. EPA’s test cycle isn’t structured to reflect it. Still, the Panamera’s mileage is pretty good, at 18/27 mpg city/highway, or 18/26 with all-wheel drive. The Start Stop feature can be deactivated if you don’t like it.\n\nAnyone who’s turned off by Porsche’s use of a Volkswagen six-cylinder in the Cayenne (I plead guilty, though I probably shouldn’t care) will be pleased to know the Panamera’s 3.6-liter V-6 is a Porsche design, basically the company’s 4.8-liter V-8 with two fewer cylinders. The Porsche Panamera happily accepts a shorter-block derivation of the S trim level’s 90-degree V-8, with its two proper heads. A narrow-angle, single-head engine, the Cayenne’s V-6 was too tall for the vehicle anyway.\n\nPeek under the hood, and the two absent cylinders couldn’t be more obvious: There’s more free space than I’ve seen in a vehicle’s engine compartment in years, between the radiator and the engine. The V-6 both weighs less and shifts the mass rearward, giving the Panamera the best front/rear weight distribution of the lineup: 52.6/47.4 percent. Porsche says the Panamera 4’s additional hardware shifts the balance forward only 0.1 percent to 52.7/47.3, but the car feels quite different to me.\n\nI hit the track first in the Panamera 4, which feels nicely balanced indeed, but the extra weight that seems invisible in off-the-line sprints makes itself known here. Thanks to an optional adaptive suspension, it didn’t heave its weight around, but there’s simply not enough power to exploit the grip of four driven wheels. In normal driving, you’re fine. On a track, or anything resembling one, you want to build the speed that the chassis and brakes could easily take. It’s tough to do so.\n\nThe rear-drive Porsche Panamera feels like a different vehicle. From the first turn it felt lighter, more tossable and more fun. You won’t mistake it for a V-8, but the driveline and a liberal stability control setting let you slide the rear end about in ways the Panamera 4 never could. It’s enough to provide this lesser-powered version with a bit of fun, even in normal driving.\n\nSafety\n\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety hasn’t crash-tested the Panamera — or any other Porsche — apparently ever. Low-volume models typically go untested, and Porsche, as a brand, is low-volume. The European New Car Assessment Program, whose stringent tests provide some indication of an American model’s crashworthiness, also hasn’t tested any Porsches. Though we find the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s five-star program of limited value, it’s not relevant in this case. That organization hasn’t tested the Panamera either.\n\nThe Porsche Panamera’s front occupants get frontal, knee and seat-mounted side-impact airbags. There are also side-impact airbags for the rear seats, as well as curtain airbags to cover the side windows for both rows of leather seats. Antilock disc brakes and an electronic stability system with traction control are included.\n\nPanamera in the Market\n\nI’m not wild about the Porsche Panamera’s rear end, and I know I’m not alone in that. Otherwise, I’m impressed with what you get. The hatchback lends more versatility than you’ll find in the average full-size luxury sedan, and the seats fold down, too. Good luck finding that in a competing car. Though the backseat accommodates just two, how many vehicles’ backseats truly hold three in comfort? The Panamera commits to its two rear passengers with a substantial center console and plenty of legroom.\n\nOnce you consider all these positives, you could easily accept a merely adequate driving experience. Thankfully, the Porsche Panamera exceeds expectations in this regard, even when equipped with the base, V-6 engine.\n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "Key Points in This Review:\nThe 2025 Porsche Panamera GTS is both fast and quick, with a twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8 that’s good for 493 horsepower, a 0-60 mph run of 3.6 seconds and a top speed of 188 mph.\nWith a firm ride and heavier steering, the GTS is also the most sporting trim level in the Panamera lineup.\nExpect to pay up for this performance: The as-tested price of the Panamera GTS in this review was $178,000.\n\nI’m a big fan of grand touring. Or rather, I love labeling some of my road trips as such, all depending on how evocative the journey is with regard to the “what” and “where.” An Aston Martin up the coast of France? Magnifique. Grand touring! A long drive through Iowan and Nebraskan cornfields in an F-150? Rustic, but that’s a road trip. A blast from Los Angeles to Monterey, Calif., in a 2025 Porsche Panamera? A tour, done grandly.\n\nRelated: 2025 Porsche Panamera 4, 4S E-Hybrids: Power and Efficiency\n\nGrand touring is, after all, almost entirely down to the car — or in this case, the grand tourer. Classically speaking, a GT is fast, luxurious and capable of comfortably fitting two adults and with enough luggage for a weekend getaway. These days, the lines are blurred between sports car and GT to where cars like the Ferrari 12Cilindri and Aston Martin Vanquish are nearly as happy on the track as on the Route Napoleon. Even the edgy Porsche 911 is big enough, comfortable enough and well-composed enough to simultaneously elevate a road trip while fading into the background when not needed.\n\nBut even the plushest and most upfitted 911 isn’t Porsche’s best big-distance bruiser. That honor falls to the Panamera. Its big power, beaucoup features, sharp handling, fine materials and a big-arse cargo area trunk makes for a proper GT — albeit with an extra set of doors.\n\n2025 Porsche Panamera, rear | Cars.com photo by Brandon Lim\nWhat Is Porsche’s GTS Trim?\n\nThere isn’t a bad GT in the Panamera lineup, though you’d best weigh your priorities when considering the available trim levels. My test drive began with a lovely Gentian Blue Panamera 4 E-Hybrid, complete with Porsche’s trick Active Ride tech — which, in the 25 or so urban miles I put under its wheels, turned pavement to pillows. The plug-in hybrid Panamera 4 variant is far from the raciest, but I was quite looking forward to floating my way up to Monterey, happily trading pace for grace.\n\nIt wasn’t to be. Quite literally as I pulled out of my street to head out on a five-hour “tour,” a glitch in the air-conditioning system resulted in the E-Hybrid being swapped for a Panamera GTS — the most driver-focused entry in the Panamera lineup. I was immensely grateful for any replacement at all, but gone was the Active Ride system, the sedate plug-in powertrain, creamy leather touchpoints and cushy-sidewall tires. In their place were carbon fiber and simulated suede trim, ceramic brakes and launch control.\n\nThe GTS is the only way to get a V-8 in your Panamera without stepping up to either a Turbo or Turbo S E-Hybrid. Porsche’s familiar twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8 snorts and whistles out 493 horsepower and 486 pounds-feet of torque and sends it to all four wheels via an eight-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. Those are healthy figures, but at the same time, they’re also relatively dowdy in the context of the GTS’ purpose and its $178,000 as-tested price.\n\nThis blasé reaction to nearly 500 hp is a direct symptom of perspective rot: Backed by standard all-wheel drive and that eight-speed transmission, launch-control starts are violent enough to fling phones from cupholders and press you deep, deep into the GTS’ ventilated leather seats. The metallic gnash you hear from that boosted V-8 is an oily, mechanical racket, more salvo than sonorous — but also quieter than you might expect.\n\nHow Comfortable Is the Porsche Panamera GTS?\n\nThe exhaust is about the only thing that’s muffled in this car. An adaptive air suspension cuts the range between firm and yeeowch, while massive 275-wide front and 325-wide rear Bridgestone tires hop and slip during low-speed parking lot and U-turn maneuvers. Steering is on the heavier side, and you must be vigilant to not scrape the car’s low front end as you exit carparks and shopping centers.\n\nSound like too much for daily use? Hardly. This is all within the context of the Panamera lineup, and it proves that Porsche was serious about positioning the GTS as the driver’s choice. Left alone and in Normal drive mode, the GTS’ powertrain is no more aggressive than Porsche’s entry-level V-6, and its transmission is no harsher than the gearbox found in the base Macan SUV.\n\nIt’s right there in the name — “Gran Turismo Sport.” You only really notice these titanium-tipped edges when crawling through traffic or nosing it around a dense urban environment with broken pavement and tight parking. Out on the open highways that cut through California’s Central Valley, the GTS was a leather-wrapped railgun, swallowing miles by the hundreds while I sat at the wheel enjoying Porsche’s excellent adaptive cruise control and the GTS’ upgraded Bose sound system.\n\nHow Does the Porsche Panamera GTS Drive?\n\nPassing and merging are an explosive affair, with any obstacle buzzing along under the “irresponsible” mark easily dispatched with audible turbocharger whistle and a filthy roar. Then, it was back to a refined background grumble as I settled into a cruise speed best described as, ah, healthy.\n\nHandling? Well, as my weeklong loan was intended to take me to Monterey Car Week, I had little opportunity to hustle the GTS outside the straight and narrow environs between there and Los Angeles, which were traffic-clogged at least two-thirds of the time. However, a few cheeky chucks on 17 Mile Drive and a very brief venture into Big Sur revealed I was really missing out. Body roll is minimal and grip is tremendous, backed by options like rear-wheel steering and brutally effective carbon-ceramic brakes that will wrest your fillings from your mouth (and $9,870 from your wallet).\n\nYou get all of this plus ample space for passengers and luggage. It’s quiet when it needs to be, comfortable when left alone, faster than its numbers suggest, and loaded to the gills with tech and creature comforts. Like the best grand tourers and greatest performance sedans, it’s all things to everyone with no flat spots.\n\nA grand car, a grand trip, a grand GTS.\n\n2025 Porsche Panamera, front | Cars.com photo by Brandon Lim\n\nMore Porsche News From Cars.com:\n\n2025 Porsche 911 Carrera S Review: What More Could You Possibly Need?\n2025 Porsche 911 Carrera Cabriolet Review: Effortless Excellence\n2025 Porsche Macan Electric Review: Is It a True Porsche Among Electric SUVs?\nPorsche Cayenne Electric to Debut Brand’s Next-Gen Interior\nPorsche Doubles (Non-Turbo) AWD 911 Lineup With New 4S Models\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in September 2010 about the 2011 Porsche Panamera. Apart from the addition of a new top trim level, the Panamera Turbo S, little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2012, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe new V-6 Porsche Panamera is a lower-priced but perfectly viable alternative to the more powerful versions that made their debut close to a year ago.\n\nCars.com editor Mike Hanley gave a comprehensive rundown of fthe first two trim levels in his review of the 2010 Panamera S and the Panamera Turbo. Comprehensive specs and pricing aren’t available for the 2011 lineup as of this writing, but we do know that the new V-6 model, called simply the Panamera, starts at $74,400 and the all-wheel-drive Panamera 4 is $78,900. The S and 4S are $89,800 and $94,700, respectively, and the Turbo is $135,300.\n\nI’ll share my driving impressions of both V-6 versions, which I drove both on roads and a track.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe new trim level looks like the higher ones, but a few things distinguish it. The most obvious is the trim surrounding the side windows, which is matte black rather than chrome. The dual exhaust terminates in single versions of the Panamera Turbo’s split tailpipes. The Panamera S has two round pipes per side. Five-spoke, 18-inch alloy wheels are standard, as are black brake calipers. The Panamera S has silver calipers, and the Turbo’s are red. An optional brake package includes ceramic composite brake discs and yellow-painted calipers.\n\nSatisfying Power\nJust a few years ago I would have written off the Panamera’s V-6 version as falling short of Porsche buyers’ expectations. Two things have changed my perspective: One is the power provided by Porsche’s new V-6. The second is the surprising success of the Cayenne SUV’s V-6 version — following my dire predictions to the contrary.\n\nIt might be a V-6, but the Panamera has more than enough power for secure, even spirited, driving. Teamed with a seven-speed, dual-clutch automated manual transmission, the 300-horsepower engine moves the car with authority. Unlike some of today’s V-6 engines, Porsche’s doesn’t skimp on torque, either. It’s a healthy 295 pounds-feet at 3,750 rpm. Redline is at 6,700 rpm. The car does zero to 60 mph in 6 seconds, and the Panamera 4 is a couple tenths of a second quicker. The added traction of all-wheel drive more than overcomes the extra weight. If you want to be quicker still, the optional Sport Chrono Package provides a launch-control feature that shaves another two-tenths by allowing the engine to rev high before it dumps the clutch. The top speed is 160 mph, according to Porsche.\n\n2011 Panamera Trim Levels Compared\n \tPanamera\tPanamera 4\tPanamera S\tPanamera 4S\tPanamera Turbo\n0-60 (sec.)\t6.0\t5.8\t5.2\t4.8\t4.0\n0-60 w/ Sport Chrono package* (sec.)\t5.8\t5.6\t5.0\t4.6\t3.8\nTop speed (mph)\t160\t159\t175\t175\t188\nCity mpg\t18\t18\t16\t16\t15\nHighway mpg\t27\t26\t24\t24\t23\nCombined mpg\t21\t21\t19\t19\t18\nWeight distribution (front/rear, percent)\t52.6/47.4\t52.7/47.3\t53.9/46.1\t54.6/45.4\t55.3/44.7\n\n\nSource: Porsche\n\n*The Sport Chrono option also includes a launch-control function that allows the engine to achieve high rpm before taking off.\n\n \n\nThe PDK transmission (where “P” stands for Porsche and “DK” is for the German translation of dual-clutch transmission) works well with the smaller engine. Like most transmissions of this type, there’s a slight lurch from a standing start if you don’t wait a beat after letting off the brake before you hit the accelerator. It lets the clutch engage more smoothly. Upshifts and downshifts are reasonably quick and decisive. The transmission wasn’t too good at reading my mind, kicking down at the most appropriate time without my having to resort to the shift buttons on the steering wheel. To be fair, modern transmissions are designed to adapt to one’s driving style, and the gearbox and I didn’t have much time to get to know each other.\n\nThe Panamera has a standard auto start-stop feature whereby the engine turns off when you come to a complete stop. It starts again, seamlessly, when you lift off the brake pedal. Porsche says the provision is good for mileage gains of a percentage point or two, though the U.S. EPA’s test cycle isn’t structured to reflect it. Still, the Panamera’s mileage is pretty good, at 18/27 mpg city/highway, or 18/26 with all-wheel drive. The start-stop feature can be deactivated if you don’t like it.\n\nAnyone who’s turned off by Porsche’s use of a Volkswagen six-cylinder in the Cayenne (I plead guilty, though I probably shouldn’t care) will be pleased to know the Panamera’s 3.6-liter V-6 is a Porsche design, basically the company’s 4.8-liter V-8 with two fewer cylinders. The Panamera happily accepts a shorter-block derivation of the S trim level’s 90-degree V-8, with its two proper heads. A narrow-angle, single-head engine, the Cayenne’s V-6 was too tall for the car anyway.\n\nPeek under the hood, and the two absent cylinders couldn’t be more obvious: There’s more free space than I’ve seen in an engine compartment in years, between the radiator and the engine. The V-6 both weighs less and shifts the mass rearward, giving the Panamera the best front/rear weight distribution of the lineup: 52.6/47.4 percent. Porsche says the Panamera 4’s additional hardware shifts the balance forward only 0.1 percent to 52.7/47.3, but the car feels quite different to me.\n\nI hit the track first in the Panamera 4, which feels nicely balanced indeed, but the extra weight that seems invisible in off-the-line sprints makes itself known here. Thanks to an optional adaptive suspension, it didn’t heave its weight around, but there’s simply not enough power to exploit the grip of four driven wheels. In normal driving, you’re fine. On a track, or anything resembling one, you want to build the speed that the chassis and brakes could easily take. It’s tough to do so.\n\nThe rear-drive Panamera feels like a different car. From the first turn it felt lighter, more tossable and more fun. You won’t mistake it for a V-8, but the driveline and a liberal stability control setting let you slide the rear end about in ways the Panamera 4 never could. It’s enough to provide this lesser-powered version with a bit of fun, even in normal driving.\n\nSafety\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety hasn’t crash-tested the Panamera — or any other Porsche — apparently ever. Low-volume models typically go untested, and Porsche, as a brand, is low-volume. The European New Car Assessment Program, whose stringent tests provide some indication of an American model’s crashworthiness, also hasn’t tested any Porsches. Though we find the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s five-star program of limited value, it’s not relevant in this case. That organization hasn’t tested the Panamera, either.\n\nThe Panamera’s front occupants get frontal, knee and seat-mounted side-impact airbags. There are also side-impact airbags for the rear seats, as well as curtain airbags to cover the side windows for both rows of seats. Antilock disc brakes and an electronic stability system with traction control are included.\n\nPanamera in the Market\nI’m not wild about the Panamera’s rear end, and I know I’m not alone in that. Otherwise, I’m impressed with what you get. The hatchback lends more versatility than you’ll find in the average full-size luxury sedan, and the seats fold down, too. Good luck finding that in a competing car. Though the backseat accommodates just two, how many cars’ backseats truly hold three in comfort? The Panamera commits to its two rear passengers with a substantial center console and plenty of legroom.\n\nOnce you consider all these positives, you could easily accept a merely adequate driving experience. Thankfully, the Panamera exceeds expectations in this regard, even when equipped with the base V-6 engine.\n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "The Porsche Panamera comes as a four-seat hatchback in regular or long wheelbase versions, the latter dubbed Executive. Compare them here. Typical of a pricey luxury car, mechanical configurations are numerous: Porsche offers three engines, three suspensions and rear- or all-wheel drive for 2017, and there are two plug-in hybrids and a Panamera Sport Turismo wagon coming for 2018 (see our First Drive here). Prices for the 2017 Panamera models range from the mid-$80,000s to well over $200,000 if you indulge in Porsche’s cornucopia of near-bespoke options. Our six-figure test car was an all-wheel-drive Panamera 4S with the mid-level engine and suspension.\n\nSlimmer Rear\n\nGone is the old Porsche Panamera’s bulbous rear end, replaced with svelte lines past the B-pillar. The redesign still looks like a Panamera, but it has the nip-and-tuck job the first generation badly needed. A few key dimensional changes reduce the bloat: Overall roof height is a skosh higher near the B-pillar but down nearly an inch at the rear axle, making for a more aesthetic roofline. Throw on thinner taillights with a connecting LED strip, to emulate the current 911 sports car, and it’s all easier on the eyes. Executive variants add 5.9 inches in wheelbase, and all models offer a panoply of wheels (19 to 21 inches), lighting configurations and bumper designs.\n\nStrong Power\n\nWith its twin-turbo 2.9-liter V-6 engine (making 440 horsepower and 405 pounds-feet of torque), the Porsche Panamera packs gratifying low-end power, energetic revving and an exhaust note that evokes exotic cars.\n\nOne Cars.com editor found overall power more modest than the numbers suggest, but others observed plenty of it, especially in the drivetrain’s two sportier driving modes. Dialed to such settings, the transmission — a new eight-speed version of Porsche’s dual-clutch PDK automatic — can occasionally ram into gears with unexpected suddenness, but it’s an otherwise seamless unit, downshifting two or three gears at once when you hit the gas at cruising speed. I just wish the Panamera’s Normal driving mode would summon such lively response. It introduces noticeable drivetrain lag, a factor that may prompt you to drive only in one of the sport modes, gas mileage be damned.\n\nShoppers can also get a single-turbo 3.0-liter V-6 (330 hp, 331 pounds-feet of torque) or a twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8 (550 hp, 567 pounds-feet of torque). All-wheel drive is optional with the base V-6, which otherwise comes with rear-drive; the other engines pair only with AWD. Porsche says the base rear-wheel car hits 60 mph in 5.4 seconds, which is certainly quick enough. The Panamera 4S gets there in the low 4s, while the Porsche Panamera Turbo hits the mark in a silly-quick 3.4 seconds. Those times go well beyond necessary acceleration, but if maximum power is your thing, no flagship four-door comes close to the Tesla Model S P100D (which Tesla says gets to 60 in as little as 2.8 seconds).\n\nRide and Handling\n\nThe Porsche Panamera’s handling limits are distant: You’d really have to push the car hard on a racetrack to slide it around, which we didn’t have an opportunity to do in our time with it. Still, its reflexes suggest fairly neutral balance. The steering feels a touch numb, but the nose tracks well in sweeping curves even with abrupt steering motions — situations that tend to produce push. The tail exhibits little unexpected movement, and broken pavement seldom upsets things. Much credit goes to our test car’s Michelin Pilot Sport 4 high-performance summer tires, which stuck like glue\n\nWith its optional three-chamber air springs and standard adaptive shock absorbers, the Panamera’s controlled ride is comfortable enough, but it’s firmer than some shoppers in this class may prefer. Those looking for deliberate softness should consider the cloudlike suspension tuning in a front-engine Mercedes-Benz S-Class or BMW 7 Series. The Panamera rides a touch busy at low speeds, a sensation that evokes the segment’s less pillowy contenders, like the Audi A8 and Jaguar XJ.\n\nCoil springs are standard with the adaptive shocks. Air springs and active stabilizer bars are separate options. Our test car had the air springs but not the active stabilizer bars, which should theoretically minimize body roll even more, but that was hardly a problem in our Panamera. Other performance options run the gamut, from an electronically locking rear differential to massive six-piston carbon-ceramic brakes.\n\nCuriously, Porsche didn’t throw the long ball on self-driving capabilities. There are technologies out there — ranging from Cadillac’s Super Cruise to Audi’s forthcoming Traffic Jam Pilot — that promise hands-free driving under certain conditions. Tesla says its current cars will be capable of much more than that with future software updates. But the Panamera remains a hands-on, driver-needed experience. Brand ethos notwithstanding, that’s disappointing for a redesigned car at this price.\n\nLane-change departure warning and steering assist are available, and the Porsche Panamera’s adaptive cruise control can adjust speed and gear selection based on your navigation route over the next 1.8 miles. But the car doesn’t combine its various features with adaptive cruise control into a selectable mode (often using the term “pilot”) as some brands do. Porsche officials told us the Panamera lacks true lane-centering steering, and it won’t drive itself under any circumstances. I’m underwhelmed.\n\nThe Inside\n\nThe Panamera’s remodeled interior is dazzling to behold, but some of the novelty wears thin fast. Like before, the dash drops into a flying buttress of a center console — a layout that would crowd knee space were it not for the cabin’s generous width. Gone is the old Panamera’s button-crowded console, but its replacement might be worse: capacitive-touch buttons dotting a piano-black panel, with few storage areas.\n\nSome buttons have detents to give feedback, and there are mechanical controls for temperature, volume and tuning, yet problems persist — some inherent, some solvable. The panel is ripe for dust and fingerprints, and its touch-sensitive shortcut keys are a clear step backward from physical controls. The 12.3-inch touchscreen above it is fast and reasonably intuitive, but it lacks Android Auto capability (Apple CarPlay is optional). To adjust the vanes of the center air vents, you have to access a separate menu and drag your finger around on a screen to change the louvers. It remembers the prior position with automatic climate control, but if you want to move the vanes, it’s a pain. I suppose a plastic nub, like every other vent has, would have made far too much sense.\n\nAs expected for a car in this price range, cabin materials are lush, with vinyl-wrapped portions of the upper dash and doors that could pass for real leather. (Real leather is optional on both areas, as well as on surfaces as obscure as the steering column.) The standard seats are heavy on bolstering but comfortable overall, though tall drivers may find limited adjustment range; my 6-foot frame needed the driver’s seat nearly all the way back. Power-adjustable seats are standard, and the optional sport seats have additional bolstering and more power adjustments.\n\nAll four seats sit relatively low to the floor. While drivers might appreciate this, adult passengers in back will find their knees uncomfortably elevated — especially compared with the expansive backseats elsewhere in the class. Legroom in the regular-wheelbase model is otherwise good, and there’s decent headroom given the redesign’s lower roofline. If you plan to haul kids, go here to see our evaluation of car-seat provisions. (As of publication, Porsche hasn’t provided specs for rear legroom on the Executive model, but the prior generation added about 5 inches versus standard Panameras.)\n\nThe Porsche Panamera’s body style pays clear dividends in cargo room. The trunk and 40/20/40-split folding backseat have practical advantages versus many sedan competitors, most of which lack folding seats altogether. But you pay for it in diminished rearward visibility, with thick C- and D-pillars and a tiny rear window. The two rear seats have fixed head restraints, which block even more of the view. Pick your poison.\n\nA power liftgate is standard. Executive Panamera models have similar trunk volume but 11 percent more space with the seats folded (52.6 versus 47.3 cubic feet). If you need to seat five, next year’s Sport Turismo will offer a three-position rear bench.\n\nStill a Maverick\n\nSlather on the options and you can get a Porsche Panamera with quad-zone climate control, leather wrappings as far as the eye can see, massaging seats and all manner of comforts for rear passengers — but it will set you back a healthy six-figure sum. At that, Porsche’s redesigned four-door remains a notable outsider to many flagship sedans. It drives like a brash alternative, and it looks the part, too — outside and in. Peculiarities aside, that should continue to draw shoppers.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The 2013 Porsche Panamera might just be the perfect car for the mom or dad wanting prestige, performance and panache, with just enough comfort and functionality thrown in to work as a daily driver.\n\nRather than having a sporty car for fun and a family sedan for function, blend the two in the Panamera GTS and save the extra space in your garage for something else.\n\nThe 2013 Panamera GTS I drove is a newcomer to the model’s lineup. This year, the Panamera is available in five trim levels: the base rear-drive Panamera 2 (and the base all-wheel drive Porsche Panamera 4), the S, the GTS, the Turbo and the Turbo S. The Panamera and Panamera S come with a choice of rear-wheel-drive or all-wheel drive, while the GTS and the Turbos are exclusively all-wheel drive. Apart from the new GTS, changes between the 2012 and 2013 versions are few (see them compared here).\n\nIn my opinion, the Porsche Panamera has no direct competitors, but shoppers are likely to consider it alongside sedans like the BMW 7 Series and the Mercedes-Benz S-Class (see them compared). Because the Panamera’s trim levels range from $76,825 to $176,275 (including a $975 destination charge), it gets into Mercedes-AMG territory, and also overlaps the 2012 Maserati Quattroporte and comes within $10,000 of the 2012 Bentley Continental Flying Spur (compare side by side).\n\nIf you like the four-door, performance-luxury, functional-hatchback category, on either end of the Panamera are the 2012 BMW 550 Gran Turismo ($66,895) and the 2012 Aston Martin Rapide ($210,010).\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe Porsche Panamera’s long, lean exterior styling is polarizing, to say the least. At least it evokes some type of response, rather than eliciting nothing more than a blank, bored stare. I happen to appreciate its aggressive-looking low stance, blended with muscular hips and a handsome, masculine nose. I gazed and gawked at my test car as I would a marble sculpture of a naked Roman god.\n\nMy husband, on the other hand, couldn’t quite see my point of view on this one. (I wonder why?) One day he’d claim that the Panamera’s unique back end was growing on him, while the next day he was back to disdainful loathing.\n\nOne thing that’s not up for debate is the functionality that distinctive shape lends the Panamera. Because it’s so long, it can have four full-sized doors so rear passengers can easily climb in and out without incredible feats of acrobatic flexibility.\n\nAlso, its larger rear end results in a hatchback cargo space that’s big enough for most tasks a family can throw at it. You’ve got to hand it to the Panamera’s designers for figuring out how to take a functional shape and make it look unique and “automotively” fashion-forward.\n\nFAMILY-FRIENDLY FEATURES\nConsidering the Panamera isn’t built to haul a huge family, it’s surprising how well my family and I adjusted, so long as I left one of my three kiddos out. My oldest daughter just turned 12, so she was quite happy to exercise her independence and stay home while I took the younger two (ages 7 and 9) to the pool for a few hours. The two seats in the back were a good fit for two kids, even in booster seats. The full-size, bolstered seats in the Panamera GTS cradled my girls’ Bubble Bum booster seats perfectly. There was enough legroom in the backseat (33.3 inches) not only for my kids, but also for full-sized adults.\n\nThe center console between the optionally heated rear seats houses two cupholders and a storage bin. There’s also an additional storage area inside the fold-down armrest. The only complaint from the little ones was that the Porsche’s windowsills are quite high, making it tough for them to see out their windows even when lifted up slightly by their booster seats. This might be a problem for kids who are prone to motion sickness.\n\nFrom the driver’s seat, the Porsche Panamera GTS looks like a super high-tech jet cockpit. At first glance, all the buttons seem like overkill; however, taking just a couple of minutes to locate the essentials and understand how things were organized clarified things for me.\n\nThere is space for only one true built-in cupholder in the center console up front. Two additional (somewhat flimsy) ones pop out of the dash just above the glove box when needed, but they get in the way of the passenger and could very easily break when someone gets in or out and smacks them with a knee. I would have preferred a second cupholder over the antiquated ashtray and cigarette lighter.\n\nThe Porsche Panamera’s cargo space is incredibly impressive. It swallowed everything we threw at it, even when we needed extra space to fit a large box for our puppies’ new dog run; the 50/50-split backseat folded nearly flat to increase the cargo space exponentially.\n\nWhile I generally loved my two weeks in the Panamera GTS, there were a few glaring things missing that I would definitely want in a $135,000 car. The first is keyless access and start. While my test car didn’t have it, there is a Porsche Entry and Drive option that lets you leave the remote in your pocket, but it requires a dummy key that you leave in the ignition and have to turn to start the car. Call me crazy, but keyless push-button start just seems more sleek and modern.\n\nI also would have appreciated ventilated Porsche seats, and I expected them at this price (although I did appreciate the suede seats that helped keep sweaty legs in shorts comfortable, though leather seats are an option for those that prefer it). They’re available on all trim levels for an additional $800 for the front seats.\n\nI also missed having steering-wheel-mounted audio controls, preferring not to take my hand off the wheel every few minutes to indulge my compulsive radio-surfing habit.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Puny\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Groove-On\n\nBEHIND THE WHEEL\nAcceleration in the Panamera GTS is shockingly smooth, with the average driver unable to detect the quick, discreet automatic gearshifts. Braking was also incredibly smooth and responsive; it even kept me from hitting a rogue neighborhood deer when driving home at dusk one evening.\n\nDespite the Porsche Panamera’s 115-inch-long wheelbase, it had a tight 39.2-foot turning diameter, allowing me to pull in and out of the 90-degree turn into my garage every time without having to execute a three-pointer.\n\nThe Panamera’s pleasurable drivability surprised me. The ability to customize the driving experience was great for my family, as my husband still prefers a more sport-oriented “boy racer” feel while I prefer the comfort of a softer ride for my daily mommy duties. We each had the ability to choose our desired powertrain feel by switching among Comfort, Sport and Sport Plus modes, modifying how the seven-speed dual-clutch PDK transmission handles the engine’s output.\n\nWhen the perception of an even more aggressive driving experience is desired, you can push a button in any mode to bypass some chambers in the mufflers and make the Panamera roar to life with a low, guttural growl upon acceleration. My kids often urged me to “push the rocket ship button.”\n\nAnd speaking of customization, with the infinitely adjustable driver’s seat and tilt/telescoping steering wheel, my husband and I were each able to find a comfortable driving position despite nearly a foot of difference in height between us.\n\nI have a confession to make. Up until now, I had yet to meet a Porsche I really liked. I’ve found all the ones I’ve driven to be overly harsh for my taste and somewhat primitive from a features standpoint. The Panamera changes that.\n\nSAFETY\nCrash tests have not been conducted on the 2013 Porsche Panamera. It has standard dual front airbags, a driver’s knee airbag, seat-mounted side-impact airbags for the front and rear occupants, and curtain airbags on both sides. As is required of all new models since the 2012 model year, the Panamera GTS has standard antilock brakes, an electronic stability system and traction control.\n\nThe Porsche Panamera’s unique, almost Audi-esque shape and high beltline cause some rear visibility issues. However, my test car came equipped with optional park assist sensors and a backup camera. While the park assist sensors were a great help, the backup camera only turned on when the radio/nav system was on. From a safety perspective, the rear-view camera should turn on every time you put the car in Reverse, regardless of whether your radio is turned on or not.\n\nMy test car also came equipped with an optional blind spot warning system, which illuminates a light in the side mirror if a vehicle is detected in your blind spot. I relied upon this system completely while changing lanes on the highway, as the Panamera’s low stance and large, fixed head restraints in every seat made it difficult at best to turn and try to glance at my blind spot myself.\n\nFor families installing child-safety seats, the Porsche Panamera has a set of Latch connectors for each of the two rear seats. The lower anchors are easily accessible through open slits in each seat’s bottom cushion. Kids in booster seats will also benefit from the standard large rear bucket seats that cradle a booster seat and hold it in place snugly. The seat belt buckles are flush with the seat bottom, which may make it difficult for younger children to reach between their booster and the bolster to buckle up independently.\n\nSee all the standard safety features listed here.\n\nSend Kristin an email",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in July 2012 about the 2013 Porsche Panamera. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2014, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe 2013 Porsche Panamera might just be the perfect car for the mom or dad wanting prestige, performance and panache, with just enough comfort and functionality thrown in to work as a daily driver.\n\nRather than having a sporty car for fun and a family sedan for function, blend the two in the Panamera GTS and save the extra space in your garage for something else.\n\nThe 2013 Panamera GTS I drove is a newcomer to the model’s lineup. This year, the Panamera is available in five trim levels: the base Panamera, the S, the GTS, the Turbo and the Turbo S. The Panamera and Panamera S come with a choice of rear- or all-wheel drive, while the GTS and the Turbos are exclusively all-wheel drive. Apart from the new GTS, changes between the 2012 and 2013 versions are few (see them compared here).\n\nIn my opinion, the Panamera has no direct competitors, but shoppers are likely to consider it alongside sedans like the BMW 7 Series and the Mercedes-Benz S-Class (see them compared). Because the Panamera’s trim levels range from $76,825 to $176,275 (including a $975 destination charge), it also overlaps the 2012 Maserati Quattroporte and comes within $10,000 of the 2012 Bentley Continental Flying Spur (compare side by side).\n\nIf you like the four-door, performance-luxury, functional-hatchback category, on either end of the Panamera are the 2012 BMW 550 Gran Turismo ($66,895) and the 2012 Aston Martin Rapide ($210,010).\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe Panamera’s long, lean exterior styling is polarizing, to say the least. At least it evokes some type of response, rather than eliciting nothing more than a blank, bored stare. I happen to appreciate its aggressive-looking low stance, blended with muscular hips and a handsome, masculine nose. I gazed and gawked at my test car as I would a marble sculpture of a naked Roman god.\n\nMy husband, on the other hand, couldn’t quite see my point of view on this one. (I wonder why?) One day he’d claim that the Panamera’s unique back end was growing on him, while the next day he was back to disdainful loathing.\n\nOne thing that’s not up for debate is the functionality that distinctive shape lends the Panamera. Because it’s so long, it can have four full-sized doors so rear passengers can easily climb in and out without incredible feats of acrobatic flexibility.\n\nAlso, its larger rear end results in a hatchback cargo space that’s big enough for most tasks a family can throw at it. You’ve got to hand it to the Panamera’s designers for figuring out how to take a functional shape and make it look unique and “automotively” fashion-forward.\n\nFAMILY-FRIENDLY FEATURES\nConsidering the Panamera isn’t built to haul a huge family, it’s surprising how well my family and I adjusted, so long as I left one of my three kiddos out. My oldest daughter just turned 12, so she was quite happy to exercise her independence and stay home while I took the younger two (ages 7 and 9) to the pool for a few hours. The two seats in the back were a good fit for two kids, even in booster seats. The full-size, bolstered seats in the Panamera GTS cradled my girls’ Bubble Bum booster seats perfectly. There was enough legroom in the backseat (33.3 inches) not only for my kids, but also for full-sized adults.\n\nThe center console between the optionally heated rear seats houses two cupholders and a storage bin. There’s also an additional storage area inside the fold-down armrest. The only complaint from the little ones was that the windowsills are quite high, making it tough for them to see out their windows even when lifted up slightly by their booster seats. This might be a problem for kids who are prone to motion sickness.\n\nFrom the driver’s seat, the Panamera GTS looks like a super high-tech jet cockpit. At first glance, all the buttons seem like overkill; however, taking just a couple of minutes to locate the essentials and understand how things were organized clarified things for me.\n\nThere is space for only one true built-in cupholder in the center console up front. Two additional (somewhat flimsy) ones pop out of the dash just above the glove box when needed, but they get in the way of the passenger and could very easily break when someone gets in or out and smacks them with a knee. I would have preferred a second cupholder over the antiquated ashtray and cigarette lighter.\n\nThe Panamera’s cargo space is incredibly impressive. It swallowed everything we threw at it, even when we needed extra space to fit a large box for our puppies’ new dog run; the 50/50-split backseat folded nearly flat to increase the cargo space exponentially.\n\nWhile I generally loved my two weeks in the Panamera GTS, there were a few glaring things missing that I would definitely want in a $135,000 car. The first is keyless access and start. While my test car didn’t have it, there is a Porsche Entry and Drive option that lets you leave the remote in your pocket, but it requires a dummy key that you leave in the ignition and have to turn to start the car. Call me crazy, but keyless push-button start just seems more sleek and modern.\n\nI also would have appreciated ventilated seats, and I expected them at this price (although I did appreciate the suede seats that helped keep sweaty legs in shorts comfortable). They’re available on all trim levels for an additional $800 for the front seats.\n\nI also missed having steering-wheel-mounted audio controls, preferring not to take my hand off the wheel every few minutes to indulge my compulsive radio-surfing habit.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Puny\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Groove-On\n\nBEHIND THE WHEEL\nAcceleration in the Panamera GTS is shockingly smooth, with the average driver unable to detect the quick, discreet automatic gearshifts. Braking was also incredibly smooth and responsive; it even kept me from hitting a rogue neighborhood deer when driving home at dusk one evening.\n\nDespite the Panamera’s 115-inch wheelbase, it had a tight 39.2-foot turning diameter, allowing me to pull in and out of the 90-degree turn into my garage every time without having to execute a three-pointer.\n\nThe Panamera’s pleasurable drivability surprised me. The ability to customize the driving experience was great for my family, as my husband still prefers a “boy racer” feel while I prefer the comfort of a softer ride for my daily mommy duties. We each had the ability to choose our desired feel by switching among Comfort, Sport and Sport Plus modes.\n\nWhen the perception of an even more aggressive driving experience is desired, you can push a button in any mode to bypass some chambers in the mufflers and make the Panamera roar to life with a low, guttural growl upon acceleration. My kids often urged me to “push the rocket ship button.”\n\nAnd speaking of customization, with the infinitely adjustable driver’s seat and tilt/telescoping steering wheel, my husband and I were each able to find a comfortable driving position despite nearly a foot of difference in height between us.\n\nI have a confession to make. Up until now, I had yet to meet a Porsche I really liked. I’ve found all the ones I’ve driven to be overly harsh for my taste and somewhat primitive from a features standpoint. The Panamera changes that.\n\nSAFETY\nCrash tests have not been conducted on the 2013 Porsche Panamera. It has standard dual front airbags, a driver’s knee airbag, seat-mounted side-impact airbags for the front and rear occupants, and curtain airbags on both sides. As is required of all new models since the 2012 model year, the Panamera GTS has standard antilock brakes, an electronic stability system and traction control.\n\nThe Panamera’s unique shape and high beltline cause some rear visibility issues. However, my test car came equipped with optional park assist sensors and a backup camera. While the park assist sensors were a great help, the backup camera only turned on when the radio/nav system was on. From a safety perspective, the backup camera should turn on every time you put the car in Reverse, regardless of whether your radio is turned on or not.\n\nMy test car also came equipped with an optional blind spot warning system, which illuminates a light in the side mirror if a vehicle is detected in your blind spot. I relied upon this system completely while changing lanes on the highway, as the Panamera’s low stance and large, fixed head restraints in every seat made it difficult at best to turn and try to glance at my blind spot myself.\n\nFor families installing child-safety seats, the Panamera has a set of Latch connectors for each of the two rear seats. The lower anchors are easily accessible through open slits in each seat’s bottom cushion. Kids in booster seats will also benefit from the standard large rear bucket seats that cradle a booster seat and hold it in place snugly. The seat belt buckles are flush with the seat bottom, which may make it difficult for younger children to reach between their booster and the bolster to buckle up independently.\n\nSee all the standard safety features listed here.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Porsche just launched a redesigned version of its Panamera luxury performance hatchback, and now it's adding a new Sport Turismo body style that gives the car a more traditional hatchback or wagon shape. The Sport Turismo offers a range of turbocharged drivetrains — including one that transforms the car into a plug-in hybrid — and an adaptive air suspension and all-wheel drive are standard.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe 2018 Panamera Sport Turismo hits dealerships at the end of the year with a starting price of $97,250 for the 4 trim level; $105,050 for the 4 E-Hybrid model; $110,250 for the 4S version; and $155,050 for the top-of-the-line Turbo (all prices include a $1,050 destination charge).\n\nExterior\nPorsche says the Sport Turismo has unique styling from the B-pillars back. The roofline is higher, which leads to larger side windows in back, and the rearmost roof pillar is more upright. It’s still forward-swept, though, which gives the design some additional athleticism.\n \nA multiposition roof spoiler can provide more downforce as needed and is also used to minimize wind noise when the panoramic roof is open. Wheels as large as 21 inches in diameter are available.\n \nInterior\nThe Panamera has been a four-seat car since its debut, but the Sport Turismo has room for up to five people with its three-person 40/20/40-split rear seat. Choosing the optional power-adjustable rear seats returns it to a four-seat configuration.\n \nThe Sport Turismo’s liftover height is only about two feet from the ground, so you don’t have to lift luggage that high when loading it. The cargo area measures 18.4 cubic feet, and with the rear seats folded, maximum cargo volume is 49 cubic feet. A cargo area management system with two rails in the floor and four tie-down points is optional.\n \nUnder the Hood\nThe Sport Turismo shares its engines with the regular Panamera. The base engine is a 330-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 while the 4S gets a 440-hp, twin-turbo 2.9-liter V-6 that accelerates the car from zero-to-60 mph in 4 seconds — 1 second quicker than the base engine. The 4 E-Hybrid also uses the 2.9-liter V-6 and gains an electric motor, while the Turbo features a 550-hp, twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8 that can rocket it to 60 mph in just 3.4 seconds.",
