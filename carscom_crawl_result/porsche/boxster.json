      "expert_review": "I have a thirtysomething accountant friend who is a very hip and style-conscious person. She loves the Boxster. One of my fortysomething supervisors, who is raising a teenage son and who shoulders a heavy load in her job, is a bit more conservative. She loves the Boxster. I have a teenage neighbor who is seriously into high-performance Japanese motorcycles and fast American cars. He loves the Boxster. Then there’s Fred, my portly dachshund. He is naturally drawn to German cars, especially ones where he can put his nose out the passenger-side window. And even he loves the Boxster. Now that I have had a chance to drive the Boxster, you can count me in too. I love the Boxster.\n\nIn fact, who doesn’t?\n\nThe line of buyers waiting for Porsche to build them a Boxster stretches into next year. Porsche factories are working overtime to meet the surging worldwide demand for the new sports car.\n\nAfter having recently test-driven the mighty Jaguar XK8, the BMW Z3 2.8 and the Mercedes-Benz SLK, I can report than none delivered the pulse-increasing excitement and sheer fun of the Boxster.\n\nPorsche got every aspect of this car right. From the way it sounds to the way it looks to the way it is priced, the Boxster is a winner.\n\nPERFORMANCE, HANDLING\n\nThe Boxster is powered by a 2.5-liter, horizontally opposed ”boxer” engine. This is the first Porsche six-cylinder engine that sports double-overhead cams, 24-valves and water cooling. Horsepower is rated at 201.\n\nBuyers can choose between a five-speed manual and the optional five-speed ”tiptronic” automatic transmission. The tiptronic feature lets you shift the automatic electronically. It adds a hefty $3,150 to the price tag. Our silver test car came with the tiptronic transmission, not an option that I would buy.\n\nThe Boxster’s powerful rear-mounted engine makes an otherworldly sound, as if it were powered by plutonium or some other exotic fuel. As you rev it up, a sort of whirring turbine-like whooshing engulfs you and makes your heart race. If you love the finely tuned mechanical noises of a high-performance engine, you’ll drive the Boxster like I did most of the time: with the radio off.\n\nThe engine idles with just a hint of impatience. When you rev it up, it smooths out considerably. Regardless of what speed you drive, there is instant power under your right foot. Acceleration comes on strong and fast. Porsche says the Boxster will go from 0-to-60 mph in 6.7 seconds, which is about a half-second slower than the BMW Z3 2.8 and equal to the Mercedes-Benz SLK, the other two high-profile German sports cars that are new this year.\n\nSpeed isn’t everything. Style counts too – especially in a sports car. While the classy Boxster is a shade slower to 60 mph than the BMW (and half a dozen other sports cars), I’m convinced you won’t have more fun, attract more looks or enjoy the trip more in a Corvette, Cobra, Camaro, Supra or anything else.\n\nThere is no other sensation I know of that is equal to the sound and fury of the Boxster’s engine winding up and shifting through the gears. When the tachometer needle reaches about 6,300 rpm, the engine sounds like an Indy race car.\n\nThe tiptronic transmission functions as sort of an electrically shifted manual gearbox. It works OK, but I would never consider owning any true sports car with anything other than a real manual transmission. In addition to being the most efficient way to get the horsepower to the wheels, a manual gearbox lets the driver exert more control over the car. Two buttons on the steering wheel allow you to shift the tiptronic transmission up or down when you wish. Or you can leave it on the automatic mode, where it will shift for you. In the morning before the engine warmed up, I found the automatic shifts somewhat rough. I didn’t use the tiptronic mode much; it seemed too gimmicky.\n\nThe Boxster has a true sports car feel. The four-whee l independent suspension system provides a quiet ride that does a credible job of absorbing bumps. The Boxster is a sports car that uses parts made for a sports car, unlike the Mercedes and BMW, which use parts plucked from sedans and coupes. The power-assisted four-wheel anti-lock disc brakes are industrial strength, and the rack-and-pinion steering is tight and responsive.\n\nOur test car averaged 24 mpg in combined city/highway driving.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nThe Boxster’s retro styling makes the car an instant classic.\n\nThat curvaceous body is at once new and familiar. We’ve seen some variation of those downward sloping, inner curving fenders used for years on the Porsche 911. Those with long memories might recognize a trace of ’50s Porsches in the Boxster’s hindquarters. The shape of the stylized headlights, taillights, wheels and single exhaust tip gives the Boxster its own personality.\n\nThere is not one thing about the Boxster’s shape that I would change. It’s a styling and design masterpiece, a car that captures Porsche’s rich history while at the same time conveying up to the minute styling and technology.\n\nWith its smooth curves and sealed underbody – in which no parts are exposed – the Boxster slices through the air with extreme efficiency. At speeds of 75 mph or greater, a rear spoiler automatically extends from the lip of the trunk. The spoiler uses the passing air to press down on the rear of the car for better traction.\n\nFor an added measure of safety, the Boxster is equipped with built-in rollbars behind the seat. Dual air bags are standard.\n\nThe view from the driver’s seat is good. Even though the Boxster’s nose slopes downward, you easily can judge the distance between the front of the car and curbs when you park.\n\nThe firm leather-covered bucket seats are comfortable but a bit narrow. The Boxster likely will be a tight fit for people who weigh more than 250 pounds. The seats cradle your midsection and hold you firmly in tight corners.\n\nThe cloth convertible top is easy to operate. All you do is unfasten the latch and press a button. It takes 12 seconds for the top to drop into a well behind the rear seats, where it is stored out of sight.\n\nFor a two-seat sports car, the Boxster offers plenty of cargo room. There is a deep well in the front of the car just ahead of the spare tire that probably could hold two medium-sized bags. In the rear of the car there is another storage area big enough for another bag.\n\nThe engine is buried in the middle of the car. You add oil and coolant from the rear compartment.\n\nOur test car had a full array of power accessories – everything except cruise control. The air conditioner is a computerized affair that works well – once the car is moving. It was a little slow to cool the car on warm days when first starting out.\n\nThere were a few things I didn’t care for. The panel that holds the switch for the electric mirrors w as loose, and the instrument panel, though nicely shaped, seemed like it had just been stuck on the dash. It even moved slightly when I pressed against it.\n\nThe Boxster is available with an optional hardtop, but it doesn’t add anything to the car’s looks. I like it just the way it comes at $39,980 plus tax.\n\nBecause of heavy demand, you may have to wait awhile to get a Boxster – unless you want to pay thousands more to have one now. The Boxster is a great car for $40,000, but it’s not worth $50,000.\n\nPorsche is working to meet heavy demand by increasing production and by hiring an outside firm to assemble the cars. By late next year, demand should be brought in line with production, and you shouldn’t have to pay over sticker.\n\nAfter I took my hip, style-conscious accountant friend for a ride, we started scheming to find (legal) ways to come up with $40,000. I was thinking that if you drive something that’s worth $10,000 and save another $10,000, you could financ e the other $20,000 for five years and the payments would be about equal to the amount you would pay each month for a regular family sedan.\n\nSuch a plan would require patience and discipline. I want the Boxster now. So I’ve decided to approach the boss, try some inspired begging and plead for a triple-digit raise.\n\nAs for my friend, she made a beeline for the nearest lottery machine.\n\nThe Boxster is a car that, once you drive it, you are spoiled, and you don’t want to stop.\n\nSpecifications:\n\n1997 Porsche Boxster Base price: $39,980. Safety: Dual air bags, anti-lock brakes, side-impact protection and front and rear crumple zones. Price as tested: $45,134. EPA rating: 17 mpg city/26 mpg highway. Incentives: None.\n\nTruett’s tip: By any standard of measurement, the Boxster is a terrific sports car. Boxster’s performance, handling, styling, value, generous level of equipment and quality make this low-slung roadster a tremendous automobile.",

      "expert_review": "On life’s automotive menu, I’ll always think of the 2005 Porsche Boxster S convertible as the New York strip steak. Stick with me here; it’s going to make perfect sense.\n\nWhen was the last time you were in a fancy restaurant and nearly gagged when you saw the filet mignon listed at $50? Although that is a prime cut of meat and perhaps exquisitely prepared, many of us simply cannot stand the thought of dropping half-a-hundred on a six-ounce portion of food.\n\nAnd then you spot the New York strip steak for $30 – a comparative bargain, yet still providing a filling, delicious experience for the veteran steak eater. So it is with the Boxster S. It’s not a $90,000 Porsche 911 Carrera S Cabriolet or a $440,000 Porsche Carrera GT. Yet, you still get much of Porsche experience behind the wheel of a Boxster S with a starting price of $53,100.\n\nAnd that experience includes whiplash acceleration, monorail-like handling and the option of blissful open-air motoring on warm Northern California days.\n\nThe Boxster S in my hands for a week listed at around $61,500, most of the extra cost ($3,200) wrapped up in Porsche’s technologically wondrous Tiptronic S transmission. The German automaker pioneered clutchless manual shifting. In its current evolvement, it’s a marvel.\n\nThe Tiptronic S gearbox can function as a basic five-speed automatic, which will rip you around with plentiful authority because it is hooked up to a 280-horsepower, flat-6 engine driving rear wheels and only about 3,000 pounds of hardware.\n\nBut snap the center console-positioned shifter one click to the left, and you are in manual mode with no clutch to dance upon. Now, you can zip up and down the gears via buttons on the steering wheel, feeling every bit like a world-class race car driver.\n\nResponse from the engine is dramatic. Accelerations are not firm run-ups but see-you-later blasts. Thankfully, heavyweight disc brakes at all four corners can tame the Boxster’s energy in an instant.\n\nGiven what the engine puts out, the Boxster S is equipped with a seriously sport-tuned suspension. The good news is that it holds the car in a rock-solid grip on hard corners taken at high speed. The bad news is that you feel every single highway imperfection in your spine.\n\nPotholes and speed bumps are to be feared in the Boxster S. And for this reason, some passengers and drivers don’t like it. Those who do like it accept the bumps and love the handling. It’s a sports-car thing.\n\nHow does it look? Like a $100,000 piece of machinery. No Mercedes, no Lotus, no Bentley drew as many stares as the tested Boxster S. Paint a number of the sleek, low-riding droptop, and most would figure it for purpose-built racer.\n\nNaturally, there are some drawbacks to this styling.\n\nI thought folding my 6-foot-4-inch frame into the cockpit was a problem, but it was no worse than passengers who settled on falling backward into the right-front seat after several failed attempts to dive in nose-first.\n\nTaking a long trip in the Boxster S? Better pack light. There’s 5 cubic feet in the front and 4.6 cubic feet in the back of the mid-engine car. Think overnight bag and a briefcase.\n\nThat mid-engine configuration also takes some getting used to. The rumble from the power plant massages your thighs much of the time, and engine fluids are added via receptacles in the back under the trunklid.\n\nOne surprise was rear vision, which I expected to be terrible. It’s not, thanks to a clever, nearly trapezoidal configuration in the convertible’s rear window. A glance in the rearview mirror offers a perfectly aimed, clear view of what’s going on behind the Boxster’s exhausts.\n\nBlind spots on the side are another story. Look carefully before changing lanes – and make sure fellow motorists can see you. At only 51 inches high, it’s easy for a fast-moving Boxster S to get lost in a sea of high-riding vehicles.\n\nAll in all, this most-impractical of cars is a very enjoyable, horsepower-laden toy within the reach of budgets that might not otherwise allow even a second’s consideration of a Porsche.\n\nIt’s not rare, but it’s certainly well-done.\n\nPorsche Boxster at a glance Make/model: 2005 Porsche Boxster S. Vehicle type: Two-passenger, mid-engine, rear-drive, two-door convertible.\n\nBase price: $53,100 (as tested, $61,480).\n\nEngine: 3.2-liter flat-6 with 280 horsepower at 6,200 revolutions per minute and 236 foot-pounds of torque at 4,700 rpm.\n\nEPA fuel economy: 18 miles per gallon city; 26 mpg highway.\n\nTransmission: Five-speed Tiptronic S with overdrive and clutchless manual-shifting feature.\n\nBrakes: Power four-wheel, vented discs with anti-lock and other braking-enhancement features.\n\nSuspension type: Independent, MacPherson strut-type with gas-pressure shock absorbers front and rear.\n\nCargo volume: 5 cubic feet in front; 4.6 cubic feet in rear.\n\nFuel tank: 16.9 gallons.\n\nCurb weight: 3,053 pounds.\n\nFront track: 58.5 inches.\n\nRear track: 60.2 inches.\n\nHeight: 51 inches.\n\nLength: 171.6 inches.\n\nWidth: 70.9 inches.\n\nFinal assembly point: Uusikaupunki, Finland.\n\nThe Bee’s Mark Glover can be reached at (916) 321-1184 or mglover@sacbee.com.",

      "expert_review": "The Boxster is Porsche’s most affordable model, and possibly its most fun. Unlike most convertibles, the two-seat Boxster came out years before its coupe sister model, the Cayman, and it’s priced lower. What the two share is a class-exclusive mid-engine design that puts the six-cylinder, horizontally opposed engine behind the seats — and puts excellent dynamics in the hands of the driver. “Boxster” is a contraction of “boxer,” another name for a horizontally opposed engine, and “roadster,” which means two-seat convertible. “Cayman” is an archipelago in the Caribbean; I have no clue why they chose that.\n\nThe Boxster was upgraded for 2009 (compare it with the 2008 version here) with more power, better mileage and revised suspensions, but it thankfully hasn’t lost its soul in everyday driving — as have some cars designed for the high speeds of Germany’s autobahn that we Americans seldom see. Though loads of options bloated its out-the-door price, my test Boxster S, the more powerful trim level, exhibited the same performance you’d get with standard features for $56,700.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe Porsche Boxster remains a soft-top convertible rather than a retractable hardtop, and for good reason. For one thing, soft-tops weigh less, and that’s important in a small sport roadster like the Boxster. The only comparable model that offers a choice of convertible tops is the Mazda MX-5 Miata, and it weighs 82 pounds — or 3.3 percent — more as a retractable hardtop than it does as a soft-top.\n\nThe Boxster notably weighs a mere 11 pounds more than the Cayman coupe (that’s less than four-tenths of a percent). That’s a testament to the car’s inherent rigidity; convertible versions of coupes usually require added structural reinforcement to keep them sturdy, which adds weight.\n\nWhen folded, soft-tops take up less room than retractable hardtops, which usually store their roof panels in the trunk. As a mid-engine car, the Porsche Boxster isn’t long on space behind the seats anyway, so I doubt the model will ever follow the hard-top trend. Truth be told, the raised roof gives the Boxster a pretty nice line, and some retractable hardtops are just plain weird-looking when all “couped-up.”\n\nOne thing I like about the Boxster’s standard powered top is its willingness to open or close when the car is in motion. Nowadays, most powered tops — and especially retractable hardtops — refuse to move unless you’re stopped or, at best, moving less than a few mph. In the Boxster, you can start the top in motion when you pull into a parking lot, and by the time you’re parked and turn the engine off, the roof is up. Of course, whether the car allows it or not, it’s never wise to do this when moving at higher speeds, or the wind will remove your top — permanently.\n\nA minor restyling for 2010 has added a small center vent low on the front bumper, flanked by more shapely intakes that incorporate LED daytime running lights. In the regular Boxster, the vents’ cross-bars are body-colored, and they’re black on the S trim level. The Boxster’s headlight clusters extend farther up the fenders.\n\nRide & Handling\nThe Porsche Boxster and its Cayman counterpart deliver handling like no other cars — not necessarily superior in terms of roadholding, but with loads of imminently controllable fun. At a maximum curb weight of 3,042 pounds (in the S trim with an automatic transmission), the Boxster is reasonably light for a rigid German car — and it feels that way. The Boxster’s roughly 45/55 (front/rear) weight distribution calls into question the conventional notion that a 50/50 split is perfect. The car’s rear end is happy to come around under heavy throttle, and it’s just as willing to pop back in line. There’s something about having the engine’s mass fully between the front and rear axles that defies the presumed imbalance and connects the driver to the car’s dynamic center. You sit in the seat of power — directly in front of the car’s pulsating, six-chambered heart.\n\nOverall, the Porsche Boxster S is best appreciated in high-speed driving, especially on a track, because the steering is firm at lower speeds, and the hard brake pedal offers more fine control when it’s shaving off mph by 20s and 30s rather than 5s and 10s. Thankfully, its high-speed capabilities don’t make it as prim in normal driving as the Porsche 911. The Boxster still hasn’t fallen prey to the vast conspiracy to make sports cars more capable at the expense of fun. So it has been since the car made its 1997 debut.\n\nThe Boxster comes with an electronic stability system that Porsche calls PSM, Porsche Stability Management. Complicating matters, the adaptive suspension option is called PASM — Porsche Active Suspension Management, which my car had. Even with PASM set for its comfort mode, the Boxster S’ ride quality is firmer than you’ll find in, say, the BMW Z4.\n\nThe firmer suspension mode wasn’t particularly comfortable on city streets, but it seems to make a real difference in performance driving; it doesn’t exist solely to impress you by becoming outrageously firm. Regardless of which mode you choose, the real advantage is in PASM’s computerized ability to read wheel and body motions and pattern the shock absorber firmness appropriately.\n\nThe Seat of Power\nThe Boxster’s horizontally opposed, flat-six cylinder engines became more powerful for 2009. The regular Boxster’s 2.7-liter grew to 2.9 liters, and its 245 horsepower bumped up to 255. The 3.4-liter in my Porsche Boxster S test car generates 310 hp, up from 295 hp in the 2008. As the table shows, despite the higher output, combined mileage while running on required premium gas has improved by 1 to 3 mpg, depending on the transmission.\n\nPorsche Boxster Engines\n \t2008 Boxster base\t2009 Boxster base\t2008 Boxster S\t2009 Boxster S\nEngine\t2.7-liter H-6\t2.9-liter H-6\t3.4-liter H-6\t3.4-liter H-6\nHorsepower (@ rpm)\t245 @ 6,500 rpm\t255 @ 6,400 rpm\t295 @ 6,250 rpm\t310 @ 6,400 rpm\nTorque (lbs.-ft. @ rpm)\t201 @ 4,600 rpm\t214 @ 4,400 rpm\t251 @ 4,400 rpm\t266 @ 4,400 rpm\nCity/highway – combined mpg\n(manual; automatic)\t19/28 – 22*; 19/26 – 21\t19/27 – 22; 20/29 – 24\t18/26 – 21; 18/25 – 21\t19/26 – 22; 20/29 – 23\n*Six-speed manual; standard five-speed (discontinued for 2009) is 20/29 – 23 mpg.\nSource: Manufacturer, EPA\n\nWhen a car’s power and efficiency both increase, it usually means one thing: direct injection, and that’s the technology that’s been added to the engines. They’re aided by the new seven-speed, dual-clutch automated manual called PDK — for Porsche Doppelkupplungsgetriebe. (I’m going to stick with “PDK.”) Similar to transmissions from the likes of BMW, Mitsubishi, Volkswagen/Audi and others, PDK connects to the engine’s crankshaft by means of two different clutches — one for odd gears and one for even gears, resulting in practically instantaneous handoffs from one gear to the next. Sorry, stick shift fans, but the PDK shifts a tenth of a second faster than you can, resulting in zero-to-60 sprints of 5.5 seconds in the regular Boxster and 4.9 seconds in the S, according to Porsche.\n\nThe engines remain normally aspirated, so they don’t see the torque boost we’ve come to expect from turbocharged direct-injection engines, but having seven forward speeds made my Boxster S’ relatively lean low-rev torque a non-issue. The tach needle scales quickly to redline.\n\nAs far as shift speed goes, PDK has it down: While most transmissions of this type upshift faster than a congressman changes positions, they don’t all downshift very quickly. PDK does, as is best illustrated when shifting manually using the steering-wheel buttons — which I hesitate to call paddles, because they’re really not. They’re oddly shaped push-pull buttons that protrude upward from the spokes just inboard of the wheel. We can argue whether the shifter buttons should be push/pull for upshift/downshift or the Formula One style, which is left-side downshift and right-side upshift. We can also debate if they should be on the wheel itself or on the steering column. But you can’t argue that these buttons are ergonomic; pushing them sideways with your thumb just ain’t right. I preferred to use the shifter lever itself, which you pop to the left into a separate up/down shift gate.\n\nFully automatic modes include Drive and Sport, the latter of which is summoned using a Sport button in front of the gear selector. Both programs feel pretty natural, but they exhibit a slight lurch from a standing start — common with this kind of transmission — and you feel the successive downshifts even in the regular Drive mode as you coast to a stop. Sport makes the electronic throttle more sensitive, keeps the transmission in lower gears for a given speed, and makes the transmission more likely to kick down when you tap the accelerator.\n\nMy problem with PDK is that the regular and Sport modes are too far apart. I often thought Drive wasn’t quite responsive enough, but when you hit the Sport button, you get the herky-jerky combination of lower gears and a more sensitive throttle. I need a middle ground.\n\nThere’s a lot to be said for dual-clutch automated manuals, especially because they’re more efficient, but once the hype dies down driving enthusiasts will recognize that they’re just as soulless as the automatics they replace. The emotional connection of operating a clutch pedal and stick will always be there — and in the Boxster it saves you the PDK’s whopping $3,420 price tag.\n\nThe Power Seat\nYou sit pretty low in the Boxster, and the wind wraps around you quite well. My car had the optional polycarbonate “windstop” deflector between the head restraints, which minimized wind buffeting from behind. One annoyance that hasn’t changed for 2009 is the sound of the cooling fan on the right flank when driving with the top down. Because the engine is behind the seats, the radiator is, too, so an electric fan blows its cooling air through the vent just behind the door on the right side, roughly in line with occupants’ heads. You might not notice it, though, unless you pass other cars, barriers or other objects that can reflect sound. On the upside, it didn’t turn on as much during our cool summer days as the previous generation’s did last time I tested it.\n\nOtherwise, the car is reasonably quiet — not as quiet as a retractable hardtop, but better than the days of the single-layer ragtop. The Boxster does, however, have the telltale over-the-shoulder noise that always seems to seep in along the rear pillars and window in ragtops.\n\nVisibility isn’t bad, partly because the car rides low and virtually everything else on the road is taller. On the downside, soft-tops usually have wider rear roof pillars (or cloth pillar equivalents) than retractable hardtops, and that’s the case here.\n\nThe glove compartment is decent in size, but there’s little else to speak of. The center armrest raises to reveal a tray deep enough for coins and some iPods, though my ancient Mini wouldn’t fit with the belt clip attached. The Boxster makes up for it with its two trunks. The one in back seems a tad small, but still reasonable for this class, though the front one is remarkably deep: I had a standard carry-on, rolling suitcase standing upright, but it was just tall enough that I was concerned I’d bend the hood if I closed it. The bag fit easily widthwise, though, and it looked like another would have fit on top of it. Golf clubs need not apply unless the passenger seat is empty.\n\nWhat You’re Paying For\nWhen you buy a Porsche, your money is going to two main things: performance specs and the cachet of the brand name — the latter of which having a value only you can quantify. This becomes pretty clear when you look at the interior quality — and/or the options list. The Porsche Boxster S’ cabin quality is by no means bad overall, but there are some aspects you don’t want to see in a car priced at $56,700. My main problem is the silvery plastic. That’s a common gripe of mine, but it’s especially egregious here because it appears extensively on so-called touch points — meaning things you touch, like the inside door handles and the steering wheel’s PDK shift buttons, which come complete with rough seam edges from the plastic molds. Serious bush-league stuff.\n\nAnother example is the plastic trim piece you push to get at the outrageously flimsy cupholders, both of which emerge from the dashboard in front of the passenger.\n\nThe Boxster did receive some interior upgrades for 2009, including an updated Porsche Communication Management option that controls the audio, communication and navigation systems — a badly needed upgrade that brings a 6.5-inch touch-screen interface. A USB jack for controlling iPods and playing music from flash drives is also available. Here’s the problem: The 2009 improvements come largely in the form of options. In fact, most of the Boxster’s features come in the form of options, including simple stuff like heated seats, automatic climate control and the USB jack.\n\nOur Porsche Boxster S was crammed with options — including some as exotic as heated, eight-way adjustable power seats ($2,050); bi-xenon headlights ($1,560); and a premium stereo ($990) — plus such chart-toppers as Natural Leather Cocoa leather interior ($2,815), PCM with navigation/communication ($3,110) and PASM ($1,990). In the end, the price was $78,795 with the destination charge. Yowsa.\n\nSafety\nAs a relatively low-volume convertible, the Boxster hasn’t been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. In addition to frontal airbags, the Boxster has side-impact torso airbags in the seat backrests, and it’s one of the first and only convertibles with head-protection airbags that deploy upward from the doors. Antilock brakes and the electronic stability system are standard. You can see the full list of safety features here.\n\nBoxster in the Market\nSome base-model cars are price leaders, but they’re so stripped-down you wouldn’t want them. Fortunately, most of what makes a Boxster what it is — an incomparable, fun roadster bearing the respected Porsche badge — can be had for the base model’s entry price. With the exception of a few low-quality materials inside, most of what you might want is available if you’re willing to pay extra. Porsche wisely makes almost all its options available a la carte rather than packaging them, so you can pick and choose, paying only for what you want, like alloy wheels or trim finishes. Porsche isn’t alone in its modest standard-features list — especially among German brands — and it has something others don’t: a mid-engine design and the performance that comes with it. In the automotive market, exclusivity is always a good thing … well, almost always.\n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "When a premium manufacturer introduces an entry-level model, that manufacturer is taking a big gamble. If the new model doesn’t work, it dilutes the brand. If it works too well, it steals sales from the pricier products.\n\nArguably one of the best examples of how to do it right is the Porsche Boxster, introduced for 1997. Porsche, after all, had some previous experience in doing it wrong: The bar-of-soap-shaped 914 set no sales records, and later, the attractive but troublesome 924 sold well enough but soured lots of buyers on the brand.\n\nNo such problems with the Boxster. It looked right, drove right, and with a base price of $39,995, it was priced right. In the end, the Boxster introduced a lot of customers to the brand, and plenty of those customers traded up to the Porsche 911. Even now, there are plenty of decent 1997 Boxsters available out there in the $15,000 range, which isn’t bad so long as buyers are aware that no Porsche, ever, has been cheap to repair.\n\nSo where does that leave the Boxster now? Pretty much where it was in 1997. Base price is $45,600, cheap considering that this new Boxster has a bigger, more powerful engine than the original (a 2.7-liter, 245-horsepower six-cylinder, compared with the original 2.5-liter, 201-horsepower six), and lots more safety equipment, including six air bags and the Porsche Stability Management system, which is their version of electronic stability control. At that base price — assuming you can find one for that — it’s a bargain.\n\nThe test car had some options but wasn’t overloaded: Larger 18-inch wheels and tires, compared with the standard 17-inchers, plus a few other features raised the list price to $49,515, including shipping.\n\nThere are, however, opportunities to pay a lot more for a Boxster. Available options include a sport package that adds active suspension and a six-speed manual transmission, replacing the standard five-speed manual, plus there are various trim, paint, sound and interior options that can raise the price of the previously affordable Boxster to near-stratospheric levels. If you want an automatic transmission, the Porsche Tiptronic is among the best, but it’s pricey, too.\n\nI never felt I was lacking for anything in the test car, though: The standard sound system was fine, the base leather-trimmed bucket seats comfortable and supportive, the five-speed manual transmission nicely spaced and easy to shift. The larger tires and wheels likely helped handling, which was typically Porsche — crisp, precise, but with a ride that was entirely tolerable. If you need to go faster, there’s the Boxster S, which — for an additional $10,000 or so — gives you the six-speed manual transmission and bigger tires and wheels standard, and bumps horsepower from 245 to 295. I’ve always liked the Boxster S better, but if I was buying a Boxster, I’d have to think hard whether I like it that much better.\n\nInside, the Boxster cockpit is snug but roomy enough for long trips. With the top up, there’s a fair amount of outside noise coming in, but it isn’t objectionable as long as you understand that this is, after all, a sports car. There’s almost 10 cubic feet of luggage space in the front and rear trunks, but very little in the cockpit itself.\n\nIt takes a few minutes to get used to the ultra-light front end, and the longstanding Porsche quirk of placing the ignition on the left side of the steering wheel, but that’s part of the charm. Otherwise, this is an easy car to drive.\n\nThe Boxster was mildly restyled in 2005 and has not changed much since. What has changed is the competition within the brand, as the Porsche Cayman — essentially a hardtop version of the Boxster — is awfully appealing on its own. The Cayman, like the Boxster, is offered in base and S models, with the same engines and horsepower ratings. The Cayman starts at $49,400, but given its appearance — it really looks a lot like a top-of-the-line 911 — you would think it costs more. After all, the cheapest 911 starts at more than $72,000.\n\nFor my money — as if I had that much money — the base Boxster, just as it has for the past decade, offers the most bang for the buck in the Porsche model mix. But I wouldn’t try to talk you out of a Cayman or a 911.",

      "expert_review": "There aren’t many luxury roadsters on the market. Besides Mercedes’ SLK, Audi’s TT and BMW’s Z4, the Porsche Boxster (and Porsche Boxster S) has no other competition. That didn’t stop the famed sports-car maker from delivering a well-executed redesign for the 2013 model year that should woo every shopper that comes its way.\n\nYou can compare the 2012 and 2013 models here.\n\nThe redesigned 2013 Porsche Boxster impresses visually inside and out and handles superbly. The base model could use more power; otherwise, there were few faults to be found.\n\nPerformance\nThe one thing the Boxster does best is handling.\n\nThe Porsche Boxster has long been known for its mid-engine design, allowing for nearly perfect weight balance, and that remains in the new generation. The body is as wide as in previous generation, but the front and rear tracks have been widened marginally for 2013 to keep the tires flush. With the optional 20-inch wheels and tires on my tester, the car felt like it was clawing the road. Every twist and turn was whip-snap short and confidence-inspiring.\n\nThe combination of that handling with a natural seating position, droptop visibility and friendly six-speed manual transmission made me feel one with the car on the first drive out of the driveway.\n\nPorsche’s PDK dual-clutch seven-speed automatic transmission is a $3,200 option, but I found the base six-speed manual to be well-executed. The clutch wasn’t too heavy, yet required enough force to make you pay attention to your shifts. The shifter itself fell into its gates with little effort and even less guessing. How could anybody buy this little gem of handling beauty with a PDK instead of a manual?\n\nPower from the Porsche Boxster base model’s 2.7-liter, flat 6-cylinder engine was adequate for me. I had fun revving through most gears; only 6th disappointed me at highway speeds. There I had to downshift to get true passing power in most situations. The 265 horses weren’t enough to please many of our editors, though, who would prefer the Boxster S and its 315-horsepower, 3.4-liter flat six.\n\nOur test car was equipped with an optional sport suspension for $1,790 that let us choose between Normal and Sport driving modes. It worked, that was clear. Suspension settings firmed up significantly when Sport was chosen, and turns somehow became even sharper. Ride height overall is .39 inch lower in Porsche Boxsters equipped with the sport suspension. If you’re on the fence about getting it, I drove in Normal mode most of the time and still found the car to be a thrilling handler. Our tester also had Porsche’s Torque Vectoring System, which is a $1,320 option. It adjusts torque to the rear wheels by braking to improve handling and traction, but it was hard to determine what the technology was doing, both in everyday and in spirited driving. Braking overall was quite good, but not something that stood out to me.\n\nConvertible Performance\nUnlike the retractable hardtops on the SLK and Z4, the Boxster and Boxster S have a retractable soft-top. Because there’s no additional operation needed to fold it up, like the hardtops require, it closes and opens in nine seconds. I measured it a number of times, and the worst attempt just hit 10 seconds. That means you can close it easily at stoplights, or even when traveling at slow speeds.\n\nWith the top up, visibility is pretty poor if not downright lousy. I had a hard time backing out of parking spaces and judging blind spots on the highway. The small side mirrors didn’t help matters.\n\nOn the road, wind intrudes significantly right around 65 mph. Under that speed, you can cruise to your heart’s content while still maintaining a conversation with your passenger.\n\nWith the top up, the cabin is incredibly quiet. Retractable hardtops came into favor because they isolated passengers from exterior noise more than soft-tops of the time did. But judging by the new batch of soft-tops — from affordable convertibles like Chevy’s Camaro to the Porsche Boxster — the technology has improved greatly. The quiet cabin made me glad Porsche didn’t negatively impact the Boxster’s optimum performance by adding a heavy hardtop.\n\nInterior\nThe last generation of Porsche Boxster was also a good performer, but it was definitely not a stunner to look at, inside or out. While the 2013 gets a swoopy exterior with a backside unlike any other car on the road, the inside has been retrofitted even more significantly.\n\nThe rear-engine Boxster now carries over the layout from Porsche’s 911, Panamera and Cayenne, with a long center console housing the shifter and various buttons leading up into a large multimedia touch-screen.\n\nThe materials and controls feel nearly as nice as the ones in the new 911 Cabriolet I tested the week previous to the Porsche Boxster. There isn’t as much high-grade leather covering areas like the dash and doors as there is in the Porsche 911, but at least now the interior is truly luxurious. I find it hard to imagine shoppers would pick a competitor because it had nicer digs.\n\nMy test car had the optional 14-way adjustable, full-leather seats. Two-way seats covered partially in leather are standard. I can only speak to the ones in my car, which I found supportive, comfortable and downright tailor-fit. There was plenty of bolstering during hard corners, and they had adjustable thigh support — a feature I find quite welcome when equipped.\n\nThe two trunks — a 5.3-cubic-foot-deep well up front and a flatter, wider, golf-bag-accommodating 4.6 cubic feet in back — seemed almost spacious, but there’s little to no storage inside the cabin. Each door has a small pocket and there’s a tiny cubby between the seats and the glove box. There’s no place to easily stash a smartphone, garage-door opener or even money for tolls or drive-throughs.\n\nAnd don’t even get me started on the cupholders, which remain awkwardly hidden above the glove box. If BMW can finally figure out how to please American drivers with conventionally placed cupholders across its lineup, it’s time for Porsche to join the party. The only thing these cupholders can adequately grasp are water bottles with some flex in the plastic. Otherwise, you’ll just worry they’ll pinch the drink container and spill some of its contents — or that they’ll fall out completely during a turn or stop, ruining that nice interior.\n\nFeatures & Price\nLike all Porsches — and a few other German makes — the Boxster comes modestly equipped at its $50,000 base price, with oodles of options with additional price tags attached. Equipped with a variety of options, our tester came to $75,000, pushing it far out of the realm of affordable luxury. Looking at the option list, I could slash the torque vectoring and maybe the convenience package, saving well over $5,000, but could I say no to the gorgeous 20-inch alloy wheels ($3,125) and the black paint job on them to match the canvas top (another $1,425)?\n\nHard to say. If you’re considering a Porsche Boxster, keep in mind that you’re going to need at least $60,000 to get one with just a few features, like a multimedia system and leather seats — items that are pretty much expected in this type of car.\n\nSafety\nThe Boxster and Porsche Boxster S have not been crash-tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.\n\nThere are two separate side airbags for both occupants. The thorax side airbag inflates from the seats’ outside bolster, while side airbags also deploy from the top of the door, for head protection. As is required of all new cars as of the 2012 model year, the Boxster has antilock brakes and an electronic stability system with traction control.\n\nBoxster in the Market\nA luxury roadster probably isn’t something you normally think of cross-shopping; people who buy from Audi, BMW or Mercedes are likely already fans of the brand. The Porsche Boxster, however, should stand out because, well, it’s a Porsche. If you’re going to spend this kind of money on a roadster, it’s a sound move to go with a company that builds well-balanced sports cars.\n\nSend David an email",

It worked, that was clear. Suspension settings firmed up significantly when Sport was chosen, and turns somehow became even sharper. Ride height overall is .39 inch lower in Boxsters equipped with the sport suspension. If you’re on the fence about getting it, I drove in Normal mode most of the time and still found the car to be a thrilling handler. Our tester also had Porsche’s Torque Vectoring System, which is a $1,320 option. It adjusts torque to the rear wheels by braking to improve handling and traction, but it was hard to determine what the technology was doing, both in everyday and in spirited driving. Braking overall was quite good, but not something that stood out to me.\n\nConvertible Performance\nUnlike the retractable hardtops on the SLK and Z4, the Boxster has a retractable soft-top. Because there’s no additional operation needed to fold it up, like the hardtops require, it closes and opens in nine seconds. I measured it a number of times, and the worst attempt just hit 10 seconds. That means you can close it easily at stoplights, or even when traveling at slow speeds.\n\nWith the top up, visibility is pretty poor if not downright lousy. I had a hard time backing out of parking spaces and judging blind spots on the highway. The small side mirrors didn’t help matters.\n\nOn the road, wind intrudes significantly right around 65 mph. Under that speed, you can cruise to your heart’s content while still maintaining a conversation with your passenger.\n\nWith the top up, the cabin is incredibly quiet. Retractable hardtops came into favor because they isolated passengers from exterior noise more than soft-tops of the time did. But judging by the new batch of soft-tops — from affordable convertibles like Chevy’s Camaro to the Boxster — the technology has improved greatly. The quiet cabin made me glad Porsche didn’t negatively impact the Boxster’s optimum performance by adding a heavy hardtop.\n\nInterior\nThe old Boxster was also a good performer, but it was definitely not a stunner to look at, inside or out. While the 2013 gets a swoopy exterior with a backside unlike any other car on the road, the inside has been retrofitted even more significantly.\n\nIt now carries over the layout from Porsche’s 911, Panamera and Cayenne, with a long center console housing the shifter and various buttons leading up into a large multimedia touch-screen.\n\nThe materials and controls feel nearly as nice as the ones in the new 911 Cabriolet I tested the week previous to the Boxster. There isn’t as much high-grade leather covering areas like the dash and doors as there is in the 911, but at least now the interior is truly luxurious. I find it hard to imagine shoppers would pick a competitor because it had nicer digs.\n\nMy test car had the optional 14-way adjustable, full-leather seats. Two-way seats covered partially in leather are standard. I can only speak to the ones in my car, which I found supportive, comfortable and downright tailor-fit. There was plenty of bolstering during hard corners, and they had adjustable thigh support — a feature I find quite welcome when equipped.\n\nThe two trunks — a 5.3-cubic-foot-deep well up front and a flatter, wider, golf-bag-accommodating 4.6 cubic feet in back — seemed almost spacious, but there’s little to no storage inside the cabin. Each door has a small pocket and there’s a tiny cubby between the seats and the glove box. There’s no place to easily stash a smartphone, garage-door opener or even money for tolls or drive-throughs.\n\nAnd don’t even get me started on the cupholders, which remain awkwardly hidden above the glove box. If BMW can finally figure out how to please American drivers with conventionally placed cupholders across its lineup, it’s time for Porsche to join the party. The only thing these cupholders can adequately grasp are water bottles with some flex in the plastic. Otherwise, you’ll just worry they’ll pinch the drink container and spill some of its contents — or that they’ll fall out completely during a turn or stop, ruining that nice interior.\n\nFeatures & Price\nLike all Porsches — and a few other German makes — the Boxster comes modestly equipped at its $50,000 base price, with oodles of options with additional price tags attached. Equipped with a variety of options, our tester came to $75,000, pushing it far out of the realm of affordable luxury. Looking at the option list, I could slash the torque vectoring and maybe the convenience package, saving well over $5,000, but could I say no to the gorgeous 20-inch wheels ($3,125) and the black paint job on them to match the canvas top (another $1,425)?\n\nHard to say. If you’re considering a Boxster, keep in mind that you’re going to need at least $60,000 to get one with just a few features, like a multimedia system and leather seats — items that are pretty much expected in this type of car.\n\nSafety\nThe Boxster has not been crash-tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.\n\nThere are two separate side airbags for both occupants. The thorax side airbag inflates from the seats’ outside bolster, while side airbags also deploy from the top of the door, for head protection. As is required of all new cars as of the 2012 model year, the Boxster has antilock brakes and an electronic stability system with traction control.\n\nBoxster in the Market\nA luxury roadster probably isn’t something you normally think of cross-shopping; people who buy from Audi, BMW or Mercedes are likely already fans of the brand. The Boxster, however, should stand out because, well, it’s a Porsche. If you’re going to spend this kind of money on a roadster, it’s a sound move to go with a company that builds well-balanced sports cars.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nIn January 2005, Porsche’s lower-priced mid-engine sports car emerged in redesigned form. Both the regular Boxster and the higher-performance Boxster S got major styling revisions and handling enhancements. The Boxster became the first roadster with head-protection airbags, which deploy from the side-window rails.\n\nBoth of the Boxster’s engines were unchanged in size but delivered significant power boosts. The regular Boxster’s 2.7-liter flat-six-cylinder jumped from 225 to 240 horsepower. The 3.2-liter in the Boxster S is the most powerful engine ever offered in the model line; it generates 280 hp. According to Porsche, the Boxster can accelerate from zero to 60 mph in 5.9 seconds, versus 5.2 seconds for the Boxster S.\n\nVariable-ratio power steering was new for 2005, and its track width increased. By eliminating the spare tire, cargo space grew slightly.\n\nFor 2006, the passenger seat gets weight sensors that disable the front airbags when a child-safety seat is detected. Ten-spoke, 19-inch Carrera Sport wheels, a tire-pressure-monitoring system and an electronic logbook are newly optional.\n\nRivals include the Audi TT, BMW Z4, Honda S2000 and Mercedes-Benz SLK-Class.\n\nExterior\nThe front and side air intakes were enlarged for 2005. The headlights and taillamps were new, and the side windows were enlarged.\n\nAlloy wheels on the Boxster S hold 18-inch tires, while the base model gets 17-inch wheels. Nineteen-inch wheels are optional. The Boxster S has a firmer sport suspension.\n\nInterior\nTwo occupants enjoy leather-upholstered body-hugging bucket seats. The driver faces a trio of gauges in a hooded cluster. Seat heaters, sport seats, Bose surround sound, Park Assist and a navigation system are available. Cargo compartments at both ends offer a total of 9.9 cubic feet of space.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe base Boxster holds a 2.7-liter horizontally opposed six-cylinder that develops 240 hp. The engine is mounted behind the seats but ahead of the rear axle. A five-speed-manual transmission is standard, and a six-speed manual is available.\n\nIn the Boxster S, a 3.2-liter six-cylinder makes 280 hp and works with a standard six-speed-manual gearbox. Either engine can use Porsche’s Tiptronic S five-speed-automatic transmission, which incorporates steering-wheel buttons for manual gear selection.\n\nSafety\nAll-disc antilock brakes, side-impact and head-protection airbags and the Porsche Stability Management electronic stability system are standard.\n\nDriving Impressions\nFew automobiles offer as much all-around driving enjoyment as the Boxster, and the 2005 model raised that bar even higher. With quick, precise control and racetrack-quality moves, the Boxster is eager to dash ahead and keeps its tires planted firmly on the pavement.\n\nWhile previous-generation Boxsters weren’t the quickest sports cars, the current models are substantially swifter. Significant pavement imperfections can result in a rough ride in the Boxster S. The surefooted and positive Boxster follows commands with precision.\n\nStill, the base model may be more appealing. It’s less raucous and delivers a satisfying ride without losing much enjoyment. The base model’s five-speed manual shifts a little easier than the Boxster S’s six-speed manual, but both clutches behave admirably. The Tiptronic S automatic transmission operates with excellence.\n\nLimited cargo space has been a drawback, but the current version has a bit more room. Top-up visibility is troublesome. The seats are snug but surprisingly comfortable.",

      "expert_review": "You can always count on a kid to give it to you straight. I’d just parked Porsche’s new Boxster Spyder roadster when I noticed some kids, not more than 8 or 9 years old, hyping their lemonade stand. Always willing to help the local economy, I walked over to buy a cup.\n\n“Your car is awesome!” one of them cried. I couldn’t agree more; the Boxster Spyder is the most interesting — and exciting — Boxster yet.\n\nThe Boxster Spyder becomes the most powerful, quickest and — at $61,200 — most expensive version of Porsche’s entry-level roadster. For information on the base and midlevel S trims, click here.\n\nUnique Design\n\nPorsche has gone to great lengths to differentiate the Spyder from its Boxster stablemates. Key changes include a removable canvas roof that stows under a restyled rear deck. The deck is accentuated by two large humps directly behind the head restraints that taper toward the roadster’s tail. All in all, the changes — especially the modified deck — make the Boxster Spyder look like the kid brother of the Carrera GT, Porsche’s now-discontinued supercar.\n\nA Street-Legal Racer\n\nYou can drive the Boxster Spyder on public roads like I did, and I suspect many people will, but it’s a car that longs for the racetrack. Comfort and convenience accommodations for you and your lone passenger are minimal, to say the least.\n\nOur test car had the sport bucket seats, which save 26 pounds but also get just one-position backrests that don’t recline (the heavier traditional bucket seats with an adjustable backrest are available at no extra charge). Making air conditioning optional and a CD stereo a no-cost option saves 26 and 7 pounds, respectively. Another weight-saving move: the very cool door-release straps, which take the place of traditional interior handles.\n\nThe less-is-more folks also got their way with the Boxster Spyder’s removable canvas roof, which, by modern standards, is a throwback to an earlier era of droptop motoring. It saves 46 pounds compared with a powered soft-top. The multistep process of disassembling and reassembling the roof takes some time if you’re unfamiliar with it, but it goes much more quickly after only a few tries.\n\nIn many ways, the Boxster Spyder is like a harder-edged, stronger sibling of the Mazda MX-5 Miata. Both cars are designed to make the driver feel at one with them, and both succeed.\n\nThe key to the Boxster is its incredibly balanced handling. Toss it into a corner and it urges you on, gunning to go faster. The steering, which seems like it has a tad too much power assistance when cruising, develops an amazing level of intuitiveness in sweeping corners.\n\nHandling fanatics will go weak in the knees after driving the Boxster Spyder, but it also has power to back up its aggressive looks. The 3.4-liter, horizontally opposed six-cylinder makes 320 horsepower — 10 hp more than the Boxster S — and the roadster’s mid-engine layout puts the engine right behind your head. The six-cylinder makes a great, mechanical growl when accelerating, and it gets louder when you activate the car’s Sport mode, which changes the exhaust sound and makes the gas pedal more responsive. After alternating between regular and Sport modes, I ended up leaving the Boxster Spyder in Sport, which seemed to suit it best.\n\nPorsche cites a zero-to-60-mph time of 4.9 seconds with the standard six-speed manual transmission. With the optional seven-speed dual-clutch transmission and the Sport Chrono Package, the time drops to 4.6 seconds when launch control is engaged. Our test car had the manual, and it pulls strongly through the gears; it’s all too easy to run out of road, forcing you to brake.\n\nThe manual shifts smoothly, but the selector feels a bit like a giant light switch; it flicks back and forth as you shift like it’s attached to a hinge, as opposed to slicing through the gears like the Infiniti G37’s shifter. Nevertheless, the sense of harmony you get from the Boxster Spyder’s handling balance is also present in its powertrain. This car always feels ready to run.\n\nEven though it makes slightly more horsepower than a Boxster S, the Boxster Spyder’s EPA-estimated gas mileage is a little better. It’s rated at 19/27 mpg city/highway with the manual transmission, which is 1 mpg better on the highway than a Boxster S with a manual. Both trims get 20/29 mpg with the dual-clutch transmission.\n\nIf you buy a Boxster Spyder, you’ll have to put up with a punishing ride. It’s great on smooth roads — but so is pretty much any other car. The slightest pavement dimples send a jolt through the chassis and a shot to your kidneys. There’s a clear payoff — that great cornering poise — but it’s one that some people might find too difficult to live with.\n\nThe Spyder’s sport suspension, which lowers the car 20 millimeters, puts the car’s structure to the test, and it gets a passing grade. The body is fairly rigid overall, but the firm ride reveals some minor flexing on especially bumpy roads.\n\nYou only have to take one look at the Boxster Spyder’s toupee-like roof to understand this car is meant for open-air motoring, and it’s a great companion for that type of driving. I spent part of a beautiful autumn day in the Boxster, and it was one of the most satisfying drives I’ve had in a while — both because of the splendid fall colors and because of the car itself. I was particularly impressed by how calm the cabin was with the top down — even at 60 mph. It’s mildly breezy, but it’s not until you get closer to 70 mph that the intensity increases. The roadster layout, combined with the bulging body work right behind the seats, seems to help isolate the cabin from wind rush.\n\nSafety\n\nNeither the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety nor the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has crash-tested the Boxster, nor are they likely to.\n\nStandard safety features include antilock brakes, side-impact airbags, side curtain airbags that deploy from the side doors, and an electronic stability system.\n\nBoxster Spyder in the Market\n\nAt a time when most new cars are gaining more and more features, the Boxster Spyder, with its emphasis on fewer amenities for a more elemental driving experience, is something of a rare bird. In the U.S., the Lotus Elise is one of the few cars in this Porsche’s price range with a similar emphasis on performance and minimalism.\n\nThat said, if anybody is in a position to succeed selling something like the Boxster Spyder, it’s Porsche, which has the type of driving-enthusiast customer base to which this car caters. For many owners, I suspect the Boxster Spyder will be a plaything for the type of autumn days I spent driving it; used that way, it’s a wonderful addition to your personal fleet.\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "Spring arrived in the form of the 2010 Porsche Boxster S, a car that is its own excuse for driving.\n\nIt is a roadster, which means it’s fundamentally impractical. It’s tiny with a convertible top and is best enjoyed on clear spring days with the top down. It has seats for two people and scant room for their stuff. It does not care. It is a celebration of life as ballet, not a champion of heavy lifting.\n\nThe 2010 Boxster S has been substantially redesigned for driving pleasure, which is high praise.\n\nSince its inception in 1997, the Porsche Boxster and, later, its more powerful “S” sibling, were favorites among people who love driving. Those patrons were pleased with the nearly perfect balance of the car — its weight divided nearly 50 percent front and rear.\n\nSome early Boxster models developed problems — engine failures caused by faulty cylinder liners. But Boxster aficionados remained loyal. Fixes were made promptly in most cases. The car, with problems fixed, remained a joy to drive.\n\nThe Boxster S driven for this column came factory fresh, free from any discernible defects, certainly none that were spotted during my week of possession. And it came blessed with perfect weather — sunny days, beautiful skies and mild temperatures, which seemed miraculous after several weeks of wind and snow.\n\nThe nearly perfect 50-50, front-rear weight balance was there in the new car — making it wonderfully agile and enjoyable on drives around West Virginia’s winding mountain roads and, perhaps, seducing me into going faster than was comfortable for my wife, Mary Anne.\n\n“Slow down!” she shouted. I did, thinking that an electronic version of her voiced command, replete with all of its expressed horror and agitation, might be a worthy addition to the huge array of the Boxster’s safety equipment.\n\nBoth acceleration and deceleration were easy, confident — accomplished with no upsetting weight shifts or disturbing gear changes. Credit for that performance goes both to the Boxster S’s seven-speed, dual-clutch gearbox and its reconfigured chassis.\n\nThe gearbox is two electronically controlled transmissions in one, moving power via two separate drive shafts. Gear shifts, as a result, are handled quickly, smoothly, with greater fuel efficiency than with what is available through conventional automatic or manual transmissions.\n\nThe chassis, improved in this iteration through a wider track, gives the car a greater feeling of stability — no wiggle-waggle whatsoever — in panic stops. It also helps that the new car comes with electronic stability and traction control, as well as electronic brake-force assistance to better balance braking pressure distributed to wheels in emergency maneuvers.\n\nI have only one regret about the Boxster S, which is the same complaint I have about other cars expressly built for the joy of driving. Simply stated, there aren’t many places in the real world, especially not in metropolitan areas, where they can be driven the way they were meant to be driven. For example, the Boxster S has an optional “launch system” designed to maximize acceleration from standstill.\n\nThe Boxster S in my possession was so equipped. After depositing Mary Anne safely at home, I went looking for a piece of pavement on which to use it. I found none, at least none free of uniformed guardianship.\n\nI considered going out to Summit Point, W.Va., where there is a nice little raceway for running around. But the day had already slipped into evening in the middle of a workweek. I had neither the financial nor legal means (official pass) to gain access to the track. I returned home the same way I came: with speed-modulating, fun-limiting traffic.\n\nBrown is a special correspondent.",

      "expert_review": "Porsches are conceived as driver’s machines. They are twisty-road dance partners, not to mention fashion statements extraordinaire. Few other cars have such a recognizable shape and sound.\n\nThe entry-level Boxster is one of the most livable sports cars around. Starting at $42,600, it has the style and performance of the more expensive models, yet it is as livable as a family sedan. It feels as much at home in the grocery parking lot as it does blazing down the highway. Point it toward a track and you can almost feel it smile. Competitors include the Corvette and Honda S2000.\n\nThe Boxster first hit the road as a 1998. In the last couple of years it has been given a shot of adrenaline, in the form of a larger engine and more horsepower. There’s a Boxster S for those who need even more performance and power.\n\nThe 2.7-liter, six-cylinder sits right behind the driver and ahead of the rear wheels, creating a nearly ideal 50-50 front-rear weight distribution. This balance is one of the key reasons Boxsters grip the road as if they have suction cups for wheels. This horizontally opposed engine has a low center of gravity, as well. A twin-resonance induction system borrowed from the larger 911 works with variable valve timing to spread power across a wide rpm range. This engine pulls nicely at low speeds, but it really shows its muscles when you rev it up. Gas it hard and the muted howl from the induction system signals the awakening of a deeper spirit. The sound alone is intoxicating, but it’s even better because it is accompanied by a nice push right between your shoulder blades.\n\nSlip the gearshift lever to the next notch, punch the gas again and it’s like a replay in fast forward. Porsche says it hits 62 miles per hour (which is 100 kilometers per hour) in 6.6 seconds.\n\nThe five-speed gearbox mates to a beautifully weighted clutch. Every shift can be executed so smoothly that it feels almost like an automatic. Tactile responses like that make every minute behind the wheel worth the price.\n\nThe Boxster lacks the brute force of a Corvette and the razor-sharp ride of the Honda S2000, but it is easily more comfortable than either on a daily basis.\n\nHandling has always been one of Porsche’s strengths, and the Boxster, because of its mid-engine layout, is exceptional. The test car’s 17-inch wheels and stiffer suspension, which are part of the sport package, make a good car even better, yet there is very little penalty in terms of ride harshness. PorscheÕs stability control, a $1,230 option, controls skids by cutting power and braking one wheel at a time.\n\nMuch of the fun of having a convertible is the ease with which the top can be raised and lowered. The Boxster excels here, too. Flip one latch and the top electrically lowers in 12 seconds. On cool mornings, leave the side windows up and the glass windblocker between the headrests keeps wind from swirling back into the cockpit, making top-down trips free of wind fatigue.\n\nAnot her reason the Boxster is a livable sports car is because it contains two small trunks, one in front and one in back. The trunks should be able to accommodate luggage for two people for a long weekend trip.\n\nComplaints? The Boxster sits low, so getting in and out is not easy, and the windows creaked and squeaked against the top when the weather was cool. A removable hardtop is an option.\n\nPrice\nThe Boxster’s base price is $42,600. Options on the test car included metallic paint, sport package, 17-inch wheels and PorscheÕs stability control system. The sticker price was $48,885.\n\nWarranty\nFour years or 50,000 miles. Point: The Boxster is pure driving delight. It is powerful, light on its feet and very handsome.

      "expert_review": "After watching the Republican National Convention, I was determined to be more inclusive, to review more cars for the common man.\n\nI even called the manufacturers and said: “Look here, not everyone can buy luxury automobiles, fancy sport coupes and convertibles. Start shipping more affordable metal.”\n\nI have witnesses to this, my colleagues Frank Swoboda and Martha Hamilton.\n\nI felt good, noble, upstanding. Then Porsche sent the beautiful “speed yellow” 2000 Boxster S roadster. Suddenly, my desire to reform faded like the will of a politician receiving a campaign contribution, and I understood. Seduction is a powerful thing.\n\nMy guilt didn’t last long. Rationalization has a way of giving waywardness a pleasant face. In what had been a week of torrential rain, the Boxster S arrived on a sunlit day. I figured that if God didn’t want me to drive this one, he would not have provided such lovely weather.\n\nI lowered the top, which was done easily. It involved undoing a single latch in the center of the windshield header, pushing a console button and letting the sunshine in.\n\nI’d loved Boxsters since 1993, when I first saw a concept model on display at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. I was among the first to drive a production model when the car went on sale in 1997.\n\nHeck, I regarded it as a commoner’s Porsche &#151; a sparsely outfitted mid-engine car with nearly perfect 50-50 weight distribution and the best handling imaginable.\n\nBut over the past three years, Porsche began upgrading the car &#151; more horsepower, better interior materials, better brakes, more tinkering with the suspension. The Boxster S is the current culmination of those improvements.\n\nIt has a bigger, more powerful engine than the standard Boxster &#151; a 3.2-liter, 250-horsepower, horizontally opposed, liquid-cooled six-cylinder model vs. a 2.7-liter, 217-horsepower version of that engine in the standard car.\n\nPorsche installed a third radiator to better cool the Boxster S’s bigger engine. The regular Boxster has two small radiators mounted underneath the front hood.\n\nThe Boxster S is faster, going from zero to 60 miles per hour in 5.7 seconds, compared with 6.4 seconds for the regular roadster. Not that anyone with common sense should care. In a traffic environment controlled with cameras, speed limits and police who trailed the Boxster S like ants in pursuit of wet sugar, I didn’t do any peeling away from stop signs or green lights.\n\nAh, but there were moments. I sinned mightily on the empty back roads of a southern state that, for purpose of avoiding self-incrimination, will go unnamed here. But even in that wanton behavior, I never got to use the sixth gear of the Boxster S’s six-speed manual transmission. There was no need for it.\n\nBut the car’s cross-drilled brake discs, a la those found in the Porsche 911 Carrera, did help much, as did its excellent tractio n-control system, which came into play on some gravel-strewn roads.\n\nMy enthusiasm for the car’s practically perfect front-rear weight distribution grew. The Boxster S took curves with nary a wiggle. It went exactly where I aimed it. That was fun!\n\nBut it also was lonely enjoyment, sneaking and speeding around those back roads. I soon tired of it. I longed to be with the masses and was stunned by the realization: I do not want to be inclusive as much as I want to be included.\n\nI’ll review a more affordable vehicle next week.\n\nNuts & Bolts\n\n2000 Porsche Boxster S Complaints: Very limited storage space. It’s not a comfortable car for long-distance trips. In damp weather, the ventilation system seems to have a very difficult time defogging the windshield and side windows.\n\nPraise: The Boxster S is the automobile as art, which is why aficionados love it despite its practical shortcomings. It is designed for people who l ove the fe el of the road.\n\nHead-turning quotient: Attracts too much attention and way too many uniforms. Want to make a law enforcement officer’s day? Just try speeding in the “speed yellow” Boxster S on any major highway.\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: Good ride on trips of 100 miles or less over good roads. But ride feel declines as trip length increases, largely because of the car’s sport-tuned suspension, which is built more for handling than for comfort. Superior acceleration and handling.\n\nCapacities: Seats two people. Holds 16.9 gallons of fuel. Premium unleaded is required (don’t try cheating with lower-octane gasoline in this one).\n\nMileage: About 20 miles per gallon in mostly highway driving.\n\nPrice: Base price is $49,930. Dealer invoice on base model is $43,700. Price as tested is $55,045, including $4,350 in options (full leather interior and other goodies) and a $765 destination charge. Price does not include federal luxury taxes, or state and local levies and fees.\n\nPurse-strings note: There is no substitute for Porsche. If you want this one, and can afford it, buy it. If you want something else, buy that. Just don’t fool yourself into thinking that you’re getting something “just as good.”",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nPorsches entry-level model packs a mid-mounted six-cylinder engine. The Boxster debuted early in 1997 after several years on the concept block. Serving as the German automakers contender for the roadster market, the two-passenger rear-drive Boxster convertible drew abundant praise when it went on sale, drawing a new group of buyers to Porsche dealerships. Styling harks back to the original Porsche 356 of the 1950s and to the seldom-seen 550 Spyder and RS60 models of the past. The Boxster name blends the term used for horizontally opposed engines (boxers) with the cars roadster body.\n\nA Boxster S with a stronger engine arrived for 2000. Boxster rivals include the Audi TT, BMW Z3 and M roadster, Honda S2000 and Mercedes-Benz SLK.\n\nAn electronic stability system called Porsche Stability Management became optional this year and also is used in the larger, rear-engine 911 series. This system integrates the cars antilock brakes with traction control to help maintain stability in difficult situations.\n\nBase-model Boxsters get a new cloth headliner for the fabric top, like the one on the S model, to help keep noise levels down. A new three-spoke steering wheel contains a Porsche crest, and new carpeting has been installed in both the front and rear storage compartments. Stabilizer bars mounted behind the headrests gain softer coverings this year. New LED interior orientation lights help the driver locate the ignition switch, door latches and other interior items at night, and they also promise to add a touch of extra elegance to the cockpit. Self-dimming inside and outside mirrors are grouped in an option package with rain-sensing windshield wipers.\n\nExterior\nThe front-end appearance is similar to that of the rear-engine 911 coupe and convertible, as redesigned for 1999. But farther back, the Boxster has an assertive profile all of its own, based on the mid-engine configuration. The power-operated fabric top has a plastic rear window. A removable aluminum hardtop is available as an option and contains a glass window with a defogger. A rear spoiler and front and rear fog lights are standard, and an optional wind deflector mounts behind the seats to reduce turbulence in the cars interior when the top is down.\n\nAlloy wheels on the Boxster S hold 17-inch tires, which can be installed on the base model as an option to replace the customary 16-inchers. Owners who want an extra touch of traction can opt instead for 18-inch rubber on either model. The S model also has a firmer suspension, bigger brake rotors and a dual exhaust outlet. Cargo compartments at both ends offer a total of 9 cubic feet of space, but that doesnt mean you should haul out the big suitcases. Soft luggage fits the best in the oddly shaped compartments.\n\nInterior\nTwo occupants enjoy leather-trimmed, body-hugging bucket seats with power recliners and a drivers-side height adjustment in a down-to-business cockpit. Following a Porsche tradition, the nearly vertical steering wheel telescopes in and out but does not tilt. Standard equipment includes air conditioning, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and handbrake, heated power mirrors, power windows and locks, a cassette stereo system, heated windshield washer nozzles and a theft-deterrent system. The S model adds remote keyless entry and variable intermittent wipers, as well as a sport suspension and 17-inch tires.\n\nUnder the Hood\nBase-model Boxsters get a 2.7-liter, horizontally opposed DOHC six-cylinder engine that produces 217 horsepower. The engine sits behind the seats and ahead of the rear axle. A five-speed-manual transmission is standard. Stepping up a notch is the Boxster S, which has a 3.2-liter DOHC six-cylinder that makes 250 hp and mates with a six-speed gearbox. Both engines can be used with Porsches optional Tiptronic five-speed-automatic transmission, which incorporates steering-wheel buttons for manual gear selection. Traction control, side-impact airbags and antilock brakes are standard.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2001 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in October 2010 about the 2011 Porsche Boxster Spyder. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2012, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nYou can always count on a kid to give it to you straight. I’d just parked Porsche’s new Boxster Spyder roadster when I noticed some kids, not more than 8 or 9 years old, hyping their lemonade stand. Always willing to help the local economy, I walked over to buy a cup.\n\n“Your car is awesome!” one of them cried. I couldn’t agree more; the Boxster Spyder is the most interesting — and exciting — Boxster yet.\n\nThe Boxster Spyder becomes the most powerful, quickest and — at $61,200 — most expensive version of Porsche’s entry-level roadster. For information on the base and midlevel S trims, click here.\n\nUnique Design\nPorsche has gone to great lengths to differentiate the Spyder from its Boxster stablemates. Key changes include a removable canvas roof that stows under a restyled rear deck. The deck is accentuated by two large humps directly behind the head restraints that taper toward the roadster’s tail. All in all, the changes — especially the modified deck — make the Boxster Spyder look like the kid brother of the Carrera GT, Porsche’s now-discontinued supercar.\n\nA Street-Legal Racer\nYou can drive the Boxster Spyder on public roads like I did, and I suspect many people will, but it’s a car that longs for the racetrack. Comfort and convenience accommodations for you and your lone passenger are minimal, to say the least.\n\nOur test car had the sport bucket seats, which save 26 pounds but also get just one-position backrests that don’t recline (the heavier traditional bucket seats with an adjustable backrest are available at no extra charge). Making air conditioning optional and a CD stereo a no-cost option saves 26 and 7 pounds, respectively. Another weight-saving move: the very cool door-release straps, which take the place of traditional interior handles.\n\nThe less-is-more folks also got their way with the Boxster Spyder’s removable canvas roof, which, by modern standards, is a throwback to an earlier era of droptop motoring. It saves 46 pounds compared with a powered soft-top. The multistep process of disassembling and reassembling the roof takes some time if you’re unfamiliar with it, but it goes much more quickly after only a few tries. (Check out our video on the top’s operation.)\n\nIn many ways, the Boxster Spyder is like a harder-edged, stronger sibling of the Mazda MX-5 Miata. Both cars are designed to make the driver feel at one with them, and both succeed.\n\nThe key to the Boxster is its incredibly balanced handling. Toss it into a corner and it urges you on, gunning to go faster. The steering, which seems like it has a tad too much power assistance when cruising, develops an amazing level of intuitiveness in sweeping corners.\n\nHandling fanatics will go weak in the knees after driving the Boxster Spyder, but it also has power to back up its aggressive looks. The 3.4-liter, horizontally opposed six-cylinder makes 320 horsepower — 10 hp more than the Boxster S — and the roadster’s mid-engine layout puts the engine right behind your head. The six-cylinder makes a great, mechanical growl when accelerating, and it gets louder when you activate the car’s Sport mode, which changes the exhaust sound and makes the gas pedal more responsive. After alternating between regular and Sport modes, I ended up leaving the Boxster Spyder in Sport, which seemed to suit it best.\n\nPorsche cites a zero-to-60-mph time of 4.9 seconds with the standard six-speed manual transmission. With the optional seven-speed dual-clutch transmission and the Sport Chrono Package, the time drops to 4.6 seconds when launch control is engaged. Our test car had the manual, and it pulls strongly through the gears; it’s all too easy to run out of road, forcing you to brake.\n\nThe manual shifts smoothly, but the selector feels a bit like a giant light switch; it flicks back and forth as you shift like it’s attached to a hinge, as opposed to slicing through the gears like the Infiniti G37’s shifter. Nevertheless, the sense of harmony you get from the Boxster Spyder’s handling balance is also present in its powertrain. This car always feels ready to run.\n\nEven though it makes slightly more horsepower than a Boxster S, the Boxster Spyder’s EPA-estimated gas mileage is a little better. It’s rated at 19/27 mpg city/highway with the manual transmission, which is 1 mpg better on the highway than a Boxster S with a manual. Both trims get 20/29 mpg with the dual-clutch transmission.\n\nIf you buy a Boxster Spyder, you’ll have to put up with a punishing ride. It’s great on smooth roads — but so is pretty much any other car. The slightest pavement dimples send a jolt through the chassis and a shot to your kidneys. There’s a clear payoff — that great cornering poise — but it’s one that some people might find too difficult to live with.\n\nThe Spyder’s sport suspension, which lowers the car 20 millimeters, puts the car’s structure to the test, and it gets a passing grade. The body is fairly rigid overall, but the firm ride reveals some minor flexing on especially bumpy roads.\n\nYou only have to take one look at the Boxster Spyder’s toupee-like roof to understand this car is meant for open-air motoring, and it’s a great companion for that type of driving. I spent part of a beautiful autumn day in the Boxster, and it was one of the most satisfying drives I’ve had in a while — both because of the splendid fall colors and because of the car itself. I was particularly impressed by how calm the cabin was with the top down — even at 60 mph. It’s mildly breezy, but it’s not until you get closer to 70 mph that the intensity increases. The roadster layout, combined with the bulging body work right behind the seats, seems to help isolate the cabin from wind rush.\n\nSafety\nNeither the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety nor the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has crash-tested the Boxster, nor are they likely to.\n\nStandard safety features include antilock brakes, side-impact airbags, side curtain airbags that deploy from the side doors, and an electronic stability system.\n\nBoxster Spyder in the Market\nAt a time when most new cars are gaining more and more features, the Boxster Spyder, with its emphasis on fewer amenities for a more elemental driving experience, is something of a rare bird. In the U.S., the Lotus Elise is one of the few cars in this Porsche’s price range with a similar emphasis on performance and minimalism.\n\nThat said, if anybody is in a position to succeed selling something like the Boxster Spyder, it’s Porsche, which has the type of driving-enthusiast customer base to which this car caters. For many owners, I suspect the Boxster Spyder will be a plaything for the type of autumn days I spent driving it; used that way, it’s a wonderful addition to your personal fleet.\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "So much has changed in sports car racing in the past 50 years or so that it’s a nice connection to the heritage to find something that hasn’t: In 1960, the 12 Hours of Sebring endurance race was every bit the critical warm-up to the 24 Hours of Le Mans that it is now, considered comparably stressful on driver and machinery due to the brutally rough Sebring road course, fashioned in part from acres and acres of World War II-era concrete left over from a military base.\n\nAs it was in 1960, horsepower rules Sebring. On paper, anyway. But because the races aren’t run on paper, things happen. Such as in 1960, when a tiny, fragile-looking, silver Porsche RS 60, powered by a 1.7-liter four-cylinder engine, beat the brutal Ferraris and Maseratis and took the overall victory at the 12 Hours of Sebring. Drivers Hans Herrmann and Olivier Gendebien were as surprised as anyone else that their little silver giant-killer won, and just as surprised that another Brumos-entered RS 60 driven by Bob Holbert, Roy Schecter and Howard Fowler was second. In third? A Ferrari, some 11 laps, or 60 miles, behind the winning Porsche.\n\nFast-forward to 2008. Porsche, looking for a way to inject a little excitement into the aging Boxster, has built 1,960 — as in 1960, get it? — Boxster RS 60s to commemorate the little car that could, that 550-based RS 60.\n\nAll 1,960 of them are painted GT Silver Metallic, very close to the color of the 1960 car, and you can get either a black or a red top. We suggest red, as it matches the Carrera Red leather interior so well.\n\nMechanically, the car is pretty much a Boxster S, with a few very minor tweaks to the 3.4-liter six-cylinder upping horsepower to 303, from 295. You’ll recall that the regular Boxster has a 2.7-liter engine, with 245 horsepower.\n\nPorsche is billing the Boxster RS 60 as the only Boxster with more than 300 horsepower, which is certainly true, but you’d be hard-pressed to tell much difference. Porsche claims a 0 to 60 mph time for the Boxster S with the six-speed manual transmission of 5.1 seconds, and that was exactly our best time with the RS 60. We did not test top speed, which for the Boxster S is given as 169 mph. That said, as with all Boxsters past and present, this is not a 0 to 60 mph car, and the joyous noise that comes from that so-smooth engine as it approaches ultra-legal speeds can best be appreciated with the top town, stereo off, police hopefully otherwise occupied.\n\nInside, the seats are comfortable and supportive, the one-button power top easy to use. The RS 60’s construction quality was superb, with no squeaks, rattles, uneven seams or irregular panel gaps. As with all Boxsters, the front and rear trunks provide plenty of luggage room.\n\nSo what else is new with the Boxster RS 60? Not as much as you might want for a collector model. There are unique stainless-steel door sills, a slightly modified instrument cluster, a different gearshift lever, slight modifications to seat upholstery and a minor tweak to the taillights. Nowhere on the outside does it say that this is an RS 60. Still, since fewer than 800 of the 1,960 cars will be coming to North America, Porsche doesn’t seem to think there will be end-of-the-year discounts on the RS 60, and we agree.\n\nSentinel Automotive Editor Steven Cole Smithcan be reached at scsmith@orlandosentinel.com.",

      "expert_review": "Sports car earns respect\n\nBoxster S is the performance version of Porsche’s entry-level roadster.\n\nPorsche’s entry-level sports cars get no respect. From the little 914 of the 1970s, through the front-engine 924 and 944, to today’s Boxster, the pecking order ranks them as something less than a real Porsche.\n\nIn other words, not up to the standards of a racy 911.\n\nThat’s too bad, really, especially for the Boxster. Here’s a sharp little roadster with the looks and performance of a real thoroughbred. Among midprice, two-seat imports, including Audi TT, BMW Z4, Honda S2000, Mercedes-Benz SLK and Nissan 350Z, Boxster is the undisputed class act. Throw in Chevrolet Corvette, and you might get some dispute.\n\nThe hot Boxster S narrows the gap between entry-level and top Porsches, adding the horsepower and handling characteristics that have made the German sports-car maker synonymous with competitive performance. It gains some measure of respect, though still labors under the entry-level stigma.\n\nBut most of all, Boxster S is highly successful at its appointed task: to be fun, sporting and a great car in which to be seen.\n\nEspecially with the top down.\n\nWhat it is\n\nThe hot version of Porsche’s entry-level roadster, Boxster S offers performance akin to a 911 at a (somewhat) more reasonable price.\n\nEngine and transmission\n\nThe 3.2-liter flat six cranks out 258 horsepower, a boost of eight horsepower over last year’s S and 30 horsepower over the standard 2003 Boxster’s 2.7-liter engine. That’s enough to propel the sub-3,000-pound Boxster S to 60 mph in less than six seconds, depending on the driver’s ability to flip through the gears.\n\nInfinitely variable cam timing provides a broad power band, adding versatility to the engine attributes. One minute it’s shrieking with power under full throttle, the next it’s rumbling quietly through traffic.\n\nThe engine roars up to its 7,500 redline with a powerful whoosh, rocketing into illegal territory before you get into third gear. Smooth and satisfying.\n\nAs well as tuning the engine for power, Porsche engineers tuned the exhaust for “acoustic presence.” That, according to the press material, is what gives Boxster S its sweet singing voice.\n\nThe six-speed, close-ratio transmission snicks sharply into gear with a twist of the wrist. Boxster S also comes with Porsche’s popular Tiptronic automatic transmission, with push-button steering-wheel controls.\n\nI’ll take the six-speed.\n\nHandling and drivability\n\nWith sinuous response and supernatural cornering ability, Boxster S continues Porsche’s tradition of great sports cars. Handling really is amazing, the inherent balance of a midengine layout enhanced by a suspension that is stiffer than the standard model and set up for fast maneuverability.\n\nThe optional electronic anti-skid p rogram, called Porsche Stability Management, is non-intrusive yet effective. It keeps you out of trouble without your even knowing it’s working. Turn the system off, and you discover that your fine driving skills have suddenly diminished.\n\nLike all Porsches, Boxster S is tractable and easy to drive at low speeds, springing to life only when the driver gets on it.\n\nStyling\n\nDesigned to evoke Porsche’s classic sports-racing cars from the 1950s, Boxster’s look has held up beautifully over the past six years.\n\nSubtle body changes were made for 2003, including a revised front lower fascia and a rear treatment that comes down lower and wraps around the tailpipe. Boxster S gets titanium-colored exterior trim, aggressive-looking red brake calipers that show through the 17- or optional 18-inch alloy rims and revised air vents on its flanks.\n\nThe redesigned convertible top is rounder and more shapely and has a glass rear window with built-in de roster. The top opens or closes automatically in 12 seconds.\n\nThe midengine setup is surprisingly practical, with a deep trunk up front and a small trunk in the rear. The engine seems non-existent, tucked away out of sight behind the seats.\n\nInterior\n\nClassic forms highlight the tight but comfortable Boxster interior, from the supportive seats to the white-faced gauges with Porsche’s distinctive script numerals.\n\nThe cabins of 911s are noted for their spaciousness, but not so the Boxster. Anyone over 6 feet tall is going to feel crowded in here. Also, the steering wheel telescopes but does not tilt upward, which isn’t appreciated by tall drivers seeking a little extra legroom.\n\nThere are plenty of cubbies for stowage, and the newly redesigned cupholders actually hold cups.\n\nPricing\n\nThough less expensive than top Porsches, Boxster S does not come cheap, limiting its appeal to those enthusiasts who can afford the toll. Base price is $51,600 for a well-equipped sports car.\n\nOptions on the test car included 18-inch alloy wheels, $1,435; stability management system, $1,235; upgraded audio, $830; special metallic paint, $825; cruise control, $570; interior wind deflector, $375; wheel caps with Porsche crest, $175; and shipping, $765.\n\nTotal: $57,905.\n\nBottom Line\n\nBoxster S adds power and finesse to Porsche’s attractive entry-level car.",
