      "expert_review": "Porsche has a habit of reserving its best performance bits for coupes, but the 2024 718 Spyder RS finally sees the German brand give its all to the Boxster. What we have here is an open-top two-seater packed with as much tech as it can handle and liberated of the Boxster moniker (presumably to free up space on the deck lid for badging).\n\nRelated: What Is a Boxer Engine?\n\nPerformance and Handling\n\nThe 2024 718 Spyder RS comes with the 4.0-liter flat-six engine found in the Cayman GT4 RS; it makes 493 horsepower and 331 pounds-feet of torque. Porsche claims a top speed of 191 mph and that the Spyder RS will hit 60 mph in 3.2 seconds, a half-second quicker than the regular 718 Spyder. The only available transmission is Porsche’s seven-speed dual-clutch automatic.\n\nThe chassis is a mix of Spyder and Cayman GT4 RS bits. Porsche Active Suspension Management is standard, and the car sits 1.2 inches lower than the non-RS Spyder. Spring and damper rates are reduced compared to the Cayman GT4 for what Porsche describes as a “more relaxed, characteristically convertible-style setup,” and ride, toe, camber and anti-roll bars are all adjustable. An optional front-axle lift system raises the nose of the car 1.1 inches at speeds up to 37 mph; if the valet returns the car with the nose sniffing pavement, suspect Ferris Buellerian shenanigans.\n\nStyling\n\nThe Spyder RS wears a slightly smaller splitter than its Cayman counterpart — and a comparatively subtle ducktail spoiler — but the body modifications are otherwise similar. Like the Cayman GT4 RS, the Spyder RS has a carbon-fiber hood with ducts to feed cooling air to the brakes, an outlet at the top of the bumper to channel air and vents carved into the fenders over the front wheels.\n\nOpt for the $12,570 Weissach Package and that hood goes unpainted, as do the side air intakes and the Gurney flap atop the ducktail spoiler. The lightweight bundle also replaces the standard 20-inch forged-aluminum wheels with magnesium 20s and ditches the stainless-steel exhaust in favor of titanium.\n\nInside is what Porsche calls “nothing but functional and ergonomic essentials.” That includes seats with carbon-fiber shells, black leather with contrasting color inserts, and a yellow tab on the steering wheel to help the driver keep track of 12 o’clock. Cars equipped with the Weissach Package see Porsche’s Race-Tex synthetic suede spread from just seat trim to the upper dash, as well.\n\nLike the non-RS car, the 718 Spyder ditches the power soft top for a manual sheet. The RS takes that idea to the extreme, breaking the top down into two pieces. The sunshield is little more than what it says: shade. With just that in place, the interior remains open to the elements behind and to the sides of the occupants. To keep dry in the rain, you’ll also need to install a separate weather protector. Combined, Porsche says the two pieces weigh about 40 pounds, saving 16 pounds compared to the Spyder and more than 36 pounds relative to a Boxster’s power top.\n\nPricing and Availability\n\nThe 718 Spyder RS starts at $162,350 (including $1,650 destination charge). Orders are open, and deliveries will begin in the spring of 2024.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2022 Porsche Taycan Cross Turismo Turbo S Review: The (Almost) Do-It-All EV\n2021 Porsche 911 Turbo Review: How to Successfully Maintain a Legacy\nPorsche 718 GTS 4.0: You Make Me Feel Like a Natural Sports Car\nResearch the Porsche 718 Spyder\nShop for a Porsche 718 Spyder\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The range-topping models of the 2020 Porsche 718 Cayman and 718 Spyder are both getting a new engine — a 4.0-liter, naturally aspirated flat-six that produces 414 horsepower and 309 pounds-feet of torque. True to the brand’s roots, both models are only available with a six-speed manual transmission featuring downshift rev-matching — which can be turned off if you want to do your own throttle blipping.\n\nRelated: 2019 Porsche 911 Speedster First Impressions: Be Still My Beating Heart \n\nThe new engine has an 8,000-rpm redline and propels both models to 60 mph in a claimed 4.2 seconds; the Cayman GT4 will reach a 188-mph top speed, while the Spyder will hit 187. Porsche also says this Cayman GT4 is 10 seconds quicker around the Nurburgring Nordschleife than its predecessor.\n\nAnother nifty feature is Porsche Active Suspension Management with adaptive damping and a 1.18-inch lower ride height than other 718 models. Camber, toe, ride height and anti-roll bar settings are all manually adjustable, bringing the worlds of Gran Turismo and Forza into real life. Both cars have standard brakes adapted from the 911 GT3, and carbon-ceramic brakes are — of course — optional. A mechanical limited-slip differential is also standard.\n\nBoth models get updated exterior looks and feature a front lip spoiler with a debossed model designation, an air outlet in front of the front trunk, a new rear diffuser to reduce lift and tinted taillights. The soft-top for the 718 Spyder is manual for weight savings and can be optioned as a two-tone red-and-black top in honor of historic Porsche racecars. The 718 Spyder also has a unique, automatically extending rear spoiler. The hardtop Cayman GT4’s side air intakes have additional side blades now, and the model’s giant rear wing is manually adjustable.\n\nInside both cars, there’s Alcantara faux suede everywhere, as befits two hardcore track-focused cars. The shifter in both has shorter throws than standard 718 models, and driver and passenger each get standard Porsche Sport Seats Plus. Full bucket seats or 18-way power sport seats are optional. Unlike hardcore Porsche models of the past, climate control and multimedia systems are standard instead of optional. A two-tone leather trim is optional on the 718 Spyder, and the Spyder also has exterior-paint-colored cabin trim pieces instead of the Cayman GT4’s brushed aluminum.\n\nAll this goodness will cost you a pretty penny: Before options but including destination fee, the 718 Spyder will cost $97,550 and the Cayman GT4 will set you back $100,450. Both are available for ordering now, with deliveries expected in the spring of 2020.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
