      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nPorsche’s 2015 Macan is the sports-car maker’s first foray into the luxury compact SUV segment filled with small utes like the Land Rover Range Rover Evoque, soon-to-be-released Mercedes-Benz GLA-Class and Audi Q5. Any thoughts of Porsche selling out by offering a more mainstream compact SUV can be quickly put to rest with the twin-turbocharged engines making 340 horsepower and 400 hp in the base Macan S and Macan Turbo, respectively. Porsche wants the Macan to be the first compact SUV that’s also a sports car.\n\nBut it’s also an SUV, so the Macan comes with standard all-wheel drive, power liftgate, off-road mode and available air suspension with adjustable ride height. After all, Porsche has a decade of SUV experience with its popular, and larger, Cayenne.\n\nExterior\nThe Macan’s look is undeniably Porsche, taking inspiration from the Cayenne in addition to Porsche’s sports cars. Porsche says the sloping roof and rear fenders are 911-inspired, and the headlights are based on the upcoming 918 Spyder.\n\nDifferentiating the Macan S and Turbo can be done a few ways. One, by looking at the dual exhaust where the Macan S wears round exhaust tips, and the Turbo features square exhaust finishers. The side blades on the Macan’s profile are painted black on the entry-level Macan S and body colored on the higher-optioned Macan Turbo, though Turbo models can also equip carbon fiber blades on the sides.\n\nLarge wheels up to 21 inches are available, while 19-inch rollers are standard with a staggered tire size; they are narrower up front and wider out back. The staggered tire size enables sporty yet precise steering maneuvers, Porsche says.\n\nInterior\nThe five-seat Macan gets inspiration from the 918 Spyder on the inside as well with a steering wheel said to be all new and taken from the 918 Spyder hybrid sports car. Like the outside, Porsche stayed true to its classic design on the inside with three prominent gauge clusters filled with analog and digital gauges. A 4.8-inch color display shows audio, navigation (when equipped) and vehicle information. Various interior trim options, seating, stereo and other personalization features are available, just like other Porsches.\n\nThe main screen for controlling multimedia and navigation functions is a 7-inch touch-screen. Optional stereos include Burmester and Bose units.\n\nWhen it comes to using the Macan as an SUV, there’s 17.7 cubic feet of cargo space behind the rear seat and 53 cubic feet when the backseat is folded. Room behind the rear seats is on the smaller side compared to its competition, though maximum room is on par with the GLK-Class, Evoque and Q5.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Macan has the attributes of a sports car and off-roader packing 340 hp in base S models and 400 hp in Turbo models; both use a twin-turbocharged V-6. The engine feeds a standard all-wheel-drive system through a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. Porsche expects the Macan S to hit 60 mph in 5.2 seconds and 5.0 seconds with the available Sport Chrono Package that includes launch control. The Macan Turbo hits the 60 mph mark in 4.6 seconds and 4.4 seconds with the Sport Chrono Package.\n\nThen there are the off-road bits. Along with the standard Sport mode activated via a button, all Macans also feature an off-road button that can be activated below 50 mph. Off-road mode tunes the shift points for off-road use and provides the front wheels with torque faster, and with the optional air suspension raises the vehicle for additional ground clearance — up to 9.06 inches. A Porsche Hill Control system keeps downhill descents in check by limiting speed automatically between 2 and 18 mph.\n\nPorsche’s Active Suspension Management is standard on Macan Turbos with driving modes for Comfort, Sport and Sport Plus settings.\n\nSafety\nStopping power comes from six-piston front calipers and rotors sized 13.78 inches on the S and 14.17 inches on the Turbo. The Macan features an automatic braking system designed to reduce a secondary collision after a primary collision first by applying maximum braking effort once the airbags have deployed.\n\nOptional safety equipment includes lane keeping assist, blind spot warning and adaptive cruise control.",

      "expert_review": "More details are emerging on the refreshed 2019 Porsche Macan, an SUV for which updates were first announced in the summer. Porsche shared details Monday on the Macan S, a variant that slots between the base Macan and all but certainly a few high-performance editions to follow. Not that the Macan S is low-performance, with a new turbocharged V-6 that increases power for 2019.\n\nRelated: Macan You Hear Me Now? 8 Reasons to Want Porsche’s Updated 2019 SUV\n\nOutput is now 348 horsepower and 354 pounds-feet of torque, up 8 hp and 15 pounds-feet versus the outgoing turbo V-6 (340 hp, 339 pounds-feet). Displacement remains the same 3.0 liters, but Porsche fitted a new single, centrally mounted twin-scroll turbocharger rather than the prior twin-turbo setup — underlining why effectiveness, not sheer quantity, matters most for turbochargers. Porsche says the SUV hits 60 mph in as little as 4.9 seconds with the Sport Chrono Package, a tenth of a second quicker than the previous Macan S. It’s considerably quicker than the base Macan, but the latter is no slouch, with a turbo four-cylinder (248 hp, 273 pounds-feet) that scoots you to 60 mph in the low-6-second range.\n\nOther changes for the Macan S include more aluminum instead of steel in the front suspension to reduce unsprung mass. Porsche also claims larger front disc brakes and improved brake-pedal feel, as well as retuned stabilizer bars. Carbon-ceramic brakes, air springs and adaptive shock absorbers remain optional.\n\nThe smaller of two Porsche SUVs, the Macan is the brand’s best-selling model in America. It enters the current generation’s fifth model year for 2019 with freshened styling that includes an LED light strip to bridge the taillights, similar to what you see on most other Porsche models. Low-speed semi-autonomous driving is now capable thanks to Traffic Jam Assist, while the cabin gets a higher-tech dashboard touchscreen that’s 10.9 inches versus the prior 7 inches. An optional GT Sport steering wheel borrowed from the 911 includes an integrated drive-mode switch.\n\nThe 2019 Macan S starts at $59,650, including a $1,050 destination charge. That’s $8,700 more than the base Macan ($50,950). Both variants increase a bit over their 2018 model-year equivalents, $2,100 for the 2019 Macan and $3,200 for the 2019 Macan S. Orders for the Macan S are open now, with deliveries beginning in summer 2019.\n\nExpect higher-performance editions to show up in the coming months. The 2018 Macan included a GTS and two Turbo editions, with performance topping out at 440 hp and zero-to-60 times in the low-4-second range. We’d expect to see the return of both variants given how Porsche is rarely one to dial it back. Stay tuned for more.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2016 Porsche Macan S SUV is the apple that doesn’t fall far from the tree in Porsche’s repertoire, delivering a high-performance driving experience in an unlikely shape.\n\nVersus the competition: You can spend similar money on larger SUVs, but they can’t rival the 2016 Porsche Macan’s combination of athletic twin-turbo driving experience and luxuriously appointed interior.\n\nPorsche has been more than just a “car” maker for years, since the introduction of its wildly popular Cayenne midsize SUV. The compact Macan is a smaller, more affordable SUV introduced to the Porsche lineup for 2015.\n\nSmaller doesn’t mean cheap, though, and the Porsche Macan doesn’t exactly have an apples-to-apples competitor, which makes it an interesting little SUV. The 340-horsepower Macan S starts at $53,595 including destination — a hefty sum compared to the similarly sized BMW X4 and Land Rover Range Rover Evoque, which are as much as $11,125 less expensive. A 400-hp Macan Turbo starts at $74,895, and the well-equipped-but-not-loaded Porsche Macan S I tested totaled $69,455 — closer to the cost of midsize coupe-inspired SUVs such as the BMW X6 and Mercedes-Benz GLE450 AMG Coupe.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe Macan’s resemblance to Porsche’s sports cars helps its curb appeal. The rear is wide and curvy, like the 911, and its headlight styling is borrowed from the Porsche 918 hybrid supercar. The tires are staggered in width, with wider rubber in back giving the Macan a poised stance — as well as handling that’s more similar to a sports car than a family SUV. The optional RS Spyder wheels ($1,650) on our Macan S measured 20 inches and wore Michelin Latitude Tour HP tires sized 265/45R20 up front and a sports-coupe-like 295/40R20 in back.\n\nHow It Drives\nJust because only one Porsche Macan is called “Turbo” doesn’t mean the others aren’t turbocharged. Under the hood of a Porsche Macan S is a twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 making 340 hp, mated to a seven-speed, dual-clutch automatic transmission and all-wheel drive. The engine is extremely well-mannered for a turbo engine, with power delivery so finely tuned and linear that most people won’t be able to tell the difference between it and a high-horsepower, naturally aspirated V-6.\n\nAcceleration is quick in the S, but not pin-you-to-your-seat fast; if that’s what you’re looking for, check out the 400-hp Macan Turbo. Still, Porsche’s signature exhaust symphony burbles through the tailpipes and sounds strikingly similar to any one of Porsche’s coupes. The standard exhaust system adjusts to deliver a more noticeable growl during higher engine loads and in Sport mode.\n\nNot all’s good in the neighborhood: There’s a slight lag in initial accelerator response when accelerating from a stop, even in Sport mode. The delay isn’t very Porsche-like, and it’s annoying when you want to move from a stop with vigor. One area in which there isn’t much delay is the seven-speed, dual-clutch automatic transmission’s shifts. This Porsche Doppelkupplung transmission shifts unbelievably quickly, with 911-like levels of shifting action in automatic mode and from the steering-wheel-mounted paddles.\n\nThe Porsche Macan S blends sharp handling and respectable ride quality, similar to the 911. The excellent road feel transmitted through the steering wheel, along with the balanced handling, provide a level of confidence that’s fitting for Porsche and far superior to even the sportiest X4 xDrive35i M Sport. It’s also nimble and more composed than a larger X6. Compare the Macan with the BMW and Land Rover Range Rover Evoque here.\n\nGiven the Macan’s size, its EPA-estimated gas mileage is unimpressive at 17/23/19 mpg city/highway/combined. That’s closer to the larger BMW X6 xDrive35i (18/24/20 mpg) and GLE450 AMG Coupe (17/23/20 mpg) than it is to the X4’s 19/27/22 mpg and the Evoque’s 21/30/24 mpg.\n\nThe Macan’s sport-tuned suspension is never uncomfortable like the rough-riding BMW, though I wouldn’t call the Macan “comfortable”; our test car had standard coil springs and fixed-firmness shock absorbers. But a slightly busy ride at highway speeds is a completely fair tradeoff for how well the Macan handles, and a little body motion in aggressive cornering doesn’t take away too much from its dynamic personality. Adaptive shock absorbers with coil springs and an air suspension are options if you want to improve ride/handling characteristics.\n\nIn typical Porsche fashion, you can add another $16,000 in performance options to the Macan S if you want, including carbon-ceramic brakes, the aforementioned upgraded suspensions, a torque-vectoring function for enhanced cornering rotation, sport exhaust and more.\n\nInterior\nStandard Interior styling is purely performance-minded. Our test car was equipped with optional red and black leather seats, red accent stitching and aluminum accents. Porsche’s signature center-mounted tachometer has a huge presence over any other gauge; it’s a testament to the Porsche Macan’s driver-oriented nature.\n\nInterior quality is top-notch for a “baby” Porsche SUV, and our test car was filled with $12,000 of convenience and media options, including blind spot monitoring, a heated steering wheel, heated and cooled seats, heated rear seats, a panoramic moonroof, navigation and a Bose stereo. About that heated steering wheel: The on/off button is hidden behind the wheel, in the bottom spoke. It’s nearly impossible to find without consulting the owner’s manual or getting a pointer from someone in the know.\n\nBrightly colored red sport seats hug your sides like good all-purpose sport seats should, with supportive bolstering and enough lower-back padding to make long drives doable. With how little room they have, backseat passengers may not be as happy to spend long drives in the Macan. There’s a big hump in the middle of the floor, and the panoramic roof cuts headroom. At 6 feet tall, I felt shoehorned into the backseat. There’s significantly more room in the larger X6 and GLE450 AMG, which you can compare with the Macan here.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nAnother signature Porsche interior characteristic is a massive center console littered with buttons — not only for typical controls such as Sport mode or heated seats, but also independent buttons for each available airflow direction for the climate system. Sure, why not? It’s actually not a bad setup. I acclimated to the layout quickly and appreciated having buttons at my fingertips for functions that are normally hidden within layers upon layers of touch-screen menus.\n\nThe Porsche Macan’s standard multimedia system features a 7-inch touch-screen and 70-plus physical buttons that litter the interior. Navigation is optional; it’s cryptically called Porsche Communication Management and comes in the $2,990 Infotainment Package. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto aren’t available on the 2016 Macan, but CarPlay will debut on the 2017 Macan GTS. Other options include just about everything under the sun — including a fire extinguisher and two optional stereos. The standard 11-speaker stereo features a USB input with iPod connectivity. It’s replaceable with a 14-speaker Bose stereo for $1,400 or an even higher-end, 16-speaker Burmester system for $5,690. The mid-level Bose is decent enough but doesn’t stand out in any particular way for its hefty price.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe small-interior theme continues in cargo and storage space. A center console overrun with buttons doesn’t leave room for extra storage, and there are just two cupholders and a small, square-shaped, shallow storage bin under the center armrest. The BMW X4 and X6 at least provide a nifty sliding cover over their cupholders to store loose items, and the GLE-Class coupe has a separate cubby area for phones and other items.\n\nLuggage space behind the Porsche Macan’s 40/20/40-split folding backseat is a small 17.7 cubic feet that’s deep but narrow, and the aggressively sloped roofline doesn’t provide much room for taller objects. Cargo space is more similar to a Mercedes-Benz GLA-Class (17.2 cubic feet) or BMW X4 (17.7 cubic feet) than to the roomier X6 (26.6 cubic feet) or GLE-Class coupe (23 cubic feet).\n\nSafety\nThe Porsche Macan had not been crash-tested as of publication. Available safety systems include blind spot monitoring, called Lane Change Assist, and Lane Keeping Assist, which automatically nudges the vehicle after it veers from a lane. A backup camera is also optional and comes with front and rear parking sensors. Also cryptically named, Porsche Active Safe is the Macan’s forward collision warning system with autonomous braking. It pairs with adaptive cruise control for $1,440. See all the Macan’s safety features here, and check out how well child-safety seats fit in the Macan in the Car Seat Check.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe Porsche Macan’s combination of small size, high price, sports-car-like handling and luxurious interior make it a genuinely unique compact luxury SUV. The bulk of Macans in Cars.com’s national inventory are more expensive than similarly sized X4s or Evoques. The X4 xDrive35i with a 300-hp, turbocharged six-cylinder starts at $50,695, and an entry-level Evoque SE is $42,470. At that price, though, you get only 240 hp, making it far less of a performance buy.\n\nThe Macan S starts at $53,595, though most in our inventory are between $65,000 and $70,000, while most X4s and Evoques list closer to $50,000 to $55,000. Shoppers may see larger coupe-inspired luxury SUVs, like the midsize BMW X6 (starts at $61,595) or Mercedes-Benz GLE450 AMG Coupe ($66,025) as closer competitors, considering the cost to get into one is closer to what it will likely take to buy a Macan.\n\nThe Porsche Macan S is at a size disadvantage compared with the GLE450 and the X6 in terms of both cargo space and backseat room, but it manages to not feel overpriced for its small size. The as-tested cost of the Macan S we drove, $69,455, wasn’t offensive given its impressive quality, performance and distinctive Porsche flair. Year-end sales placed the Porsche Macan as the No. 2 best-selling model in Porsche’s lineup for 2015, behind the Cayenne SUV. We will see what 2017 brings with the added Macan GTS.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Porsche has announced updates to its popular Macan compact SUV for the 2022 model year. While this isn’t a full redesign, the Macan is getting some notable tweaks to its exterior, interior and mechanicals.\n\nRelated: 2021 Porsche Panamera 4S E-Hybrid Review: An Efficient, High-Performance Cruiser\n\nHere are four key updates you should know about:\n\n1. More Power (But No Macan Turbo … Yet)\n\nAcross the 2022 Macan lineup, Porsche is giving buyers more powerful engine options compared to 2021 models. Base models still get a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder, but it’s been updated to produce 261 horsepower and 295 pounds-feet of torque — increases of 13 and 22, respectively, over the 2021 version. The 2022 Macan S gets the engine from the 2021 Macan GTS, a twin-turbocharged 2.9-liter V-6 making 375 hp and 383 pounds-feet. The current range-topping Macan, the GTS, gets the twin-turbo 2.9-liter V-6 from the 2021 Macan Turbo, giving it 434 hp and 406 pounds-feet. If you’re sensing the start of a pattern, so are we, but Porsche hasn’t announced anything with higher performance than the GTS, at least not yet.\n\nWith the updated engines, 0-60 mph times range from 5.8 seconds for the base and 4.4 seconds for the S to down to just 4.1 seconds for the GTS (all times are Porsche estimates when the Macan is equipped with the optional Sport Chrono Package). All models come standard with Porsche’s seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission and all-wheel drive.\n\nGTS models also get standard Porsche Surface Coated Brakes and an adaptive suspension Porsche says can be up to 15% stiffer than in previous models. The suspension’s bump stops and strut mounts are new and the dampers have been recalibrated, as well.\n\n2. Updated Exterior\n\nThe 2022 Macan’s powertrain updates are the biggest news, but Porsche didn’t stop there. The revised model gets freshened front styling with new air intakes and body-color bumper trim, along with a new, taller rear diffuser. Along the sides, the side blade design now includes a textured element and Sport Design side mirrors are now standard. A bevy of new wheel choices are available with sizes now ranging from 19 to 21 inches.\n\nGTS models get the most striking exterior design, with side skirts, 21-inch black RS Spyder wheels, clear LED taillights and black exhaust tips.\n\n3. Revised Interior, Too\n\nRefinements rather than major changes are the name of the game inside the 2022 Macan, too. There’s a new center console design with touch-sensitive controls (never our favorite, though Porsche says these have haptic feedback) around a revised and shorter gear selector lever. The standard 10.9-inch touchscreen includes built-in navigation and Apple CarPlay, but not Android Auto compatibility; though Porsche recently announced an update to its multimedia system to include Android Auto, the 2022 Macan doesn’t get the new system. Buyers can also choose from new GT Sport steering wheel options borrowed from the 911. New contrast stitching colors for the upholstery are also available.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nWhich New Cars Have Manual Transmissions?\nWhich Cars Have Panoramic Moonroofs or Sunroofs?\nWhich Cars Have Self-Driving Features for 2021?\nWhich Convertibles Offer AWD or 4WD?\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto: Where Are They Now?\n4. It’ll Cost You\n\nPorsche also announced pricing for the 2022 Macan and, given the updates, it may not surprise you that a 2022 Macan will cost more than a comparable 2021 model. Just how much?\n\n2022 Macan: $56,250 ($2,800 increase)\n2022 Macan S: $66,750 ($5,200 increase)\n2022 Macan GTS: $81,250 ($7,800 increase)\n\nIt is worth noting, however, that the 2022 Macan GTS — with the 2021 Macan Turbo’s powertrain — is actually $4,700 less than the 2021 Macan Turbo. (All prices include a $1,350 destination fee, which is unchanged from 2021).\n\nAccording to Porsche, base models should arrive in early 2021 with S and GTS versions arriving in the spring.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The Porsche Macan is more sports car than SUV. Depending on your needs, that’s either an enticement or a warning.\n\nVersus the competition: In a class of luxury SUVs that are largely fun to drive, the Macan is among the best. But — perhaps unsurprisingly — it’s expensive, cramped and hard to see out of.\n\nRelated: 2020 Porsche Macan Video: IPhone Users May Just Have to Adapt\n\nAfter some mild updates for 2019, the 2020 Macan brings back the GTS and Turbo models, both of which had taken a one-year hiatus. (Compare the group here, or stack up the 2020 trims here.) The 2020 Macan comes in four variants, all with standard all-wheel drive: base, S, GTS and Turbo. Performance ranges from 248 to 434 horsepower. We tested a moderately optioned Macan S.\n\nA Riot to Drive, Obviously\n\nIt should shock no one that the Macan S is quick. Its turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 is good for 348 hp and 354 pounds-feet of torque. More notable is the drivetrain’s responsiveness; the engine pulls especially hard when revs climb above 3,500 rpm or so, and Porsche’s PDK transmission — a dual-clutch, seven-speed automatic — holds lower gears longer to keep revs high, even in normal driving modes. When you reach cruising speed and let off the accelerator, the PDK upshifts multiple gears in quick succession, but if you get back on the gas it’ll kick down just as many in one fell swoop.\n\nKickdown lag ranges from acceptable in normal driving modes to gratifyingly minimal when you activate Sport mode. Regardless of mode, though, the drivetrain can exhibit some lurching at lower speeds — a widespread tendency in the early days of dual-clutch automatics, though some more recent examples have mitigated that.\n\nPorsche says the Macan S hits 60 mph in 5.1 seconds, substantially quicker than the base Macan (6.3 seconds with a 248-hp turbo four-cylinder). The GTS and Turbo get a turbocharged 2.9-liter V-6, with the GTS (375 hp) hitting 60 mph in 4.7 seconds and the Turbo (434 hp) in 4.3 seconds. There’s an available Sport Chrono Package that includes an over-boost mode to maximize acceleration in 20-second spurts, shaving a couple tenths off each model’s sprint. Still, some rivals’ sportiest variants are even quicker (based on manufacturer-estimated acceleration times).\n\nAdaptive shock absorbers are optional, as are air springs. Our car had both, and ride quality was palpably firmer with the shocks adjusted to their sportiest settings (again, there’s a driver-selectable button). Overall ride quality is firm but controlled, though uneven pavement can chuck the Macan around a bit; a longer wheelbase might sort through that more easily. Still, the chassis feels exceptionally rigid, handling bumps with virtually no reverberation. I drove a Mercedes-Benz GLC-Class a couple weeks prior, and the GLC bounced around significantly more over the same stretches of road.\n\nSteering and handling remain towering strengths for the Macan. Turn-in is quick without feeling twitchy, and steering feedback is excellent through full turns. Despite that, turning the wheel requires relatively little effort at parking-lot speeds, a characteristic befitting an SUV. The Macan we drove had 20-inch wheels (18s to 21s are available) with Michelin Pilot Alpin 5 winter tires, which served up impressive grip. As such, the SUV seldom understeered, and the rear end was responsive — but not overeager — to progressive application of power through sweeping curves to help rotate the car. Equally impressive was the Macan’s powerful braking, though our test car’s hardware exhibited some squealing at low speeds.\n\nLastly, it’s worth noting that our vehicle performed so well even without Porsche’s optional rear-axle torque vectoring system or two ascending levels of higher-performance brakes.\n\nApps & Aesthetics\n\nThe current generation of the Macan dates back to early 2014, with only minor updates since, but there’s an upside to its age: the absence of touch-sensitive controls, a maddening development in more-recent redesigns of the Panamera and Cayenne. Still, many editors found the Macan’s center console’s sea of physical buttons and tiny backlit indicators hard to sort through, and some options (separate fan directions for the passenger?) seemed unnecessary.\n\nA 10.9-inch touchscreen is standard. App-based pairing through the Macan’s Porsche Connect account facilitates Amazon Music and Nest smart-home coordination. Wireless Apple CarPlay is available but Android Auto is not, and the touchscreen confines CarPlay to just 7 diagonal inches of undersized icons and text. (We’ve found this a frequent problem with supersized touchscreens from brands of all stripes, but some automakers have managed to solve it.) The Macan’s four standard USB ports are now Type-C for 2020; multimedia options range from wireless smartphone charging to in-car Wi-Fi and premium audio from Bose or Burmester.\n\nPorsche loyalists will defend it as a brand aesthetic, but the Macan’s interior feels antiseptic. No materials or controls are downright cheap, but it’s missing the generous padding and stitched trim that enliven other luxury interiors. Of course, some of that changes if you spend more money, as Porsche can wrap everything from the dashboard to the seat bases in leather.\n\nSUV… ish\n\nUnfortunately, no amount of money can fix the Macan’s practical limitations. The cabin is cramped, hard to see out of and starved of much driver-accessible storage space. The front seats have limited rearward adjustment range, overly firm bolsters and too much lumbar support — and that was with our test car’s normal seat bolstering, not the Macan’s optional sport seats. Festooned with buttons, the center console limits knee clearance and offers precious little storage space. Behind all that, the backseat has minimal legroom and no seating adjustments.\n\nAll that said, compact luxury SUVs aren’t particularly gifted in any of these areas, so the Macan is hardly an outlier. But it doesn’t need to be this way: The Volvo XC60, a walkaway winner in Cars.com’s latest compact luxury SUV comparison, has visibility, storage and seating space in spades.\n\nSome redemption comes in the Macan’s cargo area. Porsche quotes 17.6 cubic feet of volume behind the rear seats. Manufacturer-quoted cargo specs are generally an unreliable statistic industrywide, but our measurements (in accordance with Cars.com’s latest methodology for measuring luggage room) found 18.0 cubic feet. That’s a stone’s throw from Porsche’s figures, and not too shabby for a compact SUV.\n\nSafety & Value\n\nLike many Porsche models, the Macan has not been crash-tested by a major U.S. institution. Standard features include lane-departure warning but not forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, which Porsche instead bundles with optional adaptive cruise control. Given the importance and widespread standardization of automatic braking, it’s unacceptable that a luxury vehicle in 2020 would make it optional, not standard. (It’s standard in a Toyota Corolla, for Pete’s sake.)\n\nThe Macan’s available adaptive cruise control can function all the way to a stop, but lane-centering steering (again, a widespread feature these days) is unavailable. Surround-view cameras are optional, as are adaptive (swiveling) headlights with automatic high-beams.\n\nPricing starts at $52,250 (all figures include destination), a bit steep when many alternatives start in the mid-$40,000s with AWD. Standard features on the Macan include eight-way power seats trimmed in a mix of leather and Alcantara fabric, plus a power liftgate, LED exterior lights, 18-inch alloy wheels, three-zone climate control and lane-departure warning. Curiously, some features that are standard in many mass-market cars remain optional here. For example, our test car stickered at $74,840 and we still had to put the key into the ignition. Porsche’s keyless access system remains an extra-cost option, even on an $84,950 Macan Turbo.\n\nKeyless access is among scores of available options that can raise the price of even a base Macan into six-figure territory. Go to town on a Macan Turbo, and the price can top $150,000. The good news? Most examples don’t reach such stratospheres. Of the new 2020 Macan SUVs on Cars.com, nearly 60% are listed at or below $70,000. For every Macan shopper springing for custom metallic paint ($11,430) or matching cabin trim (another $1,890), many more are keeping a tight rein on the options.\n\nEven at such prices, the Macan remains a clear choice for those who value driving fun above all else. If your needle swings even partway to practicality, however, there are better choices elsewhere.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in February 2016 about the 2016 Porsche Macan, but little has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2017, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nPorsche has been more than just a “car” maker for years, since the introduction of its wildly popular Cayenne midsize SUV. The compact Macan is a smaller, more affordable SUV introduced to the Porsche lineup for 2015.\n\nSmaller doesn’t mean cheap, though, and the Macan doesn’t exactly have an apples-to-apples competitor, which makes it an interesting little SUV. The 340-horsepower Macan S starts at $53,595 including destination — a hefty sum compared to the similarly sized BMW X4 and Land Rover Range Rover Evoque, which are as much as $11,125 less expensive. A 400-hp Macan Turbo starts at $74,895, and the well-equipped-but-not-loaded Macan S I tested totaled $69,455 — closer to the cost of midsize coupe-inspired SUVs such as the BMW X6 and Mercedes-Benz GLE450 AMG Coupe.\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nThe Macan’s resemblance to Porsche’s sports cars helps its curb appeal. The rear is wide and curvy, like the 911, and its headlight styling is borrowed from the Porsche 918 hybrid supercar. The tires are staggered in width, with wider rubber in back giving the Macan a poised stance — as well as handling that’s more similar to a sports car than a family SUV. The optional RS Spyder wheels ($1,650) on our Macan S measured 20 inches and wore Michelin Latitude Tour HP tires sized 265/45R20 up front and a sports-coupe-like 295/40R20 in back.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nJust because only one Macan is called “Turbo” doesn’t mean the others aren’t turbocharged. Under the hood of a Macan S is a twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 making 340 hp, mated to a seven-speed, dual-clutch automatic transmission and all-wheel drive. The engine is extremely well-mannered for a turbocharged engine, with power delivery so finely tuned and linear that most people won’t be able to tell the difference between it and a high-horsepower, naturally aspirated V-6.\n\nAcceleration is quick in the S, but not pin-you-to-your-seat fast; if that’s what you’re looking for, check out the 400-hp Macan Turbo. Still, Porsche’s signature exhaust symphony burbles through the tailpipes and sounds strikingly similar to any one of Porsche’s coupes. The standard exhaust system adjusts to deliver a more noticeable growl during higher engine loads and in Sport mode.\n\nNot all’s good in the neighborhood: There’s a slight lag in initial accelerator response when accelerating from a stop, even in Sport mode. The delay isn’t very Porsche-like, and it’s annoying when you want to move from a stop with vigor. One area in which there isn’t much delay is the seven-speed, dual-clutch automatic transmission’s shifts. This Porsche Doppelkupplung transmission shifts unbelievably quickly, with 911-like levels of shifting action in automatic mode and from the steering-wheel-mounted paddles.\n\nThe Macan S blends sharp handling and respectable ride quality, similar to the 911. The excellent road feel transmitted through the steering wheel, along with the balanced handling, provide a level of confidence that’s fitting for Porsche and far superior to even the sportiest X4 xDrive35i M Sport. It’s also nimble and more composed than a larger X6. Compare the Macan with the BMW and Land Rover Range Rover Evoque here.\n\nGiven the Macan’s size, its EPA-estimated gas mileage is unimpressive at 17/23/19 mpg city/highway/combined. That’s closer to the larger BMW X6 xDrive35i (18/24/20 mpg) and GLE450 AMG Coupe (17/23/20 mpg) than it is to the X4’s 19/27/22 mpg and the Evoque’s 21/30/24 mpg.\n\nThe Macan’s sport-tuned suspension is never uncomfortable like the rough-riding BMW, though I wouldn’t call the Macan “comfortable”; our test car had standard coil springs and fixed-firmness shock absorbers. But a slightly busy ride at highway speeds is a completely fair tradeoff for how well the Macan handles, and a little body motion in aggressive cornering doesn’t take away too much from its dynamic personality. Adaptive shock absorbers with coil springs and an air suspension are options if you want to improve ride/handling characteristics.\n\nIn typical Porsche fashion, you can add another $16,000 in performance options to the Macan S if you want, including carbon-ceramic brakes, the aforementioned upgraded suspensions, a torque-vectoring function for enhanced cornering rotation, sport exhaust and more.\n\nInterior\n\nInterior styling is purely performance-minded. Our test car was equipped with optional red and black leather, red accent stitching and aluminum accents. Porsche’s signature center-mounted tachometer has a huge presence over any other gauge; it’s a testament to the Macan’s driver-oriented nature.\n\nInterior quality is top-notch for a “baby” Porsche SUV, and our test car was filled with $12,000 of convenience and media options, including blind spot monitoring, a heated steering wheel, heated and cooled seats, heated rear seats, a panoramic moonroof, navigation and a Bose stereo. About that heated steering wheel: The on/off button is hidden behind the wheel, in the bottom spoke. It’s nearly impossible to find without consulting the owner’s manual or getting a pointer from someone in the know.\n\nBrightly colored red sport seats hug your sides like good all-purpose sport seats should, with supportive bolstering and enough lower-back padding to make long drives doable. With how little room they have, backseat passengers may not be as happy to spend long drives in the Macan. There’s a big hump in the middle of the floor, and the panoramic roof cuts headroom. At 6 feet tall, I felt shoehorned into the backseat. There’s significantly more room in the larger X6 and GLE450 AMG, which you can compare with the Macan here.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nAnother signature Porsche interior characteristic is a massive center console littered with buttons — not only for typical controls such as Sport mode or heated seats, but also independent buttons for each available airflow direction for the climate system. Sure, why not? It’s actually not a bad setup. I acclimated to the layout quickly and appreciated having buttons at my fingertips for functions that are normally hidden within layers upon layers of touch-screen menus.\n\nThe Macan’s standard multimedia system features a 7-inch touch-screen and 70-plus physical buttons that litter the interior. Navigation is optional; it’s cryptically called Porsche Communication Management and comes in the $2,990 Infotainment Package. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto aren’t available on the 2016 Macan, but CarPlay will debut on the 2017 Macan GTS. Other options include just about everything under the sun — including a fire extinguisher and two optional stereos. The standard 11-speaker stereo features a USB input with iPod connectivity. It’s replaceable with a 14-speaker Bose stereo for $1,400 or an even higher-end, 16-speaker Burmester system for $5,690. The mid-level Bose is decent enough but doesn’t stand out in any particular way for its hefty price.\n\nCargo & Storage\n\nThe small-interior theme continues in cargo and storage space. A center console overrun with buttons doesn’t leave room for extra storage, and there are just two cupholders and a small, square-shaped, shallow storage bin under the center armrest. The BMW X4 and X6 at least provide a nifty sliding cover over their cupholders to store loose items, and the GLE-Class coupe has a separate cubby area for phones and other items.\n\nLuggage space behind the Macan’s 40/20/40-split folding backseat is a small 17.7 cubic feet that’s deep but narrow, and the aggressively sloped roofline doesn’t provide much room for taller objects. Cargo space is more similar to a Mercedes-Benz GLA-Class (17.2 cubic feet) or BMW X4 (17.7 cubic feet) than to the roomier X6 (26.6 cubic feet) or GLE-Class coupe (23 cubic feet).\n\nSafety\n\nThe Macan had not been crash-tested as of publication. Available safety systems include blind spot monitoring, called Lane Change Assist, and Lane Keeping Assist, which automatically nudges the vehicle after it veers from a lane. A backup camera is also optional and comes with front and rear parking sensors. Also cryptically named, Porsche Active Safe is the Macan’s forward collision warning system with autonomous braking. It pairs with adaptive cruise control for $1,440. See all the Macan’s safety features here, and check out how well child-safety seats fit in the Macan in the Car Seat Check.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nThe Macan’s combination of small size, high price, sports-car-like handling and luxurious interior make it a genuinely unique compact luxury SUV. The bulk of Macans in Cars.com’s national inventory are more expensive than similarly sized X4s or Evoques. The X4 xDrive35i with a 300-hp, turbocharged six-cylinder starts at $50,695, and an entry-level Evoque SE is $42,470. At that price, though, you get only 240 hp, making it far less of a performance buy.\n\nThe Macan S starts at $53,595, though most in our inventory are between $65,000 and $70,000, while most X4s and Evoques list closer to $50,000 to $55,000. Shoppers may see larger coupe-inspired luxury SUVs, like the midsize BMW X6 (starts at $61,595) or Mercedes-Benz GLE450 AMG Coupe ($66,025) as closer competitors, considering the cost to get into one is closer to what it will likely take to buy a Macan.\n\nThe Macan S is at a size disadvantage compared with the GLE450 and the X6 in terms of both cargo space and backseat room, but it manages to not feel overpriced for its small size. The as-tested cost of the Macan S we drove, $69,455, wasn’t offensive given its impressive quality, performance and distinctive Porsche flair. Year-end sales placed the Macan as the No. 2 best-selling model in Porsche’s lineup for 2015, behind the Cayenne SUV.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Porsche’s bestseller, the Macan, gets a new T trim that brings tighter handling to the market’s sportiest compact crossover.\n\nVersus the competition: You’ll pay for better handling and some exclusive trim, but extra speed isn’t part of the deal; the Macan T isn’t slow, but competitors might be a bit quicker for this kind of coin.\n\nAll Porsches are, to some extent, sporty vehicles — it’s the nature of the brand, and it’s baked that enthusiast bent into all its offerings, from the biggest Cayenne SUV to the cheapest, no-options 718 Cayman coupe. Porsche’s “T” moniker had previously been exclusive to the brand’s 718 and 911 coupes, denoting a trim that brings extra handling prowess to a model without adding any extra power. You get some suspension tuning, unique styling changes and exclusive upholstery inside, but the engine remains untouched. T trims are meant to combine efficiency with sporty handling enjoyment, but Porsche’s SUVs have never gotten one — until now. The first-ever Macan T is the newest sporty trim of Porsche’s bestselling vehicle, and we spent a week with one to see if amping up the Macan’s handling prowess (but not its base engine) has led to a vehicle worth the extra money you’ll pay for it. \n\nRelated: 2024 Porsche Panamera: 4 Things We’re Excited For\n\nLooks a Little Different — But Only a Little\n\nPorsche likes to give customers minor styling tweaks between trim levels, which is appreciated but can be hard to follow unless you’re a true Porschephile who makes a point to memorize what every trim looks like. The Macan T comes with trim-exclusive Agate Grey Metallic painted front trim, side mirrors, side blade elements, roof spoiler and rear logos. Its tailpipes and side window greenhouse trim are gloss black, and there’s a “Macan T” logo in black on the gray side blades. The standard wheels are 20-inch Macan S wheels, but they’re painted an exclusive dark titanium. \n\nThe look is subtle, and unless you’re a hardcore Porsche aficionado, you’re not likely to spot anything special about this version of the Macan. It’s just as sporty and aggressive as the rest of the lineup, and its 20-inch wheels fill out the wheel wells better than the 19-inch ones on lesser Macan trims. Of its competitors, perhaps only the Maserati Grecale or Range Rover Velar can really rival the Macan T for style. The Lexus NX is odd, the BMW X3 is derivative, and the Mercedes-Benz GLC and Audi Q5 are both rather boring. But this Porsche has obvious, direct styling lineage that connects it to the rest of Porsche’s lineup, and that’s a good thing. \n\nRelated Video:\n\nTight Vs. Cozy\n\nSlide into the driver’s seat of the Macan and you’ll feel more like you’re sitting in a tall hatchback than a true SUV. It’s not a high vehicle, maintaining a bit of a low-slung layout for the sake of a proper center of gravity (the lower the better in a performance vehicle). As a result, the Macan doesn’t have the kind of seating position that other SUVs are known for. It kind of makes you feel better about it being a Porsche-branded SUV; many purists still chafe at the idea of any Porsche even having four doors, much less Porsche making an SUV. The cabin has many of the design cues of the rest of the Porsche lineup; it most closely resembles the Panamera, with a wide center console, a flat panel dashboard and traditional round gauges (even if there are only three, and two of them are digital). \n\nSome may describe the cabin as cozy, but others will call it tight, likely depending on how much you want your Porsche SUV to feel like a Porsche sports car. It’s a good reminder that this is very much a compact crossover, and it doesn’t even fall on the larger side of that class. The front seats are small, firm and more bolstered than you’ll find in most compact, luxury-brand SUVs this side of an Alfa Romeo Stelvio. The backseat isn’t endowed with an abundance of legroom, either; it might be a challenge for a young family. For young, childless couples or style-conscious single buyers, however, it should be a pretty good fit. Cargo room is adequate for the class, but again, this is a compact crossover — don’t expect to go on cross-country road trips with luggage for a family of four. For one or two people, though, it’s adequate. \n\nPerhaps more importantly, the Macan is definitely well made. Materials quality is excellent, and the unique upholstery that’s exclusive to the T trim is a classy, sophisticated mix of fabric and leather. The dash is stitched, as are the door trim and seats, and it all looks racy and upscale in a way that befits the Macan T’s price. Where the cabin falls down is in the controls, which are almost entirely touch-sensitive panels on the dash and center console. It’s not only difficult to select what you meant to on both the center console (due to its flat angle and reflective nature) and touchscreen, but the touchscreen itself gets a bit confusing. Both interfaces require more attention than you should give while driving the vehicle — and they accumulate a lot of fingerprints in the process. \n\nThe reconfigurable gauges, however, are fun, allowing you to choose from a variety of displays in the gauge cluster itself. There are only three round display areas rather than the five seen in Porsche’s coupes and sedans, and only the right-most one is digital. The left physical gauge is a speedometer and the central one is a tachometer — a good fit for a sports car brand. Even with just three gauges, you won’t be complaining about a lack of information; the reconfigurable digital gauge provides just about any information you could need about the vehicle. \n\nOf special note is the steering wheel itself: It’s on the small side, and the rim is thinner than you’ll find in many vehicles these days, but it’s a winning combination for a sport-oriented vehicle. Unlike some automakers that have gone a little nuts with chunky steering wheels (looking at you, Dodge), this compact, easy-to-handle and comfortable tiller is perfect for the sporting nature of the Macan T. It fit easily in my hands, and that went a long way toward conveying this wasn’t a typical SUV.\n\nPlenty of Zoot, Not Too Much Scoot\n\nOut on the road, it becomes clear that the Macan T is not just about sporty looks; it has the goods to provide a legitimately entertaining driving experience. That’s not something most compact crossovers can do; most of them are just commuter machines unfit for sporting antics. But the Macan T’s wagon/tall-hatchback nature shines through dynamically: It feels low, planted and very eager to change directions. This becomes obvious within the first few hundred yards of taking off from a parking space, thanks to outstanding steering feel and feedback, firm and communicative brake feel, and ride quality that’s indicative of Porsche’s magic. The Porsche Active Suspension Management system is standard on the Macan T, and optional equipment includes both an adaptive air suspension (which brings stiffer anti-roll bars) and Porsche Torque Vectoring Plus traction management. All of it is designed to improve the agility and responsiveness of the Macan’s handling characteristics. Somehow, the company always manages to make something that’s an incredible mix of both beautifully damped and responsive and well controlled. You feel the suspension working in a Porsche, but you don’t feel bothered by it. \n\nThe one area that didn’t get attention when transforming the base Macan into a Macan T is the engine. It’s a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder making 261 horsepower and 295 pounds-feet of torque, and it’s mated to a standard seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission that directs that power to all four wheels. The Macan T also includes the Sport Chrono Package, which brings a chronometer atop the dashboard and a few extra goodies to the tuning. It’s all good for a 0-60 mph scoot of 5.8 seconds, according to Porsche — not what most would call quick. By contrast, step up to the Macan S and its twin-turbocharged 2.9-liter V-6, and you’ll get 375 hp and knock more than a second off that 0-60 time. The Macan T’s smaller, lighter engine does reportedly lighten the load on the front axle by a not-insignificant 129 pounds, however, which helps handling balance, turn-in and overall agility. \n\nIn terms of performance, the Macan T’s four-cylinder is … adequate. You won’t be lighting the world on fire — it’s actually less powerful than a base Dodge Hornet GT that costs half as much. Acceleration is reasonably brisk, and the seven-speed transmission shifts quickly and smoothly. It’s also a bit more responsive when you activate a sport mode, or when you punch a special button on the steering wheel that turns everything up to its maximum sportiness for 30 seconds — a useful feature for making highway on-ramps much more fun. But the point of the Macan T isn’t pure speed; it’s about agility and value, and combined with the suspension improvements and a lighter front end than the quicker (but heavier and more expensive) higher trim levels, it’s clear the Macan T hits its mark. This thing is aimed at drivers who want an enthusiast vehicle that gets decent fuel economy and doesn’t cost an arm and a leg, but that can still provide more smiles per mile than something more mundane. It’s sharper than its BMW and Lexus competitors, it’s more of a style statement than its related Audi cousin, and it has the athletic abilities to compete with something like the Alfa Romeo Stelvio, which also outguns and outruns most competitors but doesn’t have quite the level of interior quality that the Porsche does.\n\nMore from Cars.com:\n\n2024 Porsche Panamera Revealed, Redesigned and Tech-Rich\nIs the 2024 Porsche Cayenne S a Good SUV? 4 Pros and 3 Cons\n2024 Porsche Cayenne S E-Hybrid Completes SUV’s Hybrid Lineup\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto: Where Are They Now?\nIs the Porsche Taycan Cross Turismo Turbo S a Good EV? 6 Pros, 3 Cons\nOptions Get Pricey, But That’s So Porsche\n\nJust like every Porsche, you’ll pay for extras in the Macan T. This car starts at $68,150 (including destination), but even at that price, the standard Macan T doesn’t have power seats, keyless touch entry (gotta use the fob), a panoramic roof, lane departure steering assist or a premium audio system. Of course, all of these features are available in various packages or as stand-alone options, along with myriad color and trim additions that will quickly raise the price. But if you keep your fingers off all the various selections, you can end up with my test car: a basic version with the addition of pretty much only the air suspension, torque vectoring, a Bose audio system and a 360-degree camera system for a little over $70,000. It’s a lot for a compact crossover, but not for a luxury-branded one even though it’s as much as $10,000-$20,000 more than comparably equipped and capable competitors. That’s the Porsche premium, and people seem perfectly comfortable paying it. Go really nuts with the options list, though, and you’ll see just how quickly that premium can climb.\n\nAt the price of the Macan T I drove, this vehicle provides an enjoyable driving experience that you won’t find in most other crossovers, plus excellent styling, a top-notch interior and reasonable comfort — not to mention the prestige that comes with the brand name. \n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Whether a certain segment of Porsche enthusiasts like it or not, the German performance brand’s bestselling vehicle is the Macan compact SUV. Offering a sportier driving experience than its competitors, along with seating for five in an elegant interior, the Macan’s lineup was expanded with a new T trim for the 2023 model year that further sharpens the SUV’s handling while also adding subtle styling tweaks and features. (Little changes for 2024.)\n\nRelated: 2023 Porsche Macan T Review: Sportier Doesn’t Always Mean Faster\n\nPreviously offered only on Porsche’s 718 and 911 coupes, the T trim adds exclusive cosmetic bits, including gloss-black exhaust tips and a dark gray roof spoiler, side mirrors and other accents. You also get larger, dark gray 20-inch wheels that are not available on the base trim level, along with suspension enhancements. What isn’t part of the package is more power than the base version.\n\nCars.com Detroit Bureau Chief Aaron Bragman spent a week with the latest addition to the Macan lineup, and you can get all the details of how that went by tapping the link above. For a quicker rundown, here are five things we like about the Porsche Macan T and three things we’re not so excited about.\n\nThings We Like\n2023 Porsche Macan T | Cars.com photo by Aaron Bragman\n1. Distinctive Style\n\nOnly the most devoted Porschephiles are likely to notice the subtle styling differences that set the Macan T apart from other trims. But the restrained use of dark trim and larger 20-inch wheels in place of the 19-inch wheels on lesser trims lend a bit more aggressive look to further separate the Macan from competitors that include the Audi Q5, BMW X3 and Mercedes-Benz GLC.\n\n2. Built for the Twisties\n\nThe Macan sits closer to the pavement than an average SUV, which helps lower the center of gravity for better handling. The Macan T takes things a step further, adding an adaptive suspension that helps deliver more agility and responsiveness without a penalty in ride comfort. Terrific steering feel and braking performance are part of the package, as well. And if that’s not enough, an adaptive air suspension with stiffer anti-roll bars is available.\n\n3. Cozy Cabin\n\nThe cabin is not what most people would consider overly spacious, but it offers decent room up front and is extremely well made with top-quality materials. The front seats are firm and aggressively bolstered, and the Macan T gets an exclusive combination of fabric and leather upholstery with contrast stitching on the dash, doors and seats. The rear seat is not as spacious, but cargo room is decent for a compact SUV.\n\n4. Informative Instrumentation\n\nThe three big dials in front of the driver offer a clean, informative design that’s appropriate for a vehicle with sporting intentions. The layout includes a conventional speedometer and tachometer, as well as a reconfigurable digital gauge that can provide a variety of information.\n\n5. Boost Button\n\nThe Macan T gets a couple of tricks up its sleeve to maximize power from its turbocharged four-cylinder engine. A sport mode provides increased powertrain response, while a steering-wheel button can really crank things up for 30 seconds to make highway on-ramps that much more entertaining.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2024 Porsche Macan EV Up Close: Undercover EV\n2025 Porsche Cayenne GTS Gets 493 Horsepower, Starts at $126,895\n2022 Porsche Macan: 4 Things to Know About the Refreshed Compact SUV\nResearch the Porsche Macan\nFind Your Next Car\nThings We Don’t Like\n2023 Porsche Macan T | Cars.com photo by Aaron Bragman\n1. Touch Controls\n\nPorsche opted to forgo physical controls almost entirely in the Macan T in favor of touch-sensitive surfaces on the center screen and console. Both require taking your eyes off the road more than physical controls, and the center console buttons are small and easily washed out in bright sunlight. The dark, glossy surfaces also tend to get covered in fingerprints.\n\n2. No Added Zoot\n\nThe Macan T gets by with the same 261-horsepower, turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine and seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission used in the base trim. While not exactly a slouch, it’s 0-60 mph acceleration time of 5.8 seconds is not particularly quick by current standards. The trade-off is a savings of 129 pounds over the front wheels compared to the V-6 of the Macan S, which helps with balance and agility.\n\n3. Pricey Extras\n\nIn typical Porsche fashion, you have to pay extra for some features often found as standard equipment with other vehicles. The base price for 2024 starts at $68,150 (including destination), but it doesn’t include things like power seats, keyless touch entry, lane departure warning or a moonroof. All of these are available, of course, and the a la carte menu enables buyers to keep the price down by skipping features not desired.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The Porsche Macan Electric is evolving rapidly. After two new powertrain options were added for the 2025 model year, the electric version of the Porsche compact SUV is getting a wide range of tech updates for 2026, just its third year on sale.\n\nRelated: 2024 Porsche Macan EV Up Close: Undercover EV\n\nWhat’s New\n\nStarting with standard equipment, the 2026 Macan Electric’s infotainment system:\n\nAdds artificial-intelligence-enhanced voice control to better respond to occupant commands.\nNow allows drivers to prioritize specific charging stations or provider networks for easier charging on longer trips via the Porsche Charging Planner.\nCan spice up charging (for the driver) or road trips (for passengers) via in-car gaming, with titles from Gameloft and Obscure Interactive controlled through the touchscreens, mobile devices or Bluetooth gaming controller. Passengers are able to compete against each other in the games on separate screens.\n\nPorsche also updated the Macan Electric’s automated parking tech with a newly available add-on package. Trained Parking grants equipped vehicles the ability to learn specific maneuvers for entering up to five commonly used parking spaces, and Reversing Assist allows them to reverse up to 160 feet along routes it has previously driven forward. Additionally, the Porsche Digital Key now allows owners to use their smartphone or Apple Watch as a vehicle key.\n\nRelease Date and Pricing\n\nPorsche is taking orders for the 2026 Macan Electric now, with deliveries scheduled to begin in spring 2026. Full line pricing, including a whopping $2,350 destination charge, is as follows:\n\nMacan Electric: $80,350\nMacan 4 Electric: $83,950\nMacan 4S Electric: $90,350\nMacan Turbo Electric: $111,850\nTrim Levels\n\nAside from their electric motors, the base Macan Electric, 4 Electric and 4S Electric are nearly identical. All three ride on adaptive air suspension with 20-inch wheels and boast adaptive LED headlights, daytime running lights and taillights, a panoramic moonroof, and keyless entry and starting. Their cabins are upholstered in leather and feature heated and eight-way power-adjustable front seats, a heated steering wheel with a manually adjustable column, dual-zone automatic climate control, a digital instrument panel, wireless phone charging, 10 speakers and a touchscreen infotainment system with navigation. The 4S gets red brake calipers and larger front rotors.\n\nThe Macan Turbo Electric gains a lot more than just additional power for its $21,500 premium over the 4S. It includes an electronically controlled locking rear differential with torque vectoring, still-larger front brakes and upgraded LED headlights. Inside, it sports unique exterior and interior trim including a synthetic suede headliner, 18-way power front seats, four-zone automatic climate control, a 14-speaker Bose audio system and a power-adjustable steering column.\n\nRead More Porsche EV News:\n\n2024 Porsche Macan EV Gets Taycan-Style Makeover, Up to 630 HP\nPorsche Joins Black Parade With 2026 Taycan Black Edition\nPorsche Charging Service Adds Locations, In-App Payments for ChargePoint Stations\n2025 Porsche Taycan Turbo S Up Close: We Go Skin-Deep\nPorsche Cayenne to Soon Get EV Powertrain\nStandard and Available Safety Features\n\nIt’s much the same story with safety technology: The entry-level, 4 and 4S versions are fitted with the same features. Standard equipment includes forward collision warning with pedestrian and bicyclist detection, automatic emergency braking, lane departure steering assist, emergency steering assist, adaptive cruise control, front and rear parking sensors, blind spot monitors, rear cross-traffic alert and road-sign recognition.\n\nA 360-degree camera system with automated parking is optional on the base trim and Macan Electric 4 and standard on the 4S and Turbo. The new Trained Parking and Reverse Assist features are bundled with an upgraded 3D camera system that costs extra on top of the base 360-degree camera feature. A head-up display and Drive Assist hands-on semi-autonomous driving are optional on every Macan Electric variant.\n\nPowertrain Specs and Range\n\nEvery 2026 Macan Electric draws power from a 100-kilowatt-hour battery pack. Capable of DC fast charging at up to 270 kilowatts, it can replenish from 10% to 80% in as little as 21 minutes on a compatible charger, according to Porsche.\n\nOnly the base Macan Electric has a single electric motor; mounted on the rear axle, it generates 335 horsepower and 415 pounds-feet of torque. Launch control temporarily increases output to 355 hp and accelerates the EV to 60 mph in a claimed 5.4 seconds. Porsche says the entry-level variant has an EPA-rated range of 315 miles (official EPA figures for the 2026 model are not yet available).\n\nThe Macan 4 Electric adds a second, front-mounted motor for a total output of 382 hp (402 with launch control engaged) and 479 pounds-feet. It accelerates to 60 mph in 4.9 seconds and can travel up to 308 miles on a charge.\n\nIn the 4S, the motors combine to produce 442 hp (509 in launch control) and 604 pounds-feet of torque. Porsche says the 4S can hit 60 mph in 3.9 seconds and that it has a range of 288 miles — less with frequent 3.9-second 0-60 mph sprints.\n\nThe Macan Turbo Electric produces a 911-esque nominal 576 hp (630 with launch control). Its 833 pounds-feet fling it from 0-60 in a scant 3.1 seconds and through the quarter-mile in just 11.4 seconds. Keep a light foot on the accelerator, though, and you can achieve the same 288-mile range as the 4S.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Key Points in This Review:\n\nThe Porsche Macan Electric successfully transposes Porsche’s signature characteristics onto the platform of an electric compact SUV.\nThe Macan Electric’s strong points include its athletic driving personality, a nicely finished cabin and a high level of configurability, but you’ll pay plenty for those virtues.\nThe Macan Electric’s cramped backseat and small cargo area mean it isn’t the most practical electric SUV.\n\nThe Porsche Macan Electric compact SUV debuted for 2024 as the second all-electric vehicle in Porsche’s lineup, following in the footsteps of the new-for-2020 Taycan sports sedan. Beyond its name and overall shape, the Macan Electric shares little with its gas-powered Macan sibling; it’s built on a separate electric-only platform.\n\nRelated: 2026 Porsche Macan Electric: Upgraded Driver-Assist and Tech Features, $80,350 Base Price\n\nPorsche is an enthusiast-oriented brand that built its reputation on nimble, impeccably assembled sports cars, like the beloved 911. As such, it’s judged by a slightly different standard than other luxury automakers: Namely, an engaging, high-performance driving experience is every bit as important to the traditional Porsche buyer as high-end trimmings. Porsche’s first SUV, the mid-size Cayenne, was initially controversial among enthusiasts who saw it as a dilution of the brand, though it largely won over consumers and became a sales success. The gas-engine Macan SUV was warmly received when it debuted in 2013, and the electric Taycan showed that Porsche could deliver its core characteristics in the form of an EV. So as an electric SUV, does the Porsche Macan Electric also succeed as a true Porsche?\n\nTo find out, I traveled to Aspen, Colo., at Porsche’s invitation to drive the 2025 Porsche Macan Electric. (Per our ethics policy, Cars.com pays for its own airfare and lodging when attending manufacturer-sponsored events.)\n\nRelated Video:\n\nA Genuinely Athletic Feel, Even in Base RWD Trim\nTakeaway: The base rear-wheel-drive Macan Electric doesn’t have as much horsepower as many electric SUVs, but it still delivers a satisfyingly sporty driving experience.\n\nThe Porsche Macan Electric lineup consists of a base rear-wheel-drive version and three all-wheel-drive trims, called 4, 4S and Turbo. (The base and 4S are new for 2025.) Their respective horsepower ratings are 335, 382, 442 and 576 hp, and driver-selectable launch control temporarily boosts output when accelerating from a stop.\n\nI drove only an entry-level RWD trim, which seems on paper to be at a disadvantage compared with many electric SUVs. Its 335-hp rating isn’t a lot compared with the outputs of many AWD rivals, and even with the launch control feature temporarily boosting output to 355 hp, its acceleration isn’t particularly thrilling from a stop. Like other performance-focused EVs we’ve tested, this Porsche’s power curve can plateau noticeably at speeds above 60 mph. Even so, the base Macan Electric’s acceleration is strong enough to be entertaining overall: Porsche quotes a 5.4-second 0-60 mph time with launch control, which feels accurate by the seat of my pants.\n\nThe Macan Electric’s curb weight ranges from 5,004 pounds for the RWD version to 5,393 pounds for the line-topping Turbo. It’s no featherweight (even among other compact electric SUVs), but it hides its heft well; it feels balanced and poised in fast, aggressive cornering. Its nicely tuned steering is a big plus here; it’s communicative and direct without feeling jittery or requiring lots of minute corrections.\n\nRespectable Ride Quality, Natural-Feeling Brakes\nTakeaway: The Macan Electric’s decent ride quality and natural-feeling brakes are pluses, but, unlike many EVs, Porsche doesn’t provide a one-pedal driving mode.\n\nConsidering the Macan Electric’s agility, its ride quality is sufficiently absorbent, at least on the standard 20-inch wheels and tires my test vehicle wore; 21- and 22-inch wheels are optional. An adaptive air suspension that alters both ride height and firmness via driver-selectable drive modes is standard. In the Macan Electric’s Normal drive mode, the ride is taut but never harsh, even on the rutted gravel roads that comprised a decent portion of our drive route. Sport and Sport Plus modes make the ride stiffer while delivering sharper handling.\n\nBrake-pedal feel is impressively natural and linear, which isn’t always the case in EVs. Along with its expertly tuned steering, this contributes to the Macan Electric’s engaging driving character. A selectable brake-regen mode provides a noticeable amount of regenerative braking, which I especially appreciated during the sharper descents on our mountain-road route. Unlike many EVs, however, the Macan Electric doesn’t include a one-pedal driving mode; Porsche engineers believe one-pedal driving is less natural and ultimately less efficient than letting the vehicle coast when the driver lifts off the accelerator. Fair enough, but if you happen to like the feature, know you can’t get it in a Porsche EV.\n\nInterior Is Impeccably Trimmed, But Not Particularly Spacious\nTakeaway: The Macan Electric prioritizes sporty styling over generous backseat space and cargo volume, but its cabin boasts high-quality materials and fit and finish.\n\nThe Macan Electric’s wheelbase is 3.4 inches longer than the gas-engine Macan’s, and it’s 2.24 inches longer overall, but interior room is still pretty stingy for an SUV. Its rear cargo area is smaller than most rivals’, and though there is a front trunk under its hood, it can’t accommodate much more than the charging cable’s carrying case.\n\nThe backseat is similarly cramped, especially for extra-tall occupants like me. Headroom is tight under the standard panoramic moonroof, and legroom shrinks quickly as the front seats are adjusted rearward. With the front seats adjusted to fit my 6-foot-6-inch frame, I couldn’t fit in the backseat. Even with it set for our 5-foot-11 videographer, my knees were still rubbing the back of the front seat.\n\nFront-seat space and comfort, however, is quite good. I had headroom to spare, and my test car’s 14-way power-adjustable front seats with memory (a $1,390 option) had just the right mix of comfort and support. The Macan Electric’s agreeable control layout is highlighted by a standard 12.6-inch digital gauge cluster and 10.9-inch infotainment touchscreen, both of which have clear, easy-to-read graphics. It took me a bit to acclimate to the dashboard-mounted paddle gear selector, and the SUV’s single climate-control touch panel feels a bit chintzy at the Macan Electric’s prices, but overall the controls are logically laid out and easy to use.\n\nThe Macan Electric’s cabin ambiance, on the other hand, is definitely NOT chintzy. The materials aren’t cushy or lavish, but they’re high-quality and assembled with precision — another Porsche trait that carries over uncompromised here.\n\nCompetitive Driving Range and Charging Specs\nTakeaway: The Macan Electric’s EPA-estimated driving range and Porsche’s quoted charging times put it on par with rival EVs.\n\nWe didn’t have the chance to do any charging or range testing during our one-day test drive, but the Macan Electric’s specs are competitive, especially when you factor in its performance. Its EPA-estimated driving range is 288 miles in the 4S and Turbo trims, 308 miles in the 4 and 315 miles in the base trim, which is on par with competitors.\n\nAll Macan Electric SUVs have 800-volt charging architecture, dual charging ports (the driver’s side accepts both AC and DC connectors, while the passenger side is AC-only) and a 100-kilowatt-hour battery with 95 kWh of usable capacity. Regardless of trim, the Macan Electric can be charged from 10% to 80% in 21 minutes when DC fast-charging at 270 kilowatts, according to Porsche. Earlier this month, Porsche EV owners gained access to Tesla’s Supercharger network, and while the Macan Electric doesn’t have a Tesla-style North American Charging Standard charging port, owners can get a complimentary adapter from Porsche.\n\nSteep Pricing Gets Steeper With Options\nTakeaway: Porsche isn’t known for bargain pricing, and the Macan Electric doesn’t change that.\n\nThe 2025 Porsche Macan Electric starts at $79,995 in base RWD trim and runs to $111,095 for the line-topping Turbo (prices include a $1,995 destination fee). Though that includes a passable amount of standard equipment, there’s a lot that isn’t standard — and choosing from Porsche’s smorgasbord of options can easily tack on $10,000 or more to the bottom line.\n\nMy test vehicle was finished in Gentian Blue Metallic paint ($1,290) and included add-ons like rear-axle steering ($2,110), a Sport Chrono Package ($1,020), ventilated front seats ($670), four-zone climate control ($490) and a rear wiper ($380 — but how is this not standard??). Heck, even Porsche’s Electric Sport Sound artificial powertrain sound tacked on $510. All these and more helped push our as-tested price to roughly $90,000 — and remember, this is still the base trim level. It’s not hard at all to get a Macan Electric Turbo into the $130,000 range.\n\nUpdates Coming for 2026\nTakeaway: The Macan Electric is scheduled to receive a number of tech updates for 2026, but none of them will affect its driving dynamics.\n\nAs of this writing, the 2026 Porsche Macan Electric is already on the horizon. It’s scheduled to go on sale in the spring of 2026 with slightly higher prices, a higher maximum tow rating (up to 5,500 pounds from 4,400) and a number of tech updates (which you can read about in detail here). No changes that affect how it drives are planned — which is a good thing given its driving experience is the Macan Electric’s most compelling asset. It’s a fine EV that also looks, feels and drives like a true Porsche.\n\nMore Porsche News From Cars.com:\n\nPorsche Charging Service Adds Locations, In-App Payments for ChargePoint Stations\n2025 Porsche Macan Line Expands With RWD Base Model, 4S\nIs the 2024 Porsche Macan T a Good SUV? 5 Pros, 3 Cons\nPorsche Cayenne to Soon Get EV Powertrain\nPorsche Joins Black Parade With 2026 Taycan Black Edition\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
