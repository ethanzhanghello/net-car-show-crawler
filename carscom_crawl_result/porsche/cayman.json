      "expert_review": "A new sports car from Porsche grabs the car world’s attention, with every gearhead and driving enthusiast focused on the latest sinewy creation from Stuttgart, Germany.\n\nThe news was greeted joyously when the Boxster was unveiled a decade ago. The midengine roadster harked to Porsche race cars of the ’50s, with crisp drivability and indisputable charm.\n\nThe 2006 Cayman S continues that development, with Porsche hitting all the right buttons with a gorgeous new sports coupe derived from the Boxster architecture. Cynics may look at Cayman S as an overhyped Boxster hardtop, but Cayman proves to be a lot more.\n\nPerformance rivals the base models of Porsche 911, with exceptionally balanced and responsive handling that allows Cayman S to charge through tight curves and roar away. In a tour of Arizona high country, Cayman showed off its unflappable poise, acing challenging turns and romping along narrow two-lane blacktops.\n\nPriced midway between the $45,000 Boxster and $71,300 for the 911 Carrera Coupe, Cayman is designed to round out Porsche’s offerings. But with style and performance nearing the 911, it could cannibalize sales of the company’s hallmark sports car. On the other hand, once you add on Cayman’s expensive options, the price can quickly pass 911’s base price.\n\nA less-potent, non-S Cayman was recently announced by Porsche starting at under $50,000.\n\nOf course, the key element with any Porsche is the fun factor, which Cayman delivers in spades. Great to drive and great to be seen driving.\n\nVehicle type: Two-passenger, two-door coupe, rear-wheel drive.\n\nEngine: 3.4-liter horizontally opposed 6, 295-horsepower at 6,250 rpm, 251 pound-feet torque at 4,400 rpm.\n\nTransmission: 6-speed manual.\n\nWheelbase: 95.1 inches.\n\nOverall length: 172.1 inches.\n\nCurb weight: 2,954 pounds.\n\nEPA rating: 20 city, 28 highway.\n\nHighs: Awesome handling, engine power, styling.\n\nLows: Small and fussy dash buttons, tight cockpit, pricey with options.",

      "expert_review": "The 2007 Porsche Cayman is a special-needs car. It requires a racetrack or, at least, a long stretch of road that can be used as one.\n\nThere is no other way to truly appreciate the beauty of this compact sports coupe. My associate, Ria Manglapus, and I tried. We drove it in the suburbs. We drove it in the city. Ria even used it to ferry her two sons, one at a time, to and from school. We were frustrated — totally, unequivocally.\n\n“It wants to run,” I said.\n\n“I would much prefer to drive this one on a racetrack rather than on the road,” she said.\n\nComments from an admiring public didn’t help.\n\n“Nice car,” a young man said pulling up next to me at a stoplight in the District. “Is that the new one, the base Cayman?”\n\n“Yeah,” I said, thinking that it was ironic that Porsche chose to introduce its top Cayman, the “S,” a year before it brought forth the base model that is the subject of this week’s column.\n\n“Yeah,” the young man said. “Base, huh? Yeah. Bet it still can run. You had it out to the track, yet?”\n\nI smiled and mumbled, too embarrassed to tell him that I hadn’t been anywhere near a racetrack in the Cayman — an answer that would have marked me, at best, as a Porsche newbie, a man slightly north of middle age trying to crank up life’s remaining volume. At worst, it would have unmasked me as a Porsche poseur, a person who buys a Porsche sports car just to show off, but who has no real love, understanding or appreciation of the car he or she bought.\n\nI mumbled something like “planning on going to the track this weekend,” which, at that moment, was a baldfaced lie. But the young man nodded in approval and added: “You got to take that one to the track. Only way to feel that one, my brother, is on the track.”\n\nHe was right, of course. Any Porsche lover knows that Porsche makes sports coupes and convertibles that are designed to do two things exceedingly well — run fast and take curves. Porsche lovers don’t get into discussions about fuel economy. They aren’t embarrassed by horsepower. Many of them are like my friend, Washington performance-driving instructor Miriam Schottland. They love their Porsches so much they keep them under wraps and tucked away in high-security garages . . . until track day.\n\nMiriam bought a Porsche 911, a more powerful car than the Cayman, in 1982. Almost every mile accumulated on her 911 is a track mile. She mostly gets around Washington by walking, using cabs or taking the Metro. She says: “I drive for pleasure, which is why I love putting my car on the track. But there is nothing pleasurable about driving a Porsche, or anything else, in Washington traffic.”\n\nAt the end of her turn behind the Cayman’s wheel, Ria was happy and saddened to let the car go. She loved its power, but lamented that she couldn’t use much of it in her daily commutes. She liked the looks of the hardtop Cayman coupe, but conceded that she would have preferred driving and being seen in the convertible Porsche Boxster, a car designed as much for cruising as it is for speeding. And there was the matter of the Cayman’s two seats — not a problem for Miriam with no children but a potential source of domestic warfare (who gets left behind, who doesn’t) for Ria with two.\n\nI took the keys. After lying to that District driver about my plans to take the Cayman to the track, I decided to make good on my fib by at least finding some long, lonely, winding roads to do what the Cayman wanted me to do.\n\nI found those roads in West Virginia on an early weekend morning when traffic was light and the dew was fresh. There were no egregious violations of law. But on several mountainous passes with numerous twists and turns there were delicious epiphanies, moments when I fully understood Miriam’s concept of driving pleasure.\n\nThe Cayman, equipped with a 2.7-liter, 245-horsepower flat-six engine, neatly placed near the car’s center, moves out with authority in straight-line acceleration. But its real beauty on the road reflects its eye-catching exterior design. It’s the curves, those marvelous undulations pulling you in like some macadam lover, begging you to drive a little longer, go a little farther.\n\nCurves are what the Cayman are all about — curves and racetracks, as opposed to potholed urban streets and traffic congestion. It is not a practical car. It was never meant to be. There is nothing prosaic about it. It is poetry in motion. If you can understand and accept that, you can love Cayman unconditionally.\n\nNUTS & BOLTS\n\nPorsche Cayman Complaints: The Cayman is what it is — an out-and-out sports car designed more for performance than it is for creature coddling. People who understand that don’t mind things such as its oddly placed, not terribly adequate cup holders and its lack of other cuddly amenities, such as seats that afford easy ingress and egress. People who don’t won’t buy the Cayman. Ride, acceleration and handling: You drive the Cayman and you understand the seeming lunacy of shelling out big bucks for a car that you garage until track day, or that you pilot through city congestion only to find an exciting, out-of-the-way road that’s also relatively free of traffic. It moves from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 5.8 seconds. It’s a bit grouchy in stop-and-go city traffic. But it’s an absolute handling wonder at highway speeds and around curves. Some cars stick to the road. This one passionately embraces it. Head-turning quotient: It’s the automotive definition of “hot.” Body style/layout: The Porsche Cayman is a premium compact sports coupe — hardtop with two doors and two seats — with its engine located between the car’s front wheels and its drive wheels in the rear. Engine/transmission: The tested base Porsche Cayman comes with a 2.7-liter, double-overhead cam, flat six-cylinder (horizontally opposed cylinders) engine that develops 245 horsepower at 6,500 revolutions per minute and 201 foot-pounds of torque at 4,600 revolutions per minute. That engine is mated to a wonderfully smooth, intuitive five-speed manual transmission. Capacities: There is seating for two people. Luggage capacity is 14.5 cubic feet. The fuel tank holds 16.9 gallons of required — no substitution, please — premium unleaded gasoline. Mileage: Actually, pretty good, considering the Cayman’s road-devouring performance. We averaged 26 miles per gallon in combined city/highway driving. Safety: Antilock brakes, side and head air bags, electronic traction and stability control are all standard. Price: Base price on the tested 2007 base-model Porsche Cayman is $49,400. Porsche has not published a dealer’s invoice price for that model, but industry sources put it at $43,000. Price as tested is $52,255 including $1,960 in mostly cosmetic options and a $795 destination charge. Estimated dealer’s invoice price with options and transportation fee is $46,100. The retail pricing information was provided by Porsche and www.edmunds.com. Purse-strings note: This is an iconographic deal. If you want a Porsche sports car, nothing else will do. Porsche is Porsche. If you want to comparison shop in the generic compact sports car category, try these: BMW Z4, Chevrolet Corvette, 2007 Mercedes-Benz CLK Class.",

      "expert_review": "The redesigned 2014 Porsche Cayman is more luxurious than its predecessor, but performance-car purists will lament its diluted steering feel.\n\nThe Cayman is Porsche’s entry-level coupe, if you can call a car that starts at $53,550 (including a $950 destination charge) entry-level. Unlike the iconic rear-engine 911, the Cayman is a mid-engined car like the Boxster, its soft-top convertible sibling.\n\nThe all-new 2014 Cayman weighs less and is more efficient than its predecessor, and power is up slightly. It also gets a richer interior. To see the 2014 model’s specs compared with the 2012 (the Cayman skipped the 2013 model year), click here.\n\nWe tested a manual-transmission Cayman S, which comes with a more powerful flat-6 engine rated at 325 horsepower. This trim level starts at $64,750, including destination, but our car’s as-tested price ballooned to $89,915 with options like a high-end Burmester stereo and navigation ($6,730), Porsche Active Suspension Management ($1,790), 20-inch Carrera Classic wheels ($2,730) and an upgraded Natural Leather Seats ($3,895), to name a few.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe prior-generation Porsche Cayman had exceptional steering feedback, which made it a joy to drive. That car used conventional hydraulic power steering, but the 2014 model switches to electric power steering. Porsche says this improves fuel efficiency and “provides direct feedback … while filtering out unpleasant or unnecessary surface irregularities.” The way the old car’s steering communicated everything about the road surface was what made it so magical, but a lot of that magic is now gone, which is a shame.\n\nThe 2014 Porsche Cayman’s steering wheel has a nice heft to it in corners, but it’s numb when traveling straight and lacks the direct, connected sensation that delighted your fingertips before. Body roll is minimal and the car feels planted, but it’s less enjoyable to drive with the new steering setup. Selecting the Sport Plus mode in our tester made the wheel seem a little weightier, but the difference is minor.\n\nWith optional Porsche Active Suspension Management, an adaptive suspension system, ride quality is livable for daily commuting — even with optional 20-inch alloy wheels and low-profile tires. The ride is firm in Normal mode, but it wasn’t punishing on Chicago’s post-winter roads, many of which were rutted and crumbling. Ride quality takes on a harder edge when you press the Sport Plus button.\n\nThe engine in the Cayman S remains one of the car’s highlights. The mid-mounted flat-six is smooth and accelerates the coupe forcefully; Porsche cites a zero-to-60-mph time of 4.7 seconds with the six-speed manual transmission. We liked the sounds this engine makes, too; performance cars traditionally emphasize exhaust sounds, but the overriding sound from the Cayman is an ever-present whirring noise right behind your head.\n\nThe manual transmission’s clutch pedal and shifter have a weighty feel. It takes a firm foot to press the clutch in and a deliberate hand to change gears, but the setup feels right for this car. It’s also an improvement over the previous Cayman’s stick shift, which felt a little vague when going through the gears. Reverse is up and to the left, next to 1st gear, and one editor didn’t like that there wasn’t a lockout feature to prevent you from accidentally choosing it.\n\nFuel-saving stop-start technology is new to the Cayman for 2014. It caught me off guard a few times because I thought I’d stalled the car, when in reality the engine had turned off automatically to save gas at a stop.\n\nIn the manual-transmission Porsche Cayman, when the car is stationary the engine can shut off when the transmission is in Neutral and you’ve released the clutch pedal. The engine restarts as you press the clutch in, so the car will be ready to go when you are. As stop-start systems go, this one is relatively seamless, but it’s still annoying to hear the engine restart again and again. A button on the center console deactivates the system.\n\nFor a sports car, the Cayman S’ fuel economy estimates have always been good, and they’re even better for 2014, through the mileage soes differ between the manual and PDK transmissions. The 3.4-liter V-6 gets an EPA-estimated 21/30/24 mpg city/highway/combined with the seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission (which Porsche calls PDK) and 20/28/23 mpg with the manual. The combined rating for both is 1 mpg higher than before. I got about 20 mpg in our manual-transmission test car in mixed suburban and highway driving. Manual-transmission versions of competitors like the 2014 BMW M235i and 2014 Lotus Evora are rated 19/28/23 mpg and 18/26/21 mpg, respectively, and the automatic-only 2015 Jaguar F-Type coupe gets 20/28/23 mpg; to see these cars compared with the Cayman S, click here.\n\nInterior\nThe cabin might look small from the outside, but the two-seat Cayman can comfortably carry taller people. I’m 6 feet 1 inch tall, and I easily found a comfortable driving position. Our test car had 14-way power-adjustable sport bucket seats, a $2,320 option, and their firm cushioning provided good support without being uncomfortably hard. The side bolsters hold you in place in corners, too.\n\nGetting in and out of the car — even if you’re relatively nimble — is a challenge. You have to get low to get inside, and getting out is an awkward process that requires pulling yourself up and out of the seat.\n\nVisibility is good for a small coupe. The Porsche Cayman doesn’t have a traditional B-pillar, so over-shoulder views aren’t blocked, and because it’s a small, low-riding car you can use the rear window to help check your right-side blind spot. The available front and rear parking sensors are useful, but we wished our test car had the optional backup camera.\n\nThe best part about the cabin is its all-new styling, which is much more luxurious than the prior Cayman’s, with a focus on rich materials and details that weren’t there before. It feels high-rent — as it should considering the car’s price.\n\nIt’s not without issues, though. The position of the performance-related buttons on the center console isn’t ideal because you have to look down and away from the road to see them; it’d make better sense to put them on the steering wheel, where there’s plenty of room. The same goes for the Bluetooth controls, which are on the stereo head unit. The turn-signal stalk feels like it’s going to snap off in your hand, too.\n\nNoises aren’t isolated that well, either. That’s fine for the whirring engine noises, which add to the experience, but there’s also significant tire noise on the highway. On ragged post-winter asphalt, you hear all the grit and pebbles that are kicked up by the tires bouncing against the fender liners.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nUnlike many other premium brands, Porsche still relies on physical buttons and touch-screen technology rather than integrated knob-based interfaces like BMW’s iDrive.\n\nIn addition to the 7-inch dashboard touch-screen there’s a secondary full-color screen in the instrument panel that shows info for the stereo, available navigation system, phone interface and car. A stalk on the right side of the steering wheel lets you easily cycle through all the information. Pairing my iPhone to the car and streaming music using Bluetooth was straightforward.\n\nCargo & Storage\nA side benefit of the Porsche Cayman’s mid-engine vs. rear-engined layout is its front and rear cargo areas. The cargo space under the rear hatch measures 9.7 cubic feet, while the trunk under the hood is 5.3 cubic feet. The combined cargo volume is more than some compact sedans offer. The front trunk is about 1.5-feet deep, and soft-sided luggage, like duffel bags, would make the most of the space.\n\nThere are a number of storage cubbies in the cabin, including a few in the doors and one under the center armrest. None of them is very large, though, and would be best used for small loose items like pens and change.\n\nSafety\nThe 2014 Porsche Cayman hadn’t been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration as of publication. As it’s a low-volume sports car, it’s unlikely to be tested anytime soon.\n\nThe optional backup camera costs $1,515 and includes front and rear parking sensors. A forward collision warning system that can autonomously brake the car to avoid a collision is part of the $2,170 adaptive cruise control system, which is only available on automatic-transmission models.\n\nFor a full list of safety features, see the Features & Specs page.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe redesigned Porsche Cayman is more refined and looks good inside and out. It’s still rewarding to drive, but it’s not as engaging as its predecessor. The Cayman used to be far ahead of the competition from a driving-enjoyment perspective, but the new model gives up some of that advantage. In Porsche’s quest for greater fuel efficiency and refinement, some of the Porsche Cayman’s distinctive soul has been diminished.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Feeling a little better about your 401(k) retirement account these days? Porsche hopes so. Luxury and performance vehicles are a tough sell during a recession, and the sooner well-heeled customers start spending money again, the happier Porsche dealers will be.\n\nThe company has invested some money in its potent mid-level sports car, the Cayman, which debuted in 2005 as a 2006 model. Four years into the model run, Porsche has freshened the 2009 Cayman with a mild restyling of the front and rear – headlights and taillights mostly – and has added power.\n\nThe base Cayman gets a larger, 2.9-liter six-cylinder engine, with 265 horsepower. And the uplevel Cayman S now has a 3.4-liter six-cylinder engine, with horsepower boosted from 295 to 320. The Cayman S still isn’t playing in the same league as the flagship 911, but it’s closer than ever.\n\nOn the Cayman S test car, that new engine is matched with a new seven-speed “Doppelkupplung” transmission – that translates to “double clutch,” meaning that while this transmission operates as an automatic, it can be shifted manually, thanks to internal clutches. It’s an effective update of the Tiptronic transmission, but whether you think it’s worth the $3,420 option price over the six-speed manual is up to you.\n\nThere is no denying, though, that this new transmission maximizes the engine’s muscle, and it feels like more than 320 horsepower, pulling strongly from a standing start, up through and well past legal limits. And fuel mileage is surprisingly good: An EPA-rated 20 mpg city, 29 mpg on the highway, thanks in part to that seventh speed that lets the engine lope along at freeway speeds.\n\nThe handling is excellent and the ride is surprisingly good. Steering is quick but not twitchy. Brakes are superb.\n\nInside, the Cayman S’ interior has been redesigned but remains rather Spartan. The test car didn’t have a navigation system, and it still had a small, black-and-white screen on the dashboard for the readout on the Bose sound system that looked dated in a $68,890 car.\n\nThe front seats – the Cayman, unlike the 911, makes no pretense of having a rear seat – are comfortable, but if you are taller than 6 feet, the driver’s seat may not slide back far enough.\n\nLuggage space is surprisingly generous, thanks to a parcel shelf behind the seats and small trunks in the front and the rear. There’s plenty of room for groceries or a weekend’s worth of luggage.\n\nSolid, fast and handsome, Porsche has made a very good car better. And since Cayman sales have dropped by more than half this year, it’s probably a good time to make a deal.\n\nSentinel Automotive Editor Steven Cole Smithcan be reached at 407-420-5699, scsmith@orlandosentinel.com or through his blog at Enginehead.com.\n\n2009 Porsche Cayman S\n\nBase price: $60,200\n\nPrice as tested: $68,890\n\nEPA rating: 20 miles per gallon city driving, 29 mpg highway.\n\nDetails: Mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive sports coupe with a 3.4-liter, 320-horsepower six-cylinder engine and a seven-speed automatic transmission.",

      "expert_review": "In the depths of winter, my happy memories of test-driving a 2008 Porsche Cayman help keep the chill away. If I really want to warm up, I just have to think about zipping around a closed track in a Cayman, courtesy of a member of my local Porsche Club (thanks, Dad!). First, I drove the car around the track, and then I rode along with a professional driver and found that my driving skills fell drastically short. At least I got to experience the true capabilities of the Cayman.\n\nThe Cayman looks a lot like a 911 to the untrained eye. It has some distinctive vents in front of the rear fender, a telltale sign that it is not its more expensive, driver-oriented sister. The Cayman gets an EPA-estimated 20/29 mpg city/highway. Not bad for a racer!\n\nI was really nervous about driving the Cayman because Porsches are notoriously tricky to drive. Most Porsches have all their weight in the back, so they’re skittish on the road. The Cayman, however, has all its weight in the center, so it was easy to figure out and fun to drive. One of the things the pros know (and made a point of showing me) is that the brakes can be used to shift a car’s weight around turns. It was fun to practice this kind of braking a little while zipping around corners in the Cayman.\n\nExterior\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, if you’re not a Porsche person you might not be able to tell the difference between a Cayman and a 911. What you really need to know is that the Cayman costs about $34,000 less than the 911 base model. Of course, it doesn’t have the same driving systems as the 911, but it’s a fantastic entry into the world of sports cars. It’s meant to compete with the BMW Z4 and the Mercedes-Benz SLK-Class. No, it ain’t cheap, but it’s not expensive if you’re talking sports-car budgets.\n\nMy test car was Carrara White, which admittedly isn’t my favorite car color. When I was at the Porsche event, there were a bunch of great-looking colors, including Speed Yellow, Guards Red and Arctic Silver Metallic. These colors showed off the Cayman’s sleek exterior much better than the white. I wasn’t too disappointed test-driving the white Cayman; it certainly got noticed out on the road. It sounded like a Porsche and it looked like a Porsche; what more could you want in a sports car?\n\nThis car loves to be driven, and it dares you to push it. Its braking was excellent. My newfound braking ability during turns was a great lesson in driving and vehicle dynamics. I learned a little of this during my time on the closed course, but I could certainly use more practice. Fortunately, Porsche has a driving school (and even a Women’s Only course) that teaches these skills and more.\n\nThis car begged me to accelerate out of corners and find roads with plenty of turns. The Cayman was fast off the line at the stoplight, to be sure, but she was a real treat on twisty back roads. (I was going the speed limit, of course.) What I loved about the Cayman was that she’ll hang in there as you learn to drive her and give you a thrill, even if you’re not Bob Bondurant (a former Formula One racecar driver and now the owner of a racing school).\n\nI drove the Cayman on a drizzly day, and it didn’t get sketchy on me. This had a lot to do with its weight distribution, I’m sure. I felt safe and happy making the 60-mile trek home in the Cayman, but I was relieved not to have to figure out how to drive it in inclement weather on the fly.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Not Really\n\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Groove On\n\nInterior\n\nI’m not an instructor by any stretch of the imagination, but I do have a couple lessons about the Cayman that I’d like to pass on to you:\n\nNo. 1: Don’t confuse sports cars with luxury cars. Porsche is focused on driving, not massaging your tush. My dad claims that Ferdinand Porsche couldn’t understand why anyone would want a radio in one of his cars. I’m not sure if it’s true, but it makes sense to me. The Porsche’s engine noise is distinctive and very loud in the car. If that’s not your thing, well, maybe you should consider a different car. The Cayman did have a stereo; it was quite nice, but I didn’t have it on much. I happened to agree with Ferdinand; I preferred the sound of the engine on this one.\n\nNo. 2: Sports cars, including the Cayman, can handle some groceries. Many car manufacturers aim to make sports cars accommodate at least one bag of golf clubs. That’s roughly the same cargo space as a smallish load of groceries, although that’s not why you buy it, right? There were front and rear cargo spaces in the Cayman, which is enough room to fit a bag or two for a weekend getaway with your date.\n\nNo. 3: Heated leather-upholstered seats are, well, delicious.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\nSafety\n\nPorsche has included some great safety features into this small package, like remote-activated perimeter lights. More-traditional safety gear includes front-impact, side-impact and side curtain airbags (for a total of six, if you’re counting). The Cayman also has traction control, stability control, a tire pressure monitoring system and antilock brakes.\n\nKids and sports cars can mix, but some sports car are better than others. My kids’ booster seats fit fantastically into the Cayman. There was a set of Latch connectors, as well. The front passenger airbag sensors automatically turn off the airbags when a kid sits in the car, but I did wish for a hard switch to turn off the airbags. The engine is in the middle of the car, so the Cayman is a two-seater (911s have little itty-bitty backseats). The Cayman was hospitable; I didn’t have to work very hard to make the booster seat fit, and it didn’t push the booster seat freakishly close to the dashboard. Thank you, Porsche!\n\nFAMILY LIFESTAGE\n\nIn Diapers: Heck no!\n\nIn School: A booster seat easily fit into the passenger seat, and airbag sensors automatically turn off airbags when a child is riding in the car.\n\nTeens: If your kid is a passenger or wants to be a racecar driver, the Cayman is OK. Otherwise, hide the keys.",

      "expert_review": "Car enthusiasts often deride mainstream, popular cars as “appliances,” saying they don’t offer any driving fun. In most cases they’re right, but that doesn’t mean those cars aren’t what most people want.\n\nThe 2012 Porsche Cayman R, on the other hand, is not an appliance; driving it is like piloting an oversized go-kart, and it offers one of the best blends of power and handling for the money.\n\nThe 2012 Porsche Cayman base starts at $52,850 (including a $950 destination charge), but the lightweight Cayman R version we tested, which is new for 2012, is considerably more expensive, at $67,250. In between there’s the Porsche Cayman S, which uses a slightly less powerful version of the Cayman R’s flat-six engine. Click here to see the Cayman S and Cayman R trim levels compared side-by-side, or see how the Cayman R’s specs stack up against comparable sports cars — the Audi TT RS and the Lotus Evora — here.\n\nStyling\nThe first-generation Porsche Cayman enters its seventh model year for 2012. Porsche Cayman due for a redesign in the near future, but the current car can still turn heads, especially the Porsche Cayman S and Cayman R trims. It has its own look distinct from Porsche’s iconic 911, and in some ways it’s a more graceful one. The mid-engine design facilitates a low hood bordered by elliptical bi-xenon headlight assemblies, and the roofline trails gently toward the rear of the coupe.\n\nPerhaps more likely to elicit strong opinions is the available Peridot Metallic paint, which our test car had. It’s an intense shade of green, but the black Porsche graphics on the doors and the optional black-painted 19-inch wheels made for an eye-pleasing contrast.\n\nExtension of the Driver\nIt’s a description that’s overused whenever sports cars are discussed, but the Cayman R can legitimately be called an extension of the driver. Its responses are that intuitive, its transitions that natural and balanced. It’s easy to feel connected to the Cayman R in a way most sports cars can’t match.\n\nDifferent elements of the driving experience contribute to this sensation, but it starts with the steering. The setup is amazingly natural, free of excess power assistance that can get in the way of steering feedback. Porsche has done an excellent job making it seem like there aren’t many components separating the steering wheel from the front wheels, and this is key to how it feels in your hands — whether cornering or going in a straight line.\n\nThe Porsche Cayman’s front-to-rear weight distribution is another important element. With the car’s mid-engine layout, Porsche has achieved a 45/55 weight distribution, front/rear. The car isn’t hauling around a lot of weight, either, especially in R form: It weighs 2,855 pounds, 121 less than the Cayman S, which means you get an exception power-to-weight ratio. Beyond that, the center of gravity feels especially low. The rear-wheel-drive Porsche Cayman R’s ride height is lower than the base Cayman or the Cayman S; it uses an exclusive suspension that drops the car about an inch.\n\nAll this combined lets you tackle corners with an enthusiasm that would have other cars begging you to slow down. The Cayman R, by comparison, begs you to go faster. You really have to recalibrate your sense of maximum permissible cornering speeds — its capabilities are that high.\n\nFlat-Six Fun\nPerhaps the only downside of the Cayman R’s 330-horsepower, 3.4-liter flat-6-cylinder engine is that you can’t see it unless the car is on a lift. The engine is covered by a parcel shelf behind the two sport bucket seats, and the only visual cue that there’s an engine underneath is a small access panel.\n\nThere are, however, plenty of auditory reminders that there’s a horizontally opposed six-cylinder under the shelf, especially when you stand on the gas pedal; the engine lets out a mechanical symphony when the tachometer needle swings to 4,000 rpm or so. The engine pulls strongly even at highway speeds, quickly adding 10 mph to your cruising speed. Porsche cites a zero-to-60-mph time of 4.7 seconds with the six-speed manual transmission and 4.6 seconds with the optional dual-clutch automatic known as PDK.\n\nInstead of the PDK, our test car had the manual, and while the shifter has short throws that make quick shifts easy, shift feel lags behind the high expectations set by the rest of the car. Whereas everything else related to the driving experience exudes precision and exactness, the shifter feels a little vague and muddy as you row it through the gears.\n\nThe Sport Chrono Package includes an analog stopwatch on the dashboard and a Sport button that makes throttle response much more immediate. It also raises the rev-limiter and activates the optional sport exhaust. In a car like the Cayman R, Sport mode would be a good starting point for the drivetrain settings, as opposed to an optional one; the normal mode’s more relaxed tuning doesn’t go as well with the car, but it improves efficiency and keeps PDK-equipped cars running at a quieter engine speed.\n\nFor a performance car, the Cayman R’s EPA-estimated gas mileage is quite good. It’s rated at 19/27 mpg city/highway with the manual transmission. With the automatic, fuel economy estimates improve to 20/29 mpg. Premium gas is required.\n\nThe Inside\nDespite its compact exterior, the Porsche Cayman R’s cabin can accommodate taller drivers. I’m 6-foot-1, and I was comfortable in the driver’s seat. The bucket leather seats are firmly cushioned and have considerable side bolsters that hold you in place in corners.\n\nWe’ve seen Porsche improve its interior quality in recently redesigned models like the Cayenne SUV and the 911, but the current-generation Cayman predates those models by a number of years. As such, the car’s interior is decent — with good fit-and-finish and materials quality — but it’s not especially luxurious considering its near-$53,000 starting price.\n\nBesides contributing to the Cayman R’s handling prowess, the car’s mid-engine layout results in two trunks. The one in front is deep and measures 5.3 cubic feet, and the parcel shelf under the rear hatch is 9.2 cubic feet. If you use soft-sided bags you can fit a surprising amount of luggage in the car.\n\nSafety\nLike many other sports cars, the Cayman hasn’t been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nStandard safety equipment includes antilock brakes and an electronic stability system, both of which are required on new vehicles as of the 2012 model year. The Cayman also has seat-mounted side-impact airbags and side curtain airbags that deploy upward from the doors.\n\nFor a full list of safety features, check out the Features & Specs page.\n\nCayman in the Market\nThe Porsche Cayman is something of an overlooked gem in the Porsche lineup. It’s consistently outsold by its drop-top sibling, the Boxster, as well as the pricier 911. Sales aside, it remains my favorite Porsche sports car for daily driving. The car’s secret is that its modern technology doesn’t get in the way of driving engagement, but rather enhances it. That’s one of the reasons the Porsche Cayman landed on our list of fun-to-drive cars.\n\nThe next-generation Cayman, which we expect to be less than a year away, will probably take many cues from the recently redesigned 2013 Boxster. Even though the Porsche Cayman has been around for a while in its current form, the car is as appealing as ever and a perfect country-road companion. Rejoice, car enthusiasts, rejoice.\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in May 2014 about the 2014 Porsche Cayman S. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2015, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe redesigned 2014 Porsche Cayman is more luxurious than its predecessor, but performance-car purists will lament its diluted steering feel.\n\nThe Cayman is Porsche’s entry-level coupe, if you can call a car that starts at $53,550 (including a $950 destination charge) entry-level. Unlike the iconic rear-engine 911, the Cayman is a mid-engine car like the Boxster, its convertible sibling.\n\nThe all-new 2014 Cayman weighs less and is more efficient than its predecessor, and power is up slightly. It also gets a richer interior. To see the 2014 model’s specs compared with the 2012 (the Cayman skipped the 2013 model year), click here.\n\nWe tested a manual-transmission Cayman S, which comes with a more powerful flat-six engine rated at 325 horsepower. This trim level starts at $64,750, including destination, but our car’s as-tested price ballooned to $89,915 with options like a high-end Burmester stereo and navigation ($6,730), Porsche Active Suspension Management ($1,790), 20-inch Carrera Classic wheels ($2,730) and an upgraded Natural Leather Interior ($3,895), to name a few.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe prior-generation Cayman had exceptional steering feedback, which made it a joy to drive. That car used conventional hydraulic power steering, but the 2014 model switches to electric power steering. Porsche says this improves fuel efficiency and “provides direct feedback … while filtering out unpleasant or unnecessary surface irregularities.” The way the old car’s steering communicated everything about the road surface was what made it so magical, but a lot of that magic is now gone, which is a shame.\n\nThe 2014 Cayman’s steering wheel has a nice heft to it in corners, but it’s numb when traveling straight and lacks the direct, connected sensation that delighted your fingertips before. Body roll is minimal and the car feels planted, but it’s less enjoyable to drive with the new steering setup. Selecting the Sport Plus mode in our tester made the wheel seem a little weightier, but the difference is minor.\n\nWith optional Porsche Active Suspension Management, an adaptive suspension system, ride quality is livable for daily commuting — even with optional 20-inch wheels and low-profile tires. The ride is firm in Normal mode, but it wasn’t punishing on Chicago’s post-winter roads, many of which were rutted and crumbling. Ride quality takes on a harder edge when you press the Sport Plus button.\n\nThe engine in the Cayman S remains one of the car’s highlights. The flat-six is smooth and accelerates the coupe forcefully; Porsche cites a zero-to-60-mph time of 4.7 seconds with the six-speed manual transmission. We liked the sounds this engine makes, too; performance cars traditionally emphasize exhaust sounds, but the overriding sound from the Cayman is an ever-present whirring noise right behind your head.\n\nThe manual transmission’s clutch pedal and shifter have a weighty feel. It takes a firm foot to press the clutch in and a deliberate hand to change gears, but the setup feels right for this car. It’s also an improvement over the previous Cayman’s stick shift, which felt a little vague when going through the gears. Reverse is up and to the left, next to 1st gear, and one editor didn’t like that there wasn’t a lockout feature to prevent you from accidentally choosing it.\n\nFuel-saving stop-start technology is new to the Cayman for 2014. It caught me off guard a few times because I thought I’d stalled the car, when in reality the engine had turned off automatically to save gas at a stop.\n\nIn the manual-transmission Cayman, when the car is stationary the engine can shut off when the transmission is in Neutral and you’ve released the clutch pedal. The engine restarts as you press the clutch in, so the car will be ready to go when you are. As stop-start systems go, this one is relatively seamless, but it’s still annoying to hear the engine restart again and again. A button on the center console deactivates the system.\n\nFor a sports car, the Cayman S’ gas mileage estimates have always been good, and they’re even better for 2014. It gets an EPA-estimated 21/30/24 mpg city/highway/combined with the seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission and 20/28/23 mpg with the manual. The combined rating for both is 1 mpg higher than before. I got about 20 mpg in our manual-transmission test car in mixed suburban and highway driving. Manual-transmission versions of competitors like the 2014 BMW M235i and 2014 Lotus Evora are rated 19/28/23 mpg and 18/26/21 mpg, respectively, and the automatic-only 2015 Jaguar F-Type coupe gets 20/28/23 mpg; to see these cars compared with the Cayman S, click here.\n\nInterior\nThe cabin might look small from the outside, but the two-seat Cayman can comfortably carry taller people. I’m 6 feet 1 inch tall, and I easily found a comfortable driving position. Our test car had 14-way power-adjustable sport bucket seats, a $2,320 option, and their firm cushioning provided good support without being uncomfortably hard. The side bolsters hold you in place in corners, too.\n\nGetting in and out of the car — even if you’re relatively nimble — is a challenge. You have to get low to get inside, and getting out is an awkward process that requires pulling yourself up and out of the seat.\n\nVisibility is good for a small coupe. The Cayman doesn’t have a traditional B-pillar, so over-shoulder views aren’t blocked, and because it’s a small, low-riding car you can use the rear window to help check your right-side blind spot. The available front and rear parking sensors are useful, but we wished our test car had the optional backup camera.\n\nThe best part about the cabin is its all-new styling, which is much more luxurious than the prior Cayman’s, with a focus on rich materials and details that weren’t there before. It feels high-rent — as it should considering the car’s price.\n\nIt’s not without issues, though. The position of the performance-related buttons on the center console isn’t ideal because you have to look down and away from the road to see them; it’d make better sense to put them on the steering wheel, where there’s plenty of room. The same goes for the Bluetooth controls, which are on the stereo head unit. The turn-signal stalk feels like it’s going to snap off in your hand, too.\n\nNoises aren’t isolated that well, either. That’s fine for the whirring engine noises, which add to the experience, but there’s also significant tire noise on the highway. On ragged post-winter asphalt, you hear all the grit and pebbles that are kicked up by the tires bouncing against the fender liners.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nUnlike many other premium brands, Porsche still relies on physical buttons and touch-screen technology rather than integrated knob-based interfaces like BMW’s iDrive.\n\nIn addition to the 7-inch dashboard touch-screen there’s a secondary full-color screen in the instrument panel that shows info for the stereo, available navigation system, phone interface and car. A stalk on the right side of the steering wheel lets you easily cycle through all the information. Pairing my iPhone to the car and streaming music using Bluetooth was straightforward.\n\nCargo & Storage\nA side benefit of the Cayman’s mid-engine layout is its front and rear cargo areas. The cargo space under the rear hatch measures 9.7 cubic feet, while the trunk under the hood is 5.3 cubic feet. The combined cargo volume is more than some compact sedans offer. The front trunk is about 1.5-feet deep, and soft-sided luggage, like duffel bags, would make the most of the space.\n\nThere are a number of storage cubbies in the cabin, including a few in the doors and one under the center armrest. None of them is very large, though, and would be best used for small loose items like pens and change.\n\nSafety\nThe 2014 Cayman hadn’t been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration as of publication. As it’s a low-volume sports car, it’s unlikely to be tested anytime soon.\n\nThe optional backup camera costs $1,515 and includes front and rear parking sensors. A forward collision warning system that can autonomously brake the car to avoid a collision is part of the $2,170 adaptive cruise control system, which is only available on automatic-transmission models.\n\nFor a full list of safety features, see the Features & Specs page.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe redesigned Cayman is more refined and looks good inside and out. It’s still rewarding to drive, but it’s not as engaging as its predecessor. The Cayman used to be far ahead of the competition from a driving-enjoyment perspective, but the new model gives up some of that advantage. In Porsche’s quest for greater fuel efficiency and refinement, some of the Cayman’s distinctive soul has been diminished.\n\nemail",
