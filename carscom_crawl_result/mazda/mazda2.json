      "expert_review": "The 2011 Mazda2 may very well be the cutest car I’ve driven to date. Despite its more than adorable look, the Mazda2 and I took a few days to get to know each other. Upon my first drive, I have to admit that I wasn’t a fan of the all-new subcompact.\n\nIt was because the five-speed manual transmission and I didn’t get along. On more than one occasion, I accidentally shifted into 5th gear, rather than 3rd, from 2nd. That wasn’t my only complaint. Shifting felt jerky; the hollow sound the door made when it closed didn’t instill a sense of confidence, and the loud road, wind and engine noise pouring into the cabin was exhausting to my senses.\n\nWith its 100-horsepower 1.5-liter engine and manual transmission, I can’t really say that there’s any zoom-zoom with the Mazda2. The other thing that is kind of puny with this car is its EPA-estimated fuel economy of 29/35 mpg city/highway. I expected more mileage out of such a small, lightweight car.\n\nAfter the initial annoyances I reminded myself that with a starting price of $14,180 for the base Sport trim level and $15,635 for the Touring trim level, this car is one of the cheapest I’ve driven to date and reset my expectation level. My test car, a top-of-the-line Mazda2 Touring, cost $16,000; it packed in a few extra features that were surprising for this price point.\n\nEXTERIOR\n\nThat Mazda2 is small, but it still manages to pack in a huge style punch. The rounded hatch, coupled with a rear spoiler and cat-eyelike headlights are totally likable. I’m not really sure I’d take a full-grown adult seriously in this car, however. It’s just too cute. It seems much more appropriate, both in style and price point, for a teen driver or a young adult just out of college.\n\nOne thing that does impress me about the Mazda2 is how it manages to squeeze in four full-size car doors – plus a fifth if you count the hatch – into such a little design. This car is vaguely reminiscent in size to my own Volvo C30, and every time I approach the Mazda2 I’m still a tad bit surprised there are rear doors. That makes it doable in a pinch for families with school-age kids, who have short legs.\n\nThe small size, low step-in height and placement of the car doors makes this cutie easy for little ones to open the door, climb in and close the door independently.\n\nThe Mazda2 has a 100-hp, 1.5-liter inline-four-cylinder engine that takes regular gas. A five-speed manual transmission is standard. With the optional four-speed automatic, it gets 27/33 mpg.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Some\n\nINTERIOR\n\nThe inside is where some of those surprising features I mentioned earlier make themselves known. First off is the sporty red piping that lines the black seating upholstery. It comes standard in the Touring version I tested. It’s just a little extra touch that, for its price, seems like a real bonus stylewise. The front seats adjusted manually, and the driver’s seat also adjusts up and down.\n\nOn top of that, I was surprised by the standard leather-wrapped steering wheel with audio and cruise control buttons mounted on it. The steering wheel tilts up and down but doesn’t telescope.\n\nOther surprising features at this price include remote keyless entry, air conditioner with a pollen filter, and an MP3 jack. The open center console design had two cupholders for the front passengers and a third intended for rear passengers. Four open cubby-like spaces in the center console helped to contain clutter. The front doors featured a storage bin that was wide enough for the latest novel I’m reading (Carl Hiaasen’s “Star Island”) while waiting in the carpool lane, with room left over for a bottle of water.\n\nWith such a small car, clearly there isn’t tons of space in the backseat. However, for just two kids it was doable as long as I stashed their backpacks in the cargo area rather than on the floor near their feet. I put three kids in the backseat at one point. Although they all fit and nobody complained, they were definitely packed in like skinny little sardines. So much so that they had to stagger their seat belt buckling; the outer two buckled first, and then the third wiggled into the middle seat to buckle up.\n\nThe rear seats are split 60/40 and fold to create some extra cargo space. Even with the seats up, there was just enough cargo space for a full week’s worth of groceries.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSAFETY\n\nDriving the Mazda2 felt a bit like driving a tin can, which doesn’t instill a sense of confidence on the safety front. There aren’t any crash-test ratings available yet on this car. However, it does come standard with both stability control and traction control, which are features that other manufacturers make you pay extra for.\n\nThe Mazda2 also comes standard with antilock brakes with brake assist and six airbags, including side-impact airbags and side curtains for the front row only. Rear passengers don’t have any airbag protection.\n\nThe second row’s head restraints in the two outer seats are positioned to rest right in front of the seat itself. This makes it tough to install forward-facing car seats or high-back booster seats without the safety seats leaning too far forward. I was able to remove both head restraints for a better fit. The rear seat belt buckles are on flimsy bases, so little hands might need extra help when buckling in. The lower Latch anchors are wedged quite tightly into the space between the seat bottom and seatback, so installing a child-safety seat using Latch connectors would be quite a challenge.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2011 Mazda2 here.",

      "expert_review": "Do you have a sister who’s always having more fun than you? The Ford Fiesta does. Its Mazda2 sibling shares some of the sub-compact’s DNA but is much livelier on the road.\n\nThe pint-sized 2013 model year Mazda 2 packs a big wallop of fun. It’s quick, agile and stylish, but space behind the wheel is more cramped than the competition and its materials interior could use an upgrade.\n\nLike the Fiesta, this five-seater arrived in the U.S. for 2011 as the brand’s entry-level offering. It returns unchanged for 2013. Compare the 2012 and 2013 models here.\n\nUnlike the Fiesta, the Mazda is only available as a four-door hatchback; there is no sedan body style. Styling-wise, they share the same wedge shape, but the Mazda2 wears a more sculpted body and a grinning grille.\n\nMeasuring 155.5 inches long, the Mazda 2 is a bit larger than the tiny Toyota Yaris hatchback, but it’s shorter than most other competitors, including the Fiesta (160.1 inches) and the Honda Fit (161.6 inches). See all three compared here.\n\nChanneling a Little Zoom-Zoom\nA hundred horsepower may not sound like a lot, but it’s enough for the Mazda 2; in fact, it’s plenty. In stop-and-go traffic, it even felt zippy. I tested the standard five-speed manual transmission; a four-speed automatic is optional.\n\nIs the three-pedal setup for everyone? No — slogging through city traffic was often a chore. But did the manual make the Mazda2 livelier in certain situations? Absolutely — the five-speed has a light clutch and a solid, precise shifter.\n\nThe Fiesta’s 120-hp, 1.6-liter engine is often pokey, and its dual-clutch automatic transmission was crabby when I tested it recently. The Mazda 2, on the other hand, felt animated, channeling the fun-to-drive spirit of its larger sibling, the Mazda3. The Mazda 2 is agile and maneuverable, staying flat when flung through curvy highway ramps. Around town, its petite frame and tight turning circle make parking a breeze. Its ride is solid, too, staying composed over most bumps.\n\nDespite having more horses, however, the Fiesta trumps the Mazda 2 in the fuel-economy department. With the manual, the Mazda 2 is EPA-rated fuel efficiency of 29/35 mpg city/highway. That’s not as great as the Fiesta’s 29/39 mpg fuel rating, but better than the Fit’s 27/33 rating.\n\nDeceptive Materials\nAt first glance, the interior impressed: It uses a simple layout that’s clean without being boring. Glossy black plastic trim and red piping on the seats spice things up. The look is more grown-up than the Fiesta’s and more interesting than the Fit’s.\n\nThe Mazda 2’s circular instrument panel reminds me of the Mini Cooper’s but is easier to navigate. The climate dials are large and clear, and the radio buttons are intuitive. A new-for-2013 standard USB port is a nice convenience for some but likely vital to the vehicle’s intended demographic.\n\nOnce you look a little longer and start poking around the interior, however, you’ll notice there’s way too much hard plastic. It’s everywhere and padding is nowhere, not even on the door panel armrests. But it’s the backseat passengers who will really bear the brunt of Mazda’s cheapness.\n\nIn front, the seats are comfortable and bolstered for a snug fit, but rear passengers get no cushy for their tushy. The backseat is a hard, flat panel that’s in desperate need of more cushioning. And the no-frills theme continues: There are no second-row cupholders, map pockets or door storage cubbies, which was surprising on our uplevel Touring car. Also missing is a center seat head restraint, which supports the head and neck in a crash.\n\nA Tight Squeeze\nThe Mazda 2 was a tight squeeze for my small family of three. Headroom was decent for me up front, but taller passengers should look elsewhere. The Mazda 2 and Fiesta both offer 39.1 inches of front headroom, which is more than an inch less than the Fit (40.4). Mazda offers more legroom up front than many in the class, however, with a smidge more than the Fiesta and about an inch more than the Fit.\n\nTwo issues involving driver comfort bugged me. First, the steering wheel tilts but doesn’t telescope, which complicates getting comfortable (this feature is standard in the Fiesta and Fit). Second, the front cupholders are under the center console armrest. Taller beverages won’t fit, and those prone to spills should watch out: Extracting a cup of hot coffee is precarious.\n\nAgain, though, it’s in the back that space really feels pinched. The Mazda2 has less headroom back there than all three hatchbacks, and its 33 inches of legroom isn’t great, either. The Fit’s 34.5 inches feel roomy by comparison.\n\nThe Mazda 2’s cargo situation is puzzling. On paper, there’s more space than the Fiesta (27.8 cubic feet versus the Ford’s 26), but the area is so oddly shaped I had trouble fitting my small umbrella stroller. It ended up having to ride in the backseat with my toddler in the Mazda 2, but it fit OK in the Fiesta’s cargo area. The Fit wins again here with a cavernous 57.3 cubic feet of maximum space.\n\nFeatures & Price\nThe 2013 Mazda 2 is available in base Sport and uplevel Touring trims and starts at $15,515, including destination. I tested the Touring model, which starts just over $17,000 and comes standard with niceties like steering-wheel audio controls, cruise control, a rear spoiler, fog lights and alloy wheels.\n\nHatchback versions of the Fiesta start a touch lower, but an auto transmission will cost you more: It’s an extra $1,095 on the Fiesta compared to an $840 option on the Mazda2. The Fit starts just above $16,000; add $800 for an auto. Cruise control is standard on all Fits but is standard only on uplevel versions of the Fiesta and Mazda2.\n\nSafety\nIn Insurance Institute for Highway Safety tests, the Mazda 2 received the agency’s top score of Good in front crash and roof-strength tests, but scored just Acceptable in side- and rear-impact crashes. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has not yet tested the Mazda 2.\n\nStandard safety features include six airbags: dual front, front-seat-mounted side-impact air bags and full-length side curtain airbags. Note that the Mazda does not have the Fiesta’s driver-knee airbag. Click here for a full list of safety features.\n\nVisibility is fine straight back thanks largely to head restraints that slide down onto the seatback and completely out of sight. Also, the side mirrors are nice and big for such a small vehicle.\n\nA cramped backseat and Latch anchors that are crowded into the seat belt buckles complicate child-safety seat installation. Click here for the full Car Seat Check.\n\nMazda2 in the Market\nThe Mazda 2 wins points for its dynamic styling and fun-to-drive spirit. It seems that U.S. consumers, however, aren’t all that interested. Although they’re related, the Fiesta has consistently outsold the Mazda 2 by huge margins: In the first 10 months of 2012, Ford sold more than 47,000 Fiestas; Mazda sold just 13,853 2s in that same time frame.\n\nIts lack of room behind the wheel and cheap interior are major issues, but are they enough to sink this sub-compact? Probably not, but competition from inside the brand might be. The larger Mazda 3 sedan isn’t that much more expensive than the 2, and it’s a sales success: The automaker had already sold more than 103,000 units of the small car in 2012 through October.\n\nMazda plans to redesign the Mazda 2 for global body-type audiences during the next two years, and weak sales in the U.S. mean its future here is uncertain. Despite its charms, the Mazda 2 may not be able to woo U.S. shoppers away from its larger, more popular sibling.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in December 2012 about the 2013 Mazda Mazda2. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2014, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nDo you have a sister who’s always having more fun than you? The Ford Fiesta does. Its Mazda2 sibling shares some of the subcompact’s DNA but is much livelier on the road.\n\nThe pint-sized 2013 Mazda2 packs a big wallop of fun. It’s quick, agile and stylish, but space is more cramped than the competition and its materials interior could use an upgrade.\n\nLike the Fiesta, this five-seater arrived in the U.S. for 2011 as the brand’s entry-level offering. It returns unchanged for 2013. Compare the 2012 and 2013 models here.\n\nUnlike the Fiesta, the Mazda is only available as a four-door hatchback; there is no sedan body style. Styling-wise, they share the same wedge shape, but the Mazda2 wears a more sculpted body and a grinning grille.\n\nMeasuring 155.5 inches long, the Mazda2 is a bit larger than the tiny Toyota Yaris hatchback, but it’s shorter than most other competitors, including the Fiesta (160.1 inches) and the Honda Fit (161.6 inches). See all three compared here.\n\nChanneling a Little Zoom-Zoom\nA hundred horsepower may not sound like a lot, but it’s enough for the Mazda2; in fact, it’s plenty. In stop-and-go traffic, it even felt zippy. I tested the standard five-speed manual transmission; a four-speed automatic is optional.\n\nIs the three-pedal setup for everyone? No — slogging through city traffic was often a chore. But did the manual make the Mazda2 livelier in certain situations? Absolutely — the five-speed has a light clutch and a solid, precise shifter.\n\nThe Fiesta’s 120-hp, 1.6-liter engine is often pokey, and its dual-clutch automatic transmission was crabby when I tested it recently. The Mazda2, on the other hand, felt animated, channeling the fun-to-drive spirit of its larger sibling, the Mazda3. The Mazda2 is agile and maneuverable, staying flat when flung through curvy highway ramps. Around town, its petite frame and tight turning circle make parking a breeze. Its ride is solid, too, staying composed over most bumps.\n\nDespite having more horses, however, the Fiesta trumps the Mazda2 in the fuel-economy department. With the manual, the Mazda2 is EPA-rated 29/35 mpg city/highway. That’s not as great as the Fiesta’s 29/39 mpg rating, but better than the Fit’s 27/33 rating.\n\nDeceptive Materials\nAt first glance, the interior impressed: It uses a simple layout that’s clean without being boring. Glossy black plastic trim and red piping on the seats spice things up. The look is more grown-up than the Fiesta’s and more interesting than the Fit’s.\n\nThe Mazda2’s circular instrument panel reminds me of the Mini Cooper’s but is easier to navigate. The climate dials are large and clear, and the radio buttons are intuitive. A new-for-2013 standard USB port is a nice convenience for some but likely vital to the car’s intended demographic.\n\nOnce you look a little longer and start poking around the interior, however, you’ll notice there’s way too much hard plastic. It’s everywhere and padding is nowhere, not even on the door panel armrests. But it’s the backseat passengers who will really bear the brunt of Mazda’s cheapness.\n\nIn front, the seats are comfortable and bolstered for a snug fit, but rear passengers get no cushy for their tushy. The backseat is a hard, flat panel that’s in desperate need of more cushioning. And the no-frills theme continues: There are no second-row cupholders, map pockets or door storage cubbies, which was surprising on our uplevel Touring car. Also missing is a center seat head restraint, which supports the head and neck in a crash.\n\nA Tight Squeeze\nThe Mazda2 was a tight squeeze for my small family of three. Headroom was decent for me up front, but taller passengers should look elsewhere. The Mazda2 and Fiesta both offer 39.1 inches of front headroom, which is more than an inch less than the Fit (40.4). Mazda offers more legroom up front than many in the class, however, with a smidge more than the Fiesta and about an inch more than the Fit.\n\nTwo issues involving driver comfort bugged me. First, the steering wheel tilts but doesn’t telescope, which complicates getting comfortable (this feature is standard in the Fiesta and Fit). Second, the front cupholders are under the center console armrest. Taller beverages won’t fit, and those prone to spills should watch out: Extracting a cup of hot coffee is precarious.\n\nAgain, though, it’s in the back that space really feels pinched. The Mazda2 has less headroom back there than all three hatchbacks, and its 33 inches of legroom isn’t great, either. The Fit’s 34.5 inches feel roomy by comparison.\n\nThe Mazda2’s cargo situation is puzzling. On paper, there’s more space than the Fiesta (27.8 cubic feet versus the Ford’s 26), but the area is so oddly shaped I had trouble fitting my small umbrella stroller. It ended up having to ride in the backseat with my toddler in the Mazda2, but it fit OK in the Fiesta’s cargo area. The Fit wins again here with a cavernous 57.3 cubic feet of maximum space.\n\nFeatures & Price\nThe 2013 Mazda2 is available in base Sport and uplevel Touring trims and starts at $15,515, including destination. I tested the Touring model, which starts just over $17,000 and comes standard with niceties like steering-wheel audio controls, cruise control, a rear spoiler, fog lights and alloy wheels.\n\nHatchback versions of the Fiesta start a touch lower, but an automatic transmission will cost you more: It’s an extra $1,095 on the Fiesta compared to an $840 option on the Mazda2. The Fit starts just above $16,000; add $800 for an automatic. Cruise control is standard on all Fits but is standard only on uplevel versions of the Fiesta and Mazda2.\n\nSafety\nIn Insurance Institute for Highway Safety tests, the Mazda2 received the agency’s top score of Good in front crash and roof-strength tests, but scored just Acceptable in side- and rear-impact crashes. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has not yet tested the Mazda2.\n\nStandard safety features include six airbags: dual front, front-seat-mounted side-impact air bags and full-length side curtain airbags. Note that the Mazda does not have the Fiesta’s driver-knee airbag. Click here for a full list of safety features.\n\nVisibility is fine straight back thanks largely to head restraints that slide down onto the seatback and completely out of sight. Also, the side mirrors are nice and big for such a small car.\n\nA cramped backseat and Latch anchors that are crowded into the seat belt buckles complicate child-safety seat installation. Click here for the full Car Seat Check.\n\nMazda2 in the Market\nThe Mazda2 wins points for its dynamic styling and fun-to-drive spirit. It seems that U.S. consumers, however, aren’t all that interested. Although they’re related, the Fiesta has consistently outsold the Mazda2 by huge margins: In the first 10 months of 2012, Ford sold more than 47,000 Fiestas; Mazda sold just 13,853 2s in that same time frame.\n\nIts lack of room and cheap interior are major issues, but are they enough to sink this subcompact? Probably not, but competition from inside the brand might be. The larger Mazda3 sedan isn’t that much more expensive than the 2, and it’s a sales success: The automaker had already sold more than 103,000 units of the compact car in 2012 through October.\n\nMazda plans to redesign the Mazda2 for global audiences during the next two years, and weak sales in the U.S. mean its future here is uncertain. Despite its charms, the Mazda2 may not be able to woo U.S. shoppers away from its larger, more popular sibling.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in November 2010 about the 2011 Mazda2. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2012, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe Mazda2 is a small car that drives like a small car — and that’s a compliment. Some cars feel bigger than they are, which can be good if you also get a sense of strength and solidity.\n\nThe Mazda2, though, is like a welterweight fighter: all quickness and agility, without sacrificing ride and practicality. I kept looking for excuses to drive it.\n\nCity Driving\nCity driving is the Mazda2’s forte. I drove the Mazda2 with both available transmissions: a five-speed manual and a four-speed automatic. Obviously, having the right gear on hand for quick maneuvers is simple with the manual because you control the gear selection, but the automatic is also very well-matched to the engine. When I wanted to zip into a spot in traffic, the automatic usually chose the right gear.\n\nThe manual has a light clutch that’s easy to feel when it’s picking up the gear, and the shifter is short and direct. There’s none of the rubbery feeling that can plague some entry-level cars. It’s fun to shift through the gears in the Mazda2, and it happens with a good, solid feeling.\n\nThe steering is also good. It’s very light and quick, but it doesn’t feel over-boosted or twitchy in city driving. It just felt like I was steering a very light car — because I was. Like the transmission, the steering feels like it’s dialed-in well to the car. The same can be said for the brakes: Instead of a mushy pedal, it gave me the right amount of feedback to judge how hard I needed to press the pedal to stop. There isn’t a lot of effort required, mind you, but the brakes are easy to get a feel for. It cornered well, too, even in the tight confines of Chicago.\n\nAll the stuff that makes you stop, go and turn is really well-tuned. The car feels like a unified machine, ready to zip wherever you want it to in the city.\n\nThere was only one real issue I noticed: The sloping A-pillar (the one that supports the windshield) can obscure pedestrians stepping off the curb. I got used to it the more I drove, but you’ll have to judge for yourself. Other than that, visibility is really good.\n\nHighway Driving\nOn the highway is where you’ll notice you’re driving a small, light car, and that’s not always a great thing. Right off, there was fair amount of road noise, and passengers noticed a lot of wind noise. That can be common for lighter cars, because they don’t tend to have a lot of sound insulation. Neither noise was intrusive.\n\nThe steering is lively on the highway. I never felt like the car got twitchy, but other editors who drove the Mazda2 said the steering was too light at speeds above 70 mph.\n\nIf I liked the automatic for cruising around town, the highway was one place where I really preferred the manual transmission. The automatic Mazda2 runs out of steam at high speeds, and I think that’s because it could use one more gear. When you want to pass, what you get is pretty much what you’d expect from a small, four-cylinder engine: a lot of noise but not a lot of surging forward. This was less of a problem with the manual.\n\nThe Mazda2 absolutely shines in one aspect of highway driving: its ride. You hear the car go over expansion joints, but you don’t really feel it. Also, some small cars — notably the Honda Fit — seem to porpoise over lumps in the road, but the Mazda2 really soaks them up. I took the Mazda2 for a weekend of bike races and came out of it as fresh as I have from some other, larger cars — maybe fresher. Whoever tuned the Mazda2’s suspension should be commended, especially because the Mazda2 takes curvy highway on-ramps pretty flat, too. It’s tough to get both of those attributes in one car.\n\nPracticality\nCars almost always make you compromise somewhere, and with a small car that can be in its practicality. The Mazda2 is no exception. I’m a bigger guy, and while I didn’t feel cramped while driving the Mazda2, there’s no way someone my size could have ridden behind me. A shorter person might have been OK, but either way it’s a tighter fit back there than it is in a Fit or Nissan Versa. (Check the photographs to see how child-safety seats fit, in case your passengers tend to be toddlers rather than adults.)\n\nOn the other hand, the cargo area is surprisingly large. In some hatchbacks, there’s just not a lot of room behind the rear seats to put stuff. Such is not the case with the Mazda2. I easily fit all the gear I needed for a weekend away in the hatch area without having to fold the seats over. When I did fold the seats, I found I had enough room for my large cyclocross bike without having to remove both wheels. That’s nice, because it means the Mazda2 is competitive with the Fit and Versa in the bike-carrying department. The stats show the Versa and Fit are much larger (the Fit has 57.3 cubic feet of maximum cargo area, the Versa has 50.4 and the Mazda2 brings up the rear with 27.8). What I found, though, was that the Mazda’s space is usable. In other words, there isn’t a ton of vertical space, but from side-to-side and front-to-back, there’s a lot of room.\n\nOverall, it’s a handy car, but I think it’s best-suited for young couples, singles or people with children who are still in car seats.\n\nFamily Relations\nThe Mazda2 is related to the Ford Fiesta, in which I’ve also spent time. My quick take, though, is this: The Fiesta has the flashier interior but, while it has more power than the Mazda2, I can’t say I really noticed a massive difference in speed or power. (This could be because the Fiesta weighs more than the Mazda2.)\n\nOverall, the Mazda2 is just more fun to drive and the ride is more comfortable. The Fiesta is available as a sedan or hatchback, while the Mazda2 can be had only as a hatchback.\n\nExterior & Interior\nAs is the case with many new Mazda models, the Mazda2 has a big, grinning grille opening. I like it on other Mazdas and I like it even more on the Mazda2, because the car is smaller. It looks like a little baby, grinning away. There are also some subtle, fenderlike bumps on the side that remind me of the Mazda3. Taken as a whole, you can really tell it’s a member of the Mazda family.\n\nThe inside is very nice, though spare. There are plenty of cupholders, the gauges are easy to read and the radio is easy to operate, but there’s no “wow” gadget. Heck, the only way to hook your iPod to the stereo is through a headphone auxiliary jack.\n\nIn a way, I think that’s good: There’s too much going on in modern interiors that distracts from driving. But I also know I’m in the minority in liking a simple interior. Either way, I think Mazda deserves a star for not wrapping the dashboard/center stack area in some cheap, metal-finish plastic. The Mazda2’s design is simple and clean.\n\nMileage, Safety & Reliability\nAs I’ve said, the Mazda2 is related to the Fiesta, but one area where there’s a noticeable difference between the two is in the mileage department. Where the Mazda gets an estimated 27-29 mpg in the city and 33-35 mpg on the highway, the Fiesta gets 28-29 mpg city and 37-38 mpg highway (40 mpg in the fuel-saving SFE edition).\n\nAs a new model, the Mazda2 has not yet been crash-tested, nor is there sufficient data for reliability ratings.\n\nMazda2 in the Market\nI’ve driven pretty much everything in the small-car field, and the Mazda2 is one I’d recommend any shopper take for a test drive. Its ride is the best in the category, yet it’s still more fun to drive than many. If you’re the type who likes something sporty, you’ll like the Mazda2. If you want a car that won’t beat you up — you’ll like the Mazda2.\n\nI’d also recommend the manual transmission, even though I didn’t dislike the automatic. I just think the manual is the icing on the cake when it comes to driving enjoyment.\n\nSend Bill an email",
