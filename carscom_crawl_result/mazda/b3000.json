      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nMazda simplified the lineup of its compact pickups in 2002 and began referring to them simply as the “Truck” rather than calling them B-Series, as the company had previously done. A 2.3-liter four-cylinder engine powers the B2300 series, while the B3000 and B4000 versions are equipped with 3.0-liter and 4.0-liter V-6 engines, respectively. All three Mazda models are closely related to equivalent Ford Rangers. For 2004, Mazda’s Cab Plus models get a monochromatic color scheme. Continue reading for information on the B2300.\n(Skip to details on the: B3000 | B4000)\n\nFor the 2004 model year, Mazda’s B2300 pickups come in base trim with a regular cab and in an SE trim level with an extended Cab Plus configuration. Both have rear-wheel drive.\n\nA sliding rear window is standard on all models. An SE-5 Package that includes styled steel wheels, a CD player, air conditioning, cloth seats and carpeted floormats is available for the B2300. A bed extender is optional. All four-wheel-drive models feature front hubs that can be locked automatically.\n\nFord, which holds a controlling interest in the Mazda company, builds the B2300, B3000 and B4000 compact pickups. For many years, the two companies have shared other products and components.\n\nExterior\nMazda’s B2300 pickups come in two sizes: as a regular cab and as a Cab Plus extended cab. Both have 6-foot cargo beds. The Ford Ranger comes in the same sizes, but it also is available as a regular-cab model with a 7-foot bed. The B2300’s front suspension consists of double wishbones with coil springs and a stabilizer bar, while semielliptic leaf springs are installed in the rear.\n\nStyling differences between the Ranger and Mazda’s compact pickups center on the grille. The Mazda grille has horizontal bars instead of Ford’s eggcrate appearance. Regular-cab models ride a 111.6-inch wheelbase and measure 187.5 inches long overall; Cab Plus models have a 125.7-inch wheelbase and are 201.7-inches long overall. Two-wheel-drive models have 15-inch wheels, and 4×4 versions ride on 16-inch tires. Options include side step tubes and a soft tonneau cover.\n\nInterior\nAll models have a roomy cab with a front, three-place bench seat. Cab Plus versions add a pair of vinyl, fold-down rear jump seats. Interior modifications for the 2004 model year include a new steering wheel, a redesigned center stack and upgraded door panel material.\n\nThe front seats have a fold-down armrest with an exposed cupholder, and storage pockets are installed on the front seatbacks and jack cover. Air conditioning and cruise control are optional on B2300 trucks.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe engines in all three Mazda Trucks are the same as those used in Ford Rangers. In the B2300, a 143-horsepower, 2.3-liter four-cylinder engine teams with either a standard five-speed-manual transmission or an optional five-speed automatic.\n\nSafety\nDual front airbags and antilock brakes are standard. A key-operated switch can deactivate the passenger-side airbag.\n\nB3000 Truck\nIn the B3000, a 154-hp, 3.0-liter V-6 engine teams with either a five-speed-manual transmission or an optional five-speed automatic. For the 2004 model year, Mazda’s B3000 pickups come in regular cab, Cab Plus and Cab Plus 4 (with rear-hinged doors) configurations and in Dual Sport and SE trims. Two-wheel-drive Dual Sport models impart the look of a four-wheel-drive truck and feature a raised suspension like the B-Series 4x4s, as well as a monochrome exterior and fender flares. Back to top\n\nB4000 Truck\nIn the B4000, a 207-hp, 4.0-liter V-6 engine teams with either a standard five-speed-manual transmission or an optional five-speed automatic. No regular-cab models are offered. For the 2004 model year, Mazda’s B4000 pickups come in Dual Sport trim with two-wheel drive and a Cab Plus 4 configuration, in SE 4×4 trim with a Cab Plus layout, in base 4×4 Cab Plus trim; and as the SE 4×4 Cab Plus 4.\n\nEach Cab Plus 4 edition features rear-hinged back doors that can’t be opened unless the front doors are open. Dual Sport models have raised suspensions to resemble the four-wheel-drive trucks. Cab Plus 4 models are 202.9 inches long overall with a 125.9-inch wheelbase. Two-wheel-drive pickups have 15-inch wheels, and 4×4 versions ride on 16-inch wheels. An Off-Road Package can be installed on the B4000 4×4 Cab Plus 4, which includes 31-inch tires on 15-inch teardrop alloy wheels, bucket seats with a full-length console, side step tubes and an MP3/CD stereo system.

      "expert_review": "Last year, Mazda took pains to set its B-series truck apart from parent company Ford Motor Co.’s Ranger pickup. You could say the B4000 helped craft a stronger identity for the Japanese automaker, with a leaner body mass, a new logo and sculpted sides.\n\nThis summer, both the Ranger and the B4000 got even more practical with the addition of four-door models – something the competition still doesn’t offer in the compact pickup segment.\n\nOur two-wheel-drive 1999 Mazda B4000, which is built on the same New Jersey assembly line as the Ranger, had a sticker price of $21,340.\n\nShe: If you don’t think utility is hot right now, you should have been shopping with me last weekend. I spent Saturday browsing around a college town and look what I bought, honey.\n\nHe: Dirt?\n\nShe: “Dirt” perfume by a company called Demeter. I had my choice of that or Tomato, Fig Leaf or Sugar Cookie.\n\nHe: I like you better without the Fig Leaf.\n\nShe: But I bought the Dirt. Now that’s what I call not fooling around with fancy names or products. Forget Boucheron or L’Air du Temps. In fact, my new fragrance reminded me of that four-door Mazda B4000 compact pickup truck we tested. Rock-solid utility. No pretensions. And the truck made even more sense than Dirt perfume because at least you get tons of use out of what used to be basically a novelty vehicle with only two doors.\n\nHe: I still like Shalimar a lot better. But I suppose you could use the B4000 to haul your Dirt, right? Actually, we used that Mazda to haul lots of stuff. I always worry about hauling guitars and amplifiers in a pickup bed because they’re exposed to the elements, and you can’t leave them for fear of having something stolen. The beauty of the four-door B4000 is that you can stash everything in the back seat and lock it up. In a pinch, you can also throw one or two adults back there, although they wouldn’t want to travel any great distance in those seats.\n\nShe: Well, most people don’t haul guitars every day, but they do haul coats, purses and briefcases and that’s where the four doors really come in handy. You feel like you have a sedan at your disposal, not a sports car.\n\nHe: You also just put your finger on the B4000’s one weakness. The extra set of doors makes this truck a great everyday utility vehicle, except for the ride. Sorry, folks. This still feels like a truck. Which is not to say the ride quality is unbearable, at least not in the standard two-wheel-drive model. On the plus side, the 4.0-liter V-6 provides lots of pep, even with two or three people aboard. Fuel economy is so-so – with only 16 mpg in city driving.\n\nShe: Going back to my latest purchase – I’m surprised you didn’t ask what I paid for it. Only $12. Almost as much of a bargain as the truck.\n\nHe: That $21,000 sticker on the ’99 truck is actually lower than on a comparably equipped ’98 model. It’s a pretty remarkable price considering all the equipment you get. Our te st model had air conditioning, automatic transmission, power windows and mirrors, a leather-wrapped steering wheel with a tilt column, a sliding rear window, a bedliner, an AM/FM stereo with a cassette player and alloy wheels. Try to find a five-passenger sedan with all those amenities, and the payload capacity of the B4000, for 21 grand.\n\nShe: One nagging concern I have is how you would convince someone to buy this truck over a Ford Ranger. Where’s the benefit? I know the Mazda is designed to appeal to loyal import buyers who may not pick a domestic truck as their first choice. If that’s the case, those people will probably have no problem with the Mazda.",
