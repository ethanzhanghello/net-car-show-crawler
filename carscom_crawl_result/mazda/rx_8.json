      "expert_review": "Sporty Mazda RX-8 a top place finisher\n\nRear clamshell doors enhance the Mazda RX-8’s sleek profile, while a sophisticated-looking interior adds to the coupe’s design.\n\nMazda RX-8 steps out as a distinctively different sort of sports car.\n\nFrom its sweetly smooth and potent rotary engine to its clamshell back doors, RX-8 cuts its own swath among today’s wide-ranging crop of performance machines. Add to that razor-sharp handling and response and lithe styling that looks racy from any angle.\n\nAfter a nine-year absence, Mazda’s rotary engine is back, last seen in the 1995 RX-7. The redesigned rotary, a new generation that Mazda calls Renesis, is unique among automobile engines. Every other internal-combustion engine out there works on the same principal: the exploding fuel pushes down pistons that are connected to a rotating crankshaft.\n\nRX-8’s rotary engine, also known as Wankel after its 1920s German inventor, uses a pair of triangular-shaped rotors that spin through an asymmetrical pattern inside an oval combustion chamber.\n\nThere are still valves and spark plugs, and the fuel is still gasoline. The rotary’s advantage is its compact size, less than half the bulk of a comparable piston engine, while producing considerably more power. Early rotaries had problems with durability and poor fuel mileage, but Mazda seems to have those things licked.\n\nMileage still could be better.\n\nThe engine’s small dimensions allow it to be mounted well aft of the front wheels, producing the neutral handling of a midengine car.\n\nThe clamshell rear doors that open rearward help RX-8 maintain the profile of a two-door sport coupe while permitting access to the back seats. The doors are not new – Saturn had them first – but work out especially well for a car trying to be practical as well as sporting.\n\nMazda, backed with cash from ownership by Ford, has produced some highly favorable automobiles in the past couple of years. The RX-8 provides the halo for the company’s renaissance.\n\nWhat it is\nA four-door sports car dressed as a coupe with enough power and handling finesse to justify its low, lean looks.\n\nPerformance\nRX-8 is the only production car powered by a rotary engine. Mazda and a few European manufacturers experimented with rotaries in the ’60s and ’70s, but the engines earned a bad reputation for blowing seals and smoking up the atmosphere. They were also gas hogs, not a good thing during the ’70s fuel crises.\n\nBy the time RX-7 came out in 1979, the problems were substantially engineered out of the rotary. The RX-8’s engine represents a major step forward. Improvements in intake and exhaust porting give the Renesis engine more power and tractability while producing fewer exhaust emissions.\n\nThe tiny 1.3-liter engine produces 238 horsepower with the six-speed transmission and 197 with automatic, with industry repo rts showing the stickshift version as the overwhelming favorite. Mazda originally overstated engine power, which resulted in a brief controversy and a $500 payback to the original owners.\n\nWhatever the numbers are, the rotary engine provides strong performance across its wide RPM range, with the red line set at a soaring 9,000 rpm. The torque is relatively low, just 159 pound-feet at 5,000 RPM, so standing starts are not all that impressive.\n\nBut once you get those rotors humming, the Mazda hunkers down and runs. On back roads, the engine’s wide power band makes it feel like an expensive European exotic.\n\nFull mileage is disappointing, estimated by EPA at 18 city and 24 highway.\n\nDrivability\nThe RX-8’s remarkable balance makes it a treat to dice through turns, responding well to throttle and steering inputs with an absolutely neutral handling bias.\n\nThe suspension is not harsh, either, letting RX-8 serve as a cross-country touring ca as well as a sports car. It does earn a demerit for road noise, with too much rumble and roar from the performance tires, transmitted to the cabin.\n\nThe steering is assisted electrically, nicely weighted with just enough feedback. The four-wheel disc brakes are really strong, more like Porsche than Mazda.\n\nStyling\nThe back seat with clamshell doors makes the passenger compartment look a bit stretched, but the overall look conveys RX-8s purposeful and athletic intent.\n\nInterior Those back seats are a nice addition, but only if everybody on board is small. Otherwise, consider it a nicely upholstered package compartment. The rear doors make access convenient, not necessarily for passengers but for retrieving those packages.\n\nFront seats are supportive, with plenty of legroom and headroom.\n\nThe dashboard design is fairly generic, though with a quality feel throughout. The gauges are weird, the tachometer small and hard to read and the speedometer an ugly digital affair.\n\nPricing\nWell-equipped, RX-8 starts at a reasonable $26,680 for the six-speed version, or $25,180 for the less-powerful automatic. The test car was decked out with a $4,000 Grand Touring package, which includes Dynamic Stability Control and traction control, xenon headlights, leather upholstery, moonroof, and Bose audio system; $2,000 for a GPS navigation system; $395 for a full-size spare tire; $139 for a body-accent package; and $520 for shipping.\n\nEven loaded with goodies, RX-8 is still a moderate $33,734.\n\nBottom line\nA unique and capable sports car that’s usable as an everyday vehicle and available at a reasonable price.\n\nMazda RX-8\nVehicle type:\nFour-passenger, four-door sports coupe, rear-wheel drive.\n\nBase price:\n$26,680.\n\nPrice as tested:\n$33,734.\n\nEngine:\n1.3-liter twin rotor, 238 horsepower at 8,500 rpm, 159 pound-feet of torque at 5,500 rpm.\n\nTransmission:\nSix-speed stickshift.\n\nWheelbase:\n106.4 inches.\n\nCurb weight:\n3,029 pounds.\n\nEPA mileage:\n18 city, 24 highway.\n\nHighs:\nBalanced handling.\nSmooth engine power.\nAthletic styling.\n\nLows:\nScant engine torque.\nRoad roar.\nUgly gauges.",

      "expert_review": "Even counting exotics, there are few sports cars as unique as the Mazda RX-8. It’s the only rotary-engine car available in the U.S., and it has four seats with rearward-opening back doors on either side, like an extended-cab pickup truck. It’s an odd duck, to be sure.\n\nThe 2011 RX-8’s unique characteristics help distinguish it, but you’ll have to favor finesse over brute force if you’re going to appreciate this car.\n\nYou’ll also have to act quickly; the 2011 model year is the RX-8’s last, marking the end of the rotary engine era — one that never gained much steam.\n\nI tested an RX-8 Grand Touring with an as-tested price of $33,055. To see how the RX-8 compares with two more-conventional sports cars, the Ford Mustang and Nissan 370Z, click here.\n\nRotary Engine Highs & Lows\nIf you relish high-revving power over low-rpm grunt, the RX-8 might be for you. Its 1.3-liter rotary engine’s redline is 9,000 rpm with the six-speed manual transmission, and it makes 232 horsepower at 8,500 rpm. Both of those rpm levels are incredibly high for any production-car engine. (With the six-speed automatic, the engine makes 212 hp at 7,500 rpm, which is also the redline.) You have to be willing to let the engine rev in order to fully enjoy it; if you do, you’ll be treated to a wonderful mechanical symphony as the tachometer swings unrelentingly toward that stratospheric redline.\n\nEven when that’s happening, the RX-8 doesn’t offer forceful acceleration by sports car standards, though it’s entirely acceptable for everyday driving. On the other hand, if you’re unwilling to wind the engine out, you likely won’t be pleased by the RX-8’s performance, as peak torque is an underwhelming 159 pounds-feet at 5,500 rpm. One editor thought the 263-hp, turbocharged four-cylinder from the Mazdaspeed3 would make the RX-8 a more appealing car, and I concur: That engine’s low-end torque — 280 pounds-feet at 3,000 rpm — would go a long way toward improving the car’s overall drivability, if diminishing some of its uniqueness.\n\nAs it is, you must keep the six-speed manual in the correct gear if you hope to keep the engine in its power band. If the rpm drop too low, there’s little power available. Fortunately, the short-throw stick is a joy to shift; it moves precisely from gear to gear with an easy familiarity, giving you confidence the moment you hit the road. The clutch is also forgiving and not overly grabby.\n\nOne of the problems with the rotary is it sucks gas at an alarming rate for such a small engine. At 1.3 liters, the two-rotor engine is one of the smallest available today in the U.S., but its EPA gas mileage estimate of 16/22 mpg city/highway with a manual transmission is akin to a full-size pickup truck’s. It’s true that sports cars aren’t typically the thriftiest on gas, but both the 332-hp Nissan 370Z and the 412-hp Ford Mustang GT get better estimated mileage, with ratings of 18/26 mpg and 17/26 mpg, respectively. With tougher fuel economy rules looming, automakers are looking high and low for ways to improve gas mileage. Perhaps getting rid of the thirsty, rotary-powered RX-8 is an easy one.\n\nRide & Handling\nMazda has done a good job of giving cars like the MX-5 Miata roadster and Mazda3 compact car engaging handling, and that quality is also present in the rear-wheel-drive RX-8. The car feels balanced in corners, though there’s more body roll than I expected given its firm, sporty ride. The RX-8 lacks enough power to make the tail step out with a jab of the gas pedal, so if you’re looking for that kind of fun, consider a Mustang GT instead. The RX-8’s steering has just the right amount of weight to it, but there wasn’t as much feedback as I would have liked.\n\nEven though the ride is firm, it never crosses into unbearable roughness in normal driving. Its responses to minor road imperfections gently remind you that you’re driving a sports car, but it won’t wallop you with the message.\n\nTire noise was especially noticeable. It varied by road surface — with an especially pronounced roar on concrete interstates — but it was always present on the highway.\n\nFour Doors, Four Seats\nI’ve gone back and forth on whether I like the RX-8’s rear-hinged half-doors. A traditional coupe would have yielded more graceful body lines, but the extra doors make it a whole lot easier to get into the backseat. (Though it’s still a pain to install a rear-facing infant seat back there.) Sports cars have never been about practicality, though, and I would go without the easier backseat access if it meant a sleeker two-door coupe shape.\n\nBy sports car standards, the RX-8’s backseat is pretty usable and offers decent headroom, but there’s one caveat: The driver or front passenger can’t be too tall. I’m 6-foot-1, and with the driver’s seat in a comfortable spot for me to depress the clutch and other pedals, there was little legroom left for anyone sitting behind me.\n\nThe RX-8’s cabin materials are decent, with the only really cheap-looking stuff on the front door pulls. Otherwise, the piano-black accents look nice, and the dashboard isn’t muddled by too many controls.\n\nSafety\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety doesn’t usually crash-test sports cars, and it hasn’t tested the RX-8. Standard safety features include side-impact airbags for the front seats, side curtain airbags and antilock brakes. An electronic stability system is optional.\n\nFor a full list of safety features, check out the Standard Equipment & Options page.\n\nRX-8 in the Market\nLike any car purchase, choosing a sports car involves tradeoffs. The fun of a high-horsepower engine is often tempered by its thirst for fuel, but in the RX-8, the thirsty rotary engine doesn’t even offer the kind of power the competition does.\n\nWhile demand for more powerful engines is abating somewhat in the face of heightened gas prices, sports cars are still largely defined by power and style; nimble, light-footed entrants like the RX-8 still play at the edges. The RX-8 has always been the scalpel to the meat cleavers of the sports car world, and if you want to slip behind the wheel of this back-road carver, time is running short.\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nAfter Mazda abandoned its RX-7 sports car at the end of the 1995 model year, fans of rotary engines hoped for a revival. Mazda responded for 2004 with the RX-8.\n\nInstead of a two-door coupe for two passengers, the rear-wheel-drive RX-8 is a four-door sports car that can carry up to four occupants. Rear-hinged half doors permit easier entry into the backseat, and there’s no center pillar to block the way. Weight distribution is balanced 50/50 front to rear.\n\nThe Renesis rotary engine in the RX-8 produces 232 horsepower with a six-speed manual transmission. Cars with the six-speed automatic make 212 hp. Sport, Touring and Grand Touring packages are available.\n\nExterior\nThe front of the RX-8 has an aggressive air intake and displays abundant curves. A power bulge on the low hood features a rotor motif. Short overhangs are coupled with overfenders to enhance the appearance of stability, and functional side vents sit behind the front wheels. The rear-hinged back doors are made of aluminum.\n\nAll models feature standard 18-inch wheels, except for automatic-transmission editions, which come with standard 16-inch wheels. A spare tire isn’t included. A Sport Package includes xenon headlights, fog lamps and the Dynamic Stability Control electronic stability system.\n\nFor 2007, two new colors — Crystal White Pearl and Stormy Blue Mica — are available.\n\nInterior\nThe seats and trim are two-toned in black and the body color. Aluminum accents the console, transmission tunnel and gearshift lever. The front headrests, side sill covers and shift lever have a triangular shape to suggest the engine’s rotors.\n\nLightweight front bucket seats have a rigid molded form, with three bolsters to hold occupants in place. A navigation system is optional.\n\nFor 2007, Grand Touring models have the option of Sand leather-trimmed seats, and a six-CD changer is standard on Touring and Grand Touring models.\n\nUnder the Hood\nMazda’s 1.3-liter twin-rotor engine generates 212 hp at 7,500 rpm and 159 pounds-feet of torque at 5,500 rpm with the six-speed automatic transmission. With the six-speed manual gearbox, it pumps out 232 hp at 8,500 rpm and 159 pounds-feet of torque at 5,500 rpm.\n\nSafety\nAll-disc antilock brakes, side curtain airbags, side-impact airbags and front seat belt pretensioners are standard. Optional Dynamic Stability Control can sense skidding, apply the brakes and control engine torque as needed.\n\nDriving Impressions\nFour doors don’t impair the RX-8’s sports car status. Very little effort is required to extract snappy winding-road performance. The seats are comfortably cushioned to take advantage of the surprisingly good ride. Though it is clearly taut to produce confident control, the suspension takes the edge off all but the worst bumps.\n\nAcceleration is exuberant with the easy-shifting six-speed manual, but it doesn’t top the pack. Other than some tire noise, the RX-8 is quiet.",

      "expert_review": "For all the innovation we hear about in the automotive world, only one vehicle has a genuinely unique engine: the Mazda RX-8 and its rotary.\n\nAnd that means what, exactly?\n\nWell, this: All the other commercially available internal-combustion engines, whether the massive diesel in a Peterbilt truck or the V-12 in a Ferrari, operate on the same basic principle.\n\nAir and fuel ignite in a cylinder, forcing a piston down, which turns a crankshaft, which turns the wheels. Imagine yourself on a bicycle: Your knees are the pistons. An explosion of power sends your left knee down, and your leg (the piston rod) turns the pedals (the crankshaft), which powers the chain (the drive shaft) and connects to the rear wheel (the differential). As your left knee goes down, your right knee comes up, then it goes down, and your left knee comes up: You are, in effect, a human two-cylinder engine.\n\nInstead of pistons that go up and down, a rotary engine has — in the case of the RX-8, anyway — three triangular rotors that spin around inside a cylinder. In a regular engine, when the spark plug ignites gas and fuel, it sends the piston down. In a rotary, it sends the rotors spinning.\n\nI’ve always loved rotary engines in general, Mazda RX’s in particular, especially since I owned one of the original 1979 RX-7s, which was one of my favorite and undeniably most reliable cars ever. I still own a 1987 RX-7 Turbo, and someday I’d like a third-generation RX-7 from the early 1990s, if they ever get cheap enough.\n\nMazda gave the RX sports car nearly a decade off after that third generation, returning in 2004 with the RX-8. This fourth-generation model is what we have now, and for 2009, it received its first styling makeover, and a few mechanical updates. The 2009 model also gets an optional R3 sports package, which the test car had.\n\nThe sport package gets you a firmer suspension, a rear spoiler, body side cladding, a new front bumper and 19-inch aluminum wheels with high-performance tires. Inside, there’s a Bose audio system, Bluetooth cell-phone connectivity, superb Recaro-brand front bucket seats and keyless ignition.\n\nUnder the hood, that 1.3-liter rotary engine pumps out 232 horsepower when mated to a slick-shifting six-speed manual transmission, which the test car had. If you want an automatic transmission, power drops to 212 horsepower.\n\nDespite mild styling updates, the profile is pretty much the same: The presence of half-sized, forward-opening rear doors — which do indeed make it easier to get into the tiny back seat, or more likely, put groceries back there — mandates a slightly lumpy design that is certainly handsome, but not as sporty as, say, the Nissan 370Z.\n\nFrom behind the wheel, though, all is fine: The interior is well-appointed and comfortable, and the instruments and controls are well placed, aside from some audio controls that take some getting used to.\n\nOn the road, the RX-8 handles exceptionally well, and the electric power steering’s feel is as good as the old hydraulic systems. The tires are quite loud on rough pavement, and the ride can be jarring on bumpy roads, but it’s bearable. The rotary engine feels and sounds right, but 232 horsepower doesn’t make it a rocket ship, and typical of rotary engines, fuel mileage is mediocre — EPA-rated at 16 mpg city, and an optimistic 22 mpg on the highway.\n\nI loved the three previous generations of the RX-7, but I’ve only managed to like the RX-8. And while I like it a lot — and at $33,010, loaded with features, it’s a reasonably good buy — it just doesn’t raise my blood pressure.\n\nOf course, as I get older, maybe that’s a good thing.\n\nSteven Cole Smithcan be reached at scsmith@orlandosentinel.com, at 407-420-5699, or through his blog at Enginehead.com.",

      "expert_review": "The RX-8 is the ugly duckling of the automotive world; it doesn’t have the sleekest, prettiest lines, but if you get beyond that and take a seat behind the wheel, you’ll experience a sports car with fine handling abilities. Essentially, the RX-8 lets you feel the pulse of the road.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe RX-8 has been on the road since the 2004 model year, and it’s still one of the more unusually styled sports cars available. Credit the unique front styling, which features large fenders pulled away from the rest of the car, and a cabin that has two extra rear-hinged backdoors for access to the two rear seats. Long and low, the RX-8 definitely looks the part of a sports car, just one that’s decided to break some of the rules about what a sports car should look like.\n\nMazda has a new RX-8 trim level — the 40th Anniversary Edition — for 2008. This model celebrates Mazda’s 40 years of building rotary engines. With this trim level come special badges on the front fenders, attractive 18-inch alloy wheels and a unique paint color: Metropolitan Gray Mica (see a side-by-side comparison with the 2007 model).\n\nRide & Handling\nIf you’re looking for a good-handling car, you’ve found one in the rear-wheel-drive RX-8. It has a balance and naturalness in its dynamics that eludes many sports cars. This sensation is no doubt helped by its perfect 50/50 front-to-rear weight distribution, which Mazda attributes partly to its ability to position the rotary engine low and rearward in the engine bay. The steps it’s taken have worked, as the car just feels right.\n\nIn addition to its superior balance, the RX-8 also has praiseworthy steering response and feel. Even though my test car was equipped with performance winter tires, the RX-8 responded readily to driver commands and exhibited confidence-inspiring high-speed stability. It takes some effort to turn the wheel, which I appreciate in a car with performance aspirations.\n\nLiving with this car, however, could become a trying experience if you drive on roads that are in poor condition. With its sport suspension, the 40th Anniversary Edition RX-8 delivered a jostling experience on Chicago’s ragged roads, which have been hit especially hard by a serious case of potholes this winter. Even if you manage to avoid these monsters waiting to bend the RX-8’s pretty rims, ride quality is still stiff.\n\nGoing & Stopping\nAnother key difference between the RX-8 and other sports cars is the use of a rotary engine instead of the more conventional internal-combustion piston engine. Rotary engines use a rotor that spins within a housing to complete the combustion process, and the design can make a lot of horsepower from a small-displacement engine; the twin-rotor 1.3-liter engine produces 232 horsepower at 8,500 rpm with the six-speed manual transmission (212 hp at 7,500 rpm with the six-speed automatic). It requires premium gas.\n\nIf you’re a fan of high-revving engines like those in the Honda Civic Si or S2000, you may be in heaven with a rotary engine. The RX-8’s engine makes most of its power high in the rpm range — manual transmission models have a 9,000-rpm redline — and it spins with a smoothness that can’t be matched by a piston engine.\n\nThere are some downsides to the rotary. As might be expected from such a small engine, there’s not much low-end torque, which means you can’t get away with leaving the car in the wrong gear like you can with some larger engines. (Fortunately, changing gears is a pleasure thanks to the RX-8’s manual transmission, which I’ll discuss below.)\n\nThe other negative is gas mileage; the RX-8 gets an EPA-estimated 16/22 mpg city/highway with the manual and 16/23 mpg with the automatic. Compare that to the Nissan 350Z coupe, which is heaver and has a 306-hp, 3.5-liter V-6 but gets 18/25 mpg with a six-speed manual.\n\nSpeaking of manual transmissions, the one in the RX-8 is a willing companion in your driving endeavors. It has short throws and a slightly mechanical feel, and the clutch pedal only requires light effort from your foot. Sure-footed stopping performance is provided by an antilock braking system that includes ventilated disc brakes at each wheel.\n\nThe Inside\nAn agreeable driving position and comfortable seats make the RX-8’s cockpit a nice place for driving. The steering wheel and shifter both fall to hand easily. The 40th Anniversary Edition features special Cosmo Red leather seats that are supportive and have enough bolstering to keep you in place during fast cornering. Heated seats are optional, but they only have “on” and “off” settings — you can’t adjust the temperature lower or higher like you can in some cars.\n\nIf you take a minute to look around the RX-8’s cabin, you’ll see numerous reminders that there’s a rotary engine under the hood; the front seats have a rotor-like triangular opening in the head restraints, and there’s another rotor design on top of the shifter. The instrument panel features a large tachometer and supplementary gauges, but no traditional speedometer. Instead, there’s a digital speedometer integrated into the face of the tach. Though different, I never found this setup jarring when driving the car.\n\nEven though the rear-hinged backdoors make it easier to get into the backseat, there’s not a lot of room once you’re there. The rear bucket seats are nicely shaped, but legroom is lacking and headroom is limited, too. While this may not sound great, it is worlds better than some of the spaces other sports-car makers try to pass off as rear seats.\n\nCargo\nThe RX-8 has a traditional trunk with a pass-thru to the cabin for carrying long, skinny items inside the car. At 7.6 cubic feet, the trunk’s size is respectable; it’s large enough to carry a couple small suitcases or duffel bags.\n\nSafety\nSide-impact airbags for the front seats and side curtain airbags are standard. An electronic stability system is standard on all models besides the base, Sport trim level.\n\nRX-8 in the Market\nThere aren’t many sports cars out there like the RX-8. It’s the only rotary-powered production car available in the U.S., and it’s one of the few cars out there with rear-hinged backdoors. Its biggest shortcoming is that you can buy a lot more horsepower in a competitor like the 350Z for about the same amount of money. Horsepower still matters more than handling prowess for many sports car buyers, but even the Z doesn’t give up a lot to the RX-8 in the handling department. The RX-8 is a feather to the Z’s hammer, and here in the U.S. it’s hard to see the hammer losing.\n\n\nSend Mike an email",
