      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Mazda CX-90?\n\nThe Mazda CX-90 is an all-wheel-drive three-row mid-size SUV that can be configured with six, seven or eight seats. While it’s priced against mainstream three-row SUVs, it’s assembled on a sophisticated rear-wheel-drive platform like those used by luxury brands such as BMW and Mercedes-Benz. Power comes from a pair of mild-hybrid turbocharged inline-six engines tuned to run on either regular or premium gas. The lower-output engine generates 280 horsepower, while the high-output six-cylinder makes 319 hp on regular gas and 340 hp on premium. There’s also a plug-in hybrid powertrain that uses a 2.5-liter four-cylinder paired with an electric motor and a 17.8-kilowatt-hour battery; the PHEV makes 323 hp on premium fuel and can travel 26 miles on electricity alone. The Mazda CX-90’s competitors include the Honda Pilot, Hyundai Palisade, Kia Telluride and Toyota Grand Highlander.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Mazda CX-90?\n\nA new Premium Sport trim level joins the family, available with the lower-output turbo engine or plug-in hybrid powertrain. It features black 21-inch wheels and black exterior trim and badging. The Preferred Plus trim level has been dropped, and Turbo Preferred and higher trim levels get a larger 12.3-inch touchscreen standard.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Mazda CX-90 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n10.25-inch infotainment display\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nWi-Fi\nEight speakers\nKeyless entry and start\nPower liftgate\nSynthetic leather upholstery\nTri-zone automatic climate control\nForward collision warning \nAutomatic emergency braking\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nLane departure steering assist \nAdaptive cruise control\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nRegular or panoramic moonroof\nLeather upholstery\nNappa leather upholstery\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated second-row seats\nHeated steering wheel\nWireless charging pad\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\n12.3-inch infotainment touchscreen\n12-speaker Bose audio system\nHead-up display\nFront cross-traffic alert\nRoad-sign recognition\nSurround-view parking camera system\nFront and rear parking sensors\nShould I Buy the 2025 Mazda CX-90?\n\nThe CX-90 stands out from its mainstream peers with a decidedly upmarket finish and refined driving behavior, though the ride gets a little rough on the available 21-inch wheels. The mild-hybrid tech is seamlessly integrated; the transmission shifts smoothly, and there’s no change in brake pedal feel during the switch from regenerative to mechanical braking. Pricing for upper trim levels edges into luxury territory, but the CX-90’s cabin materials and finish justify the asking price. Shoppers with larger families, however, may find the Mazda’s third-row seat too tight for their needs.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The all-new 2024 Mazda CX-90 has characteristics that are more typically seen in German luxury SUVs than the mainstream models it’s more likely to be compared with, but it’s these attributes that help give the CX-90 engaging driving manners that elevate its driving experience above the mainstream competition.\n\nVersus the competition: Priced between family-oriented and luxury three-row SUVs, the CX-90 delivers a rewarding driving experience that’s on par with premium offerings, but its interior isn’t as roomy as more family-focused models.\n\nMazda has been trying to position itself as a premium brand for a while now, and the new CX-90 is the latest model in that effort. Expected to eventually replace the CX-9 in Mazda’s lineup, the CX-90 represents a complete rethink of what a Mazda three-row SUV should be. It uses an all-new rear-drive-based platform and introduces three new powertrains — two turbocharged inline-six-cylinder engines with 48-volt mild-hybrid technology and a plug-in hybrid powertrain that offers 26 miles of all-electric range on a full charge, according to Mazda. The changes continue on the inside, too, with the choice of seating for six, seven or eight people, plus an all-new interior with upscale materials and design cues on higher-trim models that further underscore Mazda’s intention to distinguish itself from mainstream brands.\n\nStill, the question remains: Will this effort to redefine Mazda in the minds of car shoppers work?\n\nRelated: 2024 Mazda CX-90: New Mild Hybrid, PHEV Powertrains Bring Big Boost\n\nTo find out whether the CX-90 is worth its premium positioning, we traveled at Mazda’s invitation to San Francisco to drive Turbo S and PHEV CX-90s for the first time. (Cars.com pays for its own airfare and lodging when attending such automaker-sponsored events.) As you might expect, there are some notable differences in the way the two drive, but regardless of which drivetrain you choose, the CX-90 rewards enthusiast drivers who need some room for the family and their stuff.\n\nThe Benefits of a Traditional Layout\n\nThe CX-90’s new platform and powertrains represent a significant change from the outgoing CX-9’s front-drive-based platform and turbocharged four-cylinder powertrain, but the move to this more traditional layout, with a longitudinally mounted engine in the front, delivers driving benefits that align with Mazda’s sporty image.\n\nFor one, the CX-90 is poised whether you’re on the highway or on a winding two-lane road, with overall balance and stability that’s confidence-inspiring. It’s easy to precisely place the CX-90 where you want, but considering the SUV’s otherwise sporty demeanor, the steering doesn’t deliver that much feedback.\n\nAll models have a double-wishbone front and multilink rear suspension that dispatches with pavement bumps and imperfections in a refined way. Ride quality with the available 21-inch wheels and tires is firm (and might be too stiff for some), but the suspension isn’t unsettled by pockmarked roads. The CX-90’s standard 19-inch wheels and their taller-sidewall tires might be worth a look if you’re concerned about ride firmness.\n\nIt also helps that the new platform is paired with some impressive powertrains. Both the Turbo S and PHEV complement the CX-90’s sporty character by making the SUV feel swift enough in everyday driving.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nRated at 340 horsepower and 369 pounds-feet of torque when using premium gas (319 hp on regular), the turbocharged 3.3-liter inline-six-cylinder in the Turbo S is a smooth-revving engine that pairs with a responsive eight-speed automatic transmission. I was also impressed with the integration of the 48-volt mild-hybrid system with this engine. Oftentimes, drivetrain smoothness and refinement takes a hit with these fuel-saving systems, but that’s not the case here; the 48-volt system is unobtrusive overall, and accelerator- and brake-pedal response is predictable. Both the Turbo S and 280-hp Turbo version get a manufacturer-estimated 25 mpg combined, which is good for a three-row SUV — especially considering the inline-six’s output. In the CX-90’s Normal drive mode, gas-pedal response is gradual, but switching to Sport mode heightens drivetrain responsiveness. The eight-speed automatic is a Mazda-designed transmission that trades a conventional torque converter for a wet clutch, and this transmission is well matched to the inline-six and readily downshifts when you want more power.\n\nThe available PHEV powertrain offers the possibility of even greater efficiency. Featuring a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine, electric motor, eight-speed automatic and 17.8-kilowatt-hour battery pack, the PHEV makes 323 hp and 369 pounds-feet of torque on premium (319 hp on regular). In addition to its 26 miles of all-electric range, Mazda says it also gets 25 mpg combined when the all-electric range is depleted.\n\nDriving the PHEV after the turbo inline-six in the Turbo S revealed some interesting differences between the two. The PHEV experience is refined overall, with perhaps the biggest shortcoming versus the inline-six-powered CX-90 being its sometimes spongy brake-pedal feel. It also has weaker acceleration along with more noticeable ambient noise when operating on electric power alone.\n\nHow the PHEV operates depends on the drive mode you’ve selected. In Normal mode, the gas engine frequently kicks on — even when the battery has plenty of charge left — and in Sport mode, the system relies even more on the gas engine to deliver better performance that feels similar to the inline-six’s. If you want the PHEV to avoid using the gas engine, EV mode lets you do that; as long as there’s adequate battery power, the CX-90 will operate using the electric motor. There’s a noticeable decrease in power in this mode, but if you’re in an emergency situation and floor the accelerator pedal, the gas engine will fire up for stronger acceleration. Finally, the PHEV also has a Charge setting that uses the four-cylinder engine as a generator to charge the battery pack. A gas engine isn’t the most efficient way to charge a battery, but if you want to replenish some all-electric range while driving, you can.\n\nMazda representatives didn’t have the charging-rate specification for the PHEV’s onboard charger, but the automaker does have charge-time information for different service types. On a household outlet, Mazda says it’ll take 11 hours for the battery to go from 0%-100%. With a Level 2 home charger on a 30-amp circuit, the charging time drops to 2 hours and 20 minutes.\n\nA Classy, if Not Overly Large, Interior\n\nBoth the Turbo S and PHEV models I tested were top-of-the-line Premium Plus trim levels with price tags around $60,000. That’s luxury SUV territory, but the interior quality and materials in these models are comparable to what you’ll find in similarly priced luxury SUVs. The CX-90 offers a choice of seating for six, seven or eight people, depending on the configuration of the second and third rows. The seats are finished in Nappa leather upholstery, the first and second rows are heated and ventilated, and the Turbo S has maple wood accents and unique fabric trim on the dashboard. From how the various materials feel to the way the interior looks, there’s a niceness about it that makes the premium pricing slightly easier to bear.\n\nWhat you don’t get is extra space. Though the CX-90 feels as roomy or slightly roomier than the outgoing CX-9, the cabin isn’t as roomy as some three-row SUVs. The front seats are comfortable, if a tad firmly cushioned, but my right leg was constantly bumping against the wide center console, which doesn’t offer much benefit for being so wide with its small storage bin and small cupholders.\n\nThe available second-row captain’s chairs slide, recline and are comfortable for taller adults, who should have legroom to spare. The third row has better headroom than the CX-9 both by Mazda’s measurements and by my impressions, but there’s not much in the way of legroom, making this seat best for smaller children who may still be in booster seats or just graduating from them.\n\nThere’s hardly any cargo room behind the third row — Mazda says there’s 14.9 cubic feet in CX-90s with the three-person third row and 15.9 cubic feet with the two-person seat — but this lack of space isn’t unique among three-row crossovers, which often have little in the way of cargo space when all seats are in use. There’s 40 cubic feet of space when the third row is folded flat, according to Mazda’s measurements.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nMazda Announces 2024 CX-90 Pricing and Packages, Starts at $40,970\n2024 Mazda CX-90 Up Close: Mazda’s Crown Jewel?\n2023 Mazda CX-9 Drops Sport Trim, Starting Price Scales $40,000\nWhat’s New With SUVs for 2023?\nShop for a 2024 Mazda CX-90\nFrustrating Tech\n\nThe most disappointing aspect of the CX-90 is its multimedia system, which continues to rely on a console knob controller for most functions. The system’s menu structure isn’t the most intuitive, and it’s all the more frustrating because the dashboard screen is within reach of the driver, so a touch-based interface could be possible. CX-90s with the available 12.3-inch infotainment screen do offer touch control for the Apple CarPlay and Android Auto interfaces, but not the native Mazda interface. Touch-based controls for all interfaces — and a rethink of Mazda’s on-screen menus — could go a long way toward improving a system that’s frustrating to use.\n\n2024 Mazda CX-90 PHEV | Cars.com photo by Leslie Cunningham\nIs the CX-90 Right for You?\n\nWith its all-new platform and new powertrains, the CX-90 puts the focus squarely on driving performance. It’s a bit of an odd way to position a large three-row SUV that’s fighting the laws of physics more than most types of vehicles, but if that’s the kind of vehicle you’re looking for, and you care about driving dynamics, the CX-90 is worth adding to your shopping list.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
