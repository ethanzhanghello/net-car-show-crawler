      "expert_review": "With the CX-7, Mazda has called the bluff of those SUV critics who insist they wouldn’t consider an SUV until somebody built one that drove and handled like a sporty car, and sold it for a reasonable price.\n\nAnd judging from CX-7 sales — in the very healthy 3,500-a-month neighborhood — a lot of those potential customers have anted up. This is an SUV for people who would not be caught dead in a Chevrolet Suburban, or probably even a Mazda Tribute. “Always the soul of a sports car,” says the CX-7’s window sticker, and that’s plausible.\n\nIt begins under the hood with a turbocharged 2.3-liter, 244-horsepower four-cylinder engine, matched to a six-speed automatic transmission. Base price for the front-wheel-drive CX-7 is around $24,000, and this is a bargain, as regardless of the trim level, all CX-7s have that same spirited engine and transmission.\n\nThe test CX-7 was a Grand Touring all-wheel-drive model, and it started at $28,000, and topped out at just more than $30,000 with freight and a few options, including a power sunroof, Sirius satellite radio and an upgraded 240-watt Bose sound system.\n\nThe all-wheel-drive is a nice feature, especially if you live in a world of frequently slick roads. Don’t for a moment confuse the CX-7 all-wheel-drive with a more conventional SUV’s four-wheel-drive, as the CX-7 is no off-roader. It lacks ground clearance, low-range gearing and underbelly protection from rocks and such. Really, average drivers likely couldn’t tell the FWD from the AWD model, as it operates seamlessly, and comes into play only when you need the extra traction. The CX-7 has electronic stability control and traction control, and that’s all most drivers need.\n\nIndeed, our CX-7 was very well-equipped, with leather upholstery, heated front seats, xenon headlamps and side and side-curtain airbags. There’s still more plastic in the interior than I’d like (plastic that looks like plastic, anyway), but it’s a comfortable cockpit up front, and it isn’t bad for rear-seat passengers. If you need a third-row seat, there’s the larger Mazda CX-9, but that’s a different vehicle.\n\nOn the road, the CX-7 definitely handles far better than the average SUV, with negligible body lean and quick steering. To get that degree of nimbleness, you sacrifice some ride quality; smooth roads are fine, but rough pavement can get tiresome. The big 18-inch tires, on alloy wheels, generate moderate road noise.\n\nIt’s tough to fault the engine and transmission: Power is plentiful, delivered smoothly. Fuel mileage is nothing special at an EPA-rated 18 miles per gallon city, 24 mpg highway, premium gas preferred.\n\nMileage, though, is likely low on a CX-7 buyer’s criteria. That customer wants performance, and the CX-7 delivers.",

      "expert_review": "I have a pair of comfy, weathered, totally fashionable Frye boots that I consider the most versatile accessory in my closet. I wear these boots with everything from jeans to girly, twirly dresses. They can cap off the ultimate fashion statement, or I can wear them to work in a field and feel just as good about the whole thing. (I haven’t tested that theory out in real life, but I’m sure it’s true.) I wear them all the time.\n\nAfter driving it for a few days, I decided the 2008 Mazda CX-7 is just like these favorite boots. It’s practical, stylish and very versatile. Check out how it compares to last year’s model here.\n\nIt was snowing like mad the day I got the car, and the all-wheel-drive CX-7 didn’t bat an eyelash; it plowed me through the snow without a problem. Heated side-view mirrors and a fast-acting defrost on the front windshield put me at ease in the near-whiteout conditions, and the Dynamic Stability Control and Traction Control System worked to give me a smooth, slip-free ride. All these standard features, together with the standard seat warmers in front, add up to a vehicle that can handle the snowiest of days with ease. They also served to make me a lot more relaxed, which is a huge plus given that we all know busy moms do not need extra stress.\n\nThe day after the snowstorm was 75 degrees and sunny (and if you don’t believe that you’ve obviously never been to Colorado). With an open sunroof (optional but worth it in my opinion) and the air conditioning on low, we were feeling pretty good about the world. Topping it off was the optional Bose stereo system, which sounded good enough to keep me in the car a few more minutes than was strictly necessary.\n\nThe Bose system is part of the optional Technology Package. If you have $4K to spare, it’s a worthy investment. Not only do you get the kickin’ stereo, but there’s also a DVD navigation system with voice command and a rearview camera. This was the first time I’d driven a car with a rearview camera for an extended period of time, and I will now make sure that the next car I buy has one. With little kids running around and toys everywhere, it’s a very useful accessory. I must note, though, that as with fashion, accessories in cars should only serve to highlight natural savvy. In short, even with a rearview camera, you should walk all the way around your vehicle before getting in and pulling out (as our friends at www.kidsandcars.com tell us).\n\nAs a final test for the CX-7, we headed to the mountains so my hubby could get in one last day of skiing this season. My son’s car seat was a breeze to install, and the CX-7 showed plenty of power climbing hills at altitude. We could have used a bit more storage space, though. Without a ski rack, we had to maneuver the skis in at an odd angle because the backseat doesn’t have a pass-thru. The rear cargo space is also a little smaller than I would like.\n\nMy only real issue with the car, though, is its gas mileage: 16/22 mpg city/highway. That isn’t unique to the CX-7, but with the ever-rising price of gas, it’s tough to justify using a full tank ($55 to fill up) to go up and down the mountain. When I know there are cars out there that make that drive more efficiently, it’s hard for me to consider purchasing a car that can’t. Still, we had a zoom-zoomy good time in this car, just as Mazda tells people they will. And who knows, maybe if my favorite boots required gas they’d be guzzlers too. Perhaps that’s just the price of versatility.\n\n*For more information on the 2008 Mazda CX-7 and its safety features, visit Cars.com.

      "expert_review": "In the spirit of the cold and flu season, I’m pretty sure I’ve caught the bug – the Mazda zoom-zoom bug, that is. I’ve now driven two very different Mazdas – the Mazda5 and CX-7 – and I really enjoyed the way both cars meshed just the right amount of fun with everyday usability.\n\nThe CX-7 is a sporty-looking crossover with superb, spunky performance to match. I had so much fun testing this one in the snow that I’d rate it a blast in any blizzard. When it came to fit and finish, the interior was comfy and enjoyable for the entire family (even the dog snuggled in; see the photo gallery).\n\nEven with added features like the Technology Package with a premium Bose stereo system (you don’t know how valuable this is until you’ve tried it), my test CX-7 came in under $35,000. Practicality, price and performance – the perfect package!\n\nSnazzy snazziness! This crossover refuses to ride along in the boring mom-mobile category; just look at its sharp headlights and chiseled front end. Mazda does a great job of fully incorporating its speedy reputation into the look of its vehicles.\n\nEase of entry was an issue with the little guys, but I’m starting to understand that SUV/crossover owners have probably gotten used to this challenge and might not be as sensitive to it as I am.\n\nThe fog lights added to the CX-7’s sporty look, and side-mirror-integrated turn signals added some bling-factor. The dual exhaust tips gave the CX-7 some sporty spice. Is there something about those twin tailpipes that give a car a kid-friendly, rocket-ship-like appearance, or is that just me?\n\nSpeaking of rocket ships, my CX-7 was painted Galaxy Gray Mica. If it were my choice, I’d have opted for the cool pale blue of the Icy Blue Metallic or the sumptuous juiciness of the Black Cherry Mica. Mmmmm!\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\n\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Groove On\n\nGive Mazda a “value-added’ bonus, because my Grand Touring CX-7 came with leather-trimmed seats standard. My CX-7 had black leather seats; normally I’d opt for a lighter color, but a simple puff of air cleaned these seats up in a jiffy. I know this because my dog fell in love with the heated seats in this car (oh yeah, there are pictures) and left a hairy mess all over the passenger seat. As soon as I opened the front doors, Harry’s hair went wafting out with the breeze.\n\nMy CX-7 had other fun features, like a rearview camera that came with the optional Technology Package. This package also provided the phenomenal nine Bose speakers that the kids and I jammed to all week long (we were listening to an all-Christmas-music, all-the-time station; I don’t know if you can really jam to “Silent Night,’ but we did our best).\n\nWhile we were rockin’ out, I did test another favorite feature: the CX-7’s SportShift mode. Honestly, the CX-7 is speedy enough with just the standard automatic, but it’s always fun to try and kick it up a notch with a little sportshifting here and there. The CX-7 didn’t disappoint. In SportShift mode, there was a little extra kick of power with every gear change that made the CX-7 the perfect family car for a mom who was a racecar driver in another life.\n\nI wasn’t a fan of the second row’s seat belt for the center position because it hung from the ceiling and impaired my rear view, but the kids were quite comfy in the backseat. I was pleased that the Latch connectors were easy to locate.\n\nThere was cargo space aplenty in the CX-7. I made several trips to the grocery store while testing this car and never had to worry about having enough space. I even considered picking up a Christmas tree with it, but decided to hold off to give our Thanksgiving turkey a moment to shine in the cargo area.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nPeople want to feel safe in their car, but what really makes this happen for drivers? Constantly running through the car’s list of safety features while driving? Keeping a sticky note on the dash with the car’s crash-test ratings from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety?\n\nIn the CX-7, it’s the cars actions that make you feel safe. We received more than 6 inches of snow the week I test-drove this car. My driveway slopes down from the road, so our first obstacle in snowy weather is getting out of the driveway. Every type of car imaginable has gotten stuck in our driveway. My boys and I even have a song we sing as my poor hubby tries to escape the snowy driveway drifts: “Go, Daddy, go! Go, Daddy, go! Get that truck out of the snow!’ Sometimes it works. When my turn came to get down the driveway in the CX-7, I expected at least a little bit of a challenge. NOPE! Nothing. We got out of the driveway and onto our snow-covered road in seconds – a total cinch. There wasn’t a slip, slide or swivel; we just drove straight onto the road as if the driveway were completely clear. This, my friends, is traction control and all-wheel drive working together to keep the car where it’s supposed to be.\n\nIn case you still want to keep a running list of safety features in your head, here they are in no particular order: AWD, traction control, stability control, front- and side-impact airbags, side curtain airbags for both rows, antilock brakes with electronic brake-force distribution, and brake assist.\n\nFAMILY LIFESTAGE\n\nIn Diapers: It has plenty of space for those cumbersome infant-safety seats, diaper bags and strollers.\n\nIn School: Small children might have some difficulty getting in and out of the CX-7, but it was still a transgenerational hit!\n\nTeens: Even teens will want to be seen in this great-looking ride.",

      "expert_review": "I wanted to adore the 2010 Mazda CX-7, but every time I drove it I could only think of one word: vanilla. The mildly restyled CX-7 looks a little sporty, but it doesn’t stand out in a crowd — even with its love-it-or-hate-it smiling grille. Where’s Mazda’s Zoom-Zoom factor?\n\nIt’s not under the hood. A crossover of this heft, with Mazda’s spunky reputation, needs more oomph under the hood. I was in an all-out pout while driving the CX-7, wondering why it couldn’t be more powerful. My test car, a CX-7 Sport trim, came with a four-cylinder engine, and I learned quickly that I couldn’t make a hasty move in traffic because this car didn’t have the power to back it up. Higher trim levels come with a turbocharged four-cylinder engine; I guess that’s where the Zoom-Zoom is hiding. The CX-7’s MSRP starts at $21,700; my test car cost $26,190.\n\nI may catch a lot of heat from Mazda fans for saying so, but I also wasn’t impressed with the CX-7’s handling. Don’t get me wrong, it was fine, but I can get fine out of most cars. With a Mazda I expect more from a performance perspective, and the CX-7 didn’t come through for me this time.\n\nThe CX-7 left me longing for something — power, cool features or styling — thrilling.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe CX-7’s looks are certainly consistent with the rest of the Mazda family. In fact, it really reminded me of an inflated Mazda3. From the side, the CX-7 looked like an oblong bubble that hasn’t been released from the bubble wand. Take a look for yourself. I did like the way both the headlights and taillights crept around the crossover’s corners. It adds some interest to this otherwise bland-looking crossover.\n\nMy test car had the new 161-horsepower, 2.5-liter inline-four-cylinder engine, but I couldn’t help but long for more horses under the hood during my test drive. I would’ve preferred the 244-hp, turbocharged 2.3-liter inline-four-cylinder engine. There was a plus side to my test car’s non-turbo engine: It gets an EPA-estimated 20/28 mpg city/highway and takes regular gas. The turbo engine takes premium gas and gets 18/25 mpg.\n\nMy boys were able to climb easily into the CX-7, and I was able to open the liftgate without any problems. I would’ve liked a power liftgate with an auto-close button, though.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Some\n\nINTERIOR\nThe CX-7’s interior is more cumbersome than comfy with its plump seating and bulging center stack, which has oversized knobs and dials.\n\nEven with the standard tilt/telescoping steering wheel, I wasn’t able to find a comfortable driving position in the five-seater. My test car had a Sport Convenience Package ($1,750) that added heated seats, which I enjoyed, automatic climate control, a power-adjustable driver’s seat, power moonroof and a backup camera.\n\nThe CX-7 has a sizable bi-level center console and a handy cubby in front of the gearshift. There’s also two cupholders within easy reach of the driver’s seat and two cupholders in the backseat’s armrest.\n\nMy boys were comfortable in the backseat, but a teen or an adult will find the legroom to be lacking. The backseat doesn’t slide or recline.\n\nThe cargo area is large enough to handle the bags from a day filled with errands. If you’re thinking of hitting the garden center, the folded rear seats create an almost-flat floor and the seatbacks and cargo area have a plastic coating that makes cleanups easy.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSAFETY\nThe CX-7’s lower Latch anchors sit behind slits in the backseat’s fabric. They’re easy to find, but I had problems using them with my sons’ booster seats. Our booster seats have rigid Latch connectors that can’t be adjusted. In the CX-7, I couldn’t get the boosters to work correctly with its Latch anchors. When I got the rigid Latch connectors attached to the anchors, the booster seats covered the seat belt receptors. I had to dig out our old-school booster seats and move them closer to the windows, freeing up the seat belt receptors for easy buckling.\n\nThe lack of legroom in the second row could be problematic for those installing rear-facing convertible and infant-safety seats.\n\nThe CX-7 has standard antilock brakes with brake assist, stability control and traction control. It also has standard front- and side-impact airbags for the front row and side curtain airbags for both rows.\n\nAll-wheel drive is optional on trim levels with the turbo engine. It also has an optional backup camera and a blind spot warning system.\n\nI didn’t have a blind spot warning system in my test car, but I wish I had. I often found that the CX-7’s pillars around the crossover impeded my visibility.\n\nGet more safety information on the 2010 Mazda CX-7 here.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in February 2010 about the 2010 Mazda CX-7. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2011, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nMazda brought its signature “Zoom-Zoom” performance to the small crossover arena with the launch of the turbocharged CX-7 a few years ago. That model is an energetic performer, but the small crossover segment consists mostly of models focused on more practical considerations, like utility and gas mileage. It seems Mazda got that message, as the CX-7 now offers a more efficient, non-turbocharged base engine in addition to the turbo four-cylinder. It also gains some styling tweaks inside and out for 2010.\n\nFor better or worse, the new base engine makes the CX-7 behave more similarly to some of its four-cylinder competition, including the Honda CR-V. Its gas mileage is more competitive with the non-turbo engine — the base front-wheel-drive CX-7 is rated 20/28 mpg city/highway — but it lacks the turbo’s strong acceleration, leaving drivers with a modestly powered crossover that’s quick enough, but not exceptionally so.\n\nHappy-Face Looks\nThe biggest styling difference between the 2010 and 2009 CX-7 is that the 2010 adopts a version of Mazda’s grinning grille, which has already shown its face on the redesigned Mazda3 compact car, among other Mazdas. While the design is a little too forceful on the Mazda3, the CX-7’s treatment is more subtle and helps keep the design fresh. To see a side-by-side comparison of the 2009 and 2010 CX-7, click here.\n\nModestly Powered Base Engine\nThe base 161-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder provides acceptable performance in city and suburban settings. Acceleration is quick enough, letting you keep pace with traffic. Where the engine starts to falter is on the highway; it quickly loses steam when you need to merge or accelerate around a slower-moving car. The bottom line is that you need to plan your moves on the highway, because traffic has a tendency to rapidly get bigger in your rearview mirror. Cruising on the highway is another story, though, as the CX-7 isn’t taxed as long as you’re just keeping pace with the cars around you. Overall, the base four-cylinder feels quite a bit less powerful than the turbo engine, which offers forceful acceleration.\n\nThe base engine works with a five-speed automatic transmission that drives the front wheels. To get all-wheel drive, you have to choose the more powerful, less efficient turbo four-cylinder, which pairs with a six-speed automatic. The five-speed automatic shifts smoothly when accelerating from a stop, but it’s slow to react while rolling along in traffic. Overall, the transmission isn’t as refined as the continuously variable automatic transmission in the Nissan Rogue.\n\nThe new four-cylinder brings the CX-7’s gas mileage estimates closer to the competition, and unlike the turbo four-cylinder, which prefers premium gas, the base engine runs on regular. The competition has also been working on fuel economy though, with models like the Chevrolet Equinox and Hyundai Tucson becoming more efficient with recent redesigns.\n\nSmall Crossover Gas Mileage\nEPA-estimated city/highway mpg for base four-cylinder and automatic transmission\n \tFWD\tAWD\n2010 Chevrolet Equinox\t22/32\t20/29\n2010 Ford Escape\t21/28\t20/26\n2010 Honda CR-V\t21/28\t21/27\n2010 Hyundai Tucson\t23/31\t21/28\n2010 Mazda CX-7\t20/28\t—\n2010 Nissan Rogue\t22/27\t21/26\n2010 Subaru Forester\t—\t20/26\n2010 Toyota RAV4\t22/28\t21/27\nSource: EPA\n\nThe CX-7 does have admirable brake-pedal feel. Braking response corresponds naturally with how hard you depress the pedal, which makes smooth stops second nature.\n\nFirm Ride\nDespite losing much of the performance the turbocharged model offers, the CX-7 with the base four-cylinder still has sporty handling for a small crossover. This has its pros and cons.\n\nOn the plus side, the CX-7 has the kind of light-effort, responsive steering that we appreciate in Mazda cars, like the Mazda3. The CX-7 also resists body roll when cornering. On the downside, while the CX-7’s firm suspension does transmit pavement imperfections to the cabin, the bigger negative of its suspension tuning is that the ride can become choppy on certain highway surfaces, like concrete interstates.\n\nEven though the CX-7’s 37.4-foot turning circle isn’t the largest in its class, it feels big when maneuvering in a parking lot or other confined space. What this means is that it might take a few more back-and-forth moves to pull into or out of a tight parking space.\n\nCabin\nMild cabin revisions include a newly available dash-top screen that lets you cycle between radio station presets and trip computer information. When you put the CX-7 in Reverse, the screen shows an image of what’s behind the crossover courtesy of the backup camera that’s included with the screen.\n\nIt’s easy to cycle through the screen’s various functions using the steering-wheel controls, but the positioning of the display — very close to the base of the windshield — makes it a little distracting; you can see it out the corner of your eye when driving. The CX-7’s dashboard controls are thoughtfully arranged and easy to use, and the CX-7 has a standard tilt/telescoping steering wheel for enhanced driver comfort and safety.\n\nThe driver and front passenger sit on bucket seats with available power adjustments and seat heaters. Mazda says both the standard cloth and available leather upholstery are new, and the cloth seats in my test car featured a premium, flowing design. The cushioning is supportive without being too hard, but the seat itself is a little small; while it might be fine for shorter drivers, I’m a little more than 6 feet tall and could have used a larger seat.\n\nThe CX-7’s backseat isn’t particularly roomy for adults. My knees were touching the back of the driver’s seat (which was adjusted to where I’d have it), and the distance from the seat to the floor left me sitting with my knees and legs elevated — and not much thigh support. Unlike the Equinox and Toyota RAV4, the CX-7’s backseat doesn’t give passengers the ability to slide or recline it to suit their whims.\n\nCargo\nMazda has done a nice job arranging the CX-7’s cargo area. The space measures 29.9 cubic feet with the backseat up and 58.6 cubic feet when it’s folded, but perhaps more importantly, the few intrusions there — like bump-outs along the cargo walls — are mostly tucked out of the way.\n\nFolding the backseat is a simple process you can manage from the cargo area thanks to handles in the walls. Pulling a handle releases a backrest section, or you can release them from the second row by pressing a button on the backrest and folding down. When folded, the backrests are nearly flat with the cargo floor, resting on just a slight incline.\n\nSafety\nIn Insurance Institute for Highway Safety testing, the CX-7 received a Good overall rating — the highest possible score — for its performance in frontal-offset and side-impact crash tests. The IIHS also assesses how well vehicles protect against whiplash injuries in rear-impact collisions, and in this test the Grand Touring trim level of the CX-7 scored Marginal. As of publication, the CX-7 hasn’t been subjected to the IIHS’ new roof-strength test.\n\nStandard safety features include antilock brakes, side-impact airbags for the front seats, side curtain airbags for both rows, and an electronic stability system. The top-of-the-line Grand Touring trim level has a blind spot warning system.\n\nCheck out a full list of safety features on the Standard Equipment & Specs page.\n\nCX-7 in the Market\nThe CX-7 sells in much smaller numbers than the popular CR-V and RAV4. Up until now, its turbocharged engine has made it a unique offering in the small crossover segment, but the CX-7’s appeal now seems poised to grow thanks to its new base engine and improved gas mileage. A new, lower price won’t hurt, either, as the CX-7 now starts at $21,550, which is $2,350 less than its base price last year.\n\nSend Mike an email",
