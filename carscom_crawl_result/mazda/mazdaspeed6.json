      "expert_review": "I live in a typical suburban neighborhood – lots of houses, three-car garages, neatly trimmed yards, swing sets, and kids riding bikes in the cul-de-sac. Most of the cars that line the driveways and garages are very practical. I guess my neighbors are looking for some excitement in their lives because they all came out to ogle at the 2006 Mazda Speed6 when I pull into my driveway. It is one hot little number with its speedy purpose clear in its design.\n\nJust a hunch, but I don’t think that the Mazda engineers had me in mind when they designed the Mazda Speed6. Let’s see, mom of three, living in suburbia, a stoplight every other intersection – I barely have a chance to drive at highway speeds, let alone open up the throttle on this swift sedan.\n\nSomehow, I must find a way. I drive out to some sparsely populated sections of new road near my house to really test this car. I couldn’t possibly do a review justice without really driving the car fast – or at least that is my excuse! Wow, what fun! The Mazda Speed6 comes with a six-speed manual transmission; light pressure on the accelerator makes the RPMs soar towards the redline. I have to be quick with the clutch and soon I am flying down the street. It is a thrill.\n\nThe same things that make this car fun to drive make it a little unfriendly for moms. I think the manual transmission is great fun in this car, but it is completely unpractical and distracting for my day-to-day mommy driving. How can I drink coffee, hand a water bottle to the kids in the back, and shift at the same time?\n\nI also have heartburn over the white leather seats that stylishly inhabit my test vehicle. I feel like I have to have a box of baby wipes constantly ready in case a grubby hand touches any part of the surface. Don’t even get me started on the back of the front seats, during our week-long test, my children’s feet inevitably rub, leaving dirt and marks all over the beautiful white seatback. Yikes!\n\nOther than that, this car is a gem. Booster seats fit comfortably in the back seat and the Latch anchors are easy to get to for infant seats. The Mazda Speed6 boasts a five-star safety rating and has standard side-curtain airbags. I could not even peel-out with this speed demon if I wanted to since the standard all-wheel drive keeps me grounded; it also adds peace of mind to my driving experience.\n\nHave I mentioned that my kids love this car? My 4-year-old says it is the best car we have ever had. He is eager to go to the grocery store and to pick his sister up from school. Usually, I spend several minutes persuading him to get into the car and buckle up, but not this week. He and I are both impressed with the visibility and comfort of the back seat. The standard Bose stereo also makes us smile. Even my teenager doesn’t mind listening to They Might be Giants singing “John Lee Supertaster” – loud.\n\nThe candy-apple red metallic paint job is something I would not normally write about, but girlfriends, this car has some serious bling. Everyone who sees me near this car comments on the “velocity red” paint – it is beautiful.\n\nAnother exterior feature that is very interesting is the advanced keyless entry. I keep the credit-card-sized key in my purse and press a small black button on the door when I get to the car – the doors magically unlock. I also start the engine without removing the key from my purse; a signal from the key fob allows me to just turn the starter and go. I am so thankful to be relieved of the daily key dig.\n\nAnother chick-friendly feature includes many little compartments to store all the gear that we have to have with us at all times. There is a pocket for change, another to catch your cell-phone and yet another to stash Kleenex and those wet-wipes for cleaning the white seats. Not to mention the center console that has a little trap door at the top that nicely fits my iPod. It even has hole in it to run the charger down to the outlet. I still have ample space for anti-bacterial gel, my garage door opener and some CDs for the kids. The trunk has plenty of room for a weekly grocery trip including a 40-pound bag of dog food.\n\nOverall, the features that make Mazda Speed6 “speedy” are overkill for mommy-life. That said, Mazda has been thoughtful in adding features to the car that are convenient, practical and that make the daily grind a lot more fun.\n\n*For more information on the Mazda Speed6 and its safety features visit Cars.com.\n\nLET’S TALK NUMBERS LATCH Connectors: 2 Seating Capacity (includes driver):5\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT Storage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore Cargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSENSE AND STYLE Family Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great Fun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Groove-On",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nHigh performance is no stranger to the Mazda brand, which issues the rotary-engine RX-8 sports car and has offered specially tuned editions of the MX-5 Miata roadster. For 2006, the automaker’s Mazda6 sedan got the performance treatment. Because it was just introduced, Mazda says it made no significant changes to the 2007 model.\n\nEmanating from the company’s Mazdaspeed division, the Mazdaspeed6 sedan contains a turbocharged 2.3-liter four-cylinder that operates with direct gasoline injection and whips up 274 horsepower. Mazda insists it has circumvented the usual disadvantages of turbocharging: poor low-end and mid-range torque. The single-scroll turbo delivers most of its 15-psi boost starting at approximately 2,500 rpm. The automaker says a specially tuned exhaust note is both subtle and aggressive.\n\nThe Mazdaspeed6 comes in base Sport and Grand Touring models. An Active Torque Split all-wheel-drive system adjusts front/rear torque distribution between 100/0 and 50/50 based on real-time steering angle, yaw rate, lateral G-force and engine status data. The all-wheel-drive system can choose between Normal, Sports and Snow modes. The RX-8’s torque-sensing limited-slip differential is used in the Mazdaspeed6.\n\nExterior\nAn aerodynamic front bumper and lower grille section are intended to suggest the potential of the Mazdaspeed6’s powertrain. An upper grille serves as the engine’s air intake, directing cooled air through a duct to the turbocharger’s intercooler. Side skirts are flared, and aluminum wheels hold 18-inch tires. The rear bumper contains a diffuser and integrated tailpipes, and a compact lip-style spoiler is installed.\n\nMazda says the Mazdaspeed6’s torsional rigidity is 50 percent greater than that of a regular Mazda6 sedan. The Mazdaspeed6’s front spring rate is 25 percent higher than usual, and its stabilizer bars are thicker. The rear cross-member has been reinforced.\n\nThe sedan’s dimensions are similar to the standard Mazda6 sedan. A power sunroof is optional on the Grand Touring sedan.\n\nInterior\nLike the Mazda6, up to five occupants can fit inside the Mazdaspeed6. Both Mazdaspeed6 models feature stainless-steel scuff plates, sport-type front seats, alloy pedals and a Bose audio system with an in-dash six-CD changer. Grand Touring sedans add black leather-trimmed seat upholstery, an eight-way power driver’s seat, heated mirrors and front seats, and keyless entry.\n\nUnder the Hood\nDirect gasoline injection and turbocharging combine to produce 274 hp and 280 pounds-feet of torque from the Mazdaspeed6’s 2.3-liter four-cylinder. A six-speed manual gearbox is installed.\n\nSafety\nDynamic Stability Control, antilock brakes, side-impact airbags and side curtain airbags are standard.",
