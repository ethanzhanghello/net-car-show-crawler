      "expert_review": "Break this car apart.\n\nTake today’s test car, the 2007 Mazda CX-9, and look at it from just behind the front wheel, forward to the grille. You might think it is a sleek sedan, such as an Acura TL. Examine it from the rear tire backward and you might imagine it’s a high performance SUV, such as the Porsche Cayenne. And if you focus only on the center it resembles a modern minivan, like the Dodge Grand Caravan.\n\nThe CX-9, and its smaller garage-mate, the CX-7, may be the boldest examples of the modern crossover vehicle: they carry families the way minivans can, haul gear in a safer and less costly manner than SUVs, and offer the performance and handling of a solid family sedan.\n\nOur first CX experience came in the “7” as we climbed the snaking hills of the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia. We deemed it a box of a sports car — not hulking, but nimble and quick\n\nThe CX-9 also is nimble and quick despite the added size. In fact, it is easy to forget you are at the wheel of a vehicle that will carry seven people (including adults in the third row of seats). Large back doors make access to the rear quarters easy, aided by a middle row of seats that slides comfortably forward. Somehow Mazda has managed to rake the seats backward at a comfortable angle, even while preserving decent rear cargo space. And if you don’t need the third row, it folds completely flat. If even more space is needed, the middle row folds nearly flat.\n\nHead and leg room in all three rows is generous, and all occupants are protected by standard air bags: front and front side, and curtain bags for all three rows.\n\nThe interior, with moderately bolstered front bucket seats, features a central control pod, with an optional navigation system that is intuitive and ergonomic. No squinting to read small buttons, and no pinching to twist small knobs. All the controls are handy and big, whether for climate, audio, or other functions. A gracefully sloped, two-tone, textured dash is accented at each end by faux wood trim. The same trim is reflected again as the vertical framework for the central control pod.\n\nA traction control system, antilock brakes that sense an emergency, and an anti roll system are standard, as well. These are key features to look for on a car, particularly when you are likely to be carrying your entire family.\n\nOur Grand Touring all-wheel-drive model also had such standard fare as leather-trimmed seats in the first two rows, heated front seats, power windows, fog lamps and LED tail lamps, a shift knob and steering wheel wrapped in leather, Bluetooth hands-free communication, anti theft alarm, heated power mirrors, rain-sensing wipers, three-zone automatic climate control, and an AM/FM/CD sound system with six speakers.\n\nThe CX-9 also comes in Sport and Touring models, in front- and all-wheel drive. Base prices range from about $29,000 to $34,000. All are powered by a 3.5-liter V-6 engine with 263 horsepower, which felt even more powerful once the rpms were up. The engine produces 249 lb.-ft. of torque for tugging up hills and hauling heavy loads. The transmission is a smooth six-speed automatic with a manual option that involves simply a forward-backward click selection for up and down.\n\nOn the road, the CX-9 felt more like a stable and sporty sedan than a people and cargo hauler. It wasn’t as snappy as the smaller, lighter CX-7, with its turbocharged, inline four-cylinder engine, but was ready to pass on the highway or accelerate from an entrance ramp. Another plus: it runs on 87 octane gas.\n\nThis is the largest vehicle Mazda has made, but it is more nimble than some of the company’s earlier models.\n\nRoyal Ford can be reached at ford@globe.com.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Mazda CX-9?\n\nThe Mazda CX-9 is a mid-size SUV with room for six or seven people onboard, depending on whether a second-row bench or dual captain’s chairs are ordered. Powering this three-row SUV is a 227-horsepower, turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine mated to a six-speed automatic transmission with all-wheel drive. While it’s far from being the newest face among a strong roster of rivals, the CX-9 still has much to offer compared with competitors such as the Ford Explorer, Honda Pilot,  Hyundai Palisade and Kia Telluride.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Mazda CX-9?\n\nMazda has dropped the entry-level Sport trim from the CX-9 range, making the most affordable model a CX-9 Touring that starts north of $40,000. Standard features now include dual second-row captain’s chairs, leather seats, wireless device charging and a sunroof.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Mazda CX-9 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nAll-wheel drive\nSecond-row captain’s chairs\nAutomatic LED headlights\n18-inch aluminum-alloy wheels\n4G LTE Wi-Fi hot spot (data subscription required after free trial)\nHeated front seats \nTri-zone automatic climate control\nPush-button start\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane keep assist\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nAdaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability\n\nAvailable features include: \n\n20-inch aluminum-alloy wheels\nFront and rear parking sensors\nPower liftgate\nPower moonroof\nSecond-row retractable sunshades\nHeated steering wheel\nHeated second-row seats\nBose premium stereo\nNavigation\n360-degree camera system\nShould I Buy the 2023 Mazda CX-9?\n\nIf you want a three-row SUV that’s fun to drive, the 2023 Mazda CX-9 should be at the top of your shopping list. While it’s more expensive than some rivals, the CX-9 comes standard with many comfort and safety features that are optional on competing mid-size SUVs. Its third row, however, is best left for kids, and the optional 20-inch alloy wheels add a bit too much firmness to the ride over rough pavement.",

      "expert_review": "Despite many strong suits, the Mazda CX-9 has always been a bit of an underdog in the highly competitive and crowded full-size crossover class. The CX-9 doesn’t seem to be a go-to car for shoppers in the family-hauler space, but it deserves consideration.\n\nWhile it isn’t perfect, the 2013 Mazda CX-9 has enough interior space and cargo capacity to handle most families and offers more fun behind the wheel than many of its competitors.\n\nFor a three-row crossover that can pretty comfortably handle seven passengers and a bit of cargo, it somehow manages to avoid feeling bulky or matronly — a trap that too many large and midsize SUVs fall into. The CX-9 is agile. It handles the highway with plenty of power, giddy-ups quickly, embraces curves and U-turns with ease, and generally drives like a much smaller, sportier car. My only complaint is the road noise, but I suppose as an underdog it’s working so hard to compete that its heavy breathing is understandable.\n\nThe 2013 CX-9 has a starting price of $30,580, including a $795 destination charge. My test car, a top-of-the-line CX-9 Grand Touring with all-wheel drive, had an optional Tech Package ($2,435) and cost $40,030.\n\nEXTERIOR\nWhen it comes to looks, it’s tough to stand out in the crowded family SUV/crossover marketplace. Despite its restyled looks with a new grille, angled headlights and rounded fog lights, the 2013 CX-9 blends in with the rest of the family crossovers on the road.\n\nLike all good family crossovers, it’s shaped like the progeny of a wagon and large SUV union and is manageable for most people to enter and exit. The CX-9’s doors are lightweight, which has a couple of implications. It means that children can handle the doors and that you really need to give them a mighty shove to ensure the doors have closed completely. I had to re-close the doors almost every time one of my children attempted to do it. Thankfully, a power liftgate is standard on the Grand Touring trim I tested so I didn’t have to worry about re-closing it.\n\nCargo space is minimal at 17.2 cubic feet with all three rows of seats in use. There is an under-floor storage compartment that is big enough to hold a handbag and other small valuables. The third row does fold flat with two easy steps and creates 48.3 cubic feet of cargo space. With both rows folded, the cargo area becomes a roomy 100.7 cubic feet.\n\nThe CX-9 has a standard 3.7-liter V-6 engine that delivers 273 horsepower and is matched to a six-speed automatic transmission. Front-wheel drive and all-wheel drive are offered. The all-wheel-drive model that I tested gets an EPA-estimated 16/22 mpg city/highway. The front-wheel-drive version gets 17/24 mpg city/highway. The CX-9 uses regular unleaded gasoline.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nINTERIOR\nThe CX-9 is the car in black. The cabin is dark, especially with the black leather upholstery that my test car featured. But it works for the CX-9, and aside from a couple of cheap-looking plastic areas, the overall vibe is simple and cool. If you’re not into the all-black thing, Sand-colored upholstery is available that undoubtedly lightens things up. Whatever color you choose, heated front seats are standard on both the Touring and Grand Touring trims as is a tri-zone climate control.\n\nThe center stack is defined by the new 5.8-inch touch-screen, rectangular air vents and circular climate control knobs. The screen is smaller and has a lower tech look than many other touch-screens I’ve tested lately, but it’s easily operable. With Bluetooth connectivity, the screen displays text messages and allows you to stream your music. The optional navigation system was difficult to use. I’ve no doubt that my troubles were in part user error, but when you’re operating heavy machinery like a car full of kids, figuring out how to get an in-vehicle system to do what you want it to should be easier.\n\nOne thing I’ve always liked about the CX-9 is the easy access it offers to the third row. Both sides of the 60/40-split second row recline and slide fore and aft to allow plenty of room for kids and adults alike to access the third row. The only unfortunate part of this sliding row is Mazda still hasn’t modified things so you can do all of this back-and-forth business with a child-safety seat installed a la the 2013 Nissan Pathfinder and 2013 Infiniti JX35.\n\nThe second row fits two child-safety seats across it, though it may be possible to fit three if you’re using narrower safety seats. The third row can accommodate two booster seats. When it comes to adult seating, the front seats are comfortable. It’s in the folding-chair-like third row where things can start to feel cramped and uncomfortable, but anyone can survive a short ride back there.\n\nThe CX-9 lacks clever storage options excluding the covered storage in the cargo area. The center console isn’t huge; the glove box is of average size, and the eight cupholders are just fine. In addition to a car-seat-accommodating sliding second row, I’d love to see a few more storage cubbies placed throughout the cabin.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair/Ample\n\nSAFETY\nDespite doing its best to keep up with the rest, the CX-9 needs to strive harder when it comes to safety. Many of its competitors — Chevrolet Traverse, Ford Explorer, Honda Pilot and Dodge Durango — have been named Top Safety Picks by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. The 2013 CX-9 earned the top score of Good in IIHS moderate-overlap frontal and side-impact crash tests, but it received the second-lowest score of Marginal in rear and roof-strength tests. It performs similarly in National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ratings, getting an overall safety score of four stars out of a possible five.\n\nThe CX-9 has standard front-wheel drive, four-wheel-disc antilock brakes with brake assist, an electronic stability system with anti-roll control, traction control and six airbags, including side curtains for all three rows. The upper-level Grand Touring trim I tested and the midlevel Touring trim come standard with a blind spot warning system and a backup camera with rear parking sensors. All-wheel drive is optional.\n\nI always appreciate speed-sensing automatic door locks like those on the CX-9. The only hiccup with the CX-9’s lock function is the doors don’t automatically unlock once you’ve turned off the engine. Automatic unlocking when a car is stopped has become so common that the CX-9’s lack of it was a small but frustrating experience on a daily basis.\n\nThere are two sets of lower Latch anchors in the second row’s outboard positions. The lower anchors are difficult to use because of the stiff leather upholstery. Regrettably, there are no lower Latch anchors or top tether anchors in the third row, so only boosters should be used back there.

      "expert_review": "An ingredient was missing.\n\nZoom, zoom is in Mazda’s DNA, and the CX-9 came up one zoom short when it bowed for 2007.\n\nThe 3.7-liter V-6 designed by Ford, but built by Mazda, wasn’t ready, so the crossover had to make do with the 3.5-liter V-6 designed and built by Ford.\n\nNow the 3.7-liter that unleashes 273-horsepower, not to mention 270-foot-pounds of torque, has been hitched to the CX-9 in place of the 3.5-liter and its 263-h.p. and 249-ft.lb. It’s teamed with a smooth and quiet 6-speed automatic with manual mode.\n\nZoom, zoom.\n\nSpirited motoring while able to haul seven in three seats — the Holy Grail of crossovers. Quick takeoffs with just a little exhaust rumble for the sound of performance. Cruising is whisper quiet.\n\nWhile full of energy, the 3.7 is rated at 15 m.p.g. city/21 m.p.g. highway with all-wheel-drive, 1 m.p.g. less than an AWD Buick Enclave, though what CX-9 lacks in mileage it makes up for in muscle.\n\nEnvironmentalists be warned: There’s no place to insert batteries for higher mileage.\n\nCouple changes other than the engine. A power hatch lid is now available. Press the key fob to raise the lid as you approach with arms full, or press the button in the dash if you spot a package-laden family member approaching while you stay warm inside.\n\nAnd to make the road a bit safer, there’s a blind spot monitor. When vehicles approach from behind on either side, a yellow light flashes in the sideview mirrors as a warning not to change lanes. If you use your turn signal to indicate a lane change when a vehicle is in your blind spot, the flashing light is accompanied by a series of beeps.\n\nBut the flashing yellow light is hardly an attention getter during daytime hours, and day or night, the many who don’t bother with the turn signals wouldn’t get the beep-beep-beep.\n\nAnd, if you are going 65 m.p.h. and pull into a lane in which the guy in your blind spot is going 85 m.p.h., do you have time to say oops after the beep sounds? Never mind that you belong in the far right lane if you are in the center and getting passed on left and right sides.\n\nBut we digress, even if it’s only the thought that counts when you have to spend $200 for a system that’s hardly foolproof.\n\nWe tested the top-of-the-line CX-9 Grand Touring with AWD, which is like piloting a Mazda6 sedan that stands higher off the ground and has an extra row of seats.\n\nFour-wheel independent suspension minimizes road harshness and eliminates chatter over tar marks. Though long, wide and shaped somewhat like a minivan, the CX-9 maneuvers into and out of tight places with serpent-like precision. No lean or sway. The 20-inch, low-profile radials are designed for enthusiastic driving.\n\nThe CX-9 operates in front-wheel-drive in normal conditions but engages all wheels during hard acceleration or when it detects one wheel about to slip.\n\nTo ensure optimum road manners under all conditions, stability and traction control with rollover sensing are standard. They will keep the vehicle on even keel or deploy the side-curtain bags spanning all three rows if the driver tries to defy the laws of physics.\n\nNice but not without some gripes. After roomy front- and second-row seats that are supportive and well cushioned, leg and melon room is tight in row three, where the small size of the cupholders hints at intended occupants.\n\nAlso, second-row seats slide 5 inches forward and the backs recline to create an all-too-narrow aisle to the third row.\n\nCargo room behind the third seat is skimpy. CX-9 might haul seven people, but not with their suitcases unless some are carried on laps. If driving five or fewer folks, the third row seat backs fold flat by pulling straps. Then cargo room is ample with a small compartment under the floor for hiding a few things.\n\nOne much-appreciated feature is the soothing blue mood lighting in the doors and overhead console, which also helps illuminate the cupholders at night. The blue back-lighting for the orange gauges gives them an easy-on-the-eyes lavender hue. And all control buttons, levers and dials have red lettering, also easy to see and use at night.\n\nBase price is $34,655, which includes three-zone automatic climate control; power mirrors (heated)/windows/front seats (heated); rain-sensing wipers; Bluetooth hands-free phone; AM/FM/CD player with steering-wheel controls; three, 12-volt power outlets; keyless start; tilt and telescoping steering wheel; fog lamps; and auto-on headlamps.\n\nOptions included a package that teams power moonroof with a Bose sound system for $1,760, and a GT assist package at $2,500 with voice-activated navigation system, backup camera and the power hatchlid. A dealer-installed portable DVD system will be available early next year.\n\nKicking zoom up a notch at a time of high gas prices hasn’t hurt CX-9. The test vehicle sported a window decal that read “2008 Motor Trend Sport-Utility of the Year.”\n\nAnd the CX-9 is one of three finalists for 2008 North American Truck of the Year selected by 50 automotive writers, including this scribe. It is up against the Chevy Tahoe Hybrid and the aforementioned Enclave. Winners will be announced at the Detroit Auto Show Jan. 13.\n\n– – –\n\n2008 Mazda CX-9 Grand Touring AWD\n\nFuel economy: 15 m.p.g. city/21 m.p.g. highway Price as tested: $39,785.

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in May 2010 about the 2010 Mazda CX-9. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2011, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nIf you want an SUV with seven or more seats, your options start with compact crossovers — whose optional third-row seats are best left for punishing kids — and end with full-size truck-based SUVs, whose exterior bulk and gas mileage are punishing in their own right. In between is a healthy selection of mid- and full-size crossovers that includes the 2010 Mazda CX-9.\n\nIn a crowded class, the CX-9 distinguishes itself with a high-quality interior and more driving fun than you’d expect from a large, seven-seat crossover.\n\nCompeting on the small end with the seven-seat Toyota Highlander and on the large end with the Chevrolet Traverse, the CX-9 comes in three trim levels: Sport, Touring and Grand Touring. Front- and all-wheel drive are available at all three levels.\n\nExterior & Styling\nCompared with its competitors, the CX-9 is pretty sleek-looking for a large crossover. Most crossovers are more streamlined than Ford’s boxy Flex, but even those cars have vestigial characteristics from the SUVs from which they evolved — sort of the way some people have a prominent brow ridge from Neanderthals past. (Or so it seems, depending on whom you hang out with.)\n\nFor 2010, the CX-9 has joined its happy Mazda brethren by adding a larger, smiling grille, as well as restyled headlight clusters and fog lamps. There are a few changes to match around back, but the most functional change comes in the form of larger side mirrors, which Mazda says are also more aerodynamic. Oddly, only on the Grand Touring trim level do the side mirrors have turn-signal lights. The Grand Touring has xenon headlights, chrome rather than body-colored door handles and 20- rather than 18-inch alloy wheels. Frankly, I think automakers have gone overboard with the giant wheels, though they make more sense on a vehicle this large than they do on cars. Owners might throw themselves overboard when they find out how much it costs to replace large wheels and tires, though: According to TireRack.com, the standard 20-inch tires cost $217 apiece; the 18s are $182 each. (You can get different brands for less, but this gives you an idea of the original-equipment price range.)\n\nOn the Road\nEven with its 20-inch wheels, our Grand Touring rode reasonably comfortably, but it’s a bit firmer than some. With that firmness comes pretty entertaining handling, with precise steering and a good feel to the wheel. While I’d characterize the CX-9 as one of the sportier three-row crossovers out there, don’t get the impression that it’s a sport wagon. It’s large, and opportunities to drive it in a spirited fashion seldom present themselves.\n\nThe CX-9’s acceleration truly surprises, especially in a Grand Touring weighed down with all-wheel drive and lots of features. Teamed with a six-speed automatic transmission, the 3.7-liter V-6 has plenty of power: 273 horsepower and, perhaps more important, 270 pounds-feet of torque, which gives it an urgent launch from a standing start.\n\nOn slick surfaces, I noticed some initial front-wheel slip before the traction control kicked in and the rear wheels played their part. Some all-wheel-drive systems are more seamless. In the practical sense, this quirk is of no consequence to most drivers.\n\nInterior\nFor its exterior size, the CX-9’s cabin is a bit snug. Its passenger volume is 139 cubic feet, which is smaller than the seven-seat Highlander (146 cubic feet), the Traverse (154 cubic feet), the Flex (156 cubic feet) and the Honda Pilot (154 cubic feet), the last of which is shorter from bumper to bumper than the CX-9 but wider and taller. The CX-9 just edges out a couple of other seven-seaters that are smaller on the outside: the Hyundai Veracruz (137 cubic feet) and Subaru Tribeca (133 cubic feet).\n\nWhere I feel the difference between the CX-9 and its larger competitors listed above is in the second- and third-row seats. By the numbers, the second-row seat has generous legroom, thanks in part to roughly five inches of fore/aft adjustability in the seat. In practice, I found myself sitting closer to the floor than I like, with my knees raised considerably.\n\nThe third-row seat is more typical in this regard, and its legroom measurement is average. It all depends on how far forward the second row is. Headroom, however, is limited: It’s lower than its competitors by about a half-inch to three inches, depending on which model you compare it with. At 6 feet tall, I barely fit back there even when slouching. Third rows are generally intended for kids; just be aware — if you have a large brood, a generous growth spurt could put your wayback out of commission.\n\nThe geometry of all the seats might not have worked well for me, but the front seats themselves are very comfortable — appropriately padded for short or long trips. We made a run from Chicago to Detroit with minimal fatigue. The interior quality is definitely above average in this model. You might attribute this to the high trim level we tested, but just because a vehicle has leather upholstery (as the Touring and Grand Touring do) doesn’t mean it’s high-quality. We’ve criticized the Flex Limited for exactly this problem.\n\nI wasn’t wild about our test model’s faux-wood trim, but the materials are generally high-quality. I prefer the piano-black accents that are standard on the Sport and Touring trim levels. Though we didn’t test the base trim level, Mazda says 2010 versions have new cloth upholstery. Also new are chrome accents on some of the knobs, door handles and trim. The storage console between the front seats is reasonably roomy, but I don’t like the new barn-door lid design. I suppose in theory your passenger can keep an arm rested on one side while you open the other, but in practice the raised door blocks your access, and you’ll probably end up opening both anyway. Some might find this design less cumbersome than a single, flip-back lid. Not I.\n\nSafety\nIn Insurance Institute for Highway Safety crash tests, the CX-9 earned the top score, Good, in frontal and side-impact tests. It hasn’t been tested for rear impacts or for roof strength, an indicator of rollover protection. The CX-9 isn’t alone with its good scores; the IIHS Midsize SUV class into which it falls is packed with high-scoring models.\n\nThe CX-9 has two airbags in front, and front occupants get seat-mounted side-impact airbags and active head restraints. Side curtain airbags protect all three rows of seats in a side impact and are also designed to deploy in the event of a rollover. Also standard are antilock brakes and an electronic stability system with traction control. The CX-9’s stability system is supplemented by Roll Stability Control, a feature developed by Volvo and later incorporated into then-parent-company Ford’s family of SUVs. It’s the only system that senses when a rollover has begun and employs the stability system in an attempt to forestall it. Similarly described features on other cars act only in conditions that can lead to a rollover.\n\nA blind spot warning system is standard on the Grand Touring but not offered on lower trim levels. A backup camera comes with the navigation system that’s optional on the Grand Touring. You can get a backup camera without navigation on both this model and the Touring trim, but unfortunately it’s packaged with other features.

The liftgate should raise higher to ensure noggin clearance. Also, there’s no provision to cover the gap between the folded second and third rows, as there is in some cars with sliding second rows. The greater shortcoming, though, is that the second row’s upholstery wraps over the top of the backrest and extends a quarter of the way down the back. As a result, when you fold the seat down, a segment of your cargo floor is leather rather than carpet. It’s easily damaged.\n\nAs equipped, the CX-9 can tow up to 2,000 pounds. With the Towing Prep option package, the maximum increases to 3,500 pounds, which is average. When properly equipped, the Flex can tow 4,500 pounds, and the Traverse is good for 5,200 pounds.\n\nFeatures\nStandard features not already mentioned include power windows and locks with remote keyless entry, air conditioning, cruise control and Bluetooth cell-phone connectivity. The Touring trim level adds power, heated front seats. The Grand Touring adds three-position seat memory, rain-sensing wipers, an alarm system, HomeLink, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, and keyless entry and engine start. New for 2010 is a conventional keyfob, replacing the old credit-card style transmitter, which was a neat idea that never really worked out.\n\nThe Sport offers heated, power front seats as an option. Touring options include a power liftgate and a package that includes a moonroof, Bose premium stereo with Sirius Satellite Radio, and a backup camera. The Grand Touring offers a backseat entertainment system packaged with the Bose premium stereo option.\n\nAll the CX-9’s options can be viewed here.\n\nCX-9 in the Market\nConsidering the Pilot and Highlander once had this field to themselves, the class of large three-row crossovers is one of the most competitive in the market. Those two pioneers reflect the refinement that comes from a couple of generations of steady improvement, but what’s surprising is that the more recent additions have hit the market with competitive quality and feature offerings that we never saw when automakers stumbled their way into the compact-crossover category. The Highlander, Pilot, Veracruz, CX-9, Flex and Traverse are all Cars.com Best Bets. That means you have plenty of choices, and frequent incentives and good deals await.\n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "Mazda’s largest crossover, the CX-9, is completely inoffensive, entirely functional and totally boring. It does everything it’s supposed to do: It carried the kids, stowed the cargo, provided the entertainment, but it never inspired me to love it. I really couldn’t find anything wrong with it, but at the same time, I just didn’t love it.\n\nMazda does a great job balancing the line between sporty and luxury in the 2010 CX-9, with a smooth ride that handles the speed bumps of daily life as well as the highway on-ramps. The CX-9 accelerates well enough to take on the hills of my hometown, but I wouldn’t call it “zoomy.” It’s a subtle power, the kind you don’t really have to think about. In fact, driving the CX-9 doesn’t require much thought at all. It goes. It stops. It turns. Nothing was terrific enough for me to say wow, but nothing disappointed me, either. It just kind of fades into the background. I like a car that doesn’t demand anything of me, but I’d like a more memorable ride.\n\nOne thing is for sure about the CX-9: It’s priced as a great value. Starting fat $28,805, my fully loaded all-wheel-drive test vehicle, a CX-9 Grand Touring, was $40,065. That price includes standard leather seating, an optional rear entertainment system (part of a $3,055 entertainment package), an optional navigation system ($1,665) and all-wheel drive. Sadly, though, that value doesn’t extend to the gas station. I only managed to average 14 mpg; the CX-9 gets an EPA-estimated 15/21 mpg city/highway using regular gas.\n\nEXTERIOR\n\nThe 2010 CX-9 is the sleekest three-row crossover on the road. Unless you look closely, you’d never know that this is a vehicle that comfortably seats seven people. The front of the CX-9 looks like a friendly face, with wide-set headlights and a big, smiling grille. You can’t help but smile back at the thing. The rest of the exterior is less personable but still attractive. The lines are smooth and rounded, with no sharp edges to be found. The roof slopes gently back to a snub of a spoiler and subtle touches of chrome wrap the windows and door handles, bringing a bit of sparkle to this crossover.\n\nMy favorite thing about crossovers is they manage to offer the room and function of an SUV with the moderate height of a minivan. The CX-9 sits only a bit higher off the road than a sedan, but doesn’t require the climb of a truck-based SUV. I slid right in, while my kids only had a small hop to make. The wide doors mean that it’s easy to help little ones in or pop in a child-safety seat. I’m also a big fan of the power liftgate (I support anything that enables my innate laziness). Opening the CX-9’s liftgate manually isn’t difficult, and it doesn’t go higher than I can reach comfortably, but man, pushing a button is just so much easier. And cooler.\n\nThe CX-9 comes with a 3.7-liter V-6 engine that puts out 273 horsepower. That’s respectable but not impressive. The engine, which uses regular gas, gets the job done without any of that obnoxious noise or temptation to race sports cars, a move to which I am sadly vulnerable.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Excellent\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Some\n\nINTERIOR\n\nAs much as I appreciated the CX-9’s exterior, the interior is where I found myself annoyed. Big comfy leather seats adjust every which way to cradle the driver just right, but somehow I never managed to find the sweet spot.\n\nWhen the seat was in a comfortable position and I had the tilt/telescoping steering wheel in the right place, all the dash controls were too far away to reach. The window and door controls on the driver-side door also were a stretch. They sit in a weird swoopy stripe that heads down toward the door bin. However, the center stack’s layout is easy to manage, with only the seat-heater buttons hidden behind the gearshift. There are enough bins and cubbies to contain the clutter, but the center console bin is on the small side. There are two cupholders in the front row and small bottleholders in the door pockets.\n\nIn the second row, there’s plenty of room for adults or bulky infant-safety seats. My school-age boys loved the fold-down armrest with a “hidden secret compartment” and cupholders, as well as the rear entertainment system. However, my 9-year-old was put out that he couldn’t listen to his favorite radio station, which is available through satellite radio. Sirius Satellite Radio is an option that’s part of a $2,255 package.\n\nThe CX-9’s third row is best left to people who are less than 5 feet tall. By which I mean kiddos. The seats aren’t as cushy as the other rows’ seats and legroom is tight. Even though the second row slides forward to allow easier access to the third row, it’s a bit awkward to climb back there because of the slight hop upward and the low-slanting roof. I didn’t manage it with any degree of grace or lack of grunting.\n\nThe cargo area is spacious when the third row is folded, which it does easily, as long as the second-row seats aren’t reclined too far back. When the third-row seats are up, there’s room for a few grocery bags or my kids’ massive roller baseball bags. There’s even a small under-floor storage area back there.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore\n\nSAFETY\n\nWhile the CX-9 has three rows of seats, it only has two sets of Latch anchors, which can be found in the second row. The lower Latch anchors are slightly buried under the seat cushions, but not hard to get to.\n\nThe second row’s flat seats make it easy to get a good fit with child-safety seats, and there’s plenty of room for even the largest of premium infant seats, especially since the second row slides forward and back. Unfortunately, the floppy seat belt buckles will lead to whining from little ones in booster seats, because it’s hard for kids to get a good grasp of a floppy buckle. My kids handled it just fine since they’re so big now that they don’t even need booster seats.\n\nTo keep your family safe on the road, the CX-9 comes with standard four-wheel-disc antilock brakes, stability control with Roll Stability Control, traction control and six airbags, including side-impact airbags for the front row and side curtains for all three rows of seats. All-wheel drive is optional. A backup camera is also optional.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2010 Mazda CX-9 here.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in May 2010 about the 2010 Mazda CX-9. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2012, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the three model years.\n\nIf you want an SUV with seven or more seats, your options start with compact crossovers — whose optional third-row seats are best left for punishing kids — and end with full-size truck-based SUVs, whose exterior bulk and gas mileage are punishing in their own right. In between is a healthy selection of mid- and full-size crossovers that includes the 2010 Mazda CX-9.\n\nIn a crowded class, the CX-9 distinguishes itself with a high-quality interior and more driving fun than you’d expect from a large, seven-seat crossover.\n\nCompeting on the small end with the seven-seat Toyota Highlander and on the large end with the Chevrolet Traverse, the CX-9 comes in three trim levels: Sport, Touring and Grand Touring. Front- and all-wheel drive are available at all three levels.\n\nExterior & Styling\nCompared with its competitors, the CX-9 is pretty sleek-looking for a large crossover. Most crossovers are more streamlined than Ford’s boxy Flex, but even those cars have vestigial characteristics from the SUVs from which they evolved — sort of the way some people have a prominent brow ridge from Neanderthals past. (Or so it seems, depending on whom you hang out with.)\n\nFor 2010, the CX-9 has joined its happy Mazda brethren by adding a larger, smiling grille, as well as restyled headlight clusters and fog lamps. There are a few changes to match around back, but the most functional change comes in the form of larger side mirrors, which Mazda says are also more aerodynamic. Oddly, only on the Grand Touring trim level do the side mirrors have turn-signal lights. The Grand Touring has xenon headlights, chrome rather than body-colored door handles and 20- rather than 18-inch alloy wheels. Frankly, I think automakers have gone overboard with the giant wheels, though they make more sense on a vehicle this large than they do on cars. Owners might throw themselves overboard when they find out how much it costs to replace large wheels and tires, though: According to TireRack.com, the standard 20-inch tires cost $217 apiece; the 18s are $182 each. (You can get different brands for less, but this gives you an idea of the original-equipment price range.)\n\nOn the Road\nEven with its 20-inch wheels, our Grand Touring rode reasonably comfortably, but it’s a bit firmer than some. With that firmness comes pretty entertaining handling, with precise steering and a good feel to the wheel. While I’d characterize the CX-9 as one of the sportier three-row crossovers out there, don’t get the impression that it’s a sport wagon. It’s large, and opportunities to drive it in a spirited fashion seldom present themselves.\n\nThe CX-9’s acceleration truly surprises, especially in a Grand Touring weighed down with all-wheel drive and lots of features. Teamed with a six-speed automatic transmission, the 3.7-liter V-6 has plenty of power: 273 horsepower and, perhaps more important, 270 pounds-feet of torque, which gives it an urgent launch from a standing start.\n\nOn slick surfaces, I noticed some initial front-wheel slip before the traction control kicked in and the rear wheels played their part. Some all-wheel-drive systems are more seamless. In the practical sense, this quirk is of no consequence to most drivers.\n\nInterior\nFor its exterior size, the CX-9’s cabin is a bit snug. Its passenger volume is 139 cubic feet, which is smaller than the seven-seat Highlander (146 cubic feet), the Traverse (154 cubic feet), the Flex (156 cubic feet) and the Honda Pilot (154 cubic feet), the last of which is shorter from bumper to bumper than the CX-9 but wider and taller. The CX-9 just edges out a couple of other seven-seaters that are smaller on the outside: the Hyundai Veracruz (137 cubic feet) and Subaru Tribeca (133 cubic feet).\n\nWhere I feel the difference between the CX-9 and its larger competitors listed above is in the second- and third-row seats. By the numbers, the second-row seat has generous legroom, thanks in part to roughly five inches of fore/aft adjustability in the seat. In practice, I found myself sitting closer to the floor than I like, with my knees raised considerably.\n\nThe third-row seat is more typical in this regard, and its legroom measurement is average. It all depends on how far forward the second row is. Headroom, however, is limited: It’s lower than its competitors by about a half-inch to three inches, depending on which model you compare it with. At 6 feet tall, I barely fit back there even when slouching. Third rows are generally intended for kids; just be aware — if you have a large brood, a generous growth spurt could put your wayback out of commission.\n\nThe geometry of all the seats might not have worked well for me, but the front seats themselves are very comfortable — appropriately padded for short or long trips. We made a run from Chicago to Detroit with minimal fatigue. The interior quality is definitely above average in this model. You might attribute this to the high trim level we tested, but just because a vehicle has leather upholstery (as the Touring and Grand Touring do) doesn’t mean it’s high-quality. We’ve criticized the Flex Limited for exactly this problem.\n\nI wasn’t wild about our test model’s faux-wood trim, but the materials are generally high-quality. I prefer the piano-black accents that are standard on the Sport and Touring trim levels. Though we didn’t test the base trim level, Mazda says 2010 versions have new cloth upholstery. Also new are chrome accents on some of the knobs, door handles and trim. The storage console between the front seats is reasonably roomy, but I don’t like the new barn-door lid design. I suppose in theory your passenger can keep an arm rested on one side while you open the other, but in practice the raised door blocks your access, and you’ll probably end up opening both anyway. Some might find this design less cumbersome than a single, flip-back lid. Not I.\n\nSafety\nIn Insurance Institute for Highway Safety crash tests, the CX-9 earned the top score, Good, in frontal and side-impact tests. It hasn’t been tested for rear impacts or for roof strength, an indicator of rollover protection. The CX-9 isn’t alone with its good scores; the IIHS Midsize SUV class into which it falls is packed with high-scoring models.\n\nThe CX-9 has two airbags in front, and front occupants get seat-mounted side-impact airbags and active head restraints. Side curtain airbags protect all three rows of seats in a side impact and are also designed to deploy in the event of a rollover. Also standard are antilock brakes and an electronic stability system with traction control. The CX-9’s stability system is supplemented by Roll Stability Control, a feature developed by Volvo and later incorporated into then-parent-company Ford’s family of SUVs. It’s the only system that senses when a rollover has begun and employs the stability system in an attempt to forestall it. Similarly described features on other cars act only in conditions that can lead to a rollover.\n\nA blind spot warning system is standard on the Grand Touring but not offered on lower trim levels. A backup camera comes with the navigation system that’s optional on the Grand Touring. You can get a backup camera without navigation on both this model and the Touring trim, but unfortunately it’s packaged with other features.

The liftgate should raise higher to ensure noggin clearance. Also, there’s no provision to cover the gap between the folded second and third rows, as there is in some cars with sliding second rows. The greater shortcoming, though, is that the second row’s upholstery wraps over the top of the backrest and extends a quarter of the way down the back. As a result, when you fold the seat down, a segment of your cargo floor is leather rather than carpet. It’s easily damaged.\n\nAs equipped, the CX-9 can tow up to 2,000 pounds. With the Towing Prep option package, the maximum increases to 3,500 pounds, which is average. When properly equipped, the Flex can tow 4,500 pounds, and the Traverse is good for 5,200 pounds.\n\nFeatures\nStandard features not already mentioned include power windows and locks with remote keyless entry, air conditioning, cruise control and Bluetooth cell-phone connectivity. The Touring trim level adds power, heated front seats. The Grand Touring adds three-position seat memory, rain-sensing wipers, an alarm system, HomeLink, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, and keyless entry and engine start. New for 2010 is a conventional keyfob, replacing the old credit-card style transmitter, which was a neat idea that never really worked out.\n\nThe Sport offers heated, power front seats as an option. Touring options include a power liftgate and a package that includes a moonroof, Bose premium stereo with Sirius Satellite Radio, and a backup camera. The Grand Touring offers a backseat entertainment system packaged with the Bose premium stereo option.\n\nAll the CX-9’s options can be viewed here.\n\nCX-9 in the Market\nConsidering the Pilot and Highlander once had this field to themselves, the class of large three-row crossovers is one of the most competitive in the market. Those two pioneers reflect the refinement that comes from a couple of generations of steady improvement, but what’s surprising is that the more recent additions have hit the market with competitive quality and feature offerings that we never saw when automakers stumbled their way into the compact-crossover category. The Highlander, Pilot, Veracruz, CX-9, Flex and Traverse are all Cars.com Best Bets. That means you have plenty of choices, and frequent incentives and good deals await.\n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "The 2015 Mazda CX-9 is a goodie but an oldie, and increasingly its problems — from recent crash tests to uncompetitive gas mileage — may be too much to overlook for family shoppers.\n\nIt pains me to advise against the seven-seat Mazda CX-9, which has been one of our favorite three-row body-type SUVs over the past decade. But that time frame says it all: For 2015, the CX-9 enters an ancient ninth model year in its current form.\n\nWith front- or all-wheel drive, the CX-9 comes in Sport, Touring and Grand Touring trims. Click here to compare them and here to stack up the 2015 and 2014 Mazda CX-9. Changes for the 2015 model year are minimal. We tested an AWD CX-9 Grand Touring.\n\nExterior & Styling\nA modest update two model years ago loosely aligned the CX-9 with Mazda’s Kodo design language. Mostly it looks like a plus-sized CX-5 — a profile that belies its actual dimensions, which, at more than 200 inches, eclipse the rival Ford Explorer, Toyota Highlander and Honda Pilot. Despite the bulk, the Mazda’s 37.4-foot turning circle is among the tightest in the class. Bravo.\n\nVisual differences between the three trim levels are minimal, save 20-inch alloy wheels (in place of 18s) and some lighting upgrades on Grand Touring models.\n\nHow It Drives\nMazda’s 3.7-liter V-6 has plenty of muscle, with adequate low-end torque and instant accelerator response for stout power from a standing start. Stay on the gas, however, and you’ll suffer: 2nd and 3rd gear turn on-ramps into eternal climbs, and a tall 4th gear means passing situations take a degree of patience in a place where other V-6 SUVs scoot. Once the six-speed automatic transmission upshifts, the transmission seems reticent to kick back down for power if you need it later on, preferring to let the V-6 inch the speedometer needle forward at lower engine speeds. The whole of it gives the CX-9 a plodding, heavy sensation at speed — a characteristic that the front-drive CX-9, which is 236 pounds lighter, may help.\n\nI’d like shorter gearing and a more responsive transmission, but those would theoretically come at the expense of fuel efficiency, which is already behind the pack. With all-wheel drive, the Mazda CX-9 gets just an EPA-Estimated 18 mpg combined rating (19 mpg with FWD). That’s short of the Ford (Explorer), Toyota (Highander), Chevrolet (Traverse) and Honda (Pilot) by 1 or 2 mpg — significant when you consider that 2 mpg equates to more than 10 percent.\n\nTypical of Mazda products, the CX-9s hew toward sportier, higher-effort driving. The steering wheel has less power assist than most three-row crossover SUVs, which makes driving it a relative chore in parking lots, but it rewards you with sharp turn-in precision at higher speeds.\n\nThe suspension allows a degree of body roll that keeps with other large SUVs, and it rides a touch busily on anything short of smooth pavement. It’s not objectionably firm, however, and the higher-profile 18-inch wheels on Sport and Touring models may improve on this.\n\nInterior\nMazda puts some competitors to shame with its low-gloss, attractive dashboard materials, hefty controls and generous — not just obligatory — padding at all the points your arms or elbows contact. Touring and Grand Touring models have leather upholstery that feels rich enough for a luxury car, and all three rows have deep cushions — exemplary for the third row, in particular. Tall drivers should have enough adjustment range, but many drivers will find the power window controls — which Mazda exiled in front of the door handles — a bit of a reach.\n\nThe three-seat second row has a long forward/backward adjustment range with good headroom and legroom, albeit a low seating position. Even in the farthest-forward position, passengers should find adequate legroom — good news, since that’s where they’ll need to go (or somewhere close to it) if you assign adults to the third row. Both sides of the second row tilt and slide forward for third-row access, but Mazda offers only bench seating for that second row; there are no captain’s chairs and center aisle available.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe Mazda CX-9’s standard multimedia features are generous, including a 5.8-inch touch-screen with HD radio, Bluetooth phone and audio streaming, USB/auxiliary inputs and steering-wheel audio controls. Bose premium audio and a 9-inch rear DVD entertainment system are both optional. Skip the optional TomTom-based navigation system; the small screen and slow map processing won’t do you any favors, and the system requires too many intermediary steps for basic functions like zooming in.\n\nCargo & Storage\nFor a large SUV, the Mazda CX-9 ought to have more cabin storage. From the glove compartment to the center console, covered storage is in modest supply.\n\nThe SUV’s 100.7 cubic feet of maximum cargo room puts it near the head of the pack, but getting to it is a cumbersome process. The third row takes multiple steps to fold, and it usually involves moving the second row forward — then moving it backward again so you have enough clearance to fold it down. Keep all three rows up and the CX-9 has a competitive 17.2 cubic feet behind the third row.\n\nSafety\nThe CX-9’s dismal crash tests could, and probably should, be a deal-breaker for many shoppers. The SUV earned a score of good in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s side impact and moderate-overlap frontal test, but it scored marginal in roof-strength tests and head restraint/seating tests. (IIHS rates cars poor, marginal, acceptable and good.) Worst of all, the CX-9 scored poor in IIHS’ small-overlap frontal test. Of the 10 models subjected to this test in the organization’s midsize SUVs class, two others were also rated poor. Three rated marginal, one rated acceptable and three rated good.\n\nStandard features include six airbags plus the required antilock brakes and electronic stability system. Touring and Grand Touring models have a blind spot warning system and backup camera, but a forward-collision warning system — a feature increasingly available in this class and something IIHS requires for its top safety award — is unavailable.\n\nClick here to see a full list of safety features or here to see our Car Seat Check in a 2014 CX-9.\n\nValue in Its Class\nBase price for the CX-9 starts around $31,000 for a cloth-equipped Sport model. Mazda CX-9 Touring trims (around $33,500) add power front seats and heated leather seats, while the Grand Touring (around $36,000) adds a memory driver’s seat, a power liftgate, keyless access with push-button start, and more. All-wheel drive runs a reasonable $1,590 on any trim. Add the handful of available factory options and an AWD CX-9 Grand Touring tops out around $41,000 — an affordable ceiling, as this class goes.\n\nAffordable top trims, strong cabin quality and a recent history of high reliability will attract some shoppers to the CX-9, but safety is a must for any three-row SUV. The class as a whole had mixed results from IIHS, but none scored as poorly across multiple tests as Mazda. Combine that with the Mazda CX-9’s subpar fuel economy and it’s high time for a redesign.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "Mazda’s CX-9 crossover utility is still basking in the glow of being chosen as the 2008 North American Truck of the Year.\n\nWhile the CX-9 is classified as a truck, it has the ride and handling of a tall sedan, and the Grand Touring model feels like a luxury car inside.\n\nThe CX-9 is available in front-wheel or all-wheel drive. Prices start at $29,820 for a front-wheel-drive Sport, and $35,205 for an all-wheel-drive Grand Touring, which is the vehicle I drove.\n\nThe CX-9’s chassis is derived from that of the Mazda 6, and the basic architecture and many components are shared with the Edge and MKX. The CX-9’s wheelbase is 2 inches longer than the Ford Edge’s.\n\nCrossover vehicles such as the CX-9 are gaining in popularity because they are lighter and more fuel-efficient than truck-based SUVs, yet they are capable of carrying up to seven people. In many ways, the CX-9 is as functional as a minivan, yet it has sharper styling.\n\nThe 3.7-liter engine delivers 273 horsepower. While it is only slightly larger than the 3.5-liter engine that was used in the 2007 model, the extra size makes a notable difference. The larger engine’s additional 21 pound-feet of torque gives the CX-9 sharper throttle response and quicker acceleration.\n\nThe 2009 retains the same six-speed, sport-shift automatic transmission, front and rear stabilizer bars for flatter cornering, ventilated disc brakes and seven-passenger seating with head-protection airbags for all three rows of seats.\n\nThe Grand Touring model has a blind-spot monitoring system that lights a small icon in the outside rearview mirror when a vehicle is alongside. This feature is extremely handy and one that any driver will appreciate.\n\nThe sharp nose, sloping windshield and tapered roofline contribute to a wedge-shaped profile that looks honed by the wind. The rear fenders are flared to accommodate the large tires. The Grand Touring model comes with 20-inch wheels.\n\nThe CX-9’s interior is as nice as a luxury sedan’s. Carefully executed styling details are evident throughout the vehicle. The taillights are trimmed with chrome, the rear hatch is convex, and the interior of the test car was a nice combination of wood-grain trim and satin-finished accents.\n\nThe Mazda’s door panels have curved ribs that mimic those of the center stack, and power window switches are mounted on the ribs.\n\nThe instrument panel is cool at night. The main gauges have red numbers highlighted by a ring of blue light. Blue LEDs light the door handles and cast a soft glow on the center console.\n\nThe CX-9 has a large, wide cabin. The vehicle felt slightly ponderous for the first few blocks, but the longer I drove it, the smaller it felt. It was composed and quiet at highway speeds.\n\nThe front seats were nicely contoured and very comfortable. The second-row seat slides forward for easy access to the third seat. Sliding the second-row seat forward increases third-seat legroom.\n\nThe center console has a power outlet and a jack for an MP3 player.\n\nThe rear cargo area is substantial with the rear seat folded down. The top-hinged rear tailgate was relatively heavy to close.\n\nPrice\n\nThe base price of the test vehicle was $35,205. Options included a power sunroof, Bose stereo with six-disc CD player, blind spot monitoring system and navigation system with backup camera. The sticker price was $40,135.\n\nWarranty\n\nThree years or 36,000 miles with a five-year, 60,000-mile powertrain warranty.\n\n2009 Mazda CX-9 Grand Touring\n\nEngine: 3.7-liter, 273-hp V-6\n\nTransmission: Automatic\n\nAll-wheel drive\n\nWheelbase: 113.2 inches\n\nCurb weight: 4,312 lbs.\n\nBase price: $35,205\n\nAs driven: $40,135\n\nMPG rating: 15 city, 21 hwy.\n\nTo get in touch with Tom Strongman, send e-mail to tstrongman@kc.rr.com.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2016 Mazda CX-9 is one of the best-driving SUVs I’ve ever experienced. Families are likely to also appreciate the improved interior and added features, like rear USB ports, but a cumbersome multimedia system threatens to end all the fun.\n\nVersus the competition: The CX-9 offers solid value and a better driving experience than the competition, but it lacks optional captain’s chairs.\n\nMazda’s largest vehicle, the redesigned seven-seat CX-9 midsize SUV, gets huge changes for 2016.\n\nThis is a redesign where nobody will have trouble telling the difference between generations. The updated CX-9 has sharper styling, better cabin materials and much-improved gas mileage. The CX-9 is now available in four trim levels: Sport, Touring, Grand Touring and the all-new Signature trim that now tops the lineup.\n\nCompare the 2016 with last year’s model here and with some key competitors — the Honda Pilot, Ford Explorer and Toyota Highlander — here.\n\nThe previous generation of the CX-9 was my favorite SUV in this class to drive, but it was missing some crucial safety features and was behind in the technology department. I tested a Signature version of the CX-9 to see if its technology and family-friendliness have caught up to the rest of the class.\nExterior & Styling\nThe CX-9 is Mazda’s final model to get the Kodo design language, which translates well to this larger application. It’s the most aggressively styled midsize SUV, with a sharp, angular front grille and a sleek roofline that make it stand out.\n\nEighteen-inch alloy wheels are standard on Sport and Touring models, while 20-inch alloys are standard on the Grand Touring and Signature. LED headlights and taillights are standard on all models. A power liftgate is standard on Touring trims and higher, while the Grand Touring and Signature both feature a standard adaptive front lighting system and LED fog lights.\nHow It Drives\nOn the road is where the CX-9 truly excels. The 2016 has improved on the impressive previous generation; it’s one of my favorite SUVs to drive of any size, with superb handling and driving dynamics for a larger vehicle. It lost weight in the redesign, as well, which pays dividends in terms of handling and fuel economy.\n\nThe CX-9 ditched its old V-6 in favor of a new, turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine. It makes 310 pounds-feet of torque and 250 horsepower with 93-octane gasoline, but the power number drops to 227 hp on regular 87-octane gas. A six-speed automatic is the only transmission. Signature models come with standard all-wheel drive, but all other trims have front-wheel drive standard or all-wheel drive as an $1,800 option.\n\nThe risk of putting a four-cylinder (even a turbocharged one) into a car of this size is that it will feel underpowered, but the engine matches the CX-9 well. It’s easy to access power when it’s needed for passing (or for fun), and the transmission is adept at finding the right gear.\n\nBoth handling and ride in the CX-9 are excellent. Even on twisty mountain roads with quick direction changes, the CX-9 never missed a step, and the steering always had the appropriate weight and feedback. It’s hard to describe the sensation, but it’s one that’s unique to Mazda. Its cars drive with an attention to detail that’s missing from other automakers.\n\nThe move to a smaller engine, along with a weight reduction, means the 2016 CX-9 takes a big leap forward in fuel economy. EPA estimates are 22/28/25 mpg (city/highway/combined) for the front-wheel-drive CX-9 and 21/27/23 mpg with all-wheel drive. Those numbers represent 32 and 28 percent increases, respectively, in combined mpg over the old version.\nInterior\nThe new CX-9’s interior is almost unrecognizable compared with the previous generation. Materials, fit and finish have taken a leap, and the front seats especially are comfortable for long stints. The Signature comes with Nappa leather upholstery and real wood interior trim that give the cabin a classy, expensive feel.\n\nVisibility is also good. Mazda said it lengthened the CX-9’s hood so the driver can see it from the seat, which makes it slightly easier to park head-in. The CX-9 has a high belt line and low roof, which made me worry the cabin might feel slightly claustrophobic, but that wasn’t the case in either the first or second row. Mazda also added an additional 53 pounds of sound insulation to the CX-9, along with a thicker floor pan, which keep the interior quiet even at highway speeds.\n\nAlthough the first two rows have plenty of room, the third row is pretty tight for adults. It will do in a pinch and fits children fine, but there isn’t much legroom to speak of, and the floor is high, so your knees sit up near your chest.\n\nThe CX-9 is also missing some of the interior flexibility its competitors have. A three-passenger bench is the only available second-row seat, while other models in this class offer optional captain’s chairs with a center pass-through. However, the Mazda does have a new feature that will be helpful for families with children in child-safety seats: With a forward-facing safety seat installed on the passenger side of the second row, that seat can still tilt and slide forward to offer third-row access — no need to take the safety seat out to get in the back.\n\nThree-zone automatic climate control comes standard, with separate controls for second-row passengers mounted to the back of the center storage bin. Touring models add an auto-dimming rearview mirror, leather upholstery, and powered and heated front seats. The Grand Touring adds a Bose audio system, navigation and side-window sunshades for the second row.\nErgonomics & Electronics\nAlthough the CX-9’s interior quality has improved vastly its electronics have not — in spite of a newer infotainment system than the previous generation had, called Mazda Connect. The system is found in the latest generation of Mazdas and is standard on all CX-9 trim levels. Inputs can be entered via the standard 7-inch touch-screen or via a knob between the front seats. Touring and higher trims all get a larger 8-inch screen standard.\n\nMazda Connect is designed to be controlled with the knob. The system does not accept touch-screen inputs while the vehicle is in motion, in order to reduce driver distraction. That’s a good thing, because the screen’s position high atop the dashboard makes it hard to reach from either seat. But the system as a whole is\n\nnot intuitive, requiring too many button pushes for simple tasks, like changing the radio station. Given more time with the system, I’d likely learn to navigate the menus more efficiently, but it would remain cumbersome to use. These shortcomings could be mitigated by the presence of smartphone mirroring technology, like Android Auto or Apple CarPlay, but neither is present. Mazda has not indicated that the system could be upgraded with either at a later date.\n\nIt’s worth nothing that, within its class, the CX-9 is not alone in having a subpar multimedia experience. Both the Honda Pilot (no volume knob) and Toyota Highlander (strange menus, too many buttons) have their quirks. And the Ford Explorer with MyFord Touch has a weirdly placed touch-screen with a strange lip that makes the bottom third of it difficult to use.\n\nSomething I did like on the tech front in the CX-9: charging ports galore. Two USB ports up front and two 12-volt outlets are standard. Touring and higher models add another pair of USB ports in the second row’s flip-down center armrest. These ports charge at 2.1 amps (double the power of those up front), giving them enough juice to keep larger devices, like tablets, charged up.\nCargo & Storage\nCargo volume has dropped for 2016, down to 14.4 cubic feet behind the third row from 17.2 cubic feet last year. Maximum cargo volume is 71.3 cubic feet with both the second and third rows folded, which can happen with relative ease, though no power-folding option is available for either row.\n\nThe CX-9’s cargo volume behind the third row is competitive with the Honda Pilot (16.0) and Toyota Highlander (13.8) but lags behind the Explorer (21.0). The Mazda’s maximum cargo volume does not compare well, however, trailing each of these competitors by about 10 cubic feet.\nSafety\nAs of publication, the 2016 CX-9 had not been crash-tested. Once results are available, they will appear here.\n\nThe 2015 CX-9’s safety features lagged behind the field, but the redesign remedies this by adding a standard backup camera and many optional driving aids and safety technologies.\n\nTouring models feature a standard blind spot warning system with rear cross-traffic alert and a forward collision warning system with automatic emergency braking is optional. Grand Touring and Signature models get both these technologies standard, then pile on almost every newly available safety feature, as well. This includes lane departure warning and prevention, adaptive cruise control, rear parking sensors, automatic high beams and a new head-up display.\n\nThe new display shows more details on the windshield than before, including adaptive cruise control information, collision warnings, direction arrows when routing to a destination, and a tachometer (because it’s Mazda). My favorite addition to the display, though, is blind spot warning icons, which supplement the indicator lights that appear on either mirror. One drawback shared with most head-up displays, though, is that if you’re wearing polarized sunglasses, the display can’t really be seen. In some cases, it vanishes entirely, regardless of the brightness setting.\n\nAlso noteworthy are two systems Mazda has added that make the CX-9 easier to pilot: lane keep assist and adaptive cruise control. Lane keep assist will gently nudge you back into your lane if the vehicle drifts. Both it and the adaptive cruise control feel much more natural than the very abrupt systems found in some other vehicles — a welcome change.\n\nClick here to see a full list of safety features.\nValue in Its Class\nThe CX-9 starts at $32,420 (including a $900 destination charge) for a base Sport trim. The Touring jumps up to $36,870, while the Grand Touring — which includes lots of safety equipment — is $41,070. The Signature model I tested is a one-box model: It comes with everything Mazda offers on the CX-9 and is priced at $44,915.\n\nThe CX-9’s starting price is just above its competition; the Pilot starts at $31,045, the Explorer at $31,995 and the Highlander at $31,390. Pricing at the top end is in a similar range, with the exception of the Explorer, which shoots all the way up to $53,915. But the Explorer does offer a few things the CX-9 does not, including captain’s chairs, massaging front seats, a panoramic moonroof and Ford’s 3.5-liter EcoBoost V-6, which is a fantastic engine. In fact, both the Pilot and Highlander offer captain’s chairs and rear entertainment systems, as well, which are missing on the Mazda.\n\nThe 2016 CX-9, however, is the best of the bunch to drive; I’d rather spend a day behind the wheel of the Mazda than any of the others by a good margin. Its fit and finish put it on par with the top of the segment, especially in Signature form. But it is missing a few of the seating options and creature comforts found in its competitors, and its multimedia system is not very intuitive. If those factors are most important to you, you may need to look elsewhere.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in July 2016 about the 2016 Mazda CX-9, but little has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new with the 2017 CX-9, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years. \n\nMazda’s largest vehicle, the redesigned seven-seat CX-9 midsize SUV, gets huge changes for 2016.\n\nThis is a redesign where nobody will have trouble telling the difference between generations. The updated CX-9 has sharper styling, better cabin materials and much-improved gas mileage. The CX-9 is now available in four trim levels: Sport, Touring, Grand Touring and the all-new Signature trim that now tops the lineup.\n\nCompare the 2016 with last year’s model here and with some key competitors — the Honda Pilot, Ford Explorer and Toyota Highlander — here.\n\nThe previous generation of the CX-9 was my favorite SUV in this class to drive, but it was missing some crucial safety features and was behind in the technology department. I tested a Signature version of the CX-9 to see if its technology and family-friendliness have caught up to the rest of the class.\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nThe CX-9 is Mazda’s final model to get the Kodo design language, which translates well to this larger application. It’s the most aggressively styled midsize SUV, with a sharp, angular front grille and a sleek roofline that make it stand out.\n\nEighteen-inch alloy wheels are standard on Sport and Touring models, while 20-inch alloys are standard on the Grand Touring and Signature. LED headlights and taillights are standard on all models. A power liftgate is standard on Touring trims and higher, while the Grand Touring and Signature both feature a standard adaptive front lighting system and LED fog lights.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nOn the road is where the CX-9 truly excels. The 2016 has improved on the impressive previous generation; it’s one of my favorite SUVs to drive of any size, with superb handling and driving dynamics for a larger vehicle. It lost weight in the redesign, as well, which pays dividends in terms of handling and fuel economy.\n\nThe CX-9 ditched its old V-6 in favor of a new, turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine. It makes 310 pounds-feet of torque and 250 horsepower with 93-octane gasoline, but the power number drops to 227 hp on regular 87-octane gas. A six-speed automatic is the only transmission. Signature models come with standard all-wheel drive, but all other trims have front-wheel drive standard or all-wheel drive as an $1,800 option.\n\nThe risk of putting a four-cylinder (even a turbocharged one) into a car of this size is that it will feel underpowered, but the engine matches the CX-9 well. It’s easy to access power when it’s needed for passing (or for fun), and the transmission is adept at finding the right gear.\n\nBoth handling and ride in the CX-9 are excellent. Even on twisty mountain roads with quick direction changes, the CX-9 never missed a step, and the steering always had the appropriate weight and feedback. It’s hard to describe the sensation, but it’s one that’s unique to Mazda. Its cars drive with an attention to detail that’s missing from other automakers.\n\nThe move to a smaller engine, along with a weight reduction, means the 2016 CX-9 takes a big leap forward in fuel economy. EPA estimates are 22/28/25 mpg (city/highway/combined) for the front-wheel-drive CX-9 and 21/27/23 mpg with all-wheel drive. Those numbers represent 32 and 28 percent increases, respectively, in combined mpg over the old version.\n\nInterior\n\nThe new CX-9’s interior is almost unrecognizable compared with the previous generation. Materials, fit and finish have taken a leap, and the front seats especially are comfortable for long stints. The Signature comes with Nappa leather upholstery and real wood interior trim that give the cabin a classy, expensive feel.\n\nVisibility is also good. Mazda said it lengthened the CX-9’s hood so the driver can see it from the seat, which makes it slightly easier to park head-in. The CX-9 has a high belt line and low roof, which made me worry the cabin might feel slightly claustrophobic, but that wasn’t the case in either the first or second row. Mazda also added an additional 53 pounds of sound insulation to the CX-9, along with a thicker floor pan, which keep the interior quiet even at highway speeds.\n\nAlthough the first two rows have plenty of room, the third row is pretty tight for adults. It will do in a pinch and fits children fine, but there isn’t much legroom to speak of, and the floor is high, so your knees sit up near your chest.\n\nThe CX-9 is also missing some of the interior flexibility its competitors have. A three-passenger bench is the only available second-row seat, while other models in this class offer optional captain’s chairs with a center pass-through. However, the Mazda does have a new feature that will be helpful for families with children in child-safety seats: With a forward-facing safety seat installed on the passenger side of the second row, that seat can still tilt and slide forward to offer third-row access — no need to take the safety seat out to get in the back.\n\nThree-zone automatic climate control comes standard, with separate controls for second-row passengers mounted to the back of the center storage bin. Touring models add an auto-dimming rearview mirror, leather upholstery, and powered and heated front seats. The Grand Touring adds a Bose audio system, navigation and side-window sunshades for the second row.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nAlthough the CX-9’s interior quality has improved vastly its electronics have not — in spite of a newer infotainment system than the previous generation had, called Mazda Connect. The system is found in the latest generation of Mazdas and is standard on all CX-9 trim levels. Inputs can be entered via the standard 7-inch touch-screen or via a knob between the front seats. Touring and higher trims all get a larger 8-inch screen standard.\n\nMazda Connect is designed to be controlled with the knob. The system does not accept touch-screen inputs while the vehicle is in motion, in order to reduce driver distraction. That’s a good thing, because the screen’s position high atop the dashboard makes it hard to reach from either seat. But the system as a whole is not intuitive, requiring too many button pushes for simple tasks, like changing the radio station. Given more time with the system, I’d likely learn to navigate the menus more efficiently, but it would remain cumbersome to use. These shortcomings could be mitigated by the presence of smartphone mirroring technology, like Android Auto or Apple CarPlay, but neither is present. Mazda has not indicated that the system could be upgraded with either at a later date.\n\nIt’s worth nothing that, within its class, the CX-9 is not alone in having a subpar multimedia experience. Both the Honda Pilot (no volume knob) and Toyota Highlander (strange menus, too many buttons) have their quirks. And the Ford Explorer with MyFord Touch has a weirdly placed touch-screen with a strange lip that makes the bottom third of it difficult to use.\n\nSomething I did like on the tech front in the CX-9: charging ports galore. Two USB ports up front and two 12-volt outlets are standard. Touring and higher models add another pair of USB ports in the second row’s flip-down center armrest. These ports charge at 2.1 amps (double the power of those up front), giving them enough juice to keep larger devices, like tablets, charged up.\n\nCargo & Storage\n\nCargo volume has dropped for 2016, down to 14.4 cubic feet behind the third row from 17.2 cubic feet last year. Maximum cargo volume is 71.3 cubic feet with both the second and third rows folded, which can happen with relative ease, though no power-folding option is available for either row.\n\nThe CX-9’s cargo volume behind the third row is competitive with the Honda Pilot (16.0) and Toyota Highlander (13.8) but lags behind the Explorer (21.0). The Mazda’s maximum cargo volume does not compare well, however, trailing each of these competitors by about 10 cubic feet.\n\nSafety\n\nAs of publication, the 2016 CX-9 had not been crash-tested. Once results are available, they will appear here.\n\nThe 2015 CX-9’s safety features lagged behind the field, but the redesign remedies this by adding a standard backup camera and many optional driving aids and safety technologies.\n\nTouring models feature a standard blind spot warning system with rear cross-traffic alert and a forward collision warning system with automatic emergency braking is optional. Grand Touring and Signature models get both these technologies standard, then pile on almost every newly available safety feature, as well. This includes lane departure warning and prevention, adaptive cruise control, rear parking sensors, automatic high beams and a new head-up display.\n\nThe new display shows more details on the windshield than before, including adaptive cruise control information, collision warnings, direction arrows when routing to a destination, and a tachometer (because it’s Mazda). My favorite addition to the display, though, is blind spot warning icons, which supplement the indicator lights that appear on either mirror. One drawback shared with most head-up displays, though, is that if you’re wearing polarized sunglasses, the display can’t really be seen. In some cases, it vanishes entirely, regardless of the brightness setting.\n\nAlso noteworthy are two systems Mazda has added that make the CX-9 easier to pilot: lane keep assist and adaptive cruise control. Lane keep assist will gently nudge you back into your lane if the vehicle drifts. Both it and the adaptive cruise control feel much more natural than the very abrupt systems found in some other vehicles — a welcome change.\n\nClick here to see a full list of safety features.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nThe CX-9 starts at $32,420 (including a $900 destination charge) for a base Sport trim. The Touring jumps up to $36,870, while the Grand Touring — which includes lots of safety equipment — is $41,070. The Signature model I tested is a one-box model: It comes with everything Mazda offers on the CX-9 and is priced at $44,915.\n\nThe CX-9’s starting price is just above its competition; the Pilot starts at $31,045, the Explorer at $31,995 and the Highlander at $31,390. Pricing at the top end is in a similar range, with the exception of the Explorer, which shoots all the way up to $53,915. But the Explorer does offer a few things the CX-9 does not, including captain’s chairs, massaging front seats, a panoramic moonroof and Ford’s 3.5-liter EcoBoost V-6, which is a fantastic engine. In fact, both the Pilot and Highlander offer captain’s chairs and rear entertainment systems, as well, which are missing on the Mazda.\n\nThe 2016 CX-9, however, is the best of the bunch to drive; I’d rather spend a day behind the wheel of the Mazda than any of the others by a good margin. Its fit and finish put it on par with the top of the segment, especially in Signature form. But it is missing a few of the seating options and creature comforts found in its competitors, and its multimedia system is not very intuitive. If those factors are most important to you, you may need to look elsewhere.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: A strong dose of sportiness — and luxury in the highest trim level — elevates the 2019 Mazda CX-9’s driving experience, but the trade-off is less cargo space and third-row passenger room than most competitors.\n\nVersus the competition: The CX-9’s buttoned-down handling and responsive, turbocharged drivetrain are strengths that contribute to one of the best driving experiences in the three-row SUV class, but competitors like the Honda Pilot, Volkswagen Atlas and brand-new Kia Telluride (see their specs compared) have roomier interiors that are better for families with kids (and all the stuff that goes with them).\n\nThe CX-9 was last redesigned for the 2016 model year. For 2019, Touring and higher trim levels gain Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity; the rest of the changes are listed here. We tested a top-of-the-line Signature trim with all-wheel drive. Its only option was $300 Machine Gray paint, which brought its as-tested price to $46,710, including a $1,045 destination charge.\n\nDrives Like a Mazda\n\nYou can usually count on Mazda to deliver driving performance a cut above the class norm, and the CX-9 is no exception. It’s easily the best-driving three-row SUV from a non-luxury brand.\n\nThe biggest thing that separates the CX-9 from its competitors is ride and handling. Taut suspension tuning results in well-controlled body motions that give the SUV a planted feel in corners. Most three-row SUVs make their considerable bulk known when you toss them into corners, but the CX-9 willingly plays along when you have the urge to drive it like the Miata you owned before you had kids. The ride got a bit bumpy on rough roads, but our tester came with large 20-inch wheels and low-profile tires, a combination that tends to degrade ride comfort. The SUV’s standard 18-inch alloy wheels with taller-sidewall tires likely improves the ride.\n\nThe CX-9 is one of a handful of three-row SUVs, like the Atlas and Subaru Ascent, powered by a standard turbocharged four-cylinder engine. The CX-9’s turbo 2.5-liter four-cylinder pairs with a six-speed automatic transmission, and the powertrain has been tuned for driving enjoyment; gas pedal and transmission response are good, and the engine’s low-end torque — 310 pounds-feet available at 2,000 rpm — is there when you need high-speed passing power. The CX-9 includes a Sport mode that heightens drivetrain response by holding lower gears longer before upshifting and increasing gas pedal sensitivity.\n\nThe one area where the CX-9’s driving experience falters is its steering; while steering precision is fine, the wheel has a numb feel.\n\nPremium Cabin Quality*\n\nThe other thing that distinguishes the CX-9 from the competition is its upscale cabin materials and finishes, which are as nice as what you’ll find in some luxury SUVs. However, this observation comes with an important asterisk: It’s true on the Signature trim level only.\n\nIt’s not uncommon to see differences in cabin quality between base and top-of-the-line trim levels, but the gap is wider than normal in the CX-9. Things the Signature trim gets that lower trims don’t include Nappa leather upholstery, Rosewood trim and additional LED accent lighting. Those extra luxury touches don’t come cheap: The all-wheel-drive-only Signature costs $2,725 more than a Grand Touring AWD model.\n\nBesides being finished in upscale leather, the front bucket seats in Grand Touring and higher trim levels are heated and ventilated, and the second-row outboard seats are heated. Comfort is good in both rows; the front buckets are supportive, and the second row has good legroom for adults when the seat is in its rearmost position. The second-row bench seat also reclines (second-row captain’s chairs aren’t offered).\n\nIt’s a good thing the second-row bench slides forward and backward, because third-row passengers are going to be hollerin’ for more legroom — there’s very little to spare with the second row slid all the way back. Second-row passengers won’t be able to help with third-row headroom, however, which is severely restricted by the CX-9’s sloping roofline. Outward visibility back there is also limited due to small rear-quarter windows, resulting in a third row that some might find claustrophobic. Unlike the third-row seats in the Atlas and Chevrolet Traverse, the CX-9’s isn’t made to carry adults.\n\nTech Hits and Misses\n\nOur test vehicle was packed with tech features, some better executed than others. One that’s done well is the available head-up display, which includes speed limit info as well as graphical indicators for the available lane departure and standard blind spot warning systems. However, the blind spot warning indicators are harder to see at a glance than the ones Kia and Genesis incorporate into their HUDs.\n\nThere’s also an available 360-degree camera system that gives a bird’s-eye view of your surroundings as well as forward and rear views. The extra visibility is welcome, but the system’s pixelated front and rear image quality is disappointing considering other models’ crisp, HD-quality images.\n\nThe standard Mazda Connect multimedia system includes a 7-inch touchscreen and a console knob controller. Touring and higher trims get an 8-inch touchscreen in addition to CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity. The knob controller is intended to be the main interface, as touchscreen functionality is disabled when the CX-9 is in motion.\n\nThis screen lockout makes using the CX-9’s newly available smartphone connectivity more difficult than it needs to be. CarPlay’s familiar icon-based interface appeared on the dashboard touchscreen when my iPhone was connected to the CX-9, and it responds to touches and swipes — when you’re stationary. When you’re moving, you must use the knob controller to navigate the system, which isn’t ideal for a touchscreen-optimized interface like CarPlay. The knob controller is relatively easy to use, but Mazda’s decision to disable the touchscreen is frustrating.\n\nGrand Touring and higher trims have a 7-inch instrument panel screen in the center of the instrument panel, but it doesn’t add much. The screen’s speedometer, for one, is just a digital representation of a traditional analog speedometer. Mazda didn’t take advantage of the design freedom a screen affords. However, I do like how Mazda has integrated a following-distance indicator in the center of the screen to alert you when you’re too close to the car ahead of you. The warning is also shown in the head-up display.\n\nCargo\n\nThe CX-9 has one of the smallest cargo areas among three-row SUVs, with 14.4 cubic feet of cargo room behind the third row and a maximum of 71.2 cubic feet with the second and third rows folded. Useful features include third-row head restraints that automatically lower when folding the seat and a shallow hidden storage bin under the cargo floor.\n\nSafety\n\nThe CX-9 received the highest score in all Insurance Institute for Highway Safety crash tests, as well as IIHS’ highest rating for front crash prevention (when equipped with the optional Smart Brake Support automatic emergency braking). The Touring trim had the best-performing headlights in IIHS tests, with an Acceptable rating; the base Sport model’s headlights were rated Marginal, while the high-end Grand Touring and Signature’s lights were deemed Poor.\n\nOther available active-safety features include lane keep assist and adaptive cruise control that works down to a stop.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nWe last compared the CX-9 against the three-row SUV competition in 2016, when the current generation of the SUV was brand new. It finished fourth in a field of eight SUVs and was just as much of an outlier then as it is today, with its focus on driving performance and style at the expense of passenger and cargo room. The field has only gotten stronger with the arrival of models such as the Atlas and Telluride — both of which are worth a test drive — but if you can live with the CX-9’s shortcomings, there’s nothing else in the class that drives like it.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Mazda CX-9?\n\nThe Mazda CX-9 is an SUV with room for up to seven people in three rows. It’s powered by a 227-horsepower, turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine that pairs with a six-speed automatic transmission. Front- and all-wheel-drive models are available. Competitors include the Honda Pilot, Nissan Pathfinder and Toyota Highlander.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Mazda CX-9?\n\nNew standard active safety features include adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability, forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning and lane-keeping assist. Other new standard features include heated front cloth seats, a power-adjustable driver’s seat, rain-sensing windshield wipers, heated side mirrors and automatic headlights with high-beam control.\n\nNew available features include second-row captain’s chairs, a hands-free power liftgate and a 9-inch multimedia screen. The SUV’s turbocharged four-cylinder engine is now rated at 320 pounds-feet of torque — 10 pounds-feet more than before — when running on 93-octane gasoline. A new off-road traction assist feature for all-wheel-drive versions uses the brakes to slow slipping wheels and send power to the wheels that have grip.\n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Mazda CX-9 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include three-zone automatic air conditioning, cruise control, a 7-inch touchscreen multimedia system, and LED headlights and taillights. The Touring trim level adds Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity, along with leather-trimmed seats, a power liftgate and a 9-inch multimedia screen. Available features include a power moonroof, Bose premium stereo, a 360-degree camera system, ventilated front seats, a heated steering wheel, and front and rear parking sensors.\n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Mazda CX-9?\n\nIn keeping with Mazda’s image of fun-to-drive performance, the CX-9’s driving experience is considerably more engaging than the three-row SUV norm. Handling is excellent, and the turbo four-cylinder engine is strong. The interior is also classy. Downsides include a base multimedia system that can be hard to use, and less cabin space than its main competitors, particularly in the third row.",

      "expert_review": "Most significant changes: New mid-level Carbon Edition trim; 10.25-inch infotainment screen standard on all models; higher trims get additional safety tech\n\nPrice change: $70 increase for CX-9 Sport; $40 increase for CX-9 Touring; $390 increase for CX-9 Grand Touring and Signature\n\nOn sale: Late August\n\nWhich should you buy, 2020 or 2021? It depends. The 2021 CX-9 offers additional model diversity and safety features for a modest price increase, but it wasn’t immediately clear if the multimedia system lost the outgoing CX-9’s touchscreen functionality.\n\nMazda is updating its CX-9 flagship three-row SUV for the 2021 model year, adding a standard 10.25-inch dashboard display to all models, additional safety tech to higher trims and creating a new Carbon Edition that lets buyers purchase what Mazda considers a more visually exciting CX-9.\n\nRelated: Mazda CX-5, CX-9 and Mazda6 Get Carbon Editions for 2021\n\nIt wasn’t immediately clear if the 10.25-inch display still works as a touchscreen, a functionality eschewed in favor of Mazda’s arm-level controller on cars like the CX-30 and Mazda3. The outgoing CX-9 offered 7- or 9-inch displays with touchscreen functionality when the car was stopped. Asked to clarify the 2021 CX-9’s interface, a Mazda spokesperson did not immediately respond.\n\nThe new Carbon Edition comes with gray exterior paint and red leather upholstery, along with a gloss-black grille and mirrors, and trim-specific 20-inch wheels. It doesn’t, however, change the CX-9’s performance, as it remains powered by the same 2.5-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine that produces 250 horsepower and 320 pounds-feet of torque — but only on premium gas. Use regular and those numbers drop to 227 hp and 310 pounds-feet.\n\nCarbon Edition models and above also add low-speed rear automatic emergency braking and a driver attention alert system to the standard i-Activsense suite of safety features, and the Grand Touring and Signature models also add a 360-degree camera system.\n\nPrice\n\nThe base front-wheel-drive Sport now starts at $35,060, up $70 for 2021. Upgrading to a 2021 FWD CX-9 Touring will cost $36,850, an additional $40 over a comparable 2020 model, and a Touring-specific Premium Package adds an extra $2,060. The new Carbon Edition sits in the middle of the range at $42,180 for a FWD example. A FWD CX-9 Grand Touring costs $43,040 for 2021, while the top-of-the-line CX-9 Signature with standard all-wheel drive costs $47,705 — both $390 increases over 2020 models. (All prices include an unchanged destination fee of $1,100.) Adding AWD to every 2021 CX-9 but the Signature adds $1,900 to the price, as it did for the 2020 model year.\n\nLower trim levels of the 2021 CX-9 might cost a slight premium versus competitors like the Honda Pilot, Hyundai Palisade and Kia Telluride, but both the Palisade and Pilot can surpass higher trim levels of the CX-9, and the 2021 Pilot can even surpass $50,000. The touchscreen remains a question mark, but with modest price increases in exchange for a better interior and safety tech, the 2021 Mazda CX-9 is an otherwise solid choice over a comparable 2020 CX-9.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
