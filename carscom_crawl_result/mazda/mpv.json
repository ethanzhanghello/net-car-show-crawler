      "expert_review": "Our two-week stint in the 2002 Mazda MPV minivan reminded us of one of the summer’s blockbuster movies: Attack of the Clones.\n\nThis short-wheelbase people mover from Ford’s Japanese affiliate is no mold-breaker. It borrows styling inspiration and steals bits and pieces of hardware from benchmark models — for instance, the tumbling third-row seat from the Honda Odyssey and power sliding side doors from Chrysler minivans.\n\nAnd yet Mazda proves it’s good at aggregation with the latest MPV, which has been modestly restyled and given more power for 2002. Our test vehicle, a well-equipped ES edition, was priced at $28,637 — for some buyers, a great value.\n\nHe: We’re used to talking with parents of young kids about minivans. Heck, we’ve owned three or four of them, including the original rear-wheel-drive MPV, when our boys were grade-school age. So I was kind of surprised to come out of church last Sunday and get stopped by an older couple in a Chrysler minivan who wanted to know more about the Mazda. They were especially impressed that for less than $30,000, you can get leather seats and all those amenities in the MPV, which is about the same size as a short-wheelbase Dodge Caravan or Pontiac Montana.\n\nShe: I love the 2002 MPV. It seems much more sophisticated and it’s still a terrific workhorse. We went from a dressy dinner with friends on Thursday to the local nursery on Saturday, where we loaded up eight flats of flowers and four bags of bark and peat, with room to spare. We also happened to have a new Chevrolet TrailBlazer EXT in our driveway last week, and I preferred the MPV. The visibility was better. The seats were easier to reconfigure. The third row folded flat into the floor. And it was easier to park. Maybe owning a minivan is not as much of a status symbol as owning an SUV. But it’s a lot more comfortable and just as functional, with seven-passenger seating. And, in this case, considerably cheaper.\n\nHe: Mazda continues to upgrade and improve the MPV with each generation. The latest iteration gets a larger engine displacing 3.0-liter and delivering 200 horsepower. It’s pretty peppy and, with the new five-speed automatic transmission, returns some impressive fuel-economy numbers — 18 miles per gallon in the city and 24 on the highway. The power seems adequate, although it can’t compare with the 240-hp 3.5-liter V-6 in the Odyssey.\n\nShe: Parents will be happy that Mazda improved its rear-seat entertainment system. Remember, the old one had the VCR located awkwardly in the floor. The new $1,200 DVD system is all one piece, and comes with MP3 and CD players, two wireless Headphones, a seven-inch overhead screen and a remote control. That’s a great option and an absolute necessity for some families who wouldn’t even consider doing a longer trip without a bunch of movies to keep the kids happy. One clever feature Mazda skipped is the power tailgate option offered on the Chrysler minivans. In other words, the MP V won’t be all things to all people. But it comes pretty close.\n\nHe: I also liked some of the other friendly features, including the little fold-up table between the front seats and the roll-down glass in the side doors. I was disappointed that the middle seats didn’t tumble forward to create more cargo space, although you can slide them from side to side and pop each one out. Also, the shorter wheelbase means there isn’t as much rear cargo space as you’d get in an Odyssey or a Ford Windstar, although the MPV is easier to maneuver than those big boys.\n\nShe: Don’t expect the Mazda to deviate much from the classic minivan silhouette, even though the MPV was modestly redesigned. They tweaked the taillights, changed the front end a bit and made 17-inch alloy wheels standard on the ES model. I really liked the color combination on our test minivan — a shimmering sand metallic exterior paired with a beige interior. I was a little disappointed to find a roof rack cost extra — in s case $200 more. Our test vehicle also had a $425 four-seasons package that included a rear heater, heavy-duty battery and heated outside mirrors.\n\nHe: The 2002 MPV is not the ultimate minivan — that accolade still goes to the Honda Odyssey. But it’s a really nice package for those who don’t need the extra cargo space and prefer the greater maneuverability of the short wheelbase.\n\nAnita’s rating:(Above average)\n\nPaul’s rating: (Above average)\n\nLikes: A near-luxury vehicle with loads of features for under $30,000, including power sliding side doors and leather upholstery. Just the right size for smaller families or older couples with no kids. Larger engine with more power than predecessor. ES comes with terrific standard safety features, including ABS, traction control, side air bags. Side door glass rolls down.\n\nDislikes: Engine is still smaller, less powerful than several minivan rivals. Sliding side doors don’t open far enough. No power liftgate. No outside-temperature gauge. Middle seats don’t tumble forward. No rear-seat DVD entertainment system.\n\nType: Front-engine, front-wheel drive, 7-passenger minivan.\n\nPrice: Base, $27,192; as tested, $28,637 (inc. $520 destination charge).\n\nEngine: 3.0-liter V-6; 200-hp; 200 lb-ft torque.\n\nEPA fuel economy: 18 mpg city/24 mpg highway.\n\n12-month insurance cost, estimated by AAA Michigan: $1,267 (Rates may be higher or lower, depending on coverage and driving record.)\n\nWhere built: Japan",

      "expert_review": "It’s a purely subjective matter, but I find the exterior styling of the new Mazda MPV rather disappointing. From a distance, only a 13-year-old kid could tell it from the rest of the herd, even though, on close study, it has some interesting styling quirks, like the bulging hood line.\n\nSuch was not the case with the preceding generation; like it or not, the big box was distinctive. I suppose Mazda would argue that it has enough attractive features so that the shell doesn’t really matter that much. That’s true, but it pays to advertise. Oh, well . . . The biggest brag about the MPV (multipurpose vehicle) is that it’s the least expensive import minivan available. (Take that, Honda, with your still-hard-to-get Odyssey.)\n\nOffered in three series, the MPV begins at $19,995 for a DX. That machine has the same engine as the others, plus an automatic transmission, air conditioning, power steering and brakes, a four-speaker AM-FM-CD audio system, tilt wheel, roll-down windows in the dual sliding rear doors and even an air filtration system. On its face, that’s a great value for a nominally seven-passenger hauler.\n\nAt the LX level (starting at $22,040), you get all that plus antilock brakes, power front and rear windows and door locks, heated power outside mirrors, privacy glass, cruise control, second-row fore/aft seat adjustments and an adjustable driver’s seat cushion.\n\nThe ES (starting at $25,550) adds leather seating surfaces, leather-wrapped steering wheel, quasi-wood trim, rear air conditioning, side air bags for driver and co-pilot, nine-speaker sound system, remote keyless entry, 16-inch aluminum alloy wheels and an antitheft system.\n\nThat all sounds pretty swell, but there are a few options packages you might consider, too, like a power moonroof (relatively bargain-priced at $700) and a “4-seasons package,” which, for $400, gets you a heavy-duty battery, larger window washer reservoir, heavy-duty rear defogger, larger radiator and an auxiliary cooling fan, and an automatic transmission cooler. Considering how hard a van sometimes works, those are desirable add-ons.\n\nI’d also be inclined to get one of the packages (available only on LX machines) that bring upsized alloy wheels to the party. The standard 15-inchers (steel) are a little less tire than I like to see on a vehicle that goes close to 3,700 pounds unladen.\n\nUnlike its ancestor, the new MPV is front-wheel drive, and unfortunately, there’s no four-wheel-drive version – yet. There is no figure given for towing capacity, nor is there even a towing package listed among the options.\n\nThis is likely because the only power source for the several series is a diminutive new double-overhead-cam engine. A V-6 with 24 valves, it displaces just 2.5 liters, just like the similar ones Mazda and Ford use under the name Duratec in some of their mid-sized cars.\n\nIt makes 170 hp at a thrilling 6,250 rpm; torque max is 165 foot-pounds at 4,250 rpm. If you were taking notes when I mentioned curb weight, you will correctly deduce that performance is rather torporous and somewhat strained. Even with just little ole me on board, 0-60 times were barely inside 11 seconds. And unlike the silken Duratecs I’ve tried, this powerplant sounded thrashy and nasty, especially as the revs rose, as they often were called upon to do. They should at least provide better firewall acoustical insulation.\n\nActually, a few extra pounds of insulation would be well spent because both tire and suspension noise come through too obtrusively at freeway speeds, despite the rather high wind noise.\n\nThe four-speed automatic overdrive transmission shifted smoothly and quickly, and I was pleased to see Mazda has dumped the “hold” button on the end of the column-mounted shifter in favor of a more-common “overdrive off” switch.\n\nThe new platform feels much more rigid than its predecessor, as indeed it is The MPV seemed more e a casting than an assemblage of pieces, even as it was subjected to some rude roads by an unsympathetic driver.\n\nAlas, the chassis rigidity just emphasizes the loose fit of some components like seats and doors – in the sample I had, showing just a few thousand miles on the odometer, thumping and rattling was unacceptably prevalent. This is a fairly common failing on first-year minivans, the effect aggravated no doubt by the large resonant cabin in which the noises gambol.\n\nOverall ride quality was not harsh, but decidedly firm, which is probably a good thing considering that some buyers might actually try to cram in six passengers. Handling was predictable and reasonable for a minivan. The 215/60/16 tires helped, although they did snivel a bit when thrown hard into turns.\n\nThe MPV is set up as a three-row carrier, 2-2-3, and, given its tidy overall length (187 inches, 14 inches less than prime competitor the Honda Odyssey, and about the same as Chrysler’s standard-wheelbase boxes), you’d do well to restrict gangly adolescents and above to the first two classes.\n\nThe MPV is replete with clever, why-did-it-take-so-long innovations, one of which is the arrangement of the second row of seats. The starboard perch, configured as a captain’s chair, can slide left and right as well as fore and aft. Both seats can be removed for cargo hauling.\n\nThe third-row bench, taking a very popular page from the Odyssey book, can be folded down flat beneath the load floor, or flipped 180 degrees to provide rear-facing “tailgate” seating. I shudder to think that someone may not understand this is for static use only. With all seats in place, the MPV has room for 17 cubic feet of gear, about what you get in a large car. Tuck the third seat away, and that zooms to 54 cubic feet. Remove the second row and you have 127 cubic feet. The new MPV has dual sliding doors, nicely integrated into the body even when they’re sliding. They moved easily on level ground and wouldn’t be too much of a challenge for the frail even on a slope. Instead of the all-too-common fixed glass, these doors have windows that actually go down, power driven on the two upper series, manual on DX.\n\nInterior styling is fresh and sensible, with controls easy to see and use, although by daylight, the liquid crystal displays used for the radio and gear selection indicator are next to useless. The main instruments are somewhat compact, but legible, with white lettering on a black background with red needles. Materials are pleasant to look at and touch, and appeared durable.\n\nThe dipsomaniacal will be glad to hear there are 10 cupholders in this conveyance, along with nine storage compartments, including a large glovebox and center console.\n\nBeing an ES, my tester had the premium 9-speaker sound system with AM-FM radio, cassette and CD player. It also had the pricey but handy six-CD changer built into the dash. Overall sound quality was exce llent, crisp and clear, powerful if somewhat lacking in ambience.\n\nThe MPV has ventilated discs brakes in front, drums in rear. LX and ES series get antilock, which is not even optionally available on DXs. They felt rather soft and vague, but stopped the machine in a reasonable distance.\n\nEPA ratings for the MPV are 18 city, 23 highway. I measured 19.5 on regular unleaded, with an equal mix of freeway cruising and about-town motoring. I had the engine working rather hard, trying to eke the last quantum of energy out of it. I would hope that next season Mazda will perhaps make available a 3.0- or 3.8-liter from its owner Ford’s parts bin.\n\nBase price on the MPV ES is $25,550. With the CD changer ($600), power moonroof ($700) and four-seasons package, plus freight, the tester stickered at $27,730.\n\n“The Gannett News Service”",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nRedesigned for 2000, Mazdas front-drive minivan gains a few equipment items for 2001. Mazda offered a previous MPV with rear-wheel drive in the 1990s, but the current front-drive edition is considerably different. Three versions are offered: the base DX, midrange LX and top-of-the-line ES. Sales more than doubled during 2001, but the MPV still ranks among the moderately popular minivans.\n\nThe LX model gains remote keyless entry for 2001, as well as a three-in-one audio system that includes cassette and CD players. All models add child-safety seat tether anchors.\n\nExterior\nMazdas minivan is smaller than those of most rivals  comparable to a regular-length Chevrolet Venture  partly because its sold globally. The wheelbase is 111.8 inches, and the MPV measures 187 inches long overall. A sporty GFX appearance package that includes aero body components, spoilers and fog lights is available for the LX and ES.\n\nInterior\nSeating for seven is standard. Second-row bucket seats may be slid together to form a two-passenger bench or removed from the vehicle altogether. A tumble-under three-person bench in the third row folds right into the floor when its not needed, or it can be flipped rearward to serve as a tailgate seat for picnics and outdoor events.\n\nLeather upholstery is standard in the ES and unavailable in the other models. Extra features in the LX include power windows and locks, heated power mirrors, privacy glass and antilock brakes. The ES version has leather seating surfaces, premium nine-speaker audio, an ignition-immobilizing system, 16-inch alloy wheels and seat-mounted side-impact airbags.\n\nUnder the Hood\nAll MPV models come with a 2.5-liter dual overhead cam V-6 engine with 170 horsepower and a four-speed-automatic transmission. The engine stems from a design by Ford, which is Mazdas parent company.\n\n\n \n\n\n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2001 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "All Dolled Up, but Still a Minivan\nBy Warren Brown\n\nMazda introduced its MPV family vehicle in 1988 in a bid to have it taken seriously as a minivan.\n\nThat was four years after Chrysler Corp. created the minivan market in the United States with the introduction of its Caravan and Voyager models.\n\nMinivans were popular then. Sport-utility vehicles were few. Station wagons seemed nonexistent.\n\nBut popularity often is a predecessor to contempt; and in due time, minivans became contemptible to many auto buyers for reasons having nothing to do with their intrinsic value.\n\nSUVs eventually supplanted the tubular vans as favored family haulers; but SUVs also became successful enough to engender public enmity. Station wagons, at least as a vehicle category, died in the energy crises of the 1970s and never quite rose from that grave.\n\nThus, the term “station wagon” joined the list of opprobrious automotive nomenclature along with “SUV” and “minivan.”\n\nBut although fashions change, basic transportation needs seldom do. People still have families. Families still consist of children and adults. Children and adults still have a need to transport themselves and their things, often in large numbers.\n\nThe tested 2004 Mazda MPV does all of those things quite well. But competence is no guarantor of sales. Favorable public perception is needed for retail glory. That is why Mazda is begging consumers to think of its new MPV as anything but a minivan, SUV or ordinary station wagon.\n\n“The Mazda MPV would be more accurately called a large sport wagon with seating for seven than a run-of-the-mill, grocery-carting minivan,” the company says in its MPV press materials.\n\nMazda has a point, at least in contending that its new MPV is not “run-of-the-mill.”\n\nWith its restyled headlights, new hood, more muscular front fenders and new, more aggressive-looking grille, the 2004 Mazda MPV looks less like a minivan than previous models do. Other cosmetic surgery, including new bumpers and backlights, give the MPV’s rear end a tight, sporty look. Myriad interior changes — including new fabrics, new headrests, a more ergonomically designed instrument panel and the addition of a standard rear air conditioner — also support the illusion that the new MPV is something more glamorous than a minivan.\n\nBut illusion is illusion, even when it comes with sporty 17-inch wheels (on the tested MPV ES), or attractive 16-inch wheels on the LX model.\n\nBeneath all of that puffery is a healthy helping of traditional minivan practicality including multiple cup holders and storage spaces, manual folding bench third-row seats, power sliding side doors granting easy mid- and rear-cabin access for children and grandparents, and that good ol’, telltale minivan rear hatch.\n\nAnd if “sporty” implies brisk speed and crisp handling, well then, it remains a b it of a stretch to apply the term to the MPV ES.\n\nThat is not to say that the MPV ES is a slug. The front-wheel-drive vehicle’s 200-horsepower, V-6 engine is more than competent for highway travel, especially in the flatlands. But in the highlands that engine develops a bit of a whine relieved only by dropping its five-speed, overdrive automatic transmission into third or second gear.\n\nHandling is also good. There was little difficulty turning the MPV ES around in tight spots in the Allegheny Mountains. But its wide body rendered it kite-like in high winds, thereby requiring a bit of a struggle at the steering wheel to keep it on the straight and narrow.\n\nVerdict: The 2004 MPV ES is a minivan. As presently constructed, even with all of its changes, it will remain a minivan. If that bothers you, buy something else that isn’t.\n\nNuts & Bolts\n\nDownside: Minor, arguable picks, really. Like, I wish the MPV ES had a 250-horsepower engine to help move its considerable weight of 3,812 pounds.\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: Good in all three categories. There is nothing special here, but what exists is certainly more than adequate for sensible drivers.\n\nHead-turning quotient: It is a minivan. It attracted attention only from people in other minivans.\n\nBody style, layout: Front-engine, front-wheel-drive, four side doors with rear hatch.\n\nCapacities: The MPV ES has seating for seven people. Maximum cargo capacity is 128 cubic feet. It can be equipped to tow up to 3,000 pounds. Fuel capacity is 19.8 gallons of gasoline. Regular unleaded is okay.\n\nEngine/transmission: The MPV ES is equipped with a 3-liter, V-6 engine that develops 200 horsepower at 6,200 revolutions per minute and 200 foot-pounds of torque at 3,000 rpm. The engine is linked to a five-speed automatic transmission.\n\nMileage: I averaged 22 miles per gallon in mostly highway travel.\n\nSafety: Side bags, traction control, four-wheel anti-lock brakes.\n\nPrice: Base price is $28,230. Dealer invoice price on base model is $26,080. Price as tested is $29,230, including $1,000 in options and a $520 destination charge.\n\nPurse-strings note: A good van, competitively priced, surrounded by competition including the Toyota Sienna, Ford Freestar, Honda Odyssey, Nissan Quest, Chrysler Town & Country.",

      "expert_review": "When it comes to describing the MPV, Mazda spares no hyperbole in boasting that it “has the body of a minivan, the soul of a sports car.”\n\nSure, and after dropping the rugrats off at the field, soccer moms bond by spending the day autocrossing in their MPVs.\n\nWhile it’s a bit of an exaggeration to say the MPV has been blessed with the soul of a sports car, have to admit it isn’t your ho-hum minivan.\n\nWe tested the ’03 MPV ES. The thing has some guts, thanks to replacing the 2.5-liter, 170-horsepower V-6 that had been in it with the 3-liter, 200-h.p. V-6 from Ford Motor Co., which owns 33 percent of the Japanese automaker.\n\nKick the pedal and the V-6 responds with energy. No hesitation, no dawdling at the light. And it’s quiet. Often minivan cabins serve as tunnels that allow noise to filter fore and aft. The MPV isn’t a victim of that racket. You don’t spend your travel time with the folks in back asking the folks in front, “what did you say?”\n\nIn addition to lively performance, the V-6 delivers 18 m.p.g. city/25 m.p.g. highway mileage.\n\nUnlike most minivans, the suspension has been engineered to resist body roll in cornering and lean during sharp turns, like those sport coupes with souls. Solid little machine.\n\nAnd a switch from 15-inch to 16-inch all-season radials as standard on the base LX and from 16 to 17 inches on the top-of-the-line ES has had the desired effect of offering car-like handling in a tall, slab-sided family hauler.\n\nHmm. Maybe soccer moms do autocross in their spare time?\n\nBut despite its quickness, quiet and above-average road manners, the MPV is a van, and as such, attention must be paid to getting the family and their junk into and out of it.\n\nMPV does that well with seating for seven (two-two-three) with a choice of two different ways to reach the third row seat thanks to what Mazda calls its side-by-slide second row seating system. The second row has two bucket seats. You can slide the passenger side bucket against the driver side bucket to form a single bench seat that allows access to the third row via an aisle at the passenger side door. Or you can slide the passenger side bucket toward the door to create an aisle between the two bucket seats to access the third row seat. However, the second-row bucket seats come with armrests that, when down, hinder passage to that third row.\n\nOnce you reach the third-row bench seat, you’re treated to surprisingly ample head, leg and arm room. MPV’s third row will carry adults and isn’t limited, like many rivals, to holding small kids.\n\nIf you don’t need the seat for people but could use more cargo space, the third-row bench folds flat into the floor. And you thought only the Honda Odyssey’s third seat did that.\n\nOne other benefit for third-row occupants for ’03: You can opt for a DVD entertainment system with a 7-inch-wide fold-down viewing screen. You also get h eadphones so the kids won’t disturb Dad or autocrossing Mom upfront.\n\nMPV offers manual slide-open doors on driver and passenger side, but for $800 you can relax and push the button on the key fob and enjoy power slide-open doors on each side. Dual power doors, by the way, are a new option on the LX.\n\nAnother nice feature of the ES is the flip-up table top between driver/passenger seats with cup and coin holders.\n\nA gripe, however, is that there’s no all-wheel-drive model for all-season security in the family hauler. The front-wheel-drive MPV, however, does offer anti-lock brakes as standard and traction control as a $400 option in the LX or ES.\n\nHowever, to get the $400 traction control in the LX, you also have to purchase rear-seat air conditioning at $595.\n\nWhat air conditioning has to do with traction control, we don’t know, other than it brings $595 into the till that might not have got there without it. For shame!\n\nBase price of the ES is $26,090. Standard equipment includes power windows, power door locks and power mirrors, cruise control, remote keyless entry, carpeted mats, rear-window wiper/washer and tinted glass.\n\nThe test vehicle came with the DVD system as well as a dash-mounted six-disc CD player at $450; power moonroof at $700; Four Season package with rear heater, heavy-duty battery, power heated mirrors and larger windshield washer tank and radiator at $425; security package with alarm, fog lamps, auto dimming mirror with temp/compass readings at $730; and front and rear spoilers and side door sill extensions at $345.\n\nOddly, Mazda insists one reason for MPV’s success has been its size and the fact it is offered in one version, not regular and extended length.\n\n“The MPV is smaller than either a Toyota Sienna or the most popular version of the Dodge, the Grand Caravan,” said Mazda spokesman Jeremy Barnes.\n\nThe MPV is built on a 111.8-inch wheelbase and is 187.8 inches long overall. By comparison, Sienna is built on a 114.2-inch wheelbase and is 194.1 inches long, and the Dodge Grand Caravan is built on a 119.3-inch wheelbase and is 200.5 inches long.\n\nAmple room in an economy-size package that’s not only easy to maneuver, but in ES form, a pleasure to maneuver.\n\n“Consumers tell us they appreciate the smaller size because it makes it easier to drive as well as garage,” Barnes said, failing to note that the smaller size also would make it easier to autocross.\n\nAn oversight, don’t you think?",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nOne of the smallest minivans on the market, the front-wheel-drive Mazda MPV features roll-down windows in its sliding doors. Minor revisions, including a newly standard retractable key, took place for 2005. Rear air conditioning became optional in the LX and standard in the ES.\n\nExcept for body color choices, nothing has changed for the 2006 model year. Interior and exterior styling was revised for the 2004 model year. The headlights, grille, hood, bumpers and side skirts were new. All four captain’s chairs got new ergonomically shaped headrests, the driver’s seat gained lumbar support, sun-visor extensions were installed, “smart” front airbags were added, and the ES got a six-CD changer.\n\nThe MPV’s five-speed-automatic transmission incorporates Slope Control, which stays in fourth gear to avoid unnecessary shifts while climbing. Mazda claims the MPV weighs less than its competitors and that its “trimmer exterior” yields more responsive handling and easier parking. Analysts have noted that the MPV’s smaller-than-normal dimensions may account for its modest popularity.\n\nExterior\nMazda’s minivan is significantly shorter than most minivan competitors. Riding a 111.8-inch wheelbase, it stretches to 189.5 inches long overall, which is roughly the same length as a regular-size Dodge Caravan. A power moonroof is optional.\n\nSeventeen-inch alloy wheels go on the ES model, while the LX gets standard 16-inch wheels. The performance-oriented suspension is supposed to reduce body lean without negatively affecting ride comfort.\n\nInterior\nThe MPV provides seating for up to seven occupants, with captain’s chairs in the front and middle rows. The second row’s “Side-by-Slide” bucket seats not only slide fore and aft but also together, to create the equivalent of a bench. The “Tumble Under” third-row seat folds completely into the floor. Maximum cargo volume is 17.2 cubic feet behind the third-row seat or 54.6 cubic feet with the third-row seat folded down.\n\nDual sliding side doors are standard, and power operation is optional. The windows in both sliding doors can be lowered — a feature not available in many minivans.\n\nStandard equipment includes front air conditioning, remote keyless entry, cruise control and a CD player. The ES adds rear air conditioning, leather-trimmed seats and an eight-way power driver’s seat. Backseat DVD video entertainment is optional.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe MPV’s 200-horsepower, 3.0-liter V-6 teams with a five-speed-automatic transmission.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes with electronic brake-force distribution are standard. Side-impact airbags and traction control are standard in the ES. The front seat belts include pretensioners.\n\nDriving Impressions\nCompactness isn’t necessarily a drawback on the road; agile handling is the MPV’s foremost virtue. In fact, this minivan whips through curves almost like a capable sedan, and it remains impressively flat. Top-notch steering response is precise and confident. Ride comfort is especially good and exceptionally well controlled. Mazda’s minivan does slow down appreciably on steep upgrades, but engine noise is modest. The automatic transmission tries hard and reacts promptly. More oomph is evident on gradual inclines, but the MPV doesn’t feel power-packed.\n\nThough the MPV is quiet overall, you can hear road noise and some engine growl when it’s pushed hard. Wind noise can also get bothersome. The seats feature comfortable cushioning and good support.",

      "expert_review": "Cashing in on the current sport-utility craze, Mazda is marketing its All-Sport MPV as a sport-utility van, available with four-wheel drive and decorated with rugged exterior features.\n\nThe front-engine, rear-drive All-Sport sits tall and looks rugged. Be sure to specify the 4WD package for all-weather traction and the ability to do some modest off-roading. That is the model I drove, and I found it to be stable and secure in pouring rain.\n\nAside from four-wheel-drive, the All-Sport package is mostly cosmetic, consisting of a grille guard, roof rack, fender flares, polished wheels and a rear bumper guard. Leather upholstery, dual airbags, anti-lock brakes and a whole host of convenience equipment completes the offering. It is standard on the four-wheel-drive (4WD) and the two-wheel-drive ES.\n\nThe MPV’s short overall length and maneuverability makes it appealing to active folks for camping, biking and such like, but don’t expect it to clamber around the outback like an SUV because the four-wheel-drive system doesn’t have a transfer case that would give it an extra-low gear. It does, however, have a locking differential for extra traction when the going gets really nasty.\n\nRear-wheel drive makes it excellent for towing. Equipped with the Load Leveling Package, the two-wheel-drive can tow 4,500 pounds (4,200 pounds for 4WD).\n\nThe MPV’s 3.0-liter V6 engine is a single-overhead-cam unit with three valves per cylinder. It has 155 horsepower, but the mid-range power is a bit soft and it requires a deliberate kick-down of the transmission when climbing steep hills or passing slower traffic.\n\nThe shift lever for the automatic transmission is mounted on the steering column, and it contains buttons for shifting out of overdrive and engaging four-wheel drive. The lack of a floor console opens up front legroom and gives space for items between the front seats.\n\nFour-door minivans are the rage today, and the Mazda is so equipped. The rear doors open out 90 degrees which facillitates getting into the back seat.\n\nGetting to the third seat is a different story. It requires climbing behind the second row of captain’s chairs, an exercise best left to agile youngsters, which is how the third seat of most minivans is generally used. Legroom in the third seat is also minimal.\n\nThe MPV’s 110.4-inch wheelbase and 183.5-inch overall length is shorter than the standard Dodge Caravan. Consequently, there is not much luggage space behind the third seat. The third seat folds forward to create a load space, or it can be removed completely. Access is simplified by a large tailgate hinged at the top.\n\nUp front, the bucket seats are wide and accommodating. The cabin of our test unit was as cozy as a passenger car, and just as well equipped. Getting in and out takes a bit of a step, but no more so than most SUVs.\n\nErgonomically, the dashboard is showing its age. Instruments are simple and clear, but the sliding-bar heater controls and buttons for rear wiper and differential lock are all fairly far from the driver. I noted the lack of a central button for unlocking the doors.\n\nPrice\n\nThe base price of our test car was $28,895, and that included power windows, power locks, air conditioning, AM/FM stereo cassette, power steering, cruise control, tilt wheel and power mirrors.\n\nThe only options were rear air conditioning, floor mats and keyless entry system. The sticker price was $30,770.\n\nWarranty\n\nThe standard warranty is for three years or 50,000 miles.\n\nVehicles for The Star’s week-long test drives are supplied by the auto manufacturers.\n\nPoint: The MPV All-Sport offers four doors, four-wheel-drive and a rugged look intended for people with active lifestyles.\n\nCounterpoint: The small overall size limits the effectiveness of its cargo-carrying, and ergonomically it could use some updating.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\n\nENGINE: 3.0-l er, V6\n\nTRANSMISSION: automatic\n\nWHEELBASE: 110.4 inches\n\nCURB WEIGHT: 4,105 lbs.\n\nBASE PRICE: $28,895\n\nPRICE AS DRIVEN: $30,770\n\nMPG RATING: 15 city, 19 hwy.",

      "expert_review": "Imagine you’re a product planner for Mazda. For years, you’ve been tryingto peddle the MPV and have met with limited success. Meanwhile, you don’t havea sport utility to sell, even as that type of vehicle takes off in sales.\n\nWhat to do?\n\nIf you said rework the MPV and make it a sport utility van, a hybrid of thetwo, you might have a career as an automotive product planner.\n\nThe MPV gets a restyled front end this year, and it’s distinctively Mazdain flavor. The swing-out doors continue, and this year a left-side passengerdoor is added.\n\nThe rear-wheel drive MPV is about the length of a compact car. But it’sclose to 72 inches tall, almost an inch higher than last year, the result of areworked suspension and the availability of a four-wheel drive option. Thatoption comes with a center differential activated at the touch of a button.\n\nMotivation is provided by the same engine as last year, a 3.0-liter V-6with 18 valves that produces 155 horsepower and 169 pound-feet of torque.Hooked to a four-speed electronically controlled automatic transmission, thispower plant provides adequate acceleration. It roars with authority, butthere’s little extra power on tap for when you overload the van with people,stuff or both — something you’re bound to do eventually.\n\nThe suspension (independent up front, live axle in the rear) is a crossbetween a minivan and a sport utility. There’s enough body lean throughcorners to prevent sport driving. It provides for a comfortably firm ride, butthe driver seems to be far above the road, a feeling accentuated by thesuspension. The standard four-wheel disc brakes with anti-lock provided goodstopping ability.\n\nInside, there’s a redesigned dash with dual airbags. Chair-height bucketseats give decent support, although those with longer legs might wish for moreseat travel. Interior seating combinations can accommodate up to eightpassengers, although the third row is higher than the others. The center seatflips forward, creating a table with cup holders for the third row.\n\nThe climate control, audio system and necessary cup holders reside in thecenter of the dash and are easy to understand and operate.\n\nIf you’re having trouble deciding between a minivan and a sport utility,Mazda has come up with a compromise. To lovers of one vehicle type or theother, it ultimately might be unsatisfying. The changes Mazda added for ’96 dobring it up to date, offering a somewhat different flavor against the samenessof the minivan segment.\n\nBut as a future product planner, you knew that.\n\nMazda MPV LXStandard: 3.0-liter V-6 engine, four-speed automatic transmission, dualairbags, four-wheel drive, four-wheel power disc brakes with anti-lock,power-assisted steering, power mirrors, power windows, power door locks,cruise control, tilt wheel, AM/FM cassette stereo, variable intermittentwipers, rear window wiper-washer-defroster, remote fuel door release,P215/70R15 tire s with alloy wheels, full-size spare tire, eight-passengerseating with velour upholstery, under-seat storage tray, dual vanity mirrors.Optional: Quad captains chairs, LX preferred equipment group(air-conditioning, keyless entry, floor mats, privacy glass), automaticload-leveling, transmission oil cooler.Base price: $26,255.As tested: $27,425.EPA rating: 15 mpg city, 19 mpg highway.Warranty: 36-month/50,000-mile bumper-to-bumper with 24-hour roadsideassistance.",
