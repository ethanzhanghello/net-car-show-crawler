The answer’s beneath the sheet metal, as the six-person Mazda5 rides on a compact car platform, specifically the one used by the nimble Mazda3, and it’s smaller than traditional minivans.\n\nThe benefits of this approach — sporty handling, minimal body roll and manageable dimensions — are readily apparent after only a short time behind the wheel. There are also, however, some significant drawbacks.\n\n \n\nExterior & Styling\nIf it weren’t for its sliding rear doors, the Mazda 5 model would undoubtedly be considered a hatchback rather than a minivan. Mazda says sliding rear doors offer easier access to the second- and third-row seats, and are easy to open in tight parking spaces (not to mention less likely to ding other cars when they’re thrown open by exuberant kids on a trip to the mall).\n\nThough it retains the basic shape of a large minivan, the Mazda5 looks sporty nonetheless. In my opinion, Honda’s Odyssey has been the sportiest looking minivan on the market since it was redesigned for 2005, but I think the Mazda5 is sportier yet. It features a raked windshield, an aggressively styled front end, a tapered roofline and standard 17-inch alloy wheels and tires.\n\nRide & Handling\nThe Mazda5’s steering response is designed to engage the driver. A turn of the wheel delivers a quick change of direction, and there’s a fair amount of feedback. The suspension is on the firm side, but it provides a tolerable ride even on the broken pavement that’s prevalent near Cars.com’s Chicago headquarters.\n\nGoing & Stopping\nAll Mazda5s have a 2.3-liter four-cylinder engine that makes 157 horsepower and 148 pounds-feet of torque. It’s a smooth-revving unit, but it doesn’t have a whole lot of extra power. With a full load of passengers and cargo, it wouldn’t be hard for the normally adequately powered Mazda5 to be underpowered.\n\nThat said, with one occupant and limited cargo, the Mazda5 cruises easily while you are out touring on flat highways at speeds approaching 80 mph. The cabin gets a bit loud when going that fast, with both wind and road noise contributing to the din.\n\nThe four-cylinder teams with either a standard five-speed manual transmission (the Mazda 5 is currently the only minivan that offers a manual) or an optional four-speed automatic. The automatic transmission’s shifts are smooth, though its clutchless-manual mode is uninspiring (like most I’ve experienced). If you want the control a manual transmission provides, get the real thing. You’ll save some money as the automatic costs $900 extra and has slightly worse fuel mileage: 21/26 mpg (city/highway) versus 22/27 for the manual.\n\nAn irritating trait emerged during highway driving: If the cruise control was set at 70 mph and was resumed when traveling around 65 mph, the automatic transmission would kick down to accelerate. It’s a completely unnecessary response; the engine isn’t that short on power.\n\nAll-disc brakes measure 11.8 inches in front and 11.9 inches in back. The front discs are ventilated for better heat dissipation.\n\nThe Inside\nHere’s where the Mazda5’s compact car origins catch up with it. When compared to larger front-wheel-drive minivans, there’s just not a lot of extra space behind the front bucket seats. The Mazda5 does, however, make efficient use of the space it has.\n\nThe Mazda5’s front seats have aggressively bolstered backrests and are supportive enough to leave you feeling good even after hours at the wheel. They’re fairly snug, though, and may not be comfortable for all body types.\n\nVehicle controls are sensibly arranged and all-around visibility is good. Low-grade hard plastic in the center console significantly mars the interior.\n\nThe second row has two bucket seats that can slide fore and aft for additional legroom in either the second or third row. The seats also recline, and most adults will be able to get comfortable in them.\n\nAdult comfort dips a bit in the 50/50-split third-row bench seat, but it’d be acceptable in a pinch for short trips. If anything, the third row will likely be the hangout for kids, and there’s enough space for them. The second- and third-row seats fold down to create a flat load floor stretching from the rear liftgate to the back of the front seats, good for more than 5 feet.\n\nGive Mazda credit for devising a way to fit six people in relative comfort inside a vehicle that’s only about 3 inches longer than a Toyota Corolla. The downside of this trick is that there’s very limited space — 11.7 cubic feet — behind the third-row seat for any luggage when those six seats are occupied.\n\nSafety\nAs of publication, the Mazda5 has not been crash tested. Standard safety features include antilock brakes, side-impact airbags for the front seats and side curtain airbags for all three rows of seats. Second-row seats have LATCH child-safety seat anchors and top tethers, but the third-row seat only has top tethers.\n\nCargo & Towing\nIf it’s not carrying six occupants, the Mazda5’s measly cargo area can be expanded to 44 cubic feet by folding the third-row seat down. With both the second- and third-row seats folded, there’s 89.3 cubic feet of cargo room. Releasing the liftgate reveals a large opening to the cargo area, and the liftover height is sufficiently low to make loading small furniture easy. The Mazda5 is not rated for towing.\n\nFeatures\nNotable options include a navigation system, DVD entertainment system and a remote starter. A number of dealer-installed accessories are available, including bike and snowboard carriers.\n\nMazda5 in the Market\nJust as others are leaving the small minivan segment, Mazda adds its second offering with the Mazda5, which joins the MPV. While some may question the move, I think there’s a market for this type of vehicle. Its introduction should allow Mazda to supersize the MPV to better compete with the Dodge Grand Caravan, Honda Odyssey and Toyota Sienna.\n\nMarket positioning aside, the Mazda 5 manages to offer surprising utility in a package that’s not as mundane as the traditional SUV or minivan, and that likely will appeal to a number of shoppers.\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "The Mazda5 combines the space of a small minivan with the agility of a sports sedan. It’s not often you can get seating for six in a package that is small enough to be efficient, large enough to be useful and still reasonably fun to drive.\n\nWith a starting price of $17,995, this scaled-down people mover is affordable. It comes in Sport, Touring and Grand Touring models. The Grand Touring model adds a security alarm, Bluetooth hands-free phone system, leather-wrapped shift knob, automatic headlights, LED taillights, heated door mirrors and rain-sensing wipers. Anti-lock brakes are standard on all models.\n\nI drove a Touring model whose sticker price was $21,725.\n\nThe Mazda5 has a 108.3-inch wheelbase and an overall length that is only four inches longer than the compact Mazda3.\n\nSmall people movers are extremely popular in Europe, and I suspect the rising price of gasoline will make them more popular in this country.\n\nFor 2008, the Mazda5’s exterior receives a redesigned grille, a new front fascia, different headlights and new taillights. The overall look is the same, but the changes create a fresher face.\n\nElectroluminescent gauges have been added along with second-row cool-air vents with fan-speed controls, front passenger inboard armrests and second-row passenger outboard armrests. There’s also a tire-pressure monitoring system and an input jack for an MP3 player.\n\nThe interior has undergone numerous changes as well. The instrument panel has new gauges and a new center console. Cool air outlets have been added for second-row passengers.\n\nPower for the Mazda5 comes from a 2.3-liter, four-cylinder engine that has 153 horsepower. The Sport model is available with a five-speed manual transmission, while the GT and Touring come with a standard automatic.\n\nThe four-cylinder engine accelerates smartly and acquits itself well in city driving. It cruises easily on the highway.\n\nWith the automatic transmission, the Mazda5’s fuel economy is rated at 21 mpg in the city and 27 on the highway.\n\nRoad imperfections can be felt through the front suspension, but otherwise the Mazda5 handles without a lot of body roll in turns.\n\nSliding side doors and an interior that can be configured for a variety of uses makes the Mazda5 useful, especially to young families who need space for carpooling one day and soccer equipment the next.\n\nThree features contribute to the vehicle’s roomy interior: a low profile fuel tank, a compact multilink rear suspension and a stepped floor. The stepped floor permits excellent legroom. Legroom is 35.2 inches in the second row and 30.7 in the third.\n\nThe second row has individual seats for greater comfort. They slide, recline and can be folded flat without having the headrests removed. A one-touch lever automatically tips the seatback forward and slides the cushion forward for access to the third row.\n\nThe third-row seats are split 50/50. They can be tipped forward individually or folded to create a flat load floor.\n\nWhen both the second and third seats are folded, the cargo space is 63 inches long. That’s a lot of space for a vehicle with a 108-inch wheelbase.\n\nFront and side airbags are standard, as are side-curtain airbags for all three rows of seats.\n\nPrice\n\nThe base price of the test car was $20,610. Satellite radio and destination charges brought the sticker price to $21,725.\n\nWarranty\n\nThree years or 36,000 miles with a five-year, 60,000-mile powertrain warranty.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in July 2011 about the 2012 Mazda Mazda5. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2013, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe Mazda5 has been something of a curiosity since it debuted. Its sliding side doors technically make it a minivan, but its driving experience and roominess make it more of a small hatchback.\n\nIt’s been updated for 2012 with new styling and a new engine, and it gives minivan buyers a smaller alternative to traditional models. It also gives them something they likely aren’t interested in (nimble handling) while sacrificing something they are (extra room for people and stuff).\n\nThe 2012 Mazda5 won’t work for every family, but if you rarely need that third row and want minivan practicality in a compact package, it just might work for you.\n\nThe Mazda5 starts around $20,000, but the as-tested price for our top-level Grand Touring trim was $24,720. To see differences among the three trims, check out a side-by-side comparison.\n\nRide & Handling\nIts sliding doors notwithstanding, the Mazda5 drives like a small hatchback. Precise, weighty steering and taut but comfortable suspension tuning lend a level of agility that larger, traditional minivans can’t match. Larger bumps don’t rile the Mazda5, but there’s a fair amount of body roll when cornering.\n\nOverall, driving the Mazda5 reminds me of Honda’s Fit hatchback, but with suspension tuning that’s a touch softer. That’s not a bad setup for driving enthusiasts tasked with delivering kids to school or play dates.\n\nFour-Cylinder Power\nThe Mazda5 offers comfortable highway cruising and acceptable acceleration with the five-speed automatic transmission and a larger, slightly more powerful four-cylinder than was offered in 2010. (That’s the last model year the Mazda5 was available.) A six-speed manual transmission is standard on the Sport trim level.\n\nThe Mazda5 gets an EPA-estimated 21/28 mpg city/highway with either transmission, which is a little underwhelming when you consider that most versions of the Honda Odyssey minivan are rated 18/27 mpg and have more room inside for people and stuff, plus V-6 power. A small van like the Mazda5 might seem like an appealing prospect in the face of elevated gas prices, but its smaller engine and overall size don’t, unfortunately, give you the gas mileage edge you might expect.\n\nThe Inside\nInterior styling changes align the Mazda5’s cabin design with the rest of the automaker’s lineup, but they don’t significantly raise the bar on materials quality. There’s still basic-looking plastic trim — particularly on the front doors — that’s out of place on a 2012 model, even an affordably priced one like the Mazda5.\n\nThe front captain’s chairs are comfortable, but the driver’s seat might be cramped for tall drivers. I’m 6-foot-1 and drove with the seat in its rearmost position, and I would have moved it farther back if it had been possible. Other drivers felt the same way.\n\nVisibility has increasingly become a problem in newer cars that prioritize design and aerodynamics, but the Mazda5 thankfully goes against that trend; checking your blind spot is a breeze thanks to large side windows. Nor do the front roof pillars get in the way.\n\nThe Mazda5’s second-row bucket seats remind me of Chrysler’s Stow ‘n Go chairs: The buckets are positioned near the floor, which limits thigh support because your legs are elevated off the seat cushion. The seats fold flat, in line with the folded third row, after you flip forward the seat cushion, but they don’t perform the Chrysler seats’ trick of collapsing into wells in the floor.\n\nThe two-seat third row gives the Mazda5 its six-seat total, but that back row comes with some caveats. Compared with the third row of a regular minivan, the Mazda5’s is predictably small and doesn’t offer much legroom. This makes it only suitable for children, whereas regular minivans can carry adults in the third row without much trouble.\n\nUnlike a regular minivan that can comfortably carry six people — and their luggage — at the same time, to do the same in the Mazda5 you’ll have to spread bags throughout the cabin: Its cargo area behind the third row measures just 5.6 cubic feet. Against the Odyssey’s 38.4 cubic feet of luggage space, there’s no comparison.\n\nOne of the reasons for the discrepancy is the way the seats fold in the respective vans. Like most regular minivans, the Odyssey’s third row folds backward into a well in the floor, so when the seat is upright that deep floor is available for stowing luggage. The Mazda5’s third row, on the other hand, folds forward, so the depth of the cargo floor doesn’t change whether the seat is up or down. If you plan on leaving the Mazda5’s third row down most of the time, you’ll have considerably more cargo room: 27.5 cubic feet, which is plenty of room for four peoples’ things.\n\nSafety\nStandard safety features include antilock brakes, side-impact airbags for the front seats, side curtain airbags for all three rows and an electronic stability system.\n\nFor a full list of safety features, check out the Features & Specs page. To see how child-safety seats fit in the Mazda5, take a look at the Car Seat Check.\n\nMazda5 in the Market\nDespite the rising popularity of crossovers, minivans remain an ideal choice for families looking for maximum versatility and passenger space. The minivan is one of the few types of vehicles that can comfortably transport a family of six on a cross-country road trip one minute and move a college-bound teenager into a freshman dorm the next.\n\nThe Mazda5 loses some of its versatility in favor of compact dimensions that some shoppers will welcome, but the concept hasn’t attracted many followers to date, as the Mazda5 is the only small minivan available in the U.S. right now. Ford had planned to offer a competitor in the seven-seat C-Max, but has since limited its promise to a five-seater with alternative powertrains.\n\nWhether there will be more small minivans in the coming years remains to be seen, though the coming ramp-up in fuel economy regulations seems likely to spur interest in the segment. If it materializes, car shoppers will benefit from the increased competition, but apart from that the Mazda5 is still a solid choice for small families who don’t want the extra bulk of a regular minivan.\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "I got almost everything I wanted from the 2012 Mazda5, a six-seat mini-minivan, but it really depended on what scenario I was putting it through each day.\n\nI quickly learned that I had to keep the “mini” in mind when it came to the Mazda5. Want to haul six passengers but cringe at the fuel-economy numbers found with third-row crossovers and larger vans? You’ll score with the Mazda5 as long as your kids are out of rear-facing child-safety seats. Looking for the convenience of sliding rear doors to load younger children into the vehicle, but want to have a third row to bring along a couple of adult helpers? Don’t count on it in the Mazda5.\n\nThe Mazda5 is an alternative to a traditional sedan or station wagon for families. It can be a more fuel-efficient option when compared to three-row crossovers. It definitely drives more like a car versus a van; for parents who love to drive, this could be the most enticing feature of all. However, don’t expect it to compete equally with a “real” minivan.\n\nI found the Mazda5 to be easy-to-maneuver and somewhat zippy to drive with its four-cylinder engine. I enjoyed avoiding the feeling of steering a boat around town; you can feel the Mazda5’s small size and agility when on the road, despite its “van” status.\n\nThe Mazda5 is economical for families as well, especially when compared to bona-fide minivan competitors. The 2012 Mazda5 has a starting MSRP of $19,625, but my top-of-the-line Grand Touring edition had a sticker price of $25,920.\n\nEXTERIOR\nFor those secretly wishing for minivan conveniences but not quite ready to join the team, the Mazda5 is a much more low-profile start. At first, it looks like a compact hatchback that would be at home on the streets of Europe or Asia. On second glance, you notice rear sliding doors and a taller frame, which clue you in to its minivan characteristics. It’s a good-looking little number.\n\nIt will be easy for all ages to get in and out of the Mazda5, thanks to its low step-in height. A high roofline keeps the grown-ups from having to bend over too much when entering the Mazda5 or getting infants and toddlers settled into their child-safety seats. And, those sliding doors — I’m converted! It’s a huge convenience for such a small detail. I was hoping for a power liftgate, too, but even on the top trim level, it’s not an option.\n\nI was really happy with the cargo area’s size when the third row wasn’t in use and folded flat, but as is the case with many third-row vehicles, once the third row is up, the cargo area is severely diminished. I only had room for groceries when using the third row; no stroller or other gear would fit. When the third row is folded down, there’s plenty of room. Go ahead and pack in a few grocery bags with your stroller in the back!\n\nThe 2012 Mazda5 has a new 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine for this model year that makes 157 horsepower. That’s not bad if you’re looking for a little driving fun on the way to softball practice. My test car’s Grand Touring trim comes with a standard five-speed automatic transmission; a six-speed manual is available on lower trims. With either transmission, the Mazda5 gets an EPA-estimated 21/28 mpg city/highway. It requires regular gasoline, raising the Mazda5’s appeal for an average family. \n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Some\n\nINTERIOR\nI had strong likes and dislikes with the Mazda5’s interior. The interior’s look isn’t exactly upscale; it has a rather stripped-down appearance, which wasn’t a surprise considering the price point, but there were things I expected, especially at my test car’s top-trim level, that weren’t included in this minivan.\n\nWhat was missing? I was surprised there wasn’t a navigation system or a backup camera option on the Mazda5, yet it did come with a rear entertainment system! I was also slightly annoyed by the six-disc CD changer, too; I’d gladly trade it for a screen with better displays for the satellite radio or even a USB input for an iPod. The car only comes with a rudimentary MP3 jack.\n\nWhen it comes to seating, it’s true that the Mazda5 can accommodate six passengers, but not if you throw child-safety seats in the mix. After installing rear-facing convertible seats in the second-row captain’s chairs, the walkway to the third row was obstructed. Although the captain’s chairs slide forward and back to get passengers in the third row, I couldn’t slide them forward with the rear-facing convertibles installed in them. Bummer. That meant I essentially was back to a four-seater. However, if you’ve got two kids in forward-facing car seats or no safety seats at all, the Mazda5 could haul them and a few friends with ease.\n\nKeep in mind that this is a mini-minivan and adjust expectations for the third row accordingly. It’s better suited for children than for adults. However, the second-row captain’s chairs provide lots of flexibility when not holding rear-facing child-safety seats. With their ability to slide back and forth, the captain’s chairs make things a little easier when maneuvering within the cabin.\n\nMy favorite features in the Mazda5 were the hidden storage bins underneath the captain’s chairs. Pull up the seat cushion and there’s room to store books, toys or even reusable shopping bags. And all passengers are guaranteed a cupholder — there are two up front (along with a storage bin), two more in a center console that sits between second row’s seats (and can be folded out of the way when not in use) and two more for third-row passengers.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSAFETY\nThe Mazda5 can easily accommodate all kinds of child-safety seats in its second-row captain’s chairs, where its two sets of lower Latch anchors are found. I expected the Latch anchors to be a little easier to access, but they were buried in the seat cushions. The third row doesn’t have any Latch anchors, but there are two top tether anchors midway down the seatbacks. The third row can accommodate a forward-facing convertible (installed with a seat belt) and booster seats. See how the Mazda5 performed in Cars.com’s Car Seat Check here.\n\nStandard safety features in the 2012 Mazda5 are front-wheel drive, all-disc antilock brakes with brake assist, an electronic stability system with traction control and six airbags, including side curtains for all three rows.\n\nThe Mazda5 hasn’t been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the federal government.\n\nGet more safety information on the 2012 Mazda5 here.",

      "expert_review": "The 2010 Mazda5 is kind of an odd vehicle.\n\nIt doesn’t seem to fit into any category. Is it a tall wagon or a small minivan? Car, crossover or something else?\n\nThe sliding second-row doors leave a minivan taste in some people’s mouths, but when you drive it, it feels more like a car. Technically speaking, it’s classified as midsize wagon — though it lacks both the wagon and midsize feel. Mazda calls it a multi-activity vehicle, which makes it sound like Julie McCoy on the Love Boat.\n\nPerhaps it drifted into one of those magical automotive white spaces where nothing else really hits it head to head. It can carry six passengers, has three rows and just enough quirky personality to scare some buyers away. What do you cross shop it against, the Honda Element or Ford Transit Connect?\n\nBut that’s part of the fun of the Mazda5 — it defies expectations because it’s so difficult to actually create a reasonable set of standards to judge it by. Instead, just get in it and drive.\n\nUnderpowered, but nimble\n\nCruising around in the Mazda5, I didn’t find anything scary at all. I liked this little-roller-skate-looking-vehicle thingy with front-wheel drive.\n\nIt was a little underpowered. The 2.3-liter pumps out 153 horsepower and 148 pound-feet of torque, so it didn’t have that highway zoom zoom or noticeably zippy pickup you see on both numerical sides of the Mazda5 — specifically the Mazda 3 and Mazda 6.\n\nBut its small stature provides a great riding position and the Mazda5 was surprisingly nimble around town. It’s the kind of vehicle that feels perfect for most daily chores. It parks nicely in tight spaces, is easy to maneuver through traffic — with great lines of sight — and it’s comfortable to ride in. The big profile may cause a little crosswind buffeting, but none of that ever worried me.\n\nOverall, the ride is pretty nice, though there is a lot of road noise seeping into the cabin. The independent suspension glides over bumps. The five-speed automatic transmission is smooth and never races to find fifth gear.\n\nWhile little has changed for the 2010 model year, the Mazda5 does come with standard electronic stability control and traction control.\n\nThe proportions seem a little out of whack with the long wheelbase (108 inches) and shorter overall length (181.5 inches). But it looks stable and seems to favor comfort over flash.\n\nThere’s lots of space inside\n\nFor the most part, Mazda’s designers and engineers shared those ideals, creating a vehicle with loads of utility. Through some trick engineering, they created a low-profile fuel tank and compact rear suspension over a stepped floor to free up lots of space inside. Sometimes it’s the things you don’t see that make a big difference.\n\nThat difference means up to 30.7 inches of legroom in the tiny third row. That’s more than some airlines give you, which any adult will attest, is not great for a long haul.\n\nThe captain’s chairs in the second row make it easy for kids to move to the back and let adults sit comfortably in the front two rows. Really, once you’re inside the Mazda5, there’s lots of room.\n\nFurthermore, it’s a good use of space. The captain chairs fold flat, and with just the third row folded down, there more than 44 cubic feet of space to haul stuff.\n\nThen there are those sliders. I love them.\n\nWhile I do not have children, I do believe anyone transporting a child to a place where other people have new cars should be required by law to have a vehicle with sliding doors. Your kids may be cute, but unless you want to leave $200 under my wiper blade to pay for ding removal, either teach them to open a door slowly or get a vehicle with sliding doors. Some adults should take note, too.\n\nDoor bashing aside, the sliding doors create a huge hole to climb into the car, making second-row ingress and egress easy — even for kids. Plus, they make a very cool sound every time they slide out.\n\nVehicle filled with surprises\n\nInside the Mazda5 there are lots of little surprises that will please everyone riding in it. There are second-row vents to keep people cooler (or warmer). The seats are comfortable and the controls in the front are easy to use and well laid out.\n\nThroughout, it feels like a well-planned family vehicle, ready for a multitude of activities.\n\nIt may not fit the traditional mold of sedan or minivan or even crossover. But nowadays, breaking tradition seems to be the norm. It can haul stuff, carry kids, and handle the traditional commute, hitting 27 miles per gallon on the highway and 21 mpg in the city — both respectable numbers.\n\nFor someone looking for flash, there are plenty of Mazdas to choose from, but for someone who’s looking for a good value — my nicely loaded test vehicle was $22,480 — this fits the mold it broke.\n\nThat may be the oddest part: For something that doesn’t really fit into a specific category, the Mazda5 can handle just about any task asked of it.\n\nsburgess@detnews.com (313) 223-3217",

      "expert_review": "When flipping though the pages of a parenting magazine whose subscription I’ve been meaning to cancel (my kids are 4 and 6, and I no longer need or want to read about great new birthing techniques every month), I became intrigued by ads for the Mazda5. What is it? A miniaturized minivan? A big sport wagon with sliding doors and room for six? My curiosity was matched by hordes of emails from other young mothers wanting to know about it as well. I was a bit skeptical at first. Although I appreciate the ingenuity of a company that thinks outside the box wide enough to create a car that none can define, I have to admit I don’t really like the way this car looks. The only thing dorkier than a minivan is a mini minivan. To me, the sloping nose and wedge shape of the vehicle is, well, lame.\n\nHowever, after driving the Mazda5 Touring for a week, my opinion has taken a complete 180 and I’m now forced to bite my tongue and apologize profusely for my previous (and, I’ll admit, slightly rude) comments regarding the car’s aesthetics. Functionality always wins, and the Mazda5 is a fantastic specimen of functionality on a budget.\n\nIt all starts with the sliding doors. If you haven’t experienced sliding minivan-esque doors, you should. The ones on the Mazda5 manually open to expose a 27.5-inch-wide by 42.6-inch-tall opening for easy access to both the second and third rows. They’re easy for children to operate on their own (if you want them to), and they’re more efficient in tight parking spaces because they take up much less space than traditional hinged doors (which inevitably trap passengers on one side or the other when trying to enter the vehicle). The one downside to the Mazda5’s sliding doors is that the mechanics of the sliding hinge on the bottom of the door are exposed, and during my test drive they tended to trap my daughter’s pant leg in the hinge when she was trying to enter the car, causing her leg to get stuck and pinched in the door. No harm done, but it’s a point to be mentioned.\n\nThe seating configuration in the Mazda5 is two in the first row, two in the second row (both with Latch anchors and tethers) and two more in the third row. The seats in the second row sport under-seat storage bins. The space between the second-row captain’s chairs can be left open as an alley to the third row, or more aptly utilized with a fold-up cargo net (ropes course for action figures), cupholders (deadly crocodile-laden pools for said action figures) and/or a pop-on tray (picnic table for dinner on the go). The seats slide forward and backward to create additional legroom when needed, plus they tip forward for access to the third row, recline and fold flat in one step. The third row splits 50/50 and can be folded in one step to create an infinite number of seating and cargo-storage configurations. Bravo, bravo!\n\nDriving the Mazda5 is equally a pleasure. Expecting a floaty ride like I experience in most minivans, I’m pleasantly surprised by the Mazda5’s nimble agility. With none of the tilt and sway that goes along with cornering in a taller vehicle, the Mazda5 drives more like a sport wagon. With a turning radius of just 34.8 feet, this vehicle can handle tight U-turns quickly, before anyone can catch me turning where I’m not supposed to – theoretically speaking, of course.\n\nAlso sporting plenty of standard safety features – such as front, side and curtain airbags for all three rows, “crushable” brake and accelerator pedals, and convenience features such as remote keyless entry and steering-wheel-mounted audio controls, all for dirt cheap – the Mazda5 is the perfect example of functionality on a budget. The Mazda5 Sport model starts at $17,695, the Touring version costs $19,150 and the Grand Touring is $21,300. Maybe now you can afford to have that third baby and still afford to marry them all off in the end (there is a light at the end of the tunnel, isn’t there?).\n\n*For more information on the Mazda5 and its safety features, visit www.cars.com.\n\nLET’S TALK NUMBERS\n\nLATCH Connectors: 2\n\nSeating Capacity (includes driver): 5\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair – Ample\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair – Ample\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair – Great\n\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times",
