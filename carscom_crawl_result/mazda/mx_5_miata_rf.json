      "expert_review": "What Is the 2022 Mazda MX-5 Miata?\n\nThe Mazda MX-5 Miata is powered by a 181-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that works with a standard six-speed manual or optional six-speed automatic transmission. The base, rear-wheel-drive two-seater comes with a standard manual-folding soft-top, while the nifty-but-pricey RF model has a power-folding retractable hardtop; with the top up, this gives the Miata the look of a sporty coupe. The MX-5 competes with the Toyota GR 86 and Subaru BRZ.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2022 Mazda MX-5 Miata?\n\nA new Kinematic Posture Control system aims to improve cornering performance by selectively applying the inside rear brake in turns.\n\nWhat Features in the 2022 Mazda MX-5 Miata Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n16-inch black alloy wheels\nLED headlights and taillights\nLeather-wrapped steering wheel\n7-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nLow-speed automatic emergency braking\nLane departure warning\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n17-inch BBS forged wheels\nRetractable hardtop\nLimited-slip differential\nBilstein shocks\nBrembo front brakes\nBose premium stereo\nRecaro sport seats\nHeated seats\nLeather-trimmed seats\nNavigation\nAutomatic air conditioning\nShould I Buy the 2022 Mazda MX-5 Miata?\n\nIf you can afford nearly $29,000 for a highly impractical car, go for it. The MX-5 Miata is thrilling to drive, and it doesn’t demand a big financial outlay when it’s time to refuel. Taller car shoppers, however, take note: The cabin is a tight fit if you’re above-average height. The trunk is also tiny; a pair of soft-sided bags for a weekend getaway will max it out.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Mazda MX-5 Miata?\n\nThe Mazda MX-5 Miata is powered by a 181-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that works with a standard six-speed manual or optional six-speed automatic transmission. The base rear-wheel-drive two-seater comes with a standard manual-folding soft top, while the nifty-but-pricey RF has a power-folding retractable hardtop; with the top up, this gives the Miata the look of a sporty coupe. The MX-5 competes with the Toyota GR 86 and Subaru BRZ.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Mazda MX-5 Miata?\n\nThere are no significant changes for this year. \n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Mazda MX-5 Miata Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n16-inch black alloy wheels\nLED headlights and taillights\nLeather-wrapped steering wheel\n7-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nLow-speed automatic emergency braking\nLane departure warning \nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n17-inch BBS forged wheels\nRetractable hardtop\nLimited-slip differential \nBilstein shocks\nBrembo front brakes\nBose premium stereo\nRecaro sport seats\nHeated seats\nLeather-trimmed seats\nNavigation\nAutomatic air conditioning\nShould I Buy the 2023 Mazda MX-5 Miata?\n\nIf you can afford nearly $30,000 for a highly impractical car, go for it. The MX-5 Miata is thrilling to drive, and it doesn’t demand a big financial outlay when it’s time to refuel. Taller car shoppers take note, however: The cabin is a tight fit if you’re above-average height. The trunk is also tiny, with space for only a pair of soft-sided bags for your weekend getaways.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Mazda MX-5 Miata?\n\nThe Mazda MX-5 Miata is a two-seat, rear-wheel-drive sports car powered by a 181-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that works with a standard six-speed manual or optional six-speed automatic transmission. The base version comes with a manual-folding soft top, while the RF (short for retractable fastback) has a power-folding retractable hard top; with the top up, this Miata has the look of a sporty coupe. The MX-5 competes with the Toyota GR86 and Subaru BRZ, but those models come only as fixed-roof coupes.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Mazda MX-5 Miata?\n\nAfter a round of functional and cosmetic updates for 2024, the Miata is unchanged for 2025 save for the addition of a specially trimmed, limited-production 35th Anniversary edition.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Mazda MX-5 Miata Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n16-inch black alloy wheels\nLED headlights and taillights\nLeather-wrapped steering wheel\n8.8-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nLow speed automatic emergency braking\nLane departure warning\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n17-inch BBS forged wheels\nRetractable hard top\nLimited-slip differential\nBilstein shocks\nBrembo front brakes\nBose premium stereo\nRecaro sport seats\nHeated seats\nLeather-trimmed seats\nNavigation\nAutomatic climate control\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nAdaptive cruise control (automatic transmission only)\nShould I Buy the 2025 Mazda MX-5 Miata?\n\nIt isn’t quite the bargain it once was — and its design is long in the tooth — but the MX-5 Miata remains one of the best sports cars on the market. It’s tremendously fun to drive even in everyday commuting, and it’s especially fuel-efficient for a sports car. Taller car shoppers, however, take note: The cabin is a tight fit if you’re above-average height, particularly in the RF. The trunk is also tiny, with space for only a pair of soft-sided bags for a weekend getaway.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2021 Mazda MX-5 Miata?\n\nThe Mazda MX-5 Miata is powered by a 181-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that works with a standard six-speed manual or optional six-speed automatic transmission. This rear-wheel-drive two-seater comes with a standard manual-folding soft-top, while the nifty but pricey RF model has a power-folding retractable hardtop. The RF gives the Miata the look of a sporty coupe when the top is in place. The MX-5 is built on the same platform as the Fiat 124 Spider, and rivals include the Toyota 86 and Subaru BRZ.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2021 Mazda MX-5 Miata?\n\nThe high-end Grand Touring trim level gains wireless Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity. \n\nWhat Features in the 2021 Mazda MX-5 Miata Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n16-inch black alloy wheels\nLED headlights and taillights\nLeather-wrapped steering wheel\nPush-button start\n7-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nLow-speed automatic emergency braking\nLane departure warning \nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n17-inch BBS forged wheels\nRetractable hardtop\nLimited-slip differential \nBilstein shocks\nBrembo front brakes\nBose premium stereo\nRecaro sport seats\nHeated seats\nLeather-trimmed seats\nNavigation\nAutomatic air conditioning\nShould I Buy the 2021 Mazda MX-5 Miata?\n\nIf you can afford nearly $28,000 for a highly impractical car, go for it. The MX-5 Miata is thrilling to drive and doesn’t demand much financial outlay when it’s time to refuel. Taller car shoppers, take note: The cabin is a tight fit if you’re above-average height. The trunk is also tiny; a pair of soft-sided bags for a weekend getaway will max it out.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: In an era when cars increasingly isolate their drivers and passengers from their surroundings, the 2024 Mazda MX-5 Miata stands out for its emphasis on connecting drivers with both the act of driving and the world around them — for better or worse.\n\nVersus the competition: Miata competitors have come and gone over the years, but today it stands alone as an affordable two-seat, rear-wheel-drive convertible.\n\nRefinement is a characteristic that’s typically praised in vehicles, as it results in a more comfortable, less taxing driving experience. But there’s a downside to refinement: It often comes at the expense of driving engagement, contributing to a general dulling of the driving experience. If your driving mostly involves traffic-clogged urban commuting, that’s not a bad thing — but what if you want a heightened, connected driving feel but don’t want to spend luxury-car money? Where do you turn?\n\nRelated: 2024 Mazda MX-5 Miata Gets Performance and Tech Upgrades, Price Upcharge\n\nTo this: the 2024 Mazda MX-5 Miata. It’s one of a handful of affordably priced, sporty cars that place their focus squarely on driving engagement (the Subaru BRZ and Toyota GR86 corporate-cousin coupes are two others). There are costs, however, to this focus, so let’s get into both the pros and cons.\n\nA Sensory Delight …\n\nThe Miata is one of those rare cars that’s a lot of fun to drive even when you’re not going especially fast. With its standard six-speed manual transmission, the Miata has a light-effort clutch pedal that pairs with a direct and precise short-throw shifter; the combo is a joy to operate, enhancing the car’s man-machine connection.\n\nThe Miata gets a new steering rack for the 2024 model year, which Mazda says has less friction, and updated electric-assist calibration for smoother operation, a more defined on-center feel and greater cornering precision. The Miata’s steering is natural and responsive overall, and you get a sense of the road’s surface through the steering wheel itself.\n\nStupefying power and torque figures have never been the Miata’s game, and they still aren’t. The car is powered by a naturally aspirated 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that makes 181 horsepower at a high 7,000 rpm and 151 pounds-feet of torque at 4,000 rpm. The Miata is quick enough if you’re willing to let the four-cylinder wind itself out, but you have to work the engine fairly hard to extract its performance.\n\nWhere the Miata really shines is in corners, where it exhibits a stable, planted feel that engenders confidence; this car just wants to be tossed around. A low center of gravity, nearly 50:50 weight distribution, a relatively light curb weight of around 2,400 pounds and an available sport-tuned suspension with Bilstein shocks help make everyday driving situations fun.\n\nThe fact that the Miata is a convertible heightens the driving experience that much more since you can remove a physical layer (the roof) between you and your surroundings. The Miata’s manual soft top is one of the simplest ones you’ll find; there’s a center latch connecting the top to the windshield, and once it’s released, all you have to do is push the lightweight top back and down. Putting the top back up involves pulling a handle between the seatbacks, then lifting the top up and toward the windshield to latch it in place. It’s very easy to use and lets you go from top-up to top-down motoring (and vice versa) very quickly.\n\n… That’s Not Without Costs\n\nWhile elements of the driving experience that you want to have heightened are in the Miata, so too are qualities that can get aggravating when you just need to get from Point A to Point B. The cabin is very noisy on the highway, and it’s disrupted at more moderate speeds by the buzzy four-cylinder engine. The lack of isolation that makes it such an entertaining car to drive also means that cruising at 70 mph feels like you’re going 100 mph, and that gets tiring after a while.\n\nThe Miata’s low ride height means its bucket seats are also low, and that can make getting into or out of the car a challenge if you’re not especially limber. Once you are seated, you’ll likely notice there’s not a lot of space for you or your stuff in the cabin. There isn’t a traditional glove box, and the car gets by with some unusual cupholder solutions: One hangs off the center console and another is tucked against the inner side bolster of the driver’s seat.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2025 Mazda MX-5 Miata: Pure Driving Joy Priced From $30,515, 35th Anniversary Edition Inbound\nWhich New Cars Have Manual Transmissions?\n93,500 Mazda MX-5 Miatas, Fiat 124 Spiders Recalled for Airbags\nResearch the 2024 Mazda MX-5 Miata\nShop for a New Mazda MX-5 Miata Near You\nWorth the Price\n\nThe as-tested price of the top, Grand Touring trim level I drove was $36,200 (including destination) — not inexpensive by any means, but also not outlandish. The base Sport trim starts at $30,170, but at that price, you don’t get some of the performance features that are present in the Grand Touring, like a sport suspension and limited-slip differential.\n\nThe Miata has been around for more than 30 years, and its essence as an entertaining and affordable sports car has been a constant during its run. It may just be a weekend toy for some buyers, but if you like driving — and the way you feel when you’re behind the wheel of the right kind of car — the Miata is an incredibly fun toy for furthering that passion. If you didn’t get what you wanted for Christmas, now’s your time.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

The rear-wheel-drive two-seater comes with a standard manual-folding soft-top; a nifty but pricey RF model has a power-folding retractable hardtop. The MX-5 is built on the same platform as the Fiat 124 Spider, and other rivals include the Toyota 86 and Subaru BRZ.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Mazda MX-5 Miata?\n\nNew standard active safety features include low-speed automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning and blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert. The midlevel Club trim now comes with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity, while manual-transmission Grand Touring models now have the limited-slip differential, Bilstein shocks and a front shock tower brace from the Club trim. A gray soft-top and red Nappa leather interior are also available for the Grand Touring. \n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Mazda MX-5 Miata Are Most Important?\n\nThe MX-5 Miata’s most important features are the kind you can’t check off on a list of specs: seductive looks, brisk acceleration, crisp handling, a convertible top that’s easy to fold and raise, and the ability to make you smile every time you get behind the wheel.\n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Mazda MX-5 Miata?\n\nIf you can afford nearly $28,000 for a highly impractical car, go for it. Your reward will be the enjoyment of driving it.",

      "expert_review": "There’s a half-joke among automotive enthusiasts that the answer to any car-choice question is always “Miata.” The recently introduced Mazda Miata with a retractable fastback RF gets similar updates to the traditional soft-top convertible version for 2019, including a slightly increased price: Club models now start at $33,240 with a six-speed manual transmission and $33,840 with a six-speed automatic, both increasing by $435. Grand Touring models of the MX-5 Miata increase $585 to $34,230 with the manual and $35,305 with the auto. All Mazda MX-5 Miata prices include an $895 destination fee.\n\nRelated: 2019 Mazda MX-5 Miata: 3 Things You Need to Know\n\nThe biggest news for this Mazda, however, is the increase in power from the Miata’s engine. Its SkyActiv 2.0-liter four-cylinder makes the same 181 horsepower and 151 lb-ft of torque as the convertible — a 17 percent horsepower increase from previous model years. Additional new features include a required-by-law standard backup camera across all trims and, for the first time, a standard tilt/telescoping steering wheel. Some MX-5 engineers purportedly resisted this change because of the added weight and only relented after steel parts in the steering column were replaced with aluminum to offset the increase.\n\nNewly available options packages on the MX-5 Miata RF include a GT-S Package, available on Grand Touring models with the six-speed manual, adding a front-shock tower brace, a limited-slip rear differential and Bilstein dampers for an extra $750. MX-5 Miata club models can now be equipped with Brembo brakes and BBS Miata wheels for $3,770; bump that up to $4,670 and Mazda will throw in Recaro bucket seats along with the MX-5’s brake and wheel updates. The Recaros can’t be had on their own, and both the brake/wheel and brake/wheel/seat upgrades are only available on Mazda Miata models equipped with a manual transmission.\n\nYou may have noticed that no factory performance options are available for automatic-transmission-equipped models. Take the not at all subtle hint and get the manual if you’re able.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
