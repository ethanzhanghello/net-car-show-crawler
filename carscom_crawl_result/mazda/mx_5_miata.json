      "expert_review": "Only in America can you celebrate independence from the British by driving around in a Japanese roadster hunting displays of fireworks manufactured in Hong Kong.\n\nWhen last we slipped behind the wheel of a Mazda Miata, the car had barely reached market. It was in short supply, a vehicle brought out to determine whether those who once loved British roadsters would rekindle the affair in a car that looked British but carried a made-in-Japan label.\n\nMazda found that Miata was a huge success when it was introduced in spring of 1989 as a 1990 model. Not only did consumers want to get their hands on one, some were willing to pay $5,000 more than sticker price to obtain one of only about 20,000 made the first year-and only with five-speed manual transmissions.\n\nThe little sports car-and we emphasize little, considering the 89-inch wheelbase and 155-inch overall length-proved that people wanted a cute drop- top two-seater, even if it had more mystique than muscle.\n\nIn the `89 calendar year Mazda sold 23,052 Miatas. Sales grew to 35,944 in 1990 and eased a bit, to 31,240, in 1991. Despite the decline, Miata ranked as the No. 1-selling convertible in the industry in 1991.\n\nFor 1992 Mazda made scant changes other than adding all-black and all- yellow versions. It plans to build 1,500 yellow Miatas and 7,500 black ones.\n\nWe tested the black Miata, which Mazda calls Brilliant Black (it`s Sunburst Yellow, by the way). “Brilliant“ it is. You need to put on shades about three blocks away because the body panels shine so much. Keep in mind that black, when clean, is one of the richest car colors, but when airborne scum lands on the finish, nothing looks more ragged.\n\nIn other words, don`t opt for Brilliant Black if all the care you give the car each week is to fill it with gas.\n\nOne other word of warning about a Brilliant Black Miata. It only comes with tan seats and trim. Some love the combination. Others may find it takes time to get used to. Others would simply take a pass because they know any all-black car really should have an all-mauve interior.\n\nMiata is powered by a 1.6-liter, 116-horsepower, 16-valve engine. That`s 116 horsepower at 6,500 r.p.m., meaning you get lots of exhaust noise off the light but not a lot of kick until well after you`re up to cruising speed. The 25 m.p.g. city/30 highway mileage with the five-speed manual, 24/28 with the four-speed automatic, serves notice that Miata isn`t meant to be raced from light to light as it is to be enjoyed simply by lowering the top and heading for a peaceful patch of countryside for leisurely driving.\n\nYou can sprinkle the highway stroll with a few quick downshifts and upshifts as you slip into and out of corners when you reach hilly or curving terrain.\n\nFour-wheel independent suspension and rack-and-pinion steering help reduce harshness when the road no longer is flat or straight. A tw eak here and there to the rear suspension makes for noticeably better handling and response to wheel input on the rear-wheel-drive Miata for 1992.\n\nThe convertible top is one of the easiest in the industry. Snap one lever left and right and simply lift the top up and over your head into the stowage well behind the occupants. A vinyl boot is included to hide the hardware. We expected a tighter fit than the boot provided.\n\nA driver-side air bag is standard. Such protection is a must in a tiny car like this. Unfortunately, a passenger-side bag isn`t coming until 1994.\n\nAnti-lock brakes should be standard but are a $900 option. The price is stiff, but the protection such brakes afford is difficult to calculate from a ditch. Get the anti-lock brakes.\n\nA few changes since Miata`s introduction find remote releases for the trunk and gas-tank door hidden in the center armrest compartment. The optional detachable hardtop sports a rear-window defroster.\n\nThe Miata, which debuted at less than $14,000, now carries a base price of $17,050. Our test car added air conditioning at $830, floor mats at $65, limited-slip differential at $250 and a $1,400 option package that includes 14-inch forged alloy wheels, wooden shift knob and hand-brake lever, stainless-steel scuff plates with the Miata logo, cruise control, power antenna and headrest speakers.\n\nThe test car didn`t have anti-lock brakes. Automatic transmission would have been a $750 option.\n\nMiata is a gem.",

      "expert_review": "The Mazda MX-5 Miata is the one car that you hope never changes.\n\nThere’s been talk at Mazda of offering a bigger engine, installing a turbocharger and producing a coupe version. But let’s hope none of it comes to pass, because almost everything about the Miata is just right. Its performance is perfectly matched to its suspension and brakes. Its snug interior is stylish and comfortable, yet it is designed with simplicity and common sense in mind.\n\nAnd now that supply has caught up with demand, even its price is somewhat flexible.\n\nThe Miata I tested is a special version of the car – one of only 1,500 that will have black paint, a red leather interior, special wheels, a sports-tuned suspension system and a few minor cosmetic changes.\n\nUnfortunately, the Limited Edition Miata’s $22,000 price will likely send your banker into uncontrollable fits of wheezing. Admit it, that’s a heck of a lot of money for a very small car.\n\nBut if there’s about $16,000 in your budget for a new car, you can own a nicely-equipped, regular-production Miata and still have just as much fun.\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nOn paper, the Miata’s fuel-injected 1.6 liter, 16-valve four-cylinder doesn’t look too impressive. After all, 116 horsepower is about average for many small sporty cars. But here’s an instance where horsepower ratings don’t tell the whole story.\n\nBecause the Miata is light (it weighs just 2,220 pounds) and its weight is perfectly balanced (50 percent over the front wheels, 50 percent over the rear), the car is quick, agile and exhilarating to drive.\n\nThe exhaust has a deep growl, but it is not loud or annoying. As you work your way through the gears, the sporty exhaust sound leaves little doubt that you’re driving a real sports car. After all, you wouldn’t expect a two-seat convertible to be as quiet as a family sedan.\n\nWhen the Miata first hit the streets in the summer of 1989 as a 1990 model, auto writers praised it for havingone of thebest-shifting manual transmissions ever put in a sports car.\n\nIt’s still one of the best. The five-speed manual gearbox has a tiny stub of a shifter that takes very little effort to move. First and second gear are just inches apart. A quick flick of the wrist puts the shifter within easy reach of third, fourth and fifth gears.\n\nThe clutch is smooth and easy to operate. Many sports cars require the driver to concentrate on shifting, or at least think about it. In the Miata, shifting at the perfect moment becomes second nature almost immediately. The sound of the engine tells you when to shift for maximum performance. You never need to take your eyes off the road to look at the tachometer or the shifter.\n\nIn the test car, fuel mileage was excellent. In combined city/highway driving without using the air conditioner, the Miata delivered 32 miles per gallon of unleaded fuel.\n\nHANDLING\n\nDriving the tiny Miata takes a serious attitude adjustment. At first you might feel a little vulnerable when the chrome grille of a Cadillac or some other leviathan appears in your rear-view mirror. The Miata is just about 13 feet from stem to stern, but its small size means the advantage is all yours.\n\nPerhaps no other car is as adept as the Miata at squirting in and out of tight places. With the top down and unlimited visibility, something as small as a patch of sunlight between two bumpers in fast-moving traffic is an open invitation to change lanes.\n\nThe power-assisted rack-and-pinion steering is fast-acting and crisp. It was so good that a co-worker was able to make a very tight U-turn without having to cross into the far lane of on-coming traffic.\n\nThe four-wheel independent suspension in the test car was extra firm. It kept the body straight and poised to handle all sorts of road-going gymnastics. But crossing railroad tracks or driving over bad pavement was a punishing, spine-bruising exercise. The suspension system in the standard-issue Miata is a bit softer, but the car’s handling is still excellent.\n\nThe Miata is outfitted with a set of four-wheel power-assisted disc brakes that are strong and fade-free. One minor gripe: anti-lock brakes are optional, but should be standard on all Miatas.\n\nMy driving habits changed after I drove the Miata for a while. I liked the diminutive car so much that my senses were turned up a notch or two, and I drove the Miata very defensively and protectively.\n\nInstinctively, you will know how far and how hard you can push the Miata. And in doing so, you will probably wonder how this much fun can be legal.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nThe MX-5 Miata Limited Edition’s added price is mostly the result of cosmetic add-ons and numerous creature comfort items. For instance, our test car came with front and rear spoilers, special BBS brand wheels, a high-performance AM/FM cassette/CD player, power windows and red leather upholstery.\n\nThe bucket seats were firm and very nicely designed. But heavy or tall people probably are not going to find the Miata’s interior a comfortable place.\n\nWith the seats all the way back, there’s just enough room for a person of 5 feet 10 inches to be comfortable. Although the car sits low, getting in and out is not much of a bother, even if you wear a skirt, as my co-worker did.\n\nThe Miata is easier and more enjoyable to drive with the top down. When the top is raised, you feel a bit claustrophobic and because the top has only a zip out rear window, there is a blind spot on both sides.\n\nStorage room is a very valuable commodity. Most of the available space in the trunk is taken up by the tiny spare tire. There is some room behind the seats for papers, a purse or other small objects.\n\nThe Miata comes standard with a driver’s side air bag. If you don’t like to shift, you can buy the car with an automatic, but the Miata will lose some of its spunky performance.\n\nJust one minor improvement could be made: My elbows sometimes bumped the electric window switches that were mounted on the console near the shifter. The switches would be better off on the door panels.\n\nOf all the cars that have come out in the last 25 years, few have been as admired around the world over as much as the Miata.\n\nWhen a sports car is done right it, doesn’t need to be redesigned and changed every few years. Porsche has sold the 911 for more than two decades. British Leyland sold a trio of sports cars – the MGB, the MG Midget and the Triumph Spitfire – for more than 15 years with just minor changes.\n\nLet’s hope the Miata lasts that long and stays just the way it is.\n\nTruett’s tip: Even though the Limited Edition boasts a price tag many would consider obscene for a small car, the Miata still is one of the most enjoyable automobiles you can own.",

      "expert_review": "I never thought I would meet a Mazda Miata I couldn’t like.\n\nThen came this week’s test car, the Miata R, one of two limited edition models Mazda is peddling this year.\n\nThe other special car, the Miata M Edition, is a fully loaded luxury machine costing $22,000 and change. It’s basically the same as the black-and-red special edition Miata I tested last year, but with a new color scheme and some minor trim changes.\n\nThe Miata R, however, has no luxury items at all.\n\nThe R after the Miata name stands for racing. And that means most items that don’t contribute to the car’s ability to go, stop and turn have been left off.\n\nHard to steer, noisy over rough roads and somewhat uncomfortable, the Miata R somehow manages to erase most of the charm and goodwill created by the original Miata.\n\nUnless you like driving a stripped down, bare-bones car designed for the racetrack, you probably won’t find much to like about the Miata R.\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nFor 1994, the Miata’s double overhead cam, four-cylinder engine has been stretched from 1.6 liters to 1.8 liters, and horsepower has been increased from 116 to 125. The bigger, more powerful engine is standard on all Miatas.\n\nInstead of tweaking the engine’s tuning or making any mechanical changes to increase power, Mazda opted to make the car lighter by taking out the power steering and most accessories, such as power windows and mirrors and cruise control.\n\nMazda spokesman Fred Aikins in California estimated that the Miata R is about 50 pounds lighter than the standard Miata, and he said the performance gained by leaving out all that equipment is marginal at best.\n\nWhat I can’t figure out is why anyone would pay nearly 20 grand for a stripped Miata when for about the same money you can get one with all the goodies and have the almost same performance.\n\nIn any case, the 1.8-liter engine delivers spirited performance. The Miata is no lightning bolt, but it is very quick, snappy and agile. Figure 0 to 60 mph in8.8 seconds.\n\nThe exhaust emits a hearty growl that, especially with the top down, enhances the driving experience. You find yourself revving the engine with a little extra enthusiasm just to hear the sporty rumble from the exhaust.\n\nThere’s plenty of passing power and, once at cruising speed, the Miata settles in quietly.\n\nFuel mileage was generally excellent. With the air conditioner on, I averaged better than 26 mpg in combined city/highway driving.\n\nHANDLING\n\nBecause the Miata R doesn’t offer much better acceleration, you might be thinking that it handles far better than the regular model.\n\nIt doesn’t.\n\nBut I don’t want to mislead you here. The Miata, with a perfect 50/50 weight balance, handles wonderfully. With 50 percent of the weight on the rear wheels and 50 percent on the front, the Miata has a feeling of balance and steadiness that few other sporty cars can equal.\n\nBut because the Miata alr eady handles so well, there just isn’t much room for improvement.\n\nEven though the Miata R handles well in a tight, fast curve, it is not much fun to drive. Without power steering, turning the car is a chore. It takes quite a bit of effort to turn the wheel when doing something like backing out of a parking space. And because the steering is so heavy, the Miata R loses much of its lightning-quick reflexes when you change lanes.\n\nI’m convinced the standard model Miata has the best suspension system. I can see no advantage in the Miata R’s high performance setup.\n\nMazda engineers fitted the Miata R with a special set of Bilstein racing shocks, a limited-slip differential, stiffer suspension bushings and modified stabilizer bars. In doing so, it’s as if they removed the car’s ability to take a bump without causing the whole car to shake, rattle and roll. The suspension is so stiff that each inconsistency in the pavement sends shock waves of energy through the entire ca . That makes it annoying to drive.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nExcept for a powerful AM/FM cassette radio and air conditioning, our test car offered nothing in the way of luxuries.\n\nA base model Ford Mustang, Chevrolet Camaro or Pontiac Firebird convertible offers more of everything than the Miata R -and for far less money.\n\nMazda made a minor but annoying change in the interior of all its Miatas this year. The inside door panels have been redesigned to incorporate map pockets just below the handles. The new style door panels do away with the large armrest. Now there’s no place to prop your left arm when driving. Instead, you have to rest your arm on top of the window ledge.\n\nThe cloth-covered seats in the Miata are unusually comfortable, and they offer good support.\n\nAll Miatas this year are outfitted with dual air bags. Optional anti-lock brakes add $900 to the price of the regular Miata, but are not available on the Miata R. That seems strange, because this is the car that is intended to be driven aggressively.\n\nFront and rear spoilers, special wheels and large white racing stripes on the hood and trunk are the most noticeable features of the Miata R.\n\nMazda still hasn’t addressed a problem I’ve noticed in every Miata I’ve tested since the car first came out five years ago. Interior lighting is exceptionally poor. At night, one small light facing down from the passenger-side dash is all the interior lighting available.\n\nMazda has made some beautiful special edition Miatas in the last three years. But it’s made some mistakes too. The Miata with the optional automatic transmission has not sold particularly well. I can’t see how this one will either.\n\nTruett’s tip: If you have your heart set on a Miata, you’ll probably want to steer clear of the R model. It is expensive, unrefined and tiresome to drive.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Mazda MX-5 Miata?\n\nThe Mazda MX-5 Miata is powered by a 181-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that works with a standard six-speed manual or optional six-speed automatic transmission. The base rear-wheel-drive two-seater comes with a standard manual-folding soft top, while the nifty-but-pricey RF has a power-folding retractable hardtop; with the top up, this gives the Miata the look of a sporty coupe. The MX-5 competes with the Toyota GR 86 and Subaru BRZ.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Mazda MX-5 Miata?\n\nThere are no significant changes for this year. \n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Mazda MX-5 Miata Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n16-inch black alloy wheels\nLED headlights and taillights\nLeather-wrapped steering wheel\n7-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nLow-speed automatic emergency braking\nLane departure warning \nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n17-inch BBS forged wheels\nRetractable hardtop\nLimited-slip differential \nBilstein shocks\nBrembo front brakes\nBose premium stereo\nRecaro sport seats\nHeated seats\nLeather-trimmed seats\nNavigation\nAutomatic air conditioning\nShould I Buy the 2023 Mazda MX-5 Miata?\n\nIf you can afford nearly $30,000 for a highly impractical car, go for it. The MX-5 Miata is thrilling to drive, and it doesn’t demand a big financial outlay when it’s time to refuel. Taller car shoppers take note, however: The cabin is a tight fit if you’re above-average height. The trunk is also tiny, with space for only a pair of soft-sided bags for your weekend getaways.",

      "expert_review": "Mazda’s Miata has been the archetypical two-seat roadster since it was first introduced in 1989. Because it is lightweight, maneuverable and close fitting, it embodies the sports car spirit. More than 700,000 have been sold worldwide.\n\nIts four-cylinder engine was never overpowering, but it had more than adequate zip for a small car that didn’t weigh much. Getting into the Miata was like putting on a pair of newly washed jeans – a little tight at first but comfortable after a few minutes.\n\nThe second-generation Miata had mildly revised styling and a little bigger engine, but now it’s time for generation three, and Mazda debuted an all-new Miata last week at the Geneva, Switzerland, auto show.\n\nThe new car will be called the MX-5 Miata. MX-5 is the name used throughout the rest of the world.\n\nThe lightweight roadster formula remains intact, but the new car is slightly larger and has a bigger engine. Mazda said it wanted to create a car in which the driver and vehicle operated as one. The concept, in Japanese, is called Jinba Ittai, and means “horse and rider as one.”\n\nThe tight-waisted, Coke-bottle shape that was so prominent on the first two Miatas has been subdued in favor of straighter body sides that give a wider cockpit. American buyers will welcome a larger cockpit. Pronounced fender arches accommodate 17-inch wheels that are considerably larger and wider than before.\n\nThe wheelbase has been lengthened 2.6 inches, but overall length is up by less than 1 inch. The car is 1.6 inches wider and less than an inch taller. Shaving excess weight wherever possible means the new car weighs just 22 pounds more than the current car. That’s impressive.\n\nThe new body structure is 22 percent stiffer, and torsional rigidity is up by 47 percent. Mazda said the improvements are due in part to the use of ultra-high-tension steel.\n\nThe engine has been moved back 5.3 inches to preserve the ideal 50:50 front-rear weight distribution. The equal weight distribution gives the car sharp reflexes and excellent handling, a trait that made the original Miata so much fun to drive. The engine is a 160-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder with four valves per cylinder and variable intake valve timing. The block, head and oil pan are aluminum. A light flywheel, electronic throttle and a stiff driveshaft are used to enhance the engine’s responsiveness.\n\nTransmission choices include a six-speed manual or a six-speed automatic transmission. The automatic can be shifted manually with paddles on the steering wheel.\n\nA double-wishbone front suspension is combined with a multi-link rear axle for go-kart handling. Lightweight wheels reduce unsprung weight and that, in turn, helps maintain a lively character. Brakes are four-wheel disc.\n\nThe interior will be available in three trim packages. Base models will have black cloth upholstery and a matte-silver metallic finish for the steering wheel, instrument rims and door handles. Upper models will have either all black or tan-and-black leather on the seats, instrument panel and doors. A piano-black finish is used in several areas.\n\nFive individual round gauges have polarized glass to reduce glare when the top is down. The cabin is designed to fit a wider range of drivers. The steering wheel adjusts and the seat has more room for adjustment.\n\nStorage, often a problem with the current car, is addressed. There are three compartments on the wall behind the seats, cup holders on the console and bottle holders in the doors. A pocket is affixed to the back of the driver’s seat and the passenger’s side of the transmission tunnel.\n\nSide airbags with head protection are mounted in the seats. They are a first for the Miata. The Z-fold convertible top fits flush when lowered. A detachable hard top will be optional.\n\nMazda press materials said the MX-5 goes on sale in the second half of the year.\n\nEngine: 2.0-liter, 160-hp 4-cyl.\n\nTransmission: Six-speed manual or automatic\n\nRear-wheel drive\n\nWheelbase: 91.7 inches\n\nCurb weight: 2,472 est.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Mazda MX-5 Miata?\n\nThe Mazda MX-5 Miata is a two-seat, rear-wheel-drive sports car powered by a 181-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that works with a standard six-speed manual or optional six-speed automatic transmission. The base version comes with a manual-folding soft top, while the RF (short for retractable fastback) has a power-folding retractable hard top; with the top up, this Miata has the look of a sporty coupe. The MX-5 competes with the Toyota GR86 and Subaru BRZ, but those models come only as fixed-roof coupes.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Mazda MX-5 Miata?\n\nAfter a round of functional and cosmetic updates for 2024, the Miata is unchanged for 2025 save for the addition of a specially trimmed, limited-production 35th Anniversary edition.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Mazda MX-5 Miata Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n16-inch black alloy wheels\nLED headlights and taillights\nLeather-wrapped steering wheel\n8.8-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nLow speed automatic emergency braking\nLane departure warning\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n17-inch BBS forged wheels\nRetractable hard top\nLimited-slip differential\nBilstein shocks\nBrembo front brakes\nBose premium stereo\nRecaro sport seats\nHeated seats\nLeather-trimmed seats\nNavigation\nAutomatic climate control\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nAdaptive cruise control (automatic transmission only)\nShould I Buy the 2025 Mazda MX-5 Miata?\n\nIt isn’t quite the bargain it once was — and its design is long in the tooth — but the MX-5 Miata remains one of the best sports cars on the market. It’s tremendously fun to drive even in everyday commuting, and it’s especially fuel-efficient for a sports car. Taller car shoppers, however, take note: The cabin is a tight fit if you’re above-average height, particularly in the RF. The trunk is also tiny, with space for only a pair of soft-sided bags for a weekend getaway.",

      "expert_review": "Miata moves into fast lane\n\nWithout so much of a rev of the engine, the guy in the hot-rod, silver Honda S2000 next to me seemed to sense there was something sinister lurking under the hood of my 2004 Mazdaspeed MX-5 Miata.\n\nMaybe it was the cool 17-inch Racing Hart wheels wrapped with Toyo Proxes high performance radials. (Fancy talk for nice tires.)\n\nMaybe it was air dam under the front bumper. The spoiler on the trunk. Or the Velocity Mica Red and tinted headlamps. (Fancy talk for souped-up looks.)\n\n“A Miata?” he asked, rolling down the window at a stoplight and pointing to my test car.\n\nAs the Dodge Hemi ads say, he was about to find out.\n\nA thrust into first gear, a drop of the clutch and a mash on the gas backed it all up. Mazda isn’t fooling around with the two-seat Miata anymore.\n\n“That’s no Miata,” my lane neighbor said when we met up again at the next red light.\n\nIndeed. Welcome to a whole new way to think of the Miata. No longer relegated to Sunday summer drives, the Miata finally has some meat – and for a great price. And thank heaven.\n\nAlthough Mazda’s been putting out special edition Miatas for about 13 years, the new Mazdaspeed is exactly what the name implies. Speed.\n\nIt is a trip from 0 to 60 mph in a flash. It is great equipment levels and a package that buyers have wanted for so long: power, power and more power. Equipped with Mazda’s first-ever turbocharged engine, it is zoom-zoom and then some.\n\nThe 1.8-liter, four-cylinder engine has been juiced with an air-to-air intercooler that, in layman’s terms, means all kinds of oomph. How much? Try a leap from the standard Miata power of 142 horses to 178 and an increase in torque from 125 to 166 pound-feet. Combine this robust engine with a curb weight of 2,529 pounds, and you have more power than you really need. Translation: Hang on tight.\n\nThe base Miatas have always suffered from more cruisability than driveability. Cramped and tiny, there was pleasure in zipping around town in a car the size of an old British sports car – only with a serious need for zip.\n\nEnter: Zip. With the new engine on board, the turbo doesn’t lag, and power seems to be always at the touch of the pedal. Far and away it’s quicker than the non-turbo, putting the Miata into some serious company for some seriously reasonable cash.\n\nIf you want the maximum vehicle for the best convertible price, you can’t go wrong. With a starting sticker of $25,500 (and $700 more for leather), this is one of the best bargains on the block for the power, performance and fun factor of a convertible.\n\nThe six-speed manual transmission lets you work the revs and push the Miata into corners and out of tight turns. But Mazda didn’t stop there. Always known for its balanced approach to the road, the new Miata includes larger front and rear anti-roll bars, stiffer springs and a front-end pack age that keeps things nice and rigid.\n\nUnder the sheet metal, the clutch is stronger, the pistons reshaped and the six-speed more durable. The ride is even dropped a little to give it that “slammed” look.\n\nThat doesn’t mean it’s necessarily comfortable, mind you. This is a car that is meant to bounce around a bit. And if you hit the wrong pothole, the Miata will snap you around.\n\nStill, this car isn’t about getting from Point A to Point B in daily traffic. It’s all about the experience. And, make no mistake, it’s still a looker.\n\nWith the addition of all those extras – tinted lights, rear spoiler – the Miata enjoys a great deal of top-down appeal. It’s still small (especially when highway driving means passing a semi-truck), but it’s very sleek.\n\nFront end curves meld into short sides and a sharp back end. Inside, there are all of the Miata staples: small dials and gauges, tiny vents and narrow storage compartments, a la the old British spo ts cars.\n\nThe top folds down – old-school style with no power top. Instead, two flips of levers under the roof and a gentle push back collapses the convertible. It comes up with one tug.\n\nThe limited dimensions are worth mentioning. This is a small car with a tight cabin. Even working the pedals can be a little tight, especially with little room in the footwell. No tilt steering is another drag for tall drivers.\n\nThis year there are more than 1,000 parts that have been substituted on the Mazdaspeed from the regular car, and that means something special as well. It all adds up to a great package.\n\nAnd it”s a good thing. This Miata is actually on the way out. The Ibuki concept car unveiled on the auto show circuit is the next generation of Miata that will eventually hit the streets, with more of the styling that is reminiscent of the original car and with underpinnings delivered from the very incredible RX-8.\n\nIn the meantime, we’ll take this one. It’s fast, sleek, stylish and fun.\n\nDon’t believe it? Ask the guy in the hot rod next to me who still can’t believe it’s true.\n\n———————————————————————–\n\n2004 Mazdaspeed MX-5 Miata\n\nVehicle type: Rear-wheel-drive, front-engine, two-door, two-passenger convertible\n\nKey competition: Audi TT roadster, Honda S2000, BMW Z4, Volkswagen Beetle convertible\n\nBase engine: 178 horsepower, 1.8-liter four-cylinder\n\nOptional engine: None\n\nTransmission: Six-speed manual\n\nStandard safety equipment: Four-wheel anti-lock disc brakes, front air bags\n\nMPG rating: 20 city/26 highway\n\nManufactured: Japan\n\nWarranty: Basic warranty is four years/50,000 miles with roadside assistance.\n\nBase price: $25,500\n\nPrice as tested (including destination and delivery): $26,200",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: In an era when cars increasingly isolate their drivers and passengers from their surroundings, the 2024 Mazda MX-5 Miata stands out for its emphasis on connecting drivers with both the act of driving and the world around them — for better or worse.\n\nVersus the competition: Miata competitors have come and gone over the years, but today it stands alone as an affordable two-seat, rear-wheel-drive convertible.\n\nRefinement is a characteristic that’s typically praised in vehicles, as it results in a more comfortable, less taxing driving experience. But there’s a downside to refinement: It often comes at the expense of driving engagement, contributing to a general dulling of the driving experience. If your driving mostly involves traffic-clogged urban commuting, that’s not a bad thing — but what if you want a heightened, connected driving feel but don’t want to spend luxury-car money? Where do you turn?\n\nRelated: 2024 Mazda MX-5 Miata Gets Performance and Tech Upgrades, Price Upcharge\n\nTo this: the 2024 Mazda MX-5 Miata. It’s one of a handful of affordably priced, sporty cars that place their focus squarely on driving engagement (the Subaru BRZ and Toyota GR86 corporate-cousin coupes are two others). There are costs, however, to this focus, so let’s get into both the pros and cons.\n\nA Sensory Delight …\n\nThe Miata is one of those rare cars that’s a lot of fun to drive even when you’re not going especially fast. With its standard six-speed manual transmission, the Miata has a light-effort clutch pedal that pairs with a direct and precise short-throw shifter; the combo is a joy to operate, enhancing the car’s man-machine connection.\n\nThe Miata gets a new steering rack for the 2024 model year, which Mazda says has less friction, and updated electric-assist calibration for smoother operation, a more defined on-center feel and greater cornering precision. The Miata’s steering is natural and responsive overall, and you get a sense of the road’s surface through the steering wheel itself.\n\nStupefying power and torque figures have never been the Miata’s game, and they still aren’t. The car is powered by a naturally aspirated 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that makes 181 horsepower at a high 7,000 rpm and 151 pounds-feet of torque at 4,000 rpm. The Miata is quick enough if you’re willing to let the four-cylinder wind itself out, but you have to work the engine fairly hard to extract its performance.\n\nWhere the Miata really shines is in corners, where it exhibits a stable, planted feel that engenders confidence; this car just wants to be tossed around. A low center of gravity, nearly 50:50 weight distribution, a relatively light curb weight of around 2,400 pounds and an available sport-tuned suspension with Bilstein shocks help make everyday driving situations fun.\n\nThe fact that the Miata is a convertible heightens the driving experience that much more since you can remove a physical layer (the roof) between you and your surroundings. The Miata’s manual soft top is one of the simplest ones you’ll find; there’s a center latch connecting the top to the windshield, and once it’s released, all you have to do is push the lightweight top back and down. Putting the top back up involves pulling a handle between the seatbacks, then lifting the top up and toward the windshield to latch it in place. It’s very easy to use and lets you go from top-up to top-down motoring (and vice versa) very quickly.\n\n… That’s Not Without Costs\n\nWhile elements of the driving experience that you want to have heightened are in the Miata, so too are qualities that can get aggravating when you just need to get from Point A to Point B. The cabin is very noisy on the highway, and it’s disrupted at more moderate speeds by the buzzy four-cylinder engine. The lack of isolation that makes it such an entertaining car to drive also means that cruising at 70 mph feels like you’re going 100 mph, and that gets tiring after a while.\n\nThe Miata’s low ride height means its bucket seats are also low, and that can make getting into or out of the car a challenge if you’re not especially limber. Once you are seated, you’ll likely notice there’s not a lot of space for you or your stuff in the cabin. There isn’t a traditional glove box, and the car gets by with some unusual cupholder solutions: One hangs off the center console and another is tucked against the inner side bolster of the driver’s seat.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2025 Mazda MX-5 Miata: Pure Driving Joy Priced From $30,515, 35th Anniversary Edition Inbound\nWhich New Cars Have Manual Transmissions?\n93,500 Mazda MX-5 Miatas, Fiat 124 Spiders Recalled for Airbags\nResearch the 2024 Mazda MX-5 Miata\nShop for a New Mazda MX-5 Miata Near You\nWorth the Price\n\nThe as-tested price of the top, Grand Touring trim level I drove was $36,200 (including destination) — not inexpensive by any means, but also not outlandish. The base Sport trim starts at $30,170, but at that price, you don’t get some of the performance features that are present in the Grand Touring, like a sport suspension and limited-slip differential.\n\nThe Miata has been around for more than 30 years, and its essence as an entertaining and affordable sports car has been a constant during its run. It may just be a weekend toy for some buyers, but if you like driving — and the way you feel when you’re behind the wheel of the right kind of car — the Miata is an incredibly fun toy for furthering that passion. If you didn’t get what you wanted for Christmas, now’s your time.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe car that started the roadster revival more than 10 years ago is spruced up for the spring and summer with a Special Edition model. Unique features on the Miata Special Edition include a six-speed manual transmission, parchment-colored leather upholstery, mahogany mica paint, a 200-watt Bose audio system and other amenities.\n\nMiata debuted for the 1990 model year as a basic sports car like the British roadsters of the 1950s and 1960s but with Japanese quality and reliability. Though it was redesigned in 1999, the current Miata retains similar dimensions and styling as the original.\n\nExterior\nWith an overall length of 155 inches, the Miata is a trim-sized roadster that is about 3 inches shorter than the BMW Z3. It comes with a standard manually folding convertible top that can be raised or lowered from the drivers seat. The convertible top comes with a glass rear window with a defogger. A removable hardtop is optional.\n\nInterior\nThe Miata is just 4 feet high, so occupants literally have to drop into the two snug-fitting bucket seats. A simple, functional dashboard places all gauges so they are easy to see and controls are within easy reach.\n\nAn optional Convenience Package includes a windblocker that mounts behind the seats to reduce turbulence.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe only engine for the rear-drive Miata is a 140-horsepower 1.8-liter four-cylinder. Regular models come with a choice of five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmissions, and the Special Edition comes only with a six-speed manual.\n\nPerformance\nThe engine is rather loud, the ride is pretty stiff, and the Miata cant keep pace with more performance-oriented sports cars. However, it is still fun to drive, reasonably priced and designed in classic sports car style. There was nothing else like it when it arrived as a 1990 model. Even with several other roadsters crowding the market, the Miata still stands out as a great value.\n\n \n\nReported by Rick Popely  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2000 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "It’s not every day that people tuck little notes under the windshield wiper of our test-drive cars, asking us to call them for a product chat. But that’s exactly what happened with the 2002 Mazda MX-5 Miata Special Edition.\n\nThe little Japanese roadster tends to evoke emotional responses from drivers, passengers and passers-by.\n\nThe Miata has been around since 1989. The Guinness World Records says it’s the best-selling, two-seat convertible of all time, with more than 250,000 sold in North America alone.\n\nWe are both longtime Miata fans, although the Special Edition’s $27,790 sticker price gave us pause — despite the fact that it came with a gift set that included goodies like a Miata badge and key chain.\n\nShe: If you tried to talk me into a base Miata and argued that the $21,280 price tag was a bargain for all that summertime, top-down fun, I might agree with you. But you’d need a law degree and a lot of confidence to convince me to part with close to $28,000 for a toy that doesn’t want to start easily first thing in the morning, has a teensy trunk and no lighted vanity mirrors.\n\nHe: Come on, when you drop the top and fire up the Miata, who cares about the trunk and whether or not you can check your lipstick in the dark? The Miata still has a charming simplicity that hasn’t worn off after more than a decade.\n\nShe: I thought it was especially charming of you to order me out of the car to put the top up when it started raining today. What was your excuse? That you actually had to put shoes on to go out of the house? I’m guessing Mazda had better think about an automatic top at some time, as sort of a marriage-saving feature.\n\nHe: You’re goofy. The biggest marriage-saver I can think of is you putting the toilet paper on the roll correctly. And don’t tell me you were actually grousing about the top. The Miata may have the nicest convertible top in the business. It literally takes about 10 seconds to put down and another 10 seconds to put back up. I’m sure you barely got wet, dear.\n\nShe: It was the principle of the thing. Have you ever heard of the word chivalry?\n\nHe: Have you ever heard of the words “torsional rigidity”? That’s part of the Miata’s secret. Body and chassis are relatively stiff, so you don’t feel as much vibration and harshness as you would in, say, a Mustang convertible.\n\nIn fact, the Miata is still a joy to drive, even if the design is getting a little dated after all these years. I like the fact that you can still jump in the car, fire up the little twin-cam four-cylinder engine and drive like crazy in what is one of the most nimble and agile roadsters on the market today. Steering is deliciously precise and direct. The Miata goes exactly where you point it, with no fuss or bother. And you don’t have to fiddle with a lot of switches, controls or gauges. No whiz-bang video displays or fancy voice-activation controls on this baby. Just pure and simple driving enjoyment — at a pri ce.\n\nShe: What makes me nervous about the Miata is the same thing that made me nervous about the Mini Cooper. It’s such a tiny little thing, up against all those big SUVs on the road. And unlike the Mini, the Miata doesn’t have side air bags. It also doesn’t have traction control, which means this rear-wheel-drive car could be difficult to maneuver in winter weather. I know some of the thinking is that people who buy a Miata often have other vehicles in their personal fleet. But I worry about the person who wants to use this as their main vehicle year-round.\n\nHe: My only real reservation with the Special Edition is the price. Mazda has offered these packages for years on the Miata, and seems to have no trouble selling them, so you know the audience is out there. But I have to agree with you — for once — that the standard Miata is a much better value, and just about as much fun.\n\nAnita’s rating: (above average)\n\nPaul’s rating: (world class)\n\nLikes: Still evokes lots of response from strangers. It takes less than 10 seconds to drop manual top (Paul). After 13 years, the Miata retains its charming simplicity (Paul). Handles like a dream; few cars are more agile than this. Decent power. 6-speed transmission is lots of fun. Special-edition model has lots of memorable features, including a black-and-brown leather steering wheel, satin finish accents in cabin and a sharp titanium exterior.\n\nDislikes: The base model is a better value for this impractical, summertime ride. Expect husband to order you out of car to put manual top up (Anita). Teensy trunk (Anita). Doesn’t start easily. Anti-lock brakes cost $550 extra. No side air bags or traction control (Anita).No lighted vanity mirrors (Anita). Two so-called cupholders don’t do the job (Anita).\n\nType: Front-engine, rear-wheel drive, two-passenger convertible.\n\nPrice: Base, $25,755; as tested, $27,790 (inc. $520 destination charge).\n\nEngine: 1.8-liter I-4; 142-hp; 125 lb.-ft torque.\n\nEPA fuel economy: 23 mpg city/28 mpg highway.\n\n12-month insurance cost, estimated by AAA Michigan: $1,152 (Rates may be higher or lower, depending on coverage and driving record.)\n\nWhere built: Japan",

      "expert_review": "Turning back the clock in some ways and pushing the needle forward in many others, the redesigned 2016 Mazda MX-5 Miata roadster is the best Miata ever, and one of the most fun, capable cars you can buy, regardless of price.\n\nThe only changes that might turn off some buyers are a slightly smaller trunk and the discontinuation of an optional power-retractable hard top, leaving only the standard manual cloth top. If the “PRHT” will return, Mazda isn’t talking about it.\n\nAs before, the Miata comes in three trim levels: Sport, Club and Grand Touring. The powertrain comprises a single four-cylinder engine and a six-speed manual or automatic transmission. Last year’s five-speed stick is gone. (See the 2015 and 2016 models’ specs side by side here.) I drove Club and Grand Touring versions.\n\nThe Miata has no rivals, mainly because there are no other roadsters available at such a low starting price. The closest is the Nissan 370Z, which starts at $42,645 in roadster form — almost $17,000 more than the Miata’s $25,735 for a Sport model (all prices include destination charges). If you’re looking for an affordable, fun car in the Miata’s league, I recommend the Scion FR-S and its sister, the Subaru BRZ. Though they’re four-seaters and not available as convertibles, their starting prices are within hundreds — not thousands — of the Miata’s, and they share the Mazda’s simplicity and purity. See these models compared side-by-side here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe new Miata is more than an inch shorter from bumper to bumper than the first-generation car, which had been the smallest in the model’s history. A half-inch wider than last year’s model, however, the 2016 is now the widest to date. It also boasts a slightly wider track.\n\nKey to the redesign’s shorter length and small front overhang are standard LED headlights, which Mazda says were the most compact, if not the most affordable, option. They also seem to give the car’s design a touch of wickedness, which it’s always needed but never possessed.\n\nA black front air dam and trunk-lid spoiler distinguish the Club trim level. Alloy wheels start at 16 inches on the Sport and grow to 17 inches for the Club and Grand Touring. The Club’s have a gunmetal finish where the GT’s are bright. The Club’s optional Brembo/BBS Package brings BBS-brand wheels that have a black finish but remain 17 inches. The package also paints the unfinished brake rotors red and adds Brembo front brakes and a subtle body kit with black side sills and a rear bumper skirt.\n\nHow It Drives\nPeople in my line of work have been known to write raves about Mazda MX-5 Miatas, and to purchase them, as I have. To drive a Miata of any generation is to recognize that the fun goes beyond the pleasure many find in a small car and/or a convertible. The Miata has always been about the visceral experience of a simple, front-engine, rear-wheel-drive car with equal (or nearly so) front/rear weight distribution and balance that can carve corners with a degree of controllability that makes sliding about safe in everyday driving. The best sports cars feel like an extension of the driver, and this is where the Miata has shone where some cars — priced two or three times more — have failed.\n\nThe 2016 is unquestionably the best Miata yet. Among countless other changes, the fourth-generation Miata has lost roughly 150 pounds and is now in line with the second generation, reversing one of the transgressions of the third generation (which ran from 2006-2015). Even more impressive, the 2016’s weight rivals that of a first-generation Miata equipped with a 1.8-liter engine. (The only lighter Miata was the original, 1.6-liter version of the first generation model, but the displacement increase of the 1.8 was worth its weight in, well, weight.)\n\nFor 2016, an efficient SkyActiv 2.0-liter four-cylinder replaces the earlier 2.0-liter, but Mazda has lowered it about a half inch — which lowers the car’s center of gravity — and moved it almost an inch rearward, which shifts more of its mass behind the front axle, where you want it. The more-centered mass lowers the car’s polar moment of inertia, meaning it requires less force to rotate on its axis — to change direction, in essence. The 2016 once again rivals the first generation in this respect.\n\nAll these changes do indeed make the 2016 feel lighter, more grounded and nimble. The 2016 brings the Miata’s first application of electric power steering. Unlike Mazda’s front-drive models, the Miata’s assist motor is on the steering rack rather than the column, which is the only way to get the kind of performance and feel for which hydraulic assist is respected. In the 2016, the new system does the trick, though it’s tuned differently. It’s noticeably comfortable on center and easier to pilot on the highway, a characteristic that drew a complaint of softness from one of our editors. Turn the wheel past center, and there’s nice progressive torque buildup as the steering angle increases. The steering snaps back to center sharply and completely. A couple of us thought feedback could be better, but all told, I’m good with it.\n\nThe car’s overall dynamics have definitely changed. Turn-in feels slower, in part because the outside rear wheel no longer toes out initially before toeing back in under sustained cornering forces. The alignment’s response is more consistent, and, as a result, so is the car’s response when you throw it into a corner. And throw it into a corner you will. The car demands it.\n\nWhat the Miata really needs is a relaxed stability system mode. Even we who went most of our lifetimes without the stability safety net now appreciate a way to tone it down a bit without turning it off entirely.\n\nThe Grand Touring rides very comfortably despite the car’s athletic nature. I didn’t drive one, but the base Sport shares the same suspension and should ride similarly. The middle trim level, Club, has a sport suspension with Bilstein shock absorbers and a limited-slip differential that’s also comfortable considering what it delivers: a more direct, connected feel and less — but still present — body roll, by design. The Club also adds a front shock-tower brace but sacrifices all these mechanical upgrades if you choose the optional automatic transmission.\n\nThe Club’s optional Brembo/BBS Package replaces the stock single-piston front calipers with Brembo-brand brake calipers, which are also single-piston. They provide a stronger bite and better pedal feel, but the stock brakes are nice and linear and didn’t leave me wanting in street driving.\n\nWith 155 horsepower, the new engine has 12 hp less than the 2015 but 8 pounds-feet more torque; the 2016 Miata has a peak of 148 pounds-feet of torque at 4,600 rpm. With the weight loss, the car feels a bit quicker — certainly quick enough. Our friends at “MotorWeek” clocked a zero-to-60 mph time of 6.8 seconds on a slick track, and word on the street is you can get closer to 6 seconds, and rarely take as long as 7, with the standard six-speed manual.\n\nAs always, the shifter is a relatively short thing with short-enough throws and a good feel, but it still doesn’t quite compare to the shifter in the Scion FR-S/Subaru BRZ, which has ruined me for any other shifter. Mazda has changed the gear ratios across the board, but everything still feels exactly right. The engine has a nice, broad torque curve that allows it to climb modest inclines in high gears at low rpm.\n\nEven the six-speed automatic is well-executed. It taps into the power nicely, doesn’t dally on kickdown and adds a Sport mode that would be pointless with the stick. If you can’t wrap your mind around pushing the stick forward to downshift when in manual mode, you can rely instead on the steering wheel’s shift paddles — which, incidentally, allow 2nd-gear acceleration from a stop. It’s all good for what it is, but if you don’t get the manual, you’re sorta missing the point here.\n\nDespite quicker sprints, the 2016’s mileage is up 25 to 30 percent overall versus the 2015 at an EPA-estimated 27/34/30 mpg city/highway/combined with the six-speed manual and 27/36/30 mpg with the automatic. At their best, the FR-S and 370Z trail by 2 and 9 mpg combined, respectively.\n\nTo understand how good the Miata has always been, look no further than its modest engine power — or specifically its modest power-to-weight ratio. Would we welcome more power? Certainly. But this degree of fun comes from the entire package. Prodigious power is often a crutch automakers shovel into everything from alleged sports cars to SUVs in order to compensate for other deficiencies. The Miata has more than survived without it. Mazda’s North American representatives are mum on whether more power will become available, but a high-ranking Japanese exec (who won’t get canned for revealing information) reportedly said more power isn’t what the Miata is about. Reading between the lines suggests, at minimum, that more power isn’t currently in development, if it’s a possibility at all. As Mazda’s enigmatic SkyActiv name has come to the fore, the Mazdaspeed designation has tragically waned.\n\nInterior\nIt’s always amusing when automakers redesign their vehicles and openly acknowledge what was wrong with the model being replaced. In the Miata, that includes the fact that the third generation’s pedals weren’t exactly centered in front of the driver, and that one of the folding top’s cross-ribs was directly above the driver’s head, ensuring taller drivers would brain themselves when driving over a bump. Changes to these two anomalies, and many other tweaks in the 2016, make the interior roomier and more comfortable, even though the published dimensions are about the same as the 2015’s.\n\nEven though the roof is 10 millimeters lower, occupants sit 20 millimeters lower, increasing headroom. An additional click in the reclining backrests also helps, as does an aluminum panel that’s been incorporated into the front of the folding top. It helps relocate protruding ribs and diminishes wind buffeting.\n\nOccupants sit 15 millimeters farther inboard, which helps align the driver with the pedals. The change combines with a slight rearward shift of the windshield to improve the driver’s field of view by a claimed 5 degrees. Also note that the hood has been lowered 28 millimeters, so the lower seats don’t sink the occupants into a foxhole.\n\nMazda says some of the space increase comes from having a thinner “net” seat that uses an underlying high-tension cloth mesh in place of springs and foam. (An eventual loss of tension and failed seat seems a reasonable concern, but only time and miles will tell.) The seats got mixed reviews. A couple of our editors said they felt like they were sitting on rather than in the seats and slid around too much. One person wanted a height adjustment, but I was happy with the bottom cushion’s tilt adjustment for thigh support. The Sport and Club have cloth seats and the GT adds leather.\n\nAdditional changes in the 2016 include a smaller steering wheel with a greater tilt angle, both of which improve leg clearance. We think a telescoping adjustment is still called for, too. (Leg clearance remains my primary complaint about my own Miata, a second-generation 2002; its steering wheel doesn’t adjust at all.) At 6 feet tall, I technically fit in my 2002, but I drive with the top up only when I’ve misjudged the weather. I definitely find the 2016 to be more livable than every earlier generation with the top up.\n\nWhile the steering wheel’s size is OK, I wouldn’t mind a thicker rim. And while the passenger enjoys many of the roominess improvements, a substantial hump protrudes from the floor along the center console, and there’s also not quite as much room for leg extension.\n\nOperating the top is simpler than ever, too, thanks to a lighter frame and less friction in the joints. Most impressive is how the stowed top is spring-tensioned to pop up several inches when you pull a handle over your inboard shoulder to raise it to the closed position. This makes it possible to grab it while seated and throw it forward without tearing a rotator cuff or, presumably, bending the backrest frame. (If you’ve ever driven a used roadster with a driver’s seat that angles curiously inward, now you know why.) On the other hand, lowering the top when seated requires a little more contortion than it once did, as you now have to lock it down into its integrated tonneau position.\n\nThough Mazda says it make an effort to quiet the Miata’s interior, especially in the GT, it’s still a soft-top roadster, and there’s no escaping the penetrating noise. One anomaly I found was wind noise on the passenger’s side, especially in crosswinds — a loud whistle with the top up that occurred in three cars: two Clubs and one Grand Touring. Mazda needs to get that fixed, pronto.\n\nThe shifter is right where you want it, and Mazda has relocated the cupholders to behind the center armrest so they don’t interfere. However, note that I saw someone accidentally crush a fast-food cup with his elbow and pop its top off, but that individual is a known spaz. The two cupholders mount into receptacles in the center console and can be removed completely, or one can be relocated to another receptacle on the passenger side of the center console.\n\nThe cupholders may be gone, but a couple of times I inadvertently activated the integrated controller knob/button that takes their place in the higher trim levels.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe Miata’s overall simplicity carries over to its entry-level controls: well-laid-out ventilation and power window, lock and mirror controls, as well as no-nonsense steering-wheel buttons. We haven’t tested the Sport yet, but pictures show a small bin on the center console, where the Mazda Connect controller appears in the Club and GT. Atop the dashboard, the Sport has a control panel with a modest monochrome display and radio buttons where the Mazda Connect 7-inch display would be.\n\nEven in such a small car, this location for controls isn’t the most comfortable to reach, as I learned because the Mazda Connect display functions as a touch-screen when the car is stationary. You’re stuck with the multifunction controller once in motion. It works well enough, though I prefer a touch-screen. Fortunately, more elaborate inputs, such as navigation destinations, happen when stationary. The navigation comes standard in the GT. In the Club, Mazda Connect’s features include SiriusXM satellite radio, HD radio and mobile-device-based internet radio support (Aha, Pandora and Stitcher).\n\nStandard audio features include AM/FM, a CD player, an analog aux-in jack, a USB port, and Bluetooth audio streaming and hands-free telephone connectivity. The Club and GT add a second USB port and a nine-speaker Bose premium audio system that’s impressive.\n\nThe most challenging thing a convertible car’s stereo must do is play loudly enough to overcome the exceptional background noise without distortion. The Bose system does this and also provides good clarity, range and dynamics. The return of accent speakers to inside the head restraints is sure to excite some people, but far more important is the latest version of Bose AudioPilot that adjusts the sound’s level and equalization in response to noise. It has a decent range, but I still had to tweak the volume myself after climbing to highway speeds or when coming down to slower city driving.\n\nCargo & Storage\nUnfortunately, the 2016 Miata’s trunk has shrunk by 0.7 cubic foot to 4.6 cubic feet, the smallest since the first generation. However, in practice, it still seems quite usable for the car’s size and is better by almost a half cubic foot than the 370Z roadster. If more space is crucial for you, the FR-S and BRZ are the way to go. They have 6.9 cubic feet to begin with and a folding backseat that takes it to a higher level.\n\nAs expected, the Miata isn’t chock-full of cabin storage provisions. To its credit, though, what’s there is usable. For example, the cubby in front of the shifter is well-sized for a larger smartphone, and the storage bin under the center armrest is narrow but deeper than what I’ve seen in some larger cars, including a few BMWs. Also, the awkwardly located locking compartment behind the occupants’ inboard shoulders is at least reasonably deep.\n\nSafety\nUnfortunately, the Miata hasn’t been crash-tested since the second generation, so its crashworthiness is a mystery. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has no plans to test the 2016 Miata. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s crash-test program has no information on upcoming tests as of publication.\n\nWhile a nimble car with good all-around visibility (at least with the top down) has its advantages, there’s no denying that a smaller, lower-slung vehicle provides less crash protection than a larger, higher-riding one. This is why crash tests are classed based on vehicle weight, and a score in one class doesn’t equal the same score in another.\n\nAs before, the Miata includes front airbags plus side-impact airbags that Mazda says extend high enough to provide head protection. The 2016 brings more safety features than any previous generation, in the form of several active-safety systems Mazda collectively calls i-ActivSense. Standard on the Grand Touring but unavailable on lower trims, the suite includes blind spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, lane departure warning, adaptive headlights, automatic high beams and rain-sensing windshield wipers. Unfortunately, forward-collision warning isn’t offered.\n\nSee all the Miata’s safety features here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe Miata’s price would be justified by its lack of competition and its performance, which comes in its base model. But it also gives you more than that if you want it. In addition to features already mentioned, at its highest base price of $30,885, the GT includes automatic headlights, rain-sensing windshield wipers, automatic climate control, heated seats and an auto-dimming rearview mirror with HomeLink universal remote control, plus a driver’s side auto-dimming side mirror (great for a low-slung car).\n\nOptions at this level are limited to some paint colors, keyless access and the automatic transmission, for a top possible price of $32,390. One factory option you won’t find is all-season or winter tires, so if you foresee driving in cold temperatures or snowy/icy conditions, you’ll have to make your own arrangements. You might opt for all-season tires anyway to provide some of the wonderfully controllable drifting you can do even in normal driving. The 2016 hasn’t become isolationist, like some sporty cars are, so a fun time is still assured. But it’s now a little less flappable — such that the supplied summer performance tires might take the gentle four-wheel drift on your highway off-ramp to the other side of the speed limit, or due caution.\n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in September 2015 about the 2016 MX-5 Miata. For 2017, Mazda adds an RF retractable fastback body stule, but little of substance has changed with the soft-top model covered below. To see what’s new for 2017, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nTurning back the clock in some ways and pushing the needle forward in many others, the redesigned 2016 Mazda MX-5 Miata roadster is the best Miata ever, and one of the most fun, capable cars you can buy, regardless of price.\n\nThe only changes that might turn off some buyers are a slightly smaller trunk and the discontinuation of an optional power-retractable hard top, leaving only the standard manual cloth top. If the “PRHT” will return, Mazda isn’t talking about it.\n\nAs before, the Miata comes in three trim levels: Sport, Club and Grand Touring. The powertrain comprises a single four-cylinder engine and a six-speed manual or automatic transmission. Last year’s five-speed stick is gone. (See the 2015 and 2016 models’ specs side by side here.) I drove Club and Grand Touring versions.\n\nThe Miata has no rivals, mainly because there are no other roadsters available at such a low starting price. The closest is the Nissan 370Z, which starts at $42,645 in roadster form — almost $17,000 more than the Miata’s $25,735 for a Sport model (all prices include destination charges). If you’re looking for an affordable, fun car in the Miata’s league, I recommend the Scion FR-S and its sister, the Subaru BRZ. Though they’re four-seaters and not available as convertibles, their starting prices are within hundreds — not thousands — of the Miata’s, and they share the Mazda’s simplicity and purity. See these models compared side-by-side here.\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nThe new Miata is more than an inch shorter from bumper to bumper than the first-generation car, which had been the smallest in the model’s history. A half-inch wider than last year’s model, however, the 2016 is now the widest to date. It also boasts a slightly wider track.\n\nKey to the redesign’s shorter length and small front overhang are standard LED headlights, which Mazda says were the most compact, if not the most affordable, option. They also seem to give the car’s design a touch of wickedness, which it’s always needed but never possessed.\n\nA black front air dam and trunk-lid spoiler distinguish the Club trim level. Alloy wheels start at 16 inches on the Sport and grow to 17 inches for the Club and Grand Touring. The Club’s have a gunmetal finish where the GT’s are bright. The Club’s optional Brembo/BBS Package brings BBS-brand wheels that have a black finish but remain 17 inches. The package also paints the unfinished brake rotors red and adds Brembo front brakes and a subtle body kit with black side sills and a rear bumper skirt.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nPeople in my line of work have been known to write raves about Mazda MX-5 Miatas, and to purchase them, as I have. To drive a Miata of any generation is to recognize that the fun goes beyond the pleasure many find in a small car and/or a convertible. The Miata has always been about the visceral experience of a simple, front-engine, rear-wheel-drive car with equal (or nearly so) front/rear weight distribution and balance that can carve corners with a degree of controllability that makes sliding about safe in everyday driving. The best sports cars feel like an extension of the driver, and this is where the Miata has shone where some cars — priced two or three times more — have failed.\n\nThe 2016 is unquestionably the best Miata yet. Among countless other changes, the fourth-generation Miata has lost roughly 150 pounds and is now in line with the second generation, reversing one of the transgressions of the third generation (which ran from 2006-2015). Even more impressive, the 2016’s weight rivals that of a first-generation Miata equipped with a 1.8-liter engine. (The only lighter Miata was the original, 1.6-liter version of the first generation model, but the displacement increase of the 1.8 was worth its weight in, well, weight.)\n\nFor 2016, an efficient SkyActiv 2.0-liter four-cylinder replaces the earlier 2.0-liter, but Mazda has lowered it about a half inch — which lowers the car’s center of gravity — and moved it almost an inch rearward, which shifts more of its mass behind the front axle, where you want it. The more-centered mass lowers the car’s polar moment of inertia, meaning it requires less force to rotate on its axis — to change direction, in essence. The 2016 once again rivals the first generation in this respect.\n\nAll these changes do indeed make the 2016 feel lighter, more grounded and nimble. The 2016 brings the Miata’s first application of electric power steering. Unlike Mazda’s front-drive models, the Miata’s assist motor is on the steering rack rather than the column, which is the only way to get the kind of performance and feel for which hydraulic assist is respected. In the 2016, the new system does the trick, though it’s tuned differently. It’s noticeably comfortable on center and easier to pilot on the highway, a characteristic that drew a complaint of softness from one of our editors. Turn the wheel past center, and there’s nice progressive torque buildup as the steering angle increases. The steering snaps back to center sharply and completely. A couple of us thought feedback could be better, but all told, I’m good with it.\n\nThe car’s overall dynamics have definitely changed. Turn-in feels slower, in part because the outside rear wheel no longer toes out initially before toeing back in under sustained cornering forces. The alignment’s response is more consistent, and, as a result, so is the car’s response when you throw it into a corner. And throw it into a corner you will. The car demands it.\n\nWhat the Miata really needs is a relaxed stability system mode. Even we who went most of our lifetimes without the stability safety net now appreciate a way to tone it down a bit without turning it off entirely.\n\nThe Grand Touring rides very comfortably despite the car’s athletic nature. I didn’t drive one, but the base Sport shares the same suspension and should ride similarly. The middle trim level, Club, has a sport suspension with Bilstein shock absorbers and a limited-slip differential that’s also comfortable considering what it delivers: a more direct, connected feel and less — but still present — body roll, by design. The Club also adds a front shock-tower brace but sacrifices all these mechanical upgrades if you choose the optional automatic transmission.\n\nThe Club’s optional Brembo/BBS Package replaces the stock single-piston front calipers with Brembo-brand brake calipers, which are also single-piston. They provide a stronger bite and better pedal feel, but the stock brakes are nice and linear and didn’t leave me wanting in street driving.\n\nWith 155 horsepower, the new engine has 12 hp less than the 2015 but 8 pounds-feet more torque; the 2016 Miata has a peak of 148 pounds-feet of torque at 4,600 rpm. With the weight loss, the car feels a bit quicker — certainly quick enough. Our friends at “MotorWeek” clocked a zero-to-60 mph time of 6.8 seconds on a slick track, and word on the street is you can get closer to 6 seconds, and rarely take as long as 7, with the standard six-speed manual.\n\nAs always, the shifter is a relatively short thing with short-enough throws and a good feel, but it still doesn’t quite compare to the shifter in the Scion FR-S/Subaru BRZ, which has ruined me for any other shifter. Mazda has changed the gear ratios across the board, but everything still feels exactly right. The engine has a nice, broad torque curve that allows it to climb modest inclines in high gears at low rpm.\n\nEven the six-speed automatic is well-executed. It taps into the power nicely, doesn’t dally on kickdown and adds a Sport mode that would be pointless with the stick. If you can’t wrap your mind around pushing the stick forward to downshift when in manual mode, you can rely instead on the steering wheel’s shift paddles — which, incidentally, allow 2nd-gear acceleration from a stop. It’s all good for what it is, but if you don’t get the manual, you’re sorta missing the point here.\n\nDespite quicker sprints, the 2016’s mileage is up 25 to 30 percent overall versus the 2015 at an EPA-estimated 27/34/30 mpg city/highway/combined with the six-speed manual and 27/36/30 mpg with the automatic. At their best, the FR-S and 370Z trail by 2 and 9 mpg combined, respectively.\n\nTo understand how good the Miata has always been, look no further than its modest engine power — or specifically its modest power-to-weight ratio. Would we welcome more power? Certainly. But this degree of fun comes from the entire package. Prodigious power is often a crutch automakers shovel into everything from alleged sports cars to SUVs in order to compensate for other deficiencies. The Miata has more than survived without it. Mazda’s North American representatives are mum on whether more power will become available, but a high-ranking Japanese exec (who won’t get canned for revealing information) reportedly said more power isn’t what the Miata is about. Reading between the lines suggests, at minimum, that more power isn’t currently in development, if it’s a possibility at all. As Mazda’s enigmatic SkyActiv name has come to the fore, the Mazdaspeed designation has tragically waned.\n\nInterior\n\nIt’s always amusing when automakers redesign their vehicles and openly acknowledge what was wrong with the model being replaced. In the Miata, that includes the fact that the third generation’s pedals weren’t exactly centered in front of the driver, and that one of the folding top’s cross-ribs was directly above the driver’s head, ensuring taller drivers would brain themselves when driving over a bump. Changes to these two anomalies, and many other tweaks in the 2016, make the interior roomier and more comfortable, even though the published dimensions are about the same as the 2015’s.\n\nEven though the roof is 10 millimeters lower, occupants sit 20 millimeters lower, increasing headroom. An additional click in the reclining backrests also helps, as does an aluminum panel that’s been incorporated into the front of the folding top. It helps relocate protruding ribs and diminishes wind buffeting.\n\nOccupants sit 15 millimeters farther inboard, which helps align the driver with the pedals. The change combines with a slight rearward shift of the windshield to improve the driver’s field of view by a claimed 5 degrees. Also note that the hood has been lowered 28 millimeters, so the lower seats don’t sink the occupants into a foxhole.\n\nMazda says some of the space increase comes from having a thinner “net” seat that uses an underlying high-tension cloth mesh in place of springs and foam. (An eventual loss of tension and failed seat seems a reasonable concern, but only time and miles will tell.) The seats got mixed reviews. A couple of our editors said they felt like they were sitting on rather than in the seats and slid around too much. One person wanted a height adjustment, but I was happy with the bottom cushion’s tilt adjustment for thigh support. The Sport and Club have cloth seats and the GT adds leather.\n\nAdditional changes in the 2016 include a smaller steering wheel with a greater tilt angle, both of which improve leg clearance. We think a telescoping adjustment is still called for, too. (Leg clearance remains my primary complaint about my own Miata, a second-generation 2002; its steering wheel doesn’t adjust at all.) At 6 feet tall, I technically fit in my 2002, but I drive with the top up only when I’ve misjudged the weather. I definitely find the 2016 to be more livable than every earlier generation with the top up.\n\nWhile the steering wheel’s size is OK, I wouldn’t mind a thicker rim. And while the passenger enjoys many of the roominess improvements, a substantial hump protrudes from the floor along the center console, and there’s also not quite as much room for leg extension.\n\nOperating the top is simpler than ever, too, thanks to a lighter frame and less friction in the joints. Most impressive is how the stowed top is spring-tensioned to pop up several inches when you pull a handle over your inboard shoulder to raise it to the closed position. This makes it possible to grab it while seated and throw it forward without tearing a rotator cuff or, presumably, bending the backrest frame. (If you’ve ever driven a used roadster with a driver’s seat that angles curiously inward, now you know why.) On the other hand, lowering the top when seated requires a little more contortion than it once did, as you now have to lock it down into its integrated tonneau position.\n\nThough Mazda says it make an effort to quiet the Miata’s interior, especially in the GT, it’s still a soft-top roadster, and there’s no escaping the penetrating noise. One anomaly I found was wind noise on the passenger’s side, especially in crosswinds — a loud whistle with the top up that occurred in three cars: two Clubs and one Grand Touring. Mazda needs to get that fixed, pronto.\n\nThe shifter is right where you want it, and Mazda has relocated the cupholders to behind the center armrest so they don’t interfere. However, note that I saw someone accidentally crush a fast-food cup with his elbow and pop its top off, but that individual is a known spaz. The two cupholders mount into receptacles in the center console and can be removed completely, or one can be relocated to another receptacle on the passenger side of the center console.\n\nThe cupholders may be gone, but a couple of times I inadvertently activated the integrated controller knob/button that takes their place in the higher trim levels.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nThe Miata’s overall simplicity carries over to its entry-level controls: well-laid-out ventilation and power window, lock and mirror controls, as well as no-nonsense steering-wheel buttons. We haven’t tested the Sport yet, but pictures show a small bin on the center console, where the Mazda Connect controller appears in the Club and GT. Atop the dashboard, the Sport has a control panel with a modest monochrome display and radio buttons where the Mazda Connect 7-inch display would be.\n\nEven in such a small car, this location for controls isn’t the most comfortable to reach, as I learned because the Mazda Connect display functions as a touch-screen when the car is stationary. You’re stuck with the multifunction controller once in motion. It works well enough, though I prefer a touch-screen. Fortunately, more elaborate inputs, such as navigation destinations, happen when stationary. The navigation comes standard in the GT. In the Club, Mazda Connect’s features include SiriusXM satellite radio, HD radio and mobile-device-based internet radio support (Aha, Pandora and Stitcher).\n\nStandard audio features include AM/FM, a CD player, an analog aux-in jack, a USB port, and Bluetooth audio streaming and hands-free telephone connectivity. The Club and GT add a second USB port and a nine-speaker Bose premium audio system that’s impressive.\n\nThe most challenging thing a convertible car’s stereo must do is play loudly enough to overcome the exceptional background noise without distortion. The Bose system does this and also provides good clarity, range and dynamics. The return of accent speakers to inside the head restraints is sure to excite some people, but far more important is the latest version of Bose AudioPilot that adjusts the sound’s level and equalization in response to noise. It has a decent range, but I still had to tweak the volume myself after climbing to highway speeds or when coming down to slower city driving.\n\nCargo & Storage\n\nUnfortunately, the 2016 Miata’s trunk has shrunk by 0.7 cubic foot to 4.6 cubic feet, the smallest since the first generation. However, in practice, it still seems quite usable for the car’s size and is better by almost a half cubic foot than the 370Z roadster. If more space is crucial for you, the FR-S and BRZ are the way to go. They have 6.9 cubic feet to begin with and a folding backseat that takes it to a higher level.\n\nAs expected, the Miata isn’t chock-full of cabin storage provisions. To its credit, though, what’s there is usable. For example, the cubby in front of the shifter is well-sized for a larger smartphone, and the storage bin under the center armrest is narrow but deeper than what I’ve seen in some larger cars, including a few BMWs. Also, the awkwardly located locking compartment behind the occupants’ inboard shoulders is at least reasonably deep.\n\nSafety\n\nUnfortunately, the Miata hasn’t been crash-tested since the second generation, so its crashworthiness is a mystery. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has no plans to test the 2016 Miata. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s crash-test program has no information on upcoming tests as of publication.\n\nWhile a nimble car with good all-around visibility (at least with the top down) has its advantages, there’s no denying that a smaller, lower-slung vehicle provides less crash protection than a larger, higher-riding one. This is why crash tests are classed based on vehicle weight, and a score in one class doesn’t equal the same score in another.\n\nAs before, the Miata includes front airbags plus side-impact airbags that Mazda says extend high enough to provide head protection. The 2016 brings more safety features than any previous generation, in the form of several active-safety systems Mazda collectively calls i-ActivSense. Standard on the Grand Touring but unavailable on lower trims, the suite includes blind spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, lane departure warning, adaptive headlights, automatic high beams and rain-sensing windshield wipers. Unfortunately, forward-collision warning isn’t offered.\n\nSee all the Miata’s safety features here.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nThe Miata’s price would be justified by its lack of competition and its performance, which comes in its base model. But it also gives you more than that if you want it. In addition to features already mentioned, at its highest base price of $30,885, the GT includes automatic headlights, rain-sensing windshield wipers, automatic climate control, heated seats and an auto-dimming rearview mirror with HomeLink universal remote control, plus a driver’s side auto-dimming side mirror (great for a low-slung car).\n\nOptions at this level are limited to some paint colors, keyless access and the automatic transmission, for a top possible price of $32,390. One factory option you won’t find is all-season or winter tires, so if you foresee driving in cold temperatures or snowy/icy conditions, you’ll have to make your own arrangements. You might opt for all-season tires anyway to provide some of the wonderfully controllable drifting you can do even in normal driving. The 2016 hasn’t become isolationist, like some sporty cars are, so a fun time is still assured. But it’s now a little less flappable — such that the supplied summer performance tires might take the gentle four-wheel drift on your highway off-ramp to the other side of the speed limit, or due caution.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2021 Mazda MX-5 Miata?\n\nThe Mazda MX-5 Miata is powered by a 181-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that works with a standard six-speed manual or optional six-speed automatic transmission. This rear-wheel-drive two-seater comes with a standard manual-folding soft-top, while the nifty but pricey RF model has a power-folding retractable hardtop. The RF gives the Miata the look of a sporty coupe when the top is in place. The MX-5 is built on the same platform as the Fiat 124 Spider, and rivals include the Toyota 86 and Subaru BRZ.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2021 Mazda MX-5 Miata?\n\nThe high-end Grand Touring trim level gains wireless Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity. \n\nWhat Features in the 2021 Mazda MX-5 Miata Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n16-inch black alloy wheels\nLED headlights and taillights\nLeather-wrapped steering wheel\nPush-button start\n7-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nLow-speed automatic emergency braking\nLane departure warning \nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n17-inch BBS forged wheels\nRetractable hardtop\nLimited-slip differential \nBilstein shocks\nBrembo front brakes\nBose premium stereo\nRecaro sport seats\nHeated seats\nLeather-trimmed seats\nNavigation\nAutomatic air conditioning\nShould I Buy the 2021 Mazda MX-5 Miata?\n\nIf you can afford nearly $28,000 for a highly impractical car, go for it. The MX-5 Miata is thrilling to drive and doesn’t demand much financial outlay when it’s time to refuel. Taller car shoppers, take note: The cabin is a tight fit if you’re above-average height. The trunk is also tiny; a pair of soft-sided bags for a weekend getaway will max it out.",

      "expert_review": "The 2001 Mazda Miata, like the original roadster that appeared as a 1990 model, hardly has enough room inside to carry a tune.\n Doesn’t really matter how quick the Miata is when, as has been the case since the day Miata bowed to show up all the   British roadsters ever built, there’s no way to look at an 18-wheeler through your rearview mirror without developing a case of the yipes.\n Sure Miata is a lot of fun when you sneak out to one of those few stretches of deserted country road       untouched by construction barricades, drop the top (manual, no power, so drop it is) and cruise.\n With its Munchkin size, Miata is like playing with a Go-Kart.\n Unfortunately, when you have to share the pavement with 18-wheelers, not to  mention Ford Excursions and Expeditions, you still feel like you are in a Go-Kart–playing tag with those giants and you are “it.”\n Why, oh why, won’t Mazda get with the program and add a few inches in width and length and give the vehicle a      wider stance on the road? In addition to improved cabin room and comfort, you’d enjoy better ride and handling–not to mention security.\n In introducing Miata, Mazda pulled off a coup with a cute and cuddly $13,800 two-seater that was meant to    look like a British roadster but act like a Japanese vehicle. That meant that unlike British roadsters, the Miata was designed to run–well and often.\n Though a hit with 500,000 sales since its introduction, 250,000 of them in the U.S., it’s time Mazda learned a lesson from the Chevrolet Corvette: No pain-no gain makes no sense.\n Cute and cuddly is fine for stuffed animals, but people don’t enjoy being stuffed in the cabin of a two-seat, rear-wheel-drive roadster.\n People also    don’t enjoy looking out the rearview mirror and wondering whether the motorist approaching in an Excursion with one hand on the wheel and the other on a cellphone sees the cute and cuddly car ahead–and below.\n And maybe if the dimensions were    enlarged, there would be room for a tiny side rear window in the wraparound cloth top with a monumental blind spot that keeps you guessing what’s behind not only on the road but also in any parking lot.\n Chevy civilized the ‘Vette and made it     even more enjoyable. Chrysler even added a touch more civility to the Prowler and made it better.\n Mazda?\n It added zoom.\n But even that came up short.\n The 1.8-liter 4-cylinder engine underwent a few upgrades for 2001, such as variable valve timing, so it now produces 142 horsepower, up from 140 last year.\n However, Mazda boasted the 2001 edition would obtain 155 h.p., only to find after dyno testing that it achieved only 142 h.p.\n Mazda says you’ll    still feel more off-the-line kick thanks to a boost in torque, with the 4-cylinder delivering 125 foot-pounds at 5,000 r.p.m., up from 119 foot-pounds at 5,500 r.p.m. in the 2000 version.\n Mazda did the noble thing. It offered those who bou       ght the 2001 two choices–the opportunity to bring it back for a full refund or to keep the vehicle and accept a $500 debit card and the promise of a year’s free vehicle maintenance compliments of the zoom folks.\n Mazda officials said not one     Miata was returned. However, Miata sales are down 8.8 percent in the calendar year, in part because of the disappointment over the power claim and in part a reflection of the fact that unlike in 1990, there now are a host of roadsters in the market that   Miata must compete against–and all are bigger, even if most are more expensive.\n Perhaps now that Ford controls Mazda, a longer and wider, and therefore more stable and roadworthy, Miata will surface.\n Let’s hope, though one Mazda       official said of any plans to bring out a larger Miata: “Those decisions are made in Japan, and there has been no talk in Japan about making Miata any bigger.”\n For years Miata was the only vehicle in the Mazda stable worth checking out. Toda                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     the attraction at Mazda is the Tribute, the compact sport-ute developed with Ford, which calls its version Escape.\n Mazda can’t build enough Tributes to satisfy demand. Can’t say the same is true of Miata.\n Base price of the Miata LS     Special Edition we tested is $25,715.\n Standard equipment includes a 6-speed manual for the first time on the LS; air conditioning; AM/FM Bose audio system with CD; power windows/door locks/mirrors; cruise control; leather seating; glass rear     window with defroster; 16-inch, radial tires; fog lights; dual depowered front air bags with passenger side deactivation switch; four-wheel disc brakes; remote keyless entry; and British racing green exterior finish.\n Changes for 2001 include     white-faced gauges, covered rather than exposed cupholders and power window switches moved to the center console from the door armrest.\n Anti-lock brakes are a must at $550.",

      "expert_review": "It’s totally impractical for families. It makes little sense in snowy climes. For the same money, you could put a down payment on a vacation home in the Ozarks. But there will always be a special place in our garage for the Mazda Miata. We’re just not sure the new M Edition is the right Miata for us.\n\nShe: That’s M for “mega-bucks,” right? The Miata used to be a great car when the base price was only $13,000. It’s still not a bad deal at $18,000. But I find it hard to justify spending $25,000 on a two-seat roadster, even one as pretty as the M Edition.\n\nHe: This is a dangerous precedent, sweetheart. I think we may actually agree on something for a change. When you put the M Edition in context, that is, alongside the $29,000 BMW Z3, it’s just not worth the money.\n\nShe: Don’t put words in my mouth. The basic design of the Miata may be a few years old, but it’s held up well against the competition. And the Z3 is really its first direct rival. I think the Miata has a breezier feel than the BMW, which looks intimidating. The Miata just seems more in keeping with the heritage of those classic British roadsters of the Fifties and Sixties. You know me. I’m the one who’s always careful to use sunscreen, even in April. But I had the top down nearly every day on the Miata. It’s absolutely carefree, where the BMW is so, I don’t know, Germanic.\n\nHe: Gee, don’t you think I’m Germanic and carefree?\n\nShe: And intimidating. Especially on your exercise bike.\n\nHe: Low blow. The Miata is still a terrific car to drive – not overpowering, but not terribly demanding either. It’s still fairly simple to operate, and even the fancy M Edition, with all its extra equipment, doesn’t come with all that many bells and whistles.\n\nShe: The Miata felt more nimble and easier to maneuver than the Z3. I just had a riot driving it. And I loved the dark blue paint – they call it Starlight Mica – with the tan interior. Whoever put that combination together had the eye of a Laura Ashley.\n\nHe: And apparently the same budget. It’s great to have stuff like leather upholstery, air conditioning, a CD player and full power accessories, but it seems kind of like that’s going against the minimalist spirit of the original Miata. And I’m not sure I want to spend another $6,000 to get all those extras on the M Edition.\n\nShe: Not when you consider how good the regular Miata is. It’s not very practical; you’re not going to squeeze much more than a few bags of groceries into that tiny trunk. And I wouldn’t want to drive down to my sister’s place in West Virginia in a Miata. It’s lots of fun, though, for bopping around town and weekend cruising.\n\nHe: Mazda clearly has put some thought into the mechanics. On the M Edition, you get such performance goodies as four-wheel power disc brakes, gas-pressurized shocks, power rack-and-pinion steering and 195/50R-15 performance radial tires on 15-inch alloy wheels. There’s also a Torsen limited-slip differential, which helps the rear-wheel drive negotiate slick pavement, and neat driver-oriented gear like full analog gauges, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and a Nardi wood shift knob.\n\nShe: One small complaint. It was a nice touch on Mazda’s part to add the wooden shift knob and hand brake lever on the M Edition. It would have been even nicer if they’d matched the wood on both.\n\nHe: That does seem funny on a special edition that’s essentially a tarted-up version of the real thing. Nor does the M Edition do much to address the Miata’s shortcomings, including its limited cargo capacity and unsuitability for winter driving.\n\nShe: It reminds me of those cute high-heeled tennis shoes I’ve been seeing all summer. I can’t see anybody slogging through the slush this winter in those shoes. The Miata is kind of the same principle – strictly a novelty, a second or third vehicle that will spend a lot of time in the garage. I’d be terrified to be stuck in that car in a blir .\n\nHe: I’m guessing that if you have young kids, or even kids in college, the M Edition will be hard to justify to your spouse or partner.\n\nShe: It’s a total indulgence. If you can afford to spend $4,000 on a week at a fancy spa, I suppose it would be no problem. But unless you have that kind of money to burn, $25,000 is just too much to pay for the M Edition.\n\n1996 Mazda Miata M Edition\n\nType: Front-engine, rear-wheel drive, two-passenger roadster.\n\nPrice: Base, $24,760; as tested, $25,210 (inc. $450 destination charge).\n\nWhat’s new for ’96: New limited-edition model for ’96.\n\nStandard equipment: Leather bucket seats, center console with lockable storage compartment, tinted glass, 195/50R-15 performance radial tires, four-wheel power disc brakes, gas-pressurized shocks, air conditioning, Torsen limited-slip differential, leather-wrapped steering wheel, Nardi wood shift knob, Starlight Mica paint, premium sound system with CD player, keyless entry/alarm, sport gauges, power windows, power steering, power mirrors, power antenna, cruise control, alloy wheels, headrest speakers, M Edition logos and badges.\n\nSafety features: Dual front air bags, antilock brakes.\n\nOptions on test vehicle: None.\n\nEPA fuel economy: 23 mpg city/29 mpg highway.\n\nEngine: 1.8-liter I-4; 133-hp at 6500 rpm; 114 lb-ft torque at 5500 rpm.\n\nTransmission: Five-speed manual.\n\nCompetitors: BMW Z3.\n\nSpecifications: Wheelbase, 89.2 inches; overall length, 155.4 inches; curb weight, 2293 pounds; legroom, 42.7 inches; headroom, 37.1 inches; shoulder room, 50.4 inches.\n\n12-month insurance cost, according to AAA Michigan*: $978\n\n* Rates based on an average family of four from the Livonia area whose primary driver is aged 40 with no tickets who drives 3-10 miles each way to work. Rates reflect multicar discount and, where appropriate, discounts for air bags and seat belts.\n\nWhere built: Hiroshima, Japan.",

      "expert_review": "In 1989 Mazda set the automotive world on its ear when it unveiled the Miata, a tiny two-seat throwback that brought back the look of the little British roadster.\n\nMiata did what the British cars had difficulty doing well or often: it ran.\n\nMiata brought fun back to motoring. Hop in, slip the top down and rumble away from the light, with an emphasis on rumble because the exhaust was tuned to sound just like those Brit roadsters.\n\nIt was small, inside and out, but it was a toy that made folks sit up and take notice of a car company known for rotary engines that went hum-m-m and consumers who looked at its cars and went ho-hum.\n\nMiata became the rage. Others tried to copy it, and they failed miserably. The rule in the auto industry is that if you aren’t first with a product, you better be the best when you build your clone. The competition is finding that out in trying to imitate the Chrysler mini-van, for example.\n\nNo one came close to Miata, but, alas, Mazda has fallen on some tough times. Miata got people into the showrooms but lately there hasn’t been a lot for them to see there. Some good cars, to be sure-suc has the Millenia and 929 sedans-but high-price luxury Japanese sedans, at a time when Toyota’s Lexus division and Nissan’s Infiniti, have even better offerings.\n\nStill, though Mazda has been neglected over the years and Miata doesn’t command the attention it once did, we had the opportunity to test drive the newest offering, the 1995 1/2 M special edition, and found that the machine quickly gets the juices flowing and revives the spirit of top-down adventure.\n\nIt’s small, it’s a tad cramped, but it’s fun. Snap the two fasteners holding the vinyl top in place and let the arm swing up and over your head so the top lands in its resting place, and off you go.\n\nWe found in the recent heat wave, however, that top-down motoring has a few drawbacks,such as the need to keep the top down, but the air conditioning on full blast in order to keep the lower extremities cool while the dome is baking. (But if you want ideal driving conditions, you never opt for a convertible. Best time to drive one is just after the sun has set or early to mid-fall when instead of top down/air on, you switch to top down/heat on.)\n\nPerhaps the biggest drawback to the Miata is the fact it is so small-only an 89-inch wheelbase and 155-inch length. Today’s consumer is very safety conscious and though the Miata is a kick on the back roads and out-of-the-mainstream trails, you can easily become intimidated on the expressway or interstate when the 18-wheelers start stalking.\n\nDual air bags are standard, which helps relieve some freeway anxiety. ABS is standard in the M edition (a $900 option in other Miatas), which helps, too. Still, when push comes to shove, the Miata would be the one pushed or shoved on the roadway.\n\nThe Miata is powered by a 1.8-liter, 128-horsepower, 16-valve, 4-cylinder engine. As has been true since the days of the original Miata, today’s car featues exhaust rumble sound effects that make you feel as if you are accelerating much quicker than you are.\n\nThere’s enough oomph to keep you interested, but the 1.8 is built to bluff you into thinking the horses are stallions instead of ponies. The fuel economy rating is the clue as to how muscular the 1.8-liter is-23 miles per gallon city/29 m.p.g. highway.\n\nRide and handling are pleasant. Despite the short wheelbase, road harshness is minimal. You can still play in the corners-downshift/upshift-but you might want to back off the pedal a bit in a sharply winding turn to ensure optimum road grip. Though the M-edition comes with the larger, more sure-footed 15-inch tires, Miata is meant to cruise rather than carouse.\n\nThe 5-speed manual is a fairly smooth, short-throw unit. If you opt to drive aggressiv ely, you’ll downshift/upshift a lot to get as much power as you can out of the 1.8-liter 4. A 4-speed automatic is optional at $850.\n\nThe manually operated top is easy to slip down/put up, but the rear window is plastic and tends to show fold marks after just a few trips to its compartment. Glass would solve that problem. One annoyance, the top provides a bit of a blind spot-oddly enough more so on the driver’s side when backing out of a parking spot with the top up than in moving back into the right lane after swinging out to pass.\n\nAs we noted, the vehicle’s small dimensions may have kept some folks out of the showroom. But price also has to be considered a factor. The M edition starts at $23,530, a hefty chunk of change despite all the goodies, such as air conditioning, ABS and power steering/mirrors/windows/antenna plus compact disc player, thrown in this limited-edition model at no charge.\n\nLots of money, but then Miata is unique.\n\n>> 1995 1/2 Mazda Miata M Wheelbase: 89.2 inches Length: 155.4 inches Engine: 1.8-liter, 128-h.p., 16-valve, 4-cylinder Transmission: 5-speed manual EPA mileage: 23 m.p.g. city/29 m.p.g. highway Base price: $23,530. Price as tested: $23,530. Add $440 for freight. M package throws in at no extra charge air conditioning, ABS, 15-inch wheels, limited slip differential, leather interior including wrapped steering wheel, floor mats, carpeting, power windows, power steering, power mirrors, power antenna, cruise control, compact disc player, tan vinyl top and M-edition badging. Pluses: Fun. A cute little top-down toy. Dual air bags and ABS come with the car. Sales a bit soft, and you should expect discounting. Minuses: Little. Semis behind you look like Mt. Everest in flight. Would be nice if it had a glass rear window because the plastic quickly shows fold marks. >>",

      "expert_review": "Here at Cars.com, we do our utmost to give every car a fair shake. But that doesn’t mean that we don’t have favorites or that we don’t get excited about certain vehicles or events. This was one of those times that I found myself positively giddy — a chance to drive the latest version of a car that I adore (and one my family owns) on a road that I try to drive at least once a year as an act of Zen.\n\nRelated: 2019 Mazda MX-5 Miata: 3 Things You Need to Know\n\nThe car in question was the 2019 Mazda MX-5 Miata, which receives its first set of large changes (apart from the introduction of the RF hardtop model) since the fourth, ND generation launched in 2015. There are new standard and available safety features, a new trim level and, most exciting, a bump in power for the four-cylinder engine.\n\nThe road? A segment of U.S. Highway 101 in California that stretched from Pismo Beach up to San Francisco, where I concluded my journey in the shadow of the Golden Gate Bridge. We took our time on the trip to explore not only the highway and its dramatic cliffs, but also a few of the mountain and canyon roads that shoot up from the ocean. This setting (and some agreeable California weather) gave the Miata plenty of room to shine — and that’s exactly what it did. (Per our ethics policy, Cars.com pays for its own lodging and transportation at such automaker-sponsored events.)\n\nWhat’s New\n\nThis MX-5 will continue to be offered in three trim levels for soft-top versions: Sport, Club and Grand Touring. (The RF is still Club- and GT-only.) A quick way to tell the 2019 Miata apart from other model years is a small dimple on the rear bumper for the model’s first-ever backup camera, a standard feature.\n\nWe’ve already published a summary of the pricing and updates for the 2019 Miata’s RF models, which Mazda said will debut first and head to dealerships this month. The changes will later be echoed on the soft-top, the GT trim of which will offer an optional brown roof.\n\nThere is one change I want to single out as a personal highlight: the addition of a telescoping steering wheel. As someone who’s spent a lot of time in older Miatas, this is a real game changer. Believe it or not, this is the first time one has been offered, and it’s overdue — the Miata has always had a good seating position, but finding a way to fit in it comfortably while driving can be challenging, especially for larger folks such as myself.\n\nMazda engineers told us they have resisted adding one because it would require additional bracing to keep the steering column as stiff as they want it to be, which would add weight, a factor they take very seriously on this car. However, after eight “countermeasures” (as they described them) were added to maintain stiffness, we finally get a telescoping wheel at the cost of … not quite half a pound of added weight. It’s a worthy tradeoff to find a more comfortable seating position.\n\nNow, the most exciting set of changes to the Miata for 2019 are found under the hood, and they give the roadster new life.\n\nMore Power, More Fun\n\nUnder the MX-5 Miata’s hood is a 2.0-liter four-cylinder SkyActiv engine that is, in essence, the same engine as last year. What has changed are small tweaks here and there. For example, the pistons are lighter (by 27 grams each) and the shape of their domes has changed to make combustion a bit more efficient. It also has larger valves and ports, a larger throttle body and a high-flow exhaust manifold that allow the engine to take in and spit out more air.\n\nThese modifications help the engine to produce more power, with figures bumped up to 181 horsepower and 151 pounds-feet of torque. That represents gains of 26 horsepower (a 17 percent bump) and 3 pounds-feet of torque compared with 2018’s 155-hp. And the power boost, through some dark magic, also comes with a marginal improvement in fuel economy of 1 mpg combined with the automatic transmission and 1 mpg highway with the manual. While the engine’s output gains may not seem like a big jump, it certainly feels that way given how light the Miata is — just 2,339 pounds for manual versions of the soft top and 2,453 pounds for the manual RF (an 8-pound gain over 2018 models).\n\nThis jump in power is transformative for the Miata in the ideal way — the things that drivers (including myself) love about the car remain intact. It has sublime handling, purposeful dynamics that help you feel everything the car is doing, and it’s still incredibly light on its feet.\n\nBut the added power makes the car punchier. Besides the added horses, Mazda has also retuned the throttle to make it more responsive, and though the engine changes don’t add much more torque, they have shifted that torque downward in the curve. You get more torque from 1,500-2,500 rpm than you did before, and these changes fix a problem: It used to be that in the Miata, any time you ran into an incline, it meant a quick downshift to maintain momentum. But I found that the 2019 version could power through moderate hills in the same gear, no shift needed. It also makes the car feel sharper off the line, especially in city driving. And if you can find an open road, Mazda has bumped the engine’s redline up to 7,500 rpm from 6,800. That lets you wind it up a bit more on straights and enjoy the improved engine note from the modified exhaust.\n\nI drove both a soft-top GT-S convertible and an RF Club during the two-day trip. Both benefit equally from the added power, but my preferred version of the car remains the RF. It looks better, the top keeps the cabin a bit more calm, and the hardtop has the added benefit of stiffening up the rear of the Miata. It feels like it’s more planted and rolls a bit less in corners, making it the more surefooted car even with the added weight. Plus, dropping that roof remains a very neat party trick.\n\nMission Accomplished?\n\nThe 2019 Miata is the best version of the car yet. After I finished up the drive, I ventured home to visit my parents and take our 2001 Miata for a spin. It’s still a wonderful car to drive, but I found myself sorely missing the added performance and convenience features of the new car (especially the steering wheel).\n\nMazda is fond of saying that the Miata’s hallmarks haven’t changed since 1989 when the car debuted: a lightweight, affordable, fun-to-drive roadster. The new car knocks three of those out of the park. It’s still incredibly light, fun to drive and most definitely a roadster. It’s the fourth pillar that I’m starting to have some trouble with.\n\nTake my preferred version of the car, which happened to be the one I tested on the second day of the trip. It was a manual-equipped 2019 Miata RF Club ($33,240 including destination charges) with the new Brembo/BBS/Recaro Package ($4,670) tacked on as well as that very cool Machine Gray Metallic paint job ($300). Those options pushed the as-tested price to $38,210, which would be a stretch to qualify as “affordable.” Lest you think it’s just options bloat, if these price increases stay consistent for the soft-top when its pricing is officially announced, there will be just one way to get a 2019 Miata for under $30,000: a Sport version of the soft-top.\n\nIs the new Miata worth that price tag? Based solely on how it drives, I could argue that it is. The engine changes raise the car another big step on the fun ladder and it was nearly ideal for a trip like this. However, I have to say “nearly” because my drive partner and I couldn’t fit our pair of carry-on sized bags with us for the trip; they had to follow behind us in a Mazda CX-9. Prospective owners must weigh those types of practical considerations.\n\nBut if your goal is to maximize your fun-per-dollar quotient, the 2019 Miata is on the short list. It’s one of the rare cars that can make the simple act of driving transcendent.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Always with the Miata, there was the knee problem. Everything fit in a Miata but my right knee, which seemed to intersect with the console in a manner that I found unacceptable. Several times I’ve been tempted to buy a Miata, and several times, I’ve decided that the knee room was unacceptable.\n\nFunny, isn’t it? Little things can make or break your relationship with an otherwise ideal car.\n\nSo when the all-new 2006 Miata — which Mazda would prefer we call the MX-5, as it does elsewhere in the world — showed up, the first thing tested was right knee room.\n\nBetter. Much better. Due in part to the redesign of the interior, and in part to the extra width of about an inch and a half, my knee decided we could live with this Miata.\n\nIt did not hurt that a great many other things were improved, too. Exterior styling, though still familiar, is fresh and handsome. Two inches extra in length give the car a little more presence and added road stability, though heavy crosswinds and highway speeds will still get your attention.\n\nA gutsy 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine with 170 horsepower — quite similar to engines in other Mazda vehicles — replaces the 1.8-liter, 142-horsepower base engine from last year. That’s with the manual transmission, anyway. With its optional six-speed automatic, which the test car had, horsepower is de-tuned to 166. For a 2,500-pound car, though, it seemed plenty.\n\nOne of the Miata’s best features hasn’t changed: Unfasten a single lever above the rearview mirror, and you can flip the top back with one hand. The top folds into a compact little space, then locks into place. You can raise it with one hand, too. It isn’t power operated, but it doesn’t need to be. This is about as simple and near-perfect as a convertible top gets. Mazda still offers an optional removable hardtop if you really want one.\n\nOn the road, the 2006 Miata seems as nimble and light on its feet as ever. The new engine feels and sounds just right, and fuel mileage — 23 mpg in the city, 30 mpg on the highway — adds to the package, and is actually better than with last year’s smaller, less powerful engine. Although the automatic transmission is fine, the Miata really works best with a manual transmission, which would also save you $1,100 off the test car’s $26,095 sticker. The automatic has a typical console-mounted shifter, but also has big, awkward-looking paddles on the steering wheel that let you shift up or down. Thanks, but no thanks.\n\nThe 2006 Miata starts at $20,995 for a bare-bones Club Sport version, and tops out at $24,995 (including shipping) for the Grand Touring edition, which was the test vehicle. There are two option packages offered for the Grand Touring model, but it already had everything I’d want, including leather upholstery.\n\nThe best buy is the regular MX-5 model at $21,995, which gets you a five-speed manual transmission, a good four-speaker stereo and side air bags. It also adds air conditioning, which is lacking from the Club Sport model. A six-speed manual comes with the Touring, Sport and Grand Touring model, or you can get the automatic.\n\nWith the new 2006 Pontiac Solstice, the Miata finally has some sports-car competition in the low-$20,000 range. As nice as the Solstice is, the Miata has one thing the Pontiac model doesn’t: More than 15 years of proven reliability and customer good will. Mazda has messed with success and succeeded in improving an already delightful car.\n\nP.S.: Thanks for the knee room.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nMazda is the automaker most responsible for the sports-car revolution of the 1990s, and the Miata continues to provide driving entertainment at a moderate price. For 2003, Mazdas rear-wheel-drive two-seat sports car gains newly standard P205/45WR16 tires on aluminum wheels. A new performance package is available for serious racing, but the automaker plans to produce only 50 of these models.\n\nBase and LS editions remain available, and a six-speed-manual transmission may be installed. Miatas could be facing a significant reworking in 2004.\n\nAt the Chicago Auto Show in February 2002, Mazda introduced two limited-production Miatas, the Shinsen and Special Edition. The Shinsen edition (which translates to new and fresh) features Titanium Gray Metallic paint, a dark blue cloth top and matching cloth bucket seats. A Convenience Package that offers tweeter speakers, power door locks, cruise control and remote keyless entry is included. Based on the Miata LS, Mazda’s Special Edition is painted Strato Blue Mica with a gray top and is equipped with gray leather-trimmed seats, a six-speed gearbox, a chrome fuel door and unique 16-inch alloy wheels. Both the Shinsen and Special Edition went on sale in February 2003.\n\nExterior\nLoosely patterned after an older British Lotus Elan two-seater, the Miata body still exhibits an amalgamation of curves that are offset by few straight lines. The manual-folding fabric top has a glass back window with a defogger. The back window can be raised or lowered from the drivers seat without undue twisting. A wind-blocker panel is included. A $1,500 detachable hardtop and a $295 rear spoiler are optional.\n\nThe fully independent suspension includes double wishbones, coil springs and stabilizer bars. Separate suspension packages with Bilstein shock absorbers are available for each model.\n\nInterior\nCloth-upholstered bucket seats hold both occupants. Because its only 4 feet tall to the top of the roof, occupants have to drop down into their snug-fitting seats. The driver faces a simple dashboard, with all of the controls and gauges within easy reach.\n\nStandard equipment includes air conditioning, power windows and mirrors, intermittent wipers, a CD player, power antenna, tachometer, digital clock and theft-deterrent system. The LS version adds leather seating surfaces, cruise control, power door locks, a Torsen limited-slip differential, remote keyless entry and a 200-watt Bose CD stereo system with four speakers.\n\nUnder the Hood\nAll models carry Mazdas 1.8-liter dual-overhead-cam four-cylinder engine with variable valve timing. It develops 142 horsepower and teams with a standard five-speed-manual transmission or an optional four-speed automatic. A six-speed manual is optional on the Miata LS.\n\nSafety\nSide-impact airbags are not available, but antilock brakes are optional on the Miata LS. Dual second-generation front airbags include a key-operated deactivation switch for the passenger side. Miatas have seat belt pretensioners and force limiters.\n\nDriving Impressions\nCreated for fun, the Miata is just as enjoyable to drive today as it was more than a decade ago. The ride can be a bit stiff, which causes the roadster to bounce a bit when traversing rougher pavement, but nothing seems to detract from the enriching sports-car experience. Engine noise is noticeable and performance lags behind some rivals, but the traditional-looking Miata still ranks as the one to beat.\n\nAlthough the snappy-shifting manual gearbox and positive clutch behavior add to the driving pleasure, even a good thing can become tedious in heavy traffic. This roadster is snug inside, and getting into the seat may be a bit of an ordeal if the top is up.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com\nPosted on 3/26/03",

      "expert_review": "The Mazda MX-5 Miata roadster is like a favorite pair of worn jeans; everything just feels right.\n\nFrom the position of the shifter, pedals, steering wheel and other controls, nothing’s out of place.\n\nFew cars offer as much everyday driving fun as the Miata, and even fewer do it as inexpensively.\n\nThe Miata is available with a manual soft-top roof or a power retractable hardtop, and it’s offered in Sport, Touring and Grand Touring trim levels. (See a side-by-side comparison of the trims.) Our test car was a top-of-the-line Grand Touring retractable hardtop with an as-tested price of $31,300.\n\nStyling\n\nBy modern standards, the Miata is a small car, measuring just 13 feet from end to end and standing just 49 inches tall. Its low-slung, athletic shape is appealing, and its proportions are just right. In addition, it looks good whether the top is up or down. Some people might not like its happy-face grille, which is now a staple on Mazda cars, but it works better on the Miata than it does on other models.\n\nEveryday Driving Fun\n\nThe rear-wheel-drive Miata is one of those cars where you don’t have to break any speed limits to have a lot of fun. Driving 55 mph in the Miata is comparable to going 110 mph in, say, a BMW M3 — but if you don’t have a racetrack handy, the M3’s impressive track performance won’t be of much use. The Miata, meanwhile, can make a trip to the grocery store a thrill ride.\n\nIt’s not powered by a particularly strong four-cylinder engine — displacing just 2.0 liters, it’s rated at 167 horsepower with the manual transmission — and it doesn’t sound that great, either, but it’s burdened by just 2,500 pounds of car, give or take, and most trims are available with a spectacular six-speed manual transmission that has some of the shortest gear-shift throws around. There’s nothing tire-smoking about the setup, but the drivetrain is in complete harmony with the chassis, resulting in a car that’s fun to drive. An automatic transmission is optional.\n\nThe Miata doesn’t offer very good noise isolation, however, and that’s partly why it always feels like you’re going faster than you really are. You always hear the four-cylinder engine, and there’s a lot of wind noise at highway speeds — even when the retractable hardtop is up. It’s much louder than you’d think a metal-roof roadster would be.\n\nWith its low curb weight, a small four-cylinder under the hood and a manual transmission, the Miata may seem like it could be an especially efficient sports car. Unfortunately, it’s not as fuel efficient as you’d expect. With the six-speed manual it gets an EPA-estimated 21/28 mpg city/highway, and the city rating improves by 1 mpg with the base five-speed manual. While that’s decent, the 2010 Mini Cooper hatchback, which has a similar curb weight, is rated 28/37 mpg with a manual transmission and delivers the same type of driving fun as the Miata. Like the Mini, the Miata uses more expensive premium gas.\n\nRide & Handling\n\nThe Miata’s low weight delivers ride and handling benefits, however. With less mass to keep in check when cornering, the suspension doesn’t have to be as firm to limit body roll. This helps with ride comfort on bumpy roads; for being a sporty car, the Miata doesn’t punish its passengers with a jarring ride. Our car had the $500 Suspension Package, which includes a sport suspension and a limited-slip differential, and it soaked up bumps well.\n\nThe car’s steering feel is another one of those rare-but-desirable qualities, kind of like the six-speed manual’s movements. With a perfect amount of power assistance, the Miata exhibits sharp steering response and an overall connectedness to the road that perfectly complements the car’s mission. This  car wants to be flung around corners, and it rewards the driver with balanced performance. City drivers will especially appreciate the tight 30.8-foot turning circle.\n\nConvertible Commentary\n\nAs mentioned, our test car had the retractable-hardtop roof, and Mazda’s implementation of this type of roof has a few advantages over those from other manufacturers.\n\nFirst of all, it’s fast; it only takes around 15 seconds to lower the roof. You have to manually release a lever in the center of the windshield frame to release the top, but after that you only have to press a button on the dashboard and it powers down, stowing beneath a hard tonneau cover. Raising the roof takes the same amount of time.\n\nThe hardtop is also compact. When lowered, it fits in the same well as the soft-top behind the seats. With this setup, the top doesn’t intrude on the 5.3-cubic-foot trunk, which is decently large for a car this size.\n\nIt’s pretty breezy in the cabin with the top down, even when driving at city speeds. On the highway, taller people will feel the air buffeting the top of their head and rushing around them.\n\nThe retractable hardtop doesn’t restrict visibility that much when up. Checking your left-side blind spot means leaning forward a little to see around the roof support, but you get a good view when checking the right-side one; the roof pillar isn’t big enough to completely obscure another car.\n\nThe Inside\n\nYou might be surprised at how accommodating the Miata’s two-seat cabin is for taller occupants. I stand 6 feet 1 inch tall and was able to get comfortable in the driver’s seat. Someone even a little bit taller might be able to, as well.\n\nWith the top up, I had a little headroom to spare, but one editor said his hair was constantly brushing against it. There’s also a large hump in the passenger footwell, which will be in the way for some people.\n\nAs you might expect, the interior is short on storage. There’s a modestly sized glove box, a lockable storage bin between the seats and small mesh door pockets.\n\nSafety\n\nStandard safety features include antilock brakes and side-impact airbags. Traction control and an electronic stability system are included in the optional Premium Package, which is available on Grand Touring trims. Many affordable cars, by comparison, now have standard stability systems. For a full list of safety features, check out the Standard Equipment & Specs page.\n\nThe Miata hasn’t been crash-tested by the federal government or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.\n\nMX-5 Miata in the Market\n\nThe Miata is one of those cars that we’re happy to see enter the Cars.com garage and sad to see go because it reminds us how much fun driving can be. The fact that it’s relatively affordable is just another thing in its favor.\n\nNow that the Pontiac Solstice and Saturn Sky have gone the way of their respective brands, the already small pool of small, fun, affordable roadsters has shrunk to one: the Miata. That might be cause for concern under different circumstances, but not in this case: The Miata is that well-executed.\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Mazda MX-5 Miata?\n\nThe 2020 Mazda MX-5 Miata is powered by a 181-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that works with a standard six-speed manual or optional six-speed automatic transmission. The rear-wheel-drive two-seater comes with a standard manual-folding soft-top; a nifty but pricey RF model has a power-folding retractable hardtop. The MX-5 is built on the same platform as the Fiat 124 Spider, and other rivals include the Toyota 86 and Subaru BRZ.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Mazda MX-5 Miata?\n\nNew standard active safety features include low-speed automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning and blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert. The midlevel Club trim now comes with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity, while manual-transmission Grand Touring models now have the limited-slip differential, Bilstein shocks and a front shock tower brace from the Club trim. A gray soft-top and red Nappa leather interior are also available for the Grand Touring. \n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Mazda MX-5 Miata Are Most Important?\n\nThe MX-5 Miata’s most important features are the kind you can’t check off on a list of specs: seductive looks, brisk acceleration, crisp handling, a convertible top that’s easy to fold and raise, and the ability to make you smile every time you get behind the wheel.\n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Mazda MX-5 Miata?\n\nIf you can afford nearly $28,000 for a highly impractical car, go for it. Your reward will be the enjoyment of driving it.",

      "expert_review": "A SPECIAL EDITION OF A SPECIAL CAR — THE FUN-LOVING MAZDA MIATA\n\nThe tenets of most religions include at least two shared and powerful notions: rebirth and revelation.\n\nWelcome to the House of the Two-Seat Sports Coupe, whose flock declined through the 1960s, ’70s and ’80s, but for whom rebirth and revelation came in 1989 at the Chicago Auto Show. For that is when Mazda introduced the Miata, and affordable, two-passenger ragtops became all the rage.\n\nToday, 10 years later, more than 500,000 Miatas have been produced (half of them for the US market), and auto manufacturers in Europe, America, and Japan continue to play catch-up in this nifty little niche market.\n\nThat is because, down the decade, the Miata has proved to be just what its builder promised it would be: affordable, reliable, and, most of all, fun. There are more than 30,000 members of the Miata Club of America. Web sites for Miata enthusiasts abound.\n\nDrive the Miata and you are reaching back in time to the old days of feel-every-bit-of-the-road sports car touring: snapping through corners as you sit low in the seat, upshifting and downshifting to translate power into control and control into power, waving to other top-down enthusiasts as you meet them on the road. It’s like the old days and the best of the MGs — without the shaky wiring of Lucas, Prince of Darkness.\n\nTo commemorate the success of this little sports car, Miata has produced the 1999 Tenth Anniversary Edition, a sapphire blue coupe with a light blue top and blue tonneau cover.\n\nIt is easily recognized by Miata enthusiasts and will stay that way because only 7,500 of them will be produced — 3,000 of which are for US sale. It has a lot of nice little touches that set it apart from the 1999 MX-5, but with the 140-horsepower engine at its heart, it is virtually the same automobile.\n\nThe 1999 body style is more muscular looking than past Miatas. There is a pumped up look to the slightly bulging front fenders — a look that continues back through the door lines, which rise from door to curved rear fenders. The raised lip on the trailing edge of the trunk adds to the look.\n\nWhat the 10th anniversary edition has that the others don’t is a six-speed transmission, a delightful and snappy addition since the car has only 119 lbs./ft. of torque and the extra gears, particularly on the highway, keep it peppy moving through traffic. Fourth, fifth, and sixth, used judiciously while commuting in heavy, fast traffic on Interstate 93, are a useful combo.\n\nOf course, straight-line commuting (with some traffic weave thrown in) is not the aim of most sports car manufacturers. Handling and corners are.\n\nThis special edition is set up as one stiff car for this purpose.\n\nIt has a Torsen limited slip differential, Billstein shocks, a strut tower brace in the front for added stiffness, four-wheel double wishbone suspension, rack-and-pinion steering, and four-wheel disc br akes.\n\nWhat this gives you is a stiff but sure ride.\n\nRip into a corner and you feel its pull in a way you don’t in, say, the BMW M Coupe. That is because nothing is being controlled by computer to make your drive easier. The driver defines the edge in the Miata.\n\nOversteer, understeer, too much gas, too much brake — they are all up to you to fix.\n\nDiscover, midway through the tight curve, that the road is not perfect — a crack here, a bump there — and you get that familiar hop, shake, rattle, or skip you might remember from the old days. It’s up to you to correct for it.\n\nAll of which makes driving this car fun, and you can see why people are so attached to their Miatas.\n\nIn the cockpit, all is simplicity. Five analog gauges are packaged tightly behind the steering wheel. Wipers and lights are on stems jutting from the steering column. Sound system and heat controls are in the center of the dash.\n\nThe special edition features two-tone leather and s de seats, a high performance Bose music system, cruise control, power windows and door locks, power mirrors, and a power antenna.\n\nBecause it’s a collector car, a special badge on the driver’s side front fender gives it a serial number and also its own number among the 7,500 to be built. This car was number 1744.\n\nThese 10th anniversary editions will surely find their place in the loyal congregation that is the cult of Miata, a gathering where Web sites offer essays and odes to the car and fictional goddesses write of their Miata experiences; where kinks and complaints and tips are shared by Miata owners; where debates rage on color, engine power, and Miata etiquette. There is, for instance, a Save the Wave campaign that urges Miata owners to follow two rules when encountering each other on the road: 1. Wave or flash headlights and 2. Smile.\n\nOne of the more interesting debates on the Web is a debate over power. This is, after all, no rip the road, roaring little car. It is adequately powered and fun and that is what it was meant to be.\n\nYet the supercharger and turbocharger backers get their say, as do proponents of a rotary engine for the Miata. One Web poll found 11 percent backing turbo- or superchargers; nearly half supporting more power, but only through normal aspiration. And significantly, a quarter said, “Leave it alone.”\n\n“If you want more power, get a different car,” wrote one respondent.\n\n“ ’99 Mazdas rock, right out of the box,” chimed another.\n\n“It’s not about power; it’s about fun,” concluded a third.\n\nAnd that is a conclusion I agree with. This car was designed to be a bit of a throwback (with modern reliability thrown in) and the manufacturer ought to keep it that way. There are plenty of aftermarket solutions for those who want more kick to their Miata, and any move by the manufacturer to significantly pep up this car would surely result in a much higher cost than the $20,000 base for the regular 1999 Miata. The 10th anniversary edition, for instance, is $8,000 higher than that, and a more powerful engine would not only add to the cost, but so would the costs of the upgraded suspension that would be needed to handle the extra power.\n\nNice touches:\n\n— I’ve never seen a manual convertible top that is so simple (two quick clicks, no pulling and tugging) to put up and down.\n\n— The die-cast model of your special edition Miata, the key ring, and the his-and-hers 10th anniversary Miata Seiko watches that come with this limited edition.\n\nAnnoyances:\n\n— I know it’s limited and will be snapped up by collectors, but $28,000-plus is getting away from the original purpose of the Miata.\n\n— The rattling that the convertible top makes once it is stored behind the rear seats.\n\nSIDEBAR:\n\nThe numbers\n\nBase price: $26,875\n\nPrice as tested: $28,375\n\nHorsepower/Torque: 140 hp/119 lbs.-ft.\n\nWheelbase/Overall length: 89.2 inches/155.3 inches\n\nWidth/Height: 66 inches/48.4 inches\n\nCurb weight: 2,299 lbs.\n\nSeating: 2 passengers\n\nSOURCE: Manufacturer",

      "expert_review": "Look at the 2011 Mazda MX-5 Miata head-on, and the grille and headlights sort of resemble a big grinning face. With good reason: Since it was introduced as a 1990 model, the Miata (Mazda tried to use the global MX-5 name exclusively, but gave up when Americans wouldn’t stop calling it a Miata) has faced down multiple challengers.\n\nAs it did when the car was introduced, the Miata once again has this narrow but lucrative little segment of the market all to itself.\n\nSo what cars have come and gone? Challengers include the Mercury Capri, which was built in Australia but had a Mazda engine. Toyota brought back, and then dropped, the MR-2. General Motors took aim at the Miata with the Pontiac Solstice and Saturn Sky, and came the closest to hitting the mark, but the good-looking cars were rushed into production, and weren’t around long enough to earn the refinement they deserved. Sure, there have been pricier alternatives such as the Porsche Boxster and Lotus Elise, but those are outside the budget of most Miata customers.\n\nIt doesn’t hurt that the Miata has proven to be, from day one, astoundingly reliable. Mazda got the Miata right from the beginning, and unlike most vehicles that have been in production for over 20 years, there are no “bad” Miata models to avoid. You can find a serviceable used one for under $3,000, parts are plentiful and comparatively inexpensive, and Miata owners are among the most helpful there are when it comes to schooling fellow owners.\n\nArguably the most important aspect of all this, to Mazda at least, is how the Miata has gathered loyal customers under the brand’s umbrella. So many of them stick with the brand if they need a four-door, moving to the Mazda3 or Mazda6, or if they need an affordable minivan, the Mazda5. And Mazda has kept its part of the bargain by offering sedans and even minivans that emphasize a fun-to-drive level that exceeds the competition, which appeals to a customer moving over from a Miata. And Mazda’s presence in amateur road racing and autocross is the largest of any manufacturer, and the company supports its racers with incentives, technical help and even prize money.\n\nUnfortunately for Miata customers, the car is no longer cheap, even in its lowest-level model. The base price is $23,110, and with shipping you are still under $24,000, but barely. The good news is even at that price, the base Sport model still has the majority of the bits and pieces that make the Miata what it is; all have the same 2.0-liter, 167-horsepower four-cylinder engine, but the base model has a five-speed manual transmission, instead of the more popular six-speed. That said, the five-speed is rated at 22 mpg city, 28 mpg on the highway, while the six-speed is rated at 21/28. Cheaper, and better mileage? Yeah, the five-speed is fine. A six-speed automatic transmission is offered, but if any car cries out for a manual, it’s the Miata.\n\nThe base model still gets you air conditioning, power windows and a good six-speaker sound system. Not enough? The more deluxe Touring model starts at $25,450, and the top-of-the-line Grand Touring model is $26,710. Our tester was a Grand Touring Miata, and yes, the leather upholstery and Bose sound system were nice, as were the larger 17-inch tires and alloy wheels. But there’s a purity to the Miata that makes the base model attractive – certainly the optional power retractable hardtop is wonderful, but the manual fold-down top is so easy to use that the retractable top is an unnecessary luxury. In fact, take every option, and the Miata’s price rises to almost $34,000, pretty much erasing the “affordable” designation.\n\nInside, the Miata’s instruments and controls are easy to use and the seats are comfortable, but there has never been any argument that space is pretty tight. The trunk is small but useful, something that you couldn’t say about the Solstice, Sky or MR-2. Handling is delightful, but the highway ride, unless you are a true believer, may be too rough and noisy. Certainly the Miata is capable of long-distance traveling, but it isn’t my first choice.\n\nAs a daily commuter, though, the Miata is one of the best friends you can have, especially if you can find a few winding roads on the way home. Your smile is likely to match the one on the Miata’s grille.\n\nSCSmith3@Tribune.com\n\n2011 Mazda MX-5 Miata\n\nBase price: $23,110\n\nPrice as tested: $29,655\n\nEPA-rated mileage: 21 mpg city, 28 mpg highway\n\nEngine: 2.0-liter, 167-horsepower four-cylinder\n\nTransmission: Six-speed manual\n\nLength: 157.3 inches\n\nWheelbase: 91.7 inches\n\nParting shot: The competition keeps setting ’em up, the Mazda keeps knocking them down.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in July 2013 about the 2013 Mazda Miata MX-5. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2014, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nSometimes change is overrated. Take Mazda’s roadster, for example. Aside from a few styling updates, it’s retained the same formula for the past 20-plus years: compact + affordable + uncomplicated = fun.\n\nAlthough the Mazda MX-5 Miata hasn’t changed much since its debut as a 1990 model, it still delivers the joy and excitement of a new toy. As a daily driver, though, it might leave you feeling sore and cramped.\n\nFor 2013, the convertible again comes with a standard manual-folding soft-top and an available power-retractable hardtop. The Club trim is new; it replaces the midlevel Touring model, between the Sport and Grand Touring. All versions also get a lightly restyled front end this year. Compare the 2012 and 2013 models here.\n\nThis tiny, two-seat convertible has few competitors. Based on price, its closest challengers are a bit larger, with room for more passengers; they include the Fiat 500C, the Mini Cooper convertible and the Volkswagen Beetle convertible. Compare all four here. The Nissan 370Z roadster is closer to the Miata in size and mission, but it costs nearly $18,000 more.\n\nFor a photo gallery, click here.\n\nDestination: Who Cares?!\nThere’s something about a convertible that makes bad music bearable and traffic jams almost pleasant. Put the top down and all your cares go out the window — actually, the roof. In fact, top-down is the only way to drive this car. It goes from claustrophobic to carefree in seconds.\n\nSimply put, the Miata is a hoot to drive. The 167-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder isn’t a powerhouse, but it’s only moving around 2,500 pounds, so it eagerly scoots from a stop and is strong and smooth on the highway. The six-speed manual that’s standard in Club and Grand Touring trims has short, precise throws, and the combination provides an engaging drive. A five-speed manual is standard in the base Miata Sport, and a six-speed automatic is optional in all trims. Mazda recommends premium gasoline, and despite its diminutive dimensions, the Miata’s fuel-economy figures aren’t very impressive. Five-speed manual models are EPA rated at 22/28 mpg city/highway, and the six-speed manual and automatic are rated 21/28 mpg. (When you drive with the top down, it’s sure to be lower still.)\n\nManeuverability is the Miata’s strongest point; the rear-wheel-drive roadster is light and lively, with roller-skate-like agility. Flat, controlled cornering makes off-ramps exhilarating, and quick reflexes help it excel at darting though city traffic. Steering is communicative, with a crisp, precise feel that lends a sense of connectedness to the road.\n\nThe Fun Stops Here\nBut the fun doesn’t last forever. For starters, a little too much road comes through in the ride. The car I tested was a new midlevel Club edition, with a sport suspension and 17-inch wheels instead of the standard 16s. Both affect ride comfort. It was on the firm and jittery side; even small bumps induced some choppiness. Elsewhere, the Miata loses some more points in the comfort department. For example, make sure you limber up before climbing in. When the top is up, entering requires a stoop-shuffle maneuver, and once you’re seated several small ergonomic issues combine to foil comfort. The seats are nicely bolstered for a snug fit, but they’re too firm. The steering wheel tilts up and down, but doesn’t telescope.\n\nMore annoying, everything is just out of reach. The mirror-adjustment buttons require an awkward stretch, as does a small storage box behind the driver. Oddly, that’s also where the fuel-door button is. The location of the cupholders is flawed, too. They sit just behind the shifter, so drinks constantly get bumped in manual versions.\n\nThe interior is a study in simplicity, which is both good and bad. If the Miata were a contestant on “The Dating Game,” it wouldn’t be dark and mysterious Bachelor No. 1. Good-looking? Yes. Complicated? No. The climate controls and audio buttons are clear and easy to use, and there aren’t any head-scratching multimedia or navigation systems (one is optional, though). Where simple becomes boring, though, is the décor. There’s too much hard black plastic, and Club versions add a strip of shiny body-colored plastic. Mazda was aiming for sporty with this pop of color, but I’d call it cheesy.\n\nAt 5-foot-5 I was cozy with the top up, but taller editors felt cramped. Top down, the sky’s the limit. One aspect of this car that Mazda did extremely well is the power hardtop. It’s quick and smooth and lowers in about 12 seconds with the push of a button. Buyers agree: Mazda says hardtop models outsell soft-tops by a 4-1 ratio worldwide.\n\nThe top also gets points for not eating into cargo room, which is miniscule to begin with. With 5.3 cubic feet of volume, there’s just enough room for a weekend’s worth of luggage — if you pack light. I also fit a few grocery bags back there, but not a full shopping trip for my family. Comparatively, the VW Beetle convertible (7.1 cubic feet) and Mini Cooper convertible (6.0) offer more, but the Fiat 500C nearly matches the Miata’s capacity with 5.4 cubic feet. Its backseat does fold, though, which increases the volume to 23.4 cubic feet.\n\nFeatures & Price\nExcept for the $20,400 Fiat 500C (the roof of which is more of an accordion panel than a droptop) and the $18,640 Smart ForTwo Cabriolet (don’t get us started on this dud), the MX-5 Miata is the lowest-priced convertible out there. My midlevel Club hardtop model started at $28,465 (all prices include destination charges), but the price of entry is much lower. Base Sport models start at $24,515, though equipment is pretty basic. On manual models, for example, power windows are standard, but power locks are not. Opting for the Sport with the six-speed automatic transmission (an additional $2,260) gets you power locks, cruise control, remote keyless entry and steering-wheel radio controls.\n\nIf you want leather, you’ll have to get a top-of-the-line Grand Touring, which also features automatic climate control, heated seats and a Bose audio system. Bluetooth, satellite radio and keyless start are available in an option package on the Grand Touring.\n\nSafety\nThe Miata hasn’t been crash-tested by either the federal government or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. It has standard front airbags and seat-mounted side-impact airbags. The passenger front airbag can be deactivated to safely accommodate a child in the seat. There’s no top-tether anchor, however, so a forward-facing convertible car seat isn’t safe to use.\n\nThanks to a sizable rear window, visibility straight back is not as bad as in some convertibles with the top up; the view is especially limited in the Beetle, for example. Top down, sight lines to the rear corners are limited because of a windscreen that stretches the space between the head restraints, making it tough to get a clear view of your blind spot. Neither a backup camera nor a blind spot monitoring system is available. Click here for a full list of safety features.\n\nIn the Market\nThere’s a lot to love about the Miata, and apparently a lot of people love it: It was named the best-selling sports car by Guinness World Records in 2011 after breaking 900,000 units in global sales.\n\nAs a daily driver, the car’s ergonomic and space issues would get old fast, but as a weekend toy, the Miata knows how to bring the fun. It’s the type of car you want to take for a drive, regardless of your destination. Toys are supposed to be entertaining, and the Miata is a blast.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Sometimes change is overrated. Take Mazda’s roadster, for example. Aside from a few styling updates, it’s retained the same formula for the past 20-plus years: compact + affordable + uncomplicated = fun.\n\nAlthough the Mazda MX-5 Miata hasn’t changed much since its debut as a 1990 model, it still delivers the joy and excitement of a new toy. As a daily driver, though, it might leave you feeling sore and cramped.\n\nFor 2013, the convertible again comes with a standard manual-folding soft-top and an available power-retractable hardtop. The Club trim is new; it replaces the midlevel Touring model, between the Sport and Grand Touring. All versions also get a lightly restyled front end this year. Compare the 2012 and 2013 models here.\n\nThis tiny, two-seat convertible has few competitors. Based on price, its closest challengers are a bit larger, with room for more passengers; they include the Fiat 500C, the Mini Cooper convertible and the Volkswagen Beetle convertible. Compare all four here. The Nissan 370Z roadster is closer to the Miata in size and mission, but it costs nearly $18,000 more.\n\nFor a photo gallery, click here.\n\nDestination: Who Cares?!\nThere’s something about a convertible that makes bad music bearable and traffic jams almost pleasant. Put the top down and all your cares go out the window — actually, the roof. In fact, top-down is the only way to drive this car. It goes from claustrophobic to carefree in seconds.\n\nSimply put, the Miata is a hoot to drive. The 167-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder isn’t a powerhouse, but it’s only moving around 2,500 pounds, so it eagerly scoots from a stop and is strong and smooth on the highway. The six-speed manual that’s standard in Club and Grand Touring trims has short, precise throws, and the combination provides an engaging drive. A five-speed manual is standard in the base Miata Sport, and a six-speed automatic is optional in all trims. Mazda recommends premium gasoline, and despite its diminutive dimensions, the Miata’s fuel-economy figures aren’t very impressive. Five-speed manual models are EPA rated at 22/28 mpg city/highway, and the six-speed manual and automatic are rated 21/28 mpg. (When you drive with the top down, it’s sure to be lower still.)\n\nManeuverability is the Miata’s strongest point; the rear-wheel-drive roadster is light and lively, with roller-skate-like agility. Flat, controlled cornering makes off-ramps exhilarating, and quick reflexes help it excel at darting though city traffic. Steering is communicative, with a crisp, precise feel that lends a sense of connectedness to the road.\n\nThe Fun Stops Here\nBut the fun doesn’t last forever. For starters, a little too much road comes through in the ride. The car I tested was a new midlevel Club edition, with a sport suspension and 17-inch wheels instead of the standard 16s. Both affect ride comfort. It was on the firm and jittery side; even small bumps induced some choppiness. Elsewhere, the Miata loses some more points in the comfort department. For example, make sure you limber up before climbing in. When the top is up, entering requires a stoop-shuffle maneuver, and once you’re seated several small ergonomic issues combine to foil comfort. The seats are nicely bolstered for a snug fit, but they’re too firm. The steering wheel tilts up and down, but doesn’t telescope.\n\nMore annoying, everything is just out of reach. The mirror-adjustment buttons require an awkward stretch, as does a small storage box behind the driver. Oddly, that’s also where the fuel-door button is. The location of the cupholders is flawed, too. They sit just behind the shifter, so drinks constantly get bumped in manual versions.\n\nThe interior is a study in simplicity, which is both good and bad. If the Miata were a contestant on “The Dating Game,” it wouldn’t be dark and mysterious Bachelor No. 1. Good-looking? Yes. Complicated? No. The climate controls and audio buttons are clear and easy to use, and there aren’t any head-scratching multimedia or navigation systems (one is optional, though). Where simple becomes boring, though, is the décor. There’s too much hard black plastic, and Club versions add a strip of shiny body-colored plastic. Mazda was aiming for sporty with this pop of color, but I’d call it cheesy.\n\nAt 5-foot-5 I was cozy with the top up, but taller editors felt cramped. Top down, the sky’s the limit. One aspect of this car that Mazda did extremely well is the power hardtop. It’s quick and smooth and lowers in about 12 seconds with the push of a button. Buyers agree: Mazda says hardtop models outsell soft-tops by a 4-1 ratio worldwide.\n\nThe top also gets points for not eating into cargo room, which is miniscule to begin with. With 5.3 cubic feet of volume, there’s just enough room for a weekend’s worth of luggage — if you pack light. I also fit a few grocery bags back there, but not a full shopping trip for my family. Comparatively, the VW Beetle convertible (7.1 cubic feet) and Mini Cooper convertible (6.0) offer more, but the Fiat 500C nearly matches the Miata’s capacity with 5.4 cubic feet. Its backseat does fold, though, which increases the volume to 23.4 cubic feet.\n\nFeatures & Price\nExcept for the $20,400 Fiat 500C (the roof of which is more of an accordion panel than a droptop) and the $18,640 Smart ForTwo Cabriolet (don’t get us started on this dud), the MX-5 Miata is the lowest-priced convertible out there. My midlevel Club hardtop model started at $28,465 (all prices include destination charges), but the price of entry is much lower. Base Sport models start at $24,515, though equipment is pretty basic. On manual models, for example, power windows are standard, but power locks are not. Opting for the Sport with the six-speed automatic transmission (an additional $2,260) gets you power locks, cruise control, remote keyless entry and steering-wheel radio controls.\n\nIf you want leather, you’ll have to get a top-of-the-line Grand Touring, which also features automatic climate control, heated seats and a Bose audio system. Bluetooth, satellite radio and keyless start are available in an option package on the Grand Touring.\n\nSafety\nThe Miata hasn’t been crash-tested by either the federal government or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. It has standard front airbags and seat-mounted side-impact airbags. The passenger front airbag can be deactivated to safely accommodate a child in the seat. There’s no top-tether anchor, however, so a forward-facing convertible car seat isn’t safe to use.\n\nThanks to a sizable rear window, visibility straight back is not as bad as in some convertibles with the top up; the view is especially limited in the Beetle, for example. Top down, sight lines to the rear corners are limited because of a windscreen that stretches the space between the head restraints, making it tough to get a clear view of your blind spot. Neither a backup camera nor a blind spot monitoring system is available. Click here for a full list of safety features.\n\nIn the Market\nThere’s a lot to love about the Miata, and apparently a lot of people love it: It was named the best-selling sports car by Guinness World Records in 2011 after breaking 900,000 units in global sales.\n\nAs a daily driver, the car’s ergonomic and space issues would get old fast, but as a weekend toy, the Miata knows how to bring the fun. It’s the type of car you want to take for a drive, regardless of your destination. Toys are supposed to be entertaining, and the Miata is a blast.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Mazda introduced the MX-5 Miata 25 years ago as a throwback to a long line of small roadsters that didn’t offer a ton of power, but thrilled drivers with their handling and top-down fun.\n\nThat philosophy of fun continues, but it is now also a throwback to the time before touch-screens, USB ports and the “car-as-living-room” malaise that has gripped many cars today. In a way, that’s a good thing. In another way, though, it’s a sign that the current Miata has been left behind by the times.\n\nThe 2015 Mazda MX-5 Miata offers superior handling, an easy-to-use convertible top and loads of driving fun, but it needs its imminent 2016 redesign to keep pace with a growing, competitive market.\n\nThat market now includes cars that have been in the class for a while, such as the Volkswagen GTI and Mini Cooper convertibles — and newer entries such as the Subaru BRZ/Scion FR-S twins. Compare them here.\n\nWe tested a 2015 Mazda MX-5 Miata Grand Touring with a power retractable hardtop, six-speed manual transmission and a price of $32,285. Little has changed from the previous year, but you can run through the specs for both model years here.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe Miata is a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive car that offers balanced handling and the rare trait of being fun at both low and high speeds. It’s easy to slide the car’s tail if you punch the throttle or drive like a hooligan, but it’s also capable of keeping traction through high-speed bends.\n\nIn short, it inspires both confidence and a desire to push the car. It’s the best of its competitors; the GTI feels a little too heavy and deliberate to be flung into corners with abandon, the BRZ/FR-S twins are at the opposite end of the spectrum (too squirrely) and the Mini is somewhere in the middle.\n\nNone of the Miata’s competitors offer the same dynamics and sheer thrills that the MX-5 Miata does. The rear-wheel-drive BRZ/FR-S twins are the closest comparison to the Miata, and while they’re fun, they feel like they were designed to slide and drift too easily.\n\nThat’s fun around town and, for a while, on the track, but if I were going for an all-out lap time on a track with fast sweepers, I’d take the confidence the MX-5 Miata inspires. If the BRZ/FR-S is designed to feel lively, the Miata is designed to feel planted.\n\nThe Mini and GTI have front-wheel drive and thus inherently different driving dynamics. The Mini is a peppy, fun-to-drive car, but as a convertible it’s not as rigid or easy to drive, owing to its slightly poorer top-down visibility. And while the GTI model is fast, it feels heavy to me.\n\nThe Miata’s engine and steering work to give you confidence to push the car. Both are direct in their response — that is, a slight move of the gas pedal or steering wheel immediately elicits a response from the car. While engine/steering response should be a defining characteristic of this class, I think the Miata is the best, with the BRZ/FR-S close behind.\n\nThe Miata is not without its faults in the driving department, however.\n\nIts clutch has the trickiest takeup point to master of any of its competitors, and it also requires the most effort to operate. By a lot. The gearshift, while stubby in height and blessed with short throws, did not have the same solid engagement that the rest of the class did, and it required more effort. I always felt like something was grabbing or catching when I shifted gears.\n\nFive years ago, I don’t think the Miata’s gearbox would have stood out as subpar, but the competitors today all do it better. All six of the Miata’s gears are usable; the gearbox doesn’t give you one or two high gears that are suitable only for flat or downhill stretches of road to eke out better mileage. The usable ratios are great for fast driving and help the Miata stand out from today’s crowd of hyper-efficient gearboxes.\n\nAlso, while I don’t consider this a deal-breaker, it must be noted that the Miata is a loud car with the top up. A lot of engine noise makes its way into the cockpit, and the hardtop doesn’t have a lot of insulation, so you hear a lot of noise — especially when rain and sleet bounce off the thing. It sounds the most like a lightweight racecar of any in its class.\n\nMileage for the MX-5 is an EPA-estimated 22/28/25 mpg city/highway/combined for the five-speed manual version, 21/28/23 mpg for the six-speed automatic version and 21/28/24 mpg for the six-speed manual version that we tested. That combined rating compares favorably with the BRZ and GTI, with their combined 25 mpg, but trails the Mini Cooper S convertible, which stretches to 30 mpg combined.\n\nInterior\nThe cabin is the area where the Miata shows not only its age, but also its focus. Our test model — the highest of the three trims offered — featured no touch-screens, no USB dock and no other amenities automakers are starting to include as standard equipment. I mean, the trip computer won’t even show miles-to-empty. It reminds me of a base-model car I owned in the late ’90s.\n\nThere’s nothing in the Miata that’s just a decoration — just a smallish steering wheel, a gearshift, an easy-to-read speedometer, a tachometer and a radio. It says, more than anything else, that this is a driver’s car.\n\nBut taller drivers beware, especially if you carry your height in your torso, as I do: Headroom is cramped. I had the height-adjustable seat set to its lowest setting, yet when I sat up straight my head was pressing firmly against the roof. I slouched for most of my longer drives, which led to back pain. I’m 6-foot-2, but I imagine most folks around 6 feet or taller would have issues, especially when wearing a hat.The front view was also a bit pinched by the rearview mirror, owing to how high my eyes were in the car. I had issues seeing cars merging from my right and found myself ducking my head to look under the mirror when turning.\n\nVisibility over my left shoulder was also a bit compromised by the small side mirror and, when compensating for that, the large rear roof pillar.\n\nNone of the Miata’s competitors offer such compromised visibility, even the low-slung BRZ/FR-S.\n\nBut, of course, the Miata is a convertible. With the top down, many of those visibility problems fade away. In fact, visibility was better than I’ve found it to be in the Mini convertibles I’ve driven. Overall, the Miata excels at top-down driving.\n\nI took the car out on several runs when temperatures were in the mid- to high-40s and was comfortable. A big part of that was the heated seats (standard on our Grand Touring trim but not offered on Sport or Club models). They were the warmest I’ve encountered; I could tolerate them only at 3 in a range that went up to 6. I’m convinced you could use setting 6 to heat up a can of soup.\n\nBuffeting is at a minimum with the top down, too, but if Mazda could just bring back side-vent windows, it would be perfect. I noticed on one of my longer, colder drives that my shoulders were getting chilled, and being able to direct airflow just a bit wider with vent windows would have solved the issue.\n\nThe convertible top bears mentioning for its ease of use. Lowering the power retractable hardtop was as simple as pulling a latch and pressing a button, then letting the motors take over. Raising the top is done by pressing a button then snapping the latch shut. It’s intuitive and works quickly. The easy-to-use latch system also carries over to manual-close soft-top versions.\n\nCargo & Storage\nOne of the nice things about owning a convertible is leaving the top down when the car’s parked, thus Mazda includes lockable storage behind your elbow. It’s not immense, but would hold smartphones, sunglasses and travel mugs. It’s a thoughtful touch.\n\nThe cupholders — if you’re the type to sip while driving — are largely ineffective. The door-mounted cupholders only fit smaller cups or 12-ounce cans. The center cupholders accommodate larger travel mugs, but I found they interfered with shifting. Overall, you’re better off leaving the latte at home and getting your pulse racing by driving.\n\nUnlike some other convertibles, trunk room is not affected when the top is lowered, and there’s no difference in trunk volume between the hardtop and the standard soft-top. I found the trunk space to be more than enough for a weekend trip.\n\nIf numbers are more your thing, the MX-5 Miata has 5.3 cubic feet of trunk space, which compares to the Mini Convertible’s 6.0 cubic feet. However, the Mini — like the GTI and BRZ/FR-S — has folding seats that increase the cargo area a great deal.\n\nSafety\nAs is often the case with sports cars and convertibles, the MX-5 Miata has not been crash-tested by either the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nStandard safety equipment can be reviewed here. Also, if you’re intent on using the MX-5 Miata as a carrier of small children, it’s important to remember that the front seat of any car is not the safest for carrying children of safety- or booster-seat size, even if it has an airbag that won’t activate unless an adult is in the seat.\n\nThe Miata is predicted to have top-notch reliability.\n\nValue in Its Class\nOn price, the Miata remains competitive with its class, and that’s largely true of the car as a whole: It’s competitive and its strength is its performance.\n\nEven though I didn’t fit in the car so well, and even though I had to drive it with the top up more than I would have preferred, I kept looking for excuses to drive this car. I live less than a mile from a grocery store, but there was never a question of walking to the store when I had the Miata. And every one of those grocery trips ended up being a lot more than a mile of driving.\n\nIn relationship to its competitors, it’s as if the other cars are designed to be fun and can go fast, but the Miata feels like it’s designed to go fast and therefore is fun.\n\nYet these same competitors all offer more useful features and interiors that were designed (or redesigned) more recently than the Miata’s. Each also accommodates larger drivers better than the Miata. They’re all easier to live with on a day-to-day basis.\n\nThe Miata is slated for a redesign for the 2016 model year, and I’d say it’s overdue for one. The competition offers cars that are more modern, more accommodating and are almost as fun to drive.\n\nHowever, if Mazda is able to update the Miata’s amenities, make it fit larger drivers better and retain the poise of the current car, the competition will be in serious trouble.\n\nSend Bill an email",

      "expert_review": "The Miata hardtop has arrived.\n\nAnd if you thought the soft-top Miata was a great little car, you’ll probably be thrilled with the hardtop version.\n\nI realize that some convertible fans don’t care for hard tops, believing that only a soft top truly makes a car a convertible.\n\nFor those people, the soft-top version of the Miata is still offered. But for those who want the conveniences that a hard top offers – including more security, a quieter ride with the top up, and better protection from the weather.\n\nOur test vehicle was so quiet with the top up at highway speeds that it wasn’t anything like riding in a ragtop.\n\nMazda completely reworked the Mx-5 Miata for 2006, with a beefier new look. The new model debuted with only the soft top available, but for 2007, the hard top has been added to the model mix., with a base price of $24,945 (including freight) vs. $21,030 for the lowest-priced soft-top model. The hard top is offered only in the top three trim levels, however, so the $24,945 price is for the Sport hardtop model, whose corresponding soft-top version lists for $23,835. That means the hard top costs an additional $1,110.\n\nIt’s worth the money, because other than the conveniences already mentioned, the hard top is power operated, while the soft top has to be manually lowered and raised.\n\nAnother great feature is the way the top folds into the space behind the front seat, rather than taking up space in the trunk. That leaves room for a couple of suitcases or two golf bags in the Miata’s trunk. The new Pontiac and Saturn roadsters have virtually no space in their trunks when their tops are down (neither one offers a hard top, either).\n\nThe hard top also could help the Miata overcome its somewhat undeserved reputation as a woman’s car. Whether the Miata could ever really be considered just a chick car remains a matter for debate.\n\nMore women than men buy the Miata, but men like this car, too. It has always been a good-looking car that is fun to drive, and those are attributes anyone should like. Men who drive them always seem to be having fun, and don’t look embarrassed to be seen driving a Miata.\n\nBesides the roominess in the trunk, the Miata also seems to have a roomier interior. I’m a big guy, and I found the car quite comfortable even on a long drive. I was in a the Pontiac Solstice a few days earlier, and found it to be so cramped that my right leg was hurting just a few minutes into my drive. With the redesign, the Miata – with either soft or hard top — more fun to drive than ever. Throttle response was outstanding in our test car, the hardtop Touring model (base price $26,360 with freight) with the six-speed manual gearbox.\n\nSteering also seemed more crisp than before, and the car had great road-hugging abilities on some fun curvy Hill Country roads. That might have been in part due to the optional sport suspension package ($500) on our car, which included Bilstein shocks and a limited-slip differential.\n\nEven with the top down at highway speeds, the wind in the cockpit is not overwhelming, and I didn’t need to raise the side windows to minimize the air flow.\n\nLowering the hard top down is quick and easy, and can be done while sitting in the driver’s seat. A single lever in the middle unhooks the top from the windshield, and then pushing a switch on the dash lowers the top in about 25 seconds. Another switch beside that one is used to raise it again.\n\nThe soft top, however, has to be raised or lowered manually, although it, too, can be done from the driver’s seat without even unbuckling the seatbelt.\n\nWith the top up, the Miata cools down quickly with its super-cold air conditioning. With the soft top, the cockpit is quite noisy whether the top is up or down, but it’s amazing how quiet the car is with the hard top up. The top also helps give the car more rigidity, so it doesn’t shake when it hits bumps in the road the way the soft-top models do with the top up.\n\nThe cockpit has more room than before, especially for small items and drinks. There are two cupholders in the center console and one each in the doors, a big plus over the Solstice and Saturn Sky. Behind the seats is room for a couple of purses or, in our case, a purse and a camera bag. One of the complaints about the original Miata was that there was so little interior space that if two women were riding in the car, one would have to hold two purses in her lap.\n\nNowhere on this car does the name “Miata” appear. Mazda has said that it was dropping the Miata part of the name with the redesign, calling the new model the MX-5 only. But the manufacturer’s window sticker calls it the “MX-5 Miata,” so the name hasn’t completely disappeared. With the popularity of the Miata in the United States, it’s going to be hard to lose the name.\n\nUpon introduction in 1989, the Miata single-handedly revived the whole affordable-roadster segment, and was seen as a modern, more-reliable replacement for the little British and Italian roadsters of the ’60s and ’70s – such as those from Triumph, Fiat, MG and others. That formula didn’t change with the new generation. The car is even more affordable than ever as the base price has been lowered to $21,030, down from just over $23,000 for the 2005 model.\n\nThis new generation is still instantly recognizable as a Miata, even though no parts carried over from the previous model. Compared with the 2005 model, this third-generation Miata is 1.6 inches longer and wider, and 0.6 inches taller. Wheelbase has increased by 2.6 inches, to 91.7, and overall length is 157.1 inches.\n\nUnder the hood is a new 2.0-liter engine, a version of the powerplant Mazda uses in some of its other vehicles, including the Mazda 3 and Mazda 6 sedans.\n\nHorsepower was boosted to 170, up from 2005’s 142. That is almost as much as the 178 horsepower that was found in the uplevel turbocharged MazdaSpeed Miata for 2005.\n\nA five-speed manual gearbox is standard; and a six-speed manual is used on uplevel models, including our test car, the Touring model. The top trim level is the Grand Touring model, which lists for $26,955 with the manual gearbox and hard top.\n\nA six-speed automatic transmission borrowed from the RX-8 is optional for those who would rather not have to bother with a clutch and manual shift. Still, manual shifting is the best way to go with a car like this, which is meant for people who like to drive, and who like the control that a manual shifter gives the driver.\n\nThe six-speed manual has a short throw, which makes the car easy to shift through all six of those gears.\n\nWith this transmission, our car, with its 12-gallon fuel tank, was EPA rated at 24 miles per gallon in the city and 30 mpg on the highway.\n\nIn the past, the Miata was built mostly of unique components. But to save money, the car now shares components across the Mazda lineup. It is such economies of scale that help an automaker reduce costs on the design, engineering and manufacture of new models.\n\nThe MX-5 is built on the same assembly line in Japan with the more-expensive, rotary-powered RX-8 sports car, but the two vehicles are completely different. The Miata is not a down-sized version of the RX-8. Among the MX-5’s components common among several Mazda models are the antilock brakes, electronic stability control, audio systems, door locks, and some interior parts, the company said.\n\nAmong standard features on our Touring model were 17-inch alloy wheels, four-wheel antilock disc brakes, body-color bumpers, air conditioning, heated leather seats and leather-wrapped steering wheel, power windows/mirrors/door locks, fog lights, an aluminum hood, dual silver exhaust outlets, cruise control, and a Bose audio system with seven speakers. The audio system and cruise control can be operated by switches on the steering wheel.\n\nThe only other option on our tester was a premium package ($1,250), which added keyless entry and start (the driver can keep the key fob in his pocket), xenon headlights, electronic stability and traction control, and an anti-theft alarm.\n\nTotal sticker, including freight and options, was $28,670.\n\nG.

      "expert_review": "If you love the 1997 Mazda Miata – this week’s test car – you better get one now, because the ’98 model that rolls into showrooms in the fall is going to look different from the 1990-97 models.\n\nMazda officials are worried that their small roadster – which they claim triggered the current sports car craze – is in danger of being overshadowed by the BMW Z3, Porsche Boxster, Mercedes-Slk and Plymouth Prowler.\n\nSo Mazda’s designers went back to the drawing board and came up with a new face and some other styling changes for the Miata.\n\nIn my view, this is like putting a mustache on the Mona Lisa.\n\nNo matter what Mazda does to the Miata, there are going to be multitudes of purists who are going to be angry. With the possible exception of the 1970 Datsun 240 Z, no other Japanese automobile has found such an enthusiastic following.\n\nIf fuzzy spy photos and Internet images are correct, the Miata’s classic looks will be gone. The pop-up headlights are out, and the front of the car will sport a protruding beak with headlights built into the shape of the car.\n\nMazda spokesman Fred Aikens in California confirmed that major changes are on the way, but he didn’t offer any specifics.\n\nThe styling change is designed to attract fresh attention to the car and breathe new life into what has become the crown jewel of Mazda’s troubled U.S. operations.\n\nI spent a week with the top-of-the-line 1997 model, the luxuriously appointed M Edition. At nearly $26,000, the Miata M is an expensive small sports car, but it still costs less than the four-cylinder BMW Z3, and I think the Miata is the better of the two.\n\nRegardless of what becomes of the Miata for 1998 and beyond, the first generation models will go down in automotive history as one of the best sports cars of all time.\n\nPERFORMANCE, HANDLING\n\nThe 1997 Miata is powered by a 133-horsepower, double overhead cam, in-line four-cylinder engine that is mated to a five-speed manual transmission. A four-speed automatic is optional for about $1,000, but not many Miatas are sold with the automatic. Most people who buy sports cars, stick with the stick, because it makes the car more fun to drive.\n\nAnd fun -as always – is the word that best defines the Miata. This car is a 2,300-pound bundle of joy. I know of few cars for the same money that are as enjoyable to drive.\n\nThe 1.8-liter engine makes a throaty roar and provides spritely, balanced performance. Acceleration is strong and smooth at all speeds. Although the Miata is not a fast sports car – it’ll hit 60 mph in about 8.7 seconds – it feels reasonably quick because it is light, agile and easy to drive.\n\nI found the transmission a breeze to shift. The clutch is smooth and easy to operate, and the shifter clicks into each gear with a minimum amount of effort. Because the clutch and shifter work so well, the Miata is no problem to drive in heavy traffic.\n\nThe Miata has double wi shbone, independent front and rear suspension, gas-charged shocks and front and rear stabilizer bars. Because the weight is distributed equally between the front and rear, the Miata handles brilliantly.\n\nThe two-seater carves up the curves with verve. With the top down and the engine purring, you feel connected to the road as you slice through holes in traffic and zip around corners.\n\nThe power-assisted rack-and-pinion steering is tight; just a slight movement of the wheel is all it takes to change directions. The Miata can turn a circle in 30 feet, making the car extremely maneuverable in tight spaces.\n\nOur test car came with four-wheel anti-lock disc brakes, which is standard on the M Edition. These excellent brakes are the best I have ever tested on a Miata. They bite hard and stop the car quickly and smoothly.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nHigh quality is one of the major reasons Mazda has sold nearly 400,000 Miatas since 1990. Almost half of all Miatas have b en sold in the United States.\n\nWhile the Miata may be the spiritual successor of the MGs and Triumphs of the ’50s and ’60s, this modern sports car didn’t inherit the oil leaks, cranky engines and unpredictable electrical systems that plagued those old roadsters.\n\nThe Miata has proven to be as reliable, dependable and well-made as just about any other Japanese automobile. Throughout its life, the Miata has earned Consumer Reports highest ratings in nearly every category -an unprecedented feat for a sports car.\n\nOur test car – with its special green paint, tan leather interior, chrome mag wheels and tan top – was a sharp-looking machine.\n\nThe M Edition, which contains just about every item Mazda offers, proved comfortable and civilized in a weeklong, 500-mile test. The only major item not standard on this model is the body-colored hardtop.\n\nOur test car featured power mirrors and windows, air conditioning, cruise control and a superb AM/FM radio with a CD player. The tan leather seats have speakers built into the headrests so that the radio can be heard while the car is traveling quickly with the top down. Nice touch.\n\nThe manual top is easy to raise and lower. When the top and windows are up, the Miata is sealed tightly. You don’t hear any wind noise. During several pounding rainstorms, not one drop of water leaked inside the car.\n\nThere is one item that could stand improvement: the air conditioner. On broiling-hot 97 degree days, the air conditioner struggled to cool the car. The vents are too small, and the fan made a lot of noise on full speed.\n\nAnother thing that will take a bit of getting used to is the lack of space. The Miata can carry about four bags of groceries in the passenger seat and on the floor and some small parcels in the trunk. And that’s about it.\n\nFor most of us, driving is something of a chore. Getting nailed on Interstate 4 everyday on your commute to and from work is not much fun. But if you occasionally love just to get out on the open road and drive, I’m convinced that you can’t have more fun on four wheels for less money than you will with a Miata.\n\nFind a twisty road on a cool evening, put the top down and crank up the radio, and the Miata will make you feel good. It’s times like that when you rediscover the joy of driving, and you feel it’s great to be alive.\n\nSpecifications:\n\n1997 Mazda Miata M Edition\n\nLENGTH Overall 155.4\n\nFRONT COMPARTMENT Headroom 37.1 Legroom 42.7\n\nWARRANTY Three-year, 50,000-mile bumper-to-bumper coverage, five-year unlimited mileage rust protection.\n\nMECHANICAL Drivetrain layout: Front-mounted engine and transmission, rear-wheel drive. Brakes: Power-assisted four-wheel disc with ABS. Engine: 133-horsepower, 1.8-liter,double overhead cam four-cylinder with 16 valves. T ransmission: Five-speed manual.\n\nOTHER MODELS Miata: $19,125.\n\nTruett’s tip: The Miata M Edition is a sharp-looking, comfortable and fun-to-drive luxury version of the world’s best-selling sports car. It’s expensive, but a limited production will make it rare.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe two-seat Mazda MX-5 Miata roadster has been around for more than 20 years. Much has changed over the decades, including the disappearance of the Miata name from the car’s exterior in 2006 as part of a redesign. The Miata name has since returned, but what hasn’t changed is the formula: small, lightweight and affordable.\n\nNew for 2012\nAn electronic stability system is now standard, but there are no other significant changes.\n\nExterior\nExterior features include:\n\n\nManual-folding soft-top\nSmile-shaped grille\nExhaust pipes flush with rear bumper\nStandard 16-inch wheels\nOptional 17-inch wheels\nOptional power-retractable hardtop\nOptional high-intensity-discharge headlights\n\nInterior\nThe MX-5 Miata is small, but the two-seat configuration provides more driver space than expected. Interior features include:\n\n\nStandard air conditioning\nStandard leather-wrapped steering wheel\nStandard cloth upholstery\nOptional leather seats\nOptional heated seats\nOptional steering wheel-mounted cruise and audio controls\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 2.0-liter four-cylinder powers the MX-5 Miata with 158 horsepower when teamed with the optional six-speed automatic transmission. When equipped with the five- or six-speed manual, it produces 167 hp. The difference comes from a higher redline with the manual: 7,200 rpm rather than 6,700 rpm with the automatic. Mechanical features include:\n\n\nRear-wheel drive\nIntake runner tuned to provide a sporty sound\nDual exhausts\n\nSafety\nThe MX-5 Miata has the mandated front airbags, and the passenger’s airbag can be deactivated. Safety features include:\n\n\nStandard side-impact airbags\nStandard antilock disc brakes\nStandard electronic stability system with traction control",

      "expert_review": "If it’s true that the more things change, the more they stay the same, then one might proffer the Mazda Miata as evidence that supports the cliché.\n\nAt first blush, they might be right. And then, again, they’d be wrong.\n\nIt’s still a snappy, true two-seat drop-top decompression machine that often leaves as much of a grin on the faces of those admiring the ride as those behind the wheel.\n\nIt still has a trunk, tall-backed bucket seats, surprisingly good leg room, a spunky little 2.0-liter 167 horsepower I-4 mated to a slick, short-throw stick shift and a rewarding exhaust note that reminds us that having fun behind the wheel can be found at the posted limit, even with nowhere in particular to go.\n\nWhat’s missing from the 20th iteration is the once-trademark pop-up headlights and an offering in British Racing Green with tan seats.\n\nSince it first arrived in 1989, “Rain Man” was popular on the big screen, the Berlin Wall fell, and the love affair with the tiny Japanese roadster debuting at the 1989 Chicago Auto Show set off a demand for black market prices that saw the titillating two-seater producing high profit margins for anyone that could get one. And, this was well before Craig’s List was ever a thought. Buyers paid a premium for this hot car.\n\nThe financial rush has abated, but the love affair with this now iconic roadster has not after 20 years. It’s morphed into a sleeker, swifter two-door fun machine. that since 2007 has been available with a motorized hardtop.\n\nThe power retractable hardtop, which has been available since 2007, performs a mechanical ballet of efficiency in 12 seconds (it seems faster) to raise or lower the roof into the trunk. The soft top needs but one hand to perform the same function. Mazda notes the hardtop takes up no more space in the trunk than the soft top.\n\nOn the outside, there’s a more rounded, sleek appearance meant to create more space around the driver and passenger (that’s where the widest part of the midpoint is), but there’s styling that bespeaks to the car maker’s “zoom-zoom” ad tagline. The front end is a tad angular for muscularity – never before thought of in a Miata. Arched fender front fender wells and HID halogen fogs further dress up the front skirts around the spoked wheels.\n\nLike the 2010 Mazda 3, the large grill opening gives the Miata a smiling appearance as if it were a real-life reproduction from the animated movie, “Cars.” The backside’s contoured as well to boost air flow and appearances.\n\nMazda’s color wheel offers two new exterior colors (Competition Yellow and Liquid Silver Metallic) and interior colors (Dune Beige Leather and Havana Brown Leather).\n\nSlipping into the Miata is easy but if you’re over five-foot-five, you’ll have to duck your head if the top’s not dropped. Seated inside, six-foot passengers remarked about the leg room, headroom (baseball hats are good, cowboy hats bad), and surprising width. Sure, there’s an armrest but that’s a trifling matter. And there’s a console between the two seats (hey, they’re using every inch of space) but it’s the ride that matters and there the Miata is true to its roots again.\n\nChiefly for 2009, Mazda boosted output to 167 hp at 7,000 rpm (previously 166 hp at 6,700 rpm). The torque remains at 140 lb-ft at 4,000 rpm and there’s at least 90 percent of it ready from 2,500 up to the redline of 7,200 rpm. The original motor generated but 114 hp from a 1.6-liter motor.\n\nEquipped with the slick 6-speed manual shifter, you can sling-shot your way down the road via the short-throw shifter. Further, this Miata showed a most elastic power band and forgiving nature if you missed a shift but kept your foot in it. This ability to perform like a sports car with a much higher price tag surprised and amazed all who rode and drove it.\n\nThe first-generation Miata was tuned to render the sound of a 1960’s dual-carb sports car. For 2009, Mazda used an ISE, or Induction Sound Enhancer, a series of pipes and a resonance membrane whereby the sounds are sent to the cowl – in front of the windshield – to provide aural rewards and not over-amped growling.\n\nStill, it’s the ride that’s the thing, and if legend and lore are correct, it’s what sold the first group of Mazda engineers on their purpose and mission to create what some have dubbed the best Japanese-built version of a British sports car.\n\nWith a 50-50 weight ratio, the balance and handling from the Miata is direct, linear, and intuitive. On the open road, the ride is sure. On the corners it’s secure. Point it through a set of twisty back-and-forth curvatures and it’s downright smile-producing fun.\n\nAdding to the fun in the tester was its puny petrol penchant, producing 32.5 mpg from its 12.7-gallon gas tank during my time behind the wheel.\n\nAlso new for 2009 were the inclusion of an auxiliary-audio input jack and a CD player with MP3/WMA playback capability. Touring models got an auto dimming rearview mirror with Homelink, premium finish on the instrument panel, and a trip computer (average fuel economy and ambient temperature displays). Our tester was the $31,010 Grand Touring model, which adds automatic air conditioning, leather-wrapped hand brake, and 5-way adjustable seat heaters. We also had the premium package, which includes Bluetooth, xenon headlamps, keyless ignition, Sirius radio, stability control, and an anti-theft system.\n\nThe Miata, like all Mazdas, comes with a 24/7 roadside assistance and a three-year/36,000-mile warranty as well as a five-year, 60,000-mile powertrain warranty and five-year unlimited mile corrosion warranty.\n\nIn an ever-changing automotive marketplace, it’s nice to know that some things stay the same. The Miata has not compromised its original mission to build a modern sports car that honors yesteryear.",

      "expert_review": "Upon hearing that I was testing a 2008 Mazda MX-5 Miata, my friend Meredith told me her Miata story. When she went to buy her first car after her daughter was born, she settled on a station wagon. After the ink dried on all the paperwork, her husband asked her if she was excited. She said that while she was content with the wagon, there was really a Miata in her soul.\n\nThis wasn’t the only story I heard from people about the deep fulfillment attained from a Miata (from driving it, that is). And I get it – oh, do I get it. On the first sunny day I had with it, I became a confirmed convertible addict. There is nothing in the world that can’t be worked out from inside the cockpit of a Miata. It’s a very small interior; there’s little room to carry your baggage, literal and otherwise. In fact, I was most comfortable ditching my purse and just bringing a small clutch. A diaper bag would have fit in the trunk. OK, fine, I know I’m not kidding anyone.\n\nHonestly, like in any other two-seater, a car seat is not much of an option in this car. Boosters are a stretch; my test Clek booster fit best on the narrow, contoured seats. In case you’re wondering, the Miata has a hard switch to turn off the passenger-side airbag in case the little sensor fails or makes you uneasy. I have to tell you, my daughter has bought into convertible therapy as much as anyone can.\n\nI know you’re not here to learn how a convertible might fit a kid on a day-to-day basis, and I’m not going to do you the disservice of acting like you are. The Miata is nothing more than pure indulgence after a long day. Seriously, if you are looking for a fun second car to calm your stress, this baby will cure what ails you, while carting you to the local burrito joint to pick up dinner. The retractable hardtop is so awesome; it goes up and down so quickly, you can take advantage of even a small errand with the top down.\n\nI really do believe there’s merit to getting a little sun, some wind in your hair and a little car to help you get some perspective. My recommendation is, even if you can’t buy a new one, rent one for a day or evening. Bring your soul out to play in a Miata.\n\n*For more information on the 2008 Mazda MX-5 Miata and its safety features, visit Cars.com.
