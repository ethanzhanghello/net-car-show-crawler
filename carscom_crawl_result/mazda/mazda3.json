      "expert_review": "I suppose in these days of freedom fries and the Boycott France campaign of Bill O’Reilly – about whom there has been much buzzzzz lately – few in the United States would agitate for the return of French-made cars. Quel dommage.\n\nThe French carmakers – PSA Peugeot Citroën (now a single company) and Renault – build some awesome cars. Partisans of the Mitsubishi Evo VIII or Subaru WRX STi ought to take a few laps in a Renault Clio V6, a rally-bred sport compact with a 255-hp V6 mounted amidships, where the back seat ought to be. Then we’ll see who the surrender monkeys are.\n\nI particularly like Renault’s sense of adventure when it comes to styling. Cars such as the Vel Satis, the Scénic and the Mégane – with their strangely indented rear hatches, as if they had been kissed by a speeding lorry – exemplify French style, an attitude of shrugging indifference to convention and easy, sans souci confidence.\n\nSo, no French cars for us. But we’ve got the Mazda3 five-door, which could easily pass for a stable mate to the Mégane Hatch. Like the Renault, the Mazda3 five-door (four doors and a hatch, in case you were wondering) is a style-intensive little wagon with a bold face and its pants hitched up high in the back. It’s got some sharp edges to it, like good cheese: Sill extensions and rear hatch spoiler are standard. Its rivals include cars such as the Pontiac Vibe/Toyota Matrix, the Ford Focus five-door and the new Chevrolet Cobalt. Only the Mazda3 wouldn’t look out of place in a quiet arrondissement in Paris.\n\nAnd like the Mégane Hatch, the Mazda3 five-door handily exceeds expectations for a low-cost urban runabout. Our test car, a Mazda3 S five-door in “Winning Blue” (it looks like LeMans blue to me), carried a price tag of $22,145, which included optional leather seats; navigation system; six-disc in-dash CD player; xenon headlamps; power moonroof; side-impact airbags and curtains; and a tire pressure monitoring system.\n\nStandard on the Mazda3 sedan is a 148-hp, 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine; the 160-hp, 2.3-liter mill, optional on the sedan, is standard on the wagon, shifted through either a five-speed manual or a four-speed automatic. Our five-speed-equipped wagon fended for itself quite well in contentious L.A. traffic – wherein the roulette of merging is less French than Russian – and hummed along effortlessly at freeway speeds. The car returns very decent gas mileage of 25 miles per gallon city, 32 highway, according to the EPA.\n\nMazda’s investment in zoom-zoom – vite vite? – is reflected in the car’s capable multilink rear suspension and stabilizer bars front and rear. For a front-drive car, the Mazda wagon feels surprisingly settled, with very little torque steer feeding back through the electric-assist steering under hard acceleration. The grippy, V-rated tires (205/50R17s) maintain good adhesion, and when you flex the four-wheel disc brakes, the car feels like you have plowed into a field of warm Brie.\n\nThis is a solid-feeling car – taut, quiet and well tempered – a feeling that begins with its thickly padded steering wheel and ends at the car’s hydroelastic body mountings and thick suspension bushings.\n\nOur test car had a rich and interesting inner life. The leather surfaces – the seats, the gearshift knob, the steering wheel (the same as in the Mazda Miata) – offered tactile satisfaction worthy of a car costing $10,000 more. The optional navigation screen, situated centrally on top of the dash, pivoted upward as the car started; the controls, in a panel to the right of the gearshift, included a spin-and-click knob that was reasonably easy to fathom.\n\nAs straightforward as the three-dial climate controls were, just that much more complicated were the audio controls. The volume control is a center-position dial – not, as you might intuit, the left-hand dial in the lower set of two. This takes a day or so to get used to. As you change functions on the stereo, orange-red LEDs race back and forth in a superfluous display that seems to taunt you if you are vainly twisting the wrong dial.\n\nBecause of its rather upright rear-hatch styling, the Mazda3 five-door doesn’t offer quite the cargo capacity of other vehicles in its class – nothing like the PT Cruiser. But once I flipped down the rear seats I was able to put in an 8-foot piece of lumber, several shopping bags from the local man-mall (Home Depot) and two bags of mulch. The hatch itself has a concealed pressure-pad release and rear window defogger and wiper.\n\nWith its Euro-cool design, loads of value and affinity for vitesse, the Mazda3 wagon belongs to a growing class of small suburban wagons that takes the short shrift out of thrift. To that, we should all raise a glass of Burgundy.\n\n*\n\n(BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)\n\n2004 Mazda3 five-door\n\nBase price: $16,895\n\nPrice, as tested: $22,145\n\nPowertrain: all-aluminum 2.3-liter, 16-valve DOHC inline four-cylinder, variable-valve timing, transversely mounted; five-speed manual transmission; front-wheel drive.\n\nHorsepower: 160 at 6,500 rpm\n\nTorque: 150 pound-feet at 4,500 rpm\n\nCurb weight: 2,826 pounds\n\n0-60 mph: about 9 seconds\n\nOverall length: 176.6 inches\n\nWheelbase: 103.9 inches\n\nEPA mileage: 25 miles per gallon city/32 highway\n\nEPA cargo volume with rear seats folded: 31.2 cubic feet\n\nFinal thoughts: Continental riff\n\nAutomotive critic Dan Neil\n\ncan be reached at dan.neil@latimes.com.",

      "expert_review": "Not only does the Mazda3 blur the line between practical transportation and entry-level luxury, but it is reasonably fuel-efficient and is an Insurance Institute for Highway Safety 2025 Top Safety Pick+, the agency’s most prestigious award for occupant protection. With outstanding performance in braking and handling tests and a well-earned reputation for reliability, the 3 is also consistently named one of the best cars for teen drivers by the safety hawks at IIHS and the consumer advocates at Consumer Reports. In fact, two generations of the Mazda3 made the latest such list.\n\nThe current-generation compact sedan and hatchback are getting a little long in the tooth, but with such a strong resume, not much is changing for the 2026 model year. The only updates are the addition of two more speakers in the base sound system and the retirement of the Carbon Turbo trim level. The 2026 Mazda3 starts at $25,785 (all prices include $1,235 destination charge).\n\nRelated: Which New Cars Have Manual Transmissions?\n\nRelease Date and Pricing\n\nThe 2026 Mazda3 hatchback is on sale now, and the sedan will arrive at dealers later this summer. Full line pricing is as follows:\n\nMazda3 Sedan\n2.5 S: $25,785\n2.5 S Select Sport: $26,675\n2.5 S Preferred: $28,325\n2.5 S Carbon Edition: $31,445\n2.5 Turbo Premium Plus: $37,975\nMazda3 Hatchback\n2.5 S: $26,785\n2.5 S Select Sport: $27,975\n2.5 S Preferred: $29,675\n2.5 S Carbon Edition: $33,190\n2.5 S Premium: $32,685\n2.5 Turbo Premium Plus: $39,125\nTrim Levels\n\nWith the exception of the hatchback-only 2.5 S Premium, every Mazda3 trim level is available in both the sedan and hatchback body styles. The two are identically equipped, but the hatch is between $1,000 and $1,745 more expensive, depending on trim level.\n\nThe base 2.5 S rides on 16-inch wheels and features LED exterior lighting, push-button start, keyless entry, eight speakers and an 8.8-inch infotainment screen. Bucking convention, the 3’s system is controlled by a knob rather than touch, but it does include Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Mazda’s i-Activsense safety suite is standard on every 2026 Mazda3 and includes forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, lane-centering steering, lane departure warning, blind spot monitors, rear cross-traffic alert, a driver attention monitor and automatic high beams.\n\nThe 2.5 S Select Sport upgrades to black 18-inch wheels and adds rain-sensing wipers, dual-zone automatic climate control, synthetic leather upholstery and Alexa Built-In for voice control of audio and climate functions.\n\nBuyers who step up to the 2.5 S Preferred get a different finish on their 18-inch wheels, a moonroof, a power-adjustable driver’s seat and heated front seats.\n\nOnly offered in a blue-gray hue Mazda calls Polymetal Gray with a red leather interior and all-wheel drive, the Carbon Edition also features black exterior accents (including the wheels), wireless phone charging, and wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.\n\nAvailable exclusively on the hatchback, the 2.5 S Premium is the only way to get a manual transmission in the Mazda3. It also gets adaptive headlights that turn with the steering wheel, leather upholstery, navigation, a 12-speaker Bose sound system, a head-up display and road-sign recognition.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Mazda3?\n\nThe 2024 Mazda3 is an agile, fun-to-drive five-seat compact car. It’s available in four-door sedan and hatchback form with front- or all-wheel drive (on select trims). A 191-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine paired with a six-speed automatic transmission is standard; a six-speed manual is offered, but only on the front-drive 2.5 S Premium hatchback. An available turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder delivers 227 hp when running on regular gas or 250 hp on premium gas; it’s paired with the automatic transmission and all-wheel drive. Mazda3 rivals include the Honda Civic, Hyundai Elantra, Kia Forte and Toyota Corolla.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Mazda3?\n\nBlind spot warning, rear cross-traffic alert and a rear-seat reminder are now standard on every 2024 Mazda3, and a new 10.25-inch infotainment screen with wireless smartphone connectivity is standard on Turbo models. A new Carbon Turbo trim level joins the range, combining the more potent powertrain with cosmetic touches like Zircon Sand Metallic paint, metallic-black 18-inch alloy wheels and black side mirrors.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Mazda3 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nRain-sensing wipers\n8.8-inch multimedia screen\nVoice commands\nEight-speaker stereo\nLED headlights and taillights\nKeyless entry\nBluetooth\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nAdaptive cruise control\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure steering assist\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nRear-seat alert\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nAll-wheel drive\nMoonroof\nHead-up instrument display\nPaddle shifters\nLeather-trimmed seats\nHeated front seats\nPower-adjustable driver’s seat with memory feature\nDual-zone climate control\nNavigation\nBose premium stereo\nShould I Buy the 2024 Mazda3?\n\nIf you’re looking for a small car with delightfully athletic handling and an upscale ambiance, put the Mazda3 on your shopping list. Keep in mind, though, that the backseat is snug for adults in both body styles, and rear visibility in the hatchback leaves a lot to be desired. Upper trim levels — especially those fitted with the optional turbocharged engine — can get pretty pricey, but they have the look and feel of a true luxury vehicle. Kudos to Mazda, too, for keeping a manual transmission on the option sheet, even if only in one model.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Mazda3?\n\nThe Mazda3 is an agile, fun-to-drive five-seat compact car available in four-door sedan or hatchback form, with front- or all-wheel drive (on select trims). A 191-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine paired with a six-speed automatic transmission is standard; a six-speed manual is offered, but only on the front-drive 2.5 S Premium hatchback. An available turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder delivers 227 hp when running on regular gas or 250 hp on premium gas; it’s paired with the automatic transmission and all-wheel drive. Mazda3 rivals include the Honda Civic, Hyundai Elantra, Kia K4 and Toyota Corolla.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Mazda3?\n\nThe Mazda3’s trim levels are slightly reconfigured for 2025, including a new entry-level trim for the hatchback that drops the five-door model’s base price. Newly available are Alexa Built-in voice control and online navigation with live traffic data and over-the-air updates. \n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Mazda3 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nRain-sensing wipers\n8.8-inch multimedia screen\nVoice commands\nEight-speaker stereo\nLED headlights and taillights\nKeyless entry\nBluetooth\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nAdaptive cruise control\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure steering assist\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nRear seat alert\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nAll-wheel drive\nMoonroof\nHead-up instrument display\nPaddle shifters\nLeather-trimmed seats\nHeated front seats\nPower-adjustable driver’s seat with memory feature\nDual-zone climate control\nNavigation\nBose premium stereo\nShould I Buy the 2025 Mazda3?\n\nIf you’re looking for a small car with delightfully athletic handling and an upscale ambiance, put the Mazda3 on your shopping list. Keep in mind, though, that the backseat is snug for adults in both body styles, and rear visibility in the hatchback leaves a lot to be desired. Upper trim levels — especially those fitted with the optional turbocharged engine — can get pretty pricey, but they have the look and feel of a true luxury-brand vehicle. Kudos to Mazda, too, for keeping a manual transmission on the option sheet, even if only in one variant.",

      "expert_review": "Mazda updated its compact mainstay for 2017 with a few styling tweaks, some interior upgrades and more noise insulation. As before, the Mazda3 comes as a sedan or hatchback with a choice of two engines, each with a manual or automatic transmission. We tested a manual Mazda3 Grand Touring, the highest of three trim levels (Sport, Touring and Grand Touring). Compare them here, or stack up the 2016 and 2017 Mazda 3 here.\n\nExterior and Styling\nHow It Drives\n\nThe Mazda 3’s optional 184-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder moves the sedan from a stop with gratifying lb-ft of torque and smooth, even revving. There’s adequate passing power even with four adults aboard, and the swift throttle response makes for quick rev-matched downshifts. Mazda also offers a 155-hp, 2.0-liter four-cylinder that’s adequate in its own right, and the six-speed manual that’s available with both engines has short throws and clean gates. In an age where manual shifters in compact cars are usually rubbery afterthoughts meant only for a base trim level, it’s nice that Mazda stuck with a good stick — and offers it even in top trims.\n\nA six-speed automatic transmission is optional. We’ve driven it in the current generation; it kicks down smoothly but has tall lower gears, an area where the larger engine’s extra 35 lb-ft of torque adds welcome oomph. Among run-of-the-mill compacts, it’s worth noting that the Chevrolet Cruz, Honda Civic and Volkswagen Jetta offer smaller engines with turbochargers, and the results push the acceleration envelope. The Cruz, for one, feels quicker than any flavor of Mazda3, and most versions get better gas mileage to boot. Consider appropriately.\n\nHandling remains a strong suit, with minimal body roll, quick-ratio steering and limited understeer. Still, many competitors ride better than the Mazda 3. The suspension tackles potholes well enough but makes for a busy highway ride even over relatively good roads. Expect plenty of turbulence on long road trips, with soupy, wander-prone steering at high speeds that never quite settles in. It’s a wearisome trait that some might deem a deal-breaker.\n\nEPA-estimated combined mileage for the Mazda 3 with the 2.5-liter four-cylinder and manual transmission is 29 mpg for the sedan, 28 mpg for the hatchback. The smaller engine and automatic-equipped transmission max out as high as 32 mpg. Those are average figures for the class; if fuel economy is paramount to you, the Honda Civic sedan’s 36 mpg beats all comers.\n\nInterior\n\nThe Mazda3’s straightforward cabin adds a few more storage areas for 2017, plus an electronic parking brake to replace the mechanical one (perhaps to the chagrin of some enthusiasts). There’s also some attractive stitched trim flanking the center console. Cabin materials are competitive overall, with a plusher grade of leather in our test car than is typical in the class. (Cloth upholstery is standard; vinyl and leather are options.) Still, you don’t have to look far to see ill-fitting trim pieces or mismatched materials, and the low-budget headliner needs an upgrade. Some competitors — the Honda Civic and Hyundai Elantra GT come to mind — are a step ahead.\n\nMazda redesigned the steering wheel for 2017; a heated rim is now optional. Still, the optional power driver’s seat has limited sliding range, and it lacks a cushion-tilt adjustment — a curious omission given the previous-generation Mazda3 had one. The backseat has decent headroom, but long-legged adults might find their knees uncomfortably elevated or digging into the front seatbacks (or both). If you need a bigger backseat, try other compact sedans, like the Nissan Sentra, Hyundai Elantra sedan or Volkswagen Jetta.\n\nErgonomics and Electronics\n\nAs affordable compact cars go, the Mazda3 has an exceptional list of standard infotainment features. Among them are a multimedia system with a 7-inch display, a backup camera, HD radio, two USB ports and various internet radio apps, including Pandora, Stitcher and Aha. The Mazda 3 system works through a touchscreen (when stationary) or a knob controller on the center console. Bose premium audio is optional, but Mazda does not offer Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration, a feature available in several competitors.\n\nCargo and Storage\n\nMazda tripled the size of the door pockets, which were tiny before, and added some open storage ahead of the gearshift by ditching the available CD player. Both are welcome improvements, but the sedan’s trunk still measures only a smallish 12.4 cubic feet. The hatchback has 20.2 cubic feet of space, 47.1 cubic feet with the seats folded. That’s a more competitive figure versus other compact hatchbacks, though not directly comparable to the sedan’s 12.4 cubic feet because trunks are measured differently from hatches.\n\nSafety\n\nBoth the hatchback and sedan Mazda 3 notched top scores for crashworthiness and available crash-prevention technology performance from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, putting the Mazda3 ahead of most of its class. Crash-prevention options include forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, plus blind spot monitoring and lane departure warning systems — the latter with steering assist.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nThe Mazda3’s $18,680 starting dealer price is a bit steep for this class, but it comes well-equipped, particularly with multimedia. Climb the trim levels and you can get leather, a power driver’s seat, keyless access, rain-sensing wipers, Bose audio, adaptive cruise control and heated front seats and steering wheel. A loaded Mazda3 5-door Grand Touring hatchback will set you back about $30,000. That’s also at the high end of the class, so expect some sticker shock if you want the extra features.\n\nThe Mazda3 is still a driver’s car, and compact-car shoppers who value practicality over fun-to-drive options should look elsewhere. But the drawbacks are reasonable for those who sign up, and the payoff remains strong.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The redesigned Mazda3 will impress driving enthusiasts, and it improves upon its predecessors in a number of other areas. If I were in the market, it would be high on my list. But these days, my backbone does as much as my right foot to sway my opinion — and I have to concede that Mazda doesn’t have the most comfortable small car out there.\n\nI drove a Mazda3 sedan with an automatic transmission; I’ll offer up a short take on it here. If you’re looking for a more comprehensive review of the car, read our evaluation of the stick-shift hatchback version here; you can also compare the 2010 Mazda3 to the 2009 Mazda3 here. The turbocharged MazdaSpeed3, sold only as a hatchback, is covered separately in the Research section.\n\nMoving Around\nMy test car had the smaller of two available four-cylinder engines; coupled with a five-speed automatic, its power is comparable to a Honda Civic or Kia Forte — and greater than the relatively pokey Toyota Corolla. The automatic’s gear ratios are well spaced for workable 60-to-70 mph spurts, even with two adults onboard, but it sometimes bogs down when kicking down to lower gears.\n\nI found enough power to get around town, but if you’re looking to move away from intersections a bit quicker, consider trading the 148-horsepower four-cylinder for the 167-hp four. It’s optional in the sedan and standard in the hatchback. I’ve driven it, and it packs a gratifying — and palpably stronger — amount of power. Beware, though: You’ll sacrifice 2 – 4 mpg overall, depending on transmission.\n\nMazda3 Engines and Mileage Compared\n \t2.0-liter four-cylinder\t2.5-liter four-cylinder\nAvailability\tStandard on sedan\tOptional on sedan, standard on hatchback\nHorsepower (@ rpm)*\t148 @ 6,500\t167 @ 6,000\nTorque (lbs.-ft. @ rpm)\t135 @ 4,500\t168 @ 4,000\nEPA gas mileage (city/hwy., mpg)\t25/33 (manual); 24/33 (automatic)\t21/29 (manual); 22/29 (automatic)\n* Low-emission PZEV vehicles sold in California and several Northeastern states have 144 hp or 165 hp, respectively. Torque figures are also nominally lower.\nSource: Automaker and EPA; all drivetrains use regular fuel.\n\nSome may find the Mazda3’s steering wheel too stiff to turn easily at low speeds. The handling payoff, however, is dramatic: The steering lightens up when you hit 20 – 30 mph, and you can actually carve corners with this thing. Body roll is well-contained, and the steering wheel exhibits good precision with excellent feedback of the road surfaces. A few competitors — the Mitsubishi Lancer and Volkswagen Jetta come to mind — are similarly fun on winding roads. I can’t say the same for many others.\n\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes are standard, with traction control and an electronic stability system on most trim levels. The brake pedal doesn’t provide the most linear stopping power, but the response is strong enough. Senior editor Joe Wiesenfelder found the hatchback’s brakes more impressive — though his came with larger discs, as do all trims with the 2.5-liter engine, so that may have had something to do with it.\n\nRide Quality, Road Noise\nMazda tunes its suspensions “to the handling side of ride [versus] handling,” spokesman Jeremy Barnes told me. He’s right: The Mazda3 rides on the firmer side, even with the test car’s 16-inch wheels. (Cars with the larger four-cylinder get similar suspension tuning but 17-inch wheels with lower-profile tires.) Highway expansion joints come and go with a noticeable kathunk, and uneven pavement can leave you in a constant pattern of down/up motions as the car follows each dip and rise. The suspension sorts things out well enough after each bump, with few reverberations as the car resettles itself, but the shocks could stand to soak up a bit more. The Civic and Forte ride a bit better, and the Corolla veritably glides over the rough patches.\n\nThere isn’t much wind noise, and the Mazda3 remains pretty well unfazed by highway crosswinds. Road and tire noise, however, are a different story. They’re noticeable at all times and, over some surfaces, are downright loud. I took the car some 350 miles between Chicago and upstate Michigan, and the road played a constant backdrop to my music. I ended up having to crank the stereo volume to overcome it — which incidentally revealed the mediocrity and overblown bass of the six-speaker system.\n\nThe Cabin\nIf the Volkswagen Jetta leads the pack in small-car cabin quality, I’m prepared to award the silver medal to Mazda. The dashboard panels have upscale textures and padded surfaces, and most controls feel high-rent for the segment. The windshield and dash slope far forward, giving you a sense of roominess that’s similar to the Civic. Over time I felt like I was sitting above everything: The cockpit doesn’t wrap around you so much as it’s arrayed before you, a layout that might take some getting used to.\n\nThe cloth seats have supportive backrests, though there could be more shoulder support; the sport seats in 2.5-liter models are intended to help with this. There’s enough bolstering to hold you in as you sling the car through a corner, but my 5-foot-11 frame never had enough thigh support. Part of that is because of the short seat cushions, but the seating angle is also to blame: It didn’t slope back enough for me, particularly when you jack the cushion up — as I do — with the standard seat-height adjuster. It’s possible the highest Grand Touring trim addresses this, as its power-adjustable driver’s seat includes a seat-angle adjustment.\n\nMazda3 in the Market\nEven in its least fun combination — with an automatic transmission and the smallest engine — the Mazda3 courts driving enthusiasts like few cars in this price range can do. When Mazda introduced it for the 2004 model year, I lived in Los Angeles where I could fling cars around impossibly twisty canyon roads. In short order, Mazda’s Civic fighter tore the Civic a new one.\n\nI’m pleased the automaker didn’t tinker with a good formula. The Mazda3 is still a fun little car, and provided your commute is free of too many potholes, it’s a mighty compelling choice.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Redesigned for 2019, the Mazda3 doubles down on its roots as a car for drivers, not passengers.\n\nVersus the competition: Drivability and quality shine in the fourth-generation Mazda3, but a cramped interior and fussy controls might push consumers to more practical — and often less expensive — alternatives.\n\nAvailable as a sedan or hatchback, the Mazda3 comes standard with a punchier four-cylinder engine than is the compact-class norm. The prior generation’s base engine has been dropped for the U.S. market, but all-wheel drive is newly optional. Stick-shift enthusiasts can still get a manual in the hatchback’s highest trim level; other trims have an automatic. We tested the automatic on a hatchback and later a sedan, both well-equipped examples with AWD. Compare both cars, or read our initial thoughts after driving the Mazda3 at a media preview.\n\nStyling and Visibility\n\nMazda hinted at the Mazda3 hatchback with the beady-eyed Kai concept in late 2017, but the production car is no less dramatic. A heavily raked windshield sweeps nearly over the front seats, while enormous rear pillars envelop the back half. It’s as much pillar as you get in hatchbacks like the Hyundai Veloster or erstwhile Honda CR-Z, and it hurts visibility just as much. If the prior Mazda3 hatch suffered poor sight lines, its successor is even worse. Glance over your shoulder, and an enormous column separates the tapered rear-door window from the tiny rear window.\n\nOver-the-shoulder visibility is far better in the Mazda3 sedan. The rear window remains tiny, but the C-pillars, slimmer by design, no longer engulf adjacent traffic. Both cars position the cabin toward the rear of their respective profiles — a characteristic that makes the windshield seem especially close to the front seats, though it extends far enough over your head to keep traffic lights within your field of view.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nCharacteristic of the drivetrains in other Mazda products, the Mazda3 pairs a smooth-revving engine — in this case a 2.5-liter four-cylinder with 186 horsepower and 186 pounds-feet of torque — with an efficiency-oriented automatic transmission that limits performance potential. The six-speed automatic downshifts swiftly when you need more power, but its tall gearing makes for a long climb up the tachometer. The four-cylinder has gratifying midrange power, but it takes forever to get there from a stop or to hit the sweet spot again after an upshift. A driver-selectable Sport mode improves accelerator response and keeps revs higher by staying out of the highest gears, but it seldom upshifts even if you stay at a steady speed, so there’s sure to be a mileage penalty.\n\nIf Mazda could shorten up the gearing by way of an eight- or nine-speed automatic while preserving kickdown response, the drivetrain could be dynamite. (Alas, it seldom works out that way.) It might also improve gas mileage, which is EPA-rated at 30 mpg for automatic front-drive models. As compact cars go, that’s unimpressive. AWD models are rated 27 to 28 mpg, depending on body style.\n\nRide quality is firm but sophisticated, with controlled shock absorption that belies the Mazda3’s move from its longstanding independent rear suspension to cheaper, torsion-beam hardware for 2019. Still, isolation is not its forte: At higher speeds, weathered roads highlight turbulence that rivals like the Chevrolet Cruze and Volkswagen Jetta do a better job of filtering out. (Both competitors also do that with torsion beams, mind you. The results, not the formula, are what matters.)\n\nAWD might aid cold-weather traction, but don’t expect a boost when it comes to warm-weather handling. Push the Mazda3 hard through a sweeping curve and Mazda’s system shows little interest in sending power rearward to reorient the nose. Still, it’s not like the car begs for help; the chassis masks understeer quite well on its own, and its all-season tires (Toyo Proxes P215/45R18s on our test car) give plenty of warning before progressive sliding sets in. The brakes are strong and steering feedback is excellent, though the rival Honda Civic remains atop the class for steering quickness; the Mazda3’s wheel feels a little slower in terms of ratio.\n\nThe Inside\n\nQuality trumps quantity in the new Mazda3, which boasts lavish materials but little space. Drivers of many sizes will find their knees pinched between the doors and center console, and adults in back will sit with their knees jammed into the front seats. Despite that, the Mazda3 has improbable storage space accessible to drivers — a failing of its predecessor — with generous provisions in the dash, doors and center console.\n\nInterior styling mixes overlapping materials that arc around each other, with controls draped into the gaps; it’s a style that’s in vogue right now (see the new Lexus ES). Most controls feel meticulous enough, and certain sounds — the ticking turn signals, the chime when you end a Bluetooth call — have a unique, upscale vibe. Ditto for the materials; on that front, the Mazda3 could pass for an entry-level luxury car. Low-gloss panels cover the upper doors and dash, and generous stitched wrappings extend down to knee level — areas where mass-market competitors often revert to lower-budget plastics. The materials don’t cheap out when you get to the backseat, which is another common practice in the non-luxury class. Premium touches include fabric-wrapped A-pillars and one-touch express windows all around. Many pricier mid-size sedans don’t have it this good, and much of the Mazda3’s quality comes even in base trim levels.\n\nMissteps come on the technology front, where the Mazda3’s standard tablet display (an 8.8-inch widescreen) no longer operates as a touchscreen. It’s high atop the dash and too far away to easily reach even if it was a touchscreen, but the result is a step backward for usability nonetheless. You have to use a multifunction controller ahead of the center armrest, which is anathema to the Apple CarPlay and Android Auto systems included on most trim levels. Consumer surveys show owners prefer touchscreens over console controllers, and both smartphone integrations are optimized for the former. Mazda is going the wrong way here.\n\nOther head-scratchers: Android Auto consistently crapped out on one editor, and the display is too wide for its own good. The smartphone mirroring doesn’t use all the screen (Mazda says an update from Google should fix this sometime in 2019) and the backup camera occupies only about 60 percent of the space. The camera display also has static guidelines, not the dynamic lines widely available now. Multiple times while driving into the sun, editors observed messages that our test car’s driver-assistance systems were temporarily disabled.\n\nDue to their separate calculation methods, you can’t compare manufacturer-stated cargo space between hatchbacks and sedans — one of several reasons such specs are unreliable — so don’t let the Mazda3’s specs fool you. Despite numbers that suggest otherwise, the sedan’s trunk is nearly a third deeper than the same space in the hatchback, by our measurement, with similar width and height up to the seatbacks. The hatchback adds versatility if you fold the seats down, of course, but if you aim to carry rear passengers and load up on cargo behind them, the sedan is the way to go.\n\nValue\n\nThe 2019 Mazda3 sedan and hatchback received Top Safety Pick status from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. The cheapest variant, an automatic front-drive sedan, starts just under $22,000 with destination. That’s some $700-$1,500 more than automatic-equipped versions of the Civic, Jetta and 2020 Toyota Corolla, and value-priced versions of the Kia Forte and Hyundai Elantra will save you even more.\n\nAt its base price, the Mazda3 lacks Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and automatic emergency braking — three must-have features in any compact car. Higher trims have all three features, plus leatherette (vinyl) or leather seats, depending how much you spend. Other options include stop-and-go adaptive cruise control, a power driver’s seat, keyless access and a moonroof. Lane-centering steering, a feature increasingly available in the class, isn’t offered in U.S. models. Loaded with factory equipment and AWD, the Mazda3 sedan tops out around $29,500. That’s also pricey for the class, but most competitors are front-drive only.\n\nMazda’s latest compact might build a case as a value alternative to entry-luxury subcompacts like the Audi A3 or Mercedes-Benz A-Class, but mass-market value is not its forte, especially when you consider its mileage deficit — and the extra-long warranties (Hyundai, Kia, Volkswagen) or free maintenance (Chevrolet, Toyota) offered elsewhere. Driving enthusiasts and quality aficionados will find something to like, but it’s hard to build a case for broader appeal.\n\nEditor’s note: This story was updated July 5, 2019, to clarify that the manual transmission is only available with the hatchback.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "They don’t get the attention — or the sales — of comparable models from Toyota and Honda, but don’t overlook the Mazda3 and its bigger brother, the Mazda6. Both cars offer genuinely good value and, when outfitted in their sportier trim, serve up a fun-to-drive factor that rivals German cars.\n\nCase in point: The 2006 Mazda3 s. Though the engine and transmission aren’t quite as refined as the new Honda Civic Si — which, incidentally, only comes as a two-door coupe — the Mazda3 s sedan is at least as much fun to drive, and it has four doors. Its 2.3-liter four-cylinder engine has 160 horsepower, 37 fewer than the Civic Si’s 2.0-liter engine, but the difference doesn’t feel that big, likely due in part to the Mazda’s 11 extra foot-pounds of torque.\n\nThe Mazda3 comes as a regular four-door sedan, such as the test car, or as a four-door hatchback. The base Mazda3 i has a 2.0-liter, 150-horsepower four-cylinder, while the sportier Mazda3 s has a 2.3-liter engine. The hatchback model gets only the 2.3.\n\nBase price of the test car, a Touring model, was $17,615, and that buys a lot of standard equipment, such as side and side-curtain air bags, P205/50R-17 radials on alloy wheels, an AM/FM stereo with CD player and six speakers, cruise control, disc brakes with anti-lock, keyless entry, air conditioning and power locks, mirrors and windows. Options were a power sunroof and a six-disc CD changer, offered as a $890 package. With shipping, the total was $19,065. That’s with the five-speed manual transmission; a five-speed automatic adds $950. Mileage with the five-speed manual is an EPA-rated 26 mpg in the city, 32 on the highway.\n\nInside, the instruments are nicely placed, but I’m not a fan of the sound-system layout, which revolves around a huge on-off/volume button. The front cloth-covered bucket seats are pretty comfortable, and the gearshift lever is in just the right place. The Mazda3 s feels very familiar, very quickly. Rear-seat room is about average for a car this size, as is trunk space. One complaint: On the second speed, the fan for the air conditioning is loud. On the fourth and highest speed, you’ll reach for the stereo volume button. Maybe that’s why it’s so prominent.\n\nThe Mazda3 s is certainly happy in the city, and it gives a very good ride on the highway, even on rough pavement. It’s most in its element, though, on winding roads, where you can give the independent suspension a workout. Handling is excellent, much more neutral than most front-wheel-drive cars.\n\nThe Mazda3 went on sale in December 2003, as a 2004 model, and as the replacement for the Protege. It still looks and feels fresh but has been around long enough for buyers to expect a discount, making an appealing car even more so.\n\n– – –\n\nSentinel Automotive Editor Steven Cole Smithcan be reached at scsmith@orlandosentinel.com or 407-420-5699.",

      "expert_review": "In a field that’s exposing also-rans at a torrid pace, the 2011 Mazda3 compact sedan and hatchback still shine.\n\nThe popular Mazda3 remains unabashedly fun to drive, which should appeal to driving enthusiasts who want a practical car. And although it falls short on ride quality and fuel efficiency, the latter is set to improve with next year’s four-cylinder drivetrain, which should get 40 mpg highway.\n\nMazda offers three drivetrains: two normally aspirated four-cylinders — each with a manual or automatic transmission — and a manual-only Mazdaspeed3 hatchback with a turbocharged four-cylinder. (Click here to stack them up.) Since the Mazda3 was redesigned a year ago, we’ve driven all three engines. A newly standard electronic stability system is the chief difference for the 2011 car, which you can compare with the 2010 Mazda3 here.\n\nHandling\nEver since its late-2003 launch, the Mazda3 has held platinum membership in the fun-to-drive-econobox club — a group that has included, at times, only a handful of peers: the Ford Focus, the Honda Civic and the Volkswagen Jetta. A few more have joined the ranks recently, but the Mazda3 remains at the head. Few sub-$20,000 cars achieve such harmony across the driving experience. Steering turn-in is precise, allowing for quick darts from one lane to the next. At low speeds, our 2.5-liter test car’s wheel felt both light and lively — better than last year’s 2.0-liter Mazda3, whose wheel could have used more low-speed power assist. Regardless of body style, the car’s 34.2-foot turning circle beats much of the field.\n\nEditors raved about the Mazda’s high-speed handling; in our review of last year’s Mazda3, which involved some time on Wisconsin’s Road America racetrack, one editor lauded the car’s go-kart-like manners. If there’s any criticism, it comes with the Mazdaspeed3. I was unimpressed: The steering — which has the same ratio but less power assist — tracks well, but the car’s nose pushes relentlessly on sweeping curves, and our tester’s Dunlop SP Sport P225/40R18 summer tires ceded grip sooner than high-performance rubber ought to. The Mini Cooper S is more driftable, as go-fast hatches go. Though I offered repeated invites, the Mazdaspeed3’s rear was loathe to dance.\n\nGoing & Stopping\nThe base four-cylinder’s power is comparable with many other compacts — perhaps even a smidge better than some, given the optional five-speed automatic upshifts smoothly and the gear ratios are well-spaced for quick 60-to-70 mph passing. Kickdown, however, could be a bit swifter.\n\nIf you’re looking to move away from intersections a bit more quickly, consider trading the 148-horsepower four-cylinder for the 167-hp four. It’s optional in the sedan and standard in the hatchback. It packs a gratifying — and palpably stronger — amount of acceleration, thanks in large part to 33 extra pounds-feet of torque. Beware, though: You’ll sacrifice 2-5 mpg overall, depending on which transmission you choose.\n\nThe Mazdaspeed3 comes only with a six-speed manual. Like the stick shift in the normally aspirated car, it has longish throws but a short, satisfyingly hefty shifter. The car’s turbocharged four-cylinder feels a bit old-school, with noticeable turbo lag followed by a sudden, peaky stretch of power. The burst thrusts the car forward and kicks the tachometer needle to its 6,700-rpm redline at breakneck speed. Driving hard, you’ll have to upshift too often to savor the climb. For its sub-$24,000 price, the Mazdaspeed3 is stunningly quick — our friends at “MotorWeek” hit 60 mph in just 5.2 seconds with theirs — but longer gearing would help drivers enjoy the experience a bit more. So would better mitigation of the car’s torque steer, which becomes a major force on hard takeoffs, but such is the case in most powerful front-drive cars.\n\nThe Mazdaspeed3 has four-wheel-disc antilock brakes, with larger front discs than the regular Mazda3. They offer forceful, linear pedal response, though our test car’s were a bit too touchy when I lifted off to start moving again.\n\nCombined city/highway gas mileage ranges from 21 mpg in the Mazdaspeed3 to 28 mpg in a manual Mazda3 with the base four-cylinder. (As is the case with many high-performance cars, the Mazdaspeed3 needs premium gas.) None of these numbers are particularly good: The Hyundai Elantra, 2012 Civic and 2012 Focus are all better, getting as much as 33 mpg. Armed with a new direct-injection four-cylinder, next year’s Mazda3 should get around 32 mpg overall.\n\nRide Quality\nRide quality marks the latest battleground among small cars, and the Chevrolet Cruze and Elantra are plowing through the competition. The Mazda3 trails both; it’s worth a competitive test-drive to see the difference for yourself. With the Mazda’s 16- or 17-inch wheels, highway expansion joints come and go with a noticeable kathunk, and uneven pavement can leave you in a constant pattern of down/up motions as the car follows each dip and rise. The suspension sorts things out well enough after each bump, with few reverberations as the car resettles itself, but the shock absorbers could stand to soak up a bit more.\n\nDrivetrains Compared\nEngine\t2.0L four-cylinder\t2.5L four-cylinder\t2.3L turbo four-cylinder\nAvailability\tSedan\tSedan, hatchback\tHatchback\nHorsepower (@ rpm)\t148 @ 6,500\t167 @ 6,000\t263 @ 5,500\nTorque (lbs.-ft., @ rpm)\t135 @ 4,500\t168 @ 4,000\t280 @ 3,000\nTransmissions\tFive-speed manual,\nfive-speed automatic\tSix-speed manual,\nfive-speed automatic\tSix-speed manual\nEPA combined MPG\t27 (auto),\n28 (manual)\t25 (auto),\n23 (manual)\t21\nFuel\tRegular\tRegular\tPremium\nSource: Automaker and EPA data\n\nThe Mazdaspeed3 has 18-inch wheels and a performance-tuned suspension. There’s less up-and-down movement on the highway, and the car absorbs mid-corner bumps without becoming skittish. At low speeds, however, the ride is quite choppy. You’ll find yourself driving around ruts and potholes, as they make for a jarring experience.\n\nWind noise is moderate, though the Mazda3 remains mostly unfazed by highway crosswinds. Road and tire noise, however, are a different story: The sound is always noticeable, and it gets downright loud over some surfaces.\n\nThe Inside\nCabin quality in the Mazda3 is competitive overall, though cars like the Cruze and Elantra have leapfrogged the class. The Mazda’s dashboard panels have upscale textures and padded surfaces; unfortunately, the doors and anything below eye level look considerably cheaper. Still, the windshield and dash slope far forward, giving you a sense of roominess that’s similar to the Civic. Over time, I felt like I was sitting above everything: The cockpit doesn’t wrap around you so much as it’s arrayed before you.\n\nThe Mazda3’s basic cloth seats offer decent lateral support but insufficient shoulder and thigh support, though sport seats improve matters in the 2.5-liter and Mazdaspeed models. Across all our cars, my 5-foot-11 frame could have used another inch or so of rearward adjustment range, like in too many cars in this class.\n\nSuch limitations preserve some backseat room, to be sure — and anyone sitting back there will need it. The legroom dimensions are misleading: There’s an alleged 36.2 inches in both the sedan and hatchback, which would put the Mazda3 near the top of the segment in terms of backseat legroom. In reality, though, it’s snug; the Civic, Kia Forte and Jetta easily trump it.\n\nTrunk volume in the Mazda3 sedan is just 11.8 cubic feet; the Cruze and Jetta offer 15 cubic feet or more. The Mazda3 hatchback offers a more usable 17 cubic feet behind the backseat, with 42.8 cubic feet of maximum volume with the seat folded down. Both figures are competitive among hatchbacks.\n\nSafety, Features & Pricing\nWith top scores in front and side-impact crash tests from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the Mazda3 earned Top Safety Pick status for both hatchback and sedan body styles. Standard safety features include side curtain airbags, antilock brakes and an electronic stability system. (Last year’s Mazda3 sedan lacked a stability system in lower trims.) Click here for a full list of features, or here to see our evaluation of child-safety seating provisions in the hatchback.\n\nReliability for the second-generation Mazda3 has been above average. That’s about even with the segment, which has proved reliable on the whole. The Mazda3 sedan starts at $15,800; it comes standard with power windows and locks, a CD stereo with an auxiliary MP3 jack, and steering-wheel audio controls. Move up the trims, and you can get air conditioning, a moonroof, alloy wheels, heated leather seats and a navigation system. Check all the boxes, and the car can come with adaptive xenon headlights, dual-zone automatic climate control and a power driver’s seat — three features not usually seen in this class. Mazda3 hatchbacks, which come standard with the larger four-cylinder, start at $20,045. That’s $500 more than an equivalently trimmed sedan.\n\nWith all the options checked, the Mazda3 tops out around $26,000. That includes things like Bluetooth audio streaming, but — curiously — no USB/iPod connectivity beyond the basic auxiliary jack.\n\nMazda3 in the Market\nA bumper crop of new competitors — among which the Elantra looks particularly compelling — are making at least one recently redesigned car seem outdated, but not the Mazda3. It’s not the most refined, roomy or fuel-efficient choice, but Mazda still offers driving enthusiasts the most complete compact-car package. Next year’s fuel-efficiency improvements can only raise its standing.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "Not long ago, I wrote about the Mazdaspeed3, Mazda’s 263-horsepower hot-rod version of its entry-level car. A reader e-mailed, wondering if it was really worth the price premium over a regular Mazda3 S model: The Mazda- speed3 I tested listed for almost $25,000, and they’ve been so scarce this year that some dealers have added their own markups to the car.\n\nI told the reader that for me, a regular midlevel version of the Mazda3 was so entertaining that I’d be hard-pressed to justify the extra money, especially since the best you could likely hope for with the Mazdaspeed3 is to pay list price, while you can expect a healthy discount on the regular version.\n\nAfter a week with a Mazda3 S Touring, I’m pretty comfortable with that answer. While this car isn’t the athlete the Mazdaspeed3 is, or even the Honda Civic Si, it’s a blast to drive for what it costs. I’m not sure there’s a better sub-$20,000 value for those who insist on having fun behind the wheel.\n\nThe test car was a sedan version, as opposed to Mazda’s wagon like hatchback, which I like just as well. The engine is a willing, eager 2.3-literfour-cylinder with 156 horsepower, and the transmission is an exceptionally smooth five-speed manual. You can get an automatic transmission, but the manual is so good that I’d stick with it and save $950.\n\nAs it is, the test car started at $18,425, and that gets you a lot of equipment, including stability control, traction control, anti-lock disc brakes, air conditioning, cruise control, fog lights, power windows and locks and a good six-speaker stereo. Options on the test car were a package that adds a power sunroof and a six-disc CD changer ($890), and Sirius satellite radio ($430). With shipping, list price was $20,340.\n\nIf you are slightly less interested in performance, the Mazda3 I starts at less than $15,000, and has a 2.0-liter, 148-horsepower four-cylinder engine. It isn’t as sporty as the S — different suspension, 15-inch tires and wheels, instead of the 17-inchers on the test car — but for the money, it’s a lot of car, though beware that air conditioning is an option.\n\nOn the road, the test car is taut and nimble — it’s really surprising that this car has been around in the same basic form since 2004 but still feels fresh. Handling is quite European — this platform was, after all, developed there — with a nice mixture of comfort and road feel. Inside, the sound system — typical for Mazda — is not particularly intuitive, but other instruments and controls are fine. The cloth-covered bucket seats are supportive and firm. Rear-seat room is acceptable for a car this size, as is trunk space.\n\nThere are newer models on the market, and even at list price, the Mazda3 S Touring is exceptionally appealing. But figuring in a nice discount given the age of the model, it goes from being a good buy to one of the best bargains out there.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Redesigned for 2019, the Mazda3 doubles down on its roots as a car for drivers, not passengers.\n\nVersus the competition: Drivability and quality shine in the fourth-generation Mazda3, but a cramped interior and fussy controls might push consumers to more practical — and often less expensive — alternatives.\n\nAvailable as a sedan or hatchback, the Mazda3 comes standard with a punchier four-cylinder engine than is the compact-class norm. The prior generation’s base engine has been dropped for the U.S. market, but all-wheel drive is newly optional. Stick-shift enthusiasts can still get a manual in the hatchback’s highest trim level; other trims have an automatic. We tested the automatic on a hatchback and later a sedan, both well-equipped examples with AWD. Compare both cars, or read our initial thoughts after driving the Mazda3 at a media preview.\n\nStyling and Visibility\n\nMazda hinted at the Mazda3 hatchback with the beady-eyed Kai concept in late 2017, but the production car is no less dramatic. A heavily raked windshield sweeps nearly over the front seats, while enormous rear pillars envelop the back half. It’s as much pillar as you get in hatchbacks like the Hyundai Veloster or erstwhile Honda CR-Z, and it hurts visibility just as much. If the prior Mazda3 hatch suffered poor sight lines, its successor is even worse. Glance over your shoulder, and an enormous column separates the tapered rear-door window from the tiny rear window.\n\nOver-the-shoulder visibility is far better in the Mazda3 sedan. The rear window remains tiny, but the C-pillars, slimmer by design, no longer engulf adjacent traffic. Both cars position the cabin toward the rear of their respective profiles — a characteristic that makes the windshield seem especially close to the front seats, though it extends far enough over your head to keep traffic lights within your field of view.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nCharacteristic of the drivetrains in other Mazda products, the Mazda3 pairs a smooth-revving engine — in this case a 2.5-liter four-cylinder with 186 horsepower and 186 pounds-feet of torque — with an efficiency-oriented automatic transmission that limits performance potential. The six-speed automatic downshifts swiftly when you need more power, but its tall gearing makes for a long climb up the tachometer. The four-cylinder has gratifying midrange power, but it takes forever to get there from a stop or to hit the sweet spot again after an upshift. A driver-selectable Sport mode improves accelerator response and keeps revs higher by staying out of the highest gears, but it seldom upshifts even if you stay at a steady speed, so there’s sure to be a mileage penalty.\n\nIf Mazda could shorten up the gearing by way of an eight- or nine-speed automatic while preserving kickdown response, the drivetrain could be dynamite. (Alas, it seldom works out that way.) It might also improve gas mileage, which is EPA-rated at 30 mpg for automatic front-drive models. As compact cars go, that’s unimpressive. AWD models are rated 27 to 28 mpg, depending on body style.\n\nRide quality is firm but sophisticated, with controlled shock absorption that belies the Mazda3’s move from its longstanding independent rear suspension to cheaper, torsion-beam hardware for 2019. Still, isolation is not its forte: At higher speeds, weathered roads highlight turbulence that rivals like the Chevrolet Cruze and Volkswagen Jetta do a better job of filtering out. (Both competitors also do that with torsion beams, mind you. The results, not the formula, are what matters.)\n\nAWD might aid cold-weather traction, but don’t expect a boost when it comes to warm-weather handling. Push the Mazda3 hard through a sweeping curve and Mazda’s system shows little interest in sending power rearward to reorient the nose. Still, it’s not like the car begs for help; the chassis masks understeer quite well on its own, and its all-season tires (Toyo Proxes P215/45R18s on our test car) give plenty of warning before progressive sliding sets in. The brakes are strong and steering feedback is excellent, though the rival Honda Civic remains atop the class for steering quickness; the Mazda3’s wheel feels a little slower in terms of ratio.\n\nThe Inside\n\nQuality trumps quantity in the new Mazda3, which boasts lavish materials but little space. Drivers of many sizes will find their knees pinched between the doors and center console, and adults in back will sit with their knees jammed into the front seats. Despite that, the Mazda3 has improbable storage space accessible to drivers — a failing of its predecessor — with generous provisions in the dash, doors and center console.\n\nInterior styling mixes overlapping materials that arc around each other, with controls draped into the gaps; it’s a style that’s in vogue right now (see the new Lexus ES). Most controls feel meticulous enough, and certain sounds — the ticking turn signals, the chime when you end a Bluetooth call — have a unique, upscale vibe. Ditto for the materials; on that front, the Mazda3 could pass for an entry-level luxury car. Low-gloss panels cover the upper doors and dash, and generous stitched wrappings extend down to knee level — areas where mass-market competitors often revert to lower-budget plastics. The materials don’t cheap out when you get to the backseat, which is another common practice in the non-luxury class. Premium touches include fabric-wrapped A-pillars and one-touch express windows all around. Many pricier mid-size sedans don’t have it this good, and much of the Mazda3’s quality comes even in base trim levels.\n\nMissteps come on the technology front, where the Mazda3’s standard tablet display (an 8.8-inch widescreen) no longer operates as a touchscreen. It’s high atop the dash and too far away to easily reach even if it was a touchscreen, but the result is a step backward for usability nonetheless. You have to use a multifunction controller ahead of the center armrest, which is anathema to the Apple CarPlay and Android Auto systems included on most trim levels. Consumer surveys show owners prefer touchscreens over console controllers, and both smartphone integrations are optimized for the former. Mazda is going the wrong way here.\n\nOther head-scratchers: Android Auto consistently crapped out on one editor, and the display is too wide for its own good. The smartphone mirroring doesn’t use all the screen (Mazda says an update from Google should fix this sometime in 2019) and the backup camera occupies only about 60 percent of the space. The camera display also has static guidelines, not the dynamic lines widely available now. Multiple times while driving into the sun, editors observed messages that our test car’s driver-assistance systems were temporarily disabled.\n\nDue to their separate calculation methods, you can’t compare manufacturer-stated cargo space between hatchbacks and sedans — one of several reasons such specs are unreliable — so don’t let the Mazda3’s specs fool you. Despite numbers that suggest otherwise, the sedan’s trunk is nearly a third deeper than the same space in the hatchback, by our measurement, with similar width and height up to the seatbacks. The hatchback adds versatility if you fold the seats down, of course, but if you aim to carry rear passengers and load up on cargo behind them, the sedan is the way to go.\n\nValue\n\nThe 2019 Mazda3 sedan and hatchback received Top Safety Pick status from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. The cheapest variant, an automatic front-drive sedan, starts just under $22,000 with destination. That’s some $700-$1,500 more than automatic-equipped versions of the Civic, Jetta and 2020 Toyota Corolla, and value-priced versions of the Kia Forte and Hyundai Elantra will save you even more.\n\nAt its base price, the Mazda3 lacks Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and automatic emergency braking — three must-have features in any compact car. Higher trims have all three features, plus leatherette (vinyl) or leather seats, depending how much you spend. Other options include stop-and-go adaptive cruise control, a power driver’s seat, keyless access and a moonroof. Lane-centering steering, a feature increasingly available in the class, isn’t offered in U.S. models. Loaded with factory equipment and AWD, the Mazda3 sedan tops out around $29,500. That’s also pricey for the class, but most competitors are front-drive only.\n\nMazda’s latest compact might build a case as a value alternative to entry-luxury subcompacts like the Audi A3 or Mercedes-Benz A-Class, but mass-market value is not its forte, especially when you consider its mileage deficit — and the extra-long warranties (Hyundai, Kia, Volkswagen) or free maintenance (Chevrolet, Toyota) offered elsewhere. Driving enthusiasts and quality aficionados will find something to like, but it’s hard to build a case for broader appeal.\n\nEditor’s note: This story was updated July 5, 2019, to clarify that the manual transmission is only available with the hatchback.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

A six-speed manual is also available, but only on the front-wheel-drive version of the hatchback in Premium trim. All-wheel drive is optional on select trims.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Mazda3?\n\nThe sedan-only base 2.0 model and its 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine have been discontinued, leaving the 2.5-liter four-cylinder as the entry-level power plant. That engine gets a slight horsepower boost, up to 191 hp from 186 hp. The Carbon Edition trim can now have all-wheel drive. \n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Mazda3 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nRain-sensing wipers\nPush-button start\n8.8-inch multimedia screen\nVoice commands\nEight-speaker stereo\nLED headlights and taillights\nKeyless entry\nBluetooth\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nAdaptive cruise control\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane keep assist\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nAll-wheel drive\nMoonroof\nHead-up instrument display\nPaddle shifters\nLeather-trimmed seats\nHeated front seats\nPower-adjustable driver’s seat with memory feature\nDual-zone climate control\nNavigation\nBose premium stereo\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nShould I Buy the 2023 Mazda3?\n\nThe Mazda3 is a great choice for shoppers looking for something small, sporty and fuel-efficient. Choosing between the sedan and hatchback is mostly a toss-up; the sedan has better outward visibility, while the hatch delivers more cargo space. Having AWD on the option sheet is another plus for the fun-loving Mazda3. Top trims fitted with the turbo engine get pricey, but the cabin has the look and feel of a near-luxury vehicle.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in January 2012 about the 2012 Mazda Mazda3. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2013, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThanks to new drivetrains, the 2012 Mazda3 has fuel economy ratings as high as 40 mpg on the highway. That’s a big gain over last year that addresses a major shortcoming in the brand’s most popular car. After all, at least five 40-mpg competitors will be on sale by this summer. The bandwagon is unstoppable, and now Mazda has a seat on board.\n\nThe 2012 Mazda3’s refinement issues will linger until the car gets a full redesign, but its driving fun and fuel efficiency keep the car competitive.\n\nThe Mazda3 comes as a sedan or hatchback with four available engines and essentially 11 versions, including the turbocharged Mazdaspeed3. Two trim levels have the suffix “SkyActiv,” which represents high-mileage technology in the form of the company’s newest four-cylinder engine and/or select transmissions and other technologies. As is the case in most competing models, the highest mileage figures come in the more expensive sedan trim levels. The most affordable hatchback is efficient, but the base price for this body style is more than $4,000 higher than the base sedan’s.\n\nIn any configuration, the Mazda’s firm ride will turn off some shoppers, but the mileage makeover breathes new life into a model that has never emphasized efficiency. Click here to compare drivetrains, or here to compare the 2012 Mazda3 with the 2011. We tested a stick-shift 2012 Mazda3 hatchback with the SkyActiv four-cylinder. We’ve driven the other engines in years past.\n\nCapable Power\nThe Mazda3’s two base trims, SV and Sport, retain last year’s 148-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder. It moves well enough, helped by well-spaced gear ratios in the optional five-speed automatic transmission. A five-speed manual is standard.\n\nThe 155-hp, direct-inject SkyActiv engine, also a 2.0-liter four-cylinder, adds a modest 7 hp and — more importantly — 10 percent more passing-lane torque than its port-injected peer. It can be paired with either an automatic or a manual, both with six speeds. The SkyActiv engine comes in handy on the interstate, where our stick-shift test car accelerated 10 mph in 6th gear at a reasonable pace. The base 2.0-liter — and a lot of four-cylinder competitors — needs a downshift in order to speed up on the highway. Around town, the 2.0-liter engines feel similar to each other, except that the SkyActiv’s slow initial accelerator response translates to anemic start-offs. The Mazda3’s optional 2.5-liter four-cylinder has gutsier midrange power that makes it quicker than most commuter cars, if less efficient.\n\nThe SkyActiv sedan is rated an EPA-estimated 28/40 mpg city/highway with the automatic, 27/39 with the stick. The SkyActiv hatchback has identical city numbers but is 1 mpg less efficient on the highway with either transmission. Still, that’s 2 to 7 mpg better than the base 2.0-liter, depending on trim, and 6 to 11 mpg better than the 2.5-liter Mazda3. All three engines use regular gas.\n\nThe Mazdaspeed3 comes only with a stick shift and sports a turbocharged four-cylinder that sprints to extralegal speeds. Its refinement, however, is disappointing. The car’s 263-hp engine feels old-school, with noticeable turbo lag followed by power that’s too peaky to savor. Dig deep into the gas, and the tach needle flies toward its 6,700-rpm redline at breakneck speed. For its $24,000 price, the Mazdaspeed3 is a go-fast bargain — our friends at “MotorWeek” hit 60 mph in it in just 5.2 seconds — but more low-rev torque with longer gearing would help drivers enjoy the experience a bit more. So would addressing the car’s torque steer, which becomes a major force on hard takeoffs. Such is the case in powerful front-drive cars, but some manage it better than this one. The Speed3 requires premium gas and is rated 18/25 mpg.\n\nHandling & Ride\nIn the Mazda3, performance trumps comfort — but the payoff is impressive. Editors enjoyed our test car’s sharp steering and linear braking. The nose pushes in sweeping corners, but the tail breaks free soon after, allowing the driver to manage the car’s rotation. The Mazdaspeed3, in contrast, slings more fun-sapping weight over the front axle, which cuts its drifting potential. Its stickier Dunlop SP Sport P225/40R18 summer tires eventually cede grip up front, but the tail stays put, refusing to let you easily slide on all fours.\n\nThe Mazdaspeed3’s choppy ride can be punishing over potholes, and even the base Mazda3 trims ride firmly. On the highway, crosswinds require constant steering corrections, and the suspension in our 2012 test car lost its cool time and again over broken pavement. Road and wind noise, in contrast, were low; I just wish the suspension were as refined. Competitors like the Chevrolet Cruze and Hyundai Elantra marry ride and handling better. The Mazda still wins for outright fun, but comfort-minded drivers should look elsewhere.\n\nThe Inside\nCabin quality is competitive overall, but cars like the Cruze, Elantra and the forthcoming Dodge Dart are pushing ahead. The Mazda’s dashboard panels have upscale textures and padded surfaces; unfortunately, the doors and anything below eye level look considerably cheaper. Still, most controls are high quality, and the dashboard’s shallow rake leaves the interior feeling roomy.\n\nOur test car’s basic cloth seats felt over-bolstered, leaving my back sore after a few hours behind the wheel. My 5-foot-11 frame could have used another inch or so of rearward travel, too. Such limitations preserve some backseat room, and anyone sitting back there will need it. The Mazda3’s legroom dimensions are misleading: There’s an alleged 36.2 inches in both the sedan and hatchback, which would put it near the top of the segment. In reality, though, it’s snug back there; rear seats in the Dart, Honda Civic, Kia Forte and Volkswagen Jetta feel roomier.\n\nTrunk volume in the Mazda3 sedan is just 11.8 cubic feet; the Cruze and Jetta offer 15 cubic feet or more. The Mazda3 hatchback offers a more usable 17 cubic feet behind the backseat, with 42.8 cubic feet of maximum volume with the backseat folded down. Both figures are competitive among hatchbacks.\n\nSafety, Features & Pricing\nReliability for the Mazda3 has been well above average, and the car scored top marks in all crash tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, earning the car Top Safety Pick status. But the Mazda3’s side-impact scores in the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s revamped side-impact tests returned just three out of five stars. Standard features include six airbags and the required antilock brakes and electronic stability system. Click here for a full list, or here to see our evaluation of child-seat accommodations.\n\nThe Mazda3 sedan comes in six trim levels. The SV and Sport have the base 2.0-liter engine. Touring and Grand Touring trims come with the SkyActiv 2.0-liter, while “s” versions of the Touring and Grand Touring have the 2.5-liter four-cylinder. The hatchback skips the base engine by starting at the Touring trim level, but 2012 marks the first year this body style is offered with a smaller engine — in SkyActiv form — rather than just the 2.5-liter. The Mazdaspeed3, available only as a hatchback, comes in Touring trim. Standard features on the SV sedan include power mirrors and windows, plus a CD stereo with steering-wheel audio controls and an auxiliary MP3 jack. Other trims add power door locks, air conditioning and keyless entry. Load the Mazda3 up, and you can get heated leather seats, Bose audio, dual-zone automatic climate control and a moonroof.\n\nMazda3 in the Market\nWill shoppers buy the new SkyActiv versions of the Mazda3? I think so. The mileage gains are enough to take some of the sting out of the price difference in the sedan, and the engine effectively lowers the price of the hatchback by giving buyers a cheaper alternative to the 2.5-liter engine. Either way, the fuel-efficient 2.0-liter should be easy to find: Just over half of the Mazda3s listed in Cars.com’s new-car inventory are SkyActiv trims. In the past, the Mazda3 has outsold bit players in the commuter segment, but shoppers have preferred the Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla and Chevrolet Cruze — all by more than a 2-to-1 margin. Gas mileage has been a shortfall for the nimble Mazda3; I suspect the revamped drivetrains will narrow the divide.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "The first-generation Mazda3’s viability shows automakers that this is how you do it: Come out with a car that’s so competitive when it’s new that it’s still a good choice years down the line. It also shows car shoppers that they don’t necessarily have to wait for the redesigned 2010 Mazda3, due in the first quarter of 2009. Mazda ceased production of 2009 models at the beginning of November, but given the slow state of car sales right now, they should be readily available. Building one to order isn’t an option, but Mazda says you should be able to find what you’re looking for through its dealer network. A quick new-car search on Cars.com found almost 200 of them within 20 miles of our headquarters.\n\nBy way of illustration, the Mazda3 stands in contrast to the approach Chevrolet took with the Cobalt, which made its debut a year after the Mazda3, in 2005. From the start, it didn’t measure up to the Mazda, Ford Focus or several others. Naturally it still trails Mazda now, and is well behind the models that have been introduced or redesigned since. It’s a little too easy to take potshots at GM these days, but some signs are too clear to miss. Is it a surprise that Ford and its Mazda cousin are in better — if not good — shape?\n\nTwo Strikes Against\nThe two strikes against the 2009 Mazda3 are its crash tests and its gas mileage. With the crash tests, the problem isn’t the results, it’s the lack thereof. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has never subjected a Mazda3 with side-impact airbags to a side crash test. The airbags are now standard, but all we know is that the car’s score without them is Poor. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration likewise hasn’t side-crashed an airbag-equipped Mazda3.\n\nAs for mileage, the Mazda3’s doesn’t look bad at a glance, especially if you’re accustomed to large cars, but it’s relatively low for its class. The smaller engine, a 2.0-liter four-cylinder, gets an estimated 32 mpg on the highway with a five-speed manual, and the optional 2.3-liter (the only engine available in the hatchback) rates 22/29 mpg with the manual. In comparison, the Honda Civic hits 36 mpg, and the Toyota Corolla, Cobalt and Focus manage 35 mpg. The new XFE version of the Cobalt hits 37 mpg, and even the Volkswagen Rabbit, which is 1 mpg worse in city driving, gets 30 mpg on the highway.\n\nDefining Attributes\nOn the upside, the current generation’s reliability has been above average to well above average, and it’s one of the most fun cars in the compact class. Fun is hard to define, but it usually involves good handling, which the 3 has in droves. It goes beyond that, though. I’ve always found the Focus stunning in its roadholding and poise, but in my opinion the fun factor has eluded all but the discontinued SVT model. The Mazda3 has that…well, zoom-zoom thing going for it.\n\nAlso notable is the electro-hydraulic steering, which is an interesting half-step between conventional hydraulic power steering and the proliferating electric power assist: It has an electric power-steering pump that runs intermittently, so there isn’t a parasitic load on the engine at all times, as happens with a conventional belt-driven pump. The full electric type is even more efficient, but most applications don’t capture the natural action and feedback of hydraulic. Frankly, some are terrible (Cobalt). The Mazda3 gives you less of an efficiency advantage but doesn’t sacrifice performance. If not for a little whirring when you turn the wheel at low speeds, you wouldn’t know anything’s different. It always seemed a reasonable tradeoff for a car with this one’s personality, though differences of more than 1 or 2 mpg are a bigger problem now than they were a couple years ago. This steering approach will return in the 2010 Mazda3, which is predicted to get virtually the same mileage as this generation.\n\nSatisfying Drivetrain\nWhat you get for your diminished mileage is respectable but not exceptional acceleration. Though the 2.3-liter four-cylinder (to be replaced in the 2010 by a 2.5-liter) is pretty robust, the Mazda3 is among the heavier compact cars out there, in both hatchback and sedan forms. The optional automatic transmission’s five speeds aren’t enough to make the larger engine super quick or efficient. The smaller engine’s optional automatic is a four-speed, which remains relatively common in this class.\n\nMy car had the standard five-speed manual transmission, which I thoroughly enjoyed. The stick is within reach and is a decent height. The clutch pedal is livable from day to day without being too soft. I certainly wouldn’t mind having a sixth gear, but the engine has enough torque at low rpm to allow a standing-start launch without too much clutch slippage. Overall, for an engine of its size, the 2.3-liter’s power delivery is pretty even. You have to rev the Civic’s wee four-banger to higher rpm to get a move-on, but the payoff is way better mileage.\n\nThe Inside\nThe Mazda3’s cabin is another aspect that shines, especially for a car in its fifth year on the market without an update. Again, the Cobalt didn’t compare in 2005, so it still doesn’t, and I rate my Mazda3 Grand Touring’s interior above that of comparably priced Corollas, Focuses, Hyundai Elantras and Nissan Sentras, even though they’ve been updated more recently. The Civic is in the ballpark, but nothing beats the Rabbit. Perhaps it’s the Mazda3’s liberal use of piano-black trim, especially on the Sport, Touring, Grand Touring and Mazdaspeed trim levels. Gloss is bad on most surfaces, but this lacquer look is rich. Where other models cling to their fake metal trim, the Mazda3 manages to look high-quality using plastic.\n\nThe interior isn’t perfect, though. The center storage console could be larger, and its armrest could be farther forward for people who sit closer to the steering wheel. I find the gauges well-illuminated and legible, but they don’t have the high-quality look occasionally found in modestly priced cars. The optional electronics are outdated, too. The Bose stereo performs well, but its display doesn’t have enough characters to show text effectively, and the optional pop-up navigation system is all but obsolete in terms of its interface and controls.\n\nI drove the car from Chicago to Detroit and back, and I was pleased with the leather-seat comfort, but the optional heaters only turn on and off. Most seat heaters give you at least a low and high setting, if not more. Otherwise, front and rear headroom is generous. Front legroom is on the small side, but at 6 feet tall I found it workable; on the interstate trip, I wished I could move the seat back more, and if it weren’t for the clutch pedal I would have been happy to sit farther back all the time. Backseat legroom is quite good for the class, but you won’t mistake the Mazda3 for a midsize car.\n\nCargo\nAt 11.5 cubic feet, the sedan’s trunk is rather small, but the hatchback ups it to 17.1 cu. ft. behind the backseat and 43.8 cu. ft. when it’s folded down. There’s a rigid cargo cover to keep the goods out of sight, as well as an underfloor cargo management system. Actually it’s little more than a couple shallow bins under the cargo floor, but it’s designed with notches to support the raised cover, and any extra space is welcome. The cover can be flipped, too, providing a water- and stain-resistant surface in lieu of the carpet.\n\nMazda3 in the Market\nI can’t tell you how many times I’ve returned test cars thinking, “This model’s due for an update.” That was the last thing on my mind when I handed over the Mazda3. That means the 2010 model is poised to leapfrog everything else on the market, which is the only way to do it. The Corolla was just redesigned about a year ago, and I’d take a 2009 Mazda3 over it in a heartbeat. Careful, Toyota. This is how it starts.\n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "The redesigned 2014 Mazda3 is far from perfect, but it gives small-car shoppers an alluring choice outside and in, with a satisfying mix of efficiency and performance.\n\nMazda’s redesigned commuter car remains cramped, and a drive along the mountain roads northeast of San Diego at a media preview hosted by Mazda suggests little advancement in ride quality. But the automaker should win new buyers with this redesign. As before, the Mazda3 comes in hatchback and sedan body styles; expect a high-performance Mazdaspeed3 version in the coming months or years (Mazda officials were still mum on details). Click here to stack up the 2014 and 2013 Mazda3.\n\nSedans and hatchbacks come in “i” and “s” versions that signal a 2.0-liter or 2.5-liter inline-4 cylinder engine, respectively. Both employ Mazda’s SkyActiv drivetrain technology — a first for the 2.5-liter — for EPA combined city/highway mileage estimates in the low-to-mid 30s. The Mazda3 i comes in SV (sedan only), Sport, Touring and Grand Touring variants, while the Mazda3 s comes in Touring and Grand Touring editions. I evaluated an i Touring sedan and s Grand Touring hatchback, both with the six-speed automatic transmission. You can also get a six-speed manual on the Mazda3 i and — eventually, we’re told — the Mazda3 s. Click here to stack up the trims and body styles.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe third-generation Mazda3 is lower, wider, shorter and some 100 pounds lighter than its predecessor, and it loses the 2013 model’s grille. Perhaps the worst aspect of the last Mazda3, that grille smiled at you, creepy clown lips and all on the Mazdaspeed edition. Many onlookers frowned. And Derek Jenkins, Mazda’s North American design chief, was one of them. “I’ll be honest, it wasn’t my favorite,” he told reporters at the preview.\n\nJenkins arrived at the Japanese automaker after the car’s development, so blame the last guy. Jenkins’ handiwork appears on the car’s successor, which sports Mazda’s Kodo-themed wings first seen in the Shinari concept in late 2010. Mazda says it moved the A-pillars 3.9 inches backward versus the outgoing car, and the results give the hatchback a cab-rearward, sort of tennis-shoe profile. The sedan wears them better, with short overhangs and a menacing face, but on both cars a front license plate (in states where it’s required) will all but ruin the look. The tail could use more Shinari; it’s a spitting image of the Hyundai Elantra sedan.\n\nHow It Drives\nWith two adults onboard, our 2.0-liter Mazda3 i Touring proved capable, with smooth revving and a decent plateau of usable power. Mazda’s SkyActiv direct-injected four-cylinder makes the same 155 horsepower and 150 pounds-feet of torque as before, but thanks to revised exhaust routing and a higher compression ratio, Mazda says the torque curve is a bit broader. Our tester’s six-speed automatic has its ups and downs; it kicks down smoothly at higher speeds but suffers long, widely spaced low gears. First gear is a lengthy wind-out, and 2nd dumps revs to begin the ascension all over again.\n\nLifted from the Mazda6 and CX-5, the 184-hp, 2.5-liter four-cylinder mates to the same long gearing, but its extra 35 pounds-feet of torque makes the journey up the tach more enjoyable. The extra thrust comes in handy at all speeds, but there isn’t a vast difference between the two. With the 2.5-liter, a Sport mode purports to hold lower gears longer and hastens initial accelerator sensitivity; in our semi-aggressive driving route, I noticed little difference.\n\nMazda ditched last year’s electrohydraulic power steering for a fully electric setup this year, and the results are mixed. Directional changes come with a light touch of the steering wheel, and the wheel avoids feeling buoyant or over-boosted at low speeds. At higher speeds, however, I wanted the car to settle in better; it requires periodic corrections to stay on course.\n\nBoth our testers’ tires — Yokohama Avid S34 P205/60R16s on the Mazda3 i Touring and Dunlop SP Sport 5000 P215/45R18 tires on the Mazda3 s Grand Touring — hugged the road, though the conditions (dry, with temperatures in the 80s) favored traction, both for the Mazda3 and every competing model Mazda furnished. Understeer arrives progressively in the Mazda3, though not to any greater degree with the 2.5-liter engine. The car attacks corners with little body roll and progressive steering feedback, but some may wish for quicker turn-in precision. The nose reacts a tad slowly to initial steering inputs; the 2014 Toyota Corolla is sleepier still, but the Ford Focus and Honda Civic both respond sooner.\n\nThe Mazda3 wins on braking, though, with linear pedal response and little brake fade even after hours of mountain roads. Four-wheel discs are standard, with larger front discs on the Mazda3 s. Some competitors still have rear drums in their base models.\n\nOver the drive route’s few rough patches, the Mazda3 appeared to ride no differently from its firm predecessor. Tuned for the same ride across both drivetrains, the suspension cushions bumps well enough. But it settles into a steady rhythm of mild disruption over undulating pavement despite Mazda increasing this generation’s wheelbase by 2.4 inches, which should aid isolation. The Mazda3 rides a lot like the Civic; the Focus isolates better, and my memory tells me the Chevrolet Cruze — absent from Mazda’s competitive set — does, too. Still, Mazda gets high marks for noise control. With our test car’s 16-inch alloy wheels, the Mazda3 impressed me even at 70 mph. Optional 18-inch alloys kick up more road noise, however.\n\nWith the six-speed automatic, EPA-estimated fuel economy for the Mazda3 i rates 30/41/34 mpg city/highway/combined with the 2.0-liter four-cylinder or 28/39/32 mpg with the 2.5-liter four-cylinder. The manual 2.0-liter gets 29/41/33 mpg. The less-aerodynamic hatchback incurs a slight (zero to 2 mpg) drop in EPA ratings, depending on configuration. Across the board, those figures are competitive with the class — and impressive for the 2.5-liter Mazda3, given its extra power.\n\nMazda’s i-ELOOP system, which stands for Intelligent Energy Loop, is optional on 2.5-liter Grand Touring editions. The system uses the car’s inertia to generate and store electricity in the battery when you’re off the gas, which frees the engine from as much fuel-sucking alternator load during acceleration. It sounds dandy, but EPA mileage ratings reflect no change with i-ELOOP in the sedan and just 1 mpg in hatchback improvement. That’s because “i-ELOOP has less impact on the EPA mileage rating because there is almost no electrical load during the EPA test,” Mazda officials told us, claiming that the system improves real-world mileage 5 percent.\n\nOn the Mazda3 s Grand Touring, i-ELOOP comes with a $1,600 Technology Package that also includes a few high-tech safety features (more on that in the Safety section). Were it packaged alone, I doubt many shoppers would get it.\n\nInterior\nThe cabin materials have improved over the previous Mazda3, with convincing faux-metal details and piano-black trim down the console. Rich-looking, padded surfaces line the upper doors where hard, coarse graining once sat. The cheap headliner and budget rear door trim fall to compact-car norms (certain versions of the Dodge Dart, by comparison, have better consistency), but the Mazda3 competes — and wins — in many other areas.\n\nThe front seats proved firm but comfortable during my daylong drive, which is a big improvement over the last Mazda3’s seats (read our review here). Large bolsters hold you in without pinching your sides — or I’ve lost weight, and I seriously doubt that. The driver’s seat is six-way manual or power adjustable, depending on trim, and it adjusts far enough back for taller drivers; my 6-foot frame had an inch or so of rearward adjustment range to spare. Still, some drivers may want more space for their knees. The Mazda3 feels closer to the Ford Focus, whose high center console confines your right knee. Lower consoles in the Honda Civic and 2014 Toyota Corolla leave more space. Not that Mazda puts the bulk to good use: From the glove compartment to the door pockets and center console, storage areas are small.\n\nLeatherette, or imitation leather, upholstery goes in uplevel 2.0-liter Mazda3 i trims, with real — and perceptibly richer — leather reserved for the 2.5-liter Mazda3 s. The backseat has enough legroom and headroom. But the bench sits low to the floor, which will leave adults’ knees elevated, and a significant center floor hump guarantees discomfort for any fifth passenger. Add it all up and the Mazda3 sedan’s 96.3 cubic feet of cabin volume is near the head of the class (and up 2.2 cubic feet from before), but it doesn’t feel that way.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nInside, an optional dash-mounted, tabletlike 7-inch screen steals the show. Dubbed Mazda Connect, the system has various apps you work through the touch-screen or a knob controller behind the gearshift, which has flanking shortcut keys and a handy volume knob. The optional SD-card navigation system boasts crisp graphics, fast map rendering and swipe-to-move map scrolling. You can also scroll or zoom the map with the knob. It would make a compelling smartphone alternative but for Mazda’s insistence on locking out all map scrolling — with the touch-screen or control knob — while the car is moving. Bah.\n\nIncluded on all 2.5-liter cars, Mazda’s new Active Driving Display motors a clear screen above the gauges to project speed, navigation directions and safety warnings on it. Depending on your height and seating position, the information perches somewhere on the hood or wiper blades in your line of sight — not on the street ahead like a conventional head-up display. In practice, it’s like a smaller version of the Civic’s high-mounted digital speedometer.\n\nCargo & Storage\nTrunk room is up to 12.4 cubic feet in the sedan from last year’s 11.8 cubic feet, but that’s still behind the class. And the Mazda3 hatchback’s expanded cargo space — now 20.2 cubic feet behind the backseat or 47.1 cubic feet with the seats folded — still trails the Hyundai Elantra GT (23.0/51.0 cubic feet) and Subaru Impreza (22.5/52.4) hatchbacks.\n\nA single-piece, folding backseat goes into the Mazda3 i SV sedan; other sedans get 60/40-split folding rear seats with a spacious pass-through.\n\nSafety\nThe redesigned Mazda3 had not been crash-tested as of publication.\n\nAs non-luxury compacts go, the Mazda3’s safety options are top-of-the-line. Touring and Grand Touring models have a blind spot warning system, while a Technology Package on the Mazda 3 s Grand Touring includes automatic high-beam headlights plus lane departure warning and Mazda’s new Smart City Brake Support, which can detect impending objects and initiate automatic braking at speeds below 19 mph. A forward collision warning system also comes with the package; it warns of impending collisions at speeds from 9 to 92 mph, but it does not initiate automatic braking as Smart City Brake Support does.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe Mazda3 base price starts at less than $18,000 with a destination charge, and it comes standard with power windows and locks, air conditioning, remote keyless entry and an iPod/USB-compatible stereo. Add popular commuter-car conveniences — steering-wheel audio controls, Bluetooth cellphone connectivity and streaming audio, cruise control and an automatic transmission — and you’ll spend around $20,300 for a Mazda3 i Sport sedan. That’s about what a similarly equipped Focus runs, but the Corolla, Elantra and Civic offer those features for less; a comparably equipped Cruze, meanwhile, runs nearly $1,000 more.\n\nCheck all the factory options and a loaded Mazda3 s Grand Touring hatchback — with heated leather seats, a moonroof, Bose audio, navigation, keyless access and all the safety tech — tops $29,000.\n\nOutright utility may still come up short, but other strengths give the Mazda3 reason to push hard for a seat at the table. The prior generation was far and away Mazda’s best-seller, outselling every Mazda car plus the CX-9 SUV and Mazda5 minivan combined through August 2013. Still, its sales volume can’t hold a candle to the compact-car segment’s five best-sellers: the Chevrolet Cruze, Ford Focus, Honda Civic, Hyundai Elantra and Toyota Corolla, listed alphabetically. Those five combined for nearly two-thirds of all non-luxury compact sales, leaving more than half a dozen other nameplates to fight for the remnant.\n\nBut four of the five mainstays are approaching middle age, with redesigns dating back to 2011 or 2012, and Mazda hopes more than a few shoppers will notice the redesigned Mazda3.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Endowed with the model’s first turbocharged gas engine since the Mazdaspeed3 left showrooms early last decade, the 2021 Mazda3 can muscle past slower traffic with little effort — a commanding, if reserved, degree of performance that should raise the car’s appeal among Mazda fans. Still, broader obstacles remain for mass-market audiences.\n\nVersus the competition: The Mazda3 is among the most fun-to-drive cars in its class, and a new engine only furthers that strength. But for daily driving, many competitors are easier to live with.\n\nAs before, the 2021 Mazda3 is available as a sedan or hatchback, with standard front-wheel drive or optional all-wheel drive. Last year’s four-cylinder engine carries over for most models, but Mazda bookends it with two new ones: a smaller four-cylinder in base trim sedans, and the turbocharged four-cylinder in high-end sedans and hatchbacks.\n\nRelated: 2019 Mazda3 Review: Niche Appeal\n\nSeven trim levels (base, S, Select, Preferred, Premium, Turbo and Turbo Premium Plus) run the gamut from the low-$20,000s to the mid-$30,000s with factory options; automatic transmissions come on all except the Premium hatchback, which is available with a manual. Stack the gang up here, or compare the 2020 and 2021 Mazda3 here.\n\nWe drove a Mazda3 Turbo Premium Plus hatchback, though we’ve also evaluated the current generation, both in sedan and hatchback form, with the mid-level engine.\n\nPowered Up\n\nAlthough we haven’t tested the base engine, its limited availability means just a sliver of shoppers will buy it. Most Mazda3 examples are likely to have the 2.5-liter four-cylinder, which was the only engine available in the 2019-20 Mazda3. It’s a capable, smooth-revving engine, though tall gearing from Mazda’s six-speed automatic transmission limits some of its potential. Accelerate from a stop up to highway speeds, and it’s a long climb through 2nd and 3rd gear — but if you hit the gas while already in motion to tack on more speed, the same automatic readily downshifts without undue delay. You hate it, you love it.\n\nI’ll get to the turbo four-cylinder in a moment, but first some context on how it stacks up:\n\n2.0-liter (FWD base sedan only): 155 horsepower, 150 pounds-feet of torque; six-speed automatic only\n2.5-liter (FWD or AWD, sedan or hatchback, most trim levels): 186 hp, 186 pounds-feet of torque; six-speed manual or six-speed automatic\nTurbocharged 2.5-liter (AWD only, sedan or hatchback, Turbo or Turbo Premium Plus trims): 250 hp and 320 pounds-feet of torque (using 93-octane premium gas) or 227 hp and 310 pounds-feet of torque (using 87-octane gas); six-speed automatic only\n\nOur test car came filled with 93-octane premium fuel, according to the fleet company that dropped it off. In any case, the drivetrain behaves in some respects like a diesel engine, with torque aplenty for vigorous starts but modest power progression once you get past 4,000 rpm or so. It’s not quite a plateau — some additional power still comes if you rev it out — but the drivetrain feels best suited to muscle past slower traffic as you apply steady gas, as opposed to flying around near redline with your foot to the firewall. Accelerate while already in motion and the transmission resists downshifts notably more than with the non-turbo 2.5-liter, but the Mazda3 Turbo’s vast torque and responsive accelerator absolves it.\n\nRide and Handling\n\nOur impressions from when we first drove the current-generation Mazda3 still stand, which is to say ride quality is polished but firm. Although the suspension employs a cheaper torsion beam setup in back — as opposed to the independent rear suspension offered on previous generations of the Mazda3 — the chassis maintains good body control and clean, reverb-free shock absorption. But tuning is decidedly firm and probably more than what most compact-car shoppers will tolerate. Mazda cites a retuned front suspension with stiffer springs for the Turbo, and it does little to change the car’s character; softer-riding rivals like the Nissan Sentra, Toyota Corolla and Volkswagen Jetta seem better suited for the daily grind. The Mazda3 improves on the Honda Civic’s perpetual bounciness, but that isn’t saying much. Mazda shouldn’t wait for a full redesign to revisit suspension tuning.\n\nLike the Civic, the Mazda3 redeems itself on the handling front, perhaps even more so in the Turbo. Mazda claims the AWD system on Turbo models can distribute more torque to the rear wheels, and the car indeed feels more neutral around sweeping corners than its non-turbo sibling. You can slide the tail a touch with aggressive mid-corner gas, something the non-turbo Mazda3’s AWD all but prohibited, and understeer remains well contained throughout. \n\nMazda claims retuned steering hardware for sharper response on all Mazda3 variants for 2021. The ratio still isn’t as quick as some rivals’, but feedback remains very good. Flinging the Mazda3 around cloverleaf sweepers is a lively, communicative experience — an increasingly rare quality these days, even among sporty cars.\n\nInterior and Tech\n\nCabin materials in the well-equipped Mazda3 we evaluated were exemplary for this class. Mazda’s optional leather upholstery would feel at home in any entry-level luxury car — cloth and leatherette (imitation leather) are also available — and generous padding covers the armrests and areas your knees touch. Controls feel meticulous all around, and most surfaces — save a low-budget headliner — appear universally rich. Impressively, the backseat sees little drop-off in materials quality, a widespread practice among Mazda’s rivals.\n\nIn contrast to all that, the Mazda3’s multimedia system remains a weakness. It constitutes a high-mounted dashboard screen measuring a healthy 8.8 inches diagonally, but the ultra-wide aspect ratio limits overall display size with just 3 inches of screen height. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto come on all but the base sedan, and CarPlay leverages the screen’s full width, but the backup camera does not. What’s more, the screen isn’t a touchscreen — not that such functionality would help much, as it’s mounted too far forward to easily reach — and requires a knob-based controller behind the gear selector. For straightforward user-friendliness, that’s a step backward; the related Mazda CX-30 SUV has the same system, and it ranked last for usability of controls in a recent four-car comparison we conducted.\n\nSeating and Cargo Space\n\nCraftsmanship notwithstanding, the Mazda3 isn’t particularly roomy or easy to see out of. The driver’s seat sits relatively low to the ground, and larger drivers will no doubt find the space narrow between the center console and doors. The hatchback blocks over-the-shoulder views with giant roof pillars and a tiny rear window; the sedan has mercifully thinner pillars, though rear glass is still undersized. \n\nBackseat knee clearance is tight, and we measured a modest 13.1 cubic feet of cargo volume behind it. That’s through Cars.com’s independent cargo measurements, not manufacturer-advertised specs, which we’ve found unreliable. Versus the Mazda3 sedan, the hatchback carries inherent advantages to maximizing cargo space when you fold the backseat down, but for those who need to carry passengers and cargo, the sedan may have considerably more room. Although we didn’t have access to a 2021 model-year sedan to measure cargo space with our latest methodology, we found the current-generation sedan’s trunk roughly a third deeper than the hatchback’s cargo area — with similar width and height to the tops of the seatbacks — when we tested both body styles two model years ago. (There is more space above the backrests in a hatchback, but loading above this height compromises cargo containment and rearward visibility, both safety hazards.)\n\nThat’s not surprising. Indulge me a minute on this: Manufacturer-stated cargo specs usually employ separate methodology between hatchbacks and sedans, rendering spec comparisons tenuous at best. The Mazda3 hatchback isn’t necessarily an outlier, with as-tested cargo volume similar to that of most entry-level SUVs in our recent comparison. But you’ll find more cargo volume in many sedans, and less in many hatchbacks and SUVs, when measured the same way — which is to say, up to the tops of the seatbacks. With apples-to-apples methodology, the current Civic, Sentra and Corolla sedans have some 40-50% more usable cargo volume than a Mazda3 hatchback.\n\nShould You Buy a Mazda3?\n\nWith the base 2.0-liter four-cylinder, the Mazda3 starts at $21,445 with destination, which is competitive for the class. Standard features include the automatic transmission, 16-inch alloy wheels, one-touch power windows all around and the 8.8-inch multimedia system, albeit without CarPlay or Android Auto. Also standard are stop-and-go adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning with steering assist, and forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking. The well-rated AEB helped the 2020 sedan and hatchback both earn top ratings from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, but IIHS has yet to publish ratings for the 2021 model as of this writing. When available, the 2021 report and its changes, if any, can be found by searching for “Mazda 3” here. \n\nHigher trim levels, including all hatchbacks, all have the smartphone integration and 2.5-liter engine. Spend more and you can get heated leatherette or leather seats, a moonroof, dual-zone climate control, a power driver’s seat and Bose premium audio. Newly optional for 2021 are rear automatic braking, a 360-degree camera system and Traffic Jam Assist, a low-speed lane-centering steering system that’s now here following availability overseas.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nThose who want the Mazda3 Turbo will shell out at least $30,845 for the sedan, with the hatchback running another $1,000. Turbo models with the Premium Plus addition (leather, Traffic Jam Assist and the safety extras, in-dash navigation and more) edge close to $35,000, with prices spiraling past that once you add premium paint and various cosmetic enhancements. That kind of money falls somewhere between performance mass-market compacts and entry-level luxury sedans.\n\nAs such, there’s a Mazda3 for many performance thresholds. A few years into its fourth generation, Mazda’s least expensive car remains a fun-to-drive choice among compact sedans and hatchbacks. The turbo engine extends the spectrum, though it doesn’t change the nameplate’s limited appeal for left-brained shoppers. As I said when the current generation arrived on scene for the 2019 model year, the Mazda3 seemed destined for niche appeal. The Turbo does much to add appeal — less so to expand the niche.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in October 2013 about the 2014 Mazda3. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2015, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe redesigned 2014 Mazda3 is far from perfect, but it gives compact-car shoppers an alluring choice outside and in, with a satisfying mix of efficiency and performance.\n\nMazda’s redesigned commuter car remains cramped, and a drive along the mountain roads northeast of San Diego at a media preview hosted by Mazda suggests little advancement in ride quality. But the automaker should win new buyers with this redesign. As before, the Mazda3 comes in hatchback and sedan body styles; expect a high-performance Mazdaspeed3 version in the coming months or years (Mazda officials were still mum on details). Click here to stack up the 2014 and 2013 Mazda3.\n\nSedans and hatchbacks come in “i” and “s” versions that signal a 2.0-liter or 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine, respectively. Both employ Mazda’s SkyActiv drivetrain technology — a first for the 2.5-liter — for EPA combined city/highway mileage estimates in the low-to-mid 30s. The Mazda3 i comes in SV (sedan only), Sport, Touring and Grand Touring variants, while the Mazda3 s comes in Touring and Grand Touring editions. I evaluated an i Touring sedan and s Grand Touring hatchback, both with the six-speed automatic transmission. You can also get a six-speed manual on the Mazda3 i and — eventually, we’re told — the Mazda3 s. Click here to stack up the trims and body styles.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe third-generation Mazda3 is lower, wider, shorter and some 100 pounds lighter than its predecessor, and it loses the 2013 model’s grille. Perhaps the worst aspect of the last Mazda3, that grille smiled at you, creepy clown lips and all on the Mazdaspeed edition. Many onlookers frowned. And Derek Jenkins, Mazda’s North American design chief, was one of them. “I’ll be honest, it wasn’t my favorite,” he told reporters at the preview.\n\nJenkins arrived at the Japanese automaker after the car’s development, so blame the last guy. Jenkins’ handiwork appears on the car’s successor, which sports Mazda’s Kodo-themed wings first seen in the Shinari concept in late 2010. Mazda says it moved the A-pillars 3.9 inches backward versus the outgoing car, and the results give the hatchback a cab-rearward, sort of tennis-shoe profile. The sedan wears them better, with short overhangs and a menacing face, but on both cars a front license plate (in states where it’s required) will all but ruin the look. The tail could use more Shinari; it’s a spitting image of the Hyundai Elantra sedan.\n\nHow It Drives\nWith two adults onboard, our 2.0-liter Mazda3 i Touring proved capable, with smooth revving and a decent plateau of usable power. Mazda’s SkyActiv direct-injected four-cylinder makes the same 155 horsepower and 150 pounds-feet of torque as before, but thanks to revised exhaust routing and a higher compression ratio, Mazda says the torque curve is a bit broader. Our tester’s six-speed automatic has its ups and downs; it kicks down smoothly at higher speeds but suffers long, widely spaced low gears. First gear is a lengthy wind-out, and 2nd dumps revs to begin the ascension all over again.\n\nLifted from the Mazda6 and CX-5, the 184-hp, 2.5-liter four-cylinder mates to the same long gearing, but its extra 35 pounds-feet of torque makes the journey up the tach more enjoyable. The extra thrust comes in handy at all speeds, but there isn’t a vast difference between the two. With the 2.5-liter, a Sport mode purports to hold lower gears longer and hastens initial accelerator sensitivity; in our semi-aggressive driving route, I noticed little difference.\n\nMazda ditched last year’s electrohydraulic power steering for a fully electric setup this year, and the results are mixed. Directional changes come with a light touch of the steering wheel, and the wheel avoids feeling buoyant or over-boosted at low speeds. At higher speeds, however, I wanted the car to settle in better; it requires periodic corrections to stay on course.\n\nBoth our testers’ tires — Yokohama Avid S34 P205/60R16s on the Mazda3 i Touring and Dunlop SP Sport 5000 P215/45R18 tires on the Mazda3 s Grand Touring — hugged the road, though the conditions (dry, with temperatures in the 80s) favored traction, both for the Mazda3 and every competing model Mazda furnished. Understeer arrives progressively in the Mazda3, though not to any greater degree with the 2.5-liter engine. The car attacks corners with little body roll and progressive steering feedback, but some may wish for quicker turn-in precision. The nose reacts a tad slowly to initial steering inputs; the 2014 Toyota Corolla is sleepier still, but the Ford Focus and Honda Civic both respond sooner.\n\nThe Mazda3 wins on braking, though, with linear pedal response and little brake fade even after hours of mountain roads. Four-wheel discs are standard, with larger front discs on the Mazda3 s. Some competitors still have rear drums in their base models.\n\nOver the drive route’s few rough patches, the Mazda3 appeared to ride no differently from its firm predecessor. Tuned for the same ride across both drivetrains, the suspension cushions bumps well enough. But it settles into a steady rhythm of mild disruption over undulating pavement despite Mazda increasing this generation’s wheelbase by 2.4 inches, which should aid isolation. The Mazda3 rides a lot like the Civic; the Focus isolates better, and my memory tells me the Chevrolet Cruze — absent from Mazda’s competitive set — does, too. Still, Mazda gets high marks for noise control. With our test car’s 16-inch alloy wheels, the Mazda3 impressed me even at 70 mph. Optional 18-inch alloys kick up more road noise, however.\n\nWith the six-speed automatic, EPA-estimated gas mileage for the Mazda3 i rates 30/41/34 mpg city/highway/combined with the 2.0-liter four-cylinder or 28/39/32 mpg with the 2.5-liter four-cylinder. The manual 2.0-liter gets 29/41/33 mpg. The less-aerodynamic hatchback incurs a slight (zero to 2 mpg) drop in EPA ratings, depending on configuration. Across the board, those figures are competitive with the class — and impressive for the 2.5-liter Mazda3, given its extra power.\n\nMazda’s i-ELOOP system, which stands for Intelligent Energy Loop, is optional on 2.5-liter Grand Touring editions. The system uses the car’s inertia to generate and store electricity in the battery when you’re off the gas, which frees the engine from as much fuel-sucking alternator load during acceleration. It sounds dandy, but EPA mileage ratings reflect no change with i-ELOOP in the sedan and just 1 mpg in hatchback improvement. That’s because “i-ELOOP has less impact on the EPA mileage rating because there is almost no electrical load during the EPA test,” Mazda officials told us, claiming that the system improves real-world mileage 5 percent.\n\nOn the Mazda3 s Grand Touring, i-ELOOP comes with a $1,600 Technology Package that also includes a few high-tech safety features (more on that in the Safety section). Were it packaged alone, I doubt many shoppers would get it.\n\nInterior\nThe cabin materials have improved over the previous Mazda3, with convincing faux-metal details and piano-black trim down the console. Rich-looking, padded surfaces line the upper doors where hard, coarse graining once sat. The cheap headliner and budget rear door trim fall to compact-car norms (certain versions of the Dodge Dart, by comparison, have better consistency), but the Mazda3 competes — and wins — in many other areas.\n\nThe front seats proved firm but comfortable during my daylong drive, which is a big improvement over the last Mazda3’s seats (read our review here). Large bolsters hold you in without pinching your sides — or I’ve lost weight, and I seriously doubt that. The driver’s seat is six-way manual or power adjustable, depending on trim, and it adjusts far enough back for taller drivers; my 6-foot frame had an inch or so of rearward adjustment range to spare. Still, some drivers may want more space for their knees. The Mazda3 feels closer to the Ford Focus, whose high center console confines your right knee. Lower consoles in the Honda Civic and 2014 Toyota Corolla leave more space. Not that Mazda puts the bulk to good use: From the glove compartment to the door pockets and center console, storage areas are small.\n\nLeatherette, or imitation leather, upholstery goes in uplevel 2.0-liter Mazda3 i trims, with real — and perceptibly richer — leather reserved for the 2.5-liter Mazda3 s. The backseat has enough legroom and headroom. But the bench sits low to the floor, which will leave adults’ knees elevated, and a significant center floor hump guarantees discomfort for any fifth passenger. Add it all up and the Mazda3 sedan’s 96.3 cubic feet of cabin volume is near the head of the class (and up 2.2 cubic feet from before), but it doesn’t feel that way.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nInside, an optional dash-mounted, tabletlike 7-inch screen steals the show. Dubbed Mazda Connect, the system has various apps you work through the touch-screen or a knob controller behind the gearshift, which has flanking shortcut keys and a handy volume knob. The optional SD-card navigation system boasts crisp graphics, fast map rendering and swipe-to-move map scrolling. You can also scroll or zoom the map with the knob. It would make a compelling smartphone alternative but for Mazda’s insistence on locking out all map scrolling — with the touch-screen or control knob — while the car is moving. Bah.\n\nIncluded on all 2.5-liter cars, Mazda’s new Active Driving Display motors a clear screen above the gauges to project speed, navigation directions and safety warnings on it. Depending on your height and seating position, the information perches somewhere on the hood or wiper blades in your line of sight — not on the street ahead like a conventional head-up display. In practice, it’s like a smaller version of the Civic’s high-mounted digital speedometer.\n\nCargo & Storage\nTrunk room is up to 12.4 cubic feet in the sedan from last year’s 11.8 cubic feet, but that’s still behind the class. And the Mazda3 hatchback’s expanded cargo space — now 20.2 cubic feet behind the backseat or 47.1 cubic feet with the seats folded — still trails the Hyundai Elantra GT (23.0/51.0 cubic feet) and Subaru Impreza (22.5/52.4) hatchbacks.\n\nA single-piece, folding backseat goes into the Mazda3 i SV sedan; other sedans get 60/40-split folding rear seats with a spacious pass-through.\n\nSafety\nThe redesigned Mazda3 had not been crash-tested as of publication.\n\nAs non-luxury compacts go, the Mazda3’s safety options impress. Touring and Grand Touring models have a blind spot warning system, while a Technology Package on the Mazda3 s Grand Touring includes automatic high-beam headlights plus lane departure warning and Mazda’s new Smart City Brake Support, which can detect impending objects and initiate automatic braking at speeds below 19 mph. A forward collision warning system also comes with the package; it warns of impending collisions at speeds from 9 to 92 mph, but it does not initiate automatic braking as Smart City Brake Support does.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe Mazda3 starts at less than $18,000 with a destination charge, and it comes standard with power windows and locks, air conditioning, remote keyless entry and an iPod/USB-compatible stereo. Add popular commuter-car conveniences — steering-wheel audio controls, Bluetooth cellphone connectivity and streaming audio, cruise control and an automatic transmission — and you’ll spend around $20,300 for a Mazda3 i Sport sedan. That’s about what a similarly equipped Focus runs, but the Corolla, Elantra and Civic offer those features for less; a comparably equipped Cruze, meanwhile, runs nearly $1,000 more.\n\nCheck all the factory options and a loaded Mazda3 s Grand Touring hatchback — with heated leather seats, a moonroof, Bose audio, navigation, keyless access and all the safety tech — tops $29,000.\n\nOutright utility may still come up short, but other strengths give the Mazda3 reason to push hard for a seat at the table. The prior generation was far and away Mazda’s best-seller, outselling every Mazda car plus the CX-9 SUV and Mazda5 minivan combined through August 2013. Still, its sales volume can’t hold a candle to the compact-car segment’s five best-sellers: the Chevrolet Cruze, Ford Focus, Honda Civic, Hyundai Elantra and Toyota Corolla, listed alphabetically. Those five combined for nearly two-thirds of all non-luxury compact sales, leaving more than half a dozen other nameplates to fight for the remnant.\n\nBut four of the five mainstays are approaching middle age, with redesigns dating back to 2011 or 2012, and Mazda hopes more than a few shoppers will notice the redesigned Mazda3.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nMazda’s larger, more powerful replacements for the departed Protege sedan and Protege5 hatchback went on sale in the 2004 model year. Built on the same platform as the Volvo S40, the compact, front-wheel-drive Mazda3 displayed entirely different styling. A 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine goes into the Mazda3 i sedan, while the Mazda3 s sedan and hatchback hold a more powerful 2.3-liter four-cylinder. Competitors include the Honda Civic and Volkswagen Jetta.\n\nThe Mazda3 received minor modifications for the 2007 model year. The front bumper was redesigned and fitted with square fog lamps, and the 16- and 17-inch aluminum alloy wheels also got a new look. The audio system has a standard auxiliary audio input for MP3 players. Both the sedan and hatchback have rear armrests with cupholders, and the i sedan has zebra-striped wood-finish dash trim. For 2008, s Sport models have standard side-impact and side curtain airbags.\n\nExterior\nComparatively upright in profile, the Mazda3 is built with a wide track and a relatively long (103.9-inch) wheelbase for its size. A Sport Package that includes sport bumpers, side skirts, 17-inch alloy wheels and fog lamps is available on s sedans and standard on s hatchbacks.\n\nSteel wheels hold 15-inch tires on the Mazda3 i sedan; the Mazda3 s sedan gets 16-inch alloy wheels, while the Mazda3 s hatchback rolls on 17-inch rubber. The wagonlike hatchback has small triangular rear quarter windows. Sedans get a short but high rear deck.\n\nInterior\nUp to five people can fit inside the Mazda3. The steering column tilts and telescopes, and the instruments sit in a trio of round, recessed nacelles. A ratchet-type mechanism permits seat adjustment, allowing the cushion and seatback to move up and down together. Placing the rear-suspension coil springs beneath the floor increases the hatchback’s rear storage space.\n\nThe s Grand Touring model includes heated leather seats, automatic headlights, automatic rain-sensing wipers and a trip computer. A moonroof, a custom-tuned Bose audio system and Sirius Satellite Radio are optional.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe 2.0-liter four-cylinder in the Mazda3 i has variable valve timing and develops 148 horsepower (144 hp in PZEV form). The Mazda3 s uses a 2.3-liter four-cylinder that pumps out 156 hp. A five-speed manual gearbox is standard, and a four-speed automatic transmission with a manual-shift provision is optional for the Mazda3 i. The 2.3-liter engine can mate with a five-speed automatic.\n\nSafety\nSide-impact and side curtain airbags are optional. All-disc antilock brakes with brake assist are standard on s models and optional on i models. Traction control and an electronic stability system are available on s models.\n\nDriving Impressions\nThe easy-to-drive Mazda3 handles more adeptly than most rivals. The automatic transmission delivers quick, smooth responses. Performance with the larger engine falls short of some sporty compacts, but it will satisfy most drivers. That engine is generally quiet, but it emits a fair amount of blare when pushed. With an easy-shifting manual gearbox and a well-behaved clutch, even the Mazda3 i with the smaller engine feels more spirited than an upper-level model with the automatic.\n\nAlthough the front seats are nicely shaped, their seatbacks are on the hard side. Rear legroom is limited, but foot space is good. Headroom is average in the rear but meager in the center position. Visibility is good. The Mazda3 instruments are difficult to see on dark days but are lit nicely at night.",

      "expert_review": "Thanks to new drivetrains, the 2012 Mazda Mazda3 has fuel economy ratings as high as 40 mpg highway. That’s a big gain over last year that addresses a major shortcoming in the brand’s most popular car. After all, at least five 40-mpg competitors will be on sale by this summer. The bandwagon is unstoppable, and now Mazda has a seat on board.\n\nThe 2012 Mazda3’s refinement issues will linger until the car gets a full redesign, but its driving fun and fuel efficiency keep the car competitive.\n\nThe Mazda3 comes as a sedan or hatchback with four available engines and essentially 11 versions, including the turbocharged Mazdaspeed3. Two trim levels have the suffix “SkyActiv,” which represents high-mileage technology in the form of the company’s newest four-cylinder engine and/or select transmissions and other technologies. As is the case in most competing models, the highest mileage figures come in the more expensive sedan trim levels. The most affordable hatchback is efficient, but the base price for this body style is more than $4,000 higher than the base sedan’s.\n\nIn any configuration, the Mazda’s firm ride will turn off some shoppers, but the mileage makeover breathes new life into a model that has never emphasized efficiency. Click here to compare drivetrains, or here to compare the 2012 Mazda3 with the 2011. We tested a stick-shift 2012 Mazda3 hatchback with the SkyActiv four-cylinder. We’ve driven the other engines in years past.\n\nCapable Power\nThe Mazda Mazda3’s two base trims, SV and Sport, retain last year’s 148-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder. It moves well enough, helped by well-spaced gear ratios in the optional five-speed automatic transmission. A five-speed manual is standard.\n\nThe 155-hp, direct-inject SkyActiv engine, also a 2.0-liter four-cylinder, adds a modest 7 hp and — more importantly — 10 percent more passing-lane torque than its port-injected peer. It can be paired with either an automatic or a manual, both with six speeds. The SkyActiv engine comes in handy on the interstate, where our stick-shift test car accelerated 10 mph in 6th gear at a reasonable pace. The base 2.0-liter — and a lot of four-cylinder competitors — needs a downshift in order to speed up on the highway. Around town, the 2.0-liter engines feel similar to each other, except that the SkyActiv’s slow initial accelerator response translates to anemic start-offs. The Mazda3’s optional 2.5-liter four-cylinder has gutsier midrange power that makes it quicker than most commuter cars, if less efficient.\n\nThe SkyActiv sedan is rated an EPA-estimated 28/40 mpg city/highway with the automatic, 27/39 with the stick. The SkyActiv-equipped hatchback has identical city numbers but is 1 mpg less efficient on the highway with either transmission. Still, that’s 2 to 7 mpg better than the base 2.0-liter, depending on trim, and 6 to 11 mpg better than the 2.5-liter Mazda3. All three engines use regular gas.\n\nThe Mazdaspeed3 comes only with a stick shift and sports a turbocharged four-cylinder that sprints to extralegal speeds. Its refinement, however, is disappointing. The car’s 263-hp engine feels old-school, with noticeable turbo lag followed by power that’s too peaky to savor. Dig deep into the gas, and the tach needle flies toward its 6,700-rpm redline at breakneck speed. For its $24,000 price, the Mazdaspeed3 is a go-fast bargain — our friends at “MotorWeek” hit 60 mph in it in just 5.2 seconds — but more low-rev torque with longer gearing would help drivers enjoy the experience a bit more. So would addressing the car’s torque steer, which becomes a major force on hard takeoffs. Such is the case in powerful front-drive cars, but some manage it better than this one. The Speed3 requires premium gas and is rated 18/25 mpg.\n\nHandling & Ride\nIn the Mazda3, performance trumps comfort — but the payoff is impressive. Editors enjoyed our test car’s sharp front-wheel steering and linear braking. The nose pushes in sweeping corners, but the tail breaks free soon after, allowing the driver to manage the car’s rotation. The Mazdaspeed3, in contrast, slings more fun-sapping weight over the front axle, which cuts its drifting potential. Its stickier Dunlop SP Sport P225/40R18 summer tires eventually cede grip up front, but the tail stays put, refusing to let you easily slide on all fours.\n\nThe Mazdaspeed3’s choppy ride can be punishing over potholes, and even the base Mazda3 trims ride firmly. On the highway, crosswinds require constant steering corrections, and the suspension in our 2012 test car lost its cool time and again over broken pavement. Road and wind noise, in contrast, were low; I just wish the suspension were as refined. Competitors like the Chevrolet Cruze and Hyundai Elantra marry ride and handling better. The Mazda still wins for outright fun, but comfort-minded drivers should look elsewhere.\n\nThe Inside\nCabin quality is competitive overall, but cars like the Cruze, Elantra and the forthcoming Dodge Dart are pushing ahead. The Mazda’s dashboard panels have upscale textures and padded surfaces; unfortunately, the doors and anything below eye level look considerably cheaper. Still, most controls are high quality, and the dashboard’s shallow rake leaves the interior feeling roomy.\n\nOur test car’s basic cloth seats felt over-bolstered, leaving my back sore after a few hours behind the wheel. My 5-foot-11 frame could have used another inch or so of rearward travel, too. Such limitations preserve some backseat room, and anyone sitting back there will need it. The Mazda3’s legroom dimensions are misleading: There’s an alleged 36.2 inches in both the sedan and hatchback, which would put it near the top of the segment. In reality, though, it’s snug back there; rear seats in the Dart, Honda Civic, Kia Forte and Volkswagen Jetta feel roomier.\n\nTrunk volume in the Mazda3 sedan is just 11.8 cubic feet; the Cruze and Jetta offer 15 cubic feet or more. The Mazda3 hatchback offers a more usable 17 cubic feet behind the backseat, with 42.8 cubic feet of maximum volume with the backseat folded down. Both figures are competitive among hatchbacks.\n\nSafety, Features & Pricing\nReliability for the Mazda3 has been well above average, and the car scored top marks in all crash tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, earning the car Top Safety Pick status. But the Mazda3’s side-impact scores in the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s revamped side-impact tests returned just three out of five stars. Standard features include six airbags and the required antilock brakes and electronic stability system. Click here for a full list, or here to see our evaluation of child-seat accommodations.\n\nThe Mazda Mazda3 sedan comes in six trim levels. The SV and Sport have the base 2.0-liter engine. Touring and Grand Touring trims come with the SkyActiv-drive 2.0-liter, while “s” versions of the Touring and Grand Touring have the 2.5-liter four-cylinder. The hatchback skips the base engine by starting at the Touring trim level, but 2012 marks the first year this body style is offered with a smaller engine — in SkyActiv form — rather than just the 2.5-liter. The Mazdaspeed3, available only as a hatchback, comes in Touring trim. Standard features on the SV sedan include power mirrors and windows, plus a CD stereo with steering-wheel audio controls and an auxiliary MP3 jack. Other trims add power door locks, air conditioning and keyless entry. Load the Mazda3 up, and you can get heated leather seats, Bose audio, dual-zone automatic climate control and a moonroof.\n\nMazda3 in the Market\nWill shoppers buy the new SkyActiv versions of the Mazda 3? I think so. The mileage gains are enough to take some of the sting out of the price difference in the sedan, and the engine effectively lowers the price of the hatchback by giving buyers a cheaper alternative to the 2.5-liter engine. Either way, the fuel-efficient 2.0-liter should be easy to find: Just over half of the Mazda3s listed in Cars.com’s new-car inventory are SkyActiv trims. In the past, the Mazda3 has outsold bit players in the commuter segment, but shoppers have preferred the Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla and Chevrolet Cruze — all by more than a 2-to-1 margin. Gas mileage has been a shortfall for the nimble Mazda3; I suspect the revamped drivetrains will narrow the divide.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",
