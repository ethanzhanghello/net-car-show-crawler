      "expert_review": "Luxury is perception. Consider this week’s test car, the 2001 Mazda Millenia S sedan. Mazda executives call it a “luxury” automobile. That’s because they are seeking status for their flagship car. Auto industry analysts and Mazda’s rivals call the Millenia “near-luxury.” That’s because they need to discriminate, or, as they put it, “differentiate.”\n\nIt’s a matter of class, and class in the auto business operates the same as it does in larger society. It runs on cash and caste.\n\nFor example, analysts, who care mostly about money, tend to classify as “near-luxury,” or “entry-level luxury,” cars that cost $25,000 to $35,000. But they seldom apply those terms to similarly priced pickup trucks or minivans. That’s because pickups and minivans — regardless of price, accoutrements and the neighborhoods in which they are parked — belong to inescapable castes. Pickups are working-class, and minivans are middle-class. There is no Rolls-Royce minivan.\n\nSport-utility vehicles, however, defy classification. They belong to their own world. There are small, compact/midsize and full-size sport-utes. And there is an elite $50,000-and-over group — such as the Cadillac Escalade, Range Rover 4.6 HSE and Lexus LX 470 — that analysts and automakers call “luxury.” But that’s because they’re so gilded it’s silly to call them trucks.\n\nBut, as is the case with pickups and minivans, “near-luxury” is seldom used in connection with sport-utility models. That term is reserved for cars such as the Millenia S. It’s the cash-caste thing again.\n\nThe Millenia S, priced at $31,025, is Japanese. Though it is politically incorrect to say so, the Japanese must always do a little extra to wear the “luxury” badge. They are not Europeans, after all.\n\nThe Japanese do not make Bentley, BMW, Mercedes-Benz or Jaguar — brands that historically symbolized “luxury” in the global automotive market.\n\nEven the least expensive members of that privileged group, including cars such as the Mercedes-Benz C-Class ($30,000 to $37,000), get favorable nomenclature. They often are referred to as “affordable luxury,” which is a tad more positive than “near-luxury.”\n\nTo be “luxury” and Japanese means being Acura, Lexus or Infiniti, three Japanese brands that often have out-Europed the Europeans in terms of styling, quality, performance and creature comforts.\n\nIt doesn’t cut it to be Mazda — Japanese and blue-collar. That’s too bad, because the Millenia S, as a result, is a luxury car that gets little respect.\n\nFor example, spectator response to the 2001 Millenia, the first major rework of the car since its 1994 introduction, was a combination of approbation and dismissal. They marveled over its sleek exterior design, commented favorably on its two-tone leather interior, and applauded the power and smoothness of its 210-horsepower V-6 engine.\n\nBut they voided those credits w ith shoulder shrugs and verbal put-downs upon learning the Millenia’s corporate identity.\n\nTheir reactions highlighted the wisdom of Mazda’s Japanese rivals, which set up separate luxury-car divisions in the United States. Honda begat Acura, Nissan begat Infiniti, and Toyota begat Lexus — all because they believed they couldn’t get luxury sales in America with their original corporate names and faces.\n\nMazda flirted with the idea of establishing a premium division but considered it too costly. Now it is paying the price, in both prestige and dignity.\n\nFor example, despite the car’s intrinsic competence and value in the luxury arena, Mazda’s marketers feel the need to emphasize the Millenia’s “European flair” to woo buyers for the car. The automotive ruling class, including the Japanese members, feels no comparable need.",

      "expert_review": "Never one to give up on a good thing, Mazda Motors has a new addition to its 1995 lineup, the Millenia.\n\nIt’s an outgrowth of the canceled Amati program, which Mazda had proposed as a new and separate luxury-car division.\n\nSo the Millenia is a highly styled quality sedan with a high degree of technical innovation in its top-of-the-line S model.\n\nThe Millenia S is powered by Mazda’s unique Miller-cycle engine, a powerplant that offers more power, better fuel economy and reduced emissions than an engine with less piston displacement. The Millenia and the Millenia with Leather models are powered by Mazda’s 2.5-liter (152-cubic inch) four- cam 24-valve V6, which is good for 170 horsepower.\n\nThe Millenia is offered at three price levels, ranging from $25,995 to $31,400.\n\n]The basic styling theme and general dimensions are the same, with minor differences in items such as gear ratios, track widths and curb weights.\n\nThe Miller-cycle engine has 2.3 liters (138 cubic inches) of displacement and develops 210 horsepower and 210 foot-pounds of torque. Obviously, it’s a far more interesting development than the 2.5-liter, and was in the Millenia S that Tom Roush, head of Tom Roush Lincoln-Mercury-Mazda, provided for a test car.\n\nThe car spoke of class the minute you opened the door, with a leather interior, a full complement of power accessories and comfortable driver/passenger room both front and back.\n\nThese days, there really isn’t much difference in operating a domestic automobile and an import. So all levers, switches, stalks and other controls were right where one expected to find them.\n\nThe power seating lets you find virtually any driving position. And a very advanced power/tilt system that raised or lowered the steering column in infinite degrees lets you position the wheel wherever you want it. This is a convenience accessory that domestic manufacturers would do well to incorporate.\n\nDriving the S was like driving any better-class automobile. There was nothing to learn; you just get in and go. But when you begin giving that Miller-cycle engine the throttle, you start going a whole lot better than many expensive sedans.\n\nThe Miller cycle is the creation of an American engineer named Ralph H. Miller, who devised in the 1940s a system to increase an engine’s operating efficiency.\n\nAn oversimplification of his principle is that the intake valves close after a piston has gone past bottom dead center and is about 20 percent into its upward compression cycle.\n\nA combination of a lower compression ratio and the forced feeding of a high-intensity, relatively cool air charge from a Lysholm screw-type supercharger produces high thermal efficiency without heat- related detonation (knocking). The result is high horsepower and torque from smaller amounts of engine displacement.\n\nThe V6 in the test car was extremely smooth and quiet. At idle, you virtually couldn’t tell the engine was running.\n\nThere was a ton of acceleration, with top speed estima ted at 142 mph. The four-speed automatic, the only transmission available, is totally integrated with the engine for almost imperceptible gear changes.\n\nThe ride leaned just a touch toward the firm side to enhance the front-drive control through fast corners. The suspension, however, was balanced between firm and soft to where there virtually was no vibration in the passenger compartment over uneven pavement.\n\nWhile there’s lots of power, the S isn’t meant to be a banzai road runner. It operated best in a swift, easy mode surrounded by all the accouterments expected in a luxury automobile.\n\nThe Millenia S is geared toward an upscale buyer. It adds a touch of the unique to Mazda’s line of four-door automobiles, and its Miller-cycle engine may reflect the future.\n\n1995 Mazda Millenia SBase price: $31,400.As tested: $33,450.Type: Front engine, front drive, five-passenger luxury sedan.Engine: 2.3 liters, supercharged DOHC, 24 valves, fuel- injected , 210 hor sepower, 210 foot-pounds of torque.Transmission: Four- speed automatic.Mileage: 20 mpg city, 28 mpg highway.Acceleration: 0-60 mph in 8.0 seconds.Top speed: 142 mph (estimated)Wheelbase: 108.3 inches.Length: 189.8 inches.Width: 69.7 inches.Height: 54.9 inches.Curb weight: 3,391 pounds.Options: BOSE audio system with CD changer, 4-Seasons package with heated front seats, heavy-duty wiper motor, large capacity washer tank, washer fluid indicator light, protection package with alloy wheel locks and floor mats.",

      "expert_review": "Spring halted its advance and retreated from winter, which had been thought dead but returned with fierce winds and plummeting temperatures. It was a seasonal resurrection appropriate for the car of the moment, the 1999 Mazda Millenia S, which once seemed destined for retail interment.\n\nMazda Motor Corp. sold only 16,717 Millenias in the United States last year, 7.2 percent fewer than the 18,020 it sold in 1997. Those are death-knell numbers for most vehicle lines. But the Millenia, whose numbers have been low since its U.S. introduction in the spring of 1994, deserved a reprieve.\n\nThe car’s poor market showing stemmed not so much from deficits in quality or performance as it did from Mazda’s seeming inability to sell lemonade on a hot day. On-again, off-again marketing, and failure to establish an image for the Millenia, Mazda’s premier sedan, all helped to deep-six sales.\n\nBut the Millenia survived because of its essential goodness and stunning beauty. It returns to us this year as an even more attractive version of its former self–and at a price, about $5,500 lower than previous models’, that should move the metal.\n\nThe car is a jewel, a design standout. The lines flow from front to rear, uninterrupted by gimcrackery of any sort. The flush-mounted, crystal-lens headlamps round discreetly into the front fenders. And the reworked grille–a chrome-plated waterfall affair–is a delightful piece of brightwork that enhances the Millenia’s overall appearance.\n\nSupple cream-colored, leather-faced seats are inside. There are unobtrusive woodgrain accents on the center console and interior door panels. The instrument cluster–analog dials in an ellipsoidal setting–is intelligently designed.\n\nI normally don’t care much for “moonroofs” or “sunroofs”–rooftop apertures that seem to compromise climate-control systems. But I was taken with the one in the Millenia, because of the way it bathed the passenger cabin in soft, natural light.\n\nMazda again makes two engines available for the Millenia–a standard 2.5-liter, double-overhead-cam 24-valve V-6 for the base car and a Miller cycle 2.3-liter V-6 in the tested Millenia S.\n\nThe standard engine is designed to produce 170 horsepower at 5,800 rpm and 160 pound-feet of torque at 4,800 rpm. Some critics have called it “sluggish.” But I suspect most of those folks are recalcitrant throttle jockeys who refuse to abandon the idea that it’s okay to break the speed limit.\n\nThe Miller cycle engine, made to deliver big-engine power with small-engine fuel consumption, produces 210 horsepower at 5,300 rpm and 210 pound-feet of torque at 3,500 rpm. It’s more fun than the standard Millenia V-6, assuming you have a penchant for hunting vacant back roads to fully open the throttle.\n\nMazda tried to find the sweet middle between a sports ride and a luxury sedan ride in the Millenia, and judging from the performance of the test car, the company appears to have hit its mark.\n\nMazda says it is committed to making the 1999 Millenia a success in the United States. I hope this is true. This car is too darn good to suffer the sales embarrassment it has endured over the past four years.\n\n1999 Mazda Millenia S\n\nComplaints: The standard electronically controlled four-speed automatic transmission could use some refinement. The present system lags a bit in shifts. Also, the Millenia’s 13.3-cubic-foot trunk is shaped in such a way as to limit efficient use of the space therein.\n\nPraise: An absolutely beautiful, well-constructed car overall. Very definitely a machine for people who love to drive–and look good in the process.\n\nHead-turning quotient: Knockout, touchdown, goal!\n\nLayout: Front engine, front-wheel drive.\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: Double aces for ride and handling. Excellent acceleration. Excellent braking. Standard brakes include four-wheel power discs with antilock system.\n\nSafety: Depowered front air bags, automatically tensioning seat belts, s ide-impa ct door beams. Traction control, designed to limit wheel spin on slippery roads, is optional.\n\nCapacities: Seats five people, only four of them comfortably. Fuel tank holds 18 gallons of recommended premium unleaded for the Miller cycle engine.\n\nMileage: Unimpressive. Sorry, Miller cycle. About 22 miles per gallon in city-highway-rural driving. Estimated 384-mile range on usable volume of fuel.\n\nSound system: Bravo! Five-speaker AM/FM/CD/cassette audio system. Speakers by Bose.\n\nPrice: Base price on the tested Millenia S is $31,045. Dealer invoice on base model is $28,084. Price as tested is $32,295, including $800 in options and a $450 destination charge.\n\nNote: The sticker for the 1999 premium Millenia S is the same as the price for the base 1998 Millenia, which means you’re getting more for your money this year. The price of the base Millenia has dropped $5,500, to $26,545. This has got to be one of the best deals out there for luxury cars.",

      "expert_review": "Mazda’s Millenia S often gets lost in the crush of imported luxury sedans, but with a unique engine and pleasant styling it is worth noticing.\n\nOriginally designed for Mazda’s stillborn American luxury division, the Millenia exudes quality, from the tight fit of its panels to leather upholstery and a long list of standard equipment. It stacks up against competitors such as the Lexus ES 300, Infiniti I30 and Acura TL sedans.\n\nEven though there are two other Millenia models, the top-of-the-line Millenia S, with its unique Miller-cycle V6 engine, is the most interesting, and the one I drove. What is a Miller-cycle engine? It is a basic V6 that uses delayed intake-valve timing and a Lysholm compressor to extract more power than would otherwise be available from an engine this size. The belt-driven, forced-induction Lysholm compressor is similar to a supercharger, but it is more efficient. It crams more air and fuel into the engine than it could take naturally, and that results in greater efficiency and power.\n\nThe V6 in this case is a relatively small 2.3-liters, but it delivers 210 horsepower, as much as an engine one-third larger. And its maximum torque, or pulling power, comes at only 3,500 rpm. That means when you pounce on the gas it moves out with authority, no waiting. Yet it is rated at 20 mpg in the city and 28 mpg on the highway.\n\nWhat does all this high-tech gadgetry mean? Unless you like to bore your friends by going into the technical intricacies, it means that the Millenia S gets away from stoplights briskly, and pulls up hills easily.\n\nAbout the only drawback I noticed with the Miller-cycle engine was a slight flat spot when I needed a surge of power at about 40 mph. Fortunately, the transmission shift lever has a button that enables instant downshifts without having to kick the throttle to the floor, and I used it often when I wanted to speed up in traffic. The vibration and harshness that often accompany a supercharger are missing from this engine.\n\nIn addition to the Miller-cycle engine, electronic traction control, anti-lock brakes and variable-assist power steering are all standard on the S.\n\nBoth the base Millenia and Millenia L (which has leather trim) utilize the 2.5-liter V6 with 170 horsepower.\n\nAll Millenias have a multi-link, four-wheel independent suspension that provides a European-style ride and agile cornering, which comes in handy with the extra power. Sixteen-inch alloy wheels are standard and they, too, contribute to its responsiveness.\n\nThe ride is pleasant without being overly firm or harsh.\n\nInside, Mazda has replaced its original audio system, which was dominated by a large, multi-function knob, with one that has a more conventional layout. While it doesn’t look as clever, it is easier to use. Sound quality remains good.\n\nThe automatic climate control system is a bit cryptic, in spite of the fact that it looks simple. Various modes are operated by f lat push buttons while a large round knob selects the temperature. Switches for the heated seats are on the console.\n\nA new center console has an improved cupholder plus a small tray for sunglasses.\n\nIn order to reduce glare, the instrument panel is a darker color than the rest of the interior.\n\nOf course, convenience items such as power driver’s seat, power mirrors, AM/FM/CD player and power mirrors are all standard equipment on all Millenias.\n\nPrice\n\nThe base price of the Millenia S is $36,595. The only options on our test car were white pearl paint the 4-Seasons Package of heated seats, heavy duty wiper motor, heavy-duty battery and large-capacity windshield washer tank.\n\nThe sticker price was $37,695.\n\nWarranty\n\nThe basic warranty is for three years or 50,000 miles.\n\nVehicles for The Star’s week-long test drives are supplied by the auto manufacturers.\n\nPoint: The Miller-cycle engine feels bigger, and stronger, than it ctually is. Fuel mileage is good, and the styling is simple and uncluttered.\n\nCounterpoint: Interior styling is handsome but the climate control system can be hard to decipher. Also, the price is rather steep.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\n\nENGINE: 2.3-liter, V6\n\nTRANSMISSION: automatic\n\nWHEELBASE: 108.3 inches\n\nCURB WEIGHT: 3,391 lbs.\n\nBASE PRICE: $36,595\n\nPRICE AS DRIVEN: $37,695\n\nMPG RATING: 20 city, 28 hwy.",

      "expert_review": "Stalin banned The Grapes of Wrath from theaters in Russia because he didn’t like the fact that poor people in the movie owned cars.\n\nWonder what he’d think of the relatively new “near luxury” automotive segment created by the Japanese that includes the 1996 Mazda Millenia S. With the Millenia – and other mostly Japanese offerings in its class – you can have a relatively “modest” paycheck and still drive a big-shot car.\n\nHe: Oh, good. Now our readers will think you’re a closet Marxist.\n\nShe: Yeah, Harpo. Just because I go to the library and actually read about automotive history doesn’t make me a Marxist. You’re missing the point. This is a $35,000 car with a new-tech engine that gets terrific gas mileage and has a list of standard features you can just drool over. My only gripe is that the optional heated seats get too hot. What do you have to say about that?\n\nHe: Maybe hot pants are making a comeback. And be more specific about the engine. It’s a 2.3-liter dual-overhead-cam Miller-cycle V-6 with a Lysholm compressor and dual intercoolers.\n\nShe: Don’t get all hostile. Instead of getting so technical, why don’t you just say that the Miller-cycle is a specially designed engine that makes over 200 horsepower from a small package, but also delivers up to 28 miles a gallon. It only comes on the top-of-the-line Millenia S, which may be OK with some people who worry that it’s too new-tech and unproven. The regular 170-horsepower twin-cam V-6 on the other two models isn’t bad either. And the base model starts at $28,000.\n\nHe: The Millenia S is loaded. But then, the standard Millenia has many of the same features, including full power accessories, standard antilock brakes, automatic climate control and a great audio system with a standard in-dash CD player. I’d have to say it’s probably a better value, but if you have the money to spend, I’d go for the S. That Miller-cycle engine is a joy to drive. In fact, the Millenia itself is really an entertaining vehicle, much more so than most of its direct competitors.\n\nShe: You’re talking about guy entertainment, right? And that translates to “performance” – in the automotive sense. And that’s exactly why I think the Millenia is such a guy car. We had it the same week we drove the competition – the Acura 3.2 TL and that car seems to emphasize luxury over performance – something that is more of a joy to most women. I think the difference is noticeable when you compare the interiors and the ride.\n\nHe: We’ll talk about the Acura in more detail next week. But I thought it was far more sedate than the Mazda. I can see why you like it. Give me the Millenia. The all-independent multilink suspension gives you superb control and a firm ride, much like a midlevel Audi, and the variable-assist power steering really enhances the car’s handling. Overall, the Millenia just feels more European in flavor, not Japanese at all.\n\nShe: I guess I’m less impressed with the ride than the fact that the Millenia S has standard traction control, heated outside mirrors and features like rear-seat heater ducts. And it does come close to the competition’s cabin with things like a standard four-way power passenger seat. If you’re worried about style – most of the Japanese models in this class tend to look alike. No radical statements, just a slightly unconventional dashboard, a tasteful grille like you find on the Millenia and understated lines. This year, Mazda has added bright-finish alloy wheels to the S – wow, now that’s getting risky.\n\nHe: What’s to risk? Buyers in this segment tend to be a bit more on the conservative side, so the companies are just playing to their potential audience. If anything, I think the Millenia has more style than its competitors. And, yes, it is tasteful. So let me get this straight. You’re whacking Mazda because they’re too risk-averse with the styling and because they’re too radical with the Miller-cycle engin right? Typical.\n\nShe: I’m just worrying out loud, like I always do. It’s the opposite of male impulse buying.\n\nAnita’s rating: (above average)\n\nPaul’s rating: (world-class)\n\nWhat we liked: Powerful yet frugal engine (Paul); Euro-flavor ride ; long list of standard features; cabin inviting.\n\nWhat we didn’t like: Engine may be too unproven (Anita); optional heated seats get too hot; may be too performance-oriented for female buyers (Anita).\n\n1996 Mazda Millenia S\n\nType: Front-engine, front-wheel drive, five-passenger entry-luxury sedan.\n\nPrice: Base, $35,595; as tested, $36,345 (inc. $450 destination charge).\n\nWhat’s new for ’96: Revised alloy wheels.\n\nStandard equipment: Bose premium audio system, keyless entry system, power glass moonroof, power driver and passenger seats with leather upholstery, power, four-wheel disc brakes, cruise control, automatic climate control system, anti-theft alarm, power door locks, alloy wheels, dual power heated mirrors, power tilt steering column, woodgrain trim, power windows, dual lighted vanity mirrors, carpeted floor mats.\n\nSafety features: Dual air bags, antilock brakes, traction control, side-impact door beams.\n\nOptions on test vehicle: 4 Seasons package, inc. heated front seats, heavy-duty starter, heavy-duty wiper motor, heavy-duty battery, large-capacity windshield-washer tank ($300).\n\nEPA fuel economy: 20 mpg city/28 mpg highway.\n\nEngine: 2.3-liter V-6; 210-hp at 5300 rpm; 210 lb-ft torque at 5300 rpm.\n\nTransmission: Four-speed automatic.\n\nCompetitors: Acura 3.2 TL, Infiniti I30, Lexus ES300, Audi A6, Saab 9000, Volvo 850.\n\nSpecifications: Wheelbase, 108.3 inches; overall length, 189.8 inches; curb weight, 3391 pounds; legroom, 43.3 inches front/34.1 inches rear; headroom, 37.9 inches front/36.5 inches rear; shoulder room, 55.1 inches front/54.2 inches rear.\n\nWhere built: Hiroshima, Japan.\n\n12-month insurance cost, according to AAA Michigan*: $1,399.\n\nRates based on an average family of four from the Livonia area whose primary driver is aged 40 with no tickets who drives 3-10 miles each way to work. Rates reflect multicar discount and, where appropriate, discounts for air bags and seat belts.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nMazda tries to cash in on Y2K mania with a Millennium Limited Edition of its near-luxury sedan. The Limited Edition is a Millenia S model with charcoal suede upholstery, a Bose audio system with a six-disc, in-dash CD changer, 17-inch alloy wheels and either silver metallic or red mica paint.\n\nFord holds a controlling interest in Mazda, and word from Ford headquarters is that the slow-selling Millenia may not have much of a future. The Millenia was created as part of Mazda’s plan to launch a luxury division similar to Toyota’s Lexus and Nissan’s Infiniti. That plan was scrapped, and Ford later stepped in to rescue the struggling Japanese manufacturer.\n\nExterior\nThe front-wheel-drive Millenia is about 3 inches longer than Mazda’s 626 sedan in both wheelbase and overall length, measuring 108 and 190 inches, respectively. Millenia was introduced for the 1995 season and retains the same basic styling as the first-year model.\n\nInterior\nMillenia is a five-passenger sedan, though four will be much more comfortable because the rear seat isn’t wide enough to hold three adults. All models come with a long list of standard amenities, but if you want leather you have to skip the base version and step up to the S model.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe base model uses the same 170-horsepower, 2.5-liter V-6 as the 626 sedan, and it won’t win many drag races in the larger, heavier Millenia. The S model and Limited Edition come with a supercharged 2.3-liter V-6 (Mazda calls it a Miller-cycle engine) that, despite its smaller displacement, packs 200 horsepower and delivers impressive acceleration.\n\nAll models come with a four-speed automatic transmission and anti-lock brakes. Traction control is optional on the base model, standard on the other two.\n\nPerformance\nWith a base list price of $29,995, the Millenia S stands up pretty well in side-by-side comparisons to near-luxury sedans such as the Lexus ES300 and Acura 3.2TL. However, the Mazda brand holds little cache with buyers looking for a luxury model, so Millenia has less box-office appeal. Lackluster sales have resulted in deep discounting by dealers, which takes a big bite out of resale value.\n\n \n\nReported by Rick Popely  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2000 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nCould the days of Mazdas front-drive near-luxury sedan be numbered? Because sales dipped to 16,558 units during 2000, some analysts believe the Millenia may fade out of the Mazda picture. Ironically, not many more Miatas are sold each year, yet that model is in no danger of extinction.\n\nThe Millenia earned new front and rear styling for 2001. A 170-horsepower, 2.5-liter V-6 engine goes into the base model, while the S sedan carries a supercharged, 210-hp, 2.3-liter V-6. Little has changed for the 2002 model year.\n\nExterior\nThe Millenia measures 191.6 inches long overall, which is about 4 inches longer than the Mazda 626 sedan. Its 108.3-inch wheelbase is 3 inches longer than that of the 626, and the sedan is 69.7 inches wide and 54.9 inches high. Alloy wheels hold 16-inch tires on the base sedan, and the Millenia S rides on 17-inch rubber.\n\nInterior\nLike most midsize models, the Millenia promises five-passenger capacity. Because the rear seat isnt really wide enough to hold three adults, four occupants will be more comfortable.\n\nLeather upholstery is one item on a long list of standard amenities. The electronic gauge cluster can be as entertaining as it is useful. When the driver turns on the ignition, luminescent red needles light up first, followed by white gauge graphics.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe base Millenia uses the same 170-hp, 2.5-liter V-6 engine as the 626 sedan. Because the Millenia is heavier, you cant expect sizzling performance. The S model is fitted with a supercharged, 2.3-liter V-6 known as a Miller-cycle engine. Despite its smaller displacement, this engine whips up 210 hp and delivers markedly more impressive acceleration. Both engines mate with a four-speed-automatic transmission.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes and side-impact airbags for the front seats are standard. Traction control is an option on the base model and a standard feature on the S model.\n\nDriving Impressions\nIn addition to its smooth appearance, the Millenia delivers a comfortable and satisfying experience on the road. It steers with a light touch and produces a gentle ride, though it is accompanied by a bit of surplus motion on some surfaces. The well-behaved suspension recovers rapidly from each imperfection it encounters.\n\nAcceleration in the S model is energetic with the Miller-cycle engine. Except for an invigorating sound from the blower, the engine is quiet. Mazdas automatic transmission shifts capably, without significant delays. Occupants also enjoy plenty of space within the attractive, distinctive interior  not to mention the well-cushioned, properly supportive seats.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2002 Buying Guide",
