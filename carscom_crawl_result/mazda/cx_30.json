      "expert_review": "Automakers continue to find new ways to slice and dice SUVs for smaller niches, and the 2020 Mazda CX-30 is a subcompact that narrowly slots between the CX-3 and CX-5 in Mazda’s SUV lineup. But more than that, the CX-30 subcompact SUV is right-sized to better appeal to buyers.\n\nRelated: Mazda CX-30 Brings Mazda3 Style to All-New Small SUV\n\nI’m a fan of the CX-3 for its driving manners as well as its style that’s a cut above most rivals. But it’s a mini-SUV based on the global Mazda2 subcompact car and is too small even for many urban U.S. buyers (Mazda officials admit it was designed more for European tastes). The roomier CX-30 — about an inch wider and about 5 inches longer on a wheelbase 3.3 inches longer — is based on the new Mazda3 compact car. It shares many of the car’s bits and packages them into an SUV that should have more mainstream appeal.\n\nThe resulting CX-30 is a stylish utility with the above-class road dynamics and quality characteristic of other Mazdas. It will need those and more to take on the increasingly crowded  competition, from current subcompact SUV leaders including the Honda HR-V and Nissan Rogue Sport to other newcomers, such as the Kia Seltos and Chevrolet Trailblazer. I checked out the CX-30 at a Mazda drive in the desert and mountains of Southern California (per company policy Cars.com pays for its travel and lodging at such automaker-sponsored events). There are four trim levels, including base, Select, Preferred and the test vehicles, which were all Premium.\n\nStylish Minimalism\n\nThe Mazda design evolution that made its production debut with the redone 2019 Mazda3 makes its first SUV appearance with the CX-30. It features smooth and mostly unadorned sheet metal that emphasizes the shape and surfaces. A sweeping curve runs from the headlights to the rear wheels, and the subtle side shaping creates interesting S-shaped highlights from many angles. Generous (maybe a little too much) dark cladding on the bumpers, large wheel arches and lower body visually raise the height, while the rear roof pillars slope steeply back for a more coupelike roofline. The overall effect is classy and near-premium for a subcompact SUV, even more so in the pricier top two trim levels.\n\nFirst-Class Cabin\n\nThe interior has a lot of Mazda3 (a good thing) with a bit more room. The Premium trim level is just that, with a rich black and brown (or white) color scheme and quality perforated leather accented by blue in the perforations. The seats are comfortable and new shaping holds you in place without the restrictive bolstering of some Mazdas. The dashboard has a layered design with contrasting textures and padded materials, and the controls and trim details look and feel solid.\n\n2020 Mazda CX-30 | Cars.com photo by Fred Meier\n\nBoosting the quality interior feel is the fact that the cabin is impressively quiet for a small SUV, with very little road and wind noise. Among the ways quietness was designed in was the relocation of audio speakers from the doors to under the dashboard, eliminating the openings in the door panels.\n\nUnlike in many small SUVs, materials quality also holds up in the backseat. There’s headroom for adults there, too, but the legroom is tight. Adult passengers will need concessions from the front occupants and still will have their knees hard against the front seats. The backseat gets its own air vents but no device charging — the nearest USB port is in the center console bin.\n\nVisibility for a small SUV to the rear is average but quite good to the front thanks to slim front pillars and side mirrors mounted on the doors. A packaging oddity to beware of, however: If heated front seats are a must-have, you need to move up three trim levels to get them.\n\nMedia Tech Is a Hard Sell\n\nMazda went to great lengths at the event to justify the CX-30’s multimedia controls — a rotary push-knob setup and shortcut buttons on the center console along with a separate multifunction volume control. Unlike previous Mazdas, the standard 8.8-inch display does not respond to touch even when the vehicle is stopped. The idea is that the setup is safer because the controls are where your hand falls and you can keep your eyes close to the road while glancing at the screen. That actually works for me, but consumer surveys indicate I’m an outlier. It feels particularly unnatural to many to operate Apple CarPlay or Android Auto without a touchscreen. You should test-drive the Mazda system if you consider this SUV.\n\nMeanwhile, the widescreen display is standard. It’s powered by Mazda’s latest system, which is improved in look and operation, but it’s still heavy on menus and requires multiple steps for common functions. And you have to move up from the base to the Select trim level to get CarPlay and Android Auto.\n\nOn the plus side, the climate system retains conventional knobs and buttons that have a quality look and feel. Standard tech also includes a pair of USB ports, eight-speaker audio, a Wi-Fi hot spot with a six-month/2-gigabyte free trial and three free years of Mazda’s app-based Connected Services that include vehicle monitoring and remote starting and door locking.\n\nMid-Pack Room to Pack\n\nInterior storage is good for a small SUV, with generous center console and door bin space.\n\nIf you need more cargo space, the backseat folds flat. Cargo room falls comfortably in the middle of the subcompact pack — where the CX-3 brings up the rear. At 20.2 cubic feet behind the rear seat, the CX-30 lags the more ample Honda HR-V and Nissan Rogue Sport but holds more than the Hyundai Kona or Jeep Renegade. The cargo area is short of tricks, such as cargo management features or a multilevel floor, but the 60/40-split seatbacks fold flat and the liftgate is wide with a relatively low lift-over height.\n\nFun to Drive\n\nAll CX-30s use the same smooth, 186-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder and six-speed conventional automatic transmission as the Mazda3. That’s more power than is typical among subcompact SUVs (some of which are lighter), though the non-turbo four needs to be wound up to tap it. But the transmission tuning seems aimed to squeeze out higher mileage ratings, and it hampers winding the engine out. Shifts are crisp and it’s quick to downshift, but the gearing leaves an uphill climb back to the power peak. Using the paddle shifters can help, as does the aggressive Sport mode that holds lower gears longer — but it also eliminates the 6th gear, raises the noise level and lowers mileage. While you might wish for a well-tuned eight-speed, you might instead get one of the continuously variable automatics proliferating among small SUVs, so you have to count your blessings.\n\nHandling is controlled and consistent. The CX-30 is easily the drivers’ small SUV — even though, like the Mazda3, the CX-30 uses a cheaper torsion-beam rear suspension rather than a fully independent multilink setup. Body roll is well controlled and steering is quick and precise, aided by the standard Mazda G-Vectoring Control Plus system that uses selective torque and braking inputs to improve steering response and turn-in — as well as the all-wheel drive that is set up to shift torque to reduce understeer. The brakes felt strong, the response predictable and linear, but that was after I got used to pedal motion designed for shorter travel with higher effort. (Mazda says the design is based on research showing it best suits the typical human leg.)\n\nThere were few trade-offs. The ride was firm though comfortable and was stable at speed. Rougher city streets did bring out some mild choppiness, however. EPA-estimated gas mileage of up to 25/33/28 mpg city/highway/combined with front-wheel drive compares to the less powerful, CVT-equipped Rogue Sport and is a couple of mpg behind the lighter HR-V.\n\nStandard Safety Tech, Substandard Backup Camera\n\nAll CX-30s have a substantial standard array of safety and driver assistance tech, unusually so among subcompact SUVs. It includes a front collision system with automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go, lane departure warning, lane keep assist, automatic high beams and a driver attention alert. Moving up one to the Select trim level adds a blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert.\n\n2020 Mazda CX-30 | Cars.com photo by Fred Meier\n\nWhat’s inexplicable is a backup camera image that fills only part of the dashboard display and has fixed rather than predictive grid lines that move as you turn the steering wheel. Perhaps it’s a small thing compared with some of the other features, but this isn’t helpful for city parking and is substandard in a class where the bendy lines are common and a 360-degree camera system is not unknown. How much did that save?\n\nPricing in the Middle\n\nThe base CX-30 is fairly well equipped and starts at $22,945 with front-wheel drive, which is about $1,500 more than a base 2019 CX-3 (all prices include a $1,045 destination charge). That’s a mid-pack entry price. You can get a base HR-V for less money; others, such as the Rogue Sport, start higher. You can compare their pricing and features here. All-wheel drive is available on all CX-30s for an additional $1,400.\n\nThe sweet spot for CX-30 value is the Select trim with desirable additions for $2,000 more than the base. The price bump gets Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a better-trimmed interior with black or beige simulated leather, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, keyless entry, dual-zone automatic climate control and 18-inch aluminum-alloy wheels that look a whole lot better in those big wheel arches than the base 16-inchers.\n\nThe top-of-the-line Premium with its classy interior also adds some features unusual for a subcompact SUV, such as a power liftgate, a head-up display and adaptive headlights. My Premium test car, which also had premium gray paint, an auto-dimming rearview mirror and navigation options tallied $31,670, a bit more than a comparable top-shelf HR-V but less than the Rogue Sport. But if size matters, they all also overlap some well-equipped compact SUVs.\n\nOverall, the new CX-30 is a good-looking subcompact SUV that’s fun to drive and classier than most rivals in a larger but still city-friendly size.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2022 Mazda CX-30?\n\nThe Mazda CX-30 is a subcompact five-seat SUV with a choice of two four-cylinder engines and standard all-wheel drive on all trims. The base powertrain is a 191-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder coupled to a six-speed automatic transmission. For added verve, there’s an optional turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder that makes 227 hp when running on regular gas or 250 hp on premium; it’s paired to the same transmission. The CX-30 has a sporty nature thanks to its highly accurate steering, strong brakes and taut suspension. The latter, though, might be a tad too firm for some SUV shoppers.\n\nDirect competitors include the Chevrolet Trailblazer, Honda HR-V, Hyundai Kona and Subaru Crosstrek. According to Cars.com’s cargo measurements, the CX-30 offers 13.7 cubic feet of cargo space. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Mazda CX-30?\n\nThe base four-cylinder in the 2023 CX-30 receives a small bump in horsepower, from 186 to 191 hp, along with a 2 mpg increase in its EPA-estimated city and highway fuel economy ratings. Other than this mechanical update, the CX-30 is carried over essentially unchanged from the 2022 model year.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Mazda CX-30 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\n16-inch alloy wheels\nLED headlights and taillights\nRain-sensing windshield wipers\nCloth upholstery\nWi-Fi hot spot (subscription required after data trial)\n8.8-inch multimedia screen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nAdaptive cruise control with stop and go capability\nLane departure steering assist\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:  \n\n18-inch alloy wheels\nPower moonroof\nPower liftgate\nLeather upholstery\nHeated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nDual-zone automatic climate control\nNavigation\nSatellite radio\nBose premium stereo\n360-degree camera system\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nRear automatic braking\nShould I Buy the 2023 Mazda CX-30?\n\nWhen it comes to driving enjoyment, there aren’t many small SUVs that provide the same degree of fun you’ll get from the CX-30. Its agility and size make it easy to park, too. Downsides include poor rear visibility, a cozy second row and an infotainment system that eschews a proper touchscreen for a quirky rotary knob controller on the center console. On the plus side, the quality of the cabin is excellent; it feels upscale.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Mazda CX-30?\n\nThe Mazda CX-30 is a subcompact five-seat SUV with a choice of two four-cylinder engines and standard all-wheel drive on all trims. The base powertrain is a 191-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder coupled with a six-speed automatic transmission. For added verve, there’s an optional turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder that makes 227 hp when running on regular gas and 250 hp on premium; it’s paired with the same transmission.\n\nDirect competitors include the Subaru Crosstrek, Hyundai Kona, Honda HR-V and Chevrolet Trailblazer. According to Cars.com’s cargo measurements, the CX-30 has 13.7 cubic feet of cargo space. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Mazda CX-30?\n\nA Carbon Turbo trim joins the line, making the turbocharged engine available at a more affordable price. The Carbon Turbo also has unique features and trim, including exclusive Zircon Sand exterior paint, black exterior trim elements and terra-cotta-colored, leatherette-trimmed seats. All turbocharged versions of the CX-30 get a new 10.25-inch infotainment screen with wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay compatibility, along with wireless phone charging. This screen functions as a touchscreen only when using these phone-mirroring systems.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Mazda CX-30 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\n16-inch alloy wheels\nLED headlights and taillights\nRain-sensing windshield wipers\nCloth upholstery\nWi-Fi hot spot (subscription required after data trial)\n8.8-inch multimedia screen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nAdaptive cruise control with stop and go capability\nLane departure steering assist\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:  \n\n18-inch alloy wheels\nPower moonroof\nPower liftgate\nLeather upholstery\nHeated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nDual-zone automatic climate control\nNavigation\nSatellite radio\nBose premium stereo\n360-degree camera system\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nRear automatic braking\nShould I Buy the 2024 Mazda CX-30?\n\nWhen it comes to driving enjoyment, there aren’t many small SUVs that provide the same degree of fun you’ll get from the Mazda CX-30. Its agility and size make it easy to park, too. Downsides include poor rear visibility, a cozy second row and an infotainment system that eschews a proper touchscreen in favor of a quirky rotary knob controller on the center console. On the plus side, the quality of the cabin is excellent; it feels upscale. The CX-30 also has a sporty nature thanks to its highly accurate steering, strong brakes and taut suspension; the latter, though, might be a tad too firm for some SUV shoppers.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2022 Mazda CX-30?\nThe Mazda CX-30 is a subcompact SUV that seats five. It has standard all-wheel drive and a choice of four-cylinder engines: a base 186-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder or a turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder that makes 227 hp on regular gas, 250 hp on premium. Both engines work with a six-speed automatic transmission.\nCompetitors include the Hyundai Kona, Honda HR-V and Nissan Rogue Sport. The CX-30 offers 13.7 cubic feet of cargo space, according to Cars.com’s cargo measurements.\nWhat’s New on the 2022 Mazda CX-30?\nAll-wheel drive is newly standard, and there’s a new Carbon Edition trim level. The Carbon Edition is based on the 2.5 S Preferred model, featuring black 18-inch aluminum wheels, gloss-black side mirror housings and red leather-trimmed seats. It’s finished exclusively in Polymetal Gray paint.\nWhat Features in the 2022 Mazda CX-30 Are Most Important?\nStandard features include: \n\n16-inch alloy wheels\nLED headlights and taillights\nRain-sensing windshield wipers\nCloth upholstery\nWi-Fi hot spot (subscription required after data trial)\n8-inch multimedia screen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nAdaptive cruise control with stop and go capability\nLane-keeping assist\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:  \n\n18-inch alloy wheels\nPower moonroof\nPower liftgate\nLeather upholstery\nHeated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nDual-zone automatic air conditioning\nNavigation\nSatellite radio\nBose premium stereo\n360-degree camera system\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nRear automatic braking\n\nShould I Buy the 2022 Mazda CX-30?\nThe CX-30’s available powertrains — particularly its powerful turbocharged engine — are highlights, as are its steering and handling. Interior quality impresses, too. The backseat, however, is small, and the ride might be too firm for some. Its multimedia controls aren’t intuitive, either.",

      "expert_review": "Is the Mazda CX-30 a Good SUV?\n\nIf quick acceleration, athletic handling and an upscale interior are more important to you than generous backseat and cargo space — and you’re willing to pay a bit extra for those traits — the 2025 Mazda CX-30 is a standout subcompact SUV you should consider.\n\nHow Does the Mazda CX-30 Compare With Other Subcompact SUVs?\n\nMazda’s recent effort to push the brand upmarket means the CX-30 straddles the line between mainstream and luxury marques — particularly the top-of-the-line 2.5 Turbo Premium Plus trim. Turbocharged versions of the Hyundai Kona and Kia Seltos are appropriate rivals of the base-engine CX-30, while the turbocharged Mazda compares favorably with the Audi Q3, BMW X1, Mercedes-Benz GLA and Mini Countryman S — even without the same brand prestige those rivals have.\nWhat Is the Mazda CX-30?\n\nThe CX-30 is Mazda’s smallest and most affordable SUV; it slots beneath the compact CX-5 and CX-50 in Mazda’s lineup. The CX-30 hasn’t changed a lot since its debut for the 2020 model year; the biggest update so far has been an available turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine that arrived for 2021, joining the normally aspirated 2.5-liter four-cylinder that comes standard. For 2025, the CX-30 gets available Alexa Built-In voice control and online navigation with live traffic data and over-the-air updates, as well as a new available extra-cost paint color called Aero Gray Metallic.\n\nRelated: 2025 Mazda CX-30: Alexa Built-In Now Available, Priced From $26,415\n\nAll-wheel drive is standard on every CX-30. The base engine makes a respectable 191 horsepower, while the turbo version increases output to 227 hp when running on regular gas and 250 hp on 93-octane premium fuel. The turbo engine’s numbers handily top every mainstream-brand subcompact SUV, but turbo versions of the Hyundai Kona and Kia Seltos are on par with the base CX-30’s output, as is the new-for-2025, near-luxury Acura ADX.\n\nAt least on the horsepower front, the turbo CX-30’s closest competitors are entry-level versions of European luxury subcompact SUVs, all of which are powered by turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engines: the Audi Q3 (228 hp), BMW X1 xDrive28i (241 hp), Mercedes-Benz GLA250 (221 hp), Mini Countryman S (also 241 hp, as the Countryman shares its platform and engines with the X1) and Volvo XC40 (247 hp).\n\nRelated Video:\n\nHow Does the Mazda CX-30 Drive?\n\nWe drove a CX-30 2.5 Turbo Premium Plus on premium gas, and it feels as gutsy as its horsepower rating implies. The engine delivers linear power with minimal turbo lag — briskly getting up to speed on freeway on-ramps or zipping forward to an opening in traffic feels smooth and relatively effortless. The CX-30’s lone transmission is a six-speed automatic, which is a bit behind the times; seven-, eight- and nine-speed automatics are the norm these days. Even so, Mazda’s gearbox is just fine, matching nicely with the engine to deliver crisp, timely shifts.\n\nIn addition to that healthy horsepower rating, the rest of the CX-30’s driving personality is athletic, too. The steering feel is wonderfully responsive and communicative while still effectively filtering out harshness from rough pavement and other road imperfections. Likewise, the suspension strikes an excellent balance between cornering prowess and ride quality. Among the current crop of mainstream-brand subcompact SUVs, the turbo CX-30 is the most agile and fun to drive, and its handling compares favorably to those European luxury-brand SUVs.\n\nHow Nice Is the Mazda CX-30’s Interior?\n\nIn Premium Plus trim, the CX-30’s cabin ambiance is a step above its mainstream rivals. Supple leather upholstery and high-quality materials provide a convincingly luxurious feel, as do standard features like a head-up display, 360-degree camera system and excellent Bose premium audio system.\n\nThe interior space, on the other hand, isn’t very generous. Though the CX-30’s sleek, bobtail body shape looks sporty, it’s not optimal for cargo capacity — and that low roofline and sloped rear window also mean rear visibility isn’t very good. The cabin is cozy for people, too. Backseat space is tight to start with, and legroom gets truly cramped when the front seats are adjusted more than halfway back.\n\nI also have a specific tall-guy pet peeve. I’m 6 feet, 6 inches tall, so I need to have the front seats set all the way back in order to fit — and with the front seats in that position, the rear seatbacks can’t fold because they hit the front seatbacks. That means I have to perform the tedious task of moving the front seats up and back again every time I need to fold the rear seats to open up the CX-30’s maximum cargo space.\n\nYou can compare the CX-30’s cargo area with other small SUVs by checking our list of vehicle cargo measurements from our own independent testing. Spoiler alert: It’s toward the bottom of the list. Several subcompact SUVs offer more space for both people and cargo.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2025 Mazda CX-5 Review: Pace Over Space\n2025 Mazda CX-50 Hybrid Review: A Bit More Efficient, a Lot Less Fun\nWhat’s the Best Compact SUV for 2025?\nResearch Mazda Vehicles\nShop for a 2025 Mazda CX-30 Near You\nHow Is the Mazda CX-30’s Technology?\n\nThe CX-30 shares its infotainment interface with the rest of Mazda’s lineup, and our editors are not fans of the system. It uses a console-mounted control knob and buttons, which we find more distracting and tedious to use than a typical touchscreen-based system. The CX-30’s available 10.25-inch display does have touchscreen functionality, but strangely only when Apple CarPlay or Android Auto is being used — and the touchscreen is placed so far from the driver, it’s not easy to reach.\n\nFurthermore, Mazda’s infotainment software looks and feels outdated; it isn’t as robust or feature-rich as some competitors’ systems. And while I like the clean, easy-to-read layout of the CX-30’s combination digital-and-analog instrument panel, several rivals (including the Kona and Seltos) boast available fully digital gauge clusters with more features and configurability.\n\nShould You Buy a Mazda CX-30?\n\nThat depends on your priorities. The 2.5 Turbo Premium Plus trim we tested starts at $38,570 (all prices include destination), and that’s essentially loaded. The only options are extra-cost paint (which adds $450 or $595, depending on the color), a $230 interior lighting kit and other accessories, including all-weather floormats. That’s well above the CX-30’s starting price of $26,615, but it still comfortably undercuts most of its European luxury rivals. The Countryman S starts around $40,000 and the Q3, X1, GLA and XC40 start in the low to mid-40s.\n\nThe fact that the CX-30 Turbo stacks up to those luxury rivals as well as it does means it’s well worth considering if you value a sporty driving experience and upscale trimmings more than passenger and cargo space in your subcompact SUV.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2021 Mazda CX-30 is refined in many ways, and a new turbocharged engine option elevates it as a value alternative to many entry-level luxury SUVs. Beyond that, it lacks too many commonsense attributes for mass-market appeal.\n\nVersus the competition: Upscale and fun to drive even if you don’t get the new turbo engine — and legitimately quick if you do — the CX-30 will deservedly find its loyalists. But many mass-market competitors have simpler controls, softer rides and roomier cabins.\n\nBased on the current-generation Mazda3 sedan and hatchback, the CX-30 enters its second model year for 2021 as a more viable alternative to the too-small Mazda CX-3 SUV. It comes in seven trim levels with front- or all-wheel drive and two available engines; stack them up or compare the 2020 and 2021 models. We evaluated a well-optioned turbo model for 2021, but I’ll mix in some impressions from the base-engine 2020 CX-30 that we tested in Cars.com’s recent Affordable Small SUV Challenge, where I served as a judge.\n\nRelated: What’s the Best Small Affordable SUV?\n\nThe CX-30’s third-place finish out of four SUVs in the comparison test tells much of the tale: Mazda’s small SUV drew top scores in some areas but bottom marks in others, with very little about it evoking neutral reactions. One model year later, Mazda plopped in a newly optional turbocharged four-cylinder, which matches the character of its carryover base engine: refined, steady power — just more of it. The fun’s been turned up, but the flaws live on.\n\nRefined Engines\n\nIn a field where pint-sized engines, many of them turbocharged, can lend tentative acceleration, the CX-30 is an old-school breath of fresh air. Its base engine, Mazda’s refined 2.5-liter four-cylinder (186 horsepower, 186 pounds-feet of torque) provides smooth if unspectacular power: sufficient from a start, with linear revving through any sustained on-ramp charge. It pairs with a six-speed automatic transmission whose tall gearing works against such drawn-out spurts — a disadvantage on paper, where rivals’ eight- or nine-speed units can make for shorter passing gears without diminishing fuel economy. But the six-speed earns its keep if you need more power while already in motion because downshifts are both decisive and immediate when you press the gas, an exercise many eight- and nine-speed automatics butcher.\n\nOur comparison test exemplified how this plays out. We clocked a 2020 CX-30 with the 2.5-liter engine and AWD at a pedestrian 8.92 seconds to 60 mph, third slowest among four models (the others being a Chevrolet Trailblazer, Kia Seltos and Subaru Crosstrek, all with top available engines). Despite that, the CX-30 earned the group’s highest scores from our judges for overall powertrain impressions. Credit its consistent power delivery, which belies any absolute performance metric.\n\nNew for 2021 is Mazda’s turbocharged 2.5-liter engine, available only with AWD. It can run on regular gas but makes 250 hp and 320 pounds-feet of torque on 93-octane premium fuel, which our test car employed. (On 87-octane regular fuel, ratings for the turbo 2.5-liter drop to 227 hp and 310 pounds-feet of torque; the non-turbo 2.5-liter makes its output with either fuel.) Though significantly quicker past 2,500 rpm or so, the turbocharged four-cylinder’s power profile is similar to its non-turbo sibling — which is to say linear, building power over the full breadth of available engine rpm. Gearing remains tall, but the extra power makes the late upshifts less noticeable. And all the while, it’s gratifyingly quick.\n\nThe CX-30’s EPA-estimated fuel economy ranges from 25 to 28 mpg combined, depending on drivetrain. Versus a selection of mass-market rivals, the 2.5-liter falls a little short. Versus some entry-luxury models, whose interiors the CX-30’s top trims rival, the turbocharged CX-30 compares better.\n\nHandling and Ride Comfort\n\nTurbocharged or not, the CX-30’s reflexes are similar to the Mazda3 on which it’s based. Limited body roll, excellent steering feedback and surefooted brakes make the CX-30 a deft ally on winding roads. Wet conditions and temperatures in the 30s stymied our test car’s Bridgestone Turanza P215/55R18 all-season tires, which struggled on cloverleaf interchanges to hold course. Our CX-30 in the 2020 comparison had the same tires in better testing conditions, and we observed notable slippage there, as well. Wider or stickier tires might help — but if the CX-30’s rubber is the weak link on handling, it’s a mild one.\n\nAll that fun sacrifices ride comfort. Like the Mazda3, the CX-30 exhibits good overall straight-line composure, free of excess body movement on uneven surfaces; in this regard, it emulates a few entry-level luxury SUVs. But suspension tuning is unabashedly firm. The CX-30 exhibits a degree of impact harshness absent in many competitors, especially mass-market rivals like the Crosstrek and Nissan Rogue Sport — enough to turn off many shoppers who just want a smoother rider.\n\nThe Interior: Quality Over Quantity\n\nFor the most part, interior quality is strong. Controls boast meticulous detailing and operation, and most surfaces above knee level have consistent, low-gloss finishes. The CX-30’s optional leather seating surfaces are free of any obvious stretches of vinyl, and premium touches like universal one-touch windows hint at luxury territory. It’s not all excellent: A cheap headliner and some obvious cost-cutting in the backseat bring the CX-30 back to earth. By and large, though, this is a clear step above the SUV’s mass-market rivals. In our 2020 comparison, Mazda earned the highest interior quality scores by a clear margin, and in that regard may have fared well against SUVs priced far higher.\n\nDespite that, interior quantity is marginal even if this is a larger alternative to the CX-3. The smallish backseat is ill-equipped to handle taller adults or even children in rear-facing car seats. Not only did it rank last in our comparison’s rear seats category, but it couldn’t fit Cars.com’s rear-facing child-safety seats without needing to move the front passenger seat so far forward that it may pose a safety risk for some adults seated there. \n\nEven those who don’t plan to carry anyone in back often — children or otherwise — might find the CX-30’s confines, well, confining. The front seats have good sliding range but a narrow berth that could leave long-legged drivers feeling pinched. And as the CX-30’s relatively low-slung profile suggests, the driving position isn’t as high as you might expect of a conventional SUV. By our measuring tape, the CX-30’s driving position towers nearly half a foot above that of the low-riding Mazda3, but it trails the Seltos by roughly as much.\n\nWhat’s more, the CX-30’s limited in-cabin storage and poor sight lines — especially out the rear window — are liabilities versus more utilitarian rivals; Mazda placed last in both categories (tied with the Crosstrek for storage) in our comparison. Cargo space, at 13.7 cubic feet by Cars.com’s independent testing, is a smidge above the Mazda3 hatchback (13.1 cubic feet, also by our accounting) and in the same neighborhood as the Trailblazer and Crosstrek, though the whole group falls well short of the Seltos’ as-tested 16.2 cubic feet.\n\nMultimedia and Safety Technology\n\nWith the current-generation Mazda3 and now the CX-30, Mazda took a wayward turn on multimedia. No longer does the dashboard screen function as a touchscreen — even when the vehicle is stopped, as earlier iterations once did. It’s now a touch-free 8.8-inch display perched high atop the dashboard, controlled exclusively by a control knob and a few shortcut buttons on the center console. The setup especially stumps the CX-30’s standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration, as both work best through a straightforward touchscreen.\n\nStandard safety features include automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, lane departure warning with steering intervention and (impressively) adaptive cruise control down to a stop. The automatic braking passed third-party testing by the Insurance Information for Highway Safety, cementing the CX-30’s top scores across a battery of IIHS tests to earn the SUV a 2020 Top Safety Pick Plus award. (The award is likely to carry over for 2021, as the agency told us it has no plans to change criteria for the new calendar year.)\n\nNew for 2021, the CX-30 offers rear automatic braking, and top trim levels have new hands-on lane-centering steering by way of a feature called Traffic Jam Assist. Alas, TJA works only at speeds of 0-40 mph — a ceiling no longer imposed by most lane-centering systems available these days, regardless of price.\n\nShould You Buy a CX-30?\n\nIncluding destination, the CX-30 runs from just over $23,000 to about $36,000, a spread that overlaps a host of subcompact and compact SUVs to top out at the shores of the entry-luxury crowd. As a value alternative to the latter group, a CX-30 Turbo might justify itself; as a choice for driving fun among the mass-market models, a 2.5-liter example could also make sense. Given that the SUV ranks as Mazda’s second-best-selling model overall, it’s made the case to enough shoppers so far. \n\nBut larger market acceptance (the Crosstrek, for example, is three times more popular) will require a mainstream overhaul — a softer ride, bigger backseat, better visibility, simpler multimedia controls. As it stands, the normally aspirated CX-30 ranked in the bottom half of our 2020 comparison, and not for lack of quality or driving fun. With an infusion of high-end turbocharged trim levels, Mazda doubled down on everything we like, and it’s sure to get the CX-30 a cult following. But for all its remaining thorns, many mainstream shoppers may yet tune this Mazda out.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
