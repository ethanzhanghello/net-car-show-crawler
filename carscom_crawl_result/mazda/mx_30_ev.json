      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Mazda MX-30?\n\nDebuting last year as Mazda’s first all-electric vehicle, the Mazda MX-30 is a compact SUV with coupe-like styling and seating for five people. Sold only in California — in very small numbers — the MX-30 comes in two trims, both powered by a 143-horsepower electric motor paired with a 35.5-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery; the MX-30 is front-wheel drive. Competitors include the Kia Niro EV, Mini Cooper SE and Nissan Leaf.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Mazda MX-30?\n\nThe 2023 MX-30 is a carryover model with no significant changes.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Mazda MX-30 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n8.8-inch center display\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nAdaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability\nBlind spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert\nReverse automatic braking\nLane departure warning\nLane departure steering assist\nDriver attention monitor\nAutomatic high beams\nHeated front seats\nLeather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob\nHeated power-folding side mirrors with memory\n7-inch digital instrument display\nPower moonroof\nEight-way power driver’s seat with power lumbar support and memory\nRear parking sensors\n18-inch silver-finish aluminum alloy wheels\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n12-speaker premium audio system\nHeated steering wheel\n360-degree camera\nFront parking sensors\nKeyless entry\nSatellite radio\nFront cross-traffic alert\nBright-finish 18-inch aluminum alloy wheels\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nShould I Buy the 2023 Mazda MX-30?\n\nMazda fans looking for an EV should consider an MX-30 — as should anyone else who appreciates attributes like a nicely finished interior and responsive steering. The MX-30 is competitively priced, but its paltry 100-mile range will be a deal breaker for many buyers; almost all the MX-30’s EV rivals can travel considerably farther on a charge. With availability restricted to California and very limited production planned, finding an MX-30 likely won’t be easy.",
