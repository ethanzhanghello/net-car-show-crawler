      "expert_review": "The 2019 Mazda CX-3 continues to be a favorite of mine among the growing field of subcompact SUVs, and Mazda has updated it for 2019 to be a bit more of a near-premium choice among the littlest SUVs from mainstream brands. The changes are in line with Mazda’s efforts to stand out against much bigger mainstream brands by adding a more upscale feel.\n\nFor the 2019 refresh, Mazda also has addressed some of the shortcomings of the original, from cabin noise to cupholders. Meanwhile, it hasn’t altered what has been the CX-3’s strongest attributes since it rolled out as a 2016 model: stylish design and a sporty driving experience with class-leading handling.\n\nAlso unchanged is that the CX-3 is more low-riding hatchback car than SUV hauler, with limited backseat and cargo space compared with most rivals. It remains a choice for SUV buyers who value style and driving fun over maximum utility, who want the dessert before the meat and potatoes.\n\nThe CX-3 offers Sport, Touring and Grand Touring trim levels; all are powered by a 2.0-liter four-cylinder paired with a conventional six-speed automatic transmission and front- or all-wheel drive. The test car was a Grand Touring with all-wheel drive.\n\nLooking Good\n\nThe CX-3 makes a great first impression. The interesting contours and surfaces of the sleek and swoopy Mazda Kodo design language stand out among its small SUV competition, a group mostly akin to sensible shoes. For 2019, the busy seven-bar grille insert gets a bolder treatment with four more interesting bars; the lower bumper gets chrome accents that echo the trim on the lower doors. Standard on the Grand Touring test car and available on other models are LED headlights and a more distinctive LED taillight design. The Grand Touring also gets LED foglights and LED daytime running lights, and there’s a handsome new design for its 18-inch wheels. To really mix up a striking CX-3, add Mazda’s extra-cost Soul Red Crystal paint and stir.\n\nDriving Good\n\nMore than just looking sporty, the CX-3 drives like the sporty hatchback it really is. It’s lower than many rivals, with a carlike 6.1 inches of ground clearance. That helps the handling, though at the expense, even with all-wheel drive, of the kind of go in the snow you’d get with, say, a rival Subaru Crosstrek or Jeep Renegade, both of which ride more than 2 inches higher.\n\nBut in most conditions, the CX-3 can run doughnuts around its rivals. That’s thanks to its light weight (at most 2,952 pounds with all-wheel drive) and well-tuned chassis. Cornering is impressively flat and confident, and while the steering has less precision than Mazda’s best cars, it still has good weight and feel. The 2019 chassis improvements build on 2018 tweaks for better handling and the addition of Mazda’s G-Vectoring Control system, which adjusts engine power delivery and shifts weight for better cornering. It still feels very much like a front-drive car, however, even with the all-wheel-drive system.\n\nThe ride is firm but not harsh; it’s also more comfortable, though it still has some of the bobbing effect owing to the vehicle’s short wheelbase. The improved ride is thanks to suspension changes for all trim levels, as well as to a new tire design aimed to better absorb road imperfections and improve braking distance for the 18-inch wheels on the Touring and Grand Touring (16s are standard on the base model).\n\nThe 2.0-liter engine has gained a couple of more horsepower, for 148 hp total, but more important, it’s been tuned to deliver more torque at lower rpm across the range. The difference at lower speeds is noticeable, and the 2.0-liter continues to be mated to an excellent, crisp-shifting six-speed automatic — no continuously variable automatic transmission (or CVT drone) here as you’ll find with many vehicles in this class. The addition of a seven- or eight-speed transmission might offer more gearing flexibility to take advantage of the power that is available, however.\n\nWhile it still feels a little hesitant off the line, the CX-3 feels plenty zippy as you get the revs up, and you can boost throttle and transmission response with the more aggressive Sport setting. You also can shift for yourself with the manual mode (with paddle shifters in the Grand Touring model along with the stick).\n\nA bonus is that the CX-3 also delivers excellent fuel economy, with EPA ratings of 29/34/31 mpg city/highway/combined with front-wheel drive and 27/32/29 mpg with all-wheel drive. In the real world, I got better than the highway rating with a pump-measured 32.2 mpg (32.4 on the trip computer) for a Washington, D.C., to New York City round-trip in an all-wheel-drive CX-3 Grand Touring.\n\nFeeling Good on the Inside\n\nThe CX-3’s changes for 2019 are most extensive inside and are most apparent in the Grand Touring top trim, but they extend to the Sport and Touring models. The Grand Touring gets full-leather seating surfaces for the first time (not just leather trim), and it has stitching and pleated piping as you might expect in a more expensive vehicle. The 2019 Grand Touring interior also has new Parchment or black seat-color choices, new suedelike trim on the dashboard and stylish red trim accents. If that’s not enough, upscale extras available for the Grand Touring include a heated steering wheel, power driver’s seat with power lumbar support and driver’s seat memory.\n\nBut the quality cabin materials and trim for this class of vehicles also extend down the line into the Touring model’s leatherette (imitation leather) seats and the Sport model’s cloth upholstered interior. Neither feels cheap, which can’t be said of many subcompact SUV base models. The CX-3’s seats also have been reshaped and have new bolstering and firmer foam padding. They’re still sporty and hold you in, but they feel less narrow, and I found them much more comfortable for a long drive.\n\nThe comfort over a long haul also is aided by more sound insulation on all models that makes the CX-3 cabin now among the quieter small SUVs.\n\nThe true highlight of the new 2019 interior may be a real center console with a storage bin and a cupholder that you can use without having to flip up the center armrest (you used to have to pick one or the other). Some will miss the hand brake, but a switch to an electronic parking brake freed up the needed space. Unfortunately, you still have to raise the armrest to use a second cupholder, but baby steps — and if you don’t need the second one, it can be collapsed for more bin storage, so there is that.\n\nNot a highlight is the backseat. Apparently hearing the clamor for cupholders, the rear seat now has a fold-down armrest with two more. But the backseat still feels cramped, even for a subcompact SUV, and it’s inhospitable for more than short distances for adults. While the front of the cabin feels roomy and comfortable for this 6-footer, I did not have enough legroom to sit behind a similarly sized front-seat occupant. Headroom also is in short supply for a tall adult, and an added problem is the clamshell-style head restraints that pushed my head uncomfortably forward.\n\nThe small backseat makes the CX-3 more a personal car than a family hauler, so its cargo space might not be as important. Even still, it comes in on the low end among rivals at 12.4 cubic feet behind the backseat (and just 9.6 if you have the Bose premium audio). With the rear seatbacks folded, the CX-3 has 44.5 cubic feet (41.7 with the Bose system). That compares with, for example, the more traditional Nissan Rogue Sport small SUV’s 22.9 cubic feet behind the backseat and 61.1 cubic feet with the backseat folded.\n\nThat’s also less space than you could have with a cheaper Mazda3 compact sedan, though in these days of SUV popularity, that may miss the point for most shoppers. Also, if you’re trying to fit into a hard-to-get street parking space, the fact that the CX-3 is a foot shorter (and 3.4 inches taller) than the Mazda3 might make the cargo trade-off seem worthwhile.\n\nWhile you won’t be using the CX-3 to move your apartment, I did find the shape of the cargo space useful — accommodating three carry-on bags and assorted other gear for a trip below the level of the rear seatbacks. And with roof rails, the low height of the CX-3 could be an asset for tasks such as lifting a bike onto a roof-mounted rack.\n\nMultimedia Tech a Beat Behind\n\nThe CX-3 once was among the subcompact SUV leaders in multimedia tech, with a 7-inch touchscreen that can be operated when stopped, and knob and steering wheel controls for use underway. But as the subcompact SUV class has gotten more crowded and others have upped their game, the system now seems a beat behind the best. The interface is looking dated next to some of the flashier new high-definition graphics, and it’s a slower and more menu-driven user experience. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, which are fast becoming expected in a new car, still are AWOL in the CX-3.\n\nMeanwhile, the available head-up display, standard on the Grand Touring, now is brighter and packs in information, but it’s still reflected on a pop-up panel rather than higher on the windshield, making it awkward for some taller drivers to see (though I had no problem). And a backup camera is there, but the grid lines are static, missing a sure bet for an SUV with otherwise city-friendly parking ability.\n\nThe CX-3 does, however, have a pair of USB ports and a device cubby in the front of the redone center console, plus a 12-volt power point. A navigation system and good-sounding Bose premium audio system are standard on the Grand Touring, and the Bose audio also is optional for the mid-level Touring trim.\n\nSafety\n\nUnlike the multimedia tech, the CX-3 is a class leader among subcompact SUVs in safety and driver assistance tech. A low-speed automatic emergency braking system, blind spot warning and rear cross-traffic alert are standard on all models.\n\nMazda’s more sophisticated Sport i-Activsense Package of safety and driver assistance features is standard on the Grand Touring and optional on the lower trims: $1,100 on the base Sport and $1,000 on the Touring. We’d recommend getting it for either model. The robust package includes a more advanced and higher-speed front collision system with automatic braking and urban-essential pedestrian detection, as well as adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go, high-beam assist, lane departure warning and adaptive LED headlights. (Depending on the trim level, the package also may add a head-up display, LED taillights and automatic climate control.)\n\nFamily buyers should note that the rear seat did not impress Cars.com’s child-safety seat experts in our Car Seat Check. It earned no top scores and got low grades for compatibility for a rear-facing infant seat or convertible. Our technicians would not recommend this SUV for families with small children; Mazda’s larger CX-5 would be a better choice.\n\nThe 2019 CX-3 had not been safety-rated by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety as of publication. Once results are published, they will appear here. However, the 2019 is structurally nearly the same as the 2018 model that is rated a Top Safety Pick, with the top scores in all crash tests, a superior score for the advanced safety tech package and an acceptable score for headlights.\n\nValue in Its Strengths\n\nThe growing field of subcompact SUVs (and SUV-like vehicles) is a big tent with more variety in personality, strengths and weaknesses than almost any class. They arguably range from the large Subaru Crosstrek with standard all-wheel drive to the quirky front-drive-only Toyota C-HR to an off-road-capable Jeep Renegade. The carlike CX-3 carves its own niche, so its value depends on whether its strengths match what you want most for your daily driving.\n\nAs for pricing, the all-in Grand Touring test car was priced at $29,625 (all prices include destination charges), and it felt more expensive than that. If it seems like a lot for a subcompact SUV, even with all the options, consider that it’s comparable to loaded top models of other city-friendly small SUVs such as the 2018.5 Nissan Rogue Sport SL with Premium Package ($30,530), 2018 Hyundai Kona Ultimate ($29,680) and 2019 Honda HR-V Touring ($29,535). Compare them all here.\n\nBut you don’t need to spend that much to get most of what makes the CX-3 attractive. The Sport model — with the same excellent chassis, ride and noise improvement and retuned powertrain — is a well-featured base model that includes alloy wheels, push-button start, two USB ports, a 7-inch multimedia display and the standard safety tech detailed above. Even with the more advanced safety package, its sticker is a competitive $22,500 with front-wheel drive or $1,400 more for all-wheel drive.\n\nAnd a sweet spot for value is the mid-level Touring that adds some nice-to-have extras, such as piano-black trim, a good-looking leatherette interior with heated front seats, 18-inch wheels, keyless entry, heated side mirrors, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and gear shift, automatic climate control, and LED headlights and taillights. Even adding the options of all-wheel drive and the advanced safety package, the Touring totals $25,870. See a full comparison of the three trim levels here.\n\nThe CX-3 doesn’t try to be all things to all people — it’s a Mazda, after all, and reflects the brand’s core values of stylish design and driving fun. But subcompact SUV shoppers who want a good-looking and fun-to-drive hatchback with good gas mileage should have the CX-3 on their list.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Most significant changes: Night pedestrian detection now included as part of the low-speed forward collision detection and avoidance system; enhanced auto on/off feature for LED headlights\n\nPrice changes: None\n\nOn sale: September\n\nWhich should you buy, 2020 or 2021? With upgraded safety technology not costing any extra, the 2021 is the choice.\n\nMazda’s smallest SUV, the subcompact CX-3, soldiers on into the 2021 model year despite the presence of the slightly larger CX-30 subcompact SUV (and the Mazda3 hatchback). For 2020, Mazda consolidated the CX-3’s trim levels down to one, the Sport, which is still the only trim available for 2021.\n\nRelated: Mazda3: Which Should You Buy, 2020 or 2021?\n\nPrice\n\nThe good news is that the CX-3’s price hasn’t changed for 2021. This comes despite enhanced safety technology including a low-speed forward collision detection and avoidance system that’s capable of detecting pedestrians at night, as well as an improved auto on/off system for its standard LED headlights. A front-wheel-drive 2021 CX-3 will cost $21,740, and adding all-wheel drive costs another $1,400, bringing the price up to $23,140 (all prices include a $1,100 destination).\n\nEngine, Transmission and Features\n\nPower for either FWD or AWD versions of the CX-3 is still provided by a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine producing 148 horsepower and 146 pounds-feet of torque, paired to a six-speed automatic transmission.\n\nAdditional standard features on the CX-3 include Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, plus a full suite of advanced safety technologies, including forward collision detection and avoidance, adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning and blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert.\n\nRelease Date\n\nThe 2021 CX-3 goes on sale in September, according to Mazda, and with upgraded safety tech at no additional cost, it’s a more attractive option than an identically priced 2020.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: In a burgeoning class of tall hatchback cars masquerading as small SUVs, the Mazda CX-3 is … a hatchback — a sharp-looking, nimble one, with a quality interior and high gas mileage, but hardly an SUV.\n\nVersus the competition: In a not-very-sporty, not-very-quick class, the Mazda CX-3 is definitely sporty and reasonably quick, with a great drivetrain but less cabin and cargo room and lower ground clearance than competitors.\n\nApart from its optional all-wheel drive, the only thing distinguishing the CX-3 from the hatchback version of Mazda’s own Mazda3 compact car is interior space — of which it has less. Oh, and also its price, which is higher (see them compared side by side). Having established that, I predict the CX-3s will excel in the market and demonstrate why automakers are producing these subcompacts body-types and successfully selling them for more money than hatchback cars. Americans prefer SUVs over hatchbacks and (gasp!) wagons, practical and fun-to-drive considerations be damned. What else could explain the unquestionable appeal of what’s proving to be a class of unremarkable vehicles?\n\nThe Mazda CX-3 comes in Sport, Touring and Grand Touring trim levels, each with a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, a six-speed automatic transmission and a choice of front- or all-wheel drive (AWD). I tested the Touring and Grand Touring. (Compare all three trim levels here.)\n\nExterior & Styling\nLike so many of Mazda’s current models, the CX-3 looks great. Its snub-nosed front end recalls a competitor, the 2016 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport. The Mazda CX-3 also has the same kind of gray trim along its rocker panels and wheel arches that’s seen on direct competitors, such as the Subaru XV Crosstrek and the upscale Audi Allroad — both current market stars.\n\nWith ground clearance of 6.1 inches, the Mazda CX-3 is probably the most grounded-looking of the subcompact SUVs, though the Mini Countryman sits just 5.9 inches off the ground. The otherwise tall Chevrolet Trax clears just 6.2 inches. The Honda HR-V tops out at 6.7 inches, the Fiat 500X at 7.9 and the Crosstrek, Outlander Sport and Jeep Renegade max out between 8 and 8.7 inches. (See what I meant by the burgeoning subcompact SUV class?)\n\nAlso note that the CX-3 has no ground-clearance advantage versus the Mazda3 hatchback, so only its all-wheel drive will improve snow performance. For comparison, the Mazda CX-3 is 7.3 inches shorter from bumper to bumper, narrower by more than an inch, but 3.4 inches taller at the roofline versus the Mazda3. The compact CX-5 is 10.4 inches longer and 5.0 inches higher.\n\nHow It Drives\nWhere the Mazda CX-3 clearly beats every other model in its class is with its powertrain. The CX-3 has a 2.0-liter four-cylinder whose 146 horsepower compares to the Trax, HR-V, Outlander Sport and Crosstrek, but its curb weight is much lighter than all four — by as much as 388 pounds comparing AWD models. It seems like a recipe for quick sprints, but the CX-3 initially felt a little poky to me. While this isn’t the quickest vehicle class, the Renegade, 500X and Countryman S (with AWD) offer 14 to 35 hp more.\n\nIn time I concluded the feeling of modest acceleration in the CX-3 was just that: a feeling. The HR-V has a continuously variable automatic transmission, and the Fiat and Jeep have nine-speed automatics, both with a wide range of gear ratios that help make the most of a small engine, especially off the line. Note that the HR-V’s CVT, though a good one, still comes with the whine and drone we don’t care for, and the nine-speed shared by the two other models induces engine fury when it hops down to low gears, for better and worse.\n\nCompare the Mazda CX-3, whose broad engine lb-ft torque band and responsive six-speed automatic cause less drama and provide vastly more pleasing operation in normal driving. But because there are just six speeds, sometimes you can stand on the accelerator and it doesn’t seem to do anything. There’s just modest acceleration and no kickdown to a lower gear, because at some speeds there just isn’t one to go to, even when in Sport mode.\n\nWhen there is another gear to access, the CX-3 gets to it promptly. That can’t be said of some competitors, especially the nine-speeds, which have a terrible case of indecision. If you want to shift the CX-3 for yourself, you can move the gear selector into the manual mode — or, in the Grand Touring, use the steering wheel’s shift paddles.\n\nSome of our editors found the CX-3 unduly noisy, but this vehicle class isn’t the place to go if you’re looking for serenity, either.\n\nThe Mazda CX-3 earns points for matching the class-leaders in gas mileage without a higher gear count or a CVT. Equipped with AWD, it’s rated 27/32/29 mpg city/highway/combined, tying the comparable HR-V exactly. The Crosstrek also gets an estimated 29 mpg combined, but 1 mpg less in the city and 2 mpg more on the highway. With all-wheel drive, the Outlander Sport tops out at 27 mpg combined and the 500X and Renegade at a mere 24 mpg.\n\nFor those keeping score, the front-drive CX-3 rates 29/35/31 mpg, and the Mazda3 hatchback (which is exclusively front-drive) tops out at 30/40/33 mpg.\n\nThe CX-3’s roadholding was excellent with Yokohama Avid S34 all-season tires. The Touring trim level with front-wheel drive and 16-inch alloy wheels was good, but I preferred the all-wheel drive on the top, Grand Touring, trim level, which had 18-inch wheels. All three trims share the same suspension tuning. I felt no great difference in ride quality between the 16- and 18-inch wheels. Both are sporty but comfortable.\n\nThough Mazda touts this AWD system as intelligent, it never gives the feel of a rear-biased drive system. It’s very much a front-drive-based configuration with about 60 percent of the weight in the front — just like every other model in this class.\n\nThough the rear end employs a relatively inexpensive, but space-efficient, torsion-beam suspension rather than a fully independent setup, it seemed unfazed in relentless switchbacks and hairpins. Though the chassis is impressive, I wasn’t bowled over by the steering. Mazda tuned the electric assist nicely, with good torque buildup off-center, and the ratio is well-suited for the car. Overall, however, feedback wasn’t up to Mazda standards. It felt a bit artificial to me — though some editors lauded it. In the underwhelming context of subcompact SUVs, though, it’s certainly more impressive.\n\nInterior\nInterior space is arguably the Mazda CX-3’s greatest shortfall. By the numbers, front-seat legroom is on the high side, shy of only the Crosstrek. Front headroom is less than all competitors, yet at 6 feet tall, I was perfectly fine in the driver’s seat — even in the Grand Touring, whose standard moonroof (optional on Touring) robs almost an additional inch of space. Some of our editors found the front seats themselves a bit snug, and one editor wished powered seats were offered, as they are on some competitors but aren’t here, even as an option.\n\nMaybe he was just expecting a taller seating position. That’s understandable, because the CX-3 driver sits just two-tenths of an inch higher than in a Mazda3 — a good 2.2 inches lower than the compact CX-5’s driver’s seat. Subcompact SUVs hardly tower over surrounding traffic, but the Mazda CX-3’s competitors typically give a higher seating vantage.\n\nFor backseat legroom, the CX-3 is definitely among the smallest of the bunch, with fractions of an inch less than the Trax and the Crosstrek but several inches less than the HR-V, which is one of the roomiest. Rear headroom is also down more than an inch versus some of those models. (See all the specs side by side.)\n\nWith all its newly introduced models, the subcompact SUV class has some nice interiors, and the CX-3 is right up there. The Sport has cloth seats, the Touring gets a nice combination of cloth and imitation leather, and the Grand Touring’s genuine leather has faux suede seat inserts and door panels.\n\nRather than using crappo Thin-Mint-style air-conditioning vents, Mazda included intricate, nicely finished vents, complete with air-volume knobs. Prominent items like this are a wise place for automakers to spend some money; it pays off. The 7-inch touch-screen display is another high-value standard item.\n\nThe main shortfall I noted was that the displays flanking the Mazda CX-3 Touring’s speedometer gauge were too dim to see, even in overcast daylight. The Grand Touring, which has a central tachometer instead, with an inset digital speedometer and seemingly the same bookending displays, didn’t have this problem. The Mazda CX-3 Grand Touring also adds Active Driving Display (a head-up display using a small, transparent window atop the dashboard).\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe Mazda CX-3 combines a few simple mechanical controls with a standard Mazda Connect system, which comprises a 7-inch display atop the dashboard and a controller knob and buttons on the center console. The infotainment display functions as a touch-screen when the car is stationary, but the knob is necessary once in motion. Though it looks like what we’ve come to perceive as a navigation system, the navigation function comes only on the Grand Touring, where it’s standard. The system has control sections labeled Applications, Entertainment, Communications and Settings. As of now, Mazda doesn’t support Apple CarPlay or Android Auto, which some cars offer as a means to add onscreen navigation from a compatible smartphone.\n\nThe standard stereo supports AM/FM/CD, Bluetooth hands-free telephone and audio streaming, plus internet radio stations Aha, Pandora and Stitcher. Connections include two USB ports and an analog audio input jack. The Grand Touring brings the aforementioned navigation and a nice-sounding Bose premium stereo that adds HD radio and SiriusXM satellite radio with a four-month trial subscription. The Touring trim can optionally have this sound system, too.\n\nA relatively new offering from Mazda is Mazda Mobile Start, a telematics-style system that allows the owner to remote-start the car, find the car, lock and unlock the doors and more by means of a smartphone. It requires $500 dealer-installed cellular hardware and, after one year of initial service, a $65 annual subscription. In the Trax, OnStar hardware is standard.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe CX-3’s cargo volume behind the backseat is roughly half that of several competitors, and it’s among the smallest with the backseat folded down, as well. The Mini Countryman is one exception, having less cargo volume with its seats down, but it still edges out the Mazda with the seats up. Specifically, the CX-3 has 12.4 and 44.5 cubic feet behind the seats and maximum, respectively. The Mazda3 hatch has 20.2 and 47.1 cubic feet.\n\nThe CX-3 has a reasonably accommodating glove compartment, door pockets and a cubby in front of the shifter for mobile devices. There’s no center storage console, though. The most unique feature is a smartphone cavity built into higher trim levels’ center armrest. Interesting idea, but in the first car I tested the tab intended to hold the device in place marred my phone’s plastic-film screen protector. In the second car, a felt pad I presume is there to prevent the earlier mishap smeared backing adhesive on the phone. Proceed with caution.\n\nSafety\nAn all-new model, the Mazda CX-3 had not been crash-tested as of publication. Once results are published, they will appear here.\n\nA backup camera is standard. The Touring adds a blind spot monitor with rear cross-traffic alert, and the Grand Touring adds an adaptive front lighting system. Available only on the Grand Touring, the i-Activsense option package includes forward collision warning with low-speed autonomous braking, lane departure warning, adaptive cruise control, rain-sensing windshield wipers and auto on/off headlights with automatic high-beam control. See all safety features listed here.\n\nFor child-safety seat use, the CX-3’s grades are mixed, partly due to the small backseat. See the details in our Car Seat Check.\n\nValue in Its Class\nWe want to believe subcompact SUVs are valued for their roominess and versatility, and if that’s true the Mazda CX-3 has some disadvantages due to its smaller interior volume. But it’s cleverly equipped with features that count, including the multimedia system and nicer materials and controls up high, where occupants see and interact with them.\n\nYou’ll have to step up to a Sport trim for more advanced features, like heated seats, keyless access and heated side signal mirrors, along with the first tier of active safety features detailed above. Naturally, it’s the top, GT trim that impresses most, with LED headlights, fog lights and taillights, a head-up display, automatic climate control, leather seats and more. Of course, it will cost you. Loaded with the i-Activsense option package and Soul Red paint, the Mazda CX-3 GT tops out at $29,340 including a destination fee.\n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "Over the past week, our readers have shown impeccable taste when it comes to vehicle styling, bringing the 2018 Lexus LC 500h into second place among our most read car reviews. In fact, more people read the review (many times over) during the last week than the number of LC 500h examples Cars.com reviewer Joe Bruzek found for sale on our site; he was only able to track down nine listed across the country when writing his review.\n\nRelated: More Expert Car Reviews\n\nBruzek has high praise for the LC 500h’s looks, but the powertrain and driving experience are more of a mixed bag:\n\n“The LC is an amazing-looking car that drives amazingly with the V-8, but it loses a lot of its soul not having the responsive, cackling gas engine,” he notes.\n\nBruzek also expressed disappointment about the use of hybrid technology solely for fuel efficiency while some competitors’ electrified models get an electrifying performance boost. Check out his review to see if the fuel economy advantage makes the LC 500h worth it to you.\n\nVideo watchers last week focused on two redesigned cars, 2019 versions of the Nissan Altima and BMW X5. Our First Drive video for the X5 occupies the top spot, with the Altima’s First Drive close behind. Rounding out the top five are Cars.com reviewer Mike Hanley’s take on why the 2018 Audi A4 is a winner, useful car hacks and our review of the 2019 Jeep Cherokee.\n\nTop 5 Reviews\n\n1. 2018 Land Rover Range Rover Review: Plush and Poised, With a Push-Button Problem\n\n2. 2018 Lexus LC 500h Review: High Class and High Mileage\n\n3. 2018 Maserati GranTurismo Convertible Review: A Fine Wine Borders on Overripe\n\n4. 2019 Mazda CX-3 Review: Good Things, But in a Small Package\n\n5. 2019 Hyundai Veloster Review: Funky Fun\n\nTop 5 Videos\n\n1. 2019 BMW X5: First Drive\n\n2. 2019 Nissan Altima: First Drive\n\n3.

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in November 2015 about the 2016 CX-3, but little of substance has changed for this year. To see what’s new for 2017, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years. To read the full review of the 2016 CX-3, click here.\n\nApart from its optional all-wheel drive, the only thing distinguishing the CX-3 from the hatchback version of Mazda’s own Mazda3 compact car is interior space — of which it has less. Oh, and also its price, which is higher (see them compared side by side). Having established that, I predict the CX-3 will excel in the market and demonstrate why automakers are producing these subcompacts and successfully selling them for more money than hatchback cars. Americans prefer SUVs over hatchbacks and (gasp!) wagons, practical considerations be damned. What else could explain the unquestionable appeal of what’s proving to be a class of unremarkable vehicles?\n\nThe CX-3 comes in Sport, Touring and Grand Touring trim levels, each with a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, a six-speed automatic transmission and a choice of front- or all-wheel drive. I tested the Touring and Grand Touring. (Compare all three trim levels here.)\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nLike so many of Mazda’s current models, the CX-3 looks great. Its snub-nosed front end recalls a competitor, the 2016 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport. The CX-3 also has the same kind of gray trim along its rocker panels and wheel arches that’s seen on direct competitors, such as the Subaru XV Crosstrek and the upscale Audi Allroad — both current market stars.\n\nWith ground clearance of 6.1 inches, the CX-3 is probably the most grounded-looking of the subcompact SUVs, though the Mini Countryman sits just 5.9 inches off the ground. The otherwise tall Chevrolet Trax clears just 6.2 inches. The Honda HR-V tops out at 6.7 inches, the Fiat 500X at 7.9 and the Crosstrek, Outlander Sport and Jeep Renegade max out between 8 and 8.7 inches. (See what I meant by the burgeoning subcompact SUV class?)\n\nAlso note that the CX-3 has no ground-clearance advantage versus the Mazda3 hatchback, so only its all-wheel drive will improve snow performance. For comparison, the CX-3 is 7.3 inches shorter from bumper to bumper, narrower by more than an inch, but 3.4 inches taller at the roofline versus the Mazda3. The compact CX-5 is 10.4 inches longer and 5.0 inches higher.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nWhere the CX-3 clearly beats every other model in its class is with its powertrain. The CX-3 has a 2.0-liter four-cylinder whose 146 horsepower compares to the Trax, HR-V, Outlander Sport and Crosstrek, but its curb weight is much lighter than all four — by as much as 388 pounds comparing all-wheel-drive models. It seems like a recipe for quick sprints, but the CX-3 initially felt a little poky to me. While this isn’t the quickest vehicle class, the Renegade, 500X and Countryman S (with all-wheel drive) offer 14 to 35 hp more.\n\nIn time I concluded the feeling of modest acceleration in the CX-3 was just that: a feeling. The HR-V has a continuously variable automatic transmission, and the Fiat and Jeep have nine-speed automatics, both with a wide range of gear ratios that help make the most of a small engine, especially off the line. Note that the HR-V’s CVT, though a good one, still comes with the whine and drone we don’t care for, and the nine-speed shared by the two other models induces engine fury when it hops down to low gears, for better and worse.\n\nCompare the CX-3, whose broad engine torque band and responsive six-speed automatic cause less drama and provide vastly more pleasing operation in normal driving. But because there are just six speeds, sometimes you can stand on the accelerator and it doesn’t seem to do anything. There’s just modest acceleration and no kickdown to a lower gear, because at some speeds there just isn’t one to go to, even when in Sport mode.\n\nWhen there is another gear to access, the CX-3 gets to it promptly. That can’t be said of some competitors, especially the nine-speeds, which have a terrible case of indecision. If you want to shift the CX-3 for yourself, you can move the gear selector into the manual mode — or, in the Grand Touring, use the steering wheel’s shift paddles.\n\nSome of our editors found the CX-3 unduly noisy, but this vehicle class isn’t the place to go if you’re looking for serenity, either.\n\nThe CX-3 earns points for matching the class-leaders in gas mileage without a higher gear count or a CVT. Equipped with all-wheel drive, it’s rated 27/32/29 mpg city/highway/combined, tying the comparable HR-V exactly. The Crosstrek also gets an estimated 29 mpg combined, but 1 mpg less in the city and 2 mpg more on the highway. With all-wheel drive, the Outlander Sport tops out at 27 mpg combined and the 500X and Renegade at a mere 24 mpg.\n\nFor those keeping score, the front-drive CX-3 rates 29/35/31 mpg, and the Mazda3 hatchback (which is exclusively front-drive) tops out at 30/40/33 mpg.\n\nThe CX-3’s roadholding was excellent with Yokohama Avid S34 all-season tires. The Touring trim level with front-wheel drive and 16-inch alloy wheels was good, but I preferred the all-wheel drive on the top, Grand Touring, trim level, which had 18-inch wheels. All three trims share the same suspension tuning. I felt no great difference in ride quality between the 16- and 18-inch wheels. Both are sporty but comfortable.\n\nThough Mazda touts this all-wheel-drive system as intelligent, it never gives the feel of a rear-biased drive system. It’s very much a front-drive-based configuration with about 60 percent of the weight in the front — just like every other model in this class.\n\nThough the rear end employs a relatively inexpensive, but space-efficient, torsion-beam suspension rather than a fully independent setup, it seemed unfazed in relentless switchbacks and hairpins. Though the chassis is impressive, I wasn’t bowled over by the steering. Mazda tuned the electric assist nicely, with good torque buildup off-center, and the ratio is well-suited for the car. Overall, however, feedback wasn’t up to Mazda standards. It felt a bit artificial to me — though some editors lauded it. In the underwhelming context of subcompact SUVs, though, it’s certainly more impressive.\n\nInterior\n\nInterior space is arguably the CX-3’s greatest shortfall. By the numbers, front-seat legroom is on the high side, shy of only the Crosstrek. Front headroom is less than all competitors, yet at 6 feet tall, I was perfectly fine in the driver’s seat — even in the Grand Touring, whose standard moonroof (optional on Touring) robs almost an additional inch of space. Some of our editors found the front seats themselves a bit snug, and one editor wished powered seats were offered, as they are on some competitors but aren’t here, even as an option.\n\nMaybe he was just expecting a taller seating position. That’s understandable, because the CX-3 driver sits just two-tenths of an inch higher than in a Mazda3 — a good 2.2 inches lower than the compact CX-5’s driver’s seat. Subcompact SUVs hardly tower over surrounding traffic, but the CX-3’s competitors typically give a higher seating vantage.\n\nFor backseat legroom, the CX-3 is definitely among the smallest of the bunch, with fractions of an inch less than the Trax and the Crosstrek but several inches less than the HR-V, which is one of the roomiest. Rear headroom is also down more than an inch versus some of those models. (See all the specs side by side.)\n\nWith all its newly introduced models, the subcompact SUV class has some nice interiors, and the CX-3 is right up there. The Sport has cloth seats, the Touring gets a nice combination of cloth and imitation leather, and the Grand Touring’s genuine leather has faux suede seat inserts and door panels.\n\nRather than using crappo Thin-Mint-style air-conditioning vents, Mazda included intricate, nicely finished vents, complete with air-volume knobs. Prominent items like this are a wise place for automakers to spend some money; it pays off. The 7-inch touch-screen display is another high-value standard item.\n\nThe main shortfall I noted was that the displays flanking the Touring’s speedometer gauge were too dim to see, even in overcast daylight. The Grand Touring, which has a central tachometer instead, with an inset digital speedometer and seemingly the same bookending displays, didn’t have this problem. The Grand Touring also adds Active Driving Display (a head-up display using a small, transparent window atop the dashboard).\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nThe CX-3 combines a few simple mechanical controls with a standard Mazda Connect system, which comprises a 7-inch display atop the dashboard and a controller knob and buttons on the center console. The display functions as a touch-screen when the car is stationary, but the knob is necessary once in motion. Though it looks like what we’ve come to perceive as a navigation system, the navigation function comes only on the Grand Touring, where it’s standard. The system has control sections labeled Applications, Entertainment, Communications and Settings. As of now, Mazda doesn’t support Apple CarPlay or Android Auto, which some cars offer as a means to add onscreen navigation from a compatible smartphone.\n\nThe standard stereo supports AM/FM/CD, Bluetooth hands-free telephone and audio streaming, plus internet radio stations Aha, Pandora and Stitcher. Connections include two USB ports and an analog audio input jack. The Grand Touring brings the aforementioned navigation and a nice-sounding Bose premium stereo that adds HD radio and SiriusXM satellite radio with a four-month trial subscription. The Touring trim can optionally have this sound system, too.\n\nA relatively new offering from Mazda is Mazda Mobile Start, a telematics-style system that allows the owner to remote-start the car, find the car, lock and unlock the doors and more by means of a smartphone. It requires $500 dealer-installed cellular hardware and, after one year of initial service, a $65 annual subscription. In the Trax, OnStar hardware is standard.\n\nCargo & Storage\n\nThe CX-3’s cargo volume behind the backseat is roughly half that of several competitors, and it’s among the smallest with the backseat folded down, as well. The Mini Countryman is one exception, having less cargo volume with its seats down, but it still edges out the Mazda with the seats up. Specifically, the CX-3 has 12.4 and 44.5 cubic feet behind the seats and maximum, respectively. The Mazda3 hatch has 20.2 and 47.1 cubic feet.\n\nThe CX-3 has a reasonably accommodating glove compartment, door pockets and a cubby in front of the shifter for mobile devices. There’s no center storage console, though. The most unique feature is a smartphone cavity built into higher trim levels’ center armrest. Interesting idea, but in the first car I tested the tab intended to hold the device in place marred my phone’s plastic-film screen protector. In the second car, a felt pad I presume is there to prevent the earlier mishap smeared backing adhesive on the phone. Proceed with caution.\n\nSafety\n\nAn all-new model, the CX-3 had not been crash-tested as of publication. Once results are published, they will appear here.\n\nA backup camera is standard. The Touring adds a blind spot monitor with rear cross-traffic alert, and the Grand Touring adds an adaptive front lighting system. Available only on the Grand Touring, the i-Activsense option package includes forward collision warning with low-speed autonomous braking, lane departure warning, adaptive cruise control, rain-sensing windshield wipers and auto on/off headlights with automatic high-beam control. See all safety features listed here.\n\nFor child-safety seat use, the CX-3’s grades are mixed, partly due to the small backseat. See the details in our Car Seat Check.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nWe want to believe subcompact SUVs are valued for their roominess and versatility, and if that’s true the CX-3 has some disadvantages due to its smaller interior volume. But it’s cleverly equipped with features that count, including the multimedia system and nicer materials and controls up high, where occupants see and interact with them.\n\nYou’ll have to step up to a Sport trim for more advanced features, like heated seats, keyless access and heated side signal mirrors, along with the first tier of active safety features detailed above. Naturally, it’s the top, GT trim that impresses most, with LED headlights, fog lights and taillights, a head-up display, automatic climate control, leather seats and more. Of course, it will cost you. Loaded with the i-Activsense option package and Soul Red paint, the CX-3 GT tops out at $29,340 including a destination fee.",
