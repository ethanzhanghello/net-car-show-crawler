      "expert_review": "Mazda’s 1995 Protege brings the subcompact gene pool to its saturation point.\n\nNow we have stylish cab-forward designs in pint size (Chrysler’s Neon), smug little cars with dual air bags (Ford Aspire), shrunken sedans delivering motorcycle mileage of 56 m.p.g. (Honda Civic), four-door toys with anti-lock brakes (Toyota Corolla), spunky wheels modified for weekend club racing (Neon again),and a full flea circus of tykes with sun roofs and CDs, leather upholstery and alloy wheels, and all the power and remote controls of grown-up autos.\n\nThere aren’t many duds in the litter. Kia’s Sephia–with mechanical seat belts and the look of a 1988 rerun–might be a questionable place to spend hard-earned money. So would the door mouse-powered Hyundai Excel–recently, and thankfully, replaced by the Accent. (The Excel, you may recall, hit 115 m.p.h. only when Rodney King was at the wheel–or so said the CHP.)\n\nMazda’s Protege, thanks to a combination of refined engineering, quality equipment and superb balance when country roads become gymnastic, falls far from this latter lot.\n\nDespite subcompact sizing, Protege’s interior offers more shoving and snuggling room than even mid-size cars from BMW and Mercedes. Credit here goes to something called OptiSpace Design. Mazda likes to rattle on about interior packaging and functionality of space, but it all boils down to rethinking every aspect of design–from engine compartment to body styling–to optimize the process of scooping out a cabin.\n\nExample: Inside panels on doors are usually flat with cranks, buttons and elbow rests poking into the interior of the car. Protege panels are concave, which buries all those handles and adds width to the passenger compartment. Eureka! OptiSpace Design.\n\nThe base engine has been puffed up from 82 to 92 horsepower from a new 1.5-liter, 16-valve four banger. It will be standard equipment on the Protege DX primer and the somewhat ritzier LX model.\n\nDespite this increase in oomph, Protege’s fuel efficiency has improved by almost 10%–from 29 m.p.g in town and 36 m.p.g. on the highway, to an impressive 31 and 39 m.p.g.\n\nAs part of Mazda’s general downsizing and re-arranging to staunch finances that have become a blood bath, there will be only one optional engine in the lineup. Fortunately for those who like a little peppermint in their motoring, that means a Protege ES equipped with Mazda Miata’s 1.8-liter engine. This proven four from a highly successful two-seater produces 122 horsepower and more adolescent fun than might be healthy for sober adults.\n\nThe Protege’s body has been stiffened considerably by supercomputer analysis and reinforced cross members for the suspension–all of which removes much of the roll from hard cornering and most of the pitch from serious braking. This new muscle tone also produces a small car devoid of skittishness, in fact a subcompact of exquisite manners and a high measure of balance and security. Even among drivers prone to pretty impolite dancing.\n\nPrices, unfortunately, are up. Way up.\n\nBase model of the 1994 Protege with a five-speed manual cost $9,500. The new primer is a better equipped DX stickered at $12,000. And a Protege ES with the Miata engine transplant costs $16,145.\n\nHere’s the really sad comparison: For $1,000 more you could drive home in a small stick of dynamite known as the Ford Mustang GT with a 5.0 liter V-8.\n\n*\n\nWhere the car falls on its nose, however, is in exterior styling. Not only is Protege cautious and mainstream–obviously aimed at cautious and mainstream buyers–it is a miniaturized Millenia, with front and rear sculpture recognizable knockoffs from Mazda’s new $26,000 luxury sedan.\n\nThe oddity here is that Millenia styling works for Millenia. But then Millenia is a larger, rather dramatic vehicle. When its lines are adapted for a sedan of reduced dimensions, most of the styling subtleties get lost in the transmogrifier.\n\nSo, with name and logos taped over, one could examine Protege, walk around it, sit in it, poke it, sneak up on it when it’s sleeping–and there would be no clues to its maker. Mazda? Nissan? Honda? Montgomery Ward?\n\nThe interior is much more enjoyable. All dials are clearly visible from a dashboard also concave to enhance the illusion and actuality of roomier insides. Cruise control, turn signals, gearshift and windshield wiper stalk fall easily to hand.\n\nBut the radio controls need relocating. They are low on the center console, which makes tuning a long reach, even for those wearing 36-inch sleeves. Despite a passenger-side fascia stuffed with an air bag, there’s also a glove box; but only a cube of a cubby between the seats, and door trays that are little more than a suggestion.\n\nPuttering around town, the Protege ES is well enough insulated to keep road noise and sound pollution at non-irritating levels. The five-speed manual doesn’t have the silkiness of, say, a Honda Accord, but its resistance is just enough to keep one thinking about the job at hand, without ever opposing the physical effort of shifting.\n\n*\n\nThe car’s element seems to be a rapid canter to those realms that give John Law reasonable cause for lurking on medians. The steering is pure Mazda: quick in response, true in tracking and creating laser-true cornering.\n\nAt speed and never below 4,000r.p.m, slipping from fifth to fourth, to third and back to fourth, produces slowing, acceleration and stability in all the right quantities.\n\nIt is not blinding power and whiplash acceleration. Itis agile, peppy performance that elevates stitching through traffic to the edge of exhilarating. In this, Protege stands among the leaders of the subcompact pack.\n\nYet some critics have slapped the car for lacking spirit and soul. They say that Mazda–with a reputation for building for niches, the company that gave us the rotary-engined RX-7 and the Mazda Miata–should have given Protege something really novel to push it ahead of intense competition.\n\nA suggestion.\n\nWhy not stuff the car with all manner of computer systems?\n\nIt might have a sterling future as the Mazda Prodigy.\n\n1994 Mazda Protege ES\n\nBase Price: $16,145.\n\nThe Good: Finely engineered for superior handling. Subcompact with mid-size roominess. Economical but peppy Mazda Miata engine.\n\nThe Bad: Safe styling.\n\nThe Ugly: Hiked prices.\n\nCost As tested, $17,440 (Includes optional power moon roof, 14-inch aluminum alloy wheels. Also standard air conditioning, cruise control, anti-lock brakes, four-speaker sound system, sport seats, tilt steering, power windows and remote releases.)\n\nEngine 1.8-liter, 16-valve, in-line-four developing 122 horsepower.\n\nType Front-engine, front-drive, subcompact sedan .\n\nPerformance 0-60 m.p.h., as tested, 10.1 seconds. Top speed, estimated, 120 m.p.h. Fuel consumption, EPA city and highway, 26 and 32 m.p.g.\n\nCurb Weight 2,600 pounds.",

      "expert_review": "If you are looking for a solid, well-built small car, be prepared to wear out a bit of shoe leather.\n\nFrom foreign and domestic automakers, the market is jammed with excellent small cars.\n\nSomeof the best ones on the market include Saturn’s SL sedan, Chevy’s Geo Prizm, Honda’s Civic, Subaru’s new Impreza, Ford’s Escort and this week’s test car, the LX version of Mazda’s Protege.\n\nAll of these cars made it to the top because they deliver solid value, exceptional quality, terrific performance and gas mileage, and exceptional handling.\n\nThat’s why you’ll have to look beyond the obvious to get the best car for your money.\n\nStart by comparing the safety equipment that comes standard or that is available as an option. Then look at warranties. And check the rebates and incentives to see who’s offering the best deal.\n\nThe Protege LX comes up a winner in most categories.\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nUnlike other small cars, the Protege LX doesn’t take long to accelerate. Overall performance rates excellent, thanks to the Protege’s double overhead cam 16-valve four cylinder. This fuel-injected power plant develops 125-horsepower.\n\nOur test car came with a five-speed manual transmission, but if you wish to avoid shifting, a computer-controlled four-speed automatic is available as an option.\n\nThe Protege’s shifter and clutch pedal are easy to operate. Sometimes shifting can become tiresome, especially when you drive in heavy traffic. But even in the worst Interstate 4 traffic jam, I found the Protege to be civilized.\n\nThe engine runs as smoothly and quietly as a sewing machine. It pulls strongly all the way to its 6,500 rpm limit, and the test car delivered a solid 26 mpg in the city and 31 mpg on the highway.\n\nHANDLING\n\nI can remember when small cars were dull, and people bought them because they couldn’t afford anything else.\n\nThe Protege’s excellent road manners make it a car you’d want to drive, even if you could afford something larger.\n\nMazda has equipped the Protege with four-wheel independent suspension. The body does not lean much in hard cornering.\n\nRoad noise is well muffled, and bumps are handled with finesse. The power-assisted rack-and-pinion steering is light and crisp, and the four-wheel disc brakes provide ample stopping power.\n\nThe car’s excellent front and rear visibility enhances your feeling of the car’s roadworthiness. It feels solid and well built, nimble, agile and easy to drive.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nThe Protege is one subcompact car that was actually designed with the comfort of rear-seat passengers in mind. A person who is 5-feet-11 or so can sit in the rear seat and not have to wedge his or her feet under the seat or struggle to get comfortable. Headroom is good too.\n\nIf there’s a bigger trunk in a similar sized subcompact, I have yet to see it. The Protege’s trunk can swallow 12.8 cubic feet of cargo.\n\nAnd loading items in to the trunk will be easy because the lip of the trunk lid extends down to the bumper.\n\nIf you flip the rear seats forward, long items like fishing rods and skis can be stowed inside the car.\n\nThe cloth-covered bucket seats are on the firm side, but supportive and comfortable.\n\nGenerally, the dash is sensible. It contains a cleanly styled set of analog gauges. Most of the switches – with the exception of the cruise control switch – are easy to get to and operate. The cruise control switch is buried on the lower left side of the dash.\n\nThe Protege LX is equipped with a high quality AM/FM cassette radio and a powerful air conditioner.\n\nOur test car came with electric windows, power mirrors and door locks, and an electric sunroof.\n\nThis year’s model doesn’t come with an air bag or anti-lock brakes.\n\nMazda’s Fred Aikins said the Protege is scheduled to receive driver- and passenger-side air bags and anti-lock brakes by the 1995 model year.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe Proteg� sedan received a front-end face-lift for 2001. Now, Mazda is helping to revive the small hatchback body style with its new Proteg�5 sport wagon, launched as an early 2002 model.\n\nDuring the 2001 model year, Mazda introduced another variant of the Proteg�, dubbed MP3 to denote its Kenwood audio system. The MP3 also is fitted with a high-output 140-horsepower engine and a number of performance-oriented components from racing suppliers. Only 1,500 units were built initially, and they were sold out before they reached the United States, but Mazda is considering bringing back the MP3 later in the 2002 model year.\n\nExcept for the MP3, all models now use a 130-hp, 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine designed by Mazda. The 1.6-liter engine, previously standard on the DX sedan, has been dropped. Each 2002 vehicle benefits from a reinforced body/chassis structure, and a new modular audio system with a standard CD player is installed in all sedans.\n\nA redesign isnt likely until 2004, but when it does occur, the Ford Focus platform may possibly be used. Ford owns a controlling interest in Mazda. Meanwhile, Mazda continues to promote itself as a sporty car company, using its zoom-zoom advertising theme.\n\nExterior\nSlightly longer than the Honda Civic, the Proteg� has a 102.8-inch wheelbase and measures 175.3 inches long overall. What Mazda describes as European-inspired styling emerged from a collaboration among designers in Europe, Japan and California. A black-chrome grille, fog lights and a rear spoiler are part of the DX, LX and ES sedans. Alloy wheels hold 16-inch tires, but 15-inch wheels are optional on the DX model. New body-colored mirrors go on the LX and ES, and a power moonroof is available.\n\nThe MP3 sedan features a large front air dam with integrated driving lights, side sill extensions, a large rear spoiler and low-profile tires on special Racing Hart 17-inch wheels. MP3 models are finished in Laser Blue or Vivid Yellow.\n\nInterior\nThis is one of the roomier small cars on the market. As a result of what Mazda calls OptiSpace design, the Proteg� can actually accommodate the five passengers that it claims to hold. Interior volume amounts to 92.6 cubic feet, and it has adequate rear legroom and headroom for adult passengers. A split, folding rear seat supplements the 13.2-cubic-foot trunk space.\n\nAir conditioning is optional on the DX sedan and standard on other models. White-faced instruments and a new modular audio system with a CD player are standard, and a new center console includes covered storage. The MP3 sedan includes a Nardi three-spoke steering wheel and MazdaSpeed lightweight pedals, and the Proteg� has a shorter gearshift lever.\n\nUnder the Hood\nMazda has dropped the 1.6-liter engine, so all DX, LX and ES models now carry a 2.0-liter four-cylinder that produces 130 hp. The engine in the MP3 sedan develops 140 hp, using a low-back pressure Racing Beat exhaust system and working with a manual shift. In other models, either a five-speed-manual or four-speed-automatic transmission can be installed.\n\nSafety\nSide-impact airbags, antilock brakes and electronic brake-force distribution are available in an option group. All models now have all-disc brakes.\n\nDriving Impressions\nThe Proteg� is among the more spacious and well-equipped compact sedans. It also is highly competent on the road and fun to drive, befitting the claims for sportiness made by Mazda. Priced in the same league as more ordinary sedans, Mazdas compact stands a strong cut above in the handling department. Performance also is appealing, especially when equipped with the manual shift and larger engine.\n\nAs expected, acceleration in the MP3 is stronger than that of the regular Proteg�, though the difference is not dramatic. Its a little more taxing to drive, due to the need for heavier pressure on the clutch pedal, and the exhaust tone adds to the MP3s sportiness. Where the MP3 really shines is in its handling talents. In quick, tight turns, the MP3 clings tenaciously to the pavement. Body lean is minimal, and theres only moderate penalty to be paid in ride comfort.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2002 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "Mazda Motors of America must have been doing something right for its past 25 years on the American market.\n\nFor 1995, the Japanese automaker has redesigned and re-engineered its Protege, the company’s best-selling model in the United States.\n\nThe Protege is classified as a compact sedan, but Mazda says it features interior volume equal to the much- larger Infiniti Q45. The company also includes a host of items normally found in more expensive midsized vehicles.\n\nMazda tends to identify its Protege with its luxury Mazda Millenia. It doesn’t attempt to make comparisons to the Millenia’s larger specifications, but to a design philosophy that produces quality, engineered innovation and styling distinctiveness.\n\n“This definitely is a sleeper in the automobile industry,” said Ron Vanags, general sales manager for Speedway Volkswagen-Mazda. “All you have to do is look at it to see that you get more bang for the buck.”\n\nThe engineering in the three models offered — DX, LX and ES — is state of the art.\n\nThe cars are fairy light, ranging from 2,385 pounds for a DX with a manual five-speed to 2,617 pounds for an upscale ES with an automatic transmission. The engines also are fairly small.\n\nTwo powerplants are offered. One is a 1.5- liter (91-cubic-inch) four-cylinder available in DX and LX sedans. A larger 1.8-liter (112-cubic-inch) engine powers the ES.\n\nWhile these engines don’t exactly fall in the muscle-car category, power output is enhanced by dual overhead cams and four valves per cylinder in both motors.\n\nFor reasons known mainly to Mazda, the 1.8 isn’t available in a DX or LX, and that’s unfortunate. The lightest DX with the 1.8’s 122 horsepower hooked to a manual five-speed would be an interesting set of wheels, especially since this motor is in Mazda’s Miata sports car.\n\nA key element for the Protege is a process called OptiSpace Design, which goes a step further than the highly touted cabin-forward design. It encompasses all aspects of styling, interior spaciousness, packaging, engine compartment, vehicle safety and the functionality of space within the vehicle.\n\nQThe styling obviously is aerodynamically driven, with a low, sloping nose, steeply raked windshield, arching roof line and short rear deck.\n\nThe extended, curved roof line serves a number of purposes. It adds front and rear seat headroom, gives rear passengers more room and improves the aerodynamics of the sedan.\n\nThe Protege’s interior designers had their computers in high gear in creating maximum room and safety. In addition to dual air bags, interior trim pieces were designed to be concave wherever possible.\n\nAs an example, the concave inside panels of the doors add to the interior width. An instrument panel that features a clean design for easy functionality has been sculpted for forward spaciousness. And the cowl point has been moved forward to add more room to the front of the cabin.\n\nOne of the more concerted efforts on the part of all automobile manufacturers to day is to make the body stiffer. Via extensive computer modeling and simulations, Mazda has created a body that for its weight has the highest bending and torsional rigidity of any vehicle in its class.\n\nThe 1995 Protege’s body is 1.9 times more rigid in bending than its predecessor, and is 1.5 times more rigid in torsion.\n\nThis presents a solid platform for an improved suspension system with the rear modified for better road holding and comfort. The rear lateral links of the suspension have been extended almost to the center line of the car, and the rear stabilizer bar now is mounted with ball joints rather than the previous rubber bushings.\n\nCoupled with a speed-sensitive power-steering unit, the front-drive four-door with its moderately short wheelbase takes on the handling attributes of a sports car.\n\nThe demographics of Protege buyers indicate a rather wide age spread of between20 and 45.\n\n“We’re finding about 50 percent of our buyers are female,” Vanags said. “The y are educ ated professional types who are drawn to the features of the car. It has the look and feel of a much larger automobile.”\n\nMazda has a base price spread of $11,995 for a DX with a five-speed to $16,145 for the ES with a manual transmission. A four-speed automatic adds $800.\n\n“The LX is the most popular seller,” Vanags said, “with the choice of manual or automatic split just about 50/50.”\n\n1995 Mazda Protege DX Base price: $11,995Type: Front-engine, front-drive, five-passenger compact sedanEngine: 1.5 liters, DOHC in-line 4, 16 valves, fuel-injected, 92horsepower, 96 foot-pounds of torqueTransmission: Five-speed manualWidth: 67.3 pounds.Wheelbase: 102.6 inchesLength: 174.8 inchesOptions: Air conditioning, AM/FM ETR stereo with cassette, discplayer, automatic transmission, keyless entry, alarm system, alloywheels, trim rings, wheel locks, rear deck spoiler, engine blockheater, floor mats.",

      "expert_review": "I love cars like the new Mazda Protege ES. You look at it and see what appears to be just another small, mild-mannered imported sedan aimed at budget-minded families.\n\nBut Protege ES is more than that.\n\nOur test car was a little road rocket, packing much more muscle and a sportier suspension system than you might expect.\n\nMazda may have pruned many of the sporty, unprofitable cars from its lineup in recent years — the RX-7, the MX-3 and MX-6 — but the spirit of those cars is alive and well in the Protege.\n\nPerformance, handling\n\nMazda offers the Protege in three models. The DX and LX versions come with a 105-horsepower, 1.6-liter, double overhead cam four-cylinder. The ES model — our test car — comes with a 1.8-liter four-cylinder that sports 122 horsepower. Maybe the secret is in the gearing, but I don’t remember driving a car with fewer than 125 ponies under the hood that has as much spunk as the Protege ES.\n\nThe engine has a hearty, BMW-like feel. It pulls strongly at all speeds, and if you rev it high enough and shift the five-speed transmission just right, you can leave a respectable patch of rubber on the pavement. Not bad for an economy car.\n\nAlthough the Protege is available with a four-speed automatic transmission, the stick shift makes this car fun to drive. The clutch is light and easy, and the shifter notches snugly into each gear.\n\nProtege comes with a four-wheel independent suspension system. The ride is firm and sporty, not soft and cushy like a Honda Civic or Toyota Corolla. The Protege loves to be driven hard around corners. The power-assisted, rack-and-pinion steering system has a nice, weighty feel, but it responds quickly. I like the thick rim of the steering wheel. It feels good in your hands.\n\nThe standard power-assisted front disc/rear drum brakes are another of the Protege’s strong points. The pedal has a solid feel, and the brakes grab quickly and stop the car efficiently under duress. Refined, balanced and superbly engineered, the Protege ES is a cut above most small economy cars.\n\nFit and finish\n\nOn t he surface, it looks as if the Protege’s cosmetic touches are just as impressive as its mechanical ones.\n\nBut the dash is made of hard plastic. It’s not softly padded, like you’d find in a Honda Civic. Protege’s dash, which has inserts around the radio with a golfball-like texture, looks nice but feels cheap to the touch. Too bad. Because a classier dash and more padding in the seats would be enough to make the Protege ES a strong contender for best-in-class honors.\n\nNot that the inside of the Protege is shabby. I like the general shape and style of the dash and interior. It conveys a sporty appearance, and it’s user-friendly. But nicer materials would have elevated the inside to the next level.\n\nBe that as it may, I can tell you that you’ll feel at ease right away inside the Protege. For a compact car, it offers excellent room front and rear headroom, so even 6-footers will be able to sit comfortably.\n\nOur test car came with just one option, an $80 set of floor mats. Everything else is standard on the ES model, which makes the car a solid bargain. The list includes: air conditioning, power windows, mirrors, remote control door locks, cruise control, tilt steering wheel and an AM/FM/CD player. That’s a lot of stuff for a car that is way under $16,000.\n\nThe Protege’s rear seats fold forward and fold flat, so the car can carry extra long objects, such as skis, with the trunk lid closed.\n\nThe bright red test car had two minor flaws. The engine sometimes didn’t start right away, possibly because of a fault in the fuel injection system, and the upper half of the driver’s seat was uncomfortable. But the car was assembled well and everything else worked perfectly during the 275-mile test drive.\n\nThe Protege ES exceeded my expectations. It’s a great little car that will never leave you wondering if you could’ve bought smarter. Protege gives you your money’s worth, maybe more.\n\n1999 Mazda Protege ES\n\nBase price: $14,925. Safety: Dual air bags and side-impact protection. Price as tested: $15,455. EPA rating: 26 mpg city/30 mpg highway. Incentives: None.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nSide-impact airbags are a new option for the LX and ES versions of the Protegé, Mazda’s front-drive compact sedan. The new side-impact airbags are part of option packages that include anti-lock brakes. Protegé was redesigned last year, but it has a short future in its present form. Ford owns a controlling interest in Mazda, and plans are to switch the Protegé to the Ford Focus platform for 2002. However, Mazda’s rendition is expected to look much different than Ford’s.\n\nInterior\nThe five-passenger Protegé is one of the roomier small cars, with interior volume of 92.6 cubic feet. That translates into adequate rear legroom and headroom for adult-size passengers. A split, folding rear seat supplements the 12.9-cubic-foot trunk, giving Protegé commendable cargo space for a small sedan.\n\nExterior\nAt 174 inches end to end, Protegé is one inch shorter than the best-selling small car, the Honda Civic. Mazda says the “European-inspired styling” was done jointly by designers in Europe, Japan and California.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe DX and LX models use a 105-horsepower, 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine. The top-line ES has a 1.8-liter engine with 122 horsepower. Manual and automatic transmissions are available with both.\n\nPerformance\nIt is easy to lose sight of the Protegé in the herd of small sedans. A closer look reveals a roomy car that is well equipped, competent, fun to drive and competitively priced.\n\n \n\nReported by Rick Popely  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2000 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "It has been said that “Good things come in small packages.” Whoever coined that phrase could well have been thinking of the 1997 Mazda Protege.\n\nAs an award-winning compact sport sedan with previous models, the ’97 Protege advances with new styling and a revised interior designed to be even more user friendly than in the past.\n\nAs Mazda’s zippy little four-door, the Protege combines high-tech power with front-wheel drive and excellent handling to put a fresh face on small-car motoring.\n\nGenerally, the bane of compacts has been a lack of interior room, but interior spaciousness has long been the hallmark of the Protege line.\n\nThe term used to describe the interior of the Protege is “OptiSpace,” a word coined by Mazda designers who created a vehicle with driving and riding comfort in mind.\n\nWith 95.5 cubic feet of interior room, Mazda says that its sedan is he roomiest vehicle in its class. The Protege also offers one of the largest trunks in its class, an impressive 13.1 cubic feet.\n\nThese specifications translate into 42.2 inches of front-seat leg room, the equivalent of some mid-sized cars. The 35.6 inches of leg room in the rear obviously is more restrictive, but is the equivalent of sedans standing on a 102.6-inch wheelbase.\n\nWith the exception of trim differences, styling for the entry level DX, midstream LX, and upscale ES models is basically the same. The primary new styling is at the front, with revised front bumpers, fenders, grille and headlights being featured.\n\n“It looks a lot more like a (Mazda) 626 than it previously did,” said Ron Vanags, general manager of Speedway Mazda. “It offers just about everything people want in a compact car.”\n\nOn balance, it’s a smooth-looking little sedan that came out well without sacrificing interior room. The Protege’s stylists have done a lot with 174.8 inches of overall length.\n\nDesigners doted on driver convenience for the interior, with better located controls. Cockpit layout is basic for a five-passenger sedan, with a console dividing the two front seats.\n\nA new instrument panel includes an 8,000-rpm tachometer that is standard on the LX and ES models. It’s not available in the DX, which probably is just as well because anyone contemplating turning these Protege engines 8,000 is as brave as they come.\n\nMazda is another one of those manufacturers who offers two different types of motors to fit particular models. Offered is a Type Z5D motor that is a 1.5-liter (90.8- cubic inch) double-overhead cam 16 valve four-cylinder powerplant. The second engine is a BPD 1.8-liter DOHC 16-valve 4.\n\nBoth these four-bangers are high tech in that they feature four valves per cylinders and multipoint electronic fuel injection. An interesting facet is that they both have mechanical lifters for the valves, a system that is more accommodating to tachometer redline limits.\n\nHydraulic lifters can pump up at extreme engine speeds and let the valves float. They are, however, self-adjusting; mechanicals are n ot.\n\nThe Z5D engine is shared by the DX and LX sedans, while the larger BPD motor is the exclusive province of the ES model.\n\nBoth these engines are technical illustrations of the power advantage gained by flowing more air and fuel through four valves per cylinder rather than two valves. The 90.8-cubic-inch Z5D motor is rated at 92-horsepower, just a tick above the performance benchmark of 1-horsepower per cubic inch.\n\nThe BPD 1.8 is more impressive, as 122-horsepower is extracted from 112.2 cubic inches of displacement. Also this motor appears to be able to stand a little higher engine speed, as it is redlined at 7,000 rpm versus 6,500 for the 1.5- liter.\n\nThe standard powertrain is a five-speed manual transmission. A four-speed automatic is optional at $800 across the line.\n\nCustomer choice of transmissions is split about 50/50, according to Vanags.\n\n“The five-speeds seem to be p referred by a bit more sportier type of driver,” he said.\n\nThe ’97 Protege’s suspension remains it s proven MacPherson strut layout with a stabilizer bar in front and Mazda’s Twin Trapezoidal Link design in the rear. The ES model adds a rear stabilizer bar for flatter cornering.\n\nThe Protege’s price structure provides the basis for economical motoring, as the base on a DX is $12,145. An LX, which is the most popular selling model, comes in at $13,545, and the ES at $15,295.",

      "expert_review": "You don’t need a week in the new Mazda Protege MP3 to draw some decent conclusions. A day will do. Make that an hour. No, a minute. Depending on your point of view – and likely your age – about 60 ticks in the cross hairs of the MP3’s fury will give you all the ammo to know this midsize, unassuming, sporty sedan is really Axl Rose in disguise.\n\nWelcome to the jungle and goodbye acute hearing. Gone in 60 seconds, guaranteed.\n\nNew for 2001, in what Mazda calls its Performance Series lineup, the Protege is a decent ride with a stadium-sized radio that can handle anything you throw its way – either Memorex or MP3 digital audio burned in your best friend’s basement. Hence, the name of the car, and a sizable understanding why it’s $2,000 more than a Plain-Jane Protege ES. But to say it’s just a stereo is to say sled dogs generally prefer red meat.\n\nAs one auto critic noted, the MP3 isn’t really a vehicle. It’s a gasoline-powered radio. It’s notch 10 on your home system. It’s Gilbert Godfried with a bullhorn. It’s 20 teen-agers in a 5-by-9 cell with ‘N Sync. And, overall, it’s not a bad car.\n\nSure, the MP3’s 280-watt Kenwood Excelon Z919 head unit is a disco ball of flashy electronics and fancy buttons all hooked to a thub, thub, thub of a subwoofer better suited for Rage Against the Machine than Ray Charles. But it’s a radio.\n\nThe MP3’s real charm is in its firmer springs, stiffer control-arm bushings and an upgraded engine that keeps it fun even when your only musical selection is tires on pavement. Not that that’s all Mazda thinks is fun. They’d like you to believe, in this case, a good car starts with a great set of tunes, ergo: the MP3.\n\nAlthough you’d have reason to believe Mazda brought in a set of 16-year-olds to tweak its Protege, the MP3 idea actually came out of a meeting with straight-as-plaid sales managers. The sales folks at Mazda thought it would be a good idea to build a niche vehicle, something appealing to either the teen-age son in the family or the father who hadn’t yet lost his hearing, but wanted to.\n\nTopped out and loaded at $18,530, it might be hard to get either away from it.\n\nModified from an original auto manufacturer’s show car (called the MPS), Mazda took its traditional Protege, spruced up the exterior like a tricked-out street racer, added fatter, 17-inch wheels, a spoiler and (did we mention?) the radio.\n\nBut first, the car.\n\nThe Protege has always been a critic’s friend. It clobbers the compact sedans and valiantly spars with the bigger boys, and for good reason: It’s fun. Fortunately, when the designers tweaked the sound system they also bolstered a few other parts.\n\nWith revised steering this year, the MP3’s roadability is still topshelf, and maybe slightly above the other Protege’s we’ve driven. With 17-inch wheels tied to a leatherwrapped three-spoke steering wheel, it is truly form and function melding into one. Handling is responsive and the 2- liter twin-cam four-cylinder gets a boost of 10 horsepower (140 total) and seven pound-feet of torque over previous models. Not great power, but decent given the vehicle’s weight.\n\nAnd because what’s around the engine is tuned so tight and lightweight – supportive bucket seats, a shifter with a short throw and an engine that wants to rev – the MP3 maneuvers and grips the road, eating up challenges. Tight corners? Not much swing and sway. Tight traffic? Zip in and away.\n\nWhat helps out are the upgrades that come courtesy of Racing Beat in Anaheim, Calif., a company that loves to turn Honda Civics into Honda Un-civils, with aftermarket ad-ons. In the MP3 that means Tokico shocks and a tight ride that will have you bouncing to the music, even if you don’t want to.\n\nOutside, they’ve lowered the Protege about an inch and added two spoilers, side skirts and rounded headlamps that make it seem more attacking in its stance. Inside, the details don’t go unnoticed.\n\nMP3’s brushed silver highlights are all over a very sporty cabin that will sit well with the driver or any of the three or four (in a pinch) other passengers. The splitfold rear seatbacks open to a largeenough 12.9 cubic foot trunk, but rear leg room is tight in the back, especially when you load down the kids or luggage. And, speaking of kids….\n\nThe real highlight is in what you hear. With a flick of a switch, the disco ball drops and Mazda’s newest creation is released. Smack dab in the middle of a colorful, and color-coded interior, is the heart of the MP3. But it’s the ears and brain that will do most of the work.\n\nIf the KABOOM! sound of the four-channel system doesn’t throw you, figuring out the stereo just might. Mazda throws in a handy little scorecard to help you figure out the tough things – like, how to turn it on – but it’s the easy things that seem impossible. Volume? Over on the left, but not clearly marked. Change the station? Better bring your microscope. Everything on the MP3’s stereo is MP-small.\n\nThe flashy graphics are interesting but the controls are so tiny that changing from AM to FM was like conducting neuro-surgery. And don’t try adjusting things during the day. In the glare of the sun, the graphics and type are washed away like the sound of your voice on Level 15 volume.\n\nThe key with the MP3 is obviously…. MP3s. In this model, the Protege offers the industry’s first production MP3-capable stereo, meaning it can play compressed music downloaded off the Internet.\n\nThe sound itself, when at a normal level, is downright amazing. With each of the four door-mounted speakers churning out 45 watts, then adding the 10-inch cochlea-compressing 100-watt subwoofer, it was like a cheap night at the Philharmonic.\n\nAnd speaking of cheap…. Priced at under $19,000, the MP3 competes well with the Honda Civics and Nissan Sentras of the small-car world. It even gets 25 mpg in the city.\n\nFor the value, performance, fun and tunes, it’s not a badly-priced package. Does it need all those watts? No. Will it sell? You bet. Will you be able to hear after your 17-year-old son has spun you around in one?\n\nI’ll give you 60 seconds to decide.\n\nVehicle type: Front-wheel-drive, front engine, four-door, five-passenger compact sedan.\n\nStandard equipment: Five-speed manual transmission; dual front air bags; emergency inside trunk release; variable-assist power steering; tilt steering; cloth upholstery; split/fold rear seats; Kenwood AM/FM/CD/MP3 stereo; sport suspension; cruise control; head-adjustable driver’s seat; power mirrors, windows, locks; air-conditioning; remote keyless entry; theft-deterrent system; fog lights.\n\nCompetition: Ford Focus Street, Honda Civic EX, Hyundai Sonata, Chevrolet Cavalier\n\nEngine: 140 horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder\n\nTorque: 142 foot-lbs. @ 4,500 rpm\n\nWheelbase: 102.8 inches\n\nLength: 174.6 inches\n\nMPG rating: 25 mpg city/31 mpg highway\n\nManufactured: Japan\n\nWarranty: Basic warranty is three years/50,000 miles; the drive train is three years/50,000 miles; body corrosion is five years/unlimited miles and roadside assistance is three years/50,000 miles.\n\nBase price (MP3): $18,020\n\nPrice as tested (including options, destination and delivery): $18,530",
