      "expert_review": "The verdict: Like other Mazda CX-50s, the hybrid version is a sharp-handling, good-looking compact SUV — but the new hybrid powertrain thoroughly ruins the fun in favor of efficiency.\n\nVersus the competition: The CX-50 Hybrid handles better than a Toyota RAV4 Hybrid or Honda CR-V hybrid, but it isn’t as spacious or comfortable, and it isn’t current with the latest multimedia trends.\n\nThe Mazda CX-50 exists in a strange spot in the Mazda showroom. It’s a sportier, less useful sibling to the similarly sized CX-5 compact SUV, with Mazda’s signature excellent handling qualities, a firmed-up ride and a lower stance that’s meant to make it the fun one of the pair. We last tested one in a multicar comparison test in 2023, where the turbocharged version we had was praised as the sports car of the group, and for good reason. The CX-50 was a blast to drive, with a snappy, powerful engine and transmission combo that combined with amazing steering feedback and handling precision. But for some reason, Mazda decided that the CX-50 needed a hybrid version, so it got in touch with Toyota, a part owner of Mazda, and dropped the powertrain from the RAV4 Hybrid under the far-better-looking hood of the CX-50 — and promptly ruined it.\n\nRelated: What’s the Best Compact SUV of 2023?\n\nConfused Personality\n\nInstead of the optional 256-horsepower, turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine and six-speed automatic transmission that was in the CX-50 in our comparison test, the CX-50 Hybrid has a naturally aspirated 2.5-liter four-cylinder paired with two electric motors and a continuously variable automatic transmission. This Toyota hybrid system has been adapted for the Mazda platform, and it makes 219 hp total, less than the turbo engine’s output but more than the 187 hp of the CX-50’s standard four-cylinder engine. In the process, Mazda has taken what was probably the sportiest, most entertaining to drive compact SUV on the market and knifed it in the gut.\n\nThe CX-50 Hybrid still handles like its Mazda-engined siblings, and that’s a very good thing — steering feel is excellent, feedback is top-notch, and body control is fantastic. It’s the Miata of small SUVs, tossable and rewarding to drive on twisty roads. There’s even standard “e-AWD,” meaning that one motor is placed on the rear axle and drives the back wheels for what’s called “through the road all-wheel drive.” The CX-50’s sporty nature can be a bit much when you’re just cruising around town or doing soccer carpool or commuting, as the stiffer suspension and optional 19-inch wheels and tires on my test vehicle make for choppy and unpleasant ride quality, a trait we also observed with the CX-50 2.5 Turbo Premium Plus. But if sporty driving feel and engagement are really your preference but family duty is your reality, the handling offered by the CX-50 Hybrid is likely to please.\n\nIt’s the powertrain that lets you down if you’re looking for anything other than eking out the best gas mileage possible. It transitions between electric and gasoline power as smoothly as any Toyota system, but sporty it is not — even when you put the it into Sport mode. The CVT is part of the problem, as there really isn’t a CVT on the planet that can be called sporty or entertaining. Mid-range power is fine, providing decently peppy acceleration when you’re just bopping around town, but foot-to-the-floor power for merging onto a highway or trying to enjoy the CX-50’s handling prowess on some twisty roads shows you that this powertrain isn’t ready to dance with you. It feels out of place and awkward in this vehicle, providing more noise than thrust.\n\nBut its fuel efficiency is undeniable — Mazda says that the new CX-50 Hybrid will be EPA-rated at 39/37/38 mpg city/highway/combined, which is considerably better than the CX-50’s other two powertrains. The non-turbo four-cylinder CX-50 is rated 25/31/28 mpg, while the turbo comes in at 23/29/25 mpg. So getting anywhere from 10-13 mpg better in combined use driving is a real jump. It falls short of some competitors, however, such as the RAV4 Hybrid AWD, which is rated at 41/38/39 mpg, but it bests the Honda CR-V hybrid AWD, which is rated at 40/34/37 mpg. So from a driving standpoint, if you’re keen on getting gas mileage like you would in a Toyota or Honda hybrid but prefer the look and feel of a Mazda SUV, you’ll be getting the best of both worlds. If you’re hoping for the sporty performance of the other two non-hybrid CX-50 models but with hybrid-style fuel economy, well, you’re only going to get half of what you’re hoping for.\n\nNice Cabin — Except for the Tech\n\nSlide into the CX-50’s cockpit, and you’re rewarded with the latest in Mazda premium niceness. The automaker has made a hard push to be considered a premium brand with competitive prices, and the CX-50 is no exception. The designs are attractive, materials feel rich and expensive, and build quality is exceptional. Comfort is excellent, too, in the front row — the backseat feels a little tight. Visibility out is also a bit compromised due to the CX-50’s overall design; it has a swoopy roofline and small rear window, so it’s not the easiest to see out of, but such is the price you pay for style that’s honestly more like a wagon than an upright SUV like the CX-5 or most other competitors. Controls feel excellent; there are dedicated physical controls and hard buttons for most things as opposed to touchscreen stuff like in many newer competitors.\n\nBut that’s apparently because Mazda doesn’t want you touching the CX-50’s screen. Like, ever. At all. Despite a couple of decades worth of touchscreen control system experience and all the consumer-focused study of their use, Mazda still locks out the touchscreen for most things while you’re driving. This means you’re forced to use the silly selector knob on the center console when performing even simple operations instead of just touching what you want on the screen. It has even moved the screen back and far away from the driver so that even if you could use most of it for touchscreen functions, it’s hard to actually reach. So like the original BMW iDrive from more than 20 years ago, you’re still scrolling through menus using a ridiculous rotary knob instead of just simply touching what you want. It’s archaic and anachronistic, and I have no real idea why Mazda sticks with this awful system when nearly every single other infotainment system on the market is better — even the new Volkswagen systems (yes, I went there).\n\nIf you can tolerate the archaic tech, then the CX-50’s cabin is a rather nice place to spend some time. It’s even available with some nice colors and upholstery to add even more richness to the experience. And the cargo area is quite large; the addition of the Toyota hybrid system and the reconfiguration of the SUV’s fore and aft subframes hasn’t impacted cargo space, according to Mazda.\n\nPricing and Positioning\n\nThe new CX-50 Hybrid slots between the non-turbocharged CX-50 2.5 S models and the 2.5 Turbo models in price and position. It starts at $35,390 (all prices include a $1,420 destination fee) for the lowest Hybrid Preferred trim, rises to $38,820 for the Premium trim and tops out at $41,470 for the Premium Plus model with all the bells and whistles. That means its starting price is $3,670 more than the least expensive CX-50 2.5 S Select, but it also tops out near where the CX-50 2.5 Turbo Meridian trim starts.\n\nThe CX-50 Hybrid is less expensive than the cheapest ‘25 CR-V AWD Sport hybrid, which starts at $37,500, but it’s a couple grand more expensive than the cheapest ‘24 RAV4 Hybrid LE AWD, which starts at $33,120. You have to really be seeking the sporty ride and handling of the CX-50 Hybrid to choose it over its competitors, however, as it’s a compromised package in several other areas. But for those who are seeking that, the new Mazda with the Toyota heart will do fine.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2025 Mazda CX-50 Gets New Toyota-Powered Hybrid Variant\n2024 Mazda CX-50 Gets Ready for More All-Terrain Driving, Starts at $31,675\n2023 Mazda CX-50 Review: Looks Aren’t Everything\n2023 Mazda CX-50 Vs. 2022 Subaru Forester Wilderness: Who Off-Roads Better?\nShop for a 2025 Mazda CX-50\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
