      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Mazda CX-50?\n\nThe Mazda CX-50 is a five-seat compact SUV with sleek styling and the spry driving manners of a high-riding sports sedan. The base powertrain is a 187-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder that’s coupled to a six-speed automatic transmission and standard all-wheel drive. A zesty turbocharged version of the same four-cylinder produces 227 or 256 hp, depending on whether it’s running on regular- or premium-grade gas, and a 219-hp hybrid powertrain is also available. The CX-50’s competitors include the Ford Escape, Honda CR-V, Hyundai Tucson, Subaru Forester and Toyota RAV4.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Mazda CX-50?\n\nThe CX-50 gets a new hybrid powertrain option this year, borrowed from one of its primary competitors: the Toyota RAV4 Hybrid. It uses a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine, with two electric motors to drive the front wheels and a third electric motor on the rear axle to provide AWD. The CX-50 Hybrid earns an EPA-estimated 38 mpg combined, compared with 28 mpg for the naturally aspirated engine and 25 mpg for the turbocharged four-cylinder. Mazda also upgraded the CX-50’s forward collision warning system this year to better detect pedestrians at night, and a larger 10.25-inch touchscreen now comes standard.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Mazda CX-50 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n10.25-inch infotainment display\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nFour USB-C ports (two front and two rear)\nWi-Fi hot spot\nEight-speaker audio system\nKeyless entry\nDual-zone climate control\nForward collision warning with pedestrian detection\nAdaptive cruise control\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nRear cross-traffic alert\nBlind spot warning\nLane departure steering assist \n\nAvailable features include:\n\nWireless device charging\nSynthetic leather upholstery\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nHeated rear seats\n12-speaker Bose audio system\nPower liftgate\nPanoramic moonroof\nSurround-view parking camera system\nAll-terrain tires\nShould I Buy the 2025 Mazda CX-50?\n\nThere’s no shortage of competition in the compact SUV market, but the CX-50 impresses with its fun-to-drive nature, standard AWD, a long roster of safety features and a classy interior that wouldn’t look out of place if there were a luxury badge on the front grille. Granted, climbing to the CX-50’s highest trims brings a near-luxury price along for the ride. Mazda pitches the CX-50 as an adventure-ready SUV with better-than-average off-road capabilities, but we like it better as an athletic on-road SUV. If you’re most interested in off-the-beaten-path excursions, rivals like the Ford Bronco Sport, Subaru Forester and off-road trims of the Toyota RAV4 are better choices.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Mazda CX-50?\n\nThe Mazda CX-50 is a five-seat compact SUV with sleek styling and the spry driving manners of a high-riding sports sedan. The base powertrain is a 187-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder that’s coupled to a six-speed automatic transmission and standard all-wheel drive. Optional is a zesty turbocharged version of the same four-cylinder that produces 227 or 256 hp, depending on whether it’s running on regular- or premium-grade gas. The CX-50’s competitors include the Ford Escape, Honda CR-V, Hyundai Tucson, Subaru Forester and Toyota RAV4.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Mazda CX-50?\n\nThe CX-50 debuted as a 2023 model, and Mazda has left it largely unchanged for 2024. Wireless phone charging is standard on more trims, and the steering and suspension have been retuned.  \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Mazda CX-50 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\n8.8-inch infotainment display\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nTwo USB ports\nWi-Fi hot spot\nEight-speaker audio system\nKeyless entry\nAutomatic climate control\nForward collision warning with pedestrian detection\nAdaptive cruise control\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nRear cross-traffic alert\nBlind spot warning\nLane departure steering assist \n\nAvailable features include: \n\n10.25-inch infotainment display\nWireless device charging\nSynthetic leather upholstery\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nHeated rear seats\nDual-zone climate control\nPower liftgate\nPanoramic moonroof\nSurround-view parking camera system\nAll-terrain tires\nShould I Buy the 2024 Mazda CX-50?\nThere’s no shortage of competition in the compact SUV market, but the CX-50 impresses with its fun-to-drive nature, standard all-wheel drive, long roster of safety features and a classy interior that wouldn’t look out of place if there were a luxury badge on the front grille. Granted, climbing to the CX-50’s highest trims means a near-luxury price comes along for the ride. Mazda pitches the CX-50 as an adventure-ready SUV with better-than-average off-road capabilities, but we like it better as an athletic on-road SUV. If you’re most interested in off-the-beaten-path excursions, rivals like the Ford Bronco Sport, Subaru Forester and off-road trims of the Toyota RAV4 are better choices.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The all-new Mazda CX-50 is a competent — if uninspiring — compact SUV that does most things well, but it doesn’t do much to push Mazda’s lineup in a new direction.\n\nVersus the competition: Given how closely matched the compact SUVs in our latest comparison test were, it would be nice if the CX-50 did more to differentiate itself from its competition — or even its CX-5 stablemate.\n\nWhen Mazda unveiled the 2023 CX-50 in November 2021, it was clearly jumping aboard the off-road-vehicle bandwagon that became increasingly prevalent in the market as the COVID-19 pandemic dragged on and people sought any excuse to get out of the house. Off-road vehicles and trims are apparently the new blacked-out appearance packages.\n\nRelated: 2023 Mazda CX-50 Vs. 2022 Subaru Forester Wilderness: Who Off-Roads Better?\n\nThe CX-50 has standard all-wheel drive, a six-speed automatic transmission and a choice of two 2.5-liter four-cylinder engines: a naturally aspirated version with 187 horsepower and 186 pounds-feet of torque or a turbocharged version making either 256 or 227 hp and 320 or 310 pounds-feet of torque depending on whether or not it’s running on premium gas.\n\nWe drove a range-topping Premium Plus CX-50 with the 2.5-liter turbo both off- and on-road to see if it could stand out in its extremely crowded and competitive segment. Unfortunately, the CX-50 doesn’t really stand out even in Mazda’s own lineup, where it’s in direct competition with the CX-5 (for now, anyway).\n\nDriving the CX-50\n\nDespite using a different platform, the CX-50 drives a lot like its CX-5 sibling. One thing usually present in Mazda vehicles is communicative steering, and that’s still the case in the CX-50. Unfortunately, it lacks other on-road capabilities that could take full advantage of that: The ride is brittle, and impacts were harsh with the 20-inch wheels that come standard with the 2.5 turbo engine. Aggressive cornering produces body roll and some understeer, though not any more than you’ll find in pretty much any SUV in this segment. Most competitors, however, also have steering that feels much more numb.\n\nFor more detailed off-road impressions, you can read my extended thoughts here. Without driving a CX-50 equipped with the Meridian treatment, which includes more serious all-terrain tires, it’s hard to gauge just how capable the CX-50 could be. We can speak to its performance with street tires and 20-inch wheels, though, and with that setup, the CX-50 successfully navigated a light off-road course, but it never felt happy doing so. The CX-50 is meant to be the vehicle that gets you and your gear to the trailhead, not one that goes down the trail, but in most of those instances, you’d be just as successful getting there in a Camry. The CX-50 is not meant for serious or frequent off-roading, so if you’re looking for something like that, look elsewhere.\n\nIt’s possible the Meridian Edition, with its smaller wheels and beefier off-road tires, might feel both more capable off-road and cushier on pavement, but it’s probably not going to supplant some of the more capable soft-roaders in its segment, like the Ford Bronco Sport Badlands, the Subaru Forester Wilderness or any of the multiple Toyota RAV4 TRD models.\n\nThe CX-50’s fuel economy is decent, at least, and there’s not much of a penalty for getting the more powerful turbo engine. The naturally aspirated 2.5 is rated 24/30/27 mpg city/highway/combined, and switching to the turbocharged powerplant drops those ratings only slightly to 23/29/25 mpg. Of course, to get the most horsepower and torque out of the turbo 2.5-liter — 256 hp and 320 pounds-feet — Mazda recommends using premium gas. That’s of course more expensive than regular, and the 2.5 turbo doesn’t provide overwhelming power on it; it’s unlikely that owners will miss the extra 29 hp or 10 pounds-feet of torque if they opt for regular. The turbo engine provides adequate power when called upon, but it can sound strained and unrefined under heavier loads.\n\nThe CX-50 also adds two new drive modes: Off-Road and a turbo-exclusive Towing. Off-Road helps a bit when the going gets tough, but there’s no additional configurability beyond “Off-Road” to help with specific types of terrain. Towing mode is exclusive to turbo-powered CX-50s, which can tow 3,500 pounds versus the 2,000 pounds the non-turbo CX-50 can pull. The other driving mode worth mentioning is Sport, but that’s just to note that it doesn’t do much to change the character of the CX-50.\n\nComfortable, Frustrating Interior\n\nThe front and rear seats of the CX-50 don’t feel much roomier — or really much different at all — from a CX-5. The CX-50’s more aggressive roofline and Mazda’s first power-sliding panoramic moonroof cut into headroom a bit, but there’s not an uncomfortable seat in the car. The CX-50’s cargo area is also impressively roomy, if basic, with two small cubbies for smaller items. (They were, for instance, a great place to put some precious six-packs of Wisconsin-exclusive New Glarus beer when driving home to Illinois.) We measured the CX-50’s cargo volume at 18.13 cubic feet — nearly identical to the 2021 CX-5 we measured at 17.91.\n\nWhat’s problematic is Mazda’s infotainment system. The larger 10.25-inch display in our test vehicle (an 8.8-inch screen is standard) is technically a touchscreen, but it doesn’t function as such in most situations. Touch control only works when the vehicle is not in motion; when the car is driving, a knob controller is the only way to navigate the display and make selections. At least, that was the case before Mazda gave touchscreen functionality back when using Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. It’s a smart decision given how much easier it is to use a smartphone-mirroring interface like you use a smartphone. Both those interfaces work wirelessly, though I noticed some slight lagginess in wireless CarPlay when quickly cycling through songs.\n\nWhile bringing back touchscreen capability is nice, the screen itself is positioned so high and deep on the dashboard that even longer-armed drivers and front passengers may have trouble reaching it. I alternated between using the touchscreen and the frustrating knob depending on the situation and how comfortable I felt leaning forward.\n\nIf you’re not using Apple CarPlay or Android Auto, the rest of the user interface looks dated and can be confusing. It feels like Mazda is mimicking early iterations of BMW’s iDrive before the Bavarians worked out all the kinks.\n\nSome of the CX-50’s competitors have their own quirks and foibles when it comes to this stuff, but for an all-new vehicle like the CX-50 to have the same old tech that’s frustrated us in other Mazdas is disappointing.\n\nMazda aims to be seen as a more premium automaker than, say, Toyota or Honda, and the CX-50 is trying to live up to that goal. Its interior materials are a step above competitors’, and build quality is top-notch. Physical controls have a solid feel, and an available head-up display is a premium touch. Compared with an Acura RDX, the CX-50 may not come out ahead, but compared with a Honda CR-V or Toyota RAV4, it is likely to impress.\n\nSafety\n\nThe CX-50 has a number of standard active safety features, including Mazda’s low-speed City Brake Support automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, as well as lane departure warning, lane keeping assist and blind spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert. I didn’t find these features overly intrusive or unhelpful during my time in the CX-50, which isn’t always the case. The optional head-up display was nice, if very basic in its functionality.\n\nAs of this writing, the CX-50 has not yet been evaluated by either the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. In our own Car Seat Check, the CX-50 earned mostly Bs and one A grade.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2023 Mazda CX-50?\n10 Mid-Size SUVs Ace New IIHS Crash Test, Popular Models Fall Short\nLexus, Mini Top J.D. Power Customer Service Index Study\n2023 Mazda CX-50: All-New SUV’s Pricing, Trims Revealed\n2023 Mazda CX-50: Another One Invites the Dust\n\nRelated Video:\n\nShould You Buy a CX-50?\n\nLooks are subjective, but to me the CX-50 distinguishes itself with its exterior styling. Compared with the CX-5 and the segment as a whole, the CX-50 is much more aggressive-looking, with boxy flared fenders and a large grille that give it a somewhat undeserved air of sportiness. But if appearance matters to you, the CX-50 is perhaps the handsomest of the bunch, and that alone may make it worth a purchase.\n\nPricing for the CX-50 starts at just under $29,000, but our loaded test vehicle rang in at over $43,000 — not a small chunk of change, and certainly in the more premium realm of compact SUVs. The Meridian Edition, the most off-road capable CX-50, is a $2,800 premium over a base turbo-equipped model, at $41,225 (including destination).\n\nMany compact SUVs ask buyers to make do with no bigger engine to opt for or to turn to hybrid powertrains for increased performance. In that regard, the CX-50 and its optional turbo engine are a pleasant alternative. With its upmarket features and interior appointments, the CX-50 is a strong choice in a crowded field. So, however, is the CX-5.\n\nThe CX-50 doesn’t do a lot of things wrong, but other than its looks, it also doesn’t stand out from its CX-5 sibling — and if you’re looking for an off-road-friendly vehicle, there are better choices.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
