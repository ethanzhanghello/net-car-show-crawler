      "expert_review": "Mazda likes to talk about sporty performance, pointing out the zoom-zoom attributes of its stylish roadster, the Miata, as well as its enhanced compact, Protege5, and even its minivan, MPV.\n\nWith Mazda6, the company takes its message mainstream.\n\nRedesigning its bread-and-butter midsize sedan, the former and largely forgotten 626, into a sharply maneuverable sports sedan, Mazda takes on the family-sedan heavyweights, Honda Accord and Toyota Camry, as well as such popular sporty sedans as Nissan Altima and Volkswagen Passat.\n\nThe engineers did their homework on this one, providing Mazda6 with top-notch handling, steering and braking.\n\nSince Mazda recently announced that it was discontinuing its luxury model, the Millenia, 6 becomes the flagship. There are two versions: the four-cylinder Mazda6 i and the V-6 Mazda6 s.\n\nThe name 6 seems a bit awkward, though. It reminds me of the old Seinfeld joke when George wanted his pregnant friend to name her baby Seven.\n\nWhatever, Mazda’s parent company, Ford, thinks enough of the 6’s platform that it is planning to build 10 new Fords, Mercurys and Lincolns during the next three years based on the Mazda6 underpinnings.\n\nWhat it is\n\nMazda’s latest entry in the midsize-car market, Mazda6 is a major advance over the previous sedan, the 626, and emphasizes sporty driving characteristics. By the numbers: the 6 is a four-door sedan with seating for five. The rear seat is fairly tight, and if three people squeeze back there, they had better be small.\n\nEngine and transmission\n\nTwo engines are available for Mazda6, a 2.3-liter inline four with 160 horsepower that’s reportedly strong and lively, and a 3-liter V-6 that delivers 220 horsepower. The V-6 in the test car, equipped with a five-speed stickshift, provided plenty of pull.\n\nThe V-6 is admirably smooth and flexible, thanks in part to continuously variable intake valve timing. Still, the 6 is a bit slow off the line while gathering power as engine speed builds.\n\nThe 6 performed well during a day trip up north, including one of my favorite roads, the uphill run on Arizona 260 from Interstate 17 to Arizona 87, just north of Strawberry.\n\nThe V-6 emits a harsh roar under acceleration. After all that talk about tuning the exhaust on the Miata to generate the right sort of sports-car tone, something could have been done to mellow out the sound of Mazda6’s exhaust.\n\nThe five-speed was well calibrated to keep the engine on the mark, though the shifter left something to be desired. The linkage felt rubbery and notchy, not what one would expect from a car striving for sporty performance.\n\nHandling and drivability\n\nMy favorite aspect of the 6’s fine road manners is its responsive rack-and-pinion steering. Very quick and precise feeling, but never twitchy, the steering is balanced and firm. Maybe too firm for some drivers, th ough this is how I like it.\n\nThe four-wheel disc brakes, which include standard antilock on the V-6 version and optional with the four, are potent and easy to modulate at all speeds.\n\nOverall, handling is sharp and poised, a truly sporting take on the family sedan. Accord and Camry may be roomier and more accommodating, but 6 takes to the road as neither of them can, even in their latest versions. Cornering is flat and controlled, with that lovely steering providing sharp agility.\n\nStyling\n\nMazda6 looks low and fast and managed to pique the interest of young drivers. Though not as distinctive as Altima or Cadillac CTS, Mazda6 manages to walk the line between family transport and all-out sports sedan.\n\nThe sport package on the test car is largely cosmetic, with lower-body extensions, dual chrome exhaust tips, rear apron and spoiler, 17-inch alloy wheels with low-profile tires and interior embellishments. Fog lamps are integrated into the headlight cluster.\n\nInterior\n\nThis is a mixed bag of sharply modern forms and some chintzy execution. The styling includes the latest trend of hard-plastic forms that look like brushed aluminum, which looks either strikingly modern or starkly fake, depending on your point of view.\n\nGauges and switches are nicely arranged, with unusual rotary dials in the center binnacle for climate control and audio functions. The dials, and the digital display that appears on the upper dashboard, took some getting used to.\n\nThe black-plastic air-conditioning vents felt cheap and flimsy, as did the cover of the stowage bin on the dashboard top.\n\nThe back seat is cramped for all but the smallest passengers.\n\nThe test car had the optional 200-watt Bose audio package with six speakers and a subwoofer. Sweet.\n\nPricing\n\nThe base-model Mazda6 starts at about $18,500. The base pricing on the test car was $21,100, plus leather seating, $860; the sport package, $860; power moonroof, $700; Bose audio package, $635; side air bags and air curtains, $450; heated seats and mirrors, $220 and shipping, $520. Total was a still reasonable $25,345.\n\nBottom line\n\nMazda6 provides a sporty alternative to Accord and Camry and should satisfy even the most critical drivers.\n\nMazda6 s\n\nVehicle type: Five-passenger, four-door sedan, front-wheel drive.\n\nBase price: $21,100.\n\nPrice as tested: $25,345.\n\nEngine: 3-liter V-6, 220 horsepower at 6,300 rpm, 192 pound-feet of torque at 5,000 rpm.\n\nTransmission: Five-speed manual.\n\nWheelbase: 105.3 inches.\n\nCurb weight: 3,243 pounds.\n\nEPA mileage: 20 city, 27 highway.\n\nHighs:\n\nSporty agility.\n\nSteering, braking.\n\nEngine power.\n\nLows:\n\nFlimsy interior parts.\n\nCramped back seat.\n\nRubbery shifter.",

      "expert_review": "I’ve always liked the driver-focused nature and distinctive design of the Mazda6 midsize sedan, but its sales have languished far below the class leaders. For 2014, Mazda makes another charge at the segment heavyweights with an all-new version.\n\nBesides sharp styling and a sporty driving experience, the 2014 Mazda6 comes armed with something even more important that positions it to challenge the segment leaders: fuel economy that’s near the top of the class.\n\nAt an event held by the automaker in Austin, Texas, I tested both manual- and automatic-transmission versions of the 2014 Mazda6. The base Sport trim with a six-speed manual transmission starts at $21,675 (all Mazda6 prices cited include a $795 destination charge). The as-tested prices of the models I drove — a six-speed manual Sport and a top-level Grand Touring with a six-speed automatic — were $21,675 and $31,490, respectively. To see the Mazda6’s specs compared with the Ford Fusion, Honda Accord and Nissan Altima, click here.\n\nThe New Face of Mazda\nThe 2014 Mazda 6 adopts a shieldlike grille that’s tamer than some of the brand’s recent designs. It works to good effect, giving the sedan a certain pugnaciousness. For many brands, grille design has become a way to both distinguish models and maintain a family resemblance, and the new face of Mazda accomplishes that on the Mazda6 and other models like the CX-5 small crossover.\n\nSome of the Mazda6’s prior styling cues, like the bulging front fenders, have been retained, but one of the car’s prettiest aspects is its rear styling. Some cars’ tails don’t look like they’ve received much design attention. Not so with the Mazda6, which gets an intricate trunk lid, wraparound taillights with smoked lenses and a tidy chrome strip running the width of the car. It’s a design that wouldn’t be out of place on the back of a luxury sedan.\n\nRide & Handling\nThe Mazda6’s suspension tuning keeps with Mazda’s sporty focus. The result is a taut ride that reveals many details about the road — and whether it’s well-maintained or not. The car also exhibits admirable body control, with limited body roll during hard cornering. Beyond that, the Mazda6 feels like a smaller car than it truly is — in a good way — and this goes a long way toward establishing its nimbleness.\n\nThe biggest area for improvement, though, is the steering. While nicely weighted and responsive, the system fails to deliver the kind of feedback you get when driving the compact Mazda3 — a revelation compared with many other models in its class. The new Mazda 6 does get a smaller steering wheel and a quicker steering ratio, but the lack of road feel stands out in a sedan that’s otherwise engaging for the driver.\n\nSkyActiv Technology\nThe 2014 Mazda6 is the second Mazda model to get the full suite of technologies termed SkyActiv, which aim to reduce fuel consumption without compromising how the car drives. SkyActiv touches important vehicle systems such as the body structure, suspension, transmission and engine. Mazda says SkyActiv will also encompass alternative powertrains for future fuel-economy gains. One such powertrain — a clean-diesel engine — will be offered in the Mazda6 in the second half of 2013.\n\nWith its direct-injection 2.5-liter four-cylinder gas engine, the Mazda6’s performance is comparable to many four-cylinder family sedans. The engine doesn’t push you back in your seat, but it gets you up to speed reasonably well. The engine is refined all the way to its redline in terms of both vibration harshness and sound.\n\nWhat the Mazda 6 really needed — and got for 2014 — was better estimated gas mileage. The prior sedan’s estimates trailed most of its competitors, but the 2014 version is near the top of the pack with an EPA-rated 25/37 mpg city/highway for the six-speed manual transmission and 26/38 mpg for the six-speed automatic.\n\nApart from promising better mileage than the stick, the automatic transmission also makes the four-cylinder look good, providing low-speed smoothness and precise shifts at higher speeds. The automatic is responsive; it will kick down quickly if you mash the gas pedal.\n\nMore than the automatic, the manual transmission reveals the four-cylinder’s lack of low-rpm power. Acceleration is modest from a standing start, even when letting the engine rev to its limit before shifting gears. The four-cylinder feels less stressed when snaking along winding roads at a steady clip.\n\nThe manual shifter itself is exceptional. Its precision is rare among midsize sedans, and the light clutch pedal is well-suited to the car.\n\nCabin Design & Roominess\nThe cabin’s dominant design feature is the vertical-face dashboard. The control layout is simple, and it’s easy to understand the controls within a matter of minutes, which is far from a certainty today with the introduction of “advanced” technologies like Ford’s MyFord Touch interface. The Mazda6 has its share of available features, but they’re self-contained.\n\nMaterials quality is mostly good. There are lots of soft-touch surfaces, and the cabin’s metallic accents are a good imitation of real metal. The power window switches and the trim around them is of a lower grade than the rest of the cabin, but materials consistency is otherwise good.\n\nWhether you choose the standard cloth or optional leather upholstery, the front bucket seats are comfortable and have just enough bolstering to keep you situated when rounding a fast corner — but not so much that you feel confined during less aggressive driving. In moonroof-equipped cars, there’s little extra headroom when the driver’s seat is raised.\n\nThe backseat ranks among the more spacious ones in the segment, with room to spare for taller passengers like me (I’m 6 feet 1 inch); the seat cushion is high enough to provide some welcome thigh support.\n\nThe car comes with a standard 60/40-split folding backrest with release levers in the trunk. When folded, the backrest is nearly flat with the trunk floor, and the lack of a ledge between the two sections provides an uninterrupted surface. The trunk measures 14.8 cubic feet.\n\nFeatures\nTouring and Grand Touring trim levels bundle a range of features in option packages. For $2,000, Touring models can have a Technology Package that includes a Bose premium stereo, a navigation system, keyless entry, automatic headlights, rain-sensing windshield wipers, heated side mirrors and the Smart City Brake Support system. This infrared braking system works from about 2 to 18 mph and can prevent or reduce the severity of a low-speed rear-end crash.\n\nFor $900, Grand Touring models get radar-based adaptive cruise control and forward obstruction warning. Forward obstruction warning won’t apply the brakes if it senses an impending collision like Smart City Brake Support does, but it will warn the driver with an alert.\n\nBeginning in May 2013, Grand Touring trims will be available with the $2,080 Advanced Package, which adds to the adaptive cruise control and forward obstruction features a lane departure warning system, automatic high-beam headlights and Mazda’s i-ELOOP regenerative braking system. This system captures energy that would otherwise be lost during deceleration and uses it to power electrical components.\n\nSafety\nAs of publication, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration have not crash-tested the 2014 Mazda 6, though its status as a mainstream family sedan means it will likely be tested at some point by the agencies.\n\nStandard safety features include side-impact airbags for the front seats, side curtain airbags, antilock brakes and an electronic stability system. A blind spot warning system, rear cross-traffic alert and a backup camera are optional.\n\nFor a full list of safety features check out the Features & Specs page.\n\nMazda6 in the Market\nIn a market dominated by two nameplates — the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry — it’s not easy for something new to break in. Hyundai and Kia have had some success with the Sonata and Optima, respectively, but the Mazda6 hasn’t registered with family-sedan shoppers on the same scale.\n\nWill this latest redesign change its fortunes? The final fuel-economy piece appears to be in place, but the car’s debut couldn’t come at a tougher time as a number of competitors have recently redesigned their family sedans, too. Regardless, the new Mazda 6 is good enough to grow its presence in the segment and is worth a test drive.\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in February 2013 about the 2014 Mazda6. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2015, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nI’ve always liked the driver-focused nature and distinctive design of the Mazda6 midsize sedan, but its sales have languished far below the class leaders. For 2014, Mazda makes another charge at the segment heavyweights with an all-new version.\n\nBesides sharp styling and a sporty driving experience, the 2014 Mazda6 comes armed with something even more important that positions it to challenge the segment leaders: fuel economy that’s at the top of the class.\n\nAt an event held by the automaker in Austin, Texas, I tested both manual- and automatic-transmission versions of the 2014 Mazda6. The base Sport trim with a six-speed manual transmission starts at $21,675 (all Mazda6 prices cited include a $795 destination charge). The as-tested prices of the models I drove — a six-speed manual Sport and a top-level Grand Touring with a six-speed automatic — were $21,675 and $31,490, respectively. To see the Mazda6’s specs compared with the Ford Fusion, Honda Accord and Nissan Altima, click here.\n\nThe New Face of Mazda\nThe 2014 Mazda6 adopts a shieldlike grille that’s tamer than some of the brand’s recent designs. It works to good effect, giving the sedan a certain pugnaciousness. For many brands, grille design has become a way to both distinguish models and maintain a family resemblance, and the new face of Mazda accomplishes that on the Mazda6 and other models like the CX-5 small crossover.\n\nSome of the Mazda6’s prior styling cues, like the bulging front fenders, have been retained, but one of the car’s prettiest aspects is its rear styling. Some cars’ tails don’t look like they’ve received much design attention. Not so with the Mazda6, which gets an intricate trunk lid, wraparound taillights with smoked lenses and a tidy chrome strip running the width of the car. It’s a design that wouldn’t be out of place on the back of a luxury sedan.\n\nRide & Handling\nThe Mazda6’s suspension tuning keeps with Mazda’s sporty focus. The result is a taut ride that reveals many details about the road — and whether it’s well-maintained or not. The car also exhibits admirable body control, with limited body roll during hard cornering. Beyond that, the Mazda6 feels like a smaller car than it truly is — in a good way — and this goes a long way toward establishing its nimbleness.\n\nThe biggest area for improvement, though, is the steering. While nicely weighted and responsive, the system fails to deliver the kind of feedback you get when driving the compact Mazda3 — a revelation compared with many other models in its class. The new Mazda6 does get a smaller steering wheel and a quicker steering ratio, but the lack of road feel stands out in a sedan that’s otherwise engaging for the driver.\n\nSkyActiv Technology\nThe 2014 Mazda6 is the second Mazda model to get the full suite of technologies termed SkyActiv, which aim to reduce fuel consumption without compromising how the car drives. SkyActiv touches important vehicle systems such as the body structure, suspension, transmission and engine. Mazda says SkyActiv will also encompass alternative powertrains for future fuel-economy gains. One such powertrain — a clean-diesel engine — will be offered in the Mazda6 in the second half of 2013.\n\nWith its direct-injection 2.5-liter four-cylinder gas engine, the Mazda6’s performance is comparable to many four-cylinder family sedans. The engine doesn’t push you back in your seat, but it gets you up to speed reasonably well. The engine is refined all the way to its redline in terms of both vibration harshness and sound.\n\nWhat the Mazda6 really needed — and got for 2014 — was better estimated gas mileage. The prior sedan’s estimates trailed most of its competitors, but the 2014 version is near the top of the pack with an EPA-rated 25/37 mpg city/highway for the six-speed manual transmission and 26/38 mpg for the six-speed automatic.\n\nApart from promising better mileage than the stick, the automatic transmission also makes the four-cylinder look good, providing low-speed smoothness and precise shifts at higher speeds. The automatic is responsive; it will kick down quickly if you mash the gas pedal.\n\nMore than the automatic, the manual transmission reveals the four-cylinder’s lack of low-rpm power. Acceleration is modest from a standing start, even when letting the engine rev to its limit before shifting gears. The four-cylinder feels less stressed when snaking along winding roads at a steady clip.\n\nThe manual shifter itself is exceptional. Its precision is rare among midsize sedans, and the light clutch pedal is well-suited to the car.\n\nCabin Design & Roominess\nThe cabin’s dominant design feature is the vertical-face dashboard. The control layout is simple, and it’s easy to understand the controls within a matter of minutes, which is far from a certainty today with the introduction of “advanced” technologies like Ford’s MyFord Touch interface. The Mazda6 has its share of available features, but they’re self-contained.\n\nMaterials quality is mostly good. There are lots of soft-touch surfaces, and the cabin’s metallic accents are a good imitation of real metal. The power window switches and the trim around them is of a lower grade than the rest of the cabin, but materials consistency is otherwise good.\n\nWhether you choose the standard cloth or optional leather upholstery, the front bucket seats are comfortable and have just enough bolstering to keep you situated when rounding a fast corner — but not so much that you feel confined during less aggressive driving. In moonroof-equipped cars, there’s little extra headroom when the driver’s seat is raised.\n\nThe backseat ranks among the more spacious ones in the segment, with room to spare for taller passengers like me (I’m 6 feet 1 inch); the seat cushion is high enough to provide some welcome thigh support.\n\nThe car comes with a standard 60/40-split folding backrest with release levers in the trunk. When folded, the backrest is nearly flat with the trunk floor, and the lack of a ledge between the two sections provides an uninterrupted surface. The trunk measures 14.8 cubic feet.\n\nFeatures\nTouring and Grand Touring trim levels bundle a range of features in option packages. For $2,000, Touring models can have a Technology Package that includes a Bose premium stereo, a navigation system, keyless entry, automatic headlights, rain-sensing windshield wipers, heated side mirrors and the Smart City Brake Support system. This infrared braking system works from about 2 to 18 mph and can prevent or reduce the severity of a low-speed rear-end crash.\n\nFor $900, Grand Touring models get radar-based adaptive cruise control and forward obstruction warning. Forward obstruction warning won’t apply the brakes if it senses an impending collision like Smart City Brake Support does, but it will warn the driver with an alert.\n\nBeginning in May 2013, Grand Touring trims will be available with the $2,080 Advanced Package, which adds to the adaptive cruise control and forward obstruction features a lane departure warning system, automatic high-beam headlights and Mazda’s i-ELOOP regenerative braking system. This system captures energy that would otherwise be lost during deceleration and uses it to power electrical components.\n\nSafety\nAs of publication, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration have not crash-tested the 2014 Mazda6, though its status as a mainstream family sedan means it will likely be tested at some point by the agencies.\n\nStandard safety features include side-impact airbags for the front seats, side curtain airbags, antilock brakes and an electronic stability system. A blind spot warning system, rear cross-traffic alert and a backup camera are optional.\n\nFor a full list of safety features check out the Features & Specs page.\n\nMazda6 in the Market\nIn a market dominated by two nameplates — the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry — it’s not easy for something new to break in. Hyundai and Kia have had some success with the Sonata and Optima, respectively, but the Mazda6 hasn’t registered with family-sedan shoppers on the same scale.\n\nWill this latest redesign change its fortunes? The final fuel-economy piece appears to be in place, but the car’s debut couldn’t come at a tougher time as a number of competitors have recently redesigned their family sedans, too. Regardless, the new Mazda6 is good enough to grow its presence in the segment and is worth a test drive.\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Mazda6?\n\nThe Mazda6 is a five-seat mid-size sedan that’s powered by a choice of four-cylinder engines: a standard 187-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder or an available 227-hp, turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder. Both engines work with a six-speed automatic transmission. Competitors include the Kia Optima, Honda Accord and Toyota Camry.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Mazda6?\n\nThere are no significant changes this year.\n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Mazda6 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard active safety features include forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning, lane-keeping assist, blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert and adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability.\n\nOther standard features include automatic LED headlights, rain-sensing windshield wipers, 17-inch alloy wheels, the Mazda Connect multimedia system with an 8-inch touchscreen, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, dual-zone automatic air conditioning and push-button start.\n\nAvailable features include heated front seats, ventilated front seats, heated rear seats, a heated steering wheel, a power moonroof, a Bose premium stereo, a head-up display and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity.\n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Mazda6?\n\nIn the mid-size sedan class, the Mazda6 stands out for its handling and available premium finishes. However, the base four-cylinder engine could use more low-end power, and efficiency-focused shoppers looking for a hybrid version will have to look at one of the Mazda6’s competitors.",

      "expert_review": "Mid-size cars are often boring, but they don’t have to be, and Mazda’s is anything but: The 2016 Mazda6 excites with its dynamic looks, sophisticated interior and agile road manners.\n\nFor 2016, the Mazda6 sedan gets a mild exterior face-lift along with a revised control layout and upgraded cabin materials. Compare the 2015 and 2016 models here.\n\nThe Mazda6 competes in a large class of midsize sedans, including the Honda Accord, Ford Fusion and Toyota Camry; compare them here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nWhen I spotted the Mazda6 in Cars.com’s parking garage, it happened to be sandwiched between two late-model midsize sedan competitors, the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord. It easily out-styled them both.\n\nThe 2016 model wears a wider, deeper version of the brand’s shield grille, as well as LED-accented headlamps with a more upswept design. Bulging front fenders and a more sculpted body combine to create a taut, ready-to-launch look.\n\nHow It Drives\nI own a Mazda5 minivan, and the fact that Mazda can make it relatively fun to drive should give you an idea of how well the sedan handles. A sporty on-road experience has been a Mazda6 hallmark, and the 2016 version continues to deliver. It’s fun to drive overall, with firm, precise steering and a nimbleness around corners that’s unmatched by other midsize sedans. Excellent around-town maneuverability makes it feel like a smaller car.\n\nQuiet, however, it is not, especially on the highway. Noise was a problem with the previous generation, and it’s still an issue now; the cabin could use more isolation from the road, wind and the engine.\n\nThe sole engine, a 2.5-liter making 184 horsepower, is no powerhouse from a stop, but midrange muscle is strong. The six-speed automatic downshifts promptly and smoothly for extra oomph as soon as you need it; a six-speed manual is standard. A selectable available Sport mode alters engine and transmission settings for quicker downshifts and brisker acceleration from a stop.\n\nThe Mazda6’s EPA-estimated fuel economy is class-leading, thanks in part to their Skyactiv-Drive technology. When equipped with Mazda’s i-Eloop brake energy regeneration system, the sedan gets a 40 mpg highway rating. The i-Eloop system captures and stores lost braking energy and then uses it to help power electric systems in the car that would otherwise put a load on the engine (which in turn uses fuel). But the option package isn’t cheap at $2,180. Because the i-Eloop design is different from the regenerative braking systems found in hybrid and electric vehicles, the brakes themselves feel normal, with a solid, linear feel rather than dull, bricklike responsiveness.\n\nFuel economy is still impressive without the system: 26/38/31 mpg city/highway/combined with the automatic. That beats the competition’s comparable base models: the 2.4-liter Accord with a continuously variable automatic transmission (27/36/31), the 2.5-liter Fusion (22/34/26) and the 2.5-liter Camry (25/35/28).\n\nThe standard manual transmissions in the Mazda6 and Accord sacrifice 2-4 mpg combined versus their automatics.\n\nInterior\nInside, Mazda combines a classy design with upscale materials, and the effect is nothing short of lovely. Upgrades for 2016 are obvious: Padding was added to key touch points, and the new glossy black and aluminum-look trim pop against the black-and-cream color palette. High-quality leather and dashboard stitching in my top Grand Touring trim added an air of luxury. I question how well the cabin in the Touring will age, however. With only 2,000 miles on the odometer of the car I drove, there was a sooty layer of grime on the cream leather door armrest — and that was before my kids got in.\n\nRoom in both rows of my Grand Touring is just right, and Mazda said it’s improved the seats, front and back. Comfort in front is excellent thanks to great thigh support and cozy bolstering. In back, the seats have long bottom cushions and supportive side bolsters. The middle spot isn’t a real option, however. It sits higher, it’s hard and legroom there is cramped by the floor hump.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nMazda wisely gives the user choices when it comes to controlling its multimedia interface. Front and center is the latest version of Mazda Connect, with its 7-inch touch-screen riding higher on the dash this year; a console-area knob can also control the screen. The system’s menu structure is logical, and I appreciated the controller knob’s buttons: Clearly marked “back,” “home” and “star” buttons (for favorite presets) flatten the system’s learning curve.\n\nOne big annoyance: The touch-screen doesn’t work while the car is moving. That’s counterintuitive, given, in my estimation, using the knob pulls more focus from the road and requires extra steps to do some functions. Another: The audio volume dial is next to the control knob, which is an awkward reach from the driver’s seat. Steering-wheel audio controls help, however.\n\nThe climate controls also got bumped to a higher, handier position. Also new for 2016 is a head-up screen called an Active Driving Display. It sits directly in front of the driver, and while you can control the information it displays, you can’t fold down the thin gray screen, which is distracting. It powers up when the car is turned on and only flips down once the car is turned off.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe center console bin offers a decent amount of room, but it’s awkwardly placed. It’s set too far back to comfortably rest an elbow on the padded top, and opening it is an awkward maneuver. In the back of my Grand Touring, a flip-down center armrest holds the only cupholders back there, though there’s a bottleholder in each door.\n\nTrunk space is small for the class. With 14.8 cubic feet of room, it trails the Accord (15.8), Camry (15.4) and Fusion (16.0). The opening is wide, however, and pulling two levers in the trunk easily folds the 60/40-split seat almost flat. Two shallow, plastic-lined bins on the side of the trunk came in handy for carrying a plant home from the grocery store without a mess.\n\nSafety\nAs of this writing, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety had not yet tested the 2016 Mazda6. The Camry is a Top Safety Pick Plus, while the Accord and Fusion are Top Safety Picks, disqualified from the “Plus” designation because their optional frontal-crash prevention systems earned basic ratings instead of advanced or superior. In National Highway Traffic Safety Administration crash-testing, the 2016 Mazda6 earned five out of five stars.\n\nWe were able to comfortably fit two child-safety seats in the Touring’s backseat, but accessing the Latch anchors was challenging due to the stiff leather seat cushions; for details, see our Mazda6 Car Seat Check.\n\nA backup camera is standard on all models except the base, manual-transmission trim; its placement high on the dash is especially helpful.\n\nOptional safety equipment includes two automatic braking systems. Smart City Brake Support automatically applies the brakes to stop a low-speed crash. Smart Brake Support works at higher speeds as a forward-collision warning system that alerts the driver of an impending crash then automatically applies the brakes to prevent or reduce the severity of the crash. Other optional safety features include a blind spot monitoring system, rear cross-traffic alert and a lane departure warning system. Click here for a full list of safety features.\n\nValue in Its Class\nA base Mazda6 starts at $22,315, or $23,815 with an automatic transmission. That’s slightly lower than the base, manual Accord but slightly higher than the Camry and Fusion, which have standard automatics, and the cheapest automatic Accord (all prices include destination charges). With the automatic, the 6 is well-equipped with standards like the Mazda Connect multimedia system, a backup camera, Sport mode and HD Radio.\n\nThe Mazda6 almost sounds too good to be true, delivering an excellent blend of value, fun-to-drive sportiness, knockout styling and family-friendly practicality. But will the updates for 2016 be enough to move its sales needle? I hope so. Competitors handily outsell it month after month, but this overlooked sedan really deserves some attention.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Most significant changes: New key fob design\n\nPrice change: Base prices are $200 higher on all models. Destination charge is unchanged at $920.\n\nOn sale: Late fall\n\nWhich should you buy, 2019 or 2020? 2019. No significant changes for 2020, and dealers should have plenty of leftover 2019s available with discounts.\n\nMazda’s mid-size Mazda6 sedan sees minimal changes for 2020. A new smart key fob design places the lock-and-unlock and panic buttons on an edge of the fob, and the top-line Signature model gets a new badge.\n\nRelated: Mazda3: Which Should You Buy, 2019 or 2020?\n\nSales of the Mazda6 have continued to fall in calendar year 2019, dropping more than 30 percent through October to 18,380 units, another sign of the massive migration of buyers to crossover SUVs. Mazda has said it intends to offer a diesel engine and all-wheel drive in the Mazda6, but neither has materialized.\n\nFor those still interested in sedans, the Mazda6 is a sporty, stylish alternative to cars such as the Toyota Camry, Honda Accord and Hyundai Sonata. All models possess athletic handling ability, a roomy interior with luxurious touches, and an impressive array of standard safety features. On the downside, the infotainment system is operated through an 8-inch touchscreen that allows changes only when the car is stopped, and it’s clunky to use.\n\nThe base Sport model and the Touring come with a 187-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine that delivers decent fuel economy but feels sluggish at low speeds. The Grand Touring, Grand Touring Reserve and Signature use a turbocharged 2.5-liter that generates 227 hp with regular gas and 250 with premium, and it provides more satisfying acceleration. Both engines team with a six-speed automatic transmission.\n\nPrices start at $24,920 (including destination) for the Sport, and the Grand Touring is $2,600 more than that. The Grand Touring is $30,620, the Grant Touring Reserve checks in at $33,120 and the Signature is a hefty $36,220, but with sales of the Mazda 6 slipping, dealers should be offering generous discounts. There are no individual options or packages available, so the only choices are the different trim levels and their standard content.\n\nThe 2020 models weren’t yet at dealerships, and Mazda would only say that they should arrive later in the fall.\n\nResearch the 2019 Mazda6\nFind a 2019 Mazda6 Near You\nFor 2019 Mazda6 and CX-9, Crash Safety Is a Plus\nRecall Recap: The 5 Biggest Recalls in July 2019\n2019 Mazda3: 10 Things We Like (and 7 Not So Much)\n2019 Mazda6 Drops Stick, Adds Safety Tech, Bumps Price\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nMazda’s five-seat front-wheel-drive sedan benefits from a sportier nature than some of its competitors. Four-cylinder “i” models and V-6 “s” versions are available. Competitors include midsize sedans like the Honda Accord, Ford Fusion and Chevrolet Malibu.\nNew for 2013\nThere are no significant changes for 2013. A fully redesigned Mazda6 is expected to debut for the 2014 model year.\nExterior\nThe Mazda6 sports a long hood with pronounced front fender flares that flow through the headlamps and mold with the front bumper. Exterior features include:\n\n\nStandard body-colored grille, front and rear bumpers, door handles and moldings\n16-inch steel wheels with full covers\nOptional 17- or 18-inch alloy wheels\nOptional LED taillamps\nSingle tailpipes (four-cylinder models) or dual exhaust outlets (V-6 models)\n\nInterior\nAll trim levels get a 60/40-split folding rear seat with remote capability. Interior features include:\n\n\nStandard tilt/telescoping steering wheel with audio controls\nStandard air conditioning with pollen filter; optional dual-zone automatic air conditioning\nStandard power locks, windows and mirrors (heated mirrors are optional)\nOptional power moonroof with interior sunshade\nOptional Bose stereo\nOptional DVD navigation system with 7-inch touch-screen and a backup camera\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Mazda6 features a four-wheel independent suspension. Four-cylinder and V-6 engines are common in this segment, but the standard six-speed manual transmission (with the four-cylinder) plays up Mazda’s performance roots. There are also two automatic transmission offerings: The four-cylinder engine can have an optional five-speed automatic, and the V-6 comes with a standard six-speed automatic (it can’t be had with a manual). Mechanical features include:\n\n\n170-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder with 167 pounds-feet of torque\n272-hp, 3.7-liter V-6 with 269 pounds-feet of torque\nOptional push-button start\n\nSafety\nThe Mazda6 offers an optional blind spot warning system. Other safety features include:\n\n\nStandard front-seat side-impact airbags\nStandard side curtain airbags\nStandard antilock brakes with electronic brake-force distribution\nStandard electronic stability system and traction control",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Fun to drive, great to look at and difficult to use, the Mazda6 is a fantastic car that’s let down by truly awful multimedia controls. \n\nVersus the competition: It feels tighter inside than some of its competitors, but the Mazda6 is undeniably more engaging and entertaining to drive. Yet while it’s also blessed with a nicer interior, its multimedia strategy prevents it from being competitive with the latest and greatest sedans on the market. \n\nThe mid-size sedan class continues to shrink as buyers favor more expensive and spacious mid-size SUVs, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t still buyers out there who don’t need or want to sit up high in a faux truck. For them, Mazda forges ahead with its mid-size family sedan, the Mazda6.\n\nFor 2021, the Mazda6 gets a new Carbon Edition trim level that amps up its already svelte looks with some additional visual tweaks. The competition is as fierce as it’s ever been, though — perhaps even more so now that the segment’s pool of buyers has shrunk year-over-year. Can the addition of a fun trim package keep the Mazda6 in the running?\n\nRelated: Wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto: Where Are They Now?\n\nNo Shortage of Style\n\nOne advantage the Mazda6 has always had over its competitors is its looks. The 2021 Mazda6 is the best-looking mid-size sedan Mazda has ever made, and it’s a damn sight prettier than any of its competitors. The car’s latest styling update has only made it more appealing, with low, swooping fender lines and aggressive cat-eye headlights that evoke comparisons to Jaguars and classic Alfa Romeos — two brands in a class well above the one where Mazda plays. \n\nThere’s no anonymous, generic family-sedan styling here; Mazda is carving out a niche for sedan buyers who want more than just a transportation appliance. The Mazda6 stands in stark contrast to the odd lines of the latest Honda Accord, the bizarrely fish-faced Toyota Camry and the utterly generic Nissan Altima and Subaru Legacy. The Carbon Edition adds a little more zoot to the lines, with black metallic-finish 19-inch wheels and tires, a gloss-black rear lip spoiler and door mirrors, and only one paint choice: Polymetal Gray. \n\nYour Sportiest Alternative?\n\nOther brands have sporty versions of their mid-size family sedans, but few live up to their promises. The Toyota Camry TRD looks aggressive and handles well, but it falls short in the powertrain and braking department. Honda’s big Accord is the same; it looks like it should be fun, but its size and softness ultimately betray any sporting intentions. Not so the Mazda6: Its combination of chassis refinement, light and nimble handling, and an absolutely dynamite turbocharged powertrain combine to make it the driving enthusiast’s choice in this category. \n\nThe Mazda6 Carbon Edition is powered by a turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine that makes 250 horsepower and 320 pounds-feet of torque if you fill it with 93-octane gasoline. Those figures drop to 227 hp and 310 pounds-feet of torque with regular 87-octane gas, which drops it lower than its competitors. The Hyundai Sonata N Line, for example, gets 290 hp from its 2.5-liter turbo four-cylinder on regular gas, while the Camry XLE’s optional V-6 hits 301 hp on 87 octane. The Carbon Edition I drove must have been filled with the high-zoot juice, as the acceleration it generated was plentiful. The engine is mated to an automatic transmission with six speeds, which is a few gears short of a lot of vehicles these days. That means that in order to achieve decent fuel economy, the Mazda6 likes to stay in higher gears. It shifts down quickly and eagerly when called upon with minimal lag, but it won’t hang in those lower gears long unless you’ve engaged Sport mode, which makes for a bit more frenetic around-town cruising. Suffice it to say that keeping it in its normal modes is the way to go; shift into Sport mode only when you plan on driving in a more aggressive manner. \n\nYou might end up wanting to do that more often than you think, though, especially if you live somewhere with twisty roads. The car is a hoot to toss around, with light, direct steering that provides decent feedback, plus a responsive powertrain that’s always happy to play — and none of that is compromised by a ride that’s too stiff or overly sporty. Balance is the name of the game here, and the Mazda6 provides it in spades. The only dark mark on its bright performance report card is its braking; pedal feel is too soft for a sporting-themed car like this. There’s little initial bite, and while a firm press on the brake does enough to bring the car to a halt, there’s not much in the way of pedal feedback. That makes things feel a bit mushy and less confidence-inspiring than I’d like. It’s enough to make you dial back your enthusiasm and keep your driving behavior in check so you don’t get into trouble on a back road. \n\nIf you get too happy with the throttle, your fuel economy is likely to feel the pinch despite Mazda’s SkyActiv engine management technology. Fuel economy for the big-engined Mazda6 is EPA-rated at 23/31/26 mpg city/highway/combined, and my week with the beast saw it net 24.5 mpg — not unexpected given the aggressive way I usually drove it. Surprisingly, the Mazda’s official rating is solidly in the hunt for a gas mileage prize right along with cars featuring eight- and 10-speed automatic transmissions, including the Honda Accord Sport (22/32/26 mpg), Hyundai Sonata N Line (23/33/27 mpg) and even the V-6 powered Toyota Camry TRD (22/31/25 mpg). Unlike those cars, however, the Mazda6 has no hybrid variant. There’s a non-turbo model that’s rated 26/35/29 mpg, but if you’re looking for big-time fuel economy in the range of 40-50 mpg, you’ll have to shop a hybrid competitor. \n\nThe Deal-Killer\n\nDynamically, there’s little to fault the Mazda6. Inside, however, is a big problem. There’s no issue with the interior materials, which are top-notch, and kudos to Mazda for not being afraid to deploy some color, as well: The Carbon Edition includes deep burgundy-red leather hides on the seats and trim. The interior feels narrower than the cabins from Honda and Hyundai and its backseat legroom is on the tight side (especially compared with the limousine-like rear seats in a Volkswagen Passat), but Mazda did a good job meeting its goal of a near-premium environment that can chase the higher end of the market. And there aren’t a lot of controls to confuse you; Mazda keeps button clutter to a minimum and graces you with clear, easy-to-read gauges instead of a fully digital cluster.\n\nNo, there’s no complaint with how it’s all put together — the deal-killer is the car’s utterly inadequate multimedia system. It’s difficult to use, backward-thinking in its operational strategy and out of date. Perhaps that seems a harsh verdict to render, but the Mazda6’s multimedia system is bad enough to prevent me from recommending this car. \n\nWhat’s the big issue? You can’t use the touchscreen while the car is in motion. If you want to do anything — like change the radio station or switch audio functions — you have to use a remote knob and five-way controller mounted low on the center console between the front seats. So instead of just touching the thing you want on the screen, which is up at eye level, you have to figure out how to find what you want via a remote controller, adding steps and distraction to the process. It’s absolutely daft and in need of a complete rethink — especially in an age when Hyundai and Kia offer some of the most amazing, state-of-the-art multimedia technology in the class. (Toyota and Honda still feel a bit behind, as well.) Even Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are affected by this setup; if you don’t intend to use the system that much, it won’t be a big problem, but if you do, it’s a serious issue — perhaps even a safety issue.\n\nPriced to Compete\n\nAs an automaker, Mazda has designs on punching above its weight class with a lot of its vehicles, and it’s gone to great lengths to improve its interiors to reflect that. But even with its eyes set on loftier targets, it’s maintained more mainstream, competitive pricing. A basic 2021 Mazda6 Sport trim starts at $25,470 (all prices include destination). The Carbon Edition seen here is a few rungs up the trim ladder, starting at $33,945 but without much extra in the way of options — other than accessories like all-weather floormats or mud guards — so well equipped is the base model. Adding navigation gets you a $400 SD card that slots into the console and activates the embedded system. There’s only one trim above the Carbon Edition: Signature, which starts at $36,895 and includes even nicer Nappa leather trim.  \n\nThat kind of pricing puts the Mazda6 Carbon Edition squarely in the hunt for mid-size sedan buyers. It even comes in on the lower side of the sporty variants offered by competing automakers. Its combination of driving fun, upscale interior design and materials, and a competitive (if not exactly class-leading) interior space would make it a solid alternative for people tired of the same old options from Honda and Toyota … if it weren’t for its abysmal multimedia system. The system will ruin the experience for many drivers; a car simply should not be so tricky and inherently distracting to use. Until Mazda has a solid rethink about how it approaches control of its onboard electronics and smartphone integration, my recommendation is to consider another brand.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Mazda tweaked its flagship sedan for the 2017 model year. For 2018, Mazda is making a good thing even better with a light update to the Mazda6 — just in time as rivals like the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry are redesigned for 2018. It features a luxurious new top trim, the Signature model, along with lightly revised styling and a new engine option.\n\nExterior\nChanges to the Mazda6’s exterior are light; the sedan’s signature chiseled body and swooping curves return anchored by a pumped-up grille with studded accents and a more creased front bumper. Slimmer headlights that integrate more angular slitlike foglights round out the Mazda6’s dynamic face. Mazda says there’s new 17- and 19-inch wheel designs and a new color — Soul Red Crystal — joins the lineup.\n\nInterior\nLike its CX-9 and CX-5 siblings before it, the sedan’s interior got an upgrade. Mazda says the interior is all-new, and that only the steering wheel and some trim pieces carry over from the previous model year. One big change is the control panel’s stretched, horizontal design. Cabin materials also look upscale; on top Signature models, premium Japanese Sen wood trim and Nappa leather adorn the cabin. Other new highlights of the cabin include an updated Mazda Connect multimedia display that uses sharper color contrast, a 360-view camera and a reconfigurable 7-inch thin-film-transistor display; optional ventilated seats are also newly available for 2018.\n\nMazda also redesigned the sedan’s front seats; the automaker says they’re wider and use high-density, vibration-absorbing urethane foam for a firm but supportive feel. The automaker claims the seats are designed to help keep front occupants’ spines in the body’s natural standing S-shape. \n\nUnder the Hood\nMuch is changed under the hood. The Mazda6’s current engine gets an update and a new turbo joins the lineup.\n\nThe current 2.5-liter four-cylinder now features cylinder deactivation, which will allow it to run on fewer cylinders under light loads for better gas mileage. Fuel-economy estimates have not yet been released, however. Mazda says the six-speed automatic also has been updated to ensure the transition between four- and two-cylinder mode is imperceptible.\n\nNew for 2018 and available on higher trim levels is the turbocharged 2.5-liter engine, borrowed from the CX-9 SUV. In both the sedan and SUV, it makes 250 horsepower on premium fuel, 227 hp on regular unleaded gas. It too will pair with the six-speed automatic transmission; a manual transmission is only available on non-turbo models.\n\nMazda said it also made a number of enhancements to the sedan’s suspension that should make for a smoother, quieter ride. The steering also has been updated, and Mazda says it should be more responsive and have a more direct feel.\n\nSafety\nThe Mazda6’s i-ActivSense suite of safety features carry over to 2018; they include lane keep assist, traffic sign recognition, automatic high beams, distance-keeping cruise control and autonomous safety braking support. Also new is adaptive cruise control that can bring the sedan to a complete stop then accelerate back up to the set speed once traffic clears.",

      "expert_review": "The 2011 Mazda6 is like that nice guy who wins your heart after you’ve finished dating bad boys — in this case SUVs and sports cars. It’s an affordable, good-looking midsize sedan that could easily win over car shoppers if only given a chance.\n\nWith competition like the Honda Accord, Toyota Camry and Hyundai Elantra, the 2011 Mazda6 isn’t always at the top of car shoppers’ lists, but it should be because of its edgy design and fun-to-drive V-6 engine.\n\nSo, how do you fall in love with a nice guy? Give him time. I was glad to have two weeks to test drive the Mazda6. I learned that a smooth, quick ride isn’t the exclusive domain of the bad boys. The optional V-6 engine also made me happy not only because of its pep, but because it takes regular gas.\n\nThe 2011 Mazda6 has a starting MSRP of $19,990. At $28,305, my test car, the s Touring Plus trim, wasn’t exactly a cheap date, but it was a fun, affordable one.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe Mazda6 has sporty details that are missing on other midsize sedans. It looks slick coming and going with its aggressive headlights and angled taillights. Add in the angled tailpipes and any parent would look hip driving the Mazda6 in the school drop-off lane.\n\nAdding to the Mazda6’s appeal is school-age kids can get in and out of it with ease, though adults might hit their heads on the rear doors’ roofline when assisting smaller kids. Such is the hassle with sleeker-looking sedans these days, and it’s a sacrifice we make for style. The doors are easy to open for younger ones, and even better is they close easily from inside.\n\nThe Mazda6 has a sizable trunk that could easily handle a week’s worth of groceries or even a stroller. Parents with jogging strollers will want to check if it fits in the trunk, though.\n\nThe optional 272-horsepower, 3.7-liter V-6 is paired with a six-speed automatic transmission. The only thing missing for me was a manual transmission, which only comes with the Mazda6’s 170-hp, 2.5-liter four-cylinder. The downside of having the V-6 is it gets an EPA-estimated 18/27 mpg city/highway. The four-cylinder gets 21/30 mpg when paired with the six-speed manual or 22/31 with the five-speed automatic transmission.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nINTERIOR\nIt’s the interior where the Mazda6 seems to be the most nice guy-ish. The styling isn’t horrible, but it’s a bit bland and is where the five-seater’s value aspect is most prevalent.\n\nAbove the center control panel, there’s a dot-matrix-looking readout and some unconvincing metallic-looking plastic. At least the Mazda6 was trying to dress up like the nice guy who wears a tie for a date. It has faux-wood trim that keeps the interior from looking too bland.\n\nThere were some requisite creature comforts such as a standard tilt/telescoping steering wheel and a sunroof in my test car, but I wonder if it’s enough to keep a gal, er, consumer interested for the long haul. Fortunately, there was lots of space in the center console and glove box. All my gadgets had a place to go. Neat and tidy is a good thing!\n\nThe backseat had plenty of legroom for my two kids, and the cupholders in the fold-down armrest were easy for them to reach. The rear seats are split 60/40, making it a cinch to haul longer items.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2011 Mazda6 received the highest score of Good in frontal-offset and side-impact crash tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. It received the second-highest score of Acceptable in the roof-strength test, and the second-lowest score of Marginal in rear crash tests by IIHS.\n\nThe two sets of lower Latch anchors in the outboard seats were easy to use, as were the three tether anchors. Even better, I could fit a rear-facing infant seat behind the driver’s seat when it was adjusted to my preferences. There was even a little room to spare! The kids’ boosters fit well, too. This was a revelation as many sedans have sculpted rear seats that are comfortable for adults, but not good for boosters.\n\nThe Mazda6 has standard front-wheel drive, all-disc antilock brakes with electronic brake-force distribution, an electronic stability system with traction control, blind spot warning system, and six airbags, including side curtains for both rows.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2011 Mazda6 here.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in December 2009 about the 2010 Mazda6. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2012, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the three model years.\n\nMazda redesigned its midsize sedan just last year, but the radical new styling failed to bring in a legion of buyers. In fact, sales of the 6 slipped after the redesign, which rarely happens. Perhaps it was the troubled economy that kept buyers away, because after a week of testing a fairly well-equipped Mazda6, I can’t for the life of me figure out what family-sedan shopper wouldn’t be tempted by this car.\n\nThe ride is extremely comfortable, there’s plenty of power, it looks great and, oh yeah, it packs a ton of features at a price that beats the competition. You can read a review of the 2009 Mazda6 that features an optional V-6 engine here. My impressions of the 2010 four-cylinder are below.\n\nExterior\nHow could Mazda not get attention with a sedan this good-looking? My Sangria Red test car didn’t necessarily draw stares, but it stood out when parked in my driveway on a suburban street. It looked like it came from another planet compared with the other family-haulers in my neighborhood.\n\nThe bulging headlights and radically curved front fenders are undoubtedly the features that most set the 6 apart in its class. Unlike a lot of recent designs, the 6 isn’t a polarizing vehicle. It’s more handsome than jaw-dropping, and I prefer the look to Ford’s new Fusion sedan or the Chevy Malibu, let alone more staid imports like the Honda Accord, Toyota Camry and Nissan Altima.\n\nIf you were shopping this class on looks alone, I think the Mazda6 might win outright.\n\nInterior\nInside, I can see fewer people loving the two-tone color scheme and sport-oriented layout of the dashboard. It screams more tech-geek-friendly than family-friendly, but the quality is certainly on par with others in its class. My only issue when it came to interior feel was with the controls in the middle of the dashboard. They weren’t as nice or substantial as those you’ll find in Nissan and Honda right now, but they’re not cheap, either. The red lighting around the gauges and buttons is a bit jarring at night; I had to turn the brightness down quite a bit.\n\nThe midrange i Touring Plus trim level I tested featured cloth seats that were extremely comfortable during my hour-plus commute to work. The seats’ good thigh support was a big factor in that, and that’s something often overlooked.\n\nThe Mazda6 is also extremely spacious inside. How big is it? It beats even the large Accord in rear legroom, so a family of four shouldn’t outgrow this sedan. I fit both a rear-facing infant safety seat and a large, front-facing convertible child safety seat in the back, and there was plenty of room for the front passenger seat to move back. We even tested the infant seat behind the driver, because a reader wanted to know which sedans would be good for twins. Trying to put an infant seat behind the front seat of a car, rather than in the middle of the bench seat, usually requires sliding the front seat far forward, making its location uncomfortable. If you have twins, that means both the passenger and the driver would have to move into uncomfortable seating positions, which I wouldn’t advise for safety reasons. The Mazda6 — and the Accord — pass the twin test well.\n\nAt 16.6 cubic feet, the Mazda6’s trunk is the biggest in the class. It’s positively huge.\n\nPerformance\nWhen the Mazda6 debuted last year, I drove a powerful V-6 version called the “s.” That car handled like a true sport sedan, with relatively heavy steering and a pretty rough ride. It was fun, but I didn’t think the gains in performance were worth the sacrifices in everyday comfort.\n\nI was expecting a similar experience with the four-cylinder model, minus all that power, but I was pleasantly surprised to find a sedan that nearly matches the Camry in terms of ride comfort. While it wasn’t quite as cushy as the Camry — which is so cushy some drivers find it unappealing — I would put it alongside the Fusion and Malibu in terms of offering a good combination of comfort, handling, noise isolation and acceptable acceleration. This is the version of the Mazda6 that’s a terrific daily driver.\n\nThe Mazda6’s mileage isn’t as great as some of the competition, at 21/30 mpg city/highway for the automatic, four-cylinder model I tested (20/29 mpg with the manual transmission). The V-6 s trim gets 17/25 mpg. After filling up at the gas station, I calculated my mileage at less than 21 mpg after commuting in heavy traffic for more than 300 miles. The trip computer registered 21.5 mpg over the same distance.\n\nAutomatic, four-cylinder versions of the 2010 Accord, Fusion and Camry return 21/31, 22/31 and 22/32 mpg, respectively.\n\nWhile EPA gas mileage figures are important, a 1-2 mpg difference isn’t enough for me to sway a buying decision from a car I want because of its looks or its comfort to one with marginally better mileage.\n\nFeatures\nWhen you test cars for a living, it’s easy to fall for them from the driver’s seat. Testing a new Mercedes or even a new Toyota can be great — until you see the price. Yes, we get sticker shock, too, especially because the test cars we get are often loaded with every option.\n\nThe i Touring Plus trim is interesting because it’s not offered with any options. For $23,750, you get an automatic transmission, a moonroof, a power driver’s seat, 17-inch wheels, Bluetooth, a backup camera, a USB port, and a blind spot monitoring system. That’s a heavy dose of features, especially the blind spot system, which can be a $1,500-plus option on other cars — and they’re usually of the luxury variety.\n\nSafety\nThe Mazda6 features the normal array of airbags, including side-impact airbags for the front seats and side-curtain airbags. Stability control is also standard. The sedan received a top overall rating of Good in front and side-impact crash tests conducted by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, but it received a Marginal overall score for rear-impact whiplash protection and an Acceptable rating in IIHS’ new roof-crush test. Because of that roof-crush rating, the Mazda6 isn’t an IIHS Top Safety Pick for 2010 — as the Chevy Malibu, Chrysler Sebring, Dodge Avenger, Subaru Legacy and Volkswagen Passat are — but apart from its whiplash rating, its scores are good.\n\nMazda6 in the Market\nIt’s rare to get through a review with few negative things to say about a car. Is the Mazda6 flawless? No. It could get better mileage, and it could have better acceleration and maybe some nicer buttons. In the end, though, the flaws are minuscule when compared with the overall value you get with the right trim level. Good looks and lots of interior room are also pretty hard to argue with.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "Zoom-Zoom Faith Gets an Amen\n2004 Mazda6 Sport Wagon\n\nSAN DIEGO\n\nMazda Motor Co. practices “Zoom-Zoom” — a corporate theology based on the belief that good cars have souls.\n\nIt is a faith that elevates cars and their various derivatives above the State of Ordinary, placing them into a State of Desire. This is important.\n\nOrdinary cars languish in the retail purgatory of poor sales, from which they are freed only through indulgences, or commercial prayers otherwise known as customer rebates.\n\nTruly ordinary cars, those absolutely devoid of anything that sparks buyer passion, often are beyond salvation. They frequently are banished to the hell of no sales and eventual oblivion.\n\nDesirable cars, those that have that special something, that which Mazda calls Zoom-Zoom, or motorized soul, have the power to convert consumers, popularize models previously considered losers, and thus move markets.\n\nConsider this week’s test car, the 2004 Mazda6 Sport Wagon.\n\nIn the BZZ (Before Zoom-Zoom) world, it might have been sold as a “station wagon” and treated as such in the marketplace. It would have been ordinary — a family hauler stemming from a blossoming family, thus necessitating the purchase of a four-wheeled appliance large enough to haul the offspring.\n\nBut the AZZ (After Zoom-Zoom) Mazda6 Sport Wagon takes a different approach. Indeed, its very name “Sport” signals joy, hope — the possibility that love will last long after marriage and procreation.\n\nSport! Yes! It’s a call to action, a challenge to abandon the stationary life, an invitation to get out there, by golly, and drive!\n\nAn aside: Belief is a matter of faith as faith is a matter of belief. One cannot exist without the other, and neither can sustain itself without action or some sort of sign. Let us consider the matter of signage, or signature, first.\n\nAs they do in the world’s great religions and in great nations that behave as if they are great religions, signs in the automobile industry must have strong emotional appeal. The buying faithful, or prospective commercial converts, must be able to look at a car’s badge and know exactly what it means and promises.\n\nMore important, in the matter of automobile signage, buyers must be able to look at a car’s body and know instantly, without ever looking at the badge, which company makes that car. That instant recognition, if successful, should yield instant joy and desire. At the very least, it should arouse potentially acquisitive curiosity.\n\nIn that regard, Mazda has done a masterful job with its mid-size, front-wheel-drive 6-Series Sport Wagon. The body looks sleek, rich. The Mazda badge — a stylized oval with what appears to be the bird of paradise flying through its center — is huge and, in some quarters, might be considered overdone. But it works well with the overall package, effectively calling atten tion to itself and the vehicle it represents.\n\nThat much was proved in test-drives around San Diego and its wealthy environs, where the Sport Wagon drew favorable nods in traffic, as well as in shopping-center and hotel parking lots.\n\nThe car’s interior drew more raves . . . and some complaints. The American buying public apparently has gotten into its collective head the errant notion that mid-priced wagons are supposed to have cheap, unimaginative, vinyl-laden interiors. That is the only way I can explain the overwhelming surprise of spectators who found high-quality materials, easy fold-flat rear seats and nifty items such as a standard retractable barrier net that raises from the floor and attaches to the interior roof.\n\nTall drivers, those taller than my 5 feet 7 inches, complained that the center, floor-mounted console in the Sport Wagon’s front cabin intruded on their knees. But even they were pleased with the car’s overall presentation.\n\nZoo -Zoom, of course, would be meaningless were it faith without action. Happily, that isn’t the case here. The Mazda6 Sport Wagon comes with a standard three-liter, 24-valve, 220-horsepower, V-6 engine. Handling rivals that of some bona fide sports coupes. The thing moves so well, it’s enough to make you shout, “Hallelujah!”\n\nNuts & Bolts\n\nDownside: Mazda needs to rethink the positioning and design of the floor-mounted, center console in the Sport Wagon. Long-legged people complained mightily about it.\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: Excellent in all three categories. The car runs with confidence in high-speed, high-traffic environments such as the Pacific Coast Highway (when traffic is moving). It handles valley curves and dips with aplomb. It’s quite enjoyable.\n\nHead-turning quotient: High and favorable, unusual for a mid-size, mid-priced wagon of any sort.\n\nBody styles/layout: There are three Mazda6 models — the tested Sport Wagon, the Mazda6 5-Door hatchback (designed to look like a sports coupe) and the Mazda6 sedan. All are front-engine, front-wheel-drive.\n\nEngine and transmissions: The standard three-liter V-6 engine in the Sport Wagon develops 220 horsepower at 6,300 revolutions per minute and 192 foot-pounds of torque at 5,000 rpm. The engine is linked to a standard five-speed manual transmission. A five-speed automatic with overdrive is optional.\n\nCapacities: The Sport Wagon has seating for five people. Cargo volume with rear seats up is 33.7 cubic feet; it’s 60.5 cubic feet with those seats folded. Fuel capacity is 18 gallons of gasoline (regular unleaded recommended).\n\nMileage: I averaged 25 miles per gallon in the Sport Wagon with the five-speed manual. That fell to 23 mpg with the automatic.\n\nSafety: Overall rigid body construction; collapsible brake and accelerator assemblies (to reduce the risk of severe foot injuries in frontal crashes); front, side and head air bags; whiplash-reducing front-seat headrests; and rear child safety-seat anchors.\n\nPrice: The Mazda6 Sport Wagon goes on sale at Mazda’s 700 U.S. dealers this spring. Base price is $22,225. Dealer invoice price on base model is $20,494. Price as tested is $26,660, including $3,915 in options and a $520 destination charge.\n\nPurse-strings note: It’s a buy. Compare with Chevrolet Malibu Maxx, 2004 Saturn L300, 2004 Ford Taurus wagon (good value!) and the 2004 Volkswagen Passat wagon.",

      "expert_review": "Mazda redesigned its midsize sedan just last year, but the radical new styling failed to bring in a legion of buyers. In fact, sales of the 6 slipped after the redesign, which rarely happens. Perhaps it was the troubled economy that kept buyers away, because after a week of testing a fairly well-equipped Mazda6, I can’t for the life of me figure out what family-sedan shopper wouldn’t be tempted by this car.\n\nThe ride is extremely comfortable, there’s plenty of power, it looks great and, oh yeah, it packs a ton of features at a price that beats the competition. You can read a review of the 2009 Mazda6 that features an optional V-6 engine here. My impressions of the 2010 four-cylinder are below.\n\nExterior\nHow could Mazda not get attention with a sedan this good-looking? My Sangria Red test car didn’t necessarily draw stares, but it stood out when parked in my driveway on a suburban street. It looked like it came from another planet compared with the other family-haulers in my neighborhood.\n\nThe bulging headlights and radically curved front fenders are undoubtedly the features that most set the 6 apart in its class. Unlike a lot of recent designs, the 6 isn’t a polarizing vehicle. It’s more handsome than jaw-dropping, and I prefer the look to Ford’s new Fusion sedan or the Chevy Malibu, let alone more staid imports like the Honda Accord, Toyota Camry and Nissan Altima.\n\nIf you were shopping this class on looks alone, I think the Mazda6 might win outright.\n\nInterior\nInside, I can see fewer people loving the two-tone color scheme and sport-oriented layout of the dashboard. It screams more tech-geek-friendly than family-friendly, but the quality is certainly on par with others in its class. My only issue when it came to interior feel was with the controls in the middle of the dashboard. They weren’t as nice or substantial as those you’ll find in Nissan and Honda right now, but they’re not cheap, either. The red lighting around the gauges and buttons is a bit jarring at night; I had to turn the brightness down quite a bit.\n\nThe midrange i Touring Plus trim level I tested featured cloth seats that were extremely comfortable during my hour-plus commute to work. The seats’ good thigh support was a big factor in that, and that’s something often overlooked.\n\nThe Mazda6 is also extremely spacious inside. How big is it? It beats even the large Accord in rear legroom, so a family of four shouldn’t outgrow this sedan. I fit both a rear-facing infant safety seat and a large, front-facing convertible child safety seat in the back, and there was plenty of room for the front passenger seat to move back. We even tested the infant seat behind the driver, because a reader wanted to know which sedans would be good for twins. Trying to put an infant seat behind the front seat of a car, rather than in the middle of the bench seat, usually requires sliding the front seat far forward, making its location uncomfortable. If you have twins, that means both the passenger and the driver would have to move into uncomfortable seating positions, which I wouldn’t advise for safety reasons. The Mazda6 — and the Accord — pass the twin test well.\n\nAt 16.6 cubic feet, the Mazda6’s trunk is the biggest in the class. It’s positively huge.\n\nPerformance\nWhen the Mazda6 debuted last year, I drove a powerful V-6 version called the ”s.” That car handled like a true sport sedan, with relatively heavy steering and a pretty rough ride. It was fun, but I didn’t think the gains in performance were worth the sacrifices in everyday comfort.\n\nI was expecting a similar experience with the four-cylinder model, minus all that power, but I was pleasantly surprised to find a sedan that nearly matches the Camry in terms of ride comfort. While it wasn’t quite as cushy as the Camry — which is so cushy some drivers find it unappealing — I would put it alongside the Fusion and Malibu in terms of offering a good combination of comfort, handling, noise isolation and acceptable acceleration. This is the version of the Mazda6 that’s a terrific daily driver.\n\nThe Mazda6’s mileage isn’t as great as some of the competition, at 21/30 mpg city/highway for the automatic, four-cylinder model I tested (20/29 mpg with the manual transmission). The V-6 s trim gets 17/25 mpg. After filling up at the gas station, I calculated my mileage at less than 21 mpg after commuting in heavy traffic for more than 300 miles. The trip computer registered 21.5 mpg over the same distance.\n\nAutomatic, four-cylinder versions of the 2010 Accord, Fusion and Camry return 21/31, 22/31 and 22/32 mpg, respectively.\n\nWhile EPA gas mileage figures are important, a 1-2 mpg difference isn’t enough for me to sway a buying decision from a car I want because of its looks or its comfort to one with marginally better mileage.\n\nFeatures\nWhen you test cars for a living, it’s easy to fall for them from the driver’s seat. Testing a new Mercedes or even a new Toyota can be great — until you see the price. Yes, we get sticker shock, too, especially because the test cars we get are often loaded with every option.\n\nThe i Touring Plus trim is interesting because it’s not offered with any options. For $23,750, you get an automatic transmission, a moonroof, a power driver’s seat, 17-inch wheels, Bluetooth, a backup camera, a USB port, and a blind spot monitoring system. That’s a heavy dose of features, especially the blind spot system, which can be a $1,500-plus option on other cars — and they’re usually of the luxury variety.\n\nSafety\nThe Mazda6 features the normal array of airbags, including side-impact airbags for the front seats and side-curtain airbags. Stability control is also standard. The sedan received a top overall rating of Good in front and side-impact crash tests conducted by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, but it received a Marginal overall score for rear-impact whiplash protection and an Acceptable rating in IIHS’ new roof-crush test. Because of that roof-crush rating, the Mazda6 isn’t an IIHS Top Safety Pick for 2010 — as the Chevy Malibu, Chrysler Sebring, Dodge Avenger, Subaru Legacy and Volkswagen Passat are — but apart from its whiplash rating, its scores are good.\n\nMazda6 in the Market\nIt’s rare to get through a review with few negative things to say about a car. Is the Mazda6 flawless? No. It could get better mileage, and it could have better acceleration and maybe some nicer buttons. In the end, though, the flaws are minuscule when compared with the overall value you get with the right trim level. Good looks and lots of interior room are also pretty hard to argue with.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "The Mazda6 midsize sedan has been refined for 2017 with interior tweaks, a significant upgrade in its safety technology and improvements in driving dynamics and comfort.\n\n\nFor 2017, the Sport, Touring and Grand Touring trims continue but, in line with the industry trend toward higher trim levels, you will be able to check the box for a new top-level Grand Touring Premium Package that incorporates some of the features of the redesigned 2016 CX-9 SUV's new Signature top trim.\n\nThe 2014 redesign and tweaks for 2016 carry over to 2017 with only slightly reshaped side mirrors. Not that there is anything wrong with that: The midsize sedan continues to be a stylish and sporty-looking alternative to its generically designed rivals. A new extra-cost color option is Machine Gray Metallic, first seen as an option on the CX-9.\n\nInterior\n\nThe overall design is the same, but materials and features have been upgraded through the trims and the sedan gets a new steering wheel design also first seen on the 2016 CX-9.\nThe new Grand Touring Premium Package adds Nappa leather seats in black or off-white with contrasting piping, new satin-finish metal trim, and heaters for the steering wheel and outboard rear seats.\nThe clever Active Driving Display, Mazda’s head-up display using a clear reflective screen that pops up from the top of the dash, has been upgraded to full-color with higher brightness. The optional seat memory now also stores this display’s angle, brightness and content settings. The driver information display in the instrument cluster also now is color, bringing it in line with newer rivals.\nPerhaps most importantly, Mazda says it has made improvements to reduce interior road and wind noise, a major complaint about the Mazda6 from the judges in Cars.com’s 2016 Midsize Sedan Challenge. Mazda says it has improved the door seals, put thicker glass in the front doors, and added more sound insulation to the headliner, underbody and doors. The Grand Touring trim gets laminated acoustic  glass in the front doors.\n\nUnder the Hood\n\nThe 184-hp, naturally aspirated 2.5-liter four-cylinder SkyActiv-G engine carries over, as do the six-speed automatic and six-speed manual transmissions. New G-Vectoring Control software enhances chassis performance by using small amounts of engine torque in response to steering wheel input to shift load to the front or rear, increasing grip and stability, improving ride control and limiting understeer. Mazda says this system also helps a driver more easily maintain the intended line in any situation and should improve handling and stability in slippery conditions, such as rain or snow.\n\nSafety\n\nThe Mazda6’s already extensive list of active safety technologies in its available i-ActivSense system is bulked up further with new functions for 2017. The 2016 Mazda6 already was an Insurance Institute for Highway Safety Top Safety Pick Plus, with the top rating of good in the crash tests and a top score of superior for the optional crash prevention technology. For 2017, a new Forward Sensing Camera has been combined with the milliwave radar-based system, adding pedestrian detection to the front collision avoidance system with automatic emergency braking. It also adds a Traffic Sign Recognition system that can identify speed limit, no-entry and stop signs, and alert the driver. Also new is lane keeping assist in addition to lane departure warning.",

      "expert_review": "The Mazda6 midsize sedan entered its second generation for 2009 with an all-new exterior, and completely revamped interior, a new base four-cylinder engine and some new transmission choices.\n\nMazda introduced the original 6 as a 2003 model, replacing the popular 626 with a new single-digit designation and a whole host of improvements.\n\nNow, though, the No. 4 Japanese automaker has taken this sporty sedan to a whole new level, making an already good car an even better competitor to the segment-leading Toyota Camry and Honda Accord.\n\nThis is an important segment, as more than two million U.S. consumers buy new midsize cars every year. There are at least 12 vehicles competing for those customers, with the newest generation of the Chevrolet Malibu now challenging the Camry and Accord’s dominance of the segment, which also includes the sporty Nissan Altima.\n\nWith the original Mazda6, whose marketing efforts introduced Mazda’s “zoom, zoom” advertising theme, Mazda created what it considered to be a combination of sports car and sedan, breaking from the somewhat boring practicality of the Accord and Camry.\n\nThe whole idea was to create a midsize family car that offered enthusiasts an affordable alternative to the run-of-the-mill sedans. The first Mazda 6 was a fun car to drive in all configurations, and quickly established itself as something different in a field of sameness.\n\nThe truth is in the driving, and our test car offered some of the most-spirited acceleration and confident handling that I’ve ever experienced in an (almost) affordable family sedan.\n\nI say “almost” because our tester was the 272-horsepower, V-6 S Grand Touring model, the top-of-the-line version, whose price was $28,260 (plus $670 freight and options). That’s nearly $10,000 more than the base Mazda6 with its four-cylinder engine, which begins at $18,550.\n\nStill, even the four-cylinder model, with its 170 horsepower and standard six-speed manual transmission offers a fun driving experience – at a relatively bargain price.\n\nMazda said the new 6 takes everything the company “learned from the first-generation car, as well as lessons learned from volumes of customer feedback, and proves Mazda’s commitment to continuous improvement.”\n\nIt’s also the first Mazda designed, engineered, developed, and manufactured “on U.S. soil with the intention of surpassing American customer needs in countless categories,” the company said, adding that the goal was to instill “the soul of a sports car” into the new 6.\n\nKey styling cues were taken from the Mazda RX-8 sports car, including the front fenders and the raked roofline. Interior design elements include round gauges, a three-spoke steering wheel, and a T-shaped instrument panel.\n\nThere is ample room for up to five adults, and the trunk has 16.6 cubic feet of space. The rear seat has a 60/40 fold-down feature to allow for longer cargo.\n\nThe base model is the SV, equipped with a 2.5-liter inline four-cylinder engine rated at 170 horsepower and 167 foot-pounds of torque. While the manual gearbox is standard, a five-speed automatic is optional.\n\nThe 3.7-liter V-6 Sport model, with 272 horsepower and 269 foot-pounds of torque, begins at $24,130. Only a six-speed automatic transmission is available with the V-6, but it has manual-shift capability for sportier driving.\n\nOther trim levels include the four-cylinder Sport model ($20,250); the four-cylinder Touring model ($21,705); the four-cylinder Grand Touring model ($24,910); the V-6 Touring model ($25,075); and our tester, the V-6 Grand Touring.\n\nThe four-cylinder engine is a new Mazda design, and is available with either the base six-speed manual or optional five-speed automatic transmission. EPA fuel economy ratings are 21 mpg city / 30 highway with the five-speed automatic, and 20/29 with the manual.\n\nThe V-6 engine is the same one used in the Mazda CX-9 crossover utility vehicle, and it has EPA ratings of 17 city/25 highway.\n\nStandard on all models are air conditioning, power windows/mirrors/door locks, four-wheel disc antilock brakes, electronic stability control with traction control, seat-mounted front side air bags, side-curtain air bags for front and rear passengers, an AM/FM/compact-disc stereo with six speakers, a tilt and telescopic steering wheel, two 12-volt power outlets, floor and cargo mats, and a tire-pressure monitoring system.\n\nSport models also get cruise control, an auxiliary audio jack, and remote keyless entry system.\n\nWith the four-cylinder Touring model comes 17-inch alloy wheels, an eight-way power driver’s seat, advanced keyless entry system with pushbutton ignition, electroluminescent gauges, black decoration panel, leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, center console sliding armrest, fog lights, trip computer and anti-theft security alarm.\n\nThe V-6 Touring models get the above extras, but the wheels are 18-inch alloys instead of the 17-inch.\n\nGrand Touring models get heated leather seats, a memory for the driver’s seat, a power passenger seat, rain-sensing wipers, dual-zone automatic climate control, auto-dimming rearview mirror with universal garage opening, automatic xenon headlights, heated auto-dimming exterior mirrors, LED rear combination lights, a blind-spot monitoring system, Bluetooth phone connection, and a ground illumination and interior lighting system.\n\nThe front bucket seats are slightly bolstered to allow for spirited driving without the driver sliding out of the seat. The rear seat offers adequate legroom and enough width for three people, but the middle position is more comfortable for a child than an adult.\n\nExtras on our tester included a navigation system ($2,000); California smog certification ($100); and a power moon roof and Bose audio-system package ($1,750). With the Bose system came a six-disc CD changer and Sirius satellite radio.\n\nAll Mazda6 models are assembled at the joint Ford-Mazda plant in Flat Rock, Mich.\n\nThe automotive columns of G. Chambers Williams III have appeared regularly in the Star-Telegram since 1994.

      "expert_review": "As late as 1999, the Swedish carmaker offered a mid-size four-door hatchback (a.k.a. “five-door”) that set Saab lovers’ shakras aflutter. I went to a Saab owners convention in the mid-1990s – where there were more gray ponytails than in a herd of Appaloosas – and was regaled with tales of cargo-swallowing achievements: how this guy got a roll-top desk home in his Saab, and how that guy remodeled his kitchen without ever resorting to the crassness of a pickup truck.\n\nI have yet to get the smell of patchouli out of my clothes.\n\nSome essential self-reliance went out of the brand when Saab discontinued its hatchbacks (the 900 and 9000 series had them), though it wasn’t simply that the overlords back in Detroit (GM) were insensitive.\n\nIn the United States, the five-door models didn’t appeal much beyond the brand’s core constituency – think Howard Dean’s constituency, only with money.\n\nThat was then. Half a decade later, hatchback and wagon variants are popping up like rain forest mushrooms as carmakers rush to provide flex-cargo alternatives to suddenly so-last-summer SUVs. The Mazda6 comes as a sedan, a five-door hatchback and a wagon.\n\nOffhand, I can think of only one other nameplate that hangs more bodywork over the same chassis – the Ford Focus, which can be had as a three-door, a four-door, a five-door and a wagon.\n\nMayhap it’s time for the Saab hatch to make a triumphant return?\n\nThe case for the Mazda6 five-door – as opposed to the sedan or the wagon – is easily made. For one thing, it’s the coolest looking of the three. The fast-glass canopy and the more graceful curvature of the rear roof pillar pull the body lines rearward with more dispatch, lending the hatchback a leaner, sleeker profile; an altogether ornery-looking spoiler is standard. It seems to me all recent Mazda cars look like they are going downhill, even while sitting on level ground.\n\nThe Mazda6 five-door is a case study in the evocative power of cheap plastic. Standard equipment on the car includes body-colored side-sill extensions and sport bumpers front and rear, for a slightly slammed, ground-effects look, as well as body-colored grille, door handles and mirrors.\n\nUnlike a lot of aftermarket bolt-ons that can make cars look like they got dressed in the dark, these handsome factory pieces complement the car very, um, dope-ly.\n\nOur test model, a sport edition with the 3.0-liter V6 and five-speed manual transmission in “Blazing Copper Metallic” (the exact color of copper gasket sealant, by the way) smoldered in the driveway.\n\nMeanwhile, the five-door sups cargo with a big ladle. The rear cargo hold, with seats up, measures 22 cubic feet, about 7 cubic feet more than the sedan version.\n\nWith the 60/40 split rear seats folded flat, the cargo hold expands to a Saab-like 58 cubic feet, only a couple feet shy of the capacity of the wagon.\n\nA little housekeeping: Two engines are available in the Mazda6 range – a 2.3-liter, 16-valve inline four (155 hp) in the i Sport model and a 3.0-liter, 24-valve V6 (220 hp) in the s Sport. The five-door comes with the five-speed manual as standard. A six-speed automatic is available with the V6.\n\nThe five-door is fairly well decked, equipment-wise: 17-inch alloy wheels with performance rubber; halogen fog lights; eight-way power adjustable driver seat; leather steering wheel, shifter and emergency brake; automatic dual climate control; and dual front and rear side air bags and air curtains.\n\nOption packages include the moon roof/audio package that stuffs in a 200-watt Bose system with six-disc in-dash changer, and the leather package, which includes heated front seats.\n\nUnlike most overachievers, this car is instantly likable – taut and well drawn, comfortable and capable. Even so, you would not compare it to its competition, such as the Honda Accord or the Nissan Altima, and conclude it’s made of sterner stuff.\n\nActually, the Mazda has the vaguest tinniness to it, a quality amplified when the car encounters less-than-perfect pavement. The wishbones-and-multilinks sports suspension is harder than day-old baguettes, and it feels even a bit zingy on L.A.’s concrete quilt work.\n\nIt’s not until you bend into an off-ramp that the setup pays off as the car shoulders into the camber and noses around.\n\nWith an easy agility and composure at the limit of the tires’ adhesion, the front-wheel-drive Mazda6 is a fun car to drive hard, but you do need to dig your spurs in. Like other Mazda motors, the V6 puts out most of its power and torque in flight-of-the-bumblebee range.\n\nWith variable-valve timing and all kinds of cybernetic engine controls, this high-revving nature is purely a matter of choice for Mazda’s powertrain engineers, an aesthetic choice they see as part of brand character. At least they have a fixed idea of what that is.\n\nIf you really torment this 3,336-pound car, you can get it to 60 mph in 7 seconds, with a gritty, jaggedly serrated note from the chrome exhaust tips as accompaniment. Just coincidentally, the old Saab 900 five-door was a tad soft at low revs too.\n\nI can’t say I endorse the faux titanium finish on the consoles, though. This surface material picks up scratches pretty quickly, and the test car had a noticeably worn area around one of the climate controls.\n\nSlowly but surely, I grew enamored of the Mazda6 five-door, with its balance of performance and practicality worthy of the Ikea loading zone. Mazda’s in-house tuning operation, Mazdaspeed, will soon stick a bottle rocket in the 6 sedan’s bazoo, creating a 274-hp, all-wheel-drive sedan to rival cars such as Audi’s S4 and Subaru’s WRX STi.\n\nWhy not hotrod the five-door? I need to get back from Ikea before the meatballs get cold.\n\n*\n\n(BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)\n\n2005 Mazda6 S Five-Door\n\nBase price: $22,655\n\nPrice, as tested: $24,905\n\nPowertrain: 3.0-liter, 24-valve V6, with variable-valve timing; five-speed manual transmission; front-wheel drive\n\nHorsepower: 220 at 6,300 rpm\n\nTorque: 192 pound-feet at 5,000 rpm\n\nCurb weight: 3,336 pounds\n\n0-60 mph: 7 seconds\n\nWheelbase: 105.3 inches\n\nOverall length: 186.8 inches\n\nEPA mileage: 19 miles per gallon city, 26 mpg highway\n\nFinal thoughts: Up the hatches\n\n——————————————————————————– Automotive critic Dan Neil can be reached at dan.neil@latimes.com.",

      "expert_review": "My husband loves those ginormous Chinese buffets that offer miles upon miles of gleaming, steaming cuisine. He takes a deep breath and a warmed plate and wades in to lay waste to the landscape; basically, he’s all about quantity. I, however, am not quite so excited by those prospects. You see, I know the kung pao chicken, mu shu pork and lo mein aren’t going to live up to the hype. In the end, regardless of how much I choose to load on my plate, I’m going to come away unsatisfied. I had that same experience driving the Mazda6. It looked really pretty in my driveway and has an impressive list of features and options. By all indications, it should be a great car, yet I found it to be extraordinarily mediocre. Not unlike that Chinese restaurant, I was left feeling somewhat empty.\n\nThe Mazda6 is sporty and cute, and the Touring version I drove even had some nice rims on it (I don’t notice wheels, but my husband was kind enough to point them out to me). My husband also commented on the comfy, eight-way-adjustable heated seats, which I enjoyed as well – initially. After they were on a couple of minutes, though, they started to get uncomfortable, and I couldn’t find the button to turn them off without looking away from the road (it’s hiding underneath the center console, FYI).\n\nThe Mazda6 looks pretty good on the inside, as well. The instrument panel is attractive and boasts a seriously cool pop-up navigation screen. Push a button, and – voila! A 7-inch display appears. Ironically, however, the navigation system is, well, hard to navigate. I got where I was headed before the system could locate my destination and calculate a route.\n\nThe Mazda6 also comes with a big platter of cool standard and optional features, most of which work better in theory than in practice. There’s a V-6 engine that’s supposed to be all peppy and stuff, but it’s not. The automatic climate control took some serious figuring out, especially since the controls are at the bottom of the instrument panel and the little screen that tells me what I’m choosing is at the top. That screen, by the way, displays info for the climate control, clock and stereo systems all at the same time. It’s just not big enough to contain all the information it houses. Most of the information is abbreviated and hard to decipher. I love satellite radio, but it’s too much work in the Mazda6. The little screen and multifunction buttons made it difficult to find my channels, and the integrated antenna kept losing the signal. So even when I managed to find a song I liked, it cut out every time I went under a tree; it sounded as if the stereo was stuttering. I gave up and just listened to CDs instead.\n\nThe backseat is roomy enough that I didn’t feel at all guilty sticking our friends back there on double-date night. It could even fit three, so long as the center passenger didn’t require a safety seat or much legroom. The trunk in the Mazda6 is pretty good-sized, and the rear seats fold down in a 60/40 split in case you need more space.\n\nBasically, the Mazda6 looks great on paper, but I had tons of little gripes that, put together, overshadowed the basic style and functionality of the car. My foot kept sliding off the gas pedal because it seemed to sit too close to the wall, and the bottle holder in the front doors wouldn’t hold anything bigger than a soda can. The auto-locking seat belts were a bit too sensitive, so my kids needed several tries to extend the belt out far enough. Also, the receptacles were wiggly, so my little one couldn’t get them to buckle without a struggle (by which I mean whining). There aren’t any hooks or other containment devices in the trunk, so my groceries went rockin’ and rollin’ all the way home. The wide turning radius made U-turns and parking far more difficult than it needed to be, and even the V-6 engine, as I mentioned, seemed sluggish. I felt like my minivan could blow the doors off this sport sedan; I’m sorry to mix my ethnic food metaphors, but that’s just not kosher.\n\nJust like my husband at the Chinese buffet, I had high expectations when the Mazda6 pulled into my driveway, but after every last crumb had been wiped away, this car just wasn’t as appetizing as I’d hoped it would be.\n\nFor more information on the Mazda6 and its safety features, visit Cars.com.

      "expert_review": "Mazda’s marketing campaign wants me to experience that certain “emotion of motion;” the idea of being united with the road. Well, considering the ease with which I forgo my children’s normal bedtime to zoom around marveling at the Christmas lights, I’d say they’ve succeeded.\n\nI willingly weave through multiple neighborhoods while listening to Christmas music through the standard Bose speakers, succumbing to my son’s wishes to get a closer look at an “even better, brighter house.” Now if only I would have thought to bring the hot chocolate and marshmallows, I might be able to call myself a super-mom. Yeah, right, in my dreams! Super-whirlwind is more appropriate.\n\nAt night, I immediately dim the red-lighted dash, which my husband refers to as the “angry dash.” It is the holiday season, after all, but I also find this red annoying. As a matter of fact, I’ve read that the color red is hunger-inducing … now I can blame my covert haphazard binging of leftover Halloween candy (a sacrifice I am only willing to make for the sake of my son and his oral health, of course) on this phenomenon.\n\nThe interior of the Mazda6 Sport Wagon is outfitted in a tasteful manner. At first glance, I feel as though I’m in a luxury vehicle. It just has that look! Upon closer inspection, I realize that the features are simple and basic. Apparently, Mazda style does not mean forgoing elegance for cost. Speaking of cost, I am reassured to learn that the Mazda6 comes standard with dual front airbags, side airbags and side air curtains.\n\nThe exterior of the car has clean lines. I like the back, which has that sporty sleek wagon look, not to be confused with the antiquated station wagon concept. Esthetically speaking, the front of the vehicle and the 18-inch rims, exude a bit more muscle than I care for, but then, that’s just personal preference.\n\nI squeeze three child car seats (two car seats and one booster) into the back of the Mazda6. Utilizing the top tether anchor in the ceiling, I install the middle car seat, and find that the plastic cover to this anchor is stiff and difficult to open. Luckily, I don’t break a nail tinkering with it. Not that I have blazing red lacquered nails or anything; that’s a thing of the past. The thought only stirs up brief memories of electric nights and cosmopolitan life in the big city, or am I talking about my dreams again? Sometimes it’s so hard to differentiate!\n\nI try to store my sunglasses in the overhead console, and realize that they don’t fit (I guess they have just a little too much curvature). My husband is happy to use the space for his shades instead, and I opt to keep mine in the upper fuzzy-lined portion of the center console. Below this top console compartment, I find a larger space outfitted with a power outlet, which is suitable for all of my “techie” accessories.\n\nI also love the CD compartment in the front dash, which fits my standard-sized daily planner perfectly, a bulky must-have item that I dread toting along, especially because it usually ends up littering valuable floor space. I also make a mental note that a book could be neatly kept in this area.\n\nWhen opening the small glove box, I am pleased to find that Mazda stores the owner’s manual in an easy to contain zippered case. I also appreciate the driver and passenger side door compartments, which cleverly include bottle holders.\n\nInspecting the roomy “way-back,” I find a cargo area net that can be used as a separator between the trunk and the rest of the car. My family toys with the idea of dogs, and if we had them, I would definitely make use of this net. In reality, however, I’m just not ready to add dog hair riddance to my list of chores.\n\nAll in all, the Mazda6 Sport Wagon is a good, solid, all-around wagon, although I wish it had more of those life-enhancing, mommy-utilitarian features I so desperately need and enjoy.\n\n*For more information on the Mazda6 and its safety features visit Cars.com.\n\nLET’S TALK NUMBERS LATCH Connectors: 2 Seating Capacity (includes driver): 5\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT Storage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair Cargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSENSE AND STYLE Family Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair Fun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Some",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nMazda introduced a brand-new sedan in 2003 to replace its 626 model. Expected to rival European cars in ride and handling, the Mazda6 was built on an all-new platform. Developers used competitive models as benchmarks, including the BMW 3 Series, Honda Accord and Toyota Camry.\n\nThe Mazda6 is available in sedan, hatchback and wagon body styles. Buyers get a choice of two engines: a 2.3-liter four-cylinder that produces 156 horsepower or a 212-hp, 3.0-liter V-6. One of two automatics or a manual transmission can be installed.\n\nAll three body styles received an exterior redesign and interior updates for 2006. The optional Sport AT automatic transmission on four-cylinder models was upgraded to a five-speed unit. Mazda’s V-6 engine produces 212 hp at 6,000 rpm and 199 pounds-feet of torque at 5,000 rpm. Mazda juggled its trim levels for 2007, so check to see if the option you wanted on a 2006 is standard on the 2007 model.\n\nPerformance-oriented Mazdaspeed6 sedans hit showrooms in late summer 2005 as 2006 models. The Mazdaspeed6 is listed separately in the Cars.com Research section.\n\nExterior\nNarrow headlights flank a large, five-pointed grille with a Mazda logo. The wheel arches and belt line are well defined. For 2007, Violet Gray and Smokestone are new colors, with the latter available only on the sedan and wagon.\n\nBuilt on a 105.3-inch wheelbase, the Mazda6 sedan is 186.8 inches long overall. Base sedans get standard 16-inch tires, but all other editions ride on 17-inchers.\n\nInterior\nCompared with the old 626, the Mazda6’s wider body translates into extra space for five occupants. The driver’s seat adjusts through a 9.4-inch range, and the 60/40-split rear seatback folds down. A tilt/telescoping column holds a three-spoke steering wheel. An eight-way power driver’s seat goes into s models. The sedan’s trunk volume totals 15.2 cubic feet. A CD player is standard.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe 2.3-liter four-cylinder develops 156 hp while the 3.0-liter V-6 turns out 212 hp. Both engines can team with a five-speed manual transmission. A five-speed automatic is available in models equipped with the four-cylinder, while a six-speed automatic with a manual-shift provision is available in V-6-equipped models.\n\nSafety\nSide curtain airbags and seat-mounted side-impact airbags are standard in all Mazda6 models, as are antilock brakes and traction control.\n\nDriving Impressions\nThe Mazda6 is pleasant to drive and sportier than some of its rivals. This sedan takes curves confidently with modest body lean and satisfying grip. Moderate steering effort is accompanied by good feel and feedback.\n\nThough it’s no powerhouse, a V-6 sedan with the manual transmission exhibits spirited performance. The clutch is a bit touchy and the gearbox a tad notchy, but it’s easy to manipulate.\n\nOverall, the well-built Mazda6 is quite refined and exhibits excellent panel fit. Front and rear headroom is adequate, but space is just passable in the center rear position. Legroom is very good all around.",
