      "expert_review": "Nice car. Spacious. The 2.5-liter, 24-valve, 164-h.p., V-6 is peppy and the 5-speed manual is smooth shifting. The car is quiet overall, the 15-inch radials grip dry road well, the shoulder belts feature height adjustments in the pillars, and the fan offers a nifty feature whereby you can direct heat tothe feet but cooler air to the face so you don’t feel as if you are being microwaved after several miles of driving.\n\nWhile dual air bags are standard, ABS is an $800 option (standard in the ES). Stiff price, but don’t order a 626 without ABS, especially in the Snow Belt. And when you do, let the Mazda folks know that $800 is a hefty price to pay when the rest of the industry is bringing ABS prices down.\n\nBase price: $18,700. Add $70 for floor mats and $375 for freight.",

      "expert_review": "It is tough separating automotive truth from transplants, originals from facsimiles.\n\nThe Plymouth Laser is the Mitsubishi Eclipse, which is the Eagle Talon. Most of the Lexus ES300 is a Toyota Camry. Even a Bentley is fundamentally a Rolls-Royce, and the Mercury Capri is built in Australia from Mazda parts.\n\nThen there’s the Ford Probe.\n\nWhich is a Mazda MX-6.\n\nBoth are cab-forward sport coupes with powerful, identical V-6 engines and handling to live for.\n\nThe Probe costs a few hundred dollars less and its initial acceleration is half a gasp faster. But the MX-6 has superior seats and doesn’t have hog-ugly pop-up headlights.\n\nVoting a patriotic ticket resolves nothing: The Probe is built in Flat Rock, Mich. So is the MX-6.\n\nWhere Mazda breaks the tie is by rebodying its coupe as a sedan. From the slinky MX-6 comes the more suburban Mazda 626. Same engine with sufficient power and growl to darken the day of those being passed. Same monocoque construction, slick transmission and flex-free chassis.\n\nThe 1993 Mazda 626ES also is the perfect four-door, five-passenger, mid-size car for sports who like to indulge their chutzpah once in a while but cannot live with two doors, kidney-hugger seats and cramped luggage space.\n\nAnd with the three-car lineup starting at $14,255 and barely topping $22,000 for the leather-upholstered ES, the 626 competes favorably against Toyota Camry, Honda Accord and Ford Taurus–and could even divert the desires of penny-wise drivers from a BMW 325 or Lexus 300.\n\nAlthough the lines of Mazda’s 626 obviously were siphoned from the curves of the 929, an up-market sibling, the car doesn’t crouch and stay flat to evoke presumptions of spirited performance. It sits a little upright–more from the mold of the Toyota Corolla–with slender windshield and rear window pillars to reduce any suggestion of dumpiness.\n\nBecause this is a longer, sedan body shell on the shorter wheelbase and chassis of a sport coupe, the 626 has noticeable front and rear overhangs. They do not shriek. But the cast alloy wheels of the ES model, with their seven half-spokes and matching holes, are rather fussy.\n\nFive-spokewheels as mounted on the MX-6–and the Ford Probe–might have looked a little more adult.\n\nThe trunk appears abbreviated because the rear roofline travels high and far back to allow greater headroom for rear-seat passengers. Trunk space, however, remains 13.8 cubic feet, about as good as you’ll find on any mid-size sedan these days.\n\nIt is an OK shape. Viewed from the back, there’s even a rotund touch of Pillsbury Doughboy fun. Yet overall, the styling is generally safe, which means relatively uninspired.\n\nInternally, the Mazda 626 is a little more daring.\n\nFabrics and vinyl have quality looks and feel; on the more expensive models, carpet piles rise thick and the leather feels more like a Coach billfold. Sea ts grip from shoulders to thigh without being the least bit obtrusive.\n\nA gentle styling curve starts with the driver’s door armrest, then flows through the dashboard and around the cabin to create a subtle, encompassing, very personal compartment.\n\nThere is one awkward dashboard touch: The instrument hood isn’t much more than a fat upper lip, and it is set about 10 inches from the non-telescoping steering wheel. It is a gawky separation reminiscent of pedal cars.\n\nIn compensation, a myriad small but thoroughly satisfying touches abound on the 626ES: two cup holders central in the dash with another in the center console for back seat passengers or when traveling alone; a tiny dashboard drawer for parking meter change; a light inside outer keyholes for fumble-free door opening at night; a CD player that picks up where you switched off and not back at Track 1.\n\nA fully loaded ES is a $22,000 car carrying the equipment of most $32,000 cars. That list in ludes driver’s side air bag, anti-lock brakes, security system, heater vents for rear seats, power windows, sun and moon roof, and cruise control.\n\nTwo engines are available. The entry-level DX and upgraded LX are equipped with a four-cylinder, 118-horsepower engine for the sedate of soul. The ES comes with a 2.5-liter, 164-horsepower V-6 guaranteed to impress everything except a radar gun.\n\nIn performance and handling–despite extra poundage from four doors and the larger dimensions of any sedan–the 626ES that doesn’t look terribly athletic works as well as the MX-6, which has been canonized by the automotive press.\n\nThe car accelerates smoothly and quickly, sliding from rest to 60 m.p.h. in a tick beneath 9 seconds. And no matter how hard the loud pedal is floored, a well-braced, firmly engineered front suspension keeps this front-driver from displaying significant amounts of torque steer.\n\nBrakes on the ES are 10-inch discs up front, 9-inch discs in the rear, with a surplus of stopping potential; an ideal margin for any car that has the sense of something stolid but the potential of a wild thang.\n\nThe car is a rock-solid handler–thankfully a given for most mid-size sedans and all sport coupes these days–with a wonderful punch when flicking down from fifth to fourth gear in answer to some changing circumstance. Or to indulge the whim of playing with a remarkable surge of power at the high end.\n\nThere are many facets to Mazda’s 626. It is a people mover but also a personal pleasure. Here is a car for those who need four doors but who also know clear mornings when there are no groceries on the back seat.\n\nThis is no ordinary sedan.\n\nSee it more as a four-door coupe.\n\n1993 Mazda 626 ES\n\nThe Good Excellent four-door version of splendid two-door sport coupe. High-value car. Secure, coordinated handling.\n\nThe Bad Slightly chubby looks. Uninspired wheels.\n\nThe Ugly Set of steering wheel.\n\nCost Base: $18,725 As tested: $22,465 (includes driver’s side air bag, leather seats, anti-lock brakes, power moon roof, compact disc player, power driver’s seat, cruise control and power steering).\n\nEngine 2.5 liter, 24-valve V-6 developing 164 horsepower.\n\nType Four-seat, front-drive, mid-size sedan.\n\nPerformance 0-60 m.p.h., as tested, with manual transmission, 8.8 seconds. Top speed, estimated, 130 m.p.h. Fuel consumption, EPA average, city-highway, with 5-speed, 21 and 26 m.p.g.\n\nCurb Weight 2,800 pounds.",

      "expert_review": "With its conservative styling, inside and out, the Mazda 626 is an easy car to overlook. Especially because it does battle in the hottest hotbed of competition – the midsize sedan market – against such stalwarts as Camry, Accord and Taurus.\n\nAlthough everyone’s attention has been focused on Mazda’s greatest recent success, the tiny Miata retro sports car, or Mazda’s newly revamped MVP minivan, the 626 has been quietly plugging away as a decent seller for the company, which is partially owned by Ford. What many Mazda owners have discovered about these cars is that they can buy a high-quality, Japanese-derived vehicle (built in Flat Rock, Mich.) at a moderate price, even several thousands less than Camry, Accord or Taurus.\n\nThe trade-off: Although the 626 is a comfortable, nice-running sedan, it doesn’t have much of the subjective essentials that many buyers seek, such as image, character, stellar performance, bragging rights, etc.\n\nFor many other buyers, however, those things are not important, and a moderately priced, well-made sedan is just the ticket, even if it isn’t all that exciting.\n\nThe body style is balanced and attractive, although notching in with the common run of sedans. At one time, the 626 was a stylistic maverick, with some interesting looks, but Mazda seems to have locked its bread-and-butter family car into the stylistic gridlock of Japanese-look cars.\n\nThe interior is plain, even though the top-of-the-line ES-V6 test car was equipped with leather seating, full power and an excellent stereo. Mazda needs to get on the stick here and design the dashboard to look rich and refined. As it is, the dashboard, gauges and controls look more like something from a budget compact than any kind of top-drawer sedan.\n\nDriving the 626 initially, I was put off by the plainness of the interior and the lack of image overall. But I quickly grew to appreciate the comfortable ride, the fairly roomy interior and the nimble handling.\n\nOne thing I really appreciated was having a stick shift with a V-6, a formula that most other automakers have abandoned for their standard sedans. Among top-selling cars, Toyota Camry and Nissan Maxima still have this setup, but Honda Accord and the domestics have pretty much gone with straight V-6 and automatic, except for a handful of special-edition cars.\n\nManual shifting makes the 626 much more fun, sporting and quicker than if it were saddled with a slushbox. I do have a complaint about the engine, however.\n\nAlthough I thought the rumble of this small V-6 sounded gutsy and aggressive, most mainstream drivers will find it loud and annoying. It did idle quietly and vibration-free, but get on the throttle, and the noise and harshness come pouring in.\n\nAlso, 170 horsepower isn’t what it used to be. Yes, it’s plenty of power to move this little car with some zip, even with four people on board. But with much of the competition pushing or exceeding 200 with its upper-end V-6 engines, the 626 be gins to feel a bit overworked.\n\nThe ride and handling are good, right up with the segment leaders. According to a Mazda spokesman, Fred Aikens, handling and steering have been sharpened with some judicious chassis stiffening and suspension tuning. The rack-and-pinion steering has been made smoother and more responsive by using Teflon-coated parts to reduce friction.\n\nBraking is four-wheel disc, which should be standard on everything these days, but anti-locking and traction control are optional and extra. They should be standard.\n\nThe bottom line says a lot about this car, which is value. The bottom-end model, the LX with four-cylinder engine, starts at $18,000 but includes a full load of power features and accessories. The base engine makes 130 horsepower, which would most likely be more than adequate.\n\nThe test car comes standard fully equipped with all the goodies, including full-power features, leather seating, remote locking and alarm, cruise and cup holders. Th e test car had a few options, including the anti-lock braking and traction control and a CD changer.\n\nFully loaded with gear, the 626 still comes in at a fairly reasonable price. The subjective items, such as character and image, may be absent, but the more tangible pieces, such as value and quality, are present.\n\n2000 Mazda 626\n\nVehicle type: Five-passenger, four-door sedan, front-wheel drive.\nBase price: $22,445.\nPrice as tested: $24,220.\nEngine: 2.5-liter V-6, 170 hp at 6,000 rpm, 163 lb-ft of torque at 5,000 rpm.\nTransmission: 5-speed manual.\nCurb weight: 2,987 pounds.\nWheelbase: 105.1 inches.\nEPA mileage: 21 city, 27 highway.",

      "expert_review": "Mazda’s best-selling car was redesigned for ’98, so ’99 is the year for “refinement,” meaning the addition of a seat lifter crank, remote keyless entry, power antenna and illuminated vanity mirrors.\n\nThe 626 is offered in four trim levels, LX, ES, LX V-6 and ES V-6.\n\nWe tested the LX with the 2.5-liter, 170-h.p. V-6 (a 2-liter, 125-h.p. 4 in the base model) with a 5-speed manual, the engine, but not the transmission, of choice for Chicagoland. The 4-speed is standard on the uplevel ES. Mazda sent a V-6 with 5-speed to promote the car as an “enthusiastic sedan.”\n\nThe 5-speed is very smooth and easy to maneuver and the V-6 is fairly energetic yet still delivers 21 m.p.g. city/27 m.p.g. highway.\n\nGood road manners without unnecessary bumping and bouncing or lots of road harshness filtering back into the cabin.\n\nBase price is: $19,065. Speed-sensitive steering and four-wheel disc brakes are standard, ABS with traction control is a $700 option. Think twice about the $2,095 premium package because about the only essential is the power moonroof.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nMazdas midsize sedan returns with minimal change for 2001, and it appears that the present version will continue in present form through 2002. A redesigned 626 is scheduled to arrive for 2003.\n\nFord owns a controlling interest in Mazda and builds the 626 at a plant the two share near Detroit. The 626 was designed in Japan, however, and uses Mazda engines. The 626s front-drive platform serves as the basis for the new Mazda Tribute and Ford Escape sport utility vehicles.\n\nExterior\nThe 626 was last redesigned for 1998, when it grew to true midsize proportions. The wheelbase is 105 inches and the overall length is 187  a couple inches less than the Toyota Camry or Honda Accord.\n\nInterior\nSeats for five are provided on all models, with front buckets and a three-place rear bench seat with a split, folding rear seatback. The upholstery is cloth in the base LX model, and leather comes standard on the ES. Among the standard features on all models are air conditioning, a CD player, remote keyless entry and a security system with an immobilizing feature that activates if the incorrect key is used in the ignition.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine thats standard on both models generates 130 horsepower, and the optional 2.5-liter V-6 makes 170 hp. Both engines are available with a five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission.\n\nAcceleration is decidedly livelier with the manual transmission in both the four-cylinder and V-6, while the automatic tends to shift harshly compared to some rivals automatics.\n\nSafety\nSide-impact airbags for the front seats are packaged with antilock brakes as an option on all models.\n\n \n\nReported by Rick Popely  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2001 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "Shopping for a compact family sedan can be as confusing as sorting through the selections in the cereal aisle at your local grocery store. So many options, yet it all comes down to what gives you the most value for your money.\n\nThe 1995 Mazda 626 LX can boast about its V-6 engine and nimble handling, but it may not fit every family’s shopping list in other areas. And besides, it’s got one quirky little feature that may start some serious marital squabbles.\n\nShe: I couldn’t help but think about my sister you know, the one who subscribes to the Tightwad Gazette when we were testing the 626. She’s in the market for a compact family sedan, but I’m sure she’d X the Mazda off her list based on price alone. It costs more than $22,000! And the big question seems to be do you get $22,000 worth of car, especially when you compare its roominess and features to other entries like the Chevy Lumina?\n\nHe: Wait a minute. Is that the same sister who talks about saving dryer lint and making Halloween masks out of it for her kids? And don’t they already have a minivan with only 90,000 miles on it? For heaven’s sakes, why would they even consider buying a new car.\n\nShe: Well, she is and I think she’s very mainstream in the way she shops value is important to her. And she will buy new if the vehicle and the price are right. I can almost anticipate her questions about the Mazda. Do you get a lot for the money? Is it roomy enough for a family of four? Does it appeal to style-starved Moms who’ve been stuck in rather mundane-looking vehicles? And wait until I tell her about that awful feature I call the “marriage-buster.\n\nHe: The answers to her questions are no, no, and no. And don’t call me buster.\n\nShe: You’re so silly and if you’re not going to explain it, I will. It’s a swinging vent on the instrument panel that works like an oscillating fan. But it drove me crazy because I don’t like air blowing on me and you do. And it was always too cold. It reminded me of an old-fashioned electric blanket, one without dual controls. And you always had control of it, for some reason, just like you do with the TV remote. It made me angry.\n\nHe: I guess hyperbole is your strong suit, sweetie. So let’s get serious for a minute. For one thing, when was the last time I watched TV? Even more important, when was the last time I won an argument with you ? Leave me my small victories and my swinging vents. A Mazda exclusive, I might add.\n\nShe: I’m going to add one more complaint about the Mazda instrument panel and then I’ll say some nice things. The cupholders are a nice stationary design, but they aren’t big enough to hold a mug, a juice box or a Big Gulp. In addition, the cupholders block access to the 12-volt outlet, making it difficult to have a drink up front and talk on a cellular phone at the same time. Hey, these kinds of things are important to us spoiled American drivers.\n\nHe: That’s a nice mental picture you drinking your Big Gulp, gabbing on your cell phone and trying to shift the five-speed transmission. Your son Phil and I actually gave the 626 the acid test this past weekend when we dashed up north to do a little trout fishing. We were really impressed by how much junk we could stuff into the trunk, but less thrilled by how small the cabin feels, especially after you’ve driven 250 miles at a stretch. Our northern Michigan friend Uncle Jim, who is about my size, had a succinct observation about the Mazda’s size and features. He said: “Not much car for 22,000 bucks, huh?\n\nShe: I was disappointed to learn that items like antilock brakes are optional. But more importantly, I had the feeling that the 626 just hasn’t caught up with the rest of the market. Sure, it was a commendable car when the last redesign came out in mid-1992. At the time, the styling looked fresh and the V-6 engine put it a cut above other entries like the Honda Accord. But now we’ve got competitors like the new Taurus an e Dodge Intrepid, which raised the bar on styling, and the ’95 Lumina, which may not have the greatest looks, but gives you a lot of value for the money. You can get a comparably equipped Lumina for thousands less than the 626, and it’s way bigger and more powerful.\n\nHe: Let’s give the Mazda its due. I wouldn’t pitch this as your typical family sedan. It’s light and it’s nimble, with plenty of zip and the added bonus of great gas mileage. I see this more as a car for couples without kids, or with grown kids, who don’t need the extra space, but do like the convenience of the four-door design. The 626 looks and feels sportier than a Camry or an Accord.\n\nYou can read that two ways: On long trips, that sporty suspension can make for a rougher ride.

      "expert_review": "Mazda’s familiar 626 underwent a complete redesign last fall, but it takes a close eye to recognize the difference.\n\nWhip out the tape measure, however, and you will find that it is bigger in nearly every dimension. The wheelbase is 105.1 inches, and overall length is 186.8, 2.4 inches more than the old car. Most importantly, there is more than enough room inside for four, even five should the need arise. The trunk is larger, too.\n\nThe front is nearly a mirror image of the Millenia, Mazda’s luxury sport sedan that starts at $28,995 and ranges up to $36,595. The understated styling is successful, but some might think it needs a bit more pizzazz. What counts is the fact that this car is a substantial improvement over the previous 626, not only in size but all-around performance, and it comes to market at a very competitive price.\n\nThe base DX, with a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder and a 5-speed manual transmission, starts at $15,695. If you want a V6 the LX begins at $20,795. Atop the model lineup is the sporty ES, which is the model Mazda sent for me to drive. It is $23,995, fully loaded and with 5-speed manual gearbox. The ES is targeted at buyers who want room for the family without sacrificing driving fun.\n\nBuilt exclusively in the Flat Rock, Mich., AutoAlliance International\n\nplant that is a joint venture between Mazda and Ford, the 626 sits squarely in contention with competitors such as the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord.\n\nThe 170-horsepower, 2.5-liter engine is carried over from previous years, but with a higher compression ratio and a new air-flow sensor that provides quicker throttle response. This engine is delightfully smooth, although not overly powerful given the size of the car. Driven sedately, it performs with the same effortlessness of its V6-engined competitors. Wring it out, on the other hand, and use manual transmission vigorously, and the ES scoots along smartly. The shift linkage doesn’t feel as smooth as it does in the MX-6 coupe that uses the same powertrain. The tall fifth gear allows the engine to relax and settle into an easy pace on the highway, where it keeps up with the ever-more-speedy flow of freeway traffic.\n\nBy using computer-aided design, Mazda has been able to make the new body\n\nstronger and less likely to flex. Not only does that help reduce squeaks, it\n\nenables the suspension to be tuned to keep noise and vibration out of the\n\ninterior. A fully independent rear suspension improves cornering ability and\n\nenables the ride to be compliant on uneven surfaces. While the ride is not\n\nharsh, it is firm enough to give sporty handling and moderate lean in turns.\n\nElectronic traction control and anti-lock brakes are standard on all V6 models. The traction control system adjusts the engine’s fuel delivery and spark timing for less power when wheel sensors detect unwanted wheelspin.\n\nThe cabin is typical of the cars in this segment: two bucket seats in front and a split-folding bench in back. There was plenty of knee room for me in back, and the fronts are reasonably generous. The leather upholstery in the ES was most appealing.\n\nThe interior layout is much the same as the old 626, which is to say nicely\n\nstyled and easy to use. The woodgrain trim around the center console was a nice touch.\n\nThe ES comes with a long list of standard equipment, including air\n\nconditioning, 6-way power driver’s seat, keyless remote entry, power windows,\n\npower mirrors, cruise control, tilt wheel, power moonroof, 15-inch aluminum\n\nwheels and an AM/FM/CD stereo.\n\nWith this redesign, Mazda moves the 626 closer to its Millenia in everything\n\nbut price. While that may hurt the luxury model, it can’t help but stimulate\n\nsales for the 626.\n\nPrice\n\nThe base price of our test car was $23,995. Freight brought the sticker\n\nprice to $24,445.\n\nWarranty\n\nThe basic warranty is for three years or 50,000 miles.\n\n> Vehicles for The Star’s week-long test drives are supplied by the auto manufacturers.\n\nPoint: Mazda’s redesign of the 626 shows it can offer luxury-car looks at family-sedan prices. The top-line ES is both sporty and luxurious.\n\nCounterpoint: While the 5-speed transmission adds some excitement to the\n\ndriving experience, an automatic would make the ES quieter and smoother.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\n\nENGINE: 2.5-liter, V6\n\nTRANSMISSION: 5-speed\n\nWHEELBASE: 105.1 inches\n\nCURB WEIGHT: n\n\nBASE PRICE: $23,995\n\nPRICE AS DRIVEN: $24,445\n\nMPG RATING: 21 city, 27 hwy.",

      "expert_review": "Mazda, once so close to becoming a major player in the U.S. market, is in a serious funk.\n\nSales are in a tailspin – down 16 percent this year. And recently the Japanese automaker cut the slow-selling 323, 929, MX-3 and RX-7 from its lineup.\n\nFord, which just bought a controlling interest in Mazda, has dispatched a cadre of executives to Japan to try and sort out the mess.\n\nBecause Mazda builds so few cars in North America, it has been unable to shield itself against the plunging value of the dollar. Only Mazda’s MX-6 and 626 are built in the United States. All other Mazdas come from Japan, or in the case of the B-series pickups, are built by Ford and re-badged as Mazdas.\n\nDespite the company’s having more problems than an algebra book, the quality of Mazda’s vehicles has not been affected by the corporate turmoil.\n\nI’ve recently tested two Mazdas, an MPV minivan and this week’s 626 LX V-6. Both were excellent but somewhat pricey vehicles.\n\nIf you don’t mind paying a small premium for a sporty well-equipped compact sedan, I suggest testing the 626 LX. It’s a very credible alternative to the Honda Accord V-6, Toyota Camry and Nissan Maxima.\n\nPERFORMANCE, HANDLING\n\nMazda’s 626 is available with a 114-horsepower, four-cylinder engine in DX and LX models and a 2.5-liter, 24-valve V-6 in LX V-6 and ES models.\n\nOur dark green test car sported the V-6, a double-overhead cam unit that delivers terrific performance and decent fuel economy.\n\nThe V-6 makes 160 horsepower and provides snappy acceleration at low speeds and good power to pass slow traffic. It is a supremely smooth and quiet engine. Unfortunately, the automatic transmission connected to it doesn’t offer the same refinement.\n\nThe four-speed automatic in our test car shifted roughly at times, such as when I slowed from 30 mph to 15 mph and then accelerated again. At other times the transmission hunted for the proper gear; sometimes it didn’t know whether to shift up or down. I would like the 626 better with the five-speed manual. Not only would it be more fun to drive with a stick shift, but the five-speed would chop $800 from the price.\n\nI logged about 350 miles in the week I had the car. In the city, the 626 delivered 22 mpg gallon; on the highway fuel mileage averaged 27 mpg. The 15-gallon fuel tank ensured long distances between fill-ups.\n\nThe 626, which is outfitted with four-wheel independent suspension, is a comfortable and enjoyable car to drive. Expect a somewhat firm and sporty ride. Though the 626 is no BMW, it can handle quick turns and fast cornering with a lot of poise. The power-assisted rack-and-pinion steering system is nicely weighted and has a very crisp feel. And the four-wheel anti-lock disc brakes do a nice job of stopping the car quickly.\n\nHowever, if you drive over many moderate bumps in quick succession, you’ll hear the suspension system make a slight thumping noise as the struts move up and down. Also, road noise tends to find its way into the cabin during driving on coarsely paved roads.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nOur test car struck me as a classy, upscale sedan. For 1996, Mazda has redesigned the 626’s front to resemble its stylish Millenia luxury car.\n\nThe LX V-6 comes nicely equipped. The test car had an alarm system, a power sunroof, remote control door locks, power mirrors that are heated, power windows, cruise control and a power driver’s seat. A CD player is about the only accessory it did not have.\n\nRegardless of where you sit in the 626, you’ll probably be very comfortable. There’s plenty of room in the front and rear, and the seats offer generous padding and support. The rear seats slip and fold forward so that large items can be stored in the car with the trunk closed.\n\nSpeaking of the trunk, the 626 must have one of the largest trunks of any car in its class. And it’s easy to load and unload items, because the trunk lid extends to the bumper.\n\nThe dash is cleanly designed and sensibly arranged, with the all buttons and switches easy to reach and use.\n\nOur test car had one minor but annoying problem: A loud creaking came from the area near where the driver’s seat belt connected to the side of the car.\n\nThe 626 costs more than domestic competitors such as the Ford Contour, Mercury Mystique, Dodge Cirrus, Chrysler Stratus and Plymouth Breeze. However, if it is priced competitively against other foreign cars, such as the Honda Accord V-6.\n\nSpecifications:\n\n1996 Mazda 626\n\nVEHICLE LENGTH Overall 184.4\n\nFRONT COMPARTMENT Headroom 38.2 Legroom 43.5\n\nREAR COMPARTMENT Headroom 37.2 Legroom 35.8\n\nWARRANTY Three-year, 50,000-mile, no-deductible bumper-to-bumper warranty; five-year, unlimited mileage rust protection.\n\nMECHANICAL Drivetrain layout: Transverse-mounted front engine/transaxle, front-wheel drive. Brakes: Power-assisted four-wheel disc with ABS. Engine: 160-horsepower, DOHC 2.5-liter V-6 with 24 valves. Transmission: Four-speed automatic.\n\nOTHER MODELS DX $15,495 LX $17,695 ES $22,795\n\nTruett’s tip: Truett’s tip: Mazda’s 626 LX is a well-made midsize sedan that offers good performance and sporty handling.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nA redesign of Mazdas midsize, front-drive, four-door sedan could arrive for the 2003 model year  possibly as a larger model and accompanied by a wagon. The 626 has few changes for 2002; it carries on with a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine or a 2.5-liter V-6 and comes with either a manual or automatic transmission. Sales of the 626 dropped by 18 percent during 2000.\n\nFord owns a controlling interest in Mazda, and the 626 is built at a plant near Detroit that the two companies share. Designed in Japan, the sedan uses Mazda engines, and its front-drive platform also serves as the basis for the compact Mazda Tribute and Ford Escape sport utility vehicles. The 626 was last redesigned for the 1998 model year, when it reached true midsize proportions at that time.\n\nExterior\nWith a wheelbase that stretches to just over 105 inches, the 626 sedan measures 187.4 inches long overall  just slightly shorter than the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry. The 626 is 69.3 inches wide and 55.1 inches tall.\n\nInterior\nSeating five occupants, the 626 has front buckets and a three-place rear bench with a split, folding rear seatback. Cloth upholstery goes into the base LX sedan, but leather is standard in the upscale ES. Standard equipment includes air conditioning, remote keyless entry and a CD player. The security system has an immobilizing feature that activates if the wrong key is used in the ignition.\n\nUnder the Hood\nMazdas standard 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine produces 125 horsepower, and the optional 2.5-liter V-6 develops 165 hp. Both engines drive either a four-speed-automatic or five-speed-manual transmission. Antilock brakes and side-impact airbags for the front seats are available in an option group for all models.\n\nDriving Impressions\nThe 626 has a mildly sporty nature. It has a comfortable ride but securely hugs the pavement. The tires will squeal if the car is pushed too hard in curves, but otherwise, it behaves nicely on the road. The 626 is easy to drive and has an excellent steering feel.\n\nWhether the 626 is powered by the four-cylinder or V-6 engine, acceleration is livelier with the manual shift, which is no surprise. When this car is equipped with the automatic transmission and four-cylinder power plant, forward motion tends to ease a bit as the gears change. The automatic may occasionally shift with a bit of a lurch, but it functions properly most of the time. Seats are comfortable and supportive, and instruments are excellent. The 626 is an inviting automobile in most respects.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2002 Buying Guide",
