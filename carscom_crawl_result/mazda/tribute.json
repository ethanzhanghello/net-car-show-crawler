      "expert_review": "As a kid, I remember arguing with friends about how it was possible that Superman could disguise himself by wearing glasses and a suit. How could people miss that Clark Kent looked an awful lot like the Man of Steel?\n\nThe same goes for the auto industry.\n\nFor years, automakers have been making the same car with subtle variations &#151; making them into two different models from the same DNA.\n\nRecently, I drove two newer models that have sprouted from other model’s DNA. Here’s a look at them.\n\nPontiac Vibe\n\nLike the Superman villain Bizarro (who looked somewhat like Superman, but in fact was a bizarre opposite), some might consider Pontiac’s Vibe, with its expressive styling, to be the Bizarro version of the tamer-styled Toyota Matrix.\n\nBoth vehicles are five-door hatchbacks that compete with the Ford Focus, Chrysler PT Cruiser, Volkswagen Golf and Protege5. These practical, yet fun-to-drive hatches all offer a fair amount of style and handling that enhance their utilitarian purpose.\n\nThe Pontiac, like its Toyota cousin, is based on a Corolla platform and uses the same 1.8-liter double-overhead-cam in-line-four that powers the Toyota Matrix and Corolla.\n\nThe Pontiac also has an identical model line-up, with two front-wheel-drive models (130-horsepower base and 180-horsepower GT) and an all-wheel-drive model (strangely, only 123-horsepower) for inclement weather. The front-wheel-drive models can be equipped with either a four-speed automatic or five-speed manual transmission (six-speed on the GT), the all-wheel-drive model comes only with the automatic.\n\nThe interior of the Pontiac is identical to the Toyota as well, with the same excellent level of fit and finish.\n\nThe biggest difference between the Toyota and the Pontiac is the styling. The Pontiac has a much more aggressive look in the Pontiac idiom. Whether that suits is a personal choice. But if you use a roof rack a lot, you may opt for the Pontiac because it is standard equipment.\n\nHaving sampled an all-wheel-drive Toyota Matrix, I settled for a front-wheel-drive Vibe. The car’s handling was exemplary and predictable. It was outstanding at delivering a good ride, with only large craters evident.\n\nCornering grip was excellent as well, making the all-wheel-drive almost unnecessary. While the Vibe wasn’t as much fun to drive as a Ford Focus, it still proved quite agile. Road, tire and engine noise were well-suppressed. The front-wheel-drive version feels a lot more peppy than its all-wheel-drive cousin, but it still needs to be worked to extract power on hills.\n\nAs a hatchback, the seats folded, even the front passenger’s seat, to enable one to carry long objects. It was an easy car to love.\n\nThis was reinforced at the gas pump, where gas mileage was more than 32 mpg.\n\nBottom line was a tad over $19,000. Expect to pay another grand for the all-wheel-drive. That’s a real value compared to most SUVs or Crossover Utility Vehicles that offer similar function at higher prices.\n\nLike its Toyota twin, this Pontiac sends out good vibes.\n\nMazda Tribute\n\nMazda has spent a lot money trying to tell you that its Mazda Tribute is an SUV with the soul of a sports car and faster than a speeding bullet. Actually, the Tribute’s family lineage has more to do with Mazda’s owners, Ford, than anything coming from the company that pioneered the rotary engine.\n\nThe fact is the Tribute shares its DNA not with the upcoming RX8 sports car, but with the Ford Escape.\n\nThere are three trim levels, DX, LX and ES. A 130-horsepower four-cylinder engine is standard on all models, with a 3-liter 200-horsepower V-6 available on LX and ES models. Front-wheel-drive or all-wheel-drive models are available. The Mazda competes with such models as the Honda CRV, Toyota RAV4 and new Saturn Vue.\n\nhese cars all start life as car platforms, yet they’re clothed in SUV accoutrements. All-wheel-drive is available, yet it lacks a low-range gear and other items essential for true off-roading. The Mazda is more for those who fear foul weather.\n\nStill, the Tribute is a tribute to both Ford and Mazda engineers. Visual differences between the Escape and Tribute are relatively minor and easy to miss. The interior shares the somewhat spartan feel of the Ford Escape, but the Tribute also shares the Escape’s handy, utilitarian size.\n\nThe 3-liter V-6 and all-wheel-drive proved to be powerful, much more so than its Asian competitors. The Tribute’s handling is tuned to be a bit sportier than its Ford cousin, with a firmer response over bumps. The all-wheel-drive system worked invisibly.\n\nAll the essentials were there as well, with folding rear seats, power driver’s seat, an AM/FM cassette/6-CD audio system along with leather and the usual power goodies.\n\nIt all came in at around $25,000. Not bad for so much utility.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt never really mattered why people couldn’t see that Clark Kent was Superman. Being a kid, I still loved reading Superman comics. The entertainment value is what mattered.\n\nWhether you can distinguish the Vibe from the Matrix or the Tribute from the Escape doesn’t really matter either. If you like one, you might like the other. If there’s something that bothers you on one vehicle, it may be absent on the other. But being clones, each set shares the other’s core value as a vehicle.\n\nNow if you’ll excuse me, I have to see how Superman’s latest battle with Lex Luthor ends.",

      "expert_review": "Mazda. Mmmmmmmazda. Maz-Daaaaa! What do I think of when someone says Mazda? What does Mazda evoke? I can remember jingles, catch phrases, mottos, logos, and the images the cars project. I like to think this is not indicative of my moldable, mushy brain, but rather my awareness of marketing tactics. In any case, instead of remembering “Zoom-Zoom,” like Mazda currently wants me to, I usually remember that Mazda marketing jingle from my youth. You know the one, don’t you? “Sakes alive, sakes alive, the Mazda something something for just fifty-seven ninety-fiiiiiive!” I want Zoom-Zoom because the song is better, but Sakes Alive just sticks. Anyway, I look to the 2006 Mazda Tribute to get me back on board with Zoom-Zoom, and to plant an image in my head about Mazda in general.\n\nThe Tribute is a small, good-looking-yet-not-remarkable SUV. Two Latch connectors, three tethers, airbags, side curtain airbags, cruise control, A/C, 6-CD in-dash changer, fog lamps, and power windows, locks and seats. It has what I need. I can only fit two kids in child car seats back there, though. The black and grey marbled interior trim is a little um … cheap-looking. But the dash and the rest of the compartments are pretty clean and make up for this digression in aesthetics. It’s comfortable, basic, and I start to enjoy my Mazda test-drive.\n\nWhy? Well, it’s because I don’t bonk my head or my kids’ heads on the door when I put them in their car seats; because my children can look out the window, and enjoy being “so much up high!” as my son puts it; because the cupholders are good for all sizes of beverages, even though I think they should be relocated in front of the gearshift, rather than behind it so I don’t whack the beverages when using the gearshift. I also like the general overall interior size. It is car-ish inside, allowing me to reach the kids if I need to, or my purse on the passenger seat. I don’t feel like I’m driving the Mazda Gigantor (not a real car), or filling it up at the pump. And the headrests are comfortable even when my hair’s up. It’s such a girl thing, but I’m a mom and my hair is up 97% of the time.\n\nHere’s the hitch. I want to have my cake and eat it too. I want a small SUV but maybe just a little bit bigger than the Tribute. I’d love a place for my purse. I’d love bigger, better storage compartments. There are little ones in the driver and passenger doors, but none in the back. No cup holders in the back. The small glove box has room for the manual but not much else. The cargo space fits my stroller just fine, but it’s a bit daunting to do a big grocery trip because I have to stack all the bags on top of the stroller for them to fit. I hate rebagging my groceries when I get home. I guess I could put the stroller up on its side, but then it falls over and mashes the bananas. Just a little bit more space, just a couple inches to turn my stroller the long way to make room for other stuff, and we’re golden.\n\nAnd hey, what about visibility? It’s got a big blind spot in the front corners that I have to get used to. There are big handles there that are odd and annoying. One could use them to get in, I suppose. I don’t think the Tribute is big enough to merit the use of these handles. Certainly they’re not there to replace the dry-cleaning hooks that don’t exist in the rest of the car. To the back, I can’t see anything close to the vehicle. With three headrests, the bulky defrost tape on the window, two tethers going up to the roof behind the car seats, and a small window to begin with make the visibility out back like looking through a big spider web.\n\nAs for the Zoom-Zoom part, there’s a bit of it in the 6-cylinder engine, a bit that takes a little coaxing to come out. That’s really all I have to say about it. Sakes alive Mazda, make an impression! It’s a good car, could be better, more mom-friendly. But maybe Mazda’s content. There’s a lot to be said for being content. In spite of its shortcomings I guess I too, am content in the Tribute.\n\n*For more information about the Mazda Tribute and its safety features, visit Cars.com.\n\nLET’S TALK NUMBERS\n\nLATCH Connectors: 2\n\nSeating Capacity (includes driver): 5\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Puny\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair\n\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Some",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nFord owns a controlling interest in Mazda, so theres a close kinship between the popular Ford Escape sport utility vehicle and the related Mazda Tribute. Both SUVs were introduced for the 2001 model year. Subtle styling differences between the two are noticeable, their interior features are not the same, and the Tribute has different suspension settings.\n\nClaimed to be the sportier member of the pair, Mazdas car-based SUV has been attracting considerable interest even if its sales lag well behind the Escape. Both models compete against such rivals as the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4.\n\nNothing has changed for 2004, but an updated Tribute is expected in the spring. The Tribute is available in DX, LX V6 and upscale ES V6 trim levels and with front-wheel drive or four-wheel drive. The Tribute and Escape arent considered to be truly offroad capable.\n\nExterior\nThe Tribute has the same overall shape as the Escape, but the Tribute features unique exterior trim and a different grille, front fascia and headlamps. Both exhibit a conventional small-SUV profile, and their dimensions are similar. The Tribute sits on a 103.1-inch wheelbase and measures 173 inches long overall; thats nearly 7 inches longer than the RAV4. Standing 69.9 inches tall, the four-door Tribute has a rear liftgate that includes a flip-up window. A fully independent suspension and 16-inch tires are installed.\n\nInterior\nThe Tribute carries five people on twin bucket seats up front and a three-place rear seat. The 60/40-split, folding rear seat on the LX and ES models expands cargo room from approximately 17 cubic feet to a more useful 63.9 cubic feet. Leather upholstery and a power drivers seat are standard on the top-of-the-line ES model.\n\nUnder the Hood\nMazda and Ford offer the same powertrain choices for their comparable SUVs. The standard engine in the DX is a 130-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder, and a 200-hp, 3.0-liter V-6 is equipped in all LX and ES models. A five-speed-manual transmission is the sole gearbox available with the four-cylinder engine, while a four-speed automatic teams with the V-6. The Tribute may be equipped with front-wheel drive or a Ford four-wheel-drive system that engages automatically but has no Low-range gearing.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes are standard on the ES and optional on the LX. Side-impact airbags for the front seats are optional on those upper models.\n\nDriving Impressions\nMazdas small SUV creates mixed reactions, but its sporty nature earns the highest marks. The Tribute is noisier than some of its rivals. One example emitted a low growl from its driveline while accelerating at low speeds, as if sound insulation was lacking. In addition, a touchy gas pedal made it difficult to start off smoothly.\n\nThe Tributes energetic throttle response is satisfying. Automatic-transmission shifts are barely noticeable, and downshifts for passing and merging come swiftly. The Tribute steers with a somewhat light touch. It handles adeptly but sometimes displays a floating sensation that makes the driver feel less than fully connected to the highway.\n\nRide comfort is pleasing on the highway, but wavy pavement produces substantial up-and-down motion. Coping ably with bumps and holes, the Tribute exhibits no raucous behavior.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com;\nPosted on 8/27/03",

      "expert_review": "It’s easy to overlook the Mazda Tribute, a compact sport-utility vehicle that’s a close cousin to the Ford Escape. In fact, one Mazda vice-president admitted, “No one was waiting for an SUV (to be) introduced by Mazda.”\n\nSo why did we give our $25,475 test vehicle three stars? As we discovered, it’s a pretty decent alternative to those little “cute utes” from Toyota and Honda.\n\nShe: Give me a shopping cart and a charge card and I can test any vehicle.\n\nHe: Or pantsuit, shoes, cosmetics or purse. Geez, the possibilities are endless.\n\nShe: You interrupted. I was beginning to say I took the Tribute over to Bed Bath & Beyond and decided to test its cargo capacity. It was an emergency run because No. 2 Son, my personal reclamation project, was returning to college. I had a hunch his bedding hadn’t been thoroughly washed since 1999, so I was determined to replace everything. An hour later, there I was stashing comforter, towels, bedding and a rug into the back of the Mazda. For a small sport-ute, it holds quite a bit of stuff – at least $300 worth.\n\nHe: Did you have any room left to stash the credit card? Good thing you had the Tribute. Some of those compact SUVs don’t have much room in the cargo bay. I was actually pretty impressed by the cabin in the Mazda. For 25 grand, you get a very fancy leather interior on the Tribute ES, plus lots of extras, including air conditioning, power windows and locks, a power driver’s seat and a CD player. Our test vehicle was a V-6 model with all-wheel drive. The engine is Ford’s twin-cam 3.0-liter six, which makes 200 horsepower and comes with a four-speed automatic transmission. You can’t even get a six-cylinder option on the Honda CR-V or the Toyota RAV4.\n\nShe: Let me get back to the shopping angle. The next day I had the overwhelming urge to go shopping with my mother. So I took the Tribute across town. That’s where I noticed one of its biggest flaws – noise. At highway speeds, the wind noise practically drowns out the stereo. And you also get quite a bit of road and tire noise. But you can’t argue with the Tribute’s styling. That’s definitely one of its strong points. It’s not a clone of the Escape. Ford and Mazda took pains to make sure they are different, even though they share many components and are built on the same assembly line in Kansas City.\n\nHe: One thing that puzzles me. Even though the Tribute supposedly was derived from a passenger car, the Mazda 626, this definitely does not have a soft, car-like ride, which is a strong point of some of the competitors. Instead, it feels more bouncy and trucky, something like the Chevrolet Tracker and Suzuki Vitara, which also play in this price segment. Even the 16-inch wheels and tires didn’t seem to improve the ride much.\n\nShe: You can order some good safety items on the Tribute, but they’ll cost extra. Our test vehicle came equipped with anti-lock brakes and side air bags, which are bundled together in a $495 pa ckage. That meant peace of mind to me. You also get free 24-hour roadside assistance for three years or 36,000 miles. And the gas mileage isn’t as dreadful as some of the big utes. Our Tribute was rated at 18 miles per gallon in the city and 24 miles per gallon on the highway. Translated, that means I was able to bop around Detroit all weekend and not stop once for a fill-up.\n\nHe: I thought our well-equipped Tribute ES was affordably priced at less than $25,500, but we also should mention that you can get a standard Tribute with front-wheel drive, five-speed manual gearbox and a peppy twin-cam four-cylinder engine that makes 130 horsepower. Prices start at under $18,000.\n\nShe: You know, I just got back from driving the 2002 Honda CR-V. I love this category of sport-ute because they are so easy and enjoyable to drive and park. Not intimidating at all. I think it will appeal to families who want the practicality of an SUV, but are looking for something that is easy to operat nd looks stylish.\n\nHe: Just one question. Where did you shop in the CR-V and how much did you spend?\n\n2001 Mazda Tribute ES\n\nAnita’s rating: Above average\n\nPaul’s rating: Above average\n\nLikes: More distinctive styling than Ford Escape. Available V-6 option. Side air bags are available. Decent gas mileage. Alternative to “cute utes” from Honda, Toyota.\n\nDislikes: Bouncy, trucklike ride. No lighted vanity mirrors (Anita).

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nFord owns a controlling interest in Mazda, so there’s a close kinship between the popular Ford Escape sport utility vehicle and the related Mazda Tribute. Both SUVs were introduced for the 2001 model year and upgraded for 2005. When comparing the two SUVs, there are subtle styling differences, unique interior features in each and different suspension tuning.\n\nServing as the sportier member of the pair, the car-based Tribute attracts considerable interest even if its sales lag well behind the Escape’s. Both models compete against the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4.\n\nNew Tribute i and s trim levels replace the previous DX, LX and ES for 2005. A new 2.3-liter four-cylinder in i models produces 153 horsepower, versus 130 hp in the prior version. For the first time, four-cylinder models can be equipped with an automatic transmission. Front-wheel drive and four-wheel drive are available, but the Tribute and Escape aren’t considered true offroad machines. Mazda says the new Active Torque Control Coupling four-wheel-drive system reacts faster than a hydraulic unit.\n\nExterior\nThe Tribute has the same overall shape as the Escape but features unique exterior trim and a different grille and headlamps that were redesigned for 2005. Both SUVs exhibit a conventional small-SUV profile, with similar dimensions. A new rear fascia features vertical taillights, and redesigned alloy wheels hold 16-inch tires. The rear liftgate has flip-up glass.\n\nTributes ride a 103.1-inch wheelbase and measure 174.4 inches long overall. Standing 69.9 inches tall when the roof rails are counted, the four-door Tribute has a fully independent suspension.\n\nInterior\nThe Tribute carries five people on twin bucket seats up front and a three-place, 60/40-split, folding rear seat. Tributes now have a floor-mounted gearshift rather than a column lever. The standard 100-watt CD stereo is Sirius Satellite Radio-ready. Leather upholstery, heated front seats and side mirrors, and a power driver’s seat are optional.\n\nUnder the Hood\nTribute i models get a new 153-hp, 2.3-liter four-cylinder. A 200-hp, 3.0-liter V-6 goes into s models. The four-cylinder teams with a four-speed-automatic transmission or a five-speed manual, while the V-6 is available only with the automatic. Tributes may be equipped with front-wheel drive or a new four-wheel-drive system that engages automatically but has no low-range gearing.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes are standard and have electronic brake-force distribution and brake assist. Side curtain-type airbags are optional on s models.\n\nDriving Impressions\nIn its previous form, the Tribute drew mixed reactions, but its sporty nature earned high marks. Tributes are quieter than they used to be, and energetic V-6 throttle response is satisfying. Automatic-transmission shifts are barely noticeable, and downshifts for passing and merging come swiftly.\n\nThe Tribute steers with a somewhat light touch and handles adeptly. Occasionally, a floating sensation makes the driver feel less than fully connected to the highway.\n\nRide comfort is pleasing, but wavy pavement produces substantial up-and-down motion. The Tribute exhibits no raucous behavior and copes handily with bumps and holes.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nFord owns a controlling interest in Mazda, which accounts for the close kinship between the popular Ford Escape sport utility vehicle and the related Mazda Tribute. Both SUVs were introduced for the 2001 model year. Subtle styling differences can be seen between the two, and interior features are not identical.\n\nClaimed to be the sportier member of the pair, Mazdas car-based SUV has been attracting considerable interest. Available with front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive, the Tribute exhibits a conventional SUV profile. Changes for 2002 are minimal, apart from a reshaped gearshift lever, wiper-control stalk and the addition of a modular audio system. New front seats have separate, adjustable head restraints, and rub strips have been deleted from the Tributes roof rack.\n\nJointly developed by the two companies, the SUV is based on the front-drive platform of Mazdas 626 sedan but is powered by Ford engines. Like the Escape, the Tribute is designed to lure buyers out of cars by offering the look of an SUV with carlike driving ease and the security of four-wheel drive. Neither model is considered to offer true offroad capability.\n\nExterior\nThough it has the same overall shape as the Escape, Mazdas Tribute features a different grille, front fascia and headlamps, as well as unique exterior trim. Dimensions also are similar. The Tribute sits on a 103.1-inch wheelbase and has an overall length of 173 inches  8 inches longer than the Toyota RAV4. The four-door SUV has a rear liftgate that includes a flip-up window.\n\nInterior\nThe Tribute carries five occupants with twin bucket seats up front and a three-place seat in the rear. The folding rear seat on the LX and ES models expands cargo room from 17 cubic feet to a more useful 70 cubic feet. Leather upholstery and a power drivers seat are standard on the top-of-the-line ES.\n\nUnder the Hood\nMazda offers the same powertrain choices as those of the Escape. The base engine is a 2.0-liter four-cylinder that makes 130 horsepower, while a 200-hp, 3.0-liter V-6 is optional. Only a five-speed-manual transmission is available with the four-cylinder engine, while a four-speed-automatic gearbox is used with the V-6. The Tribute can have front-wheel drive or a Ford four-wheel-drive system that engages automatically. Antilock brakes and side-impact airbags for the front seats are optional.\n\nDriving Impressions\nMazdas small SUV gets a mixed reaction, with its sporty nature earning the highest marks. Although its related to the Escape, more flaws surfaced while driving the Tribute than its Ford cousin. Noisier than some rivals, a test Tribute emitted a low growl from its driveline while accelerating at low speeds, as if sound insulation was lacking. Additionally, a touchy gas pedal made it difficult to start off with a smooth acceleration.\n\nEnergetic and overly eager, the throttle response is satisfying, automatic-transmission shifts are barely noticeable, and downshifts for passing and merging come swiftly. Steering with a somewhat light touch, the Tribute displays a floating sensation at times, feeling less than fully connected to the highway surface. Ride comfort is pleasing on the highway, but wavy pavement produces a lot of up-and-down motion. Around town, the Tribute aptly copes with bumps and holes and exhibits no raucous behavior.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2002 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe Mazda Tribute, a sibling to the Mercury Mariner and Ford Escape, got a significant exterior and interior face-lift for 2008. For 2009, Mazda made a slew of mechanical changes designed to improve performance and efficiency, including new four-cylinder and V-6 engines. For 2011, Mazda says the Tribute carries over largely unchanged. Sport, Touring and Grand Touring trim levels are offered. A hybrid model is listed separately in the Cars.com Research section. The Tribute seats five, and its competitors include the Toyota RAV4, Honda CR-V and Chevrolet Equinox.\n\nNew for 2011\nThere are no significant changes.\n\nExterior\nUnlike many other Mazda vehicles, the Tribute does not get a large grille that makes the front of the car look like it is smiling. This is owed partially to the more blocky styling of the Tribute. Exterior features include:\n\n\nStandard 16-inch aluminum-alloy wheels\nStandard fog lights\nStandard power mirrors\nStandard automatic headlights\nOptional heated mirrors\nOptional power moonroof\n\nInterior\nThe Tribute has seating for five and a 60/40-split folding rear seat. The rear window opens independent of the liftgate. Interior features include:\n\n\nStandard air conditioning\nStandard cruise control\nStandard power windows and locks\nCloth- or leather-trimmed seating\nAvailable heated front seats\nAvailable satellite radio\n\nUnder the Hood\nTribute buyers get the choice of a four-cylinder or V-6 engine. A manual transmission is standard on the base model, and other models come with a six-speed automatic transmission, which is available on the base model. Mechanical features include:\n\n\n171-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder with 171 pounds-feet of torque\n240-hp, 3.0-liter V-6 with 223 pounds-feet of torque\nFive-speed manual transmission\nOptional six-speed automatic transmission\nFront- or all-wheel drive\n\nSafety\nSafety equipment includes:\n\n\nStandard front, side-impact and side curtain airbags\nStandard antilock braking system with electronic brake-force distribution\nStandard electronic stability system",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nJust as its Ford Escape brethren got a new look, the Mazda Tribute has received some styling tweaks, including a new grille and interior, plus a rear window that now looks more like the Escape’s.\n\nExterior\nThe outside of the Tribute didn’t get as much of a face-lift as did the Escape. The grille lost its crossbar, and the Mazda logo has moved up, while the headlights and taillights are new. Fog lights are standard. The windows taper and ascend toward the rear, in line with what many smaller SUVs are doing these days.\n\nInterior\nThe Tribute still has seating for five, and there’s a center console storage compartment that Mazda says is big enough to hold a laptop. The rear seat is split 60/40, and the Tribute has just shy of 30 cubic feet of storage space with the backseat up; it’s 66 cubic feet with them down. The rear window opens independent of the liftgate if you just need to toss your stuff into the back. There’s an optional rear-seat DVD entertainment system.\n\nUnder the Hood\nTribute buyers get the choice of two engines, a 153-horsepower, 2.3-liter four-cylinder or a 200-hp, 3.0-liter V-6. The base Tribute comes with a choice of five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmissions. Upper trim levels, including all V-6 models, come with the automatic transmission standard. Two-wheel drive is standard, but all-wheel drive is optional on all trim levels.\n\nSafety\nElectronic stability and roll mitigation systems are standard. The Tribute also gets front airbags that can sense the weight of occupants and how far the driver is sitting from the steering wheel, allowing the airbags to deploy with the appropriate amount of force. The Tribute’s standard side airbags are built into the seats, not the doors, to better protect occupants no matter where the seat is, Mazda says. Side curtain airbags and antilock brakes are standard.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe Mazda Tribute, a sibling to the Mercury Mariner and Ford Escape, got a significant exterior and interior face-lift for 2008. For 2009, Mazda makes a slew of mechanical changes that could improve performance and efficiency. New inline-four-cylinder and V-6 engines are available in the Sport, Touring and Grand Touring trim levels; a hybrid model is listed elsewhere in the Cars.com Research section. The Tribute seats five, and its competitors include the Toyota RAV4, Honda CR-V and Saturn Vue.\n\nNew for 2009\nThe Tribute receives new four-cylinder and V-6 engines, a new six-speed automatic transmission, and redesigned front and rear seats.\n\nExterior\nThe outside of the Tribute didn’t get as dramatic a face-lift as the Escape did for 2008. The grille lost its crossbar and the Mazda logo was moved up. The 2009 Tribute gets a capless refueling system that’s supposed to make refueling easier. It’s 174.9 inches long, which is shorter than its competitors, and 71.1 inches wide, about the same as the RAV4, CR-V and Vue.\n\nStandard 16-inch aluminum-alloy wheels\nStandard fog lights\nStandard power mirrors\nStandard automatic headlights\nOptional heated mirrors (standard on Grand Touring)\nOptional power moonroof (standard on Grand Touring)\n\nInterior\nThe Tribute has seating for five, and there’s about 99 cubic feet of passenger space, which is less than the RAV4 and CR-V but more than the Vue. The Tribute has a 60/40-split folding rear seat. With the rear seat up, the Tribute has nearly 30 cubic feet of storage space, equal to the Vue but less than the RAV-4 and CR-V. When the rear seat is down, cargo space increases to 66 cubic feet. The rear window opens independent of the liftgate.\n\nStandard air conditioning\nStandard cruise control\nStandard power windows and locks\nAvailable cloth- or leather-trimmed seating\nAvailable heated front seats (standard on Grand Touring)\nAvailable satellite radio (standard on Grand Touring)\n\nUnder the Hood\nTribute buyers get the choice of two engines, both of which have been upgraded. A manual transmission is standard on the base model, and other models come with a standard six-speed automatic transmission, which is available on the base model.\n\n171-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder with 171 pounds-feet of torque\n240-hp, 3.0-liter V-6 with 223 pounds-feet of torque\nFive-speed manual transmission (base)\nSix-speed automatic transmission\nFront- or all-wheel drive\n\nSafety\nSafety equipment includes:\n\nStandard front, side-impact and side curtain airbags\nStandard antilock braking system with electronic brake force distribution\nStandard electronic stability system",
