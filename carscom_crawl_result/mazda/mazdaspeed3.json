      "expert_review": "The 2010 Mazdaspeed3 appears to be a viable family car since it comes with a backseat, but this compact hatchback should come with a disclaimer: must be at least 42 inches tall and 55 pounds to ride in this ride. This compact car works well for families with older kids who are out of bulky , rear-facing child-safety seats.\n\nDriving the Speed3 felt like taming a wild beast, which isn’t a bad thing.  The turbocharged engine was the most powerful turbo I’ve tested. Ever.  An LED turbo-boost gauge on the dash showed when the turbo was winding up for its pitch; once it let loose, the car may as well have been launched from a catapult!  Pair this power with the fuel-efficient six-speed manual transmission and you’ve got quite the machine.\n\nI loved being seen in this performance version of the Mazda3, even though it moved so fast that it would’ve been hard for other drivers to get a good look at it. Slow down, you say?  No can do, my friends. It’s just not possible to go less than 35 mph without the Speed3 feeling like it was about to explode.  I was proud of myself for not getting a speeding ticket during my weeklong test drive.  After a couple of days trying to keep the Speed3 within the speed limit, I simply gave up. Pick your battles.\n\nThe Mazdaspeed3 starts at $23,000. My test model, a Mazdaspeed3 Sport,  had a navigation system, push-button start, Bluetooth hands-free phone and audio, in-dash six CD changer, upgraded Bose surround-sound system, and that mind-blowing turbo four-cylinder for a mere $26,025.  How’d they do that?\n \nEXTERIOR\nThree words: Velocity Red Mica.  Even the Mazdaspeed3’s color name is speedy and ferocious. This is one good-looking car, with curves protruding from every angle.  With a grille that looked more like the gills of shark than a smile and sharp headlights that reminded me of fangs, the Speed3’s aggressive looks were as attractive as that bad boy you adored when you were 17. Oh, and don’t get me started on the hood scoop.\n\nEven loaded with four kids, the Mazdaspeed3 helped me forget about my mommy moniker and reminded me to live a little. What other car can do that?  It was like the vehicular equivalent of the little devil on your shoulder, C’mon, just hit the gas a little more.  It’s fun. What could it hurt?\n\nThe kids also adored this car thanks to its cool factor.  I liked that they were able to get in and out of it and buckle up all by themselves.\n\nHowever, loading items into the cargo space was difficult.  Floor space is adequate in the trunk, but the height is limited due to a cargo cover that can’t easily be removed.  Grocery bags fit fine, but awkwardly shaped items like strollers or small bikes will cause more headaches than they’re worth.\n\nWhile enjoying the 263-horsepower, 2.3-liter inline-four-cylinder, it seemed like the Mazdaspeed3 didn’t use any gas at all. After doing a little math, however, it looks like I averaged 20.75 mpg. The EPA estimates the Speed3’s fuel economy at 18/25 mpg city/highway. Despite the fancy turbo engine, the Speed3 accepts regular gas.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair \nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Groove On\n\nINTERIOR\n\nJust as sassy inside as it is on the outside, I was relieved to find the Speed3’s interior was also ergonomic, intuitive and simple.  There was no guesswork needed for changing the radio station or pumping up the air conditioning. \n\nI was impressed that my $26,000 test car had a navigation system, which is optional and part of the Tech Package ($1,895). That and push-button start were both unexpected pluses to Speed3’s interior.\n\nHowever, the seats were less than luxurious and allowed only slight manual adjustments. The gearshift was tall, skinny and awkward to use. I kept thinking it would’ve been easier to maneuver if it were shorter.\n\nIn the backseat, the kids had two cupholders in the center armrest. Many sport models are too cool for cupholders, so I was pleasantly surprised to see them in Speed3.\n\nLegroom for both the first and second rows was decent and what I expected for a compact car. Nobody in the second row complained about being cramped even when we had three passengers buckled in back there. The Mazdaspeed3 has a seating capacity for five, which is how many we had in it during most of the test drive and everyone fit just fine. More importantly, nobody kicked my seat, so there was enough legroom in the backseat to let their little legs dangle. \n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\nSAFETY\nThe Speed3 makes an excellent case for parents out there looking for affordable fun without sacrificing safety. My husband and I loved the feisty personality and hot looks the Speed3 brought to the table.  The fact that it all came with a backseat seemed like an added bonus.\n\nThe Mazdaspeed3’s two sets of lower Latch anchors are easy to access. My boys’ booster seats fit well in the backseat, and a forward-facing convertible would fit well, too. However, parents using rear-facing car seats might have some difficulty fitting them in the rear seat, especially if the front passengers are on the tall side.\n\nThe Mazdaspeed3 comes with the following safety features standard: four-wheel-disc antilock brakes with brake assist, stability control, traction control and six airbags, including side-impact airbags in the front row and side curtains for both rows.\n\nGet more safety information on the 2010 Mazdaspeed3 here.",

      "expert_review": "In a field that’s exposing also-rans at a torrid pace, the 2011 Mazda3 compact sedan and hatchback still shine.\n\nThe popular Mazda3 remains unabashedly fun to drive, which should appeal to driving enthusiasts who want a practical car. And although it falls short on ride quality and fuel efficiency, the latter is set to improve with next year’s four-cylinder drivetrain, which should get 40 mpg highway.\n\nMazda offers three drivetrains: two normally aspirated four-cylinders — each with a manual or automatic transmission — and a manual-only Mazdaspeed3 hatchback with a turbocharged four-cylinder. (Click here to stack them up.) Since the Mazda3 was redesigned a year ago, we’ve driven all three engines. A newly standard electronic stability system is the chief difference for the 2011 car.\n\nHandling\nEver since its late-2003 launch, the Mazda3 has held platinum membership in the fun-to-drive-econobox club — a group that has included, at times, only a handful of peers: the Ford Focus, the Honda Civic and the Volkswagen Jetta. A few more have joined the ranks recently, but the Mazda3 remains at the head. Few sub-$20,000 cars achieve such harmony across the driving experience. Steering turn-in is precise, allowing for quick darts from one lane to the next. At low speeds, our 2.5-liter test car’s wheel felt both light and lively — better than last year’s 2.0-liter Mazda3, whose wheel could have used more low-speed power assist. Regardless of body style, the car’s 34.2-foot turning circle beats much of the field.\n\nEditors raved about the Mazda’s high-speed handling; in our review of last year’s Mazda3, which involved some time on Wisconsin’s Road America racetrack, one editor lauded the car’s go-kart-like manners. If there’s any criticism, it comes with the Mazdaspeed3. I was unimpressed: The steering — which has the same ratio but less power assist — tracks well, but the car’s nose pushes relentlessly on sweeping curves, and our tester’s Dunlop SP Sport P225/40R18 summer tires ceded grip sooner than high-performance rubber ought to. The Mini Cooper S is more driftable, as go-fast hatches go. Though I offered repeated invites, the Mazdaspeed3’s rear was loathe to dance.\n\nGoing & Stopping\nThe base four-cylinder’s power is comparable with many other compacts — perhaps even a smidge better than some, given the optional five-speed automatic upshifts smoothly and the gear ratios are well-spaced for quick 60-to-70 mph passing. Kickdown, however, could be a bit swifter.\n\nIf you’re looking to move away from intersections a bit more quickly, consider trading the 148-horsepower four-cylinder for the 167-hp four. It’s optional in the sedan and standard in the hatchback. It packs a gratifying — and palpably stronger — amount of acceleration, thanks in large part to 33 extra pounds-feet of torque. Beware, though: You’ll sacrifice 2-5 mpg overall, depending on which transmission you choose.\n\nThe Mazdaspeed3 comes only with a six-speed manual. Like the stick shift in the normally aspirated car, it has longish throws but a short, satisfyingly hefty shifter. The car’s turbocharged four-cylinder feels a bit old-school, with noticeable turbo lag followed by a sudden, peaky stretch of power. The burst thrusts the car forward and kicks the tachometer needle to its 6,700-rpm redline at breakneck speed. Driving hard, you’ll have to upshift too often to savor the climb. For its sub-$24,000 price, the Mazdaspeed3 is stunningly quick — our friends at “MotorWeek” hit 60 mph in just 5.2 seconds with theirs — but longer gearing would help drivers enjoy the experience a bit more. So would better mitigation of the car’s torque steer, which becomes a major force on hard takeoffs, but such is the case in most powerful front-drive cars.\n\nThe Mazdaspeed3 has four-wheel-disc antilock brakes, with larger front discs than the regular Mazda3. They offer forceful, linear pedal response, though our test car’s were a bit too touchy when I lifted off to start moving again.\n\nCombined city/highway gas mileage ranges from 21 mpg in the Mazdaspeed3 to 28 mpg in a manual Mazda3 with the base four-cylinder. (As is the case with many high-performance cars, the Mazdaspeed3 needs premium gas.) None of these numbers are particularly good: The Hyundai Elantra, 2012 Civic and 2012 Focus are all better, getting as much as 33 mpg. Armed with a new direct-injection four-cylinder, next year’s Mazda3 should get around 32 mpg overall.\n\nRide Quality\nRide quality marks the latest battleground among small cars, and the Chevrolet Cruze and Elantra are plowing through the competition. The Mazda3 trails both; it’s worth a competitive test-drive to see the difference for yourself. With the Mazda’s 16- or 17-inch wheels, highway expansion joints come and go with a noticeable kathunk, and uneven pavement can leave you in a constant pattern of down/up motions as the car follows each dip and rise. The suspension sorts things out well enough after each bump, with few reverberations as the car resettles itself, but the shock absorbers could stand to soak up a bit more.\n\nDrivetrains Compared\nEngine\t2.0L four-cylinder\t2.5L four-cylinder\t2.3L turbo four-cylinder\nAvailability\tSedan\tSedan, hatchback\tHatchback\nHorsepower (@ rpm)\t148 @ 6,500\t167 @ 6,000\t263 @ 5,500\nTorque (lbs.-ft., @ rpm)\t135 @ 4,500\t168 @ 4,000\t280 @ 3,000\nTransmissions\tFive-speed manual,\nfive-speed automatic\tSix-speed manual,\nfive-speed automatic\tSix-speed manual\nEPA combined MPG\t27 (auto),\n28 (manual)\t25 (auto),\n23 (manual)\t21\nFuel\tRegular\tRegular\tPremium\nSource: Automaker and EPA data\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe Mazdaspeed3 has 18-inch wheels and a performance-tuned suspension. There’s less up-and-down movement on the highway, and the car absorbs mid-corner bumps without becoming skittish. At low speeds, however, the ride is quite choppy. You’ll find yourself driving around ruts and potholes, as they make for a jarring experience.\n\n \n\nWind noise is moderate, though the Mazda3 remains mostly unfazed by highway crosswinds. Road and tire noise, however, are a different story: The sound is always noticeable, and it gets downright loud over some surfaces.\n\nThe Inside\nCabin quality in the Mazda3 is competitive overall, though cars like the Cruze and Elantra have leapfrogged the class. The Mazda’s dashboard panels have upscale textures and padded surfaces; unfortunately, the doors and anything below eye level look considerably cheaper. Still, the windshield and dash slope far forward, giving you a sense of roominess that’s similar to the Civic. Over time, I felt like I was sitting above everything: The cockpit doesn’t wrap around you so much as it’s arrayed before you.\n\nThe Mazda3’s basic cloth seats offer decent lateral support but insufficient shoulder and thigh support, though sport seats improve matters in the 2.5-liter and Mazdaspeed models. Across all our cars, my 5-foot-11 frame could have used another inch or so of rearward adjustment range, like in too many cars in this class.\n\nSuch limitations preserve some backseat room, to be sure — and anyone sitting back there will need it. The legroom dimensions are misleading: There’s an alleged 36.2 inches in both the sedan and hatchback, which would put the Mazda3 near the top of the segment in terms of backseat legroom. In reality, though, it’s snug; the Civic, Kia Forte and Jetta easily trump it.\n\nTrunk volume in the Mazda3 sedan is just 11.8 cubic feet; the Cruze and Jetta offer 15 cubic feet or more. The Mazda3 hatchback offers a more usable 17 cubic feet behind the backseat, with 42.8 cubic feet of maximum volume with the seat folded down. Both figures are competitive among hatchbacks.\n\nSafety, Features & Pricing\nWith top scores in front and side-impact crash tests from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the Mazda3 earned Top Safety Pick status for both hatchback and sedan body styles. Standard safety features include side curtain airbags, antilock brakes and an electronic stability system. (Last year’s Mazda3 sedan lacked a stability system in lower trims.) Click here for a full list of features, or here to see our evaluation of child-safety seating provisions in the hatchback.\n\nReliability for the second-generation Mazda3 has been above average. That’s about even with the segment, which has proved reliable on the whole. The Mazda3 sedan starts at $15,800; it comes standard with power windows and locks, a CD stereo with an auxiliary MP3 jack, and steering-wheel audio controls. Move up the trims, and you can get air conditioning, a moonroof, alloy wheels, heated leather seats and a navigation system. Check all the boxes, and the car can come with adaptive xenon headlights, dual-zone automatic climate control and a power driver’s seat — three features not usually seen in this class. Mazda3 hatchbacks, which come standard with the larger four-cylinder, start at $20,045. That’s $500 more than an equivalently trimmed sedan.\n\nWith all the options checked, the Mazda3 tops out around $26,000. That includes things like Bluetooth audio streaming, but — curiously — no USB/iPod connectivity beyond the basic auxiliary jack.\n\nMazda3 in the Market\nA bumper crop of new competitors — among which the Elantra looks particularly compelling — are making at least one recently redesigned car seem outdated, but not the Mazda3. It’s not the most refined, roomy or fuel-efficient choice, but Mazda still offers driving enthusiasts the most complete compact-car package. Next year’s fuel-efficiency improvements can only raise its standing.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in January 2012 about the 2012 Mazda Mazdaspeed3. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2013, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThanks to new drivetrains, the 2012 Mazda3 has fuel economy ratings as high as 40 mpg on the highway. That’s a big gain over last year that addresses a major shortcoming in the brand’s most popular car. After all, at least five 40-mpg competitors will be on sale by this summer. The bandwagon is unstoppable, and now Mazda has a seat on board.\n\nThe 2012 Mazda3’s refinement issues will linger until the car gets a full redesign, but its driving fun and fuel efficiency keep the car competitive.\n\nThe Mazda3 comes as a sedan or hatchback with four available engines and essentially 11 versions, including the turbocharged Mazdaspeed3. Two trim levels have the suffix “SkyActiv,” which represents high-mileage technology in the form of the company’s newest four-cylinder engine and/or select transmissions and other technologies. As is the case in most competing models, the highest mileage figures come in the more expensive sedan trim levels. The most affordable hatchback is efficient, but the base price for this body style is more than $4,000 higher than the base sedan’s.\n\nIn any configuration, the Mazda’s firm ride will turn off some shoppers, but the mileage makeover breathes new life into a model that has never emphasized efficiency. Click here to compare drivetrains, or here to compare the 2012 Mazda3 with the 2011. We tested a stick-shift 2012 Mazda3 hatchback with the SkyActiv four-cylinder. We’ve driven the other engines in years past.\n\nCapable Power\nThe Mazda3’s two base trims, SV and Sport, retain last year’s 148-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder. It moves well enough, helped by well-spaced gear ratios in the optional five-speed automatic transmission. A five-speed manual is standard.\n\nThe 155-hp, direct-inject SkyActiv engine, also a 2.0-liter four-cylinder, adds a modest 7 hp and — more importantly — 10 percent more passing-lane torque than its port-injected peer. It can be paired with either an automatic or a manual, both with six speeds. The SkyActiv engine comes in handy on the interstate, where our stick-shift test car accelerated 10 mph in 6th gear at a reasonable pace. The base 2.0-liter — and a lot of four-cylinder competitors — needs a downshift in order to speed up on the highway. Around town, the 2.0-liter engines feel similar to each other, except that the SkyActiv’s slow initial accelerator response translates to anemic start-offs. The Mazda3’s optional 2.5-liter four-cylinder has gutsier midrange power that makes it quicker than most commuter cars, if less efficient.\n\nThe SkyActiv sedan is rated an EPA-estimated 28/40 mpg city/highway with the automatic, 27/39 with the stick. The SkyActiv hatchback has identical city numbers but is 1 mpg less efficient on the highway with either transmission. Still, that’s 2 to 7 mpg better than the base 2.0-liter, depending on trim, and 6 to 11 mpg better than the 2.5-liter Mazda3. All three engines use regular gas.\n\nThe Mazdaspeed3 comes only with a stick shift and sports a turbocharged four-cylinder that sprints to extralegal speeds. Its refinement, however, is disappointing. The car’s 263-hp engine feels old-school, with noticeable turbo lag followed by power that’s too peaky to savor. Dig deep into the gas, and the tach needle flies toward its 6,700-rpm redline at breakneck speed. For its $24,000 price, the Mazdaspeed3 is a go-fast bargain — our friends at “MotorWeek” hit 60 mph in it in just 5.2 seconds — but more low-rev torque with longer gearing would help drivers enjoy the experience a bit more. So would addressing the car’s torque steer, which becomes a major force on hard takeoffs. Such is the case in powerful front-drive cars, but some manage it better than this one. The Speed3 requires premium gas and is rated 18/25 mpg.\n\nHandling & Ride\nIn the Mazda3, performance trumps comfort — but the payoff is impressive. Editors enjoyed our test car’s sharp steering and linear braking. The nose pushes in sweeping corners, but the tail breaks free soon after, allowing the driver to manage the car’s rotation. The Mazdaspeed3, in contrast, slings more fun-sapping weight over the front axle, which cuts its drifting potential. Its stickier Dunlop SP Sport P225/40R18 summer tires eventually cede grip up front, but the tail stays put, refusing to let you easily slide on all fours.\n\nThe Mazdaspeed3’s choppy ride can be punishing over potholes, and even the base Mazda3 trims ride firmly. On the highway, crosswinds require constant steering corrections, and the suspension in our 2012 test car lost its cool time and again over broken pavement. Road and wind noise, in contrast, were low; I just wish the suspension were as refined. Competitors like the Chevrolet Cruze and Hyundai Elantra marry ride and handling better. The Mazda still wins for outright fun, but comfort-minded drivers should look elsewhere.\n\nThe Inside\nCabin quality is competitive overall, but cars like the Cruze, Elantra and the forthcoming Dodge Dart are pushing ahead. The Mazda’s dashboard panels have upscale textures and padded surfaces; unfortunately, the doors and anything below eye level look considerably cheaper. Still, most controls are high quality, and the dashboard’s shallow rake leaves the interior feeling roomy.\n\nOur test car’s basic cloth seats felt over-bolstered, leaving my back sore after a few hours behind the wheel. My 5-foot-11 frame could have used another inch or so of rearward travel, too. Such limitations preserve some backseat room, and anyone sitting back there will need it. The Mazda3’s legroom dimensions are misleading: There’s an alleged 36.2 inches in both the sedan and hatchback, which would put it near the top of the segment. In reality, though, it’s snug back there; rear seats in the Dart, Honda Civic, Kia Forte and Volkswagen Jetta feel roomier.\n\nTrunk volume in the Mazda3 sedan is just 11.8 cubic feet; the Cruze and Jetta offer 15 cubic feet or more. The Mazda3 hatchback offers a more usable 17 cubic feet behind the backseat, with 42.8 cubic feet of maximum volume with the backseat folded down. Both figures are competitive among hatchbacks.\n\nSafety, Features & Pricing\nReliability for the Mazda3 has been well above average, and the car scored top marks in all crash tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, earning the car Top Safety Pick status. But the Mazda3’s side-impact scores in the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s revamped side-impact tests returned just three out of five stars. Standard features include six airbags and the required antilock brakes and electronic stability system. Click here for a full list, or here to see our evaluation of child-seat accommodations.\n\nThe Mazda3 sedan comes in six trim levels. The SV and Sport have the base 2.0-liter engine. Touring and Grand Touring trims come with the SkyActiv 2.0-liter, while “s” versions of the Touring and Grand Touring have the 2.5-liter four-cylinder. The hatchback skips the base engine by starting at the Touring trim level, but 2012 marks the first year this body style is offered with a smaller engine — in SkyActiv form — rather than just the 2.5-liter. The Mazdaspeed3, available only as a hatchback, comes in Touring trim. Standard features on the SV sedan include power mirrors and windows, plus a CD stereo with steering-wheel audio controls and an auxiliary MP3 jack. Other trims add power door locks, air conditioning and keyless entry. Load the Mazda3 up, and you can get heated leather seats, Bose audio, dual-zone automatic climate control and a moonroof.\n\nMazda3 in the Market\nWill shoppers buy the new SkyActiv versions of the Mazda3? I think so. The mileage gains are enough to take some of the sting out of the price difference in the sedan, and the engine effectively lowers the price of the hatchback by giving buyers a cheaper alternative to the 2.5-liter engine. Either way, the fuel-efficient 2.0-liter should be easy to find: Just over half of the Mazda3s listed in Cars.com’s new-car inventory are SkyActiv trims. In the past, the Mazda3 has outsold bit players in the commuter segment, but shoppers have preferred the Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla and Chevrolet Cruze — all by more than a 2-to-1 margin. Gas mileage has been a shortfall for the nimble Mazda3; I suspect the revamped drivetrains will narrow the divide.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "The base price of the regular Mazda3 is $14,490. So why is this Mazda3 test car worth $10,000 more?\n\nIt’s because this is the Mazdaspeed3, with a 263 horsepower turbocharged four-cylinder engine, and a six-speed manual transmission, and a lot of other features you seldom find on an economy car. And not only is the list price almost $25,000 — which makes “economy car” seem pretty irrelevant here — some dealers are getting list price and above, because Mazda hasn’t been able to keep up with demand.\n\nMazdaspeed is the company’s performance sub-brand, and other products include the larger Mazdaspeed6, which has not been nearly the success the MazdaSpeed3 is — there’s actually a $1,000 rebate on the Mazdaspeed6. As mentioned, no such deal on the Mazdaspeed3, due in part to the fact that there aren’t many like it. The Honda Civic Si, for example, is a wonderful car, but its 197 horsepower may not be enough for dedicated performance customers.\n\nThere are two versions of the Mazdaspeed3: The Grand Touring, tested here, and the Sport, which is about $1,500 less, lacking a few nonessentials such as leather-trimmed front bucket seats, the Bose seven-speaker stereo and a trip computer.\n\nOutside and inside, the Mazdaspeed3 looks similar to lesser Mazda3 versions, but the test car had a long list of features such as big P215/45R-18 tires and wheels, xenon headlights, a Bose sound system, stability control, a stiffer suspension, traction control and some exterior add-ons, such as the rear spoiler. The tester had only one option: Sirius satellite radio, for $595. Mazda also offers an optional DVD-based navigation system, unusual for a car in this size and price range. Click every option box on the Grand Touring, and you’re up to a heady $27,323.\n\nOn the road, the Mazda- speed3 is plenty fast, but it’s also capable of calm, composed around-town duty. The interior is nicely appointed and very comfortable, with supportive front bucket seats and well-placed instruments and controls.\n\nAcceleration from a standing stop is typically turbolike: Power comes on with a rush, and there’s a little torque steer, which is the tendency for front-wheel-drive cars to steer slightly left or right under hard acceleration. This engine is a gem, and the six-speed manual transmission (no automatic is offered) is a perfect match. Handling is superb despite the fact that the ride is pretty good on all but the roughest pavement.\n\nMazda really got this car right, but it’s up to you to decide if it’s worth the price, or the unremarkable premium-fuel mileage of 20 miles per gallon in the city, 28 on the highway. After all, the Mazda3 S hatchback, with a smooth 157-horsepower, 2.3-liter four-cylinder engine, is a lot of fun at its base price of $17,680.\n\nBut the fact that the Mazdaspeed3 is scarce at dealers suggests that a lot of customers have already made that decision.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe Mazdaspeed3 is Mazda’s pocket rocket. The Mazdaspeed3 features a high-output turbocharged inline-four, a stiffened suspension setup, and unique exterior and interior styling cues. The Mazdaspeed3 is only available as a five-door hatchback. Its trim levels include Sport and Grand Touring models, and its competitors include the Volkswagen GTI, Honda Civic Si and Chevrolet Cobalt SS.\n\nNew for 2009\nThere are no significant changes on the Mazdaspeed3.\n\nExterior\nThe Mazdaspeed3 has widened front fenders, a large supplemental grille in the front bumper, rectangular fog lamps and ground effects.\n\nThe liftgate incorporates a high-mounted spoiler with an integrated brake light. A single, 3.75-inch exhaust pipe exits beneath the bumper. The Mazdaspeed3 is 176.8 inches long and 69.1 inches wide. Because it’s a hatch, the car is a tad shorter than its sedan-based competition.\n\nStandard 18-inch alloy rims with high-performance summer tires\nStandard sport-tuned exhaust\nStandard fog lights and power mirrors\nAutomatic xenon headlights and LED taillamps (Grand Touring)\n\nInterior\nThe Mazdaspeed3 can seat up to five people in two rows. The front bucket seats have more side bolstering than those in the regular Mazda3.

      "expert_review": "Thanks to new drivetrains, the 2012 Mazda3 has fuel economy ratings as high as 40 mpg on the highway. That’s a big gain over last year that addresses a major shortcoming in the brand’s most popular car. After all, at least five 40-mpg competitors will be on sale by this summer. The bandwagon is unstoppable, and now Mazda has a seat on board.\n\nThe 2012 Mazda3’s refinement issues will linger until the car gets a full redesign, but its driving fun and fuel efficiency keep the car competitive.\n\nThe Mazda3 comes as a sedan or hatchback with four available engines and essentially 11 versions, including the turbocharged Mazdaspeed3. Two trim levels have the suffix “SkyActiv,” which represents high-mileage technology in the form of the company’s newest four-cylinder engine and/or select transmissions and other technologies. As is the case in most competing models, the highest mileage figures come in the more expensive sedan trim levels. The most affordable hatchback is efficient, but the base price for this body style is more than $4,000 higher than the base sedan’s.\n\nIn any configuration, the Mazda’s firm ride will turn off some shoppers, but the mileage makeover breathes new life into a model that has never emphasized efficiency. Click here to compare drivetrains, or here to compare the 2012 Mazda3 with the 2011. We tested a stick-shift 2012 Mazda3 hatchback with the SkyActiv four-cylinder. We’ve driven the other engines in years past.\n\nCapable Power\nThe Mazda3’s two base trims, SV and Sport, retain last year’s 148-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder. It moves well enough, helped by well-spaced gear ratios in the optional five-speed automatic transmission. A five-speed manual is standard.\n\nThe 155-hp, direct-inject SkyActiv engine, also a 2.0-liter four-cylinder, adds a modest 7 hp and — more importantly — 10 percent more passing-lane torque than its port-injected peer. It can be paired with either an automatic or a manual, both with six speeds. The SkyActiv engine comes in handy on the interstate, where our stick-shift test car accelerated 10 mph in 6th gear at a reasonable pace. The base 2.0-liter — and a lot of four-cylinder competitors — needs a downshift in order to speed up on the highway. Around town, the 2.0-liter engines feel similar to each other, except that the SkyActiv’s slow initial accelerator response translates to anemic start-offs. The Mazda3’s optional 2.5-liter four-cylinder has gutsier midrange power that makes it quicker than most commuter cars, if less efficient.\n\nThe SkyActiv sedan is rated an EPA-estimated 28/40 mpg city/highway with the automatic, 27/39 with the stick. The SkyActiv hatchback has identical city numbers but is 1 mpg less efficient on the highway with either transmission. Still, that’s 2 to 7 mpg better than the base 2.0-liter, depending on trim, and 6 to 11 mpg better than the 2.5-liter Mazda3. All three engines use regular gas.\n\nThe Mazdaspeed3 comes only with a stick shift and sports a turbocharged four-cylinder that sprints to extralegal speeds. Its refinement, however, is disappointing. The car’s 263-hp engine feels old-school, with noticeable turbo lag followed by power that’s too peaky to savor. Dig deep into the gas, and the tach needle flies toward its 6,700-rpm redline at breakneck speed. For its $24,000 price, the Mazdaspeed3 is a go-fast bargain — our friends at “MotorWeek” hit 60 mph in it in just 5.2 seconds — but more low-rev torque with longer gearing would help drivers enjoy the experience a bit more. So would addressing the car’s torque steer, which becomes a major force on hard takeoffs. Such is the case in powerful front-drive cars, but some manage it better than this one. The Speed3 requires premium gas and is rated 18/25 mpg.\n\nHandling & Ride\nIn the Mazda3, performance trumps comfort — but the payoff is impressive. Editors enjoyed our test car’s sharp steering and linear braking. The nose pushes in sweeping corners, but the tail breaks free soon after, allowing the driver to manage the car’s rotation. The Mazdaspeed3, in contrast, slings more fun-sapping weight over the front axle, which cuts its drifting potential. Its stickier Dunlop SP Sport P225/40R18 summer tires eventually cede grip up front, but the tail stays put, refusing to let you easily slide on all fours.\n\nThe Mazdaspeed3’s choppy ride can be punishing over potholes, and even the base Mazda3 trims ride firmly. On the highway, crosswinds require constant steering corrections, and the suspension in our 2012 test car lost its cool time and again over broken pavement. Road and wind noise, in contrast, were low; I just wish the suspension were as refined. Competitors like the Chevrolet Cruze and Hyundai Elantra marry ride and handling better. The Mazda still wins for outright fun, but comfort-minded drivers should look elsewhere.\n\nThe Inside\nCabin quality is competitive overall, but cars like the Cruze, Elantra and the forthcoming Dodge Dart are pushing ahead. The Mazda’s dashboard panels have upscale textures and padded surfaces; unfortunately, the doors and anything below eye level look considerably cheaper. Still, most controls are high quality, and the dashboard’s shallow rake leaves the interior feeling roomy.\n\nOur test car’s basic cloth seats felt over-bolstered, leaving my back sore after a few hours behind the wheel. My 5-foot-11 frame could have used another inch or so of rearward travel, too. Such limitations preserve some backseat room, and anyone sitting back there will need it. The Mazda3’s legroom dimensions are misleading: There’s an alleged 36.2 inches in both the sedan and hatchback, which would put it near the top of the segment. In reality, though, it’s snug back there; rear seats in the Dart, Honda Civic, Kia Forte and Volkswagen Jetta feel roomier.\n\nTrunk volume in the Mazda3 sedan is just 11.8 cubic feet; the Cruze and Jetta offer 15 cubic feet or more. The Mazda3 hatchback offers a more usable 17 cubic feet behind the backseat, with 42.8 cubic feet of maximum volume with the backseat folded down. Both figures are competitive among hatchbacks.\n\nSafety, Features & Pricing\nReliability for the Mazda3 has been well above average, and the car scored top marks in all crash tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, earning the car Top Safety Pick status. But the Mazda3’s side-impact scores in the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s revamped side-impact tests returned just three out of five stars. Standard features include six airbags and the required antilock brakes and electronic stability system. Click here for a full list, or here to see our evaluation of child-seat accommodations.\n\nThe Mazda3 sedan comes in six trim levels. The SV and Sport have the base 2.0-liter engine. Touring and Grand Touring trims come with the SkyActiv 2.0-liter, while “s” versions of the Touring and Grand Touring have the 2.5-liter four-cylinder. The hatchback skips the base engine by starting at the Touring trim level, but 2012 marks the first year this body style is offered with a smaller engine — in SkyActiv form — rather than just the 2.5-liter. The Mazdaspeed3, available only as a hatchback, comes in Touring trim. Standard features on the SV sedan include power mirrors and windows, plus a CD stereo with steering-wheel audio controls and an auxiliary MP3 jack. Other trims add power door locks, air conditioning and keyless entry. Load the Mazda3 up, and you can get heated leather seats, Bose audio, dual-zone automatic climate control and a moonroof.\n\nMazda3 in the Market\nWill shoppers buy the new SkyActiv versions of the Mazda3? I think so. The mileage gains are enough to take some of the sting out of the price difference in the sedan, and the engine effectively lowers the price of the hatchback by giving buyers a cheaper alternative to the 2.5-liter engine. Either way, the fuel-efficient 2.0-liter should be easy to find: Just over half of the Mazda3s listed in Cars.com’s new-car inventory are SkyActiv trims. In the past, the Mazda3 has outsold bit players in the commuter segment, but shoppers have preferred the Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla and Chevrolet Cruze — all by more than a 2-to-1 margin. Gas mileage has been a shortfall for the nimble Mazda3; I suspect the revamped drivetrains will narrow the divide.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in September 2006 about the 2007 Mazdaspeed3. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what details are different this year, check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThere’s a new trend in the automotive world. It’s called “cheap speed,” and automakers are achieving it by loading up relatively affordable compact cars with enhanced engines and suspensions along with go-fast technology at prices below even entry-level muscle cars.\n\nThese sport compacts weigh a fraction of what today’s muscle cars do; they’re front-wheel drive, cost a lot less and are equally fun to drive. The Honda Civic Si, Volkswagen GTI and Dodge Caliber SRT4 are all back on the market — or will be soon — with 200-plus horsepower or, in the Caliber’s case, 300 hp when it arrives later this year. Sandwiched in between these entries is Mazda’s best foray into the space to date, the Mazdaspeed3.\n\nAfter a week in the Mazdaspeed3, I was more than impressed with the vehicle’s speed and affordability. Costing under $23,000 and registering a zero-to-60 time in the 5-second range, its cost-to-fun ratio is hard to beat.\n\nGoing & Stopping\nWhen you look at the Mazdaspeed3 you see a sporty hatchback; you wouldn’t think this cute little thing has a 263-hp turbocharged four-cylinder that can get to 60 mph in under 6 seconds (some estimates have it as low as 5.3 seconds, others at 5.9 seconds). Whatever the final number is, it’s fast, folks. The Honda Civic Si’s 7.3 seconds and the GTI’s 6.9 seconds seem almost quaint in comparison.\n\nThe turbo engine provides a ton of turbo lag — dirty words in performance circles. The lag is the amount of time it takes the turbocharger to kick in under acceleration and provide a boost to the engine. You would recognize it as the sudden thrust you feel after you’ve already hammered the gas pedal. This lag, though, is what gives the Mazdaspeed3 its personality. It turns this little number into a miniature roller coaster ride all unto itself, with the lag hitting you in the same part of the gut as that first drop on the coaster.\n\nThere’s a loud exhaust note out back that’s great to hear on city streets with the windows down as you shift through the gears with gusto. It lets you know you’re in a sports car, even if it looks like a commuter. On the highway, the effect is more akin to the loud drone of an idling lawnmower. It’s omnipresent.\n\nThe Mazdaspeed3 is not just an around-town rocket. It hustles on the highway as well. Road and wind noise are minimal; that lawnmower exhaust intrudes instead.\n\nThe six-speed transmission also makes highway driving fun. With traditional five-speed transmissions, you’re usually relegated to one gear for high-speed driving. The Mazdaspeed3 allows for some gutsy merges and lane changes in fifth, and even in sixth you can massage the gas pedal just right to get the turbo to kick in and forego shifting. Every move is fun. Of course, that fun becomes costly on the gas mileage front, bringing the 26/33 mpg city/highway estimate of the manual-transmission Mazda3 hatchback down to 20/28 mpg in the Mazdaspeed3. And the Mazdaspeed3’s turbo engine requires premium fuel.\n\nThere are antilock disc brakes at all four wheels, and they provide plenty of stopping power. The only problem is you’ll have to use some force to get them to kick in. The initial push on the brake pedal doesn’t provide full stopping power, it just depresses enough to assure you that, yes, you have hit the brake pedal, but now you have to hit it harder. Pressing down through this hesitation allows the brakes to catch fully. The move is not as precise as either the Civic Si or the Volkswagen GTI, but once drivers learn where the threshold is, there shouldn’t be any issues.\n\nRide & Handling\nGearheads of the world worry that the Mazdaspeed3 has too much power going to its front wheels. Tires can only do so much of one thing, whether it’s accelerating, braking or turning. When the front wheels are asked to turn and accelerate with no support from the back wheels, performance suffers and you get a result called understeer. Understeer is another dirty word to enthusiasts, and Mazda did a lot to minimize the impact of all this power in a front-wheel-drive layout by implementing an advanced torque-management system and a limited-slip differential. Why didn’t it go to all-wheel drive like more expensive compact sports cars like the Subaru WRX STi and Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution? Cost and weight are the leading factors; those cars cost at least $5,000 more than the Mazdaspeed3.\n\nSo, is there still understeer in the Mazdaspeed3? Of course. It would be a feat equivalent to building the pyramids to get that neutralized in such a vehicle, but that doesn’t mean the car doesn’t perform well. Do you get the same sense of confidence as in one of those all-wheel-drive models? No, but if that’s a deal-breaker, Mazda does have the all-wheel-drive Mazdaspeed6, which debuted last year.\n\nThe Mazdaspeed3 is just as confident as the superb GTI and probably a tad better than the Si in the handling department, and it’s still faster than both.\n\nExterior & Interior\nTo most eyes the Mazdaspeed3 doesn’t look much different from the regular Mazda3 hatchback. Inspect it a little more and you’ll find a revised front end with different lights and bumper, and a lower stance over large 18-inch wheels. Around back there are new taillights, as well as a large spoiler at the top of the hatch. Because of its placement, there’s no air of immaturity sometimes associated with large wings on sport sedans.\n\nInside, the Mazdaspeed3 gets new sport-inspired bucket seats and red trim, and that’s about it. This is a no-frills machine, and the regular Mazda3 already sports an attractive interior for a compact car. Mazda did well not to change too much here. The gauges are the same glowing orange and hold up well in bright sunlight. Radio and environmental controls are easy to reach and intuitive in every respect.\n\nSafety\nFront seat-mounted side-impact airbags, as well as side curtain airbags for front and rear passengers, are standard, as is a tire pressure monitoring system.\n\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave the Mazda3 its highest frontal crash rating of Good. Its side-impact tests were performed without the side airbags that are standard in the Mazdaspeed3, and without them the Mazda3 received the lowest score, Poor. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gave the Mazda3 a three-star rating, which is its average rating and not particularly reassuring. A very fast car and average safety ratings isn’t the best mix, but Mazdaspeed3 buyers may be less likely to have safety ratings high on their list of priorities.\n\nFeatures\nMy Grand Touring tester came with a navigation system and upgraded Bose stereo. The Mazda3 wasn’t originally designed with navigation in mind (who would pay for the expensive upgrade in a compact?) and it shows. The screen pops up at the top of the dash just fine, but the interface is located to the right of the shifter. Not only is it inconvenient, but with a manual transmission, it seems a bit dangerous, especially because I found the shifter easy to pop in and out of gears. One distracted move while trying to find your destination could land you in neutral or the wrong gear. I didn’t experience any problems in my week of testing, though.\n\nThe Bose sound system and in-dash six-disc CD changer were above average, but not as good as other applications, like the one in the new Mazda CX-7 crossover. The stereo system in all Mazda3s is so integrated into the center console that replacing it with an aftermarket unit would result in an unsightly dashboard, so pay at the dealer if you want better sound and a good-looking interior. Unfortunately, you can only get the Bose system in the more expensive Grand Touring model that’s also saddled with the navigation system.\n\nCargo\nStrip away the thrilling turbo engine, and the Mazdaspeed3 is still a four-door hatchback. That means it’s — gasp — almost practical. With the rear seats up, there was plenty of room to stow luggage on a weekend trip. Flip the seats down and the cargo area expands from 16.5 cubic feet to 43.4 cubic feet. No other sport compact on the market has this kind of usability, and that may sway drivers looking for responsible fun.\n\nMazdaspeed3 in the Market\nMazda has done it. It’s reinvigorated its Mazdaspeed line with a fast compact that not only holds its own with the competition, but bests them in many departments. It joins the Mazdaspeed6 as an affordable performance car, and I hope it spurs the company to keep producing high-speed variants of other models. I wouldn’t mind seeing a Mazdaspeed3 sedan myself, if Mazda kept the price where it is. This speed is supposed to be cheap, after all.\n\nSend David an email",
