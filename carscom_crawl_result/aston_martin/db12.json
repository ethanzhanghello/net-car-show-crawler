      "expert_review": "The new Aston Martin DB12 that replaces the DB11 looks an awful lot like the DB11-based DBS. Overlaying images of the two cars, we can’t help but think that when the brand says this car is new, there’s some logic along the lines of “you can’t use the same bolt twice, so here’s a new one” at play.\n\nNot that there’s anything wrong with that. The DBS is a stunning car— as is the DB11, Vantage and most Aston Martins throughout history — and the DB12 is likewise gorgeous. That long hood and low roof, those bulging haunches stuffed with 21-inch wheels … okay, fine, we haven’t met, but I’d sure like to get to know you.\n\nRelated: 2021 Aston Martin DBX: 5 Things We Like and 4 We Don’t\n\nThe most important new bit is the engine. A version of the same AMG-sourced twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8 that powers the rest of the Aston Martin lineup gets new turbos, camshafts and an updated cooling system to crank out a massive 671 horsepower and 590 pound-feet of torque. The brand claims the DB12 will go from 0-60 mph in 3.5 seconds and top out at 202 mph.\n\n2024 Aston Martin DB12 | Manufacturer image\n\nThe V-8 is paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission, but what’s behind that is another cool new bit: the brand’s first electronically controlled limited-slip differential. The diff is said to be able to go from open to 100% locked in milliseconds, and Aston Martin promises that its integration into that stability control system will allow drivers to “incrementally explore the limits of grip and traction in complete confidence and safety.” We’re getting excited again.\n\nIn addition to four stability control settings — On, Off, Wet and Track — the DB12 has four driving modes: Wet, GT, Sport and Sport+. A fifth, Individual, is set aside for owners to store their own favorite combination of vehicle settings. Among those adjustable elements are new adaptive dampers and variable-assistance electric power steering.\n\nYour eyes do not deceive you: The wheels filling those fenders are in fact larger than the DB11’s. Measuring 21 inches front and rear, they are nonetheless 17.6 pounds lighter than the dinky 20s on the outgoing car. Buyers interested in further weight reduction can spec the carbon-ceramic brakes, which lop another 59.5 pounds of unsprung weight. The DB12 marks the first appearance of Michelin’s new Pilot Sport 5s; the 275/35 front and 315/30 rear tires are fitted with a foam insert to reduce road noise to grand-tourer acceptable levels.\n\n2024 Aston Martin DB12 | Manufacturer image\n\nThe DB12 also debuts Aston Martin’s first in-house infotainment effort. It uses a 10.25-inch touchscreen, and even before our first tentative taps, we can say the brand has done at least one thing right: There are hard buttons for the climate control, drive modes, stability control, active exhaust and other commonly used functions.\n\nAston Martin hasn’t announced official pricing, but expect the coupe to start just shy of $250,000. That’s about $30,000 more than a V-8-powered DB11, but a savings of over $80,000 compared to the DBS. Deliveries will begin later this year.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nCompare the Aston Martin DB11 and DBS\nResearch the 2023 Aston Martin DB11\nResearch the 2023 Aston Martin DBS\nFind Aston Martin Cars For Sale Near You\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
