      "expert_review": "Once you really look into it, you realize there are a surprising number of alternatives to the stalwart Porsche 911. The Mercedes-AMG GT is one, as are the Maserati Gran Turismo, Nissan GT-R and Audi R8. Here’s another: the new 2019 Aston Martin Vantage.\n\nNew from the ground up, the Vantage sits on a new platform that shares little with previous Aston Martins — but it does have some bits and pieces you might have seen before. While the chassis parts are Aston, the powertrain and much of the electronics in this two-seat luxury sports coupe are sourced from Mercedes-Benz, meaning there’s a lot of the excellent AMG GT coupe nestled under that svelte British sheet metal. Is that a good thing? I had a long weekend in the new Vantage to find out.\n\nThe Heart of ein Löwe\n\n\nThere’s a lot that’s familiar about the Vantage, such as the Mercedes-AMG twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 nestled under that impossibly low hood. It makes 503 horsepower and 505 pounds-feet of torque — comparable to its output in various AMG GT models (where it ranges from 469 to 577 hp). It sounds differently glorious here than it does in any of the Mercedes models it powers, with a vicious ripping snarl on hard acceleration that’ll make you want to repeat hard launches again and again.\n\nIt also provides massive thrust, but still accelerates a tick behind competitors like the Audi R8 and Mercedes-AMG GT due to weighing nearly 200 pounds more than they do. You’ll never notice, however, as only the most skilled track drivers are likely to experience any deficiency from it. Out on the street, it’s incredibly quick, reaching super-legal speeds in alarming fashion and cruising all day at those elevated speeds without you realizing it — the true mark of a high-quality European sports car, in my opinion.\n\nThe ride, while firm, is decently damped; any harshness is the result of those massive 20-inch wheels riding on stiff Pirelli P-Zero tires. But the Vantage doesn’t offer the kind of adjustability of its suspension, transmission, steering and other systems as some of its competitors do. The AMG GT’s exhaust is tunable, if you spring for that option, and you can get specific on various systems for the Porsche 911, as well. But the Vantage limits you to just three driving modes, relying on the company’s knowledge of how the car should behave rather than allowing you to dial in what you think is most appropriate.\n\nBut a car this tightly packaged, this highly strung is more about handling and balance than straight-line acceleration. If you were just interested in zero-to-60 times, you could pony up half the cost of this Vantage and get yourself a Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat Redeye, which does the quarter mile in the 10-second range. It’s the areas of chassis tuning and handling characteristics where Aston Martin brought its expertise to bear, creating one of the best-handling vehicles I’ve ever driven. The steering is extraordinarily precise, with a quick ratio that requires minimal input for maximum effect. Feedback is excellent, effort is spot-on and there’s none of the frenetic dartiness that sometimes plagues high-strung sports coupes on the highway (I’m lookin’ at you, Nissan GT-R). A huge part of the Vantage’s appeal is this stellar handling; the powertrain and styling are just icing on the scone.\n\nI have less praise for the brakes, however. The brakes are a carbon-ceramic system, like many high-performance cars feature, and as usual, they squeal like mad when you drive like a normal person on normal roads at normal speeds. Pedal feel is average, nothing special, but once you heat up the brakes, their ability to haul the Vantage down from speed with immediacy is serious. Thing is, you have to get that heat into them first — and for a street car, I still think carbon-ceramic brakes are an unpleasant waste. Unless you’re using your Vantage (or your Porsche 911 or your Audi R8) as a track toy, skip the carbon-ceramic option.\n\nThe Body of a Supermodel … With Unfortunate Orthodontia\n\nMention has to be made of the Vantage’s styling, which combines some traditional Aston Martin styling cues with some new looks and features. Most onlookers I surveyed agreed: The Vantage is about 90 percent gorgeous. From the headlights rearward, it’s stunning, with tidy proportions and no extraneous strakes or cut lines. The biggest issue? That chicken-wire grille, which retains Aston’s traditional shape but seems to be made out of backyard fencing material. It ruins the front three-quarter view of the car, making the Vantage best viewed from the side or rear quarter.\n\nWhat’s more surprising about the Vantage is just how compact it is. In photos and videos, it looks like a large coupe. If you’re familiar with other Aston Martins, such as the Rapide sedan or the DB11, you’ll expect this one to be on the larger side, as well, but it’s not. It’s almost a foot shorter than a DB11 overall, and it’s even shorter than a Jaguar F-Type, Porsche 911 and Mercedes-AMG GT. It features a very long wheelbase, however, which gives it those stretched proportions and minimized front and rear overhangs. Whereas the DB11 is more of a grand touring machine, the Vantage is much more sport-oriented; it’s fun-sized, and it looks the part.\n\nBigger on the Inside\n\nOpen an oddly hinged, slightly upward-opening-but-not-quite-a-scissor door, and you can slide inside the leather-lined cockpit. The doors are unusual in that they don’t open straight out, yet they also don’t open up like a Lamborghini, though I found that they make a lot of sense when you’re parking curbside. The Vantage is a low-riding car, but the door hinges guarantee you’ll never scrape the bottom of the door on anything. Pretty slick.\n\nOnce inside, you’re treated to a mix of materials. Anything covered in leather looks, feels and smells fantastic; Aston used some high-quality cowhide on the seats and consoles, and it shows. Where it cheaped out was on the plastic bits: The climate-control vents, for instance, wouldn’t feel out of place on a 25-year-old Kia. The seating position is unusual, too, as you sit very low in the car, but the beltline is quite high, creating a tublike effect that makes it awkward to put your left arm up on the windowsill. Though you sit low, the steering wheel and gauges are mounted unnaturally high, and the wheel isn’t adjustable enough to allow for viewing the topmost bit of the gauge cluster if you have a long torso. The wheel is also weird: It’s not round, it’s a squircle — a squared-off circle that initially feels unusual, but eventually blends into the melange of curious shapes in the cabin.\n\nIt may be quirky, but at least it’s comfortable. The seats are large and supportive, well-bolstered without being too aggressive, and you can really feel the Vantage’s extra width when bringing along a passenger. It feels far more spacious and open than an AMG GT or Porsche 911, and there’s decent cargo space out back, as well. What there’s precious little of is any sort of storage up front, with nowhere secure to stick a cellphone.\n\nThe controls are straightforward. The push-button shifter is the most unique bit inside. The multimedia system is straight-up Mercedes-Benz Comand, so if you’re familiar with the menus and rotary controller mechanism for that system, the Vantage will be easy to use. The audio system is nothing special; it’s put to shame by the high-end Burmester audio in an AMG. The gauge cluster is simple and unique, with a three-region, separated look. It’s a decidedly mixed environment in the Vantage, and aside from the car’s top-quality leather, it’s not necessarily what one might expect for the price tag.\n\nSafety\n\nLike most low-volume vehicles, the Aston Martin Vantage has not been crash-tested by either the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. And like many other vehicles from low-volume manufacturers, it doesn’t offer many more advanced safety systems, like forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning, adaptive cruise control and so on. However, it does have blind spot warning, backup sensors and a backup camera. LED headlights with washers are standard.\n\nCompetitively Priced\n\nAll this glorious style and speed comes at a price, of course, but it’s not quite as dear as you may suspect. The base price of a 2019 Vantage is $152,820 including destination. Add the options my test car featured, and you’ll boost the price to $186,806. What extra equipment did it have to boost the price by more than 20 percent? Couldn’t tell ya; Aston Martin declined to provide a detailed sheet, but one suspects all the decorative carbon-fiber bits played a big part.\n\nAs lofty as that price is, it’s comparable to high-performance German sports cars in the same category. The Porsche 911’s price range is big, but the as-optioned Vantage compares well with a 911 Turbo S or Audi R8 V-10 Plus. Keep your hand off the options buttons, and you can bring that price down to compare favorably with the Mercedes-AMG GT in any of its trims, from the base model up through a track-ready R. The Vantage feels like a more agile, more sporting version of the AMG GT, with very different styling and an interior that isn’t quite up to Benz levels of opulence. Selecting one over the other might come down to which has your preferred style or which has better technology. Compare all four here.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The Vantage is Aston Martin’s best driver’s car in a generation — at least, it’s the brand’s best attainable driver’s car in a generation, not counting limited-production fantasies. While the redesigned 2025 model isn’t a dramatic styling departure from its predecessor, myriad upgrades make the crazy and beautiful coupe even crazier and even more beautiful.\n\nRelated: Aston Martin DB12 Looks Awfully Familiar, Debuts With 671 HP\n\nBeauty Is in the Eye of the Vantage Beholder\n\nNow 1.2 inches wider, the 2025 Vantage inhales through a grille that is likewise expanded. Frameless like that on Aston’s DB cars, the grille is 38% larger than the previous Vantage’s and now flanked by vertical intakes. Around back, it looks as if designers faced the same question of how to style a void. Their answer seems to have been “with as little bodywork surrounding it as possible,” with triangular outlets carved into the trailing edge of the wheel wells and a tiny peninsula of sheet metal that extends into the rear diffuser and is just big enough to accommodate a license plate.\n\nStandard 21-inch wheels are an inch larger in diameter than before and significantly wider to fill out the flexed bodywork. Aston also worked with Michelin to uniquely tailor the Pilot Sport S 5 rubber for the Vantage. The standard brakes measure 15.7 inches up front and 14.2 inches in the rear, and available carbon-ceramics lop some 60 pounds of unsprung weight. Three wheel designs are available in multiple colors and finishes, and in addition to body color and trim material, buyers can spec an accent color for a sill pinstripe, grille “lipstick” (Aston’s word), and the diffuser and rear body panel.\n\nPower to Change (Tires to Dust)\n\nThat gaping grille isn’t just for looks. With 656 horsepower and 590 pounds-feet of torque, the Vantage’s engine gains roughly 153 hp and 85 pounds-feet over its predecessor, increases of 30% and 15%, respectively. This is due to serious internal work — revised cam profiles and compression ratios — as well as bigger turbos and increased cooling capacity for intake air, coolant and oil.\n\nThe rear-mounted ZF eight-speed automatic transmission remains but is revised for quicker shifts or smoother ones, depending on the drive mode. Aston claims the Vantage will accelerate to 60 mph in 3.4 seconds and hit a top speed of 202 mph. A new launch control function allows drivers to fine-tune the amount of wheel slip; it can also be turned off entirely to obliterate the Michelins in the shortest time possible.\n\nReinforced Structure\n\nRevised steering-column mounting and a relocated front cross-member are said to stiffen the front end for improved steering feel — already one of our favorite things about its predecessor. The rear suspension mounting, too, is said to be stiffer, further engorging the Vantage’s high-flow feedback channels. New adaptive dampers boast an increased range of adjustability, and the brake booster is tuned for a firmer pedal.\n\nLike other high-dollar sports cars, the 2025 Vantage includes an advanced Active Vehicle Dynamics control system that Aston says “will reward skilled driving but doesn’t depend upon it to deliver a thrilling experience.” In addition to incremental stability control parameters and an electronically controlled limited-slip differential that can vary lockup from zero to 100%, the traction control can be adjusted to allow for varying degrees of wheel slip on corner exit — and with 590 pounds-feet of torque available, there’s bound to be plenty of that regardless of speed.\n\nSmarter and the Same\n\nOne of our biggest complaints with the Vantage has been that its low seats and short windows make for poor outward visibility. While the redesigned dashboard incorporates stronger horizontal lines for a cleaner and less bulky look, it’s unlikely to impact our previous assessment. Aston also ditched the Vantage’s previous infotainment system for a new 10.25-inch touchscreen.\n\nAvailability and Pricing\n\nDeliveries of the redesigned 2025 Aston Martin Vantage will begin in the second quarter. Pricing will be announced later, but expect it to start around $150,000.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2019 Aston Martin Vantage: 10 Things We Like (and 4 Not So Much)\n2021 Aston Martin DBX Review: When a Bentley Is Just Too Common\n2019 Aston Martin Vantage: Rare, Special and Striking\nResearch Aston Martin\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Is the Aston Martin Vantage Roadster a Good Sports Car?\n\nYou’ll be hard-pressed to find a two-seat convertible sports car that blends as much character, class, style and stonkin’ performance as the 2026 Aston Martin Vantage Roadster.\n\nHow Does the Aston Martin Vantage Roadster Compare With Other Sports Cars?\n\nIn the Vantage’s world, it’s the same as it ever was. With a competition field filled with back-roads weapons like the Porsche 911 Carrera GTS, Corvette Z06 and Mercedes-AMG GT, the Aston Martin stands out with wicked good looks and enough performance to match any of them.\n\nWhen you weren’t looking, Aston Martin got serious — really, really serious. The last time a British automaker buckled down as hard as Aston’s folks have over the past few years, we got the McLaren 720S, and that was a triumph. The 2026 Aston Martin Vantage Roadster is also a triumph both mechanically and existentially, if not only for the marque’s clear intent on bringing the winged badge back to the forefront of performance.\n\nRelated: Paparazzi’s Delight: 2026 Aston Martin Vantage Roadster\n\nWe here at Cars.com usually refrain from discussing much about a car’s styling — it’s a very subjective thing to arbitrate on — but my goodness! The refreshed Vantage is easily one of the best-looking things I’ve seen on the road in quite some time, and it makes it all look so easy. It also makes you wonder how the prior iteration left the cutting floor with that controversial shark snout and featureless grille that all looked a bit underwhelming, especially with its narrow-profile headlights.\n\n2026 Aston Martin Vantage Roadster, rear angle | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\n\n“Underwhelming” is the last thing an Aston should ever be, and the new front end and musclebound proportions fix every stylistic issue. Other than a new egg-carton-style grille and a set of more traditional headlights, the bottom portion of the car below the grille is now painted, neatly fixing its predecessor’s severe underbite and bringing us full circle back to that signature gawping-catfish grille that’s defined the brand for over 70 years now. This is the best the baby AM has looked in years, and this is especially true when you drop that electrically operated top, an operation that takes a shockingly scant 6.8 seconds — or, quicker than most new cars will hit 60 mph.\n\nWhat Engine Does the 2026 Aston Martin Vantage Roadster Have?\n\nThat’s no such problem in the Vantage. The Mercedes-AMG-sourced twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8 also returns, only now with around 153 extra Brit-bred horses from before, with “base” output at a mighty 656 horsepower and tire-thwonking 590 pounds-feet of torque. Any Aston engineer reading this likely just chucked their spanner; brand reps and program managers on hand at the Roadster’s drive program in Palm Springs, Calif., made it clear just how far removed the Vantage’s new heart is from the old AMG engine.\n\nIn fact, they were rather dour on the prior Vantage as a whole, citing how relatively “restrained” its performance and on-road character was. (Uh, fellas: I drove the prior V-8-powered Vantage on three separate extended occasions, and at no point was that 503-hp, 505-pounds-feet supercoupe remotely restrained.) In the spirit of all Astons from that renaissance era of forced-induction power, the last Vantage was a torque-‘n’-turbo-forward brute in a suit that chased the likes of a Carrera GTS or Corvette Grand Sport down the mountain and beat them to a pulp at the valet stand.\n\nThis new Vantage? Its 656 hp means you’re now up the soot chute of a 911 Turbo or Corvette Z06 with zero chance of those California Camrys getting the last upfront spot at valet. This wasn’t a case of simply turning up the boost, either; Aston claims a new block, turbochargers, induction, runners, heads and electronic control unit are among the changes.\n\nThis is all part of this “seriousness” I mentioned earlier. Talking to the Aston reps, looking at the current product offensive and driving the latest metal — the boutique British automaker is taking leaps, not incremental steps, toward improvement. Whether this is due to Chairman Lawrence Stroll’s ongoing effort to reshape and restore the brand’s prestige or the fruits of an ongoing evolution sowed earlier, it’s working.\n\nHow Nice Is the Interior of the 2026 Aston Martin Vantage Roadster?\n\nForget the power for a moment. Even without touching that crystalline start button on the center console, you’ll notice the new Vantage’s interior is lovely and detail-oriented. It’s an effective port-over of the larger DB12’s cockpit complete with the same fabulous controls, slim steering wheel, shift paddles, center infotainment screen and digital driver display. These last two bits are crucial; compared with the Mercedes-based system in the prior car, Aston’s newest digital architecture is quick, intuitive, lean and stylistically elegant. All of this comes in a flush dashboard display that no longer looks like a tacked-on afterthought.\n\nThat volcanic V-8 is also a carryover from the DB12 even if the engineers are quick to point out crucial differences between tune profiles. The larger, heavier, four-seat DB’s 671 hp is 15 hp more than the Vantage offers, but its thick 590 pounds-feet of torque is unchanged. Also unchanged is the mechanical guts of the ZF-sourced eight-speed automatic transmission, though the Vantage’s shift software is focused more on performance and tactility than the long-legged grand-touring blend of the DB.\n\nAccording to Aston, you must contextualize the Vantage as a pure, focused sports car, not as a lush, high-performance grand tourer in the DB12 and Vanquish mold. The rich leather and fine cabin appointments mean it possesses GT properties, but the automaker imagines customer crossover with the 911 GT3 and Ferrari Roma, not the Bentley Continental GT.\n\n2026 Aston Martin Vantage Roadster, interior | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\nHow Is the 2026 Aston Martin Vantage Roadster to Drive?\n\nAs such, you’ve got a choice of five drive modes to pick from: Sport, Sport+, Track, Wet and Individual, with Sport serving as the default profile. This means that no, there isn’t a “Comfort” or “Tour” mode, with the “Wet” profile being the most restrained. For something that could conceivably be used as a very special daily (or at least frequent) transportation, the suspension and ride of the Vantage Roadster is quite stiff; composure over bumps, pavement breaks and expansion joints are just the wrong side of harsh. That’s excusable for a coupe, but a roadster is almost always used as more of a cruiser than cruise missile even if the capabilities are only slightly diminished from its fixed-roof counterpart.\n\nAh, well. Suffer for beauty, I suppose — only there’s hardly any suffering here. It’s just a bit flinty for frequent use, and I expect for some, this might make the whole endeavor that much more distinct and special. And special it is; roof or no roof, character oozes from the carbon pores of the Vantage Roadster like molten treacle. That dynamite engine shouts on a spectrum between a grumble and a guttural roar, sounding every bit of that mad AMG heart with some clear sonal tuning from Aston that prioritizes buttery notes over metallic gnash.\n\nWedge that dual-mode exhaust open and send it down your favorite road to spook birds and frenzy dogs three counties over. Do make sure you’ve got plenty of room, however, as you’re going to find yourself scrambling from Point A to, well, Point Oh Crap in no time. Aston cites 3.5 seconds for the 0-60 mph time, and it felt every bit of that on the tight, squiggling canyon roads deep in Southern California’s San Jacinto Mountains.\n\n2026 Aston Martin Vantage Roadster, front | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\nHow Much Does the 2026 Aston Martin Vantage Roadster Weigh?\n\nConsidering the prevalence of heavy EVs these days, the Vantage Roadster’s 3,670-pound curb weight is reasonable if not still a bit porkish, with 132 pounds of it due to the droptop’s additional structural reinforcements. But weight only matters if you can feel it, and the Roadster — and coupe, by extension — is impressively sharp and disconcertingly agile considering both that on-paper figure and those comically swollen haunches.\n\nSteering is both quick and on the lighter side, but there’s enough granularity and tactility to offset any artificialness. Steering and braking inputs are progressive, with a strong stamp to those massive (and optional) 16-inch front and 14-inch rear carbon-ceramic brakes shedding speed like hitting a mound of anvils. Grip is both tremendous and entirely expected thanks to the Aston-specific Michelin Pilot Sport S 5 AML tires cut to P275/35R21 in the front and a steamroller-wide P325/30R21 in the rear.\n\nIt’s a confident car at speed, with plenty of that grip to lean on while nursing the rather touchy accelerator pedal. In the canyons, I preferred Sport+ to Track for managing the drivetrain and keeping the chassis at least modestly more inline versus the Track traction setting. If you’re braver (or stupider) than I am, go ahead and futz with the Vantage’s eight-level traction control system for either max coddling or swooping, smoky drifts.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2025 Aston Martin Vantage: Even More Crazy and Beautiful\nUndead Another Day: Aston Martin Vanquish Returns (Again)\n2026 Aston Martin DBX S Adds Power, Carbon Fiber\n2025 Aston Martin DBX707 Review: Behold Bond’s Family Wagon\nShop for a New Aston Martin Vantage Near You\nHow Much Does the 2026 Aston Martin Vantage Roadster Cost?\n\nFor what is now the most affordable new Aston, the 2026 Vantage and Vantage Roadster are beyond impressive for fit, finish, style, theater and performance, and they should absolutely dash any preconceived notions you might have of the brand whether this is your first or fifth sled.\n\nMassive improvements come with a massive price: As of this writing, a 2026 Vantage Roadster will set you back no less than $205,900, or roughly $20,000 more than a Porsche 911 Carrera GTS cabriolet and ‘bout $7,500 short of a 911 Turbo cabriolet. It’s also around $80,000 more than a Chevrolet Corvette Z06 convertible, and while the Aston is more characterful and “special” than those Porsches, it’s a leather-lined moonshot away from the Z06 in fit, finish and presentation.\n\nHell of a redux, Aston. If the standard Vantage is this thrilling, I can’t imagine how nutso the (surely) forthcoming Vantage V-12 will be. Gimme a ring when that comes around, all right?\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
