      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nIn addition to the DB9 model that debuted for 2005, Aston Martin continues to offer the more expensive Vanquish. The high-dollar coupe joined the lineup of this legendary British sports car maker in 2002. Headquartered in Buckinghamshire, England, Aston Martin is owned by Ford Motor Co.\n\nThe automaker introduced a high-performance Vanquish S coupe at the 2004 Paris Motor Show. Approximately 300 S editions were to be built per year. Each holds a 6.0-liter V-12 that’s tuned to deliver 520 horsepower.\n\nOnly the Vanquish S is offered for 2006. A navigation system and a new audio system are installed, and the Vanquish can communicate with Bluetooth-enabled phones. New standard equipment includes rear parking sensors, heated front seats, power-folding side mirrors and a garage-door opener.\n\nExterior\nThe elegant Vanquish was designed largely by Ian Callum, who also designed the now-departed DB7 Vantage. The Vanquish has a shorter hood and a wider, lower air intake than the less costly DB9. Bold auxiliary driving lamps flank its grille.\n\nThe front fenders and hood panels incorporate finely detailed compound curves that sweep back to steeply raked windshield pillars and a low, curved roofline. Deeply sculptured sill and door panels accentuate the classic profile, and large trapezoidal taillights sit in an arching tail. A chrome racing-style fuel filler is used. Nine-spoke alloy wheels measure 19 inches in diameter.\n\nCarbon fiber, extruded aluminum and composite materials are bonded together to form a central safety cell in a process also used in the aerospace industry. Aston Martin says it’s lighter, stiffer and stronger than conventional body construction and provides improved crash protection. Built on a 105.9-inch wheelbase, the Vanquish measures 183.7 inches long overall and stands 51.9 inches tall.\n\nInterior\nThe Vanquish is available with or without a small backseat. Prospective owners are invited to visit Aston Martin’s Newport Pagnell factory to select both the body color and a Connolly leather upholstery scheme. White-faced instruments greet the driver, and a message center can provide information in 11 languages.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Vanquish’s V-12 produces 520 hp and 425 pounds-feet of torque. The close-ratio six-speed-manual transmission uses fingertip-actuated Formula One-style paddles to produce gear changes; the gearbox also has an automatic mode. A special shifting program is tailored for winter driving.\n\nSafety\nAll-disc antilock brakes are installed.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nA brand-new high-dollar model named V12 Vanquish joined the lineup of this legendary British sports car maker in 2002. Not only was the initial allotment of 70 cars for the United States hurriedly snatched up, but the total for 2003 — an even 100 cars — also sold out early, according to Automotive News.\n\nTwo rear-wheel-drive body styles are available: a two-passenger coupe and a 2+2 model with a small backseat. Starting with cars produced in May 2004, a Sports Dynamic option will be available as a dealer-installed accessory. It consists of a sport pack suspension and a new braking system with six-piston front calipers and larger discs. Nine-spoke wheels are 19 inches in diameter and are made of lightweight, forged alloy.\n\nAt the 2004 North American International Auto Show, Aston Martin introduced a brand-new DB9 model that will emerge for 2005. Production of the DB7 Vantage model halted after 2003.\n\nHeadquartered in Buckinghamshire, England, and long known for limited-production sports cars, Aston Martin is owned by Ford. Aston Martin sold 519 cars in the United States during 2003; most of the automaker’s vehicles are sold in the United States and Great Britain.\n\nExterior\nBecause the elegantly styled V12 Vanquish was designed largely by Ian Callum, who also penned the now-departed DB7 Vantage, there’s a strong resemblance between the two sports cars. With side vents and a larger grille that is flanked by bold auxiliary driving lamps, the V12 Vanquish looks a bit more muscular than the DB7.\n\nThe front fenders and hood panels incorporate finely detailed compound curves that sweep back to steeply raked windshield pillars and a low, curving roofline. Deeply sculptured sill and door panels accentuate the classic profile, and larger trapezoidal taillights sit in a slightly higher, arching tail. A chrome racing-style fuel filler is used.\n\nThe main body structure of the V12 Vanquish utilizes carbon fiber, extruded aluminum and composite materials that are bonded together to form a central safety cell in a process also used in the aerospace industry. Aston Martin says it’s lighter, stiffer and stronger than conventional body construction that utilizes bolts or welding. The automaker also claims it provides improved crash protection.\n\nBuilt on a 106-inch wheelbase, the V12 Vanquish measures 183.7 inches long overall and stands 51.9 inches tall. Buyers can choose their own colors for the car’s body and leather upholstery.\n\nInterior\nThe V12 Vanquish is available with or without a small backseat. Prospective owners are invited to visit Aston Martin’s Newport Pagnell factory in Buckinghamshire to select both the body color and Connolly leather upholstery scheme. A deep center console separates the front occupants and incorporates a red starter button. White-faced instruments and a message center can provide information in 11 languages.\n\nUnder the Hood\nDeveloped with Ford’s assistance, the 6.0-liter dual-overhead-cam V-12 engine develops 460 horsepower and 400 pounds-feet of torque and works with a drive-by-wire throttle. The close-ratio six-speed-manual transmission uses fingertip-actuated Formula One-style paddles to produce gear changes; the gearbox can also be used in automatic mode. A special shifting program is tailored for winter weather conditions.\n\nSafety\nAll-disc antilock Brembo brakes are installed. Side-impact airbags are not available.",

      "expert_review": "Let’s get this straight.\n\nYou buy Playboy to read the jokes and watch a James Bond movie to see the cars.\n\nAnd that’s why the folks from Aston Martin are excited about the fact that the Pierce Brosnan rendition of 007 will tool around in a V-12 Vanquish in “Die Another Day,” the next (20th) in the series that reaches the screens in November.\n\nThe British secret agent first drove an Aston Martin in 1964 (“Goldfinger”), a DB5 with such options as ejector seats and rockets, but not a single cupholder.\n\nHe next drove a DB5 in 1965 (“Thunderball”), a DBS in 1969 (“On Her Majesty’s Secret Service”), a DBS in 1971 (“Diamonds are Forever”) and a Vantage V-8 in 1987 (“The Living Daylights”) but hasn’t driven an Aston Martin since a DB5 in 1995 (“Goldeneye”).\n\nAutomakers salivate to have one of their new machines exposed to the public in a film and pay dearly for the right to drool uncontrollably.\n\nAston Martin won’t say how much it had to pony up to get Bond’s butt in the leather bucket of the $230,000 Vanquish. Aston Martin insisted that the filmmaker approached it, and that it didn’t go hat (and checkbook) in hand to the filmmaker. But despite being courted, Aston Martin did pay a dowry.\n\nShould the Aston Martin in the Bond film motivate you to run down to the store to pick up a copy of your hero’s wheels, prepare to be shaken if not stirred–even if you have the $230,000–when the salesman asks you to come back in three to four years.\n\nThe V-12 Vanquish, introduced for ’02, is sold out for the next two years–and there’s an 18-month waiting list for those that won’t be assembled until three years from now.\n\nOf the 500 cars to be built each of the next two years, only 170 are earmarked each year for the U.S. market.\n\nThe V-12 Vanquish is powered by a 6-liter, 460-horsepower V-12 with a 6-speed manual and claims a zero- to 100-m.p.h. time of less than 10 seconds.\n\nThe V-12 is offered as a two-seater or a 2-plus-2 coupe. But neither ejector seats nor rockets are available. No cupholder either.\n\nCO {-2} ratings\n\nA report issued by Environmental Defense, a New York-based nonprofit group that claims 300,000 dues-paying members, says when it comes to polluting the atmosphere, General Motors is the No. 1 offender.\n\nBut the study was flawed.\n\nThe group based its finding on measuring the carbon dioxide produced by new vehicles sold each year. It didn’t follow each car with vials to catch exhaust fumes, an impossibility with only 300,000 members, but used a formula based on sales and fuel-economy ratings.\n\nThe GM fleet imposed the largest “carbon burden” by producing 6.7 million metric tons per year, followed by Ford at 5.6 million tons and DaimlerChrysler at 4.1 million tons.\n\nWhile GM was carbon burdener No. 1 in amount dispensed, it ranked 5th in the percentage increase in 10 years.\n\nToyota, maker of the gas/electric Prius, “posted the m ost rapid growth in global warming pollution,” the study said, with its carbon burden growing 72 percent between 1990 and 2000, compared with 33 percent growth for all automakers. Prius wasn’t the cause, of course, rather it was all the trucks and sport-utility vehicles Toyota has introduced since ’90.\n\nToyota was followed by DaimlerChrysler with a 61 percent increase between 1990-2000; Ford, 25.8 percent; Honda, 22.1 percent; GM, 12.8 percent; and Nissan, 12.4 percent.\n\nThe study is flawed because if the metric tons released by new vehicles are less than the metric tons released by old vehicles, you get a net benefit. The study didn’t report on the amount of CO {-2} that wasn’t released each time a new GM or Ford or Toyota or Honda replaced an older one with outdated emission controls.\n\nAnd the study didn’t mention that new vehicles with anti-lock brakes, traction control and air bags tend to be safer than old vehicles.\n\nMaybe next time.",
