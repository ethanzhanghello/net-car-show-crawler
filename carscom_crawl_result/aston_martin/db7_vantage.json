      "expert_review": "Spend a week driving the car that James Bond drove, and you come away not at all shaken, but certainly stirred &#151; the opposite of 007’s martinis.\n\nWelcome to the driver’s seat of the Aston Martin DB7 Vantage, a nine-layers-of-paint, hand-treated piece of rolling art that just happens to have a V-12 engine.\n\nHow not to be stirred by a car that, with incredible subtlety, will move you to 185 miles per hour, although there was no racetrack, no desert floor, no permission from the manufacturer available this week to test the alleged top speed, so I’ll have to take Aston Martin’s word on it.\n\nFew of us will ever get to drive an Aston Martin. Fewer still will ever own one, in part because of the $153,000 price tag.\n\nConsider that in its 88 years of existence, Aston Martin has produced only about 18,000 vehicles. Consider that the DB7, introduced in 1993, accounts for 5,000 of those vehicles and you realize its importance to the company. And consider that of the 1,500 or so DB7s sold each year, fewer than 400 are sold in the United States.\n\nThat explains why every time I stopped to pick up the newspaper at my local store &#151; Liar’s Paradise &#151; I’d come back out to find a few folks, young and old alike, gathered around the car. Or why, out on a photo shoot with a Globe photographer at my local boat launch, a horde of teenagers launching canoes for an outing on Pawtuckaway Lake, left their teachers to the tasks and rallied ’round the Vantage, asking that the hood be popped. Or why, delivering my children to soccer, softball, and baseball games (swell team bus, huh?), we’d be surrounded before we even cracked a door.\n\nLike all cars I drive, I used this one as a family car.\n\nOf course, not many family cars have engines that produce 420 horsepower and 400 lb.-ft. of torque.\n\nNot many have engines imbued with Ford/Cosworth technology: 6.0-liter, lightweight aluminum cast alloy with four valves per cylinder, twin overhead cams on each bank of cylinders, and produced at Cosworth Technology’s limited production plant in England &#151; the same place that turns out Cosworth V-10 Formula 1 racing engines and turbocharged, V-8 Indy car engines.\n\nAnd not many family cars drenched with power and luxury as standard features offer such options as custom-designed luggage, an umbrella holder, and an extended cargo area, or, as Aston Martin describes it, &quot;individual accommodation for the carriage of family pets.&quot; Like Fifi or Spike will be yapping, barking, or shedding in my DB7 Vantage.\n\nThe DB7, offered in coupe form, as tested, or as a roadster called the Vantage Volante, comes with either a six-speed manual transmission or a five-speed automatic &#151; again, as tested.\n\nThis powertrain was tested in development by running a prototype at 165 miles per hour for a 48-hour test period. That’s some endurance testing and driving.\n\nThere is not much that is overtly complex about this car. Subtlety abounds, if that is not an oxymoron. There is no cruise control, for instance. You drive at all times. Yet beneath its nine coats of paint, a lot of high technology looms, mainly in the form of a Visteon electronics system capable of handling 1.6 million commands per second. It monitors activities from fuel injection to traction control, from security to exhaust emissions, from ignition to engine diagnosis.\n\nThe result is a car that, while being driven as an everyday car, gives no hint that it is ready to run with the fastest, the twitchiest, the most temperamental, the most transparently brutal high performance cars in the world.\n\nYou can cruise sedately. You can pound pedal to the metal. And even while engaging in the latter, the Vantage keeps its grace about it. It does not whip you back into the seat. It positions you there. It does not roar in full throttle to announce its power. It burbles a basso.\n\nA friend asked me which other car I would compare this to.\n\nMy answer: None.\n\nThat’s because it is not obviously a sports car such as a Porsche or Ferrari. It is certainly not a big luxury cruiser such as a Bentley or Maybach.\n\nInstead, it has the fun potential and lurking power of the first pair, the elegance and grace of the last. Some combination.\n\nThe engineering is matched by an exterior design that is subtle as well. There are no big air scoops, no stabilizing wings, no muscular and bulging fenders. The winged Aston Martin badge is perhaps the most eye-catching giveaway for those not familiar with the shape of the car.\n\nInside, nothing is subtle. The tan-and-green leather seats &#151; Aston Martin calls it &quot;hide,&quot; not leather &#151; are soft at the buttocks, firmly bolstered along thighs and torso. The stitching in all that leather, even the leather seams on the dash, is a perfect example of craftsmanship. Burnished wood appointments, chrome trim for gauges, even a green suede roof, cocoon you in utter luxury.\n\nThe rear seats are really for use only in necessity (or if your kids insist on being driven to their sporting events in an eye-catching car). In fact, if I were to own the DB7 coupe (please Mr. Editor, more pay, sir?) I’d get it with the optional extra luggage space, which eliminates the rear seats.\n\nThe trunk will not hold even one bag of golf clubs. But of course, if you own this car, you have a set in the locker at each exclusive club to which you belong.\n\nIn fact, hauling three soccer players to a game, I discovered I could fit a bag of only five soccer balls and a medical kit inside. Again, if I owned this, I probably would not be coaching kiddie soccer because I’d be playing for Real Madrid and I’d be driving the DB7 home to my palace in the Spanish hills each night.\n\nThe name Vantage has been used to indicate the highest performance version of Aston Martin models since 1950. That’s when the car maker differentiated the 120-horsepower engine in the DB2 from the 105-horsepower engine.\n\nMy, how times and horsepower change.\n\nNice touch: The analog clock at center dash. Another simple, yet telling, mark of elegance.\n\nAnnoyance: The automatic seat controls at the outer base of each front seat. Tiny little buttons. Fingers barely fit between seat and rocker panel.",

      "expert_review": "And as for that martini – shaken, not stirred.\n\nBehind the wheel of a 2002 Aston Martin DB7 Vantage, I did not feel like James Bond, who introduced the English sports cars to the great unwashed in the 1964 film Goldfinger. That car was an Aston Martin DB5, with machine guns up front, an oil slick dispenser in back, ejector seats in the middle.\n\nI would, however, have required several martinis – shaken, stirred, whatever – had I scratched up the DB7 Vantage, which lists for, including the $350 lamb’s wool floor mats, $156,285. The car seemed slightly resentful, eventually showing it by refusing to unlock unless I used the odd-shaped key.\n\nUnderstandable. It was not used to being parked outside, while the pickup truck got the garage. Frogs crawled under the hood. Frogs! I’m lucky it did not self-destruct in a cloud of Aviemore Blue paint. Or Aysgarth Blue, or Balintyre Blue, or Antrim Blue, or whichever color it was. I am pretty sure it was blue. Or green.\n\nAnyway, such details do not matter when you roll down the window, snick the six-speed manual transmission into first gear, and apply expensive pressure to the accelerator. The 6.0-liter, 420-horsepower V-12 engine just wails, an unbridled sound as sweet as a Ferrari, as seductive as Ursula Andress or Britt Ekland or whoever is sharing a bubble bath with Bond. In the next film, it’s Halle Berry, who drives a coral-colored Ford Thunderbird. Berry plays Jinx in Die Another Day, opening Nov. 22. Pierce Brosnan is once again Bond, and he will drive a $230,000 Aston Martin Vanquish, which makes my little Vantage seem like an amusing hood ornament.\n\nAll this exposure is good news for tiny Aston Martin, which seems to be thriving since it was absorbed by Ford. It is, after all, the fastest-growing car company in the U.S., with a 62.8 percent rise in sales during the first six months of 2002. Of course, this being Aston Martin, that means the company has sold 293 cars through June, compared with 180 for the same period last year. In June, Ford sold about 100 pickup trucks an hour. Every hour.\n\nThe basic Vantage has been around for six years, now, and the styling is wearing well. Some think it looks like a Jaguar XK8, but side by side, the difference is substantial. The Vanquish is new for 2002, though, and Ford has confirmed that there is a “baby Aston” in the works, which would likely sell for about $100,000. Expect it by 2005.\n\nInside our DB7, as you would suspect, the leather is luscious, the wood perfect, the lamb’s wool mats – woolly. Oddly, unhook the mats to clean them, and there’s just unpainted car body underneath. Jarring. But I suppose not to servants, who would normally handle such tasks, and who were unfortunately indisposed when I needed to shake out the crumbs from a particularly explosive Cheesy Gordita Crunch.\n\nThe DB7 is technically a four-passenger car, but the rear seats are so abbreviated that they seem a waste of Connolly leather. The trun k is large enough for a set or two of Pings. (Those are fine, costly golf clubs. I am free-associating now.)\n\nThe DB7 Vantage is pretty much a vice-less supercar, capable of extended, and very comfortable, highway touring; spirited and rewarding performance on winding roads; and complaint-free shuttling around town. On the test car, the clutch was pretty stiff – in an extended stop-and-go traffic jam, it would have given the left leg a workout. An automatic transmission is available for an extra $5,030.\n\nThe DB7’s base price is $146,350, but some options, such as an upgraded Becker sound system, a navigation system and drilled aluminum foot pedals raised the price to $156,285. Is it worth it? I have no idea. But nearly 300 people thought an Aston was a good buy in the first six months of 2002, and I am not about to argue with good taste.",
