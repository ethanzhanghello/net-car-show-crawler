      "expert_review": "The verdict: The DBX is an outstanding first-ever SUV from a luxury coupe brand held back only slightly by already-outdated interior electronics.\n\nVersus the competition: Just as stylish, customizable, fun to drive and head-turning as any of its high-dollar competitors — and only a little more fussy to drive on a daily basis.\n\nHas the Porsche Cayenne Turbo gotten too common? Is the Bentley Bentayga too flashy? Is the Lamborghini Urus just a little too much for you? Is Mercedes-AMG’s G-Class just a bit too … boxy? Well, hang on to your Gucci slippers, there’s a new player in town.\n\nRelated: What’s New With SUVs for 2021?\n\nCombining the style of a sports car with the ride height of an SUV, the 2021 Aston Martin DBX is a totally new effort from a brand known for stylish, expensive grand touring coupes (and the occasional oddball sedan). The DBX is a five-seat, mid-size ultra-luxury SUV that’s just as pricey as those aforementioned competitors, equipped with a powerful V-8 engine sourced from Mercedes-Benz. Covered in bodywork inspired by Aston Martin’s cars, with a plush, leather-swathed cabin, the DBX is athletic, muscular, stylish — and rare. It’s an interesting option for drivers who don’t want just another Porsche Cayenne. But is it as good as the segment’s stalwarts?\n\nSlinky Bodywork\n\nThe idea of a sports car company creating a big, off-road-capable SUV was scandalous when Porsche first did it, but criticism dried up quickly when Cayenne sales took off. Now, some two decades later, the idea of an Aston Martin SUV isn’t exactly outrageous.\n\nThe stylists at Aston Martin certainly did their job, creating a look for the DBX that clearly identifies itself from 100 feet away. It sports the Aston family grille and headlights, and an upturned ducktail in back easily references the latest Vantage coupe. The DBX is a testament to what careful attention to proportions and blacked-out areas can do to make a tall SUV look like a swoopy, racy coupe; with a tall greenhouse and acres of vertical sheet metal, the DBX could easily have looked bulbous, ungainly and awkward, but black on the lower body sills and roof create negative space. Its roofline peaks at the top of the windshield and descends from there to the liftgate. Both of these tricks are likewise employed by the Ford Mustang Mach-E in an attempt to make an SUV look like a sporty coupe — and they work.\n\nThe overall look sort of resembles a five-fourths scale Ford Escape, and that’s not a bad thing. (Tell me the Ford Fusion and Aston Martin Rapide don’t have that same resemblance.) Most important for a vehicle like this, the DBX turns heads — even in the rather unflattering Stratus White color my test vehicle was painted. The SUV just looks really good, with a presence that would easily put it out front at a fancy restaurant or ritzy nightclub, maybe next to a Lamborghini Urus. A vehicle this expensive should be unique, and the DBX manages to achieve that without being gaudy or ungainly like a Bentley Bentayga.\n\nBritish Style, German Muscle\n\nThe beating heart of the Aston Martin DBX might already be familiar to luxury car fans: a Mercedes-AMG-sourced twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 engine. It’s tuned to Aston’s liking, with a unique exhaust note that makes it sound considerably healthier and more vociferous than any AMG vehicle I’ve heard it in. Thus tuned, mated to a nine-speed automatic transmission and permanent all-wheel drive, it packs a 542-horsepower punch. This is the standard engine in the DBX (the more powerful DBX707 has just been unveiled), and Aston Martin says it gets the big SUV from 0-60 mph in 4.3 seconds on its way to a top speed of 181 mph.\n\nBut those are just numbers on paper. The visceral experience of the V-8 is so much more; it’s a fantastic powertrain that’s able to trundle around town without much drama, as well as move the big SUV in ways you wouldn’t expect.\n\nThe driving experience in the DBX is mostly outstanding. It’s quiet when you want it to be, like flying down an interstate at high speed, then rowdy and raucous when you don’t want serenity, like when peeling away from a stoplight to entertain the kids in back. The steering is surprisingly heavy in terms of effort, but it provides rewarding feedback for a vehicle like this.\n\nOddly, the same thing cannot be said of the brakes, which are soft and mushy. They don’t provide much confidence — something you generally want more of in a vehicle with this much potential speed and heft. Ride quality is exemplary for a sport-oriented vehicle thanks to an adjustable air suspension and electronic active roll control, proving the mission for the DBX is similar to the one assigned to Aston Martin’s coupes: It’s a grand touring car, not a pure sports machine.\n\nThe DBX is meant to deliver both comfort and entertainment, never forgetting its luxury roots nor straying too far into cushy Bentley territory. It can even go off-road courtesy all-wheel drive and the ability to raise itself on its air suspension. Given that it comes with standard summer tires, however, the idea of a DBX seeing anything more challenging than a gravel driveway is laughable. Just keep it on the pavement, where its bespoke Aston Martin SUV platform and styling combine with that Mercedes powertrain and suspension technology to make an unquestionable success. With the lone exception of the brakes, this is a fantastic machine to drive.\n\nOpulence and Obstinance\n\nThe cabin is pure Aston Martin, and that’s both a good and a bad thing. There’s sumptuous leather slathered over just about everything, and it’s stitched, quilted and patterned in ways that make it obvious this is a hand-built British luxury machine, not a mass-produced generic crossover. It looks and feels special inside, from the gorgeous, plush seats front and rear to Aston Martin’s unique buttons and gauges. And don’t let these photos of my test car’s deep black interior fool you: There are some vivid interior options that are far more striking than the dour black hides in my test DBX. That said, it also feels like many of Aston’s coupes inside, with flimsy climate vents, plasticky buttons and switches that aren’t quite as slick as they should be.\n\nNow the really bad part: It seems the powertrain isn’t the only bit of kit that Aston Martin borrowed from Mercedes — it took the electronics and multimedia systems, too. Apparently, Mercedes wasn’t feeling quite as generous here, as it didn’t sell Aston Martin its latest and greatest MBUX system. Instead, the DBX uses a multimedia system based on the automaker’s former COMAND system, which is nearly a decade out of date — making it a surprising find in a brand-new, clean-sheet SUV.\n\nWhy is this bad? Because it simply doesn’t work nearly as well as the latest systems on the market. For instance, its 10-inch multimedia display isn’t a touchscreen; you have to use either the steering-wheel controls or a rotary controller in the center console to move around the screen — an approach now abandoned by nearly every other automaker. Connecting a mobile device was only sporadically successful, and finding functions I wanted required knowledge of the menus and a lot of exploration — not easy to do on the fly. Apple CarPlay is present, but using it without a touchscreen is tedious. Aston Martin should’ve kept shopping for a supplier in this department; Polestar’s system, using Google OS, is a good example of what can be done with a third-party provider.\n\nIn short, the Aston Martin DBX is a truly rewarding and entertaining SUV to drive, but a fussy and disappointing one to use. Such foibles are not as big a deal on the automaker’s low-volume specialty luxury coupes, but five-seat luxury SUVs tend to get a lot more daily use, meaning multimedia systems, phone connectivity and general user-friendliness become much more important. It’s in these areas that the DBX needs to improve to be truly competitive with the likes of Bentley, Mercedes-Benz and Porsche.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nAston Martin Extends Warranty Coverage During Coronavirus Pandemic\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto: Where Are They Now?\n2021 Bentley Bentayga Review: Upgrading the Upgraded\n2019 Lamborghini Urus First Drive: Supercar Cattle-Prodding an SUV\nMore Luxury News\nPriced to Compete\n\nThe 2021 DBX starts at $179,986, including the most jaw-dropping destination and delivery fee I’ve ever seen ($3,086). The base price does at least include a decent number of automatic safety systems, which is something you don’t often see in German competitors. Automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning and steering assist, adaptive cruise control and blind spot warning are all standard on the DBX.\n\nThe areas where options are available tend to be about personalization. My test vehicle included nearly $38,000 worth of options, mostly for things like paint, stitching, interior colors, black trim pieces and wood inlays. The final price tag was $218,386 — a hefty sum, but it’s the price one pays for such personalization. More importantly, it’s in line with competitors like the Bentayga, G-Class, Urus and top trims of the Cayenne.\n\nThe DBX is a surprisingly good first-ever SUV from Aston Martin. It’s a sexy, stylish and entertaining alternative for affluent SUV buyers who simply want something different. The success of its mission — providing a highly lucrative and much-needed revenue stream for the luxury automaker (a strategy that worked brilliantly for Porsche) — seems all but guaranteed. With a few more tweaks to usability and some updated tech, it would be an easy choice to make.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Stunning to look at, rewarding to drive and rarer than most of its competitors, the revised 2025 Aston Martin DBX707 is a pricey but worthy ultra-luxury SUV.\n\nVersus the competition: The DBX707 easily holds its own against competitors like the Lamborghini Urus and Mercedes-AMG GLE63 in terms of performance and exclusivity, but it does exhibit some usability quirks that come with a boutique manufacturer.\n\nThe Aston Martin DBX SUV debuted for 2021 as both the company’s first five-seat passenger vehicle and its first SUV. For 2025, it’s received its first big refresh and now sports a new interior, a new multimedia system and an upgraded engine. But as you must ask with any vehicle like this from an exotic manufacturer (Ferrari, Lamborghini, Porsche, Rolls-Royce and Bentley), does an Aston Martin SUV really make sense? Or is it just a cash-grab for a company otherwise reliant on a segment — specialty sports cars — that just isn’t as popular today as it once was? Or can it be both?\n\nWell, given the success these brands have had with this idea thus far (look at Porsche), we’re pretty sure it can be both. And after some time in the significantly updated 2025 Aston Martin DBX707, we’re pretty sure the formula that’s cooked up some solid profits and development money for so many other small-volume exotic carmakers works just fine here, too.\n\n2025 Aston Martin DBX707, rear | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nRelated: 2025 Aston Martin DBX: Fully Committed to 707, Freshened Interior\n\nWould You Look if It Wasn’t That Color?\n\nLet’s get this out of the way right from the start: Our 2025 test vehicle is a color Aston Martin calls Photon Lime Metallic, and that’s the perfect name for it. From some angles, in certain light, it’s lime green. From other angles, in different light, it’s lemon yellow. Either way, it’s stunning from every angle; pictures don’t do it justice. In direct sunlight, it’s positively fluorescent; it radiates like that thing Homer drops in the opening credits of “The Simpsons,” and I absolutely do not hate it. It turns heads in a way a $13K paint job should (and yes, you read that correctly, this paint is a $13,600 option). It’s a flawless paint job — no orange peel, no rippling. This Aston Martin is properly painted, and it’s refreshing to see.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nThe rest of the styling is also properly Aston Martin: This is one of the best executions I’ve seen of adapting a company’s coupe styling aesthetic to a large SUV. The proportions are correct from tip to tail. The grille — the largest one Aston has ever fitted to a vehicle — looks fantastic. The optional 23-inch wheels are dramatic and imposing. The only thing I might forgo is the silly carbon-fiber trim; all carbon fiber does is proclaim you spent money on a useless decoration. It doesn’t make the DBX707 any lighter, it just makes it more expensive — in this model’s case, $35,000 more expensive. And no, that isn’t a typo, either: This Aston Martin SUV has $35,800 in carbon-fiber trim options inside and out, and that’s just daft.\n\nUnder the Hood: Why 707?\n\nAston Martin made some updates to the DBX’s powertrain for the 2025 model year, upgrading all versions to the 707 designation that previously denoted a higher-performance trim level. Under the nuclear-citrus hood of our test car was a Mercedes-Benz-derived, twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 that’s been heavily massaged by the Aston Martin folks, with new turbochargers and other parts that help it produce 697 horsepower and 664 pounds-feet of torque. But wait a minute — why, then, is it called the DBX707? Well, 707 is the engine’s output in the continental European measure of horsepower, called “PS” or “Pferdestarke,” which is German for horsepower. But because it’s metric horsepower, the number is 1.4% higher than the freedom-unit horsepower we use here in ‘Murica.\n\nThe DBX’s new, boosted V-8 is mated to a modified Mercedes-Benz nine-speed wet-clutch automatic transmission that drives all four wheels. An electronic limited-slip rear differential keeps things stable and helps put all that power to the pavement.\n\nThe DBX’s chassis and body construction is unique, as well; the whole thing is made out of bonded-aluminum extrusions and composites to keep weight down. There are quad exhaust tips out back, wrapped in a carbon-fiber lower valence, and carbon-ceramic brake discs sit at each wheel. The DBX707 isn’t built like a rugged off-road SUV; it’s built like one of Aston Martin’s glorious grand-touring coupes. Aston Martin says it’s all good for a 0-60 mph run of 3.1 seconds and a top speed of 193 mph. That puts it in direct competition with the Lamborghini Urus and Ferrari’s Purosangue; it provides a sportier experience than, say, a Bentley Bentayga or Rolls-Royce Cullinan, and it delivers more exclusivity than a Mercedes-AMG GLE63 or BMW X5 M. (For nearly twice the price, mind you.)\n\n2025 Aston Martin DBX707, engine | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\nHow It Works\n\nThe DBX707 doesn’t drive like a typical SUV; it feels more like a tall wagon version of an Aston Martin coupe. Steering is firm, with some heft, and provides excellent feedback. Power from the twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8 engine is immense, but we’re not entirely thrilled with the nine-speed automatic. It feels tuned for calmer, lazier responses, so any stab at the go-pedal — even in Sport mode — results in a half-a-tick wait while the computers decide what to do. It occasionally gets a little confused, too; letting off the gas quickly, for example, can lead to some driveline lash.\n\nOnce you start driving aggressively, though, the DBX707 responds beautifully. It’s easily as engaging as its competitors, but in the grand-touring style of luxurious vehicles. It’s quick, but it doesn’t beat you up even in Sport mode, and the ride and handling balance prioritizes comfort over sharpness, which is really what you want in an SUV. Despite its equipment, this isn’t a track monster; it’s meant for powerful, sophisticated street-motoring duty — and, let’s be honest here, to be seen in. Nobody paints a car this color not to be seen in it.\n\n2025 Aston Martin DBX707, center stack display | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nJust like the experience of operating the multimedia system (more on that in a moment), however, the experience of driving this beast is not without its quirks, most of which have to do with the fact that the DBX is largely engineered for foreign markets. What does that mean? Well, take its advanced driver-assist systems. They’re designed for the U.K. market, which means it includes a feature that reads speed-limit signs and beeps at you if you exceed the posted limit. Every time. You can turn it off, but it doesn’t stay turned off — you have to turn it off every time you start the engine. Same with every other safety system, including a too-sensitive lane departure steering assist feature that’s always buzzing at you. An Aston Martin representative told us they’re working on a software release (hopefully coming in late 2024) that will make “off” the default setting for this speed-limit annoyance. Let’s hope that’s happening, because it is annoying to the point of being a deal breaker — if the sticker price hasn’t already put you off, that is.\n\nOh, and California-dwelling readers? Your state is currently considering legislation to make speed-limit systems like this required in new cars sold in the state by 2030. Write your congressperson now, because you do not want this — you seriously don’t.\n\n2025 Aston Martin DBX707, instrument panel | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\nA Beautiful Interior\n\nAston Martin made a lot of changes to this SUV’s interior for 2025, mostly having to do with the electronics. Just like the powertrain, some of the DBX707’s electronics are borrowed from Mercedes-Benz, but it’s a lot less obvious now than it was in the previous version of the car. Only a few switches really give it away now, including an awful touch-sensitive thumb square on the steering wheel. There’s a new 10.25-inch touchscreen front and center, which honestly feels a little small these days, but we don’t mind it because it means Aston Martin hasn’t given in to the generally German trend of “technology equals luxury;” it still sees screens as visual control aids, not design elements. A 12.3-inch digital dash display gets new graphics, as well; it’s reasonably reconfigurable, the graphics are big and easy to read, and it looks good.\n\nThe artistry of the DBX’s interior really grabs you. It’s comfortable, yes, but so much care went into the shapes on the dash, the deep-blue “Dark Knight” leather upholstery with lime-green piping, and the stitching on the seats and doors. The materials throughout the interior are incredible, including metal speaker grilles for the Bowers & Wilkins audio system. It’s all just stunning to behold. There’s also plenty of room up front and in the backseat, despite a bit of a transmission hump in the center of the rear footwell.\n\nBut as nice as it is, it’s not perfect. The new multimedia system is better than the last one, which was clearly just a reskin of the old Mercedes-Benz Comand system, but there are still some quirks with the electronics. The multimedia home screen information display, for one, is tiny, in spite of all the screen real estate Aston Martin had to work with. Why is it just a little square of hard-to-read information surrounded by dead space? And maybe I’m just quibbling, but you try changing satellite radio channels using that awful Mercedes-sourced thumb-square — every time you want to change the channel, it starts at the beginning of the list, not where you are on the station roster. If you’re on channel 36 and want to go to channel 40, you have to scroll, scroll, scroll all the way from channel 1, every time. It’s little things like this that show the new electronics could have used a little more development and testing before their rollout.\n\n2025 Aston Martin DBX707, center stack display | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nUndead Another Day: Aston Martin Vanquish Returns (Again)\n2025 Aston Martin Vantage: Even More Crazy and Beautiful\nAston Martin DB12 Looks Awfully Familiar, Debuts With 671 HP\nResearch the 2025 Aston Martin DBX707\nShop for a 2025 Aston Martin DBX707\nSticker Shock\n\nSo what price does this kind of posh, sophisticated, luxurious and unique driving experience command? The DBX707 starts just north of $250,000 and can very easily be optioned up to the level of my test car, which stickered at $350,500. That’s right, the 2025 DBX707 I drove had $100,000 in options, including crazy stuff like a $12,300 Bowers & Wilkins audio system, the previously mentioned $35K+ for carbon-fiber trim and the (admittedly lovely) $13,600 paint job. Of course, you can just as easily option up its competitors in the same way, so it’s not out of line for what you’re getting here.\n\nIs it worth it? Well, the exclusivity of the Aston Martin DBX707 suggests it is. Aston Martin only sells about 3,000 of these a year, so it’s highly unlikely you’ll see another one at the country club or valet stand. It certainly makes a statement; fun-to-drive and beautifully sculpted, it’s a worthy addition to a garage that maybe already has an Aston Martin sports car inside, but is now in need of some family-hauling capability. Is it going to make you look and feel like a super spy when you roll up to the Burger King drive-thru? No, but it’s still going to make you feel special.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Key Points in This Review:\nThe most powerful, capable and expensive Aston Martin DBX, the S is the best of the breed.\nThe new DBX S is lighter than the DBX707 if equipped correctly\nShort of the Porsche Cayenne Turbo GT, it feels more capable than any SUV available today.\n\nIn the market for an SUV? Lucky you: So long as you’ve got the cash, you can find just about every type of lifted four-door imaginable. We’ve got it stupid good these days; just 15 years ago, sourcing an SUV that handled curves with any composure restricted you to a BMW, Porsche or Mercedes-Benz. If you wanted to haul the fam in a four-door Aston Martin, your only option was the lovely but cramped Rapide sedan. Now, the everything-to-everyone Aston Martin DBX is the British brand’s top (bull)dog in sales — and performance-oriented SUVs are everywhere.\n\nRelated: 2026 Aston Martin DBX S Adds Power, Carbon Fiber\n\nEven so, SUVs are almost universally consumer-grade stuff. Most automakers aren’t investing in low-production, experimental few-offs here — just give the people what they want. But what the people want in the upper-luxury performance SUV segment, according to Aston, is more of everything; more options, more personalization and more performance. Enter the Aston Martin DBX S. A new variant based on — and positioned above — the DBX707, it’s the sharpest and most powerful version of the brand’s SUV.\n\n2026 Aston Martin DBX S, rear angle | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\nWhat’s the Difference Between an Aston Martin DBX707 and DBX S?\nTakeaway: The S gets a bit more power, retuned steering, revised transmission tuning and a comprehensive options list with lightweight components.\n\nThe formula here is the same as in Aston’s past S variants: less weight, more power. Compared with the 707, some 104 pounds are cut by selecting certain options — 42 pounds from the magnesium wheels, 40 pounds from the carbon-fiber roof, 15 from carbon-fiber exterior trim and 7 from the front grille. The lightest DBX S commands the heaviest sticker; the magnesium wheels alone add $22,300 to the final tally.\n\nAston’s online configurator is coy on pricing — if you have to ask, etc. — but based on the decadent build sheet for my $397,900 test car, these lightweight components will cost you roughly $500 per pound saved. More into creature comforts and style? Aston will gladly bring your books into the red with an options list that includes a $12,000 Bowers & Wilkins sound system and a $14,900 unique S pinstripe livery.\n\nIf you wish, you can configure your new S to look a lot like an upfitted 707, but there’s a raft of under-the-skin stuff that ensures the changes go well beyond a simple badge job. New turbos sourced from the Valhalla hypercar push the boosted 4.0-liter V-8 to 717 horsepower and an unchanged 664 pounds-feet of torque, keeping the 707’s claimed 3.3-second 0-62 mph run. Its 0-124 mph run, however, is shaved down by 0.3 second, and the S takes a full second off the 707’s 62-155 mph gauntlet.\n\nIt’s nothing mind-blowing in the (extra) power department, but this, in concert with everything else, is what earns that crimson “S” badge. Its steering is retuned and quicker; engineers say the new ratio is 5% faster than before and negates the need for rear-wheel steering, a function found in other performance SUVs. The 707’s shocks are tweaked to balance the new steering setup, as are Sport and Sport+ drive modes that are now more aggressive and holistically sharper than before.\n\n2026 Aston Martin DBX S, front row | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\nHow Is the 2026 Aston Martin DBX S to Live With?\nTakeaway: An indulgent interior and well-composed air suspension cut a perfect balance between Bentley luxe and Ferrari sharpness.\n\nThat’s the new-new, but the DBX’s prior dynamic genes carry over. The SUV’s proprietary platform still incorporates a double-wishbone front and multilink rear air suspension, backed by standard carbon-ceramic brake discs measuring a whopping 16.5 inches in front and 15.4 inches in back. The 285-wide front and 325-wide rear summer performance tires are equally at home summiting the driveway at your Malibu (maybe Miami, maybe Monaco) manse as they are tackling a track day.\n\nOur first crack at the DBX S saw us far from a pit lane. We pointed this uber-SUV toward a web of squiggled country roads rushing northwest of Santa Barbara into the Santa Ynez area of California, crisscrossing a network of meandering two-lanes that cut equally between open crop fields in the foothills to tight, technical passes hung cliffside. Tacked onto both ends was a good half-hour on the highway, where the DBX’s mundane side shined.\n\nS or not, the heart of the DBX remains in step with Aston’s indelible grand-touring ethos: Aside from some faint tire noise, a firm suspension, slightly grabby brakes and the unmistakable background roil of the V-8, this nuclear-grade SUV is about as comfortable in traffic as a Porsche Cayenne Turbo or BMW X5 M Competition. The interior, though, is a cut far, far above those mass-market sleds, with acres of primo cowhide, matte carbon fiber and metal trim that matches the automaker’s $400,000-plus Vanquish for fit, finish and presentation.\n\n2026 Aston Martin DBX S, wheel | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\nHow Does the 2026 Aston Martin DBX S Drive?\nTakeaway: The new DBX S is one of the sharpest, most capable and most thrilling SUVs at any price.\n\nIt’s comfortable even when you hit the jet-boil. That 3.3-second 0-62 mph scoot is as physical as it is theatrical, with a full-throttle launch lifting the nose slightly and drenching a good square mile with its ferocious thunder. The heart of the 4.0-liter V-8 is still sourced from Aston’s technical partner Mercedes-AMG, but the Brits have done a commendable and effective job differentiating it from both a sound and character perspective. I’ve always liked AMG’s potent V-8, but it’s often been more brutally effective than characterful, spouting a metallic, antiseptic soundtrack that’s more mechanical than sonorous.\n\nThe DBX S has no such problem. It’s pure Euro-muscle, a raucous clash sharing the same tonality and raw edge as Aston’s Vantage — an unsurprising similarity given the shared powertrain. Perhaps my favorite bit of the S is its removal of the secondary rev limiter that restricted revs to around 3,500 rpm or so while in park. DBX owners are (unsurprisingly) not shrinking violets, and more than a few specifically requested the ability to rev the (lug)nuts off their new toy. We’re happy to report the change works quite well (much to the chagrin of local golfers trying to enjoy Santa Barbara’s perfect summer weather).\n\nIt certainly sounds every bit of 717 hp, and it moves like it, too; forward pace matches the hotshot Lamborghini Urus and Cayenne Turbo both on paper and in feel, with enough grip and canyon confidence to equal any super-SUV this side of the shocking Porsche Cayenne Turbo GT. And when that straight turns into, well, a turn, it’s easily one of the sharpest-driving SUVs available at any price, though the same can be said of the DBX707.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nHands-On With Apple CarPlay Ultra: The New Killer App?\n2025 Aston Martin DBX707 Review: Behold Bond’s Family Wagon\n2025 Aston Martin DBX: Fully Committed to 707, Freshened Interior\nWhich SUVs Can Tow at Least 5,000 Pounds?\nWhich Automaker Owns Your Luxury Brand?\nShould You Upgrade From a DBX707 to the New Aston Martin DBX S?\nTakeaway: Opting for the S likely won’t be worth it for many buyers, but those on the fence — or those who have the original 542-hp DBX — will find the DBX S lives up to its 717-hp rating. \n\nWithout back-to-back wheel time in a 707, it’s difficult to say just how much of a difference the optional lightweighting makes on the S, but its baseline capability is remarkable for something with four doors, a usable cargo area and a (token) terrain mode. Turn-in and subsequent steering feel is as sharp as any modern hot hatch; there’s truth in Aston’s claim of full rear-wheel-drive power transfer revealed during moments of moderate rear-end squirm under power.\n\nThe S’ air suspension tuning is excellent from both a composure and comfort perspective, demonstrating compliance over fractured pavement without a hint of wallow when hurled across tighter roads. Brakes are arguably the most important component for a fast SUV, and the S’ standard carbon-ceramic discs drop speed like you’re smashing into a bollard. Entirely fade-free and mostly progressive in application, they’re stout enough to haul you down from triple highway speeds with the full family and dog in tow — not that you should do that.\n\nFor a core set of buyers, we expect this to be their first dalliance into Aston Martin ownership, and the marque seems perfectly content with that, provided they can shape them into repeat customers. It’s the most approachable and usable Aston, without losing its exotic appeal, and it’s on the top, top rung of performance SUVs.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
