      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nIntroduced at the 2003 Frankfurt Motor Show in Germany, Aston Martin’s newest two-passenger coupe supersedes the long-lived DB7 Vantage. Aston Martin describes the DB9’s new aluminum-bonded body frame as “radical.”\n\nThe car holds a 6.0-liter V-12 engine that generates 450 horsepower. Either a conventional six-speed-manual gearbox or a button-controlled six-speed automatic with Touchtronic operation may be installed.\n\nA matching Volante convertible was unveiled at the 2004 North American International Auto Show. The Volante isn’t a coupe with its roof simply snipped off; rather, it was designed and engineered as a convertible from the start.\n\nThe DB9 is the first car to be hand built at a new state-of-the-art facility in Gaydon, Warwickshire, England. The factory combines “cutting-edge high technology with handcraftsmanship and tradition,” said Ulrich Bez, chief executive officer of Aston Martin. The DB9 uses a new VH (Vertical Horizontal) platform.\n\nWeighing a moderate 3,770 pounds, the DB9 can accelerate from zero to 60 mph in a claimed 4.7 seconds with the manual transmission and reach a top speed of 186 mph. Sales begin in the fall of 2004. Aston Martin expects to sell 2,000 DB9s per year, of which half will be Volante convertibles.\n\nExterior\nConsidered a modern interpretation of traditional design, the DB9 has a long aluminum hood that extends all the way to the car’s leading edge. Minimal “cut” lines help enhance the car’s elegant simplicity. A familiar grille and side strakes help establish kinship with previous DB models. The DB9’s wheelbase is 5.9 inches longer and the front track is 2 inches wider than the DB7’s. The wheels measure 19 inches in diameter, and the brake discs are grooved rather than cross-drilled.\n\nThe car’s body panels are all made of aluminum or lightweight composites. Magnesium is used for the steering column, inner doorframes and gear selector paddles. Cast aluminum is used for the windshield surround, which Aston Martin says is an industry “first.”\n\nPlacing the gearbox at the rear helps achieve a 50/50 weight distribution, front to rear. The wishbone suspension is made of lightweight aluminum, and dampers are aluminum-bodied. A full undertray reduces lift and drag. Despite being 25 percent lighter than the DB7’s bodyshell, this structure promises more than twice the structural rigidity of its predecessor.\n\n“Aston Martins are not edgy cars,” said Design Director Henrik Fisker. “They don’t have sharp surfaces or pronounced power domes. … The bodywork is elegant and gently covered, like a supremely fit person with great muscle tone.” Rear haunches are wide and curvaceous, and the profile features a prominent trunk. The door handles are flush with the body, and “swan wing” doors rise at a 12-degree angle for easier access.\n\nThe Volante convertible’s fabric top folds underneath a hard tonneau cover that sits flush with the bodywork. Dropping the top takes 17 seconds. Sensors can detect a potential rollover and deploy twin roll-hoops from the rear-seat headrests. Aston Martin says the windshield A-pillars can withstand twice the car’s body weight. The LED taillamps illuminate quicker than traditional units.\n\nInterior\nThe DB9 offers 2+2 seating. The upholstery is full Bridge of Weir leather and is available in 20 new colors. Wood is used only on the top center part of the dashboard and, as an option, for the door caps. Walnut, mahogany or bamboo is offered.\n\nTo start the engine, the driver must press a clear glass button. The tachometer dial runs counterclockwise and has no conventional redline. Instead, a red warning symbol appears at various engine speeds, depending on ambient temperature and engine mileage.\n\nThe British firm Linn developed the 950-watt 10-speaker music system. A message center in the dashboard has an organic electroluminescent display that offers better resolution and contrast than the usual LCD.\n\nUnder the Hood\nAston Martin’s 6.0-liter V-12 engine produces 450 hp. The ZF drive-by-wire six-speed-automatic transmission has no traditional gear lever. Instead, Drive, Park, Neutral and Reverse are selected by buttons. A Touchtronic manual mode permits gear changes using paddles mounted behind the steering wheel. A conventional Graziano six-speed-manual gearbox is also available.\n\nSafety\nAll-disc antilock brakes incorporate electronic brake-force distribution and Brake Assist. Seat-mounted side-impact airbags and Dynamic Stability Control are standard.\n\nDriving Impressions\nHandling is where the DB9 truly excels. This coupe hangs on with a passion through swift curves and yields confidence levels that reach well beyond the sports-car norm. The suspension follows road contours closely, yet ride comfort is rather good.\n\nThe DB9 delivers a civilized experience and has plenty of amenities. The dashboard is packed with controls for navigation and other electronic operations; most of the markings are clear. The gauges, however, aren’t so easy to read.\n\nThe V-12 engine starts using a button and generates a rich exhaust sound. Gear changes are quite easy using the dashboard selector buttons and steering-wheel paddles, but automatic mode does a fine job, too. After a momentary hesitation to downshift, the DB9 lunges ahead with unbridled force.\n\nRear headroom is scant and legroom is virtually nonexistent, but the front compartment is roomy enough in a snug, separated cockpit. Forward visibility can be a problem, as the front fenders are hard to see. Surprisingly, the rear window provides a helpful view.",

That’s 60 minutes for each cylinder.\n\nWith your phone connected via Bluetooth, you’d call other journalists and casually work in the phrase DB9 as often as possible.\n\n“Dinner? Sure. I can DB9. OK, 8:30 then.”\n\nYou’d drive down Sunset Strip and lean on the horn a little if people didn’t notice you enough.\n\n“Excuse me, didn’t you see the $200,000 wheels I’m riding in like a Hollywood hipster?”\n\nYou might even find yourself sitting in the full grain leather seats, whispering to yourself, “Aston frickin’ Martin.”\n\nThe smile won’t leave you, even after you turn the car back over to the British carmaker.\n\nThis car is the full package: Luxury, performance and more sophistication than a secret agent.\n\nAfter taking the DB9 to the edge of California and watching the sun sink into the Pacific, I looked it over.\n\nYowza.\n\nThis car was created, not built. If God needed wheels, they’d be an Aston Martin DB9 convertible. (And His Holiness would call it a convertible, not a Volante.)\n\nThis car looks like someone took sheet metal and pulled it out like taffy and placed it on Bilstein shocks for good keeping. It’s wind swept with style. All of its lines move horizontally, exaggerating its fast and stable stance. Finally, a car with fender vents that look perfect.\n\nThe five-bar grille made of anodized aluminum across its big mouthed air intake stretches the width of the car. The double horizontally laid LED tail lamps have the same effect on the back end.\n\nThe elongated hood and projector beam xenon headlights pushing back from the bumper almost to the front wheels makes it look even more elegant.\n\nBut it’s the little details that sparkle on the DB9. The green behind the logo. The point on the fender vents that looks as if it’s going to poke a hole in the door when you open it. The body-colored door handles flush with body. It’s a perfectly balanced machine assembled by watchmakers.\n\nAnd the performance responds with similar precision.\n\nThe 6-liter V-12 thunders with power, producing 470 horsepower and 443-pound-feet or torque.\n\nThere are two tones to the engine: A quiet rumble on mild highway driving. People see the car, but don’t really hear it. Then there’s this angry beast that awakens when you find the accelerator.\n\nAlong Mulholland Drive, I opened her up. My brother sounded like Keanu Reeves in the “Matrix” as the engine wailed and we pressed back into our bucket seats. “Whoaa.” The stiff frame — Aston Martin toughened up the car’s platform — and the four-wheel double wishbone independent suspension ate up the road. The ride was exact but not rough. The car’s traction control and electronic stability control kept us on the road instead of in a ditch.\n\nWe looked down and saw the lights of Los Angeles sparkling — we were in a movie of our own making.\n\nThe DB9 comes with two types of transmissions, a manual six-speed and my test vehicle had the six-speed automated manual, which uses paddle shifters mounted on the steering column. What a blast.\n\nHandling tight corners with paddles shifters makes them even more fun. Double click to slow down and keep your car in the power curve. Hold it and blast out of the turn — it feels faster coming out than when you went in.\n\nCruising down some road with canyon in its name, we ended up in 90210 country. The DB9’s interior is nicer than many of the homes we passed.\n\nIt’s conservative and beautiful. There’s nothing ostentatious about it. You appreciate the curve of the die cast zinc center console moving down and the sparkle of the iridium silver finish. The push buttons on the dash to select the correct gear gives it an exotic feel while every thing smells of leather — even at 80 mph and the top’s down.\n\nLuxury abounds: The 700 Watt stereo, the 10-way power adjustable seats, the trunk-mounted umbrella holder, Lamy pen and pen holder and walnut wood trim. It’s better outfitted than most studies in Los Angeles homes, and it holds its value better.\n\nThe car does come with a back seat, two small buckets that held my brief case nicely. I think that’s about all they could fit.\n\nThen there’s the key. A bit of technology that starts the car. The fob is made of glass, polished stainless steel and plastic. Aston Martin calls it the Emotion Control Unit and it fits into this slot that requires that you press it to awake the DB9.\n\nOK, this is a little ostentatious, but it’s still pretty cool.\n\nToss those keys down on the bar and people will notice.\n\nAnd that’s really the point of driving this car. It may have an understated beauty to it, but it’s the kind of beauty people look at. Men, women, kids, dogs, they all stop and stare. They know it’s special, even if they don’t know exactly why.\n\nYou don’t have to know the difference between a carbon fiber driveshaft and a mine shaft to appreciate this machine.\n\nWhen I arrived at my brother’s Burbank office, all of his coworkers were there. He had managed to work in the word DB9 in all of his conversations.\n\nScott Burgess is the auto critic for The Detroit News. He can be reached at (313) 223-3217 or sburgess@detnews.com.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe Aston Martin DB9 offers some redesigned interior elements and an upgraded infotainment system for 2008. The DB9 is powered by a 6.0-liter V-12 engine that generates 450 horsepower. Competitors include the Ferrari F430 and Lamborghini Gallardo.\n\nEither a conventional six-speed manual gearbox or a button-controlled six-speed automatic, called Touchtronic II, can be installed. Aston Martin says the manual-shift DB9 can accelerate from zero to 60 mph in 4.7 seconds. That’s quick, but not blindingly fast like the Gallardo and F430. According to Car and Driver and Motor Trend, the Gallardo sprints to 60 mph in around 4 seconds, while the F430 does it in 3.5.\n\nThe DB9 was the first car to be hand-built at a new state-of-the-art facility in Gaydon, Warwickshire, England. In addition to the coupe, a Volante convertible is also offered.\n\nRecent revisions added more cabin stowage, coat hooks, rear parking sensors, cruise control, heated front seats, power-folding side mirrors, an umbrella, a navigation system and, for 2008, Bluetooth connectivity.\n\nExterior\nA long aluminum hood sits above a familiar Aston Martin grille, and side strakes are located on the front quarter panels. The body panels are aluminum or lightweight composites, while magnesium is used for the steering column and inner doorframes. Locating the gearbox at the rear helps achieve 50/50 weight distribution, and a full undertray reduces lift and drag. The DB9’s rear haunches are wide and curvaceous, and its profile features a prominent trunk. “Swan wing” doors rise at a 12-degree angle for easier access. Front parking sensors and LEDs in the door handles are optional.\n\nAn optional Sports Pack on the coupe includes new five-spoke aluminum alloy wheels, a revised undertray and a lower ride height. This works with revised dampers and springs and a reworked front anti-roll bar to provide better handling.\n\nThe Volante’s fabric top folds underneath a hard tonneau cover that sits flush with the bodywork. Sensors can detect a potential rollover and deploy twin roll-hoops. Aston Martin says the windshield pillars can withstand twice the car’s body weight.\n\nInterior\nThe DB9 offers 2+2 seating that features Bridge of Weir leather. Walnut, mahogany or bamboo wood trim is available. A host of information and entertainment upgrades for 2008 include new steering-wheel audio controls, Bluetooth connectivity and an auxiliary jack for MP3 players. Satellite radio is optional. The standard audio system has been cranked up to 700 watts, and the multilingual information center adds Russian, Greek and Chinese to its repertoire.\n\nOther changes include a redesigned center armrest and new sun visors.\n\nTo start the engine, the driver must press a clear glass button. The tachometer dial runs counterclockwise and has no redline. Instead, a red warning symbol appears at various engine speeds, depending on ambient temperature and engine mileage.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe DB9’s 6.0-liter V-12 produces 450 hp and 420 pounds-feet of torque. The ZF six-speed automatic transmission uses buttons to select Drive, Park, Neutral and Reverse. A Touchtronic manual mode permits gear changes using paddles behind the steering wheel. A conventional Graziano six-speed manual gearbox is also available.\n\nAston Martin says the Volante’s maximum speed is 186 mph, the same as the coupe.\n\nSafety\nAll-disc antilock brakes incorporate electronic brake-force distribution and brake assist. Seat-mounted side-impact airbags and an electronic stability system are standard. For 2007, new seats feature standard occupant-detection sensors, plus head and thorax side airbags.\n\nDriving Impressions\nHandling is where the DB9 truly excels, hanging on with passion through swift curves and delivering a civilized experience. Confidence levels reach well beyond the sports-car norm. The suspension follows road contours closely, yet ride comfort is satisfying.\n\nThe dashboard is packed with controls. Most markings are clear, but the gauges aren’t easy to read.\n\nThe V-12 generates a rich exhaust sound. Gear changes are quite easy using the dashboard selector buttons and steering-wheel paddles, and automatic mode does a fine job. After a momentary hesitation to downshift, the DB9 lunges ahead with unbridled force. The Sport Pack option has not been tested.\n\nRear headroom is scant and legroom is virtually nonexistent, but the front compartment is roomy enough in a snug, separated cockpit.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nOn sale since fall 2004, the Aston Martin DB9 superseded the long-lived DB7 Vantage. The DB9 is powered by a 6.0-liter V-12 engine that generates 450 horsepower. Either a conventional six-speed-manual gearbox or a button-controlled six-speed automatic can be installed. Aston Martin says the manual-shift DB9 can accelerate from zero to 60 mph in 4.7 seconds.\n\nThe DB9 was the first car to be hand-built at a new state-of-the-art facility in Gaydon, Warwickshire, England. In addition to the coupe, a Volante convertible is also offered.\n\nThe console controls are revised for 2006. Additional cabin stowage is provided, along with coat hooks. New standard equipment includes rear parking sensors, cruise control, heated front seats, power-folding side mirrors, an umbrella, a navigation system and Bluetooth phone preparation.\n\nExterior\nA long aluminum hood sits above a familiar Aston Martin grille, and side strakes are located in the front quarter panels. The body panels are aluminum or lightweight composites, while magnesium is used for the steering column and inner doorframes. Locating the gearbox at the rear helps achieve 50/50 weight distribution, and a full undertray reduces lift and drag. The DB9’s rear haunches are wide and curvaceous, and its profile features a prominent trunk. “Swan wing” doors rise at a 12-degree angle for easier access.\n\nThe Volante’s fabric top folds underneath a hard tonneau cover that sits flush with the bodywork. Sensors can detect a potential rollover and deploy twin roll-hoops. Aston Martin says the windshield pillars can withstand twice the car’s body weight.\n\nInterior\nThe DB9 offers 2+2 seating that features Bridge of Weir leather. Walnut, mahogany or bamboo wood trim is available.\n\nTo start the engine, the driver must press a clear glass button. The tachometer dial runs counterclockwise and has no conventional redline. Instead, a red warning symbol appears at various engine speeds depending on ambient temperature and engine mileage. The British firm Linn developed the 950-watt sound system.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe DB9’s 6.0-liter V-12 produces 450 hp and 420 pounds-feet of torque. The ZF six-speed-automatic transmission uses buttons to select Drive, Park, Neutral and Reverse. A Touchtronic manual mode permits gear changes using paddles behind the steering wheel. A conventional Graziano six-speed-manual gearbox is also available.\n\nSafety\nAll-disc antilock brakes incorporate electronic brake-force distribution and brake assist. Seat-mounted side-impact airbags and Dynamic Stability Control are standard.\n\nDriving Impressions\nHandling is where the DB9 truly excels, hanging on with passion through swift curves and delivering a civilized experience. Confidence levels reach well beyond the sports-car norm. The suspension follows road contours closely, yet ride comfort is satisfying.\n\nThe dashboard is packed with controls. Most markings are clear, but the gauges aren’t so easy to read.\n\nThe V-12 generates a rich exhaust sound. Gear changes are quite easy using the dashboard selector buttons and steering-wheel paddles, and automatic mode does a fine job. After a momentary hesitation to downshift, the DB9 lunges ahead with unbridled force.\n\nRear headroom is scant and legroom is virtually nonexistent, but the front compartment is roomy enough in a snug, separated cockpit. The front fenders are hard to see, but the rear window provides a helpful view.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nOn sale since 2004, the Aston Martin DB9 superseded the long-lived DB7 Vantage. The DB9 is powered by a 6.0-liter V-12 engine that generates 450 horsepower. Either a conventional six-speed manual gearbox or a button-controlled six-speed automatic can be installed. Aston Martin says the manual-shift DB9 can accelerate from zero to 60 mph in 4.7 seconds.\n\nThe DB9 was the first car to be hand-built at a new state-of-the-art facility in Gaydon, Warwickshire, England. In addition to the coupe, a Volante convertible is also offered.\n\nFor 2007, both the Volante and coupe get new seats that incorporate standard head and thorax airbags, dual-stage heating and twin lumbar adjustment. The seats can be programmed to remember three separate settings.\n\nRecent revisions added more cabin stowage, coat hooks, rear parking sensors, cruise control, heated front seats, power-folding side mirrors, an umbrella, a navigation system and Bluetooth capability.\n\nExterior\nA long aluminum hood sits above a familiar Aston Martin grille, and side strakes are located on the front quarter panels. The body panels are aluminum or lightweight composites, while magnesium is used for the steering column and inner doorframes. Locating the gearbox at the rear helps achieve 50/50 weight distribution, and a full undertray reduces lift and drag. The DB9’s rear haunches are wide and curvaceous, and its profile features a prominent trunk. “Swan wing” doors rise at a 12-degree angle for easier access.\n\nFor 2007, the coupe gains a Sports Pack option that includes new five-spoke aluminum alloy wheels, a revised undertray and a lower ride height. This works with revised dampers and springs and a reworked front anti-roll bar to provide better handling.\n\nThe Volante’s fabric top folds underneath a hard tonneau cover that sits flush with the bodywork. Sensors can detect a potential rollover and deploy twin roll-hoops. Aston Martin says the windshield pillars can withstand twice the car’s body weight.\n\nNew for both the Volante and coupe are front parking sensors and LEDs in the door handles as no-cost options.\n\nInterior\nThe DB9 offers 2+2 seating that features Bridge of Weir leather. Walnut, mahogany or bamboo wood trim is available. The new seats, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, and power, memory mirrors are newly standard for 2007.\n\nThe coupe gains more cargo space — now more tha 6.5 cubic feet — because the amplifier, first-aid kit and tire-inflation equipment have been relocated.\n\nTo start the engine, the driver must press a clear glass button. The tachometer dial runs counterclockwise and has no redline. Instead, a red warning symbol appears at various engine speeds, depending on ambient temperature and engine mileage. The British firm Linn developed the 950-watt sound system.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe DB9’s 6.0-liter V-12 produces 450 hp and 420 pounds-feet of torque. The ZF six-speed automatic transmission uses buttons to select Drive, Park, Neutral and Reverse. A Touchtronic manual mode permits gear changes using paddles behind the steering wheel. A conventional Graziano six-speed manual gearbox is also available.\n\nWhile the coupe gains the Sport Pack, the Volante isn’t forgotten in the performance area. Its top speed is no longer restricted to 165 mph. Aston Martin says the Volante’s maximum speed is 186 mph, the same as the coupe.\n\nSafety\nAll-disc antilock brakes incorporate electronic brake-force distribution and brake assist. Seat-mounted side-impact airbags and Dynamic Stability Control are standard. For 2007, new seats feature standard occupant-detection sensors, plus head and thorax side airbags.\n\nDriving Impressions\nHandling is where the DB9 truly excels, hanging on with passion through swift curves and delivering a civilized experience. Confidence levels reach well beyond the sports-car norm. The suspension follows road contours closely, yet ride comfort is satisfying.\n\nThe dashboard is packed with controls. Most markings are clear, but the gauges aren’t easy to read.\n\nThe V-12 generates a rich exhaust sound. Gear changes are quite easy using the dashboard selector buttons and steering-wheel paddles, and automatic mode does a fine job. After a momentary hesitation to downshift, the DB9 lunges ahead with unbridled force. The new Sport Pack option has not been tested.\n\nRear headroom is scant and legroom is virtually nonexistent, but the front compartment is roomy enough in a snug, separated cockpit.",
