      "expert_review": "With my rock-hard abs and murderous smile, I’m frequently mistaken for James Bond. I open cans of Coke with my Walther PPK. I settle hotel bills with lethal kung fu finger strikes. A glimpse of my Omega Speedmaster has caused waitresses to spontaneously disrobe.\n\nMy charms, however, are somewhat diminished when I climb into my white Honda minivan. Really, the only time my sick-cool man-pantherism can achieve its maximum fullness is when I’m obliged to test an Aston Martin.\n\nI was initially offered a chance to drive an actual prop car from the latest Bond flick “Quantum of Solace,” an Aston Martin DBS in which actor Daniel Craig’s alabaster butt had actually sat. I declined. The thought of my wife purring and pawing at the upholstery did not appeal.\n\nSoon enough, Aston Martin sent around a proper 2009 DBS, doused in scintillant flint-gray paint and upholstered with black, quilted Alcantara leather. It’s a modest runabout that costs around $280,000, which is, interestingly, about the median home price in Southern California.\n\nNo lasers, alas, no oil spreaders, no glove box-mounted defibrillator to treat the beauty-induced tachycardia. God, this is one smoking-hot car. My desire, the sheer want of it, stings my face like sleet.\n\nBefore you reach for your sustainable-softwood pencil and recycled stationery, yes, I know, I get it. I’ve been co-opted by the oil fascists, the hyper-consumerist hypnotists, the evil marketers who sell the poison of materialism as cure for unhappiness.\n\nNot only that, the Aston Martin, being British, plays into Americans’ Anglophile fixation on class and rank as a substitute for human decency. Somewhere Thorstein Veblen is sitting on a horse like Iron Eyes Cody, crying.\n\nPlease. Ordinarily, I would so rain space-based missiles down on you using my cellphone, but I’ve got T-Mobile and I can’t get a good signal from my office.\n\nThe DBS is not, perhaps, the ideal car for a spy, since the thing arrives with all the stealth of a marching band. This is an audacious car, big (nearly a foot longer than a Corvette), broad and low, with impossibly tight wheel-well clearances around the 20-inch rims and a canopy as narrowed as Cleopatra’s eye.\n\nAston Martin’s usual restraint in penmanship here surrenders to an orgy of strakes, ducts, aero channels and fender bulges cavorting across the aluminum and carbon-fiber bodywork. Yet there’s harmony to the car, a strangely organic and unstrained quality as if it were a naturally occurring knot in the warp and weave of physics.\n\nAnd then there’s the moment when you plug the sapphire crystal “key” into the center dash-mounted starter receptacle. There’s a flash of crystalline red, then a foreboding thunder rises from under the hood. Uh-oh. Somebody’s knickers are going walkabout.\n\nThough it’s capable of 191 mph and will put a smoking borehole through the head of your typical Porsche 911, the DBS is neither the fastest nor most powerful of the six-figure exotic sports cars.\n\nMounted well back in the chassis is a 6.0-liter, 48-valve V12 engine producing an effortless 510 horsepower and 420 pound-feet of torque at a relatively high 5,750 rpm. To compare, the nose-to-nose rival Ferrari 599 GTB serves up 102 more hp and it weighs nearly the same as the DBS (3,828 pounds).\n\nMeanwhile, there are two gearboxes available in the DBS, one a conventional manual six-speed and the other a paddle-shifted six-speed automatic transaxle. I tested a car with the automatic “Touchtronic” gearbox.\n\nThe factory’s quoted figure for 0 to 100 kilometers per hour (0 to 62 mph) is 4.3 seconds — not all that impressive. Ferraris, Lamborginis and even Corvettes are well down in the mid-3-second range. So, although it is still blazingly fast, the Aston simply doesn’t have the pace of a true exotic. And you know, I could not care less.\n\nAston Martin could have hammered on the V12 for more low-end torque and more top-end horsepower. But it didn’t. What it did was, at every turn, surrender some small and meaningless fraction of numerical performance — lateral grip, top speed, braking distance — for a holistic refinement and day-to-day drivability in every direction.\n\nThe suspension is quite taut and cinched down, but it’s not so flat and hard and unyielding that you wouldn’t want to drive to Canada and back.\n\nLikewise, the steering is light and micrometer precise, but there is enough softness on center that you can sneeze and not wind up in Fontana. The new carbon-ceramic brakes will stop a freight train, but the initial tip-in is measured, silky and progressive.\n\nThis is not an exotic sports car so much as a hyper-focused grand touring car, immensely powerful but also mature. And it shows in the thousand grace notes around the cabin: the appealing chronometer-style gauges; the oversized Hermes-style stitching; the unidirectional carbon weave pattern on the doors; the beautiful, blue-lighted switch gear against the piano black console fascia.\n\nEverything is surgically precise, fitted, bespoke. The car dares to be swank and glamorous, to have a sense of style unto itself. The interior of the DBS makes the guts of the Ferrari 599 look like a Juarez swap meet.\n\nAs for gadgets, the DBS has two of particular note. The first is the Bang & Olufsen BeoSound audio system, with ultra-cool “acoustic lens” tweeters that seem to levitate out of the dash top. The second is utterly not cool — that is the small disaster of the navigation system and display. The graphics are awful, the controls clumsy, the interface silly. The vendor of this hardware should be fed to the sharks.\n\nIn closing, I want to wish all our readers a happy holiday season. Today is Boxing Day, the day in Christendom when traditionally serfs and servants receive their Christmas bonuses from their employers in the upper classes. Considering my unstinting and devoted service, I am certain my employers will be along with my present any time now, as soon as they can find an Aston Martin-shaped box. . . . Yes, any minute now. Right . . . about . . . now.",

      "expert_review": "After driving the 2010 Aston Martin DBS Volante, my initial impression as a car reviewer was that I’d been overusing the word “stunning.” Some cars look good — even great. The Jaguar XK, in particular, has many fans and is often mistaken for an Aston. But when you have the real thing, you know it. Everybody knows it, and everyone seems to love it. We often speak of polarizing designs — ones some people love and others hate. The DBS is as non polarizing as the Pontiac Aztek — just in the other direction.\n\nThe DBS is about more than looks and exclusivity, though, as you know from the second you hit the accelerator. As a Volante, or convertible, the car starts at $283,900, and our test car was $297,240 as equipped. Is it worth that much? If you’re asking the question, I’d guess no, but if everyone felt that way, the DBS wouldn’t exist, would it?\n\nExterior & Styling\nYou don’t see cars like the DBS every day, but if it looks familiar, it might be because you’ve seen the coupe version’s debut — along with Daniel Craig as James Bond — in the 2006 film “Casino Royale.” It was on-screen very little, and on-road even less. Mere seconds into what seemed an impending chase scene, our hero swerved to avoid hitting a Vespa (or perhaps a woman named Vesper) and rolled the thing 007 times. Nice job, Bond. You had to switch off the stability system, didn’t you…\n\nLesser luxury classes are migrating toward retractable-hardtop convertibles, but most automakers devoted to low weight and usable trunk space are sticking to the soft-top. The Volante characteristically lacks the DBS coupe’s fastback roofline, but it’s reasonably true to the overall design. The car’s hood, trunk and front fenders are made of carbon fiber, as are the chin spoiler and rear diffuser, where the material’s distinctive weave is visible.\n\nThe chin spoiler, also known as a splitter, rides very close to the ground, at the mercy of curbs and parking blocks. I issued the same caution about Chevrolet’s Corvette ZR-1, but thankfully the Aston’s splitter doesn’t jut out as far in the center. On the downside, the car’s front sonar parking sensors sit midway up the bumper, where they don’t always detect low obstacles.\n\nI wasn’t wild about our car’s Amethyst Red paint or the lighter roof color, but for the full British effect, Aston Martin was kind enough to provide us with London-style rain and fog, in which I think the car looked better (see the photos).\n\nBehind the Wheel\nThe doors, which have what you might call a mild butterfly design, rise slightly as they open so you needn’t worry about striking a curb — though parking this doll on the street doesn’t strike me as a very good idea. With the opening of the door comes a whiff of sumptuous leather that beckons you inside. Step delicately over a side sill bearing a placard that reminds you the DBS is “Hand built in England,” and you drop into supportive, well-bolstered seats with integral head restraints that aren’t adjustable, yet were perfectly positioned for me.\n\nIt all starts with a crystal-capped key fob that Aston calls the Emotion Control Unit. How silly, I thought. Then I pushed it into the mid-dashboard slot. The receptacle glowed white, then red as the engine thundered to life. I have to admit I had an emotional reaction.\n\nThe drivetrain comprises a 6.0-liter V-12 that drives the rear wheels through your choice of a six-speed manual or automatic transmission. These are two big positives for me. Whether you like stick shifts as much as I do or not, you must acknowledge the advantage of choice. (Unfortunately, I had no choice and got the automatic.) Bentley and Lamborghini offer only paddle-shiftable automatics — with the exception of Lamborghini’s new limited-production version of the Gallardo, named after test driver Valentino Balboni. Likewise, the Balboni is Lambo’s only car with rear-wheel drive. All its other models — as well as the closest competitor from Bentley, the Continental — are all-wheel drive.\n\nThere’s a lot to be said for the performance of all-wheel drive, but purists still prefer the control that rear-drive provides over a car’s attitude, and the feel of steering unencumbered by extra hardware up front. That’s what the DBS delivers, with balanced weight distribution and good steering feedback. Not so the Continental GTC Speed I reviewed, which feels nose-heavy and more isolated from the road. Strictly by the numbers, the 600 horsepower and 553 pounds-feet of torque from the GTC Speed’s twin-turbo W-12 looks superior to the DBS V-12’s 510 hp and 420 pounds-feet of torque. However, the Bentley weighs close to 5,500 pounds, and the DBS Volante tops out at 4,070 pounds with the automatic transmission. The difference is clear in the cars’ handling. Their zero-to-60 mph sprints are about equal at roughly 4.5 seconds.\n\nOut on the street, there’s nothing wrong with the DBS. When turning from a dead stop at an intersection, it’s very easy to break the tires loose and trigger the traction control — something you don’t experience with all-wheel drive. Honestly, more low-rev torque might be a bad thing in this regard.\n\nThe DBS sounds terrific, especially when you exceed 4,000 rpm, which opens valves in the exhaust stream and lets the V-12 roar. If you stay in low gears and rely on engine braking, you hear the engine from the front, thanks in large part to four cooling vents in the hood. Heat rises from the vents, distorting your view when sitting at a stoplight, waiting anxiously to wind it out again.\n\nIf you keep the drivetrain in Drive rather than Sport mode and leave the adaptive suspension in its default setting, the DBS is pretty quiet and comfortable — enough for long drives on a smooth highway. One exception common to soft-tops is that noise creeps in around the rear window, particularly the high-pitched “shhhhhhhhh” of passing tires on wet pavement. Like most convertibles, the Volante doesn’t feel as rigid as a coupe, but it’s more than reasonable, especially in normal driving.\n\nThe Inside\nThe interior is beautifully executed, but there are some shortcomings: The multimedia controller is perplexing, even once you delve into the owner’s manual, and “cupholders” is a generous name for the two spaces in the center console. (I used to think Great Britain was a tragically dehydrated country, but I have since concluded that Brits have evolved to absorb the ever-present rainfall through their skin.)\n\nAs for the two rear seats, Aston Martin calls them “occasional,” but I assure you there is no occasion for which these can be considered seats. They’re handy for cargo, though, because the trunk is modest at 6.6 cubic feet in both the coupe and the Volante.\n\nDBS Volante in the Market\nI flat-out prefer the DBS Volante to the Continental GTC Speed, though one could argue the Speed’s $231,400 base price makes it an unfair fight. (GTC versus Aston Martin DB9 is a battle I’d eagerly wage another day.) That said, I have to give credit to Aston for standard features that were optional in the GTC Speed and swelled its as-tested price to $270,795. Such features include the DBS’ carbon-ceramic brakes and a premium stereo that sounds much better than the Bentley’s. The DBS’ satellite radio option is steep at $1,250, as are the $3,190 10-spoke wheels. Otherwise, our test car had some interior colour [sic] options priced in the hundreds. Bentley charged $1,000 for contrast stitching. We’re talking thread here. Thread!\n\nWith its peak torque coming at high revs (5,750 rpm), its lighter weight and its athleticism, the DBS is more in the league of Ferraris and Lamborghinis, though I think I’d give the Italian exotics the edge in terms of track performance. What the DBS has is an excellent mix of truly stunning design, performance and class — probably more than you’ll get anywhere else. I drive many cars, and sometimes I’m sorry to see them go back to their rightful owners. But this time? We’re talking full-on separation anxiety. I need a lotto ticket, a sugar mama or a therapist.\n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nSporting a 510-horsepower V-12, massive wheels and a low-slung hood, the DBS competes with supercars like the Ferrari 599 GTB and Maserati GranTurismo. The rear-wheel-drive DBS crowns Aston Martin’s three-car lineup and is available as a coupe or convertible. It shares its platform with the similarly styled DB9 and less expensive V8 Vantage, both of which have convertible variants.\n\nNew for 2011\nThere are no significant changes for 2011.\n\nExterior\nThose who have seen a mid-’90s DB7 or anything newer should recognize the DBS as an Aston. Its trapezoidal grille and low-slung hood mimic the V8 Vantage and DB9; the front air dam is larger, the bumper has a few more etchings, and the rear sports an aggressive underbody air diffuser. Exterior features include:\n\n\nConstructed from lightweight aluminum, magnesium and carbon fiber\nAluminum chassis\nXenon high-intensity-discharge headlights\nLED taillamps\n20-inch wheels standard\nAvailable lightweight 20-inch wheels\nPower retractable fabric roof (convertible)\n\nInterior\nThe two-seat interior looks much like that of the DB9. The center stack starts with the air-conditioning vents up top and flows down to the center armrest. A small cargo area behind the seats can hold a custom luggage set. The rear cargo area can be replaced with additional seats to increase seating capacity to four. This configuration comes standard on the convertible. Interior features include:\n\n\nLeather-upholstered dashboard, armrest, steering wheel and seats\nChoice of ultrathin racing seats or chunkier, but still heavily bolstered, sport seats\nAvailable navigation system\nAvailable Bang & Olufsen stereo\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe engine sits in front of the driver and passenger but is pushed back toward the center of the car. The automatic transmission is similar to the unit used in the DB9, but with beefed-up internal parts to handle the extra power. Mechanical features include:\n\n\n510 hp and 420 pounds-feet of torque\nMid-mounted 6.0-liter V-12\nZero to 60 mph in 4.3 seconds\nStandard six-speed manual transmission\nAvailable six-speed automatic with paddle shifter\nAdaptive suspension adjusts dampers to changing road conditions\n\nSafety\nSafety features include:\n\n\nAntilock brakes\nTraction control\nElectronic stability system",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nSporting a 510-horsepower V-12, massive wheels and a low-slung hood, the DBS competes with supercars like the Ferrari 599 GTB and Lamborghini Gallardo. The rear-wheel-drive DBS crowns Aston Martin’s lineup and is available as a coupe or convertible. It shares its platform with the similarly styled DB9 and less expensive V8 Vantage.\n\nNew for 2012\nFor 2012, a Garmin-based navigation system replaces a hard-drive-based one, and the brake calipers can be optionally finished in red, gray or yellow.\n\nExterior\nThose who have seen a mid-’90s DB7 should recognize the DBS as an Aston. Its trapezoidal grille and low-slung hood mimic the V8 Vantage and DB9; the front air dam is larger, the bumper has a few more flourishes and the rear sports an aggressive underbody diffuser. Exterior features include:\n\nConstructed from lightweight aluminum, magnesium and carbon fiber\nAluminum chassis\nXenon high-intensity-discharge headlights\nLED taillamps\nStandard 20-inch wheels\nPower retractable fabric roof (convertible)\n\nInterior\nThe interior looks much like that of the DB9. The center stack starts with the air-conditioning vents up top and flows down to the center armrest. A small cargo area behind the seats can hold a custom luggage set. This space can be fitted with two additional seats to increase seating capacity to four. This configuration comes standard on the convertible. Interior features include:\n\nLeather-upholstered dashboard, armrest, steering wheel and seats\nGarmin-based navigation system\nCruise control\nAutomatic air conditioning\nBang & Olufsen stereo\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe engine sits in front of the driver and front passenger but is pushed back toward the center of the car. The automatic transmission is similar to the unit used in the DB9, but with beefed-up internal parts to handle the extra power. Mechanical features include:\n\n510 hp and 420 pounds-feet of torque\nMid-mounted 6.0-liter V-12\nZero to 62 mph in 4.3 seconds\nStandard six-speed manual transmission\nAvailable six-speed automatic with paddle shifters\nAdaptive suspension adjusts dampers to changing road conditions\n\nSafety\nSafety features include:\n\nAntilock brakes\nTraction control\nElectronic stability system",
