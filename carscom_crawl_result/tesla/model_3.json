      "expert_review": "The Model 3, like all other Tesla vehicles, is an electric car. It's also the most affordable Tesla to date, though no early owners will pay the 3's starting price — $35,000 before tax incentives. Until November 2017, every Model 3 will have the car's optional long-range battery, which adds considerable capability, but runs a hefty $9,000.\n\nMost of that early group figures to be Tesla employees, as the automaker confirmed deliveries to outside customers won’t start until late October 2017. Until then, all Model 3s will end up with employees who reserved one — and apparently pay full price, as Tesla says it furnishes no employee discount.\n\nThe Model 3 comes standard with a tabletlike horizontal touchscreen that measures 15 inches. That’s slightly smaller than the 17-inch vertical screen embedded in the Model S’ dashboard. While the S has a secondary gauge display ahead of the steering wheel, the 3 puts such information on the horizontal screen.\n\nThe Model 3’s standard battery goes into production in November 2017. Tesla says that unit delivers an EPA-estimated 220 miles of range and powers the Model 3 to 60 mph in 5.6 seconds. That’s on par with many turbo four-cylinder engines in luxury sports sedans. A Level 2 (240-volt) charger can add 30 miles of range per hour, Tesla says, while the automaker’s network of fast-charging Superchargers can add 130 miles in 30 minutes.\n\nOther standard features include:\n\nNavigation, phone and audio streaming, onboard Wi-Fi and a backup camera\nKeyless entry and remote climate control with Tesla’s smartphone app\nDual-zone automatic climate control\nFM radio with internet streaming\n“Textile” seating, which Tesla calls a “high-end cloth material”\nTwo USB ports in the center console\n60/40-split folding rear seat\nFull-LED lights\nAutomatic emergency braking\n18-inch wheels\n\nLike the Model S and Model X, the Model 3’s sole no-charge paint is black. For another $1,000, you can choose from five metallic colors: blue, red, pearl white and two shades of silver.\n\nMajor options include:\n\nLong-Range Battery ($9,000): The battery bumps range up some 41 percent to 310 miles. It also adds faster charging capabilities (37 miles of range per hour on a Level 2, or 170 miles per 30 minutes on a Supercharger) and quicker acceleration (5.1 seconds to 60 mph). Those are big gains, but they cost more than a quarter of the Model 3’s base price.\nPremium Upgrades Package ($5,000): This adds heated seats, upgraded seating and cabin materials including open-pore wood trim, two rear USB ports, a power-adjustable steering column, a premium stereo with more wattage and speakers, a glass roof panel, foglights and center-console docking for two smartphones. Twelve-way power front seats are also included, but it’s unclear whether the standard seats are manually adjustable or just have fewer power adjustments.\nEnhanced Autopilot ($5,000): This adds adaptive cruise control, lane-centering steering, automatic lane changing, automatic parking and more. More features will come with future software updates, Tesla says.\nFull Self-Driving Capability ($3,000): This requires Enhanced Autopilot first, but Tesla says that with the package, the Model 3 will become “capable of conducting trips with no action required by the person in the driver’s seat.” But that will require “extensive software validation and regulatory approval” and may vary based on where you are, so it remains a future product for now.\n\nTesla’s website goes to great lengths to dispel the notion that the Model 3 is an upgrade to the Model S — an understandable sentiment given that higher numbers for consumer electronics generally correspond to better next-generation products. Tesla’s site notes the Model 3 “is a smaller, simpler, more affordable electric car. Although it is our newest vehicle, Model 3 is not ‘Version 3’ or the most advanced Tesla.”",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Tesla’s comprehensive overhaul to the suspension, interior and user interface of the Model 3 makes it not just one of the best electric vehicles available, but one of the most compelling compact luxury sedans on the market — period. \n\nVersus the competition: Tesla faces increased competition across the board, and its Model 3 and Model Y find themselves in the sharpest crosshairs. With its 2024 refresh, the Model 3 is now on par with or better than BMW’s i offerings, and for some, it will be a more attractive choice than the Hyundai Ioniq 6.  \n\nIt’s a turbulent time for Tesla. As of this writing, the American automaker faces market, production and leadership struggles that are being magnified through a media lens that seems to relish every misstep and setback. Despite the headlines and a typhoon of genuine competition from legacy automakers, most Tesla products are still the benchmark for EVs when it comes to sales and public charging infrastructure.\n\nRelated: 2024 Tesla Model 3 Up Close: Refined and Renewed\n\nAmid this turmoil and narrative, we have some good news: The updated 2024 Model 3 is quite impressive, and not just for an EV — it’s impressive in the luxury compact sedan class as a whole. As subtle as its changes might seem on (recycled) paper, there’s enough (plant-based) meat here to strongly appeal to new and returning Tesla customers alike.\n\nAn EV Playground\n2024 Tesla Model 3 charging | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\n\nA bamboo platter of context, caveats and variables: I’m based in a suburb of Los Angeles, a sprawling metroplex roundly considered a playground for EVs of all shapes and sizes. Whatever all-electric you’re driving, you’re never more than a few minutes from a public charging station amid a state that has by far the highest concentration of them anywhere in the U.S. It’s not clear how many of those are Tesla ports or Superchargers, but given the automaker’s ubiquity here in California, it’s safe to say there are a lot.  \n\nDuring my test drive, I buzzed around in a 2024 Model 3 Long Range wholly within the confines of the city; I didn’t attempt any road trips. And after evaluating the updated Model 3 as an urban runabout in one of the most EV-friendly American cities, I believe Tesla’s redesigned sedan might be one of the best small(ish) cars you can buy provided it fits your lifestyle.\n\nFine Refinement\n2024 Tesla Model 3 | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\n\nFor the moment, forget any software or feature updates in the updated Model 3. Tesla put an admirable focus on improving build quality, attention to detail, refinement and comfort in this car — and my goodness, does it show. Noise, vibration and harshness is down a claimed 20% over the last generation thanks to significant changes with the chassis.\n\nThe suspension has been overhauled front and rear, utilizing “frequency-dependent” damper valves that mechanically adapt to impacts in order to improve ride comfort and body control. New bushings and a modified rear subframe expand isolation, control and steering responsiveness, buoyed by additional changes to the wheel hubs and brakes.\n\nThe sum of all this is ride and handling composure that is at the very least on par with the BMW 3 Series and Audi A4. It’s a massive improvement over the previous Model 3, a car that could be charitably described as “harsh.” Cars.com Managing Editor Joe Bruzek finagled a 30-minute drive in an updated Model 3 during a service session for Cars.com’s Model Y, piloting the sedan through a suburban Chicago environment that included both city streets and highways. His reaction?\n\n“I was blown away by how differently the new Model 3 drives versus the old one, as well as our Model Y,” he wrote. “The 2024 Model 3 removes almost all harshness from the driving experience of the previous 2018 Model 3 Long Range I drove while retaining much of the fun-to-drive character.” \n\n2024 Tesla Model 3 | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\n\nIndeed, it’s not just about comfort. In the configuration I drove, the 2024 Model 3 is genuinely fun to drive even just around town. Without drinking deeply from the Long Range’s 425 horsepower and instantly available 475 pounds-feet of torque, there’s still a universal sense of solidity and surefootedness that’s endemic to premium sports sedans like the 3 Series and Lexus IS. \n\nThe Model 3’s is hardly the most “connected” drive — it’s still quite digital in sensation — but there’s satisfying weight and damping to driver inputs that go a long way toward elevating the experience. And now you’re finally not sacrificing comfort in this pursuit; I spent roughly an hour with the Cars.com Model Y in Chicago in early 2024, and though I marveled at its rapier-quick steering and conspicuous lack of body roll, the suspension was painfully tight; it crashed more than coddled over bumps. That kind of behavior is somewhat forgivable in a performance trim, but it’s unforgivable in a workaday Long Range configuration.\n\nSurprising Silence\n\nThankfully, we can look forward to the new Model 3’s chassis improvements in a future updated Model Y.\n\n“There aren’t any jarring hits or unsettledness with the 2024 Model 3; tire impacts are quieter and less intrusive,” Bruzek agreed. “Overall, the new Model 3 finally drives like a luxury car, and it easily rivals the ride and handling refinement of traditional German luxury cars.”\n\n2024 Tesla Model 3 | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\n\nIt’s quiet, too. Yes, yes — one would assume all EVs are quiet by nature, but in the absence of a rumbling engine, suspension creaks, road noise and electric motor whine can be quick to fill the void. In the new Model 3, thicker padding and insulation work in concert with new acoustic glass for the side windows to properly muffle the interior to match this car’s price tag and market position — and it will likely pay the biggest dividends for returning customers.\n\nTalking Tech\n\nSpeaking of returning customers, I’m probably focusing on the wrong stuff for them. Whereas quality control and general refinement are important for brand newbies and conquest sales, a returning Tesla advocate will likely do so for the tech and feature set — comfort be damned. Predictably, the fresh Model 3 adds a suite of tech and software upgrades that will either delight or disgust.\n\nThe most controversial change will likely be the relocation of the shift controls to the touchscreen and the addition of a directional swipe element. Drive is engaged by swiping the scroll bar forward or “up” on a dedicated area of the screen; swipe down for Reverse. Park is a one-touch function at the top of this pseudo scroll bar, and Neutral is a press-and-hold toggle at the bottom. All of this works in concert with the predictive shift protocol, which utilizes the parking sensors and a bit of logic to determine if you’re most likely going to drive forward or back upon returning to your parked car.\n\nSound confusing? It isn’t. Essentially, hitting the brake pedal with your seat belt on in a parked Model 3 will engage either Drive or Reverse depending on your environment. If it guesses incorrectly, simply select the correct direction on the screen. Screen responsiveness and reliability have been issues with Teslas, so just in case the swipe functions aren’t working, there are redundant touch-sensitive PRND controls on the headliner between the overhead light functions.\n\nRelated Video:\n\n2024 Tesla Model 3 transmission selector | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\n\nHonestly, I thought I’d hate this setup, but in practice, I acclimated far quicker than I’d imagined; eventually, I started to like the flow that emerges from leaning in to the Tesla ecosystem. With my phone as the key, it was one fluid motion to enter the parked car, click the seat belt, hit the brake and drive away.\n\nMy Kingdom for a Stalk\n\nOn the contrary, it was the updated steering controls that I never got a hang of. In a tireless pursuit to eliminate all stalks from the steering column, the Model 3’s turn signals are now touch-capacitive controls on the left side of the steering wheel. No amount of mental repetition or practice made this function autonomic for me; I often hit the wrong turn direction, or the controls just didn’t engage at all. I get the goal of max minimalism, but perhaps a better solution would be a discreet pair of physical paddles or toggles behind the wheel — or simply bringing the stalk back.\n\nEverything else, however, is generally smooth and flawless in operation. Back to the phone as a key for a second: Only a handful of times did the car fail to recognize my presence, which necessitates opening the app and manually unlocking the door. The other 50-or-so times were as painless of an ingress as is possible. Tesla says the new Model 3 detects phones up to 10 times more effectively than before thanks to more Bluetooth sensors.\n\n2024 Tesla Model 3 | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\n\nThe new cabin is a marked step up, too. Gone is the crappy, poorly wearing wood veneer trim, replaced by textured cloth on a redesigned dash. It’s far more stylistically cohesive and significantly contributes to Tesla’s trademark minimalistic aesthetic. Too austere for you? Futz with the new ambient lighting to take it from an office space to a … well, colorful office space.\n\nMore From Cars.com: \n\n2024 Tesla Model 3 Receives Numerous Updates, Priced From $40,380\nNew 2024 Tesla Model 3 Performance: 510 HP, 0-60 MPH in 2.9 Seconds\nHere Are the 11 Cheapest Electric Vehicles You Can Buy\nWhat to Know Before Purchasing an Electric Vehicle: A Buying Guide\nShop for a Tesla Model 3\nBest in Class?\n\nOverall, it feels like you’re actually getting your money’s worth with the new Model 3 rather than just paying for early access to tech. Other than some expected Tesla-specific user-interface quirks, it feels like a fully thought-out and comprehensively engineered product — and that’s not something you can say about every model in the lineup.\n\nIt’s not necessarily an exciting vehicle, nor will it appeal to buyers who are already anti-Tesla, but the refreshed 2024 Tesla Model 3 goes a remarkably long way in offering an upscale experience that happily matches both its price and competition. Let’s hope we can say the same about the next Model Y.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Tesla Model 3?\n\nThe Tesla Model 3 is an all-electric compact luxury sedan with single-motor rear-wheel drive or dual motor all-wheel drive. Like other Teslas, the Model 3 doesn’t have a traditional instrument panel; a 15.4-inch touchscreen houses almost all the car’s displays and controls, including the gear selector. All Model 3s are quick, but the AWD, sport-focused Performance trim truly ratchets up performance via its 510-horsepower powertrain, sport-tuned adaptive suspension, sport seats, and larger brakes and wheels. Like its larger Model S sedan and Model Y SUV stablemates, the Model 3 was a pioneering electric car, but more competitors have arrived on the market since the Model 3 launched for the 2017 model year. Its rivals include the BMW i4 Gran Coupe, Ford Mustang Mach-E, Hyundai Ioniq 6, Kia EV6 and Polestar 2.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Tesla Model 3?\n\nAfter an extensive refresh for 2024 that included refreshed styling, a revamped interior with more controls integrated into the touchscreen, a softer-riding suspension and improvements to quietness, the only significant change to the Model 3 for 2025 is the discontinuation of its entry-level Standard Range trim.\n\nHow Much Range Does the 2025 Tesla Model 3 Have?\n\nThe Tesla Model 3’s EPA-estimated driving range runs from 298 to 363 miles, depending on battery pack and trim.\n\nHow Long Does It Take to Charge the 2025 Tesla Model 3?\n\nIt takes around 11 hours to charge a Model 3 to full on a standard 240-volt Level 2 charger but under 30 minutes on a 250-kilowatt Tesla Supercharger (to go from a 10% charge to 80%).\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Tesla Model 3 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nRWD\n15.4-inch touchscreen\nWireless charging\n8-inch rear touchscreen\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated rear seats\nHeated steering wheel\nVinyl seating surfaces\nPanoramic glass roof\nCabin preconditioning from phone\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nLane departure warning\nLane departure steering assist\nAdaptive cruise control\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nAWD\nSport-tuned adaptive suspension\nUpgraded brakes\n20-inch wheels on performance tires\nCarbon-fiber rear spoiler\nShould I Buy the 2025 Tesla Model 3?\n\nThe Tesla Model 3 pioneered the compact EV luxury sedan segment and continues to be an enticing choice for those who crave a combination of sports-sedan performance and gas-free driving. Its driving range is competitive, and Tesla’s extensive Supercharger public charging network still leads the industry. Last year’s comprehensive update brought lots of welcome improvements, though the Model 3’s unorthodox steering-wheel turn-signal controls and touchscreen-based gear selector work directly against the muscle memory most drivers have acquired using conventional versions of those controls — and consequently might be a deal breaker for some shoppers.",
