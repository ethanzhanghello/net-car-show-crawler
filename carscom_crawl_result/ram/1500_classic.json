      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Ram 1500 Classic?\n\nThe 2019 Ram 1500 Classic is a continuation of the brand's previous-generation light-duty pickup truck. (The redesigned 2019 Ram 1500 is covered separately in the Cars.com Research section.) Available in regular-cab, Quad Cab and crew-cab form, the 1500 Classic also offers three bed lengths. Power comes from a standard 305-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 or an optional 395-hp, 5.7-liter V-8. Both engines work with an eight-speed automatic transmission, and rear- and four-wheel-drive versions are offered. Competitors include the Chevrolet Silverado 1500, Ford F-150 and Toyota Tundra.   \n\nWhat's New on the 2019 Ram 1500 Classic?\n\nThree trim levels — Tradesman, Express and Big Horn/Lone Star — are offered, and the 1500 Classic also has three new appearance packages.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Ram 1500 Classic Are Most Important?\n\nThe Ram's use of a coil-spring rear suspension gives the 1500 Classic better ride quality than the average full-size pickup truck, and the RamBox storage bins are a useful feature.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Ram 1500 Classic?\n\nThe redesigned Ram 1500 offers a wider range of trim levels, some of which are luxurious, but if value is key, the 1500 Classic might be a better choice.",
