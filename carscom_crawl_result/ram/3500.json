      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Ram Heavy Duty?\n\nThe Ram Heavy Duty is a full-size pickup truck built for the toughest towing and hauling tasks. Conversely, the upper trim levels of these workhorse vehicles have opulent cabins filled with leather and luxurious trim, not to mention high-end stereos and user-friendly infotainment touchscreens. Available in 2500 and 3500 form, the Ram HD is powered by a standard 410-horsepower, 6.4-liter V-8 engine paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission. Optional is a Cummins turbo-diesel 6.7-liter inline-six that makes 370 or 420 hp and is coupled to a six-speed automatic. Rear-wheel drive is standard and four-wheel drive is optional. The mighty diesel engine produces as much as 1,075 pounds-feet of torque in the Ram 3500; when properly equipped, the 3500 can tow more than 37,000 pounds. The Chevrolet Silverado HD and Ford Super Duty are the Ram Heavy Duty’s primary rivals.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Ram Heavy Duty?\n\nA tailgate ajar warning lamp is now standard on every trim. Other than this minor addition, the 2024 Ram Heavy Duty is unchanged from 2023. \n\nWhat’s the Towing Capacity of the 2024 Ram Heavy Duty?\n\nThe Ram Heavy Duty’s maximum towing capacity ranges from 10,440 to 37,090 pounds, depending on powertrain, trim level and equipment.\n\nHow Much Does the 2024 Ram Heavy Duty Weigh?\n\nThe Ram Heavy Duty’s curb weight ranges from 6,001 to 7,390 pounds, depending on body style, trim level and equipment.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Ram Heavy Duty Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\nRegular cab\n8-foot cargo box\nRear-wheel drive\nEight-speed automatic transmission\nBluetooth connectivity\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nCrew cab or Mega Cab\n6-foot-4-inch cargo box\nFour-wheel drive\nSix-speed automatic transmission (diesel engine)\n8.4- or 12-inch touchscreen multimedia system\n12-inch digital instrument cluster\nDigital-camera rearview mirror\n360-degree camera system\nFront and rear park assist\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure steering assist\n50-gallon fuel tank\nIntegrated trailer brake controller\nTrailer reverse steering assist\nShould I Buy the 2024 Ram Heavy Duty?\n\nWithout a doubt, the Ram Heavy Duty is engineered first and foremost for hard work; it’s overkill for anyone simply looking to tow a couple of dirt bikes or load the cargo bed with bags of topsoil at a local garden store. The Ram distances itself from rivals at Ford and Chevy by the quality of its suspension, particularly when ordered with the optional rear air suspension. Higher trims like the Limited are pricey, but they have acres of space inside and some of the most elegant trim available in any pickup.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2021 Ram Heavy Duty?\n\nThe Ram HD is a full-size pickup truck aimed at people with serious towing and hauling needs, as opposed to those who make the occasional weekend run to the home improvement store. It seats up to six and competes with the Ford Super Duty and Chevrolet Silverado HD. Available in 2500 and 3500 form, a 410-horsepower, 6.4-liter V-8 engine is standard, while a Cummins turbo-diesel 6.7-liter inline-six-cylinder is available. The diesel engine makes as much as 1,000 pounds-feet of torque in the 3500.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2021 Ram Heavy Duty?\n\nA new Limited Night Edition design package arrives this year. It includes monochromatic styling, black 20-inch wheels and special badges.   \n\nWhat Features in the 2021 Ram Heavy Duty Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\nRegular cab\n8-foot cargo box\nRear-wheel drive\nEight-speed automatic transmission\nBluetooth connectivity\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nCrew cab or Mega cab\n6-foot, 4-inch cargo box\nFour-wheel drive\nSix-speed automatic transmission (diesel engine)\n8.4- or 12-inch touchscreen multimedia system\n360-degree camera system\nFront and rear park assist\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane keep assist\n50-gallon fuel tank\nIntegrated trailer-brake controller\nShould I Buy the 2021 Ram Heavy Duty?\n\nThe Ram HD should definitely be on your test-drive list if you need a full-size pickup truck for serious work. What sets it apart from the competition is its driving refinement — especially when equipped with the optional rear air suspension — as well as the quality and design of the interiors in the Laramie Longhorn and Limited. These trim levels have raised the bar for all full-size trucks.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Ram Heavy Duty?\n\nThe Ram 2500 and 3500 Heavy Duty is a full-size pickup truck aimed at people with serious towing and hauling needs as opposed to those who make the occasional weekend run to the home improvement store. It seats up to six and competes with the Ford Super Duty and Chevrolet Silverado HD. A 410-horsepower, 6.4-liter V-8 engine is standard, while a Cummins turbo-diesel 6.7-liter inline-six that makes as much as 1,000 pounds-feet of torque in the 3500 model is available. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Ram Heavy Duty?\n\nA Night Edition for Big Horn and Laramie trim levels includes monochromatic styling, black 20-inch wheels, black badges and a black interior. Lane-keeping assist, blind spot warning with trailer coverage and trailer tire pressure monitoring are available. Long-bed crew-cab trucks can have an optional 50-gallon fuel tank. \n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Ram Heavy Duty Are Most Important?\n\nThe standard 6.4-liter gas V-8 serves up more than enough capability for most towing and hauling challenges. With 410 hp and 429 pounds-feet of torque, this is the only engine offered for the Power Wagon, the Heavy Duty’s dedicated off-road model. If you choose the high-end Laramie Longhorn or Limited trim, be prepared for a truck interior like you’ve never seen; the materials quality and finishes put many luxury cars to shame.\n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Ram Heavy Duty?\n\nThe Ram Heavy Duty should definitely be on your test-drive list if you need a full-size pickup truck for serious work. What sets it apart from the competition is its driving refinement — especially when equipped with the optional rear air suspension — and the quality and design of the Laramie Longhorn’s and Limited’s interiors has raised the bar for all full-size trucks.",

      "expert_review": "Competes with: Chevrolet Silverado HD, Ford Super Duty, GMC Sierra HD\n\nLooks like: The Ram 1500’s big brother\n\nPowertrains: 405-horsepower, 6.4-liter gasoline V-8 engine with 429 pounds-feet of torque; 430-hp, 6.7-liter Cummins turbo-diesel inline six-cylinder with 1,075 pounds-feet; eight-speed automatic transmission; rear- or four-wheel drive\n\nHits dealerships: First quarter\n\nRam has unveiled the latest iteration of its heavy-duty 2500 and 3500 pickup trucks, packing more power, technology and capability into largely the same skin as the previous model. Most significantly, a new 6.7-liter Cummins turbo-diesel six-cylinder makes a little more horsepower than its predecessor and is available in every trim level. Additional powertrain updates improve capability and should enhance comfort.\n\nRelated: 2023 Ram 2500 Heavy Duty Rebel Quick Spin: Finally, a Diesel Power Wagon (Sort Of)\n\nTechnology updates include new, larger screens and advanced towing tech that brings Ram’s heavy-duty pickups more in line with the recently redesigned light-duty Ram 1500 and make them more competitive with Ford’s innovative towing tech. Interestingly, all this comes with minimal visual updates.\n\nMore Pleasantly Powerful\n\nThe new Cummins turbo-diesel and its pairing with a new eight-speed automatic transmission are the stars of the show. The Cummins is available on any trim level of the 2025 Ram HDs and produces 430 hp — up 10 from the 2024 — and the same 1,075 pounds-feet of torque. That’s not the most powerful diesel on the heavy-duty market (that would be the Ford Super Duty’s High Output Power Stroke diesel’s 500 hp and 1,200 pounds-feet), but despite the updates, the Ram nearly retains its towing and payload totals. Its maximum numbers decrease slightly for 2025; maximum payload drops to 7,590 pounds from 7,680, and towing capacity maxes out at 36,610 pounds, down from 37,090.\n\nThe diesel engine is updated for what Ram claims will be improved “drivability, fuel economy, durability, startability, serviceability and noise, vibration and harshness.” That includes a new turbocharger, glow plugs for better cold-weather starts, a new fuel pump and higher-pressure fuel system, and a host of other changes under the hood.\n\nAnother update is the new eight-speed automatic transmission for both diesel and gas versions. Previous-generation diesel owners will likely notice the most significant improvements, which include up to a Ram-claimed 25% reduction in engine rpm at highway speeds, quicker acceleration, smoother starts from a stop (sensors can detect when the truck is loaded or unloaded and, when unloaded, skip first gear and go right to second for a more comfortable experience off the line) and improved fuel economy due to a reduced final drive ratio. Previously, the max towing package’s final drive was 4.10; now with the eight-speed transmission, it’s been reduced to 3.42. Also likely an improvement is that all Ram HDs now have a column-mounted gear selector; gas-powered variants with the previous eight-speed had a rotary gear selector to the right of the steering column.\n\nAccording to Ram, these updates should make the driving experience more pleasant, especially without a trailer or payload, though we’ll have to drive it to confirm.\n\nMore Tech, Too\n\nNoise and driving behavior are certainly parts of the comfort equation, but another is undoubtedly the interior. Long an area where Ram excels, the HD now gets a 12.3-inch configurable digital instrument panel and either a standard 12-inch touchscreen display or massive 14.5-inch touchscreen with split-screen functionality. By using full array local dimming instead of edge light, Ram says the displays have a higher contrast ratio.\n\nIf those screens aren’t enough, the 2025 Ram HD offers a 10.25-inch passenger display that can access navigation and external camera views as well as provide entertainment. As we’ve seen in other applications of this display in Stellantis vehicles, the screen is not visible to the driver. Device-heavy families will also likely appreciate the Ram’s available dual wireless device chargers.\n\nRam also updated the HD’s towing technology; in addition to a Trailer-Tow page in the touchscreen display that provides tons of relevant information, the Ram HD now offers trailer reverse guidance and steering, a 360-degree camera system that can incorporate a trailer into the view, improved towing mirror functionality and controls, and blind spot camera views for towing and non-towing situations.\n\nThe HD’s standard safety features now include adaptive cruise control and forward collision warning, and the Big Horn and higher trims now come with standard front and rear parking sensors. Drowsy Driver Detection, traffic-sign recognition, lane departure steering assist and lane-centering steering are now available, as well.\n\nNot-So-New Looks\n\nExterior updates to the Ram HD are far more subtle. Newly standard LED headlights, updated taillights, trim-specific grille designs and new wheel designs round out the changes and bring the Ram HD in line with the redesigned light-duty 1500.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2024 Ram HD Rebel, Power Wagon Over the Moon With New Lunar Editions\nLife With a Ram Power Wagon: Daily Driving the Ultimate Ram 2500\nPickup Truck Buying Guide: How Much Truck Do You Need?\nResearch Ram\nFind Your Next Car\nPricing and Availability\n\nThe 2025 Ram 2500 and 3500 will start at $47,560 and $48,565, respectively (all prices include destination). Ram says it will be in dealerships in the first quarter of this year.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2022 Ram Heavy Duty?\n\nThe Ram Heavy Duty is a full-size pickup truck aimed at people with serious towing and hauling needs. These are massively capable trucks, and when properly equipped the 3500 version can tow in excess of 37,000 pounds.  \n\nThe Ram Heavy Duty can seat up to six, and it competes with the Ford Super Duty and Chevrolet Silverado HD. Offered in 2500 and 3500 form, a 410-horsepower, 6.4-liter V-8 engine paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission is standard, while a Cummins turbo-diesel 6.7-liter inline-six that makes 370 or 420 hp and a six-speed automatic is available. The diesel engine makes as much as 1,075 pounds-feet of torque in the 3500. Rear-wheel drive is standard, and four-wheel drive is optional.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2022 Ram Heavy Duty?\n\nChrysler’s Uconnect 5 multimedia system has been added to Big Horn and higher trim levels. There’s a new Silver Edition for Big Horn and Lone Star trims, and new available camera features for towing let the driver see what’s behind a trailer using the rearview camera mirror and get a 360-degree view of only the trailer. \n\nWhat Features in the 2022 Ram Heavy Duty Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\nRegular cab\n8-foot cargo box\nRear-wheel drive\nEight-speed automatic transmission\nBluetooth connectivity\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nCrew cab or Mega cab\n6-foot, 4-inch cargo box\nFour-wheel drive\nSix-speed automatic transmission (diesel engine)\n8.4- or 12-inch touchscreen multimedia system\n360-degree camera system\nFront and rear park assist\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane-keeping assist\n50-gallon fuel tank\nIntegrated trailer-brake controller\nShould I Buy the 2022 Ram Heavy Duty?\n\nThe Ram Heavy Duty is a serious truck meant for completing seriously tough jobs. Then again, so are its rivals from Ford and Chevrolet. What sets the Ram apart from the competition is its driving refinement — especially when equipped with the optional rear air suspension — as well as the quality and design of the interiors in the Laramie Longhorn and Limited trims.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Ram Heavy Duty?\n\nThe Ram Heavy Duty is a full-size pickup truck aimed at people with serious towing and hauling needs. Offered in 2500 and 3500 form, it seats up to six and competes with the Chevrolet Silverado HD and Ford Super Duty. A 410-horsepower, 6.4-liter V-8 engine paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission is standard; also available is a Cummins turbo-diesel 6.7-liter inline-six that makes 370 or 420 hp, teamed with a six-speed automatic. The diesel engine makes as much as 1,075 pounds-feet of torque in the 3500. Rear-wheel drive is standard, with four-wheel drive optional.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nFor years builders of heavy-duty pickup trucks engaged in a war of numbers about power, load and tow ratings with incremental increases year to year or month to month that frequently saw the Ram place third. With the 2013 model’s significant increases, Ram now tops the list in available torque, fifth-wheel towing capacity and gross combined weight rating.\n\nThe frame, steering, brakes, transfer cases, transmissions, cooling and electrical systems have all undergone a thorough upgrade, while the interior has inherited all the additions and advancements Ram applied to the 2013 1500 series.\nNew for 2013\nIt would be easier to say the Hemi engine, manual transmission and most body panels aren’t new than to list everything that is.\n\nThe Ram 3500 has a new frame with stiffer material and stronger cross members, hydroformed main rails and fully boxed rear rails for a rigid platform. Provisions for an optional fifth-wheel/gooseneck hitch are built in, and the receiver hitch is bumped up to a Class V.\n\nThe new front suspension is wider and stronger, coupled to revised steering gear and linkage, and the rear suspension has been addressed for 3.5-ton payloads. Four-wheel-drive models bring back a front-axle disconnect system for improved mileage.\n\nThe Hemi gasoline engine isn’t new but for the first time in years is available on 3500 trucks. It’s considerably less expensive than a diesel, allows heavier front axle loads (like big plows) and can still pull and carry respectable trailers and loads.\n\nCummins diesel engines have been fitted with selective catalytic reduction, an emissions system that uses diesel exhaust fluid like Ford and GM diesels, and has been proven on Ram Chassis Cabs from 2010. Diesel output varies by transmission but all are more powerful than 2012, all are biodiesel capable, all have enhanced exhaust braking, and maintenance intervals are extended to 15,000 miles. Diesels also get dual radiators and transmission fluid coolers, and top models run a four-pinion 11.8-inch rear axle with aluminum cover for cooling.\n\nThe new electrical system has an interface that handles up to 72 inputs and outputs for everything from lighting control to throttle and transmission position, better integrating additions like winches, plows, warning lights, PTO equipment and campers.\nExterior \nThe 2013 2500/3500 echo the smaller Rams. Major body panels are unchanged from last year but most of the trim, grilles, wheels and accessories have been changed or refreshed.\n\nBy design the HDs require a bigger grille to feed and cool more powerful engines, so the HD is taller and has a larger hood to clear the big engines. On upper trim levels the headlights are projector units (halogen, no high-intensity discharge) with LED front signals, marker lamps and taillights.\n\nRam’s RamBox remains optional with plenty of enclosed storage in the bed sides, and now the keyless enter-and-go central locking system includes the RamBoxes and the tailgate. Note RamBox models have slightly lower load ratings and may interfere with utility racks, shells and campers, or fifth-wheel clearance.\n \nChrome, aluminum and polished stainless steel highlight exterior trim, big badges have been reoriented for fitting graphics and banners on a single panel, and rearview mirrors add power-folding units.\n\n\nInterior\nCabin environments range from vinyl-floor, urethane-steering-wheel simple to perforated leather upholstery and genuine wood trim heavily textured from exposure to barbed wire.\n\nMore real estate on the center panel allows for the Uconnect Access 8.4-inch screen. Truck controls are grouped by function and can be optioned for five auxiliary switches; the integrated trailer brake controller is now better located.\n\nRearview cameras include a higher-definition unit in the tailgate and a new choice next to the center brake light on the cab to ease fifth-wheel/gooseneck hitching.Under the Hood  \nYou’ll recognize all the engine sizes and transmission gears, but many of them are new. The 5.7 Hemi with 383 horsepower and 400 pounds-feet of torque is standard across the board, backed by a close-ratio six-speed automatic transmission; a factory-built compressed natural gas-capable version is offered in Crew Cab 2500s.\n\nWith a six-speed manual transmission — the only full-size pickup to offer one —the Cummins diesel is again rated at 350 hp but torque is up to 660 pounds-feet at 1,500 rpm.\n\nWith the Chrysler six-speed automatic the Cummins rates 370 hp at 2,800 rpm and 800 pounds-feet of torque at 1,600 rpm.\nOn 3500 high-output models, horsepower climbs to 385 and torque to 850 pounds-feet.\nSafety  Ram notes more than 45 safety features and systems on the new heavy duty, including but not limited to:\n\n\nFront and seat-mounted side airbags\nKnee bolsters\nAll-speed traction control\nElectronic stability control\nEnhanced accident response trailer\nTrailer-sway control\nIntegrated trailer brake control\nParkView backup camera\nAvailable rain-sensing wipers and SmartBeam headlamps",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe heavy-duty Ram 2500 and 3500 are available in three cab styles: regular cab, crew cab and mega cab. Buyers can choose single or dual rear wheels and a 6-foot-4-inch or 8-foot cargo box. The Hemi-powered Power Wagon is a rugged off-road version of the Ram HD. Heavy-duty versions of the Ram can seat up to six people in certain configurations, and competitors include the Chevrolet Silverado and Ford F-Series Super Duty.\n\nNew for 2012\nRam HD trucks with the 5.7-liter gas V-8 now have a six-speed automatic transmission. Other changes include:\n\nNew steering wheel with auxiliary controls\nNew black grille and bumpers on ST trim\n\nExterior\nRam HD pickups share headlamps and fenders with the 1500, but the grille is bigger to keep the engine cool while towing big trailers, and the hood is different to make room for the Cummins diesel. The front bumper has aggressive stamping. The single-piece chrome bumper wraps around the front of the truck, giving it a modern look and improved aerodynamics to help fuel economy. Ram HDs with dual rear wheels have sculpted fenders stamped into the sides of the cargo box. Other exterior features include:\n\nAdjustable tow mirrors with integrated turn signals\n17-inch steel wheels standard; 17-inch aluminum wheels optional\nAvailable roof-mounted running lights\nPower Wagon model features a two-tone color scheme, underbody skid plates, a Warn electric winch rated at 12,000 pounds, distinct stripes and lettering, and 33-inch BFGoodrich off-road tires\n\nInterior\nThe Ram HD’s cabin features all the high-quality materials and ergonomic and electronic options of the Ram 1500. The available integrated trailer-brake controller eliminates the need for an aftermarket kit to control a trailer’s electric brakes for improved towing control.\n\nThe front seats can be equipped with heat and ventilation functions. Rear-seat heating is also optional, as is a heated steering wheel.\n\nThe luxurious Laramie Longhorn has full leather seating with laser-etched bolsters, and the front seatbacks have metal buckles (bearing the Ram logo) with magnetic clasps, like a mailbag. An exclusive instrument cluster has the appearance of hand-wrought jewelry with six chrome gauge rings set against a painted taupe silver background and a tooled-metal Laramie Longhorn edition badge. The carpet is protected by specially designed all-weather rubber mats with polished metal badging and removable carpet inserts. The Laramie Longhorn is equipped with all of the standard equipment found on the top-level Ram Laramie plus navigation radio, remote start, a backup camera, front ventilated seats and rear heated seats. Other interior features include:\n\nFront bench or bucket seats in cloth or leather\nAvailable memory feature for seats, mirrors, pedals and radio\nOptional power-adjustable pedals\nOptional surround-sound system\nAvailable Mega Cab provides massive interior space\nNumerous storage options, including in-floor bins\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Ram Power Wagon features higher ground clearance, electric-locking front and rear differentials, an electronic disconnecting sway bar, Bilstein shocks and a 4.56 axle ratio for difficult off-road driving. Additional mechanical features include:\n\n383-horsepower, 5.7-liter V-8 with iron block and aluminum cylinder heads, cam-in-block, two valves per cylinder and 400 pounds-feet of torque\n350-hp, turbocharged 6.7-liter inline-six-cylinder diesel with iron block and cylinder head, cam-in-block, four valves per cylinder and 650 pounds-feet of torque with the manual, 800 with the automatic\nSix-speed manual (5.94:1 1st gear) standard with 6.7-liter diesel engine\nSix-speed automatic standard with 5.7-liter gas engine\nSix-speed automatic optional with 6.7-liter diesel engine\n\nSafety\nSafety features include:\n\nStandard all-disc antilock brakes\nStandard electronic stability system (single-rear-wheel models)\nStandard side curtain airbags\nOptional rear park assist\nOptional backup camera",
