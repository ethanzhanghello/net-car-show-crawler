      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Ram Heavy Duty?\n\nThe Ram Heavy Duty is a full-size pickup truck built for the toughest towing and hauling tasks. Conversely, the upper trim levels of these workhorse vehicles have opulent cabins filled with leather and luxurious trim, not to mention high-end stereos and user-friendly infotainment touchscreens. Available in 2500 and 3500 form, the Ram HD is powered by a standard 410-horsepower, 6.4-liter V-8 engine paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission. Optional is a Cummins turbo-diesel 6.7-liter inline-six that makes 370 or 420 hp and is coupled to a six-speed automatic. Rear-wheel drive is standard and four-wheel drive is optional. The mighty diesel engine produces as much as 1,075 pounds-feet of torque in the Ram 3500; when properly equipped, the 3500 can tow more than 37,000 pounds. The Chevrolet Silverado HD and Ford Super Duty are the Ram Heavy Duty’s primary rivals.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Ram Heavy Duty?\n\nA tailgate ajar warning lamp is now standard on every trim. Other than this minor addition, the 2024 Ram Heavy Duty is unchanged from 2023. \n\nWhat’s the Towing Capacity of the 2024 Ram Heavy Duty?\n\nThe Ram Heavy Duty’s maximum towing capacity ranges from 10,440 to 37,090 pounds, depending on powertrain, trim level and equipment.\n\nHow Much Does the 2024 Ram Heavy Duty Weigh?\n\nThe Ram Heavy Duty’s curb weight ranges from 6,001 to 7,390 pounds, depending on body style, trim level and equipment.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Ram Heavy Duty Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\nRegular cab\n8-foot cargo box\nRear-wheel drive\nEight-speed automatic transmission\nBluetooth connectivity\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nCrew cab or Mega Cab\n6-foot-4-inch cargo box\nFour-wheel drive\nSix-speed automatic transmission (diesel engine)\n8.4- or 12-inch touchscreen multimedia system\n12-inch digital instrument cluster\nDigital-camera rearview mirror\n360-degree camera system\nFront and rear park assist\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure steering assist\n50-gallon fuel tank\nIntegrated trailer brake controller\nTrailer reverse steering assist\nShould I Buy the 2024 Ram Heavy Duty?\n\nWithout a doubt, the Ram Heavy Duty is engineered first and foremost for hard work; it’s overkill for anyone simply looking to tow a couple of dirt bikes or load the cargo bed with bags of topsoil at a local garden store. The Ram distances itself from rivals at Ford and Chevy by the quality of its suspension, particularly when ordered with the optional rear air suspension. Higher trims like the Limited are pricey, but they have acres of space inside and some of the most elegant trim available in any pickup.",

      "expert_review": "Is the Ram 2500 a Good Pickup Truck?\n\nA revised Cummins turbo-diesel six-cylinder engine with 1,075 pounds-feet of torque makes the refreshed 2025 Ram 2500 heavy-duty pickup one of the slickest-driving HD trucks on the market — even if it’ll set you back more than $12,000 over the standard V-8.\n\nHow Does the Ram 2500 Compare With Other Pickup Trucks?\n\nThe 2025 model year brings some good quality-of-life updates to the heavy-duty Ram, but the Ford F-Series Super Duty remains the torque and max-towing king. Still, the Ram Power Wagon and diesel-powered Ram Rebel are among the best do-it-all off-road pickups, even when compared with the Chevrolet Silverado 2500 HD ZR2 and Ford F-250 Tremor.\n\nChances are, you’ve already made up your mind about the 2025 Ram 2500. Or maybe your mind didn’t need makin’ —– you just knew. I’ve yet to meet a heavy-duty truck owner who wasn’t staunchly loyal to their brand, rarely (if ever at all) swapping teams because they preferred the outgoing truck over the new one.\n\nAnd if you genuinely use said HD truck as intended, you also already know if this is the truck for you based on its payload ratings, towing capacity and price. Here you go: For the 2500, max towing is 20,000 pounds, max payload is 4,420 pounds, and the base price is $47,660, including destination. Naturally, these ratings are achieved with different 2500 configurations, but you know if it’s at least worth your time.\n\nRelated: Updated 2025 Ram HD Starts at $47,560 for 2500, $48,565 for 3500\n\nAt Ram’s invitation, I traveled to the Nevada desert to drive the Ram 2500 on- and off-road as well as tow with the big pickup. (Cars.com pays for its own lodging and travel expenses when attending manufacturer-sponsored events.) With 2025 being a refresh year for Ram’s HD line, the biggest news is the updated Cummins diesel powertrain, now solely offered in “high-output” configuration instead of the prior iteration’s two-tier output setup.\n\nHow Powerful Is the Ram’s New Cummins Diesel Engine?\n\nThe revised turbo-diesel 6.7-liter inline-six engine is quite the stump puller. Cummins reworked the block, cylinder head, glow plugs and turbo; it also added bigger valves, a higher-pressure fueling system and a new intake manifold for a stunning 430 horsepower and 1,075 pounds-feet of torque. All of this hippo-tenderizing twist is manhandled by a new eight-speed automatic transmission, which replaces the prior six-speed automatic.\n\nRam says all of this in symphony results in a diesel truck that’s quieter and more efficient than ever before, if and only if you can swallow the Cummins’ whopping $12,595 buy-in, which is in the ballpark of what optional diesel engines from Ford and Chevy run. For those who don’t need or want this giga-six, the familiar 6.4-liter Hemi gas V-8 remains the standard engine and makes 405 hp and 429 pounds-feet of torque.\n\nI snagged seat time in both Laramie and Rebel trim levels with the new Cummins diesel, both completely unladen. From the program’s base camp in Laughlin, Nev., I pointed the roadbound Laramie up and over the Union Pass, Arizona’s now-legendary steep-grade mountain highway pass that is used for SAE International’s towing standard.\n\n2025 Ram 2500 Laramie | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\nWhich Ram 2500 Engine Is Best?\n\nIt’s almost immediately clear that the Cummins is the powertrain to get. A 0-60 mph time of just under 7 seconds means the 2500 out-drags most SUVs and minivans and can also menace stuff like the Subaru BRZ sports car between lights. Crucially, the shocking torque makes this hefty truck far more responsive in a straight line than its size, appearance and purpose would suggest.\n\nSurprising straight-line performance is nothing new for the over-torqued HD segment, but this H.O. Cummins is a peach. Power never, ever seems to drop off, and attaining supra-legal cruising speeds is both satisfying and dangerously easy. Once in motion, the unladen diesel Laramie rode well for an HD truck; it’s still a bit rough around the edges in both ride quality and body control, but just as you don’t source a Porsche 911 GT3 RS for silent, silky chauffeur services, don’t look to an HD truck if you want the cushiness of a light-duty pickup.\n\nHow Does the Ram 2500 Tow?\n\nTowing time. The same-spec 2500 Laramie was hitched to a flat trailer carrying a Dodge Ram SRT-10 (the Viper-powered truck!), a combo good for around 8,500 pounds that, in the meaty grips of the Cummins, felt more like a few bags of Lay’s Classic chips in the bed. Alright, not that carefree, but the 1,075 pounds-feet of torque made short, short work of pulling the lovely Viper truck over the Davis Dam grade. Ride quality was expectedly improved with the additional weight of the trailer, and the Ram’s myriad accoutrement of cameras and tow settings meant this greenhorn hauler would’ve had no qualms draggin’ the Viper truck cross-country if need be.\n\nThe standard gas V-8 is unchanged, and while it’s still as buttery as before, it doesn’t have the same refinement and towing capability of the diesel, and it feels a bit more strained and worked. I absolutely don’t think picking the Hemi is a mistake — it’s certainly a solid financial play — but I also cannot stress just how lovely the Cummins is for towing and day-to-day driving.\n\nScreen Updates\n\nOther than some slight aesthetic tweaks to the exterior — including standard LED headlights — we’ve got new interior displays to shorten those workdays. An 8.4-inch Uconnect 5 touchscreen infotainment system is now standard, up from the 2024 truck’s tiny 5-inch screen. The optional 12-inch vertically oriented touchscreen has been revised for better readability.\n\nWant even more screen real estate? A new 14.5-inch touchscreen is the top-line infotainment display, and the Ram also offers a 12.3-inch digital driver display and a 10.25-inch passenger display for music and navigation functions, as well as phone projection via HDMI cable. At least on the mid-to-top trims, the cabin is a nice place to wick away the worksite commute, but even then, you’re still unable to get a telescoping steering wheel — you’ll have to make do with just tilt.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2025 Ram Heavy Duty Up Close: Refreshed Humongous Hauler\n2025 Ram 2500 and 3500 Heavy Duty Pack More Tech and Capability\nPickup Truck Buying Guide: How Much Truck Do You Need?\nRefreshed 2025 Ram 1500 Runs Away With Full-Size Pickup Challenge Win\nShop for a 2025 Ram 2500 Near You\nCan You Get the Cummins in a Ram Power Wagon?\n\nSpeaking of egregiously missing options, the eternally-badass Power Wagon is still exclusively available with the gas V-8. Those who want the Cummins in a more dirt-flavored configuration must settle for the (still aggro) 2500 Rebel, which gets goodies like all-terrain tires and an electronic locking rear differential but leaves the Power Wagon’s locking front differential and disconnecting front stabilizer bar out of the equation.\n\nI’m a diesel dude, so I picked the Rebel for our brief foray into the wilds of the Arizona desert. Even without the Power Wagon’s impressive articulation, the Rebel subjugated the terrain with unstoppable momentum and pure brute force. As it was a guided 4×4 tour, we took it fairly easy and stayed well below the Rebel’s limits. Still, it’s always fun to stick a wheel in the air and to drive an off-road truck that merely needs to be pointed in the right direction to billy-goat its way over rockfalls, mud slides and sand dunes.\n\nGoodness, all this yapping for you to have likely already made your decision when you saw “Ram” in the headline. You’re gonna buy what you’re gonna buy, but I highly recommend the Cummins — who doesn’t want four figures’ worth of torque?\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2022 Ram Heavy Duty?\n\nThe Ram Heavy Duty is a full-size pickup truck aimed at people with serious towing and hauling needs. These are massively capable trucks, and when properly equipped the 3500 version can tow in excess of 37,000 pounds.  \n\nThe Ram Heavy Duty can seat up to six, and it competes with the Ford Super Duty and Chevrolet Silverado HD. Offered in 2500 and 3500 form, a 410-horsepower, 6.4-liter V-8 engine paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission is standard, while a Cummins turbo-diesel 6.7-liter inline-six that makes 370 or 420 hp and a six-speed automatic is available. The diesel engine makes as much as 1,075 pounds-feet of torque in the 3500. Rear-wheel drive is standard, and four-wheel drive is optional.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2022 Ram Heavy Duty?\n\nChrysler’s Uconnect 5 multimedia system has been added to Big Horn and higher trim levels. There’s a new Silver Edition for Big Horn and Lone Star trims, and new available camera features for towing let the driver see what’s behind a trailer using the rearview camera mirror and get a 360-degree view of only the trailer. \n\nWhat Features in the 2022 Ram Heavy Duty Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\nRegular cab\n8-foot cargo box\nRear-wheel drive\nEight-speed automatic transmission\nBluetooth connectivity\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nCrew cab or Mega cab\n6-foot, 4-inch cargo box\nFour-wheel drive\nSix-speed automatic transmission (diesel engine)\n8.4- or 12-inch touchscreen multimedia system\n360-degree camera system\nFront and rear park assist\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane-keeping assist\n50-gallon fuel tank\nIntegrated trailer-brake controller\nShould I Buy the 2022 Ram Heavy Duty?\n\nThe Ram Heavy Duty is a serious truck meant for completing seriously tough jobs. Then again, so are its rivals from Ford and Chevrolet. What sets the Ram apart from the competition is its driving refinement — especially when equipped with the optional rear air suspension — as well as the quality and design of the interiors in the Laramie Longhorn and Limited trims.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Ram Heavy Duty?\n\nThe Ram 2500 and 3500 Heavy Duty is a full-size pickup truck aimed at people with serious towing and hauling needs as opposed to those who make the occasional weekend run to the home improvement store. It seats up to six and competes with the Ford Super Duty and Chevrolet Silverado HD. A 410-horsepower, 6.4-liter V-8 engine is standard, while a Cummins turbo-diesel 6.7-liter inline-six that makes as much as 1,000 pounds-feet of torque in the 3500 model is available. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Ram Heavy Duty?\n\nA Night Edition for Big Horn and Laramie trim levels includes monochromatic styling, black 20-inch wheels, black badges and a black interior. Lane-keeping assist, blind spot warning with trailer coverage and trailer tire pressure monitoring are available. Long-bed crew-cab trucks can have an optional 50-gallon fuel tank. \n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Ram Heavy Duty Are Most Important?\n\nThe standard 6.4-liter gas V-8 serves up more than enough capability for most towing and hauling challenges. With 410 hp and 429 pounds-feet of torque, this is the only engine offered for the Power Wagon, the Heavy Duty’s dedicated off-road model. If you choose the high-end Laramie Longhorn or Limited trim, be prepared for a truck interior like you’ve never seen; the materials quality and finishes put many luxury cars to shame.\n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Ram Heavy Duty?\n\nThe Ram Heavy Duty should definitely be on your test-drive list if you need a full-size pickup truck for serious work. What sets it apart from the competition is its driving refinement — especially when equipped with the optional rear air suspension — and the quality and design of the Laramie Longhorn’s and Limited’s interiors has raised the bar for all full-size trucks.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2021 Ram Heavy Duty?\n\nThe Ram HD is a full-size pickup truck aimed at people with serious towing and hauling needs, as opposed to those who make the occasional weekend run to the home improvement store. It seats up to six and competes with the Ford Super Duty and Chevrolet Silverado HD. Available in 2500 and 3500 form, a 410-horsepower, 6.4-liter V-8 engine is standard, while a Cummins turbo-diesel 6.7-liter inline-six-cylinder is available. The diesel engine makes as much as 1,000 pounds-feet of torque in the 3500.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2021 Ram Heavy Duty?\n\nA new Limited Night Edition design package arrives this year. It includes monochromatic styling, black 20-inch wheels and special badges.   \n\nWhat Features in the 2021 Ram Heavy Duty Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\nRegular cab\n8-foot cargo box\nRear-wheel drive\nEight-speed automatic transmission\nBluetooth connectivity\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nCrew cab or Mega cab\n6-foot, 4-inch cargo box\nFour-wheel drive\nSix-speed automatic transmission (diesel engine)\n8.4- or 12-inch touchscreen multimedia system\n360-degree camera system\nFront and rear park assist\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane keep assist\n50-gallon fuel tank\nIntegrated trailer-brake controller\nShould I Buy the 2021 Ram Heavy Duty?\n\nThe Ram HD should definitely be on your test-drive list if you need a full-size pickup truck for serious work. What sets it apart from the competition is its driving refinement — especially when equipped with the optional rear air suspension — as well as the quality and design of the interiors in the Laramie Longhorn and Limited. These trim levels have raised the bar for all full-size trucks.",

      "expert_review": "When it comes to off-road pickup trucks, there are varying degrees of capability usually correlating with what the goals are for the truck and what you’re willing to spend on one. Looking for something that’s just a bit more capable, with a mild upgrade or two over a regular 4×4 pickup? Something like Ford’s Tremor packages might be a good idea. Are you looking for something that combines capability and luxury? GMC’s AT4X trims fit that bill. Want to go ripping across the steppe at full chat, pouncing over ripples and jumps? Any Ford with a Raptor badge will do that. But if you want something that’s more of a workhorse and less of a plaything, few trucks can compete with the Ram 2500 Power Wagon.\n\nRelated: 2023 Ram 2500 Heavy Duty Rebel Joins the Off-Road Party\n\nBased on the heavy-duty Ram 2500 crew-cab pickup, the Power Wagon features front and rear locking differentials, a massive suspension lift and even a standard winch built into the front bumper for dragging you out of sticky situations in the rough.\n\nBut a vocal group of customers have lamented something about the Power Wagon: It’s great for doing what it does (crawling over just about anything), but not for doing things an HD truck is good at (towing and hauling). So Ram has come up with this, the 2023 Ram Heavy Duty 2500 Rebel, to fill in the very few spots where the Power Wagon is deficient and that Ram customers want addressed.\n\nWhat It Boils Down To\n\nEssentially, think of the new ‘23 Ram 2500 Heavy Duty Rebel as a Power Wagon with bigger wheels, better towing options, no front locking differential or standard 12,000-pound Warn winch (it’s optional), and one key engine option: Ram’s Cummins turbo-diesel. See, one of the biggest complaints about the Power Wagon from would-be customers is that you can’t get it with the diesel, but Ram told us on several occasions that the Power Wagon’s standard integrated winch makes the diesel a nonstarter — the cooling system of the diesel engine goes where the winch is located.\n\nIn the Rebel, the winch is optional, making the turbo-diesel 6.7-liter inline-six-cylinder possible. The diesel engine adds around $9,600 to the truck’s price tag, and it makes 370 horsepower and a whopping 850 pounds-feet of torque and works with a six-speed automatic transmission. The standard engine is the 6.4-liter heavy-duty Hemi V-8 making 410 hp and 429 pounds-feet of torque that’s mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission.\n\nWhy would you want this? Well, think of the new 2500 Rebel as a direct response to the Ford F-250 Tremor, itself a package meant to combine the best elements of a towing HD truck and an off-road-capable HD truck. Your best tow rating for a Ram 2500 Power Wagon is 10,590 pounds, but the Ram 2500 Rebel can drag up to 16,870 pounds. Payload capacity is up significantly, too, from a high of 1,630 pounds in the Power Wagon to 3,140 pounds in the Rebel. Now, the most interesting bit is that these big numbers aren’t achieved with the optional diesel engine — they’re gas-to-gas comparisons. The diesel engine itself is so heavy that its payload and towing ratings (1,970 pounds and 14,920 pounds, respectively) are less than the gas-engine Rebel’s when equipped with the 4.10 final drive gear.\n\nWhat makes the Rebel able to achieve these numbers is its slightly different suspension, a five-link coil-spring rear suspension that’s just like the Power Wagon’s but enhanced in ways that emphasize towing capability over ultimate off-road prowess. It also offers an optional rear air suspension, something the Power Wagon doesn’t have, but loses the disconnecting front sway bars that enable the Power Wagon to achieve better front suspension articulation. The Rebel has also been designed to have a higher gross vehicle weight rating.\n\nSo, you’ve given up some of the Power Wagon’s crawl-over-anything ability in exchange for a better towing setup — which is apparently exactly what a number of would-be Power Wagon buyers want. I’d say think of the Rebel as “Power Wagon Lite,” but that’s not entirely accurate. It might not have all of the Power Wagon’s off-road prowess, but it delivers other abilities the Power Wagon doesn’t.\n\nOn the Street\n\nYour first challenge in driving the new 2500 Rebel is getting into it, as it doesn’t come with running boards (fixed and powered versions are optional). Getting into the super-lifted cabin is quite literally a climb. Like the Power Wagon, the Rebel gets a lifted suspension, but it features larger 20-inch wheels (18-inch wheels are a late option) that aren’t beadlock-capable running 33-inch tires versus the Power Wagon’s 17-inch wheels and tires. Once you’ve lifted yourself into the cabin, you’ll realize that Ram’s HD trucks are still just a tick behind the industry in some ways. Yes, you can option the cabin out with different interior treatments on the Rebel, including swaddling it in leather, but certain amenities are absent, like a telescoping steering wheel or wireless phone charging.\n\nThe cabin itself is still a stunning place to be, however. The high seating position provides a commanding view over everything outside the truck, though you’re so high that it often obscures your immediate surroundings — you’ll be relying a lot on your surround-view camera system and will need to be careful if you have little ones about; they can easily disappear from view if they’re close to this massive truck.\n\n“Massive” is the operative word in discussing how the 2500 Rebel drives, too. This is first and foremost a heavy-duty truck, not some smoothed-out light-duty 1500 version for commuting and family transport — and it drives like it. From its unusual quick-ratio steering to its difficulty navigating any sort of parking lot, you’ll feel every inch and ounce of the 2500 Rebel’s bulk. That’s a benefit for towing a heavy trailer or filling up the bed with logs, and it reinforces the idea that this really is a specialty vehicle built for a specific purpose. Unless you live somewhere out in the boonies of Alaska and commute to the local supermarket via logging roads, the 2500 Rebel is too much truck for casual everyday use.\n\nPick Your Power\n\nMy test vehicle came equipped with the 6.4-liter Hemi V-8 engine, and it’s still a fantastic powertrain. There’s no electrified anything in this powertrain, and there likely won’t be for quite some time — HD pickup duty cycles don’t really fit well with the new electric pickup trend (or not yet, anyway). But power is plentiful, the transmission shifts as smoothly as it can (it is an HD truck, after all), and there isn’t really much in the way of undue noise from the powertrain, wind or road even with its Goodyear Wrangler DuraTrac all-terrain tires. It rides well, it tracks well on the highway, and it soaks up cratered city streets with aplomb.\n\nCars.com Managing Editor Joe Bruzek had some time in the diesel version of the Ram 2500 Rebel and reports it’s still a torque monster of an engine, both to the Rebel’s benefit and detriment. While having all that torque on tap makes it entertaining and its idling rattle makes it sound like a school bus, it’s easy to overcome the Wrangler DuraTrac’s on-road traction when the pavement gets a bit slippery. That’s due in part to the rush of power the diesel brings even when you’re light on the accelerator pedal. Still, for people wanting nearly double the torque that’s available in the gas V-8 and who are willing to tack another 10 grand onto their purchase price, the diesel is now available.\n\nUnlike the Power Wagon, which is optimized primarily for off-road ability, the Rebel skirts the difference between streets and scrubland. It’s meant to tow a trailer full of ATVs as much as join them on the trails, which makes its on-road performance an important aspect of its evaluation. Sadly, our evaluation of the 2500 Rebel is incomplete, as we were unable to tow with it or take it off-road (it arrived over the winter 2022 holidays in Michigan). We’re hoping we can do a more extensive test of the 2500 Rebel later in the year, when warmer weather and access to off-road environments will give us a fuller picture of how the package works.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2022 Ram 1500 Rebel G/T: Max Towing and Daily Driving\nJ.D. Power 2021 Initial Quality Study: Ram on Top, Wireless Phone Connectivity Spells Trouble\nWhat’s New With Diesel Trucks and SUVs in 2022?\nResearch the Ram 2500\nThe Latest Pickup Truck News\nPlaced Between Luxury and Capability\n\nThe 2500 Rebel is meant to slot into the Ram HD lineup between the mainstream Laramie trim and the ultimate off-road Power Wagon. The starting price, however, isn’t really that much different than a Power Wagon: The Rebel comes only with a 6-foot-4-inch bed and four-wheel drive, and its starting price is $70,220 (all prices include destination charges). But a Power Wagon starts at $71,240 and includes a considerable amount of extra standard equipment. My 2500 Rebel test vehicle came to a grand total of $77,395, but if you opt for the diesel engine and start checking all the boxes you can, you can easily approach (but not quite hit) the $100,000 mark. Interestingly, thanks to that diesel option, a fully loaded 2500 Rebel will come in around $10,000 more expensive than a fully loaded Power Wagon.\n\nThe addition of the 2500 Rebel makes for an interesting option for someone wanting a number of the Power Wagon’s off-road goodies but still needing some traditional heavy-duty pickup capability. If you don’t plan on towing all that much, the Power Wagon might be a better option — but if you have more mixed-use needs, the Rebel makes more sense.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "They’re big, they’re beefy, they have an optional torque-monster engine — and they’re here. The new 2019 Ram 2500 and 3500 heavy-duty pickup trucks have hit the streets, and PickupTrucks.com has the full first drive of these new rigs. Ram launched the new trucks at an event in Southern California, and we were there to drive a number of different configurations — both loaded up with massive trailers and empty, from the immensely capable off-road Power Wagon to the big daddy Ram 3500 dually.\n\nRelated: 2019 Ram 2500/3500 First Drive: Going for the Beef\n\nWhat’s new for 2019? Aside from some styling updates outside and even more sumptuous cabins inside, the big news is the updated Cummins turbo-diesel engine. The turbocharged 6.7-liter inline-six-cylinder engine cranks out 400 horsepower and a whopping 1,000 pounds-feet of torque – the most ever generated by a factory truck powertrain. That engine is mated to an upgraded six-speed Aisin transmission, while 6.4-liter Hemi V-8 gasoline-powered HD trucks get a new eight-speed automatic and a rotary-knob gear selector.\n\nWe drove a bunch of versions of the new HD pickups, from the entry-level 2500 Tradesman work truck to the 3500 Longhorn. But our favorite truck of the day was the new 2019 Power Wagon. The new transmission provides a super-low 1st gear, creating a low-range crawl ratio of 51:1 — giving it rock-crawling skills on par with a Jeep Wrangler Rubicon. Add in the push-button front sway-bar disconnects and locking differentials, and it’s practically a three-ton mountain goat.\n\nClick on over to PickupTrucks.com to read our First Drive of the new 2019 Ram heavy duties.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Ram is expanding its already diverse heavy-duty pickup truck lineup with two new packages intended to offer buyers distinct looks at an affordable price. The 2026 Ram 2500 Black Express and Warlock each bundle unique appearance and trim tweaks with basic comfort upgrades. It might sound like some higher-up in Ram’s marketing department expensed a Dungeons & Dragons rule book to come up with naming ideas, but really, the brand is just mining its history — Ram’s first Black Express debuted in 2013, while the Warlock dates all the way back to 1976. (Both are also currently offered on the light-duty Ram 1500.)\n\nRelated: 2025 Ram 2500 Review: Freshened Freight Train\n\nBoth new packages are based on the entry-level Ram 2500 Tradesman and are only available with the crew cab. Ram’s 6.4-liter Hemi V-8 is standard in both trucks, providing 405 horsepower and 429 pounds-feet of torque. Buyers can also spec both the Black Express and the Warlock with the 6.7-liter Cummins diesel inline-six-cylinder, which produces 430 hp and a hulking 1,075 pounds-feet of torque but erodes the value proposition with its $10,000-plus price tag. Ram refers to the Black Express and Warlock as “sport trucks,” which may be less of a stretch with that sort of output but doesn’t quite seem applicable to a heavy-duty truck.\n\nBlack Express\n2026 Ram 2500 Black Express | Manufacturer image\n\nBlack Express buyers have a choice of rear- or four-wheel drive and a long or short bed. The truck wears a domed and vented hood, body-color bumpers and grille trim, and black 20-inch wheels. In addition to its namesake hue, the Black Express is also available in Bright White, Ceramic Grey, Flame Red, Forged Blue, Granite Crystal, Molten Red and Silver Zynith.\n\nThe Black Express is also fitted with power-telescoping tow mirrors and black side steps. In place of the Tradesman’s vinyl seat and flooring, it has cloth and carpet. Front and rear parking sensors are also included.\n\nWarlock\n\nOnly available with 4WD and the short box, the Warlock features black fender flares, bumpers and grille trim and a black Warlock bedside decal. It, too, is fitted with a cloth bench seat, carpet and the upgraded mirrors and is available in the same selection of paint colors. But the Warlock forgoes the Black Express’ cab step and parking sensors in favor of off-road gear: 20-inch wheels wearing 34-inch all-terrain tires, Bilstein shock absorbers, a limited-slip rear differential and a skid plate protecting the transfer case.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nRam Announces 10-Year, 100,000-Mile Limited Powertrain Warranty\nUpdated 2025 Ram HD Starts at $47,560 for 2500, $48,565 for 3500\nWhich Cars Are Made Outside the U.S.?\nWhat Are the Best MPG Pickup Trucks?\nMore Ram News\nAvailability and Pricing\n\nOrders are open for the 2026 Ram 2500 Black Express and Warlock now, with deliveries to begin in the third quarter of 2025. Ram is charging $2,495 for the Black Express, while the Warlock’s sturdier off-road equipment demands a $2,995 premium. That brings the base price of the trucks (including the destination charge) up to $53,735 and $57,165, respectively.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe heavy-duty Ram 2500 and 3500 are available in three cab styles: regular cab, crew cab and mega cab. Buyers can choose single or dual rear wheels and a 6-foot-4-inch or 8-foot cargo box. The Hemi-powered Power Wagon is a rugged off-road version of the Ram HD. Heavy-duty versions of the Ram can seat up to six people in certain configurations, and competitors include the Chevrolet Silverado and Ford F-Series Super Duty.\n\nNew for 2012\nRam HD trucks with the 5.7-liter gas V-8 now have a six-speed automatic transmission. Other changes include:\n\nNew steering wheel with auxiliary controls\nNew black grille and bumpers on ST trim\n\nExterior\nRam HD pickups share headlamps and fenders with the 1500, but the grille is bigger to keep the engine cool while towing big trailers, and the hood is different to make room for the Cummins diesel. The front bumper has aggressive stamping. The single-piece chrome bumper wraps around the front of the truck, giving it a modern look and improved aerodynamics to help fuel economy. Ram HDs with dual rear wheels have sculpted fenders stamped into the sides of the cargo box. Other exterior features include:\n\nAdjustable tow mirrors with integrated turn signals\n17-inch steel wheels standard; 17-inch aluminum wheels optional\nAvailable roof-mounted running lights\nPower Wagon model features a two-tone color scheme, underbody skid plates, a Warn electric winch rated at 12,000 pounds, distinct stripes and lettering, and 33-inch BFGoodrich off-road tires\n\nInterior\nThe Ram HD’s cabin features all the high-quality materials and ergonomic and electronic options of the Ram 1500. The available integrated trailer-brake controller eliminates the need for an aftermarket kit to control a trailer’s electric brakes for improved towing control.\n\nThe front seats can be equipped with heat and ventilation functions. Rear-seat heating is also optional, as is a heated steering wheel.\n\nThe luxurious Laramie Longhorn has full leather seating with laser-etched bolsters, and the front seatbacks have metal buckles (bearing the Ram logo) with magnetic clasps, like a mailbag. An exclusive instrument cluster has the appearance of hand-wrought jewelry with six chrome gauge rings set against a painted taupe silver background and a tooled-metal Laramie Longhorn edition badge. The carpet is protected by specially designed all-weather rubber mats with polished metal badging and removable carpet inserts. The Laramie Longhorn is equipped with all of the standard equipment found on the top-level Ram Laramie plus navigation radio, remote start, a backup camera, front ventilated seats and rear heated seats. Other interior features include:\n\nFront bench or bucket seats in cloth or leather\nAvailable memory feature for seats, mirrors, pedals and radio\nOptional power-adjustable pedals\nOptional surround-sound system\nAvailable Mega Cab provides massive interior space\nNumerous storage options, including in-floor bins\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Ram Power Wagon features higher ground clearance, electric-locking front and rear differentials, an electronic disconnecting sway bar, Bilstein shocks and a 4.56 axle ratio for difficult off-road driving. Additional mechanical features include:\n\n383-horsepower, 5.7-liter V-8 with iron block and aluminum cylinder heads, cam-in-block, two valves per cylinder and 400 pounds-feet of torque\n350-hp, turbocharged 6.7-liter inline-six-cylinder diesel with iron block and cylinder head, cam-in-block, four valves per cylinder and 650 pounds-feet of torque with the manual, 800 with the automatic\nSix-speed manual (5.94:1 1st gear) standard with 6.7-liter diesel engine\nSix-speed automatic standard with 5.7-liter gas engine\nSix-speed automatic optional with 6.7-liter diesel engine\n\nSafety\nSafety features include:\n\nStandard all-disc antilock brakes\nStandard electronic stability system (single-rear-wheel models)\nStandard side curtain airbags\nOptional rear park assist\nOptional backup camera",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nFor years builders of heavy-duty pickup trucks engaged in a war of numbers about power, load and tow ratings with incremental increases year to year or month to month that frequently saw the Ram place third. With the 2013 model’s significant increases, Ram now tops the list in available torque, fifth-wheel towing capacity and gross combined weight rating.\n\nThe frame, steering, brakes, transfer cases, transmissions, cooling and electrical systems have all undergone a thorough upgrade, while the interior has inherited all the additions and advancements Ram applied to the 2013 1500 series.\nNew for 2013\nIt would be easier to say the Hemi engine, manual transmission and most body panels aren’t new than to list everything that is.\n\nThe Ram 3500 has a new frame with stiffer material and stronger cross members, hydroformed main rails and fully boxed rear rails for a rigid platform. Provisions for an optional fifth-wheel/gooseneck hitch are built in, and the receiver hitch is bumped up to a Class V.\n\nThe new front suspension is wider and stronger, coupled to revised steering gear and linkage, and the rear suspension has been addressed for 3.5-ton payloads. Four-wheel-drive models bring back a front-axle disconnect system for improved mileage.\n\nThe Hemi gasoline engine isn’t new but for the first time in years is available on 3500 trucks. It’s considerably less expensive than a diesel, allows heavier front axle loads (like big plows) and can still pull and carry respectable trailers and loads.\n\nCummins diesel engines have been fitted with selective catalytic reduction, an emissions system that uses diesel exhaust fluid like Ford and GM diesels, and has been proven on Ram Chassis Cabs from 2010. Diesel output varies by transmission but all are more powerful than 2012, all are biodiesel capable, all have enhanced exhaust braking, and maintenance intervals are extended to 15,000 miles. Diesels also get dual radiators and transmission fluid coolers, and top models run a four-pinion 11.8-inch rear axle with aluminum cover for cooling.\n\nThe new electrical system has an interface that handles up to 72 inputs and outputs for everything from lighting control to throttle and transmission position, better integrating additions like winches, plows, warning lights, PTO equipment and campers.\nExterior \nThe 2013 2500/3500 echo the smaller Rams. Major body panels are unchanged from last year but most of the trim, grilles, wheels and accessories have been changed or refreshed.\n\nBy design the HDs require a bigger grille to feed and cool more powerful engines, so the HD is taller and has a larger hood to clear the big engines. On upper trim levels the headlights are projector units (halogen, no high-intensity discharge) with LED front signals, marker lamps and taillights.\n\nRam’s RamBox remains optional with plenty of enclosed storage in the bed sides, and now the keyless enter-and-go central locking system includes the RamBoxes and the tailgate. Note RamBox models have slightly lower load ratings and may interfere with utility racks, shells and campers, or fifth-wheel clearance.\n \nChrome, aluminum and polished stainless steel highlight exterior trim, big badges have been reoriented for fitting graphics and banners on a single panel, and rearview mirrors add power-folding units.\n\n\nInterior\nCabin environments range from vinyl-floor, urethane-steering-wheel simple to perforated leather upholstery and genuine wood trim heavily textured from exposure to barbed wire.\n\nMore real estate on the center panel allows for the Uconnect Access 8.4-inch screen. Truck controls are grouped by function and can be optioned for five auxiliary switches; the integrated trailer brake controller is now better located.\n\nRearview cameras include a higher-definition unit in the tailgate and a new choice next to the center brake light on the cab to ease fifth-wheel/gooseneck hitching.Under the Hood  \nYou’ll recognize all the engine sizes and transmission gears, but many of them are new. The 5.7 Hemi with 383 horsepower and 400 pounds-feet of torque is standard across the board, backed by a close-ratio six-speed automatic transmission; a factory-built compressed natural gas-capable version is offered in Crew Cab 2500s.\n\nWith a six-speed manual transmission — the only full-size pickup to offer one —the Cummins diesel is again rated at 350 hp but torque is up to 660 pounds-feet at 1,500 rpm.\n\nWith the Chrysler six-speed automatic the Cummins rates 370 hp at 2,800 rpm and 800 pounds-feet of torque at 1,600 rpm.\nOn 3500 high-output models, horsepower climbs to 385 and torque to 850 pounds-feet.\nSafety  Ram notes more than 45 safety features and systems on the new heavy duty, including but not limited to:\n\n\nFront and seat-mounted side airbags\nKnee bolsters\nAll-speed traction control\nElectronic stability control\nEnhanced accident response trailer\nTrailer-sway control\nIntegrated trailer brake control\nParkView backup camera\nAvailable rain-sensing wipers and SmartBeam headlamps",

      "expert_review": "After reading PickupTrucks.com’s 2014 Ultimate Three-Quarter-Ton HD Challenge, I knew I had to get some time behind the wheel of Ram’s new-for-2013 heavy duty to see if the new truck was that much different from what I remembered about my last HD truck experience.\n\nWhen I received the 2014 three-quarter-ton Ram 2500, I incorrectly assumed it wouldn’t be much different than I recalled — a rocky ride, worklike interior materials and transmission shifting points skewed drastically toward towing and hauling. What I found was almost the opposite: When unloaded, the ride is smooth and the transmission practically glides from one gear to the next. And our Big Horn trim surrounded us in luxury.\n\nExterior & Styling\nWhether you are a Ram truck fan or not, the truth is Ram is making some good-looking pickups. The 2500/3500 trucks have smooth body lines; curved, muscular front ends; and a powerful-looking stance. While beauty is in the eye of the beholder, we liked the design of the Ram 2500.\n\nOur test truck came with the RamBox option, which can be a polarizing topic. On one hand, having the ability to lock up items outside the cab is a great feature. On the other, the bed’s cargo capacity shrinks by a significant amount, and the bed width is much narrower.\n\nA big issue for us is bed height. Our test model’s bed height measured 59 inches from the ground to the bed floor. At 5 feet 6 inches tall, entering and exiting the truck — or using the RamBox system — was a challenge. In fact, getting in and out of the truck was a major hassle without the factory running boards.\n\nDuring my week testing the Ram, I spoke with several pickup fans and a local Chrysler salesman. They all had the same thought: Without side steps, the truck is difficult to use if you are an average height.\n\nMany farmers, according to the Chrysler salesman, love the Ram but complain about getting in and out of it. In our experience, it rides high enough to go over fields covered with cornstalks, but grabbing irrigation or fence supplies out of the bed is extremely difficult.\n\nNick Cappa, Ram communications manager, says the trucks have always been tall and this is an advantage.\n\n“The height advantage helps overall ground clearance, allows for more suspension travel and articulation from a packaging standpoint, and it looks great,” Cappa said. “The rear link coil helps us with a taller truck because it keeps the axle positioned during dynamic maneuvers, even when loaded. Leaf springs don’t handle lateral load very well. So although our truck rides slightly taller, we still handle better in the turns and ride better on- and off-road.”\n\nIn comparison to other truckmakers, the Ram 2500 has the tallest bed height among three-quarter-ton pickups. In fact, it’s actually 2.5 inches taller than a comparable Ram 3500 dualie.\n\nInterior\nThe interior of the Ram 2500 (especially our Big Horn trim) is well done. As someone who has driven many Ram trim levels, the Big Horn trim offers many of the best features of the Laramie Longhorn and is a good upgrade from the SLT.\n\nOur Ram had 18-inch forged and polished alloy wheels, a limited-slip rear differential, chrome grille, fog lights, a 115-volt power outlet, a 10-way power driver’s seat, a leather-wrapped steering wheel with audio controls and an auto-dimming rearview mirror. Our Big Horn added the Luxury Group option package, which comes with heated front seats, a 7-inch multiview instrument cluster, auto-dimming power-folding heated side mirrors, and overhead console with garage door opener. We also appreciated the available Uconnect 8.4-inch touch-screen with satellite radio, navigation, voice-to-text messaging and emergency assistance. The screen information and displays are just about the best in the segment. We especially liked that the screens were easy to read during the day and at night.\n\nThe cloth seats were comfortable for long hauls and felt sturdy enough to handle long-term wear and tear. Of course, if you don’t opt for the side steps to help with entry and exit, you’re likely to get more wear (and possibly tear) on the seats as you slide in and slide out.\n\nWe found the control knobs, instrument panels and steering-wheel controls well placed and easy to access.\n\nAbout the only issue we had with the interior was using the heating/cooling controls. The simple up/down button is relatively slow to respond and forced us to use the screen to figure out temperature changes. It took some getting used to, but after a while it became second nature.\n\nHow It Drives\nOur 2014 Ram 2500 was equipped with the new 6.4-liter V-8 Hemi gas engine and six-speed automatic transmission with a 4.10:1 rear axle. This powertrain combination delivered quite a bit of power when unloaded, giving us a thrill ride several times. The gas engine is rated at 410 horsepower and 429 pounds-feet of torque. Our truck is also rated to tow 15,500 pounds and carry 3,170 pounds of payload.\n\nRam offers the 6.4-liter V-8 as a $1,495 upgrade from the 5.7-liter V-8 Hemi. For those who tow a lot, it is a significant savings when compared to the turbo-diesel 6.7-liter six-cylinder Cummins upgrade, which is $8,160 more than the 5.7-liter Hemi. With that price break, it is a good option for many customers and worth a look.\n\nDuring our test period, I drove the Ram 2500 almost 400 miles over highways, city streets and dirt roads, and through farming fields. On each of these roads, the truck rode well and was much improved from my last experience in a Ram heavy duty thanks to the new coil-spring rear suspension. With changing road and travel conditions, I never encountered a choppy ride or any ride comfort issues.\n\nWe did not have a chance to tow during our time with the truck; however, you can check the Davis Dam or Eisenhower Pass payload and towing results from the 2014 Ultimate Three-Quarter-Ton HD Challenge for more details.\n\nOverall, I was able to get 14.2 mpg from my nearly 400 miles of driving the truck.\n\nValue in Its Class\nIn the end, the Ram 2500 with the 6.4-liter Hemi is a great-looking pickup with lots of capability, and it has one of my favorite interiors on the market. It certainly provides buyers with an efficient, powerful gasoline alternative to the Cummins diesel at a huge cost break.\n\nCars.com photos by Tim Esterdahl",
