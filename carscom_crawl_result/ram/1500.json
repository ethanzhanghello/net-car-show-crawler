      "expert_review": "The verdict: Die-hard fans may lament the passing of the Hemi V-8, but the 2025 Ram 1500’s new Hurricane twin-turbo straight-six-cylinder engines make up in power and smoothness what they lack in audible growl.\n\nVersus the competition: The Ram 1500 is still the most comfortable pickup truck on the market with the nicest interior, but now it adds a significant boost in quietness and refinement versus its Ford and GM competitors.\n\nThe simple fact of the matter is that the V-8 engine is dying, with nearly every major automaker except GM starting to phase them out of production as tougher emissions laws and the increased global push for electrification makes them untenable. Pickup trucks are the latest body style to see them start to disappear: First, Ford switched almost everything over to twin-turbocharged V-6 engines (they still have one 5.0-liter V-8 as an option), then Toyota dumped their V-8 for a twin-turbo V-6, as well. Now, Ram has done the same. The really big story here is that the 2025 Ram 1500 is no longer offered with a Hemi V-8 engine; it’s six-cylinder engines across the board, from the base model to the new-for-’25, line-topping Tungsten trim.\n\nRelated: 2025 Ram 1500 Drops Cylinders, Goes Metal\n\nTruck and Hemi fans are going to cry foul, GM is going to say, “Well, we make V-8s work,” and environmentalists are still going to lament that Rams use gasoline. But everybody can calm down — the switch to turbo sixes in the new Ram 1500 works, and it works exceptionally well.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nNot Much (More) to Look At\n\nYou’re going to be hard-pressed to tell the ‘25 Ram 1500 apart from the ‘24, and I’m of two minds about that. On one hand, you could say the truck didn’t really need any styling fixing (unlike some crosstown rivals from a couple of years ago), so Ram didn’t do any. On the other, if you’re going to update your truck, do something noticeable. Ram took the first route, and I’m OK with it. The design is sleek, chunky and still retains some hints of the original ‘90s-era design that put the Ram truck back in the fight. But for ‘25, it gets some aero smoothing, available LED headlights and some updates to the grille and front bumper. If you opt for the new super-luxurious, range-topping Tungsten trim, your steel front bumper is replaced by a plastic lower covering that’s more about style than function. It’s the same story out back: There’s new taillights, but you’d never notice if you weren’t told. The overall look of the truck isn’t particularly new, but then, it really didn’t need to be.\n\nThe Important Bit: Power\n\nThree engines are available in the ‘25 Ram 1500. It starts with the base 3.6-liter Pentastar V-6 that feels like it’s been around forever and has found a home under the hood of everything from Jeep Wranglers to Dodge Journeys to Chrysler 300s. It’s been in the Ram 1500 awhile, too, and it comes with the eTorque mild-hybrid system and produces a carryover 305 horsepower and 271 pounds-feet of torque. That’s pretty mild for a base engine when compared with what rivals are doing: The Chevy Silverado 1500 has a turbocharged 2.7-liter four-cylinder making 310 hp and 430 pounds-feet, while the Ford F-150’s twin-turbo 2.7-liter V-6 makes 325 hp and 400 pounds-feet. While this makes the base Ram pretty solidly outgunned, not to worry: This engine is only likely to be found in super-cheap fleet trucks. It’s only available as the standard engine in the base Tradesman trim level and slightly nicer Big Horn (called Lone Star in the Texas market, not even joking) variants.\n\nThe optional engine in the Tradesman and Big Horn/Lone Star (and standard in the next-nicest Laramie and off-road Rebel) is the new twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter Hurricane inline-six-cylinder engine, or as Ram refers to it, the “SST” (for “straight-six turbo”). We first sampled this engine under the hood of the Jeep Wagoneer, but it’s now made its way over to the Ram brand, producing 420 hp and 469 pounds-feet of torque; it’s likely to be the engine you see in most Ram pickups, occupying the spot where the highest sales volumes occur. Finally, the top engine option in the ‘25 Ram is a more powerful, heavily modified version of that 3.0-liter Hurricane SST, referred to as the SST H/O (high output). It makes a whopping 540 hp and 521 pounds-feet of torque, and it’s only offered in the Limited Longhorn, Limited and Tungsten trims, where it’s standard. Ram recommends premium fuel for the regular SST engine and requires it for the H/O version. All engines are mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission — no 10-speed here yet, unlike what’s offered in GM and Ford trucks — and rear-wheel drive. Part-time or full-time four-wheel drive is available, depending on trim level and options.\n\nHaving driven both of the SST engines — the standard Hurricane in a well-equipped Laramie trim, then the SST H/O in a loaded Tungsten — I can say that the only thing fans are going to miss about the Hemi V-8 is the sound it made. These Hurricane engines are superior in just about every way, but their remarkable refinement is especially noticeable whether accelerating or cruising on the highway. Motoring along at 70 mph, all you hear is wind and road noise — the engine itself is just a muted hum under your feet. Power is plentiful and just a stab of the gas pedal away, although there is a bit of kickdown delay from the transmission unless you have it in Sport mode. One gets the idea that the powertrain is tuned a bit more for fuel economy (official EPA estimates weren’t yet available at publication) than snappy performance.\n\nAs for the differences between the SST and SST H/O, there really isn’t all that much in terms of how they behave. They both produce prodigious low-end torque due to the turbochargers, and it’s fairly immediate, too. Each of the two turbos feed three cylinders, so engineers were able to downsize the turbos for quicker spool-up and superior response. There’s no turbo lag here — not that most engines have had any in years thanks to modern technology and electronic controls. You do notice the extra power and torque in the SST H/O when you really get into it (it changes the Ram 1500 from merely “adequately quick” to “properly rapid”), and it makes me wonder exactly what Ram is planning for the Ram RHO sport truck trim it said to expect in the coming months. Consider: The new Ram 1500 pickup truck has a powertrain not at all dissimilar to the one in the latest BMW M3 — a twin-turbo 3.0-liter straight-six engine linked to an eight-speed automatic and RWD — except the Ram’s H/O engine is actually more powerful.\n\nRide, Handling, Towing, Off-Roading\n\nHow do the new engines affect the rest of the truck experience? Only in good ways, folks. The ride and handling of the new Ram 1500 isn’t really any different than the outgoing model; the coil-spring rear suspension helps the Ram ride better than any of its competitors, with the exception perhaps of the top Tungsten trim, which rides on 22-inch wheels and tires and transmits more bumps and pavement chop into the cabin than other models with taller-sidewall tires. Steering is nicely weighted but big-pickup-numb, and that’s generally all right. You’re not driving a sports car, and as long as it feels well controlled and comfortable, you’re doing it right in my book. One thing to note: The lane departure warning system is maddeningly sensitive and will always be going off regardless of any adjustments you make (it has sensitivity settings). The switch to deactivate it is to the top right of the dashboard touchscreen.\n\nThe Ram 1500 still tows like a champ, and the new engine’s prodigious low-end torque makes dragging a trailer a breeze (so do the Ram’s new trailer tow mirrors, I might add). I had the opportunity to tow a 7,300-pound, 26-foot Airstream trailer behind a Laramie trim level with the standard Hurricane engine, and it felt truly effortless and calm. The maximum towing capacity for the new Ram is 11,580 pounds, which is around a couple of thousand pounds less than the maximum ratings for the Chevrolet Silverado 1500 and Ford F-150, but Ram isn’t chasing max tow numbers — and that’s a good thing. Frankly, towing anything greater than 10,000 pounds isn’t something I’d want to do in anything but a heavy-duty pickup due to the increased stress and wear on a light-duty truck’s components. Can you tow a 13,000-pound trailer with a light-duty Ford or Chevy? Yes, but it’s a very specific model that can tow that much, and you’d be a lot more comfortable doing it in a Silverado HD or a Ford Super Duty. Making towing easier in the Ram is the location of the available integrated trailer brake controller at the bottom left corner of the big vertical touchscreen. Oddly, the gain adjustment is part of the touchscreen, but the manual activation slide is still a physical control.\n\nOff-road, the Hurricane engine is just as much of a winner as the old Hemi was. The 420-hp version is the engine you get in the latest Rebel trim, which has to be one of the best off-road pickups on the market. It’s easily as comfortable off-road as the most recent Chevrolet Silverado 1500 ZR2 I tested, and on my brief off-road drive in the hills around Austin, Texas, it proved that it’s as easily adept at scaling rocks as it is flying over open fields at 45-50 mph, something you wouldn’t really do in a Ford F-150 Tremor (but definitely could in the much more expensive F-150 Raptor). The available low-end torque of the turbo engine works in the Rebel’s favor, and all of the same goodies that were in the truck before (available four-corner air suspension, various drive modes, 33-inch mud-terrain tires, easy-to-use low-range and locking rear differential) are still present in the latest Rebel. The available off-road cameras are also extremely helpful when the path suddenly drops away from you and you need to see where the Ram is pointing.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2025 Ram 1500 Ramcharger: Ready to Go the Distance\n2025 Ram 1500 REV Up Close: Fighting Lightning With Thunder\nResearch the 2025 Ram 1500\nShop for a 2025 Ram 1500\n2024 Ram 1500: No Big Changes Ahead of Expected Redesign\nInterior Upgrades and the Tungsten Trim\n\nThe interior of the ‘25 Ram 1500 got some upgrades, too, and it remains the nicest cab in the full-size pickup class. It’s the combination of premium materials (even in the lowest Tradesman trim), copious space, excellent visibility and solid construction that makes it feel like it actually should cost as much as Ram is charging for it. Chevy has upped its game in this respect, as has Ford, but Ram keeps upgrading its interiors and raising the bar.\n\nThere’s just one area I wish Ram would rethink: The new vertical touchscreen measures 14.5 inches in diagonal length, but I wish they’d go back to a horizontal screen like both Ford and Chevy use. Ram has crammed a lot into this touchscreen, and while the new electrical architecture of the 2025 model means that it works much faster than prior versions, it’s getting rather busy and difficult to find features that you might want to use. But the main reason for wanting a return to a horizontal screen is for the camera views: When you shift into Reverse, you get a rear view — but only on the top half of the screen, and it’s smaller than you’d get in the large displays of a Ford or Chevy. It makes reversing to back up a trailer more of a squinty-eyed operation.\n\nAnd we can’t let a review of the 2025 Ram 1500 go without talking about the new benchmark for luxury pickups: the Tungsten trim. It sits atop the pantheon of Ram 1500 trims, which, if we’re keeping count, now consists of Tradesman, Big Horn/Lone Star, Laramie, Rebel, Limited Longhorn, Limited and Tungsten. It’s a rare element, tungsten, that a lot of people associate with “tungsten-carbide saw blades,” according to Ram marketing execs, which explains the knurled, knife-edged style on a number of the interior trim bits.\n\nTo create an interior nicer than the already luxurious Limited, however, Ram pulled out all of the stops. Genuine stitched leather covers the dash, doors, console and seats while faux-suede material covers the roof pillars and headliner. The wood trim is real and the metal is real (the suede is not). The front seats are unique to the Tungsten trim and are 24-way power-adjustable with heating, ventilation and massage functions. The digital gauge cluster and available head-up display have graphics unique to the model. There’s a (largely useless) 10.25-inch passenger screen in the dash as you’d find in a high-end Jeep Grand Cherokee or Grand Wagoneer. And prepare to be absolutely blown away by a 23-speaker, 1,228-watt Klipsch premium audio system that’s now the most amazing audio system I’ve ever experienced in a pickup truck. It sounds better than the McIntosh system Jeep offers in the Grand Wagoneer and rivals the Revel systems I’ve thoroughly enjoyed in the latest Lincolns. As one observer noted as I was “testing” the system with some favorite tunes, cranking the thing will make the truck’s exterior body panels visibly vibrate.\n\nKeeping It Competitive\n\nThe full-size pickup segment is the most competitive in the industry, with all of the players continuing to try and outdo one another with each new model. The ‘25 Ram 1500 took some interesting steps, deciding to forgo the numbers race around capability (no 10-speed automatics, no max towing champ or top payload rating) and instead focus on lifestyle users. It’s more luxurious, more powerful and more useful than before. The new engines are fantastic, and if they prove to be as reliable as they are strong, then the Hurricane name could very well take its place next to the Hemi name as something your next truck has just gotta have.\n\nPricing has gone up on average about $2,500, depending on trim, according to Ram. It’ll start at about $40,000, not counting destination, for a basic Tradesman and stretch to more than $87,000 for a loaded Tungsten (exact pricing is still to come). Prices are going up for everything, and Ram pickups are no different; the question will be whether incentives are a returning theme for the 2025 Ram 1500 as the competition heats up and affordability continues to be an ongoing issue for new vehicles. By introducing a new top Tungsten luxury trim level, however, it doesn’t seem like the folks at Ram are too worried about that.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Just outside of San Antonio, we got out first chance to get behind the wheel of the 2019 Ram 1500. The pickup truck debuted at the Detroit auto show in January, but we haven’t had a chance to drive it until now. We did some driving on-road and off-road — and even got a chance to do a little towing.\n\nRelated: First Drive: Does the All-New 2019 Ram 1500 Deliver?\n\nOur first impressions of how it drives? We are very impressed with the frequency-damping shock absorbers that use new technology on the coil suspension. Upgrades were also made to the available four-corner air suspension, and now it’s smarter than it was before; it offers a slightly softer ride when needed and stiffens appropriately during more aggressive driving.\n\nSome things weren’t as impressive, however. The 5.7-liter Hemi V-8 hasn’t received any upgrades, which means that, while it feels a bit more responsive thanks to the lighter weight of the new Ram 1500, it doesn’t wow with its performance. Our unscientific fuel-economy calculations during the drive event resulted in a combined rating of around 20 mpg, in line with the previous generation’s performance.\n\nInside, the 12-inch multimedia screen impressed, with a host of information readily available. One complaint about the new interior is the lack of a power-adjustable steering wheel and column. It still tilts and telescopes manually, but powered controls would be preferred.\n\nWatch the video to learn more about the 2019 Ram 1500, including off-road and towing impressions, and check out the full text of PickupTruck.com Editor Mark Williams’ First Drive here or via the related link above.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Ram 1500? \n\nThe Ram 1500 is a full-size pickup truck with seating for up to six people and a wide lineup of trim levels. Direct rivals include the Chevrolet Silverado 1500, Ford F-150, GMC Sierra 1500 and Toyota Tundra. The Ram 1500’s base powertrain is a 305-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6, and a 395-hp, 5.7-liter Hemi V-8 is available. The performance, off-road-focused TRX gets a 702-hp, supercharged 6.2-liter V-8. All engines come with an eight-speed automatic transmission; rear- and four-wheel drive are available, though the TRX comes standard with 4WD. Notable highlights include the Ram 1500’s smooth ride, which comes courtesy of its coil-spring or air-spring rear suspension. Luxury variants, including the Limited, are decked out in copious amounts of upscale leather, wood and metal trim.   \n\n(Note: Ram still sells the budget-minded Ram 1500 Classic, which is a continuation of the truck’s previous generation, whose design dates back to 2009. It’s covered separately in the Cars.com Research section.) \n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Ram 1500? \n\nA revamped Ram 1500 (with a new twin-turbocharged inline-six engine replacing the Hemi V-8) is on its way for the 2025 model year, so changes for 2024 are minimal. The TRX in its current form will be discontinued after 2024, and Ram will produce 4,000 TRX 6.2L Supercharged V8 – Final Edition variants. While they don’t have an increase in horsepower compared with the regular 702-hp TRX, notable extras include carbon-fiber interior trim, unique interior stitching, a badge on the center console, and satin-finish beadlock wheels and tires. The Ram 1500 Tradesman Warlock trim returns with a 1-inch raised ride height, underbody skid plates, 33-inch all-terrain tires and an electronic rear differential. Last but not least, every 2024 Ram 1500 comes standard with a tailgate-ajar warning lamp. \n\nWhat Is the Towing Capacity of the 2024 Ram 1500? \n\nThe Ram 1500’s maximum towing capacity ranges from 6,120 to 12,750 pounds depending on powertrain, trim level and equipment. \n\nHow Much Does the 2024 Ram 1500 Weigh? \n\nThe Ram 1500’s curb weight ranges from 4,769 to 6,430 pounds depending on body style, trim level and equipment. \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Ram 1500 Are Most Important? \n\nStandard features include:  \n\n5-inch touchscreen multimedia system \nRemote keyless entry \nAir conditioning \nCruise control \nUSB ports \nPower door locks and windows \nBluetooth connectivity \n\nAvailable features include:  \n\nFour-corner air suspension \nDual-panel moonroof \n8.4- or 12-inch touchscreen multimedia system \nWireless device charging \n360-degree camera system \nForward collision warning with automatic emergency braking \nBlind spot warning  \nRear cross-traffic alert \nLane departure warning \nAdaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability \nAutomatic high-beam headlights \nShould I Buy the 2024 Ram 1500? \n\nThe Ram 1500 is both comfortable and highly customizable. It can serve as anything from a no-frills truck, meant solely for getting work done, to a luxurious go-anywhere conveyance that doesn’t wilt when the pavement ends.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Ram 1500?\n\nThe Ram 1500 is a full-size pickup truck with seating for up to six and a wide lineup of trim levels. It’s targeted at rivals like the Chevrolet Silverado 1500, Ford F-150 and Toyota Tundra. The Ram separates itself from the competition with an interior in higher trims that wouldn’t look out of place in a luxury vehicle. \n\nA mild-hybrid V-6 drivetrain is standard, but a turbo-diesel V-6 and a pair of V-8 engines — including a 702-hp, supercharged 6.2-liter V-8 in the TRX trim — are also offered. All engines come with an eight-speed automatic transmission, and rear- and four-wheel-drive models are available.\n\n(Note: Ram also continues to sell the value-oriented Ram 1500 Classic, a continuation of the brand’s previous-generation light-duty pickup whose basic design dates back to 2009. It’s covered separately in the Cars.com Research section.)\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Ram 1500?\n\nA 12-inch digital gauge cluster is newly available, and an LED hitch lamp is newly standard. An extra-luxurious Limited Elite Edition gets upscale features including premium leather upholstery, a jeweled rotary shifter and a suede headliner. There are also a couple of new uniquely trimmed special-edition trucks, including the TRX Havoc Edition. The 2023 model year will be the last for the Ram’s available turbo-diesel V-6 engine.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Ram 1500 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\nRemote keyless entry\nAir conditioning\nCruise control\n5-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nBluetooth connectivity\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nFour-corner air suspension\nDual-panel moonroof\n8.4- or 12-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nWireless device charging\n360-degree camera system\nForward collision warning with automatic emergency braking\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nLane departure warning\nAdaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nShould I Buy the 2023 Ram 1500?\n\nThe Ram 1500 proves that a modern full-size pickup can be anything from a no-frills workhorse to a luxury-laden palace — or even a performance beast, as is the 702-hp TRX. The truck’s high-end trim levels are pricey, though the same is true of this truck’s key rivals. Less expensive trims still deliver a great blend of utility, power, convenience and user-friendly controls.",

      "expert_review": "Key Points in This Review:\n\nThe 2026 Ram 1500’s newly available Hemi V-8 makes less power and costs more than the truck’s turbocharged inline-six engine, but it makes better sounds.\nOther aspects of the Ram 1500 Hemi V-8 driving experience, like braking, steering, and ride and handling, are similar to other Ram 1500s.\nMore affordable trim levels, like the Warlock and Lone Star, offer nicely finished interiors, while the high-end Longhorn brings a western-style motif.\n\nThe full-size pickup truck class is a game of numbers. An automaker will release a horsepower, torque or towing number that’s trumpeted as “best in class” — only to be eclipsed by a competitor when its new pickup rolls out. This perpetual one-upmanship is part of what makes the return of the 5.7-liter Hemi V-8 engine to Ram’s 1500 light-duty pickup so interesting; it’s less powerful but more expensive than its twin-turbo six-cylinder counterparts.\n\nRelated: He(mi) Is Risen! Ram Resurrects Famed V-8 Option for 2026 1500 Pickups\n\nRated at 395 hp and 410 pounds-feet of torque, the Hemi V-8 isn’t the most powerful engine in the 1500 lineup by a long shot; it’s less powerful than both the regular-output twin-turbo inline-six engine, which makes 420 hp and 469 pounds-feet of torque, and the high-output version of this engine, which makes an impressive 540 hp and 521 pounds-feet. And despite its lower output, the Hemi costs $1,200 more than the regular-output six-cylinder and is a no-charge option versus the high-output six.\n\nMakes the Right Sounds\nTakeaway: With its burble at idle and roar when accelerating, the Hemi V-8 sounds glorious, and the powertrain overall is well tuned and responsive.\n\nSo, why would you pay more for less power and torque? The reason becomes clear the moment you press the start button and the Hemi V-8 fires to life with a satisfying V-8 burble that turns into a roar when accelerating. Ram was smart to make the GT exhaust system that had previously been available for the Hemi V-8 standard, as it lets you better hear what you’re paying for: those satisfying V-8 noises. The exhaust system has a nice tune overall, letting you hear enough of the engine when cruising to know what’s under the hood while not being so loud to be annoying on a longer trip. And when you get into the gas pedal and the eight-speed automatic transmission kicks down, that exhaust note is ratcheted up immediately.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nOne of the most impressive aspects of the Hemi V-8 powertrain is its responsiveness. Part-throttle kickdowns happen swiftly, and the automatic transmission works well in general with the V-8. And despite all the noises the V-8 makes, it’s a smooth, refined engine. Perhaps not as silky as the twin-turbo six-cylinder, but not far behind.\n\nThe rest of the Ram 1500 driving experience is much the same as it was in the refreshed 2025-model-year truck. Braking response is good for a full-size pickup, with more pedal feel and linearity than you get in other trucks. The Ram steers with a light touch, but it’s easy to put the truck where you want whether you’re on-road or off.\n\nRam also had a trailer loaded with a classic pickup that was hitched to a Longhorn trim level, and the Hemi V-8 pulled this setup with ease, readily accelerating the truck up to highway-merging speeds. I could feel the trailer tugging the truck a bit, but it wasn’t excessive. This trailer’s combined weight of 6,100 pounds was well below the Hemi-powered Longhorn’s maximum towing capacity of 9,960 pounds, but it’s not out of the realm of what an owner might hitch to their truck. The Ram’s available towing mirrors have power adjustments for both the upper and lower mirror sections, which is nice, but the mirror housing is big and, combined with the nearby front roof pillars, can block your view when checking for cross traffic at an intersection.\n\nInterior and Technology\nTakeaway: Even lower trims of the Ram 1500 have good interior quality, but the available 12-inch infotainment touchscreen was noticeably laggy.\n\nBesides the high-end Longhorn model, Ram also had less expensive trims available to drive, including the Texas-themed Lone Star. Rather than the Longhorn’s intricate western-style stitching and open-pore wood trim, the Lone Star interior has simpler materials, but its touch points are still nice, with rubberized door-panel surfaces and a high-grade feel to the cab’s switches and buttons. The fabric-trimmed driver’s seat has firm cushioning, but it was comfortable for me, and I like the versatility offered by the available front bench seat that lets you have three-across seating or room for two with a large armrest in between.\n\nThe Ram 1500 has a standard 8.4-inch infotainment touchscreen, and portrait-style screens that measure 12 or 14.5 inches are available. The 12-inch screen had a noticeable amount of lag when going between menus like navigation and audio, which was concerning to see in a brand-new vehicle. In our experience, touchscreen lag only gets worse the older the vehicle gets.\n\nMake Mine a Hemi\nTakeaway: The Ram’s high-output six-cylinder is an impressive engine, but it lacks the wonderful noises that make the Hemi V-8 a more compelling powertrain.\n\nThe power and refinement of the Ram 1500’s high-output six-cylinder engine is impressive, and it was one of the reasons a Ram 1500 Tungsten won our 2024 Full-Size Pickup Truck Challenge, beating luxury trucks from Ford and GMC. However, when compared to the Hemi V-8 with its glorious roar, it feels like you’re only getting half the experience with the six-cylinder engine because those desirable noises just aren’t there.\n\nRam says that 40% of customers would switch brands if a V-8 wasn’t available, which is a huge number when you consider how much brand loyalty there is in the full-size pickup class. This statistic alone makes you wonder why Ram would have ever even considered dropping the Hemi V-8 from the 1500 lineup. That’s now water under the bridge, I guess, and if you can’t wrap your head around the pricing of the V-8, a short drive is all you need for your heart to convince you.\n\nMore Ram 1500 News From Cars.com:\n\nExpress Returns: 2026 Ram 1500 Express Is a New High-Style, Low-Price Entry Point\n2026 Ram 1500 Ramcharger Will Have 145 Miles of Electric Range, 690 Miles of Hybrid Range and Get 20 MPG\nYear of the Rhino: 2025 Ram 1500 RHO Gets Mopar ’25 Treatment\nLong-Range 500-Mile Ram 1500 REV No Longer Coming in 2026\nBest Pickup Truck of 2025\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "It’s rare that we get one fully redone new pickup truck in a given model year, but this year we got two automakers introducing all-new pickups. GM delivered the new 2019 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra half-ton trucks, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles has given us this, the new 2019 Ram 1500. Complicating matters somewhat is the continuation of the previous-generation 1500 in limited trim levels as the 2019 Ram 1500 Classic. This review focuses on the redesigned 1500.\n\nSmooth and Strong\n\nInitially, there’s a choice of three powertrains for the new Ram 1500. The base engine is a 3.6-liter Pentastar V-6 that features a standard mild-hybrid system called eTorque. It’s a 48-volt integrated starter/generator/motor that is fed from a battery pack located in the rear of the cabin wall. It operates seamlessly in the V-6, providing a little extra grunt when called for and greater efficiency when cruising. The gas-electric pairing makes 305 horsepower and 269 pounds-feet of torque; that’s competitive for a base powertrain, providing decent acceleration in an empty pickup (which is how I tested it, in a low-spec Tradesman crew-cab model). The Pentastar always has been a solid engine, and when augmented by a bit of electric boost, it’s only gotten better. My only wish is that the hybrid system’s operation was reflected in the gauges or multimedia system to let you know that it’s doing anything, as it’s almost invisible in its operation.\n\nYour other options for powertrains are two versions of the 5.7-liter Hemi V-8, with or without the optional eTorque system. This engine comes with much more grunt — 395 hp and 410 pounds-feet of torque, accompanied by a delicious burble from the dual exhaust pipes. Ram doesn’t provide system power specifications for the eTorque treatment but says the electric motor contributes up to 130 pounds-feet of torque to the V-8 and 90 pounds-feet to the V-6.\n\nThe model I’ve spent the most time behind the wheel of is the four-wheel-drive Limited crew-cab model featuring the eTorque Hemi V-8, optional 3.92 final drive ratio and electronic locking rear axle, so performance comments from here forward will deal with that model. This powertrain moves the big Ram much more smartly than the V-6 thanks to that boost in torque, but the advantage starts to slip as you move up in the trim levels and add weight and equipment. The operative word for the Ram V-8 is smooth — it’s an amazingly smooth, refined, luxurious driving experience. The Ram’s Hemi doesn’t have the endless deep well of torque that the GM twins’ big 6.2-liter V-8 brings to the party, sporting 420 hp and 460 pounds-feet of torque, but it’s plenty to get the truck moving quickly and feels largely unaffected by either loading the truck to maximum payload or pulling an average-size trailer.\n\nAs with the V-6, the eTorque system is invisible in daily operation, which is a good thing compared with the clunky operation of most “full” gasoline-electric hybrids — but in the case of the V-8, where you have to pay more to get eTorque, it might leave you wondering what you paid for. Ram insists otherwise, but our experience with truck buyers is such that more information is always better, especially on how the powertrain is performing. If I paid more than $2,600 for this optional system meant to save me money on fuel, I’d like to know when it’s working and what it’s doing beyond just having to do some calculations whenever I fill up the tank at the gas pump.\n\nAll of the engines are mated to Ram’s standard eight-speed TorqueFlite automatic transmission, a robust unit that gets a few internal upgrades when you move from the V-6 to the V-8 option. There are three final drive ratios available, with an optional limited-slip differential or electronic locking differential on certain 4×4 models. In a recent PickupTrucks.com comparison test at the drag strip, our Ram wasn’t the fastest from zero-to-60 mph, a fact we chalk up to the loaded truck’s prodigious weight — 5,920 pounds, or nearly 500 pounds more than a loaded Chevrolet Silverado 1500 High Country with a bigger, more powerful engine that beat the Ram to 60 mph by nearly a full second. Around town, however, this becomes less of an issue, as in normal driving there is plenty of power from the Hemi, delivered with a smooth flow unmarred by any sort of rough gearshifts. It’s an excellent powertrain, just not king of the hill when it comes to truck duty — a fact that might be important for certain buyers.\n\nThe truck’s weight also works against it for payload capacity. If you option up a Ram 1500 for maximum abilities, you can achieve a max tow rating of 12,750 pounds and a max payload of 2,300 pounds. But load up your truck with luxury trimmings, and you’ll get what our test truck had — a payload rating of just 1,180 pounds. Put five 200-pound guys in the cabin, and anything more than two big bags of dog food in the bed would exceed the safety ratings. That ain’t much, and it reinforces the idea that as a luxury vehicle, the Ram works beautifully — but the trade-off for that cushiness is truck utility.\n\nWhere the eTorque V-8 powertrain shines is in fuel economy. The EPA rates the Ram 1500 4×4 with the eTorque V-8 at 17/22/19 mpg city/highway/combined, which improves upon the regular V-8’s 15/21/17 mpg by 2 mpg combined, a boost of almost 12 percent. With the eTorque option, the Hemi V-8 bests the 6.2-liter V-8 and 10-speed automatic transmission combination in the GM trucks (16/20/17 mpg) and even GM’s standard 5.3-liter V-8 (15/20/17 mpg with a standard six-speed transmission), as well. The Hemi mild hybrid is also rated better than the 5.0-liter V-8 in the Ford F-150 (15/20/17 mpg) and surprisingly beats even the twin-turbo 3.5-liter EcoBoost V-6 (16/21/18 mpg). We did not perform any unloaded fuel economy testing in our latest comparison, but we did look at how it performed while pulling a 6,100-pound trailer, where the Hemi placed mid-pack in the results among other half-ton pickups.\n\nThe Silent Type\n\nThe experience of driving the new Ram is amplified by the plush surroundings. Active noise cancellation and a redesigned frame with special frame mounts create an amazingly hushed cabin environment on V-8-equipped models. A well-damped ride adds to the insulated passenger experience, be it with the standard coil-spring rear suspension (in lieu of leaf springs) or the optional air suspension. The Ram handles well enough, but it isn’t what one would call athletic or rewarding to drive aggressively. This is partly due to its highly boosted steering not providing much in the way of feedback, and partly due to its weight. While the steering is light, I did find it to be accurate and quick, with few turns lock-to-lock. Stopping the big truck isn’t the most confidence-inspiring activity, either — the brakes have a mushy feel to them, without much initial bite. But if isolation from external elements is really your goal, you’ll find no better truck out there than the Ram 1500 for delivering such results.\n\nThe Nicest Pickup Ever Made\n\nIf using a truck as a truck is not the primary role in your household, then this next part may be more important to you. Simply put, Ram has created the nicest pickup truck ever made. The interior of the new Ram 1500 is stunning in its top Limited trim, but it’s also impressive in every trim level all the way down to the lowly Tradesman. The Limited is the one to behold, however, where all the high-quality materials abound. Rich leather covers nearly every surface, including the dashboard. Gorgeous open-pore wood is placed high and within reach, allowing you to touch and appreciate its uniqueness (good luck even finding the wood panels in a Chevrolet Silverado 1500 High Country — they’re located below your knees). Color choices are exceptional, with some unique two-tone options that are tasteful and classy (or opulently Wild West-themed for people into that). The steering wheel is thick, comfortable and stylish, as well. I’d go out on a limb to say that this is perhaps the nicest American luxury vehicle interior built today, challenging the Lincoln Navigator for that title and better than anything coming out of Cadillac.\n\nFront-seat room is expansive with wide, comfortable seats and plenty of legroom and headroom. Unlike in the GM trucks’ bunkerlike environment, the seating position is high and the dash is fairly low, allowing a good view out over the hood. The Ford F-150 still has the Ram beat for visibility, however, with super-tall side glass and an even lower dashboard. Backseat legroom is cavernous — GM may have the interior room title at the moment with its claim of best-in-class cabin space, but you won’t feel cramped in any of the current full-size crew-cab pickups except the Nissan Titan, which doesn’t feel quite as massive as its competitors.\n\nTop-Notch Tech\n\nThe new Ram 1500 features the latest and greatest version of Uconnect, long viewed as one of the quickest, simplest, easiest-to-use multimedia systems on the market. The latest Ram takes it to the next level with a positively massive optional 12-inch, vertically oriented touchscreen that takes up most of the center control panel. It’s big, bright and easy to use, but its highly reflective screen can make direct sunlight a challenge, and it collects fingerprints prolifically. It’s reconfigurable to several different custom settings, allowing users to set preferences for appearance and usability. You can pair it with a bone-shaking 900-watt, 19-speaker Harman Kardon audio system in the premium trim levels if you want bass that shakes the truck’s windows and scrambles your soul.\n\nRoom for Everything\n\nStorage inside the cabin is plentiful, with all sorts of cubbies and clever holders for things like cellphones. There are USB ports and 12-volt power points, too. The brilliantly simple cellphone holders in the lower center console allow you to keep a phone plugged into a cord and still arrange it so that it sits securely in the holder. Rear seats that fold up allow large items to be loaded into the passenger compartment where they’re more secure than in an open bed. The RamBox bedside storage compartments are also improved for 2019, as they now have interior lights, 115-volt grounded outlets and pressure-touch latches. They do eat into the available cargo area in the bed itself, but given that this truck doesn’t have a huge payload capacity, hauling big, heavy objects in the bed probably isn’t as important as being able to securely transport smaller, valuable items in the RamBoxes.\n\nSafety Upgrades\n\nThe new 2019 Ram 1500 has not yet been crash-tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, but the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gives it top ratings nearly across the board thanks to excellent crash-test results and the presence of advanced safety systems like forward collision warning with autonomous braking. Only its headlights and child-seat Latch anchors received a marginal rating. The new truck features a full load of optional safety and convenience technology, including a 360-degree camera system, active parallel and perpendicular parking assist, blind spot monitor, adaptive front LED lighting, lane departure warning and more.\n\nPickups Ain’t Cheap Anymore\n\nNot that this is a news flash, but pickup prices have been steadily climbing and are in many cases higher than they’ve ever been. Even middle trim levels are going for north of $50,000, and my 1500 Limited crew-cab 4×4 model had an all-in sticker price of $68,390 including destination fee. That’s a lot of cheddar for a pickup, but when you compare the interior trimmings of this Limited to luxury vehicles from any brand costing easily as much, it compares favorably.\n\nAnd it’s not like any of the competitor pickups are less expensive. Ford made news last year for introducing a Super Duty that hits the $100,000 mark, and competitors to the Ram 1500 Limited all come within a few thousand dollars of the Ram’s total. So be prepared to spend a little more coin at your preferred pickup truck vendor on your next visit. If you’re at the Ram store, you’re in for a treat with the nicest pickup ever made by an American automaker. Just make sure you don’t make it too nice if you still want to do some trucky things regularly.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2022 Ram 1500?\n\nThe Ram 1500 is a full-size pickup truck with room for up to six and a wide lineup of trim levels. It’s targeted at rivals like the Ford F-150, Chevrolet Silverado 1500 and Toyota Tundra. The Ram separates itself from the competition with an interior in higher trims that wouldn’t look out of place in a luxury vehicle. \n\nA mild-hybrid V-6 drivetrain is standard, but a turbo-diesel V-6 and a selection of V-8 engines, including a 702-hp, supercharged 6.2-liter V-8 in the TRX trim, are also offered. All engines come with an eight-speed automatic transmission, and rear- and four-wheel-drive models are available. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2022 Ram 1500?\n\nNew Ram 1500 variants include a Limited 10th Anniversary Edition as well as Longhorn SouthFork, Laramie G/T, Rebel G/T and BackCountry models. A new cabin air filtration system is standard, and Big Horn and higher trims get the Uconnect 5 multimedia system. \n\nWhat Features in the 2022 Ram 1500 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nRemote keyless entry\nAir conditioning\nCruise control\n5-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nBluetooth connectivity\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nFour-corner air suspension\nDual-panel moonroof\n8.4- or 12-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nWireless device charging\n360-degree camera system\nForward collision warning with automatic emergency braking\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nLane departure warning\nAdaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nShould I Buy the 2022 Ram 1500?\n\nThe Ram 1500 proves that a modern full-size pickup can be anything from a no-frills workhorse to a luxury-laden palace — and even a performance beast in the form of the 702-hp TRX. The truck’s high-end trim levels are pricey, though the same is true of this truck’s key rivals. Less expensive trims still deliver a great blend of utility, power, convenience features and user-friendly controls.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2021 Ram 1500 TRX is built to go fast off-road, but on the street, it’s more livable than you might expect. \n\nVersus the competition: More extreme than the already extreme Ford F-150 Raptor, the TRX one-ups its primary competitor with a more luxurious interior and surprisingly friendly on-road driving manners. \n\nThe Ford F-150 Raptor has been largely unchallenged in the full-size off-road truck arena, but Ram has gone right for Ford’s throat with the 2021 Ram 1500 TRX. Available exclusively as a crew cab with a 5-foot-7-inch cargo box and full-time four-wheel drive, the TRX sees substantial modifications to its frame, suspension and exterior compared with a regular Ram 1500. And that’s not counting what’s under the hood: a supercharged 6.2-liter V-8 engine rated at 702 horsepower and 650 pounds-feet of torque. \n\nRelated: 2021 Ram 1500 TRX Video: Pickup Truck Has New TRX Up Its Sleeve\n\nThe TRX starts at $71,690, including a $1,695 destination charge, which makes it the most expensive version of the 2021 Ram 1500. It’s also considerably more expensive than a 2020 Ford F-150 Raptor, which starts at $55,150 in extended-cab form. (A new Raptor based on the updated 2021 Ford F-150 is expected in the near future.) \n\nThe as-tested price of our TRX test truck was a whopping $91,950 due to a long list of technology, convenience, safety and luxury options. It also had a number of Mopar accessories including off-road running boards, a bed-mounted spare-tire carrier and a RamBar with off-road LED lights. \n\nWe unfortunately weren’t able to test the TRX off-road due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, but we did put it through our typical testing process and were pleasantly surprised with the everyday drivability of this purpose-built off-roader. Once we get some off-road time in the TRX, we’ll update this review or link to separate coverage. \n\nMuscle-Truck Moves\n\nThe star of the TRX show is, undoubtedly, the truck’s supercharged V-8 — and wow, does it perform. Stab the gas pedal when cruising at highway speeds and the TRX lunges forward with a ferocity that’s hard to believe is possible for such a heavy truck (the TRX’s curb weight is 6,350 pounds). But that’s the point of 702 horses, isn’t it? The V-8 teams with a well-behaved eight-speed automatic transmission that makes smooth, unobtrusive shifts when leisurely cruising and firm, quick gear changes in the truck’s Sport mode.\n\nThe penalty for all this fun is dreadful EPA-estimated gas mileage of 10/14/12 mpg city/highway/combined. The 2020 Raptor, which is powered by a twin-turbocharged V-6, is rated 15/18/16 mpg. Within the Ram 1500 lineup, the diesel-powered model is rated as high as 26 mpg combined, and even the four-wheel-drive, 5.7-liter V-8 version gets up to 19 mpg.\n\nWith a rumbling exhaust note and an ever-present supercharger whine, the TRX makes noises gearheads will love. The 35-inch Goodyear Wrangler Territory all-terrain tires create some noise at highway speeds, but it’s not excessive. \n\nThe TRX is incredibly wide — it’s 8-inches wider than a regular Ram 1500 — but despite the truck’s substantial width, it was easy to position on the suburban streets and highways we traveled. Credit the steering, which is direct and precise.\n\nRide quality is firm and there’s some chassis shudder when driving on rough pavement, but body motions are well controlled. The TRX is fitted with Bilstein Black Hawk e2 adaptive shock absorbers, and the truck’s Sport mode firms up the shocks even more. Sport also tightens the steering, directs more engine torque to the rear wheels and keeps the automatic transmission in lower gears for better performance.\n\nPerformance Luxury Interior\n\nThe TRX is made to get dusty in the desert, but if you select the right options, its interior can have the same level of quality and luxury as its high-end sibling trims that won our 2020 Luxury Car of the Year award. The $7,920 TRX Level 2 Equipment Group and $1,295 TRX Carbon Fiber Package give the cabin a performance-oriented look that includes carbon-fiber accents and an all-black color scheme with red stitching. Standard performance cues include a flat-bottom steering wheel, aluminum shift paddles and a console gear selector instead of the rotary shifter that’s in other 1500s.\n\nIt’s a bit of a climb up to the driver’s seat, but it was made easier by the optional low-profile running boards tucked below the doors. Few consumer-oriented vehicles, however, offer comparable forward views; you sit so high that very little blocks your line of sight. Over-the-right-shoulder visibility is good, too, thanks to the crew cab’s large side windows, but the driver’s-side B-pillar restricts over-the-left-shoulder visibility. \n\nThe crew-cab’s backseat is massive, with plenty of space to stretch your legs. An available 60/40-split bench seat flips up, converting the rear of the cab to cargo-carrying duty, and the backrest also reclines. \n\nAll TRXs have a vertically oriented 12-inch touchscreen with navigation that takes up most of the middle of the dash. The system is configurable, letting you customize the home screen and apps that appear in the toolbar at the base of the display. The large screen doesn’t enhance the smartphone connectivity experience, though; both Apple CarPlay and Android Auto use a portion of the screen that’s similar in size to the 8.4-inch touchscreen available on other Ram 1500s. The multimedia system’s native navigation map does use the entire screen, however. \n\nCargo\n\nUnlike other crew-cab Ram 1500s that offer a choice of a 5-foot-7-inch or 6-foot-4-inch cargo box, the TRX is available only with the shorter box. The truck’s aggressive, lifted off-road suspension contributes to a box floor that was nearly waist high for me (I’m 6-foot-1), which will likely make loading and unloading certain kinds of cargo more difficult. It makes climbing in and out of the bed harder, too, though an optional retractable bed step makes the process easier.\n\nThe bed isn’t big to begin with, and the optional tire carrier and full-size spare tire significantly reduce available space by taking up the center, forward half of the cargo box. The location is convenient if you end up needing the spare, no question, but the truck’s cargo-carrying abilities take a big hit. \n\nSafety and Driver Assistance Features\n\nMost of the TRX’s active-safety features are bundled in the $995 Advanced Safety Group option. It includes automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability, lane keep assist, automatic high-beam headlights and a 360-degree camera system. The $1,095 Advanced Technology Group option adds a head-up display and a rearview camera mirror. Blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert and front and rear parking sensors are also optional.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nFor a purpose-built performance off-road truck with more than a foot of suspension travel and 32 inches of water-fording capability, the TRX makes comparatively few compromises in on-road driving refinement and occupant comfort. Its biggest shortcomings — unremarkable cargo bed utility and extremely poor gas mileage — aren’t the deal-breakers they otherwise might be for an ordinary full-size truck. The TRX is the opposite of ordinary — and thoroughly entertaining.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe Ram 1500 light-duty pickup truck emphasizes aerodynamic styling with a unique grille-forward design; ride comfort with a segment-exclusive coil-spring rear suspension; and storage innovation with the RamBox. Ram also addresses the basics with power in the 5.7-liter Hemi V-8 and an excellent interior. Certain versions seat up to six people, and the Ram 1500 competes against the Chevrolet Silverado, Ford F-150 and Toyota Tundra.\n\nNew for 2012\nThe Ram 1500 Tradesman HD is a new heavy-duty version of the regular Ram 1500 Tradesman. This truck is aimed at small-business owners, construction contractors and fleet operators. Offered only in two-wheel-drive regular cab form with a long bed, the 1500 Tradesman HD comes with a 5.7-liter Hemi V-8 and a six-speed automatic transmission. Payload capacity is 3,100 pounds, and the 1500 Tradesman HD can tow up to 11,500 pounds when properly equipped.\n\nIn addition, the Ram 1500 Express trim is now available as a Quad Cab or crew-cab truck.\n\nThe Ram 1500 lineup gains a high-end Laramie Limited trim for 2012, too. The truck features full-leather seating, piano-black interior trim, 20-inch aluminum wheels and berber-carpeted floormats.\n\nExterior\nThe Ram 1500 is offered as a regular cab, Quad Cab or crew cab. Two unique features are the optional lockable RamBox storage boxes and the truck’s standard coil-spring rear suspension. Exterior features include:\n\nAluminum power-bulge hood\nStandard 17-inch wheels; 20- or 22-inch wheels optional\nAvailable dual chrome-tipped exhaust integrated into rear bumper\nAvailable adjustable cargo-rail tie-down system\nAvailable spray-in bedliner\nAvailable pickup-bed divider and 2-foot bed extender\nAvailable skid-plate package\nAvailable Class IV trailer-hitch receiver\n\nInterior\nThe Ram 1500’s interior will appeal to traditional owners, but it also offers many amenities — including premium seating with soft-touch materials and a console-mounted shifter — that will entice cosmopolitan buyers, too. Stylish contrasting-color seat stitching comes on Sport and Laramie trims, and the crew cab features in-floor storage bins.\n\nOne of the Ram 1500’s more luxurious trim levels is the Laramie Longhorn. It receives full leather seating with laser-etched bolsters, and the front seatbacks have silver steer-logoed metal buckles with magnetic clasps, like a mailbag. An exclusive instrument cluster has the appearance of hand-wrought jewelry with six chrome gauge rings set against a painted taupe silver background and a tooled-metal Laramie Longhorn edition badge. The Laramie Longhorn is equipped with all of the standard equipment found on the Ram Laramie plus navigation radio, remote start, backup camera, front ventilated seats and rear heated seats. Interior features include:\n\nRear seat heating available in Quad Cab, crew cab\nAvailable heated and ventilated front seats\nAvailable power-adjustable pedals\nAvailable surround-sound system\nAvailable dual-zone automatic climate control\nAvailable rear-seat entertainment system\n\nUnder the Hood\nSeveral minor features help the Ram’s fuel economy. The front chin spoiler’s length is designed to improve aerodynamics, and the fuel system automatically stops sending gasoline to the engine when the truck decelerates. Models with the standard 3.7-liter V-6 have a fuel-saver light that lets the driver know when the truck is being driven efficiently.\n\nA new six-speed automatic transmission, which replaces last year’s five-speed automatic, is available. Mechanical features include:\n\n215-horsepower, 3.7-liter V-6, iron block/aluminum cylinder heads, single overhead camshaft, two valves per cylinder, 235 pounds-feet of torque\n310-hp, 4.7-liter V-8, iron block/aluminum cylinder heads, single overhead camshaft, two valves per cylinder, 330 pounds-feet of torque\n383- or 390-hp, 5.7-liter Hemi V-8, iron block/aluminum cylinder heads, cam-in-block, two valves per cylinder, 400 or 407 pounds-feet of torque\nFour-speed automatic (standard with 3.7-liter)\nSix-speed automatic (standard with 4.7-liter, 5.7-liter)\n\nSafety\nSafety features include:\n\nStandard all-disc antilock brakes\nStandard electronic stability system with hill start assist and trailer-sway control\nStandard side curtain airbags\nStandard brake assist applies maximum braking power in panic situations\nAvailable rear park assist\nAvailable backup camera",

      "expert_review": "The redesigned 2013 Ram 1500 is powerful, sexy and cool. Even though it’s not exactly a conventional family vehicle, it can work for your family and offer a lot of good times in the process.\n\nA wise man once told me that he loathed it when people criticized pickup trucks for all that they’re not, so I’m not going to do that. Since this is a family forum, I suppose I could go on about how the Ram 1500 is a gas guzzler compared to other family vehicles or how it’s unrefined compared to those dainty family crossovers. I could even tell you that it’s so high off the ground that your kids practically need an elevator to get in and out of it. But I’m not going to dwell on any of that. The fact is the Ram 1500 is not a crossover, and it hasn’t been designed with families in mind (tsk, tsk!).\n\nAnd to all of that I say: Who cares?!\n\nMy test truck, a Ram 1500 Express Quad Cab 4×4, had a 5.7-liter Hemi V-8. It was kind of horrible on the fuel-efficiency front, but horribly fun as driving goes. I blew all kinds of crossovers off the road with this full-size pickup truck, and it felt good.\n\nThe 2013 Ram 1500 has a starting price of $23,895, including a $995 destination charge. My test truck started at $31,935, but with the addition of the preferred package ($2,340), a 40/20/40-split front seat ($535), Uconnect multimedia system ($665) and trailer brake control ($230), the as-tested price was $36,215.\n\nEXTERIOR\nIf you’re a regular consumer of Cars.com family reviews, it’s likely that you have children and are familiar with the Disney classic movie “Beauty and the Beast.” And if you’re familiar with that tale, you’ll know exactly what I mean when I compare the 2013 Ram 1500 to the character Gaston. It’s a beefed-up specimen that embraces its girth and muscle with fervor.\n\nThanks to its redesign, the Ram 1500 has new grille styles, a new engine and transmission, and a spruced-up interior.\n\nMy test truck included neither running boards nor the new Ram Active Level air suspension feature, which switches between five height modes making entry and exit much easier along with improving off-roading and aerodynamics. Without these features, climbing in and out of this truck without help was next to impossible for my children. The doors are heavy, but this is a full-size truck, so there are some things you must accept.\n\nIt almost goes without saying that at least a month’s worth of groceries along with some skis and bikes can fit in the truck bed with room to spare. Though absent from my test truck, the available RamBox system for the bed offers versatile, secure storage that can be conveniently locked with the key fob.\n\nThe Ram 1500 has a three engine choices: a 305-horsepower, 3.6-liter Pentastar V-6; a 4.7-liter V-8 engine; and my test truck’s 395-hp, 5.7-liter Hemi V-8 engine. It was paired with a six-speed automatic transmission; an eight-speed automatic is available. The 4×4 model I tested with this beast of an engine gets an EPA-estimated 13/19 mpg city/highway and uses regular unleaded gasoline.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Groove-On\n\nINTERIOR\nThe Ram’s cabin is low-key and quite useful. As part of the redesign, the interior’s materials have been upgraded, and it shows. Everything from the charcoal-colored cloth seats, which are optional, to the black knobs and controls look and feel good while remaining modest.\n\nMy test truck’s center stack included a 5-inch touch-screen display and the Uconnect multimedia system that worked easily and look welcomingly underwhelming. A premium multimedia system is available and includes a larger screen and plenty of other bells and whistles that can turn the Ram’s cabin into something that rivals any luxury sedan.\n\nThe truck is available with a regular cab that seats three; the Quad Cab, which I tested, seats six; or the crew cab that also seats six but includes extra legroom for rear passengers. Backseat legroom in the Quad Cab was livable for my children, but adults could have used a few extra inches. My test truck included a multipurpose 40/20/40-split front bench that gives the option of using the narrow middle section as a third seat or as a center console by folding down the seatback.\n\nThere are a variety of cubbies and storage areas throughout the cabin that proved quite useful for my daily life. I was able to fit some small toys in the tiny cubby beneath the center stack air vents, a school project in the cubby above the glove compartment, my rather large SLR camera in the center console, and a whole host of things like shoes and snow clothes under the rear bench seat. There are three cupholders in the front center console and two more on the floor of the rear cab. I admire that Ram included cupholders in the rear, but on the floor they didn’t get much use. They were out of sight, out of mind.\n\nWhile the new eight-speed transmission is controlled with a novel circular knob, the 5.7-liter model that I tested still had a traditional gearshift. It’s so large that I knocked it with my hand every time I went to adjust the radio or climate controls. With that in mind, I would have welcomed the new rotary shift knob and hope that Ram considers adding it to all the transmissions, not just the eight-speed.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2013 Ram 1500 Quad Cab 4×4 has received an overall safety rating of four stars of five from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. It earned five stars in the side crash test, four stars in the frontal crash test and three stars in the rollover test. In crash tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the 2013 Ram 1500 gets the highest rating of Good in frontal moderate-overlap and rear-impact tests, but it gets the second-lowest Marginal rating in the roof-strength test.\n\nThe Ram 1500 Express Quad Cab 4×4 has standard four-wheel drive, four-wheel-disc antilock brakes with brake assist, an electronic stability system with traction control and trailer sway control, and six airbags, including side curtains for both rows. A backup camera with rear parking sensors is optional.\n\nChild-safety seat installation is somewhat tricky in the Ram. The lower Latch anchors are easy to access, particularly with the cloth upholstery that my test truck featured. It’s the top tethers that are more of a challenge. Here’s the bottom line: You won’t find the traditional metal tether anchor. Instead there’s a fabric loop behind each second-row head restraint. To use them, you thread the top tether strap through the loop that’s behind the forward-facing convertible and then hook the top tether strap onto the tether loop that’s on the next seat. This is not an unusual setup in pickup trucks, but it could confuse families who are seeing it for the first time.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2013 Ram 1500 Quad Cab 4×4.",

      "expert_review": "In the age of expensive pickup trucks, you can still get a great deal for under $30,000 — but in the case of the 2014 Ram 1500 Express, the content you’ll have to sacrifice to get there may be too much.\n\nPickup trucks are expensive, far more now than they used to be, with the sticker prices of more well-optioned rigs easily topping $70,000. Even average, midlevel versions can go for nearly $50,000 when you start adding options.\n\nThe folks at Ram, however, think a good pickup doesn’t have to be so expensive — and to prove it, they built the 2014 Ram 1500 Tradesman/Express. Take a Tradesman body type work truck, add a few appearance items, give it a Hemi V-8 engine and — voila: an attractive, two-door, sporty pickup that just happens to be the least-expensive V-8-powered truck in America. What do you get for the money you do spend? Not much, it turns out — not even some of the basics that people have come to expect in modern vehicles, though that hasn’t stopped the Express trim from being massively popular with Ram customers. Compare the 2013 and 2014 Ram 1500s here.\n\nStyling\nThe Dodge Ram light-duty truck got an update for the 2013 model year, making it one of the most attractive pickups on the market. The Express is the base version of the truck, so there isn’t much flash. Instead, Ram has made a few cost-careful cosmetic choices to emphasize sportiness. The Express is limited to a few body styles: only regular or quad cab with the 6-foot-4-inch bed, or crew cab with the shorter 5-foot-7-inch bed. The least expensive version is the one I drove: a standard cab with the regular bed, in 4×2 configuration. Despite its being cheap, it looks complete — body-colored bumpers front and back, blacked-out trim, fog lamps and big 20-inch painted wheels don’t make it look like a stripped-down model. There’s very little chrome for a pickup, but it has a custom sport-truck look to it that’s fantastic. Unfortunately, the Express is also built to a price, so things like a spray-in bedliner and a trailer hitch receiver for towing are extra-cost options.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe best part about the Express is what comes under the hood — a 395-horsepower, 5.7-liter Hemi V-8 engine mated to a six-speed automatic transmission. It also pumps out 410 lb-ft of torque, good enough to lay down some massive stripes if smoky burnouts are your thing. Around town, it means instant acceleration and maximum bass through the truck’s exhaust. A recent back-to-back drive with the much more expensive Ford F-150 Tremor and its twin-turbo V-6 engine gave the crown of best-sounding truck to the Ram, hands-down, thanks to that traditional V-8 rumble.\n\nThe six-speed automatic shifts with authority but feels clunky and outdated — the optional eight-speed would’ve been smoother, more fuel efficient and would have made the 1500 Express quicker off the line, as well. My test truck came with a 3.92:1 rear axle and a limited-slip differential. The former made acceleration a bit quicker than it might have been, the latter helped put the Hemi’s power down in slippery conditions. Not that the 1500 feels slow by any means; all that power in the smallest, lightest pickup in the Ram stable means the truck flies when you ask it to. It also helps the brakes haul the truck to a stop with considerable force.\n\nHandling is typical for a truck, meaning it’s not going to win any autocross events, but the thick steering wheel is grippy and confidence-inspiring. What stands out much more is how well the 1500 rides — choppier than your average family sedan, of course, but much more relaxed and controlled than most pickups over broken pavement. There’s no bouncing around in here and no unusual chassis movements, just a steady, comfortable ride for three people. It’s quiet, too, keeping the Ram’s occupants very well insulated against wind and road noise. \n\nBeing a pickup, the 1500 Express tows and hauls easily, especially with the big, torquey V-8. The truck is rated to tow 9,250 pounds thanks to the 3.92 gear, which is more than enough to haul a boat, a pair of Jet Skis, a camper trailer, even an automobile. Fuel economy is fair for a two-wheel-drive, V-8 pickup, rated 14/20/16 mpg city/highway/combined. My week with the truck averaged a spot-on 16 mpg in an even mix of city and highway driving.\n\nInterior\nHaul yourself up into the cab (there are no side steps) and you’ll plant yourself on a big bench seat — three across, with the center position featuring a fold-down seatback that becomes an armrest, cupholder and storage bin. The driver and passenger seats are plenty comfortable, but I wouldn’t want to test that center seat: Along with a lack of legroom, one has to contend with a thick backrest that just doesn’t look like it would be comfortable for anything more than the quickest jaunt down the street.\n\nAt an as-tested price of $28,380 including destination, this is an inexpensive truck — and it’s easy to see where the cost came out. There’s almost nothing in the interior besides the aforementioned bench seat, which can be optionally clad in cloth rather than vinyl.\n\nStepping inside this truck is like stepping back in time to how trucks used to be: crank windows, manual door locks, manual seats, fixed rear window glass, manual climate control, a column shifter, manual side mirrors and very little in the way of creature comforts. My truck did feature satellite radio as part of a popular equipment group, but the only things “automatic” on the truck are the headlights and the transmission. It will take only a few times having to stretch all the way across the cabin to unlock the passenger door for a friend, or wishing you could reach that door while driving to roll down the window on a hot day, to make you realize that for just $735 more, the Power and Remote Entry Group with power mirrors, locks, windows and a remote key fob would make living with the Express massively easier.\n\nDespite the lack of equipment, the cab is very well-done. The latest Ram pickup interiors are the best in Chrysler history, by far. Even in this stripped-down, entry-level model, material and assembly quality is noticeably good. About the only thing to complain about is the drabness of it all in diesel gray, but with the money you’ve saved getting the Express over a more expensive truck, you can easily spring for some aftermarket leather seat coverings in matching body-colored red to spice things up.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThere isn’t much to talk about in the Express in terms of electronics. There’s a standard trip computer in the gauge cluster, which itself is clear and easy to read, but there isn’t even a CD player in there. There is, however, a media hub containing an aux jack, USB port and 12-volt auxiliary power outlet in the fold-down console. In my tester, satellite radio was present thanks to an option package, but there was no Chrysler Uconnect, the company’s excellent multimedia system, at this price. Again, it feels like a throwback to a simpler time, but it does offer an interesting palette for customization.\n\nCargo\nIt’s a pickup, so cargo is ostensibly the name of the game, and there’s a full-size 6-foot-4-inch bed behind the cabin that can accommodate anything you might need for towing. Payload is rated at 1,620 pounds, but without an optional spray-in bedliner, practically whatever you put in the cargo box is going to scratch up the paint. The RamBox fender storage system is optional. Storage inside the truck is limited to some space behind the seats, but with two larger cab sizes available (Quad Cab and Crew Cab), the option to have a more capacious cabin is there.\n\nSafety\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety rated the Ram 1500 good in every test except the roof-crush strength, where it was rated marginal.\n\nThere’s not much in the way of extra safety equipment in the 1500 Express, but the basics are here, like front- and side-impact airbags and stability control. The 2014 Ram 1500 has been crash-tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, from which it got a mixture of four and five stars throughout the various tests. See the results of the crash tests here and a list of the 1500’s safety equipment here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe Ram 1500 Express justifies its existence right here, in the value category. As equipped, my truck cost $28,380 including a rather hefty $1,195 destination charge (a Mercedes-Benz S63 AMG luxury sedan has a destination charge of $925 and it was shipped here from Germany on a boat, not put on a train from a factory in suburban Detroit). Ram has adjusted prices over the course of this past year, however, with my example now costing $28,630 as-tested rather than the $28,380 seen on its window sticker when I had it.\n\nThat’s a pretty good price for a V-8 truck with all the basics you need to get by, but as stated earlier, checking the box for the Power and Remote Entry package still brings you in under $30,000 and makes the Express a much more pleasant truck to live with on a daily basis. Adding the eight-speed automatic would also be a good decision, but strangely it also eliminates your ability to opt for a cloth seat instead of the standard vinyl. Choose your own options on one here.\n\nThe Ford F-150 has an STX trim level that does much of what the 1500 Express does: provide an entry-level, relatively inexpensive sporty truck for younger buyers with limited means. It’s more expensive than the 1500 Express and does not include a standard V-8 engine, but it does have more standard equipment, like power windows and locks. Optioning one up to match some of the features of the 1500 Express (V-8 engine, 20-inch alloy wheels, fog lights) does push it well above $32,000, however, giving the value advantage to the Ram.\n\nOver at Chevrolet, there really is no equivalent entry-level sport truck — it’s all about work at this low price. A regular-cab Chevrolet Silverado 4×2 with the 2WT package is roughly equivalent, but like the Ford it does not include a V-8 engine or 20-inch wheels. It does have a more advanced electronics suite, however, with Chevrolet MyLink and satellite radio standard, along with more power equipment than the Ram offers. Neither the Ford nor the Chevy can match the best-in-class Ram’s 5.7-liter V-8’s power and torque, however. Compare all three here.\n\nSo yes, you can get a cool truck for under $30,000 these days. But pay a little extra for the convenience touches, and your cool truck will become much more enjoyable.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Three years since significant drivetrain and chassis upgrades made it a standout, the Ram 1500 full-size half-ton pickup truck has lost ground to more recently redesigned body-type competitors, but it remains a satisfying truck in many ways.\n\nVersus the competition: It’s not the right choice for the pickup shopper who wants the latest active-safety features or must haul or tow the absolute heaviest loads, but otherwise the 2016 Ram 1500 belies its age.\n\nThe 2016 model year sees the introduction of a new top trim level, the Laramie Limited, which shares an updated grille design introduced by the Rebel trim last year and incorporates Argento wood and premium leather inside. See 2015 and 2016 model specifications compared side-by-side here.\nExterior & Styling\nLike the other domestic full-size pickups, the Ram 1500 comes in different cab styles, most with a choice of wheelbase and bed length. The regular cab comes with a 6-foot-4 cargo box or an 8-foot box. The latter adds 20 inches of wheelbase and 22 inches from bumper to bumper.\n\nThe extended cab, or Quad Cab, comes in only one wheelbase and the 6-foot-4 cargo box. The full crew cab’s cargo beds are 5-foot-7 or 6-foot-4, the latter version of which adds roughly 9 inches to both the wheelbase and the overall length.\n\nRam (formerly Dodge Ram) trucks fought their way into the big leagues partly on the strength of bold styling like no one had seen before, and derivations of that so-called big-rig styling have lasted through today, but some would argue Chevrolet and GMC now have the boldest-looking half-tons.\n\nThe Rebel trim level, introduced as a late 2015 model, and the new-for-2016 Laramie Limited trim level have a new grille that replaces the long-standing crosshair design with a large RAM logo. The classic styling still looks good, but we suspect these two predict coming changes for the whole line.\n\nThe Rebel rides higher on standard 33-inch wheels and has off-road provisions like skid plates and tow hooks (see the 2015 Rebel take on Toyota’s designated desert-runner, the Tundra TRD Pro, here).\nHow It Drives\nWhat has defined the Ram 1500’s past few model years, and in my opinion dulled the impact of the Chevrolet Silverado’s and GMC Sierra’s 2014 redesigns, has been its ride quality and efficiency. The truck owes these attributes, in part, to early adoption of an eight-speed automatic transmission (with some engines) as well as an optional air suspension system that was unprecedented and remains exclusive in this class: In addition to providing a smooth ride, the air springs allow the driver to select various ride heights, including an access height and two off-road heights (it’s standard on the Rebel). The system also can automatically lower the truck at highway speeds for better fuel efficiency. In our experience, the 4-Corner Air Suspension option delivered the goods, but unfortunately two things have stolen some of its thunder.\n\nFirst, some versions of the redesigned Ford F-150 and GM trucks ride as comfortably without air springs and their added cost. Second, we’ve found that the ride quality goes south when towing. First time out, we noticed it while towing a 6,700-pound horse trailer with a Ram 1500 Laramie minus the weight-distributing hitch recommended for trailers of this size. An F-150 we tested alongside the Ram, which also called for a weight-distributing hitch, performed fine with the same trailer. Later tests with the air suspension and the proper hitch didn’t solve the problem. No matter how the trailer was set up, there was too much sag.\n\nThe Ram’s mileage is led by the stout base gasoline 3.6-liter V-6 and a 3.0-liter diesel V-6 that counts Cars.com editors among its fans. The top EPA-estimated mileage comes from HFE (high fuel efficiency) versions powered by gasoline (18/25/21 mpg city/highway/combined) or diesel (21/29/24 mpg) engines. Note that the HFE treatment comes only with rear-wheel drive and at added cost. Non-HFE versions of the Ram lose 1 mpg city and highway in diesel and 1 mpg city and combined in gas versions. Four-wheel drive shaves an additional 1 mpg combined from the V-6 engines.\n\nFor comparison, the most efficient rear-wheel-drive competitors are the Silverado with the V-6 (18/24/20 mpg), the F-150 with the  2.7-liter EcoBoost V-6 (19/26/22) and the Tundra with the 4.6-liter V-8 (15/19/16).\n\nTypical of diesels, the Ram sacrifices horsepower, though, with just 240 hp at 3,600 rpm despite 420 lb-ft of torque at 2,000 rpm. This translates to slower sprints: In the Showdown against the models listed above, our Ram EcoDiesel hit 60 mph in 8.9 seconds, behind the gas Tundra at 7.7, the Silverado at 6.96 and the F-150 at 6.36 seconds. Adding 1,500 pounds of payload added more than a second but made no great difference in the intervals between the contestants.\n\nIn braking, the Ram came in third in our recent Texas Truck Showdown when empty and really struggled with payload, coming in fourth to zero from 60 mph, at 157.7 feet. Perhaps our Ram’s curb weight, the highest of the four at 5,460 pounds, as measured, played a part. Its payload rating, calculated and rated, was indeed the lowest of the bunch.\n\nAs for the Ram’s V-6 gas engine, competitors have closed the gap with its 21 mpg combined rating over the past few model years. Equipped with a V-6 engine and rear-wheel drive, the GM pickups are rated an EPA-estimated 20 mpg combined. With turbocharged 2.7- and 3.5-liter V-6 engines, the F-150 gets as high as an estimated 22 and 20 mpg combined, respectively. Our testing last year bore out these estimates roughly, with the exception of the 3.5-liter EcoBoost, which was more than 1.5 mpg short of its EPA estimate.\n\nThe Ram’s 5.7-liter V-8 generates 395 hp and 410 pounds-feet of torque, which compares to competitors’ entry-level V-8s but is lower than an optional 6.2-liter V-8 that delivers 420 hp and 460 pounds-feet of torque in the Chevrolet Silverado 1500 and GMC Sierra 1500.\n\nIn the Showdown testing of a different set of trucks equipped for maximum towing, a Sierra with the 6.2-liter took first in the zero-to-60 in just 5.9 seconds (rounded to tenths), empty. The Ram V-8 essentially tied with the 5.3-liter Silverado and 5.7-liter Tundra at 7.0 seconds. But second place went to the F-150, again with an EcoBoost V-6 rather than the available 5.0-liter V-8, at 6.4 seconds.\n\nCarrying 1,750 pounds of payload, again the GMC came in first (6.9 seconds) followed by the Ford (7.2), the Chevy (8.3), the Toyota (8.4) and finally the Ram (8.7 seconds). In our experience, the Ram 1500’s eight-speed automatic is very well behaved when towing and hauling, and its short initial gear ratios give it a nice, quick pop off the line — as do the GM trucks’ eight-speeds — but unfortunately the Ram tends to lose ground after roughly 30 mph.\n\nAs with the EcoDiesel, the V-8 Ram’s braking was middling when empty but the longest from 60-to-zero mph when loaded, at 161.6 feet, perhaps reflecting its relatively high weight and a calculated 1,300-pound payload capacity, below the load weight. (The Tundra’s capacity was even lower, at 1,200 pounds, but it accelerated a few tenths quicker and stopped a few feet shorter.)\n\nThe V-8 Ram 1500’s eight-speed transmission provides a maximum EPA-estimated 17 mpg combined, which kept the 2013 model competitive, but now that the other domestics have been redesigned, it falls behind: The 5.3-liter V-8-powered Silverado makes up to an estimated 18 mpg combined, and the F-150 with EcoBoost 3.5-liter V-6 is rated 20 mpg, both with rear-wheel drive. (Ford positions its turbo 3.5-liter against competing V-8s – legitimately, because it produces 365 hp and 420 pounds-feet of torque, but as stated above, its real-world efficiency has fallen short in testing.) The Tundra gets an estimated 16 mpg combined with the smaller V-8 and 15 mpg with the larger one, regardless of driveline. Note that the Ram V-8 prefers midgrade gasoline for rated output while the others call for regular octane.\n\nEven the Ford 5.0-liter V-8 (385 hp and 387 pounds-feet) gets an estimated 18 mpg combined versus the Ram’s 17 mpg, but ties it with four-wheel drive. The non-turbo 3.5-liter Ford V-6 4×4 rates 19 mpg.\n\nIn our real-world Showdown testing, the Ram V-8 came in last with 17.7 mpg combined, behind the Tundra (17.9), F-150 3.5-liter EcoBoost (22.8) and the Silverado and Sierra (23.9 mpg). When towing a 10,100-pound trailer, the Ram beat the Tundra for fourth place by 0.7 mpg at 10.7 mpg.\nInside\nNone of the full-size pickups are small inside, but if you’re looking strictly at the seating dimensions, the Ram is a bit shy on legroom, including the crew cab’s backseat. In this field, the best place for the tallest occupants is the front seat of the current GM trucks and the backseat of an F-150 crew cab.\n\nDespite its years since a redesign, the Ram’s cabin remains a very nice place to be. All told, the entry-level Rams aren’t bad, but there’s no mistaking the plain gauges, small radio and minimalist console in an Express from the equivalent in higher trim levels, such as the Laramie Longhorn, which has high-quality, aromatic leather and generally high-class materials. It isn’t all a step up, though: The Laramie’s gauge faces are too ornate for their own good; legibility is lost amid the filigree. The large, full-color display between the gauges, however, is a winner, offering a wealth of information – though the same feature in the F-150 offers even more.\n\nI know some disagree, but I like the rotary gear-selector knob, primarily because it enables operation without looking; just feel the clicks. It also takes up minimal space, providing plenty on the console.\n\nOver the past two years, since the GM and Ford competitors have been redesigned, our editors have continued to give the Ram top ratings for outward visibility, comfort, ergonomics and interior quality, especially for the price. The steering wheel is even in the right place — Chevrolet and GMC still aim theirs slightly toward the driver’s door — but a telescoping adjustment to accompany the tilt is overdue. Power-adjustable pedals are included in higher trim levels.\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe Ram’s various controls are well laid out; the optional trailer-brake controls are in sight and within reach, unlike the Tundra’s. The Ram’s multimedia offering also remains strong – in the form of the optional 8.4-inch touch-screen Uconnect system. In addition to a large screen with a configurable home row of icons at the bottom, Uconnect 8.4 — available with or without built-in navigation — has clear, easy-to-use menus and reacts quickly in response to touch when new (sadly, we’ve found some of the more elaborate systems get slower with age like a smartphone). Freezes and other glitches with the 8.4 system in other Fiat Chrysler Automobiles vehicles have been rare, though we’ve seen them.\n\nThe lesser systems include Uconnect 3.0 and 5.0, both named for their screen sizes (display only, not touch-screen), which have AM and FM. New for 2016, Bluetooth hands-free telephone and audio streaming is available across the lineup, but not always standard. A CD player is optional across the board, but USB and analog input jacks are standard. Add option packages or move into higher trim levels, and you’ll see additional USB ports, including one added data port and another powerful enough to charge tablets. When installed on the owner’s smartphone, the Uconnect Access app allows internet radio like Pandora, iHeartRadio and Slacker to play through the stereo using the phone’s data plan. Aha provides additional entertainment and information sources.\n\nOptional Uconnect Access Advantage adds built-in cellular hardware that, under subscription, provides collision notification, roadside assistance, monthly vehicle health reports and an optional Wi-Fi hot spot. Though GM has implemented 4G LTE connectivity, the Ram’s hot spot remains 3G, which we find is often too slow for video viewing.\n\nRam still doesn’t offer Apple CarPlay or Android Auto, features that are making their way into GM trucks and will join the F-150 at the start of the 2017 model year. Ford says they can be added to existing 2016 models at that time.\nCargo & Towing\nThe Ram 1500’s standard and optional cargo provisions are many, starting with large center console bins and door pockets, and a bilevel glove compartment. In the back of the crew cab, once you raise the rear seats’ bottom cushions, you’ll find they incorporate handy lights that shine down at the floor where you also can fold an available platform forward to provide a wide in-cabin cargo floor.\n\nMost intriguing may be the optional RamBox storage bins in the cargo box walls, available with the two shorter bed lengths but not the 8-foot. Fitted on both sides, the bins each provide 8.6 cubic feet of volume with the 6-foot-4 bed and 7.3 cubic feet with the 5-foot-7 bed. They’re good for anything from sports equipment or beverages on ice (there are drain holes) to tools or rifles. As of a few years ago, the boxes remote lock and unlock along with the doors and are illuminated.\n\nIf I have a complaint, it’s that Ram hasn’t provided more of these nifty features – something its sister brands have long done, especially in minivans. Ford has detractors for the F-150’s retractable side and tailgate steps, but I’m a fan. Mopar offers some nice add-ons for Ram, but they’re not long on innovation.\n\nAs noted above, we’ve been disappointed by how the otherwise sublime air suspension responds when towing, but fortunately it’s not standard equipment. Beyond that, the domestic competitors have passed the Ram’s maximum towing capacities. With a gasoline V-6, the 2016 Ram 1500’s maximum trailer ratings range from 4,170 to 7,470 pounds. (Cargo ratings vary with axle ratio and bed length as well as engine, cab style and rear- or four-wheel drive.) The EcoDiesel ranges from 7,540 to 9,210 pounds, and the V-8 ranges from 6,730 to 10,640 pounds. (With a few exceptions, four-wheel drive and larger cabs rob more towing and payload capacity.)\n\nIn comparison, the 2016 Silverado 1500 V-6 ranges from 5,400 to 7,600 pounds maximum towing, the 5.3-liter V-8 from 6,100 to 11,100 pounds and the 6.2-liter V-8 from 9,100 to 12,000 pounds.\n\nEquipped with the 2.7-liter EcoBoost V-6, the 2016 F-150’s towing maximum ranges from 7,500 to 8,500 pounds. The 3.5-liter EcoBoost V-6 from 5,000 to 12,200 pounds and the V-8 from 8,300 to 11,100 pounds.\n\nThe Tundra’s maximum capacities range from 6,400 to 6,800 pounds with the 4.6-liter V-8 and from 9,100 to 10,500 pounds with the 5.7-liter. \n\nThe Ram also has a deficit in payload capacity, at 1,890 pounds in the highest-rated configuration. Chevy rates the Silverado at 2,160 pounds, Ford says the F-150 hits 3,270 and Toyota says the Tundra tops out at 2,060 pounds.\nSafety\nIn National Highway Traffic Safety Administration testing, the 2016 Ram 1500 earned four out of five stars overall for all three cab styles. This is one star behind domestic half-ton full-size rivals but equal to the Toyota Tundra. In Insurance Institute for Highway Safety testing, despite frame and body modifications for 2016, the Ram 1500 extended and crew cabs earned scores of marginal (out of a possible good, acceptable, marginal or poor) in the small overlap frontal test. It shares this result with crew-cab versions of the Silverado, Sierra and Tundra. Extended-cab versions of these three are rated acceptable in the small overlap, and only the F-150 rates good in both cab styles.\n\nThe full-size pickup class scores good in almost all other IIHS crashworthiness tests. The Ram rates marginal for roof strength, an indicator of rollover protection. The crew-cab Tundra rates acceptable, but its extended cab and all other competitors rate good.\n\nA backup camera and front and rear park assist sensors are optional on the Ram 1500. Though optional forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking has found its way into the F-150, Silverado and Sierra, it’s still not offered in the Ram or Tundra. The GM trucks have lane departure warning and the Tundra has blind spot warning. The F-150 offers both. The Ram has neither.\n\nAutomatic collision notification comes with the Uconnect Access Advantage option, which adds cellular communication separate from an occupant’s smartphone.\n\nSee how child-safety seats fit in the Ram 1500 in our 2015 Car Seat Check, which also applies to the 2016.\n\nView all safety features here.\nValue in Its Class\nIn Cars.com’s roundup tests of half-ton pickups, the Ram 1500 continues to score high marks for value, especially in the Laramie Longhorn, described as having the look and options of a luxury truck for a midrange price. Working against it are higher operating costs with the gas engines due to faltering fuel efficiency in a competitive class – excluding the EcoDiesel. In the Ram’s favor are the diesel itself, promised but not yet delivered by Ford, and generous warranties: five years/100,000 miles for the diesel and five years/60,000 miles for both gas power plants.\n\nCompare the Ram with the Silverado, F-150 and Tundra side-by-side here.\n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in May 2016 about the 2016 Ram 1500. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2017, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe 2016 model year sees the introduction of a new top trim level, the Laramie Limited, which shares an updated grille design introduced by the Rebel trim last year and incorporates Argento wood and premium leather inside. See 2015 and 2016 model specifications compared side-by-side here.\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nLike the other domestic full-size pickups, the Ram 1500 comes in different cab styles, most with a choice of wheelbase and bed length. The regular cab comes with a 6-foot-4 cargo box or an 8-foot box. The latter adds 20 inches of wheelbase and 22 inches from bumper to bumper.\n\nThe extended cab, or Quad Cab, comes in only one wheelbase and the 6-foot-4 cargo box. The full crew cab’s cargo beds are 5-foot-7 or 6-foot-4, the latter version of which adds roughly 9 inches to both the wheelbase and the overall length.\n\nRam (formerly Dodge Ram) trucks fought their way into the big leagues partly on the strength of bold styling like no one had seen before, and derivations of that so-called big-rig styling have lasted through today, but some would argue Chevrolet and GMC now have the boldest-looking half-tons.\n\nThe Rebel trim level, introduced as a late 2015 model, and the new-for-2016 Laramie Limited trim level have a new grille that replaces the long-standing crosshair design with a large RAM logo. The classic styling still looks good, but we suspect these two predict coming changes for the whole line.\n\nThe Rebel rides higher on standard 33-inch wheels and has off-road provisions like skid plates and tow hooks (see the 2015 Rebel take on Toyota’s designated desert-runner, the Tundra TRD Pro, here).\n\nHow It Drives\n\nWhat has defined the Ram 1500’s past few model years, and in my opinion dulled the impact of the Chevrolet Silverado’s and GMC Sierra’s 2014 redesigns, has been its ride quality and efficiency. The truck owes these attributes, in part, to early adoption of an eight-speed automatic transmission (with some engines) as well as an optional air suspension system that was unprecedented and remains exclusive in this class: In addition to providing a smooth ride, the air springs allow the driver to select various ride heights, including an access height and two off-road heights (it’s standard on the Rebel). The system also can automatically lower the truck at highway speeds for better fuel efficiency. In our experience, the 4-Corner Air Suspension option delivered the goods, but unfortunately two things have stolen some of its thunder.\n\nFirst, some versions of the redesigned Ford F-150 and GM trucks ride as comfortably without air springs and their added cost. Second, we’ve found that the ride quality goes south when towing. First time out, we noticed it while towing a 6,700-pound horse trailer with a Ram 1500 Laramie minus the weight-distributing hitch recommended for trailers of this size. An F-150 we tested alongside the Ram, which also called for a weight-distributing hitch, performed fine with the same trailer. Later tests with the air suspension and the proper hitch didn’t solve the problem. No matter how the trailer was set up, there was too much sag.\n\nThe Ram’s mileage is led by the stout base gasoline 3.6-liter V-6 and a 3.0-liter diesel V-6 that counts Cars.com editors among its fans. The top EPA-estimated mileage comes from HFE (high fuel efficiency) versions powered by gasoline (18/25/21 mpg city/highway/combined) or diesel (21/29/24 mpg) engines. Note that the HFE treatment comes only with rear-wheel drive and at added cost. Non-HFE versions of the Ram lose 1 mpg city and highway in diesel and 1 mpg city and combined in gas versions. Four-wheel drive shaves an additional 1 mpg combined from the V-6 engines.\n\nFor comparison, the most efficient rear-wheel-drive competitors are the Silverado with the V-6 (18/24/20 mpg), the F-150 with the  2.7-liter EcoBoost V-6 (19/26/22) and the Tundra with the 4.6-liter V-8 (15/19/16).\n\nTypical of diesels, the Ram sacrifices horsepower, though, with just 240 hp at 3,600 rpm despite 420 pounds-feet of torque at 2,000 rpm. This translates to slower sprints: In the Showdown against the models listed above, our Ram EcoDiesel hit 60 mph in 8.9 seconds, behind the gas Tundra at 7.7, the Silverado at 6.96 and the F-150 at 6.36 seconds. Adding 1,500 pounds of payload added more than a second but made no great difference in the intervals between the contestants.\n\nIn braking, the Ram came in third in our recent Texas Truck Showdown when empty and really struggled with payload, coming in fourth to zero from 60 mph, at 157.7 feet. Perhaps our Ram’s curb weight, the highest of the four at 5,460 pounds, as measured, played a part. Its payload rating, calculated and rated, was indeed the lowest of the bunch.\n\nAs for the Ram’s V-6 gas engine, competitors have closed the gap with its 21 mpg combined rating over the past few model years. Equipped with a V-6 engine and rear-wheel drive, the GM pickups are rated an EPA-estimated 20 mpg combined. With turbocharged 2.7- and 3.5-liter V-6 engines, the F-150 gets as high as an estimated 22 and 20 mpg combined, respectively. Our testing last year bore out these estimates roughly, with the exception of the 3.5-liter EcoBoost, which was more than 1.5 mpg short of its EPA estimate.\n\nThe Ram’s 5.7-liter V-8 generates 395 hp and 410 pounds-feet of torque, which compares to competitors’ entry-level V-8s but is lower than an optional 6.2-liter V-8 that delivers 420 hp and 460 pounds-feet of torque in the Chevrolet Silverado 1500 and GMC Sierra 1500.\n\nIn the Showdown testing of a different set of trucks equipped for maximum towing, a Sierra with the 6.2-liter took first in the zero-to-60 in just 5.9 seconds (rounded to tenths), empty. The Ram V-8 essentially tied with the 5.3-liter Silverado and 5.7-liter Tundra at 7.0 seconds. But second place went to the F-150, again with an EcoBoost V-6 rather than the available 5.0-liter V-8, at 6.4 seconds.\n\nCarrying 1,750 pounds of payload, again the GMC came in first (6.9 seconds) followed by the Ford (7.2), the Chevy (8.3), the Toyota (8.4) and finally the Ram (8.7 seconds). In our experience, the Ram 1500’s eight-speed automatic is very well behaved when towing and hauling, and its short initial gear ratios give it a nice, quick pop off the line — as do the GM trucks’ eight-speeds — but unfortunately the Ram tends to lose ground after roughly 30 mph.\n\nAs with the EcoDiesel, the V-8 Ram’s braking was middling when empty but the longest from 60-to-zero mph when loaded, at 161.6 feet, perhaps reflecting its relatively high weight and a calculated 1,300-pound payload capacity, below the load weight. (The Tundra’s capacity was even lower, at 1,200 pounds, but it accelerated a few tenths quicker and stopped a few feet shorter.)\n\nThe V-8 Ram 1500’s eight-speed transmission provides a maximum EPA-estimated 17 mpg combined, which kept the 2013 model competitive, but now that the other domestics have been redesigned, it falls behind: The 5.3-liter V-8-powered Silverado makes up to an estimated 18 mpg combined, and the F-150 with EcoBoost 3.5-liter V-6 is rated 20 mpg, both with rear-wheel drive. (Ford positions its turbo 3.5-liter against competing V-8s — legitimately, because it produces 365 hp and 420 pounds-feet of torque, but as stated above, its real-world efficiency has fallen short in testing.) The Tundra gets an estimated 16 mpg combined with the smaller V-8 and 15 mpg with the larger one, regardless of driveline. Note that the Ram V-8 prefers midgrade gasoline for rated output while the others call for regular octane.\n\nEven the Ford 5.0-liter V-8 (385 hp and 387 pounds-feet) gets an estimated 18 mpg combined versus the Ram’s 17 mpg, but ties it with four-wheel drive. The non-turbo 3.5-liter Ford V-6 4×4 rates 19 mpg.\n\nIn our real-world Showdown testing, the Ram V-8 came in last with 17.7 mpg combined, behind the Tundra (17.9), F-150 3.5-liter EcoBoost (22.8) and the Silverado and Sierra (23.9 mpg). When towing a 10,100-pound trailer, the Ram beat the Tundra for fourth place by 0.7 mpg at 10.7 mpg.\n\nInside\n\nNone of the full-size pickups are small inside, but if you’re looking strictly at the seating dimensions, the Ram is a bit shy on legroom, including the crew cab’s backseat. In this field, the best place for the tallest occupants is the front seat of the current GM trucks and the backseat of an F-150 crew cab.\n\nDespite its years since a redesign, the Ram’s cabin remains a very nice place to be. All told, the entry-level Rams aren’t bad, but there’s no mistaking the plain gauges, small radio and minimalist console in an Express from the equivalent in higher trim levels, such as the Laramie Longhorn, which has high-quality, aromatic leather and generally high-class materials. It isn’t all a step up, though: The Laramie’s gauge faces are too ornate for their own good; legibility is lost amid the filigree. The large, full-color display between the gauges, however, is a winner, offering a wealth of information — though the same feature in the F-150 offers even more.\n\nI know some disagree, but I like the rotary gear-selector knob, primarily because it enables operation without looking; just feel the clicks. It also takes up minimal space, providing plenty on the console.\n\nOver the past two years, since the GM and Ford competitors have been redesigned, our editors have continued to give the Ram top ratings for outward visibility, comfort, ergonomics and interior quality, especially for the price. The steering wheel is even in the right place — Chevrolet and GMC still aim theirs slightly toward the driver’s door — but a telescoping adjustment to accompany the tilt is overdue. Power-adjustable pedals are included in higher trim levels.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nThe Ram’s various controls are well laid out; the optional trailer-brake controls are in sight and within reach, unlike the Tundra’s. The Ram’s multimedia offering also remains strong — in the form of the optional 8.4-inch touch-screen Uconnect system. In addition to a large screen with a configurable home row of icons at the bottom, Uconnect 8.4 — available with or without built-in navigation — has clear, easy-to-use menus and reacts quickly in response to touch when new (sadly, we’ve found some of the more elaborate systems get slower with age like a smartphone). Freezes and other glitches with the 8.4 system in other Fiat Chrysler Automobiles vehicles have been rare, though we’ve seen them.\n\nThe lesser systems include Uconnect 3.0 and 5.0, both named for their screen sizes (display only, not touch-screen), which have AM and FM. New for 2016, Bluetooth hands-free telephone and audio streaming is available across the lineup, but not always standard. A CD player is optional across the board, but USB and analog input jacks are standard. Add option packages or move into higher trim levels, and you’ll see additional USB ports, including one added data port and another powerful enough to charge tablets. When installed on the owner’s smartphone, the Uconnect Access app allows internet radio like Pandora, iHeartRadio and Slacker to play through the stereo using the phone’s data plan. Aha provides additional entertainment and information sources.\n\nOptional Uconnect Access Advantage adds built-in cellular hardware that, under subscription, provides collision notification, roadside assistance, monthly vehicle health reports and an optional Wi-Fi hot spot. Though GM has implemented 4G LTE connectivity, the Ram’s hot spot remains 3G, which we find is often too slow for video viewing.\n\nRam still doesn’t offer Apple CarPlay or Android Auto, features that are making their way into GM trucks and will join the F-150 at the start of the 2017 model year. Ford says they can be added to existing 2016 models at that time.\n\nCargo & Towing\n\nThe Ram 1500’s standard and optional cargo provisions are many, starting with large center console bins and door pockets, and a bilevel glove compartment. In the back of the crew cab, once you raise the rear seats’ bottom cushions, you’ll find they incorporate handy lights that shine down at the floor where you also can fold an available platform forward to provide a wide in-cabin cargo floor.\n\nMost intriguing may be the optional RamBox storage bins in the cargo box walls, available with the two shorter bed lengths but not the 8-foot. Fitted on both sides, the bins each provide 8.6 cubic feet of volume with the 6-foot-4 bed and 7.3 cubic feet with the 5-foot-7 bed. They’re good for anything from sports equipment or beverages on ice (there are drain holes) to tools or rifles. As of a few years ago, the boxes remote lock and unlock along with the doors and are illuminated.\n\nIf I have a complaint, it’s that Ram hasn’t provided more of these nifty features — something its sister brands have long done, especially in minivans. Ford has detractors for the F-150’s retractable side and tailgate steps, but I’m a fan. Mopar offers some nice add-ons for Ram, but they’re not long on innovation.\n\nAs noted above, we’ve been disappointed by how the otherwise sublime air suspension responds when towing, but fortunately it’s not standard equipment. Beyond that, the domestic competitors have passed the Ram’s maximum towing capacities. With a gasoline V-6, the 2016 Ram 1500’s maximum trailer ratings range from 4,170 to 7,470 pounds. (Cargo ratings vary with axle ratio and bed length as well as engine, cab style and rear- or four-wheel drive.) The EcoDiesel ranges from 7,540 to 9,210 pounds, and the V-8 ranges from 6,730 to 10,640 pounds. (With a few exceptions, four-wheel drive and larger cabs rob more towing and payload capacity.)\n\nIn comparison, the 2016 Silverado 1500 V-6 ranges from 5,400 to 7,600 pounds maximum towing, the 5.3-liter V-8 from 6,100 to 11,100 pounds and the 6.2-liter V-8 from 9,100 to 12,000 pounds.\n\nEquipped with the 2.7-liter EcoBoost V-6, the 2016 F-150’s towing maximum ranges from 7,500 to 8,500 pounds. The 3.5-liter EcoBoost V-6 from 5,000 to 12,200 pounds and the V-8 from 8,300 to 11,100 pounds.\n\nThe Tundra’s maximum capacities range from 6,400 to 6,800 pounds with the 4.6-liter V-8 and from 9,100 to 10,500 pounds with the 5.7-liter.  \n\nThe Ram also has a deficit in payload capacity, at 1,890 pounds in the highest-rated configuration. Chevy rates the Silverado at 2,160 pounds, Ford says the F-150 hits 3,270 and Toyota says the Tundra tops out at 2,060 pounds.\n\nSafety\n\nIn National Highway Traffic Safety Administration testing, the 2016 Ram 1500 earned four out of five stars overall for all three cab styles. This is one star behind domestic half-ton full-size rivals but equal to the Toyota Tundra. In Insurance Institute for Highway Safety testing, despite frame and body modifications for 2016, the Ram 1500 extended and crew cabs earned scores of marginal (out of a possible good, acceptable, marginal or poor) in the small overlap frontal test. It shares this result with crew-cab versions of the Silverado, Sierra and Tundra. Extended-cab versions of these three are rated acceptable in the small overlap, and only the F-150 rates good in both cab styles.\n\nThe full-size pickup class scores good in almost all other IIHS crashworthiness tests. The Ram rates marginal for roof strength, an indicator of rollover protection. The crew-cab Tundra rates acceptable, but its extended cab and all other competitors rate good.\n\nA backup camera and front and rear park assist sensors are optional on the Ram 1500. Though optional forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking has found its way into the F-150, Silverado and Sierra, it’s still not offered in the Ram or Tundra. The GM trucks have lane departure warning and the Tundra has blind spot warning. The F-150 offers both. The Ram has neither.\n\nAutomatic collision notification comes with the Uconnect Access Advantage option, which adds cellular communication separate from an occupant’s smartphone.\n\nSee how child-safety seats fit in the Ram 1500 in our 2015 Car Seat Check, which also applies to the 2016.\n\nView all safety features here.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nIn Cars.com’s roundup tests of half-ton pickups, the Ram 1500 continues to score high marks for value, especially in the Laramie Longhorn, described as having the look and options of a luxury truck for a midrange price. Working against it are higher operating costs with the gas engines due to faltering fuel efficiency in a competitive class — excluding the EcoDiesel. In the Ram’s favor are the diesel itself, promised but not yet delivered by Ford, and generous warranties: five years/100,000 miles for the diesel and five years/60,000 miles for both gas power plants.\n\nCompare the Ram with the Silverado, F-150 and Tundra side-by-side here.",
