      "expert_review": "With more bells and whistles than I could count, the 2009 Hyundai Genesis appeared to be a knight in shining armor…at first. I swooned over the automatic tilting/telescoping steering wheel. My heart melted when I adjusted the ultra comfy, heated leather seats and then skipped a beat when I noticed the automatic sunscreen shading my rear passengers.\n\nThe equally impressive yet subtle exterior lived up to any fairy godmother’s standards. This sedan looks good. Really good.\n\nHowever, the Genesis does have a few strikes against it; in fairy-tale terms, hold onto your glass slippers, ladies, because the clock is about to strike midnight. To my surprise, my test car, the top-of-the-line Genesis, was just as expensive as many of its luxury competitors once you added in all of the fun stuff. Try as I might, the huge savings could not and would not be found.\n\nFor the record, the 375-horsepower V-8 engine in my test car had plenty of power, and I didn’t question its roadworthiness whatsoever. However, I was expecting more. The Genesis engine runs quiet and lacks the sporty “vroom-vroom” appeal needed to catch my attention. Of course, tastes differ. Our friends at Cars.com named the Genesis its 2009 Car of the Year.\n\nThe Genesis shows strength of character where we moms like it most – in the safety and security categories. Phenomenal crash-test ratings gave the Genesis the extra oomph it needed to earn this skeptical mom’s praise.\n\nExterior\n\nThe Genesis’ exterior is so sleek-looking that it’s slippery. It even caught the eye of many luxury-car drivers out on the roads. Despite a seemingly low profile, the Genesis actually sits higher up than I had expected. The sedan’s nose is quiet – save the snickering fog lights – and unassuming without a logo in sight for added intrigue.\n\nWide door openings made getting in and out easy for my little ones without the doors themselves being so wide that they’d cause problems in tight parking lots.\n\nThe Genesis’ side mirrors could have been much, much larger as the standard set seemed like an afterthought. Since the rest of the car is so nice, these teeny-tiny mirrors just didn’t fit the overall look.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\n\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Some\n\nInterior\n\nHere is where all of the oohs and aahs really took place. A two-toned dash swooped its way around front passengers in the same fashion as a whirl of a fairy godmother’s wand. The power-adjustable leather front seats are both heated and cooled. Glossy wood accents added refinement to the doors, center console and gearshift.\n\nWhat I appreciated most in Genesis was its joystick for controlling the multimedia system; this was inspired by its luxury competitors. Despite being a much simpler version (not necessarily a bad thing), I liked Hyundai’s take on incorporating this technology. The large center knob both spins and toggles, allowing you to scroll quickly through menus. You push down on the knob when you reach your selection. Smaller buttons with menu headings surround the central knob for fast access to the most used features.\n\nIn the backseat, my kids appreciated their dedicated perks: climate controls, seatback pockets (often used as a target in backseat foot-and-leg exercises rather than for storing things) and an armrest with integrated cupholders. All of these items have become routine check points on their list of second-row must-haves.\n\nThe rear seats don’t fold down, but the Genesis does have a center pass-through for longer items. My kids got a kick out of the pass-through door behind the center armrest. They’re always so tempted to play around with these doors that I must confess I’ve warned them not to open the door because doing so would free the monsters lurking in the trunk!\n\nSpeaking of which, the trunk is large with lots of extras like tie-down hooks and cargo nets. It’d be no problem hauling loads of groceries or even skis, golf clubs or scary gremlins in this cavernous space.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSafety\n\nSafety wasn’t overlooked in the Genesis’ drive to conquer the competition. It received crash-test ratings of Good from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, which when combined with its standard stability control, makes it a 2009 Top Safety Pick. The Genesis also scored five stars in National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s crash tests. This is like getting a score of 100 percent on the most important exam of your life.\n\nThe Genesis also scored well in my own real-life test with my children’s booster seats. There’s some bolstering back there, but it didn’t interfere too much with the booster seats’ fit. The Latch connectors are also easy to find, and there’s tons of legroom, which would make it easy to fit a rear-facing infant-safety seat back there.\n\nWith eight airbags, including side-impact and side curtain airbags for both rows, and standard antilock brakes with electronic brake-force distribution and brake assist, traction control and active head restraints for the front seats, Hyundai sends the message that safety shouldn’t be optional. This mom thinks Genesis should definitely be on each families test-drive list.\n\nFAMILY LIFESTAGE\n\nIn Diapers: The Latch connectors are easy to reach, and there’s plenty of room for rear-facing infant-safety seats.\n\nIn School: Older kids could get used to the good life with this car’s backseat climate controls, easy-to-reach cupholders and seatback pockets.\n\nTeens: With plenty of airbags and lots of standard safety features, this is a great car for teen drivers if they can get the keys away from their parents.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in January 2012 about the 2012 Hyundai Genesis. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2013, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nEven though the 2012 Hyundai Genesis sedan wasn’t built explicitly for family duty, it’s one of those rare cars that’s smooth and seamless for a family of five to live with on a day-to-day basis.\n\nThe 2012 Genesis has evolved only slightly since last year’s model. See the two compared here. While I drove the base 3.8-liter V-6 version, the Genesis is also available in 4.6-liter and 5.0-liter versions, as well as a 5.0-liter, performance-oriented R-Spec version. See them all compared side-by-side here.\n\nNote that the Genesis reviewed here shares its name with a sportier, more affordable Hyundai coupe, officially called the Genesis coupe. For details on that unrelated model, click here.\n\nEXTERIOR\nHyundai seems to have no problem referencing positive design cues from other manufacturers (That’s gentle terminology for “copycat.”) While others may think this type of borrowing is bold, I think it’s just plain smart. The Genesis has sleek, sloping exterior lines like a Mercedes-Benz, at a fraction of the price. It’s clean, modern and much more upscale-looking than its reasonable price tag (it starts at $34,200; my loaded test car was $43,035) would have you believe. Even my test car’s white satin pearl paint color looked expensive.\n\nFAMILY-FRIENDLY FEATURES\nThe Genesis’ low step-in height makes it easy for people of any age to get in and out easily. Beware, however, that tall people will obviously have to duck under the roofline while getting in. The interior isn’t intentionally family-oriented, but its clean lines help cut down on the visual and mental clutter that we parents suffer through on a regular basis. My test car was dressed in delicious-looking chocolate brown leather with wood accents. The dash sweeps from one side of the Genesis to the other with the smooth line of a polished river stone.\n\nBackseat passengers benefit from air vents stashed in the B-pillar between the front and rear doors, a rarity in most sedans. Rear passengers also have access to their own separate heat and air-conditioning controls, located at the rear of the center console. Standard heated seats for the driver and passenger, as well as optional heated outboard seats in the back, were upscale options in my test car that we appreciated during a cold snap. Cooled front seats are optional. The available moonroof opens up the interior of the cabin nicely, letting the light shine in on the rich chocolate interior.\n\nThere was plenty of legroom for my elementary-school-aged kids behind both the driver’s seat (pulled far enough forward to fit my 5-foot-3-inch frame) and even behind my husband’s passenger seat, pushed back to accommodate his extra foot of height over me.\n\nWhile the audio and optional navigation systems in the Genesis can be controlled by either the driver or the passenger using a toggle-like knob below the gearshift, I found that the available touch-screen controls were much more intuitive and did most of what I needed them to. If it were my choice, I’d do away with the redundancy and stick with the Mac-like, user-friendly touch-screen interface only.\n\nThere are two cupholders for the driver and passenger, plus two more in the center armrest in the backseat. There are no additional bottleholders in the doors, but small pockets in each door allowed me to stash and store a few extras, like my toll transponder and garage door opener. Pockets on the back of each of the front seats gave a little extra space for my girls to carry the stuff that’s important to them. (Though I could easily argue over the “importance” of five tubes of Lip Smackers lip gloss and an old wallet packed full of expired grocery store coupons, birthday party invitations and hotel room keys from my business trips.)\n\nThe elongated Genesis sedan creates a cavernous trunk area big enough for my family’s trip to Costco for bulk toilet paper, paper towels and two hormone-free roast chickens.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Puny — Fair\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove On): Groove On\n\nBEHIND THE WHEEL\nThe 2012 Hyundai Genesis is one of those rare cars that I looked forward to driving each morning, even on our family’s “Tuesday Driveathon” — all the usual to- and from-school driving, with the addition of dance team, ballet and piano practices after school thrown in for good measure. Sound mind-boggling? Try it in the Genesis and you’ll be willing to do it every day. Wait. Did I just type that out loud? Just for the record, I’m definitely not willing to do that every day.\n\nMy test car’s 333-horsepower, 3.8-liter V-6 engine had plenty of oomph for my taste and daily driving needs. My speed-needy husband commented that the style of this car seems to deserve a more powerful engine. He could have used one of those more powerful versions I mentioned earlier; see them all here.\n\nThe suspension in the Genesis is smooth without feeling overly floaty, and the steering is light and easy.\n\nThere were, however, a couple of days during my two-week test that I opted not to drive the Genesis; its rear-wheel drive and standard all-season tires didn’t exactly love Denver’s snow and ice.\n\nSAFETY\nThe Genesis sedan earned Top Safety Pick status from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, representing top scores in all of the organization’s crash tests.\n\nAs is required of all 2012 models, the Genesis sedan has standard antilock brakes, electronic stability control and traction control. Also standard are dual front airbags, seat-mounted side airbags for the front and outboard rear seats, and side curtain airbags for both rows. While I got plenty of use out of the optional lane departure warning, active cruise control and backup camera in my test car, I was surprised that this $40,000-plus Genesis didn’t come with a blind spot warning system.\n\nFor my three girls in the backseat, I had enough width to put my two younger ones (ages 7 and 9) in Bubble Bum booster seats, with more than enough space left over for my 11-year-old to sit comfortably. The two outboard seat belt buckles in the backseat are on stable bases, so it’s easy for older kids to buckle up on their own. However, since they’re more or less flush with the bottom cushion, younger children may need assistance reaching down to get buckled while in their booster seats. The center buckle is on a short strap that makes it difficult for younger children to hold it stable with one hand while trying to insert the buckle with the other hand. Securing child-safety seats using Latch anchors is also a challenge in the Genesis, as the lower anchors are buried tightly in the seat bight.\n\nSee the Genesis’ standard safety features listed here.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in July 2008 about the 2009 Hyundai Genesis. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2010, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nHyundai’s all-new Genesis is unlike any car the Korean automaker has brought to the U.S. before. It’s a rear-wheel-drive full-size sedan that’s available with Hyundai’s first V-8 engine in a passenger car. After driving the car extensively in and around Santa Barbara, Calif., it’s clear to me that Hyundai got most of the important elements right: The driving experience and the cabin’s ambience and amenities are all there.\n\nWhat’s less certain is whether buyers will be accepting of a Hyundai — a brand better known for small, affordable cars — with a starting price of $32,250, even though that price includes a number of standard safety and convenience features. It’s going to be difficult, but it helps that Hyundai has a remarkable first effort on its hands in the Genesis.\n\nStyling\nMost of Hyundai’s models fall on the bland side of things where styling is concerned, but the automaker has taken a couple chances with its new flagship sedan. The first of these is the lack of Hyundai’s “H” badge on the grille, which instead features a winged design not seen on other Hyundais in the U.S. Though the symbol’s absence here (there is one on the trunklid) misses an opportunity to tell onlookers that the Genesis is a Hyundai, the flip side is that it might intrigue large-sedan shoppers and prompt them to take a closer look. Based on the car’s sleek, stylish appearance overall, I suspect many who investigate further will be impressed with what they see.\n\nThough the Genesis doesn’t blaze any new trails in terms of design, it does possess an athletic look for a large car, and it’s also well-proportioned, which seems like one of those basic design qualities that can get left behind sometimes. The Genesis has a timeless elegance.\n\nRide & Handling\nHyundai positions the Genesis as a performance sedan, and I admit I was skeptical as to whether or not the automaker was willing to do what it takes to truly deliver a sport-sedan experience. Having driven the sedan on a variety of roads, I’m now able to report that Hyundai has backed up its talk with a true performer.\n\nGiving the Genesis a rear-wheel-drive platform — as opposed to a front-wheel-drive one like the full-size Hyundai Azera and Toyota Avalon — was one of the first right moves Hyundai made; the superior dynamics afforded by RWD were eminently apparent on winding mountain roads. The Genesis navigates tight corners like a much smaller car — body roll is well checked and the balanced chassis encourages you to push it harder. The Azera, in comparison, offers softer responses when traveling on undulating roads; it’s more of a cruiser, whereas the Genesis is a carver.\n\nAlong with this sporty performance comes a ride that’s definitely more taut than most Hyundais. The four-wheel independent suspension, which features a five-link setup in front and back, is sensitive to pavement imperfections, transmitting the pockmarks of the road up to the cabin. This was on mostly smooth California roads, too, which were in much better shape than the ones I normally drive in Chicago.\n\nWhere the Genesis differs from a number of other performance sedans is that its steering effort is fairly light; it doesn’t take much exertion to turn the wheel. It spins with impressive smoothness and has a consistency across its range of motion that lets you follow a curve with precision. Personally, I would have liked a little less power assistance in the steering, but many people will buy the Genesis more for its value-oriented luxury than for its handling prowess, so I can understand why Hyundai tuned it the way it did.\n\nV-8 Performance\nHyundai’s first production V-8, which goes in Genesis 4.6 trim levels, is a powerful engine, much like the 380-horsepower, 4.6-liter V-8 in the Lexus LS 460. It has the same displacement as that Lexus V-8 and makes nearly as much power: 375 hp when using premium gas (368 hp on regular). The V-8 powers effortlessly up hills and allows the car to build speed quickly; I looked down at the speedometer one time and was surprised to find I was going almost 90 mph. All this power wouldn’t be worth much if accompanied by any harshness or vibration, but the V-8 is impressively smooth and refined, just like the Lexus V-8.\n\nJoining Hyundai’s V-8 is an equally good six-speed automatic transmission. It’s manufactured by ZF, which also supplies BMW, and includes a clutchless-manual mode for driver-controlled shifts.\n\nThe automatic shifts smoothly and feels well-matched to the V-8. It’s also easy to control downshifts using your right foot — depressing the gas pedal will make the transmission kick down for a quick pass around a slower-moving car.\n\nV-6 Performance\nThough the new V-8 is big news for Hyundai, the automaker expects 80 percent of Genesis sedans sold to have the standard 3.8-liter V-6, which goes in 3.8 models. This V-6 isn’t new (it’s optional in the Azera), but it produces more power in the Genesis than it does in other Hyundais: 290 hp.\n\nThe V-6 feels plenty strong, if not quite as powerful as the potent V-8, and like the larger engine it can power the sedan to excessive speeds before you know it. The V-6 also works with a six-speed automatic, though this one is manufactured by Aisin. Like the automatic in the V-8 sedan, it’s responsive and smooth.\n\nWhen it comes to gas mileage, the V-6 has a slight advantage over the V-8; it’s rated at 18/27 mpg city/highway while the V-8 gets 17/25 mpg.\n\nThe Inside\nGenesis occupants are treated to an upscale cabin that features premium materials, like an optional leather dashboard, and a high level of fit and finish. I prefer the look of the base dashboard and its simulated wood trim, but regardless of which way you go it’s clear Hyundai looked to the standard in the luxury segment — the Mercedes-Benz S-Class. The similarities between the dashboards are undeniable. When cruising, it’s also very quiet inside.\n\nLike the S-Class, the Genesis is available with a multifunction control knob that operates the audio and navigation systems. BMW started this trend with its iDrive system, and Audi and Mercedes latched onto the concept, introducing their own systems. Even though they offer varying degrees of user-friendliness — with BMW’s iDrive near the bottom and Mercedes’ Comand near the top — all of them are supplied by Harman/Becker, according to Roger Shively, a chief engineer with the supplier. Fortunately, Hyundai’s system is like Mercedes’ in that its menus are more intuitive. The graphics are also very crisp.\n\nThe Genesis’ front bucket seats are finished in standard leather upholstery, and I found them to be quite comfortable for a day of driving. They offer good thigh support and enough side bolstering to keep you situated during aggressive driving without being restrictive. Three-stage heated front seats are standard, and a cooled driver’s seat is optional. Backseat passengers also enjoy spacious accommodations, particularly when it comes to legroom. Even taller adults might be pleasantly surprised by how much room there is.\n\nCargo\nThe Genesis’ trunk measures 15.9 cubic feet. This is slightly smaller than the Hyundai Sonata’s 16.3-cubic-foot trunk, but it’s larger than the Avalon’s 14.4-cubic-foot trunk and the Chrysler 300’s 15.6-cubic-foot cargo area. Unlike the 300, the Genesis doesn’t have a split-folding backseat, but it does come with a trunk pass-thru for carrying long items inside the car.\n\nSafety\nThe long list of standard safety features includes antilock brakes, side-impact airbags for the front and outboard rear seats, side curtain airbags, an electronic stability system and active front head restraints.\n\nCrash-test results for the Genesis weren’t available at time of publication but will be added here when the sedan has been tested.\n\nFeatures\nThe base 3.8 trim is priced at $32,250 and features 17-inch alloy wheels, dual-zone automatic air conditioning, cruise control, power front seats, keyless entry and starting, a leather-covered steering wheel, and a seven-speaker audio system with both a USB port for controlling an iPod through the system as well as an auxiliary input jack for plugging in any type of portable music player.\n\nBesides the V-8 engine, 4.6 models, which are listed at $37,250, gain 18-inch alloy wheels, rain-sensing wipers, a leather-covered dash, a power rear sunshade, a moonroof, a power tilt/telescoping steering wheel, a memory feature for the driver, higher-grade leather seats and a six-CD Lexicon stereo with 14 speakers.\n\nGreater levels of content are available in option packages. For $2,000, the Premium Package for the 3.8 trim level adds all of the 4.6 features mentioned above except the upgraded leather seats and 18-inch wheels. For $3,000, the Premium Package Plus builds on the Premium Package by adding 18-inch wheels to the list of features.\n\nThe Technology Package is a $4,000 option that’s available for both models, though it requires the selection of the Premium Package Plus group with the 3.8. It includes a Lexicon surround-sound system with 17 speakers, a knob-controlled navigation system, a backup camera, front and rear parking sensors, adaptive xenon headlights and a cooled driver’s seat.\n\nGenesis in the Market\nYou’ll pay a little more for the Genesis, but it outpaces mainstream competitors like the 300 and Avalon in many respects. However, it should also put more expensive competitors like the Mercedes-Benz E-Class and BMW 5 Series — models Hyundai said it benchmarked when developing the Genesis — on notice because it can keep up with them in some areas, too. In the end, the Genesis is yet another example of Hyundai doing what it does best: bringing value to a segment of the market, in this case the luxury sedan segment.\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "A complete redesign of the car that won Cars.com’s first-ever “Best of” award in 2009, the 2015 Hyundai Genesis is now even closer on the heels of more expensive luxury car competitors, but it’s not without shortcomings.\n\nAs before, the Genesis is technically full size, but Hyundai positions it against nominally midsize sedans like the BMW 5 Series, Cadillac CTS, Mercedes-Benz E-Class and Lexus GS 350 — and prices it to undercut them all (see key competitors side by side here).\n\nVersions still include the base Hyundai Genesis 3.8 (named for its 3.8-liter V-6 engine) and the Genesis 5.0, which has a 5.0-liter V-8, both with rear-wheel drive. Like the Jaguar XF, another competitor, the Genesis newly adds an all-wheel-drive option available solely with a V-6. This option is common among competitors.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe 2015 Hyundai Genesis’ exterior size is practically unchanged, but the wheelbase has increased almost 3 inches, which is a lot for this dimension. Despite the extension, the car’s turning circle remains impressively tight at just over 38 feet, a bit better than body-type competitors. (Compare the 2014 and 2015 Genesis’ specifications side by side here.)\n\nThe earlier Genesis was criticized for aping the Mercedes S-Class, but I always thought it looked handsome enough. The 2015 has a new, grille-dominated nose that makes it more distinctive and in line with Hyundai’s latest design direction. It still has a prominent winged Genesis badge on the hood. Unfortunately, the rear end seems to have received little attention. It’s just sort of … there.\n\nHow It Drives\nMy overwhelming impression is that the 3.8 is a better-driving car than the 5.0. Though it boasts 420 horsepower, the 5.0-liter V-8 never felt like it was hustling the car and pressing me into the seat like its V-8 competitors do. The 3.8, though it’s rated 311 hp, has 293 pounds-feet of torque (versus 383 pounds-feet in the V-8) and meets expectations better as a V-6 car — even with the extra weight of all-wheel drive. The Genesis’ estimated fuel economy — 22 mpg combined for the rear-wheel-drive 3.8, 19 mpg combined for the all-wheel-drive 3.8, and 18 mpg for the 5.0 — trails most competitors.\n\nAlso contrary to common experience, the 8-speed automatic transmission behaves better with the less-powerful engine, exhibiting less hesitation when shifting down for passing power. The V-6 even sounds better than the V-8, again turning expectations upside down. It’s not that the V-8 sounds bad, but it’s clearly tuned for quiet rather than a performance sound. Though one of our editors praised the 5.0’s smooth power, the others agreed the 3.8 is a better car of its type.\n\nRide quality is good in both cars, but it’s definitely better in the 5.0, with optional adaptive shock absorbers, a new addition to the model. Unfortunately, the suspension’s firmness setting changes only with the overall driving modes of Normal, Eco and Sport. These modes also affect the transmission behavior, accelerator response and power-steering assist level. I’d much prefer independent control of some or all of these systems, or at minimum a configurable umbrella mode that lets me choose the settings that suit me, as Audi and some others allow.\n\nThe cars both handle reasonably well, with notably good steering-wheel weighting over a range of speeds. The front-to-rear weight distribution is good, a bit more evenly balanced with the V-6. The Hyundai Genesis is capable but not exceptionally sporty. It’s fine with me. It leans more toward Lexus than the German competitors, and that means comfort. Many cars in this class try a little too hard to be sporty at the expense of comfort.\n\nInterior\nThe interior quality is good, certainly enough so to surprise a consumer who hasn’t been in a Hyundai lately, especially its lesser-known luxury model. But there are inconsistencies: The hood over the instrument panel is upholstered, but the rest of the top of the dashboard reverts to typical soft plastic. There’s a half-dozen different textures, not all of which seem to go together. There’s real aluminum trim, yet somehow it doesn’t look convincing; perhaps a brushed finish would be more effective and hide smudges better. There’s semi-gloss wood trim with an open-pore finish, but its aesthetic really depends on the color. I like the lighter execution, but from my perspective in the driver’s seat of a car with the darker trim, the section immediately below the touch-screen looked like it had been sneezed upon (it had not).\n\nAlthough the Hyundai Genesis is very comfortable overall, I’d like to see more headroom in the backseat. At 6 feet tall I was fine, but the roof curls down pretty close to the doors and was a problem for passengers taller than I, at least when getting in and out. While the optional panoramic moonroof diminishes front headroom, the dimension remains the same in the backseat whether the moonroof is there or not. As for legroom, my knees cleared the front seatbacks by a healthy margin, but the seat sits relatively close to the floor, which raised them more than I’d like. Foot room under the front seats for stretching one’s legs forward is only so-so, and the center floor hump is high, a common shortcoming in rear-wheel-drive sedans.\n\nThe hushed V-8 makes the 5.0 even more exceptionally quiet than the 3.8, which apart from the engine sound itself is equally vaultlike, both in its noise level and rigidity. Hyundai claims better structural rigidity ratings than competitors, and it feels that way on the road.\n\nIn the 5.0 equipped with 19-inch wheels, the predominant sound was the occasional thrum and pitter-patter of tires on the mostly healthy pavement around Phoenix. At high speeds and in strong crosswinds there was some wind noise about the A-pillars, but my impression was that it stood out only because of the overall quietness. The standard 18-inch wheels on the 3.8 sounded a little quieter over expansion joints and such, but louder on coarse pavement.\n\nBetween the quiet, comfortable ride and seats, I ended a day of driving almost 300 miles with no fatigue. The only other time I experienced this, over some of the same roads in Arizona, was in a Rolls Royce. No joke.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nOne of the Genesis’ high points is its multimedia and control system, which starts with a generously sized 8-inch touch-screen and standard navigation, and can be upgraded to a stellar high-definition 9.2-inch touch-screen. The optional screen’s size is simply fantastic, larger than Chrysler vehicles’ 8.4-inch Uconnect display. It combines my favorite interface — a touch-screen — with a well-placed multifunction knob that’s easily in reach on the center console for people who prefer that means of control. Even better, there isn’t a single capacitive touch-sensitive panel in the car. All real mechanical buttons and knobs. Hurray!\n\nThe new optional system features Apple Siri integration and is compatible with Pandora, SoundHound and Aha internet radio smartphone apps. A SiriusXM subscription provides satellite radio, traffic information, sports scores, stock values, movie times, fuel prices and weather alerts. The basics — Bluetooth wireless connectivity and USB and analog audio jacks — are standard. If that seems a given when you can get the same in practically any entry-level car these days, take a closer look at the luxury class … .\n\nThe Genesis now offers a head-up display that shows a wealth of information on the windshield ahead of the driver, but it vanishes entirely if you wear polarized sunglasses. Though this is a common drawback of these displays, I’ve recently driven two GM vehicles that had mitigated the problem: The display appeared orange through my polarized lenses, but it remained perfectly usable.\n\nThe ’15 Genesis heralds the debut of Hyundai’s second-generation Blue Link communications system, which now supports voice-recognition-driven destination search supported by Google. The remote-start option now lets the owner determine how long the engine runs (1-10 minutes), stop the engine remotely, and adjust the climate control and defroster. Unfortunately it still doesn’t activate the available heated seats.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe Hyundai Genesis’ large exterior pays off in generous trunk volume: 15.3 cubic feet versus 14.0 in the 528i, 13.7 in the CTS sedan and 14.3 cubic feet in the GS 350. The opening is very wide and the trunk’s shape is truly accommodating. There’s even a swing-down T-hook for holding onto grocery bags and the like. Unfortunately, the Genesis has only a pass-through rather than a folding backseat. This tradeoff is common among full-size luxury sedans, but some of the Genesis’ stated competitors have folding backseats, at least as an option, including the BMW and Cadillac.\n\nSafety\nThe 2015 Hyundai Genesis’ stellar performance in all Insurance Institute for Highway Safety tests earned it the organization’s highest designation: Top Safety Pick Plus. It earned not simply qualifying scores, but the top score of good in all crashworthiness tests, plus a rating of superior for front crash prevention when equipped with optional safety features.\n\nThe main feature in question provides forward-collision warning and both low- and high-speed autonomous braking, optional on the 3.8 and standard on the 5.0. Other safety options include lane keep assist and blind spot warning, with an enhancement called Lane Change Assist that “looks” farther behind the car than the typical system of this type “to help detect vehicles approaching towards its rear side at high speeds, especially during higher-speed driving,” as Hyundai describes it. Unfortunately, in my experience this last feature merely provided more unnecessary alerts during lane-change maneuvers: After passing other cars at a substantial speed differential, when I signaled to pull into their lane, Lane Change Assist would beep away. The feature should be smart enough to know I’m pulling away from the other car and not pester me. The lane-related features also employ a vibrating steering-wheel alert. I like tactile warnings because they minimize all the beeping, but vibey steering is never effective in my opinion. All in all, new features are good, but execution matters.\n\nThe Blue Link system provides SOS assistance and automatic collision notification, and can now notify emergency contacts, pre-selected by the owner, via text and email.\n\nThe Genesis’ standard safety features are listed here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nDespite its low starting price, the Genesis sedan comes with some standard features not found in all competitors, most notably leather upholstery. The 528i and CTS are two that have imitation leather standard. Also, thanks to its low price, the Genesis can be loaded up with features and remain competitive with the other guys’ entry vehicles. On the downside, the Genesis’ features are mostly bundled into packages ranging from $4,000-$11,000 rather than being available a la carte.\n\nThough the Hyundai Genesis sedan is all new, its greatest challenge is an old one: It attempts to compete against luxury vehicles from luxury brands. Part of the value among luxury vehicles is the brand cachet — something that varies broadly in the minds of consumers and can’t be quantified in the best of circumstances. Even so, Hyundai is a maker of modestly priced vehicles, and though its quality and reputation as such have soared, there’s a reason Toyota has Lexus, Nissan has Infiniti and GM has a dedicated luxury brand and dealer network: It really is necessary to command top dollar.\n\nAs has been the case since Hyundai launched its luxury trial balloon, the XG300, in 2001, the 2015 Genesis is very much a luxurious car at an affordable price for anyone who cares more about the vehicle than the badge.\n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nIntroduced for 2009, Hyundai’s Genesis full-size sedan aims at established luxury cars like the BMW 5 Series and Mercedes-Benz E-Class with its rear-wheel-drive layout, available V-8 power and upscale features. Other primary competitors include the Buick Lucerne, Chrysler 300 and Toyota Avalon.\n\nThe Hyundai Genesis Coupe, a sportier variant built on the same rear-drive platform, is covered in a separate report in the Cars.com Research section.\n\nNew for 2011\nThe V-8 engine standard in the Genesis 4.6 gains 10 horsepower to 385, and last year’s optional Technology Package is now standard on the Genesis 4.6. Among features now standard on the 4.6 as a result are the navigation system, a 17-speaker surround sound audio system, adaptive high-intensity-discharge headlights and a backup camera.\n\nExterior\nThe Genesis doesn’t break new ground with its exterior styling, but it manages to look upscale, if a bit conservative. The headlights are angular, like Lexus’, and when viewed from the side, the sedan brings to mind the Infiniti M and BMW 5 Series. Exterior features include:\n\n\n17- or 18-inch wheels are available\nAvailable adaptive headlights that swivel in the direction of turns\nStandard heated mirrors\nStandard fog lights\nOptional lower bodyside moldings\n\nInterior\nThe influence of the luxury segment can be seen in the design of the Genesis’ cabin. The middle of the dash bulges outward like the one on the Mercedes-Benz S-Class. Hyundai has picked up on the German luxury brands’ fascination with integrated control knobs with a system that’s used to operate the available navigation system, among other things. Interior features include:\n\n\nStandard XM Satellite Radio and Bluetooth cell phone connectivity\nAvailable heated and cooled driver’s seat\nAvailable leather dashboard\nAvailable power sunshade\n\nUnder the Hood\nGenesis buyers have the choice of a V-6 or V-8 engine. The Genesis is rear-wheel drive. Regular gas is recommended for the V-6, but premium is recommended for the V-8. Both engines use a six-speed automatic transmission. Mechanical features include:\n\n\n290-horsepower, 3.8-liter V-6 that makes 264 pounds-feet of torque\n385-hp, 4.6-liter V-8 that makes 333 pounds-feet of torque\nSport-tuned suspension\n\nSafety\nStandard features include:\n\n\nAntilock brakes with electronic brake-force distribution and brake assist\nElectronic stability system\nSide-impact airbags for the front and rear seats\nSide curtain airbags and front active head restraints\nOptional front and rear parking sensors and a backup camera",

      "expert_review": "Even though the 2012 Hyundai Genesis sedan wasn’t built explicitly for family duty, it’s one of those rare cars that’s smooth and seamless for a family of five to live with on a day-to-day basis.\n\nThe 2012 Genesis has evolved only slightly since last year’s model. See the two compared here. While I drove the base 3.8-liter V-6 version, the Genesis is also available in 4.6-liter and 5.0-liter versions, as well as a 5.0-liter, performance-oriented R-Spec version. See them all compared side-by-side here.\n\nNote that the Genesis reviewed here shares its name with a sportier, more affordable Hyundai coupe, officially called the Genesis coupe. For details on that unrelated model, click here.\n\nEXTERIOR\nHyundai seems to have no problem referencing positive design cues from other manufacturers (That’s gentle terminology for “copycat.”) While others may think this type of borrowing is bold, I think it’s just plain smart. The Genesis has sleek, sloping exterior lines like a Mercedes-Benz, at a fraction of the price. It’s clean, modern and much more upscale-looking than its reasonable price tag (it starts at $34,200; my loaded test car was $43,035) would have you believe. Even my test car’s white satin pearl paint color looked expensive.\n\nFAMILY-FRIENDLY FEATURES\nThe Genesis’ low step-in height makes it easy for people of any age to get in and out easily. Beware, however, that tall people will obviously have to duck under the roofline while getting in. The interior isn’t intentionally family-oriented, but its clean lines help cut down on the visual and mental clutter that we parents suffer through on a regular basis. My test car was dressed in delicious-looking chocolate brown leather with wood accents. The dash sweeps from one side of the Genesis to the other with the smooth line of a polished river stone.\n\nBackseat passengers benefit from air vents stashed in the B-pillar between the front and rear doors, a rarity in most sedans. Rear passengers also have access to their own separate heat and air-conditioning controls, located at the rear of the center console. Standard heated seats for the driver and passenger, as well as optional heated outboard seats in the back, were upscale options in my test car that we appreciated during a cold snap. Cooled front seats are optional. The available moonroof opens up the interior of the cabin nicely, letting the light shine in on the rich chocolate interior.\n\nThere was plenty of legroom for my elementary-school-aged kids behind both the driver’s seat (pulled far enough forward to fit my 5-foot-3-inch frame) and even behind my husband’s passenger seat, pushed back to accommodate his extra foot of height over me.\n\nWhile the audio and optional navigation systems in the Genesis can be controlled by either the driver or the passenger using a toggle-like knob below the gearshift, I found that the available touch-screen controls were much more intuitive and did most of what I needed them to. If it were my choice, I’d do away with the redundancy and stick with the Mac-like, user-friendly touch-screen interface only.\n\nThere are two cupholders for the driver and passenger, plus two more in the center armrest in the backseat. There are no additional bottleholders in the doors, but small pockets in each door allowed me to stash and store a few extras, like my toll transponder and garage door opener. Pockets on the back of each of the front seats gave a little extra space for my girls to carry the stuff that’s important to them. (Though I could easily argue over the “importance” of five tubes of Lip Smackers lip gloss and an old wallet packed full of expired grocery store coupons, birthday party invitations and hotel room keys from my business trips.)\n\nThe elongated Genesis sedan creates a cavernous trunk area big enough for my family’s trip to Costco for bulk toilet paper, paper towels and two hormone-free roast chickens.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Puny — Fair\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove On): Groove On\n\nBEHIND THE WHEEL\nThe 2012 Hyundai Genesis is one of those rare cars that I looked forward to driving each morning, even on our family’s “Tuesday Driveathon” — all the usual to- and from-school driving, with the addition of dance team, ballet and piano practices after school thrown in for good measure. Sound mind-boggling? Try it in the Genesis and you’ll be willing to do it every day. Wait. Did I just type that out loud? Just for the record, I’m definitely not willing to do that every day.\n\nMy test car’s 333-horsepower, 3.8-liter V-6 engine had plenty of oomph for my taste and daily driving needs. My speed-needy husband commented that the style of this car seems to deserve a more powerful engine. He could have used one of those more powerful versions I mentioned earlier; see them all here.\n\nThe suspension in the Genesis is smooth without feeling overly floaty, and the steering is light and easy.\n\nThere were, however, a couple of days during my two-week test that I opted not to drive the Genesis; its rear-wheel drive and standard all-season tires didn’t exactly love Denver’s snow and ice.\n\nSAFETY\nThe Genesis sedan earned Top Safety Pick status from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, representing top scores in all of the organization’s crash tests.\n\nAs is required of all 2012 models, the Genesis sedan has standard antilock brakes, electronic stability control and traction control. Also standard are dual front airbags, seat-mounted side airbags for the front and outboard rear seats, and side curtain airbags for both rows. While I got plenty of use out of the optional lane departure warning, active cruise control and backup camera in my test car, I was surprised that this $40,000-plus Genesis didn’t come with a blind spot warning system.\n\nFor my three girls in the backseat, I had enough width to put my two younger ones (ages 7 and 9) in Bubble Bum booster seats, with more than enough space left over for my 11-year-old to sit comfortably. The two outboard seat belt buckles in the backseat are on stable bases, so it’s easy for older kids to buckle up on their own. However, since they’re more or less flush with the bottom cushion, younger children may need assistance reaching down to get buckled while in their booster seats. The center buckle is on a short strap that makes it difficult for younger children to hold it stable with one hand while trying to insert the buckle with the other hand. Securing child-safety seats using Latch anchors is also a challenge in the Genesis, as the lower anchors are buried tightly in the seat bight.\n\nSee the Genesis’ standard safety features listed here.\n\nemail",
