      "expert_review": "The car that Hyundai Motors should have built before now is the 1992 Hyundai Elantra.\n\nA step up from the base Hyundai Excel, the Elantra represents new priorities at Hyundai Motors, and some new possibilities.\n\nThe automobile moves upstream without going off the deep end on price. It also broadens Hyundai’s marketing structure. The Elantra is slotted between the Excel and Hyundai Sonata.\n\nThe new model has improved performance courtesy of a dual-cam, 16-valve, four-cylinder engine. And some quarters, including this one, consider it better looking.\n\n“It has a European styling theme to it,” said Jim Webb, general sales manager for Butler Hyundai-Suzuki. “The lines are aerodynamic, and so far our customers keep telling us it’s a good-looking car.”\n\nThe sedan is a classic example of form fitting function. Curving exterior surfaces are designed for low co-efficient of drag. In simpler terms, the automobile slips through the air.\n\nThe model’s conception dates back to 1987 when Hyundai’s management decided to target a vehicle for the rapidly expanding compact market. The company sought to provide a balance among performance, stying, economy and comfort/convenience features.\n\nCompact can carry 5\n\nThe four-door can carry five passengers, but two adults in the back seat are going to be a lot more comfortable than three.\n\nThe wheelbase is 98.4 inches and the overall length 171.6 inches. But the interior design is such that there is decent if not sumptuous legroom and headroom.\n\nThe Elantra’s performance is a step below the Sonata because the Sonata’s engine has a 2.0-liter (122-cubic-inch) 16-valver. You can’t beat inches.\n\nThe Elantra’s engine is 1.6 liters (96 cubic inches), but in manual five-speed transmission form there is 113 horsepower to propel but 2,524 pounds of weight. That is a respectable power-to-weight ratio.\n\n‘The Elantras I’ve driven have handled well and performed well,” said Cliff Alley, sales manager for Dave McIntire Hyundai-Isuzu. “It’s a car that Hyundai should have built before the Sonata. They recognize that now.”\n\nGLS is upscale version\n\nThe model comes in standard and GLS form, with the GLS constituting the upscale styling of the line. Here, accommodations are first class, with features like power accessories, deluxe full-cloth upholstery, stereo cassette, and supplementary interior lighting standard.\n\nThe other side of this picture is that as you go upstream in appointments and trim you also go upstream in price.\n\nThe Butler, McIntire, and Tom Wood agencies that represent Hyundai in Indianapolis have in the Elantra an automobile with a price spread of approximately $3,000.\n\n“The entry-level vehicle is $8,999,” Webb said. “And from there you can go on up to about $12,000 if you get everything they make.”\n\nOptions include air conditioning, four-speed automatic transmission and a compact-disc player.\n\nThe automatic is offered as a convenience to the family driver who is not all that interested in pl aying a tune on the five-speed gearbox. However, with 1.6 liters putting out 113 horsepower through an automatic, acceleration is going to be compromised when the air conditioner is operating.\n\nThe basic layout of the Elantra follows well-established design parameters.\n\nEngine mounted transversely\n\nThe engine is mounted transversely in front for maximum cabin space. All four wheels are independently sprung, with the rear suspension utilizing a multilink system for road stability. It has front-wheel drive. Instrumentation and operating controls are similar to those of most domestic and import automobile manufacturers.\n\nOverall, it results in a car that quickly becomes user friendly.\n\n“Our customer reaction has been quite positive,” Alley said. “They seem to take to it from the first time they sit behind the wheel.”\n\nHyundai expects Elantra buyers to be split almost evenly between male and female owners.\n\nModel has competitors\n\nThe car is being dropped ri ght square in the middle of the auto industry’s most competitive segment, one in which a new model tends to pirate from sister models rather than competitive makes.\n\nBut Webb said, “I believe the standard Excel still will be the big seller, and the Elantra will just expand the Hyundai line.”\n\nIn competing with contemporary vehicles like the Toyota Corolla, Nissan Sentra, Ford Escort and Saturn SL, the Elantra has its work cut out for it. But Hyundai now has five years of experience in competing on the American market, and is offering a two-year/24,000-mile no-cost normal-maintenance program for the car.\n\n“All you have to do is put gas in it,” Alley said.",

      "expert_review": "Few of the cars which have had a GT label applied to them have really been Grand Touring machines, so I can’t kvetch too much about Hyundai misappropriating the designator – big time.\n\nThe Elantra GT is hardly a vehicle in which you’d want to spend a great deal of time devouring long distances.\n\nBut it is a car which should strike fear in the hearts of competitors, not so much for what it is, but for what it augurs about the major Korean manufacturer’s ability to contain costs while producing a desirable product.\n\nGiven its price point and execution, it is truly one which exceeds expectations, in all but one crucial area.\n\nIntroduced for the 2002 model year, the Elantra GT is based on the same platform used to support the sedan GLS, introduced at the turn of the millennium. But instead of being a mere cosmetic variant, it is a fundamentally different model. If logic were the persuasive force in auto buying decisions, the sedans would languish on dealer lots, now that the new series is available.\n\nFor a bit more than a thousand-dollar premium, selecting the GT gets you many advantages over the sedan: a “European” suspension with gas-filled shocks and larger anti-roll bars front and rear, a new power steering pump for the rack-and-pinion aiming mechanism, and Michelin tires on alloy wheels. It also has leather seating (you read right!), air conditioning, power steering, windows and door locks, AM-FM-CD stereo and fog lamps, as well as new side air bags.\n\nMost importantly, perhaps, in a right-brain sort of way, it gets you a fifth door, in the form of a hatch, once the hallmark of econoboxes but now making a comeback as a desirable extra. With the new configuration, you get 28.3 cubic feet of cargo volume vs. the 12.9 afforded by the trunk of the sedan. Passenger volume remains the same, 94 cubic feet, which puts the Elantra GT squarely in the Environmental Protection Agency’s compact territory.\n\nSettling a frame designed for large cars into position behind the wheel of the Elantra, I did not feel unduly constrained, after some fiddling with the six-way manually adjustable driver’s seat, which I found I did not need to push fully rearward. With such giving people in front, a couple of adults could manage in the rear for club-hopping, but they wouldn’t want to make a Grand Tour. Three small kids would look as cute back there as anchovies in the can. The seat of course folds down, 60-40.\n\nThe Elantra is propelled by a 2-liter aluminum-and-cast-iron four-banger. Nothing too trick here, but with 16 valves it makes a respectable 140 hp at 6,000 rpm, 133 foot-pounds of torque at 4,800.\n\nLacking such trickery as multiple intake paths or variable valve-and-camshaft timing, the engine shows considerably more enthusiasm around 5,000 rpm than it does farther down, but it slogged at 2,500 without undue complaining or bucking.\n\nThe car I tested was equipped with the standard 5-speed manual transmission, which I daresay would be a better match for this peaky powerplant than the available four-speed automatic.\n\nThe 5-speed was quite acceptable for this price class, neither a delight to operate nor an impediment to wringing the engine. The clutch was fairly light and easily feathered.\n\nThe power was sufficient to make this 2,635-pound car feel peppy, and it ran from 0-60 in just under nine seconds, with deft clutch engagement and plenty of revs.\n\nThe five forward ratios seemed apt, and the final drive cog was 3.65:1, giving the Elantra plenty of mechanical advantage. It runs 23 mph per 1,000 rpm in overdrive fifth. At 70, then, it was running at three grand and became a bit boomy; the engine gets raucous when pushed toward the 6,500 redline.\n\nEPA estimates – 87-octane fuel, of course – are 25 mpg city, 33 highway. I logged 26.7, and that was on winding country roads with the hammer down.\n\nThe GT’s Michelins are of a decent size, at 195/60/15, and they had very good grip on both wet and dry pavement. The Elantra, despite its diminutive dimensions, felt quite stable running through some heavy standing water.\n\nThe GT, as noted, gets rear discs instead of the sedan’s drum brakes. Both front and rear are 10.1 inches, a generous size for the weight class. They showed no fade, and were very good at ignoring moisture.\n\nHyundai had to hold back a little, and they did so by making antilock optional. Nonetheless, the car behaved quite respectably when I tried some pseudo-panic stops on both wet and dry macadam. I scold Hyundai for making antilock available only as part of a $1,000 package, which also includes a power moonroof and traction control.\n\nI wouldn’t describe the steering as crisp, but it is light, reasonably fast, and showed good self-centering response when exiting a turn. Rolling down the freeway, the Elantra found its way without excessive correction. As always, I would have appreciated more tilt in the steering wheel.\n\nRide quality was decent, especially in light of the truncated 102.7-inch wheelbase and so-called European suspension. The twin sway bars kept roll well in check, and the springs and shocks were well tuned to provide impact-damping without either extreme, of jiggle or mushiness.\n\nThe basic four instruments are unusually large and extremely legible, red needles playing against a lovely indigo-lighted background.\n\nAir conditioner and radio controls are accessible and uncluttered.\n\nThe stereo is of a fairly basic type, with only bass and treble tweakers to modify its output, but was nonetheless eminently listenable – far better than I expected in both tonality and tuner sensitivity.\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has crash-tested the Elantra sedan with side air bags, close enough in this case to venture some inferences.\n\nIn NHTSA’s 35-mph frontal barrier test, the Elantra GLS afforded a four-star level of protection to the driver, five-star shielding (the top mark) to the co-pilot. In side impacts, the front cabin rated five stars, the rear, four, a competitive score which shows compliance with federal standards.\n\nIt was a different story, though, when the Elantra GLS was subjected to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s more-demanding, though perhaps more realistic, 40-mph crash into an offset, deformable front barrier. The car rated poor overall, the worst rating they give. A seat latch failed, and the Institute said the frontal air bag deployed late, allowing the crash dummy to move around more than is desirable, hitting its head and injuring its legs. Hyundai disputed the initial test, so IIHS conducted two more, which it says just confirmed its earlier findings.\n\nThe institute rates the Elantra better than only the Kia Sephia in the class of small cars. Top marks went, in order, to the Subaru Impreza, Honda Civic, Mitsubishi Lancer and Volkswagen New Beetle. Ten other vehicles scored better t han the Elantra, including such plausible alternatives as the Ford Focus, VW Jetta and Golf, Toyota Corolla and Mazda Protege.\n\nManufacturer’s suggested on the Elantra GT with 5-speed manual is a palatable $13,999. The tester had carpeted floor mats ($78) and a trunk cargo net ($38). With freight, total asking price was $14,610. Payments on just such a car would be $296, assuming 48 coupons, 10 percent interest and 20 percent down.\n\nEdmunds.com says buyers currently are wangling about $800 off the asking price, which makes the Elantra seem compelling indeed. I would urge a sober examination of the crash-test data, however, especially if the purchase is being made on behalf of an inexperienced driver.\n\n“The Gannett News Service”",

      "expert_review": "Some car companies get no respect. Neither do their cars. Ditto certain types of car.\n\nSay hello to the Hyundai Elantra Wagon.\n\nI’ll wait while you stop laughing, lose interest or debate on whether to turn the page. After all, there must be something interesting here, right?\n\nMaybe it’s stretching a point, but this little Hyundai has two things going for it. One: a low sticker price and two: stand-apart styling.\n\nHyundai makes buying the wagon (and the sedan) an easy experience because there’s one trim level. Air-conditioning, power windows, power door locks, AM/FM/cassette stereo/tilt steering wheel, remote trunk release, 6-way adjustable driver’s seat and Michelin tires are all standard. Not bad, right?\n\nOther niceties include 32 cubic feet of storage with the rear seat in use and 63 cubic feet with the rear seat folded. Also, there is a center console, carpeting, overhead map lights, rear wiper/washer and a $200 price cut. Not bad, right?\n\nThe engine is the largest in the class &#151; a 2-liter double-overhead-cam 16-valve four-cylinder engine good for 140 horsepower and 133 pound-feet of torque. It will move this car quite quickly for an econo-scooter. Sounds good?\n\nWell, this car looks good on paper. But like the all-you-can eat-buffet for $6.99, it’s not the quantity, it’s the quality.\n\nThis car is small. At just over 174 inches, its standard sub-compact fare, yet has decent room inside. But it’s low, very low, so low in fact you lean your elbows on the roof. The engine does have good power, but it constantly reminds you of how hard it’s working. The engine conspires with wind, road and tire noise to drown out the radio. It may be just as well because the radio is very tinny and you’ll insist on replacing it.\n\nHandling is typical small car, with understeer safely coming on along with the expected body lean.\n\nIt didn’t even prove to be very fuel efficient, yielding just 19 mpg in mixed driving. Worse, there are no markings on the gas gauge between full and empty, so how much fuel is left is a guessing game.\n\nDual air bags are standard up front. Four-wheel anti-lock front disc/rear drum brakes are standard as well.\n\nSure this car gets little respect, despite styling that’s shapely and stands apart from the jelly bean school of design. Of course, the horn won’t engender any respect lost to the car’s badge or small size, as it honks with the wimpiest sound known to the automotive world. SUV owners will look down at this vehicle and mistake it for a hood ornament.\n\nNo matter how good the car, an owner must still endure some people’s behavior when they find out you own a Hyundai. They’ll either mistake you for crazy or a charity case. Either way, pity isn’t something one enjoys from owning a car.\n\nDo not be fooled by the low prices here. The Hyundai test vehicle bottomed out just over $15,000. At that price, the Ford Focus wagon is a much better buy and a lot more fun to drive, even if it lacks a few amenities at the same price.\n\nYet Hyundai is constantly improving, as the new Sonata shows that. So, even if this Elantra fails to warm your heart, the next one just might.\n\n>> 2000 Hyundai Elantra Wagon\n\nVehicle type: Sub-compact 4-door wagon\nEngines: 2-liter inline DOHC four-cylinder\nTransmission: 5-speed manual, 4-speed automatic\nWheelbase: 100.4 inches\nLength: 174 inches\nCurb weight: 2,747 pounds\nCargo volume: 32.3 cubic feet\nTires: P195/60 HR14\nBase price, test model: $12,499\nAs tested: Not available\nEPA rating: 21 mpg city, 24 mpg highway\nTest mileage: 19 mpg\nFuel type: RegularBR> >>",

      "expert_review": "Hyundai has added a decidedly European GT five-door hatchback sedan to the Elantra line and bolstered it with a long list of standard equipment. The GT is far more practical than the sedan because it swallows cargo like a small station wagon yet drives with zestful pizzazz. An affordably priced combination of fun and function.\n\nThis formula is similar to one employed by European manufacturers such as Saab, which would seem to be the inspiration for the Elantra GT because many of its features, including its sloping hatchback profile and the instrument panel, bear more than a passing resemblance to this famous Swede.\n\nThe recently introduced GT is a spinoff of the Elantra sedan, which was all-new for 2001. This third-generation of the Elantra has a bigger interior and its 102.7-inch wheelbase is 2.3 inches longer than the previous modelÕs. It marks significant maturation for Hyundai, whose current vehicles are a vast improvement over ones of the past.\n\nTo underscore how much Hyundai products have changed, their warranties are now among the longest offered: five years, 60,000 miles for bumper-to-bumper coverage, and 10 years or 100,000 miles for the powertrain. The powertrain warranty is transferable to other owners, but it reverts to five years or 60,000 miles. Elantra GT buyers get 24-hour roadside assistance, including towing and lockout service, free for five years.\n\nThe GT comes nicely equipped at a base price of $13,999: leather seats, air conditioning, AM/FM/CD stereo, power windows, power locks, power mirrors, alloy wheels, keyless entry, tilt steering wheel, side airbags and split-folding rear seat. Anti-lock brakes with traction control and a power moonroof are the only options.\n\nThe GT builds on the already solid foundation of the Elantra by offering a sport-tuned version of the fully independent suspension that provides a compliant ride without feeling loose and sloppy. Fifteen-inch alloy wheels and 195/60 Michelin tires do their part to connect with the pavement as well as to add to the GT’s sporty character. While this won’t be confused with an outright sports sedan, it rides and handles with a directness that is reassuring and pleasant.\n\nThe well-appointed interior was a surprise considering the price. The front seats are contoured for good lateral support and the leather upholstery has vertical seams so as not to irritate the driver’s derriere. Side airbags are integrated into the seatbacks. The angle of the seat cushions and the amount of lumbar support are adjusted by large knobs on the lower outside portion of the seat. Even the lid on the center console is covered in leather. Wind and road noise are not at all intrusive, and the overall noise level seems to be on par with, or better than, other compact sedans.\n\nThe instrument panel contains gauges whose easily readable graphics are stylistically like a more expensive vehicle’s. They are contained in a pod that wraps across in front of the driver and curv es down into the central console to create a distinct cockpit feel. Rotary dials for heating and cooling spin easily, and dual cupholders are carved into the console. The quality of textures and materials used throughout the interior is a step above what one expects in this price range.\n\nThe split-folding back seat can be folded down to create a cargo space that is more than 5 feet deep. Rear-seat legroom is surprisingly generous for a vehicle of this size. The trunk floor mat was made of lightweight material that curled up when the rear seat was upright. Real carpet would enhance the look and feel of the trunk space.\n\nPowering the GT is a 140-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine mounted transversely over the front wheels. This engine has an aluminum cylinder head, dual overhead camshafts and four valves per cylinder. Hydraulic engine mounts, a new front subframe, ribbed engine block and a cast-aluminum oil pan all work to keep engine vibrations out of the cabin. Getti e most performance from this engine is done with the five-speed manual gearbox, although an automatic is available. The shifter is topped with a round, leathercovered knob that feels like a baseball.\n\nIf there’s one criticism I have of this powerplant, it centers around a lack of off-idle engine torque. When the clutch is released from a stop, the first few feet of movement feel pretty sluggish, but that changes as the revs build enough to get the vehicle moving smartly. Revved hard, the engine gets its second wind and moves the GT along smartly.\n\nAdding the GT model to the Elantra lineup should appeal to buyers who want tighter handling, plenty of standard equipment and an interior that can function like a small station wagon without looking like one.\n\nPrice\nThe base price of the Elantra GT is $13,999. Standard equipment includes side airbags for front passengers, four-wheel disc brakes, AM/FM/CD player, air conditioning, keyless entry, power windows, power mirrors, cruise control, tilt wheel, rear defogger, split-folding rear seat and leather upholstery.\n\nThe sticker price of the test car was $14,572, including freight and floor mats.\n\nWarranty\nFive years or 60,000 miles, and 10 years or 100,000 miles on the powertrain.\n\nPoint: The GT is a good blend of sporty looks and cargo-carrying function. The 140-horsepower engine provides decent performance, the suspension is tuned to be like a European car and the list of standard equipment for $13,999 is impressive.\n\nCounterpoint: The engine’s lack of off-idle torque means it needs to be revved up to pull smartly away from a stop, and the flimsy trunk mat looked bad and didn’t fit well up against the back seat.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\nEngine: 2.0-liter, 140-hp. 4-cyl.\nTransmission: Five-speed Front-wheel drive\nWheelbase: 102.7 inches\nCurb weight: 2,635 lbs.\nBase price: $13,999\nAs driven: $14,572\nMpg rating: 25 city, 33 hwy.\n> >",

      "expert_review": "“Good things come to those who wait.”\n\nThat’s the excuse No. 1 daughter gave the last time she was asked to clean her room.\n\nIt also was the excuse No. 2 daughter used when asked to set the dinner table.\n\nAnd it’s what Hyundai of South Korea is saying about its 1994-model Elantra.\n\nWe’ve long thought Hyundai would make a fine alternative to U.S. or Japanese economy cars, provided this were the 18th Century. Hyundai quality inthe ’90s has been likened to Japanese quality in the ’70s. Hyundai made a namefor itself in this country by selling on the cheap. The South Korean automakersaw an opening for a low-priced economy car to fill the void left by Japan andthe U.S. and took advantage of it with the Excel in 1986.\n\nSince then, however, while the U.S. and Japanese have been offering incentives to attract new buyers, Hyundai has been offering apologies to its old ones.\n\nTo be blunt, we’ve never driven a South Korean car we’d want to give permanent residence to in our driveway while the title rests in the safe.\n\nHyundai now says that the wait is over and that it has come up with a bunchof things that make its 1994 Elantra worthy to rub bumpers with the competition. For ’94, Elantra sports some front- and rear-end cosmetic surgeryplus a driver-side air bag as standard, a long-awaited addition. Anti-lock brakes are an option to keep down the sticker price.\n\nGood things may happen if you’re willing to wait, but Hyundai made consumers wait a lot longer for air-bag protection than the rest of the industry did. And consumers still have a wait ahead of them for dual bags, which are the norm at a time when Hyundai is catching up with a driver-side bag only.\n\nRobert Parker, vice president-sales for Hyundai, said the South Korean automaker will add dual air bags in the redesigned 1995 Sonata in March; in the restyled, smaller 1995 Excel (it may have a new name, too) next September;and the Elantra for the 1996 model year, when it gets a redesign at the same time Hyundai drops the Scoupe.\n\nBack to the present. Elantra is powered by a 1.8-liter, 124-horsepower, four-cylinder engine. The attraction is the 23 m.p.g. city/28 highway rating with the optional four-speed automatic transmission (the five-speed manual is rated at 21/28), not the ability to scoot from the light. And be advised that the engine/transmission like to growl when you kick the accelerator.\n\nThe base price of the Elantra GLS we tested is $11,684 (with the manual, it’s $10,959).\n\nStandard equipment includes power brakes and steering; independent suspension; front and rear stabilizer bars; gas-pressurized shocks; 14-inch Michelin steel-belted radials; AM/FM stereo with cassette; power windows, mirrors and door locks; body-colored bumpers, door handles and bodyside moldings; tinted glass; rear-window defroster; intermittent windshield wipers;digital clock; remote fuel-filler door, decklid and hood releases; and rear-door child-safety locks.\n\nOur test car added a $3,120 package consisting of an upgraded stereo with six speakers, non-Freon air conditioning, cruise control, aluminum-alloy wheels, anti-lock brakes and power sunroof. It also added carpeted floor mats for $58, a sunroof wind deflector for $52 and a compact-disc player for $395.\n\nThe sticker topped $15,300, a total we suspect will send consumers to Chevrolet or Ford showrooms for a Cavalier or an Escort, or to a Saturn dealership for an SL1 sedan. All three are lower-priced, even though they might not offer as much standard equipment.\n\nWhat the Chevy, Ford and Saturn lack in standard gadgets compared with Hyundai, they make up for in resale value. And those three alternatives to Hyundai will be joined next month by the Dodge/Plymouth Neon.\n\nHyundai insists its quality is better and it’s safe for consumers to come back into the showrooms. To lure back those buyers, it offers a 36-month/36,000-mile bumper-to-bumper warranty plus 60-month/60, 000-mile powertrain and 60-month/100,000-mile corrosion and perforation coverage. There’s also a 36-month/36,000-mile roadside-assistance program offering emergency towing and mechanical service through a toll-free hot line.\n\nTo eliminate the contribution neglected servicing makes to poor quality, Hyundai also offers free maintenance for the first two years or 24,000 miles of ownership. Or, buyers can do their own servicing and maintenance and take a$250 rebate.\n\nHyundai officials expect sales to rise in 1994 because Japanese car prices have risen and Hyundai fills the void at the lower end of the market. But Cavalier, Escort, Saturn and, soon, Neon, can make the same claim.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe Elantra compact sedan should appeal to value- and safety-conscious buyers, as its price undercuts many in its class. Its trim levels are the entry-level GLS and better-equipped SE; competitors include the Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla and Chevy Cobalt.\n\nNew for 2009\nA sport-tuned Elantra Touring hatchback, equipped similarly to the uplevel SE sedan, is new.\n(Skip to details on the: Elantra Touring)\n\nA CD audio system, optional on the GLS and standard on the SE, adds USB and auxiliary ports to integrate with iPods or other MP3 players. All models get revised gauges.\n\nExterior\nAt 177.4 inches long and 69.9 inches wide, the Elantra casts a slightly bigger shadow than a four-door Civic. The Elantra is 58.3 inches tall, which is about 2 inches taller than the Civic.\n\n15-inch steel wheels (standard on GLS)\n16-inch alloy wheels (standard on SE)\nOptional fog lights (standard on GLS)\nStandard heated power mirrors\nStandard body-colored mirrors and door handles\n\nInterior\nThe Elantra’s interior is noticeably larger than the previous generation’s, with enough backseat legroom for a 6-foot adult.

Other features new to the Touring model are standard USB and auxiliary audio inputs. The center stack design also has been changed.\n\nPower still comes from the same four-cylinder engine, but for an economy car it isn’t completely anemic. Hyundai tuned the suspension and steering for better handling versus the Elantra sedan.\nBack to top",

      "expert_review": "There are a lot of new compact cars on the market these days, including the Kia Forte and redesigned Mazda3. Others, like the Honda Civic and Hyundai Elantra, are aging gracefully.\n\nThe Elantra is one of the least expensive compacts out there, especially with the seemingly nonstop incentives available on this model. Now, for the first time, the company is offering a bare-bones model, dubbed Elantra Blue, that also gets the best mileage of the lineup: 35 mpg on the highway.\n\nIt’s an alluring concept for cost-conscious shoppers, but because of the Blue’s sparse features and the cost of adding just a few essentials, shoppers should take a close look at the real value of such a proposition.\n\nPerformance\nThere is absolutely nothing exciting about driving a Hyundai Elantra. It has ho-hum handling and no personality, and acceleration is rationed tighter than food on “The Biggest Loser.” Of course, it doesn’t do anything badly, either. In fact, the driving experience is completely predictable, unlike the somewhat inconsistent Forte and the numb Toyota Corolla.\n\nThe five-speed manual transmission in my Elantra Blue tester was easy to shift, with a light clutch. I commuted in heavy traffic and my left leg never got tired.\n\nThe ride was relatively soft, with acceptable road and wind noise for this class. The seats are comfortable on long drives, too. Basically, this is the type of car a person buys to commute in, and the Elantra is very good at it.\n\nMileage for a standard Elantra GLS with a manual transmission is 25/34 mpg city/highway, while models with an automatic transmission do better, at 26/34 mpg. Those numbers are up 1 mpg in all categories versus the 2009 model. The Elantra Blue is rated 26/35 mpg.\n\nI averaged 25 mpg during my week with the Elantra Blue. I generally average close to cars’ city mileage estimate during my test drives, so that seemingly low number isn’t unusual.\n\nI did get the chance to drive in some significant snow and ice here in Chicago, and the Elantra did a fair job tackling it. I usually recommend all-wheel drive to folks who can afford it and live in a place like Chicago, but the Elantra shows that even an inexpensive front-wheel-drive car can handle slick roads when driven properly.\n\nStability control and traction control are standard on the top-of-the-line Elantra SE, but they’re absent on the Blue. I was more worried the car would be equipped with low-rolling-resistance tires, which are made for efficiency and might impact grip in the snow. Hyundai squeezed that single extra highway mpg from the engine, though, so standard 15-inch tires got me through the slush with plenty of grip — thankfully.\n\nValue & Features\nAll Elantras come with a comfortable interior with few frills and lots of room, plus a large trunk for the class (14.2 cubic feet). The dash has a simple layout, with materials that are on par, quality-wise, with most of the competition, though they’re a step or two behind the best, like the Civic. The seats are supportive, visibility is good and you don’t feel cramped inside. That’s about all you can ask of an inexpensive compact.\n\nBut how inexpensive is it really?\n\nThe Elantra Blue starts at $14,145, with standard features like power windows and locks, plus power, heated side mirrors and remote entry. But there’s no air conditioning or stereo, and it comes in just four colors: gray, silver, black and blue. There’s only one option package, the $1,700 Comfort Package, which adds things like air conditioning, a stereo and cruise control. My test car had that package and a Bluetooth system, bringing the total MSRP, including the destination charge, to $17,020.\n\nThat’s not exactly the cheap car that’s advertised. Kia’s all-new Forte sedan, comparably equipped, is $15,890 after destination, and it’s a more advanced car. And get this: It’s also available with a $1,000 cash-back offer in most areas through May 3, 2010. Its slight mileage disadvantage — 25/34 mpg versus the Blue’s 26/35 — likely won’t outweigh its lower price compared with the Elantra Blue.\n\nMove up to the Elantra GLS at $16,895, and you get an automatic transmission and everything in the Blue’s comfort package as standard equipment. Equipped identically to my Blue tester with Bluetooth, the MSRP would be $18,070, including destination. As of this writing, there was also a $1,500 cash-back offer on all Elantras.\n\nThere’s also an SE trim level that adds 16-inch wheels, steering-wheel audio controls, stability control, traction control and a sport-tuned suspension. It starts at $17,845 before destination, and it also has a $1,500 cash-back offer (all valid through April 30).\n\nSafety\nThe Elantra now receives the top ranking, Good, from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety in both frontal and side crash tests. It rates Acceptable, the second-best score, in rear tests. Hyundai altered the structure of the doors, so side crash-test scores improved. The Elantra comes with six airbags, including seat-mounted side airbags for the front seats. Safety equipment like stability control and traction control aren’t offered on the lowest trim levels, though they’re standard on the SE.\n\nElantra in the Market\nWhile the Elantra is as solid as cars come in the compact segment, it’s not going to wow anyone — nor does it best the new Kia Forte in terms of price or safety features. You’d have to find the right trim level and equipment, the right rebate and perhaps even the right salesman to get the green light on this practical purchase.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Hyundai Elantra?\n\nThe Hyundai Elantra is a value-conscious compact sedan available with a choice of four engines. A 147-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder is standard, coupled with a continuously variable automatic transmission. The performance-themed N Line uses a 201-hp, turbo 1.6-liter four-cylinder that’s paired to a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic. The Elantra Hybrid is powered by a 1.6-liter four-cylinder hybrid powertrain that’s rated at 139 hp total and employs a six-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. For high-performance enthusiasts, the racy Elantra N gets a 276-hp, turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder with a choice of a six-speed manual or eight-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. That model also has a track-tuned suspension and unique trim touches. \n\nCabin space is plentiful for the class, and the Elantra Hybrid has an excellent 20.0 cubic feet of cargo space, according to Cars.com’s cargo measurements. The Elantra’s rivals include the Honda Civic, Kia K4, Nissan Sentra, Subaru Impreza and Toyota Corolla.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Hyundai Elantra?\n\nAfter a refresh last year, the Elantra sees only minor changes for 2025. The previous SEL trim is renamed SEL Sport and adds gloss-black mirrors and spoiler, 17-inch alloy wheels, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and alloy pedals. The Convenience Package becomes a separate trim named SEL Convenience. \n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Hyundai Elantra Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nLED headlights\n8-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nCruise control\nTwo USB ports\nKeyless entry\nAutomatic emergency braking\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nLane departure steering assist\nSafe exit warning\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nLED taillights\nPower moonroof\nLeather-trimmed seats\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nFour USB ports\n10.25-inch touchscreen\nNavigation\nWireless device charging\nDual-zone automatic climate control\nDigital instrument panel\nAdaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability\nShould I Buy the 2025 Hyundai Elantra?\n\nThe Hyundai Elantra is a solid value with an eye-catching exterior you wouldn’t expect in a budget-minded compact sedan. Ride quality is good, and the Elantra’s handling makes it nimble in city traffic. The standard 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine delivers decent pep and refinement, but the N Line and N versions provide truly exciting acceleration. If fuel economy is your priority, the Elantra Hybrid earns an EPA-estimated 54 mpg in combined city and highway driving. What’s not to like? There are some noticeable penny-pinching materials in the Elantra’s cabin, plus some powertrain lag from the turbo engine in the sporty N Line variant.",

      "expert_review": "Wasn’t so long ago that Hyundai’s survival in the U.S. market was considered a coin toss at best.\n\nHyundai took the U.S. market by storm in 1986 with a new subcompact car called Excel that sold for about $4,000, less than most used cars sold for at the time.\n\nWithin two years, the South Korean automaker rang up sales of 264,282 cars in the U.S.\n\nThen folks started paying attention to quality and not just price. Sales began a steady decline until they reached 90,217 in 1998, and the fat lady began warming up her vocal cords.\n\nBut Hyundai has reversed its fortunes. It replaced Excel with the Accent in 1995 and followed that with an expansion of the lineup to include the Sonata, Elantra, Tiburon, XG300 and Santa Fe.\n\nBut more important, it focused on quality to win back consumer confidence and now, rather than worry about survival, it’s talking expansion and has targeted sales of 1 million vehicles in the U.S. by 2010.\n\nTo help meet that goal, it will add an assembly plant in Montgomery, Ala., to produce 300,000 cars and sport-utility vehicles annually starting in 2005.\n\nThrough May, ’03 sales rose to 164,524 units, from 153,102 a year earlier, well on the way to reaching the target of 420,000 for the full year, up from the 375,119 sold here in ’02.\n\nA major contributor to its growth has been the Santa Fe sport-utility vehicle, with sales rising from 50,000 in its first year in 2001 to 75,000 in ’02, and an expected 100,000 in ’03.\n\nBut the best-selling nameplate in the lineup is the compact Elantra, and it, too, is making a contribution. Sales have risen to nearly 49,000 in the first five months of this year, up from about 47,000 a year earlier.\n\nAnd to ensure the popularity of its best-selling model, Hyundai has added a new offering for ’03, the Elantra GT sedan as a companion to the GT hatchback it offered for ’02.\n\nWith its 2-liter, 135-horsepower 4-cylinder engine, the Elantra GT sedan we tested will never be mistaken for a Mustang GT coupe. But it’s not a car you have to be ashamed of, either. Like a Saturn coupe, Elantra is an economy car dressed in sporty attire with spoiler so it doesn’t look like a blue-light special.\n\nThe 2-liter will get you moving but won’t get the radials smoking. The suspension will hold you in corners and turns, provided you enter and exit those corners and turns more gingerly than you would in a Mustang GT.\n\nYou’ll not only feel blemishes in the road, you’ll also hear the tires slapping against them while in the cabin.\n\nBut it’s easier to accept a few compromises when you check out the numbers–a base price of only $14,149 and fuel economy of 24 m.p.g. city/33 m.p.g. highway, and we swear that it took two days of driving before the needle on the fuel gauge slipped off the “F” mark in the ’03 Elantra GT tested.\n\nIn addition to the numbers, the letters are impressive, the ones that spell “included” on the window sticker when it comes to standard equipment.\n\nThe GT comes with four-wheel disc brakes; 15-inch, radial tires; AM/FM stereo with CD changer; air conditioning; power locks, windows and mirrors; cruise control; trip computer; keyless entry; purple gauges; rear-window defroster; tilt steering; split folding rear seats; carpeted floor mats; and dual front and side-impact air bags.\n\nA trio of options complete the package–anti-lock brakes with traction control at $525, power moonroof, $650, and automatic transmission, $800. That’s about $2,000 in goodies added to the $14,149 base.\n\nOther noteworthy touches include impressive trunk size, rear seats that fold to increase cargo room through the trunk, a black-dot matrix on the glass behind the rearview mirror to reduce glare and more than ample, leg, head and arm room front and rear.\n\nOf course, it is a $14,000 car and there are some drawbacks, such as a narrow tunnel between trunk and cabin opening when the rear seats are lowered that blocks easy loading of items into the cabin, plus rear seat backs that are a tad stiff.\n\nVolo vs. Volvo II: We reported that Volvo, the carmaker, and Volo, the car museum, were at odds (Cars, May 5).\n\nVolvo of Sweden, which sells about 130,000 new Volvos in the U.S. each year, became upset when it learned that Volo Auto Museum, in the hamlet of Volo, west of Grayslake, which displays and sells about 700 antique, vintage and collector cars annually, had an Internet domain name similar to the carmaker’s–volocars.com vs. volvocars.com.\n\nImagine if a Volvo shopper didn’t exhibit digital dexterity and accidentally entered the Volo cars Web site, and rather than getting a new Volvo ended up with a ’57 Chevy!\n\nVolvo told Volo to give up its name. Volo told Volvo to go to Goteborg. Volvo responded by filing a complaint with the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), which resolves domain name disputes.\n\nGreg Grams, proprietor of the museum/vintage car sales outlet, argued that he had his domain name before Volvo had its domain name, so he should keep his. Besides, he said, not only doesn’t the museum sell Volvos, but its site also has a link to Volvo should folks reach Volo by mistake.\n\nVolvo, which admits it hasn’t lost any sales to Volo, said it is only trying to protect its name and trademark.\n\nThe only agreement the two sides have reached in the last several weeks is that they can’t settle the dispute and will wait for WIPO to rule.\n\nGrams said a few days ago he got a visit from a Volvo representative.\n\n“Volvo sent an emissary to ask me what it would take to settle the dispute, and I said for Volvo to agree to go away and leave us alone. I also said I had more than $80,000 in legal fees,” Grams said.\n\n“I was told Volvo wouldn’t take care of the legal fees, but to end the publicity, they would agree to leave us alone and [let us] keep our domain name. They were to send me an agreement to sign, but I didn’t get it, so I called. The man who visited had gone on vacation so I talked to another man who said he’d send the agreement. I got it a couple days later and couldn’t believe it. The agreement said that I would agree to give up the domain name,” Grams said.\n\n“This has gotten out of hand. Our concern isn’t with Volo cars or the museum as it is in protecting our trademark,” said Volvo spokesman Dan Johnston, who said he was the one who visited Grams three weeks ago and asked how he could end the dispute.\n\n“I feel we reached an agreement to get this over, but a couple days later he rescinded the pact. Now it’s up to WIPO to decide,” Johnston said.\n\n“I’ll take my chances with WIPO,” Grams said. “I feel positive we can win this.”\n\nAnd if WIPO rules for Volvo?\n\n“If WIPO decides against us , then I’ve got to talk to my attorneys about going to federal court with this. I’m not going to give up my identity to a wealthy Swedish company,” Grams said.\n\nActually, Volvo is owned by Ford, a wealthy American family.\n\nTEST DRIVE\n\n2003 Hyundai Elantra GT\n\nWheelbase: 102.7 inches\n\nLength: 177.1 inches\n\nEngine: 2-liter, 135-h.p., 4-cylinder\n\nTransmission: 5-speed manual\n\nFuel economy: 24 m.p.g. city/33 m.p.g. highway\n\nBase price: $14,149\n\nPrice as tested: $14,799. Includes $650 power moonroof. Add $540 for freight.\n\nPluses: GT sedan a new addition to lineup for ’03. Low initial price with lots of standard equipment and not a long list of options (anti-lock brakes at $525, automatic transmission at $800, and power moonroof at $650 are all you need). Fuel gauge acts as if needle is stuck on “F.” Doesn’t look like an economy car.\n\nMinuses: Ease off throttle in sharp corners. Doesn’t look like economy car, but suspension acts like one. Tunnel blocks passage from trunk to rear sets with seat backs folded. ABS, automatic and moonroof still add almost $2,000.",

      "expert_review": "Nimbly Avoiding Confrontation\n2004 Hyundai Elantra GT Hatchback\n\nThe offset news was upsetting. Hyundai Elantra models for the 2001-03 model years received “poor” ratings in frontal offset crash tests conducted by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.\n\nPoor means the drivers of those cars have a high risk of head, neck and leg injuries in 40-mph, 40-degree-angle, frontal crashes between vehicles of similar size, according to the institute’s evaluation.\n\nThose kinds of collisions, in which 100 percent of the crash energy is concentrated on a small front portion of a vehicle, are the worst sort. Unlike full-width frontal crashes, frontal offset hits allow more crash forces to enter the passenger cabin and harm occupants.\n\nBy extrapolation, the institute’s rating of the 2001-03 Elantras meant the 2004 Hyundai Elantra GT hatchback sitting in my driveway had a similar potential for crash injury.\n\nThe 2004 Elantra is built largely on the 2001-03 platform. The changes for 2004, with the notable exception of a new continuously variable valve-timing device in its engine, are mostly cosmetic.\n\nBut I drove the new Elantra GT anyway. It is not so much that I am reckless as I am pathologically cynical when it comes to results from lab-test crashes.\n\nThe smallest thing can change the outcome of those smash-bang exercises in which computerized dummies are the “drivers.” An adjustment in air-bag deployment speeds, the addition of side or head bags, or a seat-belt adjustment — any and all of those things and more — could substantially change crash-test results.\n\nIndeed, using a human being in place of a dummy could change the results. Humans react to impending danger. They try to avoid it. On the highway, success in crash avoidance varies with a driver’s skills and the vehicle’s active safety personality — its handling ability, its suspension system and steerability and the addition of features such as anti-lock brakes.\n\nThough I think highly of my driving skills, that self-assessment is, of course, debatable. But there is little to argue about in the matter of the Elantra GT’s road competence. It is a remarkably nimble front-wheel-drive car. It’s almost astonishing when you consider that it is, after all, an economy runner.\n\nI drove the Elantra GT mostly in the city, where it excels. It has the right amount of urban oomph — a 138-horsepower, two-liter, inline four-cylinder engine. The continuously variable valve-timing device, which more efficiently opens and closes air-fuel intake valves, makes the best use of that power.\n\nThere is good low-end torque, torque being the force that produces drive-shaft rotation. As a result, the Elantra does quite well in the myriad stop-and-go and slow-to-go situations in city driving.\n\nHighway running in the Elantra GT is commendable for relatively short trips, such as round-trip tr avel from Washington, D.C., to New York City. The car’s “Euro-tuned suspension” offers a hard ride, which is great for instant, curve-taking gratification. But it isn’t so good for a longer-term relationship between the driver’s bottom and the driver’s seat.\n\nAll said, I like this car. Hyundai officials contend that, because of certain interior modifications, the 2004 Elantra GT should do better than its 2001-03 predecessors in the insurance institute’s frontal offset crash tests. I did not try to verify that claim in real-world driving.\n\nThe way I figure it, you can die or be injured in a variety of ways, in or out of a vehicle. I don’t worry about it. I just try to delay my inevitable appearance at the Pearly Gates by wearing seat belts, driving as well as I can, loving the ride and hoping for the best.\n\nNuts & Bolts\n\nDownside: There is a possibility, based on the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s crash-test results, that the Elantra GT ay not be your best friend in a specific kind of crash — a 40-mph hit at a 40-degree angle into the front side of the car.\n\nRecommended remedy: Don’t crash.\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: Very good short-distance ride; excellent stop-to-start and slow-to-go acceleration; overall excellent handling.\n\nHead-turning quotient: New front-end treatment and a revised taillight design give the new Elantra GT a richer look. People noticed.\n\nVehicle layout/design: The Elantra GT is a front-engine, front-wheel-drive car with a rear hatch.\n\nEngine/transmission: The Elantra GT is equipped with a 2-liter, 16-valve engine that develops 138 horsepower at 6,000 revolutions per minute. Maximum torque is 136 foot-pounds at 4,500 rpm. A five-speed manual transmission is standard. A four-speed automatic is optional.\n\nCapacities: The Elantra GT has seating for five people. Maximum cargo capacity is 37 cubic feet. The fuel tank holds 14.5 gallons of recommended regular unleaded gasoline.\n\nMileage: I averaged 30 miles per gallon in mostly city driving.\n\nSafety: Front side bags are standard.\n\nPricing: Base price on tested 2004 Elantra GT in “Rally Red” paint is $14,849.

      "expert_review": "MILL VALLEY, Calif. It was a trip in memory of the Coast Miwok Indians, the gentle hunter-gatherers who inhabited this place for nearly 5,000 years until the late 18th century, when Western civilization wiped them out along with many of the giant redwoods that once provided bark to cover Miwok huts.\n\nThere were no paved roads back then. But there are many now — some of them winding, twisting, arching, running perilously close to cliff edges, leading to the moral equivalent of a tree museum: the Muir Woods National Monument, one of the last surviving groves of primordial California coast redwoods, now protected by the National Park Service.\n\nIt was appropriate, under the circumstance, to take a car that was not as harmful to the ecology of the place as Western civilization had been to the Miwok Indians, whose people and culture have been “indirectly eradicated,” according to some local historical accounts. I chose the 2008 Hyundai Elantra GLS PZEV — with PZEV being a California designation meaning “partial zero emission vehicle.”\n\nI’m puzzled by the concept of something being partially zero. But I suppose it’s something like PZIP, which, when applied to the documented history of the Miwok Indians, could stand for Partially Zero Indigenous People.\n\nBut I digress.\n\nThis is a car column, after all, and this week’s subject vehicle, by all conventional definitions, certainly qualifies as a car. It has an in-line, four-cylinder, 132-horsepower engine to power its front-drive wheels. It has four wheels total. There also are four side doors and a rear end with a traditional notchback trunk. The transmission in the subject car is a four-speed automatic.\n\nBut another characteristic of the Elantra, its size, is more difficult to describe. The car began life in 1991 as a compact that looked and felt like a compact. But largely in response to the growth of American bottoms and torsos, as well as in reaction to automotive rivals such as the Ford Focus, Honda Civic and Toyota Corolla — all of which have been enlarged to accommodate the widening of America — the Elantra has expanded its girth too.\n\nThe Elantra now is a mid-size automobile, actually on the lower end of mid-size. That means the new Elantra offers genuine rear-seating comfort for adult passengers. That’s good news for most adults who have suffered the agony of a cramped, back-seat ride in a compact car.\n\nAlso good is that the Elantra’s marketing turns out to be more truth than hype. The car does not pretend to be hot, hip, sexy or wicked. Instead, it proudly presents its credentials as an economy-mobile. Its marketers tout it as the “best value in its class” and as being a “class above the competition.” In both cases, they are right.\n\nThe Elantra GLS is a relatively inexpensive, high-quality car with a base price of $13,625. Compare that with base prices for the Ford Focus ($14,705), Honda Civic ($14,810), Suzuki SX4 ($14,770) or Toyota Corolla ($15,250).\n\nIt was a good drive as test drives go. The Elantra GLS PZEV proved competent on Marin County’s twisting, winding roads. Its handling was sure, albeit lacking the precision that some throttle jockeys demand in everything, including minivans. But drivers mindful and accepting of the fact that the Elantra is an economy car meant to be used as an economy car will find little to complain about with this one.\n\nIt is the genuine article, much as the Miwok Indians who once lived in, loved and honored this place were genuine articles, real examples of how humans, if left to the better angels of their nature, could live in peace with their environment.\n\nWho knows? If ever we are wiped out by some invading force, or eliminated through our own carelessness and selfishness, and, somehow, a sample of an Elantra is discovered and cranked to life, future anthropologists might conclude: “Aha, Hyundai. This was a company that cared.”",

      "expert_review": "I like station wagons. Always have. Even little ones can be handy. Flip down the seat and you can haul packages, luggage, bikes or sundry supplies from the lumberyard for weekend chores.\n\nOf course, little wagons can’t swallow as much cargo as sport-utility vehicles or minivans, but they hold more than a small sedan and get good gas mileage. They cost less, too.\n\nHyundai’s decision to offer a wagon version of its Elantra is based on just these assumptions. It joins the Ford Escort, Mercury Tracer, Suzuki Esteem and Saturn wagon as the only small wagons available.\n\nThe Elantra GLS station wagon with a CD player and alloy wheels, for example, stickers for less than $16,000. Its overall interior volume is 129.6 cubic feet, which exceeds many of its competitors.\n\nThis four-door wagon is a good example of what’s right with Hyundai’s current product line. With a 130-horsepower, four-cylinder engine, it moves out smartly, even when equipped with an automatic transmission. This 1.8-liter, dual-overhead-cam (DOHC), 16-valve powerplant goes abouts it normal chores without complaint. Only under full throttle does it get the least bit loud.\n\nThe electroncially controlled four-speed automatic transmission may slow acceleration from a standstill, but city driving is more relaxed. On the highway I found I made frequent use of the lever-mounted button for shifting out of overdrive when I needed a bit of extra zip to move through traffic.\n\nOverall, the Elantra’s body structure feels tight and solid. The doors open and close with a satisfying thunk, and there were no squeaks or rattles.\n\nInside, the passenger compartment is finished nicely. The instrument panel has a soft, leather-like texture. Gauges are bunched together in a black binnacle. The rear wiper switch hard to reach because it was on the dash behind the steering wheel.\n\nDual airbags are standard, too.\n\nOne of my pet peeves is a radio with tiny buttons, and the ones on this unit were microscopic. I suspect the combining the CD player into such a small unit is the culprit. The stereo’s sound quality was fine, however.\n\nOne reason you can hear the stereo so well is because there is not a lot of wind and road noise. The lack of extraneous sound comes from the use of extensive sound deadening as well as mounting the suspension on subframes.\n\nUsing fully independent suspensions, front and rear, aids the handling and tames the ride, which can be fairly rough in a car with a 100.4-inch wheelbase. Never did I find the ride uncomfortable.\n\nFour-wheel, anti-lock brakes are optional.\n\nAnother factor that contributes to a pleasant ride is the tightly contoured seats that have a tweed-like cloth is bonded to the foam. The lack of stitches eliminates wrinkling of the fabric. The driver’s seat has adjustable lumbar support, and the mounting points for the seat belts adjust for height to accommodate small drivers.\n\nThe split/folding , 60/40 back seat folds easily to expand the cargo space. A pull-out shade covers valuables with the seat is in place.\n\nFrom a styling perspective, the Elantra wagon looks like a small version of a bigger car. Its proportions are appealing and the rounded styling attractive.\n\nHyundai has worked hard to improve its reputation, and the Elantra wagon is a good example of how the product has been improved.\n\nPrice\n\nThe base price of our GLS wagon was $13,999. Standard equipment included power windows, power locks, power mirrors, interval wipers, tilt wheel, automatic transmission, power steering and AM/FM stereo.\n\nOptions on our test included alloy wheels, air conditioning, cruise control, floor mats, mud guards, body side moldings and upgraded stereo with CD player.\n\nWarranty\n\nThe standard warranty is for three years or 36,000 miles.\n\nVehicles for The Star’s week-long test drives are supplied by the auto manufacturers.\n\nPoint: Flexibile hauling capability, good gas mileage and a reasonable price make the Elantra wagon appealing.\n\nCounterpoint: The tiny radio controls were frustrating to use and the engine was a bit loud under full throttle.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\n\nENGINE: 1.8-liter, 4-cyl.\n\nTRANSMISSION: automatic\n\nWHEELBASE: 100.4 inches\n\nCURB WEIGHT: n\n\nBASE PRICE: $13,999\n\nPRICE AS DRIVEN: $15,971\n\nMPG RATING: 21 city, 30 hwy.",

      "expert_review": "Hyundai is on a roll toward respectability, with the 1996 Elantra station wagon its jauntiest, comfiest, best-looking low-bucks vehicle to date.  \n Not bad for a subcompact built in South Korea, a republic famous for kimchi souffles but infamous   for producing rattling misfits that would be considered dubious bargains if buyer incentives included 10,000 frequent flier miles per breakdown. You’d be vacationing in Monte Carlo the first week.  \n Early Elantras wallowed with the worst of them and   were hung, drawn and quartered by critics for being raucous and snail-powered with an automatic transmission that jolted occupants to the point of whiplash.   \n But this Elantra wagon, generally, is a hoot.  \n Looks come close to being a Ford        Contour cuddling a baby bullfrog. The form is quite attractive–quirky from this angle, almost voluptuous in that light–and far from being just another boring Asian soap bubble. There’s also a very serious roof rack that might have been borrowed from a   Buick Roadmaster and could double as carrying handles in tight parking situations.  \n For less than $16,000 you get the stuff of little Bimmers. Tilt steering and dual air bags. Independent front and rear suspension. Alloy wheels and cruise control.    Power windows, mirrors and locks. Air conditioning and a six-speaker sound system. And anti-lock disc brakes for a few bucks more.  \n Handling falls a few raised eyebrows beneath unbelievable for a car of this purpose in this shrunken price range.      Think Honda, think Toyota. Then give Hyundai credit for working a concert of changes to the underpinnings–from that independent suspension with stabilizer bars to a multi-link system at the rear–and carefully calibrated to keep the car tight and firm    and free of wayward repositioning whether its maneuvering be mundane or emergency.  \n The Elantra wagon has brakes that would stop a barge. Rack and pinion power steering keeps the car precisely where pointed without a hint of road surface or           weight-transfer wanderlust. So the driving experience becomes a succession of questions to self:  \n * Are we sure the rock-base version of this wagon costs only $14,000?  \n * Has part-ownerMazda become a full partner in Hyundai and rebadged a 626?  \n * Is this, in fact, a Hyundai?  \n The latter, sadly, remains an easy answer.  \n For no matter what improvements Hyundai has been making to styling, tchotchkes, creature comforts and ancillary mechanicals, its power trains remain more            embarrassing than a bases-loaded walk.  \n From earlier drives aboard Hyundai’s Accent, Sonata and freshman Elantras, we suspect the trouble may lurk with the transmission. No matter mechanical or automatic, once worked by Hyundai they simply never seem to deliver performance promised by the horsepower.  \n *  \n In the 1996 Elantra, oomph has been elevated to 130 horsepower. That’s two ponies less than a base Dodge Neon sedan,                                                                           but more powerful than other subcompact wagons: Ford’s Escort (110 horsepower), Saturn (124), Toyota Corolla (105) and Subaru Impreza (110). And torque delivered by Elantra is superior to all but Neon.  \n We made several runs with a 4-speed automatic   Elantra wagon. In both modes, sport and conventional, and with engine revs built high against the brakes for whippet starts. Yet 12.3 seconds was the very best time for accelerating to 60 mph.  \n And that’s an average two seconds slower than times we   have posted with Neon, Escort, Saturn, Corolla and Impreza.  \n We switched to an Elantra sedan–220 pounds lighter than the wagon–with a 5-speed manual that typically squeezes out quicker times. Still, its best run to 60 mph was only 10.5 seconds.     \n That’s also inferior to the competition.  \n Worse, the Elantra’s mid-range acceleration from 40 mph to 70, often the sudden call of freeway travel, took 13 seconds. That’s just not enough to escape advancing semiso                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  to catch the guy in the Passat who flipped you off for dragging your butt in traffic and delaying his choco-martini.  \n Again, we point a finger at the transmission because it slapped and wheezed and hunted for the right gear or slipped into lethargy   and manic-depression every time we kicked its ribs.  \n In the end you give up, give in to this mechanical sedation, and give way to anyone who’s getting close enough to give you a noogie.  \n *  \n Once back on its own terms and turf, the Elantra   wagon loses its grumpies and reverts to slow albeit pleasant companionship. Which translates to more cargo and people room by several cuboids than Ford Escort, Toyota Corolla, Subaru Impreza or Saturn wagons. Or, thanks to 60 / 40 seats folding flat,      enough air space for a pair of mountain bikes and a big red dog.  \n The rear hatch opens and rises easily and liftover is low. The interior–the bolstering and grasp of seats, the clear view of instruments and short reach to critical controls and       buttons–is quite warm, and pleasantly covered with mid-quality plastics and fabrics.  \n There’s head, hip and shoulder room a plenty with all dimensions a match or an improvement on the competition. Accommodations for maps, gloves, parking tickets and Frappuccinos is generous. And there’s a net in the rear compartment so that Playmate coolers and the odd grapefruit do not ricochet.  \n In the years ahead, Hyundai will broaden its range to Japanese and American levels. There’s a minivan planned for    1998. Also a compact sport utility, a coupe, a convertible–and South Korea’s first luxury sedan with a 4.0-liter V-8.  \n We trust that current transmission diseases aren’t mechanically transmittable.   \n1996 Hyundai Elantra GLS Wagon  \n The      Good: Stylish, value-stuffed counter punch to those who say South Korea doesn’t make stylish, value-stuffed subcompacts. Grand handling close to being sporty. Roomier and as practical as competing wagons. A lot of wagon for the money.  \n The Bad:       Doesn’t live up to performance potential suggested by 130 horsepower. Engine and transmission protest mightily when overworked.  \n The Ugly: Durability questions raised by engine and transmission woes.   \n Cost  Base: $13,799. (Includes dual air     bags and 4-speed automatic; tilt steering; independent suspension; power windows, mirrors and doors; roof rack; rear window wiper / washer; center console with armrest; remote fuel door and trunk lid; child safety locks.)

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Hyundai Elantra?\n\nThe Hyundai Elantra is a value-conscious compact sedan available with a choice of three engines. A 147-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder is standard, coupled with a continuously variable automatic transmission. The Elantra Hybrid is motivated by a gas-electric hybrid drivetrain rated at 139 hp and employs a six-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. The performance-themed N Line has a 201-hp, turbo 1.6-liter four-cylinder that’s coupled with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic, and for high-performance enthusiasts, the racy Elantra N gets a 276-hp, turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder (with a choice of six-speed manual or eight-speed dual-clutch automatic transmissions) and a track-tuned chassis.\n\nThe Elantra offers 19 cubic feet of cargo space, according to Cars.com’s cargo measurements. You can see how it scored in our Car Seat Check here. Direct rivals include the Honda Civic, Kia Forte and Toyota Corolla.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Hyundai Elantra?\n\nFor 2023, the Elantra’s SEL Convenience Package adds 17-inch alloy wheels and a 10.3-inch digital gauge display, and — performance fans take note — the N Line is no longer offered with a manual transmission; that’s only available with the top-trim N variant.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Hyundai Elantra Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n8-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nCruise control\nTwo USB ports\nKeyless entry\nAutomatic emergency braking\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nLane departure steering assist\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nLED headlights and taillights\nPower moonroof\nLeather-trimmed seats\nHeated and ventilated front seats\n10.25-inch touchscreen\nNavigation\nWireless device charging\nDual-zone automatic climate control\nDigital instrument panel\nAdaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability\nShould I Buy the 2023 Hyundai Elantra?\n\nThe Elantra is a solid value with an eye-catching exterior you wouldn’t expect in a budget-minded compact sedan. Ride quality is good, and the Elantra’s handling makes it nimble in city traffic. The standard 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine delivers decent pep and refinement. If limiting your use of fuel is a priority, know that the Elantra Hybrid delivers an EPA-estimated 54 mpg in combined city and highway driving. What’s not to like? There are some noticeable penny-pinching materials in the Elantra’s cabin, plus some powertrain lag from the turbo engine in the sportier N Line trim.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2022 Hyundai Elantra?\n\nRedesigned last year, the Hyundai Elantra is a budget-friendly compact sedan that’s available with a choice of three engines: A 147-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder is standard, working with a continuously variable automatic transmission. The sportier N Line trim gets a 201-hp, turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder that pairs with a six-speed manual or seven-speed dual-clutch automatic. The fuel-sipping Elantra Hybrid is powered by a gas-electric hybrid drivetrain rated at 139 hp; it uses a six-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. Elantra rivals include the Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla and Nissan Sentra.\n\nThe Elantra offers 19 cubic feet of cargo space, according to Cars.com’s cargo measurements. You can see how it scored in our Car Seat Check here.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2022 Hyundai Elantra?\n\nApart from the addition of the high-performance Elantra N, there are no significant changes this year. \n\nWhat Features in the 2022 Hyundai Elantra Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nCloth upholstery\n8-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nCruise control\nAutomatic emergency braking\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nLane keep assist\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nLED headlights and taillights\nPower moonroof\nLeather-trimmed seats\nHeated and ventilated front seats\n10.25-inch touchscreen\nNavigation\nWireless device charging\nDual-zone automatic air conditioning\nDigital instrument panel\nAdaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability\nShould I Buy the 2022 Hyundai Elantra?\n\nThe Elantra’s sharply creased, aggressive exterior styling is eye-catching, but there’s a lot of substance here, too. Ride quality and handling are good, and the base 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine is refined. The hybrid model, meanwhile, offers impressive EPA-estimated gas mileage of up to 54 mpg combined. The biggest drawbacks are the Elantra’s low-grade interior materials and powertrain lag in the N Line version.",

      "expert_review": "The Hyundai Elantra Coupe is a youthful car chock-full of features for the tech-savvy, budget-sensitive, BC (before children) consumer.\n\nThe 2014 version has been beefed up with a new engine, suspension and steering refinements, some interior and exterior upgrades, and more standard features. It has also dropped the standard manual transmission. Compare the 2013 and 2014 Hyundai Elantras (excluding the GT) side by side here. If you like the Elantra Coupe and want to buy it new, don’t delay. Hyundai announced 2014 is its final model year.\n\nThe Elantra Coupe comes in only one trim, making life easy for those whose biggest decision is whether to go out or order in tonight — or whether to spend an extra $4,200 on the Technology Package (which my test car had).\n\nIf the Elantra Coupe doesn’t fit your personality profile, you may also be interested in checking out the Honda Civic Coupe, Kia Forte Koup or Scion tC. Compare them here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nHyundai has made a name for itself with inventive “fluidic design.” (Want proof? Google “fluidic design” and see what images come up. Come on, it’ll be fun.) The Elantra Coupe is no exception to the rule. It’s swoopy, young and fun, and it somehow manages to take feminine curves and make them into a much more sporty and androgynous vehicle.\n\nNew for 2014 is a standard real spoiler and blackout grille that ups the car’s Formula Drift look.\n\nHow It Drives\nThis year, a 2.0-liter inline-4 cylinder engine increases horsepower by almost 17 percent over 2013’s 1.8-liter. It’s now rated 173 hp for most models, up from 148 hp last year — but specifications reveal the lower-emissions PZEV (partial zero-emissions vehicle) version Elantra is again rated lower, at 166 hp.\n\nDespite the 2014’s increased horsepower, the Hyundai Elantra Coupe is not “sport-tuned” – it could definitely be a little peppier in order to add to the fun factor alluded to in its windswept look. There’s a slight lag upon acceleration, and despite suspension and steering modifications this year, I didn’t find either to feel very refined. The suspension was a bit too far on the “stiff and trying to be sporty” side, at the expense of daily driving comfort.\n\nEquipped with its new engine, standard six-speed automatic transmission and front-wheel drive, the Elantra Coupe gets an EPA-estimated 24/34/28 mpg city/highway/combined. The new engine is responsible for a significant, 3-mpg drop in combined fuel economy from 2013’s EPA-estimated 31 mpg.\n\nInterior\nThe base-price interior of the Hyundai Elantra manages to do basic without crossing too far into cheap. Several design elements that were previously optional are now standard, such as a leather-wrapped steering wheel.\n\nStandard faux-leather seats seats and heated front seats, plus the moonroof that came in the Tech Package, were bonuses at the Coupe’s price. The armrest on top of the center console slides back and forth, adjusting to either short or tall drivers (helpful in my family, as I’m 5-foot-3 and my husband is 6-foot-2). Disguised underneath the sliding armrest is a center console just big enough for a small clutch or wallet.\n\nTwo cupholders in the center console keep the morning joe and H20 within easy reach, while a little square compartment behind them holds miscellaneous items like loose change, parking garage tickets and lip balm. Another storage compartment with a closing door in front of the gearshift proved a good place to stash my phone.\n\nWhile the swooping roofline may look speedy, it does come with a downside, and that’s the yogic maneuvering required to duck under the roofline and behind the front seats in order to enter the backseat. At least the front seats’ shoulder belts emerge from rigid arms that click down and out of the way, making backseat access much easier. Like you would find in a small hatchback, there’s no storage at all for backseat passengers except for two cupholders in the fold-down center armrest.\n\nWhile I certainly wouldn’t want to have to climb in and out of the backseat of any coupe on a regular basis myself, it must not have been too uncomfortable for my tweens/teen (ages 9, 11 and 14) because I didn’t hear any complaints all week on our daily treks to summer camp. (Trust me, I would have heard about it loud and clear — not to mention dramatically.)\n\nThe 33.3 inches of rear legroom in the Elantra was barely enough for my kids to sit behind my husband’s seat (pushed back to accommodate his tall stature) without whining too much. For people wanting coupe styling with more backseat functionality, you might want to direct your attention to the 35.9 inches of rear-seat legroom in the Kia Forte Koup or the 34.6 inches in the Scion tC. The Honda Civic is the tightest of the pack, with just 30.8 inches.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe standard Bluetooth system was easy to pair with my smartphone, and the steering-wheel-mounted audio controls were great. Voice controls, on the other hand, were a total miss. I initially thought it was my husband’s heavy accent that was causing the problem and stepped in to prove it. However, when I tried the same set of commands it was still a pain. Ultimately, when the system finally found the right contact to dial it just finked out and reverted to a previous menu screen. Eventually, I got fed up and opted to dial by hand (while safely parked in front of our house) then use the Bluetooth hands-free function for my call.\n\nThe optional $4,200 Technology Package in the Elantra Coupe includes a large touch-screen navigation system and backup camera, along with Hyundai’s Blue Link (more on that in the Safety section below).\n\nCargo & Storage\nThere’s a surprising amount of space in the Elantra Coupe’s trunk (14.8 cubic feet), perfect for carting my girls’ large bags to and from their aerial cirque day camp (you’d think they were packing a troop of clowns by the size of their bags). The Elantra Coupe’s cargo space just edges out the Scion tC’s 14.7 cubic feet and beats the Kia Forte Koup (13.3) and Honda Civic Coupe (11.7). A 60/40-split folding backseat is standard for extending the Elantra Coupe’s cargo space forward.\n\nI found myself wishing for a trunk release button inside the car. Locating the trunk release button on the trunk itself isn’t always seamless, and it’s almost always grimy.\n\nSafety\nWhile the 2014 Hyundai Elantra sedan has been crash-tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the coupe has not. Likewise, the sedan was awarded Top Safety Pick status by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, but neither organizations’ results apply to the coupe. The Coupe does feature 4-wheel disc brakes and brake assist.\n\nThe Elantra Coupe with the optional Technology Package comes equipped with Hyundai’s Blue Link system and three free years of the Assured Connected Care program. This service provides a monthly vehicle health report, enhanced roadside assistance and automatic collision notification, which alerts first responders in the event of an accident. Hyundai owners can upgrade to other Blue Link packages that offer more services, such as remote door lock and unlock, remote vehicle start, car finder, stolen vehicle recovery, slowdown and immobilization — plus my favorites for teen drivers: speed alert, curfew alert and geo-fence.\n\nFor families with small children, two sets of Latch lower anchors and three top-tether anchors are in the backseat (although for the health and well-being of the parents’ backs and sanity, I wouldn’t recommend trying to regularly install child-safety seats in the back of any coupe). The lower anchors are wedged tightly into the seat bight, making them difficult to access for those using a child-safety seat with Latch attachments on webbing.\n\nThe seat belt buckles are on floppy nylon bases, making them more difficult for children with limited dexterity to buckle independently from their booster seats.\n\nSee all the Elantra Coupe’s standard safety features listed here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nRegardless of how hard others may try, nobody beats Hyundai for value in this class. Plenty of standard features, such as Bluetooth phone and audio, remote keyless entry and start, leatherlike seating surfaces and heated front seats are packed into the Elantra Coupe, while others cost extra. Add in Hyundai’s impressive warranty, and buying new rather than used suddenly starts to make sense from a peace-of-mind standpoint — but you’ll have to act soon before this short-lived Elantra body style vanishes from new-car listings.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nHyundai’s most popular model slots between the subcompact Accent and the midsize Sonata in both size and price. Revisions to the sheet metal and interior marked the 2004 models. A new instrument cluster was installed, and the 2.0-liter four-cylinder gained continuously variable valve timing.\n\nFour-door sedans are available in GLS and Limited trim levels, while the hatchback comes in GLS and GT versions. New for 2006, the Limited sedan includes beige leather seating surfaces and woodgrain interior decoration. An automatic transmission is standard on the Limited, which also includes fog lamps, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and chrome-insert bodyside moldings. A new Premium Package that’s available for all models includes a power moonroof, antilock brakes and traction control.\n\nExterior\nStrong character lines highlight the Elantra, which features styling that’s more chiseled and European than earlier models. The Elantra rides a 102.7-inch wheelbase, measures 178 inches long overall, stands 56.1 inches tall and stretches nearly 68 inches wide. GT models have a body-colored rear lip spoiler. A moonroof is optional. The Limited features a chrome vertical-bar grille.\n\nElantra GT models have a tauter suspension with higher-rate springs, gas-filled shock absorbers and larger-diameter stabilizer bars. All-disc brakes, fog lamps and 15-inch alloy wheels are installed.\n\nInterior\nEach Elantra seats up to five people. A three-place 60/40-split, folding rear seat augments the sedan’s trunk space, which totals 12.9 cubic feet. Standard equipment includes air conditioning, a CD player, cruise control, a tilt steering column, a rear defogger, and power windows, locks and mirrors. Remote keyless entry includes an alarm.\n\nA unique instrument panel in GT models holds purple-lit VDO gauges. The GT features gray leather seating surfaces and a leather-wrapped steering wheel.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 2.0-liter four-cylinder powers each Elantra. In states with Super Ultra Low Emissions Vehicle requirements, the engine develops an estimated 132 horsepower, but it’s rated at 138 hp in other areas. A five-speed-manual gearbox is standard, and a four-speed-automatic transmission is optional.\n\nSafety\nSeat-mounted side-impact airbags are standard, and antilock brakes are available.\n\nDriving Impressions\nEven though the Elantra isn’t overly enticing initially, it tends to grow on an open-minded driver and turns into an appealing little automobile. Performance with the manual transmission is surprisingly frisky, and the Elantra accelerates with spirit. Well matched to the engine, the gearbox and clutch permit gentle engagement for easy takeoffs. But putting it into Reverse can be a chore at times.\n\nExcept for a slight growl during acceleration, the Elantra is quiet on the road. It whips through corners with ease; some body lean is evident, but not enough to be troubling. Its suspension copes adeptly with rough spots, so the Elantra’s ride is pleasantly smooth for a small car.\n\nAttractive seats are firmly cushioned and offer very good back support. Backseat legroom is amazing, and even the center rear position isn’t too bad.\n\nHandling is a bit tauter on the fun-to-drive GT, and ride comfort suffers only modestly. The GT’s gauges are large, but their distinctive purple hue isn’t the easiest to read at night.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Hyundai Elantra?\n\nThe five-seat Hyundai Elantra compact sedan is stylish and well-equipped in a class with plenty of competition. Already long on value, the Elantra gets more standard safety features for 2020, along with improved fuel economy and added convenience features.\n\nThe front-wheel-drive sedan’s base engine is a 147-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder that works with a new continuously variable automatic transmission. The efficiency-oriented Eco trim level has a 128-hp, turbocharged 1.4-liter four-cylinder paired with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic. The Sport trim, meanwhile, has a 201-hp, turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder that also pairs with the dual-clutch automatic. Elantra competitors include the Honda Civic, Mazda3 and Toyota Corolla. The Elantra GT four-door hatchback is covered separately in the Cars.com Research section.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Hyundai Elantra?\n\nNew standard safety features include lane-keeping assist, forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking and a driver attention warning. Models with the 2.0-liter engine get a new CVT that helps improve gas mileage, while Eco models now have an engine stop-start feature. Dual-zone automatic climate control is also standard.\n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Hyundai Elantra Are Most Important?\n\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity is standard. All models but the base SE trim level get a 7-inch touchscreen multimedia system; a larger 8-inch touchscreen with a built-in navigation system is optional, as is wireless device charging, which is included on the Limited trim level. Other Limited features include leather upholstery, front seat heaters and an Infinity premium stereo.\n\n2020 Hyundai Elantra Vs. 2020 Toyota Corolla: How Do They Compare?\n\nBoth the Elantra and Corolla are solid choices in the compact class. The Corolla was redesigned for 2020, and is much improved with a nicer interior and better driving manners. The Corolla also offers a hybrid drivetrain. The 2020 Elantra’s new safety features make it more competitive, and it also has Android Auto, something the Corolla still lacks.\n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Hyundai Elantra?\n\nCompetition in the compact sedan class is fierce, but the Elantra remains a solid choice and this year’s additional standard safety features and fuel economy boost help keep it competitive. However, its bland interior could use a more substantial update.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in December 2010 about the 2011 Hyundai Elantra. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2012, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nEstimated mileage ratings have been lowered to reflect a November 2012 EPA audit of this car’s stated mileage.\n\nOne of the likely consequences of the federal government’s push for more stringent fuel economy standards is that more people will be driving smaller cars in the future. Not too long ago, with the exception of a few distinguished compact cars, that didn’t look like a very appealing reality.\n\nThat’s changed with the debut of efficient models like the Chevrolet Cruze, the upcoming 2012 Ford Focus and now the redesigned Hyundai Elantra. The Elantra has all the makings of a sales success: stop-and-stare styling, a fuel-sipping four-cylinder engine and an optimal blend of ride comfort and handling poise — all at a competitive price.\n\nIn short, the Elantra is a home run in the compact segment, allowing more drivers to happily enter a fuel-efficient future.\n\nThe 2011 Elantra sedan is available at Hyundai dealerships now and is offered in two trim levels: base GLS and upscale Limited. I tested automatic-transmission versions of both trims; click here for a side-by-side comparison of the two models.\n\nStyling\nThe redesigned Elantra makes a good case for being the most stylish new compact sedan on the market. The car’s designer, Cedric D’Andre, said one of the goals of the design was to create a car that was at least as sporty-looking as the Honda Civic, which still has a modern look even though it hasn’t been fully redesigned since the 2006 model year. Hyundai has definitely met its goal, as the Elantra’s styling is as dynamic as it gets in this class.\n\nLike the Civic, the Elantra’s front roof pillars have been stretched toward the front fenders, resulting in a windshield with greater rake. This gives the car a streamlined appearance, but the left pillar blocks your view a little when navigating winding roads. The car has the look of a coupe as the rear window stretches nearly to the tail, resulting in a short trunklid.\n\nBesides the appealing proportions, there’s also a bit of visual flair almost everywhere you look. Pronounced hood and door creases, arching fender flares and a trunklid lip spoiler all contribute to a level of sophistication that’s been mostly absent in compact-car designs, until recently. I’d been wondering what car was going to challenge the new Focus from a styling standpoint, and with the new Elantra that question has been answered — and then some.\n\nEfficiency & Drivability\nAutomakers have been racing to produce small cars that get great gas mileage using conventional engines, and Hyundai has succeeded on that front with the 2011 Elantra, which is powered by a new 148-horsepower, 1.8-liter four-cylinder that gets an EPA-estimated 28/38 mpg city/highway with either the manual or automatic transmission. And Hyundai didn’t sacrifice drivability to achieve those thrifty mileage figures.\n\nThere’s no denying the Elantra is a modestly powered car, but so are most of its competitors, including the Civic, Cruze and Toyota Corolla. There are times when you need to use a heavy foot to pick up the pace — like when merging on the highway — but the Elantra gets around well at city speeds and on rural roads. Even when revved high, the engine sounds refined, with no buzzing from the engine bay.\n\nAs gas mileage promises to be a big selling point for the Elantra, I wanted to get a sense of its real-world efficiency. In one leg of driving that totaled slightly more than 100 miles, my driving partner and I averaged 38 mpg, according to the Elantra’s trip computer. The route consisted of mostly traffic-free rural roads and urban freeways, with some city driving mixed in. The terrain was hilly, the air conditioning was running and neither of us altered our driving style to get better mileage. We were, in fact, hustling the car pretty aggressively.\n\nContributing to the Elantra’s thrifty fuel use and good drivability is its optional six-speed automatic, which is a new Hyundai-developed transmission. The automatic’s shifts are refined — even under hard acceleration — and quick. The transmission also doesn’t race to get to its highest gear — a fuel-saving tactic some cars use — which improves responsiveness. The automatic listens attentively to your right foot; jab the gas pedal when cruising, and it readily kicks down a gear. The transmission’s clutchless-manual mode is also quick to respond to driver-initiated gear changes, with none of the delay that plagues many of these systems and makes them unrewarding to use.\n\nRide & Handling\nBefore driving the Elantra, I had my reservations about its driving dynamics. Some of Hyundai’s other small models, like the Tucson crossover, don’t offer the best driving experience, and I wondered if Hyundai had figured things out with this car. After spending a day driving it in and around San Diego, it’s clear the automaker has. The Elantra’s combination of ride comfort and handling should please both everyday commuters and those who like to tackle a winding road now and then.\n\nI consider myself in the latter category, and Hyundai’s drive route — which took us close enough to Mexico that we could see the border fence just a few hundred yards from the road — provided miles of serpentine asphalt.\n\nOne of the most interesting aspects of the Elantra is how willingly it tackles curving roads. The car resists body roll, even when pushed hard into a corner, and lifting on the gas slightly had the effect of helping bring the tail through the corner more quickly, enhancing the car’s already nimble feeling. The Elantra’s suspension tuning makes it a sporty choice in the style of the Mazda3, which ranks as one of the more engaging mainstream compact cars available in the U.S.\n\nI also got a feel for the car in more mundane driving, like highway cruising. Here, ride quality isn’t as sensitive to rough pavement as it is in a Civic nor as isolating as in a Corolla, but it skews more toward the Civic. The ride is taut, but not overly so. Suspension rebound over dips and bumps is controlled, and there’s a solidity to the design that’s been missing in some other Hyundais, which have noisy suspensions. It’s also quiet enough in the cabin at highway speeds to hold a conversation without having to raise your voice.\n\nThe Elantra has electric power steering, and it doesn’t take much effort to turn the wheel. The car has very good straight-line tracking. The only time the steering seems to get a little flustered is in sections of continuous switchbacks where you need to turn the wheel back and forth again and again; there, the wheel feels numb.\n\nA Cabin That Matches the Exterior’s Promise\nThe Elantra’s exterior sets high design expectations, but the cabin gets a fair dose of style itself. It’s stylish in numerous ways, from the simple yet elegant ventilation system knobs to the slender control panel in the middle of the dashboard. The cabin is unequivocally modern — but not at the expense of occupant comfort.\n\nFor a small car, the front of the Elantra’s cabin feels spacious, easily accommodating my 6-foot-1 frame. The standard height-adjustable driver’s seat is a nice feature, and the seat went far enough back for me to sit comfortably. However, the steering wheel’s optional telescoping feature doesn’t extend far enough for taller people.\n\nBesides giving the cabin a unique look, the slender center panel opens up more room for your knees than many conventional designs offer. You don’t feel cramped in this car, and headroom is still pretty good in models with a moonroof — a feature that tends to rob space.\n\nThere was a time when roughly finished cabins were more common in this class, but refined interiors are becoming the norm, and the Elantra’s compares well with the best of them. It features mostly high-grade materials — some of which have interesting patterns — and good fit and finish. Hyundai even went so far as to give the Elantra’s fiberboard headliner and sun visors an upscale, woven-fabric pattern.\n\nA few minor shortcomings did crop up. Faux-metal trim is prominent on the dashboard and doors, and while the shapes of the pieces are interesting, their appearance isn’t that compelling. It also doesn’t feel that great when you have to grab hold of it to close the front door. The flat-black plastic surrounding the audio system looks a little low-rent, the center dash vents can’t be individually closed, and though Hyundai made the dashboard soft-touch, it neglected to do the same for the doorsill trim.\n\nThere’s no question I was pushing the limits of space in the backseat; when I sat down, my head touched the rear window (the Elantra’s 37.1 inches of rear headroom is similar to what the Civic, Corolla and Cruze offer). The Corolla and Cruze do have a few inches more rear legroom than the Hyundai, which has 33.1 inches, but I nonetheless had enough legroom in the Elantra — even with the front seat adjusted for me. The Limited trim has heated rear seats — an uncommon feature in this class.\n\nSafety\nStandard safety features include all-disc antilock brakes, side-impact airbags for the front seats, side curtain airbags and an electronic stability system. The stability system is part of the car’s standard Vehicle Stability Management technology, which also uses the electric power steering to help keep the car on its intended course.\n\nFor a full list of safety features, check out the Standard Equipment & Specs page.\n\nElantra in the Market\nThe recently redesigned Sonata family sedan has been a breakout success for Hyundai. It gave families a stylish, fuel-efficient, value-packed alternative to the traditional heavyweights in its segment, and consumers have taken note.\n\nThe smaller Elantra follows much the same formula. It’s affordably priced, has loads of style and sips gas. Plus, it adds a dash of driving fun, giving small-car shoppers plenty of reasons to choose it over one of the sales leaders. Like the Sonata, the Elantra is a car that will make people sit up and take notice — and competing automakers should, too.\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "A reader from Ithaca, N.Y., says she gets a kick out of reading our reviews of $90,000-plus dream rides like the BMW 750iL. But she also asks if we could critique more affordable vehicles.\n\nWe’re happy to say we recently spent a couple of weeks in one of the best values in the small-car market – the 1999 Hyundai Elantra GLS. Even with options such as cruise control, a CD player and rear spoiler, the Korean-made compact only cost $14,744. That’s several thousand less than a comparably equipped Honda Civic or Toyota Corolla.\n\nIn the past, we usually slammed Korean offerings with low one-star ratings. But we both agree, the Elantra is a solid, three-star offering that’s vastly improved over its predecessors.\n\nHe: I walked around the front of the 1999 Elantra and thought I was looking at a small Pontiac. And that’s no rap against this little Korean car. We’ve watched the Elantra evolve over the years, from a rather hum-drum econobox into a zippy and stylish compact that’s as good as most of its American-brand competitors. For less than $15,000, you get a more powerful engine and more features, in a car whose build quality seems vastly improved over earlier examples.\n\nShe: OK, so they’re finally getting the product right. Now comes another big hurdle. And that’s making Hyundai into an accepted brand name in this country. The lack of that acceptance so far, especially by the finicky youth market, may be the biggest problem with the Elantra. And don’t kid yourself, entry-level buyers want and will pay for brand names, the experts say, whether they’re buying cigarettes or clothing.\n\nHe: Let’s start with that new powertrain.\n\nShe: Don’t want to get into any of that retail revolution stuff, right?\n\nHe: I’m really a rebel at heart. I guess that’s why I like the Elantra’s new twin-cam 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine. It makes 140 horsepower, which blows most of the competition into the weeds. I didn’t even mind the optional four-speed transmission, which is one of the smoothest automatics that Hyundai has produced. The transition when shifting from reverse to drive, however, is still pretty brutal.\n\nShe: Here’s why we agonized over giving the redesigned Elantra three stars instead of four. The old model had plenty of wind, engine and road noise in the cabin. This one is improved, but there was still an annoying buzzing sound coming out of the dashboard at highway speeds. Anti-lock brakes are optional and you have to pay more than $1,800 to get them as part of an options package.\n\nSide air bags are not available at all, like they are on some Asian competitors. The seat fabric is finally up to American standards, but the seats only offered average comfort and the driver’s seat controls felt like an automotive Rubik’s Cube – confusing. Hyundai is so close, but doesn’t merit four stars just yet.\n\nHe: I give the company high marks on styling, engine performance and content. There are little things that still bother me. The turning circle is still huge for a car this small, making it a little difficult to park in a tight space. The brakes feel a little grabby in panic stops. And even with the driver’s seat cranked all the way down, I would still have liked another inch of headroom. Other than that, I don’t have much to complain about.\n\nShe: We can reassure buyers that the Elantra is getting better. And Hyundai backs that up by offering a limited bumper-to-bumper warranty for five years or 60,000 miles – better than the warranties offered by Lexus and Mercedes. Plus it offers a 10-year, 100,000-mile powertrain warranty. But some buyers still may not be convinced.\n\nHe: What will convince a lot of people is the bottom line. It’s tough to find this much car for this little money. I doubt that you could find anything in this price range on a Honda or Toyota lot. Even Saturn dealers will be hard-pressed to match the Elantra’s features on a dollar-to-dollar basis. Now Hyundai h to back it up with real customer service if it truly wants to compete with the big boys.\n\nShe: And the big girls.\n\n1999 Hyundai Elantra GLS\n\nAnita’s rating: above average\n\nPaul’s rating: above average\n\nType: Front-engine, front-wheel-drive, five-passenger sedan\n\nPrice: Base, $13,499; as tested; $14,744 (including $435 destination charge)\n\nEngine: 2.0-liter four-cylinder; 140 hp at 6,000 rpm; 133 lb-ft torque at 4,800 rpm\n\nEPA fuel economy: 22 city/31 highway\n\n12-month insurance cost, according to AAA Michigan (*Estimate. Rates may be higher or lower depending on coverage and driving record.): $1,266\n\nWhere built: Ulsan, South Korea\n\nWhat we liked: Super value for under $15,000; one of the most powerful engines in the class; roomy; lots of standard features on GLS; five-year, 60,000-mile warranty is better than the ones offered by Lexus or Mercedes; finally, fabric and upholstery that doesn’t look like it came from the Third World (Anita).\n\nWhat we didn’t like: Driver’s seat is complicated to operate; traction control not offered (Anita); anti-lock brakes are part of an $1,875 options package; no side air bags (Anita); automatic transmission is extra $750 (Anita); buzzing sound in instrument panel noted at speeds over 70 mph; clunky transition from reverse to forward with automatic transmission.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The redesigned 2021 Hyundai Elantra compact sedan would be excellent rather than good if not for its lackluster cabin materials. If developing a car was a marathon, Hyundai didn’t run the last mile.\n\nVersus the competition: For a mass-market compact sedan, the Elantra combines class-leading drivability with loads of user-friendly technology. Alas, its low-rent interior weighs all that down.\n\nFor 2021, the Hyundai Elantra sedan comes in SE, SEL and Limited trim levels, all with a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine. (The Elantra GT hatchback has been discontinued.) The first-ever Elantra Hybrid, meanwhile, pairs a smaller four-cylinder with electric assist; it comes in SEL and Limited trims. Finally, the Elantra N Line has a turbocharged four-cylinder and the lineup’s only manual transmission. (Note that a higher-performance Elantra, called simply the N, without the “Line,” remains in the works as of this writing.) All other variants have an automatic, which is also available on the N Line. Stack up the whole current group, or compare the 2020 and 2021 Elantra.\n\nRelated: Redesigned 2021 Hyundai Elantra Starts at $20,645; Here’s What You Get\n\nWe evaluated an SEL over the course of a week and also took brief drives in the Limited Hybrid and a stick-shift N Line. \n\nSE, SEL, Limited: Refined Drivability\n\nA confounding but age-old reality in our recent comparison between the Honda Civic, Nissan Sentra and Toyota Corolla sedans was the trade-off between ride quality and handling chops. Hyundai elevates both better than any car in that trio, as well as most other compact sedans. \n\nDespite a torsion-beam rear axle — a cost-saving setup versus the independent rear suspensions used by some rivals, including the Civic and Corolla — the Elantra rides impressively. Aside from some skittishness during mid-corner bumps, body control feels impressive for a mass-market compact sedan. Ditto for shock absorption: The suspension takes sewer covers and rutted pavement with a degree of sophistication reminiscent of a larger, or pricier, car — and that’s with our SEL model’s optional 17-inch wheels and P225/45R17 tires. With available wheel diameters ranging from 15 to 18 inches, it’s possible lesser versions of the Elantra ride even more comfortably. (All other things being equal, larger wheels generally diminish ride quality.)\n\nKudos, too, for the Elantra’s reflexes. Fling it into a corner and the nose pushes early, but the steering feels as quick-ratio as the Civic’s — still one of the best-handling cars in the class — with less of the outgoing Elantra’s vagueness. The wheel seldom feels twitchy on center even at higher speeds, and body roll is nicely contained through sweeping curves.\n\nUnder the hood is last year’s 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (147 horsepower, 132 pounds-feet of torque), which runs on a more-efficient Atkinson cycle; gone is the prior generation’s Eco trim and its turbocharged 1.4-liter four-cylinder. The 2.0-liter has reasonable power past 3,000 rpm or so, and Hyundai’s continuously variable automatic transmission is a motivated partner to get you there. Revs climb energetically from a stop, and if you need more power while already in motion, the CVT kicks up engine rpm swiftly enough to mimic a downshift from a conventional automatic. The 2021 Elantra is not particularly quick, but it does a nice job with what it has to offer.\n\nElantra Hybrid: Even Better\n\nThe Elantra Hybrid pairs a 1.6-liter Atkinson four-cylinder with a 32-kilowatt electric motor for a total system output of 139 hp and 195 pounds-feet of torque. It’s a handy combination, particularly on the torque side, to move you out from a stop. Unlike the many hybrids that employ CVT-like power-split devices, Hyundai’s system uses a conventional stepped automatic transmission — in this case a six-speed dual-clutch unit. The stepped gears bring a welcome sensation of upshifts and downshifts, though the downshifts arrive only after a long delay or hard stab on the gas. Sport mode provides much-needed accelerator responsiveness — there’s your downshift — if you don’t mind sacrificing fuel efficiency.\n\nThat efficiency is considerable, with 50 mpg in EPA-estimated combined gas mileage (54 mpg in a higher-efficiency Elantra Hybrid Blue edition). That’s up some 40% over the Elantra’s still-impressive EPA 35 mpg combined (37 mpg for the SE trim). Both figures are competitive against respective rivals; compare Elantra Hybrid mileage or the regular Elantra’s.\n\nThe Elantra Hybrid gets an independent rear suspension versus the non-hybrid’s torsion beam, but the differences are hard to pick out. I drove the Elantra Hybrid Limited back to back with an Elantra SEL, both with 17-inch wheels, over the same route. Both cars rode similarly well — more of a feat for the SEL’s simpler hardware, perhaps, but we preach results over formula. The results speak for themselves.\n\nElantra N Line: A Minor Letdown\n\nIf there’s any disappointment in how the Elantra drives, it comes with the N Line. Like the Elantra Hybrid, it gets an independent rear suspension, but tuning is stiffer all around versus the regular Elantra, with a thicker front stabilizer bar, as well. It shows: Shock absorption is notably firmer — though not objectionably so, as was the case with its Elantra Sport predecessor. The steering, altered here for N Line duty, augments the regular Elantra’s quick ratio with better feedback. Whether through chassis tuning or better grip (our test car had Goodyear Eagle F1 summer tires), or a little of both, understeer feels immediately better contained.\n\nSo where’s the letdown? It’s all in the N Line’s powertrain. The N Line packs Hyundai’s turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder (201 hp, 195 pounds-feet of torque), an engine we’ve seldom found responsive enough. Hyundai says peak torque comes as early as 1,500 rpm, but it’s only after notable turbo lag. The lag diminishes if you keep engine revs north of 4,000 rpm or so, which requires frequent work with the stick-shift N Line’s longish throws and muddy gates. Even then, the N Line never feels particularly quick. The optional automatic transmission is a seven-speed dual-clutch unit, so it might alter some of the power delivery. Alas, we didn’t evaluate it.\n\nTech Features\n\nSE, SEL and N Line models have two USB ports, HD radio and an 8-inch touchscreen with adjacent physical controls, including the must-have volume and tuning knobs. Impressively, the standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto both have wireless integration. Wireless phone charging — critical if you really want to go cord-free, as wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto can drain your phone’s battery fast — is optional, as are all-digital gauges.\n\nThe Limited trim comes with wireless charging and swaps the 8-inch screen for a 10.25-inch touchscreen. It’s a slick, high-resolution display, but it introduces some annoyances. Gone is the tuning knob, and both Apple CarPlay and Android Auto revert to a wired setup. What’s more, the larger display has a widescreen ratio that’s starved for height, so items like the backup camera image appear only on part of the screen. The navigation map and Apple CarPlay leverage the entire display, but I didn’t test Android Auto (I’m an iPhone user). Cars.com staffers with Android devices have observed display limitations in other Hyundai models with the automaker’s 10.25-inch display. See for yourself on a test drive.\n\nThe Fatal Flaw?\n\nFor all the Elantra’s strengths, the obvious flaw comes inside. It’s not space: The low center console affords a wide berth for the driver, and backseat knee clearance should suit adult passengers. Our independent accounting of cargo space found 19 cubic feet in the Elantra’s trunk, within 1 cubic foot of our accounting in the Civic, Corolla and Sentra.\n\nHyundai’s problem is materials quality. Even in the Limited trim, the upper doors, where your arms and elbows might rest, are all cheap hard plastic, as are most areas your knees touch. Things decline even further in the backseat, where the dollar-store treatment extends to the door armrests. The glove box opens with an undamped clatter; the headliner is mouse fur.\n\nAll of that falls in line with the prior-generation Elantra, no standout for cabin materials itself. But if you haven’t been in other compact cars, you’re missing out. The Civic and Impreza have a proper woven headliner. The Sentra offers soft-touch materials where your knees land, and almost all rivals have soft-touch door materials up front, especially in higher trim levels. The Mazda3 keeps it classy front and rear.\n\nThere’s potential to right the ship immediately. All major controls feel uniformly meticulous, unlike rivals like the Corolla. All Hyundai would have to do is swap in better materials immediately for a modest cost per car. Of course, the bean counters will multiply that by the hundreds of thousands of cars the automaker hopes to sell. You know how that ends.\n\nFeatures and Value\n\nAs of this writing, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has yet to publish crash-test results for the 2021 Elantra, but once the agency does, those results will appear here. Standard safety and driver-assist features include automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, a blind spot warning system and lane-centering steering.\n\nThe Elantra SE starts just under $21,000 (all prices include destination). That’s roughly competitive with rivals’ base models, most of which have standard automatic transmissions, as well. Standard features include 15-inch alloy wheels, the 8-inch touchscreen with wireless phone integration and the aforementioned safety tech. Finding an SE might be hard, however: As of this writing, just 12% of new 2021 Elantra sedans on Cars.com are SE models, and that’s with the Elantra Hybrid and N Line not yet on sale. Their eventual arrival will consign the SE to an even smaller slice of the pie.\n\nThe vast majority of current inventory is the next-up Elantra SEL (about $22,000), which adds larger wheels, dual-zone automatic climate control and keyless access with push-button start. Add options or climb the trim levels, and you can get leather upholstery, a power driver’s seat with memory, heated and ventilated front seats, the larger touchscreen, Bose premium audio, adaptive cruise control and Highway Driving Assist. (HDA augments Hyundai’s standard lane-centering, called Lane Following Assist, with additional capabilities on designated highways. Read more about the differences.)\n\nThe N Line runs about $25,000, while the well-equipped Limited (around $26,500) doesn’t have any factory options. The Elantra Hybrid, meanwhile, exacts a $2,650 premium for its SEL and Limited trims versus the same non-hybrid examples. As such, expect an Elantra Hybrid Limited to set you back about $29,000 — likely the highest sticker price most shoppers will see on any Elantra. That’s still a decent value, especially considering Hyundai’s impressive warranty and three years’ free maintenance.\n\nValue might drive many shoppers toward the Elantra, and excellent drivability should justify consideration even among the less budget-conscious. The downfall comes with Hyundai’s lack of investment inside, a peskiness that leaves the Elantra at four-fifths of great.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "For 2019, the Hyundai Elantra gets a significant refresh. Its powertrains carry over, but its exterior styling has gone from mild to wild. The new model also gets a revised multimedia screen as well as some new safety features; compare it with the 2018 version.\n\nThe Elantra competes in the bustling and busy compact sedan class against many vehicles that have been revised recently, including the Chevrolet Cruze, Honda Civic and Toyota Corolla; see them compared.\n\nNot So Fast\n\nIf you’re expecting pep based on the Elantra’s slick new styling, lower your expectations. It’s just … fine — far from thrillingly fast, but miles away from annoyingly slow.\n\nThe uplevel Limited trim I drove uses the base engine — a 147-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder carried over from 2018, again mated to a six-speed automatic transmission. The lowest trim level, SE, comes standard with a six-speed manual. With the automatic, response from a stop is prompt, and shifts are well-timed and smooth. Eco and Sport models are also available and again use different powertrains for 2019: a 128-hp, turbocharged 1.4-liter four-cylinder and a 201-hp, turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder, respectively.\n\nOn the highway, the Elantra feels planted and well-controlled. Its ride is firm and bumps are obvious, but neither of those is a big problem. What is a big problem is how loud it is; road and wind noise combine in an obnoxiously raucous symphony. Even the engine chimes in occasionally with a loud, overtaxed-sounding note.\n\nBy the numbers, the Elantra’s fuel economy is mid-pack. With the base engine and automatic transmission, the Elantra is EPA-rated 29/38/33 mpg city/highway/combined — similar to base, automatic sedan versions of the Chevrolet Cruze (28/38/32 mpg), Honda Civic (30/38/33 mpg) and Toyota Corolla (30/38/33 mpg). The Elantra Eco adds 2 mpg combined, while the Sport loses 4 mpg combined with the automatic transmission; it’s rated as low as 25 mpg combined with the six-speed manual.\n\nHandsome Cabin, Modern Tech\n\nThis is a value-minded compact car, so the cabin is nothing special to look at, but it’s well-made — materials quality is decent and the design is sharp. There are also some extra goodies on the Limited trim I tested, such as leather seats, wireless device charging and a premium audio system.\n\nNot only does it all look good, but the controls are also fuss-free. The Elantra has had a refreshingly easy-to-use multimedia system for longer than many class rivals like the Honda Civic and Toyota Corolla, and the new model’s setup doesn’t disappoint. The screen is large enough and placed high on the dash for good visibility, and the touchscreen is responsive with a logical menu structure.\n\nA 5-inch screen is standard on the base trim; all others get a larger 7-inch screen standard, with a newly available 8-inch screen option that includes navigation. I prefer to connect my smartphone and use Android Auto for maps; both Android Auto and Apple CarPlay are standard with the 7- and 8-inch screens, and they’re easy to use.\n\nCompact Room\n\nThe backseat doesn’t stand out in terms of headroom and legroom, but at 5-foot-6, I fit fine. Two child-safety seats had ample room in the backseat, and even with a space-hogging rear-facing car seat installed behind me, I had enough legroom in the front passenger seat. Check out our full Car Seat Check.\n\nIn terms of trunk space, the Elantra is again mid-pack. With 14.4 cubic feet of space, it trails the Civic and Cruze but offers a smidge more room than the Corolla.\n\nSafety and Value\n\nThe 2019 Elantra starts at $18,120, up $285 over the outgoing model but still lower than the Civic, Cruze and Corolla. Prices can escalate quickly, however: My Limited model stickered for $26,960 with extras like navigation.\n\nThe added cost includes some safety features on most models. The 2018 Elantra was well behind the pack on safety equipment; forward automatic emergency braking, lane keep assist and adaptive cruise control were available only on the Limited trim level. That’s improved for 2019, when all Elantras except the base model get standard forward automatic emergency braking, lane keep assist, blind spot warning and a driver attention monitor. Adaptive cruise control and forward pedestrian detection, however, are still optional, offered only on the Limited.\n\nThis is a big step forward for the Elantra, but it still has some work to do to catch the class leaders in the safety department. All 2019 Honda Civics, for example, get the Honda Sensing suite of safety features standard, and Toyota has equipped every Corolla with forward collision warning and automatic emergency braking since the 2017 model year. However, other vehicles, like the 2019 Chevrolet Cruze, continue to make many such safety features optional — and only on top trim levels.\n\nAlthough the Elantra will likely never find itself on the right side of cool, there’s a lot to like about it. Compact sedan shoppers face a large selection of comfortable and affordable options, and with the new Elantra, the list just got a bit longer.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "It’s hard to believe that 2007 marks the fourth generation of the Hyundai Elantra. Even more than the larger Sonata or smaller Accent, the Elantra arguably represents the company’s startling progress from the time it was introduced in 1992 to now.\n\nAs it has been from the start, the Elantra remains Hyundai’s competition for the Honda Civic and Toyota Corolla, as well as for domestics such as the Ford Focus (before that, the Escort) and Chevrolet Cobalt (before that, the Cavalier).\n\nThat 1992 Elantra introduced a feature that has served Hyundai well since then, and it had nothing to do with the car itself. The ’92 Elantra came with a warranty package called Value Care, which covered normal maintenance for two years or 24,000 miles. The powertrain warranty was raised to five years or 60,000 miles, up from three years or 36,000 miles. This showed the buying public that the company and its dealers had confidence in the product, and it translated into sales.\n\nAnd that was upped to what we have now: The Hyundai Advantage is a 10-year, 100,000-mile powertrain warranty, and there’s a five-year, 60,000-mile warranty on most other components. And there’s a five-year roadside assistance plan with no mileage limit. In 2004, parts of the warranty became transferable to a second owner. I submit that Hyundai’s generous warranty plan did more to advance Hyundai’s cause — not to mention resale value — than anything else.\n\nIt does not hurt that Hyundai’s quality has improved dramatically, as has attention to detail: It used to seem as though designers and engineers worked from a simple checklist, especially regarding the interior. “Radio buttons? Check. Climate control buttons? Check.” It didn’t matter if those buttons had the right look or feel — important distinctions that the Japanese learned a long time ago.\n\nThe 2007 Elantra is the best yet, adding two inches of width and 2.2 inches to the height over the 2006 model. This does, in fact, move the Elantra from the EPA’s “compact” to the “midsize” category, with more interior room than an Acura TL. If rear-seat passengers don’t mind the relatively flat, hard seat, there’s ample legroom. Up front, twin bucket seats are very comfortable. Seat quality is something Hyundai has long needed to address — and has.\n\nThe 2007 Elantra comes in three models: The base GLS, which starts at $13,395 — it’s pretty bare-bones, as that doesn’t include air conditioning. At the other end is the relatively deluxe Limited, starting at $16,895. In the middle is the SE, which is tested here. It starts at $15,695, and at that price has most everything I want: The only option was a set of $85 floor mats, and with $600 shipping, the sticker read a reasonable $16,380.\n\nStandard on all Elantras are four-wheel disc brakes with antilock, plus six airbags and active head restraint. The test car had air conditioning, cruise control, a trip computer, power locks, windows and mirrors; 16-inch alloy wheels, fog lights, a good stereo with six speakers, keyless entry, fog lights and a leather-wrapped steering wheel.\n\nThe transmission was a very smooth-shifting five speed manual. A four-speed automatic is a $1,000 option. The manual suits the car’s surprisingly sporty personality, and it works well with the 2.0-liter, 138-horsepower four-cylinder engine. EPA fuel mileage is rated at 28 miles per gallons city, 36 mpg highway.\n\nAs it always has, the Elantra delivers a lot for the money, but never has it been this roomy or this — well, sophisticated. It’s an economy car in price only.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2017 Hyundai Elantra has been redesigned with brawnier styling, more passenger room, better fuel economy, and loads of available safety and creature comforts. Bonus: It costs about $100 less than the outgoing model (see the two model years compared here.)\n\nVersus the competition: Compact sedans are the sneakers of the auto market: They’re practical, affordable and not very exciting, but they get the job done. Hyundai’s redesigned compact car kicks that stereotype — and many competitors — to the curb.\n\nThe Elantra competes against the similar body types likes of the Honda Civic, Ford Focus and Toyota Corolla. I’d choose an Elantra for its blend of value and comfort; compare them here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe Elantra was last redesigned for the 2011 model year, and the sedan’s sloping roofline and dynamic curves gave it an edge in a conservatively styled segment. For 2017, the design is big and bold, and previous buyers may not like the new direction.\n\nIt wears a version of the Sonata’s large, hexagonal grille and swaps its swooping curves for chiseled corners. The result is a more masculine look, but also a more premium one. Available LED daytime running lights that bracket the grille, as well as approach lighting that illuminates the door handles once the key fob is detected, add a premium flair. The Elantra looks right at home parked alongside an Audi A4.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe previous-generation Hyundai Elantra’s pleasant road manners were a highlight, helping it earn the No. 2 spot in Cars.com’s 2013 $20,000 Compact Sedan Challenge. The new model delivers a similar experience. The sole powertrain as of the car’s launch is a 147-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder paired with a standard six-speed manual or optional six-speed automatic transmission; it replaces last year’s base 1.8-liter engine. Though not exactly peppy, it’s sufficient from a stop, and the six-speed automatic quickly and smoothly spools out more power for confident highway passing.\n\nIn the mountains near San Diego, I found that the Elantra’s handling and maneuverability have improved. It’s composed in corners, with good body control and nicely weighted, reactive steering. A new Sport mode, standard on automatic-equipped cars, adjusts shift timing and power-steering assist for peppier takeoffs and an overall more engaging drive. At the other end of the spectrum, the sluggish Eco mode blunts acceleration to benefit fuel economy.\n\nFuel economy is up slightly this year but isn’t quite class competitive. Base, manual Elantras are EPA-rated at 26/36/29 mpg city/highway/combined; automatic models are rated a smidge higher. The previous gen’s 2.0-liter engine was rated 24/34/28 mpg. Base 2016 Honda Civics are still more fuel efficient, with a 40-mpg highway rating. A base Ford Focus is rated similarly at 26/36/30 and the Corolla at 27/36/31.\n\nWhere the Elantra needs work is in road isolation, which was also a struggle for the previous generation. Hyundai said sound-deadening material was added to the cabin, but a decent amount of road noise and vibration still filters in — though it’s not as loud as the rowdy Toyota Corolla. Similarly, the ride is again on the firm side; bumps rarely unsettle it, but even the small ones register.\n\nInterior\nThe cabin lacks inspiration. I tested the top, Limited trim and was underwhelmed by the materials and design. The leather seats were cushy and comfortable, and all the touch points were sufficiently padded, but the combination of utilitarian-looking hard plastics and flat, horizontal planes fell flat against the boldly styled exterior.\n\nThe interior may not match the exterior’s upmarket look, but the Elantra makes up for that with loads of optional features, many of which you’d expect in a premium-brand vehicle. New to the compact sedan segment is an available hands-free trunk: Stand behind the Hyundai Elantra with the key fob in your purse or pocket, and the trunk will open after three seconds (following an audible alert, in case you don’t intend to open it). Other available convenience features include two USB charging ports, heated rear seats and driver-seat memory.\n\nThe sedan grew a bit in length and width this year, and the gains are felt in the backseat, where there’s now more headroom and legroom. The Honda Civic and Toyota Corolla offer more legroom, but two adults will have sufficient space on the Elantra’s comfy, lightly bolstered rear bench.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe Hyundai Elantra uses an updated multimedia system with a 7- or 8-inch touchscreen, depending on trim (base SE models make do with a small, 3-inch display). Navigation is optional on the Limited’s 8-inch unit; it’s a straightforward system with a clear menu structure and responsive screen. Tuning and volume knobs, as well as home, radio and map buttons, make toggling between functions easy.\n\nOverall, the Hyundai Elantra is a much more user-friendly system than many competitors’, especially Ford’s Sync, in the Focus, and Honda’s capacitive touch-sensitive button and screen setup in the Civic. What’s more, Hyundai angled the screen and the larger climate controls below it slightly toward the driver for better visibility and easier reach.\n\nThe Elantra is the first Hyundai and the first compact sedan to offer both Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration systems. The systems seamlessly project phone apps on the car’s touch-screen. They’re standard on models with the 8-inch and 7-inch touch-screens — which don’t already include standard built-in navigation, unlike some other cars. I much prefer using Google Maps over any automaker’s navigation system, so it’s good not to have to pay for a feature I wouldn’t use. After plugging in my phone and selecting the Android Auto button on the car’s home screen, I was able to see my phone’s contacts, use Google Maps and launch Pandora internet radio within seconds. Apple iPhone users have a similar experience with CarPlay.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe Hyundai Elantra’s trunk shrunk by less than a cubic foot for 2017, and the change isn’t noticeable. With 14.4 cubic feet of space, it offers more than the Focus and Corolla but not quite as much as the Civic.\n\nIn terms of small-items storage, the Civic wins again with its enormous center console. The Elantra’s is tiny by comparison, but there’s enough room to hold small devices, like a tablet or phone.\n\nSafety\nThe 2017 Hyundai Elantra hadn’t been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration as of publication.\n\nThe new model offers many active safety features that most compacts don’t, such as an automatic forward collision braking system with pedestrian detection, lane-keeping departure warning and prevention, and blind spot warning. Where it disappoints is safety-feature availability. To get many of those features, you’ll have to first pop for the top trim level then select pricey option packages. All told, you’ll spend around $28,000 to get all the new safety features — a lot for a compact car.\n\nA backup camera is optional on the SE and standard on the Limited. Click here for a full list of safety features.\n\nValue in Its Class\nHyundai’s strategy always has been to emphasize value, and except for the pricey new safety packages, the new Elantra maintains that formula. The 2017 model starts at $17,985 including destination; that’s around $100 less than the outgoing sedan and cheaper than base versions of the Civic, Focus and Corolla. You can add an automatic transmission for $1,000. To get the 7-inch multimedia touchscreen as well as a backup camera, cruise control and heated outside mirrors, add $800 for the Popular Equipment Package.\n\nThe Hyundai Elantra always has offered compact-sedan shoppers a lot in terms of comfort and value, and the new model takes further strides down that road.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Hyundai is one of the biggest success stories in the automotive world recently, and it’s been fun to watch the Korean automaker’s evolution over the past eight years that I’ve been in this industry. People used to think of this brand as not only budget-friendly, but also dare I say cheap.\n\nToday, Hyundai cars are still considered budget-friendly as well as safe, well-built, cutting-edge and packed full of useful features and technology; the 2011 Hyundai Elantra is no exception.\n\nJump into the redesigned 2011 Elantra and you might think you’re in a midsize sedan. The fit and finish inside the car and its many features exceeded my expectations for a $20,830 car.\n\nThe Elantra’s 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine has enough power for getting around town easily, but while driving it from Denver to Telluride, Colo., I noticed a lack of power. There was a slight lag in acceleration when I tried to punch it to pass a semitrailer holding up traffic over a mountain pass. I also noticed a bit of floatiness in the suspension at highway speed, allowing bumps in the road to reverberate through the cabin for a second rather than being dampened out instantaneously. The manual sport mode option was a fantastic feature on my mountain drive, allowing me to quickly and smoothly downshift to help mediate speeds while coming down steep passes.\n\nI averaged 42.6 mpg during my trip to Telluride and back again at high altitudes. Given the Elantra’s incredible fuel economy, I’d happily make some small sacrifices to drive this affordable, stylish compact sedan.\n\nThe 2011 Elantra has a starting MSRP of $14,945. My test car, an Elantra Limited, cost $20,830.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe Elantra is a sharp, edgy-looking compact sedan. It elevates itself far above the competition of boring — yawn — beige budget cars. From the side, a sexy line slinks from the Elantra’s nose to the tail, flicking up and out at the end like the elusive cat-eye look that I and many other women are endlessly trying to perfect with eyeliner.\n\nThis grounded appearance also lends itself to a low-to-the-ground step-in height that is easy for kids to manage. For adults, just watch your head when getting in and definitely watch your baby’s head when lifting her into her child-safety seat.\n\nThe trunk had plenty of space for our two weekend bags and a huge shopping bag with room to spare. There was even enough leftover room that we could have stopped after all for the cool-looking welded iron flower that I saw, but my husband claimed “would never fit.”\n\nThe Elantra has a 148-horsepower, 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine. A six-speed manual transmission is standard on the base model. On the Limited trim, a six-speed automatic is standard. Both get an EPA-estimated 29/40 mpg city/highway and use regular gas.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nINTERIOR\nThe Elantra has almost everything I’d want in an interior and nothing I wouldn’t. Some cars today are packed full of frivolous technological features in an attempt to make them worth their price tag. The Elantra, on the flip side, has just enough features and not too many.\n\nThe center stack’s controls were easy to use, and their purplish-blue illumination at night was sleek, modern and soothing to the eye. Bluetooth phone connectivity and streaming audio were quick and easy to pair with my smartphone, though trying to navigate through my iPod’s playlists using the car’s controls wasn’t intuitive.\n\nThe Elantra’s fit and finish looks much more expensive than its $20k price tag. The Limited trim level’s standard heated leather seats in both the front and rear rows were a surprise at this price point. Gone are the days of cheap plastic interiors. The Elantra has a leather-wrapped steering wheel and soft-touch surfaces including leather door-panel inserts.\n\nIn terms of storage, the Elantra clearly isn’t like a minivan with every nook and cranny designed to store all the stuff families tend to lug around. However, there were just enough storage spaces to keep the necessities well-organized and safely contained. Door pockets were large enough to stash my iPad and extra water bottles for our long seven-hour road trip. The center console had a small storage bin as well as an armrest that could slide forward and back.\n\nFor my kids in the backseat, the center armrest folded down and had two more cupholders at just the right level for them to use while buckled into their booster seats.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair-Ample\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2011 Elantra has been named a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, though this safety award only applies to Elantras built after March 2011. To earn Top Safety Pick status, a car must receive the top score of Good in front, side, rear and roof-strength crash tests. It also must have an electronic stability system, which the Elantra does.\n\nThe Elantra also has standard front-wheel drive, all-disc antilock brakes with brake assist, traction control and six airbags, including side curtains for both rows.\n\nThe safety feature that was missing was a backup camera, which is optional. While I love the cat-eye-looking sweep to the Elantra’s rear, it does cut down on rear visibility.\n\nThere are two sets of lower Latch anchors in the Elantra’s outboard rear seats. I found them difficult to use because they’re recessed in the seat bight, where the back and bottom seat cushions meet. The floppy seat belt buckles also were challenging for my daughters to use.

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: Estimated mileage ratings have been lowered to reflect a Nov. 2012 EPA audit of this car’s stated mileage.\n  The new 2013 Hyundai Elantra coupe provides the same fuel-efficient driving experience as its sedan counterpart, and it doesn’t sacrifice much backseat comfort or cargo room.\n  The Elantra coupe is one of two new body styles joining the Hyundai Elantra lineup for the 2013 model year. The Elantra GT hatchback, based on a different, European platform, is the other. To see the body styles (two-door or five-door) compared, click here. The sedan is reviewed here.\n  The Elantra coupe starts at $18,220 including a $775 destination charge, but our uplevel SE test car’s price came to $23,870 with optional features. Competitors in this price range include the Honda Civic coupe, Scion tC and Kia Forte Koup; click here for a comparison.\n  Design  Hyundai rocked the compact-car segment a few years ago with its redesigned Elantra sedan, which brought a big dose of style to the market. Hyundai calls the design language “Fluidic Sculpture,” and it translates well to the coupe, which has a gracefully arcing roofline that trails off to a short deck lid. Hyundai took additional steps to make the coupe look different from the sedan, with angular fog lights and a piano-black bumper finish that gives an Audi-like impression.\n  Efficient Performance  The coupe accelerates well, readily keeping pace with fast-moving urban traffic. Power is similar to the Honda Civic. The gas pedal is sensitive, though, and it’s harder than normal to hold it steady, though I adjusted to it over time. The refined four-cylinder engine is an Elantra coupe highlight.\n  The optional six-speed automatic (a six-speed manual is standard) shifts smoothly and is always willing to downshift when you need more power. Whether you press the gas pedal partway down or all the way to the floor, the transmission quickly drops a gear or more. A lot of modern automatics make you wait a moment before heeding your call, so it’s nice to experience one like this.\n  With an EPA-estimated fuel economy of 27/37 mpg city/highway, the automatic-equipped Hyundai Elantra coupe is nearly as efficient as its sedan counterpart, which is rated 28/38 mpg (actual mileage may vary).\n  The automatic transmission includes an ActiveECO feature. The system is designed to smooth spikes in throttle application to improve real-world efficiency, Hyundai says. When ActiveECO is on, gas pedal sensitivity decreases, requiring you to press the pedal down farther when accelerating, but the drop-off in response doesn’t significantly degrade the driving experience.\n  Ride & Handling  The SE trim level comes with a sport suspension that Hyundai says has been tuned to the car’s 17-inch low-profile tires. You feel bumps and ruts, but true harshness is damped before it reaches the cabin. The Elantra stays flat in corners, but the ride is comfortable.\n  The car turns in quickly, giving it a nimble feel, and plenty of power-steering assist means it doesn’t take much effort to turn the wheel. On the downside, there’s little steering feedback, and what’s present has an unrewarding artificialness to it.\n  The Inside  The coupe’s cabin has the same design theme as the Hyundai Elantra sedan, with a distinctive control panel that ties the upper portion of the dashboard together with the center console. Despite the angular design, panel fit and alignment is impressive. The dashboard is made of soft-touch material, but Hyundai’s money would have been better spent on the upper door trim — a place where you might want to rest your arm — which is still hard plastic.\n  Manually adjustable front bucket seats are standard. They aren’t overly firm, and they’re wide enough that you won’t feel the side bolsters most of the time.\n  The amount of rear seat space is a pleasant surprise. From the outside, the coupe’s backseat looks tiny and cramped, but it’s actually quite roomy and comfortable — even for a 6-foot-1 passenger like me. Of course, it’s not as easy to get into the backseat as it is in the Elantra sedan, but the coupe really doesn’t give up much to the four-door in terms of comfort, and that’s impressive.\n  The coupe doesn’t lose any trunk space compared with the sedan, either, as both measure 14.8 cubic feet. The coupe’s standard 60/40-split backseat folds to reveal a large opening between the trunk and passenger area, enhancing cargo-carrying versatility.\n  Safety  As a new model, the Hyundai Elantra coupe hasn’t been crash-tested yet.\n  Standard safety features include antilock brakes and an electronic stability system, which are required on new vehicles as of the 2012 model year. Also standard are side-impact airbags for the front seats and side curtain airbags. A backup camera is optional.\n  For a full list of safety features, check out the Features & Specs page, and see how child-safety seats fit with our Car Seat Check.\n  Elantra Coupe in the Market  Mainstream compact coupes tend to stand in the shadows of their sedan siblings, and both Chevrolet and Ford recently dropped coupe body styles from their compact lineups following redesigns.\n  Despite U.S. car shoppers’ supposed dislike of hatchbacks, the body style has instead gained ground in the compact segment, with new sporty-looking models like the Ford Focus hatch and Elantra GT. Versatility is one of the most appealing aspects of a hatchback, and the Hyundai Elantra coupe impressed on that front, too, by retaining the sedan’s roominess. It represents another solid effort in a new segment for Hyundai.\n\n\n\n     Send Mike an email",
