      "expert_review": "Maybe it was the 2010 Hyundai Tucson’s redesign or the head-turning Kiwi Green color, but this compact SUV had me at hello. It’s such an attractive SUV that I decided to skip the rest of my housework when it first arrived at my house and take it out for a drive. Once I got into it, though, I was less than thrilled with what I found. It turns out the old adage –  it’s what’s on the inside that counts –  can be applied to cars as well as people.\n\nGetting settled into the driver’s seat, I wondered if the Tucson’s sheer value and exterior cuteness would be enough to win me over. The 2010 Tucson starts at $18,995. My test car, a GLS with four-wheel drive, cost $24,090. Tffhe new Tucson is a fantastic value, and, yes, the four-cylinder engine with a six-speed automatic transmission provided not only great gas mileage but more pep than expected. However, I couldn’t get comfortable in this car.\n\nI adjusted my seat every day, trying to find a somewhat comfortable position. What I found is all of the configurations left me feeling like my back and butt were hanging in midair without any support, while my head was pushed extremely far forward by the active head restraint.  I looked awkward, felt awkward and drove awkwardly as a result.  By the end of the week test-driving the Tucson, I was bringing a jacket or pillow into the car to use as lumbar support and never found a solution to my head restraint issue.\n\n \nEXTERIOR\n\nThe 2010 Tucson exterior is the perfect combination of sporty and adorable. From the side, the Tucson is sleek looking, with windows that swoop rearward into a point. This looks great from the outside, but it creates some blind spots for the driver. The body-colored door handles and mirrors look good; they’re part of a $1,700 options package.\n\nBecause it’s an SUV, my kids had to climb into the Tucson. While there weren’t any running boards, they managed it without any complaints. The liftgate opens easily to the cargo area, which is a little on the small side.\n\nMy four-wheel-drive test car had a 176-horsepower, 2.4-liter inline-four-cylinder engine that takes regular gas and gets 21/28 mpg city/highway. With front-wheel drive, this SUV gets 23/31 mpg.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Some\n\nINTERIOR\n\nThe Tucson’s interior is what I would expect for the car’s price: It has a simple look with lots and lots of hard plastic. My hubby couldn’t stop tapping the dash in various locations just to hear its clickety-clack sound. The interior didn’t blow me away, but it had all the necessities and they were well laid out throughout the cabin.\n\nThe five-seater’s cloth seats with leatherette, aka vinyl, bolsters looked good, but the driver’s seat was unbearable. Without enough support for my lower back and rear end, it was difficult to drive this car without subjecting my passengers to jerky takeoffs.\n\nMy kids didn’t have any complaints about the backseat. They had tons of legroom, and the cupholders were easy for them to reach in the fold-down armrest.\n\nThough I wasn’t wowed by the interior, I did appreciate that my test car had a USB port for an iPod and an MP3 jack. Both are part of a $1,700 options package. If I’d actually take my iPod out of the box and use it, I could have rocked out instead of focusing on the whole discomfort issue. If nothing else, the music would have drowned out my complaints so the kids could cruise in peace.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSAFETY\n\nThe 2010 Hyundai Tucson has been named a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. To earn the safety nod, a car must receive the highest score of Good in front, side-impact, rear and rollover crash tests. It also must have standard electronic stability control, which the Tucson does.\n\nThe Tucson also has standard four-wheel-disc antilock brakes with brake assist, traction control and six airbags, including side-impact airbags for the front row and side curtains for both rows. Four-wheel drive is optional.\n\nThis compact SUV has two sets of lower Latch anchors in the outboard seats. The anchors aren’t visible, but they’re not buried under the seat cushions, either. My sons’ booster seats fit well in the second row. The ample legroom means there’s room for a rear-facing infant-safety seat, but I would check the fit of the rear-facing convertible seat, which often need even more backseat room. A forward-facing convertible should fit in the backseat without any problems.\n\nGet more safety information on the 2010 Hyundai Tucson here.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in July 2014 about the 2014 Hyundai Tucson. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2015, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe 2014 Hyundai Tucson is a stylish, comfortable, surprisingly agile little SUV, but its size deficiency, mediocre gas mileage and worrisome crash-test ratings keep it from being a top choice.\n\nSmall sport utility vehicles continue to climb in popularity, and it’s no secret why. Cars like the new 2014 Hyundai Tucson provide the fuel economy of a compact car with the space of a tall station wagon, combined with the commanding outward view of a pickup truck. One of the Tucson’s competitors, the Nissan Rogue, has been at the top of our weekly most-read vehicle reviews post for months. Hyundai has updated its compact SUV for the 2014 model year, giving it some new direct-injection four-cylinder engines, new shock absorbers, standard Bluetooth, a reclining rear seat, LED accent lighting and a tilt/telescoping steering wheel with audio controls. See the changes from 2013 to 2014 here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe new Tucson doesn’t look all that different from the prior model, aside from some new wheels and a slight revision to the grille. Hyundai instead chose to spend its money inside and under the hood, on equipment and engines. The styling is still fresh, following the Hyundai family look with similarities to the Elantra and Sonata sedans. Light-pipe LED accents are available around the headlights, while LED taillights are optional. My test vehicle was a loaded Tucson Limited, and the included LED lights really added some pizzazz to the tail end. The Tucson looks good overall; it’s not as edgy as a Ford Escape or as butch as a Nissan Rogue, but it’s a clean design that will neither excite nor offend.\n\nHow It Drives\nUpdates for 2014 bring two revised engines to the party. Standard is a 164-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that comes in the base GLS trim. Upgrading to an SE or Limited will earn you the more powerful 182-hp, 2.4-liter four-cylinder, which was the motor in my test car. Both are mated to a smooth six-speed automatic transmission, with either standard front- or optional all-wheel drive. Power numbers are up slightly from the previous year thanks to the addition of direct injection, and the result is brisk acceleration without sacrificing fuel economy. Initial accelerator response is a bit jerky, throwing passengers back in their seats until you get used to it. There’s a bit of torque steer, as well, causing the steering wheel to pull left or right if you push hard on the gas from a stop. But with the smooth-shifting transmission and plentiful power, the Tucson never feels slow or ponderous, even with three full-size humans in it.\n\nRide and handling are astonishingly good. The Tucson drives like a larger, more expensive vehicle than it is. It’s quiet around town and under acceleration, with wind noise on the highway the only noticeable fault. Bumps are soaked up with minimal disturbance, with only some choppy motions on truly broken highway pavement upsetting the ride. It rides better than the skittish Ford Escape but isn’t quite as sophisticated as the Rogue’s big-car feel. Handling is tight; the Tucson feels nimble and quick, easily manageable in city traffic, and easy to park in a lot or on the street. In this class, however, quick handling is becoming increasingly common: the Escape, Rogue, Mazda CX-5 and Honda CR-V all handle well.\n\nThe Tucson’s gas mileage is not best-in-class; the front-wheel-drive Tucson I drove is EPA rated at 21/28/24 mpg city/highway/combined; my week with it included 300 miles of highway driving and netted only about 23 mpg overall. In comparison, the Ford Escape — with its much more powerful turbocharged 2.0-liter EcoBoost engine option — is rated 22/30/25 mpg. The Toyota RAV4 nets 24/31/26 mpg and the surprisingly miserly, yet fun-to-drive, Nissan Rogue comes in at 26/33/28 mpg (all figures are for front-wheel-drive models).\n\nInterior\nThe most recent update to the Tucson brought a full interior upgrade, bringing it up to the latest level of Hyundai goodness, and it puts the little truck solidly among the segment’s top competitors for comfort, style, utility and quality. The step-in height is surprisingly high, but the Tucson doesn’t feel like a high-riding car. The seats are flat but comfortable over long trips, and they feel larger than those in the Escape (but not as supportive as those in the Rogue). Switches are well-laid-out, and everything is easy to use and easy to reach. Visibility is good in all directions except to the rear, where the belt line’s stylish upturn results in small windows. This makes backing up challenging, especially if your Tucson doesn’t have a backup camera, which isn’t standard until you get up to the Limited trim.\n\nMy loaded test vehicle also had an optional panoramic moonroof, which, when open, creates an amazingly light and airy feel in the cabin. The rear seats have decent width and headroom, even with the moonroof, and legroom is plentiful. The Tucson has more listed rear legroom than any competitor mentioned here, but the numbers seem hard to believe. While the Tucson feels more spacious in back than a RAV4 or Escape, the Rogue feels like it has much more rear legroom than the Tucson. This may be an example of manufacturers not using the same criteria to measure legroom, as we have already demonstrated is the case regarding cargo capacity. The only blemish on the very nice interior is the rear-window wiper motor, which is ridiculously loud and sounds like a sick cow when in operation.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nHyundai has made the latest version of its Blue Link app manager standard in the Tucson Limited, and my test vehicle came with the optional Technology Package, which includes a 7-inch touch-screen, navigation, premium audio and more. Blue Link is easy to use but poorly organized; the home screen in particular is packed with icons that are difficult to find on the fly. Navigation is easy to use — inputing data is a trouble-free experience — but the map itself needs an update: A rerouting of U.S. 24 through northern Indiana that was finished several years ago still doesn’t appear in its present location on the navigation system. Bluetooth streaming audio is standard on the Limited, and my iPhone paired up without a problem.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThere’s adequate room in the Tucson for bringing along a good-size suitcase plus a small duffel or two, but this car maximizes passenger space, not cargo room. It’s a smaller car than its competitors, and it shows in the numbers: while the Tucson has 102 cubic feet of passenger room versus 98 in the Escape, 101 in the RAV4, and 100 in the two-row Rogue, it has just 25.7 cubic feet of cargo space behind the second row, as opposed to 34.3 in the Escape, 38.4 in the RAV4, and 39.3 in the Rogue. Fold the rear seats down, and the deficit gets even bigger: You get only 55.8 cubic feet of cargo space in the Tucson, versus 67.8 in the Escape, 73.4 in the RAV4, and 70.0 in the Rogue. That’s a difference that’s noticeable in normal use.\n\nSafety\nCrash-test ratings aren’t so hot for the Tucson. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gave the Tucson a four-star safety rating overall, but the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety noted some front-impact issues, giving the Tucson a rating of poor in several categories, including overall front-crash safety. See the results of the organization’s crash tests here and a list of the Tucson’s standard and optional safety equipment here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nOne area in which the Tucson shines is bang for the buck. A base Tucson GLS starts at $22,325, which is $1,670 less than the cheapest Ford Escape, more than $2,000 less than the cheapest Toyota RAV4 and about $1,300 less than the least expensive Nissan Rogue. My loaded Limited model started at $27,075 but added the Technology Package for $2,650 (which includes navigation and the panoramic moonroof). Once you add floormats and take into account package discounts, the total for my front-drive Tucson Limited was $29,835. Going the all-wheel-drive route would tack on another $1,500. Build a Tucson your way here.\n\nThe Ford Escape costs nearly $3,000 more for a comparable vehicle, but it does include more equipment, like a foot-triggered power liftgate (not available on the Tucson), premium audio, floormats and four one-touch up-and-down windows. Keep going and you can option up an Escape to a level well above what you can get in a Tucson, if you opt for the powerful turbo engine.\n\nThe RAV4 is also more expensive, with a comparable front-wheel-drive Limited trim starting at $29,180. There’s only one powertrain offered for the RAV4, as the V-6 model was discontinued for 2013, and the RAV4 doesn’t offer any special features over the Tucson. The Toyota is bigger and gets better fuel economy, but the Hyundai’s multimedia system is superior.\n\nThe more difficult challenge comes against the Rogue, which beats the Hyundai in nearly every category except price and power. A Rogue SL starts at $29,140 and also comes with only one powertrain — one that’s less powerful than the smaller Tucson’s, which you’ll really feel on the highway. Everywhere else, though, the Rogue outshines the Tucson: You can order a Rogue with three-row seating (in lesser trim levels), plus it has significantly better fuel economy, more comfortable seats, more interior space and considerably better crash-test results. The two are evenly matched on multimedia sophistication. Compare the Tucson with its competitors here.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Tucson, Arizona; where cacti emerge in spires from fields of desert wildflowers visually rivaling the most profound man-made sculptures; where the rich and famous travel to experience world-class spa treatments steeped deeply in Native American mystique. A lush desert oasis – an oxymoron, you say?\n\nThat is my thought exactly when hearing that the 2005 Hyundai Tucson could provide style, innovative safety systems AND value. It’s simply not possible – or so I thought.\n\nThe Tucson is Hyundai’s newest entry in the small SUV market. It’s built to compete with the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4. The exterior flaunts a sleeker and more sophisticated look than Hyundai’s other SUV, the Santa Fe. The interior seems a step up from the Santa Fe as well. Brushed aluminum accents on the simple control panel give the illusion of a luxury-brand price tag. Gas mileage in the Tucson is also an improvement over the Santa Fe (which is scheduled to offer a seven-seat model next year).\n\nThe rear seat boasts tons of legroom for adult passengers, but more importantly fits any type of child seat available; rear facing seats fit with room to spare so the front passengers can actually adjust their seats. The back seat splits (60/40) and folds easily. It also reclines, making it easy to adjust to the proper angle for child seats.\n\nThe Latch connectors are a bit tough to get to. I manage to use them the first time I install my daughter’s seat, but I have a very difficult time unlatching them to vacuum up the kid crud that’s accumulated under the seat.\n\nMy other two complaints are that the center rear seatbelt comes down from the ceiling and the seatbelt receptors in the back are flimsy. Note to car manufacturers: Call me and we’ll discuss the seatbelt buckle problem.\n\nBy far, my favorite feature of the Tucson has to do with Hyundai’s social consciousness with regards to safety standards. Since January 2003, every Hyundai built to sell in the US includes side impact airbags. The Tucson also includes curtain side airbags. Side impact airbags save lives, yet when they’re offered as an additional cost add-on many people opt to save their budget over their life. Hyundai recognizes that making these airbags standard is the right thing to do and simply does it. Hyundai, thanks for looking out for us even when we don’t look out for ourselves!\n\nThe Hyundai Tucson is a budget friendly way for small families to get it all – or close to it. A stylish car-like SUV with electronic stability control, 6 standard airbags, good gas mileage and cargo space that’s equally functional for strollers or sports equipment: All this for an entry level base price of $17,499 (note: base price listed below in specs is for the GLS version). Pinch me!\n\n*For more information on the Hyundai Tucson and its safety features visit Cars.com.\n\nLET’S TALK NUMBERS\n\nLATCH Connectors: 2\n\nSeating Capacity (includes driver): 5\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair – Ample\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair – Ample\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair – Great\n\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times",

      "expert_review": "I think I had a preconceived notion about what I would find when I drove the Hyundai Tucson. My thoughts were not very flattering; they mostly had to do with being cheap. I am pleased to say that I was totally off-base. The Hyundai Tucson I test drive is equipped with the Limited package. This top-of-the-line model rings up at just over $25,000 – not too shabby. The more I drive the Hyundai, the more little goodies I find, and the more I like it.\n\nIt starts with leather seats (only available in the Limited trim level), and continues with a long list of niceties: heated front seats; 6-CD, in-dash changer; and Shiftronic (automatic transmission that can shift like a manual if desired). Front, side, and curtain airbags are a major bonus in the safety department, as well as antilock brakes, tire-pressure monitoring system, electronic stability control and traction control, too. The list goes on to include a sunroof, fog lights and chrome accents. Lumbar support and adjustable headrests help me get very comfortable in what is quickly becoming a fun ride.\n\nThe V6 engine has power, but isn’t exactly peppy. That’s OK, most smaller SUVs seem to have traded some oomph for better fuel economy, and who doesn’t want that these days. The Tucson comes in with a very respectable 19 mpg in the city and 24 mpg on the highway and that is with 4WD. The 2WD model does even better with 22 mpg in the city and 27 on the highway.\n\nThe space in this car is comfortable, great for grocery runs, but maybe not the family camping trip. For a trip to the mall, yes; a trip to the national park, not so much. I could make it work if I were judicious with my luggage, but throw in a double-stroller and a Pack & Play and it would be uncomfortable. I’ll reiterate this though; for everyday use, point-A-to-point-B type stuff, the Tucson is really nice.\n\nMoreover, it’s cute too, not at all victim to the boxy and plastic-feeling exteriors of its competitors. The Tucson is comfortable and ergonomically sound on the interior, it feels cozy inside. Small enough to reach the back seat for any of the million reasons I need to, but large enough that no one is kicking my seat.\n\nNow a little bad news, The Latch connecters are difficult to use. They are recessed really far into the seat; I have trouble finding them at first. I finally realize that there is upholstery wrapped around the connector, leaving me with a pinky-width space to attach that buckle. I get one side hooked but I give up on the second until I can find someone who has tough hands and some patience to help me. Mother Proof noted this same problem on last year’s Tucson as well. Please Hyundai, help a mother out and fix this glitch!\n\nOn the plus side, the huge amount of legroom will fit a rear-facing infant seat or gangly teenagers, no problem. The rear seat also reclines, making it easy to get a snug fit and proper angle for just about any child car seat.\n\nThe entry-level Tucson goes for $17,495. It is not 4WD, nor does it have the V6 or leather seats, but it does include all of the same side-impact protection features of the more expensive Limited model – good job, Hyundai. I have to say I think I would be happy in this little gem. While getting me from A to B, it’s just as cute and functional as the Limited and well, if that isn’t what we think of when we hear the name ‘Hyundai,’ it should be!\n\nNote: Special Thanks to McDonald Automotive Group in Littleton, Colorado for letting me test drive a Tucson from their stock on very short notice. We really appreciate your help here at Mother Proof.\n\n*For more information on the Hyundai Tucson and its safety features visit Cars.com.\n\nLET’S TALK NUMBERS\n\nLATCH Connectors: 2\n\nSeating Capacity (includes driver): 5\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair – Ample\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair – Ample\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair – Great\n\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nWith the Santa Fe already in its lineup, Hyundai introduced a second, smaller sport utility vehicle for the 2005 model year. Hyundai developed the Tucson to compete against the Ford Escape, Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4.\n\nFor 2007, the Tucson comes in GLS, SE and Limited trim levels; it was previously available in GL, GLS and Limited versions. Other changes are minor.\n\nEither a four-cylinder or V-6 engine can be installed, and a manual transmission is available for four-cylinder models. Both versions can be equipped with front-wheel drive or optional four-wheel drive. Side-impact and side curtain airbags are standard, giving the Tucson a total of six airbags.\n\nExterior\nThe South Korean automaker says the Tucson has a masculine, athletic appearance. SE and Limited models feature bodyside cladding. Wraparound headlights and an LED-type center brake light are installed. A single-bar grille contains the Hyundai logo.\n\nAlloy wheels hold 16-inch tires. Fog lamps are installed on the SE and Limited, and a moonroof is optional. Riding a 103.5-inch wheelbase, the Tucson is 170.3 inches long overall and 66.1 inches tall (not counting the roof rack).\n\nInterior\nThe Tucson’s five-passenger interior includes a 60/40-split, flat-folding rear seat. The fully reclining front passenger seat can be folded forward. The plastic cargo floor has multiple tie-down locations. Cargo space is 22.7 cubic feet with the rear seat up and 65.5 cubic feet with the seat down.\n\nStandard equipment includes air conditioning, power windows and locks, heated mirrors, cruise control, keyless entry with an alarm, an intermittent rear wiper and a six-speaker CD stereo. The SE adds a leather-wrapped steering wheel and a stereo with CD and MP3 capabilities. The Limited model has leather seating surfaces and a six-CD/MP3 stereo. Tucsons have an easy-to-clean composite cargo floor.\n\nUnder the Hood\nIn the GLS, a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine with continuously variable valve timing delivers an estimated 140 horsepower. Either a Shiftronic four-speed automatic transmission or a five-speed manual gearbox can be installed. In SE and Limited models, a 2.7-liter V-6 engine — offered only with the automatic — generates 173 hp.\n\nThe available BorgWarner Electronic InterActive Torque Management four-wheel-drive system can divert up to 50 percent of available power to the rear wheels in response to changing road conditions or torque demand. A button lets the driver lock the driveline into a 50/50 torque split.\n\nSafety\nSide curtain airbags, seat-mounted side-impact airbags, Electronic Stability Control and all-disc antilock brakes with traction control are standard.\n\nDriving Impressions\nTucsons lean toward the cushiony end of the ride and handling spectrum rather than the sporty side. The ride is pleasantly smooth on most surfaces, but undulating pavement and even moderate bumps can transmit some roughness to occupants. The Tucson is easy to drive and requires little correction on straightaways, but handling is relatively humdrum compared to the Ford Escape.\n\nTire noise is noticeable on some surfaces, and some engine buzz is apparent in lower gears in models with the manual transmission. Otherwise, the Tucson is impressively quiet.\n\nThe seats are quite supportive and reasonably comfortable. Cargo space falls short of the Santa Fe’s, but the area is easy to access. Thick D-pillars block over-the-shoulder views a bit, but visibility is otherwise satisfying because of the long glass in the rear doors.",

      "expert_review": "The 2014 Hyundai Tucson is a stylish, comfortable, surprisingly agile little SUV, but its size deficiency, mediocre gas mileage and worrisome crash-test ratings keep it from being a top choice.\n\nSmall sport utility vehicles continue to climb in popularity, and it’s no secret why. Cars like the new 2014 Hyundai Tucson provide the fuel economy of a compact car with the space of a tall station wagon, combined with the commanding outward view of a pickup truck. One of the Tucson’s competitors, the Nissan Rogue, has been at the top of our weekly most-read vehicle reviews post for months. Hyundai has updated its compact SUV for the 2014 model year, giving it some new direct-injection four-cylinder engines, new shock absorbers, standard Bluetooth, a reclining rear seat, LED accent lighting and a tilt/telescoping steering wheel with audio controls. See the changes from 2013 to 2014 here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe new Tucson doesn’t look all that different from the prior model, aside from some new wheels and a slight revision to the grille. Hyundai instead chose to spend its money inside and under the hood, on equipment and engines. The styling is still fresh, following the Hyundai family look with similarities to the Elantra and Sonata sedans. Light-pipe LED accents are available around the headlights, while LED taillights are optional. My test vehicle was a loaded Tucson Limited, and the included LED lights really added some pizzazz to the tail end. The Tucson looks good overall; it’s not as edgy as a Ford Escape or as butch as a Nissan Rogue, but it’s a clean design that will neither excite nor offend.\n\nHow It Drives\nUpdates for 2014 bring two revised engines to the party. Standard is a 164-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that comes in the base GLS trim. Upgrading to an SE or Limited will earn you the more powerful 182-hp, 2.4-liter four-cylinder, which was the motor in my test car. Both are mated to a smooth six-speed automatic transmission, with either standard front- or optional all-wheel drive. Power numbers are up slightly from the previous year thanks to the addition of direct injection, and the result is brisk acceleration without sacrificing fuel economy. Initial accelerator response is a bit jerky, throwing passengers back in their seats until you get used to it. There’s a bit of torque steer, as well, causing the steering wheel to pull left or right if you push hard on the gas from a stop. But with the smooth-shifting transmission and plentiful power, the Tucson never feels slow or ponderous, even with three full-size humans in it.\n\nRide and handling are astonishingly good. The Tucson drives like a larger, more expensive vehicle than it is. It’s quiet around town and under acceleration, with wind noise on the highway the only noticeable fault. Bumps are soaked up with minimal disturbance, with only some choppy motions on truly broken highway pavement upsetting the ride. It rides better than the skittish Ford Escape but isn’t quite as sophisticated as the Rogue’s big-car feel. Handling is tight; the Tucson feels nimble and quick, easily manageable in city traffic, and easy to park in a lot or on the street. In this class, however, quick handling is becoming increasingly common: the Escape, Rogue, Mazda CX-5 and Honda CR-V all handle well.\n\nThe Tucson’s gas mileage is not best-in-class; the front-wheel-drive Tucson I drove is EPA rated at 21/28/24 mpg city/highway/combined; my week with it included 300 miles of highway driving and netted only about 23 mpg overall. In comparison, the Ford Escape — with its much more powerful turbocharged 2.0-liter EcoBoost engine option — is rated 22/30/25 mpg. The Toyota RAV4 nets 24/31/26 mpg and the surprisingly miserly, yet fun-to-drive, Nissan Rogue comes in at 26/33/28 mpg (all figures are for front-wheel-drive models).\n\nInterior\nThe most recent update to the Tucson brought a full interior upgrade, bringing it up to the latest level of Hyundai goodness, and it puts the little truck solidly among the segment’s top competitors for comfort, style, utility and quality. The step-in height is surprisingly high, but the Tucson doesn’t feel like a high-riding car. The seats are flat but comfortable over long trips, and they feel larger than those in the Escape (but not as supportive as those in the Rogue). Switches are well-laid-out, and everything is easy to use and easy to reach. Visibility is good in all directions except to the rear, where the belt line’s stylish upturn results in small windows. This makes backing up challenging, especially if your Tucson doesn’t have a backup camera, which isn’t standard until you get up to the Limited trim.\n\nMy loaded test vehicle also had an optional panoramic moonroof, which, when open, creates an amazingly light and airy feel in the cabin. The rear seats have decent width and headroom, even with the moonroof, and legroom is plentiful. The Tucson has more listed rear legroom than any competitor mentioned here, but the numbers seem hard to believe. While the Tucson feels more spacious in back than a RAV4 or Escape, the Rogue feels like it has much more rear legroom than the Tucson. This may be an example of manufacturers not using the same criteria to measure legroom, as we have already demonstrated is the case regarding cargo capacity. The only blemish on the very nice interior is the rear-window wiper motor, which is ridiculously loud and sounds like a sick cow when in operation.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nHyundai has made the latest version of its Blue Link app manager standard in the Tucson Limited, and my test vehicle came with the optional Technology Package, which includes a 7-inch touch-screen, navigation, premium audio and more. Blue Link is easy to use but poorly organized; the home screen in particular is packed with icons that are difficult to find on the fly. Navigation is easy to use — inputing data is a trouble-free experience — but the map itself needs an update: A rerouting of U.S. 24 through northern Indiana that was finished several years ago still doesn’t appear in its present location on the navigation system. Bluetooth streaming audio is standard on the Limited, and my iPhone paired up without a problem.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThere’s adequate room in the Tucson for bringing along a good-size suitcase plus a small duffel or two, but this car maximizes passenger space, not cargo room. It’s a smaller car than its competitors, and it shows in the numbers: while the Tucson has 102 cubic feet of passenger room versus 98 in the Escape, 101 in the RAV4, and 100 in the two-row Rogue, it has just 25.7 cubic feet of cargo space behind the second row, as opposed to 34.3 in the Escape, 38.4 in the RAV4, and 39.3 in the Rogue. Fold the rear seats down, and the deficit gets even bigger: You get only 55.8 cubic feet of cargo space in the Tucson, versus 67.8 in the Escape, 73.4 in the RAV4, and 70.0 in the Rogue. That’s a difference that’s noticeable in normal use.\n\nSafety\nCrash-test ratings aren’t so hot for the Tucson. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gave the Tucson a four-star safety rating overall, but the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety noted some front-impact issues, giving the Tucson a rating of poor in several categories, including overall front-crash safety. See the results of the organization’s crash tests here and a list of the Tucson’s standard and optional safety equipment here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nOne area in which the Tucson shines is bang for the buck. A base Tucson GLS starts at $22,325, which is $1,670 less than the cheapest Ford Escape, more than $2,000 less than the cheapest Toyota RAV4 and about $1,300 less than the least expensive Nissan Rogue. My loaded Limited model started at $27,075 but added the Technology Package for $2,650 (which includes navigation and the panoramic moonroof). Once you add floormats and take into account package discounts, the total for my front-drive Tucson Limited was $29,835. Going the all-wheel-drive route would tack on another $1,500.\n\nThe Ford Escape costs nearly $3,000 more for a comparable vehicle, but it does include more equipment, like a foot-triggered power liftgate (not available on the Tucson), premium audio, floormats and four one-touch up-and-down windows. Keep going and you can option up an Escape to a level well above what you can get in a Tucson, if you opt for the powerful turbo engine.\n\nThe RAV4 is also more expensive, with a comparable front-wheel-drive Limited trim starting at $29,180. There’s only one powertrain offered for the RAV4, as the V-6 model was discontinued for 2013, and the RAV4 doesn’t offer any special features over the Tucson. The Toyota is bigger and gets better fuel economy, but the Hyundai’s multimedia system is superior.\n\nThe more difficult challenge comes against the Rogue, which beats the Hyundai in nearly every category except price and power. A Rogue SL starts at $29,140 and also comes with only one powertrain — one that’s less powerful than the smaller Tucson’s, which you’ll really feel on the highway. Everywhere else, though, the Rogue outshines the Tucson: You can order a Rogue with three-row seating (in lesser trim levels), plus it has significantly better fuel economy, more comfortable seats, more interior space and considerably better crash-test results. The two are evenly matched on multimedia sophistication. Compare the Tucson with its competitors here.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: Estimated mileage ratings have been lowered to reflect a November 2012 EPA audit of this car’s stated mileage.\n\nWith its good looks and plenty of features, the 2012 Hyundai Tucson keeps pace in the compact SUV field, but its tight interior and stiff ride may deter some buyers.\n\nThe Tucson was last redesigned in 2010. (You can compare the 2011 with the 2012 model here.) The most obvious change for 2012 is the addition of an Active Eco button that changes engine and transmission response to get better mileage, but there’s also an improved air-conditioning system, among other updates.\n\nHyundai offers three versions of the Tucson — GL, GLS and the Limited trim level — and three different engines: a 176-horsepower, 2.4-liter four-cylinder; a 170-hp, 2.4-liter four-cylinder; and a 165-hp, 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine. It’s offered with either FWD or AWD and with a five-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission. Our test model was a Limited trim with the larger, 2.4-liter engine and a six-speed automatic mated to front-wheel drive.\n\nThe Ride\nThere’s no getting around it: The Hyundai Tucson rides firmly. You’ll feel every ripple in the road, and every pothole will register through the chassis. Our test model came with the largest alloy wheels and tires — 18 inches — and while that can affect ride, the overall sensation is that of a car that doesn’t absorb bumps as much as it bounces over them.\n\nYou don’t get a crashing or banging sensation that makes you think you’ve broken something, so it’s not the worst car out there in this respect, but this is the area where Hyundai needs to do the most work. It’s the Tucson attribute that stands out the most, and the fact that it’s not a positive one is not good.\n\nThe biggest problem Hyundai has is that many competitors — most notably the 2013 Mazda CX-5 and the 2013 Ford Escape — achieve better ride quality. (See them compared.)\n\nDriving\nDespite (or perhaps because of) its stiff ride, the Hyundai Tucson still manages to be decent to drive.\n\nOn very smooth roads, the Hyundai handles pretty well for a small SUV. It doesn’t wallow around like other cars can, and it’s able to take tight turns fairly quickly. There’s some hopping when you hit a bump at a higher speed, though, so it does demand an attentive driver.\n\nWhile it didn’t blow me away, the drivetrain provided good power off the line, and I was able to pass easily on the highway. Take note, though: Hyundai says the Active Eco mode “modifies engine and transmission controls to improve gas mileage.” I’d say it this way: “Pressing the Active Eco button takes whatever fun there is in driving the Tucson right out of the equation.” But, of course, one doesn’t have to press that button. Hyundai says its EPA mileage estimates are calculated with Active Eco turned off; the feature is intended to improve that mileage. Mileage is as follows.\n\nEPA-Estimated Gas Mileages*\nEngine\tTransmission\tCity/Highway MPG\tDrive\n2.0-liter\t5-speed manual\t20/26\t2WD\n2.0-liter\t6-speed auto\t22/29\t2WD\n2.4-liter\t6-speed auto\t21/30\t2WD\n2.4-liter\t6-speed auto\t20/27\tAWD\n*Mileage ratings have been lowered to reflect a Nov. 2012 EPA audit of this car’s stated mileage\n\nThe steering provides good feedback for a small SUV, but it’s not so heavy that it’s a chore to steer around a parking lot. Other editors described the Hyundai Tucson’s steering as being a bit numb, but I thought it was fine for this vehicle class.\n\nFinally, rear visibility is not the greatest. The rear window is small and it sits very high in the rear hatch, leaving a large blind spot directly behind the Hyundai Tucson. A backup camera is optional, but it’s part of a package that runs more than $2,500 and includes a panoramic moonroof.\n\nStill, given how bad visibility is, it’s an option package I would seriously consider. I mean, visibility is livable on the highway, but as soon as I got in parking lots or around smaller people and children, I wanted the camera more. Here, again, other small SUVs do it better. Two Subarus — the Outback and Forester — stand out as leaders in this pack.\n\nInterior\nThe Tucson looks good on the inside. Not only do the surfaces and materials look good, they feel good as well. The rotary climate control dials felt a little light and a little cheap, as did the controls on the turn-signal stalk, but overall there were more hits than misses.\n\nAs you’d expect in a top-of-the-line model, the Hyundai Tucson Limited comes well-equipped, with leather seats, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift lever, heated front seats, keyless entry, steering-wheel audio controls, a tilt/telescoping steering wheel and USB/MP3 jacks.\n\nIf you opt for the lowest, GL, trim, you get cloth upholstery, USB/MP3 jacks and a 60/40-split folding backseat, but you lose the heated seats, dual-zone climate control and steering-wheel audio controls. The midlevel trim, the GLS, makes some of those features either standard or optional. Compare the trims and their differences here.\n\nThere are drawbacks to the interior. For one, the backseat area is fairly tight. Taller folks will find themselves wanting legroom unless the front passenger is willing to cede some space. Headroom in the backseat is OK, but the roofline is very low, making it possible for taller folks to bang their heads when exiting.\n\nAlso, the cargo area isn’t exceptionally large. It trails other small SUVs — notably the Chevrolet Equinox and Honda CR-V — in cargo volume. I’d expect a tight fit for families and their luggage if they’re planning a long road trip. Also, shorter folks could find the cargo area’s load height to be just a bit too high.\n\nSafety & Reliability\nThe 2012 Hyundai Tucson is an Insurance Institute for Highway Safety Top Safety Pick, meaning it scored IIHS’ highest rating, Good, in front and side crash tests, a roof-strength test, and evaluations of seat/head restraints for protection against neck injuries in rear impacts.\n\nAll Hyundai Tucsons come with side-impact airbags for the front seats and side curtain airbags, as well as two frontal airbags and active front head restraints. As is required of all new vehicles beginning with the 2012 model year, it also has a standard electronic stability system, traction control and antilock brakes. See the full list of standard safety features here.\n\nTo see how various child-safety seats fit in the Tucson, view the Car Seat Check.\n\nThe 2012 Hyundai Tucson is predicted to have average reliability.\n\nTucson in the Market\nThe Tucson competes in a crowded field. Nearly every automaker, from the most high-end luxury makes to the bargain-budgeted companies, makes a small SUV.\n\nOverall, the high points for the Tucson are its looks, the number of features for the price and drivetrain performance, in roughly that order. Where it stumbles is with its ride and interior size.\n\nThe issue Hyundai faces is that, in such a tough market, if everything is not exactly perfect for a buyer, there are plenty of other choices. I question if there’s enough in the Hyundai Tucson to make buyers choose it over the others. It’s a case of something that’s “not bad” quite possibly being not “good enough.” Because its competition has left “good enough” behind.\n\nSend Bill an email",

For 2026, Hyundai limited itself to shuffling the compact SUV’s content and adding only a few relatively minor features.\n\nA new Blue SE trim lowers the price of entry for the hybrid Tucson, the gas model’s towing capacity increases to 2,750 pounds, and the adventure-oriented XRT trim gains Terrain Mode settings that optimize various systems for driving in mud, snow and sand.\n\nRelated: 2025 Hyundai Tucson Review: Smart, Subtle Changes\n\nRelease Date and Pricing\n\nThe gas-only 2026 Hyundai Tucson is on sale now; the hybrid and plug-in hybrid will arrive at dealers later. Full pricing is as follows:\n\nTucson\nSE: $30,800\nSEL: $32,150\nXRT: $34,825\nSEL Premium: $35,150\nLimited: $40,775\nTucson Hybrid\nBlue SE: $33,800\nSEL: $35,250\nSEL Convenience: $36,250\nLimited: $43,425\nTucson Plug-in Hybrid\nSEL: $41,675\nLimited: $49,900\nTrim Levels\n\nBoth the regular Tucson SE and hybrid Blue SE include keyless entry and start, 17-inch wheels and LED front lighting. Interior features include cloth upholstery, manually adjustable front seats, six speakers and a 12.3-inch touchscreen with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Standard safety technologies include forward collision warning with pedestrian and bicyclist detection, automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, lane-centering steering, blind spot monitors, rear cross-traffic alert and a driver-attention monitor.\n\nRegardless of powertrain, all Tucson SELs gain 18-inch wheels, a hands-free power liftgate and heated side mirrors. Their cabins are upgraded with a power-adjustable driver’s seat, heated front seats and dual-zone automatic climate control.\n\nAvailable only on the gas-only Tucson, the XRT trim goes for an off-roady look with black lower-body cladding and exterior trim, black window and roof-pillar trim, a dark-chrome grille and LED taillights. It also features the Terrain Mode drive-mode selector, synthetic leather upholstery and ambient lighting.\n\nThe SEL Premium includes the XRT’s luxury content but forgoes the exterior appearance stuff in favor of a moonroof, navigation with voice control, a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, wireless phone charging and Hyundai’s Digital Key 2, which allows owners to use their smartphone or -watch as a key and to remotely monitor the vehicle.

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in August 2012 about the 2012 Hyundai Tucson. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2013, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nEstimated mileage ratings have been lowered to reflect a November 2012 EPA audit of this car’s stated mileage.\n\n\nWith its good looks and plenty of features, the 2012 Hyundai Tucson keeps pace in the compact SUV field, but its tight interior and stiff ride may deter some buyers.\n\nThe Tucson was last redesigned in 2010. (You can compare the 2011 with the 2012 model here.) The most obvious change for 2012 is the addition of an Active Eco button that changes engine and transmission response to get better mileage, but there’s also an improved air-conditioning system, among other updates.\n\nHyundai offers three versions of the Tucson — GL, GLS and the Limited trim level — and three different engines: a 176-horsepower, 2.4-liter four-cylinder; a 170-hp, 2.4-liter four-cylinder; and a 165-hp, 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine. It’s offered with either front- or all-wheel drive and with a five-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission. Our test model was a Limited trim with the larger, 2.4-liter engine and a six-speed automatic mated to front-wheel drive.\n\nThe Ride\nThere’s no getting around it: The Tucson rides firmly. You’ll feel every ripple in the road, and every pothole will register through the chassis. Our test model came with the largest wheels — 18 inches — and while that can affect ride, the overall sensation is that of a car that doesn’t absorb bumps as much as it bounces over them.\n\nYou don’t get a crashing or banging sensation that makes you think you’ve broken something, so it’s not the worst car out there in this respect, but this is the area where Hyundai needs to do the most work. It’s the Tucson attribute that stands out the most, and the fact that it’s not a positive one is not good.\n\nThe biggest problem Hyundai has is that many competitors — most notably the 2013 Mazda CX-5 and the 2013 Ford Escape — achieve better ride quality. (See them compared.)\n\nDriving\nDespite (or perhaps because of) its stiff ride, the Hyundai Tucson still manages to be decent to drive.\n\nOn very smooth roads, the Hyundai handles pretty well for a small SUV. It doesn’t wallow around like other cars can, and it’s able to take tight turns fairly quickly. There’s some hopping when you hit a bump at a higher speed, though, so it does demand an attentive driver.\n\nWhile it didn’t blow me away, the drivetrain provided good power off the line, and I was able to pass easily on the highway. Take note, though: Hyundai says the Active Eco mode “modifies engine and transmission controls to improve gas mileage.” I’d say it this way: “Pressing the Active Eco button takes whatever fun there is in driving the Tucson right out of the equation.” But, of course, one doesn’t have to press that button. Hyundai says its EPA mileage estimates are calculated with Active Eco turned off; the feature is intended to improve that mileage. Mileage is as follows.\n\nEPA-Estimated Gas Mileages*\nEngine\tTransmission\tCity/Highway MPG\tDrive\n2.0-liter\t5-speed manual\t20/26\t2WD\n2.0-liter\t6-speed auto\t22/29\t2WD\n2.4-liter\t6-speed auto\t21/30\t2WD\n2.4-liter\t6-speed auto\t20/287\tAWD\n*Mileage ratings have been lowered to reflect a Nov. 2012 EPA audit of this car’s stated mileage\n\nThe steering provides good feedback for a small SUV, but it’s not so heavy that it’s a chore to steer around a parking lot. Other editors described the Tucson’s steering as being a bit numb, but I thought it was fine for this vehicle class.\n\nFinally, rear visibility is not the greatest. The rear window is small and it sits very high in the rear hatch, leaving a large blind spot directly behind the Tucson. A backup camera is optional, but it’s part of a package that runs more than $2,500 and includes a panoramic moonroof.\n\nStill, given how bad visibility is, it’s an option package I would seriously consider. I mean, visibility is livable on the highway, but as soon as I got in parking lots or around smaller people and children, I wanted the camera more. Here, again, other small SUVs do it better. Two Subarus — the Outback and Forester — stand out as leaders in this pack.\n\nInterior\nThe Tucson looks good on the inside. Not only do the surfaces and materials look good, they feel good as well. The rotary climate control dials felt a little light and a little cheap, as did the controls on the turn-signal stalk, but overall there were more hits than misses.\n\nAs you’d expect in a top-of-the-line model, the Tucson Limited comes well-equipped, with leather seats, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift lever, heated front seats, keyless entry, steering-wheel audio controls, a tilt/telescoping steering wheel and USB/MP3 jacks.\n\nIf you opt for the lowest, GL, trim, you get cloth upholstery, USB/MP3 jacks and a 60/40-split folding backseat, but you lose the heated seats, dual-zone climate control and steering-wheel audio controls. The midlevel trim, the GLS, makes some of those features either standard or optional. Compare the trims and their differences here.\n\nThere are drawbacks to the interior. For one, the backseat area is fairly tight. Taller folks will find themselves wanting legroom unless the front passenger is willing to cede some space. Headroom in the backseat is OK, but the roofline is very low, making it possible for taller folks to bang their heads when exiting.\n\nAlso, the cargo area isn’t exceptionally large. It trails other small SUVs — notably the Chevrolet Equinox and Honda CR-V — in cargo volume. I’d expect a tight fit for families and their luggage if they’re planning a long road trip. Also, shorter folks could find the cargo area’s load height to be just a bit too high.\n\nSafety & Reliability\nThe 2012 Hyundai Tucson is an Insurance Institute for Highway Safety Top Safety Pick, meaning it scored IIHS’ highest rating, Good, in front and side crash tests, a roof-strength test, and evaluations of seat/head restraints for protection against neck injuries in rear impacts.\n\nAll Tucsons come with side-impact airbags for the front seats and side curtain airbags, as well as two frontal airbags and active front head restraints. As is required of all new vehicles beginning with the 2012 model year, it also has a standard electronic stability system, traction control and antilock brakes. See the full list of standard safety features here.\n\nTo see how various child-safety seats fit in the Tucson, view the Car Seat Check.\n\nThe 2012 Hyundai Tucson is predicted to have average reliability.\n\nTucson in the Market\nThe Tucson competes in a crowded field. Nearly every automaker, from the most high-end luxury makes to the bargain-budgeted companies, makes a small SUV. (Compare the Hyundai with competitors here.)\n\nOverall, the high points for the Tucson are its looks, the number of features for the price and drivetrain performance, in roughly that order. Where it stumbles is with its ride and interior size.\n\nThe issue Hyundai faces is that, in such a tough market, if everything is not exactly perfect for a buyer, there are plenty of other choices. I question if there’s enough in the Hyundai Tucson to make buyers choose it over the others. It’s a case of something that’s “not bad” quite possibly being not “good enough.” Because its competition has left “good enough” behind.\n\nSend Bill an email",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Hyundai Tucson?\n\nThe 2023 Hyundai Tucson is a five-seat compact SUV that competes with the likes of the Chevrolet Equinox, Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4 and Kia Sportage. Powering the base Tucson is an efficient 187-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder that’s paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission. Front- and all-wheel drive are available. If electrification is your thing, consider the fuel-sipping hybrid and plug-in hybrid variants. Each delivers a significant boost in mpg, and the Tucson PHEV has the added bonus of 32 miles of electric-only driving range. Both hybrids are also notably peppier than the regular gas-engine Tucson: They’re powered by a turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder powertrain that helps make 226 hp combined in the hybrid and 261 hp combined in the plug-in hybrid.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Hyundai Tucson?\n\nSave some reshuffling of features among trim levels, the Hyundai Tucson is a carryover model that enters the 2023 model year with no major changes.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Hyundai Tucson Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n8-inch touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nAdaptive cruise control\nBlind spot warning system\nRear cross-traffic alert\nDriver drowsiness monitor\nBluetooth\nTwo USB ports\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nLane-centering steering system\nLane departure warning\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n25-inch infotainment screen\nPanoramic moonroof\nLeather seating surfaces\nHands-free power liftgate\nSatellite radio\nSurround-view parking camera\nRoof rack\nHeated front seats\nDual-zone climate control\nDigital gauge cluster\nWireless device charging\nShould I Buy the 2023 Hyundai Tucson?\n\nBig on value and generous when it comes to standard comfort and safety features, the Tucson is best enjoyed in its lower trims. Scaling to pricier trims means dealing with frustrating touch-sensitive controls and the loss of wireless smartphone connectivity (though that also means a larger 10.25-inch screen). The hybrid and PHEV variants are compelling options for anyone who wants the passenger space and cargo volume of an SUV but prefers to make fewer visits to gas stations.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Minor changes to the hybrid drivetrain and big changes to the interior make the 2025 Hyundai Tucson one of the smarter and more stylish entries in the hyper-competitive compact SUV class.\n\nVersus the competition: While the Tucson’s base gas powertrain offers performance that’s par for the course in the segment, the hybrid model is noticeably less efficient than some of its competitors, though the Tucson’s traditional six-speed automatic transmission makes for a quieter and more traditional drive.\n\nHow does the 2025 Hyundai Tucson drive? You tell me — if you’ve driven almost any variant of a model-year 2022-24 Tucson, it’s going to be nearly identical in mechanical operation and sensation to the refreshed 2025 version. Other than some moderate changes to the popular hybrid and plug-in hybrid variants, the chassis, base powertrain and all behind-the-curtain mechanicals are the same as they were in prior years. Hey, you won’t hear any of us at Cars.com complaining; we liked (most of) it before, so we’re bound to like it again.\n\nRelated: 2025 Hyundai Tucson Fixes the Biggest Problem in Its Interior\n\n2025 Hyundai Tucson XRT, rear angle | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\n\nAnd … surprise! It’s still one of the best in the class. I drove the new Tucson Hybrid during an excursion into Southern California’s dusty, winey and very trendy Santa Ynez Valley, where Hyundai organized a circuitous on-road route punctuated by loops in the gas-only Tucson XRT over some cow-infested ranch roads. (Per our ethics policy, Cars.com pays for its own travel and lodging when attending such manufacturer-sponsored events.) \n\nHybrid Huddle\n\nThe core of the hybrid powertrain is unchanged, utilizing the same turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine as before. A juicier 47.7-kilowatt electric motor adds some extra zap to the mix, and total system output is up slightly to 231 horsepower and 271 pounds-feet of torque — 5 extra ponies and 13 additional pounds-feet over the prior model. So, not much additional “go,” but more motor output allows the SUV to operate on electric power longer and more often, and you’d think that would improve overall efficiency. Not so; the updated model’s EPA-estimated 35 mpg combined rating is 2 mpg lower than before for the SEL, N Line and Limited trim levels with the base Blue trim clocking the same 38 mpg combined as before.\n\nWithout a prior hybrid on hand for direct comparison, it’s tough to determine just how much the motor updates have improved the driving experience, but the Tucson Hybrid remains a quiet, easy-driving compact SUV in every respect. Unlike most continuously-variable-automatic-backed entries in the class, the Hyundai retains a traditional six-speed automatic transmission that goes a long, long way in reducing the rubber-band power delivery effect and the aural thrash ‘n’ gnash that often plagues CVT powertrains. The powertrain is so smooth and innocuous, in fact, both my drive partner and I had to double-check the gauge readout for the battery charge indicator to confirm that this was, indeed, the hybrid model. Power and acceleration is solid, too, offering more than enough motivation for on-ramps, careful passing and a car loaded up with friends and fam.\n\n2025 Hyundai Tucson XRT | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\nSmooth Sailing\n\nEverything else is similarly dandy. Brake blend — the balance between purely regenerative resistance and the physical brakes — is well tuned, and the three levels of off-throttle resistance is a neat pseudo-EV function that is both genuinely useful and a nice bit of surprise-and-delight kit. Steering is segment-standard light and artificial, and it has well-tuned accelerator mapping and shift logic. All of this is to say it drives unremarkably nice. It will serve you exactly as you expect it to, and will (hopefully) be a reliable slab of thrifty daily transportation.\n\nSoft-Road Hero\n\nBut wait! There’s (a little) more. You might notice the Tucson pictured in the very lovely photos (oh, stop it!) is fairly dusty and posed in a rustic environ. You’re looking at the updated XRT trim, which is aimed at attracting those elusive active lifestylers who ostensibly cram their Tucson full of tents, bikes, kayaks, rucksacks, firewood and freeze-dried trail food.\n\nA Subaru Forester Wilderness competitor this is not. Other than a set of handsome trim-specific wheels, requisite XRT badging and tweaked cladding is most of the difference you’ll find when compared to other trims. I think it’s the best looking of the bunch (and I always love an all-terrain package regardless of platform). I also love unrestricted access to a dirt two-track, which was the only setting I got to pilot the XRT. This was a low-to-medium-speed affair, which confirmed the carryover naturally aspirated 2.5-liter four-cylinder’s solid noise and vibration isolation, but little else.\n\n2025 Hyundai Tucson XRT, profile | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\n\nThe 2-ish-mile trail was hardly challenging, but featured enough elevation changes and tight turns that I certainly wouldn’t attempt it in something without at least all-wheel drive and normal crossover ride height. I never engaged the XRT’s differential toggle or descent control, but it’s genuinely capable enough for reaching remote campgrounds and trailheads.\n\nAs you might’ve guessed, much of the changes are relegated to exterior styling and interior packaging. I’m not going to delve into the exterior changes (that’s subjective and fairly obvious), but I admittedly dig the new trucky front end. The inside sees the biggest changes, incorporating a number of features already found in other new Hyundais.\n\nMore From Cars.com: \n\n2025 Hyundai Tucson Up Close: Targeted Changes Add Up in a Big Way\nToyota RAV4 Prime and Hyundai Tucson Plug-in Hybrid: Tested\nImproved 2025 Hyundai Tucson Pricing Starts at $29,750\n2024 Hyundai Tucson Regains IIHS Top Safety Pick+ Award\nShop for a 2025 Hyundai Tucson\nExcellent Ergonomics\n\nOn my Tucson Hybrid test vehicle, the curved dash display combo of a 12.3-inch driver and 12.3-inch center infotainment display was the centerpiece improvement. Highly configurable and reactive, it may serve as a strong selling point for cross-shoppers, and it’s just as usable and satisfying as it is in Hyundai’s Santa Fe and Sonata. The Tucson’s touchscreen infotainment system also incorporates standard wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, finally gaining wireless support for its large screen.\n\n2025 Hyundai Tucson XRT, center stack display | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\n\nI’m also a fan of the new three-spoke steering-wheel design, which is satisfying to both grip and behold with the automaker’s trademark dot-dot-dot-dot motif on the horn button that’s “H” in morse code. A column-mounted gear selector is shared with Ioniq models and the new Santa Fe, and it cleans up the center console where you’ll find a large wireless charging pad on most trims and two sizable cupholders.\n\nThere’s a new climate-control panel below the center touchscreen that’s both striking to look at and easy to use. The floating center console allows for a significant amount of storage underneath, complemented by a shelf area inset above the glove box on the passenger’s side. Hyundai consistently creates tidy, ergonomic interiors with plenty of space, and the 2025 Tucson is one of the more interesting and engaging interiors in the class.\n\nThat’s all I got. If you liked it before, there’s only more to enjoy for the 2025 model-year refresh, and the combination of the available curved display and wireless phone projection should cinch the deal for many a buyer. And considering the pricing increase is modest — just $775 extra for the base gas-only SE, which starts at $29,750 (all prices include destination), and $560 extra for the entry-level hybrid Blue that starts at $34,510 — you won’t be priced out if the 2024 Tucson was in your sights.\n\n2025 Hyundai Tucson XRT, wheel | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Are you ready for some big news about the 2020 Hyundai Tucson? Well, you’ll have to keep waiting. We expect to hear about 2020 pricing for the Tucson sooner than later, but the news for now is a shade more superficial — a few shades actually.\n\nRelated: 2019 Hyundai Tucson: Everything You Need to Know\n\nNew for 2020 are four exterior paint colors: Stellar Silver takes the place of Molten Silver (it’s from space!), Magnetic Force takes over for Coliseum Grey (Magnets! Forceful ones!), Winter White replaces Dazzling White (Remember “Game of Thrones”? And how the last season definitely didn’t suck and the existential threat of permanent winter lasted all of three episodes?) and Cream White will take the spot of White Pearl (I don’t have a joke for this one).\n\nThe only other content change to the Tucson is the addition of a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob to Sport and higher trims. Otherwise, the Tucson still retains the same four-cylinder engines and six-speed automatic transmission. Standard and available safety features and optional headlights earned the 2019 Tucson a Top Safety Pick Plus from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, and there are no changes in those areas for the 2020 model.\n\nHey, the 2019 version of the Tucson finished a solid third in our 2019 Compact SUV Challenge. Why mess with a good thing?\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe Tucson is Hyundai’s smallest SUV, intended to compete with the Ford Escape and Honda CR-V. The 2008 model adds active head restraints and an upgraded stereo.\n\nTrim levels include the GLS, SE and Limited. Either a four-cylinder or V-6 engine can be installed, and a manual transmission is available for four-cylinder models. Both versions can be equipped with front-wheel drive or optional four-wheel drive. Side-impact and side curtain airbags are standard, giving the Tucson a total of six airbags.\n\nExterior\nHyundai says the Tucson has a masculine, athletic appearance. SE and Limited models feature bodyside cladding. Wraparound headlights and an LED-type center brake light are installed. A single-bar grille contains the Hyundai logo.\n\nAlloy wheels hold 16-inch tires. Fog lamps are installed on the SE and Limited, and a moonroof is optional. Riding a 103.5-inch wheelbase, the Tucson is 170.3 inches long overall and 66.1 inches tall (not counting the roof rack).\n\nInterior\nThe Tucson’s five-passenger interior includes a 60/40-split flat-folding rear seat. The fully reclining front passenger seat can be folded forward. The plastic cargo floor has multiple tie-down locations. Cargo space is 22.7 cubic feet with the rear seat up and 65.5 cubic feet with the seat down.\n\nStandard equipment includes power windows and locks, heated mirrors, keyless entry with an alarm, an intermittent rear wiper and a six-speaker CD stereo. For 2008, the stereo adds an auxiliary MP3 jack and XM Satellite Radio, with free service for three months. Available features on other trims include a leather-wrapped steering wheel, air conditioning and cruise control. Fully loaded Tucsons have heated leather seats, automatic climate control and a six-CD stereo. All models have an easy-to-clean composite cargo floor.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA standard 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine with continuously variable valve timing delivers 140 horsepower. Either a Shiftronic four-speed automatic transmission or a five-speed manual gearbox can be installed. In uplevel trims, an available 2.7-liter V-6 engine — offered only with the automatic — generates 173 hp.\n\nThe available four-wheel-drive system can divert up to 50 percent of available power to the rear wheels in response to changing road conditions or torque demand. A button lets the driver lock the driveline into a 50/50 torque split.\n\nSafety\nSide curtain airbags, seat-mounted side-impact airbags, an electronic stability system and all-disc antilock brakes with traction control are standard. For 2008, new active front head restraints move forward in a rear impact to protect against whiplash.\n\nDriving Impressions\nTucsons lean toward the cushiony end of the ride-and-handling spectrum, rather than the sporty side. The ride is pleasantly smooth on most surfaces, but undulating pavement and even moderate bumps can transmit some roughness to occupants. The Tucson is easy to drive and requires little correction on straightaways, but handling is relatively humdrum compared to the Ford Escape.\n\nTire noise is noticeable on some surfaces, and some engine buzz is apparent in lower gears in models with the manual transmission. Otherwise, the Tucson is impressively quiet.\n\nThe seats are quite supportive and reasonably comfortable. Cargo space falls short of the Santa Fe’s, but the area is easy to access. Thick D-pillars block over-the-shoulder views a bit, but visibility is otherwise satisfying because of the long glass in the rear doors.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The redesigned 2022 Hyundai Tucson is a value-oriented compact SUV with promising refinement, but higher trim levels swap in cumbersome touch-sensitive controls — a deal breaker that should keep any well-optioned example off your list.\n\nVersus the competition: Minus those miserable controls, the Tucson is otherwise a lot of car for the money, with above-average drivability and a roomy cabin to boot.\n\nThe Tucson comes with a gasoline four-cylinder engine and front- or all-wheel drive; Hyundai also offers hybrid and plug-in hybrid drivetrains, both with AWD exclusively. Nine trim levels span the three powertrains, with prices for the gas-only and hybrid ranging from a little over $26,000 to around $39,000; Hyundai had yet to issue pricing for the plug-in hybrid as of publication. We evaluated two well-equipped test cars, one gas-only and the other a hybrid.\n\nRelated: 2022 Hyundai Tucson: What Do the SE, SEL, N Line and Limited Cost?\n\nFirst Things First\n\nI’ll get to the Tucson’s overall merits in a bit, but the elephant in the room must come first: Higher trim levels of the Tucson adopt touch-sensitive dashboard controls in place of physical buttons for all manner of things — volume, tuning, multimedia shortcut keys, nearly all the climate controls. We’re seldom this dismissive of a car outright, but these buttons are fussy to use all the time, constantly diverting your attention from the road to determine where your finger lands. We aren’t the only ones put off by the controls; leading consumer surveys also indicate owners want physical controls. (I also reject the notion that the irritation subsides over time. Touch-sensitive controls afflict appliances in my home, too — three space heaters and a range hood. I’ve had them for years, and they’re just as insipid today.)\n\nLower Tucson trim levels, on the other hand, have physical volume and tuning thumbwheels, as well as physical — albeit manual — climate controls. Most climate controls become touch-sensitive in the Tucson Hybrid, and by the time you get to the top trim level of either model, the whole thing’s a single blasted touch panel. Unless you’re a glutton for irritation, avoid these versions entirely.\n\nWhat About Lower Trims?\n\nOther than its top trim levels, the Tucson holds potential. Aside from the touch panel, other controls operate with precision and heft, though Hyundai’s push-button gear selector is less intuitive than a conventional gearshift. Lower trim levels get an 8-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, both wireless, while higher trims have a 10.25-inch unit with wired integration. (Hyundai has a recurring problem with its plus-sized touchscreens lacking wireless smartphone integration; here, as elsewhere, the base screen is functionally superior.) Lower trims pair the touchscreen with conventional gauges, while mid-level and higher editions swap in a crisp digital gauge panel, also 10.25 inches (measured diagonally).\n\nCabin materials are competitive with the class, with an open, layered design and mostly attractive textures throughout. The exception is the rear doors, where Hyundai seems to have pinched some pennies. The new driver’s seat is a commanding perch when fully raised, though owners who prefer to sit farther forward might find the center console clips inboard knee space at that elevation. Backseat legroom is good, but headroom in both rows is merely adequate with the available panoramic moonroof, which both our test cars had. Without the roof, Hyundai says headroom gains 0.5 inch in back and 2 inches up front — both much needed.\n\nOur independent testing of cargo space measured 21.46 cubic feet of volume behind the conventional Tucson’s backseat and 21.66 cubic feet in the Tucson Hybrid. The hybrid ranks a touch higher than the space we measured in the Honda CR-V Hybrid (19.61 cubic feet) and Toyota RAV4 Hybrid (20.69), while the gas-only model substantially beats the Subaru Forester (18.17), Mazda CX-5 (17.91) and Nissan Rogue (17.12). That’s impressive.\n\nWe have yet to test the Tucson Plug-in Hybrid, but it lacks the dual-level cargo floor you get in the other two versions, so it’s likely to have considerably less volume. By Hyundai’s own specs, cargo volume behind the plug-in’s backseat is some 20% less than in the Tucson Hybrid.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nBody motion in both the hybrid and gas-only models seems reasonably controlled, with minimal bounciness after rapid elevation changes or recessed sewer covers, though there’s some lateral movement over mid-corner bumps. Impact harshness is muted enough overall, even with the 19-inch wheels and low-profile tires on both our test cars. Lower trims have 17-inch wheels and higher-profile tires that may make them even softer, but we didn’t evaluate one.\n\nGas-only models pair a naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine (187 hp) with an eight-speed automatic transmission. The eight-speed’s tendency to upshift early and often can leave you wanting more power during low-speed acceleration; instead you’re often a gear too high and a thousand rpm too low. The transmission becomes a serviceable companion above that, downshifting with minimal delay if you need to accelerate at highway speeds. Pushed to higher rpm, the engine serves up adequate, if noisy, power.\n\nSteering feedback is lackluster, but it improves notably with a driver-selectable Sport mode that dials back power assist. Body roll is limited throughout, but overall balance feels as nose-heavy as any front-drive-based compact SUV. The Tucson Hybrid improves on balance, with enough to eliminate most of the gas-only model’s chronic understeer — a palpable result of its battery pack adding much-needed weight around the rear axle. As such, roadholding improves enough to make the hybrid SUV downright fun to throw around corners.\n\nThe Tucson Hybrid’s drivetrain is sometimes fun. It pairs a pint-sized, turbocharged four-cylinder engine with a small electric motor for a combined 226 hp, and the combination makes for swift, linear power when both are in play. (The linearity comes thanks to a conventional six-speed automatic transmission, not the continuously variable style that most hybrids employ.) Unfortunately, such spurts are rare in daily driving, where the Tucson Hybrid minimizes engine power as much as possible. Under mostly electric power, with a periodic dollop of engine, the Tucson Hybrid feels tentative, even gutless. If you lead-foot your way around town or always drive in Sport mode, the drivetrain shows its stuff — gas mileage be damned.\n\nThat mileage, by the way, is EPA-rated at 37 to 38 mpg combined — a hefty increase over the regular Tucson’s 26 to 29 mpg, depending on driveline. That’s roughly competitive with other compact hybrid SUVs.\n\nThe Tucson Plug-in Hybrid teams the turbo engine with a higher-powered electric motor, the six-speed automatic and a higher-capacity battery pack. The drivetrain combines for a Hyundai-estimated 261 hp and 32 miles of all-electric range, making the PHEV the lineup’s quickest, most efficient variant — on paper. We haven’t evaluated it yet, nor has the EPA published its own ratings.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2022 Hyundai Tucson Widens Appeal With Plug-In, N Line Models\nHyundai Tucson N Line Stays in Line With Sporty-Styled Siblings\nIs the 2021 Hyundai Santa Fe a Good Car? 5 Pros and 4 Cons\nHow Much Does the 2021 Hyundai Santa Fe Cost?\nSafety and Driver-Assist Tech\n\nWith easy-access Latch anchors and a roomy enough second row to fit even our bulky rear-facing car seats, the Tucson passed Cars.com’s Car Seat Check with flying colors. The Tucson also earned Top Safety Pick Plus status from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety thanks to top scores in all six crashworthiness categories, plus well-rated headlights and forward automatic emergency braking. Forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking and pedestrian detection is standard; a cyclist-detection function is optional. \n\nThe owner’s manual stipulates automatic emergency braking in the Tucson can function only at speeds up to 37 mph — well below the operating threshold offered by most competitors’ AEB systems. This isn’t the first time a car from Hyundai or its Kia affiliate has imposed such low limits, but it’s an apparent disadvantage nonetheless. (We did not test the system, and IIHS’ field tests on automatic braking max out at 25 mph.)\n\nHyundai’s Lane Following Assist, a lane-centering steering system, is standard. Higher trim levels get stop-and-go adaptive cruise control with Highway Driving Assist, which adds enhanced capabilities on limited-access highways.\n\nShould You Buy a Tucson?\n\nAnyone considering higher trim levels of the 2022 Tucson will need to make peace with the SUV’s fussy touch-sensitive controls and consider parting with close to $40,000. (Or you could look elsewhere; plenty of other compact SUVs merge feature-rich interiors with physical buttons and knobs. This ain’t rocket science.) Fortunately, lower trims have the double benefit of strong value — the SUV starts at $26,135 with destination, undercutting the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4, and bringing Hyundai’s excellent warranty and class-leading free maintenance to boot — plus physical controls and better smartphone integration. Less is more: If any Tucsons are worth considering, it’s these.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe Tucson is Hyundai’s smallest SUV, intended to compete with the Ford Escape and Honda CR-V. Trim levels include the GLS, SE and Limited. There is a choice of either a four-cylinder or V-6 engine, and a manual transmission is available for four-cylinder models. Both versions can be equipped with front-wheel drive or optional four-wheel drive. The Tucson seats five.\n\nNew for 2009\nThe Tucson gets a bolder front grille and rear treatment, a tweaked transmission management system and torque converter said to improve fuel economy. Upper-level models gain standard luxury features.\n\nExterior\nA single-bar grille contains the Hyundai logo. Riding a 103.5-inch wheelbase, the Tucson is 170.3 inches long and 66.1 inches tall. The base GLS is 70.7 inches wide, but the uplevel versions have plastic wheel-well flares for a rugged appearance, extending the width to 72.1 inches. Compared to its Ford and Honda competitors, the Tucson is the shortest in length but close in width. With the roof rails, the Tucson stands 2 inches taller than the CR-V.\n\nStandard 16-inch alloy wheels\nNew, bolder front grille and rear treatment\nFog lamps on SE and Limited\nPower sunroof standard on Limited V-6 models\n\nInterior\nThe Tucson’s five-passenger interior has 22.7 cubic feet of cargo space with the rear seat up and 65.5 cubic feet with the seat down. Standard equipment includes power windows and locks, heated mirrors, air conditioning and an intermittent rear wiper. Available features on other trims include a leather-wrapped steering wheel, keyless entry with alarm and cruise control. Fully loaded Tucsons have heated leather seats, automatic climate control and a six-CD stereo. A new 200-watt Kenwood Navigation/Audio system with 700 MB of internal memory, SD card slot, and touch-screen functionality is standard on the Limited and optional on the GLS and SE.\n\n60/40-split flat-folding rear seat\nEasy-to-clean plastic cargo floor with multiple tie-down locations\nStandard AM/FM/XM Satellite Radio/CD/MP3 stereo with auxiliary input jack\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that uses continuously variable valve timing is standard. In uplevel trims, a 2.7-liter V-6 engine is offered. The available four-wheel-drive system can divert up to 50 percent of available power to the rear wheels in response to changing road conditions or torque demand. A button lets the driver lock the driveline into a 50/50 torque split. Hyundai says engine improvements and the transmission management system should improve fuel economy for the four-cylinder engine and increase city mileage for all-wheel-drive V-6 models.\n\n140-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder with 136 pounds-feet of torque\n173-hp, 2.7-liter V-6 with 178 pounds-feet of torque\nShiftronic four-speed automatic or five-speed manual\nB&M Racing Sport Shifter for manual transmission\n\nSafety\nStandard features include:\n\nSide curtain airbags",

      "expert_review": "The 2016 Hyundai Tucson is a comfortable, stylish and quiet vehicle that’s sure to excite shoppers and make segment rivals more than a bit nervous.\n\nCompact SUVs are hot, but Hyundai’s entry has historically left many shoppers cold. The 2015 Tucson SUV didn’t compete in the most recent Cars.com $28,000 Compact SUV Challenge, but if it had, its loud, rough ride would have earned it a spot among the losers. A redesign for 2016 adds some much-needed ride refinement.\n\nChanges include more dramatic styling, a new turbocharged engine option that’s potent and efficient, additional cargo room, and a host of new safety and convenience features. Compare the 2015 and 2016 models here.\n\nThe 2016 Tucson competes against the Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4 and Ford Escape, just to name a few best-sellers. Compare them here.\nExterior & Styling\nThe Tucson’s new look is bold and brawny. The previous model’s cute-ute styling is replaced by a more upright, squared-off front end and sloped roofline. A larger grille and stylish LED-accented headlights anchor its more commanding face.\n\nThe Tucson has grown in both attitude and size. Overall length is up 3 inches, it’s 1 inch wider and the roofline is less than an inch lower than the outgoing model’s.\nHow It Drives\nMy first drive was in the midlevel Sport and top Limited versions of the Tucson through the narrow, crowded streets of downtown Minneapolis and the sweeping, pastoral hills of western Wisconsin; it easily maneuvered both.\n\nI tested the new 175-horsepower, turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder that comes standard on Eco, Sport and Limited trims. It replaces the older 2.0-liter four-cylinder that still powers the base SE trim level. With 195 pounds-feet of torque from the new engine, acceleration from a stop was hearty.\n\nThe biggest surprise, though, was the new seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. It paired seamlessly with the turbo, ticking off snappy shifts from a stop and furnishing smooth, timely power on the highway. It exhibited none of the telltale bogging and lurching common with many dual-clutch transmissions. In fact, it feels so normal shoppers will likely not be able to tell the difference between Hyundai’s dual-clutch and a traditional automatic.\n\nFuel economy with the new powertrain is competitive: Front-wheel-drive Eco models are EPA-rated 26/33/29 mpg city/highway/combined (Sport and Limited models get a bit less), which is much better than the SE’s 164-hp, 2.0-liter four-cylinder (23/31/26 mpg). All-wheel-drive (AWD) is still an available option.  In the Eco trim, the new turbo’s economy is in line with the Honda CR-V (27/34/29) and better than the Toyota RAV4 (23/30/26). The Tucson also beats the Escape on efficiency: Base Escapes get 22/31/25; the Ford’s optional turbo 1.6-liter is rated 23/32/26, and the turbo 2.0-liter is rated 22/30/25.\n\nTwo drive modes are selectable via a button near the shifter: Sport and Eco. Accelerator response and transmission timing are adjusted depending on the mode, though neither had a big impact. In Sport mode, the accelerator pedal was a bit more sensitive; in Eco, it was slightly dulled. I spent most of my drive time in the default, normal mode.\n\nThe previous generation Hyundai Tucson’s two biggest weaknesses were ride quality and noise. A firm ride and poor road isolation transmitted every bump through the cabin, and it was one of the loudest compact crossovers in the class, with high levels of wind and road noise. The new version is much quieter, and its more compliant ride and better bump absorption make it long-drive comfortable. The Limited model impressed with its smoothness, but the Sport model’s sport-tuned suspension reminded me of the old Tucson: It rides too firmly, hopping over bumps with an uncomfortably brittle, jittery feel.\n\nThe Inside\nThe Limited trim’s interior wears plenty of padding and upscale touches, such as leather seats and a stitched dashboard. The Sport model’s cabin is noticeably more modest, with more hard plastic surfaces and cloth seats, though it doesn’t look or feel as cheap as lower Escape and RAV4 trims.\n\nOne of my favorite features is the standard cloth upholstery. OK, that sounds really boring, but stay with me. It’s YES Essentials stain- and odor-resistant fabric, so spilled liquids bead up instead of seeping into the fabric, minimizing cleanup, stains and mysterious odors. As a mom and a clumsy coffee drinker, this stuff is brilliant. Can I get it on a couch?\n\nHyundai lowered the Tucson’s roofline by less than an inch for 2016, but headroom is ample in both rows. By the numbers, the Tucson offers 39.2 inches of rear headroom. That’s a smidge more than last year and more than the RAV4 (38.9), CR-V (38.6) and Escape (39.0).\n\nBackseat passengers will have enough legroom on comfortable, bolstered outboard seats; rear legroom is down less than an inch this year. With 38.2 inches of rear legroom, the Hyundai Tucson still offers more than the RAV4 (37.2) and Escape (36.8) and almost matches the CR-V (38.3). The middle position is not ideal, however: The seat is narrower and harder, and the shoulder portion of the seat belt retracts from the ceiling, impacting the driver’s rearward visibility.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe Limited model’s standard 8-inch touch-screen multimedia system responded quickly, had simple menus and was easy to use. Clear buttons below the screen and handy volume and tuning dials make the system a no-brainer.\n\nThe standard 5-inch touch-screen looks dinky but functions just fine. The audio system has a different menu structure, but it’s just as simple. It has the same handy button/knob setup as well.\n\nHyundai launched the Android Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone integration systems on the 2015 Hyundai Sonata, but the systems aren’t yet available on the 2016 Tucson.\nCargo & Storage\nSmall-item storage in front is excellent. There’s a medium-sized center console (not quite large enough for my big purse, however), a large uncovered bin under the climate controls, a smaller one near the center cupholders and a narrow, magazine-sized cubby at leg level on the front passenger side.\n\nMuch of the 2016’s 3-inch length increase translates into more cargo room, though it’s still shy of what competitors offer. This year, the Tucson has 31.0 cubic feet behind the rear seats, which is 5.3 more than the outgoing model. Fold the seats down and there’s 61.9 cubic feet of space. The CR-V has 35.3 cubic feet behind the rear seats and 70.9 after they’re folded. The RAV4 has 38.4/73.4 and the Escape 34.3/67.8.\n\nThe Hyundai Tucson’s cargo area has a dual-level floor. It can be raised by 2 inches, which doesn’t sound useful, but in its highest position the cargo cover slides easily under the load floor for handy storage when carrying bulky items. Also convenient is an available hands-free smart liftgate; stand within 3 feet of the vehicle’s rear with the key fob in your purse or pocket, and the liftgate will open automatically after the Tucson issues a warning by beeping a few times. Ford offers a foot-swipe-activated liftgate on the Escape that’s also helpful, but requires good balance.    \n\nSafety\nThe 2016 Hyundai Tucson has not yet been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nThe Tucson has easy-to-access lower Latch and top tether anchors and room for two child-safety seats. Read more in our Car Seat Check.\n\nA backup camera is standard across the lineup. New active-safety features like blind spot warning and rear cross-traffic alert are standard on Sport and Limited models, but unavailable on lower trims. Other new safety systems, like lane departure warning, a forward collision prevention system with pedestrian detection and a dynamic bending light system (which swivels the headlights around curves), are available as options but only on Limited models. Click here for a full list of safety features.\nValue in Its Class\nThe 2016 Hyundai Tucson starts at $23,595 including an $895 destination charge. That’s about $1,000 more than the outgoing model and a smidge less than all three main competitors. Standard features on the base Hyundai Tucson SE include a backup camera, automatic projector headlights with LED accents, satellite radio, iPod and USB inputs, and Bluetooth connectivity and streaming.\n\nTo get the more efficient powertrain, however, you’ll have to opt for the Eco model, which starts at $25,045. For the active-safety features detailed above you’ll need to move up to the Sport model ($27,045), where you’ll also get new convenience features like the hands-free power liftgate. Annoyingly, the navigation system is available only on the most expensive trim, the Limited ($30,795), where it’s standard.\n\nThe 2016 Hyundai Tucson is a big improvement over the outgoing model and does many things well. When there’s a Compact SUV Challenge rematch, the 2016 model is almost certain to claim a spot on the podium.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was writte in September 2015 about the 2016 Tucson, but little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2017, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years. \n\nChanges include more dramatic styling, a new turbocharged engine option that’s potent and efficient, additional cargo room, and a host of new safety and convenience features. Compare the 2015 and 2016 models here.\n\nThe 2016 Tucson competes against the Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4 and Ford Escape, just to name a few best-sellers. Compare them here.\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nThe Tucson’s new look is bold and brawny. The previous model’s cute-ute styling is replaced by a more upright, squared-off front end and sloped roofline. A larger grille and stylish LED-accented headlights anchor its more commanding face.\n\nThe Tucson has grown in both attitude and size. Overall length is up 3 inches, it’s 1 inch wider and the roofline is less than an inch lower than the outgoing model’s.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nI drove midlevel Sport and top Limited versions of the Tucson through the narrow, crowded streets of downtown Minneapolis and the sweeping, pastoral hills of western Wisconsin; it easily maneuvered both.\n\nI tested the new 175-horsepower, turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder that comes standard on Eco, Sport and Limited trims. It replaces the older 2.0-liter four-cylinder that still powers the base SE trim level. With 195 pounds-feet of torque from the new engine, acceleration from a stop was hearty.\n\nThe biggest surprise, though, was the new seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. It paired seamlessly with the turbo, ticking off snappy shifts from a stop and furnishing smooth, timely power on the highway. It exhibited none of the telltale bogging and lurching common with many dual-clutch transmissions. In fact, it feels so normal shoppers will likely not be able to tell the difference between Hyundai’s dual-clutch and a traditional automatic.\n\nFuel economy with the new powertrain is competitive: Front-wheel-drive Eco models are EPA-rated 26/33/29 mpg city/highway/combined (Sport and Limited models get a bit less), which is much better than the SE’s 164-hp, 2.0-liter four-cylinder (23/31/26 mpg). In the Eco trim, the new turbo’s economy is in line with the Honda CR-V (27/34/29) and better than the Toyota RAV4 (23/30/26). The Tucson also beats the Escape on efficiency: Base Escapes get 22/31/25; the Ford’s optional turbo 1.6-liter is rated 23/32/26, and the turbo 2.0-liter is rated 22/30/25.\n\nTwo drive modes are selectable via a button near the shifter: Sport and Eco. Accelerator response and transmission timing are adjusted depending on the mode, though neither had a big impact. In Sport mode, the accelerator pedal was a bit more sensitive; in Eco, it was slightly dulled. I spent most of my drive time in the default, normal mode.\n\nThe outgoing Tucson’s two biggest weaknesses were ride quality and noise. A firm ride and poor road isolation transmitted every bump through the cabin, and it was one of the loudest compact crossovers in the class, with high levels of wind and road noise. The new version is much quieter, and its more compliant ride and better bump absorption make it long-drive comfortable. The Limited model impressed with its smoothness, but the Sport model’s sport-tuned suspension reminded me of the old Tucson: It rides too firmly, hopping over bumps with an uncomfortably brittle, jittery feel.\n\nThe Inside\n\nThe Limited trim’s interior wears plenty of padding and upscale touches, such as leather seats and a stitched dashboard. The Sport model’s cabin is noticeably more modest, with more hard plastic surfaces and cloth seats, though it doesn’t look or feel as cheap as lower Escape and RAV4 trims.\n\nOne of my favorite features is the standard cloth upholstery. OK, that sounds really boring, but stay with me. It’s YES Essentials stain- and odor-resistant fabric, so spilled liquids bead up instead of seeping into the fabric, minimizing cleanup, stains and mysterious odors. As a mom and a clumsy coffee drinker, this stuff is brilliant. Can I get it on a couch?\n\nHyundai lowered the Tucson’s roofline by less than an inch for 2016, but headroom is ample in both rows. By the numbers, the Tucson offers 39.2 inches of rear headroom. That’s a smidge more than last year and more than the RAV4 (38.9), CR-V (38.6) and Escape (39.0).\n\nBackseat passengers will have enough legroom on comfortable, bolstered outboard seats; rear legroom is down less than an inch this year. With 38.2 inches of rear legroom, the Tucson still offers more than the RAV4 (37.2) and Escape (36.8) and almost matches the CR-V (38.3). The middle position is not ideal, however: The seat is narrower and harder, and the shoulder portion of the seat belt retracts from the ceiling, impacting the driver’s rearward visibility.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nThe Limited model’s standard 8-inch touch-screen multimedia system responded quickly, had simple menus and was easy to use. Clear buttons below the screen and handy volume and tuning dials make the system a no-brainer.\n\nThe standard 5-inch touch-screen looks dinky but functions just fine. The audio system has a different menu structure, but it’s just as simple. It has the same handy button/knob setup as well.\n\nHyundai launched the Android Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone integration systems on the 2015 Hyundai Sonata, but the systems aren’t yet available on the 2016 Tucson.\n\nCargo & Storage\n\nSmall-item storage in front is excellent. There’s a medium-sized center console (not quite large enough for my big purse, however), a large uncovered bin under the climate controls, a smaller one near the center cupholders and a narrow, magazine-sized cubby at leg level on the front passenger side.\n\nMuch of the 2016’s 3-inch length increase translates into more cargo room, though it’s still shy of what competitors offer. This year, the Tucson has 31.0 cubic feet behind the rear seats, which is 5.3 more than the outgoing model. Fold the seats down and there’s 61.9 cubic feet of space. The CR-V has 35.3 cubic feet behind the rear seats and 70.9 after they’re folded. The RAV4 has 38.4/73.4 and the Escape 34.3/67.8.\n\nThe Tucson’s cargo area has a dual-level floor. It can be raised by 2 inches, which doesn’t sound useful, but in its highest position the cargo cover slides easily under the load floor for handy storage when carrying bulky items. Also convenient is an available hands-free smart liftgate; stand within 3 feet of the vehicle’s rear with the key fob in your purse or pocket, and the liftgate will open automatically after the Tucson issues a warning by beeping a few times. Ford offers a foot-swipe-activated liftgate on the Escape that’s also helpful, but requires good balance.\n\nSafety\n\nThe 2016 Hyundai Tucson received a rating of Top Safety Pick Plus from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and a five-star overall rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nThe Tucson has easy-to-access lower Latch and top tether anchors and room for two child-safety seats. Read more in our Car Seat Check.\n\nA backup camera is standard across the lineup. New active-safety features like blind spot warning and rear cross-traffic alert are standard on Sport and Limited models, but unavailable on lower trims. Other new safety systems, like lane departure warning, a forward collision prevention system with pedestrian detection and a dynamic bending light system (which swivels the headlights around curves), are available as options but only on Limited models. Click here for a full list of safety features.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nThe 2016 Hyundai Tucson starts at $23,595 including an $895 destination charge. That’s about $1,000 more than the outgoing model and a smidge less than all three main competitors. Standard features on the base Tucson SE include a backup camera, automatic projector headlights with LED accents, satellite radio, iPod and USB inputs, and Bluetooth connectivity and streaming.\n\nTo get the more efficient powertrain, however, you’ll have to opt for the Eco model, which starts at $25,045. For the active-safety features detailed above you’ll need to move up to the Sport model ($27,045), where you’ll also get new convenience features like the hands-free power liftgate. Annoyingly, the navigation system is available only on the most expensive trim, the Limited ($30,795), where it’s standard.\n\nThe 2016 Hyundai Tucson is a big improvement over the outgoing model and does many things well. When there’s a Compact SUV Challenge rematch, the 2016 model is almost certain to claim a spot on the podium.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in December 2009 about the 2010 Hyundai Tucson. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2011, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nAnother year, another model from hard-charging Hyundai. This time it’s the Tucson, a small crossover that impressed us upon its arrival for the 2005 model year. With its 2010 redesign, the Tucson has done some leapfrogging of its competition — it’s fuel-efficient, stylish and high-rent — but it falls just short of a slam-dunk. This segment is packed with great choices, and the Tucson is light on utility. If your needs are light, though, it’s certainly worth checking out.\n\nThe Tucson comes in GLS and Limited trims, with front- or all-wheel drive. I test-drove both.\n\n‘Fluidic Sculpture’\nLove it or hate it, the new Tucson looks interesting. If the last Tucson looked affable, this one seems sophisticated. Hyundai described its styling as “fluidic sculpture.” It’s certainly fluid. The cut lines don’t really go anywhere. The creased lights resemble Infiniti’s, and the upper and lower grilles are edgy and controversial, in a Honda CR-V sort of way. The Tucson doesn’t look like much else in Hyundai’s lineup, and I suspect the adventurous tack will pay off.\n\nMy second impression: The Tucson is small. Though a few inches longer than its predecessor, it’s still slightly shorter than a Ford Escape, and it’s at least 6 inches shorter than a CR-V or Toyota RAV4. City drivers will appreciate the Tucson’s dimensions — as well as its 34.7-foot turning circle, which beats all three.\n\nThe size issues may be intentional. Hyundai’s Santa Fe, which has an optional third-row seat, is a step up in size from the Tucson. It’s generally larger than this crowd, but not quite as big as large crossovers like the Ford Flex and Honda Pilot.\n\nSpace, the Missing Frontier\nFluid sculpture, it turns out, affects the cabin. The driver’s seat offers the high seating position of a traditional SUV, but the roofline is low, and the rear windows taper off near the C-pillars. The results are rear sightlines similar to a Nissan Rogue’s, and that vehicle finished last in our survey of blind spots among small crossovers last February. Drivers around 6 feet tall may find the driver’s seat cramped: It can only go so far back, and the doors and dashboard encroach on space for your knees. I sat in a CR-V and RAV4 back-to-back, and both have more room for a driver to stretch out.\n\nThe rear seats offer decent headroom and adequate legroom, but some adjustability would be welcome. The earlier Tucson’s backseat reclined a few degrees, and the seats in a lot of competitors both recline and move forward and back. These are fixed.\n\nCargo volume behind the backseat totals 25.7 cubic feet. Fold the rear seats down, and the Tucson’s 55.8 cubic feet of maximum cargo volume ranks near the bottom of the class. The last Tucson addressed the compact dimensions to some degree with a fold-flat front-passenger seat, so even though the sum total of cargo room was small, you could at least shoehorn something long in there. Not so much anymore: The new Tucson ditches the fold-flat front seat, and maximum cargo volume is down 10 cubic feet.\n\nCargo Volume Compared (cu. ft.)\n \tBehind 1st row\tBehind 2nd row\n2010 Toyota RAV4\t73.0\t36.4*\n2010 Honda CR-V\t72.9\t35.7\n2010 Subaru Forester\t68.3\t33.5\n2010 Ford Escape\t67.2\t31.4\n2009 Hyundai Tucson\t65.5\t22.7\n2010 Chevrolet Equinox\t63.7\t31.4\n2010 Nissan Rogue\t57.9\t28.9\n2010 Hyundai Tucson\t55.8\t25.7\n*In two-row RAV4. Three-row RAV4s with the third row folded have 37.2 cubic feet behind the second row.\n\n \n\nInterior Quality\nCabin quality is competitive for this segment, with a consistent, low-gloss appearance for most of the plastics within immediate view. Most buttons operate with high-grade precision, but I’m not crazy about the silver paint on a number of them, which can obscure the labels.\n\nThe optional navigation system uses a 6.5-inch touch-screen. It’s fairly easy to use, with plenty of street labels and excellent graphics. Other amenities include a panoramic moonroof, dual-zone automatic climate control and heated leather seats. The leather in the Limited trim feels rich enough for a pricier car; it’s a far cry from the cut-rate textured cloth in the base Tucson GLS. A respectable leatherette/cloth mix that’s optional on the GLS splits the difference.\n\nGetting Around\nRather than carry over some variation of the last Tucson’s engines — a 2.0-liter four-cylinder and a 2.7-liter V-6 — the 2010 Tucson is available only with a new 176-horsepower, 2.4-liter four-cylinder that works, in most configurations, with a six-speed automatic. The combination makes for capable acceleration around town, but uphill stretches left me wanting for last year’s V-6, whose higher torque provided some much-appreciated muscle when pushed hard. Still, as four-cylinder crossovers go, the Tucson has enough oomph.\n\nThe six-speed automatic kicks down without too much delay, and its shorter gear ratios allow for quicker thrust off the line than a CR-V or four-cylinder RAV4. In either trim, the automatic comes with front- or all-wheel drive. A six-speed manual transmission comes in the front-wheel-drive GLS. It has medium throws and poorly defined gates, but manual crossovers have never been known as crisp shifters.\n\nThough never especially engaging to drive, the Tucson handles capably, with decent turn-in precision and a natural, well-weighted steering wheel that unwinds easily to 12 o’clock. Ride quality is acceptable; the suspension preserves decent comfort, but bumps make their way up to occupants easily enough. There was no discernable difference in ride quality between the 17- and 18-inch wheels, but the Tucson is no Ford Escape, which, in terms of ride comfort, is still the one to beat.\n\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes are standard, and the pedal’s linear response is on par with others in this class. Gas mileage with the automatic, at 23/31 mpg with front-wheel drive and 21/28 mpg with all-wheel drive, is impressive, pretty evenly matching the uncommonly efficient four-cylinder Chevy Equinox. It’s a major leap for Hyundai, considering the outgoing Tucson was one of the thirstier small crossovers on the market.\n\nEPA Gas Mileage (City/Highway, MPG)\nFour-cylinder engines, automatic transmissions\n \tAWD\tFWD\nHyundai Tucson\t21/28\t23/31\nChevrolet Equinox\t20/29\t22/32\nToyota RAV4\t21/27\t22/28\nHonda CR-V\t21/27\t21/28\nNissan Rogue\t21/26\t22/27\nSubaru Forester\t20/26\t—\nFord Escape\t20/26\t21/28\nSource: EPA data for 2010 models\n\n \n\nSafety & Features\nThe 2010 Tucson hasn’t yet been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. Standard features include the usual raft of airbags, and the side curtain airbags now include a rollover sensor. The Tucson also gets antilock brakes and an electronic stability system.\n\nFor a bargain price of $18,995, the front-wheel-drive Tucson comes standard with an iPod/USB-compatible stereo — a nice inclusion — as well as power windows and locks, air conditioning, keyless entry and a height-adjustable driver’s seat. An automatic transmission runs $1,000. All-wheel-drive shoppers will have to spring for an equipment package that adds cruise control, steering-wheel audio controls and a litany of other items. It’s a prerequisite for all-wheel drive, boosting the minimum price for an AWD Tucson to a not-so-inexpensive $23,195.\n\nA front-wheel-drive Tucson Limited, which comes standard with the automatic transmission, starts at $24,345. Load it up with navigation, the panoramic moonroof and all-wheel drive, and you’ll have a downright rich-feeling crossover — but it will set you back more than $28,000.\n\nTucson in the Market\nIn 2009, Honda, Ford and Toyota moved dozens of CR-Vs, Escapes and RAV4s for every Tucson Hyundai sold. Hyundai thinks it can do better, and there’s little reason to doubt it can. In its waning years, the old Tucson appealed on value and not much else. Its successor sacrifices some utility for design, but the resulting crossover is flat-out desirable. Value notwithstanding, that’s a solid recipe for larger appeal.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Hyundai Tucson?\n\nThe 2024 Hyundai Tucson is a five-seat compact SUV that comes standard with a 187-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine, an eight-speed automatic transmission, and a choice of front- or all-wheel drive. Direct rivals include the Ford Escape, Honda CR-V, Mazda CX-50 and Toyota RAV4. For shoppers interested in significantly better fuel efficiency, the Tucson is also available as a hybrid and plug-in hybrid; the latter delivers an EPA-estimated 33 miles of electric driving range. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Hyundai Tucson?\n\nThe Tucson was redesigned for 2022, but it still receives a few notable updates this year. All Tucsons now come standard with rear side airbags and seat belt reminders for all occupants, and haptic steering-wheel feedback is now included with lane departure steering assist and blind spot warning. A 10.25-inch touchscreen is newly standard on all but the SE and SEL trim levels, and the sporty N-Line trim, previously available only with the gas-only powertrain, is now offered only on the Tucson Hybrid. \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Hyundai Tucson Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\n8-inch touchscreen\nSix-speaker audio system\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nAdaptive cruise control\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nDriver drowsiness monitor\nBluetooth\nTwo USB ports\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nLane departure steering assist\nLane departure warning\n\nAvailable features include: \n\n10.25-inch touchscreen\nPanoramic moonroof\nLeather upholstery\nHands-free power liftgate\nSatellite radio\nSurround-view parking camera\nHeated front seats\nDual-zone climate control\nDigital gauge cluster\nWireless device charging\nRoof rack\nShould I Buy the 2024 Hyundai Tucson?\n\nThe 2024 Hyundai Tucson remains a great choice for SUV shoppers who want lots of value and everyday versatility wrapped in an eye-catching shape — even though the standard four-cylinder engine gets breathless when you ask too much of it. While straight-line speed is meager with the base powertrain, overall fuel economy is respectable. For added performance and even better fuel economy, the hybrid and plug-in hybrid variants are worth considering. Just keep in mind they are thousands of dollars more expensive than a comparable conventional Tucson.",

      "expert_review": "The competition among mainstream compact SUVs has only gotten hotter since the current Hyundai Tucson made its debut for 2016. For 2019, the Tucson gets a mid-cycle freshening that helps it keep pace with redesigned or revised competitors, including such sales leaders as the Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4 and Nissan Rogue. (Compare them here.)\n\nStyling tweaks give the Tucson’s look a modest update, but the more significant changes include a revised powertrain lineup, tech upgrades and additional safety and driver assistance systems available across more trim levels. These changes make the 2019 more attractive and add value to a car that already boasts Hyundai’s long warranty. Trim levels are slightly juggled, now including a base SE and a repackaged and repositioned Value, plus the SEL, Sport, Limited, Night and Ultimate. The SEL Plus has been dropped. And the Night is new, offering a second, more upscale sporty model with blacked-out trim and bigger wheels that slots between the Limited and Utimate in features and price.\n\nStyling Dialed Back a Notch\n\nThe most obvious styling change is a version of Hyundai’s signature “cascading grille,” a larger mouth that brings the Tucson more in line with the look of other new Hyundais. Along with the grille comes a higher hood lip and a new bumper that make the front end look bulkier. The headlights look less stretched and now have boomerang-shaped accent lights, replacing the distinctive long slashes. The rear gets reshaped taillights and a new bumper. Available 17-, 18- and 19-inch wheels are also new; the top trims get 18s rather than 19s, which are saved for the more aggressive-looking Sport and Night.\n\nThe effect is a 2019 Tucson that’s softer and less bold than the one that debuted for 2016. It’s not like the 2015 Hyundai Sonata’s transformation from swoopy to staid, but the Tucson’s attitude quotient has been dialed back. On the styling Richter scale, the Tucson is mid-pack, with neither the high style of a 2019 Mazda CX-5 nor the aggressiveness of a redone Toyota RAV4.\n\nNo More Turbo\n\nThe base engine for the SE and Value trims has not changed: it’s a 161-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder mated to a six-speed automatic transmission. While compact SUVs increasingly feature downsized turbocharged engines, the Tucson steps back by dropping the old version’s optional 175-hp, turbocharged 1.6-liter and seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission, instead giving SEL and higher trims a conventional 181-hp, 2.4-liter four-cylinder and six-speed automatic. This powertrain first appeared in the 2018 Tucson Sport.\n\nThe new engine has a bit more horsepower but less torque — and it kicks in later: the old 1.6-liter produced 195 pounds-feet of torque starting at 1,500 rpm, while the 2.4-liter peaks at 175 pounds-feet when wound up to 4,000 rpm. While I’d never argue for less power, the new powertrain is a much better fit for the Tucson. It gives up a little pep off the line but shifts notably more smoothly around town, and mid-range acceleration for on-ramps or highway passing is adequate.\n\nThe six-speed automatic might seem an anachronism in a world of mileage-chasing eight- to 10-speed transmissions and continuously variable automatics, but the wider gear steps are a good companion for the 2.4-liter. It downshifts willingly to tap into more power, with only slight hesitation. I never caught it searching for the right gear or upshifting at the wrong time in a turn, as some of the more exotic gearboxes do. The 1.6-liter turbo had a jerkier personality on startup, and the dual-clutch automatic could be hard-shifting and balky. My only complaints about the 2.4-liter is that it exhibits some diesel-like clatter and its automatic stop-start system is a little rough (though you can turn it off).\n\nHandling feels competent and in control, though not sporty, and the steering has more weight — in a good way — than many Hyundais. The suspension is firmer and more European than some rivals, but the ride is very comfortable, competently handling rough city streets. The ride in the top trims seems more refined than in the 2018, possibly due to the switch to 18-inch wheels from the old Tucson’s 19s and their less compliant tires.\n\nGas mileage ratings for 2019 are unfortunately also anachronistic in an era when we expect increases with each model change. The 2018 Tucson was no leader as it was, and the 2019 moves in the wrong direction, with a 2 mpg decline in combined EPA estimates for the 2.4-liter versus the retired 1.6-liter. The 2019 is rated 22/28/25 mpg city/highway/combined with front-wheel drive and 21/26/23 with all-wheel drive. Compare it with the 2018 here. That’s far behind leaders like the CR-V and Nissan Rogue, whose front-wheel-drive models rate up to 28/34/30 and 26/33/29 mpg, respectively. The Tucson’s base engine is unchanged, with combined ratings of 26 (FWD) and 23 (AWD).\n\nInterior and Tech Upgraded\n\nThe interior looks familiar, with the fanciest trims still more tasteful than opulent. The big panoramic moonroof option adds airiness, and the dashboard is fully redone, with new designs for the instrument cluster, center multimedia display and controls. A 7-inch touchscreen with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay integration is standard on all but the Ultimate, which gets an 8-inch screen with navigation. The display now stands up, tablet-style, on the dash, which puts it in a better line of sight and brings it closer for the driver to hit not just the touchscreen, but also the volume and tuning knobs and the shortcut buttons that flank the screen. With the redone climate controls sitting below new air vents, the center of the dash looks cleaner and less busy. A swath of soft wrap with stitching adds a premium touch.\n\nThe 2019 Tucson switches to a standard electronic parking brake on the console. There’s a new front seat design for interiors with leather upholstery (Limited and Ultimate) that’s more supportive and comfortable on long drives. YES Essentials cloth seats are standard on other trim levels; it’s a fabric Hyundai says repels odors as well as stains.\n\nNewly available tech includes wireless phone charging, which another Cars.com editor noted  worked well even with his bulky phone case, unlike in some other vehicles. Higher trims of the 2019 also get a USB outlet for the backseat, though I still wish for another one up front to go with the solo USB media port and a pair of 12-volt outlets. The Value trim level and above get three years of free Hyundai Blue Link connectivity services, including remote start, remote lock/unlock, roadside help and stolen vehicle recovery.\n\nNew upscale options include a heated steering wheel and 360-degree camera system that was much appreciated in the city, though the image could be larger and sharper.\n\nReclining adjustments help create a backseat with comfortable room for tall adults, though the cushioning is a little stiff for my taste and the bottom cushion is a hair short for longer trips. The Ultimate adds heated outboard seats.\n\nThere are a few interior details, however, that Hyundai could add to make higher trim levels feel more competitive with top versions of some rivals. One would be paying more attention to soft-touch surfaces. That includes not just in places you touch — where there’s still too much hard plastic — but also details like soft bottoms in some of the cubbies to eliminate small-item rattling and sliding. Another thing would be a modern configurable instrument cluster display like the one in the CR-V. A Wi-Fi hot spot would be nice, too.\n\nAverage Storage and Cargo Space\n\nThe Tucson has average cabin storage for a family SUV, including a medium-sized covered bin in the center console, a large-device cubby under the dash (with power ports, USB input and optional wireless charging), a smaller cubby in front of the center cupholders, smallish door bins with space for bottles, and a slim-item cubby on the front passenger side of the center console that was just right for my iPad Mini.\n\nCargo space is where the Tucson shows its smaller footprint; it’s about 4 to 8 inches shorter than most rivals. The Tucson has 31.0 cubic feet behind the backseat and 61.9 cubic feet with the 60/40-split, folding backrests down. The space doesn’t seem small, though, and it proved adequate for several carry-on bags with the seats raised; folded, there was room for me to help a friend move. But it does come up shy of compact SUV haulers like the CR-V, which has 39.2 cubic feet with the seats up and 75.8 with them down, and the Rogue, which has 39.3/70.0 cubic feet.\n\nA two-level cargo floor can be raised to the higher position to make a flatter full-length load floor when the backseat is folded, which also leaves space to store the cargo cover out of sight. It can also be lowered about 2 inches to make space for taller or bulkier items. Optional is an excellent hands-free power liftgate; just stand next to it with the key fob in your pocket or purse and it gives three warning beeps then opens wide. It’s more convenient than rival systems that need no hands but do require you to wave your foot under the bumper.\n\nSafety and Driver-Assistance Tech Upgraded\n\nThe 2019 Tucson is an IIHS Top Safety Pick, earning top scores for crashworthiness and a superior score for the front collision system. But it missed out on the higher Top Safety Pick Plus designation due to low scores for its headlights; the LED headlights on Sport and higher trims are rated only acceptable, and the base system is rated poor. Only two models in the institute’s small SUV class, the Hyundai Kona and Mazda CX-5, earned a good headlight rating.\n\nFor 2019, all Tucson trims get a standard front collision system with automatic braking and lane-keeping assist, features previously available only for an extra cost on the top trim. The second-level Value trim adds standard blind spot warning and rear cross-traffic alert. This helps the Tucson keep up with rivals, though the 2019 Rogue and RAV4 still have more full-featured standard safety tech packages. The 2019 CR-V, however, still doesn’t offer such tech on its base model.\n\nThe Tucson also has new-for-2019 advanced safety tech options, including adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability, driver attention alert and automatic high beams. See a full list of safety features here.\n\nThe 2019 Tucson has not yet undergone a Cars.com Car Seat Check, but the previous version scored well and little of substance that would affect child seats has changed.\n\nValue Still Appeals\n\nThe 2019 Tucson starts at a competitive $24,245 — $715 higher than 2018, but with added standard safety technology. But the highlight of the Tucson’s features-for-the-dollar equation — and worth its higher price — is the mid-range SEL, which starts at $26,645 (all prices include a destination fee) with FWD. It adds upscale exterior details, features like dual-zone automatic climate control, a second USB port in back and safety tech. Plus it adds the more satisfying 2.4-liter powertrain. Compare all Tucson trim levels here.\n\nThe value equation versus rivals extends to the fully loaded Ultimate, which is $33,995 with all-wheel drive. That undercuts similarly equipped AWD compact SUVs like the top CR-V Touring at $35,195, a 2019 RAV4 Limited with the top tech package at $38,815, and a Nissan Rogue SL with the Premium Package at $34,560. The Tucson also adds peace of mind thanks to Hyundai’s warranty, which provides five years/60,000 miles of vehicle coverage and 10 years/100,000 miles of powertrain coverage.\n\nThe Tucson may not be a star in any one area, but it’s a solid compact SUV all-around. One trade-off is that it’s also a bit smaller than most, so it might appeal most to shoppers who value parking ease and maneuverability over maximum hauling capacity.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
