      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nHyundai made a host of updates to its rear-wheel-drive Genesis Coupe last year, including a gaping hexagon grille more power from the two available engines. The four-seat Genesis Coupe competes against sporty cars as divergent as the Ford Mustang and Honda Civic Si.\n\nNew for 2014\nCruise control, heated side mirrors, fog lights and an auto-dimming rearview mirror with HomeLink controls are now standard. The standard manual transmission adds a hill start feature designed to prevent the car from rolling backward while the available automatic transmission gains a downshift rev-match feature.\n\nExterior Highlights\n\n18- or 19-inch alloy wheels\nLED taillights\nAvailable xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights\nAvailable LED daytime running lights\nChrome dual exhaust tips\nAvailable rear spoiler\nAvailable power sunroof\n\nInterior Highlights\n\nCloth upholstery; cloth/leather or leather seats available\nLeather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob\nTilt/telescoping steering wheel\nCruise control\nAir conditioning; automatic climate control available\nPaddle shifters with automatic transmission\nBluetooth connectivity\nCD stereo with iPod connectivity and MP3 jack; Infinity premium stereo available\nAvailable touch-screen navigation system\nAvailable heated front seats\nAvailable aluminum pedals\nAvailable subscription-based Blue Link communication service\nAvailable illuminated sill plates\n\nUnder the Hood\n\n274-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine with 275 pounds-feet of torque\nAvailable 348-hp, 3.8-liter V-6 with 295 pounds-feet of torque\nSix-speed manual or eight-speed automatic transmission\nSport- or track-tuned suspension, the latter with adjustable front camber\nFront strut-tower brace\nAvailable Brembo-brand brakes\nAvailable limited-slip differential\n\nSafety Features\n\nAntilock brakes\nElectronic stability syste\nTraction control\nSide-impact airbags for the front seats\nSide curtain airbags\nActive front head restraints",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe four-seat Hyundai Genesis coupe comes with a standard V-6 engine that works with a manual or automatic transmission. It has rear-wheel drive and competes against sporty cars as divergent as the Ford Mustang and Honda Civic Si.\n\nNew for 2015\n\nThe turbo four-cylinder engine has been dropped, leaving the 348-horsepower V-6 as the standard and only engine. LED daytime running lights are newly standard. The 3.8 R-Spec model gains a proximity key with push-button start and automatic climate control.\n\nBelow is a list of highlighted features and not an exhaustive list.

      "expert_review": "In its first three model years (2010-2012), the Hyundai Genesis Coupe 2.0T was not a car I could get excited about (read my review of the 2011 2.0T R-Spec here). Its poky engine and sloppy handling made it under-deliver on its billing as an affordable, rear-wheel-drive performance coupe. Fortunately, the new 2013 version brings relief. (Please note that the Genesis Coupe shouldn’t be confused with Hyundai’s Genesis sedan, a very different luxury model covered separately.)\n\nThe redesigned 2013 Genesis 2.0T is better in a big way, with more power and a retuned suspension, though an unflattering-sounding engine hurts the otherwise-improved driving experience.\n\nWhat may be even more damaging, though, is that the competition has stepped up in the form of two new rival track models — the 2013 Scion FR-S and the related 2013 Subaru BRZ — that take a better-executed approach to affordable performance.\n\nThe Genesis Coupe is available with a four- or six-cylinder engine, both of which get power increases for 2013. I drove the four-cylinder 2.0T Premium with the new eight-speed automatic transmission on regular roads and the 3.8 R-Spec with a manual transmission on a racetrack. To compare specifications between 2012 and 2013, see here.\n\nNewfound Power, Newfound Fun\nThe 2013’s standard turbocharged four-cylinder engine got one heck of a power increase: 64 more horsepower. Now making 274 hp when using premium gasoline, the bump is hugely noticeable in the form of a rush of acceleration that the old engine never came close to delivering. The 2013 Hyundai Genesis Coupe offers stoplight-to-stoplight gusto that the modestly powered FR-S and BRZ can’t match. The added power for 2013 comes from a new, more-efficient turbocharger and a larger intercooler.\n\nMore power doesn’t solve all the 2.0’s problems; it’s still an unpleasant, unrefined sounding engine — a sentiment echoed by each editor who drove the coupe. I’d like to see additional insulation used to quiet the harsh engine noises. It’s so bad it’s a potential deal breaker when cross-shopping against other cheap-speed coupes. The 3.8-liter V-6, which gets 42 more horsepower for 2013 — for a total of 348 hp — is still the more refined engine option, by far.\n\nThe new four-banger squeaks out a lower 260-hp rating when running on regular gasoline. I can’t say for certain that my test car was running on regular fuel when I started driving, but the car’s performance became more consistent after filling up with premium. Before then, the engine fell flat half the time I punched the accelerator, like it was being held back by engine management and not delivering the power it should have. Once it was filled with premium, the car consistently squealed the tires and accelerated with surprising urgency.\n\nEight-Speed Automatic Transmission\nA new eight-speed automatic transmission helps the 2.0T get an EPA-estimated 20/31 mpg city/highway, which is 1 mpg better on the highway than the previous 2.0T automatic, despite the increased power. One editor averaged 29.9 mpg in the 2013 on a highway trip of about 130 miles. The automatic-equipped FR-S and BRZ are rated 25/34 mpg with automatic transmissions, 22/30 mpg with manuals, but neither car has the Hyundai Genesis Coupe’s quick acceleration.\n\nI’m not sold on the transmission’s operation. The eight-speed unit is always upshifting and searching for gears, like a bad movie car chase where the driver upshifts 20 times in one scene. The loud engine makes the constant upshifting and gear hunting even more noticeable and annoying. A Sport mode and paddle shifters are standard with the automatic, though I don’t think they made the driving experience any sportier. In Manual mode, the transmission automatically upshifts when approaching redline; many performance cars let the engine bounce off the rev limiter, like a real manual transmission does, if you don’t change gears.\n\nThe standard transmission is a six-speed manual with mileage ratings of 21/30 mpg. The automatic is optional on base models and can be had for an extra $1,250. It comes standard on the 2.0T Premium that I tested, which goes for $29,625, including an $875 destination charge.\n\nInterior & Cargo\nThe coupe’s inside won’t be mistaken for the more luxurious Genesis sedan, but it’s an improvement over the previous interior, which felt outdated even at its introduction. A redesigned center dash and added stitching along the upper dashboard contribute to a more contemporary look. Not everyone was impressed with the accent stitching; one editor said it did a poor job imitating a real stitched-leather dashboard. The material quality of our 2.0T Premium was similar to the Scion FR-S and Subaru BRZ, but it lags behind the Ford Mustang V6 Premium trim, which uses higher-quality materials across the dashboard.\n\nA welcome new feature is the telescoping steering wheel that adds adjustability for comfort and safety; the 2013 Mustang still doesn’t have one.\n\nThe Hyundai Genesis Coupe isn’t a people-hauler, unless the people are relatively small: The backseat couldn’t accommodate my 6-foot frame. I had to hunch over and grab my knees, as the sloping roofline provides minimal headroom. Backseat room likely isn’t a priority for sporty-coupe shoppers, but at least the Mustang and especially the Dodge Challenger have room for adults to fit in back.\n\nThe Genesis Coupe may be 15.6 inches longer than the Scion FR-S, but both cars’ backseats are similarly useless for adults. I’ll give the FR-S a pass because of its overall size, but the longer Genesis Coupe’s lack of headroom is surprising. The added size shows up in the trunk, where a wide, flat cargo area measures 10 cubic feet; the FR-S has 6.9 cubic feet. The Genesis Coupe’s cargo volume may seem small considering the Mustang’s 13.4 cubic feet, but the usable space inside the Hyundai is more than that number suggests.\n\nUp front, three new gauges in the center dashboard display turbocharger boost (psi), fuel economy and oil temperature in 2.0T models; in the non-turbocharged 3.8-liter, the boost display is replaced by a torque readout. I like the new gauges, especially the boost gauge, which gives the cluster an aftermarket feel. Unfortunately, all the gauges are practically useless in that they’re completely out of sight while driving, located midlevel in the center dashboard instead of higher up, within easy glance.\n\nHyundai’s BlueLink emergency communication system is standard on the 2.0T Premium and includes voice-activated options like point-of-interest searches, texting (with a compatible phone) and turn-by-turn navigation. You can read more about BlueLink here.\n\nRide & Handling\nOne of my biggest gripes with the previous two-door Hyundai Genesis Coupe was how squirrely it handled with electronic stability control turned off, and how intrusive the stability system was when activated. It was a lose-lose situation, even with the R-Spec’s upgraded suspension. I’d gladly take the 2013 2.0T Premium I tested over the old 2.0T R-Spec, as the 2013 is more refined and predictable. The car tracks cleaner through corners, where previously the rear end would swing out.\n\nThankfully, the improved handling doesn’t sacrifice the Genesis Coupe’s feasibility as a daily driver. It still rides nicely over rough roads without much noise from the suspension.\n\nIt’s definitely an improvement over the previous Hyundai Genesis Coupe, but how about the natural comparison with the similarly priced FR-S? Honestly, there is no comparison. The FR-S is a sports car with handling balance and precision unmatched by any other coupe, including the Genesis Coupe. Sure, the 2.0T is faster in a straight line, but as an overall handling package, the heavier Genesis Coupe can’t compete.\n\nI drove a 3.8 R-Spec and Subaru BRZ around the Road America racetrack, where the BRZ quickly ran out of steam on the straightaways but felt worlds more composed than the Hyundai when braking and cornering. Still, the 2013 Genesis Coupe is an improvement over the previous model year, and stability control doesn’t cut into the driving experience like the old version did around the same track.\n\nExterior\nThe front got the most attention for 2013, with a similar face as you’ll find on other Hyundai cars. The new look, with wide-mouth front styling, is welcome; the original coupe’s styling was already growing old after only a few model years. Compared with the 2012, the 2013’s front styling, with LED running lamps, is vastly different and took a few days to grow on me. The whole car now looks freshened, even though all that’s changed is the front styling and the addition of a few highlights, including heat extractor “cues” on the hood — meaning they’re non-functional. They do look good, however.\n\nSafety Hyundai\nThe Genesis Coupe hasn’t been crash-tested. Standard safety features include front, side-impact and side curtain airbags, as well as active front head restraints. See how well child-safety seats fit in the Genesis Coupe here.\n\nHyundai Genesis Coupe in the Market\nThere’s no questioning the 2013 Hyundai Genesis Coupe 2.0T is an improvement over the 2012. At $25,125, including destination, it’s $2,000 more than the outgoing 2012 model. It’s a nice coupe with more bang for your buck versus the outgoing model, but it’s not a great coupe because of that pesky engine’s raucousness — also because the FR-S and BRZ are more dedicated sports cars at the same price. Unfortunately, the more-refined V-6 trim level is a big price jump, going for $29,625 for a stripped R-Spec model or $32,875 for the next step up, the Grand Touring.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nPositioned as an affordable sports car, the rear-wheel-drive Genesis coupe is in a price class with the Ford Mustang, Chevrolet Camaro and Nissan 370Z. Like Hyundai’s upscale Genesis sedan, however, Hyundai hopes the four-seat coupe will go toe-to-toe with the Infiniti G37 coupe, one of the benchmarks used during the car’s development.\n\nThe coupe comes in two basic models, each named for its 2.0- and 3.8-liter engines, in three trim levels apiece. The base turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder is the 2.0T, and there are pricier 2.0T Premium and 2.0T R-Spec versions. Models with the 3.8-liter V-6 are the 3.8 R-Spec, the 3.8 Grand Touring and 3.8 Track.\n \nThe tuner-focused R-Spec models have the operative Track components and lower prices but fewer features.\n\nNew for 2012\nThere are no significant changes for the 2012 model year.\n\nExterior\nThe coupe has sleek lines, and the projector-beam headlights flank a small upper grille that’s marked with the Hyundai badge, unlike the Genesis sedan. Exterior features include:\n\n\nStandard 18-inch alloy wheels\n19-inch alloy wheels (R-Spec, Track)\nXenon high-intensity-discharge headlights (3.8 Track)\nRed Brembo-brand brake calipers (R-Spec, Track)\n\nInterior\nThe Genesis coupe has “2+2” seating, which means two front seats and two small rear seats that are best left for children or parcels. Though it’s not as luxurious as the Genesis sedan, the Genesis coupe has comparable blue-backlit gauges, pleasant materials and upscale touches, like a leather-wrapped shift knob and a steering wheel with audio and cruise-control buttons. Interior features include:\n\n\nStandard remote keyless entry\nStandard Bluetooth, iPod connectivity\nAvailable leather upholstery\nAvailable automatic climate control\nAvailable touch-screen navigation system\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Genesis coupe’s base engine is a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that generates 210 horsepower. A 306-hp, 3.8-liter V-6 is available. Hyundai claims a zero-to-60-mph time of less than 6 seconds. Mechanical features include:\n\n\nStandard six-speed manual transmission\nAvailable five- or six-speed automatic with steering-wheel shift paddles\nFour-wheel independent suspension\nAvailable track-tuned suspension\n\nSafety\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes are standard, and the Track replaces the lesser trim levels’ single-piston brake calipers with four-piston Brembo-brand calipers and larger rotors. Rear parking sensors are optional. Standard safety features include:\n\n\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes with brake assist\nElectronic stability system\nSide-impact airbags for the front seats\nSide curtain airbags\nActive front seat head restraints",

      "expert_review": "The 2009 Hyundai Genesis sedan surprised many when it captured the North American Car of the Year award from the nation’s automotive wordsmiths.\n\nHyundai had won a loyal, if limited, following in the last few years by creating small, high-mileage, low-priced, well-equipped front-wheel-drive cars that put quality ahead of quantity.\n\nThe surprise was that the Genesis sedan introduced for 2009 year signaled a new approach — a large, well-appointed, yet moderately priced rear-wheel-drive sedan.\n\nAnd now Hyundai has added a 2010 Genesis coupe, a smaller (4.6-inch shorter wheelbase/13-inch shorter length) two-door companion.\n\nKudos to the design staff. Admirers stopped, gawked and asked its ancestry, surprised it was South Korean. The long, low, wide hood suggests a secure stance on the road. The raised deck lid sports a modest, decorative spoiler. Deeply sculptured accent lines along the rear quarter panels and doors hint at spirited movement.\n\nInside, those who deeply admire the sedan may wince at the coupe’s limitations. The roofline slopes forward, which dictates how much you have to duck to get in and out. But where the missing 13 inches are felt most is in rear-seat legroom. Front seats come thisclose to touching rear seats even with no 6-footers up front.\n\nPerforated leather seats keep occupants from slipping around, while large side bolsters hold them in place in aggressive motoring. But those who designed the front seats misjudged the human body’s ability to withstand one-size-fits-all headrests that poke most in the neck or melon rather than rest along the neck between shoulders and head.\n\nTrunk space is adequate, but the opening is not very big. A lever in the trunk releases the rear seat back, but you have to lower it from inside the cabin to gain cargo space. No matter for that inconvenience; the tiny gap between trunk and cabin limits utility to golf clubs.\n\nThe sports suspension is tuned so the coupe travels in the direction the wheel points without wandering. Handling benefits from traction control for smooth, slip-free takeoffs, and stability control for optimum control into and out of corners. No slips, dips or dives.\n\nRear-wheel drive means near-even weight distribution for balance and optimum performance. Unlike a front-wheel-drive coupe that pulls sharply to one side at hard acceleration, Genesis holds a straight line without wiggling to gain speed for takeoff.\n\nAll-wheel-drive isn’t under consideration — yet.\n\nUsually ride is sacrificed for handling, but this coupe provided jostle-free motoring even over a series of exaggerated tar marks left by highway workers who obviously didn’t want to come back and fill the cracks again next year. The coupe keeps teeth from rattling, but the sedan is smoother.\n\nWhere the coupe gains the most fans, other than its looks, is from the 3.8-liter, 306-horsepower V-6 with a 6-speed automatic and manual mode shifting. The V-6 is very alert and quickly responds to pedal pressure. The zero-to-60 claim is 5.7 seconds, fast enough to lead rather than follow.\n\nA 2-liter, 210-hp, turbocharged 4-cylinder is available for those who want performance but a little better mileage. It’s rated at 20 mpg city/30 highway versus 17/27 for the V-6, both with automatic.\n\nBase price is $29,000, and you don’t need options. Heated leather power seats; power tilt/slide sunroof; automatic temperature control; power mirrors (heated)/locks/windows; AM/FM/XM radio with MP3/CD player; Bluetooth phone; side-curtain air bags; anti-lock brakes; auto-dimming mirror with compass; and push-button start are standard.\n\nGenesis coupe and sedan cater to different personalities. The sedan is more for those who enjoy a machine with a little spirit and a lot of luxury, the coupe for enthusiasts who measure fun in zero-to-60.\n\nAWD would be a pleasant option for Snow Belt motorists. And how about a hardtop convertible for a fashion accessory?\n\nRead Jim Mateja Sunday in Rides. Contact him at transportation@tribune.com.\n\nTribune Media Services",

      "expert_review": "Hyundai’s Genesis coupe R-Spec is a stripper — and not the kind you’ll find in a gentleman’s club. The R-Spec’s goal is performance for the dollar, which means features that don’t make the car faster are stripped to keep costs low, while high-performance parts from the coupe’s Track model are added.\n\nThe 2011 Genesis coupe 2.0T R-Spec is on the right track with its low price ($24,500), but it falls short in the “bang” department with a poky turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine and unrefined handling.\n\nThe V-6-powered Genesis coupe 3.8 also comes in R-Spec garb, but we have yet to test that version. See our 2010 Genesis coupe review here for a more thorough look at the coupe as a whole.\n\nWhat You Get\nThe R-Spec’s suspension — the same one that can be found on the coupe’s Track models — has stiffer springs than the base suspension, plus unique shock absorbers, thicker stabilizer bars and a strut-tower brace. I’ve driven this setup both on the street and on a racetrack, where the R-Spec’s handling often feels unpredictable and squirrely. The rear end is eager to slide around when the electronic stability system is switched off, which isn’t the most welcome feeling. Rear-wheel-drive coupes like the 2011 Chevrolet Camaro V-6 and 2011 Ford Mustang V-6 (with the Performance Package) handle more predictably.\n\nI know what you’re probably thinking: “So turn the stability control on, dummy!” I wish it were that easy. The Genesis’ stability system reacts way too aggressively during spirited driving. It ruins any possible fun by cutting engine power abruptly, stopping the coupe dead in its tracks. The Camaro’s and Mustang’s systems are less intrusive and can smoothly reel in tail-happy drivers.\n\nOn the upside, the Track suspension is perfectly manageable as a daily driver, without being overly harsh or bouncy. Sometimes a “sport” suspension doesn’t provide sporty performance, it just beats up drivers with a rough ride instead. The R-Spec’s agreeable ride is an admirable feat for its 19-inch wheels wrapped in high-performance, stiff-sidewalled summer tires. However, I would gladly sacrifice some of the R-Spec’s ride quality for a more refined handling experience.\n\nRounding out the R-Spec package is a Brembo braking system and limited-slip differential. The brakes may be overkill for use on the street: Like many upgraded braking systems, they don’t offer much of a different feel until taken to the track, but they do look great combined with the R-Spec’s wheels. A limited-slip differential isn’t out of the ordinary for cheap-speed cars; one can also be had in the 2011 Mazdaspeed3, the 2012 Honda Civic Si and the Mustang V-6. The Camaro V-6 includes one only on models with manual transmissions.\n\nWhat You Can’t Get\nI wouldn’t normally focus on features a car doesn’t have, but R-Spec models offer no optional equipment — not even features that come standard on the less-expensive base model, including cruise control, automatic headlights and upgraded interior trim pieces. These deletions do keep its price low, however, and the only feature I really missed was cruise control.\n\nThose wanting a sunroof, navigation, automatic transmission or a choice between more than three exterior colors can cross the R-Spec off their list. The pricier Genesis coupe 2.0T Premium is a feature-laden model with all the aforementioned options, sans the R-Spec’s performance upgrades.\n\nEven with those features deleted, the R-Spec isn’t a total stripper: It retains carpet, air conditioning, power windows and locks, a USB audio input and steering-wheel audio controls.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder feels more powerful than its 210-horsepower rating suggests. Even so, it doesn’t move the coupe quickly enough to make it stand out from the competition. The Mazdaspeed3, Subaru Impreza WRX and six-cylinder versions of the Mustang and Camaro have more to brag about under the hood.\n\nEditor Mike Hanley mentioned in his review of the 2010 Genesis coupe that the 306-hp, 3.8-liter V-6 engine is the way to go in this car, and I agree. At $26,750, the 3.8 R-Spec is a worthier choice because the base car itself is already a more potent performer, even before the R-Spec additions. Plus, the 3.8 R-Spec represents a $4,000 discount versus the Track trim level with the same performance upgrades. That’s a bargain if you’re comfortable with deleting certain convenience features. The 3.8 addresses half of my beef with the coupe, though it still has the same handling issues as the 2.0T R-Spec.\n\nBoth engines pair with a six-speed manual transmission. With a name like R-Spec, a manual transmission is the only way to go. The shifter needs improvement, though; its rubbery, vague feeling doesn’t inspire confidence during quick gear changes.\n\nSafety\nStandard safety features include front and side-impact airbags, side curtain airbags, an electronic stability system with traction control, and active head restraints. Click here to see the entire list of the safety features.\n\nAs of this writing, the 2011 Genesis coupe hasn’t been crash-tested.\n\nGenesis coupe R-Spec in the Market\nHyundai touts the 2.0T R-Spec as “the ultimate upgradeable, affordable, turbocharged rear-wheel-drive performance platform.” Even if the R-Spec’s flaws are addressed by throwing aftermarket upgrades at the engine and suspension, buyers will just be spending more money to match competition that already does cheap speed better. A little more research and development in the handling and engine department would go a long way toward making the R-Spec a more refined overall package.\n\nemail",
