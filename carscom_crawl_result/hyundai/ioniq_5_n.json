      "expert_review": "The all-electric 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 N certainly looks the part of a performance vehicle, with flared fenders, aggressive wheels, massive brakes, visible aerodynamic elements and bright orange accents. On paper, it can play the part, too, with 601 horsepower as standard — and up to 641 hp for 10 seconds at a time when N Grin Boost is engaged — plus a laundry list of performance-oriented features. But is it an engaging enthusiast car that just happens to be an electric vehicle? We took one to Great Lakes Dragaway in Union Grove, Wisc., to find out just how much fun the Ioniq 5 N can be.\n\nRelated: Completely Wild EV Performance: Hyundai Ioniq 5 N Gets 641 HP for the Track\n\nWe wanted to measure how quick the Ioniq 5 N is from 0-60 mph and in the quarter-mile — but that’s only part of the performance equation. Plenty of EVs are quick in a straight line but don’t offer much fun when cornering. So, we set up an autocross course to put the Ioniq 5 N through its paces and see if it could, well, handle itself … well. We also conducted 60-0 mph braking tests to see how good the nearly 5,000-pound EV was at hauling itself down to a stop.\n\nAcceleration and Braking Results\n\nThe Ioniq 5 N is quick. With a 3.3-second 0-60 time on the way to an 11.2-second sprint in the quarter-mile — finishing at 124 mph — the Ioniq 5 N is one of the five quickest cars we’ve ever tested at a drag strip. With N Launch Control set to the highest of its three grip settings, the process of launching the car was almost too easy, and the Ioniq 5 N had the courtesy to make the sprint down the track as calm as something this quick can be. The times were eminently repeatable, too; the only deviation occurred when I turned off N Launch Control to turn on the N e-Shift feature, which simulates Hyundai’s eight-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission all the way down to the physical sensation of shifting gears. That run was slower — 3.9 seconds for 0-60 and 11.9 seconds in the quarter-mile — but felt slightly more entertaining, with the car “shifting” into “5th gear” just as I crossed the quarter-mile mark.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nTo get these results takes some planning and patience, however. Hyundai recommends a state of charge of at least 95% for acceleration runs, as well as using N Battery Preconditioning for optimal drag-strip performance. It also recommends preconditioning the battery for an additional 30 minutes once it reaches its optimal operating temperature in order to maintain that level of heat.\n\nWith a relatively low rated range — EPA-estimated at 221 miles, though the instrument panel was showing around 260 miles of range on a full charge for us — you might have to dip into a significant portion of it to just get to the track unless it’s in your neighborhood. Then you’ll need to find charging very near or at the track to get your state of charge back up for maximum performance. Alternatively, you can trailer your Ioniq 5 N to the track, but the costs involved with that are not insignificant. This isn’t to say that gas-powered track cars require zero prep time, but that the infrastructure support for EVs may not be present or as accessible yet.\n\nBraking was also incredibly impressive, stopping the heavy EV in a heartbeat while nearly launching me into the steering wheel and sending my stomach into cartwheels. It took just 130 feet to bring the Ioniq 5 N to a stop from 60 mph.\n\nAutocross Impressions\n\nIt’s cool that the Ioniq 5 N is very quick in a straight line, but two of Hyundai’s three principles governing N performance cars — Corner Rascal and Racetrack Capability — aren’t covered by drag-strip testing. Would the Ioniq 5 N be quick (and fun) on our autocross course?\n\nWith balance, grip and a nimbleness that belies its weight, the Ioniq 5 N gave us our money’s worth and then some on the course. Where the faux transmission behavior and engine noise of N Active Sound+ felt like pandering on the drag strip, here they demonstrated some value, providing valuable feedback and control. I had my most confident runs with N e-Shift and N Active Sound+ activated, with the systems providing the type of ambient feedback so often missing from EVs in performance situations. I played around with other settings, too, like the adjustable torque distribution feature, which noticeably changed the character of the drive as I pushed more torque rearward from its initial 50:50 split. More rear bias made the Ioniq 5 N more tail-happy, and the N Drift Optimizer made it even more so, but the latter cancels N e-Shift, which was more valuable to me.\n\nThe steering was nicely weighted and communicative, and the body control was outstanding. The car rotates easily and willingly (or less so if you play with the torque distribution) while remaining flat in corners and not nosediving under hard braking. The Ioniq 5 N is rowdy, raucous and indeed rascally in the corners, and it gleefully holds its own against similarly priced internal-combustion performance cars.\n\nMy biggest issues with the car are that the fake sounds can feel pandering and might wear on me after an extended time behind the wheel, and that not all of the nifty N features can work together. The first is fairly easily correctable, whether by turning off the sounds or Hyundai adding new ones via future over-the-air updates. The second is probably more difficult to fix, but it would be nice to be able to combine these features as the driver likes; I would especially like N Launch Control to work with N e-Shift, thereby giving me faster times and the feeling I enjoyed.\n\nSenior Road Test Editor Mike Hanley also drove the Ioniq 5 N on our autocross course, and here’s what he had to say:\n\n“For a big, heavy vehicle, the Ioniq 5 N managed its mass well through our cone course, and it was fairly easy to rotate its tail coming out of corners. I also liked the performance soundtrack and simulated shift feel, which added a layer of familiar driver feedback that’s missing from some EVs.\n\n“The car was a little harder to hustle through the course when N Pedal was active. The feature uses the regenerative braking system to help manage weight transfer, but it didn’t feel as natural to me. The Ioniq 5 N comes standard with 21-inch forged-alloy wheels fitted with Pirelli P Zero summer tires that offer decent grip, but they are fairly expensive to replace at more than $500 a piece.”\n\nIs the Ioniq 5 N an Enthusiast EV?\n\nThe 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 N is a joy to drive and its performance punches well above its considerable weight and nearly $68,000 price tag. There are compromises, certainly, but what performance car doesn’t have compromises? Enthusiasts looking for a spirited daily driver and a performance bargain would do well to consider the Ioniq 5 N.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 N Up Close: Optionally Silent Fury, Questionable Comfort\nBest Electric Vehicle of 2024\n2024 Hyundai Ioniq 5: Little Improvement Needed, Starts at $42,985\nWhat to Know Before Purchasing an Electric Vehicle: A Buying Guide\nShop for a 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 N\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
