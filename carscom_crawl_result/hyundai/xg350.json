      "expert_review": "When the 2002 XG350 sedan was introduced last fall, even the Koreans wondered whether America was ready for a $25,000 Hyundai. After all, U.S. buyers were more accustomed to cheap and cheap-feeling products from this part of Asia. Now, the answer to that question appears to be “yes.”\n\nWith the prices of Japanese-brand near-luxury sedans rapidly escalating into the 30s, the XG350 is looking pretty tempting — especially when you consider how much standard equipment is bundled into that price. As good as the 2002 edition is, however, the XG350 still needs some additional refinement.\n\nHe: Let me say right out in front that if I’m spending $25,000 of my own money on a new mid-size sedan, my preference is still a Toyota Camry or a Honda Accord. But I can make a strong case for the XG350 being a much better value for the same money. Hyundai’s flagship in the U.S. really competes with more expensive cars, including the Toyota Avalon and even the Buick Regal. I say more expensive because by the time you price out those competitors with comparable equipment and features, they tend to cost several thousand dollars more than the XG350.\n\nShe: Ah, that’s the intellectual argument. When I look at the XG350, I see a big Korean bottle of Geritol. How can a 2002 model look like an old car? And I don’t mean retro, like the Thunderbird. I mean something your grizzled old uncle would drive. But you’re telling me it’s good for me and my pocketbook, huh?\n\nHe: My grizzled old uncle thinks you’re a snob. And besides, he always drove Chevies. If you want to get philosophical, the whole concept of a $25,000 Hyundai is more believable than the $70,000 luxury sedan that Volkswagen wants to sell here next year. I just wish Hyundai would work a little harder on the execution. It’s hard to envision the XG350 as a true near-luxury sedan when it comes with a cheap-looking plastic wind deflector on the roof that has exposed screw heads. Tacky.\n\nShe: I just can’t imagine any of my friends going out of their way to buy this car, no matter how good a deal it is. And it is a good deal. For the money, you get a standard power moonroof, five-speed automatic transmission, power heated front seats, a CD player, Michelin tires and 16-inch alloy wheels. All good stuff. And you can’t beat the standard safety features — four-wheel disc brakes with ABS, traction control and side air bags. That’s amazing. If you put all that equipment on a Camry or Accord, you’d probably be pushing $30,000.\n\nHe: The XG350 has a really comfortable ride, thanks in part to an all-independent suspension, but it steers and handles like an old-man’s car. Hyundai dropped a bigger engine for 2002 — a twin-cam 3.5-liter V-6 — that feels a lot spunkier than the old 3.0-liter unit. But it only makes 191 horsepower, which is less than most of the competition. Nissan’s twin-cam 3.5-liter V-6, for instance, makes 255 horsepower in the Maxima, which is a lot more entertaining to drive than the XG350.\n\nShe: Still, the Koreans beat the Japanese, the Americans and the Europeans when it comes to warranty protection and peace of mind. This biggest and most expensive Hyundai comes with a five-year/60,000-mile basic warranty, plus five-year unlimited roadside assistance. All of a sudden, taking Geritol sounds good. Especially since the car I own now has only a two-year warranty.\n\nHe: OK, we’ve established that the XG350 is a good value for the money, with really nice safety features. But how well-built is it? I think the kindest way to put it is that the XG continues to improve, but its quality is still not on a par with the Japanese competitors. We had problems with wind and engine noise. And while the cabin was spacious and nicely laid out, some of the plastic pieces didn’t fit together that well, and the wood trim still looks fake and cheap. C’mon, guys. Just a little more effort, and you’re going to have a really great near-luxury sedan for under $30,000.\n\nMy biggest issue is with the styling. I think the Korean designers ought to start hanging around the valet stands at American shopping malls. They’d get a better idea of style, or at least what passes for style in this country.\n\n2002 Hyundai XG350\n\nAnita’s rating: (Acceptable)\n\nPaul’s rating: (Above average)\n\nLikes: Great value at $26,000 for a fully loaded near-luxury sedan. Excellent standard safety equipment, including side air bags, ABS and traction control. More displacement and more power for 2002. Loads of standard features, including power moonroof and full power accessories. Novel five-speed automatic with manual-shift feature. Great ride comfort. Outstanding warranty.\n\nDislikes: Wood trim still looks fake. Still rather own a Camry or an Accord. Bland design looks too stodgy. Quality is improving, but still not up to Japanese levels. Engine is noisy. Steering feels vague and over-assisted. Exposed screw heads on moonroof wind deflector look tacky.\n\nType: Front-engine, front-wheel drive, five-passenger sedan.\n\nPrice: Base, $25,599; as tested, $26,245 (inc. $495 destination charge).\n\nEngine: 3.5-liter V-6; 194-hp; 216 lb-ft torque.\n\nEPA fuel economy: 18 mpg city/26 mpg highway.\n\n12-month insurance cost, estimated by AAA Michigan: $1,377 (Rates may be higher or lower, depending on coverage and driving record.)\n\nWhere built: Korea",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nA larger V-6 engine went into Hyundais upscale sedan for 2002, changing the model designation from XG300 to XG350. For the 2003 model year, the XG350 is a carryover and modifications are minimal.\n\nLaunched in 2001 and aimed squarely at the U.S. market, the XG300/350 is based on the Korean-market XG Grandeur. Built on the same front-wheel-drive (FWD) platform as the midsize Sonata, the XG350 not only displays a more formal look but it also measures 4.6 inches longer in overall length. It is available in base and L trim levels.\n\nUntil the past couple of years, Hyundai  South Koreas largest automaker  was known for small, inexpensive cars. The company had also started off on a dubious note by encountering quality problems that have since been addressed. Nowadays, Hyundais products have grown a lot more appealing as each model is redesigned. Launching the XG300 in 2001 moved the South Korean automaker into higher-priced territory.\n\nPositioned as an upper midsize model, the FWD sedan competes against the Honda Accord, Nissan Maxima, Oldsmobile Intrigue, Toyota Camry and other midsize models that sell for more than $20,000.\n\nExterior\nThe XG350 presents a more elegant and formal appearance than the Sonata, which has been marketed in the United States much longer. Its based on the same FWD platform as the Sonata, but the XG350 is larger in most dimensions. A Lincoln-style vertical-bar grille and taillamps help give the newest sedan a memorable appearance. Alloy wheels hold 16-inch tires.\n\nInterior\nThe XG350s five-passenger seating capacity consists of front bucket seats and a three-place rear bench. Leather upholstery is standard, which sets the tone for the amenities that a buyer can anticipate. Headroom is adequate and legroom is ample for taller passengers in the backseat. The split rear seatback folds down to yield additional cargo space. Standard equipment includes automatic-temperature air conditioning, power front seats, cruise control, a cassette/CD stereo and remote keyless entry with an alarm. The XG350 L adds a power sunroof and a seat/mirror memory system. Cargo space totals 14.5 cubic feet.\n\nUnder the Hood\nHyundais 3.5-liter V-6 engine develops 194 horsepower. A five-speed Shiftronic automatic transmission permits manual gear selection.\n\nSafety\nAll-disc antilock brakes, traction control and side-impact airbags for the front seats are standard.\n\nDriving Impressions\nConsidering the original 3.0-liter V-6 engine in the XG300 produced rather vigorous performance, the extra displacement and improved torque output in the XG350 cannot help but make acceleration even more satisfying. The XG350 is easy to drive, and it also handles capably and rides comfortably; however, significant road imperfections may result in a bit of jarring to occupants. Those passengers can expect to savor a roomy, well-furnished interior and a pleasantly quiet engine.\n\nMore stylish than other Hyundai models, the XG350 promises a lot of automobile for a moderate midsize price. Shoppers at the higher end of the Honda Accord/Toyota Camry spectrum might find a test drive worthwhile.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2003 Buying Guide\nPosted on 1/24/03",

      "expert_review": "An Accessible Taste of Luxury\n2004 Hyundai XG350 L sedan\n\nPARIS\n\nThe rooms are dark. The services are marginal. The prices are steep.\n\nBut customers still clamor to get into the Hotel Clarion Saint-James & Albany here. They crave the luxury of location.\n\nThe hotel is a short walk to the Louvre Museum and other important cultural and historical sites. People are willing to pay for that perceived advantage.\n\nIt proves that luxury is a matter of perception. Consider another example, the 2004 Hyundai XG350L sedan. It has everything that more expensive automobiles possess — everything except a prestigious name and a high-end price tag.\n\nAmong purists, the absence of pedigree and extravagant pricing disqualify people and things from membership in the luxury class. Purists believe in the doctrine of exclusivity. To wit: That which is affordable is available to everyone. That which is available to everyone is not exclusive. That which is not exclusive is not luxurious.\n\nThe XG350L, in much the manner of its well-crafted cousin, the Kia Amanti sedan, runs contrary to that thinking. It embraces the notion that luxury is something more democratic. As such, it is to the car-buying public what the Louvre is to the tens of thousands of tourists who annually visit the portrait of the Mona Lisa — a much-valued thing of accessible beauty.\n\nCertainly, the XG350L’s body sculpture is attractive. It is a long, sleek silhouette with muscular front and rear ends. Its grille mimics the design of the frontispiece on the Lexus RX 330 sport-utility vehicle. It has the catlike stance of a Jaguar XJ8 sedan and the overall elegance of a baby Bentley.\n\nYet there is nothing about the XG350L’s exterior or interior treatments that feels imitative, or cheap. Even the polyurethane boiserie, the fake wood surrounding its center console and adorning its instrument and door panels, seems rich.\n\nI’m still scratching my head over how Hyundai managed to deliver all it does in this car at a base price under $26,000. The list of standard equipment is impressive.\n\nFunctionally, there is the 3.5-liter, 24-valve, 194-horsepower V-6 engine. It is exceptionally quiet, smooth — strongly reminiscent of the performance of the highly touted 3.5-liter V-6 sold by Nissan Motor Co. in the United States. A five-speed automatic transmission that also can be operated manually is standard. It feels good in the hand. There is no jerkiness in moving through the forward gears, and no fight to shift into reverse.\n\nThe XG350’s predecessor, introduced in 2001 as the XG300 (because it had a 3-liter V-6), was a discernible slouch in the handling department. It wallowed in corners and practically bottomed out over urban street bumps and potholes.\n\nHyundai made some suspension improvements to the car when it was reintroduced as the XG350 in 2002. Those fixes helped to r educe its wiggle-wobble behavior around curves. But in 2004, although much has improved, more work needs to done in that area. On several occasions during test drives, when I took the car deep and fast into corners, it communicated its displeasure by wildly wagging its tail, threatening to swing out of control in protest.\n\nIt remains best to drive this one fast on the straightaways when road conditions and the law permit. But drive it gently and with reasonable caution when those roads bend and become more challenging.\n\nStill, I don’t regard the XG350’s soft suspension as an insurmountable disappointment any more than I view the suspension systems in the Mercury Grand Marquis or Toyota Avalon with proscriptive disdain. Those cars are deliberate softies, built for long-distance cruising comfort as opposed to racetrack performance.\n\nLuxury, in this case, does not seek a first-place win at the finish line. It simply wants to coddle driver and passengers in t ansit; and that, indisputably, is something the XG350L does remarkably well at a remarkably affordable price.\n\nNuts & Bolts\n\nDownside: Controversy here. I think the XG350L’s suspension, much like the Kia Amanti’s, is too soft. Other drivers disagree. They accuse automotive journalists of not understanding the needs and wants of normal drivers who, those critics say, simply want a reliable, good-looking, well-crafted, upscale family sedan that can be bought without risk of bankruptcy.\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: Good ride. Squishy handling. Very good acceleration.\n\nHead-turning quotient: Immense visual appeal inside and out. Even recalcitrant Hyundai critics were forced to admit that Hyundai had scored a home run here.\n\nBody style/layout: The Hyundai XG350L is a front-engine, front-wheel-drive, four-door family sedan with seating for five people.\n\nEngine/transmission: The car’s 3.5-liter, 24-valve V-6 develops 194 horsepower at 5,500 revolutions per minute and 216 foot-pounds of torque at 3,500 rpm. It is linked to a five-speed automatic transmission that also can be operated manually.\n\nCargo and fuel capacities: Maximum cargo capacity is 14.5 cubic feet. The fuel tank holds 18.5 gallons of recommended regular unleaded gasoline.\n\nMileage: Not great. I averaged 23 miles per gallon in city-highway driving.\n\nChanges for 2004: Mild cosmetic upgrades to front and rear of car. Minor tweaking of suspension system and other drivetrain components. Nothing major.\n\nAmenities: They are notable here because there are so many offered on the XG350L as standard equipment, including leather seating surfaces, projector-lens fog lights, one-touch power windows, side-view mirrors that automatically tilt downward for a better view of the curb when backing up, a speed-proportional steering system, cruise control and a premium sound system.\n\nSafety: Four-wheel anti-lock brakes, traction control, dual front air bags, side and head bags.\n\nPricing: Base price is $25,599. Dealer’s invoice on base model is $22,896. Price as tested is $26,778, including $500 in options and a $590 destination charge. Dealer’s price with options and destination charge is $23,985.\n\nPurse-strings note: Compare with Kia Amanti, Toyota Avalon, Buick LeSabre, Honda Accord LX V6, Volkswagen Passat. Yes, Hyundai detractors, get over it. Hyundai is now a bona fide competitor in this league — quality, price and all.",
