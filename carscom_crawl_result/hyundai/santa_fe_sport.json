      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in February 2015 about the 2015 Hyundai Santa Fe Sport. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2016, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nToday’s family can fit its daily routine into a variety of cars, from a small crossover to the largest SUV or minivan on the market.\n\nThe 2015 Hyundai Santa Fe Sport offers a happy medium of more overall room than a compact SUV but with a price lower than larger, three-row vehicles.\n\nBoth the Santa Fe Sport and the Santa Fe are well regarded by Cars.com editors for their family-hauling proficiency. The Santa Fe Sport won our Small Family Car of the Year award for 2015, while the Santa Fe won the award for both the Large Family Car of the Year and the overarching honor of Family Car of the Year.\n\nWith few changes to this year’s model, there’s still a lot to like, whether or not children are a focal point in your life. See the 2015 and 2014 models compared here.\n\nExterior & Styling\n“Handsome” is a decent word to describe the Santa Fe Sport’s looks. A few years ago it might have been considered radical, but these days its large grille, flashy taillights and beefy stance are pretty commonplace among both cars and SUVs.\n\nCar shoppers might confuse the smaller Sport with the three-row Santa Fe, as few styling cues differentiate them.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe Santa Fe Sport’s base engine is a 2.4-liter four-cylinder producing 190 horsepower. That isn’t a huge advantage compared with the considerably smaller Honda CR-V’s 185 hp, but it’s a decent bump from the comparably sized Subaru Outback, which has 175 hp.\n\nNote that horsepower alone doesn’t reflect performance. Comparing base all-wheel-drive versions of these three models, the Hyundai is the heaviest — 23 pounds heavier than the Subaru and a more significant 137 pounds more than the Honda. None of these cars’ base engines offer anything close to the feeling of “sport,” and both the front-wheel-drive CR-V and all-wheel-drive Outback (where front-wheel drive isn’t available) return decent combined mileage of 29 and 28 mpg, respectively. The front-wheel-drive version of the Santa Fe Sport returns just 23 mpg combined.\n\nOpting for the 2.0T version of the Santa Fe Sport does put you in another realm of performance, however. Rated at 264 hp and 269 pounds-feet of torque, the turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder packs slightly more power than the six-cylinder version of the Outback, which has 256 hp, and just a touch more than the all-new, V-6-only Nissan Murano at 260 hp. (See the four competitors compared side by side.)\n\nWhile all three of these models drive with command in terms of having ample passing power, only the Santa Fe Sport feels fun to drive. The turbo twitches a bit under hard acceleration, though, a characteristic once common among turbo engines that’s endearingly called “lag.” These days, most turbos are refining that lag out. The Outback and Murano, both equipped with continuously variable automatic transmissions, are characteristically steadier under hard acceleration.\n\nThe Hyundai also has decent steering, with precise feedback and a nicely weighted steering wheel — an attribute we cannot say is shared with the rest of Hyundai’s lineup.\n\nBut the handling itself could use some improvement; there’s a considerable amount of body lean in tight turns at routine speeds. The new Murano is shockingly flat in these situations, and the Outback’s shorter greenhouse makes it feel less top-heavy as well.\n\nThere are three selectable steering settings in the Hyundai: Normal, Comfort and Sport, but there isn’t a dramatic difference among them.\n\nLike the non-turbo version, the 2.0T’s mileage is behind the pack, coming in at 22 mpg combined with front-wheel drive, compared with 24 mpg for the front-wheel-drive Murano. The Outback gets 22 mpg with a V-6 and its standard all-wheel drive.\n\nInterior\nThe starting price of the Hyundai Santa Fe Sport — and the Subaru Outback, for that matter — isn’t much higher than smaller crossovers like the Honda CR-V or Toyota RAV4, but you get a significantly larger vehicle.\n\nThis translates to a roomier cabin in front and back, making it a better choice for anyone who covets extra space and is willing to trade on attributes like fuel economy.\n\nThe interior is also of decent quality, from the base model on up to the top 2.0-liter turbo trim level I tested for this review. The nearly $15,000 price difference between those trims (when the 2.0T is fully loaded) is noticeable at the higher end of the spectrum, where buyers might not be as impressed when cross-shopping similarly equipped competitors; Nissan’s new Murano starts at $30,445 including destination and has a significantly more upscale cabin. Compared with the Santa Fe Sport I tested, the Murano is a near luxury vehicle.\n\nIt’s in its lower trims that the Santa Fe Sport earns its due as a quality family vehicle, with the same space and a fair amount of style.\n\nThe front seats are wide and comfortable over long drives, and the rear seats recline and have plenty of room for child-safety seats. In terms of interior dimensions, the Outback and Murano are very similar to the Santa Fe Sport.\n\nI’m also a big fan of the Sport’s rear air vents, which are located in the door pillars so the air blows nearly at the height of a passenger’s chest. Most cars have the vents at the back of the center console between the front seats, near the floor.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nMany Hyundais suffer from old-shoe syndrome. They don’t really astound a driver, but they feel comfortable and familiar from the first time you sit down. This is a testament to well-executed ergonomics, from the air-conditioning controls to the color display between the two analog gauges.\n\nThe optional navigation system — which can be had only along with an assortment of other options that bring the Santa Fe Sport’s cost to well more than $30,000 — is quite good, with crisp graphics on an 8-inch touch-screen. Commands are easy to see and implement on the screen, and there’s a considerable number of other functions buried in the system itself, including telematics, in-depth tracking of mileage and more.\n\nCargo & Storage\nMy own family car somehow accumulates stuff in every cargo nook and cranny. The Santa Fe Sport would be a good fit for similarly challenged families. There’s a large, open cubby directly in front of the shifter that can hold wallets and smartphones. This is also where the car’s USB port is located.\n\nA covered storage area directly behind the cupholders, under the armrest, is a decent size, and the large door pockets can handle a few items and drink bottles — but they’re too far down to reach easily.\n\nThe cargo area measures 35.4 cubic feet behind the backseat, nearly identical to the Outback and the smaller CR-V. The Murano, however, is a bit bigger, at 39.6 cubic feet. Any of those cargo areas should handle most hauling duties for the average family.\n\nThe rear seats fold flat by means of levers on the seats themselves or ones located near the rear cargo hatch, which I always find invaluable. Maximum cargo space with the seats folded flat is 71.5 cubic feet, a bit ahead of the CR-V and Murano but slightly behind the Outback.\n\nThe Santa Fe Sport’s cargo area has a massive under-floor storage system that can hold bulky items, not just perfectly folded blankets.\n\nIf you opt for either the 2.4-liter with the top Tech Package or the 2.0T with the Ultimate Package, the Santa Fe Sport comes not only with a power liftgate but also a “smart open” feature. This detects when the car’s key fob is approaching the rear of the vehicle and, if it remains there for 3 seconds, will automatically open the cargo hatch. Some systems like this exist on other vehicles but require the user to wave a leg under the rear bumper to trigger a sensor.\n\nSafety\nThe Santa Fe Sport has a top five-star crash-test rating from the federal government. Incorrectly identified by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety as the Santa Fe, the Santa Fe Sport earned the organization’s top score of good in all tests to which it was subjected. However, it has yet to undergo the small-overlap frontal crash test that has damned more than half of the nine models tested to date in the midsize SUV class.\n\nThe Santa Fe Sport doesn’t feature optional safety equipment like a blind spot monitoring system or forward collision warning system.\n\nSee all the Santa Fe Sport’s safety features listed here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThere’s a wide range of prices for the Santa Fe Sport that might draw in shoppers looking for anything from basic transportation with a lot of room to something sporty and fun with luxury features. For shoppers on the low end, it offers more room than the typical compact but is offset by low fuel economy.\n\nOn the high end, it offers everything the competition does except perhaps a near-luxury interior.\n\nThe fact that the Santa Fe Sport can compete on so many levels is impressive.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in August 2012 about the 2013 Hyundai Santa Fe Sport. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2014, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nEditor’s note: Estimated mileage ratings have been lowered to reflect a November 2012 EPA audit of this car’s stated mileage.\n\nTime had passed the Hyundai Santa Fe by. A once-great vehicle started settling for OK as the competition — and all of Hyundai’s other models — got better. The automaker has enlivened its lineup during the past two years with fresh designs and new powertrains; now it’s the Santa Fe’s turn.\n\nA major redesign pushes the 2013 Hyundai Santa Fe Sport to the front of the midsize SUV pack with a new turbocharged engine, dynamic styling and competitive pricing.\n\nThe third generation of Hyundai’s midsize SUV is available for 2013 as the five-seat Santa Fe Sport (compare the 2012 and 2013 models here). A long-wheelbase version with seating for up to seven, called simply the Santa Fe, will be out early in 2013, replacing the brand’s current seven-seater, the underperforming Veracruz. This review covers the Sport.\n\nThe Santa Fe is in the midsize class, which includes crossovers like the Toyota Highlander and Nissan Murano. But at 184.6 inches long, it’s on the smaller side of the segment and is better matched in both length and interior volume against entries like the Ford Edge and Kia Sorento. Compare all three here.\n\nNew Name, Fresh Look\nHyundai added “Sport” to the Santa Fe in both name and design for 2013. It adopts a more aggressive look, barely resembling the vehicle it replaces. A new aerodynamic shape with LED-accented, sweeping, angular headlamps, upswept bodyside lines and a rear spoiler give it a leaner, more fluid look. Hyundai says the crossover shed 266 pounds this year. Additional chrome trim and an updated hexagonal grille add some much-needed spunk.\n\nThe new Santa Fe is another example of Hyundai’s move toward family styling. It looks a lot like its smaller sibling, the Tucson. The risk here is a dull lineup full of clones, but the Santa Fe wears its new face well. More assertive design cues distinguish it, but its new grille and wedgy, angular shape tie it to the family.\n\nGoing & Stopping\nThe base engine for the 2013 Santa Fe, borrowed from the Sonata sedan, is a 190-horsepower 2.4-liter four-cylinder, an engine more powerful than the 2012’s base four-cylinder. It wasn’t made available for testing. I tested a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder trim level, called the 2.0T. Borrowed from the Sonata Turbo, this 264-hp power plant replaces the old Santa Fe’s upgrade engine, a V-6.\n\nAt an elevation of 8,000-plus feet, the thin, power-sapping air in Park City, Utah, is not usually an engine’s friend. But unlike myself — lethargic and thirsty — the 2.0-liter turbo had no problem digesting the oxygen-deficient high-altitude air.\n\nThe 2.0-liter and six-speed automatic transmission are a good match for the Santa Fe. It’s lively from a stop, and if there was any turbo lag, I missed it. The responsive six-speed promptly snapped off shifts; even during hill climbs, the Santa Fe never felt underpowered.\n\nThe front-wheel-drive turbo is EPA-rated at 20/27 mpg city/highway, and the front-wheel-drive base 2.4-liter at 21/29 mpg. With all-wheel drive, which is optional with either engine, the gas mileage drops to 19/24 mpg and 20/26 mpg for the turbo and base models, respectively.\n\nStandard on both engines is Active Eco mode. It alters acceleration and shift points to raise fuel efficiency by as much as 7 percent above the EPA rating, Hyundai says. It’s engaged via a button next to the steering wheel, and the change is noticeable but not annoying.\n\nFord’s Edge also has an optional turbocharged four-cylinder. Called the EcoBoost, the 2.0-liter makes 240 hp and gets 21/30 mpg, a smidge better than the Santa Fe’s best rating.\n\nHighway cruising is a strong point. The Santa Fe’s cabin is quiet and its ride smooth. Even during a quick jaunt on a dirt road, it demonstrated a high level of composure and bump absorption. It bounded over larger potholes but stayed buttoned-down over smaller imperfections. The standard Downhill Brake Control system got a workout during a few miles of hilly, unpaved terrain. Instead of requiring the driver to stand on the brakes during a steep decline, it automatically slows the car. The sound is jarring, but the effect is helpful.\n\nThe engine’s noise is well-muted at takeoff and nearly silent at highway speeds. Hyundai says it added several pounds of sound-deadening material to the cabin, and it shows. It’s impressively isolated; road noise is hushed. Though wind rush around the mirrors is noticeable, it’s never intrusive.\n\nIn terms of handling, body lean could be better checked around corners, but the motion is never obnoxious. Newly standard is a unique driver-selectable steering system with three modes: Normal, Sport and Comfort. Sport feels dull and heavy; Comfort feels light and twitchy. Normal struck a comfortable balance between the two. I suspect the typical midsize SUV driver won’t care for anything else.\n\nCabin Materials and Controls\nInside, cloth seats are standard; leather is part of a $2,450 option package. Several different color and texture combinations are available, and the two I sampled looked stylish. Though plenty of plastic is evident, it’s cushy in all the right places. The use of the cheap-looking hard stuff is minimal.\n\nWith the black leather palette, the interior is dressed with satin metallic-looking painted plastic trim and smoky-toned imitation wood. The two-tone gray interior wears fake carbon fiber and thatched plastic trim and surfaces. It sounds busy, but the overall look is interesting and tasteful. Large, chrome-ringed gauges lend a sporty look.\n\nThe standard cloth seats have fabric from Yes Essentials, and it is resistant to water, stains, odor and bacteria. I did a test spill of milk, and it quickly beaded up instead of absorbing into the fabric. Cleanup was easy so the risk of mysterious, lingering odors was minimized. The Yes upholstery isn’t new — Chrysler uses it in a few of its vehicles — but it’s new to Santa Fe, and parents will love it.\n\nAnother plus is the large touch-screen navigation system, optional on all models. The text on the 8-inch screen is large and easy to read, and its placement, high and flat on the dash, is ideal.\n\nFunctionality-wise, it could be more intuitive. For audio and navigation tasks, you use a combination of the touch-screen and panel buttons. Some functions must be done first by using the physical buttons and then completed via the touch-screen menu. For others, you can go straight to the screen. For example, the route button takes you directly to the touch-screen route menu.\n\nClimate functions are separate and controlled through a large dial and clear buttons. Also available is a 4.3-inch touch-screen audio display with a backup camera.\n\nPeople & Cargo\nThe Santa Fe Sport’s cabin is roomy and, in models equipped with the optional panoramic moonroof, airy. Up front, head- and legroom were plentiful for my 5-foot 5-inch self and my 6-foot-2-inch passenger. There was enough wiggle room for us in the backseat, too. A little longer than the Edge, the Santa Fe offers about an inch more legroom but slightly less front headroom. The two also compare in the rear headroom and legroom departments, and both offer more room than the Sorento.\n\nThe driver and front passenger sit on bolstered seats, snug and comfy. The bottom cushions could be longer, though; taller passengers may want more thigh support.\n\nA deep center console and large bin behind the shifter can hold a lot of small items. Cupholders are plentiful, too. There are two of them and two door-pocket bottle holders in front and two of each in back.\n\nBackseat passengers get the benefit of a sliding and reclining bench seat — a nice perk that the Edge and Sorento don’t match. The bench can slide 5.2 inches and folds in a 40/20/40 split, which affords more cargo and passenger flexibility than the traditional 60/40 split. The seats don’t fold flat, and there’s a gap between the seatback and the floor because of the sliding seat. The process is very easy, however; the seat folds with one hand after pulling two cargo-area handles or seat-mounted levers.\n\nBehind the backseat is a fairly high load floor, but there are also underfloor storage areas. There are two compartments, and the larger one is divided into handy bins for keeping small items from rolling around.\n\nThe cargo volume behind the backseat is 35.4 cubic feet, much more than the Edge’s 32.2, though the Sorento beats them both with 37.0 cubic feet. With the seats folded, Sorento wins again with 72.5 cubic feet, compared with the Edge’s 68.9 and Santa Fe’s 71.5 cubic feet.\n\nFeatures & Price\nIn base 2.4-liter trim, the 2013 Santa Fe starts at $25,275 (all prices include destination charges). The 2.0T starts at $28,525. All-wheel drive adds $1,750 to either trim. The turbocharged Edge starts at $29,345, and four-cylinder versions of the Sorento start at $23,950. The latter also comes with a V-6 starting at $26,500.\n\nTurbo to turbo, the Santa Fe looks like the better deal, but you must option it carefully. Many features only come bundled in pricey packages; there are few standalone options. For example, if you want the panoramic moonroof, it’s available only in the $2,900 Technology Package and also requires you to first upgrade to the $2,450 Leather and Premium Equipment Package. That’s an extra $5,350. Hyundai also doesn’t offer a power liftgate on the Santa Fe; it’s optional on the Edge.\n\nSafety\nAs a new model, the 2013 Hyundai Santa Fe Sport hasn’t been tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration as of this writing.\n\nIt comes standard with a full complement of airbags, including a driver’s knee airbag and side curtain airbags that cover both rows. One other notable standard safety item is Hyundai’s Blue Link telematics system, which is similar to GM’s OnStar. Click here for a full list of safety features.\n\nVisibility straight back is fine, but a high belt line and upswept windows partially obscure the view to the rear corners. A blind spot warning system isn’t available, and a backup camera is optional.\n\nHyundai Santa Fe Sport in the Market\nWith the redesigned Sport, Hyundai has taken the Santa Fe from ho-hum to head of the class. It will be tough for shoppers in this segment to overlook the Santa Fe’s newfound style and impressive powertrain. Prices are appealing, too, if you choose your packages wisely.\n\nHyundai is on a roll. As its products continue to improve, so do its sales, and it looks like the automaker has another hit in the making with the Santa Fe Sport.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "We got a first ride of the all-new-for-2019 Hyundai Santa Fe, the automaker’s mid-size two-row SUV, which (a little confusingly) replaces the Santa Fe Sport in the lineup. It’s a little bit bigger than the Santa Fe Sport overall, but Hyundai has packed it with a lot of standard active safety features.\n\nRelated: 2019 Hyundai Santa Fe First Drive: A Modern Mid-Size SUV\n\nDuring our time behind the wheel on scenic roads outside Park City, Utah, my initial impression was that the new Santa Fe is a very smooth vehicle, and that theme comes through in a lot of different ways. Automakers often make the mistake of being too intent on a sporty feel in their SUVs, but Hyundai has wisely found a nice balance here, with a greater focus on smoothness.\n\nWe drove a model with the optional turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, and it’s a smooth-revving setup. It gets up to speed quickly and easily, though highway passing power drops off a little bit. It works with an eight-speed automatic transmission and, again, it makes smooth shifts; it’s unobtrusive and willing to make hard-throttle kickdowns easily. This is a responsive transmission.\n\nThat feeling of smoothness comes through in the steering, too. It doesn’t offer a ton of feedback, but the car steers and rides well overall — not too firmly sprung.\n\nGet the rest of my impressions of the 2019 Hyundai Santa Fe — or at least enjoy some gorgeous mountain vistas vicariously through me — by watching the video above.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Today’s family can fit its daily routine into a variety of cars, from a small crossover to the largest SUV or minivan on the market.\n\nThe 2015 Hyundai Santa Fe Sport offers a happy medium of more overall room than a compact SUV but with a price lower than larger, three-row vehicles.\n\nBoth the Santa Fe Sport and the Santa Fe are well regarded by Cars.com editors for their family-hauling proficiency. The Santa Fe Sport won our Small Family Car of the Year award for 2015, while the Santa Fe won the award for both the Large Family Car of the Year and the overarching honor of Family Car of the Year.\n\nWith few changes to this year’s model, there’s still a lot to like, whether or not children are a focal point in your life. See the 2015 and 2014 models compared here.\n\nExterior & Styling\n“Handsome” is a decent word to describe the Santa Fe Sport’s looks. A few years ago it might have been considered radical, but these days its large grille, flashy taillights and beefy stance are pretty commonplace among both cars and SUVs.\n\nCar shoppers might confuse the smaller Sport with the three-row Santa Fe, as few styling cues differentiate them.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe Santa Fe Sport’s base engine is a 2.4-liter four-cylinder producing 190 horsepower. That isn’t a huge advantage compared with the considerably smaller Honda CR-V’s 185 hp, but it’s a decent bump from the comparably sized Subaru Outback, which has 175 hp.\n\nNote that horsepower alone doesn’t reflect performance. Comparing base all-wheel-drive versions of these three models, the Hyundai is the heaviest — 23 pounds heavier than the Subaru and a more significant 137 pounds more than the Honda. None of these cars’ base engines offer anything close to the feeling of “sport,” and both the front-wheel-drive CR-V and all-wheel-drive Outback (where front-wheel drive isn’t available) return decent combined mileage of 29 and 28 mpg, respectively. The front-wheel-drive version of the Santa Fe Sport returns just 23 mpg combined.\n\nOpting for the 2.0T version of the Santa Fe Sport does put you in another realm of performance, however. Rated at 264 hp and 269 pounds-feet of torque, the turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder packs slightly more power than the six-cylinder version of the Outback, which has 256 hp, and just a touch more than the all-new, V-6-only Nissan Murano at 260 hp. (See the four competitors compared side by side.)\n\nWhile all three of these models drive with command in terms of having ample passing power, only the Santa Fe Sport feels fun to drive. The turbo twitches a bit under hard acceleration, though, a characteristic once common among turbo engines that’s endearingly called “lag.” These days, most turbos are refining that lag out. The Outback and Murano, both equipped with continuously variable automatic transmissions, are characteristically steadier under hard acceleration.\n\nThe Hyundai also has decent steering, with precise feedback and a nicely weighted steering wheel — an attribute we cannot say is shared with the rest of Hyundai’s lineup.\n\nBut the handling itself could use some improvement; there’s a considerable amount of body lean in tight turns at routine speeds. The new Murano is shockingly flat in these situations, and the Outback’s shorter greenhouse makes it feel less top-heavy as well.\n\nThere are three selectable steering settings in the Hyundai: Normal, Comfort and Sport, but there isn’t a dramatic difference among them.\n\nLike the non-turbo version, the 2.0T’s mileage is behind the pack, coming in at 22 mpg combined with front-wheel drive, compared with 24 mpg for the front-wheel-drive Murano. The Outback gets 22 mpg with a V-6 and its standard all-wheel drive.\n\nInterior\nThe starting price of the Hyundai Santa Fe Sport — and the Subaru Outback, for that matter — isn’t much higher than smaller crossovers like the Honda CR-V or Toyota RAV4, but you get a significantly larger vehicle.\n\nThis translates to a roomier cabin in front and back, making it a better choice for anyone who covets extra space and is willing to trade on attributes like fuel economy.\n\nThe interior is also of decent quality, from the base model on up to the top 2.0-liter turbo trim level I tested for this review. The nearly $15,000 price difference between those trims (when the 2.0T is fully loaded) is noticeable at the higher end of the spectrum, where buyers might not be as impressed when cross-shopping similarly equipped competitors; Nissan’s new Murano starts at $30,445 including destination and has a significantly more upscale cabin. Compared with the Santa Fe Sport I tested, the Murano is a near luxury vehicle.\n\nIt’s in its lower trims that the Santa Fe Sport earns its due as a quality family vehicle, with the same space and a fair amount of style.\n\nThe front seats are wide and comfortable over long drives, and the rear seats recline and have plenty of room for child-safety seats. In terms of interior dimensions, the Outback and Murano are very similar to the Santa Fe Sport.\n\nI’m also a big fan of the Sport’s rear air vents, which are located in the door pillars so the air blows nearly at the height of a passenger’s chest. Most cars have the vents at the back of the center console between the front seats, near the floor.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nMany Hyundais suffer from old-shoe syndrome. They don’t really astound a driver, but they feel comfortable and familiar from the first time you sit down. This is a testament to well-executed ergonomics, from the air-conditioning controls to the color display between the two analog gauges.\n\nThe optional navigation system — which can be had only along with an assortment of other options that bring the Santa Fe Sport’s cost to well more than $30,000 — is quite good, with crisp graphics on an 8-inch touch-screen. Commands are easy to see and implement on the screen, and there’s a considerable number of other functions buried in the system itself, including telematics, in-depth tracking of mileage and more.\n\nCargo & Storage\nMy own family car somehow accumulates stuff in every cargo nook and cranny. The Santa Fe Sport would be a good fit for similarly challenged families. There’s a large, open cubby directly in front of the shifter that can hold wallets and smartphones. This is also where the car’s USB port is located.\n\nA covered storage area directly behind the cupholders, under the armrest, is a decent size, and the large door pockets can handle a few items and drink bottles — but they’re too far down to reach easily.\n\nThe cargo area measures 35.4 cubic feet behind the backseat, nearly identical to the Outback and the smaller CR-V. The Murano, however, is a bit bigger, at 39.6 cubic feet. Any of those cargo areas should handle most hauling duties for the average family.\n\nThe rear seats fold flat by means of levers on the seats themselves or ones located near the rear cargo hatch, which I always find invaluable. Maximum cargo space with the seats folded flat is 71.5 cubic feet, a bit ahead of the CR-V and Murano but slightly behind the Outback.\n\nThe Santa Fe Sport’s cargo area has a massive under-floor storage system that can hold bulky items, not just perfectly folded blankets.\n\nIf you opt for either the 2.4-liter with the top Tech Package or the 2.0T with the Ultimate Package, the Santa Fe Sport comes not only with a power liftgate but also a “smart open” feature. This detects when the car’s key fob is approaching the rear of the vehicle and, if it remains there for 3 seconds, will automatically open the cargo hatch. Some systems like this exist on other vehicles but require the user to wave a leg under the rear bumper to trigger a sensor.\n\nSafety\nThe Santa Fe Sport has a top five-star crash-test rating from the federal government. Incorrectly identified by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety as the Santa Fe, the Santa Fe Sport earned the organization’s top score of good in all tests to which it was subjected. However, it has yet to undergo the small-overlap frontal crash test that has damned more than half of the nine models tested to date in the midsize SUV class.\n\nThe Santa Fe Sport doesn’t feature optional safety equipment like a blind spot monitoring system or forward collision warning system.\n\nSee all the Santa Fe Sport’s safety features listed here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThere’s a wide range of prices for the Santa Fe Sport that might draw in shoppers looking for anything from basic transportation with a lot of room to something sporty and fun with luxury features. For shoppers on the low end, it offers more room than the typical compact but is offset by low fuel economy.\n\nOn the high end, it offers everything the competition does except perhaps a near-luxury interior.\n\nThe fact that the Santa Fe Sport can compete on so many levels is impressive.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The five-seat Hyundai Santa Fe Sport packs undeniable value, but even a raft of updates for 2017 can’t hide spotty cabin quality, practical limitations and other signs of age.\n\nVersus the competition: Largely the same SUV that debuted in early 2012, the Santa Fe Sport is a bargain versus most other midsize SUVs — which have improved a lot since then.\n\nHyundai says it updated a quarter of the Santa Fe Sport’s parts for 2017, including a number of structural reinforcements to improve its spotty crash-test scores. Freshened styling and an updated multimedia system round out the major changes; you can see all the differences for 2017 here.\n\nThe Santa Fe Sport is a smaller version of the three-row Hyundai Santa Fe. With just two rows, the Sport comes in base, 2.0T and 2.0T Ultimate trim levels with two available engines and front- or all-wheel drive. At Cars.com’s 2016 Midsize SUV Challenge, we compared an all-wheel-drive 2.0T Ultimate with four competitors. See more about that here.     \n\nWe cover the larger Santa Fe separately on Cars.com; compare it with the Sport here.\nExterior & Styling\nThe visual changes are most prominent up front: The headlights have a little more going on inside the frames, while the fog lights have a lot more going on around the frames. The sum of it all helps differentiate the Sport from the larger Santa Fe, which has its own unique visual updates for 2017.\nHow It Drives\nThe Hyundai Santa Fe Sport’s optional 240-horsepower, turbocharged 2.4-liter four-cylinder lends vigorous passing power if you really get on the gas, but it’s a buzzy engine that feels punchiest at higher revs, not off the line. A lag-free accelerator and responsive six-speed automatic help things along, but I’d like more low-rpm power. Despite the engine’s claimed low-end torque, the SUV lacks the immediate thrust of bigger-engine rivals. The three-row Santa Fe has an excellent 3.3-liter V-6 with much better power distribution; Hyundai would do well to pair it with the Sport — you know, to add more sport.\n\nBase models have a 185-hp, non-turbo four-cylinder that makes an EPA-estimated fuel economy of 24 mpg when combined with front-wheel drive. The turbo drops that to 23 mpg. All-wheel drive, available with either engine, loses 1 to 2 mpg depending on configuration. Those figures are competitive with the class and about 1 mpg better fuel economy than the 2016 model thanks to new engine calibrations and a number of other incremental changes.\n\nRide quality is a touch busy versus other midsize SUVs, but the handling payoff — reasonably flat cornering and decent steering feedback — seems worth it. Our test car had 19-inch alloy wheels, but Hyundai also offers 17- and 18-inchers, either of which might improve ride comfort. Our car’s Kumho Krugen P235/55R19 all-season tires emitted noticeable road noise at highway speeds, but the optional (and enormous) roof rack had little apparent effect on wind noise.\nInterior\nLargely carried over from the 2013-2016 generation of Hyundai Santa Fe Sport, the cabin is showing its age. The front seats are thin and unsupportive, and the optional leather feels more like vinyl. Cabin quality is all across the board: Some areas are rich while others — grainy grays above the glove compartment, frosted silver on the door handles — seem plucked from an entry-level subcompact. This used to cut it against the previous generation of midsize SUVs, but the class has improved. Hyundai needs to catch up.\n\nPracticality is a mixed bag, too. The rear seats offer myriad adjustments, but the low cushion height will leave taller adults’ knees uncomfortably elevated. The exterior styling sacrifices sight lines, with a rising beltline that diminishes visibility past the B-pillar.\nErgonomics & Electronics\nUpdated for 2017, the stereo controls are busier now but include both volume and tuning knobs (the latter were absent before). A 5-inch multimedia display (not a touchscreen) and backup camera are now standard. So is satellite radio, plus Bluetooth phone and audio streaming. Upgrade to an optional 7- or 8-inch touchscreen to get Android Auto, Apple CarPlay and HD radio. The 8-inch display adds a navigation system and Infinity premium audio.\n\nOur test car lacked CarPlay, a late addition for the 2017 model year, but Hyundai told us the Santa Fe Sport should offer it now. Shoppers who bought earlier 2017 models with the 7- or 8-inch screen can see their dealer for a free upgrade. You may want to get a few USB car chargers on your way; the Santa Fe Sport has just one USB port.\nCargo & Storage\nThe center console bin and glove compartment are unremarkable in size, but kudos to Hyundai for putting two storage trays in the center console, including a big one ahead of the gearshift. A surprising number of cars — even SUVs — are stingy with open storage.\n\nCargo space behind the backseat amounts to 35.4 cubic feet, which is smallish for a midsize SUV. (The Nissan Murano and Ford Edge beat the figure by more than 10 percent.) Fold the seats, and the Santa Fe Sport’s 71.5 cubic feet of maximum room is more competitive with others’ maximum volumes. Hyundai’s standard 40/20/40-split folding rear seat offers a practical advantage to the 60/40-split seats in many rivals, too: You can fit long, narrow cargo, like skis, between two outboard passengers.\nSafety\nFor 2017, Hyundai beefed up the Santa Fe’s cabin structure to improve its performance in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s small overlap front crash test, improving to good (from marginal) in the evaluation. (IIHS scores are poor, marginal, acceptable and good.) With good scores in the agency’s other crash tests, plus a top rating for its optional forward collision warning system with automatic emergency braking, the Santa Fe Sport earned IIHS’ highest designation, Top Safety Pick Plus. See the Santa Fe Sport’s IIHS ratings here and ratings for the rest of the midsize SUV class here.\n\nThat said, you’ll have to load up a Hyundai Santa Fe Sport to get that collision warning system. It’s available only on the 2.0T Ultimate, and even then it’s part of a $1,550 option package that includes adaptive headlights with automatic high beams, full speed adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning and a few other features.\n\nMost trim levels have a blind spot warning system. See a full list of standard safety features here and our evaluation of car-seat provisions here. A backup camera is standard, with a 360-degree camera system optional.\nValue in Its Class\nFront-drive base models start around $26,000 with destination, while an all-wheel-drive 2.0T Ultimate tops out around $40,500 with factory options — an impressive array that includes power front seats with heating and ventilation, heated rear seats, a heated steering wheel, a panoramic moonroof and sunshades for the rear windows.\n\nThat’s serious value. The Edge, Murano and Jeep Grand Cherokee all start around $30,000. The Murano tops out past $45,000; the Edge and V-6 Grand Cherokee can spiral into the $50,000s and $60,000s, respectively. Indeed, the Santa Fe Sport’s transaction prices are among the lowest of any midsize SUV, with an excellent warranty and track record of above-average reliability to boot.\n\nStill, the savings come with problems. From cabin materials and visibility to a turbo engine that’s short on low-end grunt, the Hyundai Santa Fe Sport has its share of annoyances. Hyundai’s 2017 refresh fixed the old model’s one deal-breaker — crash tests — but against today’s competition, the Santa Fe Sport still feels old. Until a full redesign, it may not appeal on much more than value.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",
