      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in October 2010 about the 2011 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2012, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nEstimated mileage ratings have been lowered to reflect a November 2012 EPA audit of this car’s stated mileage.\n\nIn the world of hybrids, there are two schools of thought: You can buy a Toyota Prius — a hard-core, 50-mpg hybrid with funky styling and a utilitarian interior — or you can pay more and get less-spectacular mileage in a more comfortable sedan, like a Ford Fusion or Toyota Camry hybrid. Hyundai joins that second group with its first hybrid, which is based on the Sonata sedan.\n\nThe Sonata Hybrid is a comfortable cruiser with little to no tradeoff in terms of comfort or performance compared with the gasoline-only, four-cylinder Sonata.\n\nWhat exactly does the Sonata Hybrid have that will distance it from the Camry and Fusion hybrids? It has a more advanced battery pack, better mileage on the highway, a traditional six-speed automatic transmission … and it looks cool, too.\n\nIt does have some drawbacks, but none that come close to eclipsing its wow factor.\n\nHybrid-ness\nBefore I get into the performance and technology aspects of what makes the Sonata Hybrid tick, I’ve got to point out the fact that the Sonata Hybrid looks dramatically different from its gasoline-only sibling. It all starts with a radically enlarged grille and unique LED headlights up front. There are even flaps behind that grille that open and close, depending on your speed, to maximize aerodynamics.\n\nLightweight, aerodynamic wheels and low-rolling-resistance tires also help reduce drag. The Sonata has a lower coefficient of drag than its competition, at 0.25 Cd versus the Camry Hybrid’s 0.27 Cd and the Fusion Hybrid’s 0.33 Cd.\n\nPeople stuck in traffic around a Sonata Hybrid will likely gawk most at its taillights, which mix LED elements with a funky starburst pattern. I’ve never seen anything like it on a production car.\n\nAll these touches mark the Sonata Hybrid as a green machine — despite its ubiquitous blue badging.\n\nInside, all Sonata Hybrids get a digital readout between twin analog gauges that shows hybrid performance and trip computer information. Move up to a navigation-equipped model, and you get more detailed readouts on a much larger, dash-mounted screen.\n\nAll in all, the strategy works well. It’s flashy enough to shout “hybrid,” but it also exudes a sense of cool, not of smugness.\n\nAnd how does it do at the pump? Mileage is rated at 34/39 mpg city/highway, which outdoes the 2011 Camry Hybrid’s 31/35 mpg rating and bests the Fusion Hybrid in highway mileage; the Ford is rated 41/36 mpg.\n\nPerformance\nThe Sonata Hybrid has a 166-horsepower, 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine and a 30-kilowatt electric motor that produce a combined 206 hp. This is a common setup for a hybrid, though the Sonata Hybrid’s gas engine is a bit more powerful than many others.\n\nTwo aspects make Hyundai’s system unique.\n\nFor one, it uses a lithium-polymer battery instead of the nickel-metal-hydride one found in other hybrids. Lithium-ion batteries are more efficient and take up less space; they’re the type of batteries that power your cell phone and laptop computer.\n\nHyundai, though, uses an even more unusual lithium battery, called a lithium polymer. Basically, this type allows companies to tailor the size of their battery packs. The individual cells that make up the larger battery are license-plate shaped, but a little smaller and with a slight bulge in the middle. They’re incredibly light, and while the Sonata Hybrid’s battery pack did seem small, cargo space was drastically reduced versus a regular Sonata. The Sonata Hybrid has 10.7 cubic feet of trunk space, while the base four-cylinder model has 16.4 cubic feet. The standard Fusion has a similarly sized 16.5-cubic-foot trunk, but its nickel-metal-hydride battery reduces the space to only 11.8 cubic feet in the hybrid.\n\nThe Sonata Hybrid’s six-speed automatic transmission is also a hybrid first. Hybrids typically use continuously variable automatic transmissions to maximize fuel efficiency. Hyundai preferred the six-speed, hoping it would provide a better driving experience, one that non-hybrid shoppers would be accustomed to.\n\nThis is probably why I enjoyed driving the Sonata Hybrid a bit more than either the Camry or Fusion hybrids, at least when it wasn’t in its eco-friendly Blue mode.\n\nWhen the Sonata Hybrid isn’t in that fuel-sipping mode, shifts are crisp and acceleration is strong. It seemed to hustle faster than the base Sonata four-cylinder, though it was a bit sluggish compared with the turbo Sonata, which makes 76 more hp than the base.\n\nMy test drive took me through Southern California mountains, and the hybrid drivetrain performed well. The hybrid’s handling and ride quality are both on the soft side, like the base Sonata.\n\nOnce you engage Blue mode, though, everything changes. The transmission didn’t seem to know what to do on steep inclines, and the engine whined unsettlingly on hilly roads. Then again, hilly terrain isn’t where you’d engage this mode; it would be of most use in city traffic and in either congested or wide-open highway stretches. The company says it increases efficiency 5 percent.\n\nI was supposed to take a shorter route on my test drive, to make sure I caught my plane home, but the guidebook only had the longer route — a fact my co-driver and I discovered at the halfway point, when we swapped seats.\n\nAs he took the wheel to pilot us the rest of the way, I was worried we’d be late. Luckily, he was a heavy-footed chauffeur and didn’t bother with the Blue mode. We hustled through the next 40 miles at a decent clip — up and down mountains, stuck in city traffic and on highways at higher speeds. That type of driving didn’t throw our mileage numbers off as much as you would think. During my more moderate — but mostly uphill — 30 miles, we averaged 27.5 mpg. After his enthusiastic driving, the computer said our average was 31.8 mpg.\n\nBefore hybrid buyers scoff at these seemingly low figures, I’ll say that these numbers should be considered the bottom of the Sonata Hybrid’s mileage spectrum. Hyundai challenged journalists to eke out the best mileage they could on the route, and that meant some people rolled up the windows, turned off the air conditioning and drove as conservatively as possible. The winner of the challenge hit 60 mpg at an average speed of just 17 mph. I would not have made my plane at that rate.\n\nFeatures\nThere are no separate trim levels for the Sonata Hybrid, which comes with a slew of standard features and just one option package.\n\nStandard are cloth seats, 16-inch alloy wheels, low-rolling-resistance tires, cruise control, a hybrid trip computer, keyless entry with push-button start, a power driver’s seat, a USB port for iPod connectivity and a six-speaker stereo.\n\nThe Premium Package adds 17-inch alloy wheels, heated front and rear seats, leather upholstery, a panoramic sunroof, a navigation system, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shifter, a nine-speaker Infinity stereo, a backup camera and an auto-dimming rearview mirror with a garage-door opener.\n\nPrices have not been announced as of this writing.\n\nSafety\nThe Hyundai Sonata is one of only two cars on the market that have received both a Top Safety Pick designation from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and a five-star overall safety rating from the federal government under its new crash-test procedures. Read more about the government’s new tests here.\n\nSonata Hybrid in the Market\nHyundai’s first hybrid is impressive in almost every way. I certainly wish it drove better in its thriftiest mode, which owners of competing hybrids generally use. However, in nearly every other area the hybrid version of the Sonata is just as impressive as the regular sedan is in its segment.\n\nNo matter its pluses and minuses, though, the Sonata Hybrid’s stand-out looks may just draw buyers who’ve been hesitant to get a hybrid sedan before because the options available just didn’t have bold enough styling.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "It wasn’t all that long ago that a new Hyundai model would arrive with the modest hopes of simply “getting on the radar” of potential purchasers.\n\nHow times have changed.\n\nThese days, the latest Hyundai models have moved to the top-level of their sedan and SUV segments. Now, along comes Hyundai’s 2011 Sonata Hybrid, a vehicle that arrived with such glowing recommendations from colleagues that my expectations were raised to unrealistic levels.\n\nIn the hybrid world, the Toyota Prius has established the bar — at least in the American driving public’s consciousness — based on its long-established levels of drivability, fuel economy, and reliability. No other manufacturer has been able to alter that perception, even though there’s an ever-growing list of competent hybrids on the market. It’s similar to the way Chrysler’s minivans ruled that segment during the 1980s.\n\nIf you’ve been hiding under a barrel for the past 15 years, Hyundai has made one of the world’s most remarkable brand-name turnarounds, going from the bottom of that barrel to becoming a major player with all of its new models.\n\nThis hybrid takes the critically acclaimed Sonata’s good looks and improves upon them strikingly with restyled and deeper front and rear fascias, extended rocker panels, lower-drag styling around the wheel openings, and blue-toned accents. Frankly, it’s an eye-catching vehicle.\n\nHyundai offers the model in one trim level with a base price of $26,515 (including destination). The one significant option available is a $5,000 premium package that adds navigation, rearview camera, panoramic moonroof, heated (front and rear) leather seats, 17-inch alloy wheels, and an upgraded Infinity audio system. Our test ride was the base model with only carpeted floor mats and an iPod cable in the extras column for a bottom-line MSRP of $26,650.\n\nHyundai’s EPA fuel economy ratings for the Sonata Hybrid are 35 mpg city and 40 mpg highway. We were stumbling along at 31.8 mpg after a couple of days of around-town driving, but a July 4 weekend trip bumped it to 38.7 mpg.\n\nThe Hyundai hybrid system has its electric motor sandwiched between the 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine that produces 166 horsepower and 154 lb.-ft of torque, coupled with a six-speed automatic transmission instead of the CVT (continuously variable transmission) found in most hybrids. Adding the electric motor results in a vehicle rated at 206 horsepower and 193 lb.-ft. of torque.\n\nHyundai came close to hitting a home run with the combination, but the ball only has made it to the warning track so far, leaving the expectation that further refinements will perfect this system. Initially, if you’re accelerating slowly, this hybrid will stay in electric mode. However, once you enter real-world traffic conditions, you’re pushing harder on the accelerator and the computer algorithms are still thinking economy. As a result, the transmission on occasion shifts a bit hesitantly in the lower gears.\n\nOn the other hand, if you say, “forget economy,” and push the pedal down, the Sonata moves out smartly. But the driving experience doesn’t feel quite the same as in a non-hybrid. Maybe it’s a case of driver guilt for leaving the gas-saving mindset.\n\nIt’s a similar situation on the highway. The Sonata wants to stay in economy mode to maximize fuel economy. Hyundai has programmed the car to allow it to be in EV mode up to 62 mph. However, use your “lead foot” and you’ll discover it rockets away (relatively speaking). Hyundai has set up its hybrid drivetrain to allow a variety of engines to be combined with its six current automatic transmissions, positioning itself nicely for additional models if the hybrid movement continues to gain momentum.\n\nThe interior is totally up to contemporary standards with electroluminescent gauges and quality materials. Pairing my iPhone was a breeze, and the voice recognition system completed three consecutive calls. The system then switched over to playing the music on the phone at the touch of a button. The driver’s seat has power controls and a lumbar support. After some adjusting, it was fine for longer trips.\n\nHyundai has done an exemplary job of squeezing its lithium polymer battery pack into the Sonata, leaving adequate rear-seat space and enough trunk room. The trunk space took the bulk of the hit, though we still were able to fit a three-day weekend’s worth of gear back there. The rear seats do not fold down.\n\nThe Sonata Hybrid is borderline excellent as it stands today. Attention competition: It’s only going to get better.\n\n2011 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid\n\nTHE BASICS\nPrice, base/as tested (with destination): $26,515 / $26,650.\nFuel economy, EPA estimated: 35 city / 40 highway.\nFuel economy, Globe observed: 38.7 mpg.\nDrivetrain: 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine, 40.2 horsepower electric motor, six-speed automatic transmission and front-wheel-drive.\nBody: Four-door, five-passenger sedan.\n\nTHE SPECIFICS\nHorsepower: 206.2 (combined gas and electric motors)\nTorque: 193.4 lb.-ft.

      "expert_review": "Coming off a face-lift for the 2024 model year, the Hyundai Sonata sees the entry-level SE trim reintroduced for 2025, bringing the mid-size sedan’s base price down to $27,800 (all prices include $1,150 destination). The SE still includes a generous list of safety and tech features, only forfeiting a few features, like heated seats, in pursuit of its low price of entry. The price of last year’s base trim, the SEL, only increases $250 for 2025.\n\nRelated: 2024 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid Review: A Refreshing, Comfortable Cruiser\n\nAdditionally for the new model year, the SEL Convenience is now its own trim level, and the N Line now comes with a console-mounted air vent for backseat passengers.\n\nPowertrain Specs and MPG\n\nThe 2025 Sonata is available with three different powertrains to suit buyers’ needs. The base Sonata is powered by a 191-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine with 181 pounds-feet of torque; it’s paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission. Front-wheel drive is standard, but the SEL trim level is available with all-wheel drive for an additional $1,500. The Sonata SE returns an EPA-rated 28/38/32 mpg city/highway/combined, the FWD SEL and SEL Convenience are rated at 25/36/29 mpg, and the AWD SEL clocks in at 25/34/28 mpg.\n\nBuyers looking for an economical sports sedan will want to check out the Sonata N Line, which bolts a turbocharger to the 2.5-liter four and boosts output to 290 hp and 311 pounds-feet of torque. Only available with FWD, the N Line gets an eight-speed dual-clutch automatic for quicker shifts and a sportier feel and returns 23/32/27 mpg.\n\nAt the other end of the Sonata spectrum is the hybrid. It’s powered by a 2.0-liter four-cylinder paired with an electric motor and a battery pack for a combined output of 192 hp. A six-speed automatic sends power to the front wheels. The hybrid gets an EPA-rated 44/51/47 mpg.\n\nAvailability and Pricing\n\nThe 2025 Sonata will go on sale soon. Full line pricing is as follows.\n\nSonata\nSE: $27,800\nSEL: $28,900\nSEL AWD: $30,400\nSEL Convenience: $31,950\nN Line: $36,400\nSonata Hybrid\nSEL Hybrid: $32,150\nLimited Hybrid: $38,600\nSafety Features and Trim Levels\n\nHyundai didn’t delete any standard safety tech to create the SE trim. The entry-level Sonata still includes a comprehensive suite, including forward collision warning with pedestrian and bicyclist detection, intersection assist that watches for oncoming traffic during turns, automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, blind spot monitors, rear cross-traffic alert with automatic braking, lane departure steering assist, lane-centering steering, driver attention warning, automatic high beams, safe exit assist and a rear-seat reminder.\n\nIn addition, the Sonata SE includes 16-inch aluminum wheels, LED front and rear lighting, and keyless entry and starting. It’s upholstered in cloth and has manually adjustable front seats, manual air conditioning and a 12.3-inch touchscreen with wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay as well as satellite radio.\n\nAlso coming in under $30,000, the Sonata SEL gets 17-inch wheels, heated side mirrors, a power driver’s seat, heated front seats and dual-zone automatic climate control.\n\nStepping up to the SEL Convenience nets buyers 18-inch wheels, a panoramic moonroof, Digital Key 2.0 — which allows the owner to use a paired smartphone as the vehicle key — a 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster, navigation and wireless device charging.\n\nIn addition to its gas-electric powertrain, the SEL Hybrid is a hybrid of the SEL and SEL Convenience, adding the Convenience’s Digital Key 2.0 and wireless device charging, plus a power-adjustable passenger seat, but leaving the rest of its upgrades for the Limited Hybrid.\n\nIt’s a big step up to the Limited Hybrid, but that $6,450 covers the moonroof, navigation and digital instrument panel, as well as a 360-degree parking camera, blind spot cameras, automated parking, a head-up display and rain-sensing windshield wipers. Inside, the Limited features leather upholstery, ventilated front seats, a heated steering wheel, ambient lighting, rear-window shades and a 12-speaker Bose audio system.\n\nThe N Line is a wholly different beast, riding on 19-inch wheels and featuring unique front and rear exterior styling, a quad-outlet exhaust, a rear spoiler and revised steering. It includes all the luxury and tech features of the SEL Convenience, plus synthetic-leather sport seats, aluminum pedals, ambient lighting and the 12-speaker Bose sound system.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2024 Hyundai Ioniq 5, Santa Fe, Sonata Earn IIHS Top Safety Pick Awards\n2024 Hyundai Sonata Vs. 2025 Kia K5 Vs. 2025 Toyota Camry: Auto Show Faceoff\n2024 J.D.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Hyundai Sonata?\n\nThe 2019 Hyundai Sonata is a mid-size sedan that seats up to five. It comes in gas, gas-electric hybrid and plug-in hybrid versions. The gas version offers three engines: a 185-horsepower, 2.4-liter four-cylinder; a 178-hp, turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder; and a 245-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder.\n\nBoth the hybrid and plug-in hybrid models have a 154-hp, 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, but while the hybrid has a 1.76-kilowatt-hour battery, the plug-in hybrid has a larger 9.8-kwh battery pack. The plug-in hybrid can travel up to 28 miles on electric power alone, the EPA says.\n\nSonata competitors include the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord. A redesigned Sonata is slated to debut as a 2020 model.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2019 Hyundai Sonata?\n\nThe Sonata Hybrid Limited adds automatic emergency braking, lane keep assist, adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability, and an electronic parking brake.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Hyundai Sonata Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include air conditioning, cloth upholstery, a 60/40-split, folding backseat, a 7-inch touchscreen multimedia system, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity, Bluetooth, and blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert.\n\nUpscale options include hands-free trunk operation, LED headlights and taillights, a panoramic sunroof, heated and ventilated front seats, leather upholstery, a heated steering wheel, wireless device charging, navigation with a larger 8-inch touchscreen, and an Infinity premium stereo.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Hyundai Sonata?\n\nThe Sonata is quiet, comfortable and has user-friendly technology, but its base four-cylinder is just adequate, and the sedan’s interior quality could be better. The availability of efficient hybrid and plug-in hybrid versions is a plus, but there are some good mid-size sedans available — it’s worth your while to check out the competition and find the one that best fits your needs.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The updated 2024 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid pairs an intuitive multimedia system with good fuel economy and great ride comfort in a car that’s easy and enjoyable to drive for long distances.\n\nVersus the competition: The Sonata Hybrid isn’t trying to be a sports sedan, which pays dividends in its ride comfort and drivability.\n\nThe 2024 Hyundai Sonata mid-size sedan is updated for 2024 with new styling on the outside, new technology on the inside and the welcome addition of wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto on all trim levels. The updated Sonata’s lineup has been simplified, with some trim levels dropped, but multiple gasoline-only engine options remain, as well as an efficient gasoline-electric hybrid powertrain with an EPA fuel-economy rating of 47 mpg combined.\n\nRelated: Refreshed 2024 Hyundai Sonata (Finally) Priced From $28,615\n\nFor this review, I drove a 2024 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid Limited, the top trim level, that stickered at $38,560 (including destination). SEL Hybrid and gasoline-only SEL and turbocharged N Line versions are also available. During my test, I tracked my fuel economy over 200 miles of driving the Sonata as I would in everyday life, including carting around two kids in child-safety seats and grocery store runs. We also measured cargo space and tested child-safety seat fitment.\n\nSonata Hybrid MPG and Performance\n\nThe 2024 Sonata Hybrid’s 47 mpg combined EPA rating is unchanged from the 2023 figure, though its city rating dropped 1 mpg, to 44 mpg. (The previous Sonata Hybrid Blue trim level, which was rated 52 mpg combined, is no longer available.)\n\nI didn’t find it hard to coax efficiency from the Sonata Hybrid while driving normally, though I was initially disappointed by the low reported fuel economy displayed on the onboard trip computer. The Sonata’s trip computer read an average of 41.8 mpg, but in 201.6 miles of driving the Sonata Hybrid it used 4.37 gallons of gas, which calculates to 46.1 mpg. It cost $18.46 to drive those 201.6 miles, which isn’t bad at all considering the lower number the trip computer was spitting out.\n\nWhat was really interesting, however, was seeing the 600 miles of estimated driving range on the Sonata Hybrid’s instrument cluster when the tank was full. Maybe it’s because I’ve been driving a lot of electric vehicles, where 300 miles of range is impressive, but the thought of going 600 miles between refueling stops seems really convenient.\n\n2024 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nBetween fill-ups, driving this Hyundai is a showcase of refinement; you’ll hardly be able to tell it’s a hybrid. The powertrain transitions from electric operation to gasoline power with barely a shudder, and the electric power fills in the gaps of the gasoline engine and the somewhat lackluster operation of the six-speed automatic transmission. Acceleration, however, isn’t as seamless as in the new hybrid-only 2025 Toyota Camry, which is most evident when you call upon the Hyundai’s engine to pass. The Sonata’s responsiveness is hampered by its six-speed automatic, which is often hesitant or slow to downshift. It’s very different from the 2025 Toyota Camry, a hybrid that seamlessly switches from driving with vigor and responsiveness to becoming an eco-friendly commuter via its different driving modes; the Camry Hybrid also uses an electronic continuously variable automatic transmission.\n\nVersus its hybrid competitors’ combined fuel-economy ratings, the Sonata matches the roughly equivalent Camry XLE’s 47 mpg and does slightly better than the 2024 Honda Accord Touring’s 44 mpg. Determining which hybrid is right for you will involve looking into deeper differences, like ride comfort, pricing and interior technology.\n\nInterior Comfort and Cargo Room\n\nThe 2024 Sonata’s interior is dimensionally unchanged from 2023, which is to say surprisingly roomy considering its sleek, fastback-like shape. The Sonata’s driving experience is decidedly car-like, and it was refreshing to sit low to the ground in a sleek sedan versus riding up high in an SUV (though that opinion might be in the minority these days). I was happy with the Sonata’s front seating position, though I had to move the seat pretty far down to get comfortable, and the headliner still brushed the top of my hair when I got in.\n\nIn the backseat, I had a comfortable amount of space between my head and the top of the interior, though anyone taller than my 6-foot frame would probably feel the pinch of the sloping rear roofline. What the sleek shape doesn’t do, surprisingly, is hurt visibility; there’s a lot of glass behind you that helps over-the-shoulder visibility, and the Limited trim has a number of electronic aids that help some more, including a blind spot camera system as well as a traditional blind spot warning system and rear cross-traffic alert, which watches for cars approaching from either side while backing out of a parking space.\n\nI was surprised how easy it was to install car seats in the Sonata considering its sleek shape and sedan configuration. My kids’ forward-facing convertible seat and high-back booster had no issues with fitment or ease of installation.\n\nIn Cars.com’s cargo testing, we measured 19.8 cubic feet of trunk space, which is similar to what competitors offer; the 2023 Honda Accord Hybrid has 20.8 cubic feet of measured trunk space, while the 2023 Toyota Camry Hybrid has 20 cubic feet.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nTechnology\n\nRefreshed exterior styling aside, the most notable changes in the 2024 Sonata are the new displays on the inside, including a standard curved display that consists of two screens: a digital gauge cluster in front of the driver and a 12.3-inch center dashboard touchscreen. In standard configuration, the digital gauge cluster has limited configurability and a 4.2-inch instrument panel with selectable readouts, while the optional 12.3-inch instrument panel is configurable and is a larger display than the standard display. With the optional 12.3-inch instrument panel, these displays are high-quality, vibrant and feature an easy-to-use interface — and I give the Sonata bonus points for having volume and tuning knobs; the Camry and Accord lack a tuning knob.\n\nMost notably, the 2024 Sonata corrects a longstanding issue for Hyundai: Wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto have not been available with its cars’ larger-screen multimedia systems for some time. Wireless smartphone integration is now standard across the lineup, while wireless phone charging is optional on the base gas-only SEL trim but standard on all other gasoline and hybrid trim levels.\n\nThe most controversial change on the 2024 Sonata is the inclusion of touch-sensitive controls for the climate system, the heated and ventilated front seats, and the heated steering wheel. We’re generally not fans of this style of controls because they lack tactile feedback and are thus hard to use while driving, as well as inconsistent in operation; thankfully, there are still physical dials for temperature control. It’s not likely to be a deal breaker for most buyers, but they are annoying to use while driving. Be sure to get a feel for them (or really their lack of feel) while on a test drive; if it is a deal breaker for you, know that competitors like the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry retain physical controls for these functions.\n\nLess controversial but still different is the Sonata’s new twist-stalk gear selector that’s mounted on the steering column. Its operation is different from many other gear selectors, but I’ve found it to have almost zero learning curve, and I appreciate the space it frees up for center console storage. It’s a definite improvement over the car’s previous push-button gear selector.\n\nSafety\n\nThe 2024 Hyundai Sonata earns Top Safety Pick status from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. It missed out on the highest Top Safety Pick+ designation by earning a score of poor (on a scale of good, acceptable, marginal and poor) in the agency’s updated moderate overlap frontal crash test, in which a rear occupant dummy experienced forces that indicates a likelihood of injuries to the head, neck and chest. The 2024 Toyota Camry (not the redesigned version) is also an IIHS Top Safety Pick, while the 2024 Honda Accord earned the highest Top Safety Pick+ designation.\n\nStandard safety features include:\n\nForward collision warning with automatic emergency braking\nRear cross-traffic alert\nBlind spot warning\nLane departure steering assist\nLane-centering steering\nRear occupant alert\nVersus Toyota Camry and Honda Accord Hybrids\n\nWe won’t name a winner until we do a proper head-to-head-to-head comparison, but I did observe some notable differences between the Sonata Hybrid and the Camry and Accord hybrids. For one, the Sonata is decidedly tuned for comfort, with a soft suspension and relatively tiny 17-inch wheels, which I found refreshing compared with something like the Honda Accord, which is tuned for more athletic driving and has the ride stiffness to complete its mission. The Camry straddles the line between the two. Hyundai says it’s made improvements to reduce noise, vibration and harshness with body reinforcements.\n\nI favored the Sonata’s large 12.3-inch touchscreen over the Camry’s and Accord’s systems. I preferred Hyundai’s clarity and intuitive user interface, though I never came around to its touch-sensitive climate controls. Another mark against the Sonata Hybrid is its six-speed automatic transmission, which puts a damper on the acceleration experience when you need to pass; the Accord’s and Camry’s powertrains are much more eager to call upon power. Lastly, if you want a hybrid with all-wheel drive, there’s only one option: the Camry. The gas-only Sonata is available with all-wheel drive but the hybrid isn’t, while the Accord is front-wheel-drive only.\n\nIn June, the 2024 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid’s median listing price on Cars.com was $33,009, with 2,519 examples flowing through our site. That’s less than the Honda Accord Hybrid’s $35,120 median price, as well as far fewer listings than the 11,550 Accord Hybrids we saw, suggesting the Sonata Hybrid may be harder to find depending on where you live. The Sonata’s pricing is more in line with pricing we’ve seen for the 2025 Camry, which had a median price of $33,393 and inventory of 12,729.\n\nWhat all of this means is that what’s right for you may not come down to size, fuel economy or price, but rather to smaller details, like how the vehicles drive and how you interact with their controls. Either way, the updated 2024 Sonata deserves a spot in the conversation alongside the ubiquitous Camry and Accord, because this Hyundai combines good fuel economy with great ride comfort and easy-to-use technology.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2024 Hyundai Sonata Vs. 2025 Kia K5 Vs. 2025 Toyota Camry: Auto Show Faceoff\n2024 Hyundai Sonata Up Close: The Family Sedan, Sportified\nRefreshed 2024 Hyundai Sonata (Finally) Priced From $28,615\nRedesigned 2024 Hyundai Sonata Embraces Curves Inside and Out\nHyundai Outlines 2024 Sonata Powertrains, Sheds Light on New Tech\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in August 2015 about the 2016 Sonata Hybrid. For 2017, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity and a 7-inch touchscreen are now standard. Little else of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the 2016 and 2017 model years.\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nFor the green-car fans who like to say it loud and proud, the Sonata Hybrid might be too understated. Aside from an extra badge, it’s not easy to distinguish it from the non-hybrid version. The same thing is true for other hybrid sedans, as opposed to dedicated hybrid models, which are typically hatchbacks. The Sonata Hybrid lacks clues like a wedgy profile (Toyota Prius) or a graphics package (Chevrolet Volt). Instead, it mirrors the sleek style of its non-hybrid counterpart with a couple of minor deviations.\n\nThe Sonata Hybrid wears the regular version’s upright, squared-off face, but builds on that with an oversized version of the hexagonal grille and an emphasis on aerodynamics; there are sleeker front and rear bumpers and more-sculpted front fenders. Standard LED daytime running lights and taillights add an element of style and luxury.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nIt’s quiet and comfortable both in the city and on the highway; the cabin is isolated from wind and road noise, and bumps are well-damped for a smooth ride.\n\nPower from a stop is adequate, but that’s because Eco mode – which dulls the car’s acceleration response — automatically engages when the car is turned on. Disengage it via a button near the shifter for brisker takeoffs. Sport mode amps up the car’s responsiveness for extra-aggressive sprints (which seems counterproductive in a hybrid). Normal mode is in the middle, and that’s how I spent most of my drives.\n\nThe Sonata Hybrid can run on battery power alone at speeds up to 75 mph, and staying in EV mode was easy to do. Under light acceleration and during coasting, the car automatically goes into EV mode — indicated via a light on the dash — and the transition from hybrid mode to EV mode is seamless.\n\nFuel economy is up about 10 percent this year, to 39/43/41 mpg city/highway/combined. That’s excellent compared with the base, non-hybrid Sonata (25/38/30). If you consider the combined EPA rating, it also stands up well against the 2016 Ford Fusion Hybrid (44/41/42) and 2015 Toyota Camry Hybrid (43/39/41), but falls well short of the 2015 Honda Accord Hybrid (50/45/47). During 360 miles of mostly highway driving, I averaged 41.5 mpg. That’s below the car’s highway rating, but the sedan was loaded with people and luggage, and the air conditioning was used liberally.\n\nBoth around town and on the highway, the steering has a natural feel with good feedback. The regenerative brakes, however, are unsettling. The pedal is dull and spongy initially and requires more pressure than normal brakes, similar to the feel of other hybrids; this makes smooth stops difficult.\n\nThe Inside\n\nHyundai excels at interiors, consistently delivering cabins that are both comfortable and handsome, with upscale materials and stylish designs. For the most part, the Sonata Hybrid hits those same high notes.\n\nCabin materials were appropriately upscale on my top Sonata Limited trim, with handsome imitation-wood trim, chrome appliques and perforated leather seats. Some parts of the cabin are padded, but the door panel armrest could be cushier. The front seats’ bottom cushions were comfortable, but the back cushions weren’t concave enough for my liking, inducing some upper-back fatigue during long drives.\n\nIt’s not all style over substance inside; there are plenty of creature comforts standard on the Limited model that front and rear occupants can appreciate, including heated and cooled seats along with a heated steering wheel in front, plus manual sunshades in the backseat. Everyone benefitted from the enormous, optional panoramic moonroof.\n\nThe backseat is plenty roomy for two adults on nicely padded, supportive outboard seats. A smaller adult would also be comfortable in the middle position for a short trip. Optional LED reading lights are a nice touch.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nThe controls are straightforward, with an optional large 8-inch touch-screen for the multimedia system, easy station tuning and volume knobs, and clearly marked climate buttons. My model did not have the Apple CarPlay or Android Auto smartphone integration system, both of which the Sonata was the first car to offer.\n\nPairing my phone with the standard Bluetooth system and launching Pandora to stream music was drama-free, and there was no learning curve to figure out the audio or optional navigation system … when they worked, that is. During my test weekend, I experienced a few glitches: Driving through rural Wisconsin, the map frequently placed me off the road, when I was very much driving on a road. Also, the radio display screen froze when I tried to change stations using the touch-screen. Not even shutting the car off and restarting the system could fix it. It eventually restarted several hours later.\n\nWithin the multimedia system, there are several menus that display how the hybrid system is operating, which is common in hybrids. The most helpful (and one I haven’t seen before) is in the driving style submenu; it breaks down how much aggressive/normal/efficient driving you’ve been doing into simple percentages.\n\nCargo & Storage\n\nSmall-item storage is good, with a narrow but deep center console bin, as well as a large cubby under the climate controls and a small one near the cupholders.\n\nTrunk space is up a smidge for 2016, to 13.3 cubic feet, thanks to the battery’s new spot under the spare tire. It’s not bad compared with the regular Sonata’s 16.3 cubic feet of trunk space. The battery’s new placement also creates a flatter but higher trunk floor and allows the seats to fold in a 60/40 split in the Limited trim, a new feature that makes the sedan more versatile and is something the Honda Accord Hybrid doesn’t do. Historically, hybrid sedans have had small openings when they’ve had folding seats at all. The Sonata Hybrid’s large pass-through is the real deal.\n\nI was able to easily load a portable crib, double umbrella stroller and several bags in the trunk. By the numbers, the Sonata Hybrid has the biggest trunk, with a bit more room than the Accord Hybrid (12.7), Fusion Hybrid (12.0) and Camry Hybrid (13.1).\n\nSafety\n\nThe 2016 Sonata Hybrid has not yet been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. However, the non-hybrid model is an IIHS Top Safety Pick; it received an acceptable rating (out of a possible poor, marginal, acceptable or good) in the small overlap front test and good scores in all other tests. Its optional forward collision prevention system was rated basic.\n\nA backup camera is standard across the lineup; blind spot detection and rear cross-traffic alert systems are standard on Limited models but unavailable on base models. Lane departure warning and forward collision warning systems are optional, but only on Limited models. Click here for a full list of safety features.\n\nExposed lower Latch anchors make installing child-safety seats a breeze; two fit in the Sonata Hybrid’s backseat. Click here for the Car Seat Check.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nThe base Hyundai Sonata Hybrid starts at $26,825 — quite a bit higher than base non-hybrid models ($21,975), but on the bottom of the scale compared with the Accord Hybrid ($30,125), Fusion Hybrid ($27,400) and Camry Hybrid ($27,625). All prices include destination.\n\nThe Hyundai Sonata took top honors in Cars.com’s $27,000 Midsize Sedan Challenge for its winning blend of comfort, refinement and value; midsize-sedan shoppers looking for all those qualities plus excellent fuel economy should add the Sonata Hybrid to their test-drive list.",

      "expert_review": "The Verdict: With driving manners not much different from your typical gas-powered car — but significantly better estimated gas mileage — the redesigned 2020 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid makes going green easy. \n\nVersus the Competition: The 2020 Sonata Hybrid gets similar EPA-estimated gas mileage to its two main competitors — the Honda Accord Hybrid and Toyota Camry Hybrid — but its top trim level, the Limited, feels more luxurious inside and is packed with more technology. \n\nThere’s never been a better time to buy a hybrid. There are now many models with EPA-estimated combined gas mileage of 50 mpg or greater, and many of the driving experience quirks from which earlier hybrids suffered have been eliminated. (Periods of low gas prices also tend to keep hybrid demand low and prices reasonable — and prop up the value of a thirstier vehicle you might trade in.)\n\nThe 2020 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid, which is based on the dramatically styled 2020 Sonata (reviewed separately), embodies this phenomenon. Its hybrid drivetrain delivers a significant gas mileage bump — the base Blue trim level gets an estimated 52 mpg combined, while the mid-level SEL and top-of-the-line Limited trims are rated 47 mpg — without significantly diminishing the driving experience.\n\n2020 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid | Cars.com photo by Mike Hanley\n\nWe tested the Sonata Hybrid Limited, which is packed with safety and technology features, including a solar roof that can charge the hybrid battery pack. The base Blue trim starts at $28,725, including a $975 destination charge, but the Limited is priced at $36,275 including destination. \n\nRelated: 2020 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid: What’s the Deal With That Solar Roof?\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThe Sonata Hybrid’s 192-horsepower gas-electric drivetrain feels about as powerful as the normally aspirated gas four-cylinder engines that power many mid-size sedans. It’s quick enough at city and mid-range speeds, and it has modest reserve power for high-speed passing. What really stands out, however, is how well Hyundai has tuned the system; gas pedal response is immediate and consistent, without any hiccups when the gas engine kicks on.\n\n2020 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid | Cars.com photo by Mike Hanley\n\nHyundai is one of the rare automakers that uses a conventional automatic transmission with its hybrid drivetrain instead of the more common continuously variable transmission. The decision furthers the Sonata Hybrid’s feeling of normalcy because you can feel the six-speed automatic upshift when accelerating, just as you would in a regular gas-powered sedan with a conventional automatic. The brake pedal is a tad spongy, but pedal response is predictable. \n\nThe Sonata Hybrid has firm suspension tuning that lets you feel bumps and potholes, but ride quality isn’t harsh. SEL and Limited trims have 17-inch alloy wheels and tires with slightly shorter sidewalls than those on the base Blue trim, which gets 16-inch alloy wheels.\n\n2020 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid | Cars.com photo by Mike Hanley\n\nThat firm suspension tuning helps give the Sonata Hybrid great poise through fast corners, where the sedan does an admirable job resisting body roll. The steering, however, isn’t tuned to play along; it’s precise and responsive but lacks feedback. \n\nThe Interior\n\nChoosing the Sonata Hybrid instead of the regular Sonata doesn’t mean forgoing the gas-powered model’s many available high-tech convenience and safety features. The one advanced feature not offered on the hybrid is remote smart parking assist, and available features like a fully digital instrument panel and widescreen center display aren’t just tech features — they also give the interior an air of luxury.\n\n2020 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid | Cars.com photo by Mike Hanley\n\nThe Limited’s heated and ventilated leather front seats reinforce that impression. The front seats are comfortable, but if you like to sit higher when driving you may find that your eyes are nearly level with where the windshield meets the roof. \n\nThe Sonata Hybrid has the same sleek, coupelike shape as the regular sedan, but even with this sporty design there’s enough space in back for taller adults to sit comfortably. The seating position is low, which helps with headroom, but the bench seat still offers decent thigh support. \n\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity is standard. CarPlay started immediately when I connected my iPhone to the car, and the Limited trim’s responsive 10.2-inch touchscreen worked well with various apps. CarPlay doesn’t take full advantage of the widescreen display, however, leaving the right third reserved for a CarPlay icon or supplementary vehicle information.\n\nSafety and Driver-Assist Features\n\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety awarded the 2020 Sonata Top Safety Pick status, but the designation applies only to Limited trim levels, whose headlights are rated good (out of a possible good, acceptable, marginal or poor). The headlights on other trims are rated marginal.  \n\nThe Sonata received a good rating in all IIHS crash tests, and the car’s standard forward collision warning and automatic emergency braking system was rated superior (of a possible superior, advanced or basic). Other standard active safety features include adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability, blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert, lane-keep assist, automatic high-beam headlights and a driver-drowsiness monitor. \n\nOptional active safety features include Highway Driving Assist, which can help keep the Sonata Hybrid centered in its lane and at a set speed or distance from a vehicle ahead of it. Other options include a 360-degree camera system, rear automatic braking and a blind spot monitor that displays an image of your left or right blind spot in the Limited’s digital instrument panel when the turn signal is activated.\n\nCargo Space\n\nThe Sonata Hybrid’s trunk is the same size as the regular Sonata’s: 16 cubic feet. As part of its 2020 redesign, the Sonata Hybrid’s battery pack moved from the cargo area to underneath the rear seats, increasing cargo capacity. \n\nA 60/40-split, folding backseat is standard, and there’s a decent-sized opening to the passenger compartment when the seat is folded. There’s a ledge between the trunk floor and folded backseat, but Hyundai has thoughtfully added hard foam under the forward part of the trunk carpeting to create a ramp between the sections.\n\n2020 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid | Cars.com photo by Mike Hanley\nValue in Its Class\n\nWhen it comes to green cars, full battery-electric models easily generate the most buzz, but that doesn’t make them the right choice for every eco-conscious shopper. For those who regularly make long trips or don’t have ready access to a charging source, a gas-electric hybrid remains a good way to drive greener. We even named a hybrid our 2020 Eco-Friendly Car of the Year. \n\nGas prices may not be front of mind right now, with average prices considerably lower than they were a year ago, but if you’re concerned about them going up in the future — or just interested in using less fossil fuel — the Sonata Hybrid is worth a test drive. \n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2022 Hyundai Sonata?\n\n\nThe front-wheel-drive Hyundai Sonata is a sleek, modern, five-seat mid-size sedan. Engine choices include a standard 191-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder; an available 180-hp, turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder; and a 290-hp, turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder in the N Line trim level. A conventional eight-speed automatic transmission is standard, while the 290-hp four-cylinder gets an eight-speed dual-clutch automatic. The Sonata offers 19.8 cubic feet of trunk space, according to Cars.com’s cargo measurements.\n\nA gas-electric hybrid powertrain goes in the Sonata Hybrid, which is EPA-rated up to 52 mpg combined. Sonata competitors include the Honda Accord, Nissan Altima and Toyota Camry.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2022 Hyundai Sonata?\n\nThere’s a new Night Edition for the performance-oriented N Line trim that features a unique spoiler and special wheels and badges, but there are no other significant changes.\n\nWhat Features in the 2022 Hyundai Sonata Are Most Important? \n\nStandard features include:\n\nLED headlights\nCloth upholstery\n60/40-split folding backseat\n8-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane-keeping assist\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nPanoramic moonroof\nHands-free trunk lid\nLeather-trimmed seats\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\n25-inch touchscreen navigation system\nBose premium stereo\nWireless device charging\nHead-up display\nDigital Key for Android phones\n360-degree camera system\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nShould I Buy the 2022 Hyundai Sonata?\n\nThe Sonata is a spacious and well-equipped family sedan with distinctive styling and more available high-tech features than some competitors. The car’s push-button console gear selector doesn’t free up any extra storage space, however, and we wish the 10.25-inch touchscreen had a tuning knob.",

      "expert_review": "The Verdict: With driving manners not much different from your typical gas-powered car — but significantly better estimated gas mileage — the redesigned 2020 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid makes going green easy. \n\nVersus the Competition: The 2020 Sonata Hybrid gets similar EPA-estimated gas mileage to its two main competitors — the Honda Accord Hybrid and Toyota Camry Hybrid — but its top trim level, the Limited, feels more luxurious inside and is packed with more technology. \n\nThere’s never been a better time to buy a hybrid. There are now many models with EPA-estimated combined gas mileage of 50 mpg or greater, and many of the driving experience quirks from which earlier hybrids suffered have been eliminated. (Periods of low gas prices also tend to keep hybrid demand low and prices reasonable — and prop up the value of a thirstier vehicle you might trade in.)\n\nThe 2020 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid, which is based on the dramatically styled 2020 Sonata (reviewed separately), embodies this phenomenon. Its hybrid drivetrain delivers a significant gas mileage bump — the base Blue trim level gets an estimated 52 mpg combined, while the mid-level SEL and top-of-the-line Limited trims are rated 47 mpg — without significantly diminishing the driving experience.\n\n2020 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid | Cars.com photo by Mike Hanley\n\nWe tested the Sonata Hybrid Limited, which is packed with safety and technology features, including a solar roof that can charge the hybrid battery pack. The base Blue trim starts at $28,725, including a $975 destination charge, but the Limited is priced at $36,275 including destination. \n\nRelated: 2020 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid: What’s the Deal With That Solar Roof?\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThe Sonata Hybrid’s 192-horsepower gas-electric drivetrain feels about as powerful as the normally aspirated gas four-cylinder engines that power many mid-size sedans. It’s quick enough at city and mid-range speeds, and it has modest reserve power for high-speed passing. What really stands out, however, is how well Hyundai has tuned the system; gas pedal response is immediate and consistent, without any hiccups when the gas engine kicks on.\n\n2020 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid | Cars.com photo by Mike Hanley\n\nHyundai is one of the rare automakers that uses a conventional automatic transmission with its hybrid drivetrain instead of the more common continuously variable transmission. The decision furthers the Sonata Hybrid’s feeling of normalcy because you can feel the six-speed automatic upshift when accelerating, just as you would in a regular gas-powered sedan with a conventional automatic. The brake pedal is a tad spongy, but pedal response is predictable. \n\nThe Sonata Hybrid has firm suspension tuning that lets you feel bumps and potholes, but ride quality isn’t harsh. SEL and Limited trims have 17-inch alloy wheels and tires with slightly shorter sidewalls than those on the base Blue trim, which gets 16-inch alloy wheels.\n\n2020 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid | Cars.com photo by Mike Hanley\n\nThat firm suspension tuning helps give the Sonata Hybrid great poise through fast corners, where the sedan does an admirable job resisting body roll. The steering, however, isn’t tuned to play along; it’s precise and responsive but lacks feedback. \n\nThe Interior\n\nChoosing the Sonata Hybrid instead of the regular Sonata doesn’t mean forgoing the gas-powered model’s many available high-tech convenience and safety features. The one advanced feature not offered on the hybrid is remote smart parking assist, and available features like a fully digital instrument panel and widescreen center display aren’t just tech features — they also give the interior an air of luxury.\n\n2020 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid | Cars.com photo by Mike Hanley\n\nThe Limited’s heated and ventilated leather front seats reinforce that impression. The front seats are comfortable, but if you like to sit higher when driving you may find that your eyes are nearly level with where the windshield meets the roof. \n\nThe Sonata Hybrid has the same sleek, coupelike shape as the regular sedan, but even with this sporty design there’s enough space in back for taller adults to sit comfortably. The seating position is low, which helps with headroom, but the bench seat still offers decent thigh support. \n\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity is standard. CarPlay started immediately when I connected my iPhone to the car, and the Limited trim’s responsive 10.2-inch touchscreen worked well with various apps. CarPlay doesn’t take full advantage of the widescreen display, however, leaving the right third reserved for a CarPlay icon or supplementary vehicle information.\n\nSafety and Driver-Assist Features\n\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety awarded the 2020 Sonata Top Safety Pick status, but the designation applies only to Limited trim levels, whose headlights are rated good (out of a possible good, acceptable, marginal or poor). The headlights on other trims are rated marginal.  \n\nThe Sonata received a good rating in all IIHS crash tests, and the car’s standard forward collision warning and automatic emergency braking system was rated superior (of a possible superior, advanced or basic). Other standard active safety features include adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability, blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert, lane-keep assist, automatic high-beam headlights and a driver-drowsiness monitor. \n\nOptional active safety features include Highway Driving Assist, which can help keep the Sonata Hybrid centered in its lane and at a set speed or distance from a vehicle ahead of it. Other options include a 360-degree camera system, rear automatic braking and a blind spot monitor that displays an image of your left or right blind spot in the Limited’s digital instrument panel when the turn signal is activated.\n\nCargo Space\n\nThe Sonata Hybrid’s trunk is the same size as the regular Sonata’s: 16 cubic feet. As part of its 2020 redesign, the Sonata Hybrid’s battery pack moved from the cargo area to underneath the rear seats, increasing cargo capacity. \n\nA 60/40-split, folding backseat is standard, and there’s a decent-sized opening to the passenger compartment when the seat is folded. There’s a ledge between the trunk floor and folded backseat, but Hyundai has thoughtfully added hard foam under the forward part of the trunk carpeting to create a ramp between the sections.\n\n2020 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid | Cars.com photo by Mike Hanley\nValue in Its Class\n\nWhen it comes to green cars, full battery-electric models easily generate the most buzz, but that doesn’t make them the right choice for every eco-conscious shopper. For those who regularly make long trips or don’t have ready access to a charging source, a gas-electric hybrid remains a good way to drive greener. We even named a hybrid our 2020 Eco-Friendly Car of the Year. \n\nGas prices may not be front of mind right now, with average prices considerably lower than they were a year ago, but if you’re concerned about them going up in the future — or just interested in using less fossil fuel — the Sonata Hybrid is worth a test drive. \n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The Hyundai Sonata's electrified hybrid and plug-in hybrid models return for 2018 with the styling and interior updates rolled out for the mid-size sedan's 2018 gas-only models. While the hybrid will be generally available, Hyundai says the plug-in version will be distributed in California, Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island and Vermont, but it will be a special-order model in other states.\n\n\nThe hybrid hits dealerships in the first quarter of 2018 and the plug-in hybrid in the second quarter. Competitors include the Toyota Camry Hybrid, Chevrolet Malibu Hybrid, and Ford Fusion Hybrid and Fusion Energi plug-in hybrid.\n\nExterior\nThe electrified models get the 2018 design update that includes a new front end with Hyundai’s “cascading grille,” stronger sculpting, bigger openings and vertical LED daytime running lights. A new headlight shape stretches up and back; LED headlights are optional. The side panel below the doors and rear end are reshaped, as well, but the hybrids don’t get the gasoline models’ dual chrome exhaust tips. The hybrids get aerodynamic 16- and 17-inch wheel designs.\n\nInterior\nThe interior gets a new center display and controls for 2018. The standard 7-inch touchscreen (or 8-inch with optional navigation) is positioned slightly higher and is easier to see and reach. The arrangement of buttons and controls is cleaner. Other tech improvements include wireless phone charging for navigation-equipped models and an additional USB port for the rear seat.\n\nIn the instrument cluster, a hybrid power and charge indicator occupy the gasoline model’s tachometer space, and the touchscreen system gets additional hybrid-specific information such as energy flow and a specialized fuel-economy report.\n\nLike the gasoline models, the hybrids come with three years of free Hyundai Blue Link connected emergency, remote and guidance services that can be accessed via computer, a smarphone app, an Amazon Alexa skill and a Google Assistant app.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe gas engine in the hybrid and plug-in hybrid is a 2.0-liter four-cylinder that puts out 154 horsepower and 140 pounds-feet of torque, and both use a six-speed automatic transmission  (not a continuously variable-ratio automatic more typical of hybrids).\n\nThe hybrid powertrain adds a 38-kilowatt electric motor for a combined powertrain output of 193 hp, and it can run on electric power alone up to 75 mph, according to Hyundai. The system’s 1.76 kilowatt-hour battery is packaged under the trunk floor, allowing the hybrid to keep a 60/40-split folding rear seat to expand the 13.3-cubic-foot trunk.\n\nHyundai estimates the 2018 Sonata Hybrid SE (the highest-mileage model) will be rated 39/45/42 mpg city/highway/combined as it was in 2017 (the other trim levels were rated 38/43/40 mpg for 2017). That is competitive but lags mid-size hybrid sedan mileage leaders from Toyota and Chevrolet.\n\nThe plug-in hybrid gets a more powerful 50-kW electric motor coupled with the gasoline engine for a combined system output of 202 hp. The 9.8-kwh battery provides up to 27 miles of all-electric range on a full charge. That’s also the same as the 2017 model. A full charge takes about three hours on 240 volts, and about nine hours on a regular household outlet.\n\nThe hybrid models also get the same suspension and steering improvements as the conventional 2018 Sonatas.\n\nSafety\nStandard advanced safety features include blind spot warning and rear cross-traffic alert. Newly available for these models is a front collision warning system with automatic emergency braking and lane keep assist. Automatic high beams also are optional.",

      "expert_review": "Key Points:\n\nThe 2026 Sonata starts at $28,545, $400 more than the 2025 model, and the Sonata Hybrid costs $30,295 (all prices include $1,245 destination fee).\nHyundai has introduced the new SEL Sport and Blue Hybrid trims for the Sonata.\n\nThe Hyundai Sonata sedan rolls into the 2026 model year with a trim-level shake up. The base 2026 Sonata starts at $28,545, and Hyundai has merged the SEL and SEL Convenience trims into the SEL Sport on the gas-only model. A new entry-level Blue trim lowers the price of the hybrid to $30,295.\n\nRelated: 2025 Hyundai Sonata N Line Review: Banish Boring\n\nWhat’s New?\n\nThe trim shakeup in the Sonata lineup results in a few new features for certain trims, such as wireless phone charging, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and 18-inch alloy wheels on the SEL Sport; it’s the only variant that can be optioned with all-wheel drive.\n\nThe most noteworthy change happens in the Sonata Hybrid. The Hybrid Blue is the new, less expensive entry point, and it returns a Hyundai-estimated 51 mpg combined (the other hybrid variants top out at 47 mpg combined, though official EPA estimates for 2026 are not yet available).\n\nPricing and Release Date\n\nThe 2026 Hyundai Sonata and Sonata Hybrid are on sale now. Full pricing for the lineup is as follows, with 2025 prices in parentheses:\n\nSonata\nSE: $28,545 ($28,145)\nSEL Sport: $30,245 (new)\nN Line: $37,145 ($36,745)\nSonata Hybrid\nBlue: $30,295 (new)\nSEL: $33,545 ($32,495)\nLimited: $39,345 ($38,945)\nSafety Features and Trim Levels\n\nEvery 2026 Sonata comes with a comprehensive suite of driver-assist tech, including forward collision warning with pedestrian and bicyclist detection, intersection assist that watches for oncoming traffic during turns, automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, blind spot monitors, rear cross-traffic alert with automatic braking, lane departure steering assist, lane-centering steering, driver attention warning, automatic high beams, safe exit assist and a rear-seat reminder.\n\nThe base Sonata SE has 16-inch aluminum wheels, LED front and rear lighting, and keyless entry and start. It’s upholstered in cloth and has manually adjustable front seats, as well as a 12.3-inch touchscreen with satellite radio and wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay.\n\nThe new SEL Sport blends the features of the discontinued SEL and SEL Convenience. It rolls on 18-inch alloy wheels and has heated side mirrors, a power driver’s seat, heated front seats, dual-zone automatic climate control and wireless phone charging. It also comes with a column-mounted gear shifter and paddle shifters.\n\nThe N Line builds off the features of the SEL Sport but rides on 19-inch wheels and has unique front and rear exterior styling, a quad-outlet exhaust, rear spoiler and revised steering. It has a panoramic moonroof, 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster, navigation, synthetic-leather sport seats, aluminum pedals, ambient lighting, a 12-speaker Bose audio system and Digital Key 2.0, which allows the owner to use a paired smartphone as the vehicle key.\n\nThe Blue Hybrid mirrors the features of the base SE, while the SEL Hybrid mostly matches the SEL Sport in content, except the hybrid has a panoramic moonroof.\n\nThe loaded Limited Hybrid has 17-inch wheels but upgrades inside to leather upholstery and adds the 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster, navigation, heated and ventilated front seats, a 12-speaker Bose audio system, a 360-degree camera system, blind spot cameras, automated parking, a head-up display and rain-sensing windshield wipers.\n\nRead More About the Hyundai Sonata:\n\nIs the 2025 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid a Good Car? 6 Pros, 3 Cons\nWhich Used Cars Have the Best Crash-Test Scores?\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2025 Hyundai Sonata?\nWhat Are the Best Used Cars for $20,000?\nResearch the Hyundai Sonata\nPowertrain Specs and MPG\n\nThe 2026 Sonata can be had in three different powertrains: a gas-only 2.5-liter four-cylinder, a turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder and a 2.0-liter four-cylinder hybrid.\n\nThe base Sonata SE and new SEL Sport use the carryover 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine that makes 191 horsepower and 181 pounds-feet of torque. An eight-speed automatic transmission sends power to the front wheels, but AWD is available for $1,500 on the SEL Sport. Hyundai says the Sonata SE returns the same EPA-rated 28/38/32 mpg city/highway/combined as the 2025 model; the SEL Sport is rated at 25/36/29 mpg with FWD and 24/33/27 mpg with AWD.\n\nThe Sonata N Line adds a sportier option with a turbocharged version of the 2.5-liter four that boosts output to 290 hp and 311 pounds-feet. Only available with FWD, the N Line gets an eight-speed dual-clutch automatic for quicker shifts and is rated at 23/32/27 mpg.\n\nThe Sonata Hybrid has a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine paired with an electric motor and a battery pack for a combined output of 192 hp. A six-speed automatic sends power to the front wheels only. The Blue rates at 47/56/51, while the SEL and Limited rate at 44/51/47 mpg.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The 2016 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid delivers the comfortable ride, high-quality interior and affordable price of its gas-powered sibling with impressive fuel economy. Some competing hybrids, though, get better mpgs.\n \nThe gas-powered Sonata, which beat nine competitors in our $27,000 Midsize Sedan Challenge, was redesigned for 2015, but the hybrid version carried over until its redesign for the 2016 model year. Updates include a fresh face, increased efficiency and additional cargo room. Compare the two model years here.\n \nMidsize hybrid sedan competitors include the Honda Accord Hybrid, Ford Fusion Hybrid and Toyota Camry Hybrid; compare all four sedans here. \nExterior & Styling\nFor the green-car fans who like to say it loud and proud, the Sonata Hybrid might be too understated. Aside from an extra badge, it’s not easy to distinguish it from the non-hybrid version. The same thing is true for other hybrid sedans, as opposed to dedicated hybrid models, which are typically hatchbacks. The Sonata Hybrid lacks clues like a wedgy profile (Toyota Prius) or a graphics package (Chevrolet Volt). Instead, it mirrors the sleek style of its non-hybrid counterpart with a couple of minor deviations.\n \nThe Sonata Hybrid wears the regular version’s upright, squared-off face, but builds on that with an oversized version of the hexagonal grille and an emphasis on aerodynamics; there are sleeker front and rear bumpers and more-sculpted front fenders. Standard LED daytime running lights and taillights add an element of style and luxury.\nHow It Drives\nIt’s quiet and comfortable both in the city and on the highway; the cabin is isolated from wind and road noise, and bumps are well-damped for a smooth ride.\n \nPower from a stop is adequate, but that’s because Eco mode – which dulls the car’s acceleration response — automatically engages when the car is turned on. Disengage it via a button near the shifter for brisker takeoffs. Sport mode amps up the car’s responsiveness for extra-aggressive sprints (which seems counterproductive in a hybrid). Normal mode is in the middle, and that’s how I spent most of my drives.\n\nThe Sonata Hybrid can run on battery power alone at speeds up to 75 mph, and staying in EV mode was easy to do. Under light acceleration and during coasting, the car automatically goes into EV mode — indicated via a light on the dash — and the transition from hybrid mode to EV mode is seamless.\n\nFuel economy is up about 10 percent this year, to 39/43/41 mpg city/highway/combined. That’s excellent compared with the base, non-hybrid Sonata (25/38/30). If you consider the combined EPA rating, it also stands up well against the 2016 Ford Fusion Hybrid (44/41/42) and 2015 Toyota Camry Hybrid (43/39/41), but falls well short of the 2015 Honda Accord Hybrid (50/45/47). During 360 miles of mostly highway driving, I averaged 41.5 mpg. That’s below the car’s highway rating, but the sedan was loaded with people and luggage, and the air conditioning was used liberally.\n \nBoth around town and on the highway, the steering has a natural feel with good feedback. The regenerative brakes, however, are unsettling. The pedal is dull and spongy initially and requires more pressure than normal brakes, similar to the feel of other hybrids; this makes smooth stops difficult. \nThe Inside\nHyundai excels at interiors, consistently delivering cabins that are both comfortable and handsome, with upscale materials and stylish designs. For the most part, the Sonata Hybrid hits those same high notes.\n\nCabin materials were appropriately upscale on my top Sonata Limited trim, with handsome imitation-wood trim, chrome appliques and perforated leather seats. Some parts of the cabin are padded, but the door panel armrest could be cushier. The front seats’ bottom cushions were comfortable, but the back cushions weren’t concave enough for my liking, inducing some upper-back fatigue during long drives.\n \nIt’s not all style over substance inside; there are plenty of creature comforts standard on the Limited model that front and rear occupants can appreciate, including heated and cooled seats along with a heated steering wheel in front, plus manual sunshades in the backseat. Everyone benefitted from the enormous, optional panoramic moonroof.\n\nThe backseat is plenty roomy for two adults on nicely padded, supportive outboard seats. A smaller adult would also be comfortable in the middle position for a short trip. Optional LED reading lights are a nice touch.\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe controls are straightforward, with an optional large 8-inch touch-screen for the multimedia system, easy station tuning and volume knobs, and clearly marked climate buttons. My model did not have the Apple CarPlay or Android Auto smartphone integration system, both of which the Sonata was the first car to offer.\n\nPairing my phone with the standard Bluetooth system and launching Pandora to stream music was drama-free, and there was no learning curve to figure out the audio or optional navigation system … when they worked, that is. During my test weekend, I experienced a few glitches: Driving through rural Wisconsin, the map frequently placed me off the road, when I was very much driving on a road. Also, the radio display screen froze when I tried to change stations using the touch-screen. Not even shutting the car off and restarting the system could fix it. It eventually restarted several hours later.\n\nWithin the multimedia system, there are several menus that display how the hybrid system is operating, which is common in hybrids. The most helpful (and one I haven’t seen before) is in the driving style submenu; it breaks down how much aggressive/normal/efficient driving you’ve been doing into simple percentages.\nCargo & Storage\nSmall-item storage is good, with a narrow but deep center console bin, as well as a large cubby under the climate controls and a small one near the cupholders.\n\nTrunk space is up a smidge for 2016, to 13.3 cubic feet, thanks to the battery’s new spot under the spare tire. It’s not bad compared with the regular Sonata’s 16.3 cubic feet of trunk space. The battery’s new placement also creates a flatter but higher trunk floor and allows the seats to fold in a 60/40 split in the Limited trim, a new feature that makes the sedan more versatile and is something the Honda Accord Hybrid doesn’t do. Historically, hybrid sedans have had small openings when they’ve had folding seats at all. The Sonata Hybrid’s large pass-through is the real deal.\n\nI was able to easily load a portable crib, double umbrella stroller and several bags in the trunk. By the numbers, the Sonata Hybrid has the biggest trunk, with a bit more room than the Accord Hybrid (12.7), Fusion Hybrid (12.0) and Camry Hybrid (13.1).\nSafety\nThe 2016 Sonata Hybrid has not yet been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. However, the non-hybrid model is an IIHS Top Safety Pick; it received an acceptable rating (out of a possible poor, marginal, acceptable or good) in the small overlap front test and good scores in all other tests. Its optional forward collision prevention system was rated basic.\n\nA backup camera is standard across the lineup; blind spot detection and rear cross-traffic alert systems are standard on Limited models but unavailable on base models. Lane departure warning and forward collision warning systems are optional, but only on Limited models. Click here for a full list of safety features.\n\nExposed lower Latch anchors make installing child-safety seats a breeze; two fit in the Sonata Hybrid’s backseat. Click here for the Car Seat Check.\nValue in Its Class\nThe base Hyundai Sonata Hybrid starts at $26,825 — quite a bit higher than base non-hybrid models ($21,975), but on the bottom of the scale compared with the Accord Hybrid ($30,125), Fusion Hybrid ($27,400) and Camry Hybrid ($27,625). All prices include destination.\n \nThe Hyundai Sonata took top honors in Cars.com’s $27,000 Midsize Sedan Challenge for its winning blend of comfort, refinement and value; midsize-sedan shoppers looking for all those qualities plus excellent fuel economy should add the Sonata Hybrid to their test-drive list.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "The 2013 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid is a wolf in sheep’s clothing. It sneaks up on you with its cool styling, sleek lines and responsive throttle, but lurking somewhere beneath it all is an uber-efficient hybrid engine.\n\nI questioned which of the gas-only Sonata’s positive features would be sacrificed in the hybrid model, but I was wrong to be concerned. Gone are the days of expensive, dorky, underpowered, quirky-driving hybrids. Watch out, Toyota Prius!\n\nThe Hyundai Sonata is a five-seat hybrid sedan with tons of space that you can drive every day, improving upon the mileage of the gas-powered Sonata while enjoying all the benefits of a Hyundai. In fact, after a couple of days I completely forgot this was a hybrid — until I noticed that a number of days had passed with many miles under my belt and no urgent need to visit the gas station. That has to feel great as an owner of this car. For 2013, consumers can expect slightly improved fuel economy for a slightly lower starting price. Compare it with last year’s model here. If you’re in the market for a hybrid sedan, you may also want to look into the Ford Fusion Hybrid, the Toyota Camry Hybrid and the Honda Civic Hybrid. Check them out side by side here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nEven though the Sonata’s general styling hasn’t changed since a redesign for 2011, it still manages to look fresh and modern compared with other hybrid sedans on the market.\n\nThe Limited trim on the 2013 model swaps the standard 16-inch steel wheels for larger 17-inch alloy rims. These give the Sonata Hybrid Limited a more aggressive look than other hybrids on the market. Swooping LED-accented headlights, LED taillights and low, cat-eye-shaped fog lights add to the modern appeal.\n\nSubtle hybrid badging and a Hyundai logo modified with a blue background are classy touches. The kids declared this car “cool,” with my 9-year-old excitingly pronouncing that we finally got to test-drive a “sports car.”\n\nAs with regular Hyundai Sonatas, access in and out of the Hybrid Limited is easy, with ample leg and headroom when entering and exiting the car. This was applicable for me (at 5-foot-3) and for my 6-foot-2 husband. Typically, if it’s easy for him to get in and out, I feel like I’m climbing a mountain on every entry and exit.\n\nThe kids also had no problem getting in and out of the car. The doors felt and sounded solid when opened and closed (or on occasion slammed, as kids have a tendency to do when in a hurry), yet they didn’t require significant effort or associated “grunting” to pull shut, even from my youngest.\n\nHow It Drives\nIt seems every time I get into a hybrid or EV there’s a slight trepidation in my body and a little questioning voice lurking in the back of my head, wondering just how quirky this one will feel to drive. I am excited and happy to report that the new 2013 Sonata Hybrid did nothing but impress.\n\nAdmittedly, the regenerative brakes seem a little sensitive at first, especially when compared with my own personal old-school, gas-powered 2004 Mercedes C-Class. However, this touchy feeling was short-lived, as I quickly modified my braking style to be ever so much gentler.\n\nThe front-wheel-drive Hyundai Sonata Hybrid is very drivable and accelerates comfortably and smoothly, even while getting up to speed onto the highway at 6,500 feet above sea level with my whole family in the car. For 2013, the Sonata Hybrid got an upgraded, 47-kilowatt, lithium-polymer battery pack that’s lighter than the old one (91 pounds versus 96 pounds in the 2012 model). It supplies a more powerful electric motor that’s rated 47 horsepower, up from 40 hp. The combined 199 hp generated by the gas and electric motors in tandem is a bit lower than last year’s 206 hp, but the torque, which is what really gets the car moving, is up an impressive 40 pounds-feet to 235 pounds-feet.\n\nHyundai also improved the engine stop-start function, which results in a very smooth and almost unnoticeable transition from electric to gas. This is a high point, since other hybrid cars can give you quite a startle when the gas engine roars to life.\n\nGiven my increasing expectations for Hyundai vehicles, I would have liked to have had a quieter ride in the Sonata Hybrid. The amount of road noise was acceptable considering the competitors and the sedan’s price, but I would select a sound-deadening upgrade if it were available.\n\nThe EPA-estimated fuel economy for the base Hybrid version of the Hyundai Sonata is 36/40/38 mpg city/highway/combined, an improvement of 2 mpg combined over the 2012 model and 10 mpg combined over the most-efficient gas-only Sonata, which gets an estimated 24/35/28 mpg. Because it outweighs the base hybrid by more than 100 pounds, the Sonata Hybrid Limited has a 37 mpg combined estimate.\n\nIn the land of front-wheel hybrid mid-size sedan gas mileage, the Hyundai Sonata is beat blind by the Toyota Camry Hybrid (43/39/41 mpg), the Honda Civic Hybrid (44/44/44 mpg) and the Ford Fusion Hybrid (47/47/47 mpg).\n\nInterior\nThe interior of the Hyundai Sonata Hybrid is very similar to the regular Sonata. While I was not a huge fan of the large variety of materials and colors in my test car (do we really need so many different tones of gray, silver, charcoal and black?), the materials themselves and the quality fit and finish felt pricier than you’d expect given the car’s price tag.\n\nThe standard leather seats in the Limited looked good and felt great. It was easy for me to find a comfortable driving position, and the same applied to my tall husband, who had plenty of headroom.\n\nI was disappointed, however, that there was no memory function on the seat to save my settings, not even as an option. The last thing I want to do every time I get into the car after my husband is readjust the seats. With all the thoughtful features Hyundai puts in its cars, this oversight is the one thing that annoys the heck out of me. The Ford Fusion Hybrid has a standard driver memory setting in its Titanium trim and optional in the SE trim. Neither the Honda Civic Hybrid nor the Toyota Camry Hybrid has an available driver’s seat memory function, either.\n\nThere were lots of cupholders and little compartments to hold my family’s many devices and must-haves. Extra storage space is very valuable for a mom with little kids, as it keeps the knickknacks and clutter off the floor, close at hand and safely contained.\n\nThe rear seats had plenty of space, 34.6 inches of legroom, to be exact, and were comfortable for my three girls (ages 9, 11 and 13) even when squished in side by side like sardines. While this felt like enough space for my petite girls, families with gangly legged teens might want to focus their attention toward the extra legroom in the Civic Hybrid (36.2 inches), the Fusion Hybrid (38.3 inches) or the Camry Hybrid (38.9 inches).\n\nMy backseat testers appreciated the fact that they had a separate air vent so they could control the airflow to the backseat themselves without bothering me to do it for them. The fold-down center armrest in the back was also very popular when only two of them were in the car. It had a storage bin as well as cupholders, which made the younger ones feel very grownup, but, more important, kept drinks from spilling in the car.\n\nA double moonroof, part of a $1,000 Panoramic Sunroof Package, only added to the driving pleasure for both front and backseat passengers.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nHyundai seems to have found a healthy balance between electronic controls, touch-screens and good old-fashioned knobs and buttons. I appreciate being able to quickly look over, or simply feel with my hand, to find a knob or button to adjust volume, airflow or temperature. Taking my eyes off the road to look down and click through several menu screens just to adjust the temperature, as I must in some cars, just won’t work when I’m transporting my precious cargo around.\n\nThe airflow controls in the Hyundai Sonata look suspiciously like those in Volvos, which I happen to love. Imitation is the highest form of flattery, after all.\n\nWhile the gauges and controls were the same as in the regular Sonata — clear to see and easy to read and understand — the 4.2-inch electronic, color trip-computer screen between gauges has the option of displaying the vehicle’s hybrid functionality. To me, it was a little gimmicky and distracting. I know it’s a hybrid, I know how it works; I don’t need a little graphic showing me when it’s charging and when it’s not. I should really have just switched away from this screen, because I kept finding myself entranced by the cute little graphics.\n\nThe backup camera that’s standard on the Limited (but unavailable on the base hybrid) displayed on the navigation screen and was the perfect size for great visibility during daytime driving. However, the large, bright screen interfered with my night vision. Despite setting it to adjust automatically to a night mode, it was still too bright for me. It took a couple of clicks through menu screens to turn off the screen altogether. This is something I find myself doing more and more when driving at night in order to preserve my night vision. I’ve gotten to the point where I really appreciate vehicles with a one-touch off button.\n\nThe touch-screen controls worked well, and connecting via Bluetooth to my iPhone was seamless and easy.\n\nCargo & Storage\nIf cargo space is a huge priority, a gas-electric hybrid or electric-only sedan probably isn’t going to work for you. The Hyundai Sonata Hybrid has just 12.1 cubic feet of cargo volume due to the space the battery pack takes up in the trunk. Compare this with the regular Sonata’s 16.4-cubic-foot trunk. With the hybrid version, you also lose the ability to fold the rear seatbacks to expand the trunk if needed.\n\nThe trunk sill was not too high, and even the little ones could reach to close the lid.\n\nSafety\nThe 2013 Sonata earned status as a Top Safety Pick from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety; the Sonata Hybrid hasn’t been tested, but IIHS says the Sonata’s results apply. The gas-powered Sonata received the institute’s highest rating of good in all tests except the new small-overlap frontal crash test, in which the Sonata rated just marginal.\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gave the Hyundai Sonata Hybrid an overall safety rating of five out of five stars. This combines its four-star frontal crash-test result, five-star side crash test and five-star rollover-resistance rating.\n\nThe Sonata Hybrid Limited’s standard backup camera is displayed on a 7-inch touch-screen navigation display. (A backup camera is an optional upgrade on SE and Limited trim gas-powered Sonatas.) What the Sonata Hybrid is missing is other active safety options such as blind spot monitors, forward collision warning and lane departure warning, all of which are available on Sonata Hybrid competitors.\n\nHyundai’s Blue Link telematics system is standard in both the Hyundai Sonata Hybrid and Sonata Hybrid Limited and includes a 90-day free trial. While this system incorporates entertainment and service aspects, it’s the safety and peace of mind that I really appreciate. It includes automatic collision notification and assistance as well as SOS emergency assistance. With a daughter approaching driving age in the next few years, I’m also particularly excited about Blue Link’s speed alert, curfew alert and geofence alerts. These allow parents to preset speed, driving times and driving location limits and then be notified via text, email or phone if their teen driver breeches any of these.\n\nThe rear seat belt buckles are on floppy bases, which resulted in the little ones having a slightly harder time buckling their belts without getting frustrated. Once they were buckled, however, they seemed to be comfortable, and I didn’t hear any complaints relating to chafing or pressure points.\n\nThe lower Latch child-safety seat anchors are located in the two outboard seats, buried within the seat bight. See our complete Car Seat Check for the Sonata here.\n\nSee all the standard safety features listed here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nSome people might hesitate to jump onto the hybrid bandwagon for fear of issues with the more intricate hybrid parts. Hyundai has one of the best warranties in the marketplace, generally speaking. On the Sonata Hybrid, this includes a 120-month/100,000-mile hybrid electrical components powertrain warranty.\n\nThe Ford Fusion Hybrid, Honda Civic Hybrid and Toyota Camry Hybrid all have slightly less coverage: 96/100,000 for hybrid electrical components.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Hyundai Sonata?\n\nThe 2023 Hyundai Sonata is a mid-size sedan with a sleek shape and several powertrain choices: a standard 191-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder; an available 180-hp, turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder; a 2.0-liter hybrid setup generating 192 hp; and a potent 290-hp, turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder found in the sporty N Line. A conventional eight-speed automatic transmission is standard, while the 290-hp four-cylinder gets an eight-speed dual-clutch automatic. Fuel economy is impressive across the lineup, but it’s especially good in the hybrid. If you’re planning on carrying lots of cargo in your sedan, the Sonata’s a good option, with 19.8 cubic feet of trunk space, according to Cars.com’s cargo measurements.\n\nThe Sonata’s competition includes the Honda Accord, Kia K5, Nissan Altima and Toyota Camry.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Hyundai Sonata?\n\nVery little has changed as the Sonata enters the 2023 model year. The Sonata Hybrid Limited’s solar roof has been replaced by a panoramic moonroof, and a 10.25-inch infotainment screen has been added to SEL.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Hyundai Sonata Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nLED headlights\nCloth upholstery\n60/40 split-folding backseat\nSix-speaker stereo\n8-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nAutomatic emergency braking\nDriver drowsiness monitor\nRear-seat reminder\nPedestrian detection\nLane keeping assist \n\nAvailable features include:\n\nPanoramic moonroof\nHands-free trunk lid\nLeather-trimmed seats\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\n25-inch touchscreen navigation system\nBose premium stereo\nWireless device charging\nHead-up display\nSafe-exit warning\nDigital Key for Android phones\n360-degree camera system\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nShould I Buy the 2023 Hyundai Sonata?\n\nThe Hyundai Sonata is a great choice for car shoppers who want room for five people but don’t need the girth of a typical SUV. Relaxed driving manners and a choice of powertrains means there’s a Sonata for all types of drivers. The N Line is especially fun to drive, thanks to its 290-hp, turbo four-cylinder and firmer suspension settings, but it’s the Sonata’s long roster of standard comfort and safety features that’s likely to be the biggest draw for shoppers in search of a budget-friendly mid-size sedan.",
