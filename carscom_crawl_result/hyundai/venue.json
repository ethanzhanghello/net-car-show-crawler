      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Hyundai Venue?\n\nThe Hyundai Venue is a five-seat subcompact SUV powered by a 121-horsepower, 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine that’s paired with a continuously variable automatic transmission. All-wheel drive isn’t offered; all Venues are front-wheel drive. Rivals include the Chevrolet Trax, Honda HR-V, Nissan Kicks and Toyota Corolla Cross. If shuttling little ones is part of your daily driving routine, you can see how the Venue scored in our Car Seat Check.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Hyundai Venue? \n\nTwo backseat USB outlets are newly standard on the mid-range SEL and top Limited trims. Previously offered solely on the Limited, keyless entry with push-button start is newly standard in the SEL, and a six-speaker stereo replaces the prior four-speaker system in the base SE trim.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Hyundai Venue Are Most Important? \n\nStandard features include:\n\n8-inch touchscreen \nTwo USB ports\nWireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity\nSix-speaker stereo\nDriver attention monitor\nLane departure steering assist\nRear-seat reminder\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nLED headlights\nSatellite radio\nNavigation\nPower moonroof \n17-inch alloy wheels\nAutomatic climate control\nHeated front seats\nBlind spot warning \nRear cross-traffic alert\nShould I Buy the 2024 Hyundai Venue? \n\nViewed in terms of its price, the Venue is a terrific bargain even when kitted out in its range-topping Limited trim. Two things hold it back: meager acceleration with its four-cylinder engine and a lack of AWD on its option sheet. To be fair, few of the Venue’s subcompact SUV rivals deliver exhilarating levels of horsepower, and the fact that the Venue is good on gas and easy to park will likely matter much more to drivers shopping for an affordable pint-sized vehicle.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Hyundai Venue?\n\nThe Hyundai Venue is a five-seat subcompact SUV powered by a 121-horsepower, 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine that’s paired with a continuously variable automatic transmission. This powertrain is great in terms of fuel economy, but acceleration is middling at best, and all-wheel drive isn’t offered; all Venues are front-wheel drive. In the plus column, the Venue is affordable, and its small size makes it very maneuverable. Rivals include the Chevrolet Trax, Honda HR-V, Nissan Kicks and Toyota Corolla Cross. If shuttling little ones is part of your daily driving routine, you can see how the Venue scored in our Car Seat Check by clicking here.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Hyundai Venue? \n\nThe Venue is carried over for 2025 with no notable updates.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Hyundai Venue Are Most Important? \n\nStandard features include:\n\n8-inch touchscreen \nTwo USB ports\nWireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity\nSix-speaker stereo\nDriver attention monitor\nLane departure steering assist\nRear-seat reminder\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nLED headlights\nSatellite radio\nNavigation\nPower moonroof \n17-inch alloy wheels\nAutomatic climate control\nHeated front seats\nBlind spot warning \nRear cross-traffic alert\nShould I Buy the 2025 Hyundai Venue? \n\nViewed in terms of its price, the Venue is a terrific bargain even when kitted out in its range-topping Limited trim. Two things hold it back: meager acceleration with its four-cylinder engine and a lack of AWD on its option sheet. To be fair, few of the Venue’s subcompact SUV rivals deliver exhilarating levels of horsepower, and the fact that the Venue is good on gas and easy to park will likely matter much more to drivers shopping for an affordable pint-sized vehicle.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2022 Hyundai Venue?\n\nThe five-seat Hyundai Venue subcompact SUV is powered by a 121-horsepower, 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine that works with a continuously variable automatic transmission. The Venue is available only with front-wheel drive. Nimble and easy to park thanks to its small size, the Venue personifies the “cute-ute” class that also includes models like the Nissan Kicks and Toyota C-HR. You can see how the Venue scored in our Car Seat Check here.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2022 Hyundai Venue? \n\nThe top-of-the-line Denim trim level has been renamed Limited, but there are no other significant changes. \n\nWhat Features in the 2022 Hyundai Venue Are Most Important? \n\nStandard features include:\n\n15-inch alloy wheels \nCloth seating\nCruise control\n8-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nWireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane-keeping assist\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n17-inch alloy wheels \nLED headlights\nPower moonroof \nAutomatic air conditioning\nHeated front seats\nSatellite radio\nNavigation\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nShould I Buy the 2022 Hyundai Venue? \n\nThe Hyundai Venue is a good match for suburban or city-based drivers who want the look of an SUV but the size and fuel-sipping demeanor of a small hatchback. Its lack of all-wheel drive limits the Venue’s appeal, but it does include a lot of safety and tech features for the money. Value is also an important part of the equation, which is why the Venue won our Best Value of 2021 award.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2021 Hyundai Venue?\n\nAll-new last year, the five-seat Hyundai Venue subcompact SUV is long on features and value-priced. Powered by a 121-horsepower, 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine that works with a continuously variable automatic transmission, the Venue is available only with front-wheel drive. Competitors include the Nissan Kicks and Toyota C-HR. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2021 Hyundai Venue? \n\nThe base SE trim level gets 15-inch alloy wheels, while the SEL trim adds blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert, a sliding armrest and a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob. A six-speed manual transmission is no longer available; all trims have a CVT. \n\nWhat Features in the 2021 Hyundai Venue Are Most Important?\nStandard active safety features include forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, lane-keeping assist, a driver attention monitor and automatic high-beam headlights\n8-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nAndroid Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity\nRemote keyless entry\nPower moonroof available \nShould I Buy the 2021 Hyundai Venue?\n\nUrban dwellers and others who prefer a vehicle that’s easy to maneuver and park would do well to consider the Venue. Two-tone paint options offer a bit of style, there’s room for adults in front and back (at least for short trips) and the Venue includes a lot of safety and convenience features for the money. Value is a big part of the Venue’s appeal, and it won our Best Value of 2021 award.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Hyundai Venue?\n\nThe five-seat Hyundai Venue subcompact SUV is powered by a 121-horsepower, 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine that works with a continuously variable automatic transmission. The Venue is available only with front-wheel drive; all-wheel drive isn’t offered on any trim. Agile and easy to maneuver thanks in part to its small size, the Venue competes with rivals like the Chevrolet Trailblazer, Honda HR-V, Nissan Kicks and Subaru Crosstrek. Have little ones to tote around? Be sure to check out how the Venue scored in our Car Seat Check by clicking here.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Hyundai Venue?\n\nThe Venue’s changes for the 2023 model year are minor. A rear-seat reminder feature is new and standard, the gauge cluster’s digital screen is upgraded from 3.5 inches to a 4.2-inch color unit, and the previously optional center console armrest is now standard. The Limited trim gets standard wireless device charging.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Hyundai Venue Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n15-inch alloy wheels\nTwo USB ports\nKeyless entry\n8-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nWireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure steering assist\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n17-inch alloy wheels\nLED headlights\nPower moonroof\nAutomatic climate control\nHeated front seats\nSatellite radio\nNavigation\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nShould I Buy the 2023 Hyundai Venue?\n\nFirst and foremost, the Venue’s lack of all-wheel drive will deter some SUV shoppers who insist on being able to send power to all four wheels. There’s also only so much passing power provided by the 121-hp four-cylinder engine. The Venue is, however, a great value thanks to an ample lineup of standard comfort, tech and safety features. It’s sized for city driving and can squeeze into tight parking spots with ease. The Venue faces a lot of worthy competition, but this likable little sport-ute did win our Best Value of 2021 award.",

      "expert_review": "Hyundai first introduced the 2020 Venue, its sub-subcompact “SUV” at the 2019 New York International Auto Show (SUV is in quotation marks because the Venue is front-wheel-drive only). I drove it around sunny Miami and on a quick trip to Islamorada in the Florida Keys at Hyundai’s national media drive event (Per our ethics policy, Cars.com pays for travel and lodging at such automaker-sponsored programs).\n\nRelated: 2020 Hyundai Venue Downsizes From Kona, Stretches Definition of SUV\n\nThe Venue is designed to capitalize on the current popularity of SUVs and target younger millennials with a low starting price and generous standard technology and safety features. Hyundai believes a new car with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a standard 8-inch multimedia display and things like forward collision avoidance with pedestrian detection will appeal to the first-time car buyer who might otherwise choose a three- or four-year-old used car that lacks such features.\n\nWhether that demographic analysis plays out or not, what Hyundai has built is a capable city car that ably replaces the Accent hatchback (the sedan remains) as a nimble way to get from point A to point B in the city, and that can even handle shorter highway trips. It joins the ranks of high-riding front-drive hatchbacks like the Nissan Kicks and Toyota C-HR, and it offers both solid competition for first-time car buyers and those looking for a small, affordable and moderately utilitarian new car.\n\nIt Drives Well Enough\n\nThe Venue has one engine, an updated 1.6-liter four-cylinder that can also be found in the Accent sedan. Two transmissions are offered with the Venue: a six-speed manual available only in base SE trim levels and a continuously variable automatic available on the SE and standard on SEL and Denim trims. (Hyundai had only SEL and Denim examples on hand, so I have no opinion on the manual.)\n\nThe engine produces 121 horsepower and 113 pounds-feet of torque. If that doesn’t sound like a lot to you, you won’t be surprised to learn that it doesn’t feel like a lot. Accelerating from a stop is a gradual process; accelerator response isn’t outstanding and power doesn’t really come on until roughly 3,500 rpm. Sport mode improves response and was my preferred driving mode for the city. For general highway cruising, I tended to keep the Venue in Normal except for passing maneuvers when I would switch to Sport, which is certain to diminish the rated fuel economy.\n\nThe EPA-estimated gas mileage for the automatic Venue is 30/34/32 mpg city/highway/combined (27/35/30 mpg for the manual), and on our highway-heavy drive, the Venue’s computer routinely displayed a fuel economy rating of more than 35 mpg. The 2020 Nissan Kicks is rated slightly higher by the EPA at 31/36/33 mpg, while the 2020 Toyota C-HR lags behind both at 27/31/29 mpg.\n\nWhat surprised me most about the Venue was how composed and balanced it felt even at highway speeds. While you’ll still feel bumps and potholes and uneven pavement, especially because of the Venue’s short, 99.2-inch wheelbase, it does a good job of isolating occupants and keeping the ride feeling smooth. Steering feel is also good for the class, but you’ll never confuse the Venue for a sports car.\n\nComfortable Inside\n\nThe Venue’s cabin feels spacious for its size, at least up front. I never felt cramped in the front seats despite my 6-foot, 1-inch height, though I wouldn’t have minded a slightly wider footwell for the front passenger seat. Headroom was also impressive, though it helped that the Denim model I spent most of my time in isn’t available with a sunroof. The lower roof in the sunroof-equipped SEL models didn’t leave me ducking while behind the wheel, however.\n\nStill, if you’re a taller driver looking at a Venue, I’d suggest sitting in one with and without a sunroof before making your choice. Note that the sunroof is part of the Convenience Package on SEL models, and while losing out on a sliding armrest storage box and leather-wrapped steering wheel may be sacrifices you’re willing to make, blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert is also part of that package.\n\nThe front seats are comfortably wide, though I found the lumbar support a bit too much. As an entry-level vehicle, neither the driver’s seat nor front passenger seat have power adjustments. The driver’s seat adjusts six ways while the passenger seat can be adjusted in four ways (there’s no height adjustment). In the backseat, I still had more than adequate headroom but found my knees angled upward while sitting. With the front seat in my preferred position, I also didn’t have enough legroom in back. Adjusting either front seat to give myself enough legroom left me uncomfortable up front. This isn’t the interior for longer trips — particularly without device charging ports or adjustable climate vents in the back.\n\nThe cabin materials are as nice as to be expected in a car that costs less than $24,000 fully loaded — which is to say, not very. Hard plastics abound and there’s not much padding on most touchpoints, but the interior design itself is pleasant. Cloth seats are standard on the SE and SEL, and if you opt for the Denim, the seating surfaces are trimmed with faux leather and have fabric inserts that mimic, well, denim.\n\nCargo space is adequate at best, with enough space for a few smaller bags or some groceries. Hyundai says the Venue has 18.7 cubic feet behind the backseat. With the 60/40-split, folding rear seat lowered, that increases to a claimed 31.9 cubic feet. That puts it behind its competition, with Toyota measuring the C-HR at 19.1 cubic feet with the backseat up and 37.0 cubic feet with the seats down. The Kicks beats both, however, with 25.3 and 53.1 cubic feet, respectively.\n\n‘Young Millennials’ = Tech and Safety\n\nWhat really makes the Venue’s interior a nice place to be is its standard tech features. The horizontally oriented 8-inch touchscreen is standard and larger than those of competitors. While it’s not running the latest software we’ve seen on some Hyundais, it responds quickly enough and the company’s infotainment system remains among the most intuitive and user-friendly on the market. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are both standard, as well. Built-in navigation with real-time traffic updates is available on SEL models and standard on Denim ones.\n\nBesides the collision detection and forward automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, the Venue also comes equipped with lane departure warning, lane keep assist and a driver attention warning system. Its standard backup camera also has moving guidelines. Blind spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert is standard on Denim trims and optional on the SEL, and the same distinction applies to LED headlights and daytime running lights. All trim levels come with cruise control, but adaptive cruise control is not available, which is a shame given the frequent stop-and-go traffic the Venue is likely to encounter in the city environments for which it’s designed.\n\nOne highlight of the safety features’ forward sensors are audio and visual notifications when the car ahead of you in stopped traffic has pulled away — perfect for the growing number of drivers who use every stoplight as an excuse to look at their phone.\n\nThe Value Proposition\n\nThere are only two option packages for the Venue, and both are available only on the SEL. The first, the Convenience Package, adds a sunroof, armrest storage, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, and blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert. The other is the Premium Package, which adds LED headlights and daytime running lights, heated front seats and mirrors, 17-inch wheels in place of the standard 15s, keyless entry with push-button start, navigation and Hyundai’s Blue Link connected car services. The Denim version of the Venue includes all of those features as standard except for the sunroof. An SEL with both option packages will cost $23,270 including the $1,120 destination fee, while a Venue Denim comes in at $23,170.\n\nThose prices are a bit higher than the most expensive Nissan Kicks but nearly as low as the base price for a Toyota C-HR. The Kicks offers blind spot warning as a standard feature, unlike the Venue, and a lot more cargo space, but it also offers a less refined driving experience and a more basic interior. The C-HR, meanwhile, has relatively comparable cargo specs to the Venue but more power and even more standard safety features, including adaptive cruise control that works to a complete stop.\n\nWhat will set the Venue apart is its combination of technology, style and value, and that should be a winning combination for many new car shoppers — and, Hyundai hopes, those who might believe they’ll have to resort to a used car.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
