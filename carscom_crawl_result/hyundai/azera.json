      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in July 2012 about the 2012 Hyundai Azera. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2013, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nEditor’s note: Estimated mileage ratings have been lowered to reflect a November 2012 EPA audit of this car’s stated mileage.\n\nThe Hyundai Azera full-size sedan got an extreme makeover (auto edition) for 2012 (see it compared side by side with the 2011 model here). In size and price, the Azera competes with the Toyota Avalon, versions of the Ford Taurus and even the Hyundai Genesis sedan, though the latter is rear-wheel drive while the others have front-wheel drive (see a comparison).\n\nThe redesigned 2012 Hyundai Azera has almost everything you’d ever want in a large luxury sedan, for half the price, but a couple of shortcomings annoyed me day in and day out.\n\nRather than getting customers in the door with the promise of a great price tag then up-charging for every little feature, the Azera comes in just one trim level, and the only option is a $4,000 Technology Package comprised mainly of convenience features. The fully loaded Azera is a bargain at around $36,000.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe 2012 Azera is a sexy, sleek, swooping sedan that owners would enjoy gazing at in their driveway every day. Others agreed; several of our editors noted compliments from passers-by. Its downward-sloping rear quarter panel and wide, low stance give the car an upscale, slightly Jaguar-esque look.\n\nFAMILY-FRIENDLY FEATURES\nOf course, a sedan with a low step-in height makes it easy for kids on small legs — like my 7- , 9- and 11-year-old daughters — to climb in easily. There’s so much backseat space that they had tons of legroom to spare. There’s enough legroom for full-sized adults, as well. I wouldn’t be embarrassed to pick up my parents for a family dinner in this car, as I am when I try to squeeze them into the tiny backseats of so many of my other test cars.\n\nBackseat passengers have access to in-door storage bins with bottleholders, as well as cupholders and another storage bin in the fold-down center armrest. Due to a heat wave in the Denver area, my family got quite a bit of use out of the Azera’s sunshades (which are included in the optional Technology Package). A power-operated shade on the rear window (the control for which is up front), along with manual sunshades on the two rear side windows helped keep the car’s black interior at a manageable temperature even when parked in the sun.\n\nThe large, panoramic moonroof included in the Technology Package was great for keeping the Azera’s interior from feeling too cavelike. However, one editor noted that its sunshade automatically closes when you close the roof. To keep the shade open, you have to stop it after the roof closes. Another editor complained about the inability to vent the sunroof without first opening the shade all the way, noting that any of the desired cooling action when parked is lost due to the “greenhouse effect.”\n\nUp front, the driver’s seat got mixed reviews from my 6-foot-plus husband and me. He raved about how comfortable and supportive the large, soft driver’s seat was. The multi-adjustable seat is controlled by Mercedes-inspired buttons that are visible and easily accessible on the door panel, rather than tucked out of view on the side of the seat bottom. A powered tilt/telescoping steering wheel and driver’s seat cushion extension — both part of the Technology Package — help customize the fit. However, despite all this adjustability, I had a tough time finding a position perfect for my 5-foot-3 frame. I tried raising and lowering the head restraint, adjusting it forward and then back again, fiddling with the seats and the lumbar adjustments — I felt like Goldilocks trying to find the rocking chair that was just her size. Unfortunately, I think the Azera is just better suited to a bigger driver. I’d be more comfortable as a passenger.\n\nOnce I’d switched on the ventilated seats (again part of the Technology Package) in 90-degree weather, all was temporarily forgiven while I drove in temperate bliss with cool air caressing my bare legs. Ah!\n\nThe Azera’s center control panel appears to float in midair, just like those in Volvos. A storage bin behind it is great for holding loose items, like my husband’s wallet and phone. The ceiling console above the rearview mirror — which houses the interior lights, a sunglasses holder and the moonroof button — was cheap and plasticky looking, out of place in an otherwise well-thought-out interior. One of our editors called the car’s blue accent lighting “cheesy.”\n\nThe Azera offers a large trunk with plenty of space for family essentials, and my golf clubs fit easily without finagling. With 16.3 cubic feet of volume, it doesn’t compare with the Taurus’ 20.1 cubic feet, but few cars do. The 2012 Avalon’s trunk is smaller still, at 14.4 cubic feet. Interestingly, the larger Genesis sedan has less room than the Azera: 15.9 cubic feet.\n\nThe Azera’s rear seats split 60/40 and can fold in the event more space is needed. The backseats in the Avalon and Genesis don’t.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nBEHIND THE WHEEL\nThe Azera manages to filter out quite of bit of road and wind noise, leaving the cabin peaceful and quiet. I appreciated the smooth, easy acceleration from a stop and the predictable braking. In my experience, the suspension was soft enough to even out bumps and rough pavement in suburban driving, however, another editor said the Azera on 19-inch wheels should have had better ride quality for such a large car, and that city pavement divots jolted the cabin. The 19-inch wheels are optional; the standard 18-inch rims might soften the ride a bit.\n\nOur team of editors took issue with the Azera’s steering. Words such as “touchy,” “jittery,” “fatiguing,” “oversensitive” and “disappointing” were used to describe it.\n\nThe Eco mode attempts to improve on 20/28 mpg city/highway fuel economy. It does just that, and fairly discreetly. The average driver may not even notice the changes to the driving feel in Eco mode.\n\nFunny music plays in the Azera upon startup and shutdown, which was a novelty during the two weeks I drove it, seeming to act as a score for a soap opera: “And tomorrow on Cars of Our Lives …” I’m sure the novelty would wear off quickly if I owned this car, so you’ll be glad to know the jingle can be turned off.\n\nSAFETY\nCrash tests have not been conducted on the 2012 Hyundai Azera. As is required of all 2012 models, it has standard antilock brakes and an electronic stability system with traction control. The Azera has nine standard airbags, including a driver’s knee airbag, two front airbags, side-impact torso airbags for the front and rear, and side curtain airbags for front and rear outboard occupants.\n\nThe Azera comes standard with a backup camera that turns on immediately upon putting the car into Reverse (even if you have the radio/nav screen turned off, unlike in many cars). Rear park assist sensors are included in the optional Technology Package. The Azera also comes equipped with Hyundai’s Blue Link system, which offers emergency roadside assistance, theft recovery, remote vehicle access, navigation assistance and traffic information. Blue Link also offers the ability to set driving curfew limits, speed-limit notifications and geofence limits in the event you share your car with a teen driver.\n\nThe one thing the Azera oddly doesn’t have is a blind spot warning system. This seems like a glaring oversight considering even budget compact cars like the Dodge Dart are adding blind spot monitors.\n\nMy kids in the backseat were easily able to buckle their own seat belts even when in high-back booster seats (and despite the buckles being on flimsy bases) thanks to the Azera’s flat, wide seats. The lower Latch anchors are stored within the seat bight rather than being visible.

      "expert_review": "Affordable luxury sounds like a contradiction, but Hyundai has shown it can (and does) exist with its redesigned 2012 Azera.\n\nThe Azera scored big with my family. With all its modern-day conveniences and tons of room inside, each of us had different reasons for loving it. Even my toddler showed signs of relaxation inside the Azera, and she’s not one for long rides in the car. She logged some serious hours inside the Azera because I always found a reason to drive it. Whether I was in gridlock on one of the many congested Los Angeles freeways or just en route to the grocery store, the Azera was a pleasure to drive.\n\nEnough gushing. Besides luxury, the Azera provides a great driving experience, too. With a ride soft enough to be comfortable but not so much that I could be lulled to sleep, it seemed to strike just the right chord. Its V-6 engine gives it a restrained power. In other words, I never really felt a surge of power when putting pedal to metal; it was more of a gradual, building power. It wasn’t a problem for me, but the Azera may be a bit too subtle for some who enjoy the performance of a larger engine.\n\nThe 2012 Hyundai Azera starts at $32,875 (including an $875 destination charge), but the addition of the Technology Package boosted my test car’s price to $36,875.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe Azera is a gorgeous sedan. Its redesign makes it almost unrecognizable when compared to the previous generation. It’s similar in looks to the other Hyundai sedans like the Elantra and Sonata with its sculpted frame and fluid design; the Azera is just a little larger. It looks mature and just a touch no-nonsense, but it’s still a looker all the same.\n\nDespite its sleek profile and seemingly low-slung stature, the Azera is much easier to enter and exit than you might think. It’s a nice surprise to find you don’t have to sacrifice function for form. Grandparents all the way to young children should have no troubles getting in and out of the Azera, but they should take extra care when opening the doors. The sedan sits low and it seems easy to scratch the door’s bottom when opening it near a curb.\n\nThe Azera’s trunk is spacious; go ahead and pack the double stroller in it. With my single stroller, portable crib and quick jaunt to the supermarket, I did just fine hauling all I needed in the Azera’s trunk.\n\nThe Azera has a 293-horsepower, 3.3-liter V-6 that’s paired with a six-speed automatic transmission. The biggest fault I found with the Azera was its EPA-estimated fuel economy of 20/29 mpg city/highway. I averaged 16 mpg on city streets. Thank goodness the Azera only requires regular unleaded gasoline; with low numbers like 16 mpg and a large fuel tank, it makes for higher costs at the pump.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Excellent\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nINTERIOR\nEverything about the Azera is upscale — from the leather-wrapped steering wheel to the LED ambient lighting in the cabin.\n\nAny seat inside the Azera is a great one to be in. In addition to its sleek center console with brushed aluminum-looking plastic trim, drivers will love the modern displays and graphics. Passengers will revel in the generous legroom and ample personal space, and everybody will enjoy standard heated leather seats (even the backseat passengers!).\n\nThose who claim ambivalence toward the bells and whistles will be wowed the Azera’s interior space. This is great news for gangly teens as well as front passengers with a child-safety seat installed behind them. My husband was a happy passenger all week long as he rode shotgun — legs outstretched and all. The backseat is huge. I easily fit two child-safety seats in the back, and if I didn’t have safety seats, three passengers could sit comfortably in the second row.\n\nAlso standard on the Azera is Hyundai’s Blue Link, which is similar to GM’s OnStar, and offers personalized concierge service. Whether you need directions, reservations, emergency roadside service or even the lowest gas prices in your area, Blue Link can provide you with the information with just one touch of a button on the rearview mirror. It also can keep tech-savvy parents connected with the internet, and it even has a smartphone application. It allows parents to receive alerts when the car leaves an established perimeter or is driven after a designated time. Now that is family friendly!\n\nAs the mother of a toddler, my favorite features were the Azera’s optional sunshades. On L.A.’s hot, sunny days, my daughter, who sits in a rear-facing car seat, was kept cool by the sunshades on both rear door windows and a power sunshade that covered the rear window. There aren’t enough words to describe how wonderful these small details made my long commutes.\n\nThe Azera also has four cupholders, bottleholders in the door pockets, a large center console, an overhead compartment to stash your sunglasses and a big ol’ glove box.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2012 Azera has been named a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. To earn this safety nod, a car must receive the top score of Good in front, side, rear and roof-strength crash tests. The 2012 Azera hasn’t been crash-tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nThere are two sets of lower Latch anchors in the Azera’s backseat. Although they appear to be buried by the seat cushions, the anchors are easily accessible. With such a large backseat, there’s plenty of room to maneuver when installing a car seat. Find out how the 2012 Azera performed in Cars.com’s Car Seat Check.\n\nThe Azera has standard front-wheel drive, antilock brakes, an electronic stability system with traction control, a backup camera and nine airbags, including a driver’s knee airbag and rear side-impact airbags.

      "expert_review": "Any lingering doubts about whether Hyundai is still producing tinny, cheap-looking automobiles should be blown away by the 2006 Hyundai Azera, a bona fide luxury liner in the sedan segment. The tested Azera Limited is a whole new ballgame, but its price remains old-school Hyundai — starting at an almost outrageously low $26,835.\n\nIf I had been blindfolded and tossed into the driver’s seat of this car, I would have estimated its sticker at $40,000 after taking it for a test drive (and removing the blindfold, of course).\n\nThe Azera is one reason why Hyundai is winning automotive awards from J.D. Power and Associates and soaring in consumer-satisfaction surveys.\n\nGone are the days when Hyundai carpet-bombed the U.S. marketplace with stripped-to-the-bone cars that, while attractively priced, had all the appeal of a $5 hairpiece and all the reliability of a paper surfboard. In the tested Limited, standard offerings included electronic stability control, traction control, eight standard air bags (including side curtain), 17-inch alloy wheels, leather seating surfaces, power/heated front seats, power rear sunshade, woodgrain-trimmed steering wheel/door handles, steering wheel-mounted audio controls and automatic-adjusting headlights.\n\nEven an optional $1,500 package that included a power sunroof and an Infinity sound system with a six-disc CD changer kept the price of the tester nearly $1,700 under the $30,000 plateau.\n\nThrow in the exceptional Hyundai warranties — including 10 years or 100,000 miles on the powertrain — and you might ask why anyone would pay $35,000 or more for an upscale sedan.\n\nWhy, indeed? Motorists often wish they could afford more luxury features in their vehicles. With Azera, that goal is within reach of more budgets.\n\nInstead of a V-8, Hyundai opted for a sizable 3.8-liter V-6 under the hood. Given its performance, I’d say it was a good call.\n\nOn the tester, the 263-horsepower V-6 accelerated strongly and smoothly. The Azera was a nimble highway performer. On city streets, it steered with ease. Only at the top of steep uphill runs did it begin to groan, but not to the point of desperation.\n\nBrakes performed well, and the suspension had the kind of stability and firmness one expects in a luxury family sedan.\n\nGas mileage is advertised at a so-so 19 miles per gallon in the city and 28 mpg on the highway, but the nearly 20-gallon fuel tank can be filled with unleaded regular, according to Hyundai.\n\nInterior styling is downright Mercedes-Benz-like, from the illuminated climate/audio readouts to the robust, firm-feeling, woodgrain-spiced gear shifter in the center console. Back-seat room is not cavernous, but it’s certainly comfortable — even for three adults.\n\nOn the outside, the look is a mixture of understated, upscale sedan classiness and sport-sedan smoothness. It’s a clean look, with no single feature so overblown to draw attention from the generally pleasing bumper-to-bumper ambience.\n\nDowners on the Azera included some mild assaults on the ears — a little too much road noise bubbling through the undercarriage and a roar of wind through the open sunroof. That latter complaint also has been registered by my auto-reviewing colleagues, so Hyundai engineers might need to tweak the sunroof airflow on future Azeras.\n\nAnd while some of my colleagues were not happy with the fit and finish on their Azeras, I found no problems with my tester.\n\nWith the Azera, it all boils down to what you want. And that’s where it gets tricky.\n\nIf you desire a taste of automotive luxury but do not want to spend $40,000 or more, it’s the proverbial no-brainer. Get the Azera.\n\nBut what if you want a little more horsepower and an ample supply of luxury, comfort and convenience — the kind of package found in a 2006 Chrysler 300C, for example? My guess is that even the Azera’s considerable charms will not lure you away from paying a few thousand more to get the 300C’s 340 horsepower in a 5.7-liter Hemi V-8 engine.\n\nAnd what if you’re eyeing a top-of-the-line, reworked-for-2007 Toyota Camry XLE with a 268-horsepower V-6 and Toyota’s storied reliability for only a few hundred bucks more than an Azera Limited? My call: Test drive them both to decide.\n\nWhatever your preference, the Azera is a highly competitive player in the sedan segment. Given what it offers, with an affordable price and outstanding warranties, it can’t be ignored.\n\nHyundai Azera at a glance Make/model: 2006 Hyundai Azera Limited Vehicle type: Five-passenger, four-door, front-drive, full-size sedan Base price: $26,835 (as tested, $28,335) Engine: 3.8-liter V-6 with 263 horsepower at 6,000 revolutions per minute and 255 foot-pounds of torque at 4,500 rpm EPA fuel economy: 19 miles per gallon city; 28 mpg highway (regular unleaded) Transmission: Five-speed automatic with overdrive Steering: Power-assisted rack and pinion Brakes: Power-assisted, four-wheel discs (vented on front), with anti-lock and other special features Suspension: Independent, double-wishbone on front; independent, multi-link on rear (coil springs and stabilizer bars front and rear) Fuel tank: 19.8 gallons Passenger volume: 106.9 cubic feet Trunk volume: 16.6 cubic feet Curb weight: 3,629 pounds Height: 58.7 inches Length: 192.7 inches Wheelbase: 109.4 inches Width: 72.8 inches Ground clearance: 6.4 inches Track: 62.2 inches on front; 61.6 inches on rear Towing capacity: 2,000 pounds (with specified trailering package) Tires: P235/55VR17 steel-belted radials Final assembly point: Asan, South Korea\n\nAbout the writer: The Bee’s Mark Glover can be reached at (916) 321-1184 or mglover@sacbee.com.",

This year’s Azera gains much-needed USB integration to make its stereo compatible with iPods and other MP3 players. To see what else is new for 2009, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nWith the faster, more luxurious Genesis grabbing headlines at Hyundai these days, some have openly wondered about the future of the brand’s erstwhile flagship. That’s a shame: The Azera delivers the sort of comfort and quality a large sedan ought to offer — and, in typical Hyundai fashion, its price is hard to beat.\n\nIntroduced two years ago to replace the XG 350, the Azera comes in GLS and Limited trims for 2008. Hyundai has discontinued the midlevel Azera SE; click here to see a comparison between the ’07 and ’08 models. I drove an ’08 Limited.\n\nExterior & Styling\nStately but forgettable, the Azera’s styling may be its biggest limiter. It follows Hyundai lineage — I parked next to a newish Sonata, and the Azera seemed, appropriately enough, like a gussied-up version of its midsize sibling. I just question if that’s a good thing: Hyundai’s styling legacy smacks of bulbous takes on whatever Toyota and Honda are churning out. The Genesis shows signs of breaking that mold. The Azera, with its conservative 10-spoke wheels and old-school taillight bar, does not.\n\nOne Cars.com editor found the look agreeable, and it’s worth noting that few competitors hit it out of the park when it comes to styling. Even in this class, though, looks can play a major role — note the Chrysler 300 — and compared to the rest, the Azera blends in a bit too well.\n\nCabin Quality\nConservative styling translates well in the cabin, whose mild contours and high beltline should find few detractors. The dash tries nothing new — it’s the same dome-and-shelf routine that’s been around since the early 1990s — but it’s agreeable in a way the Toyota Avalon’s airport-hanger dash isn’t.\n\nOverall quality rivals an Avalon or Buick Lucerne, which is to say it’s premium but not quite at luxury-car levels. Dashboard panels fit tightly and feel soft to the touch, and most controls — save the navigation system’s, which I’ll get to later — click and turn with solid precision. I’m still a sucker for electroluminescent gauges, and the blue and white ones in the Limited look Lexus-sharp. (Conventional gauges go in the Azera GLS. Bah.)\n\nThe faux wood and imitation metal trim are sparing enough to provide an appropriate touch, though I’d like to see chrome door handles instead of the Azera’s silver plastic ones. I’d also like to see Hyundai swap the Elantra-grade window switches for some of the well-tailored ones in the Genesis. On par with such luxury ilk is the 605-watt, 12-speaker Infinity stereo. It’s optional on the Limited, and in my test car it cranked out rich, high-fidelity audio. Alas, it doesn’t have an auxiliary input jack for portable MP3 players, something most cars these days have. Hyundai spokesman Miles Johnson told me the ’09 Azera will offer a full USB hookup for iPods and the like.\n\nNew for 2008 is an optional navigation system supplied by electronics maker LG. It’s the same one offered in the Santa Fe and Veracruz SUVs; the one in the ’09 Sonata is a separate system, of which you can read my impressions here. The LG unit doesn’t feel as slick: Its buttons flex and wriggle in a way the climate controls don’t, and usability is so-so. The zoom-in/zoom-out controls are physical buttons rather than onscreen ones, and there are clever functions like a route preview screen with turn-by-turn directions. I’d trade both for some other features that are lacking, such as an intersection finder that lets you input the city, more street names on the map and a screen that’s angled steeper so sunlight doesn’t wash it out so easily. I can’t argue with the price, however. The LG unit comes packaged with the 605-watt stereo for a very reasonable $1,750; navigation alone costs around $2,000 on the Lucerne, Avalon and Taurus.\n\nSeating & Cargo\nLeather upholstery is optional on the GLS and standard on the Limited. Its concentric stitching looks like it was designed sometime during the Dole campaign — and went out of style about as quickly — but the cushioning does provide excellent long-haul comfort. Power front seats are standard; I found limited rearward travel, and anyone taller than 6 feet will probably sit all the way back. Those whose spouses are much taller or shorter should consider the Limited trim’s Ultimate Package, which adds power-adjustable pedals and a power adjuster for the standard tilt/telescoping steering wheel.\n\nThe backseat’s backrest sits at a snooze-inducing angle. I prefer something more upright, but if you frequently chauffeur kids or in-laws, it might be a godsend. Legroom is a few inches short of the Avalon and most Detroit competitors, but it should be more than enough for most adults. Headroom is competitive and downright roomy. Worth note: The footwells are crowded by a sizeable center hump — odd, given this is a front-wheel-drive car with no hump-requiring driveshaft.\n\nCabin and trunk volume are competitive with the segment, and a 60/40-split folding backseat augments cargo space. Be sure to check out the photos on the right — with the seat folded, the opening has some significant obstructions.\n\nRoominess Compared\n \tCabin volume (cu. ft.)\tTrunk volume (cu. ft.)\tFolding rear seat?\nFord Taurus\t108.0\t21.2\tYes, on all trims\nBuick Lucerne\t108.0\t17.0\tNo\nHyundai Azera\t106.9\t16.6\tYes, on all trims\nToyota Avalon\t106.9\t14.4\tNo\nChrysler 300\t106.6\t15.6\tYes, on all trims\nKia Amanti\t106.0\t15.9\tNo\nChevrolet Impala\t104.5\t18.6\tYes, on some trims\nNissan Maxima\t96.2\t14.2\tYes, on some trims\nSource: Automaker and EPA data for 2008 models, except Maxima, w/o moonroofs or AWD. Maxima figures are for the redesigned 2009 model, which has a standard moonroof.\n\nHow It Drives\nDepending on trim, the Azera gets a 3.3-liter or 3.8-liter V-6. My test car had the latter, whose whisper-silent startup belied its punch around town and on the highway. Passing power is fluid, and acceleration from low speeds can be sprightly.\n\nI say “can be” because it isn’t always. Like many automatics in this class, the Azera’s standard five-speed auto is lazy as all getout. The gated shifter comes with a manual-shift function, but a Sport mode with more aggressive shift patterns would be more helpful. Many automatics offer this. Left to its own devices, the Azera’s transmission stubbornly resists downshifting for more power until long after you need it. It’s a frustrating tendency in a number of situations, from accelerating around a bend to passing on the highway. Third gear offers potent 40-to-60 mph power, but inducing such a shift takes a concerted prod on the gas. The saving grace is midrange torque — the 3.8-liter engine offers plenty — and it means there’s at least adequate power even as the transmission camps out in fourth or fifth gear.\n\nThe 3.8-liter drivetrain returns 17/26 mpg city/highway, which is midway between the Avalon and V-6 Impala and V-8 competitors like the 300C, V-8 Impala and V-8 Lucerne. The 3.3-liter engine earns just 1 mpg more in city driving, so apart from being paired with the cheaper Azera GLS, it doesn’t give much reason not to upgrade.\n\nEngines Compared\n \t3.3-liter V-6\t3.8-liter V-6\nAvailability\tAzera GLS\tAzera Limited\nHorsepower (@ rpm)\t234 @ 6,000\t263 @ 6,000\nTorque (lbs.-ft. @ rpm)\t226 @ 3,500\t257 @ 4,500\nTransmission\tFive-speed auto\tFive-speed auto\nGas mileage (city/highway, mpg)\t18/26\t17/26\nRecommended fuel\tRegular\tRegular\nSource: Automaker and EPA data\n\nRide quality is expectedly smooth, if a bit floaty, and there is plenty of body roll in the corners. I found the cabin suitably quiet at highway speeds, though one editor thought the suspension could get noisy over rough pavement.\n\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes are standard, but like many in this class — the Nissan Maxima is one exception — the pedal feels spongy, and hard braking induces lots of nosedive. Likewise, overall handling puts comfort ahead of sportiness. The steering wheel turns with a light touch yet avoids the over-assisted feel of the Lucerne or 300. On the highway it has a secure on-center feel, and in close quarters it returns a 37.4-foot turning circle, which bests all competitors but the Avalon. Many of them aid such maneuvers with audible parking sensors or a backup camera, though, and the Azera offers neither.\n\nSafety\nEight standard airbags include side-curtain and seat-mounted side-impact airbags for both rows. Despite this panoply, the Azera earned merely Acceptable side-impact scores from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. IIHS awarded Good scores, the highest rating possible, for head and chest protection but lower ratings for pelvis and leg protection, as well as for the car’s structural integrity. Frontal-impact IIHS scores are Good.\n\nOther standard features include antilock brakes, traction control and an electronic stability system. All five seats employ head restraints, and the front ones are active. The outboard rear seats have Latch child-seat anchors, but they’re buried deep in the cushion fold and difficult to access. All three rear positions have top-tether anchors.\n\nFeatures & Pricing\nWithout the destination charge, the Azera GLS starts at $24,600, undercutting all but the Taurus and Impala. It comes better equipped than either one’s base trim, with power front seats, dual-zone automatic climate control, a six-speaker CD stereo and 17-inch alloy wheels. Heated leather seats and a sunroof are optional. Both are standard on the Limited ($28,550), which also has the larger V-6, a power sunshade for rear-seat passengers and a 315-watt Infinity stereo. Beyond that, a slew of options emulates the stuff of genuine luxury cars — among them a power tilt/telescoping steering wheel, a navigation system, power-folding side mirrors, a 605-watt audio system and rain-sensing wipers. Fully loaded, the Azera tops out around $31,500.\n\nAzera in the Market\nFull-size cars are in a tough spot these days. The segment has dropped some 30 percent in sales so far this year, according to J.D. Power data, as buyers flock toward cheaper midsize cars with better mileage and, increasingly, similar luxury features. Caught between the Sonata and Genesis, the Azera seems in a particular bind: The prospect of low-30s mileage may send some buyers toward the Sonata, while leather-trimmed dashboards and rear-wheel-drive performance could send others toward the Genesis. (A Genesis exodus, if you will.)\n\nIt’s a shame, because in between is a fine sedan that’s more refined than the Sonata and more comfortable — if less engaging — than the Genesis. The Azera has a distinct flavor that makes it worth keeping in Hyundai’s lineup. I just hope buyers are willing to give it a try.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nHyundai’s full-size five-seat Azera sedan competes with the Toyota Avalon, Chevrolet Impala and Ford Taurus. The front-drive sedan slots between the brand’s Sonata family sedan and Genesis luxury car.

      "expert_review": "With the faster, more luxurious Genesis grabbing headlines at Hyundai these days, some have openly wondered about the future of the brand’s erstwhile flagship. That’s a shame: The Hyundai Azera delivers the sort of comfort and quality a large sedan ought to offer — and, in typical Hyundai fashion, its price is hard to beat.\n\n\nIntroduced two years ago to replace the XG 350, the Azera comes in GLS and Limited trims for 2008. Hyundai has discontinued the midlevel Azera SE; click here to see a comparison between the ’07 and ’08 models. I drove an ’08 Limited.\n\n \n\nExterior & Styling\nStately but forgettable, the Hyundai Azera’s styling may be its biggest limiter. It follows Hyundai lineage — I parked next to a newish Sonata, and the Azera seemed, appropriately enough, like a gussied-up version of its midsize sibling. I just question if that’s a good thing: Hyundai’s styling legacy smacks of bulbous takes on whatever Toyota and Honda are churning out. The Genesis shows signs of breaking that mold. The Azera, with its conservative 10-spoke wheels and old-school taillight bar, does not.\n\n\nOne Cars.com editor found the look agreeable, and it’s worth noting that few competitors hit it out of the park when it comes to styling. Even in this class, though, looks can play a major role — note the Chrysler 300 — and compared to the rest, the Azera blends in a bit too well.\n\nCabin Quality\nConservative styling translates well in the cabin, whose mild contours and high beltline should find few detractors. The dash tries nothing new — it’s the same dome-and-shelf routine that’s been around since the early 1990s — but it’s agreeable in a way the Toyota Avalon’s airport-hanger dash isn’t.\n\nOverall quality rivals an Avalon or Buick Lucerne, which is to say it’s premium but not quite at luxury-car levels. Dashboard panels fit tightly and feel soft to the touch, and most controls — save the navigation system’s, which I’ll get to later — click and turn with solid precision. I’m still a sucker for electroluminescent gauges, and the blue and white ones in the Limited look Lexus-sharp. (Conventional gauges go in the Azera GLS. Bah.)\n\nThe faux wood and imitation metal trim are sparing enough to provide an appropriate touch, though I’d like to see chrome door handles instead of the Azera’s silver plastic ones. I’d also like to see Hyundai swap the Elantra-grade window switches for some of the well-tailored ones in the Genesis. On par with such luxury ilk is the 605-watt, 12-speaker Infinity stereo. It’s optional on the Limited, and in my test car it cranked out rich, high-fidelity audio. Alas, it doesn’t have an auxiliary input jack for portable MP3 players, something most vehicles these days have. Hyundai spokesman Miles Johnson told me the ’09 Azera will offer a full USB hookup for iPods and the like.\n\nNew for 2008 is an optional navigation system supplied by electronics maker LG. It’s the same one offered in the Santa Fe and Veracruz SUVs; the one in the ’09 Sonata is a separate system, of which you can read my impressions here. The LG unit doesn’t feel as slick: Its buttons flex and wriggle in a way the climate controls don’t, and usability is so-so. The zoom-in/zoom-out controls are physical buttons rather than onscreen ones, and there are clever functions like a route preview screen with turn-by-turn directions. I’d trade both for some other features that are lacking, such as an intersection finder that lets you input the city, more street names on the map and a screen that’s angled steeper so sunlight doesn’t wash it out so easily. I can’t argue with the price, however. The LG unit comes packaged with the 605-watt stereo for a very reasonable $1,750; navigation alone costs around $2,000 on the Lucerne, Avalon and Taurus.\n\nSeating & Cargo\nLeather upholstery is optional on the GLS and standard on the Limited. Its concentric stitching looks like it was designed sometime during the Dole campaign — and went out of style about as quickly — but the cushioning does provide excellent long-haul comfort. Power front seats are standard; I found limited rearward travel, and anyone taller than 6 feet will probably sit all the way back. Those whose spouses are much taller or shorter should consider the Limited trim’s Ultimate Package, which adds power-adjustable pedals and a power adjuster for the standard tilt/telescoping steering wheel.\n\nThe backseat’s backrest sits at a snooze-inducing angle. I prefer something more upright, but if you frequently chauffeur kids or in-laws, it might be a godsend. Legroom is a few inches short of the Avalon and most Detroit competitors, but it should be more than enough for most adults. Headroom is competitive and downright roomy. Worth note: The footwells are crowded by a sizeable center hump — odd, given this is a front-wheel-drive vehicle with no hump-requiring driveshaft.\n\nCabin and trunk volume are competitive with the segment, and a 60/40-split folding backseat augments cargo space. Be sure to check out the photos on the right — with the seat folded, the opening has some significant obstructions.\n\nRoominess Compared\n \tCabin volume (cu. ft.)\tTrunk volume (cu. ft.)\tFolding rear seat?\nFord Taurus\t108.0\t21.2\tYes, on all trims\nBuick Lucerne\t108.0\t17.0\tNo\nHyundai Azera\t106.9\t16.6\tYes, on all trims\nToyota Avalon\t106.9\t14.4\tNo\nChrysler 300\t106.6\t15.6\tYes, on all trims\nKia Amanti\t106.0\t15.9\tNo\nChevrolet Impala\t104.5\t18.6\tYes, on some trims\nNissan Maxima\t96.2\t14.2\tYes, on some trims\nSource: Automaker and EPA data for 2008 models, except Maxima, w/o moonroofs or AWD. Maxima figures are for the redesigned 2009 model, which has a standard moonroof.\n\n \n\nHow It Drives\nDepending on trim, the Hyundai Azera sedan gets a 3.3-liter or 3.8-liter V-6. My test vehicle had the latter, whose whisper-silent startup belied its punch around town and on the highway. Passing power is fluid, and acceleration from low speeds can be sprightly.\n\n\nI say “can be” because it isn’t always. Like many automatics in this class, the Hyundai Azera’s standard five-speed auto is lazy as all getout. The gated shifter comes with a manual-shift function, but a Sport mode with more aggressive shift patterns would be more helpful. Many automatics offer this. Left to its own devices, the Azera’s transmission stubbornly resists downshifting for more power until long after you need it. It’s a frustrating tendency in a number of situations, from accelerating around a bend to passing on the highway. Third gear offers potent 40-to-60 mph power, but inducing such a shift takes a concerted prod on the gas. The saving grace is midrange torque — the 3.8-liter engine offers plenty — and it means there’s at least adequate power even as the transmission camps out in fourth or fifth gear.\n\n\nThe 3.8-liter drivetrain returns 17/26 mpg city/highway, which is midway between the Avalon and V-6 Impala and V-8 competitors like the 300C, V-8 Impala and V-8 Lucerne. The 3.3-liter engine earns just 1 mpg more in city driving, so apart from being paired with the cheaper Azera GLS, it doesn’t give much reason not to upgrade.\n\nEngines Compared\n \t3.3-liter V-6\t3.8-liter V-6\nAvailability\tAzera GLS\tAzera Limited\nHorsepower (@ rpm)\t234 @ 6,000\t263 @ 6,000\nTorque (lbs.-ft. @ rpm)\t226 @ 3,500\t257 @ 4,500\nTransmission\tFive-speed auto\tFive-speed auto\nGas mileage (city/highway, mpg)\t18/26\t17/26\nRecommended fuel\tRegular\tRegular\nSource: Automaker and EPA data\n\n \n\nRide quality is expectedly smooth, if a bit floaty, and there is plenty of body roll in the corners. I found the cabin suitably quiet at highway speeds, though one editor thought the suspension could get noisy over rough pavement.\n\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes are standard, but like many in this class — the Nissan Maxima is one exception — the pedal feels spongy, and hard braking induces lots of nosedive. Likewise, overall handling puts comfort ahead of sportiness. The steering wheel turns with a light touch yet avoids the over-assisted feel of the Lucerne or 300. On the highway it has a secure on-center feel, and in close quarters it returns a 37.4-foot turning circle, which bests all competitors but the Avalon. Many of them aid such maneuvers with audible parking sensors or a backup camera, though, and the Azera offers neither.\n\n \n\nSafety\nEight standard airbags include side-curtain and seat-mounted side-impact airbags for both rows. Despite this panoply, the Azera earned merely Acceptable side-impact scores from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. IIHS awarded Good scores, the highest rating possible, for head and chest protection but lower ratings for pelvis and leg protection, as well as for the car’s structural integrity. Frontal-impact IIHS scores are Good.\n\nOther standard features include antilock brakes, traction control and an electronic stability system. All five seats employ head restraints, and the front ones are active. The outboard rear seats have Latch child-seat anchors, but they’re buried deep in the cushion fold and difficult to access. All three rear positions have top-tether anchors.\n\nFeatures & Pricing\nWithout the destination charge, the Hyundai Azera GLS starts at $24,600, undercutting all but the Taurus and Impala. It comes better equipped than either one’s base trim, with power front seats, dual-zone automatic climate control, a six-speaker CD stereo and 17-inch alloy wheels. Heated leather seats and a sunroof are optional. Both are standard on the Limited ($28,550), which also has the larger V-6, a power sunshade for rear-seat passengers and a 315-watt Infinity stereo. Beyond that, a slew of options emulates the stuff of genuine luxury vehicles — among them a power tilt/telescoping steering wheel, a navigation system, power-folding side mirrors, a 605-watt audio system and rain-sensing wipers. Fully loaded, the Azera tops out around $31,500.\n\nAzera in the Market\nFull-size body-type cars are in a tough spot these days. The segment has dropped some 30 percent in sales so far this year, according to J.D. Power data, as buyers flock toward cheaper midsize cars with better mileage and, increasingly, similar luxury features. Caught between the Sonata and Genesis, the near-luxury Azera seems in a particular bind: The prospect of low-30s mileage may send some buyers toward the Sonata, while leather-trimmed dashboards and rear-wheel-drive performance could send others toward the luxury-class Genesis. (A Genesis exodus, if you will.)\n\nIt’s a shame, because in between is a fine sedan that’s more refined than the Sonata and more comfortable — if less engaging — than the Genesis. The Hyundai Azera has a distinct flavor that makes it worth keeping in Hyundai’s lineup. I just hope buyers are willing to give it a try.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "Azera marks Hyundai’s first foray into the luxury arena with a value-priced sedan loaded to the gills with plush features and electronic gear. One thing is instantly clear: This is a traditional car for older drivers, with a soft ride and conservative styling. High on comfort but short on panache. Don’t expect anything sporty because it’s just not there. Azera seems to take the old-school view of no-nonsense U.S. drivers who want to be cradled in their luxury rides. But the latest products from domestic and Japanese brands are taking the opposite tack, putting a stronger emphasis on firm suspensions and handling performance, even for the cushiest luxury sedans. But the new Hyundai exudes the same aura of refinement as the best of them, highlighted by an exceptionally smooth and potent V-6 engine. Some might blink at a Hyundai costing nearly $27,000, even though the South Korean long ago shed its image as the maker of disposable econoboxes. Hyundai is now a full-fledged car company with a decent range of cars, SUVs and a minivan. Hyundai’s new flagship takes aim at midluxury sedans from such brands as Buick, Mercury and Toyota. As usual, the South Korean offers the goods at a reasonable price, considering the full cadre of features. Matter of fact, the Limited test car came absolutely loaded without a single option, not even a charge for shipping, leaving nothing extra to push the price above the $26,835 base. A good value, but Azera would do well to drop the pillow-soft ride of yesterday’s sedans for the sharper handling of today’s agile family cars.\n\nPERFORMANCE: The all-new 3.8-liter V-6 is a superb engine, delivering a feeling of seamless power with a silky purr. With continuously variable valve timing, double-overhead cams and all-aluminum construction, the 263-horse powerplant is quite impressive at this price range. The five-speed automatic works flawlessly, with a well-integrated manual-shift function.\n\nDRIVABILITY: The suspension does a great job at soaking up the bumps but delivers nothing in the way of road feel or handling precision. Rebound and body sway are poorly controlled. The power steering works well enough, but it’s too light and numb. Overall, a boring car to drive but a comfortable ride for the pampered passengers. There is a full range of desirable electronic gear, including electronic stability control, traction control and anti-lock brakes, all standard.\n\nSTYLING: Not a bad-looking sedan, with a classy appearance and a substantial feel. But the styling follows too closely along the lines of Buick, Honda or Toyota sedans, coming across as too safe and generic. Too bad Hyundai doesn’t heed the lessons offered by the daring, popular designs from Chrysler or Nissan.\n\nINTERIOR: Traditional, in a good way, with a well-tailored feel and attractive design, along with nicely integrated wood and leather trim. But the “electroluminescent” gauges look cheap and tacky compared with the rest of the cabin. Standard safety features abound, including side and side-curtain air bags, front and rear; active head restraints; and seat-belt pre-tensioners.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: If not for the mushy throwback suspension, I’d be all over this latest Hyundai, mainly because it offers so much content, refinement and safety features at the price of an average sedan. Pricing starts at $24,335 for a well-equipped SE model and $2,500 more for the upgraded Limited version.\n\nHyundai Azera Limited\n\nVehicle type: Five-passenger, four-door sedan, front-wheel drive. Engine: 3.8-liter V-6, 263 horsepower at 6,000 rpm, 255 pound-feet torque at 4,500 rpm. Transmission: Five-speed automatic Wheelbase: 109.4 inches. Overall length: 192.7 inches. Curb weight: 3,629 pounds. EPA rating: 19 city, 28 highway.\n\nHighs: Value pricing, engine refinement, loaded with features. Lows: Mushy suspension, numb steering, ugly gauges.\n\nPricing\n\nBase price: $26,835. Price as tested: $26,835.\n\nOPTIONS\n\nThe Limited model comes fully equipped with a load of features, including electronic stability control, traction control, anti-lock brakes, side-curtain air bags, 17-inch alloy wheels, leather and wood trim, power rear sunshade, full-power interior features, automatic headlights, remote locking and audio system with CD and is MP3-compatible.\n\nShipping: No charge.",

And that’s exactly what’s happening to Hyundai’s full-size Azera sedan. Putter around in an Azera for a week and you’ll see what I mean.\n\nThe Azera offers a roomy cabin, value pricing and solid reliability, but it comes with a slew of little annoyances that leave it behind the competition.\n\nThe current-generation Azera dates back to 2006, though it received some visual and mechanical updates this year. It comes in GLS and Limited trims, both with a V-6 engine and front-wheel drive. Compare the trims here, or stack the 2011 Azera up against the 2010 model here. A six-speed automatic transmission replaces last year’s five-speed auto, and gas mileage is up about 2 mpg overall. I drove an Azera Limited.\n\nSmiling Styling\n\nChief among the Azera’s styling changes is a wide, upward-creasing front air dam. It gives the car a slack-jawed grinning expression that suggests it’s about to exclaim something — perhaps, “I was inspired by a jack-o’-lantern.” The Genesis Coupe has a similar bumper opening that looks just as goofy. Other updates include new taillights and fog lights, revised headlights with LED accents, new side mirrors and a revised rear bumper.\n\nSeventeen-inch alloy wheels are standard, with a unique design on the Limited. The Limited also gets power-folding side mirrors with integrated turn signals and puddle lamps.\n\nThe Inside\n\nInterior changes for 2011 are minimal; most noticeable is new faux-metal console trim, which has a decent textured finish. Unlike the Toyota Avalon — whose adventurous interior struck out early on and wasn’t rectified until this year — the Azera’s cabin takes few risks. It’s traditional and elegant, and it’s aging just fine.\n\nCloth seats are standard. The optional pleated leather upholstery looks old-school — it emulates the seats in, of all cars, the late Cadillac Catera — but it’s generously cushioned and comfortable for the long haul. Curvy roads will have you bracing against, well, the doors or the center console, as the seats don’t have much lateral support.\n\nBy the numbers, the Azera’s headroom and legroom dimensions beat a slew of competitors — the Ford Taurus, the Avalon and Buick’s LaCrosse and Lucerne — but drivers much over 6 feet tall may want more legroom. I’m 5-foot-11, and I had the seat just an inch shy of all the way back.\n\nLarge sedans mean generous backseats, and the Azera doesn’t disappoint. Adults will have plenty of legroom and headroom, and the seat sits high enough off the ground that their knees won’t perch up in the air. Rear amenities include air conditioning vents and reading lights, but neither those lights nor the front reading lights illuminate automatically when you open the doors. Only the center dome light turns on, which is far too little illumination at night.\n\nThe annoyances persist: The window controls are straight off a mid-decade Hyundai, with one-touch up/down operation only for the driver’s window. The center armrest needs a lot more padding, and the two cupholders ahead of it employ plastic claws that clutch their contents like Freddy Krueger. I bought a sports drink in a ribbed plastic bottle, and Freddy mangled it.\n\nSkip the optional navigation system. The unit, from electronics maker LG (Hyundai has a few other systems, too) includes handy physical map-zoom keys, but its screen is angled upward and is easily washed out in sunlight. The graphics are OK, but the system offers no traffic information or voice commands, and its point-of-interest finder couldn’t find a Radio Shack I soon drove by. (It found several others, an hour’s drive away.) Worse still, the navigation system eliminates the USB port and auxiliary MP3 jack that’s included with the base stereo. No iPods here: You’ll have to settle for the radio or the CD player.\n\nTrunk volume is 16.6 cubic feet, which beats the Avalon (14.4 cubic feet) and LaCrosse (13.3) but falls short of the Lucerne (17.0). If trunk space is what you need, though, the Taurus’ 20.1 cubic feet beats all. A 60/40-split folding backseat is standard in the Azera — something the Lucerne and Avalon lack — but the opening is rather small, and it’s separated by a big ledge from the trunk.\n\nBehind the Wheel\n\nMatched to a new six-speed automatic transmission, the Azera Limited’s 283-horsepower, 3.8-liter V-6 provides plenty of power around town. On the highway, its ample low-end torque makes for easy passing maneuvers. The transmission upshifts smoothly and quickly; squeeze the gas to accelerate, and the transmission kicks down more quickly than last year’s lazy five-speed auto. Still, it’s not the most responsive operator. I took the Azera on some challenging mountain roads, and in a number of situations — particularly coming out of a downhill corner — it bogged down hunting for a gear.\n\nOn such mountain roads, the Azera doesn’t feel overly nose-heavy. But, like the Avalon, it leans hard into corners and changes course with tentative, sloppy motions. Large sedans aren’t known for sharp steering, but they are known for easy steering, and the Azera doesn’t hold up here, either. I blame the power assist. It seems like Hyundai dialed in one constant level that’s too little at low speeds and too much at high speeds. Around parking lots, the wheel feels stiff; on the highway, it feels loose. I suppose it’s about right somewhere in between, but modern variable power-steering assist should make for appropriate assist levels across a range of speeds. Hyundai says the Azera’s is variable, but the car steers like something from the 1990s.\n\nRide comfort in this class ranges from decent to memory-foam soft. The Azera rides comfortably enough, but you notice a lot of minor road imperfections that an Avalon would damp out entirely. (Avalon engineers must have Tempur-Pedic mattresses.) The Azera’s suspension never allows the pavement to jar things, but other cars — including Hyundai’s pricier rear-drive sedan, the Genesis — have it beat.\n\nThe Azera GLS gets a 260-hp, 3.3-liter V-6, also with a six-speed automatic. Thanks to improved airflow, the 3.3-liter V-6 is up 26 hp versus last year, while the 3.8-liter is up 20 hp. Combined EPA gas mileage is 23 mpg for the 3.3-liter GLS and 22 mpg for the 3.8-liter Limited — both a 2 mpg increase over last year’s drivetrains and competitive with the segment.\n\nSafety, Reliability & Features\n\nIn crash tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the Azera earned the top score, Good, in frontal crashes. The sedan received Acceptable grades in rear- and side-impact evaluations. It hasn’t undergone the IIHS’ roof-crush tests or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s revamped 2011 crash tests.\n\nAcceptable IIHS results may sound fine, but in a field where most competitors score Good, it comes as a disappointment. Standard safety features include an electronic stability system, eight airbags and antilock brakes. Click here for a full list.\n\nReliability for the Azera has been excellent, and Hyundai’s standard warranties — five years of comprehensive coverage and 10 years on the powertrain — are among the industry’s best. Typical for the brand, the Azera is priced to sell. With a starting price just over $25,000, it competes with the Taurus and LaCrosse but outplays both on standard features. The well-equipped Avalon, meanwhile, has ballooned to more than $30,000 to start.\n\nStandard features on the Azera GLS include power front seats, dual-zone automatic climate control and a CD stereo with USB/iPod integration. For almost $5,000 more, the Limited adds heated leather upholstery and a moonroof (both are optional on the GLS), plus a power rear sunshade, a power tilt/telescoping steering wheel, power-folding mirrors and the larger V-6 engine. A navigation system is optional, but a few features offered elsewhere in this league — cooled front seats, heated rear seats or any sort of rear parking assist — are unavailable.\n\nAzera in the Market\n\nDespite its updates, the Azera has curried little popularity. Hyundai sold fewer than 2,500 of them in the 2010 calendar year through September. That’s down 17 percent from 2009, and it’s a flyspeck in this segment: Toyota sold nearly nine times as many Avalons in that same time frame, and Ford parted with 22 times as many Tauruses.\n\nOf some consolation to Hyundai should be the fact that the hotshot new Sonata and well-appointed Genesis sedans have probably drawn a lot of would-be Azera buyers. The car offers a lot of relative value, but it needed a more serious makeover than it got, and the competition has moved ahead. Hyundai need not Whig out — the Sonata is selling at breakneck pace, after all — but it does have some work to do on the Azera.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",
