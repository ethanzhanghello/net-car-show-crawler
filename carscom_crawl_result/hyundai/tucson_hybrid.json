      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Hyundai Tucson?\n\nThe 2023 Hyundai Tucson is a five-seat compact SUV that competes with the likes of the Chevrolet Equinox, Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4 and Kia Sportage. Powering the base Tucson is an efficient 187-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder that’s paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission. Front- and all-wheel drive are available. If electrification is your thing, consider the fuel-sipping hybrid and plug-in hybrid variants. Each delivers a significant boost in mpg, and the Tucson PHEV has the added bonus of 32 miles of electric-only driving range. Both hybrids are also notably peppier than the regular gas-engine Tucson: They’re powered by a turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder powertrain that helps make 226 hp combined in the hybrid and 261 hp combined in the plug-in hybrid.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Hyundai Tucson?\n\nSave some reshuffling of features among trim levels, the Hyundai Tucson is a carryover model that enters the 2023 model year with no major changes.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Hyundai Tucson Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n8-inch touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nAdaptive cruise control\nBlind spot warning system\nRear cross-traffic alert\nDriver drowsiness monitor\nBluetooth\nTwo USB ports\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nLane-centering steering system\nLane departure warning\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n25-inch infotainment screen\nPanoramic moonroof\nLeather seating surfaces\nHands-free power liftgate\nSatellite radio\nSurround-view parking camera\nRoof rack\nHeated front seats\nDual-zone climate control\nDigital gauge cluster\nWireless device charging\nShould I Buy the 2023 Hyundai Tucson?\n\nBig on value and generous when it comes to standard comfort and safety features, the Tucson is best enjoyed in its lower trims. Scaling to pricier trims means dealing with frustrating touch-sensitive controls and the loss of wireless smartphone connectivity (though that also means a larger 10.25-inch screen). The hybrid and PHEV variants are compelling options for anyone who wants the passenger space and cargo volume of an SUV but prefers to make fewer visits to gas stations.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The redesigned 2022 Hyundai Tucson is a value-oriented compact SUV with promising refinement, but higher trim levels swap in cumbersome touch-sensitive controls — a deal breaker that should keep any well-optioned example off your list.\n\nVersus the competition: Minus those miserable controls, the Tucson is otherwise a lot of car for the money, with above-average drivability and a roomy cabin to boot.\n\nThe Tucson comes with a gasoline four-cylinder engine and front- or all-wheel drive; Hyundai also offers hybrid and plug-in hybrid drivetrains, both with AWD exclusively. Nine trim levels span the three powertrains, with prices for the gas-only and hybrid ranging from a little over $26,000 to around $39,000; Hyundai had yet to issue pricing for the plug-in hybrid as of publication. We evaluated two well-equipped test cars, one gas-only and the other a hybrid.\n\nRelated: 2022 Hyundai Tucson: What Do the SE, SEL, N Line and Limited Cost?\n\nFirst Things First\n\nI’ll get to the Tucson’s overall merits in a bit, but the elephant in the room must come first: Higher trim levels of the Tucson adopt touch-sensitive dashboard controls in place of physical buttons for all manner of things — volume, tuning, multimedia shortcut keys, nearly all the climate controls. We’re seldom this dismissive of a car outright, but these buttons are fussy to use all the time, constantly diverting your attention from the road to determine where your finger lands. We aren’t the only ones put off by the controls; leading consumer surveys also indicate owners want physical controls. (I also reject the notion that the irritation subsides over time. Touch-sensitive controls afflict appliances in my home, too — three space heaters and a range hood. I’ve had them for years, and they’re just as insipid today.)\n\nLower Tucson trim levels, on the other hand, have physical volume and tuning thumbwheels, as well as physical — albeit manual — climate controls. Most climate controls become touch-sensitive in the Tucson Hybrid, and by the time you get to the top trim level of either model, the whole thing’s a single blasted touch panel. Unless you’re a glutton for irritation, avoid these versions entirely.\n\nWhat About Lower Trims?\n\nOther than its top trim levels, the Tucson holds potential. Aside from the touch panel, other controls operate with precision and heft, though Hyundai’s push-button gear selector is less intuitive than a conventional gearshift. Lower trim levels get an 8-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, both wireless, while higher trims have a 10.25-inch unit with wired integration. (Hyundai has a recurring problem with its plus-sized touchscreens lacking wireless smartphone integration; here, as elsewhere, the base screen is functionally superior.) Lower trims pair the touchscreen with conventional gauges, while mid-level and higher editions swap in a crisp digital gauge panel, also 10.25 inches (measured diagonally).\n\nCabin materials are competitive with the class, with an open, layered design and mostly attractive textures throughout. The exception is the rear doors, where Hyundai seems to have pinched some pennies. The new driver’s seat is a commanding perch when fully raised, though owners who prefer to sit farther forward might find the center console clips inboard knee space at that elevation. Backseat legroom is good, but headroom in both rows is merely adequate with the available panoramic moonroof, which both our test cars had. Without the roof, Hyundai says headroom gains 0.5 inch in back and 2 inches up front — both much needed.\n\nOur independent testing of cargo space measured 21.46 cubic feet of volume behind the conventional Tucson’s backseat and 21.66 cubic feet in the Tucson Hybrid. The hybrid ranks a touch higher than the space we measured in the Honda CR-V Hybrid (19.61 cubic feet) and Toyota RAV4 Hybrid (20.69), while the gas-only model substantially beats the Subaru Forester (18.17), Mazda CX-5 (17.91) and Nissan Rogue (17.12). That’s impressive.\n\nWe have yet to test the Tucson Plug-in Hybrid, but it lacks the dual-level cargo floor you get in the other two versions, so it’s likely to have considerably less volume. By Hyundai’s own specs, cargo volume behind the plug-in’s backseat is some 20% less than in the Tucson Hybrid.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nBody motion in both the hybrid and gas-only models seems reasonably controlled, with minimal bounciness after rapid elevation changes or recessed sewer covers, though there’s some lateral movement over mid-corner bumps. Impact harshness is muted enough overall, even with the 19-inch wheels and low-profile tires on both our test cars. Lower trims have 17-inch wheels and higher-profile tires that may make them even softer, but we didn’t evaluate one.\n\nGas-only models pair a naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine (187 hp) with an eight-speed automatic transmission. The eight-speed’s tendency to upshift early and often can leave you wanting more power during low-speed acceleration; instead you’re often a gear too high and a thousand rpm too low. The transmission becomes a serviceable companion above that, downshifting with minimal delay if you need to accelerate at highway speeds. Pushed to higher rpm, the engine serves up adequate, if noisy, power.\n\nSteering feedback is lackluster, but it improves notably with a driver-selectable Sport mode that dials back power assist. Body roll is limited throughout, but overall balance feels as nose-heavy as any front-drive-based compact SUV. The Tucson Hybrid improves on balance, with enough to eliminate most of the gas-only model’s chronic understeer — a palpable result of its battery pack adding much-needed weight around the rear axle. As such, roadholding improves enough to make the hybrid SUV downright fun to throw around corners.\n\nThe Tucson Hybrid’s drivetrain is sometimes fun. It pairs a pint-sized, turbocharged four-cylinder engine with a small electric motor for a combined 226 hp, and the combination makes for swift, linear power when both are in play. (The linearity comes thanks to a conventional six-speed automatic transmission, not the continuously variable style that most hybrids employ.) Unfortunately, such spurts are rare in daily driving, where the Tucson Hybrid minimizes engine power as much as possible. Under mostly electric power, with a periodic dollop of engine, the Tucson Hybrid feels tentative, even gutless. If you lead-foot your way around town or always drive in Sport mode, the drivetrain shows its stuff — gas mileage be damned.\n\nThat mileage, by the way, is EPA-rated at 37 to 38 mpg combined — a hefty increase over the regular Tucson’s 26 to 29 mpg, depending on driveline. That’s roughly competitive with other compact hybrid SUVs.\n\nThe Tucson Plug-in Hybrid teams the turbo engine with a higher-powered electric motor, the six-speed automatic and a higher-capacity battery pack. The drivetrain combines for a Hyundai-estimated 261 hp and 32 miles of all-electric range, making the PHEV the lineup’s quickest, most efficient variant — on paper. We haven’t evaluated it yet, nor has the EPA published its own ratings.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2022 Hyundai Tucson Widens Appeal With Plug-In, N Line Models\nHyundai Tucson N Line Stays in Line With Sporty-Styled Siblings\nIs the 2021 Hyundai Santa Fe a Good Car? 5 Pros and 4 Cons\nHow Much Does the 2021 Hyundai Santa Fe Cost?\nSafety and Driver-Assist Tech\n\nWith easy-access Latch anchors and a roomy enough second row to fit even our bulky rear-facing car seats, the Tucson passed Cars.com’s Car Seat Check with flying colors. The Tucson also earned Top Safety Pick Plus status from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety thanks to top scores in all six crashworthiness categories, plus well-rated headlights and forward automatic emergency braking. Forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking and pedestrian detection is standard; a cyclist-detection function is optional. \n\nThe owner’s manual stipulates automatic emergency braking in the Tucson can function only at speeds up to 37 mph — well below the operating threshold offered by most competitors’ AEB systems. This isn’t the first time a car from Hyundai or its Kia affiliate has imposed such low limits, but it’s an apparent disadvantage nonetheless. (We did not test the system, and IIHS’ field tests on automatic braking max out at 25 mph.)\n\nHyundai’s Lane Following Assist, a lane-centering steering system, is standard. Higher trim levels get stop-and-go adaptive cruise control with Highway Driving Assist, which adds enhanced capabilities on limited-access highways.\n\nShould You Buy a Tucson?\n\nAnyone considering higher trim levels of the 2022 Tucson will need to make peace with the SUV’s fussy touch-sensitive controls and consider parting with close to $40,000. (Or you could look elsewhere; plenty of other compact SUVs merge feature-rich interiors with physical buttons and knobs. This ain’t rocket science.) Fortunately, lower trims have the double benefit of strong value — the SUV starts at $26,135 with destination, undercutting the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4, and bringing Hyundai’s excellent warranty and class-leading free maintenance to boot — plus physical controls and better smartphone integration. Less is more: If any Tucsons are worth considering, it’s these.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Minor changes to the hybrid drivetrain and big changes to the interior make the 2025 Hyundai Tucson one of the smarter and more stylish entries in the hyper-competitive compact SUV class.\n\nVersus the competition: While the Tucson’s base gas powertrain offers performance that’s par for the course in the segment, the hybrid model is noticeably less efficient than some of its competitors, though the Tucson’s traditional six-speed automatic transmission makes for a quieter and more traditional drive.\n\nHow does the 2025 Hyundai Tucson drive? You tell me — if you’ve driven almost any variant of a model-year 2022-24 Tucson, it’s going to be nearly identical in mechanical operation and sensation to the refreshed 2025 version. Other than some moderate changes to the popular hybrid and plug-in hybrid variants, the chassis, base powertrain and all behind-the-curtain mechanicals are the same as they were in prior years. Hey, you won’t hear any of us at Cars.com complaining; we liked (most of) it before, so we’re bound to like it again.\n\nRelated: 2025 Hyundai Tucson Fixes the Biggest Problem in Its Interior\n\n2025 Hyundai Tucson XRT, rear angle | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\n\nAnd … surprise! It’s still one of the best in the class. I drove the new Tucson Hybrid during an excursion into Southern California’s dusty, winey and very trendy Santa Ynez Valley, where Hyundai organized a circuitous on-road route punctuated by loops in the gas-only Tucson XRT over some cow-infested ranch roads. (Per our ethics policy, Cars.com pays for its own travel and lodging when attending such manufacturer-sponsored events.) \n\nHybrid Huddle\n\nThe core of the hybrid powertrain is unchanged, utilizing the same turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine as before. A juicier 47.7-kilowatt electric motor adds some extra zap to the mix, and total system output is up slightly to 231 horsepower and 271 pounds-feet of torque — 5 extra ponies and 13 additional pounds-feet over the prior model. So, not much additional “go,” but more motor output allows the SUV to operate on electric power longer and more often, and you’d think that would improve overall efficiency. Not so; the updated model’s EPA-estimated 35 mpg combined rating is 2 mpg lower than before for the SEL, N Line and Limited trim levels with the base Blue trim clocking the same 38 mpg combined as before.\n\nWithout a prior hybrid on hand for direct comparison, it’s tough to determine just how much the motor updates have improved the driving experience, but the Tucson Hybrid remains a quiet, easy-driving compact SUV in every respect. Unlike most continuously-variable-automatic-backed entries in the class, the Hyundai retains a traditional six-speed automatic transmission that goes a long, long way in reducing the rubber-band power delivery effect and the aural thrash ‘n’ gnash that often plagues CVT powertrains. The powertrain is so smooth and innocuous, in fact, both my drive partner and I had to double-check the gauge readout for the battery charge indicator to confirm that this was, indeed, the hybrid model. Power and acceleration is solid, too, offering more than enough motivation for on-ramps, careful passing and a car loaded up with friends and fam.\n\n2025 Hyundai Tucson XRT | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\nSmooth Sailing\n\nEverything else is similarly dandy. Brake blend — the balance between purely regenerative resistance and the physical brakes — is well tuned, and the three levels of off-throttle resistance is a neat pseudo-EV function that is both genuinely useful and a nice bit of surprise-and-delight kit. Steering is segment-standard light and artificial, and it has well-tuned accelerator mapping and shift logic. All of this is to say it drives unremarkably nice. It will serve you exactly as you expect it to, and will (hopefully) be a reliable slab of thrifty daily transportation.\n\nSoft-Road Hero\n\nBut wait! There’s (a little) more. You might notice the Tucson pictured in the very lovely photos (oh, stop it!) is fairly dusty and posed in a rustic environ. You’re looking at the updated XRT trim, which is aimed at attracting those elusive active lifestylers who ostensibly cram their Tucson full of tents, bikes, kayaks, rucksacks, firewood and freeze-dried trail food.\n\nA Subaru Forester Wilderness competitor this is not. Other than a set of handsome trim-specific wheels, requisite XRT badging and tweaked cladding is most of the difference you’ll find when compared to other trims. I think it’s the best looking of the bunch (and I always love an all-terrain package regardless of platform). I also love unrestricted access to a dirt two-track, which was the only setting I got to pilot the XRT. This was a low-to-medium-speed affair, which confirmed the carryover naturally aspirated 2.5-liter four-cylinder’s solid noise and vibration isolation, but little else.\n\n2025 Hyundai Tucson XRT, profile | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\n\nThe 2-ish-mile trail was hardly challenging, but featured enough elevation changes and tight turns that I certainly wouldn’t attempt it in something without at least all-wheel drive and normal crossover ride height. I never engaged the XRT’s differential toggle or descent control, but it’s genuinely capable enough for reaching remote campgrounds and trailheads.\n\nAs you might’ve guessed, much of the changes are relegated to exterior styling and interior packaging. I’m not going to delve into the exterior changes (that’s subjective and fairly obvious), but I admittedly dig the new trucky front end. The inside sees the biggest changes, incorporating a number of features already found in other new Hyundais.\n\nMore From Cars.com: \n\n2025 Hyundai Tucson Up Close: Targeted Changes Add Up in a Big Way\nToyota RAV4 Prime and Hyundai Tucson Plug-in Hybrid: Tested\nImproved 2025 Hyundai Tucson Pricing Starts at $29,750\n2024 Hyundai Tucson Regains IIHS Top Safety Pick+ Award\nShop for a 2025 Hyundai Tucson\nExcellent Ergonomics\n\nOn my Tucson Hybrid test vehicle, the curved dash display combo of a 12.3-inch driver and 12.3-inch center infotainment display was the centerpiece improvement. Highly configurable and reactive, it may serve as a strong selling point for cross-shoppers, and it’s just as usable and satisfying as it is in Hyundai’s Santa Fe and Sonata. The Tucson’s touchscreen infotainment system also incorporates standard wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, finally gaining wireless support for its large screen.\n\n2025 Hyundai Tucson XRT, center stack display | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\n\nI’m also a fan of the new three-spoke steering-wheel design, which is satisfying to both grip and behold with the automaker’s trademark dot-dot-dot-dot motif on the horn button that’s “H” in morse code. A column-mounted gear selector is shared with Ioniq models and the new Santa Fe, and it cleans up the center console where you’ll find a large wireless charging pad on most trims and two sizable cupholders.\n\nThere’s a new climate-control panel below the center touchscreen that’s both striking to look at and easy to use. The floating center console allows for a significant amount of storage underneath, complemented by a shelf area inset above the glove box on the passenger’s side. Hyundai consistently creates tidy, ergonomic interiors with plenty of space, and the 2025 Tucson is one of the more interesting and engaging interiors in the class.\n\nThat’s all I got. If you liked it before, there’s only more to enjoy for the 2025 model-year refresh, and the combination of the available curved display and wireless phone projection should cinch the deal for many a buyer. And considering the pricing increase is modest — just $775 extra for the base gas-only SE, which starts at $29,750 (all prices include destination), and $560 extra for the entry-level hybrid Blue that starts at $34,510 — you won’t be priced out if the 2024 Tucson was in your sights.\n\n2025 Hyundai Tucson XRT, wheel | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Key Points\nThe 2026 Hyundai Tucson starts at $30,800 (all prices include $1,600 destination charge).\nGas-powered variants now have a greater towing capacity.\nA new entry-level Blue SE trim lowers the Tucson Hybrid’s base price by $1,160.\nThe Tucson Plug-in Hybrid boasted 32 miles of all-electric range.\n\nHyundai treated the Tucson to a thorough refresh for the 2025 model year, with an upgraded interior that ditched the frustrating capacitive-touch controls for secondary systems like the stereo and heating and cooling, as well as adding standard wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto across the line (previously, wireless connectivity had been standard on the entry-level trims, but not on the higher-spec trims). For 2026, Hyundai limited itself to shuffling the compact SUV’s content and adding only a few relatively minor features.\n\nA new Blue SE trim lowers the price of entry for the hybrid Tucson, the gas model’s towing capacity increases to 2,750 pounds, and the adventure-oriented XRT trim gains Terrain Mode settings that optimize various systems for driving in mud, snow and sand.\n\nRelated: 2025 Hyundai Tucson Review: Smart, Subtle Changes\n\nRelease Date and Pricing\n\nThe gas-only 2026 Hyundai Tucson is on sale now; the hybrid and plug-in hybrid will arrive at dealers later. Full pricing is as follows:\n\nTucson\nSE: $30,800\nSEL: $32,150\nXRT: $34,825\nSEL Premium: $35,150\nLimited: $40,775\nTucson Hybrid\nBlue SE: $33,800\nSEL: $35,250\nSEL Convenience: $36,250\nLimited: $43,425\nTucson Plug-in Hybrid\nSEL: $41,675\nLimited: $49,900\nTrim Levels\n\nBoth the regular Tucson SE and hybrid Blue SE include keyless entry and start, 17-inch wheels and LED front lighting. Interior features include cloth upholstery, manually adjustable front seats, six speakers and a 12.3-inch touchscreen with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Standard safety technologies include forward collision warning with pedestrian and bicyclist detection, automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, lane-centering steering, blind spot monitors, rear cross-traffic alert and a driver-attention monitor.\n\nRegardless of powertrain, all Tucson SELs gain 18-inch wheels, a hands-free power liftgate and heated side mirrors. Their cabins are upgraded with a power-adjustable driver’s seat, heated front seats and dual-zone automatic climate control.\n\nAvailable only on the gas-only Tucson, the XRT trim goes for an off-roady look with black lower-body cladding and exterior trim, black window and roof-pillar trim, a dark-chrome grille and LED taillights. It also features the Terrain Mode drive-mode selector, synthetic leather upholstery and ambient lighting.\n\nThe SEL Premium includes the XRT’s luxury content but forgoes the exterior appearance stuff in favor of a moonroof, navigation with voice control, a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, wireless phone charging and Hyundai’s Digital Key 2, which allows owners to use their smartphone or -watch as a key and to remotely monitor the vehicle. The hybrid SEL Convenience includes most of those features except the voice-controlled navigation, moonroof and Digital Key 2.\n\nThose features are standard on all Limited trims along with 19-inch wheels, a panoramic moonroof and rain-sensing windshield wipers. The Limited also includes genuine leather seating, a power front-passenger seat, ventilated front seats, heated outboard rear seats, a heated steering wheel and an eight-speaker Bose sound system.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Hyundai Tucson?\n\nThe 2024 Hyundai Tucson is a five-seat compact SUV that comes standard with a 187-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine, an eight-speed automatic transmission, and a choice of front- or all-wheel drive. Direct rivals include the Ford Escape, Honda CR-V, Mazda CX-50 and Toyota RAV4. For shoppers interested in significantly better fuel efficiency, the Tucson is also available as a hybrid and plug-in hybrid; the latter delivers an EPA-estimated 33 miles of electric driving range. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Hyundai Tucson?\n\nThe Tucson was redesigned for 2022, but it still receives a few notable updates this year. All Tucsons now come standard with rear side airbags and seat belt reminders for all occupants, and haptic steering-wheel feedback is now included with lane departure steering assist and blind spot warning. A 10.25-inch touchscreen is newly standard on all but the SE and SEL trim levels, and the sporty N-Line trim, previously available only with the gas-only powertrain, is now offered only on the Tucson Hybrid. \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Hyundai Tucson Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\n8-inch touchscreen\nSix-speaker audio system\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nAdaptive cruise control\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nDriver drowsiness monitor\nBluetooth\nTwo USB ports\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nLane departure steering assist\nLane departure warning\n\nAvailable features include: \n\n10.25-inch touchscreen\nPanoramic moonroof\nLeather upholstery\nHands-free power liftgate\nSatellite radio\nSurround-view parking camera\nHeated front seats\nDual-zone climate control\nDigital gauge cluster\nWireless device charging\nRoof rack\nShould I Buy the 2024 Hyundai Tucson?\n\nThe 2024 Hyundai Tucson remains a great choice for SUV shoppers who want lots of value and everyday versatility wrapped in an eye-catching shape — even though the standard four-cylinder engine gets breathless when you ask too much of it. While straight-line speed is meager with the base powertrain, overall fuel economy is respectable. For added performance and even better fuel economy, the hybrid and plug-in hybrid variants are worth considering. Just keep in mind they are thousands of dollars more expensive than a comparable conventional Tucson.",
