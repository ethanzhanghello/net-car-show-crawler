      "expert_review": "The 2022 Hyundai Elantra N is the brand’s first performance sedan, entering the ring against the likes of the Honda Civic Type R, Subaru WRX and Volkswagen Golf R. It’s expected to arrive before the spring, bringing more aggressive styling and performance. Now we know that N badge and extra performance comes with a hefty premium over the standard model: The Elantra N starts at $32,925 for the manual transmission and $34,425 for the automatic transmission (all prices include $1,025 destination).\n\nRelated: 2022 Hyundai Elantra N: Your Move, Honda\n\nBy contrast, the base 2022 Elantra starts at $20,875 and tops out with factory options at $26,625; the Elantra N Line and Elantra Hybrid, meanwhile, both top out at less than $30,000.\n\nWhat’s Different About the Elantra N?\n2022 Hyundai Elantra N | Manufacturer image\n\nUnder the hood is a turbocharged four-cylinder engine that pairs with a six-speed manual transmission for 276 horsepower or an eight-speed automatic with an N Grin Shift feature that offers a temporary boost to 286 hp. The Elantra N is distinct from the Elantra N Line, a 201-hp variant whose performance slots between the regular 147-hp Elantra and Elantra N, and the Elantra Hybrid, an electrified variant with only 139 hp but more torque and better fuel efficiency.\n\nIn addition to the higher power, the Elantra N brings a racier exterior with exclusive features like N badging, 19-inch wheels and wider performance tires.  It also sports a unique rear spoiler and rear diffuser with red accents that signal its performance-centric character.\n\nWhile Hyundai’s other performance compact, the Veloster N, only seats four, the Elantra N offers room for five. It also gets illuminated N sport seats that sit lower than in a stock Elantra. Standard features include a 10.25-inch touchscreen with N-specific menus to let drivers customize performance and sound features. Standard safety tech includes forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning with steering assist and lane centering, blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert, a driver attention monitor, safe exit warning and automatic high beams.\n\nHow Does Its Price Stack Up?\n2022 Hyundai Elantra N | Manufacturer image\n\nWith its significant performance advantages over the base Elantra, it’s not surprising the Elantra N wears a much higher sticker price, but how does it compare against rivals from other brands? Still at a discount, though the others make more power on paper.\n\nHonda’s 306-hp Civic Type R started at $38,910 for 2021, but full details await on a forthcoming 2023 Civic Type R based on the redesigned 2022 Civic. VW just redesigned its Golf, and with it comes a 315-hp Golf R that starts at $44,640. And Subaru’s just-redesigned WRX boasts 271 hp, but pricing remains pending, as do any details on the higher-echelon WRX STI.\n\nThe Elantra will likely stack up as a bargain alternative to a few of those, and we should note that engine output is but one factor in how a car accelerates — much less its overall performance. Stay tuned for more.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nIs the 2021 Hyundai Veloster N a Good Car? 5 Things We Like and 3 Things We Don’t\n2021 Hyundai Veloster N Review: More Fun — for Everyone\nWhich New Cars Have Manual Transmissions?\n2022 Hyundai Tucson, Tucson Hybrid Review: A Touchy Subject\n2022 Hyundai Santa Cruz Review: A Good Kind of Weird\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Hyundai Elantra?\n\nThe Hyundai Elantra is a value-conscious compact sedan available with a choice of three engines. A 147-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder is standard, coupled with a continuously variable automatic transmission. The Elantra Hybrid is motivated by a gas-electric hybrid drivetrain rated at 139 hp and employs a six-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. The performance-themed N Line has a 201-hp, turbo 1.6-liter four-cylinder that’s coupled with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic, and for high-performance enthusiasts, the racy Elantra N gets a 276-hp, turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder (with a choice of six-speed manual or eight-speed dual-clutch automatic transmissions) and a track-tuned chassis.\n\nThe Elantra offers 19 cubic feet of cargo space, according to Cars.com’s cargo measurements. You can see how it scored in our Car Seat Check here. Direct rivals include the Honda Civic, Kia Forte and Toyota Corolla.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Hyundai Elantra?\n\nFor 2023, the Elantra’s SEL Convenience Package adds 17-inch alloy wheels and a 10.3-inch digital gauge display, and — performance fans take note — the N Line is no longer offered with a manual transmission; that’s only available with the top-trim N variant.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Hyundai Elantra Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n8-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nCruise control\nTwo USB ports\nKeyless entry\nAutomatic emergency braking\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nLane departure steering assist\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nLED headlights and taillights\nPower moonroof\nLeather-trimmed seats\nHeated and ventilated front seats\n10.25-inch touchscreen\nNavigation\nWireless device charging\nDual-zone automatic climate control\nDigital instrument panel\nAdaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability\nShould I Buy the 2023 Hyundai Elantra?\n\nThe Elantra is a solid value with an eye-catching exterior you wouldn’t expect in a budget-minded compact sedan. Ride quality is good, and the Elantra’s handling makes it nimble in city traffic. The standard 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine delivers decent pep and refinement. If limiting your use of fuel is a priority, know that the Elantra Hybrid delivers an EPA-estimated 54 mpg in combined city and highway driving. What’s not to like? There are some noticeable penny-pinching materials in the Elantra’s cabin, plus some powertrain lag from the turbo engine in the sportier N Line trim.",

      "expert_review": "Hyundai’s compact Elantra sedan is like the ice cream at Cold Stone, with plenty of mix-ins to tailor it to any taste. In addition to the core SE, SEL and Limited trim levels, Hyundai offers the Elantra in an eco-friendly hybrid variety, as well as two savory flavors, the N Line and extra-spicy Elantra N. Now, pricing has been released for the 2024 Elantra’s hybrid and N versions.\n\nRelated: 2024 Hyundai Elantra Up Close: Hey, We’ve Seen This One\n\nWhat’s New\n\nLike the volume models, the Elantra Hybrid and N get a freshening for the 2024 model year with tweaked front and rear styling and an updated interior. Revised fenders and LED daytime running lights flank a new grille up front, while a busier rear end adds a layered look to Hyundai’s origami styling. Interior enhancements include soft-touch front door panels and new color choices, as well as additional USB-C ports and a wireless charging pad for phones.\n\nPowertrain Specs and MPG\n\nA 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine that’s paired with a 32-kilowatt electric motor and a battery moves the Elantra Hybrid, routing a total of 139 horsepower and 195 pounds-feet of torque through a six-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission to the front wheels. In extreme-eco Blue trim, the Elantra Hybrid gets an EPA-rated 51/58/54 mpg city/highway/combined; with a heavier load of luxury equipment, the Elantra Hybrid Limited drops to 49/52/50 mpg.\n\nShoppers on the other end of the spectrum will be pleased by the Elantra N, in which a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder cranks out 276 hp and 289 pounds-feet of torque. A six-speed manual transmission is standard in the N; an eight-speed dual-clutch automatic is available for an extra $1,500. EPA fuel-economy estimates aren’t yet available for the redesigned N, but they shouldn’t change much from 2023’s figures of 22/31/25 mpg for the manual and 20/30/23 mpg with the eight-speed dual-clutch automatic.\n\nStandard and Available Safety Equipment\n\nHyundai fits its Elantra bookends with slightly different levels of safety equipment. The Hybrid Blue includes standard forward collision warning with pedestrian detection, automatic emergency braking, blind spot monitors, rear cross-traffic alert, lane-centering steering and a driver attention warning. The Elantra N’s standard fitment is the same as the Hybrid Blue’s with the addition of front and rear parking sensors. Upgrading to the Hybrid Limited nets advanced forward collision warning with cyclist detection and intersection assist, adaptive cruise control, and front and rear parking sensors.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2024 Hyundai Elantra Gets Safer, Sleeker\nUpdated 2024 Hyundai Elantra Starts at $22,590\nWhich New Cars Have Manual Transmissions?\n2024 Hyundai Tucson, Elantra Awarded IIHS Top Safety Pick+\nFind Your Next Car\nAvailability and Pricing\n\nThe 2024 Hyundai Elantra Hybrid and Elantra N will go on sale shortly. Pricing (including $1,150 destination fee) is as follows:\n\nHybrid\nBlue: $27,400\nLimited: $30,600\nN Line\nManual: $34,850\nDual-clutch automatic: $36,350\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
