      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in December 2013 about the 2014 Hyundai Equus. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2015, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nUpdated for 2014, the Hyundai Equus gives luxury flagships a run for their money — and at a handsome discount — but its brand remains a mammoth obstacle to its consumer appeal.\n\nHyundai officials point to the enormous cost of launching a separate premium brand as a reason for not doing it, but it’s still a move the automaker could make at some point. If it were to happen today, it would have just two cars: the Equus and the smaller Genesis, both rear-drive luxury sedans. Hyundai keeping them under its own umbrella is a decision with a big downside for the Equus, whose near-$70,000 Ultimate edition — the car we tested — is nearly double the price of a base Genesis. Few buyers have taken the plunge: Since December 2010, when the Equus hit dealerships, just 10,228 shoppers have taken one home. Mercedes-Benz sold nearly as many S-Class sedans in the first 10 months of 2013 alone.\n\nStill, Hyundai tries to stir interest. The Equus gets another update for 2014 (compare it with the 2013 Equus here): minor styling changes, a revamped dashboard, and updates to the chassis and electronics. It’s two steps forward and a half-step back thanks to the loss of a few luxury features that the Equus used to offer. Trim levels include the well-equipped Signature and the optioned-out Ultimate. Compare them here.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe Equus’ 429-horsepower, 5.0-liter V-8 and eight-speed automatic make a decent combo, with short gearing around town and smooth, powerful revving that should satisfy all the onramp charging and left-lane flying you’ll ever need. It doesn’t pin you back in your seat like the turbo V-8s in the Audi A8, Mercedes-Benz S-Class and BMW 7 Series, as Hyundai’s naturally aspirated V-8 makes a comparatively modest 376 pounds-feet of torque. But the Equus’ price is less than six cylinder versions of the BMW and Audi (stack them up here). Compared with those cars, this Hyundai is plenty speedy.\n\nThe drivetrain’s mode selector offers Normal, Sport and — new this year — Snow modes. Normal elicits noticeable accelerator lag from a stop, sure to irk any lead-foot drivers. Sport cleans that up a bit, and it also calls up more immediate transmission kickdown on the highway. It changes firmness for the adaptive suspension, too, though it’s more of a supple-to-normal transition than normal-to-sport. Ride comfort is impressive in Normal, with the sort of damping over bumps that evokes the previous S-Class’ excellent Airmatic suspension. One editor likened the Equus to a sofa on wheels. But it also loses some refinement over bumpy lane changes or cloverleaf expansion joints, as the chassis allows road imperfections to disrupt stability. Our editors agreed it’s an ungainly affair when wheeled hard through a corner, even in Sport mode: precipitous body roll, soupy steering, a tail that refuses to play along. The lone upside was our tester’s Continental ContiProContact tires — P245/45R19s up front and P275/40R19s in back — which hugged the road.\n\nInterior\nCabin materials are good, but a few things from last year — leather stitching across the steering-wheel hub, for example — are gone. Real leather and wood span the top of the dashboard, and cowhide covers the overhead grab handles, too. But the Equus Ultimate gets simulated gauges for 2014 that show some pixilation — an inevitable downside to most digital gauges, which we already noticed here. Hyundai toned down much of last year’s silver plastic trim with a dashboard redesign that adopts classier center controls, but the door handles retain the wretched stuff. C’mon, Hyundai: Real metal is the price of entry here.\n\nBackseat room is abundant, but larger drivers may wish the Equus had more room up front. A thick center console limits hip room, and the seats have modest adjustment range. I’m 6 feet tall, and I sat nearly all the way back.\n\nIt all goes to benefit rear-seat passengers, who have a standard power rear sunshade and heated seats with power recliners. The Equus Ultimate adds cooled rear seats with power lumbar, power-elevating head restraints and power side-window shades. But the curbside rear seat drops last year’s power-deploying ottoman, backseat massager and refrigerated beverage holder — sybaritic extravagances, to be sure, but something many flagship luxury cars have. The same goes for massaging front seats, which are widely available among upper-crust luxury cars. Last year’s Equus had a massaging driver’s seat, but it’s gone for 2014.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nAlso gone is last year’s 8-inch dashboard screen, replaced with a 9.2-inch display; an intuitive knob controller still governs the action. The Equus Ultimate adds the simulated gauges, which span 12.3 inches. It also gets dual 9.2-inch screens behind the front seats, where passengers can catch a movie or operate aspects of the driver’s navigation and multimedia screens — useful when those in back know the destination address, one editor found.\n\nOne miss: The column-mounted button and indicator for the standard heated steering wheel are all but impossible to see, and a redundant gauge indicator disappears after a few seconds. Our test car’s wheel stayed on the last setting it was in, which means if you return on a warmer day, you’ll wonder why the wheel is hot.\n\nCargo & Storage\nTrunk volume is 16.7 cubic feet, which is competitive with other full-size sedans. The Equus lacks a folding backseat and center pass-through — features typically precluded by power rear seats.\n\nSafety\nIn crash tests from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the Equus earned top scores in front, side, roof-strength and rear tests. It’s an IIHS Top Safety Pick, but the agency has yet to subject the car to its more challenging small-overlap frontal impact test (click here for more details) — a requirement for Top Safety Pick Plus status. Blind spot, lane departure and rear cross-traffic alerts are standard.\n\nClick here for a full list of safety features and here for our evaluation of child-safety seat provisions in our Car Seat Check.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe Equus starts around $62,000, including destination charge — more than $10,000 less than the base LS, A8 or 7 Series and some $32,000 less than the cheapest S-Class. You can buy a loaded Equus Ultimate for less than the starting price of all four competitors, which top out well north of $100,000.\n\nHyundai’s flagship has become a bit of a question mark among our editors. Many of us, including me, give the car high marks. But brand matters at this price, and carrying a badge that makes $15,000 economy cars — with a reputation tarnished by last year’s gas-mileage flap (read more about it here) — is the Equus’ top liability. Shoppers ought to consider the Equus against cars below the LS and its ilk, where it thumps the competition on premium features but drives like a bigger, less-athletic rival. Does that create a winning equation for Hyundai? So far, not really.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "Updated for 2014, the Hyundai Equus gives luxury flagships a run for their money — and at a handsome discount — but its brand remains a mammoth obstacle to its consumer appeal.\n\nHyundai officials point to the enormous cost of launching a separate premium brand as a reason for not doing it, but it’s still a move the automaker could make at some point. If it were to happen today, it would have just two cars: the Equus and the smaller Genesis, both rear-drive luxury sedans. Hyundai keeping them under its own umbrella is a decision with a big downside for the Equus, whose near-$70,000 Ultimate edition — the car we tested — is nearly double the price of a base Genesis. Few buyers have taken the plunge: Since December 2010, when the Equus hit dealerships, just 10,228 shoppers have taken one home. Mercedes-Benz sold nearly as many S-Class sedans in the first 10 months of 2013 alone.\n\nStill, Hyundai tries to stir interest. The Hyundai Equus gets another update for 2014 (compare it with the 2013 Equus here): minor styling changes, a revamped dashboard, and updates to the chassis and electronics. It’s two steps forward and a half-step back thanks to the loss of a few luxury features that the Equus used to offer. Trim levels include the well-equipped Hyundai Equus Signature and the optioned-out Ultimate. Compare them here.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe Hyundai Equus’ 429-horsepower, 5.0-liter V-8 and eight-speed automatic make a decent combo, with short gearing around town and smooth, powerful revving that should satisfy all the onramp charging and left-lane flying you’ll ever need. It doesn’t pin you back in your seat like the turbo V-8s in the Audi A8, Mercedes-Benz S-Class and rear-wheel BMW 7 Series, as Hyundai’s naturally aspirated V-8 makes a comparatively modest 376 pounds-feet of torque. But the Hyundai Equus’ price is less than six cylinder versions of the BMW and Audi (stack them up here). Compared with those cars, this Hyundai is plenty speedy.\n\nThe drivetrain’s mode selector offers Normal, Sport and — new this year — Snow modes. Normal elicits noticeable accelerator lag from a stop, sure to irk any lead-foot drivers. Sport cleans that up a bit, and it also calls up more immediate transmission kickdown on the highway. It changes firmness for the adaptive suspension, too, though it’s more of a supple-to-normal transition than normal-to-sport. Ride comfort is impressive in Normal, with the sort of damping over bumps that evokes the previous S-Class’ excellent Airmatic suspension. One editor likened the Equus to a sofa on alloy wheels. But it also loses some refinement over bumpy lane changes or cloverleaf expansion joints, as the chassis allows road imperfections to disrupt stability. Our editors agreed it’s an ungainly affair when wheeled hard through a corner, even in Sport mode: precipitous body roll, soupy steering, a tail that refuses to play along. The lone upside was our tester’s Continental ContiProContact tires — P245/45R19s up front and P275/40R19s in back — which hugged the road.\n\nInterior\nCabin materials are good, but a few things from last year — leather stitching across the steering-wheel hub, for example — are gone. Real leather and wood span the top of the dashboard, and cowhide covers the overhead grab handles, too. But the Hyundai Equus Ultimate gets simulated gauges for 2014 that show some pixilation — an inevitable downside to most digital gauges, which we already noticed here. Hyundai toned down much of last year’s silver plastic trim with a dashboard redesign that adopts classier center controls, but the door handles retain the wretched stuff. C’mon, Hyundai: Real metal is the price of entry here.\n\nBackseat room is abundant, but larger drivers may wish the Equus had more room up front. A thick center console limits hip room, and the seats have modest adjustment range. I’m 6 feet tall, and I sat nearly all the way back.\n\nIt all goes to benefit rear-seat passengers, who have a standard power rear sunshade and heated seats with power recliners. The Equus Ultimate adds cooled rear seats with power lumbar, power-elevating head restraints and power side-window shades. But the curbside rear seat drops last year’s power-deploying ottoman, backseat massager and refrigerated beverage holder — sybaritic extravagances, to be sure, but something many flagship luxury cars have. The same goes for massaging front seats, which are widely available among upper-crust luxury cars. Last year’s Equus had a massaging driver’s seat, but it’s gone for 2014.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nAlso gone is last year’s 8-inch dashboard screen, replaced with a 9.2-inch display; an intuitive knob controller still governs the action. The Equus Ultimate models add the simulated gauges, which span 12.3 inches. It also gets dual 9.2-inch screens behind the front seats, where passengers can catch a movie or operate aspects of the driver’s turn-by-turn navigation and multimedia screens — useful when those in back know the destination address, one editor found.\n\nOne miss: The column-mounted button and indicator for the standard heated steering wheel are all but impossible to see, and a redundant gauge indicator disappears after a few seconds. Our test car’s wheel stayed on the last setting it was in, which means if you return on a warmer day, you’ll wonder why the wheel is hot.\n\nCargo & Storage\nTrunk volume is 16.7 cubic feet, which is competitive with other full-size sedans. The Hyundai Equus lacks a folding backseat and center pass-through — features typically precluded by power rear seats.\n\nSafety\nIn crash tests from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the Hyundai Equus earned top scores in front, side, roof-strength and rear tests. It’s an IIHS Top Safety Pick, but the agency has yet to subject the car to its more challenging small-overlap frontal impact test (click here for more details) — a requirement for Top Safety Pick Plus status. Blind spot, lane departure and rear cross-traffic alerts are standard.\n\nClick here for a full list of safety features and here for our evaluation of child-safety seat provisions in our Car Seat Check.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe Hyundai Equus base price starts around $62,000, including destination charge — more than $10,000 less than the base Lexus LS, all-wheel-drive Audi A8 or rear-wheel-drive BMW 7 Series and some $32,000 less than the cheapest S-Class. You can buy a loaded Equus Ultimate for less than the starting price of all four competitors, which top out well north of $100,000.\n\nHyundai’s flagship has become a bit of a question mark among our editors. Many of us, including me, give the car high marks. But brand matters at this price, and carrying a badge that makes $15,000 economy cars — with a reputation tarnished by last year’s gas-mileage flap — is the Equus’ top liability. Shoppers ought to consider the Hyundai Equus against similar body-type cars below the Lexus and its ilk, where it thumps the competition on premium features but drives like a bigger, less-athletic rival on a long wheelbase. Does that create a winning equation for Hyundai? So far, not really.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

Perhaps it comes as a surprise that there is such a thing … and it’s made by Korean automaker Hyundai.\n\nI recently reviewed the 2012 model, though a 2013 is heading to dealers now. There are no significant changes between the two models. You can compare them here.\n\nImported From Seoul\nThere are two things holding the Equus back from being a success (it sold a scant 362 units in July). The first is that the original design of this car was released in Korea three years ago. That means the interior is a step below what Lexus and Acura are producing today. If the leaps Hyundai has made with its other new products show how much it can progress from one generation to the next, a future Equus will challenge premium automakers.\n\nBut not today. The Korean influence is apparent to American car shoppers. There isn’t just an ashtray up front, there are two in the rear doors as well. Meanwhile, there are two small cupholders in the front but none in any of the four large doors. The cupholders are so small two drinks from Starbucks couldn’t fit next to each other without fear of the tops popping off and my wife’s “extra hot, no foam” latte scalding everyone in the vicinity.\n\nThen there’s the limousine thing. Overseas, the Equus is sold as a car that chauffeurs the affluent. In the U.S., very few luxury car owners ride; they drive. That means the opulent rear digs, even in the base Equus, will likely be wasted.\n\nLuckily, Equus drivers, American or otherwise, are even more pampered than are the passengers in the back.\n\nPerformance\nThat’s because under the hood is an astoundingly powerful 429-hp V-8 engine. A terrific power plant that I first piloted in the 2012 Hyundai Genesis R-Spec, it replaces the 2011 model’s 385-hp V-8. Like the Genesis sedan, the Equus comes only with rear-wheel drive. Most full-size luxury sedans offer optional all-wheel drive.\n\nIt takes no effort to accelerate in the Equus at any speed. Your right foot will never stress, even if you want to peel out from stoplights like a crazed teenager. Also on the plus side, no young whippersnappers in their newfangled (yet retro) muscle cars will expect an Equus to have such brute power.\n\nLuckily, the Equus isn’t a brute in any other sense. When piloted through normal traffic, it cuts through lanes with little trouble. Add just a little pressure to the accelerator pedal, and you can pass that guy texting in the lane next to you. (In fact, you should probably do that in any car you’re driving.) Replacing last year’s six-speed, the new eight-speed transmission smoothly moves up the gears and kicks down quickly, with little jarring when you want some more of those 429 horses. Mileage is rated at 15 mpg in the city and 23 mpg on the highway, which is on par with V-8s in this class.\n\nThe power is commanding, yet the ride is beyond comfortable. Remember, the Equus was originally designed as a limousine meant to transport rear passengers in extreme comfort. The driver may feel disconnected from the road in terms of steering feel, though that isn’t a concern for passengers.\n\nUnfortunately, we’re in the U.S. of A., where drivers generally want more feedback from their cars. The Equus has little, and the steering demanded more attention to keep straight than you’d expect in a car like this.\n\nSo, while a 10-hour road trip would be as comfortable in the Equus as in any other car on the market, drivers might start getting fatigued with all the steering corrections they’d need to make … even if they just stayed in the same lane.\n\nInterior\nDid I mention the interior may be a step behind Lexus? Well, that’s not an overstatement.\n\nToday, automakers are rolling out redesigned and new models faster than ever before. Cadillac’s new XTS full-size sedan just went on sale and has an interior that rivals anything on the road this side of six figures. Not many shoppers would be impressed by the Equus’ dark gray plastic buttons and flimsy-feeling controls after seeing the interior of the XTS … and at a lower starting price, too.\n\nWhile the feel and quality of the materials is my only complaint, it’s a glaring one.\n\nOtherwise, you’re left with an extremely spacious, open cabin with wide, accommodating seats that are heated and cooled up front.\n\nThe backseat is where it’s at, though.\n\nThere’s a ton of legroom. With 38.9 inches of rear legroom, the Equus has more than the Lexus LS 460, at 35.8 inches and is just slightly behind Cadillac’s new V-6-powered XTS, at 40 inches. It falls between those two in terms of front legroom, with 45.1 inches in the Equus versus 43.7 inches and 45.8 inches in the LS and XTS, respectively. The Equus is also priced between the two, roughly $10,000 more than a similarly equipped XTS and $8,000 less than a base LS.\n\nThere is an extended wheelbase version of the LS that brings it to 37.6 inches of rear legroom at an even higher price. You can compare all four here.\n\nAnd the trunk — It’s gigantic, at 16.7 cubic feet. The space is a marvel, but I was most amazed at how deep the trunk opening was. I was able to fit a very large, square box — I bought a new garden hose reel — with no problems. It’s just the sort of bulky item most trunks aren’t able to handle. The XTS and LS both sport even larger trunks, 18 cubic feet, but I’m not sure if that’s a differentiator.\n\nFour golf bags and a significant amount of luggage would easily fit, making a nice weekend getaway for two couples possible in the Equus.\n\nIf you’re more interested in the power than in the size of the Equus, the Infiniti M56 has nearly as much power, with a 420-hp V-8. It gives up just an inch or two of legroom versus the Equus, with a more dynamic driving experience, thanks in part to its being nine inches shorter overall.\n\nFeatures\nOne nice thing about the Equus is it comes well-equipped with no option packages to order. You buy either the base Signature model for $59,900 or the Ultimate for $66,900. Both prices include a $900 destination charge.\n\nBoth come with 19-inch wheels; xenon high-intensity-discharge, auto-leveling headlights; a moonroof; a backup camera; rain-sensing wipers; parking sensors; keyless entry and push-button start; leather seats; a massaging driver seat; a power-adjustable, heated steering wheel; power-reclining rear seats; a suede headliner; a 17-speaker stereo; and an 8-inch touch-screen with navigation.\n\nThe Ultimate adds more equipment for the rear passengers, specifically, the right rear passenger gets a seat that has leg support with built-in massage. Both rear passengers get to enjoy cooled seats, an 8-inch LCD and DVD player, and even a refrigerator in the rear console that replaces the Signature’s middle seat.\n\nSafety\nThe Equus earned a Top Safety Pick designation from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, representing top scores in all crash tests and rollover protection. The Equus has not been crash-tested by the federal government.\n\nThe car comes with a number of standard safety features you can find listed here, as well as advanced safety features, like adaptive cruise control and lane departure warning, standard.\n\nEquus in the Market\nThe Equus is an anomaly in the market, and not necessarily in a good way. It’s a vehicle no one asked for that arrived on U.S. shores already a few years out of date. With new competition leap-frogging already-more-updated models, the Equus simply can’t compete, no matter how terrific the power plant.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "The Equus is a strange animal in that it sounds great on paper, performs well on real-world roads, yet still doesn’t live up to its promise.\n\nHave you ever wanted to pilot a luxury limousine designed for intercontinental tastes and sporting 429 horsepower under the hood, plus every luxury feature you could ask for, at a price tag of under $60,000? Perhaps it comes as a surprise that there is such a thing … and it’s made by Korean automaker Hyundai.\n\nI recently reviewed the 2012 model, though a 2013 is heading to dealers now. There are no significant changes between the two models. You can compare them here.\n\nImported From Seoul\n\nThere are two things holding the Equus back from being a success (it sold a scant 362 units in July). The first is that the original design of this car was released in Korea three years ago. That means the interior is a step below what Lexus and Acura are producing today. If the leaps Hyundai has made with its other new products show how much it can progress from one generation to the next, a future Equus will challenge premium automakers. \n\nBut not today. The Korean influence is apparent to American car shoppers. There isn’t just an ashtray up front, there are two in the rear doors as well. Meanwhile, there are two small cupholders in the front but none in any of the four large doors. The cupholders are so small two drinks from Starbucks couldn’t fit next to each other without fear of the tops popping off and my wife’s “extra hot, no foam” latte scalding everyone in the vicinity. \n\nThen there’s the limousine thing. Overseas, the Equus is sold as a car that chauffeurs the affluent. In the U.S., very few luxury car owners ride; they drive. That means the opulent rear digs, even in the base Equus, will likely be wasted. \n\nLuckily, Equus drivers, American or otherwise, are even more pampered than are the passengers in the back. \n\nPerformance\n\nThat’s because under the hood is an astoundingly powerful 429-hp V-8 engine. A terrific power plant that I first piloted in the 2012 Hyundai Genesis R-Spec, it replaces the 2011 model’s 385-hp V-8. Like the Genesis sedan, the Equus comes only with rear-wheel drive. Most full-size luxury sedans offer optional all-wheel drive. \n\nIt takes no effort to accelerate in the Equus at any speed. Your right foot will never stress, even if you want to peel out from stoplights like a crazed teenager. Also on the plus side, no young whippersnappers in their newfangled (yet retro) muscle cars will expect an Equus to have such brute power. \n\nLuckily, the Equus isn’t a brute in any other sense. When piloted through normal traffic, it cuts through lanes with little trouble. Add just a little pressure to the accelerator pedal, and you can pass that guy texting in the lane next to you. (In fact, you should probably do that in any car you’re driving.) Replacing last year’s six-speed, the new eight-speed transmission smoothly moves up the gears and kicks down quickly, with little jarring when you want some more of those 429 horses. Mileage is rated at 15 mpg in the city and 23 mpg on the highway, which is on par with V-8s in this class.\n\nThe power is commanding, yet the ride is beyond comfortable. Remember, the Equus was originally designed as a limousine meant to transport rear passengers in extreme comfort. The driver may feel disconnected from the road in terms of steering feel, though that isn’t a concern for passengers. \n\nUnfortunately, we’re in the U.S. of A., where drivers generally want more feedback from their cars. The Equus has little, and the steering demanded more attention to keep straight than you’d expect in a car like this. \n\nSo, while a 10-hour road trip would be as comfortable in the Equus as in any other car on the market, drivers might start getting fatigued with all the steering corrections they’d need to make … even if they just stayed in the same lane. \n\nInterior\n\nDid I mention the interior may be a step behind Lexus? Well, that’s not an overstatement. \n\nToday, automakers are rolling out redesigned and new models faster than ever before. Cadillac’s new XTS full-size sedan just went on sale and has an interior that rivals anything on the road this side of six figures. Not many shoppers would be impressed by the Equus’ dark gray plastic buttons and flimsy-feeling controls after seeing the interior of the XTS … and at a lower starting price, too. \n\nWhile the feel and quality of the materials is my only complaint, it’s a glaring one. \n\nOtherwise, you’re left with an extremely spacious, open cabin with wide, accommodating seats that are heated and cooled up front. \n\nThe backseat is where it’s at, though. \n\nThere’s a ton of legroom. With 38.9 inches of rear legroom, the Equus has more than the Lexus LS 460, at 35.8 inches and is just slightly behind Cadillac’s new V-6-powered XTS, at 40 inches. It falls between those two in terms of front legroom, with 45.1 inches in the Equus versus 43.7 inches and 45.8 inches in the LS and XTS, respectively. The Equus is also priced between the two, roughly $10,000 more than a similarly equipped XTS and $8,000 less than a base LS.  \n\nThere is an extended wheelbase version of the LS that brings it to 37.6 inches of rear legroom at an even higher price. You can compare all four here. \n\nAnd the trunk — It’s gigantic, at 16.7 cubic feet. The space is a marvel, but I was most amazed at how deep the trunk opening was. I was able to fit a very large, square box — I bought a new garden hose reel — with no problems. It’s just the sort of bulky item most trunks aren’t able to handle. The XTS and LS both sport even larger trunks, 18 cubic feet, but I’m not sure if that’s a differentiator. \n\nFour golf bags and a significant amount of luggage would easily fit, making a nice weekend getaway for two couples possible in the Equus.  \n\nIf you’re more interested in the power than in the size of the Equus, the Infiniti M56 has nearly as much power, with a 420-hp V-8. It gives up just an inch or two of legroom versus the Equus, with a more dynamic driving experience, thanks in part to its being nine inches shorter overall.\n\nFeatures\n\nOne nice thing about the Equus is it comes well-equipped with no option packages to order. You buy either the base Signature model for $59,900 or the Ultimate for $66,900. Both prices include a $900 destination charge.   \n\nBoth come with 19-inch wheels; xenon high-intensity-discharge, auto-leveling headlights; a moonroof; a backup camera; rain-sensing wipers; parking sensors; keyless entry and push-button start; leather seats; a massaging driver seat; a power-adjustable, heated steering wheel; power-reclining rear seats; a suede headliner; a 17-speaker stereo; and an 8-inch touch-screen with navigation.  \n\nThe Ultimate adds more equipment for the rear passengers, specifically, the right rear passenger gets a seat that has leg support with built-in massage. Both rear passengers get to enjoy cooled seats, an 8-inch LCD and DVD player, and even a refrigerator in the rear console that replaces the Signature’s middle seat. \n\nSafety\n\nThe Equus earned a Top Safety Pick designation from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, representing top scores in all crash tests and rollover protection. The Equus has not been crash-tested by the federal government. \n\nThe car comes with a number of standard safety features you can find listed here, as well as advanced safety features, like adaptive cruise control and lane departure warning, standard. \n\nEquus in the Market \n\nThe Equus is an anomaly in the market, and not necessarily in a good way. It’s a vehicle no one asked for that arrived on U.S. shores already a few years out of date. With new competition leap-frogging already-more-updated models, the Equus simply can’t compete, no matter how terrific the power plant. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "The Equus is arguably Hyundai’s fourth luxury car, following the 2001 XG300/350; its replacement, the 2006 Azera; and the 2009 Genesis sedan — and each has been larger and more luxurious than the preceding one. If the Genesis straddled the line between midsize and full-size luxury sedans, the Equus is squarely in the full-size class, among the BMW 7 Series, Lexus LS 460 and Mercedes-Benz S-Class. For its price, the Equus is amazing. (See it compared.)\n\nThe Equus (pronounced ECK-wiss) is absolutely competitive with flagship luxury sedans from around the world, yet I suspect it will fail to truly compete — for the most superficial, intangible reasons.\n\nThe word “Equus” is Latin for “horse,” and is also a genus that encompasses distinct species, including horses, donkeys and a range of zebras. Even though the Hyundai Equus is as impressive as a Lipizzaner, I predict it will be as common as a zebra, simply because it’s named after a mule.\n\nThe Equus comes in two trim levels: the Signature and the Ultimate. We tested an Ultimate, which for another $6,500 adds to the base model’s extensive standard equipment list a forward-view camera, a power trunklid and a series of backseat upgrades, including a refrigerator and split reclining rear seats that drop the seat count from five to four. (See the two trims compared.) There are otherwise no factory options.\n\nLittle is Missing\n\nIn terms of features and luxury appointments, little is missing from the Equus. It has a standard adjustable-height air suspension and adaptive shock absorbers, features that are optional on some competing models. The gauges are nice and bright, and the LCD screens between the gauges and on the dashboard are high resolution with appealing graphics. The leather is high quality, and the trim includes textured genuine aluminum. Even the multifunction controller knob — which competitors took years to get right — works quite well.\n\nThe 2011’s 4.6-liter V-8 generates 385 horsepower, and though I believe that’s more than adequate, Hyundai has announced that the 2012 model will have a 429-hp, 5.0-liter V-8 now that the updated 2012 Genesis sedan’s higher trim level has adopted the 4.6-liter. The transmission will also change from a six-speed to an eight-speed, which could improve efficiency, though mileage estimates aren’t yet available for the 2012.\n\nThe 2011 Equus’ six-speed was well-behaved, and the car accelerated authoritatively and quietly. With a combined city/highway estimate of 19 mpg on premium gas, the Equus matches the LS 460 and beats the S550 and 750i by 1 and 2 mpg, respectively. One shortcoming is that the Equus comes only with rear-wheel drive, while its German and Japanese rivals offer optional all-wheel drive.\n\nMinor Complaints\n\nMy complaints are relatively few. The biggest one is that the steering needs more power assist at highway speeds; I found it fatiguing to keep the car centered. I’d make the same complaint about a sporty car, but it seems particularly out of character here. Some peculiar wind noise emanates from the moonroof at 60 mph and higher, though a solid shade can be deployed to block it. The Ultimate trim’s front-view camera is quite effective, but unfortunately, in addition to looking awkward when viewed from the outside, it collects the slightest bit of precipitation so effectively you’d think it was designed to do so.\n\nOn the upside, this feature is standard on the Ultimate, which is priced thousands to tens of thousands of dollars lower than some competing models on which the feature’s an option. A similar story: Some competitors’ adaptive cruise control is designed to resume even after a complete stop, while the Equus’ quits at 1 or 2 mph, handing responsibility back to you — but it comes standard.\n\nSafety\n\nThe Equus comes with nine airbags, including side curtains and seat-mounted side-impact airbags for all window seats. Antilock brakes and an electronic stability system are also standard, as are collision and lane departure warning systems. See all the safety features here.\n\nSo What’s the Problem?\n\nIf you’re like me, you’ll find no overall problem with the Equus. I’m so Vulcanlike that I would rave about an excellent car if it came from Yugo. The product is its own entity, and this product is great. Unfortunately, American consumers aren’t Vulcans (though apparently some are Kardashians), and they won’t be flocking to buy a luxury car from Hyundai.\n\nTechnically, Hyundai isn’t the problem. American consumers are finally getting over their decades-old perception of Hyundais as inferior vehicles. Slowly and diligently, the company has added high quality, progressive styling and improved mileage and crash tests to its trademark value and generous warranty. Hyundai is seemingly unstoppable in the U.S. and world markets, and that success is as deserved as was Toyota’s historic ascension decades ago.\n\nSo what’s the problem? Modest brands fail to make a dent with luxury vehicles. BMW, Jaguar and Mercedes-Benz are singular luxury enterprises, and there’s a reason Toyota has Lexus, Volkswagen has Audi, Ford has Lincoln and GM has both Cadillac and Chevrolet. History has proved that luxury cars must come from luxury brands. In our evaluations, we struggle to comprehend and relate what a luxury name brings, and to parse what makes one brand appeal more to one consumer than to another. It’s intangible, unquantifiable and utterly unpredictable, but it’s definitely there, adding value through nothing more than perception and reputation.\n\nHyundai has taken steps to mitigate this with the Equus, mainly through programs whereby you interact with a salesperson at your home, and once you buy a loaner car can be dropped off in exchange for your Equus so it can be brought in for maintenance. The owner might never see the inside of a Hyundai dealership. Sadly, that won’t be enough. The Genesis sedan — despite being the winner of Cars.com’s Best of 2009 award — has sold in modest numbers. As I point out at every opportunity, Hyundai did itself no favors by naming its affordable sports car the Genesis Coupe — different buyer, different price range, different … everything, except the name.\n\nUltimately, the resulting consumer confusion isn’t the main obstacle. It’s the fact that Hyundai is attempting to do what others have failed to do. Selling luxury cars requires a luxury brand, and that calls for a separate distribution channel — no cheap endeavor. As I said of the Genesis sedan, the Hyundai Equus is a great car for buyers who thought they could never afford a car of its ilk. If I were the operator of a car service, I’d order a dozen of the things. But until they’re sold under a luxury name, the Genesis and Equus will both be here, proving what Hyundai is made of and satisfying the Vulcans among us.\n\nSend Joe an email",
