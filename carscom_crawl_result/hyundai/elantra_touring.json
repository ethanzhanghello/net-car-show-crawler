      "expert_review": "CORNWALL, N.Y. — The trouble with love at first sight is that it seldom reveals everything. What is missed in early, tingling moments of infatuation could prove upsetting later when the real work of love becomes . . . work.\n\nConsider the 2009 Hyundai Elantra Touring five-door hatchback (a.k.a. small wagon, essentially the way the Elantra is sold in Europe).\n\nI first met it in Paris in 2008, a place and time where and when it called itself the Hyundai i30.\n\nI was smitten by its narrow waistline and smartly tapered rear end. It seemed the perfect automobile for urban driving, particularly in European cities where narrow streets abound.\n\nI had no chance to drive the Elantra Touring then. But I had dreams.\n\nI again met the pretty hatchback at one of Hyundai’s northeast regional product exhibitions in the United States. It was on display and therefore incapable of much by way of conversation or driving. But I smiled at it. I imagined it returning my visual display of affection. I knew we’d get together someday.\n\nAnd we did have a fast and fleeting encounter. Like a first dance after a long glance, we shared a quick spin. There were no bumps in the road or heavy burdens upon us.\n\nIt left me hoping for more.\n\nAnd so it came that the Elantra Touring was parked in my Northern Virginia driveway on a bright July day, uncommonly cool and dry for the season. Ria Manglapus, my Washington Post assistant for vehicle evaluations, was scheming to drive it, although a 510-horsepower Jaguar XKR coupe was simultaneously available.\n\nRia is no fool. The rear-wheel-drive Jaguar XKR gets 15 miles per gallon in the city and 22 miles per gallon on the highway and requires premium unleaded gasoline. The front-wheel-drive Elantra Touring gets 23 miles per gallon in the city and 31 miles per gallon on the highway running on regular unleaded.\n\nWe both did the math.\n\nI had a long drive ahead of me. I needed a cheap, hopefully fun date. I chose the Elantra Touring.\n\nIt was the wrong choice.\n\nThe Elantra Touring is a nifty, nimble city runner. The more congested the traffic, the better it seems to behave. It can wiggle its way around almost any obstacle in daily urban motoring.\n\nAlso, the little hatchback (officially classified as a “compact”) isn’t as little as it seems. It can hold 65 cubic feet of cargo, as much as many compact sport-utility vehicles.\n\nBut “hold” is not the same as “carry.” Fitting cargo into a vehicle is one thing. The way that vehicle carries cargo is quite another. Think of it as the heavy lifting often required by the work of love. Many relationships collapse under the strain of carrying that load.\n\nAnd so it was with the ill-chosen Elantra Touring, outfitted with a feathery suspension and a 2-liter, 138-horsepower, four-cylinder engine. Loaded with nearly 400 pounds of cargo, it became a right-lane queen on the highway. To say the very least, acceleration was wanting. And that was on straight, flat highways.\n\nUphill travel was miserable. I wheedled, cajoled, pleaded: “C’mon, move!”\n\nBut there was a communications gap. The Elantra Touring apparently never read or heard of Watty Piper’s tale of effort and persistence, “The Little Engine That Could” (a.k.a. “The Pony Engine”).\n\nInstead of responding “Yes, I can!,” the little Elantra Touring engine whined, “Too hard, no way.”\n\nBy the time I arrived at my oldest daughter’s home here, I was ready to call it quits. The perfect city car had turned into a highway bum. It struggled up Mine Hill Road in second gear — the only gear in the hatchback’s five-speed manual transmission that seemed capable of moving it uphill under load.\n\nAnd now, sitting in an upstairs study, forlornly eyeing the Elantra Touring parked on the driveway below, I am writing these words and dreading the return drive to Northern Virginia. It’s going to be a long, silent trip.",

      "expert_review": "Someday in the not so distant future, people will own more cars, not fewer.\n\nThere will be one they drive only on the weekends — the family and boat in tow.\n\nThen there will be a small two-seater that they’ll putt along to work in every day — at least those who still go to an office instead of telecommuting.\n\nThere may be other specialized family vehicles that promote efficiency and have specific purposes — school dropoffs, grocery shopping and Friday-night-out vehicles.\n\nUntil then, something like the 2010 Hyundai Elantra Touring may have to do.\n\nFar from perfect, the Elantra Touring joined the Hyundai family last year as a spinoff of the compact Elantra. In television terms the Elantra would be a successful spinoff, something along the lines of “The Jeffersons” (from “All in the Family”), and not like “After M*A*S*H.”\n\nThe Elantra Touring provides good mileage for daily driving, up to 65.3 cubic feet of space in the back for flexible packing and enough space in the second row to load up three kids for an afternoon of errands. It’s a jack-of-all-trades kind of vehicle.\n\nYou may have to leave the boat home, though, as the little 2-liter four-cylinder engine never felt like it could pull me and a few friends, much less the SS Minnow.\n\nThe 138-horsepower engine, which uses some pretty high tech features, such as dual overhead camshafts and variable valve timing to increase performance, would whine at high rpm when hitting the highway. And I was lucky to be driving the five-speed manual vehicle, as the four-speed automatic is likely to add some engine noise without that fifth gear.\n\nWhen the car only had me in it, it seemed fine. Other than the fast-spinning engine, its performance was good. For a compact car, it still offers a fairly long wheelbase of 106 inches. That helps smooth out the ride, especially in Detroit.\n\nOf course, if you’re expecting a racer, this car isn’t for you. Simply look at it as having more function than a Toyota Corolla, Honda Civic or Ford Focus, because it does. Fun, with zip in city\n\nWhile the engine is far from overpowering, the car was still fun to drive, especially around town; its compact body allowed me to zip through traffic. In the city, its smaller stature means it can squeeze into tighter spaces, and you’ll finally get a chance to try out one of those “compact only” parking spaces without feeling guilty.\n\nThere were some other notables during the week I test drove the Elantra Touring. The heater worked great — which is something many compacts lack. I tested the Elantra Touring during the first cold snap in December and the cabin was warm before I hit the highway on my way to work.\n\nThe mileage numbers of 23 miles per gallon in the city and 31 mpg on the highway sound good at first glance, but really, they’re merely OK. The new Chevy Equinox, which offers a lot more space, bests that highway number and other larger cars do as well.\n\nOf course, those vehicles cost thousands of dollars more. The Elantra Touring starts at under $16,000, making it a strong value for the dollar. Practical comfort\n\nWhile inexpensive, the Elantra Touring doesn’t feel cheap.\n\nThe interior cabin is comfortable with a thoughtful design. There are large swaths of plastic that make up the dash, but the two-tone look breaks up the plastic feel. The center stack on the dash includes the main controls; they’re well laid out and easy to operate. There are also lots of little cubbies to store items such as your cell phone, water bottle and cup of coffee. The crisp blue lighting that illuminates the instruments at night is very easy on the eyes.\n\nThe second row is a little sparser but cozy. Because this is a five-door hatchback, the Elantra Touring feels much more open than the Elantra sedan.\n\nI also liked the exterior of the Elantra Touring more than the sedan version. My test vehicle included the 17-inch wheels (instead of the 15-inchers) and that makes the car look much more dramatic.\n\nOverall, the design is fairly simple, not pretending to be something it isn’t, but instead looks comfortable in its own sheet metal.\n\nThe same could be said for the people who buy the Elantra Touring. They’re comfortable with who they are — accepting the fact they need one car to fill all the roles life has for them.\n\nThe Elantra Touring just makes that task a little easier. And isn’t that what a car is supposed to do, even if it’s the only car you have?\n\nsburgess@detnews.com (313) 223-3217",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe Elantra Touring hatchback is a distinct model in Hyundai’s lineup, with a different appearance than Hyundai’s Elantra sedan. The Touring battles it out with cars like the Toyota Matrix as well as hatchback versions of the Mazda3 and Nissan Versa. A new hatchback Elantra — the Elantra GT — debuts for the 2013 model year.\n\nThe Elantra Touring has a bit of a wagon look to it. Its smooth body sides and traditional cues give it a much more conservative appearance than the Elantra sedan, which received dramatic styling with its redesign for the 2011 model year. Fifteen-inch steel wheels are standard while 16- and 17-inch alloy wheels are optional.\n\nPower comes from a 138-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that works with a five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission. The drivetrain isn’t as efficient as the one in the Elantra sedan, which is rated at 40 mpg on the highway by the EPA.\n\nThere’s room for up to five people in the Elantra Touring. Cargo room behind the rear seats measures 24.3 cubic feet; with the rear seats folded, there’s 65.3 cubic feet. Standard convenience features include air conditioning, power windows and locks, and a USB port for iPod connectivity.",
