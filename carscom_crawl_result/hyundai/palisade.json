      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2020 Hyundai Palisade is a truly special vehicle that brings a formidable mix of value, interior quality and technology — all of which propelled it to a win in our latest three-row SUV Challenge.\n\nAgainst the competition: The Palisade’s competitors have a new benchmark to chase; the Hyundai’s refinement and ride quality stand out from the pack.\n\nWith new SUVs flying at us from all directions these days, it’s easy to become numb to the next one. But every so often, something comes around that feels fresh and brings a jolt of life to the monotony. The latest lightning bolt is the all-new 2020 Hyundai Palisade.\n\nRelated: We Have a Winner: Why the 2020 Hyundai Palisade Is the Best 3-Row SUV\n\nHyundai already makes a three-row SUV, the Santa Fe XL, but that one has snugger dimensions and feels more like a converted two-row SUV than a true three-row (though we are big fans of the two-row Santa Fe). The Palisade slides in above the Santa Fe in Hyundai’s lineup and is better equipped to take on larger competition, which it met in our 3-Row SUV Challenge.\n\nAgainst both new and established vehicles, including the Honda Pilot, Volkswagen Atlas and its close analog the Kia Telluride, the Palisade took home a win. Its only close competition came from the Telluride, which makes sense given the two vehicles share the same powertrain and platform, though each has a unique look and feel. The Palisade also has a few unique features that gave it a small edge over its rival.\n\nFor the SUV comparison, we tested a Palisade in its top Limited trim level that came with all the bells and whistles. The Palisade is offered in three trim levels: SE, SEL and Limited. Our Limited was a prime example of just how far Hyundai has come, with a first-rate interior and technology and ride quality to match.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThere’s only one engine: a 291-horsepower, 3.8-liter V-6 that’s mated to a standard eight-speed automatic transmission. Front-wheel drive is standard on all Palisade trim levels, and all-wheel drive is available as a $1,700 option. (It was equipped on the Limited model I tested.)\n\nThe powertrain is not the most engaging, but it’s responsive enough to stay out of the way. The transmission is a bit eager on upshifts to preserve fuel economy, but it steps down into the proper gear to accelerate with a bit of gentle prodding. However, where the Palisade’s driving experience excels is ride quality, which (again) approaches — if not matches — luxury levels of refinement. Broken pavement, road seams and rough roads pass below you imperceptibly, and the cabin is almost eerily quiet. Its isolation is just about good enough that the Palisade could pass for the SUV that Genesis, Hyundai’s fledgling luxury brand, is missing.\n\nFuel-economy estimates are 19/26/22 mpg city/highway/combined for FWD models and 19/24/21 mpg for models with AWD. In our fuel-economy testing of seven three-row SUVs, the AWD Palisade returned 23.9 mpg in a mix of city and highway driving — close to its highway rating and second only to the Kia Telluride.\n\nLuxury Grade\n\nThe Palisade’s interior is shocking — in a good way. The Limited trim doesn’t only do a good luxury impersonation, there are parts that are straight-up luxury grade, like diamond-quilted stitching on the seats and doors that feel ripped straight off a Mercedes-Benz.\n\nThis extends to the seats themselves, which at least in the first two rows are very comfortable. Limited models are only offered with captain’s chairs, which are also standard on the SEL, though that version can have a bench seat that bumps seating capacity from seven to eight. The front seats are comfortable, perfect for a full day behind the wheel, while the captain’s chairs feature the same diamond stitch pattern and great visibility out the large side windows.\n\nIf the Palisade interior has a weakness, it’s the third row. Materials quality drops off a bit, but the bigger issue is a lack of room; the Palisade is mid-pack in the class. Adult passengers can fit, but it won’t be the most comfortable ride, especially for those on the taller side, because of a lack of expansive headroom. Other, larger competitors, such as the Atlas and Chevrolet Traverse, have friendlier third-row dimensions. The upside of the Palisade’s third row is that it’s power-folding in the Limited and has two USB ports for charging, so it isn’t without its charms.\n\nCargo room is measured at 18.0 cubic feet behind the third row, 45.8 cubic feet behind the second row and 86.4 cubic feet with both rows folded. That’s supplemented by an underfloor storage space behind the third row that’s a good place to store valuables and other items you don’t want to leave in the cargo area. The Palisade ranked second out of seven in our three-row-SUV comparison’s cargo test, which considered space and cargo features in assigning an overall score.\n\nTech You Can Use\n\nThe Palisade comes with a lot of technology baked in. Limited models have a large 10.25-inch touchscreen in the center dashboard and a 12.3-inch digital display in the instrument panel. It comes with all the requisite connectivity features, such as standard Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and Bluetooth. But what I appreciate most about the Hyundai’s multimedia system is its ease of use: It has the right blend of physical controls below the screen as well as volume and tuning knobs. As for what’s on the screen itself, the system has shallow construction, meaning what I was looking for was never more than a button press or two away.\n\nThat philosophy extends to the Palisade’s safety technology. Limited models come standard with a camera-based blind spot monitor. The system uses a pair of cameras, one on each side mirror, to provide a live view of the blind spot on either side of the Palisade when a turn signal is activated. It’s similar to Honda’s LaneWatch system, but with one key difference: The Palisade uses the digital instrument panel instead of the center screen, and it displays a live view on the side of the screen where your eye would naturally fall. It’s the most intuitive application of this technology I’ve seen.\n\nThe Palisade is also equipped with a system called Highway Drive Assist (standard on the Limited, optional on the SEL), a fancy name for a system that combines adaptive cruise control and lane keep assist with lane-centering technology, all of which work all the way down to a stop. It isn’t a hands-free system — you’ll still need to keep a hand on the wheel to keep it on — but it does work remarkably well whether you’re stuck in traffic or cruising down the highway. Stops and starts are smooth, and the Palisade stays in the middle of its lane without the ping-ponging effect we’ve noticed in other systems. Like the rest of the Palisade’s technology, it simply works, with little to no fuss involved.\n\n2020 Hyundai Palisade | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\nValue Leader\n\nWe don’t often get to say this about top trim levels, but even the Palisade Limited feels like a bargain. It starts at $45,795 (all prices include destination charges) and there isn’t much you can add to it apart from all-wheel drive. For that price, you get a really long list of features in addition to luxurious trappings, impressive technology and overall attention to detail that combine to make the Palisade feel more expensive than it actually is.\n\n“Expensive” is where several of the Palisade’s competitors sit. In our comparison, both the Ford Explorer and Chevrolet Traverse stickered nearly $7,000 more than the Palisade’s as-tested $47,605, and those vehicles don’t come close to the Palisade’s refinement. In fact, if you sat in all three, you’d guess the Palisade was by far the most expensive. As the results of our Challenge stated, “If our Palisade had cost $10,000 more, it might still have come out on top.” The fact that it costs less is a giant feather in the SUV’s cap.\n\nThe 2020 Palisade isn’t perfect, but it’s pretty darn close. It’s a worthy Challenge winner and a game changer among three-row SUVs.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2021 Hyundai Palisade?\n\nIntroduced last year, the Hyundai Palisade is a three-row SUV related to the Kia Telluride. Long on value and technology, the Palisade seats seven or eight, depending on whether there are captain’s chairs or a bench seat in the second row. \n\nPower comes from a 291-horsepower, 3.8-liter V-6 engine that works with an eight-speed automatic transmission. Front-wheel drive is standard and all-wheel drive is optional. Competitors include the Ford Explorer, Honda Pilot and Toyota Highlander.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2021 Hyundai Palisade?\n\nLED headlights and wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity are newly standard. Hyundai also upped the luxury ante with the addition of a top-of-the-line Calligraphy trim level that adds unique 20-inch alloy wheels, a different grille design, puddle lamps, quilted-leather door panels, a microfiber headliner and a perforated leather-wrapped steering wheel.  \n\nWhat Features in the 2021 Hyundai Palisade Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\n18-inch alloy wheels\nCloth upholstery\n8-inch multimedia system\nAdaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane-keep assist\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nPanoramic moonroof\nLeather-trimmed seats\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nSecond-row captain’s chairs\nPower-folding third row\n10.25-inch screen with navigation\nHarman Kardon premium stereo\n360-degree camera system\nHead-up display\nWireless device charging\nFully digital instrument panel\nBlind spot warning\n2021 Hyundai Palisade Vs. 2021 Ford Explorer: How Do They Compare?\n\nThe Hyundai Palisade and Ford Explorer are both spacious family SUVs with three rows of seats and plenty of standard safety features. The Palisade has the more luxurious interior of the two, but the Explorer offers more powertrain choices, including a 400-hp V-6 and a hybrid drivetrain.  \n\nShould I Buy the 2021 Hyundai Palisade?\n\nThe Palisade packs a lot of value, offering plenty of technology, safety features and upscale amenities. We liked it so much we named it our Best of 2020 award winner in its debut year. Third-row space is limited, however, and we did deal with an unpleasant interior smell during our Palisade ownership.",

      "expert_review": "The refreshed 2023 Hyundai Palisade adds new tech features, updated styling and a new XRT trim (first seen on the Tucson and Santa Fe) to the three-row SUV’s resume. Along with the refresh, the 2023 Palisade also brings a substantial price bump over the outgoing model, which earned Cars.com’s Best of 2020 award because of its ride quality, comfort, premium interior and overall value.\n\nRelated: 2023 Hyundai Palisade Gets Bolder Face, More Technology\n\nWhat’s New?\n2023 Hyundai Palisade | Manufacturer image\n\nExterior updates for the 2023 Palisade include a bigger and bolder grille, redesigned vertical LED headlights and a new rear bumper. The new XRT comes with a more rugged appearance but no additional off-road capability; features include dark 20-inch wheels, a darkened grille and black roof rails.\n\nInside, the refreshed Palisade gets a new 12.3-inch standard touchscreen, an available digital rearview camera mirror and a standard Wi-Fi hot spot. Added comfort and convenience features include available heated third-row seats, an ergonomic driver’s seat and USB-C outlets. The Palisade also adds available Remote Smart Parking Assist, a feature Hyundai already offers on other vehicles. Additional safety upgrades include second-row side-impact airbags and an enhanced SmartSense driver-assist suite.\n\nWhat doesn’t change is the Palisade’s powertrain: The same 291-horsepower, 3.8-liter V-6 that powers the outgoing model is found under the hood of all 2023 Palisades. The V-6 is paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission, and each Palisade comes with standard front-wheel drive or available all-wheel drive. A new Tow mode is added for AWD models.\n\nTrims, Pricing and Release Date\n2023 Hyundai Palisade XRT | Manufacturer image\n\nThe 2023 Hyundai Palisade goes on sale in the summer with a choice of five trims: SE, SEL, XRT, Limited and Calligraphy. The base SE starts at $36,245 (all prices include a $1,295 destination charge) and comes with standard cloth seats, second-row bench seats, and the new 12.3-inch display with standard Apple Carplay and Android Auto.\n\nThe SEL starts at $39,245 and adds an eight-way power driver’s seat, standard second-row captain’s chairs (or a bench seat at no additional cost) and heated front seats that swap cloth fabric for imitation leather. Wireless phone charging and a hands-free power liftgate also come standard.\n\nThe new XRT adds the exterior features outlined above along with a power sunroof and black imitation leather seats; it starts at $41,545.\n\nWith a starting price of $47,795, the Limited gains leather seats, a panoramic moonroof, heated third-row seats and a head-up display.\n\nThe range-topping Calligraphy starts at $50,195 and adds upgrades like trim-specific 20-inch wheels, unique grille and front bumper styling, premium Nappa leather upholstery, a digital rearview mirror and ergonomic driver’s seat.\n\nAWD-equipped models add Snow and Tow modes along with a $1,900 price bump over FWD variants. The 2023 Palisade’s price tag increases by $1,350 for the base SE and $2,000 for the SEL but just $660 for the Limited; the Calligraphy comes at a $2,905 premium over the outgoing 2022 model.\n\nVersus the Competition\n2023 Kia Telluride | Manufacturer image\n\nEven with the higher price tag, the 2023 Hyundai Palisade is competitive compared with rivals like the Toyota Highlander, Honda Pilot, Ford Explorer and Kia Telluride. The 2022 Highlander starts at $37,070; the 2022 Pilot has a starting price of $39,375; the 2022 Explorer starts at $35,505; and the 2022 Kia Telluride has the most affordable base model with a starting price of $34,725, though it was also updated for the 2023 model year.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nUp Close With the 2023 Hyundai Palisade\nBest of 2020\nHyundai Palisade: Which Should You Buy, 2021 or 2022?\n2022 Hyundai Palisade Specs, Price, MPG & Reviews\nResearch the Hyundai Palisade\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Comfortable, posh and loaded with features, the 2024 Hyundai Palisade three-row SUV provides a premium family-hauling experience at a value price.\n\nVersus the competition: It’s not the freshest offering, but it’s still one of the best. While rival SUVs have bigger interiors, better handling, quieter rides and more useable third-row seats, the Palisade puts in a solid performance in all these categories — and it beats all comers on sheer value.\n\nWe’ve made no secret about how much we like the Hyundai Palisade. It won our Best of 2020 award, and it’s consistently been one of our highest-ranked family vehicles ever since. Every time we get into one, we’re amazed at just how far Hyundai has come as a company, with products that lead the industry in so many ways. \n\nThe Palisade got some updated tech and a styling refresh inside and out for the 2023 model year, and it continues the trend of each new Hyundai being better than the one it replaced. Almost every aspect of the Palisade has seen some improvement, maintaining the big SUV’s status as one of our favorite vehicles for drivers who need to carry a lot of people, but who absolutely refuse to be seen doing so in a minivan. \n\nRelated: 2024 3-Row SUV Challenge: Repeat Champ Hyundai Palisade Proves Hard to Beat\n\nSharper Styling\n\nThe old Palisade pleased us with its modern looks and attractive styling, and the new one looks even better. Changes to the light patterns up front continue to give it a distinctive look; there’s no mistaking what this is from a distance, whether you’re looking from the front or the rear. While some entries in Hyundai’s lineup are starting to go boxy (check out the redesigned 2024 Santa Fe — wow, eh?), the larger Palisade keeps its smoother aesthetic, which Hyundai says it’s likely to do for some time. Given its heft and body lines, from the side you could even be convinced it was a Chevrolet Tahoe, despite the fact that it’s a bit smaller than that body-on-frame, truck-based SUV. But this isn’t a truck-based SUV; the Palisade uses a front-wheel-drive chassis with optional all-wheel drive, as do most three-row SUVs these days. \n\nIf you’re interested in going all out on the trim and options list, you can get a Palisade as decked out as our test model: a new Calligraphy Night Edition. Calligraphy is the Palisade’s top trim and comes with plenty of premium features and luxurious upholstery, while the Night Edition moniker tells you this one also has a black-out trim package. In short, it’s loaded with everything you can get on a Palisade, but with dark-chrome finishes on the bumpers and grille, body-colored door handles, and dark-painted 20-inch wheels and roof rails. There are some changes to the interior, as well, including the regular Calligraphy trim’s leather upholstery being swapped out for premium microfiber fabric — an interesting choice you don’t often see on a premium-trim vehicle. \n\nRelated Video: \n\nInterior Upgrades\n\nPop into the driver’s seat of one of the Palisade’s higher trim levels and you’ll be greeted by a digital dashboard. Front and center is a 12.3-inch digital display with reconfigurable gauges that can change appearance based on what drive mode you’re in or can be manually changed to suit whichever theme you prefer. To the right of that is a standard 12.3-inch touchscreen that runs Hyundai’s newer multimedia system, which remains one of the easiest to use and best-organized systems on the market. It includes plenty of icons, but nothing is hard to find. There are lots of menus and configuration adjustments, too, but none are difficult to figure out, even on the go. Its only foible has been a problem for some time now, and we’re still confounded by it: Wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are not available, meaning you have to plug in your phone to use these features. Lesser multimedia systems on other Hyundais have wireless connectivity, as do the larger screens in recently updated models like the 2025 Tucson and Santa Fe, but the Palisade’s 12.3-inch touchscreen system apparently can’t accommodate it — and Hyundai can’t be bothered to spend the money to make a design change to enable it. It’s a weird, glaring omission. \n\nComfort is king in the Palisade. Front-seat comfort is truly exceptional  — unless you’re a driver who likes to spread your legs a bit, in which case you might find it a bit cramped due to the shape of the door pulls and the very wide center console. The dash is also high; if you’re looking for a more airy feeling, the dashboard in the related Kia Telluride has all the same content and equipment, but is a few inches lower. The Telluride also has a narrower center console and door, leading to a more spacious feel in the front seats. \n\nThe Palisade’s seats themselves, however, are lovely, as are the second-row captain’s chairs that come in the Calligraphy Night Edition. They’re power-folding and can tilt and slide forward to allow access to the third row. Space in that third row is decent for adult humans on short trips, but it’s best-suited for younglings. That third row is also powered on most trims, and — amping up the features-for-the-money quotient — all three rows can have three-mode heating. Everything is covered in premium fabric, which might not be best for families, but if your kids are a bit older and spills aren’t a concern, it shouldn’t be a problem. \n\nWhat’s truly nice about the Palisade’s center console is that there’s a ton of storage room, and the console’s reconfigurable cupholders-or-big-bin system is novel and useful. Of course, to allow for that kind of space, Hyundai has fitted the Palisade with a push-button transmission selector. While we love having buttons instead of touch-sensitive controls in any interior (they’re far less distracting and easier to use), push-button transmission selectors are still difficult to use quickly. The Palisade’s Kia Telluride cousin has a transmission shift lever, and while that setup is infinitely preferable, it does mean the Kia doesn’t have a massive center console bin like the Palisade’s. \n\nCalm, Cool and Collected, if a Bit Cranky\n\nDriving the new Palisade isn’t all that different from driving the old one, as everything under the skin carries over unchanged. It’s powered by a naturally aspirated 3.8-liter V-6 engine at a time when some automakers are moving to turbocharged four-cylinders (like in the Volkswagen Atlas) and even hybrid drive systems (like in Toyota’s Grand Highlander). The Palisade’s V-6 produces 291 horsepower and 262 pounds-feet of torque, which is adequate to get this big SUV moving, but it doesn’t feel like there’s a whole lot of low-rpm power. An eight-speed automatic transmission sends power to all four wheels in the Calligraphy Night Edition, though FWD is standard on the regular Calligraphy trim. It’s not the quietest engine under full chat, but the noise isn’t intrusive. In a word, it’s fine. Nobody will be wowed by the Palisade’s acceleration, but neither will this SUV embarrass itself trying to accelerate onto a highway with a full passenger load. \n\nRide quality in the Palisade is acceptable, but not what anyone would call posh due to the big, available 20-inch wheels with low-profile tires. Road noise is also rather pronounced due to those tires, but despite their size and stickiness the Palisade’s handling properties match its engine performance — it’s fine. It’s not athletic, and steering is rather numb, but for family duty and around-town transport, it’s absolutely adequate. Brakes, however, are a high point, with strong initial bite and excellent feel and modulation; they’re capable of hauling this big SUV down from highway speeds with no drama or sketchiness. The Palisade simply feels like a big family wagon; nobody is going to drive one spiritedly, so it hasn’t been tuned to provide spirited driving characteristics. If you want a higher dose of sport in your three-row SUV, you’ll want to wander over to a Volkswagen showroom and have a look at the Atlas, which quite handily fills the role of “the sporty one” in the three-row crossover class. If you’re just looking for comfortable, well-equipped and spacious accommodations in a vehicle that will do what’s asked of it without drama or sparkle, the Palisade is a totally fine choice. \n\nMore From Cars.com: \n\nWhat’s the Best 3-Row SUV for 2024?\nWhich 3-Row SUV Has the Best Real-World MPG?\nVideo: Which 3-Row SUV Has the Most Cargo Space?\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2024 Hyundai Palisade?\nShop for a 2024 Hyundai Palisade\nWide Variety of Prices\n\nPerhaps one of the more interesting aspects of the Palisade is the wide variety of trims and prices you’ll find at the showroom. Pricing starts out just a tick over $38,000 (all prices include destination) for the base Palisade SE FWD, which is an incredible bargain for a vehicle this big and well equipped. That 12.3-inch touchscreen is standard on all trims, as is the 3.8-liter V-6 (it’s the only engine available), and even adding AWD for $2,000 means this vehicle will sticker at just about $40K. \n\nHyundai likes to organize options into trim levels, and the Palisade has six trims to choose from, each with increasing levels of content. Above the SE is the SEL, then the off-road styled (but not off-road capable) XRT, then Limited, Calligraphy and the Calligraphy Night Edition. The total as-tested price for our Calligraphy Night Edition (which had only two options: floormats and Hyper White paint) was $55,600. That’s as loaded-to-the-gills as the Palisade can get, so selecting a lower trim means you can quite easily get a truly well-equipped Palisade for well under the average price of a new car in the U.S. (which is around $48,000). That makes it an even better choice for families eschewing minivans who still need something solid, spacious and affordable. The newest Palisade truly excels in only a handful of areas, but it’s so solidly competent in so many areas that, in the end, it all adds up to be an outstanding choice. \n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Competes with: Chevrolet Traverse, Ford Explorer, Honda Pilot, Kia Telluride, Subaru Ascent\n\nLooks like: The Palisade got some dental work, and there’s a new soft-road XRT trim\n\nPowertrain: 291-horsepower 3.8-liter V-6; eight-speed automatic transmission; front- or all-wheel drive\n\nHits dealers: Summer\n\nWe’re mostly fans of the Hyundai Palisade here at Cars.com; we named it our Best of 2020 winner and even purchased one for our long-term fleet. We also dealt with months of foul-smelling interior issues that seem to have been fixed in later iterations but were extremely frustrating during our ownership experience. For the 2023 model year, Hyundai’s three-row SUV gets mild exterior updates and more significant technology updates, as well as a trendy new XRT soft-road trim.\n\nRelated: ​​More 2022 New York Auto Show Coverage\n\nIn an extremely competitive class — one where the Telluride’s Kia Telluride cousin is stealing the spotlight — will these updates be enough for the Palisade to climb to the top of shopper’s lists?\n\nExterior Updates\n\nThe most noticeable change to the Palisade’s exterior is its larger, bolder grille design and new vertical LED headlights. In photos, the grille looks less angular than other Hyundai models but is still a bit jarring, like someone you know getting veneers with no warning. The rear bumper design has also been updated.\n\nThe other major change is a new XRT trim level. The XRT designation is one Hyundai has begun using for models that have the appearance of off-road vehicles, though without any additional capability — an increasingly popular move. The Palisade XRT gets dark-finish 20-inch wheels and “rugged look” exterior styling on the front and rear and along the doors, along with a darkened grille and black roof rails.\n\nImproved Technology\n\nThe bigger changes happen inside, which gains a host of updated comfort and convenience technologies. A new 12-inch touchscreen display is joined by more powerful USB-C ports (replacing less powerful USB-A connections) and wireless device charging upgraded to 15 watts from 5 watts. A Hyundai-first rearview camera mirror provides a view behind the Palisade if the traditional mirror is obscured by passengers or cargo inside the SUV. Another Hyundai-first technology in the new Palisade is an available Wi-Fi hot spot. Owners can also use the latest iteration of Hyundai’s Digital Key 2, which supports iPhone, Apple Watch and Samsung Galaxy devices, to unlock and operate the SUV.\n\nComfort improvements include the first heated third-row seats in a Hyundai, a new ergonomic driver’s seat design, and new wing-out head restraints and ventilation that improve occupant comfort in the second row. Additional changes have been made to the instrument panel and air vent designs.\n\nUnchanged Under the Hood\n\nOne area that remains mostly unchanged is the Palisade’s powertrain: Buyers will still get a 3.8-liter V-6 producing 291 horsepower and 262 pounds-feet of torque, paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission. The only choice will be whether to have front- or all-wheel drive. All-wheel-drive Palisades, however, will have a new tow driving mode that adjusts the transmission response while towing to hold gears longer and reduce shifting frequency.\n\nSafety Features\n\nAmong the advanced safety features on the Palisade are hands-on semi-autonomous driving, forward collision avoidance assist with pedestrian detection, lane keep assist with lane-centering steering, blind spot warning with collision avoidance assist and rear cross-traffic alert, rear automatic emergency braking, driver attention monitoring and remote parking assist to move the Palisade in and out of tight spaces.\n\nPricing and Release Date\n\nThe 2023 Hyundai Palisade goes on sale in the summer with a starting price of $36,245.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nCSI: Car Smell Investigation, 2020 Hyundai Palisade Edition\n2020 Hyundai Palisade Vs. 2020 Toyota Highlander: Family SUVs Duke It Out\n2020 Hyundai Palisade: Here’s What Our First Service Visit Cost\nHyundai Palisade: Which Should You Buy, 2021 or 2022?\n2022 Hyundai Palisade Specs, Price, MPG & Reviews\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Hyundai Palisade? \n\nThe Hyundai Palisade is a three-row SUV that’s a mechanical twin to the popular Kia Telluride. Big on value and user-friendly technology, the Palisade seats seven or eight depending on whether captain’s chairs or a bench seat are chosen for the second row. \n\nPower comes from a 291-horsepower, 3.8-liter V-6 engine that works with an eight-speed automatic transmission. Front-wheel drive is standard, and all-wheel drive is optional. Competitors include the Chevrolet Traverse, Ford Explorer, Honda Pilot, Subaru Ascent, and the Toyota Highlander and Grand Highlander.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Hyundai Palisade? \n\nThe Palisade sees minimal changes for 2025. A new SEL Premium trim debuts, replacing the SEL’s previous Premium Package, and some existing trims gain additional standard equipment.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Hyundai Palisade Are Most Important? \n\nStandard features include: \n\n18-inch alloy wheels\nCloth upholstery\n12.3-inch multimedia system with navigation\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nAdaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability\nAutomatic emergency braking\nBlind spot warning\nLane departure steering assist\nDriver attention warning\nSafe exit assist\n\nAvailable features include: \n\n20-inch alloy wheels\nSelf-leveling suspension\nPanoramic moonroof\nLeather-trimmed seats\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated second- and third-row seats\nSecond-row captain’s chairs\nPower-folding third row\nHarman Kardon 12-speaker premium stereo\n360-degree camera system\nHead-up display\nWireless device charging\nDigital instrument panel\nPassenger Talk in-car intercom\nBlind spot camera \nRain-sensing wipers\nShould I Buy the 2025 Hyundai Palisade? \n\nThe Palisade packs a whole lot of value into a three-row SUV, with an impressive array of comfort, tech and safety features. Moving to one of the higher available trim levels gets you a spacious luxury SUV without the luxury price tag; the Calligraphy Night Edition is especially sinister-looking in addition to being luxurious. When the Palisade first arrived, we liked it so much we named it our Best of 2020 award winner, and it remains one of our favorite three-row SUVs.

      "expert_review": "Is the 2026 Hyundai Palisade a Good SUV?\n\nYes! In fact, it’s one of the better three-row SUVs available on the market from a utility, comfort and space perspective. Look to the XRT Pro for off-road capability and the Calligraphy trim for a “Genesis lite” experience.\n\nWhat does the 2026 Hyundai Palisade Compete With?\n\nAs before, the Hyundai Palisade’s primary competition are the Ford Explorer, Honda Pilot, Kia Telluride, Nissan Pathfinder, Subaru Ascent, Toyota Grand Highlander and Volkswagen Atlas.\n\nWe like quite a few cars and SUVs here at Cars.com, but with the Hyundai Palisade, our admiration is quantifiable. We heaped awards and comparison wins onto the first generation of Hyundai’s largest three-row, naming it our standout Best of 2020, the same year it took home a comparison test win against the segment’s hottest. Later updates for 2024 nabbed it another overall comparison win, shortly before being named Cars.com’s Best Family Car for 2025.\n\nRelated: How Much Is the Redesigned 2026 Hyundai Palisade?\n\nYup, we really liked the old Palisade — and I expect we (and Hyundai’s customer base) will like the new second gen just as much or if not more than the first. That’s hardly a surprise, as early previews of this new Palisade revealed Hyundai took everything we liked about the prior SUV and polished it to a fine shine. At the same time, however, it left some things we were either neutral or critical of intact, while also taking the nameplate in a slightly different dynamic direction.\n\nTo see if the new Palisade is as improved as it appears to be, I headed to Calistoga, Calif., to drive it and find out (per Cars.com’s ethics policy, we pay for all travel and lodging at such manufacturer-sponsored events).\n\nRelated Video:\n\nDoes the 2026 Hyundai Palisade Look Different Than Before?\n\nWe’ll start with some brief appreciation for the new Palisade’s clear stylistic honing that pushes it a smidge upmarket (if not in price). Kitted out with the top-shelf Calligraphy trim, it’s a handsome and modestly elegant SUV with ritzy touches like new 21-inch wheels and matte-silver trim that contrasts well against any color.\n\nIt’s boxier and clearly more “SUV” in profile, taking measured inspiration from Hyundai’s upright, truckish Santa Fe while still retaining a soft-edge appearance more in line with the competitive field. It’s all cohesive in person, and the Calligraphy looks just evolved enough to attract existing Palisade owners and cross-shoppers alike.\n\nThe biggest news of this updated Palisade is the long-awaited addition of a hybrid drivetrain, but you’ll have to wait for our on-hands take on that later in 2025. Hyundai’s kicking things off with the standard mass-market powertrain, a new naturally aspirated 3.5-liter V-6 shared with the Kia Carnival minivan and a number of Hyundai and Kia models abroad — so, new for the Palisade but not the market, and not really an upgrade over the outgoing 3.8-liter V-6.\n\nWhat Engine Does the 2026 Hyundai Palisade Have?\n\nThe 3.5-liter’s 287 horsepower and 260 pounds-feet of torque trail the old engine by a speck, down 4 hp and 2 pounds-feet, respectively. All of this is routed through an eight-speed automatic transmission and your choice of either front- or all-wheel drive, with a standard (and unchanged) tow rating of 5,000 pounds. Outside the latter, these are not strong figures, especially since I found the prior Palisade’s poky performance to be one of its biggest flaws.\n\n2026 Hyundai Palisade Calligraphy, rear angle | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\n\nUnfortunately, it’s the same thing here. The new V-6 is smooth, reasonably quiet and not overly harsh in any meaningful way, but late-breaking peaky power leads to straight-line acceleration that’s meandering at best — and that’s with just two adult men in tow. Those quick to dismiss any lackluster performance here in the context of this being a three-row family hauler and not a Porsche 911 must be reminded that if it’s sluggish when empty, you’re going to feel every ounce of ballast as the seats and stowage fills up.\n\nDuring merging and attempted passing maneuvers, the AWD Palisade Calligraphy felt rather sluggish when compared to some of the competition. A weight penalty of up to 366 pounds (depending on configuration) between generations is the clear antagonist here, made particularly frustrating when you take stock of Hyundai’s greater powertrain portfolio.\n\nHyundai’s established turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder family trails the updated Palisade’s V-6 at 277 hp, but its 311 pounds-feet means turbo Santa Fes are more comfortable and at ease hauling a full house than the larger Palisade. The question of whether this four-cylinder would fit isn’t even up for debate: The 2.5T serves as the core gas-powered portion of the new Palisade Hybrid.\n\nHow Does the 2026 Hyundai Palisade Drive?\n\nDynamically, it’s a similar story — but the ending is markedly different. Compared to the first gen, the new Palisade feels heavy and drives “larger” than the modest 2.7-inch wheelbase stretch and 2.5-inch overall gain in length can account for. Driver inputs are muted, with a marshmallowy brake feel, soupy steering and pillowy ride making for a driving experience notably softer than the more neutral feel of the last Palisade.\n\n2026 Hyundai Palisade Calligraphy, front row | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\n\nThat’s not a bad thing. Outside of the engine’s peaky power delivery, the 2026 Palisade carries an air of distinct refinement and comfort that makes it one of the more isolating and generally comfortable SUVs in the class. This is especially true in the luxe Calligraphy trim, where interior appointments could almost pass for something wearing the Genesis badge. Quilted Nappa leather, microsuede trim, thoughtfully textured plastics, damped controls and convincing faux-wood trim compose an environment that’s easily one of the best among rivals and punches significantly above what some might expect from the brand.\n\nAgain, I can’t speak for the cockpit of lower trims outside of some brief time spent in the new XRT Pro, but the handsome and rounded interior space is modelwide, as is the isolated driving experience and lovely controls.\n\nIs the 2026 Hyundai Palisade Well Equipped?\n\nThe tech and features are great, too. You’ll find twin 12.3-inch screens for the driver display and infotainment functions along with standard wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto and wireless device charging on every trim save the base SE. Six 100-watt USB-C chargeports pepper the cabin with two in each row, along with available heated and ventilated seating surfaces for the first two rows and three-mode heated seats for the third row maintaining toasty bums.\n\nAll of the expected creature comforts are here on the $58,000 AWD Calligraphy, including a head-up display, surround-view cameras, Bose premium sound system, power-folding second and third row, heated leather-wrapped steering wheel and third-row intercom. It’s an exceedingly plush space to wick a commute away, especially if you’d rather not pony up for the smaller and far, far more expensive Genesis GV80.\n\nThe third row was particularly impressive, with my, ah, full-framed 5-foot-11 self plenty comfortable behind an adjusted second-row seat. Compared to other third rows best left for kids or emergency use, I’d not be too upset if the ride to dinner stretched beyond the half-hour mark, especially with access to my own air-conditioning vents, heated seats and USB-C port.\n\nRead More About the Hyundai Palisade:\n\n2026 Hyundai Palisade Up Close: Hybrid, Off-Road Versions for the Boxy SUV\n2026 Hyundai Palisade Goes Greener, Grittier With New Hybrid, Off-Road Models\nWhich 3-Row SUVs Offer Captain’s Chairs?\nHere’s What’s New at Hyundai for 2026\nResearch the Hyundai Palisade\n2026 Hyundai Palisade XRT Pro, off-road rear | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\n2026 Hyundai Palisade XRT Pro\n\nGo Calligraphy for max cush and the new XRT Pro for max capability. Whereas Hyundai’s prior XRT trims are best considered as no more than vaguely rugged appearance packages, the “Pro” appendage is the real deal when it comes to pointing your Palisade off-piste. From a mechanical perspective, the AWD-only XRT Pro adds an exclusive electronic limited-slip rear differential, an extra inch of ground clearance, improved angles of approach, departure and breakover, genuine all-terrain tires, off-road info display page and functional exposed tow hooks. And though the XRT Pro’s hardware is a significant leg up on the regular SUV, the new Mud, Sand and Snow terrain modes are standard on all AWD Palisades, as is hill descent control.\n\nI put this new rough-‘n’-ready trim to the test on an off-road trail with special sections set up to demonstrate the XRT Pro’s ground clearance, rear-differential and suspension articulation. Other than some very tight passes on a hillside trail, it was generally easy going with zero apparent clearance or traction issues. While I have no doubt the XRT Pro will handle any moderate-difficulty fire road or desert two-track with little issue, the illusion of difficulty of Hyundai’s curated course was shattered when a Calligraphy unexpectedly emerged from the forest stage while I was out taking photos, the driver having accidentally taken a wrong turn. Having handled the tight ridge road, sharp descent section and silty uphill charge, the driver smartly bypassed the articulation and ground-clearance trials while returning to base camp.\n\nWithin the context of these two trims, the 2026 Hyundai Palisade is roundly impressive and immediately a clear class standout, picking up and quickly charging ahead from where the prior generation left off. More in-depth testing is needed regarding full-passenger capacity and comfort, child-seat functionality and perhaps finding our own limits of the XRT Pro, but Hyundai’s already got a winner on its hands. Next stop: the Palisade Hybrid.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
