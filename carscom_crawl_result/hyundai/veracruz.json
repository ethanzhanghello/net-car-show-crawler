      "expert_review": "Once down and almost out, South Korean automaker continues to make gains in quality\n\nIf anyone can appreciate how Toyota feels, it’s Hyundai, whose little $4,000 Excel set a first-year sales record in the mid-’80s before quality issues swept Hyundai from penthouse to outhouse.\n\nIronically, most analysts see been-there-done-that Hyundai gaining sales at the expense of Toyota, which has been recalling cars that tend to get up and go without wanting to stop.Could be, considering Hyundai recovered from the Excel fiasco by focusing on quality and offering well-equipped vehicles at prices below the competition, primarily Toyota and Honda.\n\nEven before Toyota’s troubles surfaced, Hyundai planned to make some inroads for 2010 by adding even more goodies as standard on the base Veracruz GLS, such as power driver’s seat, roof-rack side rails, backup alert, fog lights and a “cool box” under the center armrest.\n\nWe tested the midsize GLS, one of several competitors in the midsize crossover segment that’s taking sales away from SUVs and minivans.\n\nVeracruz has three rows of seats for seven. The third row hides under the cargo floor until needed, creating a very generous space: Think room for more than a week’s supply of groceries or more than two weeks of vacation luggage. Second-row seatbacks also fold, though not flat, to make way for bikes or golf clubs.\n\nWith third-row seats up, you’ll have to settle for stashing soft-sided luggage or duffel bags in back and a few small items under the floor.\n\nAlso generous are head, leg and knee room in the 60/40-split second row, where a center armrest flips down to expose a pair of cupholders and a small stowage compartment. Climate controls and power plug reside there too.\n\nTo slip into the third row, second-row seats slide forward to open a tight aisle. Melons are optional in back unless you fill the cupholders with ice cubes to relieve pounding against the low roof and/or tailgate.\n\nThe wide front seats are well cushioned, and the smooth suspension limits unnecessary movement. Neat touches are the heated cloth front seats, plus USB, iPod and auxiliary power outlets in the center console, along with a power plug and cupholders. An air vent in the cool box under the center armrest chills pop cans using the air conditioning or warms coffee cups using the heater.\n\nVeracruz is powered by a 3.8-liter, 260-horsepower V-6 that moves nicely from the light or into the passing lane. But the crossover weighs in at more than 4,400 pounds. Add the on-demand all-wheel drive, which sends power to the wheels needing traction when slippage is detected, and the mileage rating is only 16 mpg city/22 highway. With a 20-gallon tank, however, you can still expect to go about 400 miles before a refill.\n\nStability and traction control ensure good road manners in fair or foul weather, while an AWD lock setting helps in deep snow.\n\nThe well-equipped Veracruz GLS starts at $30,045. Add the premium option package at $4,950 to get navigation system, power sunroof/tailgate, dual-zone air and power tilt/telescoping steering wheel. A rear-seat DVD entertainment system is available ($1,500) only if you move up to the Limited version.",

      "expert_review": "Hyundai, the first South Korean automaker to enter the U.S. market, has come a long way since it rolled out its initial product here in 1985, the subcompact Excel hatchback.\n\nAlthough it built its reputation on mostly small, affordable and fuel-efficient vehicles, Hyundai has become much more than that now, with a full line of cars, SUVs and a minivan.\n\nFor 2009, the company introduced its first true luxury sedan, the Genesis, and a coupe version of it is on the way to market.\n\nThe Genesis was so good that it won the North American Car of the Year award at this past January’s Detroit auto show.\n\nHyundai also now has a premium SUV as well. For 2007, the company brought the midsize Veracruz crossover to the United States, and for 2009, it comes with a base price range of $27,145 (plus $750 freight) for the entry-level GLS front-drive model to $35,995 for the top-of-the-line Limited model with all-wheel drive.\n\nWe tested the Limited front-drive model (base price $34,295 plus freight).\n\nWith options and freight, our tester’s price rang up at $38,295, but that included the Navigation Package ($1,750), which also brought the uplevel Logic 7 surround-sound 605-watt audio system; and the Rear Seat Entertainment Package ($1,500), which comes with a roof-mounted eight-inch LCD screen and two wireless headphones.\n\nIt’s not necessary to pay this much to get a nicely equipped Veracruz, however. The GLS model with its under-$28,000 price is a good buy if you can live without all the fancy extras and gadgets.\n\nThe marvelous thing about the Veracruz is that it seems a lot more expensive than it is, with the look and feel of a luxury model such as the Lexus RX 350, against which the Veracruz was benchmarked. The RX 350 begins at just under $38,000.\n\nAll models come with the same 3.8-liter V-6 engine with dual exhaust, rated at 260 horsepower and 257 foot-pounds of torque.\n\nThe engine is connected to a six-speed automatic transmission, another feature distinguishing the Veracruz from its competitors. Most of them have five-speed automatics, including the competing Honda Pilot and Toyota Highlander.\n\nStandard on even the base Veracruz are such amenities as electronic stability control, traction control, antilock brakes with electronic brake-force distribution, front seat-mounted side air bags, roof-mounted side-curtain air bags for all rows, 17-inch alloy wheels, six-speaker compact-disc audio system with iPod connection, power/heated outside mirrors with approach lights and turn-signal lights, cruise control with steering-wheel controls, power windows/mirrors/door locks with remote, and much more.\n\nThat means that even at the starting price, with very few (if any) options tacked on to the sticker, the Veracruz comes across as a bargain.\n\nAdding such options that were either standard or included on our Veracruz Limited model, including leather interior and the rear-seat entertainment system, sunroof, backup warning system, and 18-inch alloy wheels – among other things – would push the RX 350’s price into the upper $40,000s.\n\nKeep in mind, though, that the Veracruz is not a Lexus, and the Hyundai name is not the attention-getter that Lexus is. But with prices starting $11,000 less than those of the RX 350, and with a similarly equipped Veracruz running about $8,000 less than the base RX, Hyundai surely wins the value race.\n\nGranted, those who would buy a Lexus and those who would buy a Hyundai are entirely different customers. But the point is that anyone who chooses the Veracruz can feel good about the purchase. This is a lot of vehicle for the money, and even without a name like Lexus, it’s quite elegant.\n\nThe Hyundai also stacks up well against popular crossovers that Veracruz shoppers might also consider – the Pilot and Highlander, as well as the Nissan Murano and Ford Edge.\n\nAnd while Hyundai might have a hard time taking customers away from Honda, Toyota and Nissan, it can offer a great crossover with lots of standard equipment to those who can’t quite afford one of those Japanese brands. The Veracruz really is on the same level, but with a lower price.\n\nThis is the third SUV in the Hyundai lineup. It joined the entry compact Tucson and midsize Santa Fe. The Veracruz is built on a stretched and widened Santa Fe chassis to allow for a roomy third row of seating, giving it a maximum capacity of seven. (The RX 350 has room for only five.)\n\nThere is more cargo volume – 86.8 cubic feet with the second and third seats folded – than in all of the Veracruz’s direct competitors except for the Pilot (87.6 cubic feet).\n\nFuel-economy ratings are quite decent for a roomy seven-passenger SUV. The Veracruz is rated at 16 miles per gallon in the city and 23 on the highway vs. 17/23 for the Pilot, 18/24 for the V-6 Highlander, and 18/23 for the Murano (all with two-wheel drive).\n\nInside, the Veracruz is quieter than the Pilot, with levels of noise and vibration that nearly match those of the Lexus RX.\n\nThe Veracruz has achieved the top five-star crash-test ratings from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in frontal- and side-impact testing for all front and rear passengers. It scored four stars in the rollover rating, which is the highest any of the crossovers have received.\n\nIn designing the Veracruz, Hyundai went with an exterior similar to that of several of the newer crossovers, including the RX 350, Edge and Acura MDX, which is an upscale version of the Pilot. The styling was a product of Hyundai’s California studio and was tailored for American tastes.\n\nLuxury abounds inside the Veracruz. There is nothing cheap or cheesy looking. The leather seats are optional on the base model, but standard on the Limited. Our vehicle also had wood-grain interior trim that gave it a premium look.\n\nStandard on our Limited model were several items that usually are found only on premium models, and then sometimes only as options. Among them were a power rear liftgate, automatic climate control and a backup warning system.\n\nBase models come with a single-disc CD player that is MP3-capable, and XM satellite radio is standard.\n\nOur Limited model came with the uplevel Infinity audio system with a six-disc CD changer. Other standard features included power adjustable pedals, power tilt-and-telescopic steering wheel, rain-sensing wipers, 115-volt power outlet, and a keyless entry/start system. The key can be left in the pocket, and the doors unlock as the person with the key fob approaches the vehicle.\n\nAll-wheel drive is a $1,700 option on either trim level. Most Sun Belt buyers choose the two-wheel drive models, but all-wheel drive system is of value even outside snowy climates and is a bargain at this price.\n\nIt can direct up to half of the torque to the rear wheels, and there is a lock switch on the dash that can force it into the 50/50 mode. The Veracruz has 8.1 inches of ground clearance, which makes it suitable for some light off-road use, but as with most crossovers, this vehicle is not designed for rugged off-road use.\n\nRide quality is quite Lexus-like in the Veracruz, which also helps give it a luxury feel.\n\nThe engine offers decent acceleration, even on uphill freeway ramps, although as with most vehicles in this class, it can feel a little sluggish when fully loaded with people and their stuff.\n\nThe Veracruz, which is based on the architecture of the Sonata midsize sedan, handled quite well on some fun twisty country roads. It’s not a sports car, of course, but for an SUV, it holds the road quite well and the steering is predictable.\n\nThe automotive columns of G.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThough Hyundai likes to compare the Veracruz crossover to luxury models like the Lexus RX 350, shoppers will likely size it against less expensive offerings like the Honda Pilot and Toyota Highlander.

All-wheel drive is optional.\n\n\nNew for 2012\nThe Veracruz gets a new grille and updated 18-inch alloy wheels, which are available. The Limited trim adds heated second-row seats and can be equipped with an Alpine navigation system.\n\nExterior\nSwooping curves and two-tone bodywork define the Veracruz, which emulates styling themes set by Hyundai’s Santa Fe crossover.

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in April 2007 about the SE FWD and Limited FWD versions of the 2007 Hyundai Veracruz. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what details are different this year, check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe number of three-row crossover SUVs has grown dramatically over the past few months, with new models like the Mazda CX-9 and Saturn Outlook offering alternatives to the traditional SUV. Hyundai’s new seven-seat Veracruz is the latest to join the category, and on the whole it matches up well against the competition with its smooth ride, quiet cabin and interior quality, making it a must-drive for consumers in this market.\n\nRide & Handling\nThe Veracruz has a four-wheel independent suspension with front and rear stabilizer bars. The setup is tuned for cruising, sensible for a vehicle like this. The crossover feels stable on the highway, and it’s rather quiet, which means Hyundai’s sound-deadening efforts, including four layers of padding under the carpet, have paid off.\n\nOn the negative side, there’s some play in the steering wheel at the center position, and the rack-and-pinion system doesn’t offer a lot of feedback for the driver. Front- and all-wheel-drive versions of the Veracruz both weigh more than two tons, and while the crossover’s weight isn’t usually noticeable, it does make itself known the moment you encounter a twisty road. That encounter produces pronounced body roll, and the Veracruz doesn’t feel as comfortable in this setting as the CX-9 does.\n\nGoing & Stopping\nAll trim levels are powered by a 260-horsepower, 3.8-liter V-6, and its standard transmission is a smooth-shifting six-speed automatic with a clutchless-manual mode. Front-wheel-drive models get an EPA-estimated 18/25 mpg (city/highway), while all-wheel-drive estimates dip to 17/24 mpg. These figures are nearly identical to the Outlook’s gas mileage estimates and slightly better than the CX-9’s.\n\nOn the road, the Veracruz feels swifter than the heavier Outlook, but not as quick as the CX-9, even though it’s slightly lighter than the Mazda. The V-6 is quiet, builds revs smoothly and provides adequate acceleration; like the Outlook, though, you can tell it’s a bit burdened by the vehicle’s weight.\n\nThe Veracruz’s all-disc antilock brakes have no trouble bringing this crossover to a stop, but the brake pedal’s mushy feel is a little disappointing.\n\nCabin & Features\nThe Veracruz’s cabin has a few issues, but overall it’s nicely executed and features a number of upscale details, like a padded dashboard, matte-finished plastic trim and tight panel gaps. Even the silver-colored center panel with the air conditioning and audio controls looks good. (Most of the time I think this color scheme cheapens an interior.)\n\nPerhaps the best aspect of the Veracruz’s cabin is its lack of the heavy chemical smell that’s plagued a number of Hyundais I’ve tested in the past. The rich leather odor permeating the leather-trimmed versions I drove is a huge improvement and wouldn’t be out of place in a luxury car.\n\nOn the downside, the Veracruz’s standard tilt/telescoping steering wheel is a bit clunky to adjust. At first it appears to be infinitely adjustable for angle and reach, as many are, but if you try to set it you’ll discover notches for the tilt adjustment. The troubling part is that you may feel like you’ve locked the steering wheel in place, but if it’s not set at one of the notches, it can move up or down until it hits one — definitely something you don’t want to have happen while driving. The brown faux-wood trim isn’t very realistic, either, but better-looking gray wood-patterned inserts are available.\n\nCloth seats are standard and leather is optional. The leather front bucket seats are surprisingly plush, but not so soft they compromise on support. The tall driving position makes for great forward visibility and decent rear views despite the small rear-quarter windows; I always felt confident changing lanes on the highway and wasn’t worried about missing any small cars in the lane next to me.\n\nThe Veracruz’s 60/40-split second-row seats are roomy and comfortable. The seats slide backward and forward, and the seatbacks recline via a lever on the outer side of either seat cushion — much easier to reach than the handles some manufacturers put at the top of the seatbacks. Access to the third row is possible from either the driver or passenger side; both second-row seat sections slide forward and out of the way. The standard 50/50-split third-row seat offers passable comfort for adults, which bodes well for the most likely users: children.\n\nOther standard features include air conditioning with rear-seat controls, cruise control, heated power side mirrors, a trip computer, a CD stereo and audio buttons on the steering wheel. While Hyundai thinks drivers will increasingly choose aftermarket navigation systems that can be moved from one car to another instead of in-dash units, it’s offering an optional built-in navigation system for the 2008 model year.\n\nA number of upscale options, like a power tilt/telescoping steering wheel, rain-sensing windshield wipers, keyless entry and engine start and metal plates with blue illumination located at the bottom of the door frames, are bundled together in the top-level Veracruz Limited’s optional Ultimate Package. However, some features a buyer might like to add individually — like a sunroof or leather seats — are only available in pricey option packages.\n\nSafety\nStandard safety features include side-impact airbags for the front seats, side curtain airbags for all three rows of seats, an electronic stability system and front-seat active head restraints. Power-adjustable pedals and rear parking sensors are optional, but a rearview camera isn’t an option.\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration awarded the Veracruz its best, five-star rating in its frontal crash test. As of publication, the Veracruz hadn’t been tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.\n\nCargo & Towing\nWith the second- and third-row seats folded flat, the Veracruz has 86.8 cubic feet of cargo room. Cargo room drops to 40 cubic feet when the second-row seats are raised, and 13.4 cubic feet when the third row is up. While the CX-9 and Outlook offer more cargo room whether the seats are up or down, both are also about 10 inches longer than the Veracruz. The Veracruz also has less cargo room than the similarly sized Honda Pilot, especially behind the third row — the Pilot has more than double the space, at 15.9 cubic feet. The Hyundai’s maximum towing capacity is a respectable 3,500 pounds.\n\nVeracruz in the Market\nHyundai got most things right in the Veracruz. It’s a solid start for an all-new model, and that’s what’s required for an automaker to be successful in today’s car market.\n\nTo be sure, there are other good crossovers available, including the ones mentioned here. However, when you look at the Veracruz’s combination of comfort, versatility and a class-leading warranty — all at the right price, the appeal is clear.\n\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "Isn’t it thrilling that we live in a day and age when the line between bargain basement and luxury consumer goods is getting incredibly blurry? Take Target, for example. I remember when places like Kmart, Wal-Mart and Target were considered equally low-end retailers. Since then, Target has risen up, and now (at least amongst my circle of friends) it is the cool place for hip moms to shop for designer clothing and home goods on a budget. You get all of this while sipping a latte from the store’s Starbucks.\n\nThe Hyundai Veracruz is the Target of the automotive world. Don’t get your hopes up, ladies! There isn’t a Starbucks located inside Hyundai’s cars or even its dealerships (although I like that idea). What I’m trying to say is that the Veracruz is much like that sweet pair of Mossimo wedges I recently purchased: Pewter metallic strappy sandals with cork wedges, and they even have a driving heel – how perfect is that? The point I was trying to make before I so rudely allowed myself to get distracted with euphoric fantasies of shoe shopping was that the Veracruz is a budget-esque crossover masquerading as a luxury one. It does so well that I’m going to go out on a limb here and say that the Veracruz is almost as nice (and in some respects even nicer) as the Lexus RX – for a base price of more than $10,000 lower. Meowwww!\n\nDuring my two weeks in the Veracruz, I was surprised by every new feature I uncovered. Initially, I was just thrilled to be driving the first offering from Hyundai with three rows. Imagine how my excitement rose when I slid one of the rear seats forward to climb into the third row and found an incredibly thoughtful handle perfectly placed on the back of the sliding seat for me to grab and hoist myself into the vehicle. The third row, despite being a bit tight, was certainly more comfortable than the sardine-can seat I’m sitting in right now on the airplane while writing this review. While the seat belt receptors in the third row were easy for my kids to buckle on their own, unfortunately, I can’t say the same about the ones in the second row. I ended up having to buckle in my youngest every time.\n\nThe second row seat belt annoyance was quickly forgotten when I found a slew of my favorite car features all standard in the Veracruz, including a backup warning system, power tailgate, a conversation mirror that offers a view of all the rear passengers, steering wheel mounted audio controls, lighted storage compartments and cupholders, a chill zone in the center console to keep my kids’ string cheese cold and – I’m getting way too typeractive here – let me just slow down and collect myself a bit before continuing.\n\nAhhh. Deep breath. Other fabulous features I found in the Veracruz were an available DVD entertainment system with rear controls so capable backseat passengers could play around with it without distracting the driver for instructions. I also appreciated the under-floor storage bin in the cargo area, good rear visibility and luxuriously tactile fit and finish inside the vehicle.\n\nThe main thing that I think would make the Hyundai Veracruz – and, honestly, any Hyundai for that matter – any better would be for them to be on sale at Target. Stick with me on this for a moment. Hyundai could be the next designer brand to pair up with Target. Imagine a world where you could drive up to one store and purchase a new convertible five-point harness to replace the one with the inexplicable odor emanating from it (despite washing the cover three times), a hand vacuum that plugs into a car’s cigarette lighter to suck up the endless supply of loose Cheerios, and the car to put these things into. All this while sipping a latte from the store’s Starbucks kiosk.\n\n*For more information on the Hyundai Veracruz and its safety features, visit Cars.com.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThough Hyundai likes to compare the Veracruz crossover to luxury models like the Lexus RX 350, shoppers will likely size it against less expensive offerings such as the Honda Pilot and Toyota Highlander. The Veracruz seats seven in three rows and has numerous standard safety features. The base GLS and upper-crust Limited are the two trim levels offered, and a 3.8-liter V-6 is standard. All-wheel drive is optional.\n\nNew for 2011\nOther than changes to the base model’s Premium Package of options, there are no significant changes.\n\nExterior\nSwooping curves and two-tone bodywork define the Veracruz, which emulates styling themes set by Hyundai’s other crossovers, like the Santa Fe. Exterior features include:\n\n\nStandard 17-inch wheels\nChrome window and grille surrounds\nStandard heated side mirrors with integrated turn signals\nStandard rear parking sensors\nOptional moonroof\nOptional power liftgate\nOptional 18-inch wheels\n\nInterior\nThe Veracruz’s seating arrangement includes front bucket seats, a three-person second-row bench seat and a two-person third row. GLS models have fabric seats, but the uplevel Limited trim gets leather upholstery. Blue backlighting illuminates the instruments, dashboard controls and cupholders. Interior features include:\n\n\nSecond row can slide forward to ease access to the third row\nThird-row seat folds into the floor\nAir-conditioning controls for rear passengers\nOptional power tilt/telescoping steering column (manual tilt/telescoping standard)\nOptional household power outlet\nOptional backseat entertainment system\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Veracruz’s 3.8-liter V-6 sees duty in a number of Hyundais, including the Azera full-size sedan. EPA fuel-economy estimates for the front-wheel-drive Veracruz are 17/23 mpg city/highway and all-wheel-drive models are rated at 16/22 mpg. Mechanical features include:\n\n\n260 horsepower, 257 pounds-feet of torque\nV-6 runs on regular gas\nSix-speed automatic transmission with manual control\nOptional all-wheel-drive system includes lock mode that splits torque 50:50, front to rear, at low speeds\n\nSafety\nStandard safety features include:\n\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes\nElectronic stability system\nSide-impact airbags for front seats\nSide curtain airbags for all three rows\nActive front head restraints",
