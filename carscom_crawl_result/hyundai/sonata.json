      "expert_review": "The verdict: The updated 2024 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid pairs an intuitive multimedia system with good fuel economy and great ride comfort in a car that’s easy and enjoyable to drive for long distances.\n\nVersus the competition: The Sonata Hybrid isn’t trying to be a sports sedan, which pays dividends in its ride comfort and drivability.\n\nThe 2024 Hyundai Sonata mid-size sedan is updated for 2024 with new styling on the outside, new technology on the inside and the welcome addition of wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto on all trim levels. The updated Sonata’s lineup has been simplified, with some trim levels dropped, but multiple gasoline-only engine options remain, as well as an efficient gasoline-electric hybrid powertrain with an EPA fuel-economy rating of 47 mpg combined.\n\nRelated: Refreshed 2024 Hyundai Sonata (Finally) Priced From $28,615\n\nFor this review, I drove a 2024 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid Limited, the top trim level, that stickered at $38,560 (including destination). SEL Hybrid and gasoline-only SEL and turbocharged N Line versions are also available. During my test, I tracked my fuel economy over 200 miles of driving the Sonata as I would in everyday life, including carting around two kids in child-safety seats and grocery store runs. We also measured cargo space and tested child-safety seat fitment.\n\nSonata Hybrid MPG and Performance\n\nThe 2024 Sonata Hybrid’s 47 mpg combined EPA rating is unchanged from the 2023 figure, though its city rating dropped 1 mpg, to 44 mpg. (The previous Sonata Hybrid Blue trim level, which was rated 52 mpg combined, is no longer available.)\n\nI didn’t find it hard to coax efficiency from the Sonata Hybrid while driving normally, though I was initially disappointed by the low reported fuel economy displayed on the onboard trip computer. The Sonata’s trip computer read an average of 41.8 mpg, but in 201.6 miles of driving the Sonata Hybrid it used 4.37 gallons of gas, which calculates to 46.1 mpg. It cost $18.46 to drive those 201.6 miles, which isn’t bad at all considering the lower number the trip computer was spitting out.\n\nWhat was really interesting, however, was seeing the 600 miles of estimated driving range on the Sonata Hybrid’s instrument cluster when the tank was full. Maybe it’s because I’ve been driving a lot of electric vehicles, where 300 miles of range is impressive, but the thought of going 600 miles between refueling stops seems really convenient.\n\n2024 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nBetween fill-ups, driving this Hyundai is a showcase of refinement; you’ll hardly be able to tell it’s a hybrid. The powertrain transitions from electric operation to gasoline power with barely a shudder, and the electric power fills in the gaps of the gasoline engine and the somewhat lackluster operation of the six-speed automatic transmission. Acceleration, however, isn’t as seamless as in the new hybrid-only 2025 Toyota Camry, which is most evident when you call upon the Hyundai’s engine to pass. The Sonata’s responsiveness is hampered by its six-speed automatic, which is often hesitant or slow to downshift. It’s very different from the 2025 Toyota Camry, a hybrid that seamlessly switches from driving with vigor and responsiveness to becoming an eco-friendly commuter via its different driving modes; the Camry Hybrid also uses an electronic continuously variable automatic transmission.\n\nVersus its hybrid competitors’ combined fuel-economy ratings, the Sonata matches the roughly equivalent Camry XLE’s 47 mpg and does slightly better than the 2024 Honda Accord Touring’s 44 mpg. Determining which hybrid is right for you will involve looking into deeper differences, like ride comfort, pricing and interior technology.\n\nInterior Comfort and Cargo Room\n\nThe 2024 Sonata’s interior is dimensionally unchanged from 2023, which is to say surprisingly roomy considering its sleek, fastback-like shape. The Sonata’s driving experience is decidedly car-like, and it was refreshing to sit low to the ground in a sleek sedan versus riding up high in an SUV (though that opinion might be in the minority these days). I was happy with the Sonata’s front seating position, though I had to move the seat pretty far down to get comfortable, and the headliner still brushed the top of my hair when I got in.\n\nIn the backseat, I had a comfortable amount of space between my head and the top of the interior, though anyone taller than my 6-foot frame would probably feel the pinch of the sloping rear roofline. What the sleek shape doesn’t do, surprisingly, is hurt visibility; there’s a lot of glass behind you that helps over-the-shoulder visibility, and the Limited trim has a number of electronic aids that help some more, including a blind spot camera system as well as a traditional blind spot warning system and rear cross-traffic alert, which watches for cars approaching from either side while backing out of a parking space.\n\nI was surprised how easy it was to install car seats in the Sonata considering its sleek shape and sedan configuration. My kids’ forward-facing convertible seat and high-back booster had no issues with fitment or ease of installation.\n\nIn Cars.com’s cargo testing, we measured 19.8 cubic feet of trunk space, which is similar to what competitors offer; the 2023 Honda Accord Hybrid has 20.8 cubic feet of measured trunk space, while the 2023 Toyota Camry Hybrid has 20 cubic feet.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nTechnology\n\nRefreshed exterior styling aside, the most notable changes in the 2024 Sonata are the new displays on the inside, including a standard curved display that consists of two screens: a digital gauge cluster in front of the driver and a 12.3-inch center dashboard touchscreen. In standard configuration, the digital gauge cluster has limited configurability and a 4.2-inch instrument panel with selectable readouts, while the optional 12.3-inch instrument panel is configurable and is a larger display than the standard display. With the optional 12.3-inch instrument panel, these displays are high-quality, vibrant and feature an easy-to-use interface — and I give the Sonata bonus points for having volume and tuning knobs; the Camry and Accord lack a tuning knob.\n\nMost notably, the 2024 Sonata corrects a longstanding issue for Hyundai: Wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto have not been available with its cars’ larger-screen multimedia systems for some time. Wireless smartphone integration is now standard across the lineup, while wireless phone charging is optional on the base gas-only SEL trim but standard on all other gasoline and hybrid trim levels.\n\nThe most controversial change on the 2024 Sonata is the inclusion of touch-sensitive controls for the climate system, the heated and ventilated front seats, and the heated steering wheel. We’re generally not fans of this style of controls because they lack tactile feedback and are thus hard to use while driving, as well as inconsistent in operation; thankfully, there are still physical dials for temperature control. It’s not likely to be a deal breaker for most buyers, but they are annoying to use while driving. Be sure to get a feel for them (or really their lack of feel) while on a test drive; if it is a deal breaker for you, know that competitors like the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry retain physical controls for these functions.\n\nLess controversial but still different is the Sonata’s new twist-stalk gear selector that’s mounted on the steering column. Its operation is different from many other gear selectors, but I’ve found it to have almost zero learning curve, and I appreciate the space it frees up for center console storage. It’s a definite improvement over the car’s previous push-button gear selector.\n\nSafety\n\nThe 2024 Hyundai Sonata earns Top Safety Pick status from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. It missed out on the highest Top Safety Pick+ designation by earning a score of poor (on a scale of good, acceptable, marginal and poor) in the agency’s updated moderate overlap frontal crash test, in which a rear occupant dummy experienced forces that indicates a likelihood of injuries to the head, neck and chest. The 2024 Toyota Camry (not the redesigned version) is also an IIHS Top Safety Pick, while the 2024 Honda Accord earned the highest Top Safety Pick+ designation.\n\nStandard safety features include:\n\nForward collision warning with automatic emergency braking\nRear cross-traffic alert\nBlind spot warning\nLane departure steering assist\nLane-centering steering\nRear occupant alert\nVersus Toyota Camry and Honda Accord Hybrids\n\nWe won’t name a winner until we do a proper head-to-head-to-head comparison, but I did observe some notable differences between the Sonata Hybrid and the Camry and Accord hybrids. For one, the Sonata is decidedly tuned for comfort, with a soft suspension and relatively tiny 17-inch wheels, which I found refreshing compared with something like the Honda Accord, which is tuned for more athletic driving and has the ride stiffness to complete its mission. The Camry straddles the line between the two. Hyundai says it’s made improvements to reduce noise, vibration and harshness with body reinforcements.\n\nI favored the Sonata’s large 12.3-inch touchscreen over the Camry’s and Accord’s systems. I preferred Hyundai’s clarity and intuitive user interface, though I never came around to its touch-sensitive climate controls. Another mark against the Sonata Hybrid is its six-speed automatic transmission, which puts a damper on the acceleration experience when you need to pass; the Accord’s and Camry’s powertrains are much more eager to call upon power. Lastly, if you want a hybrid with all-wheel drive, there’s only one option: the Camry. The gas-only Sonata is available with all-wheel drive but the hybrid isn’t, while the Accord is front-wheel-drive only.\n\nIn June, the 2024 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid’s median listing price on Cars.com was $33,009, with 2,519 examples flowing through our site. That’s less than the Honda Accord Hybrid’s $35,120 median price, as well as far fewer listings than the 11,550 Accord Hybrids we saw, suggesting the Sonata Hybrid may be harder to find depending on where you live. The Sonata’s pricing is more in line with pricing we’ve seen for the 2025 Camry, which had a median price of $33,393 and inventory of 12,729.\n\nWhat all of this means is that what’s right for you may not come down to size, fuel economy or price, but rather to smaller details, like how the vehicles drive and how you interact with their controls. Either way, the updated 2024 Sonata deserves a spot in the conversation alongside the ubiquitous Camry and Accord, because this Hyundai combines good fuel economy with great ride comfort and easy-to-use technology.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2024 Hyundai Sonata Vs. 2025 Kia K5 Vs. 2025 Toyota Camry: Auto Show Faceoff\n2024 Hyundai Sonata Up Close: The Family Sedan, Sportified\nRefreshed 2024 Hyundai Sonata (Finally) Priced From $28,615\nRedesigned 2024 Hyundai Sonata Embraces Curves Inside and Out\nHyundai Outlines 2024 Sonata Powertrains, Sheds Light on New Tech\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Key Points:\n\nThe 2026 Sonata starts at $28,545, $400 more than the 2025 model, and the Sonata Hybrid costs $30,295 (all prices include $1,245 destination fee).\nHyundai has introduced the new SEL Sport and Blue Hybrid trims for the Sonata.\n\nThe Hyundai Sonata sedan rolls into the 2026 model year with a trim-level shake up. The base 2026 Sonata starts at $28,545, and Hyundai has merged the SEL and SEL Convenience trims into the SEL Sport on the gas-only model. A new entry-level Blue trim lowers the price of the hybrid to $30,295.\n\nRelated: 2025 Hyundai Sonata N Line Review: Banish Boring\n\nWhat’s New?\n\nThe trim shakeup in the Sonata lineup results in a few new features for certain trims, such as wireless phone charging, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and 18-inch alloy wheels on the SEL Sport; it’s the only variant that can be optioned with all-wheel drive.\n\nThe most noteworthy change happens in the Sonata Hybrid. The Hybrid Blue is the new, less expensive entry point, and it returns a Hyundai-estimated 51 mpg combined (the other hybrid variants top out at 47 mpg combined, though official EPA estimates for 2026 are not yet available).\n\nPricing and Release Date\n\nThe 2026 Hyundai Sonata and Sonata Hybrid are on sale now. Full pricing for the lineup is as follows, with 2025 prices in parentheses:\n\nSonata\nSE: $28,545 ($28,145)\nSEL Sport: $30,245 (new)\nN Line: $37,145 ($36,745)\nSonata Hybrid\nBlue: $30,295 (new)\nSEL: $33,545 ($32,495)\nLimited: $39,345 ($38,945)\nSafety Features and Trim Levels\n\nEvery 2026 Sonata comes with a comprehensive suite of driver-assist tech, including forward collision warning with pedestrian and bicyclist detection, intersection assist that watches for oncoming traffic during turns, automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, blind spot monitors, rear cross-traffic alert with automatic braking, lane departure steering assist, lane-centering steering, driver attention warning, automatic high beams, safe exit assist and a rear-seat reminder.\n\nThe base Sonata SE has 16-inch aluminum wheels, LED front and rear lighting, and keyless entry and start. It’s upholstered in cloth and has manually adjustable front seats, as well as a 12.3-inch touchscreen with satellite radio and wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay.\n\nThe new SEL Sport blends the features of the discontinued SEL and SEL Convenience. It rolls on 18-inch alloy wheels and has heated side mirrors, a power driver’s seat, heated front seats, dual-zone automatic climate control and wireless phone charging. It also comes with a column-mounted gear shifter and paddle shifters.\n\nThe N Line builds off the features of the SEL Sport but rides on 19-inch wheels and has unique front and rear exterior styling, a quad-outlet exhaust, rear spoiler and revised steering. It has a panoramic moonroof, 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster, navigation, synthetic-leather sport seats, aluminum pedals, ambient lighting, a 12-speaker Bose audio system and Digital Key 2.0, which allows the owner to use a paired smartphone as the vehicle key.\n\nThe Blue Hybrid mirrors the features of the base SE, while the SEL Hybrid mostly matches the SEL Sport in content, except the hybrid has a panoramic moonroof.\n\nThe loaded Limited Hybrid has 17-inch wheels but upgrades inside to leather upholstery and adds the 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster, navigation, heated and ventilated front seats, a 12-speaker Bose audio system, a 360-degree camera system, blind spot cameras, automated parking, a head-up display and rain-sensing windshield wipers.\n\nRead More About the Hyundai Sonata:\n\nIs the 2025 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid a Good Car? 6 Pros, 3 Cons\nWhich Used Cars Have the Best Crash-Test Scores?\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2025 Hyundai Sonata?\nWhat Are the Best Used Cars for $20,000?\nResearch the Hyundai Sonata\nPowertrain Specs and MPG\n\nThe 2026 Sonata can be had in three different powertrains: a gas-only 2.5-liter four-cylinder, a turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder and a 2.0-liter four-cylinder hybrid.\n\nThe base Sonata SE and new SEL Sport use the carryover 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine that makes 191 horsepower and 181 pounds-feet of torque.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nHyundai redesigned the Sonata for 1999, giving it more room, more noticeable styling and a pair of new engines. The results have been gratifying for South Korea’s largest auto company: Sonata sales nearly doubled in 1999.\n\nPart of the appeal may be Hyundai’s industry-leading warranties, launched last year. Hyundai covers the whole car for five years/60,000 miles, major powertrain components for 10 years/100,000 miles and corrosion for five years/100,000 miles. The company also provides free roadside assistance the first five years.\n\nThe front-drive Sonata is the largest model in Hyundai’s U.S. lineup, though there is speculation a larger sedan is planned for 2001.\n\nExterior\nHyundai gave the Sonata a lower, sleeker look last year, accenting the front end with prominent oval headlamps and the rear with an arched trunk lid and large taillights. At 185 inches, the Sonata is a few inches shorter than the Toyota Camry or Honda Accord.\n\nInterior\nThough the Sonata is shorter than either the Camry or Accord, it is wider than both at 71.6 inches. That gives rear seat passengers more room to spread out, and three can fit with some squeezing. Headroom and legroom are at least adequate for six footers. Trunk space looks larger than the 13.2 cubic feet quoted by Hyundai, and the split rear seatback folds for extra room.\n\nHyundai tries to compete with Toyota and Honda by offering more features at a lower price. Standard equipment on the base model includes air conditioning, a cassette player, and power windows, locks and mirrors.\n\nUnder the Hood\nBase models come with a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine that produces 149 horsepower, but the majority of sales are GLS versions with a 170 horsepower, 2.5-liter V-6. Manual and automatic transmissions are available with both. Anti-lock brakes are optional on the GLS.\n\nSafety\nSonata was one of the first cars under $20,000 to offer side-impact airbags, and this year they are standard on both the base and GLS. The front airbag for the passenger seat does not deploy if a weight sensor detects less than 66 pounds. If there is less than 33 pounds in the front passenger seat, the side airbag does not deploy either.\n\nPerformance\nPoor quality on earlier models deterred many buyers from even considering a Hyundai. The quality is getting better, and the Sonata’s performance is competent enough to compare to the class-leading Camry and Accord. Resale value still doesn’t match Toyota’s or Honda’s, but Hyundai’s lower prices and longer warranties make the Sonata worth considering.\n\n \n\nReported by Rick Popely  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2000 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "There’s one overwhelming reason for you to look at the redesigned 1997 Hyundai Sonata, which otherwise barely stands out in a crowded field of competent family sedans.\n\nPrice.\n\nIf you want to buy a mid-level Ford Taurus, Honda Accord or Toyota Camry with a V-6 engine and most of the options that come standard on the ’97 Sonata GL, plan on spending well over $20,000. You’ll only have to shell out $18,000 for a Sonata equipped like our test car. Which raises the obvious question: Is the Sonata a true bargain?\n\nShe: If the Taurus looks like a catfish, the Sonata resembles a Disney cartoon heroine to me. Especially Pocahontas or the Princess in Aladdin. Look at the headlights. They start out nice and round, and then swoop up toward the corners like someone going a little heavy on the eyeliner. Definitely the car’s most notable feature. And something that caused a lot of passers-by to ask me, “What’s that car?”\n\nHe: I know some catfish who might be insulted by your reference to the Taurus. And the Disney comparison sounds a little wacko to me. I agree that the Sonata’s headlights are catchy, not necessarily cartoonish, and I think they’re terrific. Just think of how bland the noses of the Accord and Camry look alongside the Sonata, especially with the stylish grille that’s been inset on the ’97 model. This car looks good from almost any angle – not boring, not garish, but quite distinctive.\n\nShe: The Sonata’s improvements go beyond the cosmetic stuff, though. Besides rebending the sheet metal front and rear, Hyundai revised the cabin. While they were at it, they paid a lot of attention to reducing road and engine noise by adding extra insulation and sound-deadening materials.\n\nHe: Funny thing. Hyundai, in its press material, talks about how the doors are now flush-fitting and the mirrors were redesigned to minimize wind noise. Unfortunately, the reality is that this is still one noisy car, especially over 60 mph.\n\nShe: Before you decide to run out to your nearest Hyundai dealer, another word of warning. The GL we tested was among the most hard-starting vehicles we’ve ever been in. Didn’t matter if the engine was hot or cold. It usually took at least five or six seconds of steady cranking before it would turn over. It never failed to start, but it sure gave me a little feeling of anxiety.\n\nAnd one thing Hyundai didn’t fix from the ’96 model is the automatic transmission, which still lurches when you shift from reverse to drive. Picture yourself backing out of the driveway and then getting a mini-whiplash sensation as you throw the shift lever into drive. Not enough to see the chiropractor, but enough to make you mutter under your breath.\n\nHe: You usually make me mutter under my breath. But there’s no excuse for not fixing that transmission, which has been a major annoyance for several years. I was equally surprised by the rough trim on the steering wheel.\n\nYou could grasp the botto m of the wheel and feel the flashing – the thin ridge of plastic – left from the mold. Tacky. And not what you’d expect to find on an otherwise decent-looking family sedan in this price bracket.\n\nShe: On the positive side, there’s other stuff you wouldn’t expect to find standard on a mid-level family sedan. You really feel like you’re getting something for your money when air conditioning, AM-FM stereo cassette, power door locks, mirrors and windows are just a few of the standard items on the Sonata GL. This may be the nicest Korean car we’ve driven, despite its flaws.\n\nYet I would still recommend a base Taurus over the Sonata, if all you have to spend is $18,000. You’ll be swapping the Sonata’s standard features for Taurus’ solid feel and reputation.\n\nHe: On the mechanical side, Sonata’s all-independent suspension has a pretty plush ride.\n\nFront and rear stabilizer bars keep the car firmly planted when you’re whipping through turns, and the steering feels ligh nd not overly assisted.\n\nI’d recommend the optional 15-inch tires and wheels for an even smoother ride. We crabbed about the automatic transmission, which outside of that absurd lurching is otherwise fairly smooth.\n\nThe optional V-6 engine is merely adequate, however, and doesn’t make nearly as much power as the sixes in many of its competitors. In fact, it only delivers 5 more horsepower than the base twin-cam 2.0-liter four-cylinder. Fuel economy is not much better than middle of the road, either, at 18 miles per gallon in the city and 24 on the highway.\n\nShe: The Sonata has ample head, leg and shoulder room for front and rear passengers – within an inch or two of the Taurus, Camry and Accord. And visibility is quite good in all directions. We noticed the Sonata comes with four-wheel power disc brakes, which are more expensive and grip better than drum brakes, but ABS is still an extra-cost option.\n\nHe: An option that we didn’t have on our test car. Sorry, Princess. Maybe you want to take a closer look at that “catfish.”\n\n1997 Hyundai Sonata GL\n\nType: Front-engine, front-wheel drive, five-passenger mid-size sedan.\n\nPrice: Base, $17,349; as tested, $18,207 (inc. $415 destination charge).\n\nWhat’s new for ’97: Redesigned exterior, revised rear suspension.\n\nStandard equipment: Air conditioning, AM-FM stereo cassette, center console, dual cupholders, rear defogger, dual visor vanity mirrors, split fold-down rear seat, tilt steering column, tinted glass, intermittent wipers, power four-wheel disc brakes, power door locks, power mirrors, power windows.\n\nSafety features: Dual air bags, childproof rear door locks, antilock brakes (optional).\n\nOptions on test vehicle: Package No. 06, inc. cruise control and arm rest ($365); carpeted floor mats ($78).\n\nEPA fuel economy: 18 mpg city/24 mpg highway.\n\nEngine: 3.0-liter V-6; 142-hp at 5000 rpm; 168 lb-ft torque at 2500 rpm.\n\nTransmission: Four-speed automatic.\n\nCompetitors: Toyota Camry, Honda Accord, Nissan Altima, Mitsubishi Galant, Mazda 626, Subaru Legacy, Volkswagen Passat, Ford Taurus, Mercury Sable, DodgeStratus, Plymouth Breeze, Chrysler Cirrus, Chevrolet Malibu, Pontiac Grand Prix, Buick Century, Oldsmobile Cutlass.\n\nSpecifications: Wheelbase, 106.3 inches; overall length, 185.0 inches; curb weight, 3072 pounds; legroom, 43.3 inches front/36.6 inches rear; headroom, 38.5 inches front/37.7 inches rear; shoulder room, 58.2 inches front/56.4 inches rear.\n\n12-month insurance cost, according to AAA Michigan: $1,229\n\nRates based on an average family of four from the Livonia area whose primary driver is age 40 with no tickets who drives 3-10 miles each way to work.

      "expert_review": "The 1995 Sonata represents a high point in engineering for Hyundai Motor Co. of South Korea.\n\nWhile the company has been known as a builder of inexpensive cars, it has been working on technology. It all comes together in its latest Sonata base, GL and GLS family sedans.\n\nHyundai gave its engineers complete freedom to develop new models, and the results are both aesthetically pleasing and technically advanced.\n\nThe car has a new exterior, a new platform and a redesigned suspension system, along with refinements to the drivetrain and interior. These add up to an all-new automobile.\n\n“Hyundai is going to be a major force in the marketplace,” said Jim Webb, general manager of Butler Hyundai-Suzuki. “Originally they built no-frills cars, but now they’re concentrating on quality, style and technology at affordable prices.”\n\nThese days everyone is forming body lines around an aerodynamic theme, but some lines are better than others and the 1995 Sonata moves toward the front of its class.\n\nAccording to Hyundai Motor America, the new model offers more interior room than any vehicle in its class. Quietness is enhanced and the ride improved with a 20 percent stiffer body than the 1994 model.\n\nI think Hyundai has done a really excellent job of developing this extremely rigid body shell and its attendant suspension system.\n\nTo improve the ride and handling, engineers followed a proven path of creating a longer wheelbase and a wider track for the wheels. You don’t have to be a graduate of MIT to understand that a limousine rides better than a stubby econobox.\n\nThe wheelbase has been increased a full three inches to 106.3 inches, a length that knocks on the door of some decidedly upscale American and European products.\n\nTo give the sedan a more aggressive stance, the track has been widened from 58.3 inches to 59.6 in front, and from 57.5 inches to 59.l at the rear.\n\nAt the same time, engineers made another smart move by lowering the center of gravity and improving the front-to-rear weight distribution.\n\nThe weight distribution is now 60 percent front/40 percent rear for the front-wheel-drive car. The weight bias over the front wheels assures maximum traction on slippery surfaces and stability when going fast.\n\nHandling with the four-wheel independent suspension is enhanced by a negative offset in the front wheels to reduce a tendency to rise under acceleration and dive under braking.\n\nThe Sonata’s performance is going to be pretty decent, whether in four-cylinder form or with the V6 that is optional with the GL and standard in the GLS.\n\nThe in-line 4 is a 2.0- liter (122-cubic inch), 16-valve engine that produces 137 horsepower. The V6, despite being a 3.0-liter (182 cubic inches, 2,972 c.c), is rated at only five more horsepower. However, there’s quite a difference in torque.\n\nThe V6 is rated at 168 foot-pounds of torque, 40 more than the dual-cam 4, and that’s what makes it possible to move away from stoplights in a hurry.\n\nThere is, however, a lot of speed to the dual-cam 4 vs. the single-overhead- cam V6, as the 137 horsepower comes in at 6,000 rpm compared to the V6’s 142 horsepower at 5,000 rpm. With higher gear ratios for the final drive, a GL or GLS V6 probably is going to be a little faster than a base Sonata, but not by much.\n\nBut most buyers of the three models won’t care. The car is designed as a family sedan, and marketing demographics indicate buyers tend to be about 35 years old up to middle age.\n\n“We sell about an equal number of all three models,” Webb said. “It would be difficult to classify any one of the three as being the best seller.\n\n“Buyers are middle class, are from about 35 to around 50, and have been priced out of the market by our competitors.”\n\nThe base Sonata has air conditioning, a stereo and other sundry equipment as standard for just a little more than $13,000. A GLS carrying everything the company makes will be a touch under $18,000.\n\n“The market today is driven by price and qual ity,” Webb said. “And with this new car, we can offer both.”\n\n1995 Hyundai Sonata Base price: $13,399.Type: Front-engine, front-drive, five-passenger, midsized sedan.Engine: 2.0 liters, DOHC in-line 4, 16 valves, fuel-injected, 137 horsepower, 129 foot-pounds of torque.Transmission: Five-speed manual.Mileage: 21 mpg city/29 mpg highway.Wheelbase: 106.3 inches.Length: 185.0 inches.Width: 69.7 inches.Height: 55.3 inches.Curb weight: 2,864 pounds.Options: Automatic transmission.",

      "expert_review": "When certain types of products become less popular, the manufacturers that don’t abandon them altogether sometimes starve them of resources and hasten their decline by focusing on more popular product types. Apply this reality to today’s automotive market, and the less popular style is the mid-size sedan, where manufacturers who have abandoned them or are in the process are Chrysler, Dodge and Ford, and there will be more. As for the sedan models being starved of resources, I’m not naming any models yet, but we have our eyes on a few, and it’s inevitable.\n\nA day of driving the redesigned 2020 Hyundai Sonata proved the model that made Hyundai’s name in the U.S. and beyond isn’t one of them. If anything, the company has doubled down on its “carness” by reverting to the sleeker styling that was a big hit in the U.S. from 2011 to 2014 (but less so in the home market of South Korea) before a 2015 redesign delivered a superior car with what Americans deemed an inferior look. (If there’s anything American consumers don’t like, it’s a product that doesn’t stir them emotionally regardless of how objectively good it might be.)\n\nRelated: Hyundai Brings the Fight to Camry, Accord With Redesigned 2020 Sonata\n\nThe new Sonata even heralds the rollouts of such important features as the option to use a smartphone as a key, the ability to move the car forward and back while standing outside of it, and the Hyundai brand’s first driver profiles and true lane-centering steering feature. How much Hyundai’s devotion to the Sonata will cost buyers, however, remains unknown as of publication, because it’s early (or perhaps Hyundai’s late). I traveled to Montgomery, Ala., the home of Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama, where the last of the 2019 Sonatas rolled off the factory floor recently and the start of 2020 production will begin a few weeks hence. I drove only pre-production versions of the top trim level, the Limited, so we’ll have to follow up in a few months with more details on the lesser trims and base engine. (Per our ethics policy, Cars.com pays for its own lodging and transportation at such automaker sponsored events.)\n\n2020 Hyundai Sonata | Cars.com photo by Joe Wiesenfelder\n\nBeing the top trim, the Limited had many exclusive features, including a 360-degree camera system, blind spot cameras, Matrix-style LED headlights, leather upholstery as standard, a four-way power passenger seat, parking sensors, ventilated front seats, the Sonata’s first head-up display, a leatherette (imitation leather) dashboard and other features called out below.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThe 2020 Sonata Limited drives nicely, especially on the quality pavement around Montgomery, and its behavior over the shockingly few instances of broken pavement I was able to find, as well as over railroad tracks, suggests that it will prove comfortable even on the mean streets of Cars.com’s hometown of Chicago, be it with the as-equipped 18-inch alloy wheels, the 17s of the SEL or the 16-inch alloys of the Sonata SE.\n\n2020 Hyundai Sonata | Cars.com photo by Joe Wiesenfelder\n\nThe car also handles competently, and while I wouldn’t say it feels sporty, it seems to deliver more than adequately for the likely buyer. This is a new platform, and Hyundai’s suspension design has come a long, long way since the generation people went craziest about, so it’s not something I’d worry about as a shopper.\n\nAs for power, I experienced only the engine that comes in the SEL Plus and Limited, which is rated 180 horsepower and 195 pounds-feet of torque. It drives the front wheels through an eight-speed automatic transmission. It had modest power off the line but proved adept at moving the car forward incrementally once in motion without a lot of downshifting. Credit goes to the torque availability; torque, the instantaneous force that gets the car moving, peaks from 1,500 to 4,500 rpm. With all of the gears in play nowadays, sometimes the lag and hunting can be a drag, and Hyundai isn’t immune to this, as we said of the otherwise top-rated, 2019 Mid-Size SUV Challenge-winning 2019 Santa Fe Ultimate 2.0T.\n\nSo, not having to downshift as much is a plus. Fortunately, when it did have to do so, the eight-speed was pretty well behaved. Overall, power is serviceable but not exceptional, especially for a higher trim level. Oddly, though its torque is impressive, this engine’s 180 hp is lower than the base engine’s 191 hp. It’s horsepower that translates to quickness, so the base engine might prove quicker, especially as it’s pushing lighter trim levels (specs aren’t available yet, but fewer features means less weight). The base engine’s torque is rated at 181 pounds-feet, but at a peak of 4,000 rpm rather than the Limited’s broad 1,500-4,500 rpm.\n\n2020 Hyundai Sonata | Cars.com photo by Joe Wiesenfelder\n\nI didn’t lead with engine sizes partly because we’re getting to where it doesn’t matter like it used to. The output specs are far more important. The engine I drove is a reengineered version of the turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder previously used on the Eco trim level. The base engine on the SE and SEL is also new, now a 2.5-liter four-cylinder (it was formerly 2.4-liter). Both engines carry the name Smartstream and use regular gasoline. The EPA hasn’t tested them yet, but Hyundai estimates combined ratings of 33 mpg for the 2.5-liter and 31 mpg for the 1.6-liter. The 33-mpg figure would mark a 4-mpg improvement over the 2019 Sonata SE’s 2.4-liter.\n\nIf these engines seem oddly close to each other in output and oddly low when competitors offer well over 200 to 300 hp in their optional engines, you’re not wrong. Missing is the 2019’s optional turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that produced 245 hp. It’s not coming back, but an N-Line version of the Sonata reportedly will, at an undetermined time, bringing considerably more than 245 hp with it. The Sonata Hybrid is also slated to return but will be a late addition to the 2020 model year.\n\nHow It Drives Itself\n\nHyundai has already been doing good work in the area of driver-assistance features like forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking and pedestrian detection, lane keep assist and adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability. Now it has an umbrella term for them (like most competitors), SmartSense technology, along with a new advancement for the Sonata.\n\nWe’ve long noted that the Hyundai (and Genesis) Lane Keeping Assist feature — ostensibly a lane departure prevention system, which in competing vehicles may pinball the car left and right between lane markings — actually centers the vehicles in the lane better than some competitors that have features called lane-centering. Finally, Hyundai has a feature it thinks is good enough to classify as lane-centering, which it has named Lane Follow Assist. I’d like to say it’s even better, but I didn’t notice much difference on gently curved roads, having been pretty impressed already with LKA — but I’m glad Hyundai’s comfortable.\n\nCombine this with Highway Drive Assist, which uses GPS to determine the vehicle is on a divided highway with vehicles moving in the same direction, and you have a very effective semi-autonomous experience where the car accelerates, brakes and steers, requiring infrequent assurance from the driver. (These features do work on other roads, but the driver’s required to interact more.) If you haven’t braved an urban commute with the assistance of an aid like this, you don’t know what you’re missing. These features are standard on all trim levels. Only enhancements like Rear Cross-Traffic Collision-Avoidance Assist is exclusive to the Limited, and Blind-Spot Collision Avoidance Assist is excluded from the Sonata SE.\n\nThe Return to Carness\n\nYou will decide within milliseconds whether the new styling works for you, so I won’t belabor the description, but there are some key features and consequences from the change. It has grown by 1.4 inches in wheelbase and 1.8 inches in overall length, but there’s some incremental shrinking as well, most notably a loss of 1.2 inches of height. The chrome strips that have run from either headlight along the fenders all the way to the back of the rear quarter windows since 2011 (named the Dynamic Lasso when it encircled the side windows) now begin inboard of the headlight clusters and have been laser-perforated to serve as daytime running lights that revert to chrome when the lights are off — pretty cool.\n\n2020 Hyundai Sonata | Cars.com photo by Joe Wiesenfelder\n\nThe completely reimagined rear end now has a trunkwide taillight segment joining side lenses that are integral to the lip spoiler. The lenses are topped by small fins. Don’t like them? Tough. They’re an aerodynamic element called vortex generators that break up the air as it separates from the moving car and prevents an efficiency-robbing low-pressure zone behind the car.\n\n2020 Hyundai Sonata | Cars.com photo by Joe Wiesenfelder\n\nFortunately, someone told us how to open the trunk from the lid without the key fob, or I’d still be in ’Bama.\n\n2020 Hyundai Sonata | Cars.com photo by Joe Wiesenfelder\n\nSpeaking of getting into the Sonata, if you’re a Hyundai owner, you’re aware that to get into one using keyless access, you’ve always had to push a button on the door to unlock it first, even though many competing brands let you just grab the handle when the key fob is nearby. That changes with the 2020, which makes the jump to the one-step grab-and-open approach. To lock, you press the recessed part of the handle as on some other brands.\n\n2020 Hyundai Sonata | Manufacturer image\n\nAs if to make up for being late to this party, Hyundai jumped ahead with Digital Key, which lets your Android smartphone serve as a key. More than just an optional substitute for a keyless remote, Digital Key marks the first time the Sonata will support driver profiles, which some vehicles tie to a key fob but Hyundai never has. The profile can remember things like seat and mirror memory settings and audio presets, and Digital Key will support three of them. One of the neatest features is that each of these phone owners can share access with other people without handing over keys; anyone with the app can be granted access to get in and/or drive, under time or driving restrictions set by the profile owner.\n\n2020 Hyundai Sonata | Manufacturer image\n\nIt works just like a key fob, for the same functions and from comparable distances, using Bluetooth Low Energy. But to unlock the car without pushing the button, you have to hold it up to the outside door handle where near-field communication does the job. One way or the other, you’re taking the phone out of your pocket, which is a step back from the typical keyless access approach that lets you leave the fob in your pocket; on the other hand, you’re more likely to be holding your phone than a key fob.\n\nTesla was the first to offer this functionality on the Model 3 and doesn’t require the phone to be held to the door, but Hyundai says BLE’s range is much farther than that of a key fob’s keyless-access feature (30 feet or more) and as a result isn’t as secure as the company requires. Like Tesla, Hyundai provides NFC cards (like hotel key cards) as a backup to get you into the car, identify you and start the engine in case your phone dies.\n\n2020 Hyundai Sonata | Cars.com photo by Joe Wiesenfelder\n\nAs for iPhones, they do include NFC technology, but Apple reserves it for apps such as Apple Pay. Hyundai and other companies are pressuring the tech giant to open it up for broader use.\n\nEven if you don’t go for Digital Key, Hyundai finally added remote engine start to the key fob, a welcome shortcut that spares you the trouble and delay of using the cellular-enabled Blue Link app (on all but the SE) when the car’s within view.\n\n2020 Hyundai Sonata | Cars.com photo by Joe Wiesenfelder\n\nIf you don’t recognize the other new buttons with the Ps and the arrows, they’re for Remote Smart Parking Assist, which lets you move the Sonata Limited forward or backward when standing outside of it — another feature seen on Teslas and a few other brands — that can help you get the car into or out of tight parking spaces. It can be used either after coming to a stop or by remote-starting. If you left your wheels turned, it will straighten them before moving.\n\n2020 Hyundai Sonata | Cars.com photo by Joe Wiesenfelder\nFrom the Driver’s Seat\n\nThe view from the driver’s seat is good. Though the roof was lowered, so was the hood. And though the aerodynamic shape puts the A-pillars out in front of the driver, they’re reasonably narrow and not obstructive.\n\nDespite the roof being lowered 1.2 inches, headroom isn’t bad — just 0.4 inch lower than the 2019 in front. The 2019 was pretty generous versus class leaders in this regard, so even with the panoramic moonroof (standard in the Limited, optional in the SEL trims), which cuts more than an inch and a half of headroom in front, the new minimum spec of 38.4 inches remains competitive.\n\n2020 Hyundai Sonata | Cars.com photo by Joe Wiesenfelder\n\nThe backseat lost only 0.2 inch with the redesign and an additional 0.4 inch with the moonroof. Typically, automakers preserve backseat headroom by putting the bottom cushion too close to the floor, but Hyundai says it used a thinner cushion to make up some of the difference. At 6 feet tall, I had no headroom complaints and found my knees elevated a little more than I’d like, which is common in this class.\n\n2020 Hyundai Sonata | Cars.com photo by Joe Wiesenfelder\n\nFor 2020, though the front seats gained more than a half inch of legroom, the rears lost nearly 1 inch to 34.8 inches, which is lower than the class leaders by as much as 5.6 inches versus the Honda Accord. Again, in practice I found it more than workable, objecting more to the lack of foot room under the front passenger seat, which lost its height adjustment for 2020 (it will return for 2021). To me, that translates to a few inches of legroom lost.\n\n2020 Hyundai Sonata | Cars.com photo by Joe Wiesenfelder\n\nThe ergonomics — something Hyundai’s usually very good at — are mixed. High points include super-clear ventilation controls and long door armrests that cut deep into the door panels so their whole length serves as a handle for pulling the door closed. The main low point has to be the touch-sensitive buttons in lieu of mechanical ones flanking the touchscreen.\n\n2020 Hyundai Sonata | Cars.com photo by Joe Wiesenfelder\n\nThe Limited has a standard 10.25-inch widescreen display that’s optional in the SEL and SEL Plus, in place of the standard 8-inch touchscreen. We’ve grown skeptical of overly wide or tall screens because sometimes the height or width proves more limiting than the overall area, but this one’s not bad. It’s tall enough that a map is adequately sized, and it can support two or three separate panels side by side.\n\n2020 Hyundai Sonata | Cars.com photo by Joe Wiesenfelder\n\nThe standard Apple CarPlay makes good use of the whole screen, but standard Android Auto wastes more than a third of it (something a phone app update might address). The backup camera view is large, bright and adjustable, and the 360-degree overhead view isn’t as large as I’d like, but it’s better than on some widescreens I’ve seen.\n\n2020 Hyundai Sonata | Cars.com photo by Joe Wiesenfelder\n\nThe touchscreen aspect overall is well executed and deserving of real supporting buttons instead of the capacitive-touch type, a sign of cost-cutting that isn’t worth it in the long run. Speaking of buttons, that’s how you control the transmission now, and though I prefer a rotary knob, the Sonata’s approach (clearly shared with the new 2020 Palisade SUV) is smartly laid out.\n\n2020 Hyundai Sonata | Cars.com photo by Joe Wiesenfelder\n\nUnlike the Palisade, however, which exploits the elimination of a mechanical shifter linkage by providing extra storage space underneath the console, I’m not seeing much advantage here aside from eliminating the lever itself, which can be obstructive. To that end, the Sonata’s buttons are higher and bulkier than seems necessary. Shift paddles are included only on the SEL Plus and Limited. With no way to manually downshift or choose a low gear, what happens when you descend a steep hill in the SE and SEL? You ride the brakes?\n\nInterior Quality\n\nBearing in mind that this is the highest trim level, the interior design is quite sharp, and quality is good overall. In this car, the quality holds up well in the backseat (not a given in this class), but we’ll have to see how good it is in lower trim levels. Is it premium enough for a top trim? That may depend on what you value. Hyundai decided not to include any wood trim, real or imitation. You can get dark chrome and faux suede, but wood has gone the way of the V-6 engine in 2011: For the Sonata, its time has passed.\n\n2020 Hyundai Sonata | Manufacturer image\n\nWhat boosts quality is the presence of the large touchscreen and 12.3-inch fully digital instrument panel display (standard on the top two trims and optional on the SEL) in place of conventional gauges and a 3.5-inch display. This unit is key to the Blind View Monitor images that appear in the virtual gauges when you use the Limited’s turn signal.\n\n2020 Hyundai Sonata | Manufacturer image\n\nTo my eye, the materials quality is good but not extraordinary. This being a pre-production sample, there’s always a chance it will change, but the faux leather dashboard in my car was unconvincing, and the steering wheel’s horn pad had a low-rent sheen. The real leather was more impressive.\n\n2020 Hyundai Sonata | Cars.com photo by Joe Wiesenfelder\n\nThe most impressive thing about the Sonata is the switch back to the approach that’s unapologetically a car. There’s probably some pressure in the industry to make cars more like SUVs — not just to make vehicles like the Hyundai Kona, which arguably are cars, but to make even the car models a little taller and roomier and add all-wheel drive. That sounds like a good way to make a car that appeals to no one. Though some mid-size sedans offer AWD, making it an option adds weight and cost even to front-drive versions, and Hyundai chose not to do it. If you want an SUV, they have a full slate for you.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "This town is in the wrong state. It should be in Louisiana, where French-speaking people would at least pronounce its name correctly. The folks here call the place “Bell Fountain” or “Bellfontin,” stripping the name of any romance.\n\nThat’s too bad, because this is a neat little town, plopped in the middle of rolling farmland, a bit more than three hours south of Detroit.\n\nI arrived on a Sunday afternoon, when there was little to do except pray and drive, which appear to be the main pursuits in these parts on workweek’s eve. I drove a 1998 Hyundai Sonata GL sedan, a spanking-new rental car of which I had modest expectations.\n\nI wasn’t disappointed.\n\nThough discernibly better than any car yet produced by Hyundai, the Sonata sounds a mediocre note, especially in comparison with its rivals — the Ford Taurus, Toyota Camry, Honda Accord, Mazda 626 and Chevrolet Malibu.\n\nWhat the Sonata has going for it are price and good looks, which is why the car truly is a matter of getting what you pay for — bargain-basement beauty. Customers willing to accept that reality should be happy with the Sonata. It will take them wherever they want to go in reasonable comfort and safety at reasonable cost and should provide long service, as long its maintenance schedule is observed religiously.\n\nAlso, the car is ultimately likable, in the manner that an old shirt or an aged yet serviceable pair of tennis shoes is likable.\n\nAfter five days of rolling around Michigan and Ohio, I adjusted to the Sonata GL’s quirks, such as the soft wallow of its suspension system over anything resembling a bumpy road. In terms of performance, the car’s virtue was in its reliability — marked by consistent, strong engine starts in the damp chill of the Midwest’s El Nin~o winter. Also, the Sonata GL held its own at highway speeds — no draggy acceleration, no waiting to file an application to enter expressway ramps, just a rather decent zoom.\n\nThe Sonata’s winged hood — accented by a sportier-than-thou oval nose flanked by ellipsoidal headlamps — drew lots of attention here and in Detroit. Some folks mistook it for a Honda whose first name was spelled wrong.\n\nBut had folks taken a closer look, they would have seen that this Hyundai was no Honda. For example, Honda never would have produced a car with gaps between the hood and nose and the doors and fenders as wide as those found in the Sonata. Nor would Honda have used cheap-feel vinyl like that adorning the Sonata’s instrument panel.\n\nLike its rivals, the Sonata is a front-wheel-drive car that seats five people. It can be bought as the base model, the tested GL or the upscale GLS.\n\nThe base and GL come equipped with a standard in-line, double-overhead-cam four-cylinder engine that produces 137 horsepower at 6,000 rpm and 129 pound-feet of torque at 4,000 rpm. A five-speed manual transmission is standard with that engine.\n\nA V-6 is optional on the GL and standard on the GLS. It produces 142 horsepow er at 5,000 rpm and 168 pound-feet of torque at 2,500 rpm. The V-6 is mated to a standard four-speed automatic transmission.\n\nStandard brakes include power ventilated front discs and rear drums. The V-6 cars get four-wheel power discs. Antilock brakes are optional.\n\n1998 Hyundai Sonata GL Sedan\n\nComplaints: Though overall build quality has improved, the Sonata still needs more fine-tuning in the fit-and-finish department.\n\nPraise: A decent mid-size family sedan for a decent price.\n\nHead-turning quotient: Among the best in its class.\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: Acceptable ride. Decent acceleration. Fair handling. Okay braking. Nothing exceptional in these categories.\n\nSafety: Dual front air bags, front and rear crumple zones, a reinforced steel frame to improve overall vehicle rigidity, energy-absorbing steering column — the basics. The jury is still out on real-world safety performance.\n\nSound system: Optional six-speaker AM-FM stereo radio an cassette . Installed by Hyundai. Very good.\n\nMileage: Not impressive. About 22 miles per gallon combined city-highway. Fuel tank holds 17.2 gallons of recommended 87-octane unleaded. Estimated range on usable volume of fuel is 370 miles.\n\nPrice: Base price on the 1998 Sonata GL is $17,349. Dealer invoice is $15,546. Price as tested is $18,190, including $406 for optional cruise control and a $435 destination charge. A bona fide value buy among mid-size passenger cars.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nLittle has changed for 2004 on Hyundai’s midsize front-wheel-drive Sonata sedan. The Sonata was last redesigned for the 1999 model year and then reworked for 2002. The current model is related to the Kia Optima, which reached the U.S. market for 2001. Available with four-cylinder or V-6 power, the Sonata comes in base, GLS and LX trim levels.\n\nHyundai also produces an upscale XG350 midsize sedan. Ranked as South Korea’s largest automaker, Hyundai also owns Kia. Even though Kia sells the Sonata-based Optima, it has different front and rear styling.\n\nIn recent years, the quality of Hyundai’s products has been steadily improving, and the Sonata has edged closer to the class-leading Honda Accord and Toyota Camry. Even though the Sonata’s resale value lags behind these two vehicles, Hyundai’s long warranty and modest sticker prices make it a car worth considering. Hyundai covers the entire car for five years/60,000 miles, major powertrain components for 10 years/100,000 miles and corrosion for five years/100,000 miles. Free roadside assistance is provided for the first five years.\n\nExterior\nMeasuring 186.9 inches long overall, the Sonata is nearly 5 inches shorter than the XG350 and a couple inches shorter than the Accord and Camry. Styling touches include a waterfall-style grille and dual-oval headlights. Riding a 106.3-inch wheelbase, the Sonata stands 56 inches tall. Top models have 10-spoke 16-inch alloy wheels, and a glass moonroof is available.\n\nInterior\nSlightly wider than the Camry at 71.7 inches, the Sonata allows backseat passengers more room to spread out. Three people can fit in the rear seat, but it will be a tight squeeze. Headroom and legroom are sufficient for taller occupants. The split, rear seatback folds down for additional cargo room. Trunk space totals 14.1 cubic feet.\n\nCompeting against Honda and Toyota, Hyundai provides a sizable helping of features at a lower price. Standard equipment on the base model includes air conditioning, a CD player, cruise control, a tachometer, remote keyless entry with an alarm, and power windows, locks and mirrors. A cassette/CD stereo goes into the GLS sedan. The LX adds leather upholstery, an eight-way power driver’s seat and automatic climate control.\n\nUnder the Hood\nHyundai’s 170-horsepower, 2.7-liter V-6 engine is standard in the GLS and LX sedans and optional in the base model. The 2.4-liter four-cylinder produces 138 hp. Both engines may team with either a four-speed-automatic or five-speed-manual transmission. The automatic transmission incorporates a Shiftronic provision for manually selected gear changes.\n\nSafety\nSide-impact airbags for the front seats are standard, which gives Hyundai an edge over some competitors that either offer them as an option or don’t make them available at all. Hyundai’s Passenger Presence Detection system ensures that the airbags will not deploy if a seat is empty or occupied by a small person. Bosch antilock brakes and traction control are optional.\n\nDriving Impressions\nIn its current form, the Sonata has closed in quickly on the league-leading Accord and Camry. Considering its substantially lower price and enhanced warranty, Hyundai’s sedan could be the better value.\n\nEven though the ride is pleasantly smooth, it’s not quite on par with the Honda and Toyota models because the Sonata’s suspension tends to take an extra bounce at times on rougher pavement. The Sonata is an easy car to drive. It doesn’t deliver an athletic driving experience, but it handles perfectly for everyday driving. Though ordinarily quiet, a touch of engine noise is present during acceleration.\n\nPerformance is more than adequate, and the automatic transmission shifts capably with only an occasional abrupt gear change. Otherwise, downshifts are prompt and easy, and the manual-shift provision isn’t often needed.\n\nThe Sonata is spacious up front but short on headroom in the rear. The seats are on the hard side and feature minimal side bolstering and support. The gauges are ordinary but easy to read. Visibility is good in all directions due to the car’s ample glass area.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2021 Hyundai Sonata?\n\nCompletely redesigned for 2020, the front-wheel-drive Hyundai Sonata is a sleek, modern, five-seat mid-size sedan. Engine choices include a standard 191-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder; an available 180-hp, turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder; or a new-for-2021 290-hp, turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder. A conventional eight-speed automatic transmission is standard, while the 290-hp four-cylinder gets an eight-speed dual-clutch automatic.\n\nA gas-electric hybrid powertrain goes in the Sonata Hybrid, which is EPA-rated up to 52 mpg combined. Sonata competitors include the Honda Accord, Nissan Altima and Toyota Camry. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2021 Hyundai Sonata? \n\nThe Sonata gets a big power bump with the debut of the N Line trim level, which features the new 290-hp four-cylinder engine and dual-clutch transmission. SEL, SEL Plus and Limited trims gain a Safe Exit Warning feature for 2021, and the SEL Plus also adds 19-inch alloy wheels and all-season tires.  \n\nWhat Features in the 2021 Hyundai Sonata Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\nLED headlights\nCloth upholstery\n60/40-split, folding backseat\n8-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane keep assist\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nPanoramic moonroof\nHands-free trunk lid\nLeather-trimmed seats\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\n10.25-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nNavigation\nBose premium stereo\nWireless device charging\nHead-up display\nDigital Key for Android phones\n360-degree camera system\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\n2021 Hyundai Sonata Vs. 2021 Toyota Camry: How Do They Compare?\n\nThe Hyundai Sonata and Toyota Camry are both roomy and comfortable family sedans packed with standard safety and convenience features. The Sonata has some tech features not available on the Camry, but the Toyota has an available V-6 engine, which the Sonata doesn’t offer. Both sedans offer fuel-efficient gas-electric hybrid drivetrains.\n\nShould I Buy the 2021 Hyundai Sonata? \n\nThe Sonata is a spacious and well-equipped family sedan with distinctive styling and more available high-tech features than some competitors. The car’s push-button console gear selector doesn’t free up any extra storage space, however, and we wish the 10.25-inch touchscreen had a tuning knob.",

      "expert_review": "I’m on a budget these days, which means that, product-by-product, I have to sacrifice style and luxury for cheap and “this will make do for now.” From clothing to household products, I abandon my desire to be fashionable for practical resources. It’s not bad being on a budget; it just makes it difficult to go on shopping sprees. It means fewer visits to the spa and additions to my shoe and purse collection.\n\nFor moms on a budget that still desire a dose of luxury, the Hyundai Sonata is a welcome surprise. There’s no coupon-cutting needed for this one, the value is there and the price is right. It’s not the perfect mom-mobile, but it has a lot going for it. With the money I can save on this car, I can prepare a nice family dinner instead of relying on Ramen noodles.\n\nAlthough there’s leather seating, the interior lacks slightly in the luxury design department. While the exterior look of this car has me fooled that it’s a Hyundai (and from the rear actually looks like a Jaguar), the interior accents scream, “Hey, we had to keep this car affordable, remember?” I’m assuming Hyundai saved money when designing the climate and radio control area. Very “plain Jane.”\n\nThe rest of the interior is quite luxurious with a roomy and airy feel. The leg room is phenomenal! The accommodations in the Sonata are quite spacious and comfortable. The roominess in the trunk is just as generous.\n\nAs I’m driving down the road I notice my passenger seat belt light keeps blinking, yet no one is in the seat. Apparently my purse exceeds the weight capacity and the car thinks a person is sitting there. This light is annoying. It’s red and it blinks continuously until I move my purse to the floor. This won’t work well, as my purse is my companion and I like to have it at arm’s length. Perhaps I need to learn to pack less?\n\nAnother annoyance is the beeping sound the car makes when I take off my seat belt before I turn off the engine. The second I take off my seat belt the car beeps angrily at me. I know it’s a safety feature but, honestly, the sound is getting on my nerves. After all, I’m not driving as I take off my seat belt; I’m in park and about to turn off the engine.\n\nAside from a few annoyances and the lack of style in the interior accents, this car is an affordable dose of luxury suitable for most aspects of a mom’s life: career, kids, date-nights, and anything else that comes along the way (like room for more kids or more stuff that belongs to those kids). It even comes equipped with butt-warmers. Now, that’s luxury.\n\n*For more information on the car and its safety features visit Cars.com.\n\nLet’s Talk Numbers LATCH connectors: 2 Passenger seating (including driver): 5\n\nIt’s the Little Things That Count Storage Compartments (puny, fair, ample, galore): ample Cargo/Trunk Space(puny, fair, ample, galore): galore\n\nSense and Style Family Friendly (not really, fair, great, excellent): excellent Fun-Factor (None, some, good times, groove-on): good times",

      "expert_review": "Is the Hyundai Sonata N Line a Good Car?\n\nThe N Line can do everything the comfortable and composed Hyundai Sonata already does, but with an added dose of spice that sets it apart from bland, mainstream mid-size sedans. \n\nHow Does the Hyundai Sonata N Line Compare With Other Cars?\n\nToyota discontinued the sport-oriented Camry TRD following the 2024 model year, leaving the Sonata N Line in a class by itself. Honda and Nissan offer sport-inspired mid-size sedans — the Accord SE and Altima SR, respectively — but they’re mostly just appearance packages without significant performance enhancements; see these models compared.\n\nHyundai’s Sonata was refreshed for 2024 with a fresh face that injected a much needed dose of style into the mid-size sedan along with some tech and interior updates. The Sonata comes in a couple of different flavors, including gas and hybrid versions. I tested the spiciest one for this review: the sport-oriented N Line trim level.\n\nRelated: 2024 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid Review: A Refreshing, Comfortable Cruiser\n\nOutside, the N Line wears some more aggressive styling cues that make it look like anything but your average mid-size sedan, including a dark mesh grille, gloss-black trim, a rear spoiler and 19-inch alloy wheels.\n\nAnd it’s not all just for show; the N Line’s turbocharged four-cylinder engine and sport suspension amp up the fun factor. (See it compared with the regular Sonata.)\n\nHow Does the 2025 Hyundai Sonata N Line Drive?\n\nThe regular Sonata’s comfortable driving dynamics are a big plus, and the N Line builds on that by adding some liveliness. Its turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder is good for 290 horsepower and 311 pounds-feet of torque, and pep is nearly instant with an eight-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission that’s ready and willing to snap off shifts for fluid power delivery.\n\nThe N Line’s sportiness can be customized, too, from mild to wildish. Pop it into Sport mode (via a button on the console) for an even more engaging drive, with sharper accelerator response and unique transmission shift points for quicker acceleration. To amp things up even more, engage Sport Plus mode, which activates a launch control system for an even faster takeoff. The exhaust note (which can get pretty loud) and steering firmness can also be adjusted in the drive modes menu for an extra-tailored experience.\n\nThere are also a couple of downsides, including not-great fuel efficiency. The Sonata N Line’s EPA rating of 27 mpg combined is much lower than the 191-hp Sonata SE’s 32 mpg combined rating, let alone the Sonata Hybrid’s 47 mpg combined estimate.\n\nAnother drawback is ride quality. While the regular Sonata is tuned for comfort, the N Line’s firmer suspension tuning makes for a more dialed-in, sportier handling experience (which is great) but also a firmer ride (which can get annoying over larger bumps). Factor in its 19-inch wheels and low-profile tires, and the result is a sometimes choppy ride.\n\nLastly, the N Line trim is not available with all-wheel drive, unlike the regular Sonata; it’s front-drive only.\n\nWhat Is the Sonata N Line’s Cabin Like?\n\nThe regular Sonata’s cabin is nice, but once again the N Line takes things up a notch; it’s a more interesting space in there, with a slicker design and more interesting materials. Highlights include gray synthetic-leather sport seats with red stitching and trim, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, aluminum pedals and 64-color ambient lighting.\n\nThe Sonata has one of my favorite multimedia systems, and the N Line’s tech mimics it: The screen-forward dash pairs a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster (standard on N Line variants) and a 12.3-inch touchscreen infotainment system. Together they form a continuous curving panel across the dashboard, making for a fancy, stylish and modern look. What’s even better is that they’re easy to use, too.\n\nThe gauge cluster is customizable, and the responsive infotainment system has an intuitive menu structure. Also, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are standard on every trim. (It took Hyundai longer than other automakers to bring wireless smartphone connectivity to its larger infotainment screens.) Wireless phone charging is included on the N Line and many other Sonata trims, too.\n\nSome of the Sonata’s tech needs a bit of work, however. While I’m a big fan of the car’s screens, some other controls aren’t as well executed. For example, the ignition button is blocked by the steering wheel and requires an awkward reach.\n\nAlso, the Sonata N Line’s gear selector is clumsy; instead of a conventional shifter on the center console, there’s a twist-knob stalk next to the steering wheel. The location frees up some space in the console for storage, but the shifter stalk is too close to the wiper stalk, and I mistook one for the other a couple of times.\n\nLastly, the touch-sensitive climate controls below the infotainment screen were sometimes irritating; they’re a little small and occasionally required more than one touch, making them inconsistent to use. Thankfully, not all of the climate controls are touch-sensitive; there are still physical dials for temperature control.\n\nAnd just because it’s fun doesn’t mean it can’t also be practical: The Sonata N Line did well in our Car Seat Check thanks to accessible Latch anchors and ample legroom. We easily fit two car seats in back, and the N Line’s bolstered seat cushions helped keep them snug.\n\nTwo adults can fit well in the backseat, but passengers taller than 6 feet will probably feel the pinch of the sloping roofline.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nHyundai Reintroduces Base SE Trim, Dropping 2025 Sonata Starting Price to $27,800\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2024 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid?\n2024 Hyundai Ioniq 5, Santa Fe, Sonata Earn IIHS Top Safety Pick Awards\n2024 Hyundai Sonata Vs. 2025 Kia K5 Vs. 2025 Toyota Camry: Auto Show Faceoff\nShop for a 2025 Hyundai Sonata Near You\nHow Much Does a 2025 Hyundai Sonata N Line Cost?\n\nThe N Line sits near the top of the 2025 Sonata trim lineup, with a starting price around $37,000 (including destination fee). The base Sonata starts around $28,000. That sounds like a hefty jump, but the N Line is well equipped, with tech and convenience add-ons in addition to its performance features helping to justify the price hike. Niceties include a panoramic moonroof, the 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster, navigation, wireless device charging, synthetic-leather sport seats, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, aluminum pedals, 64-color ambient lighting and a 12-speaker premium Bose sound system.\n\nThere’s a big omission, however. The N Line is missing my favorite Hyundai (and Kia, a related company) safety system: blind spot view monitor. This feature displays a live camera view of your left or right blind spot in the gauge cluster when the corresponding turn signal is activated. It’s included on the Sonata Hybrid Limited but curiously not the N Line.\n\nOverall, the Hyundai Sonata N Line proves that “mid-size sedan” doesn’t have to mean “boring.” If you’re looking for a comfortable mid-size sedan with a little extra pep and flavor, check this one out.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nA new top-of-the-line model with leather upholstery is the main addition to the Sonata lineup for 2001. The front-drive Sonata midsize sedan returns in base and GLS models and as the new GLS Leather, which also has a standard CD player and power drivers seat.\n\nThe Sonata was redesigned for 1999, and until this year was Hyundais largest, most-expensive U.S. model. That honor now goes to the XG300, a new midsize sedan that joined the lineup this fall.\n\nHyundai, South Koreas largest auto company, also owns Kia, which will sell a version of the Sonata as the Optima with different front and rear styling.\n\nExterior\nAt 185 inches, the Sonata is a few inches shorter than the Toyota Camry or Honda Accord and 7 inches shorter than the new XG300.\n\nInterior\nThough the Sonata is shorter than the Camry and Accord, it is wider than both at 71.6 inches. That gives backseat passengers more room to spread out, and three can fit with some squeezing. Headroom and legroom are sufficient for taller folks. Trunk space looks larger than the 13.2 cubic feet quoted by Hyundai, and the split rear seatback folds for extra cargo room.\n\nHyundai tries to compete with Toyota and Honda by offering more features at a lower price. Standard equipment on the base model includes air conditioning, a cassette player, cruise control, and power windows, locks and mirrors.\n\nUnder the Hood\nBase models come with a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine that produces 149 horsepower, but the majority of sales are GLS versions with a 170-hp 2.5-liter V-6. Both engines are available with five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmissions.\n\nSafety\nSide-impact airbags for the front seats are standard on all models  an unusual standard feature among midsize cars in the Sonatas price range. The front airbag for the passenger seat does not deploy if a weight sensor detects less than 66 pounds on that seat. If there is less than 33 pounds on the front passenger seat, the side airbag does not deploy either.\n\nAntilock brakes are optional on GLS models.\n\nDriving Impressions\nPoor quality on earlier models deterred many buyers from even considering a Hyundai, and a spotty dealer network turned off some of those who dared. The quality is better these days, and the Sonatas performance is competent enough to compare with the class-leading Camry and Accord. Resale value still doesnt match Toyotas or Hondas, but Hyundais lower prices and longer warranties make the Sonata worth considering.\n\nHyundai covers the whole car for five years/60,000 miles, major powertrain components for 10 years/100,000 miles and corrosion for five years/100,000 miles. The company also provides free roadside assistance for the first five years.\n\n \n\nReported by Rick Popely  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2001 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "If you say that Hyundai makes a car you might consider buying, people look at you as if you said Martha Stewart had gained 300 pounds and moved to a trailer park in Arkansas.\n\nWell, I don’t know about ol’ Martha, but I do know that the new Hyundai Sonata is a pretty decent little transportation device. Not that you’ll mistake it for best in show, but it’s a solid C+ student, gunning for a B.\n\nYou can see Hyundai striving to be taken more seriously everywhere in this car.\n\nThe styling is pure social-climber, kicking a bit of Mercedes up front and Jaguar and Oldsmobile in the rear. Yet, despite the divergent influences, the styling works. Even a dull silver paint scheme couldn’t hide this car’s attractive styling.\n\nOne thinks even Martha would approve.\n\nThe sheetmetal at the front and rear is all new, incorporating fog lamps on all trim levels, including base GLS and LX. It has a new fully-independent suspension, with a sophisticated double wishbone front and multi-link rear. It does a fair job of absorbing the bumps, but the suspension is still typically Korean soft. That means there’s a LOT of body lean in corners. This is no driver’s car, yet it never floats or wallows.\n\nThe drivetrain confirms the car’s status as a mid-sized grocery getter. Base cars come with a 2.4-liter double-overhead-cam in-line four, good for 149 horsepower. Standard on the GLS and LX is a 2.7- liter double-overhead-cam all-aluminum V-6. This sophisticated little engine churns out 181 horsepower. It moves the car fairly well.\n\nA five-speed manual transmission is standard on all trim levels. I suspect most buyers will opt for the four-speed Shiftronic automatic transmission. It works well when left to its own devices, thanks to the “fuzzy logic” programming, which adjusts shift points to match your driving style. The automatic can be shifted manually by using the car’s sequentially-shifting manual mode. But the car shifts on its own anyway, in some cases not when you want it to, which defeats the purpose of the Shiftronic feature.\n\nThe ride is quiet and serene around town, but it grows quite noisy on an Interstate. Turning up the radio helps somewhat, because the stereo, with its power antenna, had trouble pulling in some area stations.\n\nThe front bucket seats have decent bolstering and medium lower back support. But they lack thigh support and are quite flat. The driver’s seat has plenty of adjustments to make any driver comfortable. The rear seat is average, with leg room that’s perfect for those under six feet tall. Headroom is a bit tight.\n\nSafety gear includes front and side airbags, seat-belt pretensioners (which cinch in the event of a collision) and a system that deactivates the front passenger airbags if the seat is empty.\n\nThe interior gets a nip and tuck just as the exterior does. New door panels, dash and instrument c luster improve the look. Everything is easy to understand and operate.\n\nWhile everything is styled in the typical Japanese mold, Hyundai hasn’t learned how to endow its interior components with the same stout build quality as the Japanese. Indeed, a plastic piece of some sort resided in the center console, having fallen off.\n\nIf there’s one thing that can really be faulted, it’s a sense that the car won’t hold together past the payment book. But that’s offset somewhat by Hyundai’s generous warranty. The car is covered by a bumper-to-bumper 5-year/60,000 mile warranty, with the drivetrain covered for a full 10 year/100,000 mile warranty.\n\nThere’s a lot of standard gear for the money. No matter which trim level you look at, you’ll get air-conditioning, cruise control, power windows and door locks, power outside mirrors, quartz clock, a CD player, fog lamps, alarm, cupholders, keyless entry, split-folding rear seats and remote releases for the tr nk and gas filler door.\n\nOptions include traction control, anti-lock brakes, a moonroof, as well as an upgraded stereo and power driver’s seat.\n\nSo, would Martha approve? Well, she does hock her wares in Kmart, but she never admits to shopping there. Likewise, it will be hard for most folk to admit they bought a Hyundai and like it.\n\nBut they might.\n\nAfter all, everyone likes a blue-light special.\n\nHYUNDAI SONATA\n\nEngine: 2.4-liter DOHC I-4 or 2.7-liter DOHC V-6\n\nTransmission: 5-speed manual or 4-speed Shiftronic automatic\n\nTires: P205/60HR16\n\nWheelbase: 106.3 inches\n\nLength: 186.9 inches\n\nWidth: 71.7 inches\n\nWeight: 3,254 pounds\n\nCargo volume: 14.1 cubic ft.\n\nBase price: $18,324\n\nAs tested: Not available\n\nEPA rating: 20 city, 27 highway\n\nTest mileage: 22 mpg\n\nFuel type: Regular\n\nBuilt in: Korea",

      "expert_review": "When certain types of products become less popular, the manufacturers that don’t abandon them altogether sometimes starve them of resources and hasten their decline by focusing on more popular product types. Apply this reality to today’s automotive market, and the less popular style is the mid-size sedan, where manufacturers who have abandoned them or are in the process are Chrysler, Dodge and Ford, and there will be more. As for the sedan models being starved of resources, I’m not naming any models yet, but we have our eyes on a few, and it’s inevitable.\n\nA day of driving the redesigned 2020 Hyundai Sonata proved the model that made Hyundai’s name in the U.S. and beyond isn’t one of them. If anything, the company has doubled down on its “carness” by reverting to the sleeker styling that was a big hit in the U.S. from 2011 to 2014 (but less so in the home market of South Korea) before a 2015 redesign delivered a superior car with what Americans deemed an inferior look. (If there’s anything American consumers don’t like, it’s a product that doesn’t stir them emotionally regardless of how objectively good it might be.)\n\nRelated: Hyundai Brings the Fight to Camry, Accord With Redesigned 2020 Sonata\n\nThe new Sonata even heralds the rollouts of such important features as the option to use a smartphone as a key, the ability to move the car forward and back while standing outside of it, and the Hyundai brand’s first driver profiles and true lane-centering steering feature. How much Hyundai’s devotion to the Sonata will cost buyers, however, remains unknown as of publication, because it’s early (or perhaps Hyundai’s late). I traveled to Montgomery, Ala., the home of Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama, where the last of the 2019 Sonatas rolled off the factory floor recently and the start of 2020 production will begin a few weeks hence. I drove only pre-production versions of the top trim level, the Limited, so we’ll have to follow up in a few months with more details on the lesser trims and base engine. (Per our ethics policy, Cars.com pays for its own lodging and transportation at such automaker sponsored events.)\n\n2020 Hyundai Sonata | Cars.com photo by Joe Wiesenfelder\n\nBeing the top trim, the Limited had many exclusive features, including a 360-degree camera system, blind spot cameras, Matrix-style LED headlights, leather upholstery as standard, a four-way power passenger seat, parking sensors, ventilated front seats, the Sonata’s first head-up display, a leatherette (imitation leather) dashboard and other features called out below.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThe 2020 Sonata Limited drives nicely, especially on the quality pavement around Montgomery, and its behavior over the shockingly few instances of broken pavement I was able to find, as well as over railroad tracks, suggests that it will prove comfortable even on the mean streets of Cars.com’s hometown of Chicago, be it with the as-equipped 18-inch alloy wheels, the 17s of the SEL or the 16-inch alloys of the Sonata SE.\n\n2020 Hyundai Sonata | Cars.com photo by Joe Wiesenfelder\n\nThe car also handles competently, and while I wouldn’t say it feels sporty, it seems to deliver more than adequately for the likely buyer. This is a new platform, and Hyundai’s suspension design has come a long, long way since the generation people went craziest about, so it’s not something I’d worry about as a shopper.\n\nAs for power, I experienced only the engine that comes in the SEL Plus and Limited, which is rated 180 horsepower and 195 pounds-feet of torque. It drives the front wheels through an eight-speed automatic transmission. It had modest power off the line but proved adept at moving the car forward incrementally once in motion without a lot of downshifting. Credit goes to the torque availability; torque, the instantaneous force that gets the car moving, peaks from 1,500 to 4,500 rpm. With all of the gears in play nowadays, sometimes the lag and hunting can be a drag, and Hyundai isn’t immune to this, as we said of the otherwise top-rated, 2019 Mid-Size SUV Challenge-winning 2019 Santa Fe Ultimate 2.0T.\n\nSo, not having to downshift as much is a plus. Fortunately, when it did have to do so, the eight-speed was pretty well behaved. Overall, power is serviceable but not exceptional, especially for a higher trim level. Oddly, though its torque is impressive, this engine’s 180 hp is lower than the base engine’s 191 hp. It’s horsepower that translates to quickness, so the base engine might prove quicker, especially as it’s pushing lighter trim levels (specs aren’t available yet, but fewer features means less weight). The base engine’s torque is rated at 181 pounds-feet, but at a peak of 4,000 rpm rather than the Limited’s broad 1,500-4,500 rpm.\n\n2020 Hyundai Sonata | Cars.com photo by Joe Wiesenfelder\n\nI didn’t lead with engine sizes partly because we’re getting to where it doesn’t matter like it used to. The output specs are far more important. The engine I drove is a reengineered version of the turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder previously used on the Eco trim level. The base engine on the SE and SEL is also new, now a 2.5-liter four-cylinder (it was formerly 2.4-liter). Both engines carry the name Smartstream and use regular gasoline. The EPA hasn’t tested them yet, but Hyundai estimates combined ratings of 33 mpg for the 2.5-liter and 31 mpg for the 1.6-liter. The 33-mpg figure would mark a 4-mpg improvement over the 2019 Sonata SE’s 2.4-liter.\n\nIf these engines seem oddly close to each other in output and oddly low when competitors offer well over 200 to 300 hp in their optional engines, you’re not wrong. Missing is the 2019’s optional turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that produced 245 hp. It’s not coming back, but an N-Line version of the Sonata reportedly will, at an undetermined time, bringing considerably more than 245 hp with it. The Sonata Hybrid is also slated to return but will be a late addition to the 2020 model year.\n\nHow It Drives Itself\n\nHyundai has already been doing good work in the area of driver-assistance features like forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking and pedestrian detection, lane keep assist and adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability. Now it has an umbrella term for them (like most competitors), SmartSense technology, along with a new advancement for the Sonata.\n\nWe’ve long noted that the Hyundai (and Genesis) Lane Keeping Assist feature — ostensibly a lane departure prevention system, which in competing vehicles may pinball the car left and right between lane markings — actually centers the vehicles in the lane better than some competitors that have features called lane-centering. Finally, Hyundai has a feature it thinks is good enough to classify as lane-centering, which it has named Lane Follow Assist. I’d like to say it’s even better, but I didn’t notice much difference on gently curved roads, having been pretty impressed already with LKA — but I’m glad Hyundai’s comfortable.\n\nCombine this with Highway Drive Assist, which uses GPS to determine the vehicle is on a divided highway with vehicles moving in the same direction, and you have a very effective semi-autonomous experience where the car accelerates, brakes and steers, requiring infrequent assurance from the driver. (These features do work on other roads, but the driver’s required to interact more.) If you haven’t braved an urban commute with the assistance of an aid like this, you don’t know what you’re missing. These features are standard on all trim levels. Only enhancements like Rear Cross-Traffic Collision-Avoidance Assist is exclusive to the Limited, and Blind-Spot Collision Avoidance Assist is excluded from the Sonata SE.\n\nThe Return to Carness\n\nYou will decide within milliseconds whether the new styling works for you, so I won’t belabor the description, but there are some key features and consequences from the change. It has grown by 1.4 inches in wheelbase and 1.8 inches in overall length, but there’s some incremental shrinking as well, most notably a loss of 1.2 inches of height. The chrome strips that have run from either headlight along the fenders all the way to the back of the rear quarter windows since 2011 (named the Dynamic Lasso when it encircled the side windows) now begin inboard of the headlight clusters and have been laser-perforated to serve as daytime running lights that revert to chrome when the lights are off — pretty cool.\n\n2020 Hyundai Sonata | Cars.com photo by Joe Wiesenfelder\n\nThe completely reimagined rear end now has a trunkwide taillight segment joining side lenses that are integral to the lip spoiler. The lenses are topped by small fins. Don’t like them? Tough. They’re an aerodynamic element called vortex generators that break up the air as it separates from the moving car and prevents an efficiency-robbing low-pressure zone behind the car.\n\n2020 Hyundai Sonata | Cars.com photo by Joe Wiesenfelder\n\nFortunately, someone told us how to open the trunk from the lid without the key fob, or I’d still be in ’Bama.\n\n2020 Hyundai Sonata | Cars.com photo by Joe Wiesenfelder\n\nSpeaking of getting into the Sonata, if you’re a Hyundai owner, you’re aware that to get into one using keyless access, you’ve always had to push a button on the door to unlock it first, even though many competing brands let you just grab the handle when the key fob is nearby. That changes with the 2020, which makes the jump to the one-step grab-and-open approach. To lock, you press the recessed part of the handle as on some other brands.\n\n2020 Hyundai Sonata | Manufacturer image\n\nAs if to make up for being late to this party, Hyundai jumped ahead with Digital Key, which lets your Android smartphone serve as a key. More than just an optional substitute for a keyless remote, Digital Key marks the first time the Sonata will support driver profiles, which some vehicles tie to a key fob but Hyundai never has. The profile can remember things like seat and mirror memory settings and audio presets, and Digital Key will support three of them. One of the neatest features is that each of these phone owners can share access with other people without handing over keys; anyone with the app can be granted access to get in and/or drive, under time or driving restrictions set by the profile owner.\n\n2020 Hyundai Sonata | Manufacturer image\n\nIt works just like a key fob, for the same functions and from comparable distances, using Bluetooth Low Energy. But to unlock the car without pushing the button, you have to hold it up to the outside door handle where near-field communication does the job. One way or the other, you’re taking the phone out of your pocket, which is a step back from the typical keyless access approach that lets you leave the fob in your pocket; on the other hand, you’re more likely to be holding your phone than a key fob.\n\nTesla was the first to offer this functionality on the Model 3 and doesn’t require the phone to be held to the door, but Hyundai says BLE’s range is much farther than that of a key fob’s keyless-access feature (30 feet or more) and as a result isn’t as secure as the company requires. Like Tesla, Hyundai provides NFC cards (like hotel key cards) as a backup to get you into the car, identify you and start the engine in case your phone dies.\n\n2020 Hyundai Sonata | Cars.com photo by Joe Wiesenfelder\n\nAs for iPhones, they do include NFC technology, but Apple reserves it for apps such as Apple Pay. Hyundai and other companies are pressuring the tech giant to open it up for broader use.\n\nEven if you don’t go for Digital Key, Hyundai finally added remote engine start to the key fob, a welcome shortcut that spares you the trouble and delay of using the cellular-enabled Blue Link app (on all but the SE) when the car’s within view.\n\n2020 Hyundai Sonata | Cars.com photo by Joe Wiesenfelder\n\nIf you don’t recognize the other new buttons with the Ps and the arrows, they’re for Remote Smart Parking Assist, which lets you move the Sonata Limited forward or backward when standing outside of it — another feature seen on Teslas and a few other brands — that can help you get the car into or out of tight parking spaces. It can be used either after coming to a stop or by remote-starting. If you left your wheels turned, it will straighten them before moving.\n\n2020 Hyundai Sonata | Cars.com photo by Joe Wiesenfelder\nFrom the Driver’s Seat\n\nThe view from the driver’s seat is good. Though the roof was lowered, so was the hood. And though the aerodynamic shape puts the A-pillars out in front of the driver, they’re reasonably narrow and not obstructive.\n\nDespite the roof being lowered 1.2 inches, headroom isn’t bad — just 0.4 inch lower than the 2019 in front. The 2019 was pretty generous versus class leaders in this regard, so even with the panoramic moonroof (standard in the Limited, optional in the SEL trims), which cuts more than an inch and a half of headroom in front, the new minimum spec of 38.4 inches remains competitive.\n\n2020 Hyundai Sonata | Cars.com photo by Joe Wiesenfelder\n\nThe backseat lost only 0.2 inch with the redesign and an additional 0.4 inch with the moonroof. Typically, automakers preserve backseat headroom by putting the bottom cushion too close to the floor, but Hyundai says it used a thinner cushion to make up some of the difference. At 6 feet tall, I had no headroom complaints and found my knees elevated a little more than I’d like, which is common in this class.\n\n2020 Hyundai Sonata | Cars.com photo by Joe Wiesenfelder\n\nFor 2020, though the front seats gained more than a half inch of legroom, the rears lost nearly 1 inch to 34.8 inches, which is lower than the class leaders by as much as 5.6 inches versus the Honda Accord. Again, in practice I found it more than workable, objecting more to the lack of foot room under the front passenger seat, which lost its height adjustment for 2020 (it will return for 2021). To me, that translates to a few inches of legroom lost.\n\n2020 Hyundai Sonata | Cars.com photo by Joe Wiesenfelder\n\nThe ergonomics — something Hyundai’s usually very good at — are mixed. High points include super-clear ventilation controls and long door armrests that cut deep into the door panels so their whole length serves as a handle for pulling the door closed. The main low point has to be the touch-sensitive buttons in lieu of mechanical ones flanking the touchscreen.\n\n2020 Hyundai Sonata | Cars.com photo by Joe Wiesenfelder\n\nThe Limited has a standard 10.25-inch widescreen display that’s optional in the SEL and SEL Plus, in place of the standard 8-inch touchscreen. We’ve grown skeptical of overly wide or tall screens because sometimes the height or width proves more limiting than the overall area, but this one’s not bad. It’s tall enough that a map is adequately sized, and it can support two or three separate panels side by side.\n\n2020 Hyundai Sonata | Cars.com photo by Joe Wiesenfelder\n\nThe standard Apple CarPlay makes good use of the whole screen, but standard Android Auto wastes more than a third of it (something a phone app update might address). The backup camera view is large, bright and adjustable, and the 360-degree overhead view isn’t as large as I’d like, but it’s better than on some widescreens I’ve seen.\n\n2020 Hyundai Sonata | Cars.com photo by Joe Wiesenfelder\n\nThe touchscreen aspect overall is well executed and deserving of real supporting buttons instead of the capacitive-touch type, a sign of cost-cutting that isn’t worth it in the long run. Speaking of buttons, that’s how you control the transmission now, and though I prefer a rotary knob, the Sonata’s approach (clearly shared with the new 2020 Palisade SUV) is smartly laid out.\n\n2020 Hyundai Sonata | Cars.com photo by Joe Wiesenfelder\n\nUnlike the Palisade, however, which exploits the elimination of a mechanical shifter linkage by providing extra storage space underneath the console, I’m not seeing much advantage here aside from eliminating the lever itself, which can be obstructive. To that end, the Sonata’s buttons are higher and bulkier than seems necessary. Shift paddles are included only on the SEL Plus and Limited. With no way to manually downshift or choose a low gear, what happens when you descend a steep hill in the SE and SEL? You ride the brakes?\n\nInterior Quality\n\nBearing in mind that this is the highest trim level, the interior design is quite sharp, and quality is good overall. In this car, the quality holds up well in the backseat (not a given in this class), but we’ll have to see how good it is in lower trim levels. Is it premium enough for a top trim? That may depend on what you value. Hyundai decided not to include any wood trim, real or imitation. You can get dark chrome and faux suede, but wood has gone the way of the V-6 engine in 2011: For the Sonata, its time has passed.\n\n2020 Hyundai Sonata | Manufacturer image\n\nWhat boosts quality is the presence of the large touchscreen and 12.3-inch fully digital instrument panel display (standard on the top two trims and optional on the SEL) in place of conventional gauges and a 3.5-inch display. This unit is key to the Blind View Monitor images that appear in the virtual gauges when you use the Limited’s turn signal.\n\n2020 Hyundai Sonata | Manufacturer image\n\nTo my eye, the materials quality is good but not extraordinary. This being a pre-production sample, there’s always a chance it will change, but the faux leather dashboard in my car was unconvincing, and the steering wheel’s horn pad had a low-rent sheen. The real leather was more impressive.\n\n2020 Hyundai Sonata | Cars.com photo by Joe Wiesenfelder\n\nThe most impressive thing about the Sonata is the switch back to the approach that’s unapologetically a car. There’s probably some pressure in the industry to make cars more like SUVs — not just to make vehicles like the Hyundai Kona, which arguably are cars, but to make even the car models a little taller and roomier and add all-wheel drive. That sounds like a good way to make a car that appeals to no one. Though some mid-size sedans offer AWD, making it an option adds weight and cost even to front-drive versions, and Hyundai chose not to do it. If you want an SUV, they have a full slate for you.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "“What are you driving this week?” a friend asked me the other day, not an odd question since I get a new vehicle each week for testing.\n\n“It’s the Hyundai Sonata sedan,” I replied.\n\n“Is that the one that looks like a Jaguar?” he asked.\n\n“Well, it used to,” I said.\n\nThe exchange was a surprise to me, because until then, I thought maybe I was the only one who had noticed similarities in the styling of the previous generation of the Sonata and the baby Jaguar, the X-type sedan that arrived in 2002.\n\nThat Sonata was replaced for 2006 by a new generation with all-new styling, and the similarities to the exterior of the Jag disappeared.\n\nBut even without looking much like the X-type, the 2008 Sonata is a much better value – and probably even a better car – than the X-type sedan, which costs up to $17,000 more.\n\nMaybe that’s why Jaguar is being forced to drop the X-type for poor sales, while Hyundai is preparing to introduce yet another generation of the popular Sonata, whose top model, the Limited, has leather seats and other amenities that usually are reserved for luxury models such as Jaguars. (The redesigned Sonata will arrive this fall for 2009.)\n\nYes, there still seems to be some stigma attached to driving a Hyundai, but it’s not really fair. I hear it all the time from people I recommend Hyundai products to – “Yeah, maybe it’s a good car, but I just can’t be seen driving around in a Hyundai.”\n\nWell, OK. If having a certain name on your car outweighs the value and practicality of your purchase, then go buy a Honda, Toyota or even a Jaguar.\n\nBut if you want one of the finest mass-market midsize sedans on the market, swallow your foolish pride and consider the Sonata.\n\nOur test vehicle was the new four-cylinder Limited model, whose base price is $22,995, including freight. It was added to the lineup for 2008 to appease those who want all the luxury trappings of the Limited, but don’t particularly want the V-6 engine, which uses more fuel.\n\nThe V-6 Limited costs $1,825 more, with the main difference, besides the six-cylinder engine, that it comes with a five-speed automatic transmission; the four-cylinder Limited has a four-speed automatic.\n\nThe other difference, of course, is fuel economy. The four-cylinder Limited is EPA rated at 21 miles per gallon in the city and 30 on the highway, while the V-6 is 19 city/28 highway.\n\nSince fuel prices began their climb to $3, several manufacturers have tweaked their midsize-sedan lineups to offer four-cylinder engines in models that have all the available upscale amenities, including leather interior, automatic climate control, upgraded audio systems with multi-disc CD changers, and so forth. It used to be that these models also came with the uplevel engine.\n\nOur test car’s 2.4-cylinder engine, with 162 horsepower and 164 foot-pounds of torque, had more than enough power for everyday driving, even on some hilly roads. I never felt that anything was missing. In fact, I thought my test vehicle had the V-6 engine the first day I drove it, as I didn’t even look at the provided copy of the window sticker until that evening.\n\nThe leather seats – front and back – were a dark slate gray, and were quite elegant. They could just as easily have been in a Jaguar X-type or Lexus ES 350.\n\nThe front bucket seats were quite comfortable, unlike those of some entry-level midsize sedans I’ve tested recently.\n\nMy only complaint is that Hyundai should have ditched the four-speed automatic and used the five-speed for both the four-cylinder and V-6 models. The four-cylinder engine would have even better highway fuel economy with a five-speed automatic, as the fifth gear is a second overdrive.\n\nThis is an elegant-looking vehicle inside or out, making the package seem a lot more expensive than it is.\n\nOne place the Sonata beats the X-type is in rear-seat legroom. I sat in the back of my Sonata, with the front seats all the way back on their tracks, and had about three inches between my knees and the back of the front seat. Three average-size adults can fit in the back seat fairly comfortably, which is something I can’t say for the X-type.\n\nElectronic stability control is standard on all models of the Sonata, an important safety feature that some competitors still offer only as an option.\n\nDesigned to help the driver keep the car from leaving the highway and rolling over in a panic situation, the stability control system operates “like the invisible hand of God,” Hyundai says.\n\nAs for including it as standard equipment – along with front seat-mounted side air bags and side-curtain air bags front and back – Hyundai’s policy is that “Safety is not an option.”\n\nStandard convenience items on all Sonatas include air conditioning, power windows and door locks, and cruise control. The Limited adds even more, including the automatic climate control, an Infinity audio system with CD changer and XM satellite radio, heated front seats, fog lights, 17-inch alloy wheels, auto-dimming rearview mirror with compass, tilt and telescopic steering column, and universal garage/gate opener.\n\nExtras on our car included a power sunroof ($900), carpeted floor mats ($85), and a cargo mat in the roomy trunk ($90).\n\nTotal sticker was $24,070, including freight and options. To get even a Camry or Accord with all of these amenities would cost several thousand dollars more.\n\nWith the redesign for 2006, the Sonata grew to an interior volume of 121.7 cubic feet. That’s actually so big that it’s classified a “large car” by EPA standards.\n\nCargo space is near the head of the class, at 16.3 cubic feet.\n\nThe Sonata is the main product from Hyundai’s new manufacturing plant in Montgomery, Ala. The company has invested $1.1 billion to build the plant.\n\nSonata prices begin at just over $18,000 (with freight) for the base GL model with a four-cylinder engine and five-speed manual gearbox – the only model in which manual is offered. A four-speed automatic is available in the four-cylinder models for an extra $1,200.\n\nThe uplevel engine is a 3.3-liter V-6 rated at 234 horsepower and 226 foot-pounds of torque. It’s linked only to the five-speed automatic transmission.\n\nTop speed of the V-6 model is 136.8 mph. The car accelerates from zero to 60 mph in 7.5 seconds and has a 0.32 coefficient of drag, making it one of the sleekest exterior designs on the market.\n\nFour-wheel disc brakes with computerized antilock system and traction control are standard on all models.\n\n——————————————————————————–\n\n2008 Hyundai Sonata\n\nThe package: Midsize, four-door, front-drive, four-cylinder or V-6 powered, five-passenger sedan.\n\nHighlights: Hyundai’s popular family sedan offers great value in the midsize segment with lots of standard amenities, styling that makes it look like a luxury car, and decent fuel economy, especially with the four-cylinder engine.\n\nNegatives: The four-speed automatic that comes with four-cylinder models is behind the times, as most competitors have five- or six-speeds to achieve better fuel economy; resale values still lag those of the Japanese competitors.\n\nEngine: 2.4-liter inline four-cylinder; 3.3-liter V-6.\n\nTransmission: Five-speed manual; four- or five-speed automatic.\n\nPower/torque: 162 HP./164 foot-pounds (I-4); 234 HP./226 foot-pounds (V-6).\n\nLength: 188.9 inches.\n\nCurb weight: 3,253-3,458 pounds.\n\nBrakes, front/rear: Disc/disc, antilock.\n\nCargo volume: 16.3 cubic feet.\n\nFuel capacity/type: 17.7 gallons/unleaded regular.\n\nEPA fuel economy: 21 city/31 highway (I-4, manual); 21 city/30 highway (I-4, automatic); 19 city/28 highway (V-6).\n\nBase price range: $17,670-$24,170 plus freight.\n\nPrice as tested: $24,070, including freight and options (Limited model, four-cylinder automatic).\n\nOn the Road rating: 8.7 (of a possible 10).\n\nThe automotive columns of G.

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in August 2008 about the 2009 Hyundai Sonata. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2010, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nSometimes a car doesn’t require a complete overhaul to bring it where it needs to be in the market, and that was the case with Hyundai’s Sonata. Already competitively equipped in terms of safety and convenience features, the 2008 Sonata’s main shortcoming was its interior styling, which was behind the times. With the Sonata’s redesign for 2009, Hyundai solidly addresses this issue, delivering a sleekly styled cabin that features top-notch materials. Hyundai didn’t stop there, though, as the new sedan is also more fuel-efficient and comes with more standard features.\n\nStyling\nThe Sonata is one of the most conservatively styled family sedans available. While the appearance of the car has been tweaked here and there for 2009 — there’s a new grille, bumpers and headlights — its appearance is much like before and rather anonymous-looking (see a side-by-side comparison with the 2008 model).\n\nIf there’s a silver lining in the Sonata’s bland styling it’s that a family sedan doesn’t need radical looks to sell well; Toyota sells nearly half a million Camrys each year, and it’s long been criticized for being boring-looking. As long as boring comes along with few, if any, sudden trips to the dealership for repairs (which it has for the Camry), boring is good.\n\nRide & Handling\nThe Sonata offers a firmer ride than the Camry, which, along with the Chrysler Sebring, has among the most comfort-oriented suspension tuning in the family sedan category. Rougher road surfaces, like grooved concrete highways, are acutely felt when driving the Sonata. The sedan cruises easily at highway speeds, but the car can wallow a bit when changing directions quickly. With a full load of passengers onboard — including three across in back — the ride becomes smoother.\n\nThe Sonata’s suspension is loud when traveling on rough roads; from the driver’s seat, it sounds as if the suspension has more than 100,000 miles on it thanks to all its rattling. In reality, my test car only had about 6,000 miles on the odometer. While road noise is common in many cars, significant suspension noise isn’t. Besides the noisy suspension, the cabin is otherwise quiet.\n\nThe Sonata steers easily thanks to generous power assistance, and while it’s reasonably responsive, steering feedback is practically nonexistent, which distances you from the driving experience.\n\nGoing & Stopping\nLike many of its competitors, the Sonata gives shoppers the choice of four-cylinder or V-6 power, and both engines offer competitive gas mileage estimates.\n\nFamily Sedan Gas Mileage (city/highway, mpg)*\n \t4-cyl. manual\t4-cyl. automatic\tV-6 automatic\n2009 Chevrolet Malibu\t—\t22/33**\t17/26\n2009 Hyundai Sonata\t21/32\t22/32\t19/29\n2008 Nissan Altima\t23/32\t23/31\t19/26\n2008 Honda Accord\t22/31\t21/31\t19/29\n2009 Toyota Camry\t21/31\t21/31\t19/28\n2008 Chrysler Sebring FWD\t—\t21/30\t19/27†\n2009 Ford Fusion FWD\t20/29\t20/28\t18/26\n*Sorted by gas mileage estimates for four-cylinder automatic models.\n**When equipped with available six-speed automatic transmission; 22/30 mpg with standard four-speed automatic.\n†Estimate for 2.7-liter V-6; available 3.5-liter V-6 gets 16/26 mpg.\n\nI tested four-cylinder and V-6 versions of the Sonata Limited. The base 175-horsepower, 2.4-liter four-cylinder (a cleaner version of the engine sold in California and the Northeast makes 168 hp) is an adequate engine, and its lower price and good gas mileage — 22/32 mpg city/highway with the automatic transmission — will likely heighten its appeal among new-car shoppers. The four-cylinder doesn’t offer the low-end torque of the V-6, but it does provide acceptable acceleration, and it didn’t feel labored when all the Sonata’s seats were filled for a cruise from Chicago’s western suburbs back into the city. During this drive, however, the automatic transmission was more prone to be in a lower gear to maximize the engine’s available power.\n\nThat automatic transmission is a five-speed unit that works well with the four-cylinder (a five-speed manual is standard). It shifts with welcome smoothness and can kick down quickly with a prod of the gas pedal. Choosing the 249-hp, 3.3-liter V-6 gives you noticeably stronger acceleration and more refinement than the four-cylinder.\n\nAntilock brakes are standard, and V-6 models get slightly larger front and rear brake discs than the ones four-cylinder models have. Regardless of which model you choose, the brake pedal provides very natural progression.\n\nThe Inside\nI mentioned above that one of my chief complaints with the previous Sonata was its interior, specifically its odd-looking dashboard that didn’t offer the best control layout. That’s been addressed with the 2009 model, which receives a completely updated dash that’s a significant improvement over the one in the previous Sonata.\n\nFor starters, the audio and air conditioning controls are within easy reach and feature familiar interfaces that don’t require you to learn how they work. The dash itself features nice build quality and high-quality materials, including optional simulated wood inserts that do a good impersonation of the real thing.\n\nThe Sonata’s seats are finished in one of three ways depending on the trim level. The base GLS sedan has cloth seats, the midlevel SE has cloth seats with leather accents, and the top-of-the-line Limited has leather seats. The front bucket seats in Limited models are some of the softer seats I’ve tested. They let you sink into them, but despite the seeming lack of support, they proved comfortable.\n\nThe Sonata’s cabin is pretty spacious and has a passenger volume of 105.4 cubic feet, which is at the large end of the spectrum for a family sedan. When you add that figure to the 16.3-cubic-foot trunk, the Sonata is technically a full-size car even though it competes with midsize cars based on its pricing and positioning in the market. The Sonata puts its extra interior room to good use in part by giving backseat passengers spacious accommodations. As three Cars.com staffers found out, however, it’s a little tight when all of the rear seats are filled with adults.\n\nCargo\nThe Sonata’s large 16.3-cubic-foot trunk pairs with a standard split-folding backseat when more cargo room is needed. The backrests fold flat, but there’s a significant ledge between the folded backrests and cargo floor that would prevent long items from lying completely flat.\n\nSafety\nHyundai has packed the Sonata with standard safety features in the past few years, and competitors are only now beginning to do the same. The 2009 Sonata comes standard with side-impact airbags for the front seats, side curtain airbags, an electronic stability system, and active head restraints for the front seats.\n\nSonata in the Market\nThere’s no shortage of good family sedans out there from which to choose, like the Honda Accord and Chevrolet Malibu. So, you may be wondering, what does the Sonata offer that these models don’t? The most compelling reasons to consider the Sonata (and they’re even more relevant today with more people concerned about their family’s finances) are its starting price and its lengthy warranty. The $18,300 base price is significantly lower than those of the two cars mentioned above, and the warranty should help keep costs down long-term, too. For sensible transportation at a good price, the Sonata ranks high in my book.\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "If you know anything about the recent history of Korea, it should come as no surprise that Hyundai is rising fast in the auto industry.\n\nAfter the Korean War ended in 1953, South Korea was little more than a heap of smoking ashes. But the Koreans are hard workers. And they’ve proved to be a quick study.\n\nBy the 1980s, the country was an economic powerhouse. The Korean auto industry started having global aspirations about that time. But the first Hyundais that landed on these shores in 1986 were truly awful. They leaked. They smoked. They rusted. They fell apart. And Hyundai almost packed it in here.\n\nWhile the communist North Koreans can’t even build a bicycle, the South Koreans — led by the country’s largest conglomerate, Hyundai — are now proving to be major players in the global car business. Hyundai — which recently bought Kia — and its major competitor, Daewoo, are selling plenty of vehicles all over the world.\n\nIn the 1999 model year, Hyundai has posted some of the strongest sales gains of any import brand. Through August, Hyundai sold 106,736 cars, up from 64,079 in the same time last year — a 66 percent increase. This is no fluke. For all practical purposes today’s Hyundais are about as good as most second-tier Japanese cars, such as Mitsubishis and Mazdas. Performance, handling\n\nThe Sonata GLS is the top-of-the-line model, and it sports a 2.5-liter V-6 engine designed and built by Hyundai. This aluminum motor is right on the cutting edge of technology, offering double overhead cams, 24 valves and an ignition system that does away with the distributor. Horsepower is rated at a respectable 170.\n\nOur test car sported a four-speed automatic transmission with a computer chip that automatically times the shifts according to the driver. For instance, if you have a heavy foot, the gear changes will be slightly delayed to improve acceleration. If you prefer to shift yourself, the Sonata GLS can be bought with a five-speed manual transmission.\n\nI logged about 400 miles in a week of mostly city driving. The Sonata performed well, but there were a few aspects of the car’s performance that showed Hyundai engineers still have work to do if Hyundai is to move up another rung on the quality ladder.\n\nWhen you floor the accelerator, the engine growls somewhat harshly. Many times when I came to a stop, the engine surged slightly. I wouldn’t call this lack of refinement serious, but it keeps the Sonata from challenging the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord.\n\nThat said, the Sonata offered pleasing performance. The car has strong low-speed acceleration, good midrange passing power, and it cruises easily on the highway. The transmission offers smooth shifts, though it does sometimes hunt for the right gear when yo u step on the gas for a fast pass.\n\nHyundai engineers designed a double-wishbone type, four-wheel independent suspension system for the Sonata when they redesigned it last year. The car has a competent, though not sporty, feel. The ride is fairly soft but not wallowy, and the suspension stays quiet over bumps. Power-assisted rack and pinion steering is standard. So are power-assisted front disc, rear drum brakes.\n\nOverall, the Sonata GLS feels like a car that costs more than its $20,000 sticker price. Fit and finish\n\nI remember the days when Hyundai’s cars felt chintzy. If it wasn’t the tinny sound of the doors closing or the loose, sloppy switches, then it was squeaks and rattles.\n\nAll that is fixed in the Sonata. By the way, we tested a 1999 model, but the 2000s are virtually identical.\n\nI looked hard to see if Hyundai cut any corners, used any cheap materials or assemble d the car poorly. I could find nothing amiss. The dash is thickly padded, and it looks nice.\n\nHyundai used some funky faux wood trim in the center where the air conditioning and radio is located and on the door panels. It gave the interior a classy look.\n\nThe list of equipment on our test car is very impressive. It came with leather upholstery, power windows, mirrors, door locks, cruise control, an electric sunroof, CD player, power driver’s seat, tilt steering wheel and more.\n\nHyundai didn’t skimp on safety, either. The Sonata comes standard with side-impact air bags and a device that automatically shuts off the passenger-side air bag if there is a child weighing less than 66 pounds in the seat or if the seat is empty.\n\nIt would have been nice to have anti-lock brakes and remote-controlled power door locks. But I don’t know of any other midsize sedan that offers the same amount of equipment for the Sonata’s price.\n\nThe seats were particularly well-made. I was impressed with their firmness and the tilting headrests. You don’t even see this feature on many $30,000 luxury cars, such as the Lincoln LS.\n\nThe rear seats split and fold forward, exposing a passage to the trunk. There was decent room in the back for three adults.\n\nThe Sonata’s styling looks vaguely reminiscent of some of the new Chrysler products, such as the last version of the LHS and New Yorker. Visibility is good front and rear. The trunk isn’t deep, but it’s wide enough to handle most normal things, such as golf bags, suitcases and boxes.\n\nSonata is leading Hyundai’s sales boom, with an increase of about 50 percent over last year. Hyundai covers the Sonata with an impressive warranty: five years or 60,000-miles bumper-to-bumper and 10 years or 100,000-miles for the engine and transmission. It also comes with roadside assistance for five years.\n\nThat tells me that Hyundai has confidence in its vehicles. Take one for a test drive and you will too. 1999 Hyundai Sonata GLS Base price: $17,799 Safety: Dual front and side-impact air bags and seat belt pretensioners. Price as tested: $20,302. EPA rating: 20 mpg city/28 mpg highway. Incentives: None. Length – Overall : 185.4 Front Compartment – Head room: 39.3; Leg room: 43.3 Rear Compartment – Head room: 37.6; Leg room: 36.2 Warranty – Five-year, 60,000-mile bumper-to-bumper, 10-year, 100,000-mile powertrain coverage and five-year, 100,000-mile rust protection. Mechanical – Drivetrain layout: Transverse mounted engine and transaxle, front-wheel drive; Brakes: Power-assisted, front disc/rear drum; Engine: 170-horsepower, 2.5-liter DOHC V-6. Transmission: Four-speed automatic. Other Models – Sonata: $14,499.\n\nInches unless otherwise specified",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe Hyundai Sonata shuffles trim levels for 2007. Last year’s GL, GLS and top-of-the-line LX models become GLS, SE and Limited, respectively. Equipment is roughly equivalent to each trim’s predecessor.\n\nFirst seen at the 2004 Paris Motor Show, the redesigned Sonata sedan made its U.S. debut several months later at the 2005 Detroit auto show. The fourth-generation Sonata, Hyundai’s first American-made product, is manufactured at a plant in Montgomery, Ala.\n\nThe Sonata is technically a full-size car, but its primary rivals include such midsize sedans as the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry. Hyundai says the Sonata is quieter than either of those models.\n\nExterior\nLarger than its predecessor, this redesigned Sonata was 2 inches longer and 2 inches taller. The car’s wheelbase is an inch longer than before.\n\nThe Sonata’s design cues include a concave hood dome, distinctive rear-door cut lines and strong Z-lined body-to-fascia interfaces. Jeweled projector headlights sit up front, and chrome-tipped dual exhausts are installed with the V-6 engine.\n\nBuilt on a 107.4-inch wheelbase, the redesigned Sonata is 188.9 inches long overall, 72 inches wide and 58 inches tall. All spot-welds are done automatically, and the car is painted with 18 robotic sprayers. Standard wheels measure 16 inches in diameter, but Limited sedans roll on 17-inch tires.\n\nInterior\nThe Sonata has recessed rear head restraints and can seat up to five occupants. A 60/40-split, folding rear seat is installed. Greater distance between the driver and windshield pillar enhances the sensation of roominess, and Hyundai says there’s more space between the seat cushion and headliner for easier entry and exit.\n\nTrunk volume has increased by 16 percent, and the trunk uses a four-bar link hinge mechanism with twin assist struts. Tilt steering is standard, and up-level models include a telescoping feature. All trims get a CD/MP3 audio system. Steering-wheel audio controls are included in SE and Limited models.\n\nStandard equipment includes keyless entry with an alarm, power windows, heated mirrors, air conditioning and cruise control.\n\nTop-end features in the Limited include leather seating surfaces, heated front seats, a power driver’s seat, automatic temperature control, air filtration, an electrochromatic auto-dimming mirror, a sliding center armrest and a telescoping steering wheel. A power sunroof and premium stereo are optional. Trunk space totals 16.3 cubic feet.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Sonata’s 2.4-liter four-cylinder produces 162 horsepower, versus 235 hp for the available 3.3-liter V-6. Standard in the Limited and optional in the SE the V-6 has variable valve timing. Both engines get an Ultra Low Emissions Vehicle rating.\n\nA five-speed manual gearbox is standard in four-cylinder GLS models, and a four-speed Shiftronic automatic with a manual-shift provision is optional. A new five-speed Shiftronic automatic couples with V-6 engines. Hyundai says a V-6-equipped Sonata can accelerate from zero to 62 mph in 7.7 seconds.\n\nSafety\nSide-impact airbags for the front seats, side curtain airbags, active front head restraints, traction control and Electronic Stability Control are standard. Antilock brakes incorporate electronic brake-force distribution. All seating positions have three-point seat belts.\n\nDriving Impressions\nThe Sonata has long been a sensible family sedan, and it still is. The redesigned model, however, didn’t make a dramatic leap forward.\n\nThe stylish Sonata is easy — even enjoyable — to drive. It is light on its feet and fairly maneuverable.\n\nWhen equipped with the quiet-running V-6, the four-door performs with a fair degree of energy, and it does so in a rather refined way. Though smooth on good roads, the ride gets quite bumpy on rough pavement.\n\nVisibility is great, courtesy of big mirrors and abundant glass. The gauges are ordinary but amply sized for legibility. Controls are logical and within easy reach. Front occupants enjoy good seat support. Cushioning may be a tad short for full comfort, but thigh support is excellent. There’s ample headroom, legroom and elbowroom in front.\n\nEntry and exit is especially easy. The center rear seat is passable, and the outer rear spots are quite roomy, but their cushions are slightly hard. The Sonata’s trunk has a low liftover height and a large opening.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The car that won our 2015 Midsize Sedan Challenge has been surpassed by newer, nicer, quicker offerings.\n\nVersus the competition: In the highly competitive midsize segment, the Hyundai now falls midpack. It offers some strengths versus the Honda Accord, Toyota Camry and Nissan Altima, like a better multimedia system and more standard features, but falls short of rivals like the Volkswagen Passat in quality feel and interior space. Its utterly invisible styling makes it less appealing than the Chevrolet Malibu or even an Accord Sport.\n\nWe really liked the previous-generation Hyundai Sonata. The swoopy-styled, comfortable, feature-packed family sedan finally put Hyundai on the map; it was a competitive, appealing midsize car. But while a redesign for 2015 brought dramatically improved ride quality, powertrain refinement and a much quieter cabin, the unique style and pizzazz of the old Sonata was lost.\n\nFor 2016, a few updates to the Sonata — such as the addition of Apple CarPlay and Android Auto — have brought it to our attention again (compare the 2015 and 2016 models here). A half-dozen updated midsize competitors for 2016 and 2017, however, have us looking at Hyundai’s midsize sedan in a new competitive environment. Given the field has changed, can our old champion still play ball – and win?\nExterior & Styling\nTo look upon the new Sonata is to experience blandness incarnate. I defy anyone to park one in a lot full of Subaru Legacies and easily pick it out. Nose to tail, the angularity of the Sonata is clean, certainly, but it’s also utterly invisible.\n\nWhy Hyundai chose to eliminate one of the big differentiators that drew customers in to its showrooms seeking a Sonata is a matter of debate. Hyundai says it wanted to project a more mature, grown-up image with the new car.\n\nThis Hyundai Sonata is indeed more mature, but without stellar styling it has to win without question in other areas – such as driving experience, reliability, comfort, equipment, price and more. One can overlook a lot in an ownership experience if a car inspires passion. Take away the passion, and it gets judged as an appliance instead. Updated competitors like the Honda Accord Sport, Mazda6 and the totally redesigned Chevrolet Malibu all offer interesting styling along with their performance, while the Sonata has simply decided not to play in that sandbox.\n\nHow It Drives\nIn its lower trim levels, the Sonata is just plain slow, with a disappointing lack of enthusiasm in acceleration during around-town driving and out on the highway. There’s no sprightly urgency or immediacy with the base powertrain, a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine that makes a competitive 185 horsepower. It’s mated to a six-speed automatic transmission that drives the front wheels.\n\nThe optional 245-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder is another story, as is the smaller, 178-hp, turbocharged 1.6-liter engine in the Sonata Eco, which has a seven-speed, dual-clutch automatic transmission. Either of those drivetrains makes the Sonata much easier and more entertaining to drive, thanks to turbocharged torque curves that provide more usable oomph at lower engine speeds. Even in the Sonata Sport, there isn’t any sportiness to be found in that base powertrain.\n\nThe Hyundai Sonata’s ride and handling attempt to redress this grievance with newfound sophistication and poise. The Sonata’s ride is one of the best in the class, providing a smooth, well-damped experience to put passengers at ease. Steering is nicely weighted, with good feel and feedback. Hyundai has put a lot of effort into body control and chassis engineering, and it shows in the car’s excellent balance between cushiony ride and firm handling response.\n\nBraking feel is also excellent, with a firm, progressive pedal. The Sonata’s chassis and brake performance serve only to make the base powertrain that much more frustrating. Opting for the Sonata Eco or 2.0T makes it a much more enjoyable car to drive.\n\nMeanwhile, in terms of driving experience and powertrain sophistication, the Sonata’s competition has become even fiercer. The new Chevrolet Malibu is a prime example, easily blowing past the Sonata with a much smaller base turbocharged engine that makes 25 less hp but 6 more pounds-feet of torque than the Sonata’s non-turbo motor. The Volkswagen Passat’s base 1.8-liter turbo engine is in the same situation, making less power but feeling considerably faster around town.  The Honda Accord Sport is comparable to the Sonata in terms of power as well as smoothness, chassis sophistication and overall comfort.\n\nFuel economy for the 2.4-liter Hyundai Sonata is fair. It’s rated 25/38/30 mpg city/highway/combined, and in a test loop (as part of our 2016 Midsize Sedan Challenge) we observed 31.6 mpg, which left the Sonata at the lower end of the pack. More efficient versions are available, however, with the Sonata’s turbocharged Eco version rated 28/38/32 mpg. There’s also a hybrid version, rated 39/43/41 mpg. Simply comparing base engines, however, the Sonata doesn’t fare well against competitors like the Honda Accord, which has better ratings and earned better fuel economy in our test than the Sonata.\n\nInterior\nThe interior of the Sonata has been toned down in the same way the exterior styling was. It’s much more conventional – less swoopy and less interesting, though decently organized. Materials quality is only fair, with a lot of hard plastics adorning the surfaces. It’s something that stands out in a category that’s become increasingly plush.\n\nComfort isn’t in question, however, with excellent front seats that are adjustable and supportive in all the right ways. Headroom is limited by an available moonroof in the Sport trim, so taller drivers may feel their hair brushing the ceiling. Backseat comfort is acceptable, and there’s plenty of toe room underneath the front seats. The seat bottom feels lower than in other cars, however, forcing you into a knees-up position that may be awkward on longer trips. Still, there’s far more room and comfort inside a Sonata than in a Mazda6, with better outward visibility than in just about any sedan except the Volkswagen Passat and Subaru Legacy. \nErgonomics & Electronics\nOne area where the Hyundai still shines is in the user-friendliness of its controls, electronics and multimedia system. Switches and knobs are easy to find, and nothing is obscured in an awkward place, like in the Subaru and Mazda. The Sonata’s multimedia system is a bit busy in terms of on-screen organization, but Hyundai gets points for including both Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, which allow for smartphone integration. If you don’t like Hyundai’s BlueLink multimedia interface, just plug in your phone and use it instead.\n\nAs for plugging in your devices, though, there’s only one USB port in the Sonata, while the industry norm is increasingly two or more. There are two 12-volt power points up front and one in back.\nCargo\nThe Sonata has one of the biggest trunks in the category, coming in at 16.3 cubic feet of space. There’s even more when the rear seats are folded flat. This compares favorably with the 15.8 cubic feet that both the Malibu and Accord have, as well as the Passat’s 15.9 cubic feet.\nSafety\nThe 2016 Hyundai Sonata has been crash-tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which rated it five stars overall. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s crash tests back that up: IIHS gave the Sonata its Top Safety Pick Plus award thanks to the availability (and satisfactory performance) of forward collision warning and automatic emergency braking. See the Sonata’s crash-test results here.\n\nWhile the Sonata features advanced electronic safety systems, they’re available only on certain trim levels. The base SE trim gets only the backup camera, while the Sport can be equipped with blind spot detection and rear cross-traffic alert. To get adaptive cruise control with forward collision warning and autonomous emergency braking, you’ll have to step up to a Sonata Limited trim and add both the Tech and Unlimited packages, giving it a sticker price of more than $33,000.\n\nThis is a different strategy than other automakers, like Subaru and Chevrolet, employ; both offer those safety features as stand-alone options on lesser trims. See all the Sonata’s standard features here.\nValue in Its Class\nThe Sonata is competitively priced, with the base SE model starting at $22,585 (all prices include0; a model that used to slot below the SE was dropped earlier this year. This gets you a decently equipped Sonata with the 2.4-liter engine, 16-inch wheels, a backup camera, a 7-inch color touch-screen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a one-touch automatic down driver’s window, air conditioning and more.\n\nStepping up to a Sport model will cost $24,235, for which you’ll get larger wheels, body cladding, chrome exhaust, a power driver’s seat, and faux carbon fiber and leatherette door trim. Opting for the $24,560 Eco trim changes the motor to the 1.6-liter turbo engine and gets you a seven-speed automatic transmission instead of the standard six-speed. Things get more luxurious (but not any quicker) when you opt for the Limited, which comes with a standard leather interior, moonroof, woodgrain interior, LED taillights and more for $28,185. You’ll still have to pony up more money, though, to get the powerful, 2.0-liter turbocharged engine. That’s available on the Sport 2.0T model for $29,760 or the absolutely loaded, no-more-options-available Limited 2.0T for $34,910.\n\nThat version is pretty price-competitive with the rest of the market, making the Hyundai Sonata a good value. The car I drove was a well-equipped Sport with a no-longer-available Value Edition Package that included a moonroof, keyless entry, hands-free trunk opener and heated front sport seats for an as-tested price of $25,310.\n\nThere are a dozen competitors to the Hyundai Sonata, but here are the three that match up in interesting ways: Newest on the block is the Chevrolet Malibu, which starts at $22,500 and stretches all the way to a loaded price of more than $38,000. It’s a better-driving car than the Sonata but a bit smaller on the inside, with a high belt line that isn’t to everyone’s liking. It features an even easier to use multimedia system and more style, but has some quirks – such as a lack of height-adjustable shoulder belt anchors. The Honda Accord is a perennial favorite, and the Sport trim on that car makes it visually appealing, as well. Roomy, solid, comfortable and efficient, it starts at $23,040 for an LX and goes up to $35,515 for a loaded V-6 Touring. Finally, the Volkswagen Passat features the best backseat in the segment, with tons of legroom and a luxurious feel, even in the base model. The Passat’s starting price of $23,260 for a 1.8T S includes Volkswagen’s punchy 1.8-liter turbo engine. A loaded V-6 SEL Premium Passat will set you back $37,655.

      "expert_review": "With its redesigned 2015 Sonata sedan, Hyundai has focused less on distinguishing design statements, and more on a clean, timeless, sophisticated design with detailed engineering and thoughtful features.\n\nI’ve been noticing myself becoming more sensitive to noise each year, and the new Sonata is a welcome relief, soothing my auditory nerves (unlike my three tween/teen daughters) with its noticeable improvement in sound levels. That’s not its only enhancement, however; it also has a new look and feel, inside and out.\n\nCompare the 2015 and 2014 models side by side here.\n\nThe 2015 Hyundai Sonata is available in several versions, including SE, Sport, Sport 2.0T, Limited and Eco. I spent equal time in the Sport and the Sport 2.0T, with a brief stint in the Eco. Compare four of them side-by-side here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nWhile I quite liked the smooth, sloping lines of the past-generation Hyundai Sonata, both inside and out, this new Sonata’s appearance takes some getting used to. It has evolved drastically into what Hyundai calls its fluidic design 2.0, which in actuality is no longer fluidic but rather much more linear, tailored and buttoned-up (think back to your move from the iPhone 3’s curved corners and rocker plate to the iPhone 4’s clean lines and corners).\n\nWhile the crisp new design of the Sonata is a big change, I imagine that after a short period we’ll all look back on the previous-generation Sonata and go, ”Aww, wasn’t that just so cute?” — like an adorable infant whose rolls of baby fat you’re tempted to pinch.\n\nThe Hyundai Sonata’s new design is polarizing to our staff. One of our editors wished he could be as enthusiastic about the new styling as he was about the distinct look of the previous generation. He said the previous Sonata ”was a knockout, a ‘look at me’ design-challenge project that worked amazingly well,” and that it was instantly identifiable — unlike the new car. On the flip side, another editor felt the previous design was just too much and didn’t age well.\n\nHow It Drives\nDuring our $26,000 midsize sedan shootout in 2013, which included the previous-generation Sonata, our editors said it suffered from poor powertrain refinement and a busy feel that didn’t filter out ruts and bumps as well as others in the lineup. Hyundai has reengineered the 2015 Sonatas’ powertrains in hopes of improving driver confidence. It appears to have succeeded.\n\nOne of our editors said the new Sonata has a completely different feel from the previous version, with a more sophisticated and refined chassis. He noted outstanding ride quality, even over broken pavement. He also mentioned that nothing upset the suspension or made the wheel ”do funky things” (yes, that’s our technical term). He also thought the new Sonata had far better steering feel than the outgoing Sonata.\n\nWhile steering has in fact improved markedly across the board, its greatest improvement is noticed in the Sport 2.0T, which features a different power assist system, with the electric motor on the rack rather than on the steering column. Hyundai acknowledges the rack-mounted variety comes at a substantially higher cost, which is why it’s not on all models. While the overwhelming majority of drivers wouldn’t be able tell the difference between the two, most drivers will in fact appreciate the improvements in all the 2015s over the 2014.\n\nI noticed a marked improvement in noise infiltration inside each of the three Sonatas I drove. I was told there’s an improvement of about 2 decibels over the outgoing model, due in part to increased body rigidity and smaller holes through which wiring passes.\n\nThe base engine is a 185-horsepower, 2.4-liter four-cylinder, paired with a six-speed automatic transmission (featured in SE, Sport and Limited models). Expected fuel economy on this engine is 25/37/29 mpg city/highway/combined. I drove this model for the first half of my day in the Hyundai Sonata. With the standard Drive Select feature, I was able to toggle between Sport, Normal and Eco modes, which made minor modifications to the transmission, steering and engine. I felt quite comfortable in the 2.4, taking it easy as if I were out for a Sunday drive. It felt nice and smooth in all regards (accelerating, cornering and braking), but certainly wasn’t mind-blowing in any one area. I might even describe it as slightly sleepy. Another one of our editors described the acceleration as ”adequate, but definitely not stellar.” It’s a good fit for the average consumer just looking to get from point a to point b. At the time, I was baffled as to why a couple of other Sonatas on the drive route tailed me and used any opportunity to blow past me. In hindsight, I realized they were driving the zippy Sport 2.0T with its turbo engine.\n\nDuring lunch I took a quick spin in a pre-production version of the Hyundai Sonata Eco with the 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine and exclusive seven-speed transmission. While I didn’t drive it long enough to form a solid opinion, my first observation was that accelerating in this vehicle felt milder and more mellow, similar to the feel of a hybrid from a full stop. Another editor felt this one was pretty quick off the line, noting that the  specs say it has more torque than the 2.4-liter — and at a lower rpm — which makes for reasonable around-town acceleration. He also mentioned that passing power is workable but not great.\n\nFuel economy in the ECO model is anticipated to be about 10 percent higher than in the 2.4-liter, at 28/38/32 mpg city/highway/combined.\n\nAfter lunch, I jumped into the Sport 2.0T, which features a 245-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder with a six-speed automatic with paddles on the steering wheel to enable manual shifting. And just in time, I might add. I was starting to drag a little after lunch, but the noticeably more fun and sporty drive in the 2.0T was a welcome remedy for my afternoon brain fog. I instantly perked up and understood why others driving the turbo in the morning were antsy to get to some wide-open roads. Rather than feeling like a car that will simply get you from a to b, the 2.0T feels like a car you’d opt into by choice, for fun — maybe even for a date night out without the kids. It invites you to play, not just sit and drive passively (yawn). It felt more like a Volvo S60 than a Honda Accord, for example, and elevated itself to a different level in my mind.\n\nOne of our editors agreed, calling this model ”a rocket” with instant power whenever needed. It’s especially responsive in Sport mode. He commented that there was a bit more road noise in the 2.0T, probably thanks to more-aggressive tires. He also felt that this trim level’s upgraded brakes were a little grabby, especially at low speeds; the slightest application, he said, brings the car to a far more aggressive halt than the driver may have intended.\n\nInterior\nThe Hyundai Sonata’s interior used to center around the swooping waterfall design of the center control panel. You won’t even recognize the new longitudinal, flat center panel and dashboard, which are angled ever so slightly toward the driver. One of our editors called this new design ”boring geometric efficiency that lacks any creativity.” Ouch.\n\nThe rest of the interior is very straightforward. The center control panel has a covered storage bin at the bottom of the stack. A small compartment to the right of the gearshift can hold other small items, and two cupholders up front are accessible for the driver and front passenger. Narrow in-door storage pockets in all four doors have bottleholders, and a pocket on the back of both front seats helps rear passengers stay organized. A center armrest in the back, with two additional cupholders, can be folded down.\n\nOne editor gave the new Sonata major points for its standard height-adjustable front passenger seat, as well as for the operation of the optional hands-free automatic trunk opener, while also mentioning a major pet peeve: ”Yes, you now get more HVAC control in the Blue Link remote-start system, and the ability to choose a time before the engine turns back off. But you can’t turn on the freakin’ heated seats. Hello?”\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nErgonomically, the controls are logically clustered, with air temperature controls placed at the bottom of the stack, visually separated from the clock cluster above them. Music and navigation are stacked at the top. Everything is easy to spot, even while going 70 mph down the highway with sunroof open.\n\nOne of our editors said the blue backlighting on the dashboard was a bad idea, noting that it’s one of the hardest colors on which to focus while driving at night, especially for older drivers.\n\nThree options for audio systems in the new Sonata include a base system, which includes standard USB and aux inputs plus Bluetooth audio streaming and hands-free telephone support; a 5-inch color touch-screen; or an 8-inch touch-screen with a navigation system.\n\nLater in the year, Apple CarPlay will be available, which I’m more excited about than ever after playing with it in person. This feature lets Apple’s tech experts fit simple and user-friendly technology into cars, leaving car manufacturers to focus on their area of expertise: the car itself. CarPlay incorporates more of an iPhone’s functionality, going beyond some current cars’ ability to let you browse and select songs stored on the phone.\n\nCarPlay’s in-dash menu for browsing is familiar, and the internet radio function is nicely integrated.\n\nThe one app that doesn’t behave at all like the corresponding one on your phone is Messages; in CarPlay, that app allows for voice entry of messages you want to send and audible playback for ones you receive. One of our editors complained there were no message bubbles to look at, like on your phone. From a driver-distraction standpoint, we understand why they can’t have a text message pop up on the screen for someone to read, but some people find it tedious to talk to the system to create a message. There’s a possibility for distraction here — and a temptation to look at the phone, instead.\n\nSeveral of our editors who also drove the new Sonata are fans of the idea of CarPlay (and its Android equivalent), but note that the details are still sketchy. At this time, it appears CarPlay will be available only with the top multimedia system, which means you’ll be duplicating: Mirroring your phone’s navigation on the dashboard when there’s already navigation onboard — that you paid for — seems like a waste.\n\nAnother editor mentioned that the design of Apple CarPlay in the Sonata stays true to iOS7, with its very minimalist appearance. He appreciated the overall ease of use, as well as the large on-screen text and icons. On the flip side, he noted that Hyundai said the Maps function wouldn’t support a pinch/pull function for map zooming at launch, and connecting your phone to the car doesn’t enhance its reception, as happens in some BMWs. You’re still relying on your phone’s antenna.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe trunk can be opened via a standard release button on the dash, to the left of the steering wheel. This pops the trunk release but doesn’t actually raise it. The cargo area has 16.3 cubic feet of space, and it expands by folding the rear seats.\n\nSimilar to vehicles that open their trunks or liftgates when you — with the remote on you — sweep your leg under the rear bumper, the Sonata’s Smart Trunk feature opens the trunk sans hands …  and without the dance, which can be tricky when burdened with packages or children. Just stand directly behind the trunk and you’ll prompt it to open after a brief delay — accompanied by a few beeps as a countdown so you don’t open it unintentionally. It’s optional on the Sport and standard on the Sport 2.0T and Limited.\n\nSafety\nA driver’s knee airbag has been added to the lineup as standard equipment. A rear backup camera is available on the base SE model and standard on the others. Blind spot detection with rear cross-traffic alert, adaptive cruise control and lane-change assist is available on certain models, as is a forward-collision warning system and rear parking sensors.\n\nThe Latch system in the new Hyundai Sonata seems incredibly well-designed, but I haven’t yet had the opportunity to install child-safety seats in it. The lower anchors are hidden under hinged covers that swing open to reveal the anchor itself. Booster seats might be trickier, as the two outboard seat belt buckles are flush with the seat bottom. We’ve found that this can sometimes allow a booster seat to wiggle over the top of the receptor, blocking it. The center belt buckle is attached to a flexible nylon strap, which might be difficult for younger children with limited dexterity to buckle independently.\n\nVisibility in the new Hyundai Sonata remains a weakness, but it’s a common one in aerodynamic cars. Specifically, the A-pillars extend far out in front and the trunk is very high.\n\nSee all the standard safety features listed here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nHyundai remains at the top of its class in terms of feature offerings at this price. However, consumers who once gravitated toward the Sonata’s aggressive and unique design may be put off by the new Sonata’s more conservative look. This is already proving to be a polarizing piece of the puzzle (at least within the walls of our office) for the new Hyundai Sonata.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Hyundai Sonata?\n\nThe 2023 Hyundai Sonata is a mid-size sedan with a sleek shape and several powertrain choices: a standard 191-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder; an available 180-hp, turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder; a 2.0-liter hybrid setup generating 192 hp; and a potent 290-hp, turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder found in the sporty N Line. A conventional eight-speed automatic transmission is standard, while the 290-hp four-cylinder gets an eight-speed dual-clutch automatic. Fuel economy is impressive across the lineup, but it’s especially good in the hybrid. If you’re planning on carrying lots of cargo in your sedan, the Sonata’s a good option, with 19.8 cubic feet of trunk space, according to Cars.com’s cargo measurements.\n\nThe Sonata’s competition includes the Honda Accord, Kia K5, Nissan Altima and Toyota Camry.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Hyundai Sonata?\n\nVery little has changed as the Sonata enters the 2023 model year. The Sonata Hybrid Limited’s solar roof has been replaced by a panoramic moonroof, and a 10.25-inch infotainment screen has been added to SEL.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Hyundai Sonata Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nLED headlights\nCloth upholstery\n60/40 split-folding backseat\nSix-speaker stereo\n8-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nAutomatic emergency braking\nDriver drowsiness monitor\nRear-seat reminder\nPedestrian detection\nLane keeping assist \n\nAvailable features include:\n\nPanoramic moonroof\nHands-free trunk lid\nLeather-trimmed seats\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\n25-inch touchscreen navigation system\nBose premium stereo\nWireless device charging\nHead-up display\nSafe-exit warning\nDigital Key for Android phones\n360-degree camera system\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nShould I Buy the 2023 Hyundai Sonata?\n\nThe Hyundai Sonata is a great choice for car shoppers who want room for five people but don’t need the girth of a typical SUV. Relaxed driving manners and a choice of powertrains means there’s a Sonata for all types of drivers. The N Line is especially fun to drive, thanks to its 290-hp, turbo four-cylinder and firmer suspension settings, but it’s the Sonata’s long roster of standard comfort and safety features that’s likely to be the biggest draw for shoppers in search of a budget-friendly mid-size sedan.",

      "expert_review": "Sometimes a car doesn’t require a complete overhaul to bring it where it needs to be in the market, and that was the case with Hyundai’s Sonata. Already competitively equipped in terms of safety and convenience features, the 2008 Sonata’s main shortcoming was its interior styling, which was behind the times. With the Sonata’s redesign for 2009, Hyundai solidly addresses this issue, delivering a sleekly styled cabin that features top-notch materials. Hyundai didn’t stop there, though, as the new sedan is also more fuel-efficient and comes with more standard features.\n\nStyling\nThe Sonata is one of the most conservatively styled family sedans available. While the appearance of the car has been tweaked here and there for 2009 — there’s a new grille, bumpers and headlights — its appearance is much like before and rather anonymous-looking (see a side-by-side comparison with the 2008 model).\n\nIf there’s a silver lining in the Sonata’s bland styling it’s that a family sedan doesn’t need radical looks to sell well; Toyota sells nearly half a million Camrys each year, and it’s long been criticized for being boring-looking. As long as boring comes along with few, if any, sudden trips to the dealership for repairs (which it has for the Camry), boring is good.\n\nRide & Handling\nThe Sonata offers a firmer ride than the Camry, which, along with the Chrysler Sebring, has among the most comfort-oriented suspension tuning in the family sedan category. Rougher road surfaces, like grooved concrete highways, are acutely felt when driving the Sonata. The sedan cruises easily at highway speeds, but the car can wallow a bit when changing directions quickly. With a full load of passengers onboard — including three across in back — the ride becomes smoother.\n\nThe Sonata’s suspension is loud when traveling on rough roads; from the driver’s seat, it sounds as if the suspension has more than 100,000 miles on it thanks to all its rattling. In reality, my test car only had about 6,000 miles on the odometer. While road noise is common in many cars, significant suspension noise isn’t. Besides the noisy suspension, the cabin is otherwise quiet.\n\nThe Sonata steers easily thanks to generous power assistance, and while it’s reasonably responsive, steering feedback is practically nonexistent, which distances you from the driving experience.\n\nGoing & Stopping\nLike many of its competitors, the Sonata gives shoppers the choice of four-cylinder or V-6 power, and both engines offer competitive gas mileage estimates.\n\nFamily Sedan Gas Mileage (city/highway, mpg)*\n \t4-cyl. manual\t4-cyl. automatic\tV-6 automatic\n2009 Chevrolet Malibu\t—\t22/33**\t17/26\n2009 Hyundai Sonata\t21/32\t22/32\t19/29\n2008 Nissan Altima\t23/32\t23/31\t19/26\n2008 Honda Accord\t22/31\t21/31\t19/29\n2009 Toyota Camry\t21/31\t21/31\t19/28\n2008 Chrysler Sebring FWD\t—\t21/30\t19/27†\n2009 Ford Fusion FWD\t20/29\t20/28\t18/26\n*Sorted by gas mileage estimates for four-cylinder automatic models.\n**When equipped with available six-speed automatic transmission; 22/30 mpg with standard four-speed automatic.\n†Estimate for 2.7-liter V-6; available 3.5-liter V-6 gets 16/26 mpg.\n\nI tested four-cylinder and V-6 versions of the Sonata Limited. The base 175-horsepower, 2.4-liter four-cylinder (a cleaner version of the engine sold in California and the Northeast makes 168 hp) is an adequate engine, and its lower price and good gas mileage — 22/32 mpg city/highway with the automatic transmission — will likely heighten its appeal among new-car shoppers. The four-cylinder doesn’t offer the low-end torque of the V-6, but it does provide acceptable acceleration, and it didn’t feel labored when all the Sonata’s seats were filled for a cruise from Chicago’s western suburbs back into the city. During this drive, however, the automatic transmission was more prone to be in a lower gear to maximize the engine’s available power.\n\nThat automatic transmission is a five-speed unit that works well with the four-cylinder (a five-speed manual is standard). It shifts with welcome smoothness and can kick down quickly with a prod of the gas pedal. Choosing the 249-hp, 3.3-liter V-6 gives you noticeably stronger acceleration and more refinement than the four-cylinder.\n\nAntilock brakes are standard, and V-6 models get slightly larger front and rear brake discs than the ones four-cylinder models have. Regardless of which model you choose, the brake pedal provides very natural progression.\n\nThe Inside\nI mentioned above that one of my chief complaints with the previous Sonata was its interior, specifically its odd-looking dashboard that didn’t offer the best control layout. That’s been addressed with the 2009 model, which receives a completely updated dash that’s a significant improvement over the one in the previous Sonata.\n\nFor starters, the audio and air conditioning controls are within easy reach and feature familiar interfaces that don’t require you to learn how they work. The dash itself features nice build quality and high-quality materials, including optional simulated wood inserts that do a good impersonation of the real thing.\n\nThe Sonata’s seats are finished in one of three ways depending on the trim level. The base GLS sedan has cloth seats, the midlevel SE has cloth seats with leather accents, and the top-of-the-line Limited has leather seats. The front bucket seats in Limited models are some of the softer seats I’ve tested. They let you sink into them, but despite the seeming lack of support, they proved comfortable.\n\nThe Sonata’s cabin is pretty spacious and has a passenger volume of 105.4 cubic feet, which is at the large end of the spectrum for a family sedan. When you add that figure to the 16.3-cubic-foot trunk, the Sonata is technically a full-size car even though it competes with midsize cars based on its pricing and positioning in the market. The Sonata puts its extra interior room to good use in part by giving backseat passengers spacious accommodations. As three Cars.com staffers found out, however, it’s a little tight when all of the rear seats are filled with adults.\n\nCargo\nThe Sonata’s large 16.3-cubic-foot trunk pairs with a standard split-folding backseat when more cargo room is needed. The backrests fold flat, but there’s a significant ledge between the folded backrests and cargo floor that would prevent long items from lying completely flat.\n\nSafety\nHyundai has packed the Sonata with standard safety features in the past few years, and competitors are only now beginning to do the same. The 2009 Sonata comes standard with side-impact airbags for the front seats, side curtain airbags, an electronic stability system, and active head restraints for the front seats.\n\nSonata in the Market\nThere’s no shortage of good family sedans out there from which to choose, like the Honda Accord and Chevrolet Malibu. So, you may be wondering, what does the Sonata offer that these models don’t? The most compelling reasons to consider the Sonata (and they’re even more relevant today with more people concerned about their family’s finances) are its starting price and its lengthy warranty. The $18,300 base price is significantly lower than those of the two cars mentioned above, and the warranty should help keep costs down long-term, too. For sensible transportation at a good price, the Sonata ranks high in my book.\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in October 2010 about the 2011 Hyundai Sonata. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2012, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nHyundai’s redesigned Sonata sedan has exploded onto the market to become one of the most popular cars available, period. It’s the best example of how a good-looking product at a competitive price can lure customers — even with just one available powertrain: a four-cylinder engine wrapped in a package built for comfort and fuel efficiency.\n\nWhile that version is setting the sales world on fire, the company is rolling out a higher-performance trim level — a turbocharged four-cylinder, not a V-6, like nearly all the competition. That includes the Honda Accord, Toyota Camry, Nissan Altima … basically every midsize sedan.\n\nBy using a turbo engine, Hyundai has made the Sonata as much fun to drive as the competition, but it gets better mileage — and it’s cheaper.\n\nSounds like a winning formula to me.\n\nRead the review for the standard four-cylinder-equipped 2011 Hyundai Sonata\n\nPerformance\nThere’s a lot to like about the turbo drivetrain, with its 274 horsepower and six-speed automatic transmission, but before I talk about power I should say that the Sonata 2.0T really shines because of its impressive handling. If there’s one drawback to the base Sonata, it’s that car’s light steering, excessive body lean in corners and floaty ride. While that makes for a comfortable car, it also means the Sonata doesn’t offer a sporty experience behind the wheel. There is an SE model with the base four-cylinder that’s supposed to be more of a driver’s car, but it pales in comparison to the 2.0T.\n\nTurning the steering wheel of the 2.0T for the first time, I knew it was a different car. It was heavier, more like a Honda than a Hyundai, and at speed it delivered accurate inputs. The 2.0T carved through twisty mountain roads as well as any of the V-6 competition I’ve driven over the years, without much of a hit to ride quality. In fact, the firmer ride of the Sonata 2.0T was immensely comfortable on most road surfaces, and certainly better than the Accord’s and Mazda6’s V-6 trims, by a wide margin.\n\nNot many manufacturers outside the luxury realm offer turbocharged engines, but because of fuel economy regulations requiring higher mpg ratings, turbos are finding their way into economy cars and, in Hyundai’s case, midsize sedans.\n\nHyundai is using the turbocharger to emulate the experience of a V-6, so the power comes on at a steadier rate. There is some turbo boost that kicks in, though, especially when accelerating hard and using the manual function and shift paddles to change gears.\n\nOne of my few nitpicks with this new Sonata is the paddle shifters themselves. They deliver accurate shifts, but the plastic feels cheap and hollow. They don’t return a solid click when depressed, either. It’s an oversight that should be addressed in the future.\n\nWill driving enthusiasts opt for the turbo because of its higher horsepower figures? Probably not. But its handling will sway the folks who dismissed the base Sonata for being too sedate. I still prefer the excellent V-6 engines offered by Honda, Mazda and even the Subaru Legacy over the Sonata, but it’s by a slim margin.\n\nShoppers may be swayed more by the impressive fuel economy numbers tacked on to the solid driving experience. At 22/33 mpg city/highway, it bests its V-6 competition by 3 to 7 highway mpg, and Hyundai’s numbers came on regular unleaded gas unlike some other turbo power plants.\n\nExterior & Interior Styling\nSave for the standard 18-inch alloy wheels and dual exhaust, there’s not much inside or out that differentiates the 2.0T from the non-turbo Sonata. I found the driver’s seat comfortable, and materials throughout the cabin are high-quality. Read my review of the standard four-cylinder 2011 Sonata for more impressions on the styling and interior.\n\nPrices & Features\nThere are only two trim levels for the 2.0T: SE and Limited. Pricing starts at $24,145 and $27,045, respectively. For the SE, that’s a $1,550 price difference over the base’s 200-hp four-cylinder engine; the turbo Limited costs $1,750 more than the regular Limited.\n\nCompetitors like the Accord and Camry offer four-cylinder and V-6 options rather than turbocharged four-cylinders, and the V-6s aren’t cheap. The 2011 Toyota Camry LE V6 starts at $24,890, which is $3,715 more than the four-cylinder LE, at $21,175.\n\nThe SE comes standard with fog lights, 18-inch wheels, automatic dual-zone climate control, Bluetooth, USB, steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters, audio controls and cruise control.\n\nLimited trims add a sunroof, heated front and rear leather seats, an auto-dimming rearview mirror and an upgraded sound system.\n\nA navigation package is an additional $2,100 on the Limited. A navigation and sunroof package is an additional $2,600 on the SE.\n\nSafety\nThe Hyundai Sonata is one of only two cars on the market to have received both a Top Safety Pick designation from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and a five-star overall safety rating from the federal government using its latest crash-test procedures. Read more about the government’s new tests here.\n\nSonata 2.0T in the Market\nBase, four-cylinder midsize sedans make up the bulk of sedan sales for all automakers today, as buyers are shopping on value more than performance in this segment. Hyundai has already found success in bringing a lot of value to that slice of the pie, and now the company is somehow also delivering similar value to those who want a scoop of performance with their slice.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe Hyundai Sonata is a midsize sedan that competes with the Toyota Camry, Honda Accord and Ford Fusion in the crowded family-car segment. The five-seat Sonata was completely redesigned for the 2011 model year, receiving much more distinctive styling and better gas mileage. A hybrid model is also available. If you’re looking for more spirited driving, the Sonata Turbo comes with a 274-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine. (Skip to details on the: Sonata Hybrid, Sonata Turbo)\nNew for 2013\nFor 2013, the Sonata receives minimal changes with the exception of the discontinued six-speed manual transmission, which leaves the six-speed automatic as the only transmission. Other minor changes include the addition of heated front seats for all Sonatas except the GLS trim and a choice of two sunroofs — regular or panoramic — for the Limited trim.\nExterior\nThe Sonata’s exterior has several chrome trim pieces, from the wide grille to the elongated window line.  A sloping roof shows glimpses of the Mercedes-Benz CLS-Class and the Volkswagen CC, yet it’s distinctive enough to stand out among direct competitors like the Camry and Accord. Exterior features include:\n\n\nStandard 16-inch steel wheels\nAvailable 17- and 18-inch alloy wheels\nAvailable dual exhaust\nAvailable fog lights\n\nInterior\nHigh-tech features such as satellite radio, Bluetooth hands-free connectivity, Hyundai’s BlueLink emergency communication system, and auxiliary and USB inputs are standard. Other interior features include:\n\n\nTilt/telescoping steering wheel\nCD stereo; choice of two optional premium stereos\nAvailable heated leather front and rear seats\nAvailable piano-black or simulated wood trim\nAvailable touch-screen navigation system\nAvailable push-button start and proximity key\n\nUnder the Hood\nMechanical features include:\n\n\n198-hp (200 hp in SE), 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine\nFour-cylinder features direct injection for better gas mileage, more power and lower emissions\nSix-speed automatic transmission with steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters on the SE\n\nSafety\nStandard safety features include:\n\n\nSix airbags\nActive front head restraints\nElectronic stability system with traction control\nAntilock brakes with electronic brake-force distribution and brake assist\nOptional backup camera\n\n\nSonata Hybrid\n\nFor 2013, the Sonata Hybrid gets a reengineered hybrid drivetrain that results in slightly better estimated gas mileage of 36/40 mpg city/highway, an improvement of 2 mpg in the city and 1 mpg on the highway. The hybrid system combines a 2.4-liter four-cylinder with a more powerful 35-kilowatt electric motor for a total output of 199 hp.\n\nChanges include a higher-capacity generator, a more powerful hybrid battery pack and a retuned hybrid system. The battery pack is also nearly 5 pounds lighter and it takes up less space, resulting in more trunk room for a total of 12.1 cubic feet.\n\nThere’s a litany of visual changes versus the regular Sonata that include a large, hexagonal front air dam; unique headlights and taillights; new side sills; and the requisite hybrid badges. Inside, an LCD screen shows energy flow between the drivetrain components as well as indicators for electric mode, battery charge and gas mileage. Back to top\n\nSonata Turbo\n\nTrue to its name, the Sonata 2.0T has a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that makes V-6-like 274 hp and 269 pounds-feet of torque. It’s rated at 22/34 mpg and doesn’t need premium gas. Available in SE or Limited trim levels, the 2.0T uses a six-speed automatic. Both trims get 18-inch alloy wheels and dual tailpipes.

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in June 2016 for the 2016 Hyundai Sonata. Nothing of note has changed for 2017, but to see what has changed, click here. For a side-by-side comparison of the two model years, click here.\n\nWe really liked the previous-generation Hyundai Sonata. The swoopy-styled, comfortable, feature-packed family sedan finally put Hyundai on the map; it was a competitive, appealing midsize car. But while a redesign for 2015 brought dramatically improved ride quality, powertrain refinement and a much quieter cabin, the unique style and pizzazz of the old Sonata was lost. \n\nFor 2016, a few updates to the Sonata — such as the addition of Apple CarPlay and Android Auto — have brought it to our attention again (compare the 2015 and 2016 models here). A half-dozen updated midsize competitors for 2016 and 2017, however, have us looking at Hyundai’s midsize sedan in a new competitive environment. Given the field has changed, can our old champion still play ball – and win?\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nTo look upon the new Sonata is to experience blandness incarnate. I defy anyone to park one in a lot full of Subaru Legacies and easily pick it out. Nose to tail, the angularity of the Sonata is clean, certainly, but it’s also utterly invisible. \n\nWhy Hyundai chose to eliminate one of the big differentiators that drew customers in to its showrooms seeking a Sonata is a matter of debate. Hyundai says it wanted to project a more mature, grown-up image with the new car. \n\nThis Sonata is indeed more mature, but without stellar styling it has to win without question in other areas – such as driving experience, reliability, comfort, equipment, price and more. One can overlook a lot in an ownership experience if a car inspires passion. Take away the passion, and it gets judged as an appliance instead. Updated competitors like the Honda Accord Sport, Mazda6 and the totally redesigned Chevrolet Malibu all offer interesting styling along with their performance, while the Sonata has simply decided not to play in that sandbox.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nIn its lower trim levels, the Sonata is just plain slow, with a disappointing lack of enthusiasm in acceleration during around-town driving and out on the highway. There’s no sprightly urgency or immediacy with the base powertrain, a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine that makes a competitive 185 horsepower. It’s mated to a six-speed automatic transmission that drives the front wheels. \n\nThe optional 245-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder is another story, as is the smaller, 178-hp, turbocharged 1.6-liter engine in the Sonata Eco, which has a seven-speed, dual-clutch automatic transmission. Either of those drivetrains makes the Sonata much easier and more entertaining to drive, thanks to turbocharged torque curves that provide more usable oomph at lower engine speeds. Even in the Sonata Sport, there isn’t any sportiness to be found in that base powertrain. \n\nThe Sonata’s ride and handling attempt to redress this grievance with newfound sophistication and poise. The Sonata’s ride is one of the best in the class, providing a smooth, well-damped experience to put passengers at ease. Steering is nicely weighted, with good feel and feedback. Hyundai has put a lot of effort into body control and chassis engineering, and it shows in the car’s excellent balance between cushiony ride and firm handling response. \n\nBraking feel is also excellent, with a firm, progressive pedal. The Sonata’s chassis and brake performance serve only to make the base powertrain that much more frustrating. Opting for the Sonata Eco or 2.0T makes it a much more enjoyable car to drive.\n\nMeanwhile, in terms of driving experience and powertrain sophistication, the Sonata’s competition has become even fiercer. The new Chevrolet Malibu is a prime example, easily blowing past the Sonata with a much smaller base turbocharged engine that makes 25 less hp but 6 more pounds-feet of torque than the Sonata’s non-turbo motor. The Volkswagen Passat’s base 1.8-liter turbo engine is in the same situation, making less power but feeling considerably faster around town.  The Honda Accord Sport is comparable to the Sonata in terms of power as well as smoothness, chassis sophistication and overall comfort.\n\nFuel economy for the 2.4-liter Sonata is fair. It’s rated 25/38/30 mpg city/highway/combined, and in a test loop (as part of our 2016 Midsize Sedan Challenge) we observed 31.6 mpg, which left the Sonata at the lower end of the pack. More efficient versions are available, however, with the Sonata’s turbocharged Eco version rated 28/38/32 mpg. There’s also a hybrid version, rated 39/43/41 mpg. Simply comparing base engines, however, the Sonata doesn’t fare well against competitors like the Honda Accord, which has better ratings and earned better fuel economy in our test than the Sonata. \n\nInterior \n\nThe interior of the Sonata has been toned down in the same way the exterior styling was. It’s much more conventional – less swoopy and less interesting, though decently organized. Materials quality is only fair, with a lot of hard plastics adorning the surfaces. It’s something that stands out in a category that’s become increasingly plush. \n\nComfort isn’t in question, however, with excellent front seats that are adjustable and supportive in all the right ways. Headroom is limited by an available moonroof in the Sport trim, so taller drivers may feel their hair brushing the ceiling. Backseat comfort is acceptable, and there’s plenty of toe room underneath the front seats. The seat bottom feels lower than in other cars, however, forcing you into a knees-up position that may be awkward on longer trips. Still, there’s far more room and comfort inside a Sonata than in a Mazda6, with better outward visibility than in just about any sedan except the Volkswagen Passat and Subaru Legacy.  \n\nErgonomics & Electronics \n\nOne area where the Hyundai still shines is in the user-friendliness of its controls, electronics and multimedia system. Switches and knobs are easy to find, and nothing is obscured in an awkward place, like in the Subaru and Mazda. The Sonata’s multimedia system is a bit busy in terms of on-screen organization, but Hyundai gets points for including both Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, which allow for smartphone integration. If you don’t like Hyundai’s BlueLink multimedia interface, just plug in your phone and use it instead. \n\nAs for plugging in your devices, though, there’s only one USB port in the Sonata, while the industry norm is increasingly two or more. There are two 12-volt power points up front and one in back. \n\nCargo\n\nThe Sonata has one of the biggest trunks in the category, coming in at 16.3 cubic feet of space. There’s even more when the rear seats are folded flat. This compares favorably with the 15.8 cubic feet that both the Malibu and Accord have, as well as the Passat’s 15.9 cubic feet. \n\nSafety\n\nThe 2016 Sonata has been crash-tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which rated it five stars overall. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s crash tests back that up: IIHS gave the Sonata its Top Safety Pick Plus award thanks to the availability (and satisfactory performance) of forward collision warning and automatic emergency braking. See the Sonata’s crash-test results here.\n\nWhile the Sonata features advanced electronic safety systems, they’re available only on certain trim levels. The base SE trim gets only the backup camera, while the Sport can be equipped with blind spot detection and rear cross-traffic alert. To get adaptive cruise control with forward collision warning and autonomous emergency braking, you’ll have to step up to a Sonata Limited trim and add both the Tech and Unlimited packages, giving it a sticker price of more than $33,000. \n\nThis is a different strategy than other automakers, like Subaru and Chevrolet, employ; both offer those safety features as stand-alone options on lesser trims. See all the Sonata’s standard features here. \n\nValue in Its Class \n\nThe Sonata is competitively priced, with the base SE model starting at $22,585 (all prices include0; a model that used to slot below the SE was dropped earlier this year. This gets you a decently equipped Sonata with the 2.4-liter engine, 16-inch wheels, a backup camera, a 7-inch color touch-screen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a one-touch automatic down driver’s window, air conditioning and more. \n\nStepping up to a Sport model will cost $24,235, for which you’ll get larger wheels, body cladding, chrome exhaust, a power driver’s seat, and faux carbon fiber and leatherette door trim. Opting for the $24,560 Eco trim changes the motor to the 1.6-liter turbo engine and gets you a seven-speed automatic transmission instead of the standard six-speed. Things get more luxurious (but not any quicker) when you opt for the Limited, which comes with a standard leather interior, moonroof, woodgrain interior, LED taillights and more for $28,185. You’ll still have to pony up more money, though, to get the powerful, 2.0-liter turbocharged engine. That’s available on the Sport 2.0T model for $29,760 or the absolutely loaded, no-more-options-available Limited 2.0T for $34,910. \n\nThat version is pretty price-competitive with the rest of the market, making the Sonata a good value. The car I drove was a well-equipped Sport with a no-longer-available Value Edition Package that included a moonroof, keyless entry, hands-free trunk opener and heated front sport seats for an as-tested price of $25,310.\n\nThere are a dozen competitors to the Sonata, but here are the three that match up in interesting ways: Newest on the block is the Chevrolet Malibu, which starts at $22,500 and stretches all the way to a loaded price of more than $38,000. It’s a better-driving car than the Sonata but a bit smaller on the inside, with a high belt line that isn’t to everyone’s liking. It features an even easier to use multimedia system and more style, but has some quirks – such as a lack of height-adjustable shoulder belt anchors. The Honda Accord is a perennial favorite, and the Sport trim on that car makes it visually appealing, as well. Roomy, solid, comfortable and efficient, it starts at $23,040 for an LX and goes up to $35,515 for a loaded V-6 Touring. Finally, the Volkswagen Passat features the best backseat in the segment, with tons of legroom and a luxurious feel, even in the base model. The Passat’s starting price of $23,260 for a 1.8T S includes Volkswagen’s punchy 1.8-liter turbo engine. A loaded V-6 SEL Premium Passat will set you back $37,655. Compare all four models here.",

      "expert_review": "The mid-size sedan was once the bread and butter of U.S. car sales. That was especially true for Hyundai and its Sonata, which put the brand on the map in the U.S. Now, even scrambling to offer more SUVs, Hyundai hasn’t forgotten the Sonata sedan, which has been updated for 2018 as it faces new competition.\n\nOne focus of this mid-cycle refresh of the Sonata was to put some pizzazz back into a design that was watered down in the seventh generation’s 2015 debut. But the interior and chassis also got tweaks that make the car more satisfying as its competition heats up: The big dogs of the mid-size class, the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord, have both been redesigned for 2018.\n\nHyundai also reconfigured the Sonata’s trims and equipment to double down on value — a core appeal of the Sonata and the No. 1 thing mid-size buyers look for, according to Hyundai research. But rivals have upped their game, too: While the Sonata’s features for the buck helped the 2015 beat nine rivals in Cars.com’s $27,000 Midsize Sedan Challenge, just a couple of years later, it finished mid-pack versus eight rivals in the 2016 Midsize Sedan Challenge.\n\nIn a specific play to its value roots, the 2018 Hyundai Sonata adds a new, well-equipped SEL trim level priced for budget-minded families that’s expected to become the best-selling trim. You can now also get the sportier looks and interior of a Sport model in a cheaper version without the turbocharged engine. The price for a fully loaded Sonata has also been cut.\n\nHyundai showed off a redone 2018 Sonata on freeways and winding mountain roads around San Diego (per company policy, Cars.com pays for its travel and lodging at such events). We drove new SEL and Limited versions with the base engine as well as a Sport 2.0T turbo model, all of which are for sale now.\n\nA higher-mileage turbo 1.6-liter Eco model will also return late this year as a 2018 model, and updated 2018 versions of the Hyundai Sonata hybrid and plug-in hybrid will arrive early in 2018.\n\nTrying to Recapture the Magic\n\nHyundai said one of its new car design goals was to recapture the magic of the swoopy 2011 Sonata. Its restyle raised the bar among then-appliance-like family sedans, but it was dialed back for 2015. For 2018, the front end is new from the windshield forward, and the lower side body and rear end are redone, as well. A new version of Hyundai’s cascading grille — shaped to echo the pouring of molten steel — takes the Sonata’s face in a more vertical direction, accentuated by vertical LED daytime running lights and stronger sculpting in the hood. A lower bumper that Hyundai calls a “catamaran” design pulls the eye down and away, while reshaped headlight pods stretch up and away. Reshaped LED taillights extend a character line running from the front wheel, while the lower rear bumper echoes the catamaran look, including dual chrome exhaust tips for the Sport and turbo 2.0-liter models. The overall effect may not be “wow,” but it is stronger and more upscale than before.\n\nUpgrades inside are subtler, but they make for a better cabin. A small but pleasing design change is a new center display and controls. The standard 7.0-inch touchscreen (8-inch with optional navigation) is slightly higher now, better positioned to see and reach while driving. Hyundai kept a welcome array of shortcut buttons and audio and climate knobs, but gave them a cleaner design and improved feel. It’s a pleasing interior overall, though there’s still a lot of grained plastic; it’s not quite a match for the leaders in the pool of rapidly improving mainstream sedan interiors, such as the Mazda6 and (yes) the new Camry. Even the Subaru Legacy — no fashionista — has upped its game inside for 2018.\n\nThe front seats were quite comfortable as the miles rolled up; they’re bolstered well for winding roads. The top Limited trim’s leather looked and felt good, and the SEL’s standard cloth is also of good quality, with interesting shaping and stitching (and the cloth was not unwelcome on a hot desert day).\n\nThe rear seat is comfortably padded and roomy, if not a match for the limo-like backseat of Volkswagen’s Passat. The Hyundai Sonata’s coupelike roofline left enough headroom for a 6-foot-2 adult. The rear seat folds in a 60/40 split for extra cargo space in addition to the large, 16.3-cubic-foot trunk. That rivals the 2018 Accord’s 16.7 cubic feet and beats the redesigned Camry’s 15.1.\n\nThe interior was impressively quiet, with little intrusion of engine or road noise in the city, on the freeway or even on the rough asphalt of rural desert roads.\n\nOpen-air fans take note: Gone for 2018 is the available panoramic moonroof that gave the Hyundai Sonata’s interior a wide-open, airy feel. It’s been dropped in favor of a smallish (and cheaper) conventional rectangle.\n\nImproved Driving Dynamics\n\nThe Hyundai Sonata already combined a smooth ride with competent handling. Now, the 2018’s upgraded rear suspension links and bushings improve dynamics while retaining a smooth ride and balance reminiscent of a premium car. Increased component stiffness and new tuning also deliver better steering response and on-center feel. The Sonata is no sports car, but it felt agile and confident while carving up twisting mountain roads.\n\nTurbo models get added grip from new Michelin rubber on 18-inch alloy wheels; base-engine models get 16s or 17s. Handling doesn’t quite match the tied-down feel of the benchmark Mazda6 or Ford Fusion sedans, but overall balance is better than most in the class. (We have yet to road-test the 2018 Camry and Accord.)\n\nBoth engines we drove were quiet even when pushed, and their transmissions went about their business competently. The Sonata’s carryover 185-horsepower, 2.4-liter four-cylinder base engine, paired with a six-speed automatic, gets you around with no fuss (or thrills). It should satisfy most buyers and is easier on the wallet, with EPA-rated mileage of 25/35/28 city/highway/combined for most models.\n\nBut if you enjoy driving and are OK with a mileage drop to 23/32/26 mpg, your choice should be the 245-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that powers the Sport 2.0T and Limited 2.0T. Also a carryover engine, for 2018, it’s mated to a new eight-speed automatic with manual mode and paddle shifters. A 34 percent greater gear ratio spread versus the former six-speed is a better fit for the turbo, giving it both more punch off the line and quieter high-speed cruising. Downshifts were quick and positive, and the middle ratios were well-spaced. It’s a good mating of performance and value — though if you want more zip and are willing to pay for it, the new Camry, for example, offers a trim with a 301-hp V-6 that delivers comparable fuel mileage. The Fusion offers a thirstier but much sportier 325-hp, 2.7-liter EcoBoost V-6 with all-wheel drive. Compare mileage ratings here.\n\nSonatas offer drive modes that alter gas-pedal response, transmission settings and steering: Eco, Sport, Comfort and (in 2.0T versions) Smart, which mixes and matches based on your driving style. I kept the cars I drove in Sport most of the time; the others seemed too quick to shift up to higher gears — no doubt a nod to fuel economy.\n\nIf that’s your priority, the highest-mileage Sonata models are still to come. The Eco with a turbocharged 1.6-liter will return for 2018 but was not yet available to test. I drove the previous Eco model and found it to be more fun than the base 2.4-liter engine thanks to more low-end torque and its seven-speed, dual-clutch automatic transmission. The Eco will continue to be just a niche model for budget buyers, Hyundai says, offered only in bare-bones form (it’s the equivalent of an SE trim but with a different engine).\n\nEarly next year, updated 2018 Sonatas with hybrid and plug-in-hybrid powertrains will arrive.\n\nTech Excellence and Free Connectivity\n\nThe Hyundai multimedia system is fast and among the most user-friendly ones you can get; it’s equal to or better than anything in this class. Either touchscreen is clear and sharp, and the Sonata has standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration. A convenient device bin on the front console has USB connectivity and 12-volt power. A wireless charging pad is available, and a USB connection has been added for the rear seat. For 2018, Sonatas come with three years of free Hyundai Blue Link service for remote starting, locking and cabin conditioning via smartphones or smart home speakers (such as an Amazon Echo). Models with navigation also get free map updates for three years. These free services are a value boost from the 2017, which had just a three-month free trial followed by costly subscriptions and updates.\n\nSafety Features at a Price\n\nThe 2018 Hyundai Sonata earned top ratings from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety both for crashworthiness and collision prevention — but only with safety features available on SEL and Limited trims.\n\nBlind spot warning and rear cross-traffic alert are now standard on all Sonatas. More sophisticated safety options include forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking up to 37 mph, plus pedestrian detection, lane keep assist and adaptive cruise control, but these features are confined to option packages on the SEL ($1,000 for the Tech Package) and Limited trims (in a $2,900 package with other features). The features are standard only on the Limited 2.0T, and they aren’t offered at all on SE and Sport trims. This seems behind the curve: Rivals such as the Camry and Accord make a forward collision system standard on all trims for 2018.\n\nAlso available on the Limited and Limited 2.0T are new, standard LED headlights that earned a rating of acceptable from IIHS, bringing the Sonata more in line with its competition. (Compare IIHS mid-size sedan safety ratings here.) The Hyundai Sonata’s other headlight combinations still get a poor rating for 2018.\n\nRaising the Value Play\n\nValue is a core part of Hyundai’s brand image, and while the Sonata might be just mid-pack in some ways, it’s a leader in bang for the buck with its reconfigured pricing and trims for 2018. The SE model’s base price rose $100 to $22,935, including destination, but now includes standard blind spot warning and rear cross-traffic alert. It still undercuts rival starting prices like the 2018 Camry ($24,390) and Accord ($24,445). At the top end, a check-all-the-boxes Sonata Limited 2.0T got a price cut of $1,900 from 2017, down to $33,335 with destination. That flies well under the fanciest versions of those rivals.\n\nLikely even more important for shoppers, the new SEL trim is positioned squarely in a value sweet spot, boasting a bucket of features for $24,585. It includes 17-inch alloy wheels (no plastic covers), LED daytime running lights, a proximity key with push-button start, a hands-free smart trunk opener, a 10-way power-adjustable driver’s seat, heated front seats and a 7-inch media display with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration. Spend another $1,000 and you can add advanced safety technology to the SEL, including a forward collision system. Plus, like all new Hyundai Sonatas, it includes three years of Blue Link app features and Hyundai’s class-leading five-year/60,000-mile transferable warranty and 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty.",

      "expert_review": "The 2011 Hyundai Sonata is a solid family sedan that offers gorgeous exterior styling and impressive gas mileage, but it lacks expressive drive-feel and is low on the fun factor. For many folks, good looks, fair pricing and fantastic fuel economy might be all you need. That’s all fine and good, but the Sonata’s lack of a dynamic drive left me disappointed because I liked everything else about this sedan.\n\nI loved looking at the Sonata; it was so smooth and glossy, and it reminded me of a polished gem. The interior was just as pretty and had the perfect combination of a little shimmer here and there without being tacky. I even felt an added sense of security when I sat down and pulled the heavy door shut. Then I hit the gas pedal and all my excitement dwindled. While the Sonata proved itself to be a well-built, good-looking and fuel-efficient car, it had zero personality when it came to drive-feel.\n\nThe Sonata took off slowly, stopped in plenty of time and offered so-so steering responsiveness. This five-seater has a choice of two four-cylinder engines: One makes 198 horsepower and the other boosts the ponies up by a count of two. Yep, it tops out at 200 hp. I’ve driven cars with less horsepower that provided a much more engaging and exciting driving experience.\n\nTo be fair, the Sonata succeeded in being a practical option for drivers who don’t place a high value on fun-to-drive characteristics. A 274-hp, turbo four-cylinder Sonata is also available.  The Sonata base model starts at $19,395. However, I was disappointed that my test car, a Sonata SE that has a starting MSRP of $22,795, had a much higher sticker price of $26,015, but didn’t include a backup camera, leather upholstery or heated seats.\n\nEXTERIOR\n\nThe Sonata really is gorgeous. Its long, swoopy lines reminded me of a willowy runway model slithering down city streets.\n\nBecause it’s a sedan it was easy for everyone in my family to get in and out of it. The cargo area was huge, and I had to bend and reach into it to get at those few items that slid to the back of the trunk. I supposed that’s a little inconvenient, but I’d rather have more cargo room than not enough.\n\nThe Sonata SE has a 200-hp, 2.4-liter inline-four-cylinder engine. It gets an EPA-estimated 22/35 mpg city/highway and uses regular gas.\n\nDuring my test week in the Sonata, it achieved the gas mileage of a much smaller vehicle  —  perhaps closer to a moped. This appears to have been Hyundai’s goal: Provide a head-turning, luxurious-looking sedan that uses regular fuel and uses it sparingly. Score! I averaged 25.6 mpg, which as I type doesn’t seem so astounding, but let me explain. We drove to the Sonata to Great Grandma’s place and back without having to stop for gas. As my kids will tell you, Great Grandma’s is a long trip. It’s seriously over-the-river-and-through-the-woods distances to get to her place, which can be loosely translated to 90 minutes one way.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): None\n\nINTERIOR\n\nRoomy and a step above casual, the Sonata’s interior is attractive. The seats’ cloth upholstery was thick and nice looking with a checked pattern. Some cars have bizarre shapes and prints in the upholstery, which I find distracting and cheap looking, and I applaud Hyundai for being cost effective here without becoming gaudy.\n\nI enjoyed the generous lumbar support in the driver’s seat. My mom, who rode with us to Great Grandma’s, said the ride felt smooth from her perch in the passenger seat. She also noted that the cabin seemed quiet. I agree with her, but it wasn’t the quietest I’ve ever been in by far.\n\nAll of the controls were well placed and easy to figure out.  I especially liked the heating and cooling selections with buttons built into the shape of a seated person.  Need air to your feet? Press the feet. Want to blow cool air right on your face? Press the head and so on. Simple enough.\n\nIn the second row, the kids enjoyed fine accommodations with easy-to-use seat belts and two cupholders located in the fold-down center armrest. They also appreciated the plentiful legroom.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSAFETY\n\nThe 2011 Sonata has been named a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. To earn this safety nod, a car must receive the top score of Good in front-, side-impact, rear and roof-strength crash tests as well as have a standard electronic stability system.\n\nThe Sonata also has standard traction control, front-wheel drive, antilock brakes with electronic brake-force distribution and brake assist, active front head restraints and six airbags, including side curtains for both rows of seats.\n\nThis five-seater has two sets of lower Latch anchors that are buried under stiff seat cushions. A booster seat fit well in the backseat. Even though the seat belt buckles were floppy, my boys didn’t have problems buckling up on their own.\n\nAfter struggling to get past the seat cushions to use the Latch anchors, the forward-facing convertible car seat fit well. The Sonata has plenty of space in the second row, so a rear-facing convertible and a rear-facing infant-safety seat both fit well back there. However, I wasn’t able to fit three car seats across the Sonata’s backseat.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2011 Hyundai Sonata here.",
