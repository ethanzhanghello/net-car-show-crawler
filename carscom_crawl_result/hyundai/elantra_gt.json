      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe 2016 Hyundai Elantra GT hatchback has revised styling and new available technology and convenience features.\n\nExteriorThe Elantra GT gets a new grille that significantly changes the car’s appearance, but look closely and you’ll see that it takes up the same real estate as the prior, more segmented design. The new look makes the grille seem bigger and provides a visual connection with other Hyundais like the Genesis sedan.\n\nOtherwise, styling changes are relatively minor. Restyled taillights can be fitted with available LEDs, and the 17-inch alloy wheels have a new look. Other available features include automatic headlights and side mirrors with integrated turn signals.\n\nInteriorThe five-seat cabin is mostly the same, but a new navigation system and ventilated front seats are included in the available Tech Package.\n\nThe new navigation system is based on the one offered in Hyundai’s Genesis and Sonata sedans and features a 7-inch touch-screen and SiriusXM Travel Link. Travel Link provides weather and traffic information, sports scores and fuel prices, among other info. The navigation system also supports Pandora and other apps, and offers Apple Siri Eyes Free integration for iPhone users. The backup camera, which retracts when not in use to help the lens stay clean all-year round, uses the screen to show what’s behind the car.\n\nStandard features include heated front seats, steering wheel audio controls, cruise control, Bluetooth streaming audio, and a CD stereo with satellite radio capability, an MP3 jack and a USB port. A power driver’s seat with power lumbar support, dual-zone automatic air conditioning and leather upholstery are available.\n\nUnder the HoodThe Elantra GT’s powertrain is unchanged; it still uses a 173-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that teams with a six-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission. EPA-estimated gas mileage is 24/33/27 mpg city/highway/combined.\n\nHyundai says the Elantra GT’s Driver Selectable Steering Mode has been tuned for better steering feel. The system has Comfort, Normal and Sport modes that offer varying levels of power assistance, on-center feel and steering build-up when cornering. The available Style Package includes sport-oriented suspension tuning.\n\nSafetyThe Elantra GT includes federally mandated front airbags, antilock brakes and an electronic stability system. It also has standard side-impact and side curtain airbags.\n\nThe latest version of Hyundai’s Blue Link communication system is included in the Tech Package, and it now supports remote start with a climate control feature and destination search via Google. Hyundai says Blue Link features eventually will be accessible from a paired smart watch. A one-year trial of Blue Link Connected Care, which offers automatic collision notification among other features, is included. The remote start and destination search features are part of the Remote and Guidance packages, respectively.",

      "expert_review": "As compact car sales decline in favor of small SUVs, Hyundai believes some Americans are ready for a third option: a compact hatchback that hauls like a small SUV but offers the driving fun and economy of a car. Hyundai is doubling up in this niche market for 2018 with a redesign of its Elantra GT hatchback and a new, sportier trim: the GT Sport, with a turbocharged engine and upgraded chassis. The 2017 version was a one-size-fits-all single trim. As before, the 2018 Hyundai Elantra GT is an Elantra in name, but is actually a U.S.-badged version of Hyundai’s global i30 hatchback with different underpinnings than the U.S. Elantra sedan.\n\nThe 2018 Elantra GT faces growing competition that now includes six compact hatches: a freshened Volkswagen Golf, plus the Chevrolet Cruze, Honda Civic, Subaru Impreza (redesigned for 2017), Toyota Corolla iM, Ford Focus and Mazda3. Each is distinctive in one way or another; body style is the one common denominator. But having more rivals isn’t bad if it helps hatchback cars become less of an oddity.\n\nI went to San Diego to check out the new Elantra GT at a launch event hosted by Hyundai (per our ethics policy, Cars.com pays for its own airfare and lodging at such events). While there, I racked up miles in the city, in mountain canyons and in the desert in a base GT (with a full load of options) and in a GT Sport. Our Chicago-based editors also drove a manual GT Sport.\n\nLooks More Golf Than Gaudy\n\nThe 2018 Elantra GT was designed in Europe, where hatches thrive and the Golf is a leader. The 2018 Elantra GT is only slightly longer, wider and lower than the 2017, but it looks more so thanks to a Golf-like boxy design that replaces the GT’s former curvy look. It’s a shape that manages to be practical while still looking sportier than the 2017. The box is more aerodynamic than it looks, too, with a respectable 0.3 coefficient of drag.\n\nThe 2018 GT also bears more family resemblance to the Elantra sedan thanks to its horizontal lines and a version of Hyundai’s large cascading grille. The grille is flanked by functional air inlets with vertical LED daytime running lights. The headlights stretch up and around the corners into a strong horizontal character line that extends all the way into the taillights and a rear end that looks wider than it is; a standard rear spoiler also lengthens the look of the roofline. Full LED headlights and LED taillights are available on the GT and standard on the GT Sport, as are old-school round chrome exhaust tips.\n\nThe horizontal theme extends to the dashboard, enhancing the impression of space inside. And it’s not just an illusion; the interior is roomy for a car this size. The front seats are comfortable and sufficiently padded. The backseat is firmer but has reasonable legroom and headroom for two. If you opt for the dramatic panoramic moonroof, the interior seems even airier, but headroom for a tall (6-foot-2) backseat passenger is just adequate.\n\nThe Hyundai Elantra GT Sport has a sportier feel inside, with black leather seats and red accent stitching, as well as red satin-metal-finish accent trim. It also adds a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob. Heated seats are standard on the Sport; ventilated seats are available.\n\nThe materials and trim of the GT and GT Sport interiors are competitive with rivals such as the Civic and Cruze, but they have some hard-plastic touch points that make them fall short of the upscale feel of Volkswagen’s Golf line — arguably the leader — and the Mazda3. Noise levels are generally good, but we did hear some road noise on rougher pavement, particularly with the Elantra GT Sport’s bigger 18-inch wheels.\n\nA love-it-or-hate-it feature, there’s a standard 8-inch tablet-style touchscreen floating above the dash, flanked by buttons and knobs. Personally, I like the ergonomics; it’s easy to reach and see without looking down, though I’d prefer a less shiny surface. I know screens floating above the dash — used by Mazda and Mercedes-Benz, among others — are controversial, but I suggest you try it before dismissing it.\n\nIt Hauls Mass\n\nThe almost wagonlike new Hyundai Elantra GT shape offers about 8 percent more hauling space than the more rounded 2017. The cargo area is high, wide and deep, and it has a large hatch opening. We didn’t have a mountain bike on hand, but Hyundai says it will swallow one without removing a wheel. The 60/40-split folding backseat creates a nearly level floor with the two-position rear cargo floor at its higher setting, but to get maximum volume, you’ll have to put the rear floor into its lower position. Its maximum cargo room of 55.1 cubic feet with the backseat folded beats rivals such as the Golf (52.7 cubic feet), as well as the sleeker-styled Mazda3 (47.1) and Honda Civic hatchback (46.2). Space behind the backseat is a roller-bag-friendly configuration of nearly 25 cubic feet.\n\nThe GT’s space gives lie to the notion that you need a small SUV to haul cargo: Honda’s popular HR-V SUV offers just 24.3 cubic feet behind the rear seat and 58.8 cubic feet total. And while the Elantra GT doesn’t offer all-wheel drive, the five-door hatchback does everything a small SUV can do in most situations in most climates.\n\nTwo Flavors Under the Hood\n\nThe GT’s base 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine makes 161 horsepower and 150 pounds-feet of torque, both down slightly from 2017 (173 hp, 154 pounds-feet). EPA-estimated gas mileage remains the same at 24/32/27 mpg city/highway/combined with the automatic transmission; those numbers drop 1 mpg across the board with the six-speed manual (compare them here). The base engine is adequate, even fun, in most situations and will suit many buyers, though you’ll want to plan well ahead to pass a semi.\n\nThe better fit for the car’s personality is the new GT Sport’s 201-hp, turbocharged 1.6-liter four, an engine also used in Hyundai’s Elantra Sport sedan and the underappreciated Veloster Turbo coupe. The Sport’s power edge over the base model is magnified by the delivery of its 195 pounds-feet of torque, beginning at a low 1,500 rpm versus 4,700 rpm for the 2.0-liter. You can choose to stir the gears yourself with a six-speed manual transmission (Hyundai estimates a high 30 percent of buyers will do so), or you can opt for the crisp-shifting seven-speed dual-clutch automatic with steering-wheel paddles. The 1.6-liter with the automatic transmission is the top fuel-economy choice, EPA-rated at 26/32/28 mpg. The manual is the least efficient GT at 22/29/25 mpg.\n\nThe turbo was a ball for carving canyon roads with the paddles to manage the gears. It was a lot more confidence-inspiring than the base engine while passing on the highway, with plenty of power and automatic downshifts that were quick and smooth. Its low-end punchiness, with only modest turbo lag, would make a more satisfying choice for daily commuting. The dual-clutch automatic, like most of its breed, will stumble occasionally at low speeds.\n\nOther Cars.com editors drove a manual GT Sport in Chicago and reported it’s fun to drive, but having only six gears and a small engine means it’s not a rocket from a standing start. The engine doesn’t rev very quickly, suggesting a heavy flywheel — the norm for such a small engine. The clutch pedal is very light. The shifter is decent but has longer throws than we’d prefer. Also, you can’t add attractive tech and safety option packages to the manual-equipped GT or GT Sport; they’re available only on their respective automatic versions.\n\nYou won’t mistake the GT Sport for a true hot hatch like the Volkswagen Golf GTI or Ford Focus ST performance models, but it’s a lot warmer than the 2017 — enough to spice up your commute. A legitimate hot-hatch version, the performance i30 N, is going on sale in Europe, but there’s no word of it coming to the U.S.\n\nExcellent Handling, With a Few Bumps\n\nThe Elantra GT Sport gets substantial chassis upgrades over the base GT, with a sport-tuned multilink rear suspension versus the GT’s torsion beam, plus bigger brakes and 18-inch alloy wheels versus the 17s on the GT. But even the standard GT setup was surprisingly nimble on twisting roads, and the ride was pleasantly firm for a non-sporty trim. The GT Sport, though, can be pushed harder and faster with confidence, and the ride was just a hair busier in the base GT.\n\nOddly, the GT Sport didn’t feel quite as taut or confident when pushed as an Elantra Sport sedan I recently drove. And the steering, while OK, had more boost and less feel than the surprisingly good steering in Hyundai’s refreshed 2018 Sonata family sedan I’d driven a day earlier. Overall, though, the GT is a whole lot of fun — more than you’ll ever find in an SUV.\n\nUser-Friendly Tech\n\nMedia and safety technology once limited to high-end cars is standard in the Elantra GT and GT Sport. An 8-inch touchscreen system, with or without in-car navigation, is standard, along with Hyundai’s latest-generation infotainment system and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration; wireless phone charging is optional. The system is intuitive, quick to respond and has crisp graphics. A useful detail: You can mix and match AM, FM and satellite station presets on one screen. The available Infinity premium audio system includes Clari-Fi technology to boost the sound of compressed music files. The combination delivered very good sound from my phone library.\n\nAll models have updated Hyundai Blue Link connectivity for remote starting, locking and climate control (including the rear defroster and side mirror heaters) via phone or smart speakers, such as an Amazon Echo. For 2018, Hyundai is including three years of free Blue Link remote services as well as free map updates for models with in-car navigation.\n\nHigh-Tech Safety, at a Price\n\nThe 2018 Elantra GT had not been crash-tested as of publication, but it does offer — at a price — an array of safety tech once more common in high-end cars, rivaling the Honda Civic’s available features among the hatchback competition. Available systems include adaptive cruise control with stop-start capability; a front collision system with automatic emergency braking and pedestrian detection that operates up to 37 mph; lane departure warning and prevention; high-beam assist; blind spot warning; and rear cross-traffic alert.\n\nA novel addition is a driver attention alert that detects weaving, lane encroachment, sudden movements and loose grip on the steering wheel. I tried these intentionally and found that they worked, and I didn’t suffer any false alarms in normal driving.\n\nYou’ll get the full safety buffet, however, only if you pony up for the GT Sport with the automatic transmission and a $3,850 Sport Tech Package, which also includes a bundle of other features, including ventilated seats up front. The GT Sport does at least get standard blind spot warning and rear cross-traffic alert; those are optional on the automatic GT.\n\nValue?\n\nYes.\n\nThe base GT with a manual transmission starts at $20,235 including destination charge. That’s an increase of $550 from the starting price for the 2017. The automatic transmission adds $1,000. The base tops out at $27,335 with Tech ($1,800) and Style ($4,300) packages that ladle on amenities — an array that would make an entry premium car blush — plus a blind spot monitor and rear cross-traffic alert. The new GT Sport turbo version starts at $24,135; add $1,100 for the dual-clutch automatic. It runs up to $29,085 with the Sport Tech Package’s array of pampering features, plus a full suite of safety features.\n\nEither model, with or without the option packages, is more than competitive with — and in most cases priced a bit lower than — comparable versions of rival hatchbacks. Both GTs include free remote services and updates, plus Hyundai’s generous five-year/60,000-mile transferable bumper-to-bumper warranty and 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain coverage.\n\nThe standard GT can hold its own in driving and comfort with its rivals. The GT Sport won’t be mistaken for the more capable Golf GTI, nor does it attempt to be one. Think of it more as a GTI Light. But it can still put a smile into your daily drive while saving you perhaps a couple of thousand dollars for similar features, if not driving dynamics.\n\nThe GT and GT Sport, like other hatchbacks, also include the inherent value of SUV-like capacity to haul your stuff, but with a cheaper price, better gas mileage and more driving fun than small SUVs. Whether U.S. buyers are ready to bite on that, however, remains to be seen.",

      "expert_review": "At first glance, the 2019 Hyundai Elantra GT N-Line doesn’t look like much. That’s mostly because it looks pretty much like your run-of-the-mill Elantra GT — which isn’t the most exciting thing when it comes to styling. Sitting still, it sort of screams practicality but in a fussy way, not in a fun way (like, say, the Kia Soul).\n\nRelated: Hyundai Kicks Off Sportier N Line Models With 2019 Elantra GT\n\nBut the Elantra GT N-Line isn’t so stodgy when you get behind the wheel because it holds a secret under the hood. And if you peek at the wheels closely, you’ll see they come wrapped in Michelin Pilot Sport 4 summer tires, which come along with a tidy, standard six-speed manual transmission. This combination — along with a slew of suspension updates and increased stiffness (especially to control body roll) — gives the hatchback a big scoop of fun that I investigated on the canyon roads around Malibu, Calif.\n\nGood Under the Hood\n\nThe Elantra GT N-Line has a 201-horsepower, turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine mated to a standard six-speed manual or optional seven-speed dual-clutch automatic ($1,100). For me, the manual transmission is the way to go. Not only is it a pretty good manual, it’s also the only way to get the summer tires. That way you get to row your own gears and get more grip in the bargain.\n\nA well-suited companion for the car, this engine makes it feel quick and light, but in a controllable way. With the manual, it’s easy to keep the engine in its sweet spot, which ends up being fairly low in the rev range: By about 3,000 rpm, the Elantra GT N-Line is humming along pretty well, and any small throttle input at that point translates quickly into forward motion.\n\nIf this sounds familiar, it’s because the redesigned Hyundai Veloster also features a turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder that makes identical power numbers. There are some differences between the engines, however: The one in the Veloster has a higher compression ratio and different electronic control unit tuning that dials it up even more. But I found the drivetrain in the Elantra GT N-Line to fit that car better since it’s less of a performance-focused vehicle. How can you tell? The Veloster comes with a few key features missing from the Elantra GT N-Line that would make a big difference, starting with a torque-vectoring control system.\n\nOne Thing Missing\n\nThe suspension updates do a good job of keeping the Elantra GT N-Line sorted in the bends; there’s a bit of body roll, but it feels controlled. I like a bit of body roll in a car like this — the feedback helps you feel for the car’s limit and keep it under control. The summer tires also provide a lot of grip; they do feel in some ways overqualified versus the rest of the car, but I’m not complaining.\n\nProblems arise once you get on the power. If you really get into the accelerator pedal (especially in 2nd gear), there’s a good amount of torque steer, which you immediately feel through the steering wheel. It happens if you’re trying to punch it in a straight line, but it becomes most apparent trying to apply power on corner exits. The wheels start to hop and chirp as you roll onto the gas, so you have to be extra careful to get the car rebalanced before adding speed back on.\n\nHere is where the Elantra GT N-Line in some ways illustrates the difference between a good car and a fun car. There’s a weird sort of amusement that comes from the Elantra GT N-Line’s torque steer, which rears its head unpredictably and keeps you on your toes. It’s like when a pitcher in baseball throws really hard but doesn’t have much command: Anything could happen, which is exciting but also a little scary.\n\nContrast this with the Veloster R-Spec, which would fall more on the side of a good car (while still being fun enough in its own right). It is more proficient at both accelerating and going around corners thanks to its torque-vectoring system, which works to prevent torque steer and wheel hop. The Elantra GT N-Line sort of splits the difference; it’s got a performance engine but not the other mechanical bits to match, and it comes up short of being a true performance hatchback for this reason. It would be a stretch to say it’s very good, but I will readily admit that I had a pretty damn good time driving it around.\n\nMore from Cars.com:\n\nHyundai Tucson N Line Stays in Line With Sporty-Styled Siblings\n2019 Hyundai Veloster N Vs. Veloster R-Spec: Smiles Per Dollar Compared\nIs the 2019 Hyundai Veloster the Most Fun You Can Have for $24,000?\nResearch the 2019 Hyundai Elantra GT\n2019 Hyundai Elantra GT N-Line; Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\nWhat About Competitors?\n\nThe Veloster R-Spec is a natural competitor from Hyundai’s own garage, but I think the two cars have different aims. The R-Spec is a better performer, but it’s got only three doors and a dinky backseat; by contrast, the Elantra GT N-Line is much better at double duty as a practical hatchback with some whimsy added on.\n\nMy test vehicle stickered at $24,300 (including destination charges). That puts it right within range of the 2019 Honda Civic Si sedan. The Civic Si sedan costs about $1,000 more ($25,220) — and yes, I’m comparing only to the sedan version of that car because Honda refuses to make a hatchback version of it, which I would love.\n\nThere’s a lot of similarity between the two vehicles: The Civic Si’s turbocharged four-cylinder engine makes a touch more horsepower (205 versus 201) and it’s positioned similarly as a performance-focused variant. But the Civic Si also offers two features that make it a better performer than the Elantra GT N-Line in my mind: a limited slip-differential up front and an adaptive suspension. The Civic Si when flipped into Sport mode is a significantly sharper instrument; the tighter suspension and the ability to put down power sans torque steer make it much more confident when you’re moving quickly, and I’d also give it the edge in steering feel.\n\nBut it isn’t a hatchback, so the Elantra GT N-Line takes the edge on practicality. It’s got a much bigger cargo area, more headroom for passengers and if you drop the rear seats, you can fit a lot of stuff in its 55.1 cubic feet of cargo room.\n\nI came away from the Elantra GT N-Line quite happy with it. It’s the first of Hyundai’s N-Line cars, but it won’t be the last and I’m glad to find that it isn’t just a gussied-up trim package with no real performance gains — the additional power and beefed-up suspension components are a good omen for the next models to come, which will include the Tucson N-Line that was introduced at the Geneva motor show in March.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nHyundai’s Elantra trio (sedan, coupe and GT hatchback)  is getting a mild update for 2014. All models get a slight appearance massage, a new engine option and some updated audio units, while the sedan has its trim levels shuffled a bit, adding a new Sport model and replacing the GLS with the SE trim.\nExteriorThe most extensive changes come on the Elantra sedan, and include new front and rear bumpers, headlights, taillights, fog lights and a bit of chrome along the sedan’s beltline. There are also projector beam headlights for the sedan that also include LED light-pipe technology that looks like something seen on a concept car just a few years ago. LED taillights are new. Steel wheels are gone, with the Elantra now only offering alloy wheels across the board in 15, 16 or 17-inch variants.\nThe only changes to the coupe are new head and taillights, while the GT receives only new taillights.\nInteriorInside, not much has changed for 2014. New audio systems are available with revised head units and screens, and a backup camera display is now standard in the midgrade and navigation audio systems. One new color is added for the Elantra sedan, a two-tone black-and-beige package.\n\nOn the electronics front, Hyundai’s Blue Link multimedia service is now available in the Elantra lineup as part of the premium Technology Package. It will include three years of Hyundai Assurance Connected Care, which includes remote services like automatic collision notification, roadside assistance, automatic diagnostic trouble code notification, a monthly vehicle health report and in-vehicle car care maintenance scheduling.\nUnder the HoodHyundai has updated the Elantra’s powertrain, adding a new 173-hp, 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine to the mix. The Elantra sedan retains the 145-hp, 1.8-liter motor, while the Elantra coupe, GT hatchback and new Sport trim sedan get the more powerful 2.0-liter motor. Hyundai says that the extra power and refigured torque curve lop nearly 1.8 seconds off the zero-to-60 time for the sedan, dropping it from 10.8 seconds to 9.0 seconds. A six-speed automatic transmission is standard on the Elantra coupe and sedan, while the GT offers a six-speed manual transmission as well.\n\nThe Sport model for the sedan is particularly interesting. While the SE and Limited trims get optional electrically adjustable steering effort, only one tune is available on the Sport. It also comes with a thicker front stabilizer bar and softer springs but stiffer shock absorbers for sportier handling. Those optional suspension changes on the sedan become standard on the coupe, but the GT is unchanged, still offering the selectable mode steering and carry-over suspension.\nSafety FeaturesElantra’s safety systems are largely unchanged for the 2014 update, with the sole addition of a blind spot mirror.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: Estimated mileage ratings have been lowered to reflect a November 2012 EPA audit of this car’s stated mileage.\n\nThe 2013 Elantra GT hatchback is a new addition to Hyundai’s growing arsenal of Elantra models, including an Elantra Coupe that’s also new for 2013 and a hot-selling sedan that was redesigned for the 2011 model year. Compare Elantra body styles here. The GT is a stylish replacement for the Elantra Touring, which looked like a mutated wagon/hatchback version of the previous-generation Elantra sedan.\n\nThe 2013 Hyundai Elantra GT doesn’t settle for being just a utilitarian hatchback version of the sedan; it’s a more premium experience with a few tricks up its sleeve.\n\nThe GT takes a sport-minded approach compared with the comfort-oriented Hyundai Elantra sedan, so replacing the name “Touring” with “GT” is a good call. The name “Touring” implies laid-back driving through the countryside, while “GT” sounds more “go go go.” Both the outgoing Touring and the GT are an evolution of the Hyundai i30 hatchback sold overseas, which accounts for the numerous variations between the sedan and coupe.\n\nNot All Elantras Are Created Equal\nThe GT is a unique experience. While the Elantra sedan and coupe have similar interior appointments and styling, the GT’s enhanced style and pleasant materials give the hatchback a more premium feel than its counterparts.\n\nThe sedan is nice enough, but the GT uses less painted plastic around the center console and adds additional textured materials on the lower dashboard to create a unified look. The gear selector on automatic-transmission cars has a stitched boot surrounding the base instead of an ugly exposed stalk like the sedan has. Those little features pop, separating the GT from other Elantras. Other editors were also impressed, pointing out the superior quality of the optional leather seats and the more expensive-looking door panels.\n\nYou’ll find features on the GT that are absent from the sedan and coupe, like the optional panoramic roof and flip-out backup camera, which I’ll touch on later.\n\nHatchbackability & Interior\nCompared with the fugly Elantra Touring, this new, stylish hatchback pays a price in maximum cargo volume, which is down to 51 cubic feet from the Touring’s 65.3 cubic feet. To give perspective, the Elantra sedan’s total trunk volume is 14.8 cubic feet. Even so, the GT’s cargo room is large compared with other compact hatchbacks, like the Ford Focus, Mazda3 and Subaru Impreza. The Impreza is closest to the Elantra GT, with 52 cubic feet of space. (See the models compared.)\n\nOne of the Elantra GT’s tricks to maximizing cargo room is the backseat’s design. The bottom cushions flip up and forward, allowing the folded backrests to provide an almost flat load floor. A true flat load floor is rare when backseats are folded because the seat’s bottom cushions prevent the backs from resting flat. The GT’s load floor is “almost” flat because, while the small section of the 60/40-split backrest lays flat, the larger portion is slightly inclined.\n\nThough many automakers have moved away from this multistage seat-folding scheme, it’s beneficial for carrying level-sensitive items, like plants, as well as creating the most space from the floor to the ceiling. You can also leave the bottom cushions in place and make do with the ramp-like angle if your cargo is long but not too tall.\n\nIn the 23 cubic feet of space behind the raised rear seats, we fit two adult-sized golf bags flat on the floor.\n\nDespite the loss in cargo room compared with the Elantra Touring, the Elantra GT’s passenger space compares favorably with other hatchbacks in its class. The GT takes a 1.6-inch hit in legroom up front versus the roomy Elantra sedan, but I never felt uncomfortable in the driver’s seat, and I’m a slender 6 feet tall.\n\nI had more trouble fitting in the backseat, where the top of my head grazed the ceiling. I might have found a little more clearance without the optional panoramic roof. A Hyundai representative tells us there’s about an inch (0.9 inches) more rear headroom in models without the panoramic roof, though I haven’t sat in one yet. Otherwise, the rear is a comfortable experience. If I were an inch shorter I’d have nothing but nice things to say about it.\n\nGadgets & Gizmos\nIt’s no secret Hyundai packs a wallop of features in its cars for bargain prices. The GT is no exception: It not only includes a raft of standard features at its reasonable $19,170 base price (including a $775 destination charge) but it also offers optional features that are rare among economy hatchbacks. Notable standard equipment includes heated cloth front seats, a USB input, satellite radio, Bluetooth, BlueLink telematics system, a tilt and telescoping steering wheel and more.\n\nThere aren’t many features in sub-$25,000 cars that elicit ooooh and ahhhh responses, but the Elantra GT’s optional backup camera did exactly that. It’s incorporated into the rear Hyundai “H” badge, which flips up to expose the camera when the car is in Reverse.\n\nIt’s a slick feature, but every editor who drove the car noted the loud, mechanical sound the camera made when it opened and closed; I thought I had run over something when I put the car back in Drive to haul off. The backup camera is part of a Technology Package ($2,350) that includes navigation and smart key entry — but it also requires a $2,750 Style Package as a prerequisite.\n\nThe Style Package equips the GT with a panoramic moonroof, leather seats, 17-inch wheels, a sport suspension and more. Though not foreign to cars priced below $25,000, the panoramic roof is a notable feature that’s typically relegated to more expensive cars. With a power-retractable shade to shield the entire roof from the sun, the feature doesn’t feel like a budget add-on. I’m a fan of large glass roofs because of the open-air feeling of sunlight illuminating the entire interior. In the Hyundai Elantra GT, the roof’s front segment slides back like a traditional sunroof.\n\nA feature we haven’t seen in this vehicle class is the multiple-mode power-steering assist, called Driver Selectable Steering Mode, which is standard. A button on the steering wheel selects modes that vary how much force it takes the driver to turn the steering wheel. (Sports cars often have heavier steering wheels for precision driving.) In the GT, the different modes feel artificial; I preferred to use Comfort mode, which is the easiest to turn. Sport mode didn’t make the experience any more precise or sports-car-like.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe GT’s differentiation from the sedan continues in the driving experience. It’s fun to take on on-ramps with some speed. The GT is tuned for sportier driving, with a stiffer suspension than the comfort-oriented sedan. Our tester had the optional sport suspension, with calibrations tailored to the lower-profile 17-inch tires that made the car’s handling crisp and balanced. Both the sports suspension and the wheels are part of the $2,750 Style Package.\n\nThe Elantra GT is modestly powered, using the same 148-horsepower, 1.8-liter four-cylinder from the Elantra sedan and coupe. Being a few ponies down compared with the Mazda3 and Focus doesn’t cost the GT in acceleration because it’s more svelte, at around 2,700 pounds. The EPA rates fuel economy of the Elantra GT with a six-speed automatic transmission at 27/37 mpg city/highway, and the six-speed manual Elantra at 26/37 mpg.\n\nWhile the Elantra GT adds some extra fun to the Elantra lineup, overall it’s still not as tossable or composed as the Mazda3 or Ford Focus, which are stunners in this segment, sporting less body roll and additional road-holding ability.\n\nSafety\nThe Elantra GT earned a best five-star overall rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The Elantra GT has not been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. Being a different body style, the hatchback doesn’t share test results with IIHS testing of the sedan.\n\nStandard safety equipment on the Elantra GT includes frontal airbags, side-impact airbags for front occupants, a driver’s knee airbag, side curtain airbags for the front and rear, an electronic stability system and antilock brakes. For additional safety equipment information, see here.\n\nTo see how well child seats fit in the Elantra GT, see the Car Seat Check.\n\nElantra GT in the Market\nThe hatchback comes at a price premium compared with the sedan, which is typical for hatchback versions of compact cars. Checking in at $25,365 with options and destination charge, our fully loaded GT cost about $2,000 more than a fully loaded Elantra sedan.\n\nDespite the added cost, the GT’s hatchback usability — combined with a more premium interior, a sporty driving experience and trick features — means the extra dough is easy to part with.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "As compact car sales decline in favor of small SUVs, Hyundai believes some Americans are ready for a third option: a compact hatchback that hauls like a small SUV but offers the driving fun and economy of a car. Hyundai is doubling up in this niche market for 2018 with a redesign of its Elantra GT hatchback and a new, sportier trim: the GT Sport, with a turbocharged engine and upgraded chassis. The 2017 version was a one-size-fits-all single trim. As before, the 2018 Hyundai Elantra GT is an Elantra in name, but is actually a U.S.-badged version of Hyundai’s global i30 hatchback with different underpinnings than the U.S. Elantra sedan.\n\nThe 2018 Elantra GT faces growing competition that now includes six compact hatches: a freshened Volkswagen Golf, plus the Chevrolet Cruze, Honda Civic, Subaru Impreza (redesigned for 2017), Toyota Corolla iM, Ford Focus and Mazda3. Each is distinctive in one way or another; body style is the one common denominator. But having more rivals isn’t bad if it helps hatchback cars become less of an oddity.\n\nI went to San Diego to check out the new Elantra GT at a launch event hosted by Hyundai (per our ethics policy, Cars.com pays for its own airfare and lodging at such events). While there, I racked up miles in the city, in mountain canyons and in the desert in a base GT (with a full load of options) and in a GT Sport. Our Chicago-based editors also drove a manual GT Sport.\n\nLooks More Golf Than Gaudy\n\nThe 2018 Elantra GT was designed in Europe, where hatches thrive and the Golf is a leader. The 2018 Elantra GT is only slightly longer, wider and lower than the 2017, but it looks more so thanks to a Golf-like boxy design that replaces the GT’s former curvy look. It’s a shape that manages to be practical while still looking sportier than the 2017. The box is more aerodynamic than it looks, too, with a respectable 0.3 coefficient of drag.\n\nThe 2018 GT also bears more family resemblance to the Elantra sedan thanks to its horizontal lines and a version of Hyundai’s large cascading grille. The grille is flanked by functional air inlets with vertical LED daytime running lights. The headlights stretch up and around the corners into a strong horizontal character line that extends all the way into the taillights and a rear end that looks wider than it is; a standard rear spoiler also lengthens the look of the roofline. Full LED headlights and LED taillights are available on the GT and standard on the GT Sport, as are old-school round chrome exhaust tips.\n\nThe horizontal theme extends to the dashboard, enhancing the impression of space inside. And it’s not just an illusion; the interior is roomy for a car this size. The front seats are comfortable and sufficiently padded. The backseat is firmer but has reasonable legroom and headroom for two. If you opt for the dramatic panoramic moonroof, the interior seems even airier, but headroom for a tall (6-foot-2) backseat passenger is just adequate.\n\nThe Hyundai Elantra GT Sport has a sportier feel inside, with black leather seats and red accent stitching, as well as red satin-metal-finish accent trim. It also adds a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob. Heated seats are standard on the Sport; ventilated seats are available.\n\nThe materials and trim of the GT and GT Sport interiors are competitive with rivals such as the Civic and Cruze, but they have some hard-plastic touch points that make them fall short of the upscale feel of Volkswagen’s Golf line — arguably the leader — and the Mazda3. Noise levels are generally good, but we did hear some road noise on rougher pavement, particularly with the Elantra GT Sport’s bigger 18-inch wheels.\n\nA love-it-or-hate-it feature, there’s a standard 8-inch tablet-style touchscreen floating above the dash, flanked by buttons and knobs. Personally, I like the ergonomics; it’s easy to reach and see without looking down, though I’d prefer a less shiny surface. I know screens floating above the dash — used by Mazda and Mercedes-Benz, among others — are controversial, but I suggest you try it before dismissing it.\n\nIt Hauls Mass\n\nThe almost wagonlike new Hyundai Elantra GT shape offers about 8 percent more hauling space than the more rounded 2017. The cargo area is high, wide and deep, and it has a large hatch opening. We didn’t have a mountain bike on hand, but Hyundai says it will swallow one without removing a wheel. The 60/40-split folding backseat creates a nearly level floor with the two-position rear cargo floor at its higher setting, but to get maximum volume, you’ll have to put the rear floor into its lower position. Its maximum cargo room of 55.1 cubic feet with the backseat folded beats rivals such as the Golf (52.7 cubic feet), as well as the sleeker-styled Mazda3 (47.1) and Honda Civic hatchback (46.2). Space behind the backseat is a roller-bag-friendly configuration of nearly 25 cubic feet.\n\nThe GT’s space gives lie to the notion that you need a small SUV to haul cargo: Honda’s popular HR-V SUV offers just 24.3 cubic feet behind the rear seat and 58.8 cubic feet total. And while the Elantra GT doesn’t offer all-wheel drive, the five-door hatchback does everything a small SUV can do in most situations in most climates.\n\nTwo Flavors Under the Hood\n\nThe GT’s base 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine makes 161 horsepower and 150 pounds-feet of torque, both down slightly from 2017 (173 hp, 154 pounds-feet). EPA-estimated gas mileage remains the same at 24/32/27 mpg city/highway/combined with the automatic transmission; those numbers drop 1 mpg across the board with the six-speed manual (compare them here). The base engine is adequate, even fun, in most situations and will suit many buyers, though you’ll want to plan well ahead to pass a semi.\n\nThe better fit for the car’s personality is the new GT Sport’s 201-hp, turbocharged 1.6-liter four, an engine also used in Hyundai’s Elantra Sport sedan and the underappreciated Veloster Turbo coupe. The Sport’s power edge over the base model is magnified by the delivery of its 195 pounds-feet of torque, beginning at a low 1,500 rpm versus 4,700 rpm for the 2.0-liter. You can choose to stir the gears yourself with a six-speed manual transmission (Hyundai estimates a high 30 percent of buyers will do so), or you can opt for the crisp-shifting seven-speed dual-clutch automatic with steering-wheel paddles. The 1.6-liter with the automatic transmission is the top fuel-economy choice, EPA-rated at 26/32/28 mpg. The manual is the least efficient GT at 22/29/25 mpg.\n\nThe turbo was a ball for carving canyon roads with the paddles to manage the gears. It was a lot more confidence-inspiring than the base engine while passing on the highway, with plenty of power and automatic downshifts that were quick and smooth. Its low-end punchiness, with only modest turbo lag, would make a more satisfying choice for daily commuting. The dual-clutch automatic, like most of its breed, will stumble occasionally at low speeds.\n\nOther Cars.com editors drove a manual GT Sport in Chicago and reported it’s fun to drive, but having only six gears and a small engine means it’s not a rocket from a standing start. The engine doesn’t rev very quickly, suggesting a heavy flywheel — the norm for such a small engine. The clutch pedal is very light. The shifter is decent but has longer throws than we’d prefer. Also, you can’t add attractive tech and safety option packages to the manual-equipped GT or GT Sport; they’re available only on their respective automatic versions.\n\nYou won’t mistake the GT Sport for a true hot hatch like the Volkswagen Golf GTI or Ford Focus ST performance models, but it’s a lot warmer than the 2017 — enough to spice up your commute. A legitimate hot-hatch version, the performance i30 N, is going on sale in Europe, but there’s no word of it coming to the U.S.\n\nExcellent Handling, With a Few Bumps\n\nThe Elantra GT Sport gets substantial chassis upgrades over the base GT, with a sport-tuned multilink rear suspension versus the GT’s torsion beam, plus bigger brakes and 18-inch alloy wheels versus the 17s on the GT. But even the standard GT setup was surprisingly nimble on twisting roads, and the ride was pleasantly firm for a non-sporty trim. The GT Sport, though, can be pushed harder and faster with confidence, and the ride was just a hair busier in the base GT.\n\nOddly, the GT Sport didn’t feel quite as taut or confident when pushed as an Elantra Sport sedan I recently drove. And the steering, while OK, had more boost and less feel than the surprisingly good steering in Hyundai’s refreshed 2018 Sonata family sedan I’d driven a day earlier. Overall, though, the GT is a whole lot of fun — more than you’ll ever find in an SUV.\n\nUser-Friendly Tech\n\nMedia and safety technology once limited to high-end cars is standard in the Elantra GT and GT Sport. An 8-inch touchscreen system, with or without in-car navigation, is standard, along with Hyundai’s latest-generation infotainment system and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration; wireless phone charging is optional. The system is intuitive, quick to respond and has crisp graphics. A useful detail: You can mix and match AM, FM and satellite station presets on one screen. The available Infinity premium audio system includes Clari-Fi technology to boost the sound of compressed music files. The combination delivered very good sound from my phone library.\n\nAll models have updated Hyundai Blue Link connectivity for remote starting, locking and climate control (including the rear defroster and side mirror heaters) via phone or smart speakers, such as an Amazon Echo. For 2018, Hyundai is including three years of free Blue Link remote services as well as free map updates for models with in-car navigation.\n\nHigh-Tech Safety, at a Price\n\nThe 2018 Elantra GT had not been crash-tested as of publication, but it does offer — at a price — an array of safety tech once more common in high-end cars, rivaling the Honda Civic’s available features among the hatchback competition. Available systems include adaptive cruise control with stop-start capability; a front collision system with automatic emergency braking and pedestrian detection that operates up to 37 mph; lane departure warning and prevention; high-beam assist; blind spot warning; and rear cross-traffic alert.\n\nA novel addition is a driver attention alert that detects weaving, lane encroachment, sudden movements and loose grip on the steering wheel. I tried these intentionally and found that they worked, and I didn’t suffer any false alarms in normal driving.\n\nYou’ll get the full safety buffet, however, only if you pony up for the GT Sport with the automatic transmission and a $3,850 Sport Tech Package, which also includes a bundle of other features, including ventilated seats up front. The GT Sport does at least get standard blind spot warning and rear cross-traffic alert; those are optional on the automatic GT.\n\nValue?\n\nYes.\n\nThe base GT with a manual transmission starts at $20,235 including destination charge. That’s an increase of $550 from the starting price for the 2017. The automatic transmission adds $1,000. The base tops out at $27,335 with Tech ($1,800) and Style ($4,300) packages that ladle on amenities — an array that would make an entry premium car blush — plus a blind spot monitor and rear cross-traffic alert. The new GT Sport turbo version starts at $24,135; add $1,100 for the dual-clutch automatic. It runs up to $29,085 with the Sport Tech Package’s array of pampering features, plus a full suite of safety features.\n\nEither model, with or without the option packages, is more than competitive with — and in most cases priced a bit lower than — comparable versions of rival hatchbacks. Both GTs include free remote services and updates, plus Hyundai’s generous five-year/60,000-mile transferable bumper-to-bumper warranty and 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain coverage.\n\nThe standard GT can hold its own in driving and comfort with its rivals. The GT Sport won’t be mistaken for the more capable Golf GTI, nor does it attempt to be one. Think of it more as a GTI Light. But it can still put a smile into your daily drive while saving you perhaps a couple of thousand dollars for similar features, if not driving dynamics.\n\nThe GT and GT Sport, like other hatchbacks, also include the inherent value of SUV-like capacity to haul your stuff, but with a cheaper price, better gas mileage and more driving fun than small SUVs. Whether U.S. buyers are ready to bite on that, however, remains to be seen.",
