      "expert_review": "There are any number of sporting propositions on today’s automotive scene, and one of them is the l998 Hyundai Tiburon coupe.\n\nThe Tiburon, however, is a sporting proposition with a difference.\n\nIn an arena of high-buck motor cars, the two-door Hyundai lies in an affordable price range, accessible to the majority of drivers who want performance without mortgaging the family home.\n\nHyundai breathed new life into the sports coupe segment of the market by offering a high-tech, get-up-and-go car for a little more than $14,000.\n\nAvailable in two trim levels, Tiburon and Tiburon FX, the standard Tiburon has a suggested retail price of $14,399. If you want to go upstream a little, the FX is stickered at $14,899.\n\nAnd for that kind of money, you are not getting some shuffle-along econobox.\n\nBoth models are powered by a 2.0-liter (120.4-cubic-inch/1,975 cc) dual-overhead cam, 16-valve four-cylinder engine, with performance Michelin rubber, stereo sound and a variety of accessories.\n\nThe rounded design of the ’98 Tiburon incorporates carved character lines that result in a unique, sculptured profile.\n\nThe low, grilleless front contains projector-type, ellipsoid-shaped headlights and a one-piece, body-colored wrap-around bumper made of highly resilient thermoplastic materials.\n\nThe rear styling is aerodynamic and features a deck spoiler that offers enhanced stability at high speed. On the FX, the spoiler with integrated brake light is standard. Also standard are a rear wiper and washer.\n\nThe co-efficient of drag is just 0.33, with the styling overall translating into a sleek automobile.\n\nThe car is a four-seater, laid out in a 2-plus-2 configuration on 97.4 inches of wheelbase and 170.9 inches of overall length. That configuration generally is the province of two-seater sports cars.\n\nAs with all vehicles of the sporting type, there is more room in the front than in the back.\n\nFront seat legroom translates into 43.1 inches vs. 29.9 inches in the rear. If you’re planning on transporting a herd of Colts players, better try something with four doors.\n\nFront seating is the traditional two individual bucket seats divided by a center console. The layout is designed to resemble an airplane cockpit, with a wraparound contoured dash providing a home for the standard speedometer-tachometer-temperature-fuel instrumentation, plus controls and switches.\n\nThe trim level of the FX is, of course, above that of the standard Tiburon. Rather than cloth seat trim, an accentuating coordinated seat fabric insert is used. Also, an optional two-tone leather package that includes seats, steering wheel and gearshift knob is available.\n\nPutting all this in motion is a 120-cubic-inch-4 that puts out 140-horsepower. This is Hyundai’s Beta engine – the latest series of Hyundai-developed motors.\n\nGetting 140 horses out of 120 inches shows that the company is going in the right direction. However, this is a high-speed engine that gets its peak power at 6,000 rpm, and that generally denotes that it’s no stump-puller in the torque department.\n\nTorque is 133 foot-pounds at a fairly swift 4,800 rpm, good for 0-60 mph in the mid to upper 7 seconds bracket in five-speed manual transmission form. Top speed is around 120 mph.\n\nAs a concession to those who don’t want to do their own shifting. a four-speed automatic with overdrive is offered.\n\nThe car is a front-drive, a decided asset when flying through those right and left turn sweepers. Control is further enhanced by a rigid body and an extra reinforcing front crossmember that resists torsional movement.\n\nAdd to this 15-inch tires and aluminum alloy wheels on the FX and you can have life in the fast lane.\n\nBoth models have four-wheel independent suspension for ease of ride, no small feat with a small coupe.\n\nAn assist in giving the car a decent ride is the replacement of hydraulic shocks with gas-filled ab sorbers.\n\nIt is obvious that the Tiburon isn’t going to run with the ‘Vettes or the Ferraris, but then, you’re not going to buy those cars for $14,000. And at this price, you can still have fun getting there.",

      "expert_review": "Hyundai Motors’ 1997 Tiburon is a striking example of an automotive dream come true.\n\nOriginally introduced in 1993 as the Hyundai HCD-II concept car, the Tiburon is one of those futuristic sport coupes that made it into production.\n\nFeaturing bold design and spirited performance, the new front-drive coupe comes in standard and upgraded FX form, with both models enhanced by aerodynamic styling and advanced technology.\n\n“Customers are calling it The Shark,” said Jim Webb, Butler Hyundai’s general sales manager. “It’s got that pointed nose and eyes on the side.”\n\nThe Tiburon is a prime example of the longer wheelbase, shorter front/rear overhang school of design. Overall length is but 170.9 inches. The wheelbase, however, is 97.4 inches, with the chassis layout pushing the wheels out toward the four corners of the car.\n\nWhen the FX stands on its optional aluminum wheels and 15-inch Michelin tires, it takes on a decidedly muscular appearance.\n\nYou have to give the Tiburon an “A” for looks. Stylists have achieved a fluid exterior theme. Side panels are sculpted and integrate smoothly into a steeply raked windshield.\n\nSlim-profile roof pillars maximize the driver’s field of vision, offering 330 degrees of visibility. Side mirror housings have been designed to negate wind noise at high speed.\n\nThe sporty front air dam also is a high-design element that is specially formed to enhance air flow into the engine for more efficient cooling.\n\nAt the rear, the deck spoiler has an integrated brake light. Extra-large tail lights feature a unique ellipsoid shape and are tilted downward.\n\nAltogether, the body structure package represents a fairly decent 0.33 coefficient of drag, which translates into better fuel efficiency.\n\nFor some reason, apparently known only to Hyundai’s management, two engines that are within 10 horsepower of each other are offered. Both are dual overhead cam, 16-valve four-cylinder motors, one a 1.8- liter (109.4 cubic inches/1.795 cubic centimeters.) powerplant and the other displacing 2.0 liters (120.4 cubic inches/1,975 cubic centimeters).\n\nThe 1.8 is rated at 130 horsepower and powers the standard Tiburon. The 2.0 liter, the latest series of Hyundai-designed engines, powers the Tiburon FX and is rated at 140-horsepower.\n\nBoth motors are from Hyundai’s Beta engine family and, while the larger engine obviously is more powerful, it sure doesn’t put out as much power per cubic inch. The numbers here have the 1.8 developing 1.18 horsepower per cubic inch and the 2.0 liter 1.16 horsepower per cubic inch.\n\nIt makes one wonder why they didn’t just put the 2.0 liter in both models and be done with it.\n\nIn keeping with the sporting nature of a driver’s car, the standard transmission is a five-speed manual, with a four-speed automatic being an $800 option.\n\nThe automatic adds 66 pounds, so with curb weights running between 2,566 and 2,633 pounds and 130 to 140 horses in hand, the five-speed is going to be the more lively propositio n.\n\nThere really is not a major mileage differential between the 1.8-liter and 2.0-liter motors and five-speed and automatic transmissions.\n\nA 1.8 five-speed has a rating of 22 mpg city and 30 mpg highway. For the 2.0 liter, it’s 22/29. For the automatic, the 1.8 rates 23/31 and the 2.0 liter 21/28.\n\nThe coupe is a four-seater, with individual seats in front separated by a center console. A two-passenger formed seat makes up the back.\n\nThis is called a 2-plus-2 configuration in sports car terminology, and it also can be called intimate. With this type of automobile, there always is more room in front than in the rear. In the Tiburon, there is a drop of a little more than 3 inches of head and leg room from front to back.\n\nThe cockpit layout is state-of-the-art, with the console holding the shift lever quadrant. Stereo, climate controls and air vent are in the upward extension of the console. Instrumentation is the standard four-gauge speedometer-tachomenter-temperature-fuel.\n\nHyun dai’s Tiburon represents sports-type motoring at an affordable price, as the standard coupe has a base price of $13,499. Or, you can go upstream to an FX for $14,899. Options such as a premium stereo and leather are available.",

      "expert_review": "Don’t plant the bicuspids into more than you can devour at one sitting.\n\nOr, as they say in plain English, don’t bite off more than you can chew.\n\nA lesson Hyundai needs to learn.\n\nThe South Korean automaker is hell-bent on expansion. In 1999, it sold more than 160,000 vehicles, up 82 percent from ’98, and has its sights set on topping 200,000 for 2000.\n\nIn keeping with its growth theme, Hyundai is adding a pair of new vehicles in segments from which it has been absent–sport-utility vehicles and mid-size sedans.\n\nThis summer the 2001 Santa Fe sport-ute arrives built off the Sonata sedan platform. Santa Fe is slightly larger than the Honda CR-V and will start at about $17,000 with 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine and front-wheel-drive, about $20,000 with 2.7-liter V-6 and all-wheel-drive.\n\nFirst-year sales forecast is 20,000 units, double that amount the next year.\n\nJoining Santa Fe in the fall will be a midsize sedan sold in South Korea as the Grandeur. It will take on a new moniker here. The front-wheel-drive, V-6 sedan will compete against the likes of Toyota Camry and Honda Accord. Target price: $22,000 to $24,000 with power sunroof the only option.\n\nFirst-year sales forecast is 12,000 units. The sky is the limit after that.\n\nLooking ahead, Hyundai has a hybrid multiactivity vehicle in the works being displayed in concept form at the Chicago Auto Show as the CrossTour, or HCD-5. Like the Santa Fe, the all-wheel-drive CrossTour is built off the Sonata platform.\n\nNot at the show, and not in Hyundai’s plans, is a pickup truck of any stature.\n\nTime, perhaps, for Hyundai to stop and smell the decaf, however. All those growth and expansion plans are wonderful, but we recall back in 1986 when the first Hyundai arrived in the U.S., the tiny Excel.\n\nIt was a $4,999 new car that was supposed to attract people who normally would spend $4,999 on a used car.\n\nSales skyrocketed and, by 1988, Hyundai sold a record 264,282 Excels in the U.S., so many that some of the Japanese were looking over their shoulders at the upstart.\n\nThen quality issues caught up with quantity, and consumers went back to buying $4,999 used cars.\n\nHyundai shouldn’t forget how quickly fortunes can tu rn, because the car-buying public won’t let them. Once, my fault, twice your fault.\n\nThe reason the South Korean automaker’s plight in the U.S. came to mind is that we just tested the 2000 Tiburon, the sport coupe that may be the best-looking subcompact economy car in the market.\n\nFor 2000 Tiburon sports new front- and rear-end styling, its first redesign since entering the market in 1997 as the long-awaited production version of the HCD-I and II concepts that caused eyes to pop on the auto-show circuits for years.\n\nJust the right sheet metal curves and hood bulges on the outside for the look of sporty get-up-and-go performance.\n\nJust the right touches inside, too. Clever metallic-looking knobs to activate the controls. Everything within easy reach and use. Ample dimensions upfront so you don’t feel claustrophobic.\n\nSure, the rear seat has precious little room and unless you fold your head into your chest, your noggin will do a continuous dance against the hatchlid window. Best to drop the rear seat backs and turn the area into a cargo hold rather than try to stuff it with people. But most small sports coupes render the same indignity so it would be unfair to single out the Tiburon as unusual.\n\nAnd when you open the hatchlid, the cargo hold might not be super spacious, but it’ll hold the golf clubs or a suitcase or two or a few bags of groceries–just not at the same time. But as with cramped rear seats, small hatchbacks aren’t designed to serve as U-Hauls so that can’t set the Tiburon apart from the pack.\n\nWhere Tiburon starts to make you wonder how a car that looks so good fails to live up to expectations is when you turn the ignition key and start to drive.\n\nThe 2-liter, 140-horsepower 4-cylinder is for show and not go. It’s a high-mileage engine that obtains a 23 m.p.g. city/32 m.p.g. highway fuel economy.\n\nThe vehicle we tested came with standard 5-speed manual that was fairly smooth. But while a manual typically will wrestle every bit of energy out of an engine, regardless of size, there is just so much energy the 2-liter could give it.\n\nWe’ve often tested cars that look as if they would be at home on the track but are economy cars posing as muscle machines. Tiburon is one of those.\n\nYouth and those on limited budgets, such as first-time new-car buyers, often are more than pleased with a car that looks sporty but doesn’t intimidate them with aggressive manners they can’t handle. Good looks and great mileage can be an attractive package and in that respect, Tiburon delivers.\n\nBut Tiburon had one annoying problem that high mileage can’t compensate for. It squeaked and rattled and made too much noise.\n\nHyundai says pains were taken to reduce noise/vibration/harshness by making the body more rigid and adding more padding and squirting more foam into cavities. Needs more work.\n\nQuiet is the sound of a well-made car. Usually the bigger and the more expensive, the quieter a car is. Has to be to justify the size and cost. We accept that the Tiburon isn’t going to hum like an Audi TT coupe because it isn’t going to sprint from the light like one, either. But squeaks and rattles are not acceptable.\n\nAnd while Tiburon has fully independent, sport-tuned suspension, gas-charged MacPherson struts plus front and rear stabilizer bars, ride is more than a bit harsh. You feel every tar mark.\n\nBefore Hyundai gets all wrapped up in growth and expansion, we would hope it goes back to the insulation bin and gives the Tiburon a heaping helping–and fine tunes the suspension.\n\nThe Tiburon we tested starts at $13,999 and includes a host of standard equipment, such as air conditioning, power rack-and-pinion steering, four-wheel disc brakes, 15-inch alloy wheels with Michelin performance tires, power windows/door locks/mirrors, AM/FM cassette stereo, cruise control, intermittent wipers, rear-window defr oster, dual air bags, tilt steering, reclining front seats, split folding rear seat, remote hatchlid/fuel door/hood releases, cloth seats, quartz digital clock, side window defoggers, trip odometer and tinted glass.\n\nSadly, anti-lock brakes are available only as an option and only in a package that runs a startling $3,250 and includes CD/cassette player, power tilt sunroof, leather seats and deck-lid spoiler. Traction control is not offered.\n\nHyundai offers a very long warranty–five years/60,000 miles on the vehicle, 10 years/100,000 miles on the powertrain, five years/100,000 on anti-perforation to the body and five years/unlimited miles on roadside assistance.\n\n>> 2000 Hyundai Tiburon Wheelbase: 97.4 inches Length: 170.9 inches Engine: 2-liter, 140-h.p. 4-cylinder Transmission: 5-speed manual Fuel econ omy: 23 m.p. g. city/32 m.p.g. highway Base price: $13,999 Price as tested: N16,014. Includes $1,300 for option package with power sunroof, 100-watt CD/cassette, stereo and speaker upgrade; $130 for console armrest; $75 for carpeted floor mats; $450 for rear spoiler; and $60 for mudguards. Add $435 for freight. Pluses: Styling gem. Cabin decor very sporty and attractive. Mileage excellent. Pleasant pricing, though the rear spoiler is a hefty option. Minuses: Needs quiet as standard. ABS available only as part of a $3,000 plus option package. No traction control. >>",

      "expert_review": "Hyundai takes another giant step forward with its quick, enjoyable Tiburon sports coupe.\n\nTiburon for 2003 has been significantly changed and upgraded from a bland little cruiser to a fast and attractive craft that performs as good as it looks. In the Tiburon GT V6, there’s a hot little V-6 engine with a sweetly aggressive exhaust note, an optional six-speed transmission, handling that is lithe and balanced, and a well-equipped interior with supportive seats and an excellent stereo.\n\nAll for $18,000. In this price range, most automakers flounder with low-end base models that often offer little more than image, while Hyundai brings in a satisfying performer with few complaints.\n\nTiburon continues Hyundai’s march from obscurity, when it was building lumpish, unremarkable economy cars with a sour reputation for falling apart. In the past couple of years, Hyundai has moved up into the big leagues, with decent products and booming sales.\n\nFrom the highly successful Santa Fe sport utility vehicle, the Sonata family sedan, XG350 luxury sedan and now Tiburon, Hyundai keeps raising its standards and undercutting the competition.\n\nHyundai seems to have its quality problems under control, but one thing had me wondering. That was the shift knob, a two-piece assembly held together by what seemed like a sheet-metal screw. It kept coming loose and spinning around, even coming off in my hand. Nothing that a dollop of epoxy wouldn’t fix, but it made me question how the rest of the car was put together.\n\nOther than that glitch, I was pretty well impressed with the Tiburon. It’s really an object lesson on how much car can be offered for how little.\n\nPart of the budget equation is Hyundai’s reliance on existing components, such as the platform from the Sonata, which was tweaked by suspension engineers for greater response. Or the 2.7 liter V-6 from the Santa Fe and Sonata, still putting out 181 horsepower but delivering more spark in this lighter vehicle.\n\nThe base model Tiburon still soldiers on with a 140-horse four cylinder, with the base price around $16,000. That certainly would be adequate, but there’s no way the strong, flexible V-6 should be passed up, considering the performance edge it represents.\n\nThe optional six-speed – a five-speed is standard – shifts nicely, and the close gear ratios help keep the engine’s power band right in its sweet spot. There’s also an available four-speed automatic.\n\nAlthough the Tiburon is front-wheel drive, the torque-steer effect is negligible, and understeer is well-controlled. Handling is excellent, but the tradeoff is a stiff ride and tires that rumble and thump. On the freeway, the tire noise gets annoying. On city streets, formerly unnoticed irregularities become significant thuds.\n\nBut you have to admire engineers who chose handling over comfort for this sports coupe. On tight, two-lane roads, the Tiburon dances through turns, with quick steering response and so lid suspension control.\n\nThe look is sporty and distinctive with deeply grooved character lines on the hood and classic proportions to the fastback cabin. The 45X17 Michelins bolster the look , though they do contribute to that harshness and road noise.\n\nBeing a Tiburon, which is Spanish for shark, the gills behind the front wheels are both fun and appropriate.\n\nThe interior is roomy for two, but forget that tight back seat with its complete lack of legroom or headroom.\n\nAt its base price of $17,999, the Tiburon GT V6 includes all the goodies, including sport-tuned suspension; fog lights; 17-inch alloy wheels; power windows, locking and side mirrors; eight-speaker stereo with booming subwoofer; side air bags; leather seats and steering wheel; and cruise control.\n\nThe only options on the test car were in an UltraSports package, which included the six-speed, racy aluminum pedals and a towering rear spoiler (anyone over 18 should skip that affectation), all for $ 0. Freight and handling cost $495.\n\nIt adds up to a successful new entry among small sports coupes, affordable yet without compromises in performance or style. Plus, think of the amusement factor as your friends stare wide-eyed and exclaim, “That’s a Hyundai?”\n\nHyundai Tiburon GT V6\n\nVehicle type: Four-passenger, two-door hatchback, front-wheel drive.\n\nBase price: $17,999.\n\nPrice as tested: $18,744.\n\nEngine: 2.7-liter V-6, 181 horse power at 6,000 rpm; 177 pound-feet of torque at 4,000 rpm.\n\nTransmission: Six-speed manual.\n\nWheelbase: 99.6 inches.\n\nCurb weight: 3,023 pounds.\n\nEPA mileage: 18 city, 26 highway.\n\nHighs:\n\n– Nice performance.\n\n– Sporty styling.\n\n– Value pricing.\n\nLows:\n\n– Weird quality glitch.\n\n– Harsh ride.\n\n– Worthless back seat.",

      "expert_review": "Some enthusiasts have sniffed at the 2005 Hyundai Tiburon SE, the sportiest entry in the sporty Tiburon lineup. They say it looks more like a junior GT car than a hard-core sport coupe.\n\nWe say the Korean-built Tiburon is a fine offering in this segment, a vehicle that has managed to hold onto its looks despite hitting the market in 2002. The model we tested is an updated performance variant, which builds on the special edition package introduced last year.\n\nWe tested a Tiburon SE V-6 equipped with a single option, the $795 power sunroof. Bottom line: $21,389.\n\nHE: We were looking for a little amusement one night and decided to go to Hell in a Hyundai, rather than a hand basket. I’m speaking, of course, of the tiny town in mid-Michigan that seems to be a favorite of local bikers and meteorologists. It turns out the destination was not nearly as much fun as the route. The old saying has the road to Hell paved with good intentions. In fact, we discovered it was paved with the sort of twisty two-lanes where you can really appreciate the virtues of the Tiburon SE, especially its firm and controlled ride and its sweet little powertrain combo — a twin-cam 2.7-liter V-6 that makes 172 horsepower and comes mated to a six-speed manual gearbox.\n\nSHE: You want to talk about automotive hell, just spend a little time in the rear seat of the 2+2 Tiburon. It feels as if it were designed by Satan himself. No vents. No cup holders. No headroom. No legroom. You get one map pocket back there and one strange little bin built into the right side wall perhaps to hold those popular Hostess Snowball cupcakes that sell like crazy at the Hell party store, for obvious reasons. I would say the back seat passengers in the Tiburon don’t stand a snowball’s chance in you-know-where of being happy back there.\n\nHE: Alright, enough with the lukewarm jokes already. The Tiburon is clearly a car built for a driver and perhaps one passenger. From behind the wheel, the Tiburon looks and feels terrific. In fact, the plastic, leather and colorful cloth used in the SE’s cabin looked better to me than the stuff used in the interior of the new 2006 Mercedes-Benz M-Class we drove the same week. And even though the Tiburon may be getting a little long in the tooth, it still has an appealing exterior design that makes you think of a little Ferrari.\n\nSHE: I’m going to slip into my usual role as devil’s advocate here. I’m still worried about the rear-seat passengers. They get no air bag protection. Granted, the list of standard safety features on the Tiburon SE seems pretty good, otherwise. It includes standard antilock brakes and front-side air bags. But if I’m buying this car for one of my kids, I’m going to be worried about protecting the rear-seat passengers because you know they are going to cram people back there, regardless of how uncomfortable it may be to adults. I also want to say that while the workmanship looked pretty good on the Tiburon, we did hear some squeaks and rattles as we were zipping around that night.\n\nHE: Yes, and I got baptized pretty good by the windshield-washer fluid when I had the driver’s window rolled down. That’s one engineering flaw we noted.\n\nSHE: That and the too-heavy hatch with the less-than-perfect indentation to stick your fingers in and pull it down. I loved the sticker with the big arrow they had to slap on the inside of the tailgate to show you how to get the darn thing down. Stickers like that are always an indication that not enough thought went into a design.\n\nHE: You’re missing the bigger picture. Young kids who love to customize their cars are going to appreciate all the extras you get on the SE model, including a big spoiler, red front brake calipers, aluminum pedals and a Kenwood audio system with a CD and MP3 player. And Hyundai’s 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty is still a powerful incentive for buyers. In other words, the Tiburon still offers plenty of value in the $20,000 coupe segment.\n\nSHE: I had a lot of fun in the Tiburon, but next time I think Id be in a better mood if we had stopped at that other local landmark — a place called Serenity.\n\nAnita and Paul Lienert are partners in Lienert & Lienert, an Ann Arbor-based automotive information services company.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nFresh off last year’s restyling, the Hyundai Tiburon has few changes for ’08. The sporty compact sits somewhere between a mild-mannered coupe — think Scion tC — and a genuine performance car, like the V-6 Mitsubishi Eclipse. As such, it roughly competes with both.\n\nHyundai’s sporty two-door was first offered in its current body style for 2003. The car received updated front and rear styling for 2005, and it did again for 2007. Top-of-the-line SE models also added an electronic stability system and upgraded brakes.\n\nUpscale touches for the GT include automatic climate control and a leather-wrapped steering wheel, while the SE has a sport-tuned suspension and six-speed manual transmission.\n\nExterior\nStyled in South Korea, the Tiburon coupe blends straight and curved lines in what Hyundai calls an effort to “emphasize vitality and strength.” The body features a high belt line and a short greenhouse, with a steeply raked windshield and back window. Tiburons are equipped with all-disc brakes, which feature larger, cross-drilled rotors on the SE model. A fully independent suspension with front and rear stabilizer bars is standard on all Tiburons.\n\nBuilt on a 99.6-inch wheelbase, the Tiburon is 173 inches long overall. A deck-lid spoiler is mounted on the GT coupe, which has 17-inch alloy wheels. The SE model gets a high deck spoiler. The GS has standard 16-inch alloy wheels, but 17-inch wheels are available.\n\nInterior\nUp to four people can fit inside the Tiburon. Air conditioning, keyless entry, a CD stereo, and power windows, locks and mirrors are standard in all Tiburons. Automatic temperature control and cloth upholstery with leather bolsters are installed in the GT model. The seats in the GT feature red leather accents. Full leather seating is available. The SE coupe has aluminum pedals, metal-style trim, a trio of auxiliary gauges and a Kenwood CD/MP3 audio system. Cargo volume totals 14.7 cubic feet.\n\nUnder the Hood\nRated at 172 horsepower at 6,000 rpm, the 2.7-liter V-6 teams with either a four-speed automatic or five-speed manual transmission in GT models or a six-speed manual in the SE. The GS carries a 138-hp, 2.0-liter four-cylinder that mates with either a four-speed automatic or five-speed manual.\n\nSafety\nSeat-mounted side-impact airbags and four-wheel-disc antilock brakes are standard. For 2007, the SE adds an electronic stability system. Side curtain airbags are not available.\n\nDriving Impressions\nThe Tiburon’s shapely lines don’t quite translate to the sporty driving experience one might expect. In performance-oriented models, the ride is bouncy on rough pavement. Even though the car stays properly on course, it doesn’t impart a full sense of security.\n\nHandling is good; the GT coupe steers easily and maneuvers with some nimbleness in corners. Stable on the highway, the Tiburon takes curves reasonably well, but it falls short of some rivals. Road and tire noise is prominent, but the engine — if anything — is too quiet for easy manual gear shifting.\n\nThe Tiburon’s seats are supportive. Legroom and elbow space are good, but headroom is meager.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nHyundai entered the sport-coupe market in 1997 with the first-generation Tiburon, which joined the South Korean company’s line of value-priced sedans. A “harder-edge” design emerged for the 2000 model year.\n\nAfter sitting out the 2002 model year, a new Tiburon returned as an early 2003 model. Changes to this year’s Tiburon are modest. The four-cylinder engine gains continuously variable valve timing, and the V-6 adds 2 horsepower. The interior trim has been revised and the option packages simplified. The current front-wheel-drive Tiburon is built on a unique platform with a front subframe.\n\nExterior\nStyled in South Korea, the Tiburon coupe blends straight and curved lines in what Hyundai calls an effort to “emphasize vitality and strength.” The body features a high belt line and a “chopped” greenhouse with a steeply raked windshield and back window. Large, low-profile, high-performance tires help to impart an aggressive stance. The Tiburon is equipped with all-disc brakes, a fully independent suspension, and front and rear stabilizer bars.\n\nAt 99.6 inches, the Tiburon’s wheelbase is 2.2 inches longer than in previous models. The car’s overall length has increased by 2.1 inches to an even 173 inches. Fog lamps are standard, and a power moonroof is optional.\n\nWhen equipped with the V-6 engine and six-speed-manual gearbox, the GT V6 coupe gets a handling package that includes 17-inch tires and a tighter suspension. Alloy wheels hold 16-inch tires on the base model. A body-colored rear spoiler is installed on the GT.\n\nInterior\nThe South Korean automaker says headroom, legroom and shoulder room are larger in the 2004 model than in prior Tiburons, and cargo volume totals 14.7 cubic feet. Leather seating surfaces are available in the GT V6 coupe. A six-speaker stereo with a CD player is standard in the base Tiburon. Standard equipment includes air conditioning, remote keyless entry, power windows and locks, and a tilt steering column. The GT gets aluminum pedals.\n\nUnder the Hood\nHyundai borrowed the GT V6’s 2.7-liter dual-overhead-cam V-6 engine from the Sonata sedan and Santa Fe sport utility vehicle. Rated at 172 hp, it works with one of three available transmissions: a four-speed Shiftronic automatic, a five-speed manual or a six-speed manual. The base Tiburon carries a 138-hp, 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that mates with either the four-speed or five-speed gearbox.\n\nSafety\nSide-impact airbags are standard, and antilock brakes are optional.\n\nDriving Impressions\nThe Tiburon’s shapely lines don’t translate to the appealing driving experience that drivers expect. The GT’s ride is bouncy on rough pavement, but rebound is well controlled. Even though the car stays properly on course, it doesn’t impart a full sense of security.\n\nHandling is good; the GT coupe steers easily and maneuvers with some nimbleness in corners. The Tiburon is stable on the highway and takes curves reasonably well, but it falls short of some rivals. Road and tire sounds are prominent, but the engine is, if anything, too quiet for easy manual gear shifting. The six-speed gearbox is notchy and somewhat stiff, but the clutch engages smoothly for easy takeoffs. The seats are supportive, legroom and elbowroom are good, but headroom is meager.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nHyundai entered the sport-coupe market in 1997 with its first-generation Tiburon. After sitting out the 2002 season, a new Tiburon returned as an early 2003 model.\n\nDesign enhancements for 2005 included a new grille, lower fascia, headlights and fog lamps. A new entry-level GS model became available. Continuously variable valve timing was added to the four-cylinder engine installed in the GS. GT and top-level SE models are also offered.\n\nA new GT Limited trim has joined the Tiburon group for the 2006 model year. The GT Limited coupe features beige leather seating surfaces, side repeater lights, a power glass moonroof and a 440-watt Infinity audio system with an in-dash six-CD changer.\n\nAll 2006 Tiburons have fog lamps, and the GS can be equipped with a moonroof. A trip computer is installed on GT models for 2006.\n\nExterior\nStyled in South Korea, the Tiburon coupe blends straight and curved lines in what Hyundai calls an effort to “emphasize vitality and strength.” The body features a high belt line and a short greenhouse, with a steeply raked windshield and back window. Tiburons are equipped with all-disc brakes, a fully independent suspension, and front and rear stabilizer bars.\n\nBuilt on a 99.6-inch wheelbase, the Tiburon is 173 inches long overall. A deck-lid spoiler is mounted on the GT coupe, which has 17-inch alloy wheels. The SE model gets a high deck spoiler. The GS has standard 16-inch wheels, but 17-inch wheels are available.\n\nInterior\nUp to four people can fit inside the Tiburon. Air conditioning, keyless entry, a CD stereo, and power windows, locks and mirrors are standard in all Tiburons. Automatic temperature control and cloth upholstery with leather bolsters are installed in the GT model. The seats in the GT feature red stitching, which complements the leather-wrapped steering wheel. Leather seating surfaces are available in the GT. The SE coupe has aluminum pedals, metal-grain trim, a trio of auxiliary gauges and a Kenwood CD/MP3 audio system. Cargo volume totals 14.7 cubic feet.\n\nUnder the Hood\nRated at an estimated 172 horsepower at 6,000 rpm, the 2.7-liter V-6 teams with either a four-speed-automatic or five-speed-manual transmission in GT models or a six-speed manual in the SE. The GS carries a 138-hp, 2.0-liter four-cylinder that mates with either a four-speed automatic or five-speed manual.\n\nSafety\nSeat-mounted side-impact airbags and antilock brakes are standard.\n\nDriving Impressions\nThe Tiburon’s shapely lines don’t quite translate to the sporty driving experience one might expect. In performance-oriented models, the ride is bouncy on rough pavement. Even though the car stays properly on course, it doesn’t impart a full sense of security.\n\nHandling is good; the GT coupe steers easily and maneuvers with some nimbleness in corners. Stable on the highway, the Tiburon takes curves reasonably well, but it falls short of some rivals. Road and tire noise is prominent, but the engine — if anything — is too quiet for easy manual gear shifting. Hyundai’s six-speed gearbox is notchy and somewhat stiff, but the clutch engages smoothly.\n\nThe Tiburon’s seats are supportive. Legroom and elbow space are good, but headroom is meager.",

      "expert_review": "If you’re on the hunt for something a bit more interesting than the usual mass-market coupe, consider the Hyundai Tiburon. The restyled 2007 model sports a perky new look, and the optional V6 delivers brisk acceleration. V6 models start under $20,000 as the Hyundai Tiburon GS, making the Tiburon a compelling alternative to a two-door Honda Civic or Pontiac G5. Performance-oriented driving enthusiasts should save up and look elsewhere; as serious acceleration and top-notch handling go, there’s much better bang for a few more bucks.\n\n\nThis marks the second time the front-wheel-drive Hyundai Tiburon Coupe has received a face-lift since the current generation bowed in early 2002. Besides the bumper, headlight and fender revisions, the top-of-the-line Tiburon SE promises sharper handling and, for the first time in a Tiburon, an electronic stability system. Other trim levels include the base GS, GT and GT Limited. All except the GS have the V6. I tested an SE with a manual transmission.\n\n \n\nGoing & Stopping\nThe GS starts with a 138-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder, while other trims get Hyundai’s 2.7-liter V6, good here for 172 hp. Both engines team with a five-speed manual transmission or a four-speed automatic with a manual-shift mode. The Tiburon SE comes with a six-speed manual.\n\nWith 181 pounds-feet of torque on tap at a relatively low 3,800 rpm, the V6 delivers sprightly acceleration from a standing start through much of the rev range. There’s some modest torque steer if you push the car hard, but it never overwhelms the driving experience. The engine runs out of steam well short of its 6,500 redline, so keep the tachometer between 2,000 and 5,000 rpm for continuous power. Although the drivetrain lacks the ferocity of a V6 Mitsubishi Eclipse or the high-revving punch of a Volkswagen GTI, it feels a few steps quicker than the four-cylinder Eclipse — or Scion tC, for that matter — and it should prove beefy enough for anyone used to a non-performance car.\n\nShifting gears is something of a mixed bag. The gearshift’s throws are a bit long, and those accustomed to snappy footwork will bemoan the lengthy clutch. Some of our drivers objected to the near-dead pedal feel and abnormally high engagement. Still, the accelerator is sensitive enough for any novice to rev-match like a pro. I’m abysmal at heel-and-toe shifting, but those who do it should have no complaints, as the gas and brake pedals are positioned fairly close together.\n\nFour-wheel-disc anti-lock brakes are standard. The Tiburon SE adds red calipers and 12-inch, cross-drilled front discs, versus 11-inch plain discs in other trim levels. The discs are cross-drilled to enhance cooling and theoretically yield better resistance to brake fade. I couldn’t detect any fade after repeated hard stops, but the brakes never stood out as exceptionally strong for this class.\n\nThe 2007 Hyundai Tiberon V6 Coupe with a six-speed manual transmission gets an EPA-estimated fuel economy rating of 19 mpg combined. It gets an estimated 16 city mpg and 24 highway mpg.\n\nRide & Handling\nDepending on pavement conditions, the front-wheel Hyundai Tiburon’s handling ranges from respectable to troublesome. The Hyundai Tiburon SE offers a track-tuned version of the standard car’s MacPherson-strut front and multilink rear suspension, and it allows minimal body roll. Most trim levels come with 17-inch wheels and all-season P215/45R17 tires, and they deliver excellent grip — so much that I had to double-check to make sure they weren’t summer tires.\n\n\nThe steering wheel renders lifelike response without too much power assist, but it lacks the lightning-quick precision that sets cars like the Mazda3 apart. Take to the corners, and the chassis tends toward slight understeer. It’s remarkably neutral at its limits, never plowing wide too soon, as many front-wheel-drive cars do. The electronic stability system is a willing companion — it permits some understeer and reigns things in only as the rear wheels start to slip.\n\nHit a bump with the steering wheel anywhere off center, and things quickly unravel. The wheels will hop over any bumps while you’re making gradual curves, and in tight corners even the slightest rut sends the front tires dancing. This isn’t a deal-breaker for more modest drivers, but anyone looking to carve corners will want to consider a vehicle with more refined manners.\n\nRide comfort is minimal in the SE. The suspension makes for plenty of road noise on the highway, and it packs a brittle wallop over potholes and speed bumps. Other trim levels have softer tuning and presumably a more tolerable ride, so be sure to test drive one of them for comparison.\n\nThe Inside\nThe Hyundai Tiburon’s four-passenger cockpit had a trendy vibe when it appeared several years ago. Successive tweaks have had mixed results. The fog and hazard light controls now have flush finishes that would impress a Lexus driver, the dashboard has soft-touch materials and the blue and white gauges look sharp at night. Then there are the clinkers: Last year’s standard stereo has been swapped for an aftermarket Kenwood unit that looks and sounds like it was installed at a local electronics shop, and both the GT Limited and SE trims have some garish-looking red leather upholstery. Amenities like steering-wheel audio controls and an auxiliary jack for MP3 players are conspicuously missing, too.\n\n\nThose of larger build will find the cabin a bit snug. The front seats have aggressive side bolsters that pin love handles in place, and the optional moonroof hogs an inch and a half of headroom. I’m 5 feet, 11 inches tall, and my moonroof-equipped test vehicle left me with a case of hat hair more than a few times.\n\nVisibility is characteristic of most sports coupes, with a low roofline and high dashboard limiting views out the front and side. The narrow C-pillars make for a reasonably modest blind spot — something that can’t be said for the Eclipse, among other Tiburon competitors.\n\nLeave the backseat for the kids. There’s minimal legroom once front-seat passengers are situated, and with the rear hatch closed, headroom for adults is scant.\n\nSafety\nAs of this writing, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety had not crash-tested the Hyundai Tiburon. Standard safety features include all-disc antilock brakes, as well as dual front and seat-mounted side-impact airbags. The Tiburon SE adds traction control and an electronic stability system.\n\n\nSide curtain airbags are not available, and there’s nothing in the way of head restraints for backseat passengers.\n\nFeatures & Pricing\nWithout the destination charge, prices range from $16,695 for the four-cylinder Hyundai Tiburon GS to $22,095 for the V6 SE. Add $1,100 to trade the five-speed manual transmission for an automatic on most trim levels; a six-speed manual is the sole choice for the SE.\n\n \n\nAt $16,695, the GS includes power windows and door locks, air conditioning, remote keyless entry, fog lights and 16-inch alloy wheels. It also comes with the awful Kenwood CD stereo, and anyone who wants cruise control will have to cough up $1,150 for the Premium Package, which also includes a moonroof.\nThe $19,395 GT has a more attractive factory CD stereo, as well as the 2.7-liter V6, cruise control and 17-inch alloy wheels. The seats come in a leather and cloth combo, and it’s the only trim level where the leather is black.\nThe $21,695 GT Limited adds red leather seats, a moonroof, automatic climate control and an Infinity six-CD stereo.\nThe $22,095 SE adds a track-tuned suspension with upgraded brakes, an electronic stability system, a larger rear spoiler, auxiliary dashboard gauges and a six-speed manual transmission. Unfortunately, it also reverts to the Kenwood stereo and red leather and cloth seats, and it loses the automatic climate control and moonroof. The latter is a $900 option.\n\n \n\nTiburon in the Market\nHyundai says just over half of all Hyundai Tiburon buyers choose the four-cylinder GS. No doubt they like the vehicle for its fetching looks, generous warranty and long list of standard features. Tiburon GT buyers — the second-largest group, according to Hyundai — get the peppy V6 and a friendlier cabin to boot. I can’t recommend any of the higher trim levels, as the engine and suspension lack the refinement to play in the same league as a GTI or V6 Eclipse. If you want the cachet of a sports coupe with some extra zip, consider the sub-$20,000 Tiburon GT. If you have the cash for something more, get something more — from someone else.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",
