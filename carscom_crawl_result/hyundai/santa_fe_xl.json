      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Hyundai Santa Fe XL?\n\nRenamed for 2019, the three-row Santa Fe XL — formerly known as the Santa Fe — seats six or seven people in three rows. The SUV has a standard 290-horsepower, 3.3-liter V-6 engine that works with a six-speed automatic transmission. Front- and all-wheel-drive versions are available, and the Santa Fe XL can tow up to 5,000 pounds when properly equipped. Competitors include the Ford Explorer, Chevrolet Traverse and Honda Pilot. (Hyundai is launching a new three-row SUV, the Palisade, for the 2020 model year.)\n\nWhat’s New on the 2019 Hyundai Santa Fe XL?\n\nBesides the name change, the Santa Fe XL's available navigation system has a faster processor, a Favorites hard key and subscription-free traffic and incident data.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Hyundai Santa Fe XL Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include Bluetooth connectivity, a 7-inch touchscreen multimedia system with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity, dual-zone automatic air conditioning and LED daytime running lights. Also standard is a sliding and reclining second-row bench seat and a split, folding third-row bench. The second row can be equipped with captain's chairs, which drops the seating capacity to six.\n\nAn available Tech Package bundles adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning and automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, among other features. Other available features include a hands-free liftgate, leather seats, a heated steering wheel and an Infinity premium stereo.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Hyundai Santa Fe XL?\n\nThe Santa Fe XL's standard V-6 engine performs well, but third-row comfort is lacking and the interior is showing its age. With the Palisade set to arrive in the summer of 2019, Hyundai will soon have a new three-row SUV. If your car shopping situation allows, it might be worth your while to wait for it to arrive so you can see the two side by side.",
