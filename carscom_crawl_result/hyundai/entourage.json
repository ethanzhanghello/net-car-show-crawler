      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in August 2006 about the GLS version of the 2007 Hyundai Entourage. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what details are different this year, check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe Entourage is Hyundai’s first minivan, based on the second-generation Sedona from Kia, a subsidiary of Hyundai. Like its sister van, the Entourage is a model that impresses not only shoppers who are unfamiliar with the brand, but also those who have followed the South Korean brands’ improvements and growth. I tested the base, GLS, trim level, which is fairly stripped-down, but for the money it comes with many of the most important features, including high-value equipment like six airbags and an electronic stability system. More standard features come on the SE and Limited versions, which are competitive with similarly priced competitors.\n\nExterior & Styling\nIf you’re looking for high fashion, you’re shopping in the wrong vehicle class. That said, the Entourage is a nice-looking minivan — not as homely (GM) or polarizing (Nissan Quest) as some. The base GLS is respectably adorned with body-colored rather than low-rent black door handles and side mirrors. The SE and Limited trim levels have chrome handles. That these two add fog lights isn’t as notable as how the GLS treats its lack thereof: The spaces in the bumper, which are usually barren, have chrome domes. Slick. I can’t say I’ve seen this treatment before.\n\nAs for the wheels, 16-inch steel is standard on the GLS and SE. For the GLS, wheel covers are optional. The SE can step up to 17-inch alloy wheels, which are standard on the Limited in seven-spoke form.\n\nRide & Handling\nTo get too deep into the issue of minivan ride and handling would be pointless; they’re all lumbering vehicles, and there’s even less difference among models now than ever before. I found the Entourage’s ride quality to be comfortable but not too mushy. It handles well enough, with notable push, or understeer, when taking corners too fast. It is mainly in this type of at-the-limit driving that models act differently. I drove Honda’s Odyssey on a racetrack, at the company’s behest, and it definitely performed the best of any minivan I’ve experienced. I’m not sure how important this kind of thing is or should be. If you conclude that track performance portends better control in an emergency maneuver, then it’s a reasonable attribute to consider. I think driver ability trumps the other issues. The Entourage’s standard stability system goes a long way in assisting drivers as well.\n\nThe Entourage’s turning circle of 39.6 feet is about 3 feet wider than the Odyssey’s and the Toyota Sienna’s. Three feet is a lot when you’re making a U-turn, but I have to say I was always surprised by how easily I was able to nose the Hyundai into a parking-lot space.\n\nGoing & Stopping\nThe Entourage’s only engine is a 3.8-liter V-6 that sends 250 horsepower and 253 pounds-feet of torque to the front wheels only. (Originally reported here as 242 hp and 251 pounds-feet of torque, the specs were revised by Hyundai in February 2007.) For modest vehicles like minivans, I break acceleration down into three categories: not quick enough, quick enough and more than quick enough. The Entourage is certainly quick enough, though it won’t be setting any records, despite having a large engine. It underscores that engine ratings aren’t the last word in how a model performs. The five-speed automatic transmission does its job admirably, and it includes a clutchless-manual feature standard in case you want to pretend you’re in something other than a minivan. (I say give it up.)\n\nThe areas where Hyundai and Kia have been slow to catch up are gas mileage and pollution emissions, but the new generation, including the Entourage, make a huge step in addressing it. With ratings of 18/25 mpg (city/highway) — up from 16/22 in the first-generation Sedona — the new models are competitive, though not up to the best that Honda and Toyota offer.\n\nThe stability system means there’s also basic traction control. The brakes are four-wheel discs with ABS, again standard.\n\nThe Inside\nThe Entourage’s interior is similar to the Sedona’s, and that’s good because the Sedona has lifted every worthwhile feature and functionality from the minivan class leaders. The quality is in keeping with other new Hyundais: not just good enough to surprise the unsuspecting, but competitive with the big guys. It easily matches or exceeds the rather dated design and quality of the Chrysler and Dodge vans. That said, I’m not sold on my stripped-down GLS model’s velour-style upholstery, which appears on the door panels in addition to the seats. It gives the cabin a warmer feel than some of the new woven-cloth fabrics that are spreading throughout the market, but the latter give a higher-quality impression.\n\nOne downer in my GLS test van was that it was full of blank buttons — those placeholders that show where you would control a feature that you don’t have. Aside from the main windows and locks, this van had power nothing. The overhead console alone had seven blanks. There were three more on the steering wheel, three on the dash by my left knee and another one or two on the center control panel. Somehow I felt like every time I saw the overhead console it reminded me that I was a cheapskate and a loser. Hmmmm. Maybe that’s why Hyundai uses the blanks instead of a clean console. One look at that thing in the showroom and you order some options. Who wants to be taunted by a vehicle?\n\nMy van’s standard driver’s seat had a manual jack-style height adjustment, which is a breeze to use when seated. It has a generous range to accommodate tall and short alike. I noticed, though, that in swinging my legs out to drop to the ground when exiting I occasionally dropped on the lever and lowered the seat. There’s a continuously variable lumbar adjustment lever on the backrest’s left side. The passenger seat lacks this and the height adjustment.\n\nThough unpowered, the sliding doors were easy enough to use. Like previous van models, they don’t open as far when their windows are rolled down; this prevents passengers from lopping limbs off against the C-pillar. The other downside is that the doors don’t latch open unless the window’s up. If you park on a hill, they’ll close on you — well, hopefully not on you.\n\nMy complaints from the front seats are negligible. There are decent door pockets with integral bottle holders, a total of four cupholders including a drawer and the flip-up tray between the seats, two overhead sunglass holders and two glove compartments. The lower one locks and has a light inside — exactly the kind of feature that is often omitted to cut costs. Another bin at the base of the dashboard can hold a generous handful of CD cases.\n\nThe second-row captain’s chairs slide fore and aft, and both are flanked by a pair of swing-down armrests; there’s no feeling that Hyundai has skimped. There’s ample headroom, and legroom is decent for a 6-foot adult when the seat is slid back all the way. My knees were raised somewhat, making it less comfortable than the Toyota Sienna, whose seats are a bit higher, but it’s better than some other models, including the Nissan Quest and the Chrysler and Dodge vans with Stow ‘n Go. (They’re about as uncomfortable to sit on as they are compelling to fold.)\n\nThird-row access is eased by a second row that folds and tumbles forward in one motion. The bench is good for three kids or two adults. Legroom is quite good, even with the second row fully back, though one sits lower to the floor here than in the second row. The rear head restraints collapse deep into the backrests for visibility and ease of folding — and they demand that you raise and use them; otherwise they jab you in the back. Straps on either side allow you to adjust the angle of the 60/40-split backrest segments. There’s a dedicated dome light and overhead vents, as in the other seat rows, and three cupholders total for drinks of varying sizes. There’s a little storage in the left armrest. The seatbacks in front of this row don’t have pockets, but they present plastic trays when folded down — supposedly for Happy Meals and such.\n\nSafety\nAs of this review, the Entourage and its Sedona sister are the top-rated minivans in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s crash tests, earning Gold Top Pick status for their performance in frontal, side and rear impacts. The results certainly rely on the standard safety features, including side-impact torso airbags for the front-seat occupants, curtain airbags that line the side windows of all three seat rows in a side impact, and active head restraints for the front seats. The Entourage’s stability system is another critical, high-value standard feature that — when offered in other vans — is often optional. There’s a shoulder belt and head restraint for all seats.\n\nCargo & Towing\nMinivans are the true utility vehicles, with loads of interior room relative to their exterior size. With the same cargo dimensions as the Sedona, the Entourage falls slightly behind the majority of other minivan models, but the difference is likely to go unnoticed by most drivers.\n\nCargo Capacities Compared (cu. ft. volume)\n\tDodge\nGrand Caravan\tHonda Odyssey\tHyundai Entourage\tToyota Sienna\nBehind third-row seat\t26.4\t38.4\t32.2\t43.6\nSecond row folded or removed\t54.9\t91.1\t80.2\t94.5\nAll seats folded or removed\t160.7\t147.4\t141.5\t148.9\nSource: Manufacturer data\n\nA direct copy of the Sienna, the Entourage uses powerful spring-loaded mechanisms to guide the 60/40-split third-row segments into the well behind them to create a flat cargo floor. Ostensibly they can be operated with one hand, but it might require an extra shove to get them down all the way. Overall, it’s practically effortless.\n\nThe second-row captain’s chairs are as easy to fold and tumble forward, as shown in the photos, but removing them is another story. Releasing them from their anchors requires muscle, as does lifting them; they weigh more than 60 pounds apiece. Neither this nor the struggle to line them up and reattach them is Hyundai’s alone. All vans are pretty bad in this regard, and attaching seats improperly can be extremely dangerous. If not secure, they can come loose in a collision and injure their occupant and others. Toyota recently recalled its captain’s chairs for this reason, and I highly suspect this will become a marketwide issue.\n\nOnce all rear seats are folded or removed, the Entourage can contain 4×8-foot sheets of building material flat on the floor with the liftgate closed. There’s a drawback, though: The hatch opening is too narrow along the floor, so the stock must be raised a few inches to load it (see the photos). It’s workable, but it will be harder with heavy materials like drywall or plywood because it can’t be slid in.\n\nThe towing capacity is 3,500 pounds for a trailer with its own brakes. If relying on the Entourage’s braking, the maximum is 1,000 pounds.\n\nEntourage in the Market\nThe Kia Sedona was the Korean model that showed how competitive the country’s exports had become. Developed in North America, it came out of the chute prepared to go toe-to-toe not with the average van but with the class leaders, at least in terms of design and features. Quality was nothing to laugh at either. The new generation is better still, and so is this new Hyundai version.\n\nWhy do there have to be two similarly priced versions from what is basically the same company? It’s because the Sedona is successful enough to justify spreading the wealth to eager Hyundai dealers, rounding out a complete product lineup. To you, the buyer, the difference simply boils down to features and price. The equipment is similar, and both brands carry the aptly named America’s Best Warranty of 5/60,000 (years/miles, whichever comes first) bumper-to-bumper and 10/100,000 drivetrain. The best way to compare is to click on the Side-by-Side Comparison link atop this page and select the Sedona or any other minivan model you’re considering.\n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "Despite predictions of its impending death that have been swirling around the minivan since the sport utility craze began in the early ’90s, this vehicle class is alive and well.\n\nAbout 1 million new minivans will be sold this year, which is down about 10 percent from last year and 20 percent from 2000.\n\nBut industry experts expect the segment to stabilize at about this year’s level, and there is money to be made in any segment that can garner a million units worth of sales in a year.\n\nYes, General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co., which have never had much success in the minivan market anyway, plan to abandon it altogether within the next three years or so, but there are still plenty of players left, and plenty of customers.\n\nGM and Ford’s problem is that they have never really fielded a viable entry in the market that was created by the launch of the Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager in 1984. Today, the minivan is still Chrysler Group’s biggest-selling car product; the automaker holds about a 40 percent share of the market.\n\nFor instance, the best-selling Caravan accounted for nearly 227,000 sales last year, and the Chrysler Town & Country and Voyager models, nearly 181,000.\n\nThe other two big players are the Honda Odyssey, whose sales totaled 174,000-plus last year, and the Toyota Sienna, with more than 164,000 sold.\n\nBut the South Koreans have two quite solid players in the segment: the Kia Sedona, introduced in its second generation just last year, and the all-new Hyundai Entourage, the first minivan from South Korea’s largest automaker.\n\nThe Entourage, our test vehicle for the week, almost never came to market.\n\nAfter Kia, a subsidiary of Hyundai, rolled out the newest Sedona for 2006, Hyundai announced it would create a minivan using the Sedona platform, and would call it the Entourage.\n\nA few weeks later, though, Hyundai shifted gears and said it would not introduce a minivan after all, and the project was thought to be dead.\n\nThen a few weeks later, the Entourage was back on again, probably because of pressure from Hyundai’s U.S. dealers, who had been clamoring for a minivan for years. Introduced this fall was the Entourage, a near clone of the Kia model, and by all reports, it’s selling very well — just as the Sedona is.\n\nIt didn’t hurt that the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety put the Entourage and Sedona on its short list — 13 total — of vehicles that are the group’s Top Safety Picks for 2007, the only minivans to make the list.\n\nThe list is based on ratings from the institute’s rigorous crash-testing program; after testing the Sedona shortly after the redesigned model went on sale last year, the institute said it was the “safest minivan ever tested.”\n\nThe 2007 Entourage, which was not tested, received the same rating as the Sedona because the two vehicles are functionally identical.\n\nThat the Hyundai and Kia models made the prestigious Top Safety Picks list, to the exclusion of such popular minivans as the Odyssey and Sienna, is quite a coup for the South Korean automaker.\n\nAnd, of course, the company is using the safety honor as part of its marketing campaign for both of its minivans.\n\nThe Entourage, in Hyundai product literature and news releases, is touted as having “more safety, more room and more value than the Odyssey,” the vehicle that Hyundai used as a benchmark.\n\nSo besides safety, what’s so great about the Entourage?\n\nFirst, there is the value. It’s a minivan whose features go head to head against the top competitors, yet the price is less, a Hyundai hallmark.\n\nA well-equipped Entourage, with electronic stability control, six air bags, the active front head restraints, roof rack rails, tilt steering wheel, cruise control, keyless entry, AM-FM-CD player, front wiper de-icer and three-zone climate control, is $23,795, which is “more than $1,500 less than a Honda Odyssey LX,” Hyundai says.\n\nThere are the obvious minivan necessities that are helping it win consumers, such as its dual power sliding rear doors with power windows; middle and rear seats that fold to increase cargo space dramatically, including a third-row seat that folds completely into the floor; front and rear air conditioning, with dual front controls; power adjustable pedals; and even such options as leather upholstery, a power tailgate and heated seats.\n\nThere is an available DVD rear entertainment system, a backup warning system, and a premium Infinity audio system with in-dash CD player and surround sound, as well.\n\nThe Entourage is a good performer, too, thanks to its all-aluminum, 3.8-liter V-6 engine, which turns out 250 horsepower and 253 foot-pounds of torque. That’s on par with the Odyssey and Sienna, and more horsepower than the Ford Freestar, Caravan and Chevrolet Uplander, for instance.\n\nThat engine, which also is environmentally friendly because of its ultra-low-emissions certification, is connected to an advanced, computer-controlled five-speed automatic transmission.\n\nThis combination gives the Entourage (and Sedona) EPA fuel-economy estimates of 18 miles per gallon in the city and 25 mpg on the highway — better than most other vehicles on the market that can hold up to seven people and their stuff.\n\nCargo space behind the third row of seating is more than 32 cubic feet. That can expand to more than 80 cubic feet with the 60/40 split-rear seat folded completely into the floor, and to 141 cubic feet with the rear seat folded and the two middle seats folded and tilted forward.\n\nThe van can even tow a trailer weighing up to 3,500 pounds if the trailer is equipped with brakes; otherwise, the limit is 1,000 pounds, which is enough for a small boat or one-horse trailer.\n\nAmong safety features standard on all models are the stability control, four-wheel antilock disc brakes, and side-curtain air bags for all three rows of seating.\n\nAll seating positions come with three-point seat belts and adjustable headrests.\n\nThe vans also come with a tire-pressure monitoring system, which reports to the driver the pressure of each tire, and gives an alert if even one of the tires is improperly inflated.\n\nThe van’s unibody construction — frame and body are combined in one unit — helps give it a smooth, quiet, carlike ride, and the 118.9-inch wheelbase and 66.3-inch track width help keep the vehicle quite stable, even in tight turns.\n\nAnd speaking of tight turns, the Entourage has a very convenient turning radius of just 39.6 feet.\n\nEntourage models have either 16-inch steel or 17-inch alloy wheels, depending on the trim level.\n\nThree levels are offered: the base GLS, the midlevel SE and the top-of-the-line Limited, which includes leather.\n\nOur test model was the SE, with a starting price of $26,295 plus $700 freight. That includes tri-zone automatic climate control, 17-inch alloy wheels, dual power sliding doors, fog lights, dual heated power mirrors, power driver’s seat, leather-wrapped steering wheel with built-in audio controls, roof rails and more.\n\nOptions on ours included the premium entertainment package ($2,900), which added the Infinity audio system, rear DVD, heated front seats, backup warning system, universal garage/gate opener, and an electrochromatic rearview mirror; and carpeted floor mats ($175).\n\nTotal sticker was $30,070 including freight and options, but it had just about everything except for the leather upholstery.\n\nG.
