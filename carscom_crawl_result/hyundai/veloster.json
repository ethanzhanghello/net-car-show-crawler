      "expert_review": "Driving the four-seat 2012 Hyundai Veloster for two weeks was as energizing as downing a doppio espresso via IV drip and exactly the kick in the pants I needed after driving clone after clone of bland, boring cars.\n\nYou know that amazing feeling when you walk out of the hair salon after getting a fabulous seasonal shape up and highlight refresh? It gives you just a little extra sway to your swagger, and the Veloster is that feeling in car form. For men who may not know this “new hairstyle high,” just drive the Veloster. Besides being fun, it’ll give you a little extra insight into the female mind (brownie points!).\n\nEvery Hyundai I’ve driven lately has impressed me in some fashion, and the Veloster is no exception, delivering especially high marks in the … well, fashion department. There really isn’t anything on the road that comes close to resembling the Veloster, but in theory it competes with the Honda CR-Z, Mini Cooper and Scion tC. See all of them compared here.\n\nMy test car sported a 138-horsepower, 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine, a six-speed manual transmission and front-wheel drive. A six-speed automatic is also available. Keep your eyes peeled for 2013’s zippier turbo version, as well.\n\nEXTERIOR\nWith its youthful, edgy, mutated coupe-hatch-sedan look, the Veloster is the most innovative vehicle design I’ve come across in years. While it may have been designed more specifically for younger consumers, somehow the Veloster’s appeal transcends even generational taste differences.\n\nMy 69-year-old mother was ready to trade in her bright yellow Ford Focus for the equally fun colors available on the Veloster. Lime green, she said, would be even harder for her to lose in a big parking lot. She could also use the remote access feature of Hyundai’s Blue Link (more info on that below in the Safety section) to activate the horns and lights on the car from her phone when she really loses it — the car, that is. As an artist, my mom loved the functional hatchback that would let her easily haul canvases to and from art shows.\n\nMy 16-year-old nephew loved the sleek, unique lines of the Veloster. At 6-foot-2 with huge shoulders and flaming red hair, he’s never been one to shy away from attention. The Veloster’s $17-grand price tag was also attractive to him; it seemed like a doable goal with the Christmas and birthday money he’s been stockpiling to buy his own car soon. (Apparently it’s not cool to pick your date up in your granny’s yellow Ford.)\n\nMy 11-year-old daughter was a huge fan of the hidden third door in the Veloster. She loved the ease of getting in and out of the backseat through her own door, rather than having to squeeze herself and her oversized backpack around the front seat as in a traditional coupe. She also got a kick out of it when the teachers in the carpool lane couldn’t figure out how to open the door — the black handle is cleverly concealed within the triangular black windowpane. She’d jump out and exclaim, “This car has three doors, isn’t that cool? It’s the Hyundai Veloster,” obviously proud of herself for trumping her teachers’ car knowledge. I might have to reel that in a little bit.\n\nFAMILY-FRIENDLY FEATURES\nWhile the Veloster isn’t a family room on wheels — like larger families desire — it is certainly functional for a family of three or four, or as an extra car for zooming around town. It seats four total, with the previously mentioned extra door on the curb side for backseat passengers. To me, the backseat never felt cramped thanks to the huge panoramic moonroof in my test car, part of an optional $2,000 Style Package. The moonroof, in conjunction with the large windshield and the expanse of glass on the hatchback, made the car feel like its entire roof was made of glass.\n\nWhile my two girls (ages 9 and 11 and below average in height) had enough legroom, it started to get tight for them in the backseat when they added their backpacks. The Veloster’s rising belt line unfortunately created a visibility problem for my kids, who couldn’t see out their side windows. While they mentioned the problem once or twice, it didn’t seem to be a major complaint. However, for families with little ones who suffer from regular carsickness, this car might not be a good option.\n\nThe Veloster has three interior color options: solid black, solid gray or the black and red my test car came dressed in. The fit and finish inside looks much more expensive than the price tag would have you believe, with black and red textured inserts in the red, available imitation-leather seats and similar soft-touch inserts in the door panels.\n\nThe Veloster’s hatchback design gives it a large cargo space, big enough to fit a huge plastic bin overflowing with all the stuff my girls haul with them to their dad’s house for the weekend (laptops, backpacks, favorite pillows, stuffed animals, blankies, snow boots, jackets and snow pants “just in case”) with plenty of room leftover.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Groove-On\n\nBEHIND THE WHEEL\nThe manual 2012 Hyundai Veloster is fun to drive. The bolstered front seats (also part of the $2,000 Style Package) hug you tightly just in case you happen to take a corner quickly. I would love to take a spin in the automatic version for comparison’s sake; while a manual is fun for a while, driving one as a mom gets tiresome after a bit. (See editor Joe Wiesenfelder’s impressions of the automatic in a separate review.)\n\nThe Veloster’s sporty suspension was a little rough for my taste, and that would be the only thing keeping me from purchasing one. With all the driving I do on a daily basis, I’m growing to prefer a softer ride, but that’s a subjective observation. You’d have to drive one yourself to determine where your taste lies.\n\nThe Veloster accelerates adequately around town, but it’s not as powerful as I’d like when getting up to speed to merge onto the highway. Hence the benefit of next year’s turbo addition to the Veloster lineup.\n\nSAFETY\nAs of this review, the 2012 Hyundai Veloster hadn’t been crash-tested. Dual front airbags, dual front side-impact airbags and side curtain airbags extending to both rows are standard in the Veloster. As is required in all 2012 models, the Veloster also has standard antilock brakes, an electronic stability system and traction control.\n\nThe lower Latch child-seat anchors in the Veloster’s backseat are easy to access and use; they’re recessed shallowly enough in the seat bight to reach with human hands (rather than the mythical mechanical robot hand required in so many cars). And because there’s a third door for the backseat passenger, installing a child safety seat on that side is definitely doable, though the tight space creates an issue for rear-facing infant seats, assuming the passenger in front would also like space for his or her legs. Kids in the backseat have seat belt buckles that are on stable bases, making them easy enough for children of all dexterity levels to buckle up independently. See the Car Seat Check for more details on different child safety seat types in the Veloster.\n\nHyundai’s Blue Link system comes standard in the Veloster, along with a free trial period of Blue Link Assurance, which provides roadside assistance or SOS emergency assistance. Blue Link also offers an optional Essentials subscription, which is one of my favorite new safety features that’s especially fantastic for families with teen drivers. Among plenty of other things, Blue Link Essentials allows a parent to customize the car with a “geofence,” curfew driving times and a speed limit specifically for teen drivers. If the driver exceeds any of these parameters, the parent is notified immediately via text, email or automated phone message. While it’s a great idea for any family with a teen driver to set rules and expectations in advance with a teen driving contract, Blue Link helps parents monitor the terms of that contract.\n\nSee all the Veloster’s standard safety features here.\n\nSend Kristin an email",

      "expert_review": "The second-generation Hyundai Veloster retains the kind of quirky design cues that helped set its predecessor apart, things like three conventional doors — one on the driver’s side and two on the passenger side — and a raked roofline. With this redesign, however, Hyundai has brought that offbeat sense of style into the cabin.\n\nThe 2019 Veloster starts at $19,385, including an $885 destination charge. We tested two versions of the car: a top-of-the-line Ultimate trim level and an R-Spec trim priced at $29,160 and $23,785, respectively. Both trims had the optional 201-horsepower, turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine instead of the standard 147-hp, 2.0-liter four-cylinder. The Ultimate had an optional seven-speed dual-clutch transmission, while the R-Spec had a six-speed manual with a B&M Racing shifter.\n\nIs It Fun to Drive?\n\nThe modern-day Mini Cooper has been a standard-bearer for driving fun, and the 2019 Veloster imitates many of its characteristics — if not to such an extreme. Like the turbocharged engine of the Cooper S, the Veloster’s turbo four-cylinder is strong enough to give it some zip in the city as well as passing power on the highway. Ride quality is another similarity with the Mini: The Veloster’s firm suspension keeps body motions in check, but it doesn’t result in a harsh ride. (Compared with base-engine Velosters, turbo-engine versions get thicker front and rear stabilizer bars.) The Veloster’s steering, meanwhile, isn’t as heavy as the Mini’s, but it does feel natural with appropriate weighting and is one of the most dramatic improvements over the previous Veloster.\n\nI was worried the dual-clutch transmission might be a little balky, as they can be, but instead I was impressed with its overall refinement; it has the smoothness of a conventional automatic and makes quick upshifts. It hesitated on kickdown one time on the highway, and it would have been better if its manual-mode gear changes were a little quicker in the car’s Normal setting, but the transmission worked well overall.\n\nThe Veloster has three driving modes — Normal, Sport and Smart — and the differences between Normal and Sport are marked. Selecting Sport makes the gas pedal more responsive, eliminating much of the lag present in Normal. It also gives the steering wheel greater heft (though it doesn’t improve steering feedback), lets the engine rev higher before upshifts occur and makes manual-mode shifts quicker. The Sport mode’s main drawback is that the driving experience is jerkier in everyday driving.\n\nThe R-Spec’s six-speed manual is the best Hyundai stick shift I’ve driven, and it isn’t far behind the exceptional stick shifts in the Fiat 124 Spider and Honda Civic Type R. The B&M stick is canted forward slightly; as a result, I ended up in 4th gear a few times thinking I was in Neutral, but the shifter’s throws are short and have a satisfying mechanical feel. The clutch pedal isn’t too heavy or springy. It’s forgiving, too.\n\nIs the Cabin Comfortable and Refined?\n\nEven with the standard height-adjustable driver’s seat raised, the Veloster still has a low driving position. You feel the car’s low roofline, too, but there’s enough legroom for taller drivers to settle in.\n\nThe Ultimate’s leather-trimmed bucket seats are comfortable, with side bolsters that aren’t overly restrictive. I also like the R-Spec’s unique cloth-covered seats; they have gray fabric inserts that look like sweatpants (but aren’t as soft) and distinctive yellow-and-black-check accents. Views over the hood and over your shoulder are good, but rear visibility is severely limited.\n\nYou feel the low roofline even more when you’re in the two-person backseat, where the black headliner and small side windows contribute to the claustrophobia. It’s unfortunate because backseat comfort for adults is otherwise acceptable, with decent legroom and seat comfort.\n\nThough the Veloster has its share of budget-oriented interior trim like hard plastic on the dashboard and doors, the design and available colors keep the interior from looking cheap. The one aspect of the cabin that looks a little low-grade is the shiny plastic on the upper portion of the doors, but all the other hard plastic trim has an upscale, low-gloss finish.\n\nThe exterior’s asymmetric styling is reflected in the cabin — especially in the Ultimate trim, which gets a contrasting-color theme: The driver’s side is finished in dark-gray trim while the passenger side has light-gray plastic.\n\nBoth Velosters we tested had the optional 8-inch touchscreen multimedia system (a 7-inch touchscreen is standard). Hyundai’s touchscreen interface is very easy to use, with intuitive menus and quick screen response; it’s right up there with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles’ Uconnect system. Built-in navigation is optional for the 8-inch screen, but all Velosters have standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity to easily bring your smartphone’s navigation capability to the dashboard screen.\n\nIs It Versatile?\n\nIn Hyundai’s quest to give the Veloster a unique, sporty look, it sacrificed a lot of the utility hatchbacks normally offer. The low roofline and small liftgate result in a small opening to the 19.9-cubic-foot cargo area, and you must first clear a high rear lip when loading luggage. The standard 60/40-split backseat folds flat, but there’s a small ledge between the cargo floor and folded seat.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nThe Veloster is a fun-to-drive small car that doesn’t look like everything else on the block, and it also has a lot of technology features — even in its base form. But if you’re looking for traditional hatchback utility, look elsewhere; the Veloster lives like a coupe.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in August 2014 about the 2014 Hyundai Veloster. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2015, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nEven a nifty multimedia system and a Lady Gaga-sized helping of uniqueness can’t distract from the fact that the 2014 Hyundai Veloster is slipping behind its competition.\n\nStrange does not equal strong, as Hyundai’s three-door hatchback experiment proves. The automaker introduced the front-wheel-drive Veloster in late 2011 as a 2012 model whose sole engine was a pipsqueak of a four-cylinder. A turbo four-cylinder became available for 2013, and changes to the 2014 lineup include a standard backup camera, plus handling enhancements for turbo models. New R-Spec (turbo) and RE:FLEX (non-turbo) editions join the existing Veloster and Veloster Turbo; the RE:FLEX replaces last year’s limited-run RE:MIX edition. Click here to stack them up or here to compare the 2014 and 2013 Veloster.\n\nCars.com tested a well-equipped Veloster Turbo alongside seven other affordable performers in our Cheap Speed Challenge, which you can read about here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nHyundai’s familiar “Fluidic Sculpture” styling has its strangest canvas yet in the Veloster, a three-door hatchback with a backdoor only on the curb side. It takes some getting used to, both outside and in, with a B-pillar to one side but not the other (it’s farther back). There’s no oddness about the Veloster’s center crossbar that splits the rear window and obscures some of the view behind you, as the same is found on the Toyota Prius and other cars; still, it’s straight-up annoying here, too.\n\nSeventeen-inch alloy wheels are standard; 18s are optional. The Veloster Turbo, which is slightly longer and wider than its normally aspirated sibling, gets a reworked nose that visually connects the upper and lower grilles into a hexagonal shape. R-Spec models have red accents on the lower bumpers and side sills.\n\nThe RE:FLEX, meanwhile, adds some chrome accents, a unique wheel finish and exclusive Ice Pearl paint among its color options. Hyundai will limit production to just 3,000 units, so if you want a RE:FLEX, get shopping — but try to leave the caps lock off when you email your dealer.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe Veloster’s 138-horsepower, 1.6-liter four-cylinder base engine has modest overall power, but the car’s EPA gas mileage (28/36/31 mpg city/highway/combined with an automatic) makes up for it. The Veloster Turbo is immediately quicker. Its turbocharged 1.6-liter engine makes 201 hp and 195 pounds-feet of torque, which is good for smooth-revving, punchy thrills as the tachometer’s needle ascends.\n\nEditors liked our tester’s six-speed manual, whose smooth throws, light clutch and well-defined gates made it easy to pop from one gear to the next. Our car had a B&M Sport Shifter — standard on the R-Spec, $325 on our test car — that has slightly shorter throws than the standard gearshift. Our only complaint is accelerator lag, which introduces too much guesswork for expert rev matching.\n\nStill, given the state of go-fast compacts, the Veloster Turbo falls behind. On our test track, the car needed 7.9 seconds to hit 60 mph. That beat the Fiat 500 Abarth’s 8.8 seconds but fell short of five other competitors; it was a full second or more behind the 2015 Volkswagen GTI and 2015 Subaru WRX. Similarly, the 500 Abarth and Veloster Turbo were the only two cars that needed more than 16 seconds to go a quarter-mile.\n\nAlas, sloppy handling is also standard. Body roll is limited in the Veloster, but numb steering and a preponderance of nose-heavy understeer limit the fun. That understeer comes despite new Torque Vectoring Control for 2014, which slightly brakes the inside wheel in corners to mitigate said understeer. Hyundai says the Turbo has retuned steering versus the regular Veloster, but that’s little consolation given the car’s overall numbness — a recurring problem for the automaker.\n\nCars from the VW GTI to Ford’s Fiesta and Focus prove that not all front-drivers need to handle like they have a piano strapped to the grille. Hyundai needs to shed the Steinway and beef up the brakes while it’s at it. All Velosters employ four-wheel disc brakes, but even with the Turbo’s beefier front discs (11.8 inches versus the standard 11-inchers), stopping performance was disappointing. Our tester needed 135 feet to come to a stop, putting it in last place in our Challenge group, where one car needed as little as 114 feet.\n\nEditors gave our Veloster Turbo middling scores for ride quality. It’s better than the brittle Fiesta ST or Fiat’s 500 Abarth, but it’s less composed than the GTI and its refined ride. The Hyundai employs a torsion-beam rear suspension, which is theoretically inferior to many competitors’ independent rear setups. The Veloster R-Spec, meanwhile, has its own performance suspension and steering calibrations.\n\nInterior\nA more aggressive take on Hyundai’s usual layouts, the Veloster’s dashboard is a mix of steely grays and textured angles that converge on a standard 7-inch center display. Most textures avoid the high-gloss shine that makes the cabins in a lot of sub-$20,000 cars feel cheap, and the doors mix hardscrabble stretches with unexpectedly generous padding. Still, low-budget silver plastic covers the door handles, and a pull handle on the driver’s door of our test car flexed and creaked as much as a retirement-home walker. Want better materials? Most sporty compacts have Hyundai beat. Check out the Honda Civic coupe, Volkswagen Golf/GTI or Subaru Impreza/WRX for the best examples.\n\nThe front seats have impressive adjustment range and decent space thanks to a low center console. The two-seat rear bench has a low center floor hump, which makes it easy for passengers to scoot in from the Veloster’s sole rear door to the spot behind the driver. (It’s a pain to load anyone from the longer, single door on the driver’s side, as the driver’s seat lacks a slide-forward feature.) Legroom in back is decent, but headroom is not — made worse by the fact that adults’ heads will be knocking against the hatchback’s rear window glass, not the headliner.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe Veloster’s stereo comes standard with USB/iPod connectivity, Bluetooth phone/audio streaming and Pandora internet radio integration when used with a compatible smartphone. Standard RCA inputs also allow you to connect a gaming console to play when the car is parked. A navigation system and 115-volt household outlet are optional, but HD radio is not offered.\n\nOur test car had navigation, whose sharp graphics and extensive customization impressed us. You can even choose from among three welcome chimes — ranging from synthesized 1980s newscast Muzak to synthesized 1980s PSA Muzak — or turn off the intro entirely. Still, the system may be too complicated for its own good: The touch-screen teems with tiny buttons, and functions like map zooming hide in unnecessary submenus. What’s more, the Veloster has yet to add swipe-to-scroll or pinch-to-zoom map functionality, something the industry (see the Honda Civic, for example) has increasingly adopted from smartphones.\n\nOne plus: Turbo and RE:FLEX models have Dimension premium audio, which is optional on the base Veloster. It’s impressive — especially in a class not known for audio quality.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe 60/40-split folding rear seats expand cargo volume from 15.5 cubic feet to a maximum 34.7 cubic feet, but both figures are on the low end among smallish hatchbacks. Hyundai makes up for some of that with a lot of functional storage up front, including an overhead sunglass holder (less common in this segment) and generous space in the center console and a bin ahead of the gearshift.\n\nSafety\nThe Veloster earned the top score, good, in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s front, roof-strength and head-restraint tests. But it earned an acceptable score in side-impact tests and only marginal in IIHS’ small-overlap frontal test. (IIHS scores are good, acceptable, marginal and poor.) In a class where the Civic, Impreza, Golf and others have better ratings across the board, the Veloster’s performance is cause for concern, and not just for the safety-minded. Standard features include six airbags, plus the required antilock brakes and electronic stability system. Advanced safety technologies, like frontal collision warning and blind spot detection, are unavailable. Click here for a full list of safety features and here to see our evaluation of child-safety-seat installation in the 2012 Veloster Car Seat Check.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe Veloster’s generous multimedia setup, a standard backup camera and 17-inch alloy wheels make the $18,610 (including destination) base model a decent deal. It’s a few hundred less than a two-door Honda Civic and nearly $1,400 below the Scion tC, two other popular sporty coupes. On the other end, an optioned-out Veloster Turbo with heated leather seats, automatic climate control, navigation and a panoramic moonroof runs around $28,000 — thousands less than the ceiling for the GTI, Focus and several others.\n\nThe value formula has worked so far for the Veloster, which outsold the tC through the first six months of 2014. But the car’s weaknesses, as well as poor crash-test ratings and a poor reliability showing in its first two years on the market, make it a doubtful choice. In Cars.com’s eight-car Cheap Speed Challenge, the Veloster placed sixth. Enough said. Unless you’re shopping on budget alone, there are better choices elsewhere.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "The second-generation Hyundai Veloster retains the kind of quirky design cues that helped set its predecessor apart, things like three conventional doors — one on the driver’s side and two on the passenger side — and a raked roofline. With this redesign, however, Hyundai has brought that offbeat sense of style into the cabin.\nThe 2019 Veloster starts at $19,385, including an $885 destination charge. We tested two versions of the car: a top-of-the-line Ultimate trim level and an R-Spec trim priced at $29,160 and $23,785, respectively. Both trims had the optional 201-horsepower, turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine instead of the standard 147-hp, 2.0-liter four-cylinder. The Ultimate had an optional seven-speed dual-clutch transmission, while the R-Spec had a six-speed manual with a B&M Racing shifter.\nIs It Fun to Drive?\nThe modern-day Mini Cooper has been a standard-bearer for driving fun, and the 2019 Veloster imitates many of its characteristics — if not to such an extreme. Like the turbocharged engine of the Cooper S, the Veloster’s turbo four-cylinder is strong enough to give it some zip in the city as well as passing power on the highway. Ride quality is another similarity with the Mini: The Veloster’s firm suspension keeps body motions in check, but it doesn’t result in a harsh ride. (Compared with base-engine Velosters, turbo-engine versions get thicker front and rear stabilizer bars.) The Veloster’s steering, meanwhile, isn’t as heavy as the Mini’s, but it does feel natural with appropriate weighting and is one of the most dramatic improvements over the previous Veloster.\n\n  \n    I was worried the dual-clutch transmission might be a little balky, as they can be, but instead I was impressed with its overall refinement; it has the smoothness of a conventional automatic and makes quick upshifts. It hesitated on kickdown one time on the highway, and it would have been better if its manual-mode gear changes were a little quicker in the car’s Normal setting, but the transmission worked well overall.\nThe Veloster has three driving modes — Normal, Sport and Smart — and the differences between Normal and Sport are marked. Selecting Sport makes the gas pedal more responsive, eliminating much of the lag present in Normal. It also gives the steering wheel greater heft (though it doesn’t improve steering feedback), lets the engine rev higher before upshifts occur and makes manual-mode shifts quicker. The Sport mode’s main drawback is that the driving experience is jerkier in everyday driving.\n\n  \n    The R-Spec’s six-speed manual is the best Hyundai stick shift I’ve driven, and it isn’t far behind the exceptional stick shifts in the Fiat 124 Spider and Honda Civic Type R. The B&M stick is canted forward slightly; as a result, I ended up in 4th gear a few times thinking I was in Neutral, but the shifter’s throws are short and have a satisfying mechanical feel. The clutch pedal isn’t too heavy or springy. It’s forgiving, too.\nIs the Cabin Comfortable and Refined?\nEven with the standard height-adjustable driver’s seat raised, the Veloster still has a low driving position. You feel the car’s low roofline, too, but there’s enough legroom for taller drivers to settle in.\nThe Ultimate’s leather-trimmed bucket seats are comfortable, with side bolsters that aren’t overly restrictive. I also like the R-Spec’s unique cloth-covered seats; they have gray fabric inserts that look like sweatpants (but aren’t as soft) and distinctive yellow-and-black-check accents. Views over the hood and over your shoulder are good, but rear visibility is severely limited.\n\n  \n    You feel the low roofline even more when you’re in the two-person backseat, where the black headliner and small side windows contribute to the claustrophobia. It’s unfortunate because backseat comfort for adults is otherwise acceptable, with decent legroom and seat comfort.\nThough the Veloster has its share of budget-oriented interior trim like hard plastic on the dashboard and doors, the design and available colors keep the interior from looking cheap. The one aspect of the cabin that looks a little low-grade is the shiny plastic on the upper portion of the doors, but all the other hard plastic trim has an upscale, low-gloss finish.\nThe exterior’s asymmetric styling is reflected in the cabin — especially in the Ultimate trim, which gets a contrasting-color theme: The driver’s side is finished in dark-gray trim while the passenger side has light-gray plastic.\nBoth Velosters we tested had the optional 8-inch touchscreen multimedia system (a 7-inch touchscreen is standard). Hyundai’s touchscreen interface is very easy to use, with intuitive menus and quick screen response; it’s right up there with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles’ Uconnect system. Built-in navigation is optional for the 8-inch screen, but all Velosters have standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity to easily bring your smartphone’s navigation capability to the dashboard screen.\nIs It Versatile?\nIn Hyundai’s quest to give the Veloster a unique, sporty look, it sacrificed a lot of the utility hatchbacks normally offer. The low roofline and small liftgate result in a small opening to the 19.9-cubic-foot cargo area, and you must first clear a high rear lip when loading luggage. The standard 60/40-split backseat folds flat, but there’s a small ledge between the cargo floor and folded seat.\n\n  \n    Value in Its Class\nThe Veloster is a fun-to-drive small car that doesn’t look like everything else on the block, and it also has a lot of technology features — even in its base form. But if you’re looking for traditional hatchback utility, look elsewhere; the Veloster lives like a coupe.\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "We’ve already established that the 2019 Hyundai Veloster R-Spec is pretty much the most fun you can have in a car less than $24,000. At that price (and even at a few grand above, I’d suggest), it’s one of the most enjoyable drives there is, with excellent balance, steering and a real peach of an engine.\n\nRelated: Is the 2019 Hyundai Veloster the Most Fun You Can Have for $24,000?\n\nBut what if you have $30,000 to spend? At that price, Hyundai is happy to offer you the Veloster N, the higher-performance sibling to the Veloster R-Spec that comes with a bit more of everything — more engine, a more sophisticated suspension and more styling flair. The question is: Does that translate to enough added smiles to offset the price difference?\n\nWhat the N Adds\n\nThe Veloster N has a more aggressive wing and a unique front fascia with venting designed to help cool the front brakes, but its changes are much more than skin-deep. It adds a comprehensive set of performance upgrades over the R-Spec, starting with its engine: Under the hood, the Veloster N gets a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that cranks out 250 horsepower and 260 pounds-feet of torque (versus the R-Spec’s 201 hp and 195 pounds-feet). That horsepower figure jumps up to 275 with the available Performance Package. Like the R-Spec, the N is only offered with a short-throw six-speed manual transmission, but the N’s adds downshift rev-matching.\n\nUnderneath the N is an adaptive suspension and an optional electronically controlled limited-slip differential that is also part of the Performance Package. The N also features a more aggressive N driving mode not found on the R-Spec in addition to an N Custom mode that allows the driver to customize the settings for the suspension, steering, engine, rev-matching, differential, stability control and exhaust.\n\nThe Veloster N starts at $27,785, but my test vehicle also came with the Performance Package and that adds $2,100 to the price tag, bringing it to $29,885 (all prices include an $885 destination charge). Beyond the upgraded engine power and differential, the Performance Package also adds larger brakes, 19-inch wheels and a variable exhaust system that adds cracks and burbles to the soundtrack.\n\nThe N Is Really Good\n\nThe N is, much like the R-Spec, an absolute joy to toss around. In normal modes, it comes off as pretty docile; the exhaust is muted and the suspension loosens up nicely to remain comfortable enough in day-to-day driving. But when you click the N button on the steering wheel, the entire car jumps to life. The engine and steering tighten up, the exhaust note loudens and deepens, and the suspension gets very taut.\n\nPower from the engine flows quickly and easily. The Veloster N pulls very hard out of turns, especially for a front-wheel-drive vehicle. The limited-slip differential does a good job up front of allowing the wheels to do double duty, and the rear end of the car gets held in place by the adaptive suspension. The manual transmission, much like the one in the R-Spec, is a joy to operate. It has the right amount of mechanical notchiness so it’s easy to feel where the gates to each gear are, and the throws are short. The rev matching also works quickly and doesn’t get in the way as you rip through the gears.\n\nHyundai also nailed the steering and balance feel on the N; it feels alive underneath you in a way that other cars that also feature adaptive suspensions do not. Those can feel detached from the road, but the N makes you feel more in concert with the car as it pushes faster and faster.\n\nIf I could make one change on the N, it might be the tires. The 19-inch wheels that come as a part of the Performance Package are wrapped in Pirelli P Zero summer tires, but the 18-inch wheels come with Michelin Pilot Super Sports and the R-Spec gets its own set of Michelin Pilot Sport 4 summer tires. On the N, the tires chirped constantly and felt to me like a limiting factor; I had no such problems in the R-Spec (I drove both on similar roads in dry, warm conditions).\n\nIs It Worth It?\n2019 Hyundai Veloster N | Cars.com photos by Brian Wong\n\nTaken on its own, the answer is a resounding yes — the Veloster N is a smile-inducing machine. I loved driving it, and it is significantly cheaper than the rest of its hot-hatch competition like the Honda Civic Type R and Volkswagen Golf R. But the question gets complicated when you factor in the R-Spec, in large part because that car punches so far above its price class. I’d argue that the R-Spec is more of a performance bargain at its $24,000 price tag than the Veloster N is at nearly $30,000.\n\nFurther complicating matters is that I didn’t note that much difference between how the two vehicles accelerated. The N has a big horsepower advantage and is measurably the faster of the two cars, but it doesn’t translate to a different experience on the street. I found the R-Spec’s engine to be just as responsive and feel nearly as quick. This could be a byproduct of the weight difference between the two: The R-Spec is more svelte at 2,833 to 2,921 pounds compared with the N’s 3,036 to 3,106 pounds.\n\nThat’s why I think the R-Spec nudges the N by a nose when it comes to smiles per dollar. The N has a higher performance ceiling, but it’s not one that’s easily touched on the street, and the R-Spec feels like 90 percent of what the N is at 75 percent of the price. Again, though: There is no wrong answer here. Both are exemplary and make it apparent that the road to hot-hatch glory now runs through Hyundai’s garage. At both price points, the Veloster (whether it be the R-Spec or the N) is the one I’d choose among the respective competitors.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nAll versions of Hyundai’s sporty hatchback get minor updates for 2016, and a new Rally Edition also joins the lineup this year.\n\nThe 2016 Veloster wears a revised hood, new wheels and a tweaked grille; newly available on Turbo models is a performance-oriented dual-clutch seven-speed automated manual transmission.\n\nExteriorMinor exterior styling tweaks on regular Veloster models include a new 17-inch wheel design, a revised hood appearance without vent accents and a dark gray grille surround. Turbo models get new 18-inch machined-finish alloy wheels. The new Rally Edition trim gets fake carbon-fiber body accents, specific badges and Matte Blue Paint; it rides on 18-inch aluminum-alloy wheels with performance all-season tires.\n\nInteriorRegular models also see minor changes inside: available black bolster seats with yellow inserts and enhanced functionality from the 7-inch touch-screen system, including HD radio capability, Siri Eyes Free app integration and the next generation of Hyundai’s Blue Link telematics system. For Turbo models, the updates are also minor and include available orange-accented seat bolsters and interior trim, and a sportier looking electroluminescent gauge cluster; red seat belts and interior trim are new inside the R-Spec model. The Rally Edition uses a B&M Racing sport shifter and wears Rally Edition floormats and badging along with black leather with blue-accented sport seats.\n\nUnder the HoodThe Veloster’s powertrains carry over for 2016. Regular models still use the 1.6-liter direct-injected four-cylinder engine; it makes 138 horsepower with the six-speed manual transmission and 132 hp with the six-speed dual-clutch automatic.\n\nThe Veloster Turbo is again powered by a turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine that makes 201 hp and 195 pounds-feet of torque. New for this engine is an optional seven-speed dual-clutch automated manual transmission with paddle shifters; the six-speed manual transmission is again standard. Spec-R models again use the turbocharged 1.6-liter with the six-speed manual and short-throw shifter.\n\nThe new Rally Edition builds off of the already-sporty R-Spec model in terms of powertrain; Hyundai says it has sportier spring, damper and stabilizer bar tuning compared with that model.",

      "expert_review": "The Hyundai Veloster is a small car with a huge personality. As part of a small family with just one child and a flair for the unconventional, the Veloster seemed like it would suit us perfectly.\n\nWith the 2013 Hyundai Veloster’s unique three-door configuration and convenient hatchback, I was convinced that this car could be both drool-worthy and family friendly, but it failed on the family front.\n\nMy test car, the Veloster Turbo, is more than desirable with its eye-popping design, good fuel economy and a killer drive experience. To say I enjoyed my week with it would be an understatement; it was quick, nimble and garnered an obscene amount of attention wherever I took it. It’s a loud, rough ride, but it handled well, and with my test car’s turbo four-cylinder engine, acceleration was never an issue. Not one other mom rolled in to the playground parking lot with a Veloster, and that was my favorite part of all.\n\nThe good news is that even though the Veloster didn’t fit my family, it can work for others (Cars.com’s Senior Family Editor Kristin Varela found the Veloster to be a great fit for her and her school-aged daughters). If you’ve got kids who’ve outgrown their convertible child-safety seats or you’re looking for a second family car, you just might be able to keep the Veloster on your short list.\n\nWith a modest starting price of $18,395, including a $795 destination charge, the Veloster is affordable. However, with an upgraded turbocharged engine, panoramic moonroof, backup camera and navigation, my top-trim test car cost $27,520.\n\nEXTERIOR\nDespite the Veloster’s aggressive styling, it’s not overly masculine, yet there’s nothing cutesy about the tiny compact. While it’s youthful, it won’t cause your friends to raise an eyebrow and accuse you of entering a midlife crisis if you drive one. I loved everything about this little car’s looks, and with my test car’s Marathon Blue paint color, I felt like a superhero every time I ran errands.\n\nIt’s a hassle getting a small child into a two-door car, but I was convinced the Veloster’s third door, which is on the passenger side, would eliminate all those issues. Unfortunately, the third door wasn’t much help. Here’s the thing about the Veloster and kids, they can mix but not if the kids are in bulky child-safety seats.\n\nThe Veloster sits low to the ground, and the passenger-side door openings are small. Once my daughter’s forward-facing convertible seat was installed, it blocked almost the entire rear door opening. This made it difficult to get her loaded into the seat. To avoid knocking her unconscious on the low, sloping roofline, I had to get into a deep squat position (great for my thighs and glutes, yes — but challenging all the same) and squeeze her in as close to the front seatback as possible. Once her head was clear, I could lift her up and position her into the car seat. Then it was me that was almost knocked unconscious by the low roofline every time I stood up after getting her in.\n\nIf your kids aren’t in child-safety seats, they’ll love that third door. The door handle is low enough to be reached by older kids despite it being placed high on the door near the window.\n\nThe cargo area is deep but narrow. Grocery bags and luggage can be accommodated, but my single stroller only fit once I removed a wheel. I ran into trouble one day when I headed to the grocery store without remembering to leave the stroller at home first. I had just four bags, but the cargo area was occupied. I couldn’t load the groceries into the backseat using the third door because my daughter’s safety seat blocked most of the opening, so I had to use the driver’s side door and pull the seat forward. I squeezed the bags through the small opening, but I ran into that banging-my-head-on-the-roof problem again when I reached in to unload them.\n\nA base Veloster has a 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine that makes 138 horsepower; it gets an EPA-estimated 28/37 mpg city/highway with the six-speed automatic transmission. However, my Veloster Turbo test car was significantly more superhero-worthy with its upgraded 201-hp, turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder. The added pep affects gas mileage slightly, with the Veloster Turbo getting 24/31 mpg with the automatic transmission. Both engines use regular unleaded gasoline.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Groove-On\n\nINTERIOR\nThe Veloster looks small from the outside, but it gets even smaller once you get in it. Some of that feeling is simply due to it being a compact car, but it’s also because of its uber-sportiness.\n\nAs the driver, I found the interior’s tightness exciting. I was supported by firm seats; I was close to all of the gauges and instruments, and I felt positioned for the ideal driving experience. In the front passenger seat, I just felt cramped and uncomfortable. Legroom in the Veloster was scarce, even for my vertically-challenged family. I did appreciate that the front seats had a hard plastic covering on the back, which protected them from my daughter’s constant kicking.\n\nAs small as things were inside, the styling details and features inside the car made a big impact. I loved the optional panoramic moonroof in my test car, as well as the blue ambient lighting. Even the door handles stood out as the coolest, best-designed door handles I’ve ever seen. I never tired of the Veloster’s interior’s looks.\n\nThe Veloster’s backseat holds two passengers. There is a center console with two cupholders and a small storage tray that divides the backseat. It’s close quarters back there, and once a safety seat is installed, the interior space seems to shrink significantly. Without safety seats, two children will have a blast, but the car’s belt line was high and frustrated my daughter on long trips as she couldn’t see out the window.\n\nWhat also made the Veloster seem small inside was its limited rear visibility due to the drastic styling. It pains me to admit that the Veloster falls into the form-over-function category, but I can’t deny that I couldn’t see well. I was grateful for my test car’s backup camera; it’s a must-have for those considering the Veloster.\n\nFor such a teeny car, the Veloster has plenty of storage. My smartphone, sunglasses, latte and snacks for my daughter always found a place inside. It comes with four cupholders, additional bottleholders in the doors, a large bin in the center stack for a smartphone, and center console storage.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample (for its class)\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): More than Fair, less than Ample\n\nSAFETY\nEven though child-safety seats can take up a lot of space inside the Veloster, they can be installed easily. The four-seater has two sets of lower Latch anchors that slightly peek out from the seat cushions, making them easy to access. Installation was hassle-free. Find out how the Veloster fared in Cars.com’s Car Seat Check.\n\nThe 2013 Veloster Turbo has standard front-wheel drive, four-wheel-disc antilock brakes with brake assist, an electronic stability system with traction control, and six airbags, including side curtains for both rows. A backup camera with rear parking sensors is available, as well as Hyundai’s Blue Link system, which can provide assistance in emergency situations as well deliver an impressive suite of parent-friendly teen-driver-monitoring options like geo-fencing and curfew alerts via text message.\n\nCurrently there is no crash-test information available for the 2013 Veloster from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.\n\nGet more safety information on the 2013 Hyundai Veloster.",

      "expert_review": "Even a nifty multimedia system and a Lady Gaga-sized helping of uniqueness can’t distract from the fact that the 2014 Hyundai Veloster is slipping behind its competition.\n\nStrange does not equal strong, as Hyundai’s three-door hatchback experiment proves. The automaker introduced the front-wheel-drive Veloster in late 2011 as a 2012 model whose sole engine was a pipsqueak of a four-cylinder. A turbo four-cylinder became available for 2013, and changes to the 2014 lineup include a standard backup camera, plus handling enhancements for turbo models. New R-Spec (turbo) and RE:FLEX (non-turbo) editions join the existing Veloster and Veloster Turbo; the RE:FLEX replaces last year’s limited-run RE:MIX edition. Click here to stack them up or here to compare the 2014 and 2013 Veloster.\n\nCars.com tested a well-equipped Veloster Turbo alongside seven other affordable performers in our Cheap Speed Challenge, which you can read about here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nHyundai’s familiar “Fluidic Sculpture” styling has its strangest canvas yet in the Veloster, a three-door hatchback with a backdoor only on the curb side. It takes some getting used to, both outside and in, with a B-pillar to one side but not the other (it’s farther back). There’s no oddness about the Veloster’s center crossbar that splits the rear window and obscures some of the view behind you, as the same is found on the Toyota Prius and other cars; still, it’s straight-up annoying here, too.\n\nSeventeen-inch alloy wheels are standard; 18s are optional. The Veloster Turbo, which is slightly longer and wider than its normally aspirated sibling, gets a reworked nose that visually connects the upper and lower grilles into a hexagonal shape. R-Spec models have red accents on the lower bumpers and side sills.\n\nThe RE:FLEX, meanwhile, adds some chrome accents, a unique wheel finish and exclusive Ice Pearl paint among its color options. Hyundai will limit production to just 3,000 units, so if you want a RE:FLEX, get shopping — but try to leave the caps lock off when you email your dealer.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe Veloster’s 138-horsepower, 1.6-liter four-cylinder base engine has modest overall power, but the car’s EPA gas mileage (28/36/31 mpg city/highway/combined with an automatic) makes up for it. The Veloster Turbo is immediately quicker. Its turbocharged 1.6-liter engine makes 201 hp and 195 pounds-feet of torque, which is good for smooth-revving, punchy thrills as the tachometer’s needle ascends.\n\nEditors liked our tester’s six-speed manual, whose smooth throws, light clutch and well-defined gates made it easy to pop from one gear to the next. Our car had a B&M Sport Shifter — standard on the R-Spec, $325 on our test car — that has slightly shorter throws than the standard gearshift. Our only complaint is accelerator lag, which introduces too much guesswork for expert rev matching.\n\nStill, given the state of go-fast compacts, the Veloster Turbo falls behind. On our test track, the car needed 7.9 seconds to hit 60 mph. That beat the Fiat 500 Abarth’s 8.8 seconds but fell short of five other competitors; it was a full second or more behind the 2015 Volkswagen GTI and 2015 Subaru WRX. Similarly, the 500 Abarth and Veloster Turbo were the only two cars that needed more than 16 seconds to go a quarter-mile.\n\nAlas, sloppy handling is also standard. Body roll is limited in the Veloster, but numb steering and a preponderance of nose-heavy understeer limit the fun. That understeer comes despite new Torque Vectoring Control for 2014, which slightly brakes the inside wheel in corners to mitigate said understeer. Hyundai says the Turbo has retuned steering versus the regular Veloster, but that’s little consolation given the car’s overall numbness — a recurring problem for the automaker.\n\nCars from the VW GTI to Ford’s Fiesta and Focus prove that not all front-drivers need to handle like they have a piano strapped to the grille. Hyundai needs to shed the Steinway and beef up the brakes while it’s at it. All Velosters employ four-wheel disc brakes, but even with the Turbo’s beefier front discs (11.8 inches versus the standard 11-inchers), stopping performance was disappointing. Our tester needed 135 feet to come to a stop, putting it in last place in our Challenge group, where one car needed as little as 114 feet.\n\nEditors gave our Veloster Turbo middling scores for ride quality. It’s better than the brittle Fiesta ST or Fiat’s 500 Abarth, but it’s less composed than the GTI and its refined ride. The Hyundai employs a torsion-beam rear suspension, which is theoretically inferior to many competitors’ independent rear setups. The Veloster R-Spec, meanwhile, has its own performance suspension and steering calibrations.\n\nInterior\nA more aggressive take on Hyundai’s usual layouts, the Veloster’s dashboard is a mix of steely grays and textured angles that converge on a standard 7-inch center display. Most textures avoid the high-gloss shine that makes the cabins in a lot of sub-$20,000 cars feel cheap, and the doors mix hardscrabble stretches with unexpectedly generous padding. Still, low-budget silver plastic covers the door handles, and a pull handle on the driver’s door of our test car flexed and creaked as much as a retirement-home walker. Want better materials? Most sporty compacts have Hyundai beat. Check out the Honda Civic coupe, Volkswagen Golf/GTI or Subaru Impreza/WRX for the best examples.\n\nThe front seats have impressive adjustment range and decent space thanks to a low center console. The two-seat rear bench has a low center floor hump, which makes it easy for passengers to scoot in from the Veloster’s sole rear door to the spot behind the driver. (It’s a pain to load anyone from the longer, single door on the driver’s side, as the driver’s seat lacks a slide-forward feature.) Legroom in back is decent, but headroom is not — made worse by the fact that adults’ heads will be knocking against the hatchback’s rear window glass, not the headliner.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe Veloster’s stereo comes standard with USB/iPod connectivity, Bluetooth phone/audio streaming and Pandora internet radio integration when used with a compatible smartphone. Standard RCA inputs also allow you to connect a gaming console to play when the car is parked. A navigation system and 115-volt household outlet are optional, but HD radio is not offered.\n\nOur test car had navigation, whose sharp graphics and extensive customization impressed us. You can even choose from among three welcome chimes — ranging from synthesized 1980s newscast Muzak to synthesized 1980s PSA Muzak — or turn off the intro entirely. Still, the system may be too complicated for its own good: The touch-screen teems with tiny buttons, and functions like map zooming hide in unnecessary submenus. What’s more, the Veloster has yet to add swipe-to-scroll or pinch-to-zoom map functionality, something the industry (see the Honda Civic, for example) has increasingly adopted from smartphones.\n\nOne plus: Turbo and RE:FLEX models have Dimension premium audio, which is optional on the base Veloster. It’s impressive — especially in a class not known for audio quality.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe 60/40-split folding rear seats expand cargo volume from 15.5 cubic feet to a maximum 34.7 cubic feet, but both figures are on the low end among smallish hatchbacks. Hyundai makes up for some of that with a lot of functional storage up front, including an overhead sunglass holder (less common in this segment) and generous space in the center console and a bin ahead of the gearshift.\n\nSafety\nThe Veloster earned the top score, good, in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s front, roof-strength and head-restraint tests. But it earned an acceptable score in side-impact tests and only marginal in IIHS’ small-overlap frontal test. (IIHS scores are good, acceptable, marginal and poor.) In a class where the Civic, Impreza, Golf and others have better ratings across the board, the Veloster’s performance is cause for concern, and not just for the safety-minded. Standard features include six airbags, plus the required antilock brakes and electronic stability system. Advanced safety technologies, like frontal collision warning and blind spot detection, are unavailable. Click here for a full list of safety features and here to see our evaluation of child-safety-seat installation in the 2012 Veloster Car Seat Check.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe Veloster’s generous multimedia setup, a standard backup camera and 17-inch alloy wheels make the $18,610 (including destination) base model a decent deal. It’s a few hundred less than a two-door Honda Civic and nearly $1,400 below the Scion tC, two other popular sporty coupes. On the other end, an optioned-out Veloster Turbo with heated leather seats, automatic climate control, navigation and a panoramic moonroof runs around $28,000 — thousands less than the ceiling for the GTI, Focus and several others.\n\nThe value formula has worked so far for the Veloster, which outsold the tC through the first six months of 2014. But the car’s weaknesses, as well as poor crash-test ratings and a poor reliability showing in its first two years on the market, make it a doubtful choice. In Cars.com’s eight-car Cheap Speed Challenge, the Veloster placed sixth. Enough said. Unless you’re shopping on budget alone, there are better choices elsewhere.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",
