      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in June 2015 about the 2015 Hyundai Santa Fe. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2016, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nMany of us are on a fruitless, unhealthy pursuit of perfection. As mother to three young daughters (ages 14, 12 and 10), I spend a lot of time advocating for progress rather than perfection — except when it comes to cars.\n\nI’ve spent 11 years on a quest for the quintessential family car, and while that perfect blend of family-friendly features still eludes me, the 2015 Hyundai Santa Fe comes darn close.\n\nNot to be confused with the smaller, five-seat Santa Fe Sport, the Santa Fe can have six or seven seats in three rows. This year, the Santa Fe has a couple of new features and updates, including my favorite: an available hands-free (and foot-free) smart liftgate that opens the cargo door when you stand near the rear bumper with the key fob on you. This feature is standard on the Limited trim I drove, but a pricey option on others. Also new this year are optional blind spot monitors with rear cross-path detection, as well as some steering and suspension modifications. Compare this year’s model with last year’s here.\n\nThe Santa Fe comes in front- and all-wheel-drive versions of a seven-seat GLS trim and a six-seat Limited. I drove a Limited all-wheel drive; you can see all four versions here.\n\nIf you’re in the market for a three-row SUV for your people- and stuff-hauling needs, you should take the time to research the Chevrolet Traverse and Toyota Highlander, as well. Check them out side by side here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nDuring my week in the Hyundai Santa Fe, dressed in a Circuit Silver paint job, I had trouble finding the car in the parking lot on numerous occasions. Clad in the bland, anonymous paint shade that seems to disguise nearly every SUV in my neck of the woods, the Santa Fe just doesn’t stand out. To Hyundai’s credit, though, the cars I was mistaking for it were much more upmarket, like the Acura MDX.\n\nWhile my husband appreciated the low-profile anonymity of driving a feature-laden car without brand pretense, if it were mine, I’d probably deck it out to suit my personality more (and help it stand out in the grocery store parking lot among all the other sporty, curvy “utes”).\n\nHow It Drives\nDriving the Santa Fe is quite a pleasure — not in a BMW i8 sort of way, but in a “totally functional, nothing irks you and it’s even kind of fun when you punch it” sort of way. A button on the steering wheel allows you to switch between Sport, Normal and Comfort steering modes, which varies the power assist. In previous generations, I found the differences between the modes to be more pronounced than they were in the 2015 version, but maybe I was just more distracted this time with tales of “who likes whom” by my daughters while driving (wow — a lot can change in two years!).\n\nThe Santa Fe is available with one engine, a 290-horsepower, 3.3-liter V-6. When equipped with all-wheel drive, it gets an EPA-estimated 18/24/20 mpg city/highway/combined (identical to the 2015 Highlander with a V-6 and all-wheel drive). The front-drive Santa Fe gets just 1 mpg more in highway and combined driving. The six-cylinder Chevrolet Traverse with all-wheel drive gets a slightly lower 16/23/19 mpg rating.\n\nWhile the Santa Fe and Traverse offer only six-cylinder engines, those concerned about fuel economy can opt for a four-cylinder in the front-wheel-drive Highlander and see their mileage bump up to 20/25/22 mpg. A Highlander Hybrid is also an option for the budget-less, improving fuel economy even further to 27/28/28 mpg.\n\nInterior\nThe interior of the Santa Fe is incredibly well thought out and can be thoroughly decked out in almost all the features you’d want for your family hauler. In every version, the front occupants’ rear ends are pampered with standard heated seats, and seat ventilation is optional on all trims for a total of six temperature settings. My test car also had a heated steering wheel, but thanks to a nice blast of warm spring air, I didn’t need it.\n\nMy only suggestion to Hyundai on how to make the Santa Fe a better fit for drivers of all sizes would be to make the telescoping steering wheel extend out just a bit farther or tilt a bit lower. I’m 5 feet 3 inches tall, and when my feet were in the right position for the pedals, my arms had to stretch just a bit too far to reach the top of the steering wheel with the proper elbow bend. The steering wheel is angled slightly, so reaching the bottom is no problem, but the top and sides were just awkward enough to cause a bit of arm fatigue when I was in the car for a long period.\n\nI was grateful for the blind spot monitors that came standard on my test car (they’re optional on the GLS), as there’s a pronounced blind spot over the driver’s left shoulder. Or at least there was for my small frame, as the top of the driver’s seatback obscured my view. I also felt the side mirrors were a bit large. It’s great for looking behind you, but slightly in the way of your front-side view, particularly when turning a corner. A taller driver, though, would probably see right over the top of them.\n\nThe second row of my test car had two captain’s chairs, which are standard on the Limited trim (a bench seat is standard on the GLS). Those chairs can also have optional heated seats, controlled via a button on the door, as well as manual sunshades. Each captain’s chair reclines a bit for comfort, as well as ease of installation of different types of child-safety seats. They also slide back and forth to allocate second- or third-row legroom where needed. Bottleholders and storage bins in the doors, plus standard seatback pockets, round out storage space for second-row passengers.\n\nThe third row impresses with its own standard air-temperature control, eliminating the need for passengers back there to bug the driver for more air when needed. However, the seat itself is a bit flat and firm, making it more comfortable for quick trips than for the cross-country endeavors of ambitious road-tripping families.\n\nIf child seats aren’t installed in the second row, the captain’s chairs can tilt and slide forward, leaving plenty of space to walk through to the third row. While the aisle between the two captain’s chairs is narrower than what you’d find in a minivan, it’s enough space for children to squeeze between for quick, easy access to the third row (handy if child-safety seats in the second row mean you can’t tilt those seats forward — or if, like my kids, yours just prefer the walk-through maneuver).\n\nHyundai, like Kia, has mastered the art of the massive, if optional, panoramic moonroof. This is nothing if not impressive in a large vehicle like the Santa Fe. It spans all the way from the front seats to the third row without any obstructions in between. While the sun is way too harsh in my high-altitude Rocky Mountain climate to keep it open on a sunny day, opening it up for a little extra dose of vitamin D on a slightly overcast day is a pleasure. It’s also a blast for the kids for a full-moon-gazing night drive and froyo run, complete with fuzzy pajamas.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nHyundai’s multimedia touch-screen is simple enough to work through without having to break open the owner’s manual. My favorite feature is the speed limit signs that magically display on the nav screen. How often do you find yourself driving around without having seen a speed limit sign in ages, wondering whether you’re driving over the limit or not? Not a problem in the Santa Fe; speed limits are entered as map data points in the navigation system so you don’t have to watch so fervently for elusive signs.\n\nThe climate controls are below the multimedia display and adjust intuitively via a knob for fan speed, and up and down buttons for the … you guessed it … temperature adjustments. If that doesn’t seem out of the ordinary, you haven’t been in many new vehicles recently.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe Santa Fe has 13.5 cubic feet of cargo space behind the third row. Release levers on either side of the cargo bay fold each half of the third row without muss or fuss, expanding the cargo volume to 40.9 cubic feet. Folding the second row as well creates a full 80 cubic feet of space — enough for me to haul tile, grout and IKEA cabinets for two bathrooms for our nearly completed basement-finishing project. This comes close to the Highlander’s 83.7 cubic feet of maximum cargo-hauling capability. However, if you plan on doing some serious DIY home improvements, the Traverse is a better bet, with its massive 116.3 cubic feet of maximum cargo space.\n\nIf you opt for the power liftgate, loading all these supplies into the Santa Fe is as simple as standing next to the rear bumper with your hands full for a few seconds with the key on you. It will open without you needing to do anything else. Brilliant!\n\nSafety\nThe 2015 Hyundai Santa Fe received the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s top marks of good (on a scale of poor, marginal, acceptable and good) in side, roof-strength, moderate-overlap front and head restraint/seat tests. Unfortunately, a marginal rating in the small-overlap front test prevents the Santa Fe from receiving a Top Safety Pick rating. The Santa Fe’s results match two other models in the institute’s midsize SUV class; two are rated good, one is acceptable and one is poor in the small overlap.\n\nMost cars in this class have six standard airbags, but the Santa Fe adds a seventh for the driver’s knees. While the Santa Fe doesn’t have forward collision warning or avoidance systems, rear cross-path detection is an option with the blind spot monitor (new for this year). Park assist sensors are also optional, and a backup camera is standard.\n\nFor families installing child-safety seats, the six-seat Santa Fe Limited’s second-row captain’s chairs make installation easy. Although the lower Latch anchors are not visible, sandwiched within the seat bight, your ability to adjust the seatback angle and slide the seats forward and back add to the flexibility and ease of installation. Kids in booster seats will appreciate the seat belt buckles, which are on stable-stalk bases that make buckling in easier for those with limited dexterity.

You can get a lot of features packed into the Santa Fe that make it feel quite upscale and luxurious, but without paying a luxury-car price. Blend that with the peace of mind that Hyundai’s impressive warranty offers and the Santa Fe really starts to look like a clear class winner. It will, however, be quite interesting to see what happens as the redesigned 2016 Kia Sorento hits the market with its upscale fit and finish.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Hyundai made its sport-utility vehicle stand out in a crowd. Some would say it’s because the rest of the vehicles in the gathering are shunning it, because of its “funky,” “goofy,” “hog-ugly” exterior, according to comments I’ve read on automotive bulletin boards. I for one like its looks, except in white, which is too stark, especially given the big red taillights.\n\nIn my view, it’s better for a small player like Hyundai to polarize the audience than to try to please everyone, which tends to lead to a bland sameness. Besides, the Korean manufacturer has the lure of a knockout price.\n\nSanta Fes come in three series, base, the fancier GLS and the loaded LX. At any level, you can opt for a front-wheel-drive or all-wheel-drive machine. On the base machine, you get a four-cylinder engine, while on the big brothers it’s a V-6.\n\nThe very cheapest one – a base FWD machine with four-banger and manual transmission – bears a recommended price of $17,694, freight included, and Edmunds.com says they’re even going for less than that. More on that later.\n\nIf you want a pokey station wagon that looks like an SUV, the low-end machine might be OK, but I doubt it. At 3,500 pounds in sparest form, it’s a heavy load for 149 hp and 156 foot-pounds of torque to boss around.\n\nI was given a more suitable, mid-range specimen to test – a GLS with automatic transmission, V-6, and all-wheel drive. Nearly $4,000 more than the entry-level vehicle, it was still a lot of machine for the money. Unfortunately, it, too, is a bit underqualified under the hood, even for a mostly-on-road machine.\n\nThe V-6 displaces a mere 2.7 liters. Output ratings are 181 hp (at a sports-car-like 6,000 rpm) and 177 foot-pounds, at a still pretty lofty 4,000 rpm. As a consequence of that state of tune, launch feel is very torpid, and indeed, busting 11 seconds in the 0-60 drill proved elusive.\n\nWhen I was buzzing around the countryside, I used the spurs a bit on the old nag, keeping the tach above 5,000, and got more reasonable response (I don’t have to worry about longevity.) Such shenanigans are a bit out of character for an SUV, but it handled well enough that I wanted to push it a bit.\n\nThe Santa Fe has 225/70/16 tires, which provide a pretty good contact patch. Steering was fairly light, as well as fairly slow, and didn’t give a great deal of feedback, but I soon learned the mount’s limits and drove with considerable assurance. All series share the same tires, mounted on alloy wheels, which is a surprise.\n\nThe transmission was a four-speed, with ratios fairly widely placed. (Top is a 0.73 overdrive reduction ratio). With an engine as peaky as this one, that results in falling off the torque curve with every shift, unless you’re jamming the throttle hard and running out to redline, OR using the shift-it-yourself option.\n\nHyundai calls this Shiftronic, and it closely resembles the ubiquitous Tiptronic developed by Porsche. Shove the console-m ounted shift lever to the right from the Drive position, and you can upshift by tipping the lever forward, downshift by yanking it back. Hyundai’s was up there with the best of them, and provided a degree of control a hard-charging driver will appreciate.\n\nThe EPA ratings on this version of Santa Fe are 19 mpg city, 23 highway. Thanks to my predilection for staying atop the power curve, I logged 18.1 in mostly country driving. Faithful to Hyundai’s sharp-pricing mission, it’s content with 87-octane gas.\n\nWith the big engine and automatic, plus the AWD gear, Santa Fe weighs in at 3,752 pounds – two tons with me on board. This, plus frictional losses in the drivetrain, explain the thirst, which still isn’t too bad in the SUV ranks.\n\nThe Santa Fe is derived from the same platform as the midsize Sonata sedan, and its ride is very carlike. That is, it’s smooth over good surfaces and feels as if it’s running out of compliance when the going gets rough.\n\nIt’s quiet at speed, even when the engine is working hard. On the freeway, wind and a bit of tire noise do not raise the noise threshold beyond what I call moderate.\n\nThe all-wheel-drive setup on the Santa Fe is interesting. It uses a tricky double differential inside the transaxle housing to apportion power left and right as well as front-to-rear.\n\nUnder steady-state conditions, it gives the front wheels 60 percent of the available torque, which exactly matches the proportion of vehicle weight on the front wheels. The net effect is a machine that feels highly maneuverable and easy to master.\n\nPower is transmitted to the rear via two different paths, a helical gear or a viscous coupling. The helical gear does the work most of the time, but when the road gets slippery, the viscous coupling is called into action. (The vehicle knows the road is slippery when the wheel sensors detect one or two going faster than the others.)\n\nThe viscous coupling can cause as much as 100 percent of the power to be sent fore or aft.\n\nNo driver intervention is needed or even possible. Trying the AWD down at the gravel pit, I found it very efficient and fast-acting on loose sand, the best simulation of snow I could manage in 90-degree temps.\n\nIt’s quite the marvel of engineering, especially for this part of the market. Hyundai attempts to allay fears of its solidity by offering a 10-year, 100,000-mile powertrain warranty. I’d hate to be the poor devil who eventually has to work on it.\n\nThere is no low range, which hardly matters in day-to-day usage, but could be a factor if you’re following a trail that turns very nasty.\n\nThe Federals have not yet released crash data on the Santa Fe (they say they plan to), but the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) has. IIHS is pretty stingy with its nomenclature. The Santa Fe got their best, which they call Good, when it was smashed into a movable frontal barrier at 40 mph. It trailed the best-in-class Honda CR-V and Subaru Forester by a narrow margin, losing points for the merely “acceptable” ratings it earned in head/neck and right leg/foot protection. Like many others in its class, the SF got a rating of Poor for its bumpers. IIHS has a protocol which involves four 5-mph collisions with fixed barriers, similar to kissing a pole in a garage. On the four combined, the Santa Fe suffered $5,616 worth of damage, for an average of $1,404 per kiss. The best-in-class Subaru Forester suffered an average damage of $355, which would still be an incentive to use the rearview mirrors.\n\nConsumer Reports predicts slightly-below-average reliability, based on comments from its readers.\n\nThe brakes are now discs, front and rear, on all series. They provided a good pedal feel. Antilock is available as an option on base and GLS series, standard on LX. Lacking it, the tester was nonetheless easy to manage in simulated panic stops from 70 mph.\n\nThe air conditioner was surprisi ngly potent, considering it has a 130-cubic-foot interior to chill.\n\nWith the rear seats up, there’s 29 cubic feet for cargo – about two trunks’ worth. With the seats lowered, that figure zooms to 78.\n\nHyundai says this machine can tow up to 2,200 pounds of trailer, if it’s equipped with brakes, 1,200 without.\n\nThe stereo – an AM-FM-CD-cassette unit – offered good tonality, plenty of power and reasonable FM reception, considering it’s fed by an in-glass antenna.\n\nSuggested retail price of the tester, with freight and $80 worth of floor mats, was $21,674. Payments on the vehicle tested would be $439, if you paid list. (Payment is based on 20 percent down, 10 percent interest and 48 installments). Edmunds.com reports they’re currently going for about a grand under sticker. Must be the styling – it’s a compelling choice, I think.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nHyundai’s compact sport utility vehicle received several refinements for the 2005 model year. Styling changes included a fresh grille and taillights, refined bodyside cladding, a redesigned tailgate handle and restyled 16-inch alloy wheels. A new instrument cluster went inside, and the LX model gained a power driver’s seat.\n\nBased on the company’s front-wheel-drive Sonata sedan’s platform, the Santa Fe again is offered in GLS trim. A new Limited trim level has replaced the LX for 2006. The Limited includes leather seating surfaces, heated front seats, a power driver’s seat, automatic temperature control, an in-dash six-CD changer and a trip computer. An electrochromatic auto-dimming mirror with HomeLink universal transceiver has been added to the GLS 3.5 V6 model.\n\nAlthough the Santa Fe is roughly the same size as the Honda CR-V, Hyundai’s SUV is wider. Front- and all-wheel-drive versions are available. The all-wheel-drive system provides extra traction on slippery surfaces rather than serious offroad capabilities.\n\nExterior\nDesign revisions for 2006 include a new all-black monochromatic color scheme, available for the Limited model. Built on a 103.1-inch wheelbase, the Santa Fe is 177.2 inches long overall and 66 inches tall. Bulging front fenders are one of the Santa Fe’s distinguishing characteristics. The four-door SUV is equipped with a rear liftgate, and five-spoke alloy wheels hold 16-inch tires. A full-size spare tire is included.\n\nInterior\nEach Santa Fe holds up to five people, with front bucket seats and a 60/40-split three-place rear bench that folds for additional cargo space. Cargo volume behind the rear seat is 30.5 cubic feet, but capacity grows to 77.7 cubic feet when the backseat is folded down.\n\nBoth models have a Monsoon six-speaker cassette/CD audio system, but the Limited adds a six-CD changer. Leather seating surfaces and automatic climate control are also included in the top-of-the-line Limited.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Santa Fe can be equipped with one of two V-6 engines. The GLS comes with a 2.7-liter V-6 that produces an estimated 170 horsepower and teams with a four-speed-automatic transmission. The 3.5-liter V-6, which is standard in the Limited and optional in the GLS, generates 200 hp and 219 pounds-feet of torque and drives a five-speed automatic. Both transmissions have Shiftronic manual-shifting capability.\n\nSafety\nSide-impact airbags and antilock brakes are standard in all Santa Fe models.\n\nDriving Impressions\nRanking as one of the easiest small SUVs to drive, the Santa Fe handles adeptly and performs admirably. Its bulging fenders, which are uncommon on SUVs, actually make a difference in judging the vehicle’s position. This SUV is appropriately spacious, and it runs quietly. You can also expect an appealing ride.\n\nThough it is clearly stronger, the 3.5-liter V-6 doesn’t boost performance quite as much as expected, and its automatic transmission may occasionally shift with a jerk. When driving through curves, the 3.5-liter Santa Fe can exhibit a slightly top-heavy sensation.",

      "expert_review": "Many of us are on a fruitless, unhealthy pursuit of perfection. As mother to three young daughters (ages 14, 12 and 10), I spend a lot of time advocating for progress rather than perfection — except when it comes to cars.\n\nI’ve spent 11 years on a quest for the quintessential family car, and while that perfect blend of family-friendly features still eludes me, the 2015 Hyundai Santa Fe comes darn close.\n\nNot to be confused with the smaller, five-seat Santa Fe Sport, the Santa Fe can have six or seven seats in three rows. This year, the Santa Fe has a couple of new features and updates, including my favorite: an available hands-free (and foot-free) smart liftgate that opens the cargo door when you stand near the rear bumper with the key fob on you. This feature is standard on the Limited trim I drove, but a pricey option on others. Also new this year are optional blind spot monitors with rear cross-path detection, as well as some steering and suspension modifications. Compare this year’s model with last year’s here.\n\nThe Santa Fe comes in front- and all-wheel-drive versions of a seven-seat GLS trim and a six-seat Limited. I drove a Limited all-wheel drive; you can see all four versions here.\n\nIf you’re in the market for a three-row SUV for your people- and stuff-hauling needs, you should take the time to research the Chevrolet Traverse and Toyota Highlander, as well. Check them out side by side here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nDuring my week in the Hyundai Santa Fe, dressed in a Circuit Silver paint job, I had trouble finding the car in the parking lot on numerous occasions. Clad in the bland, anonymous paint shade that seems to disguise nearly every SUV in my neck of the woods, the Santa Fe just doesn’t stand out. To Hyundai’s credit, though, the cars I was mistaking for it were much more upmarket, like the Acura MDX.\n\nWhile my husband appreciated the low-profile anonymity of driving a feature-laden car without brand pretense, if it were mine, I’d probably deck it out to suit my personality more (and help it stand out in the grocery store parking lot among all the other sporty, curvy “utes”).\n\nHow It Drives\nDriving the Santa Fe is quite a pleasure — not in a BMW i8 sort of way, but in a “totally functional, nothing irks you and it’s even kind of fun when you punch it” sort of way. A button on the steering wheel allows you to switch between Sport, Normal and Comfort steering modes, which varies the power assist. In previous generations, I found the differences between the modes to be more pronounced than they were in the 2015 version, but maybe I was just more distracted this time with tales of “who likes whom” by my daughters while driving (wow — a lot can change in two years!).\n\nThe Santa Fe is available with one engine, a 290-horsepower, 3.3-liter V-6. When equipped with all-wheel drive, it gets an EPA-estimated 18/24/20 mpg city/highway/combined (identical to the 2015 Highlander with a V-6 and all-wheel drive). The front-drive Santa Fe gets just 1 mpg more in highway and combined driving. The six-cylinder Chevrolet Traverse with all-wheel drive gets a slightly lower 16/23/19 mpg rating.\n\nWhile the Santa Fe and Traverse offer only six-cylinder engines, those concerned about fuel economy can opt for a four-cylinder in the front-wheel-drive Highlander and see their mileage bump up to 20/25/22 mpg. A Highlander Hybrid is also an option for the budget-less, improving fuel economy even further to 27/28/28 mpg.\n\nInterior\nThe interior of the Santa Fe is incredibly well thought out and can be thoroughly decked out in almost all the features you’d want for your family hauler. In every version, the front occupants’ rear ends are pampered with standard heated seats, and seat ventilation is optional on all trims for a total of six temperature settings. My test car also had a heated steering wheel, but thanks to a nice blast of warm spring air, I didn’t need it.\n\nMy only suggestion to Hyundai on how to make the Santa Fe a better fit for drivers of all sizes would be to make the telescoping steering wheel extend out just a bit farther or tilt a bit lower. I’m 5 feet 3 inches tall, and when my feet were in the right position for the pedals, my arms had to stretch just a bit too far to reach the top of the steering wheel with the proper elbow bend. The steering wheel is angled slightly, so reaching the bottom is no problem, but the top and sides were just awkward enough to cause a bit of arm fatigue when I was in the car for a long period.\n\nI was grateful for the blind spot monitors that came standard on my test car (they’re optional on the GLS), as there’s a pronounced blind spot over the driver’s left shoulder. Or at least there was for my small frame, as the top of the driver’s seatback obscured my view. I also felt the side mirrors were a bit large. It’s great for looking behind you, but slightly in the way of your front-side view, particularly when turning a corner. A taller driver, though, would probably see right over the top of them.\n\nThe second row of my test car had two captain’s chairs, which are standard on the Limited trim (a bench seat is standard on the GLS). Those chairs can also have optional heated seats, controlled via a button on the door, as well as manual sunshades. Each captain’s chair reclines a bit for comfort, as well as ease of installation of different types of child-safety seats. They also slide back and forth to allocate second- or third-row legroom where needed. Bottleholders and storage bins in the doors, plus standard seatback pockets, round out storage space for second-row passengers.\n\nThe third row impresses with its own standard air-temperature control, eliminating the need for passengers back there to bug the driver for more air when needed. However, the seat itself is a bit flat and firm, making it more comfortable for quick trips than for the cross-country endeavors of ambitious road-tripping families.\n\nIf child seats aren’t installed in the second row, the captain’s chairs can tilt and slide forward, leaving plenty of space to walk through to the third row. While the aisle between the two captain’s chairs is narrower than what you’d find in a minivan, it’s enough space for children to squeeze between for quick, easy access to the third row (handy if child-safety seats in the second row mean you can’t tilt those seats forward — or if, like my kids, yours just prefer the walk-through maneuver).\n\nHyundai, like Kia, has mastered the art of the massive, if optional, panoramic moonroof. This is nothing if not impressive in a large vehicle like the Santa Fe. It spans all the way from the front seats to the third row without any obstructions in between. While the sun is way too harsh in my high-altitude Rocky Mountain climate to keep it open on a sunny day, opening it up for a little extra dose of vitamin D on a slightly overcast day is a pleasure. It’s also a blast for the kids for a full-moon-gazing night drive and froyo run, complete with fuzzy pajamas.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nHyundai’s multimedia touch-screen is simple enough to work through without having to break open the owner’s manual. My favorite feature is the speed limit signs that magically display on the nav screen. How often do you find yourself driving around without having seen a speed limit sign in ages, wondering whether you’re driving over the limit or not? Not a problem in the Santa Fe; speed limits are entered as map data points in the navigation system so you don’t have to watch so fervently for elusive signs.\n\nThe climate controls are below the multimedia display and adjust intuitively via a knob for fan speed, and up and down buttons for the … you guessed it … temperature adjustments. If that doesn’t seem out of the ordinary, you haven’t been in many new vehicles recently.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe Santa Fe has 13.5 cubic feet of cargo space behind the third row. Release levers on either side of the cargo bay fold each half of the third row without muss or fuss, expanding the cargo volume to 40.9 cubic feet. Folding the second row as well creates a full 80 cubic feet of space — enough for me to haul tile, grout and IKEA cabinets for two bathrooms for our nearly completed basement-finishing project. This comes close to the Highlander’s 83.7 cubic feet of maximum cargo-hauling capability. However, if you plan on doing some serious DIY home improvements, the Traverse is a better bet, with its massive 116.3 cubic feet of maximum cargo space.\n\nIf you opt for the power liftgate, loading all these supplies into the Santa Fe is as simple as standing next to the rear bumper with your hands full for a few seconds with the key on you. It will open without you needing to do anything else. Brilliant!\n\nSafety\nThe 2015 Hyundai Santa Fe received the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s top marks of good (on a scale of poor, marginal, acceptable and good) in side, roof-strength, moderate-overlap front and head restraint/seat tests. Unfortunately, a marginal rating in the small-overlap front test prevents the Santa Fe from receiving a Top Safety Pick rating. The Santa Fe’s results match two other models in the institute’s midsize SUV class; two are rated good, one is acceptable and one is poor in the small overlap.\n\nMost cars in this class have six standard airbags, but the Santa Fe adds a seventh for the driver’s knees. While the Santa Fe doesn’t have forward collision warning or avoidance systems, rear cross-path detection is an option with the blind spot monitor (new for this year). Park assist sensors are also optional, and a backup camera is standard.\n\nFor families installing child-safety seats, the six-seat Santa Fe Limited’s second-row captain’s chairs make installation easy. Although the lower Latch anchors are not visible, sandwiched within the seat bight, your ability to adjust the seatback angle and slide the seats forward and back add to the flexibility and ease of installation. Kids in booster seats will appreciate the seat belt buckles, which are on stable-stalk bases that make buckling in easier for those with limited dexterity.

You can get a lot of features packed into the Santa Fe that make it feel quite upscale and luxurious, but without paying a luxury-car price. Blend that with the peace of mind that Hyundai’s impressive warranty offers and the Santa Fe really starts to look like a clear class winner. It will, however, be quite interesting to see what happens as the redesigned 2016 Kia Sorento hits the market with its upscale fit and finish.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Maybe it means we’ve scraped the bottom of the sport utility vehicle barrel when a South Korean company takes a name like Santa Fe for its newest cute-ute.\n\nSanta where? Santa who?\n\nSince when does Southeast Asia have a say in something so blatantly Wild West and so obviously U.S.? Since Hyundai started building an SUV that can compete with anything on this shore. This is the new Santa Fe – hardly Hyundai, very American, quite interesting.\n\nWe told you a few months ago about Hyundai’s rebuilt reputation – the XG300 and the Sonata are two good examples – and the tradition continues with its first-ever SUV. Trashed are the tin cans that used to roll off the Hyundai assembly line. Gone are the days of the 10-year warranty needed to cover everything from the gear shift to the tire rims.\n\nIts respect-level restored, Hyundai feels it’s time to discover new territory and maybe do a little name dropping.\n\nNew for 2001, Hyundai’s SUV will bang bumpers with the best mini-utes around. Actually, we’ll call it a fine-ute – nicely equip-ped, well-mannered and not a drain on the wallet – a sort of SUV truce on wheels. Not too small, not too large and, maybe more importantly for Hyundai, finally able to compete with the Toytoa RAV4, Honda CRV and Chevy Tracker’s of the world. That’s a place Hyundai’s been longing for for awhile.\n\nFinancially sandwiched between a Lexus RX 300 and a Kia Sportage, the Santa Fe might be a little tardy to the SUV party, but rolls in as a better-than-basics approach to both sport and utility, with a whole world of simplicity. Climb aboard the Santa Fe and you get an uncomplicated interior, plenty of comfort not to mention decent ride and handling.\n\nDesigned for more on-road comfort than off-road exploits, it won’t blow you away at the stoplight or in the showroom. But that’s not its intention. Hyundai wants to be on the short list of mini-ute buyers – those wanting the car-like ride with the small-truck size – who were looking to upsize their small sedan or young buyers looking for a little Santa fun.\n\nHyundai’s quickly realized that not everyone who lives in the suburbs wants to party in the boonies. They just want to say they can – and then have the ability to stow the groceries on the way home from the store. In both ways it succeeds.\n\nFrom the outside, its styling is California cool – tall fenders, a sharp nose and a bulky, thick look that is so un-Hyundai. Inside, it’s no-fuss. Its wheelbase is five inches longer than a RAV4 and the same as a Ford Escape; it’s wider than the competition. And all that means more comfort and a whole lot of space – important ingredients in any small-family set of wheels. Maybe more to the heart of the matter, it’s priced better.\n\nLoaded up, our Sante Fe GLS tester with automatic transmission is a $20,249 ride. All of which drives directly into Hyundai’s motto: Cheap wheels, good looks, safe bet. Available in eight different trim levels – from the two-wheel-drive GL five-speed (starting at $16,499) to the AWD LX automatic ($21,999) – there is plenty to choose from but not much to complain about. Keeping with the economical theme, gas mileage is a respectable 23 mpg highway and 19 city – certainly not the stuff of tank SUVs.\n\nDespite its lower-than-average sticker, the Santa Fe delivers the essentials. Doors don’t close with a ting!, instrumentation is logical and well-placed and the chunky, easy-to-read buttons work the way they should. The overly plastic feel could be restyled but the list of standard features make for that good, all-important dollar-to-feature ratio. Air conditioning, power windows, 16inch alloy wheels, a roof rack and AM/FM stereo with an in-dash CD are all standard.\n\nOf course, some key elements are left out. The Santa Fe comes with disc front and rear brakes but, regrettably, without standard anti-lock brakes or traction control (both are options). Two quick Hyundai hints: Make them andard and beef up that V-6. If you’re going to use an American name, you need muscle.\n\nThe base power package is a 181-horsepower 2.4-liter in-line four cylinder. At 149 horsepower, we didn’t hold our breath waiting to be inspired. The V-6 was another story. Although it’s a leg up on the RAV4’s 2.0-liter, 148 horse fourcylinder, it was still less than enthusiastic off the light.\n\nHandling was better. Having driven some wretched Hyundais in the past, including an Excel that did anything but, the Santa Fe was surprisingly tight on turns. It’s all by design. Hyundai calls the Santa Fe an XUV, as in crossover-utility vehicle, meaning because it rides on a revised version of Hyundai’s Sonata sedan, it’s well-behaved like a sedan – no bouncing around or jarring edges – yet in the shape of something larger.\n\nThe four-wheel-drive models are designed to deliver 60 percent of the power through the front wheels and 40 to the rear. And it works. The Santa Fe is a digger that doesn’t mind being shoved around a corner once or twice. The turning radius is decent, meaning parking is easy and because of its width it’s stable at highway speeds.\n\nThere’s plenty of room for four adults and plenty of flexibility in a larger-than-life cargo area with foldflat split rear seats. Rear-seat leg room is abundant and the step-up height isn’t unreasonable – still OK for someone under 5-foot-8.\n\nThe warranty also can’t be ignored. As just another indication of good business sense, Hyundai continues to offer one of the best protection plans in the industry. The standard warranty is five years or 60,000 miles, bumper to bumper, and 10 years or 100,000 miles on the powertrain. Want a better guarantee?\n\nHyundai appears back for good. Yes, this is a first-time vehicle, so the obligatory caution should be issued here.\n\nBut, nonetheless, this appears to be a good XUV – with X marking the spot for many things finally right.\n\n2001 HYUNDAI SANTE FE GLS\n\nRating: 3.5\n\nHigh Gear: The first SUV from South Korea’s biggest automaker is high on the features-per-dollar list as well as a few other things, including: cargo room, ride, handling and an industry-leading warranty.\n\nLow Gear: The next-generation Santa Fe needs more American muscle in the V-6 and maybe updated interior detailing. Side air bags would also be a plus.\n\nVehicle type: Front- or all-wheel-drive, front engine, four-door, five-passenger sport utility vehicle.\n\nStandard equipment: Four-speed automatic with manual-shift capability; dual front air bags; air conditioning; power steering; tilt steering; eight-way manual adjustable driver’s seat; split-folding rear seat; power windows; AM/FM/CD player; full-size spare wheel; heated power mirrors; cruise control; power door locks; remote keyless entry; cargo cover; fog lights.\n\nCompetition: Chevy Tracker, Ford Escape, Honda CR-V, Kia Sportage, Subaru Forester\n\nEngine: 181 horsepower, 2 .7-liter DOHC 24-valve V-6\n\nTorque: 177 foot-pounds @ 4,000 rpm\n\nWheelbase: 103.1 inches\n\nLength: 177.2 inches\n\nMPG rating: 19 mpg city/23 mpg highway\n\nManufactured: South Korea\n\nWarranty: Basic warranty is five years/60,000 miles; the drivetrain is 10 years/100,000 miles; body corrosion is five years/100,000 miles and roadside assistance is five years/unlimited miles.\n\nBase price: $19,299\n\nPrice as tested (including options, destination and delivery): $20,249",

      "expert_review": "As a busy mother of two young daughters, I’m on a never-ending quest for the quintessential “mom-mobile.” I’m searching for that vehicle that will make my daily life of grocery shopping and preschool pickup just a little easier. I want to find a car that’s easy to load my kids into, has seats that hide baby vomit and doesn’t require me to spend my children’s college savings to buy it. Last, but not least, I want to feel youthful and modern while driving it. Oh yeah, if it would create international peace and end world hunger, that would be a bonus. Is that asking too much? Will the Hyundai Santa Fe meet all of my criteria?\n\nHyundai is known for producing budget-friendly (dare I say cheap) vehicles. The Santa Fe is no exception. The entry-level model starts at just $17,999. My test vehicle is just one step up from there and arrived with only the standard features. My first impression is that it’s a somewhat feminine, young-looking SUV sporting a curvaceous body.\n\nFirst on my agenda is to test how easily the rear seats fold. They’re very user-friendly and I’m able to operate them without referring to the owner’s manual. With the amount of room in the cargo area I doubt I’ll need to fold the seats again unless acting as a taxi pickup for my husband’s latest home-improvement project. I love the opening mechanism for the cargo door. It’s like squeezing the brake on a bicycle handlebar and is much easier to open than others I’ve used.\n\nUpon installing my girls’ car seats, I notice how much legroom there is in the back. A rear-facing infant seat fits perfectly without obstructing movement of the seat in front of it. The forward-facing car seat installs smoothly thanks to the adjustability of the rear seatback angle. It’s a good thing I only have two children, though, because there’s no way I could fit a third car seat back here. The center rear seat isn’t appropriate for larger children either since it’s only equipped with a lap belt. When not in use, the seat belt buckles actually buckle up into the seat. It’s great not having to fumble around with loose buckles while trying to install the car seat Latch connectors.\n\nSliding into the driver’s seat I’m excited by how well this SUV seems to conform to my 5-foot-2 stature. My 6-foot-2 husband, on the other hand, took it out for a drive and complained that there wasn’t enough headroom and the brake and gas pedals were too close together. The seat belt adjusts effortlessly with one hand but the sun visors are too small to be entirely functional. With the rear headrests removed (Hyundai recommends removing them when installing car seats), my view of the road is seamless. I have fewer blind spots in this SUV than in any of my other recent test vehicles.\n\nI’m impressed with how easy the Hyundai Santa Fe is to operate. The controls (including the thermostat adjusters and lock/unlock buttons) are large and clearly labeled. All you have to do is get in and drive. There’s not a lot in the way of luxury amenities, but no one ever claimed this was a luxury SUV.\n\nAfter a two-week test drive, the one thing that continues to baffle me is the Santa Fe’s Shiftronic transmission function. It enables me to switch out of automatic into manual mode, where I can make rapid gearshifts. Why anyone would want to do this I don’t know. It will, however, impress your teenage children, who might be tempted to use this vehicle in a drag race.

      "expert_review": "Sometimes a car is a complete surprise to me. Until I got the 2010 Hyundai Santa Fe to review, I’d never been in a Hyundai before. Sure, I’d seen them on the road and thought the new ones looked pretty cool, but that’s all I had going into this. After test-driving the Santa Fe for a week, I was pretty surprised by what Hyundai can pull off for less than $30K. The Santa Fe is a comfortable, practical crossover that offers enough tech options to rival the big automakers.\n\nDriving the Santa Fe is plenty of fun, especially for the price. My test car, a GLS with front-wheel drive, came with a plucky four-cylinder engine and available six-speed automatic transmission that handled everything without complaint, even the brutal hills around my home. Turns were smooth and stable. I honestly couldn’t find anything to complain about with this crossover. The ride is definitely truckish, with more bounce and body roll than a sedan, but it’s not obnoxious and doesn’t feel top-heavy.\n\nWhen it came down to it, the price was the most impressive thing about the Santa Fe. This vehicle starts at $21,695 and tops out just over $30,000. My test model was an affordable $23,915. When you put its price next to its competition, the Santa Fe is pretty amazing, especially when you consider all of its cool features such as Bluetooth connectivity and under-floor storage in the cargo area.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe Santa Fe isn’t the boldest or sleekest vehicle on the market, but it sits comfortably at the intersection of sporty and cute. In a lot of ways, the Santa Fe seems to take design cues from its competitors and meld them into its own look. It has touches of a Nissan Murano as well as Toyota styling cues, and from the side, it reminds me of a Volkswagen Touareg. It’s almost like the Santa Fe is trying so hard to be inoffensive and fit in with the cool kids that it never quite forms its own identity.\n\nThe Santa Fe is almost perfectly balanced between boxy and round. I honestly don’t know how they did it, but I have to admit the result is nice. Subtle sculpting along the hood and fenders create some edges without making it look too angular.\n\nThe best thing about crossovers is they offer all of the practical space of an SUV without the big climb to get into it, and the Santa Fe is no exception. For me, getting in and out was a straight shot ‘ I didn’t have to climb up into it. My kids had no difficulties with the door handles or the slight step up into the Santa Fe. The doors opened wide enough to allow me to help them out in the backseat when I had to, but not so wide that my boys were constantly slamming the doors into the cars next to us. (They tend to overdo things.)\n\nEven opening the liftgate was no problem; however, the liftgate’s handle is oddly placed off to the right of the license plate, as if the cargo door swings to the side rather than opening upward. The liftgate opened high enough for me to walk under it without fear of knocking my head, but not so high that I had to stretch to close it again.\n\nThe 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine did a nice job around town and managed to keep the mpgs under control. The Santa Fe gets an EPA-estimated 20/28 mpg city/highway and uses regular gas. I, of course, never hit those fuel-economy numbers, living on the side of a mountain, but compared to other vehicles I’ve driven, it’s still pretty competitive.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nINTERIOR\nThe Santa Fe’s interior offers more options and technology than I’d expect of a car at this price point. There was even a bit of faux wood trim to class up the joint! The sport-cloth seats were comfortable and easy to clean. I handled a minor spill with napkins and a baby wipe. Wipeable cloth? Winner!\n\nThe driver’s seat adjusted manually in six directions, and I had no problem finding my perfect driving position. The controls are laid out with large, easy-to-decipher buttons and knobs, and I never once had to go looking for the owner’s manual to figure something out such as how to change the radio station or pair my cell phone with the Bluetooth system. I love that.\n\nI also loved all the storage options in the Santa Fe. Everywhere I looked there was another bin, cubby or hidden compartment to stash my stuff in and make me look organized. In the front row, there are two cupholders near the gearshift, bottleholders in the doors, a bin in front of the shifter for cell phones and MP3 players, and a dual-level bin in the center console. There are two cupholders in the fold-down armrest in the backseat. There’s plenty of storage in the backseat, thanks to door bins, seatback pockets and a sneaky bin in the back of the center console, near the floor. I kept emergency snacks in there and was a hero because of it. Even the generous cargo area has under-floor storage for anything you don’t want rolling around or in plain sight.\n\nThere’s plenty of room for five in the 2010 Santa Fe, but the third-row seating for seven is no longer an option. I don’t need a third row, and rarely use it when I have one, but if you have a larger family or a big carpool, the Santa Fe isn’t going to be much help.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore\n\nSAFETY\nThe Santa Fe received the top score of Good in Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s front, side and rear crash tests. In past years, this would make the Santa Fe a Top Safety Pick, but a new roof-strength test was added to the criteria for the 2010 model year. The Santa Fe hasn’t undergone the new crash test yet.\n\nBuckling up is easy for almost everyone in the Santa Fe. The seat belts are height adjustable in the front row, but not in the back. The backseat’s fixed belts are set a bit high. They fit my 9-year-old just fine, but my 7-year-old had to ride in his booster seat because the fit wasn’t good without it (he wasn’t happy about this). The good news was that the booster sat flat and the seat belt buckle on his side was firm and easy to use. However, the backseat seat belt buckle on the passenger side was floppy and harder for kids to use. I have no idea why Hyundai has two different seat belt buckle in the backseat.\n\nAt least the Latch anchors are clearly visible and easy to reach. There’s enough room in the backseat for a rear-facing infant-safety seat or convertible car seat to fit easily. The rear seatbacks recline, which makes it easy to install a forward-facing convertible seat or booster seat.\n\nThe Santa Fe has standard four-wheel-disc antilock brakes, stability control, traction control and six airbags, including side-impact airbags for the front row and side curtains for both rows. All-wheel drive is optional.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2010 Santa Fe here.",

      "expert_review": "With gasoline now at a national average of $1.66 a gallon, fuel economy might not be at the top of everyone’s list of considerations in choosing a new vehicle, as it was in July when prices topped $4.\n\nBut most of us understand that today’s prices – at a five-year low – aren’t going to last, and that we do need to consider gas mileage when we’re shopping for our everyday vehicles.\n\nWhile some people might complain when I suggest that a vehicle such as the 2009 Hyundai Santa Fe crossover should be considered fuel efficient, with EPA ratings of up to 18 miles per gallon city and 24 highway, the fact is that this car does go a lot farther on a gallon of gas than the similar-sized, truck-based SUVs we were all buying during the past 15 years.\n\nAnd with seating for up to seven people, the Santa Fe can carry a family that would have to use two small, gas-sipping cars to go anywhere together, burning more gas together than this Hyundai does by itself.\n\nSo when you consider the gallons-per-passenger-mile used by the seven-passenger Santa Fe versus a small car that holds just five people (and not very comfortably, at that), the Hyundai makes sense.\n\nSuch efficiency has made crossover utility vehicles the family haulers of choice for many buyers these days, and the Santa Fe is among the best for value and fuel-efficiency.\n\nHyundai introduced the second generation of the Santa Fe two years ago, taking the opportunity at that time to make it a bit larger to accommodate the third row of seating. That pushed the vehicle into the midsize class from its previous compact size.\n\nWith the redesign, the Santa Fe now competes against the segment- leading Toyota Highlander and other popular midsize crossovers with three rows, including the Honda Pilot. As with those competitors, it qualifies as a crossover because of its unibody construction, which combines the body and frame into a single structure, giving the Santa Fe the ride and handling characteristics of a sedan rather than a truck.\n\nFor 2009, the Santa Fe returns mostly intact from last year, but there have been a few minor changes.\n\nAmong them are accommodations for those of us who can’t go anywhere without our iPods or other MP3 music players. The Santa Fe’s audio system now has USB and iPod/MP3 player auxiliary inputs, which allows for direct connection of either a flash drive containing MP3 music files, or an iPod or other MP3 player.\n\nOther changes include a power driver’s seat and universal garage opener for the optional SE Touring Package (which also adds the third seat, with climate-control outlets extended to those passengers), an available towing package on the SE and Limited models, and roof-rack cross rails standard on the SE and Limited, so luggage can be strapped on top when the third-row seat is in use, taking up most of the interior cargo space.\n\nIn the latest safety tests, the Santa Fe has earned the top five-star designation in front- and side-impact crashes from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, and has received the “Top Safety Pick” designation from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, which conducts its own crash tests at a laboratory near Charlottesville, Va.\n\nThe Santa Fe is 184.1 inches long, seven inches longer than its predecessor. It’s also an inch wider and almost two inches taller, and its track is 2.9 inches wider.\n\nPrices for the 2009 models have not been released yet, and dealers are still awaiting shipment of the new ones, but still have plenty of the ’08s in stock.\n\nFor this report, we were provided the 2008 model, and except for the very minor changes mentioned above, the ’08s are the same as the ’09s.\n\nThe 2008 Santa Fe starts at $21,495 (plus $750 freight) for the base GLS model with front-wheel drive and five-passenger seating. To get the third row, you have to move up to the midlevel SE model, which begins at $24,495.\n\nAt the top is the Limited, with a base price of $28,445 for the front-wheel drive model, or $30,145 for the all-wheel-drive, model, which we tested.\n\nWith options such as the navigation system ($1,750) and Touring Package ($3,150) with a rear-seat entertainment system, our Limited tester topped out at $35,795 including freight.\n\nBut it’s really not necessary to spend that much to have a nice Santa Fe – although with the base GLS model, you can’t get that third-row seat. Hyundai should offer the third seat in all trim levels.\n\nHyundai says its benchmark vehicles for the redesign of the Santa Fe were the Lexus RX and Acura MDX (the premium versions of the Highlander and Pilot), as well as the Volvo XC90.\n\nAmong standard safety features on the Santa Fe are electronic stability control, anti-whiplash active head restraints, and side-curtain air bags for all three rows of seats. Electronic stability control also is standard on all versions. This system is designed to help maintain vehicle stability in extreme maneuvers to help prevent rollovers.\n\nTwo V-6 engines are offered; the four-cylinder that was used in the previous generation is not available in this newest model. That’s a mistake, though, and I would expect Hyundai to bring back the four-cylinder, especially if gas prices shoot up again. Toyota made the same mistake when it redesigned the Highlander last year, but for 2009, has brought the four-cylinder back.\n\nSanta Fe’s base engine, standard on the GLS models, is a 2.7-liter engine is rated at 185 horsepower and 183 foot-pounds of torque. It’s the one rated at 18 city/24 highway, and it has enough power for most people’s everyday needs.\n\nUpgrading to the SE or Limited models brings a 3.3-liter V-6, which adds a lot of zip, without affecting fuel economy very much. EPA ratings are 17 city/24 highway. This engine cranks out 242 horsepower and 226 foot-pounds of torque, and can tow trailers weighing up to 3,500 pounds.\n\nThe 2.7-liter model comes with a standard five-speed manual transmission, while a four-speed automatic is an additional $1,300.\n\nA five-speed automatic is standard with the 3.3-liter engine. Both of the automatics come with the Shiftronic feature, which allows the driver to shift manually (without having to use a clutch).\n\nWhile two-wheel drive is standard, all three trim levels are available with the electronically controlled all-wheel-drive system. It automatically sends power to the wheels offering the best traction.\n\nAlso included with the all-wheel drive is a center differential lock that splits power 50-50 between the front and rear axles regardless of which wheels have the best traction. This can help move the vehicle better in some off-road situations. The Santa Fe isn’t capable of serious off-road driving, however, as the system does not have low-range gearing.\n\nThe Santa Fe’s exterior design has a more-aggressive look than the previous generation, with a new grille and headlights. The body is more aerodynamic, with a lower coefficient of drag, which helps with fuel economy.\n\nAlthough the vehicle is two inches shorter than the Lexus RX, there is more head, leg, and shoulder room in the first two rows. The RX doesn’t offer a third row of seating.\n\nSanta Fe’s third row has a 50/50 split, and can be folded flat to increase cargo space to 34.2 cubic feet; but with the third seat in place, that space is just 10 cubic feet. The middle seats, with a 60/40 split, can be folded, too, creating a cargo area of 78.2 cubic feet when the third row is folded.\n\nEven the GLS is well-equipped, except for the absence of the third seat, and has more standard equipment for thousands of dollars less than a Highlander. Standard are 16-inch alloy wheels, 112-watt AM/FM/CD/MP3 audio system with six speakers, rocker panel moldings, heated power side mirrors, power windows and door locks with remote, roof rack with sliding cross rails, tire-pressure monitoring system, air conditioning and a tilt and telescoping steering wheel.\n\nGLS options include the four-speed automatic transmission and a Premium Package ($2,100), which adds a power tilt/slide glass sunroof and heated front seats, among other extras.\n\nMoving up to the SE model brings the 3.3-liter engine and five-speed automatic transmission, 18-inch alloy wheels, auto-dimming rearview mirror with compass, front fog lights, and steering wheel audio controls.\n\nTo get the third seat and rear air conditioning, buyers must choose the SE Touring Package. The price is $1,500 for the 2008 model; that might rise when prices are released for the 2009 model, as this package will also bring the power driver’s seat and universal garage opener.\n\nThe SE Premium Package ($1,850) for 2008 includes the power driver’s seat with lumbar support, a power tilt/slide glass sunroof, heated front seats and the universal garage opener.\n\nLimited models come with everything found on the SE, plus leather seats, heated front seats, power driver’s seat with lumbar support, dual zone automatic climate control with outside temperature display, and the universal garage/gate opener, among other things.\n\nOther special features on the Limited include a chrome grille and exterior door handles, and a body-color rear spoiler. The power sunroof is standard, as is a 605-watt Infinity audio system with 10 speakers, 115-volt power outlet, and power front passenger seat.\n\nThe automotive columns of G.

      "expert_review": "Hyundai’s Santa Fe three-row SUV, mildly redesigned for 2017, boasts safety upgrades that compare to those of newer competitors, but it no longer has the same edge on the field as when it rolled out at the 2012 Los Angeles Auto Show or later won Cars.com’s 2014 Three-Row SUV Challenge.\n\nCompare the 2016 and 2017 Santa Fe here. Note that the Hyundai Santa Fe Sport is a separate, smaller model that seats five. Compare the two models here and see the Santa Fe Sport review here.\n\nThanks to upgrades for 2017, the Santa Fe competes evenly with the Honda Pilot and Toyota Highlander in terms of appeal to safety-conscious families. Compare the 2017 with these rivals here.\n\nFour trims are offered: SE, Limited, SE Ultimate and Limited Ultimate, with seven- or six-seat configurations depending on trim (the Ultimate versions get second-row captain’s chairs). We tested a top-level, front-wheel-drive Santa Fe Limited Ultimate ($43,160 as-equipped) in a head-to-head comparison with seven similarly priced rivals in the 2016 Cars.com Three-Row SUV Challenge, as well as over a couple of hundred additional miles in city and suburban traffic.\n\n$$IMAGE- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8$$\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nUp front, the 2017 Hyundai Santa Fe has a new bumper, a bigger Hyundai grille, revised headlight pods and Elantra-like vertical LED daytime running lights. New taillights (LED on Limited trims) and dual exhaust outlets now grace the back end, and new 17-, 18- and 19-inch wheels are available. The changes are subtle, but the overall effect makes the SUV more premium. The sloping roof and tapered rear side windows that carry over from last year continue to contribute to a pleasing, sporty look — and to sacrifice third-row headroom and rear visibility.\n\n$$IMAGE 7, 11, 12$$\n\nHow It Drives\n\nMost of all, the Santa Fe is easy to drive, carlike and comfortable, but it’s not unsettled when driven hard. No one buys a three-row SUV expecting a sports car, but, for this class, the Santa Fe offers confidence-inspiring handling with restrained body motion and lean. Braking is firm and linear, and steering offers reasonable — though not outstanding — feedback.\n\nThe sole powertrain is the previous version’s 290-horsepower, 3.3-liter V-6 and six-speed automatic transmission, with front- or all-wheel drive. The setup gives the SUV plenty of torque scoot around town and adequate highway power for passing and merging, but the V-6 needs to be wound up to really deliver. The capable six-speed is less busy in highway cruising than some competitors — notably the Honda Pilot, which has nine speeds to juggle — and is far more pleasant and responsive than the continuously variable automatic transmission in the Nissan Pathfinder.\n\nA new drive mode selector, with its button oddly located on the lower left of the dashboard, offers Normal, Sport and Eco modes that alter throttle and transmission response as well as steering feel. Eco imparted a lazy quality. Sport offered better steering, but its stronger throttle response made it harder to modulate the somewhat stiff accelerator pedal and drive smoothly at low speeds. Normal was, well, normal, likely the most pleasing compromise for most drivers and situations.\n\nRide quality is firm. It’s stable on uneven pavement and not unpleasant, but you feel the bumps. Smaller wheels, with their more compliant tire sidewalls, might offer more ride comfort (our test car had the 19-inchers). The tires may also have contributed to the higher level of highway road noise I heard in the Santa Fe than in several of its rivals when driven back-to-back.\n\nThe Hyundai Santa Fe’s fuel economy is comparable to its three-row V-6 rivals, which is to say it’s not their strength. The 2017 Santa Fe with front-wheel drive is EPA-rated 17/23/20 mpg city/highway/combined for Ultimate trims and 18/25/21 for lower trims. All-wheel drive drops combined ratings by 1 mpg.\n\nSeveral of the Hyundai’s competitors also offer a regular four-cylinder or turbocharged-four option for mileage-conscious buyers, and the Highlander also offers a hybrid. The 2017 Santa Fe with front-wheel drive is EPA-rated 17/23/20 mpg city/highway/combined for Ultimate trims or 18/25/21 for the lower trims. All-wheel drive drops combined ratings by 1 mpg.\n\n$$IMAGE- 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 28, 29$$\n\nInterior\n\nThe interior design is little changed and is beginning to look a little dated. The overall design is pleasing, with a nice mix of colors and textures in our upscale test vehicle, but there’s also a mix of material quality. Though the wood trim is faux, it nonetheless has a very nice matte finish and grain. Some of the metal-finish plastic, however, just looked fake, and the leather lacks the softer texture found in some rivals, particularly the redesigned Mazda CX-9.\n\nThe seats are firm. They suited my 6-foot-2 frame and taste, but some other Cars.com editors found the padding too thin and the backs uncomfortably stiff.\n\nFinding a just-so position in front was easy, however, thanks to a standard eight-way power driver’s seat with four-way power lumbar support. Families with multiple drivers will appreciate the available memory function for the seat and side mirrors. My decked-out Limited Ultimate’s front seats were ventilated as well as heated. The second row also had heaters, and the cherry on top was a heated steering wheel.\n\nThe Ultimate also features sliding and reclining captain’s chairs in the second row, while seven-seat models get a 40/20/40 second-row bench for three. The split-folding bench for two in the way back is best left to the kids, with its thin cushion and seating nearly on the floor. Even sitting so low, though, the sloping roof limits space for heads and the small side windows add to the cave-like feel. Legroom there is limited and requires negotiating with the folks in the second row. On the plus side, the third row has a child seat top tether anchor and offers occupants their own climate vents and controls, real cupholders and a USB port, plus 12-volt and 115-volt power outlets in the cargo area.\n\nThose features contrast with the more Spartan second row, which has only climate vents and just one 12-volt power port that’s awkwardly hidden beneath an ugly console bulge that houses two rear cupholders.\n\nThe second-row seats tilt and slide forward for third-row access, and while the step-in height is lower than that of many rivals, the foot opening is small; kids may find it easier to scramble through the narrow aisle in models with the second-row captain’s chairs.\n\nOverall visibility is limited by a high beltline, low roof and small rear windows, but our test car’s dramatic panoramic moonroof that extended to the third row alleviated any feeling of being closed in. It has a power shade, but I gave it little use except when parked in the sun. I even found the big glass canopy oddly satisfying in the rain.\n\nIn our Cars.com Car Seat Check, the Hyundai Santa Fe fit the car seats well, but the kid-unfriendly, floppy seat belt buckles in the second and third rows caused a downgrade in its booster seat score.\n\n$$IMAGE- 17, 18, 14, 24, 27$$\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nThe Hyundai Santa Fe has standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto for 2017. SE and Limited trims get a 7-inch touchscreen and six-speaker audio, while the SE Ultimate and Limited Ultimate get an 8-inch display with navigation and Infinity premium surround audio. The Infinity unit has crisp, clean sound, and its integrated Clari-Fi music restoration technology noticeably improved compressed music files playing from my phone.\n\nIf you like physical buttons and knobs, you won’t be disappointed with the Hyundai Santa Fe. It’s no slave to current all-touch fashion. While the layout is busy and could be simplified, you don’t have to wade through touchscreen menus or poke touch-sensitive controls to access common functions.\n\nA thoughtful addition is a very useful open device tray ahead of the shifter that includes a USB connection, a pair of 12-volt outlets and an aux jack.\n\nCargo & Storage\n\nThe Hyundai Santa Fe can seat six or seven, but they’ll need to travel light. With all seats in use, cargo space is a tight, vertical 13.5 cubic feet — far less than a Volkswagen Golf’s 22.8 cubic feet. The space is comparable to the Toyota Highlander but 3 cubic feet fewer than you’ll find behind the Honda Pilot’s third row. The 40.9 cubic feet of cargo space with the third row down and 80 cubic feet with the second row also folded are more competitive but still well less than the roomy Pilot offers. The split, folding third row and 40/20/40 bench or captain’s chairs in the second row offer cargo space and shape flexibility if all the seats aren’t needed.\n\nCargo access is eased by a hands-free power liftgate — optional on the base model and standard on other trims — that operates by simply pausing behind the SUV with the key fob in your pocket. It doesn’t force you, as do some rivals, to awkwardly balance on one foot and wave the other while balancing a load on each arm.\n\n$$IMAGE- 15, 16$$\n\nSafety\n\nHyundai made some structural and seat belt changes that erased a black mark on its crash-test scores, turning a marginal rating in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s small overlap front test into a top score of good for 2017, matching its scores of good in the institute’s other crashworthiness tests. Those scores, plus a top score of superior for its newly available front crash prevention system with automatic emergency braking, qualified the 2017 Santa Fe to be an IIHS Top Safety Pick Plus, matching the designations earned by the Pilot and Highlander. See the 2017 Hyundai Santa Fe’s IIHS report card here.\n\nTo get that level of safety tech, however, you must first opt for one of the top two trims, then spend $2,100 for a Tech Package that includes those safety features, plus adaptive cruise control with stop-start, lane departure warning and high-intensity-discharge adaptive headlights. Blind spot warning and rear cross-traffic alert are optional on the base model and standard on the rest.\n\nA backup camera is also standard, but the top two trims get a new 360-degree camera system that offers multiple views to the front, back and sides with great image clarity.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nHyundai remains a value brand, and the Santa Fe offers a ton of features for the price at each trim level. The loaded Ultimate Limited we drove had a rich stew of safety features, technology and luxury touches that could shame a fancier brand. Even going all-in on the top trim level, including all-wheel drive for $1,750, leaves a sticker that’s still about $850 shy of $45,000. And its warranty leaves rivals in the value dust: five years/60,000 miles of bumper-to-bumper coverage and 10 years/100,000 miles on the powertrain.\n\nLong-time competitors, however, have upped their game. For less than $45,000, you can also get, for example, a comparable Pilot Touring with a roomy interior and a minivan’s worth of family touches. The 2017 Pilot also offers a full suite of safety tech on all but the base trim. The 2017 Toyota Highlander one-ups that with similar advanced safety tech standard across the line. Both these rivals offer rear-seat entertainment systems; Hyundai does not. You can argue the worth of such costly systems if your kids are old enough to bring their own devices, but many families with young children will want it.\n\nThe Hyundai Santa Fe also has less-familiar competition nipping at its heels. From the back of the pack, Mazda’s redesigned 2016 CX-9 has vaulted ahead with sporty driving dynamics, high style and a top-trim interior that seems more like an Audi than a Hyundai. A trimmer, lighter 2017 GMC Acadia is now aimed at the heart of the mainstream three-row SUV market in size and competitive pricing.\n\nEven the Hyundai Santa Fe’s corporate three-row cousin, the Kia Sorento, was redesigned for 2016 and is now a stiffer rival, topping out with comparable luxury for the price and the same long warranty. It also undercuts the Hyundai at the lower rungs with a four-cylinder, base L model that starts at $26,295 (with destination), plus a next-level LX trim with a four-cylinder or V-6 that are both priced lower than the entry-level Santa Fe SE‘s $31,695 (with destination). Driving them back-to-back shows that Kia’s engineers have managed to refine the shared platform for a bit better noise and ride.\n\nThe Hyundai Santa Fe is a solid value in a satisfying, easy-to-drive package, but fresher competitors are challenging its edge as it awaits a more extensive update.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The midsize crossover utility segment is hot, and it’s populated by vehicles such as the Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4, Ford Escape, Mazda Tribute and Mercury Mariner.\n\nThe all-wheel-drive Hyundai Santa Fe Limited is a serious contender because it has a 3.3-liter V-6, a third seat, a long list of safety and convenience features, and a 10-year, 100,000-mile powertrain warranty. The top Limited gets a 605-watt Infinity audio system, a power sunroof and a navigation system.\n\nThe Santa Fe comes in three trim levels in front-wheel or all-wheel drive. Pricing for the GLS starts at $21,695, the SE at $24,695 and the Limited at $28,845.\n\nThe GLS comes with a 2.7-liter V-6 and a five-speed manual (the automatic is optional), while the SE and Limited have the larger 3.3-liter engine and a sportshift five-speed automatic. I drove an all-wheel-drive Limited from Hyundai’s press pool.\n\nThe test vehicle was as quiet, smooth and well finished as any of its competitors, and better than some more expensive vehicles. Whereas some Hyundais have a significant price advantage over their competitors, the Santa Fe is roughly equal to its competitors.\n\nThe 3.3-liter engine delivers 242 horsepower and 226 pound-feet of torque. Compared to the smaller 2.7-liter engine, the 3.3-liter accelerates faster and feels more confident in passing or climbing hills. It has a fuel-economy rating of 17 miles per gallon in the city and 24 on the highway.\n\nThe Santa Fe also has six standard airbags, including side air curtains for all three rows of available seating. Vehicle stability control is standard, as are anti-lock brakes and traction control. A tire-pressure monitoring system is standard as well, but as so often happens with these monitoring systems, the slightest drop in pressure, such as one would find on a cold morning, causes a low-pressure alert that goes away after driving a while.\n\nThe Santa Fe offers seven-passenger seating with the optional third seat. Hyundai said the Santa Fe is 2.1 inches longer than a Lexus RX350 and that the leg-room in the third seat is greater than that of the Acura MDX, Honda Pilot or Volvo XC90. Second-row and third-row passengers benefit from dual rear heating ducts, vents on the B-pillars and rear fan controls.\n\nA nice underfloor storage bin comes in models without the third seat.\n\nThe cabin of the Limited is most comfortable and surprisingly quiet. Wind and road noise are controlled well. Part of the reason for the lack of noise is a stiff unibody structure, but triple-sealed doors help, too.\n\nHyundai’s attention to detail is evident throughout the interior. The gauges have blue backlighting, and the front cup holders also have blue lighting at night. Soft-touch, low-gloss surfaces are used throughout the interior. Convenience features include an available power driver’s seat with power lumbar support, steering wheel audio controls, trip computer, heated side mirrors and a windshield wiper de-icing system.\n\nThe Limited has dual-zone climate controls for the driver and front seat passenger.\n\nPrice\n\nThe base price of the test car was $30,545. Options included the navigation system, Bluetooth hands-free phone connectivity and floor mats. The sticker price was $33,495.\n\nWarranty\n\nFive years or 60,000 miles with a 10-year, 100,000-mile powertrain warranty.\n\n2009 Hyundai Santa Fe Limited\n\nEngine: 3.3-liter, 242-hp V-6\n\nTransmission: Automatic\n\nAll-wheel drive\n\nWheelbase: 106.3 inches\n\nCurb weight: 4,121 pounds\n\nBase price: $30,545\n\nAs driven: $33,495\n\nMpg rating: 17 city, 24 hwy.\n\nTom Strongman’s e-mail address is tom@tomstrongman.com.",

      "expert_review": "Key Points\n\nThe Hyundai Santa Fe gets additional standard safety equipment for the 2026 model year, as well as a new transmission for the gas-only powertrain.\nPriced from $36,400 (all prices include $1,600 destination charge)\nAffordable hybrid upgrade available\n\nRolling into the third model year since its boxy reimagining, the Hyundai Santa Fe gets myriad minor upgrades for the 2026 model year — plus one big one that buyers are unlikely to notice. The latter is a new automatic transmission that replaces the dual-clutch automatic unit in gas-only models; it still has eight speeds. Likely a bigger draw for most customers, the upgraded forward collision warning tech that was previously only included on upper trim levels is now standard across the line. The 2026 Hyundai Santa Fe starts at $36,400.\nRelated: 2024 Hyundai Santa Fe Review: Don’t Knock It Till You Try It\nShoppers considering a more luxurious Santa Fe now get standard second-row captain’s chairs in the Limited (a bench is available for those who need as many seat belts as possible), and there’s a new Peach Brown Nappa leather option for the range-topping Calligraphy trim. The adventure-oriented Santa Fe XRT now gets Terrain Mode with Mud, Snow and Sand settings to optimize traction on various off-road surfaces, and the SEL and XRT now come with USB ports for the third row.\nRelease Date and Pricing\nThe 2026 Hyundai Santa Fe is on sale now. Full pricing is as follows:\nSanta Fe\n\nSE: $36,400\nSEL: $38,940\nXRT: $43,390\nLimited: $45,950\nCalligraphy: $48,950\n\nSanta Fe Hybrid\n\nSE: $37,750\nSEL: $40,040\nLimited: $47,050\nCalligraphy: $50,050\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n    Trim Levels\nOther than their powertrains, there are no differences in the gas-only and hybrid Santa Fes. The SE rides on 18-inch wheels and features keyless entry and start, LED exterior lighting, heated side mirrors and a hands-free power liftgate. Its seats are upholstered in fabric and manually adjustable up front, but the SE does have a standard 12.3-inch touchscreen with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.\nStandard safety technologies on every 2026 Santa Fe include forward collision warning with pedestrian and bicyclist detection, automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, lane departure steering assist, lane-centering steering, front and rear cross-traffic alert, front and rear parking sensors, a driver attention monitor and blind spot monitors.\nOne step up, the SEL adds synthetic leather upholstery, a power-adjustable driver’s seat, heated front seats, a wireless phone charger and Hyundai’s Digital Key 2, which allows the owner to use a paired smartphone or smartwatch as a key and to remotely monitor the vehicle.\nOnly available on the gas-only Santa Fe, the XRT is lifted 1.3 inches and rides on dark-gray 18-inch wheels with all-terrain tires. It also features a moonroof, black exterior trim, navigation and a second wireless charger.\nThe Limited adds 20-inch wheels, dual moonroofs and rain-sensing windshield wipers. Its cabin is upgraded with leather seating, a power-adjustable passenger seat, ventilated front seats, a heated steering wheel, heated second-row captain’s chairs, ambient lighting, rear window shades, a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster and a 12-speaker Bose audio system. The Limited also adds a 360-degree camera system, blind spot cameras, side parking sensors and automated parking.\nTopping the Santa Fe lineup, the Calligraphy boasts 21-inch wheels, upgraded exterior and interior trim, quilted Nappa leather upholstery, an upgraded driver’s seat, a head-up display and a digital rearview mirror that gives the driver a clear view aft even if their line of sight is obstructed by passengers or cargo. The Calligraphy also gets more standard safety equipment, including an upgraded forward collision warning system, blind spot intervention, and Highway Driving Assist 2, which combines the adaptive cruise control and lane-centering functions for hands-on semi-autonomous highway driving.\nRead More About the Hyundai Santa Fe:\n\nIs the 2024 Hyundai Santa Fe a Good SUV? 6 Pros, 2 Cons\nBest Car of 2025\nWhich Hybrid Vehicles Have All-Wheel Drive?\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2025 Hyundai Santa Fe?\nWhat Are the Best 2025 Hybrids for the Money?\n\nPowertrain Specs and MPG\nThe gas-only 2026 Santa Fe is powered by a 277-horsepower, turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine making 311 pounds-feet of torque; it’s mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission. Hybrids get a turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder that, with the help of an electric motor, generates a total of 231 hp and 271 pounds-feet of torque; the hybrid routes its power through a six-speed automatic. Front-wheel drive is standard with either powertrain on all trim levels; all-wheel drive is standard on the XRT and available for $1,800 for the rest of the lineup.\nThe gas-only Santa Fe returns an EPA-rated 20/29/24 mpg city/highway/combined with FWD and 20/28/23 mpg with AWD. With its taller ride height and all-terrain tires, the XRT is rated at 19/25/21 mpg. The hybrid powertrain returns 37/36/36 mpg with FWD and 35/34/34 mpg with AWD.\nRelated Video:\n\n  \n    \n\n  \n    Cars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Despite the recent public backlash against sport-utility vehicles, you can still buy one legally in California.\n\nAnd if you want to feel good about your purchase, you might want to look at a Hyundai Santa Fe — the no-guilt SUV. My test Santa Fe was the 2003 GLS, a $20,099 front-wheel driver only a small step above the base GL, which starts at $17,549. In a world chock-full of $30,000-and-up SUVs, the Santa Fe is a genuine bargain.\n\nThe tested GLS was not dressed up; the only option was an $85 rear cargo tray. What was included for the five-seater’s 20-grand and change was noteworthy:\n\nStandard features included steel-belted radial tires, a four-speed automatic gearbox that also enables the driver to do clutchless manual shifts, four-wheel disc brakes, a 218-watt Monsoon sound system (with AM/FM radio, cassette and compact disc player), a roof rack with rails, heated power mirrors and a first-aid kit.\n\nHad someone read me just that list for an SUV and asked me to peg the price, I would have guessed $25,000, minimum.\n\nSo the Santa Fe must have a cheap dog of an engine that enables Hyundai to make some money, right? Hardly.\n\nThe GLS was equipped with a 2.7-liter V-6, a compact power package that churns out a robust 173 horsepower at 6,000 revolutions per minute and 182 foot-pounds of torque at 4,000 rpm. Acceleration from a standing start was excellent. The GLS took on inclines with relatively little strain.\n\nSUV critics have been slamming them for their immense size and ability to crush compact passenger cars. The Santa Fe is not in that crowd.\n\nIt’s a manageable package of about 3,500 pounds and 177.2 inches in length. Though no garage-filler, it still has a good ground clearance of 7.4 inches — more than enough room for most off-road ventures. Cargo-carrying capability is a fairly roomy 77.7 cubic feet when the rear seat is down.\n\nStyling, done at Hyundai’s California Design Center in Fountain Valley, is pleasant — slightly sporty but with enough light-truck features to brand it a true SUV — as opposed to a “what-is-it crossover.”\n\nAnd that other anti-SUV gripe, horrible gas mileage, does not apply to the Santa Fe. The six-cylinder power plant is rated at 20 miles per gallon in city driving and 26 mpg on the open road — very midsize sedan-like.\n\nImpressed?\n\nWait, here’s the best part: exceptional warranty coverage. The standard warranty package is five years/60,000 miles on the vehicle, 10 years/100,000 miles on the powertrain, five years/100,000 miles on anti-perforation and five years/unlimited mileage for roadside assistance.\n\nGiven everything, the Santa Fe is arguably the best SUV value on the market.\n\nWhat’s not to like? Well, it’s not a Mercedes-Benz, nor does it handle like one. At the top of a steep Sierra Nevada incline, the 2.7-liter engine will lose some juice. And although the engine is plenty strong e nough to whip through traffic on twisty roads, you’re going to feel some body sway above 40 mph.\n\nGetting the complete off-road package is going to cost you more. A 2003 Santa Fe LX 4WD model starts at $24,999 — edging into that sticker territory inhabited by other makers of sport-utes.\n\nSo if you want to go that LX 4WD route, do so.\n\nBut if you are seeking a no-nonsense SUV that is nicely equipped, moderately priced, sensibly sized, adequately powered, politically correct, capable of handling most urban/rural duties and backed by a warranty that will probably pay for any trouble you encounter, the Santa Fe GLS should be added to your test-drive list.\n\nThere’s certainly no guilt in either testing or buying one.\n\nHyundai Santa Fe at a glance\n\nMake/model: 2003 Hyundai Santa Fe GLS.\n\nVehicle type: Five-seat, four-door, front-wheel-drive sport-utility vehicle.\n\nBase price: $20,099 (as tested, $20,184).\n\nEPA fuel economy: 20 miles per gallon city; 26 mpg highway.\n\nTransmission: Electronic four-speed automatic with clutchless manual-shifting feature.\n\nSteering: Power rack and pinion.\n\nBrakes: Power, vented discs on front; power, solid discs on rear.\n\nSuspension type: Independent with MacPherson struts on front; independent with trailing arms on rear (coil springs and gas-filled hydraulic shocks front and rear).\n\nMaximum cargo volume: 77.7 cubic feet.\n\nFuel tank: 17.2 gallons.\n\nBase curb weight: 3,549 pounds.\n\nFront track: 60.7 inches.\n\nRear track: 60.7 inches.\n\nHeight: 66 inches.\n\nLength: 177.2 inches.\n\nWheelbase: 103.1 inches.\n\nWidth: 72.7 inches.\n\nGround clearance: 7.4 inches.\n\nTires: Standard P225/70R16 steel-belted radials.\n\nMaximum towing capacity: 2,700 pounds (with specified trailoring equipment).\n\nPort of entry: Los Angeles.",

The regular gas-engine Santa Fe is powered by a 277-horsepower, turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine paired with an eight-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. The hybrid version has a turbo 1.6-liter four-cylinder teamed with a single electric motor and a six-speed automatic transmission; this powertrain makes 231 total hp. In either variant, front-wheel drive is standard and all-wheel drive is optional. The Santa Fe’s rivals are plentiful, including the Ford Explorer, Honda Passport and Pilot, Kia Sorento and Toyota Highlander. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Hyundai Santa Fe?\n\nAfter its radical re-imagining for 2024, the Santa Fe rolls into 2025 with no significant changes.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Hyundai Santa Fe Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n12.3-inch infotainment touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nCloth upholstery\nSecond-row bench seat\nFour USB ports\nProximity keyless entry\nHeated side mirrors\nHands-free power liftgate\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking with cyclist and pedestrian detection\nRear cross-traffic alert\nBlind spot warning\nLane departure steering assist\nAdaptive cruise control\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n12.3-inch digital gauge cluster\nWireless charging pad\nFaux leather upholstery\nLeather upholstery\nHeated steering wheel\nHeated front seats\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated second-row seats\nDual-zone climate control\nDigital Key smartphone app access\nDriver attention monitor\nRoof rails\nMoonroof\nVoice recognition\nHigher ride height (XRT model)\nAll-terrain tires (XRT model)\nShould I Buy the 2025 Hyundai Santa Fe?\n\nThe Santa Fe’s hyper-boxy exterior design certainly isn’t for everyone, but the upright body shape pays off in terms of maximizing occupant space and cargo room, and the SUV makes a compelling case for itself far beyond its Lego-like exterior. Even the entry-level trim comes respectably equipped, while the adventure-themed XRT improves towing capacity (4,500 pounds versus 3,500 pounds) and adds a bit of off-road capability thanks to its elevated ride height. The line-topping Calligraphy, meanwhile, is genuinely luxurious and loaded with features. And don’t overlook the Santa Fe Hybrid’s impressive 36 mpg combined EPA rating; it’s a significant improvement over the gas version’s 24 mpg rating. While it’s outstanding in many respects, though, the Santa Fe isn’t perfect: Acceleration is modest, partly because of its hefty 4,300-plus-pound curb weight, and its third row is tight compared with larger three-row SUVs like the Chevrolet Traverse, Toyota Grand Highlander, Volkswagen Atlas and Hyundai’s own Palisade.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2024 Santa Fe’s wild redesign not only makes the SUV stand out in a crowd, it also offers a compelling interior and cargo package sure to entice families of different sizes.\n\nVersus the competition: While some competitors are simply two-row versions of three-row models, the Santa Fe is a wholly unique model.\n\nThe redesigned 2024 Hyundai Santa Fe was certainly a head-scratcher when we first laid eyes on the blocky, over-the-top-styled SUV. It replaced a nondescript yet value-laden mid-size SUV in Hyundai’s lineup, slotting above the compact Tucson and below the three-row Palisade. It was almost as if the Santa Fe were a little kid acting out from lack of attention. After spending a day driving gasoline-only versions of the top-of-the-line Calligraphy and off-road-oriented XRT trims (the gasoline-electric Santa Fe Hybrid wasn’t available at the time of testing), I found this wildly different Santa Fe isn’t just having a hissy fit, and I appreciated the Santa Fe’s drastic departure and all the family-friendly goodness that comes with it. (Per Cars.com’s ethics policy, we pay for all travel and lodging at such manufacturer-sponsored events.)\n\nRelated: Up Close With the 2024 Hyundai Santa Fe: A Radical but Promising Departure\n\nHow Its Shape Affects Cargo and Passenger Room\n\nI say this with the utmost respect: The 2024 Santa Fe has been Ford Flexified. Sure, you may see some styling elements of the Land Rover Defender or Lexus GX in it, but the new Santa Fe’s relatively low ground clearance means it has the low-slung and blocky shape of the Flex, one of our favorite cars made in the past 20 years. The Santa Fe’s squared-off roofline is especially beneficial for space behind the second row both in terms of passenger room (for six or seven occupants) with the now-standard third row and additional cargo room.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nWeekend Home Depot warriors will surely appreciate an expansive cargo opening and low load-in height. The Santa Fe’s cargo opening has been widened by a staggering 5.7 inches, to 50.2 inches, and it’s 2 inches larger from top to bottom, at 32 inches. Hyundai says overall cargo space behind the second row has increased by 4.2 cubic feet to 40.5 cubic feet, but we’ll put the Santa Fe through our own cargo testing regime once we get one at Cars.com headquarters (though I have little doubt that our measurements of the Santa Fe’s cargo area will be any less impressive).\n\nIn practice, the cargo area is easy to use, and I could even crawl into the back with the third row folded and comfortably sit upright to take a quick snack break. While Hyundai would have you believe you could be looking at a picturesque mountainscape from this vantage point, I imagine a more common use could be backing up toward a kids’ soccer or baseball game, popping a squat in the rear cargo area and keeping tabs on the score or your wandering right fielder picking flowers during an at-bat. Either way, the cargo opening is large enough to give a good view out the cargo opening when seated back there.\n\nFor 2024, the Santa Fe comes standard with a third row, and it’s more than a third row in name only like a Tesla Model Y or the former Lexus RX 350L. The Santa Fe’s third row is usable for a 6-foot-tall adult such as myself thanks to the generous rear headroom afforded by the squared-off shape, though the low seating position significantly raised my knees. Perhaps more important, the third row has proper attachment points for child-safety seats with lower Latch connectors and top tether anchors in both seats, a pairing missing from the Lexus GX’s third row.\n\n2024 Hyundai Santa Fe | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nThe most annoying aspect of the Santa Fe’s newfound versatility is the power-folding second-row captain’s chairs on the top Calligraphy trim level, which have power-adjustment controls like the front seats. Unfortunately, it’s slow and cumbersome to fold the seats to maximize cargo space from the rear doors or to simply gain third-row access because the power seatback moves slowly. On all other trim levels, the split-folding bench seats recline manually, which is a much quicker and expected operation to achieve maximum cargo versatility and third-row access, though you do lose the power-folding controls in the cargo area.\n\nInterior Gadgets\n\nThe Santa Fe’s interior has similarly different styling and function to the exterior, working to similar effect with many features that maximize cabin storage space and versatility. One of my favorites is the center console storage, which has a removable insert for extra depth, as well as a dual-opening lid that’s openable from the front or back, allowing second-row passengers access.\n\n2024 Hyundai Santa Fe | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nA storage container pops out from the rear of the console, too, and can be used as a small trash can, which I’m excited about knowing all of the wrappers, little toys and miscellaneous junk that ends up on the floor of my family car when driving anywhere with the kids. There’s even more storage, too: The area under the center console is open for more cargo carrying because the gear selector is mounted on the steering-wheel column instead of the console, opening up space above and below the console. A device ledge on the front passenger side complements the other storage space well, making it easy to place items like a phone or key out of the way.\n\nSpeaking of devices, the Santa Fe’s standard 12.3-inch touchscreen includes wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, correcting a long-standing issue that omitted those features from Hyundai’s top-level screen. The Santa Fe’s screen and digital instrument panel combine in a slick uniform curve that looks like it belongs in a luxury car.\n\nThe Calligraphy trim also has a unique sanitizing compartment that uses ultraviolet light to clean 99.9% of germs on the outside of the object, according to Hyundai. While it’s difficult to verify this claim, it’s a thoughtful feature that came about when the car was designed during peak COVID-19 precautions — and even if you don’t need anything sanitized, the compartment adds another layer of storage inside the cabin.\n\n2024 Hyundai Santa Fe | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\nHow It Drives On- and Off-Road\n\nYou may be wondering why this “first drive” has driving impressions near the bottom; that’s because you won’t find a whole lot to talk about regarding how the new Santa Fe drives, which is more of a compliment than it seems. The standard turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine and eight-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission are competent without complaints, but it’s not a surprisingly quick and fun-to-drive car like the three-row Kia Sorento with a similar engine and transmission. Perhaps that’s because the Santa Fe’s 277 horsepower and 311 pounds-feet of torque are saddled with pulling a fairly heavy SUV; its base curb weight of 4,343 pounds with front-wheel drive is more than the base weight of a Palisade, nearly 700 pounds heavier than the outgoing Santa Fe and 549 pounds heavier than a Sorento. All-wheel-drive Santa Fes are even heavier.\n\n2024 Hyundai Santa Fe | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nThis extra weight, combined with a more powerful engine, is reflected in the Santa Fe’s fuel economy, which at 24 mpg with FWD and 23 mpg combined for with AWD (22 mpg for XRT) is only slightly better than the Palisade’s 22 mpg with FWD and 21 mpg with AWD and worse than the outgoing turbocharged Santa Fe’s 26 mpg with FWD and 24 mpg with AWD. A Santa Fe hybrid will be available in the spring with significantly improved fuel economy of 36 mpg with FWD and 34 mpg with AWD.\n\nTwo driving characteristics stood out: The Santa Fe drives like a much larger, beefier car; it’s more solid and weightier than you’d expect from a tweener SUV that’s not as long as a Palisade and not as short as a Tucson. A lot of that came from its squared-off hood, tall windshield and windows that give great visibility, but its heft might also have an impact here.\n\nThe biggest surprise was the Santa Fe’s ride quality because Hyundais with big wheels typically don’t ride that well; the Palisade has jitteriness with the larger wheel options, for example. That’s not the case in the Santa Fe; even with 21-inch wheels, the Calligraphy showed composure and smoothness on-road. Now, I qualify that by saying my time with the Santa Fe was on smooth Tennessee roads, and I’ll reserve final judgment for when we drive a Santa Fe back home in the Chicago area with less-than-ideal roads.\n\nThe Santa Fe XRT trim level is more aggressive than Hyundai’s other off-road offerings, with a raised ride height from suspension changes and larger-diameter all-terrain tires. I’ll say that the difference between driving the off-road XRT and Calligraphy over the same gravel road was stark; the 18-inch wheels, all-terrain tires and suspension on the XRT glided over a gravely path, while the Calligraphy was extremely busy and disturbed over the same terrain. On an off-road path up and down a steep hill, the XRT did the job without incident. More than its off-road proficiency, driving the Santa Fe over rocky and rutted terrain showed how solidly the Santa Fe is put together, with no creaks, groans or squeaks from the suspension or body.\n\n2024 Hyundai Santa Fe | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2024 Hyundai Santa Fe: New Looks Outside and Inside, Carryover Powertrains\nUp Close With the 2024 Hyundai Santa Fe: A Radical but Promising Departure\n2024 Hyundai Santa Fe Unveiled, Gets Extreme Makeover\nResearch the Hyundai Santa Fe\nIs the Santa Fe Worth It?\n\nPlacing a value on the Santa Fe is really interesting because while there is overlap between the Palisade in many trim levels, I actually think it rivals the Palisade’s interior quality in the top Calligraphy trim level and by extension is significantly higher-quality than many options in a class that include the Honda Passport, Volkswagen Atlas Cross Sport, Toyota Highlander and Subaru Outback. The Santa Fe starts at $35,345 (all prices include destination), which is about in the middle of competitors, and offers some surprising standard features, including front and rear parking sensors, a power tailgate with kick-to-open access, plus the standard third row and turbocharged engine.\n\nAt an as-tested $50,375, the Santa Fe Calligraphy is more expensive than many rivals’ top trims, though the Santa Fe also offers a unique combination of utility, quality and family-friendliness along with Hyundai’s staple of features and warranty for the money. The bulk of what I liked about the Santa Fe, however, comes in more affordable trim levels, including the overall shape and flexibility that it presents for people and cargo (up front and in back). As a family car, the Santa Fe might be one of the most exciting considerations in recent years for those who like the way it looks — and even if you don’t, because it’s that good.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in September 2013 about the 2013 Hyundai Santa Fe. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2014, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nIt’s quite rare that a car fills the stringent requirements of each of my daily roles, but with just a couple of oversights, the 2013 Hyundai Santa Fe Limited comes close to being a perfect fit.\n\nFor 2013, the Santa Fe is actually two vehicles: the Santa Fe Sport — which is a redesign of the five-seat Santa Fe that helped propel Hyundai’s rise in the U.S. — and a larger, three-row, seven-seat version called simply the Santa Fe that replaces the 2012 Hyundai Veracruz. We cover the smaller Sport separately (see the review); here we tackle the three-row Santa Fe. (Compare the two here.)\n\nSimilar vehicles worth researching if you’re in the market for a three-row crossover are the Dodge Journey, Kia Sorento and Mazda CX-9. See them compared side-by-side here.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe exterior of the Santa Fe Limited manages to look fluid, sleek, modern and sporty all at once. Its slightly sloping, angled rear roofline leads to an angled rear window, as well, which intentionally brings attention to the greater passenger-hauling capability of the longer Santa Fe.\n\nThis smaller, angled rear window, while looking sharp, could cause some slight visibility problems for the driver.\n\nFAMILY-FRIENDLY FEATURES\nIn this class of price-conscious three-row crossovers, it’s quite tricky to find one with captain’s chairs in the second row. The Santa Fe has them in its higher, Limited trim level, which reduces the total seat count to six. The lower GLS trim has the usual second-row bench seat for three. My family is in the market for a three-row crossover, and I won’t even look at something without captain’s chairs. I have one (sometimes two) kids still in booster seats, which generally get installed in the outboard positions of the second row, depending upon the dimensions of the car and the seats. I don’t care how easy a car manufacturer claims it is to flip, flop, fold or slide the second-row bench to get to the third row; nothing is as easy for kids as simply slipping through a passageway between captain’s chairs.\n\nThe captain’s chairs in the Santa Fe Limited have the added benefit of also folding and/or sliding, customizing the interior of the car with additional legroom in either the second or third row, depending where you need it.\n\nThe Limited version I drove had standard heated seats for the driver and passenger as well as in the second row. An additional $2,900 Technology Package pushed the luxury quotient much higher than I was anticipating with a massive panoramic moonroof (it’s so impressive even an adult would ride in the “way back” just for the wide-open sky view), a heated steering wheel and rear side-window sunshades.\n\nThe third-row passengers have control over their own heat and air conditioning, with the ability to turn their air on or off, adjust the direction of airflow toward their feet or heads, adjust the speed of their airflow, and control the temperature. This is a feature I haven’t seen in any other car in the class; most three-row crossovers are lucky to have an air vent back there.\n\nThe third row is split 50/50 and folds flat via pull tabs on the back of the seats, giving you the ability to increase cargo space when you need to switch from a normal grocery run to a Costco run. Pulling a release lever in the cargo area instantly folds the second-row seats, as well, increasing cargo space even further. There’s also a standard 115-volt power outlet (like those found in a home) in the cargo area. While I love the idea of being able to plug a slew of electronics into the car, this feature would be more useful in the main passenger compartment than in the cargo area.\n\nThe Santa Fe Limited I drove came with a standard proximity key with push-button start, a power liftgate, a backup camera and power-adjustable driver and passenger seats.\n\nNow onto one of those blatant oversights I mentioned earlier: There’s no memory function for the power driver’s seat. In my family, I tend to drive the kids around all day and my husband (who is nearly a foot taller than me) often switches into the driver’s seat for evening hauls home from the dance studio or piano lessons. The next morning when I get back in, I have to start over from scratch to find the perfect position in the eight-way adjustable seat, not to mention adjust the side mirrors, as well. This is just plain annoying; I’d much rather just push a button and have the car “remember” me and move around to custom-fit my 5-foot-3-inch frame. Or better yet, it should remember my settings based on the key I use.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Excellent\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nBEHIND THE WHEEL\nI’ve become increasingly aware recently of the difficulty in finding a vehicle I like both as a driver and as a passenger. As a driver, I prefer a slightly tighter, more car-like feel, with enough steering feedback to feel connected to the road and enough give to the suspension to not have my brains jiggled about driving to and from school each day. As a passenger, however, I want to feel like I’m being chauffeured around, surrounded by softness and luxury.\n\nThe Santa Fe Limited fits the bill thanks to a comfortable suspension and standard driver-selectable steering modes. The driver can select among Comfort, Normal and Sport modes via the press of a button on the steering wheel, creating a softer or firmer feel to the steering feedback. I prefer to go through the day in Sport mode, as that feels most familiar to me given my current personal car is a small sedan. My husband chose the Comfort mode, which seemed to be very forgiving, smoothing out any herks or jerks passengers may feel from a more heavy-handed driver.\n\nThe Santa Fe Limited’s 3.3-liter V-6 engine with optional all-wheel drive has plenty of get up and go on both city streets and highways. Braking is smooth, with an acceptably linear feel through the entire braking cycle, and there is little to no tilt or roll in the corners.\n\nThe all-wheel-drive Santa Fe gets an EPA-estimated 18/24/20 mpg city/highway/combined. The standard front-wheel drive gets an estimated 18/25/21 mpg.\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2013 Santa Fe has not been crash-tested.\n\nThe Santa Fe comes with seven standard airbags: driver and front passenger front-impact airbags, driver and front passenger seat-mounted side-impact airbags, side curtain airbags, and a driver knee airbag.\n\nAs has been required since the 2012 model year, the Santa Fe has standard antilock brakes, electronic stability control and traction control.\n\nThe second-row captain’s chairs in the Santa Fe Limited are a dream for families with kids of booster-seat age. They recline quite a bit, allowing parents to take the edge off for kids who still nap in the car (slumping over the seat belt just can’t be comfortable or safe). This also allows for a more custom fit with different child-safety or booster seats that have slightly different angles to their backs.\n\nThe seat belt buckles in the captain’s chairs are on stable bases, making them easy for kids with small hands and limited dexterity to buckle independently. The belt buckles in the third row are on floppy nylon bases, but as you’d generally put bigger kids in the “way back,” that shouldn’t be a problem.\n\nThe other oversight is the lack of blind spot monitors in the Santa Fe Limited, as is true on Hyundai’s entire 2013 product line. Other car manufacturers have taken to installing these as either standard or optional equipment, even on budget-priced cars like the $20,000 Dodge Dart — so much so that I’ve grown to appreciate and even rely on them in all the highway driving my family and I do. While Hyundai representatives can’t comment upon future product development, we know that the 2014 Hyundai Equus will have blind spot monitors, so I’m crossing my fingers they start to find their way into Hyundai’s other vehicles, as well.\n\nSee all the standard safety features listed here.\n\nIN THE MARKET\nIn the past years, crossovers have become increasingly powerful players in the market. With the Santa Fe Limited topping out close to $40,000, it may not seem like a budget- or entry-level option. However, compared side by side with similarly equipped models, the Santa Fe Limited offers more features, higher-quality fit and finish, and of course Hyundai’s legendary 10-year, 100,000-mile powertrain warranty — which may be difficult for savvy, value-conscious shoppers to resist.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: A new optional powertrain fixes the most significant weakness in the otherwise well-rounded Santa Fe.\n\nVersus the competition: Even with a new top trim level, called Calligraphy, the most expensive Santa Fe is still more affordable than most of its rivals’ high-end offerings — and a great value in terms of features for the money. And now it can be fun to drive, too? Rude.\n\nThough it feels like ages ago, it hasn’t been two years since we last compared mid-size five-seat SUVs. In that test, the previous generation of the Hyundai Santa Fe eked out a victory by a single point. It was the lowest-priced vehicle in our test by more than $4,000, and it used its combination of value, straightforward and useful tech, and a well-appointed interior to grab the title. All those are still strengths in the new Santa Fe.\n\nRelated: How Do Car Seats Fit in a 2021 Hyundai Santa Fe?\n\n\nThe only thing holding the Santa Fe back was its optional turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine and eight-speed automatic transmission. The engine produced only modest power, and the transmission seemed dead set against letting anyone use what power it had. The judges — of whom I was one — all preferred to drive other SUVs in the test when we had a choice. Despite its win, our conclusion was that “we’d like to see the 2.0T powertrain improved.”\n\n“Hyundai can do better,” we said then, “and should.”\n\nAnd, boy, did they.\n\nChallenge Accepted\n\nAs part of the Santa Fe’s updates for 2021, Hyundai gave it three new powertrains. The new standard engine is a 2.5-liter four-cylinder (replacing a 2.4-liter four-pot), and there’s a new Santa Fe Hybrid, as well. The vehicle we tested, however, had the cream-of-the crop setup: A turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder that ditches the traditional torque-converter eight-speed automatic transmission for an eight-speed wet dual-clutch automatic.\n\nThe 2.5 turbo (replacing the 2.0 turbo) makes 281 horsepower and 311 pounds-feet of torque — increases of 46 hp and 51 pounds-feet. It’s paired with the new dual-clutch transmission, which shifts smartly through gears and is not only willing but happy to downshift. The most powerful Santa Fe is now … quick — almost unnervingly so. Not because it will blow away supercars off the line — though it will win more stoplight drag races than you might expect — but because it’s such a radical departure from the experience of the previous, frustrating Santa Fe turbo. Power delivery is swift and linear, and passing power is always readily available.\n\nBut wait, there’s more! Surely a larger displacement engine with significantly more power would come with a gas mileage penalty, right? It doesn’t, at least according to the EPA. An all-wheel-drive 2021 Santa Fe with the 2.5 turbo is rated 21/28/24 mpg city/highway/combined, while an AWD 2020 Santa Fe powered by the 2.0-liter turbo managed a rating of only 20/26/22 mpg. Your mileage may vary, literally, particularly if you frequently indulge in the Santa Fe’s Sport driving mode and bury the accelerator pedal into the floor, but it’s capable of better fuel economy than the previous powertrain.\n\nOur only quibbles with the new Santa Fe’s driving experience are that the dual-clutch transmission can still feel a little herky-jerky during very low-speed driving, and that, of all things, the ride and handling don’t quite match the powertrain’s performance. Ride and handling with my vehicle’s 19-inch wheels weren’t bad by any stretch, but nor were they quite up to spirited driving. We also noticed a bit of jitteriness at highway speeds. Upgrading to the optional 20-inch wheels for an extra $200 might exacerbate some of these issues. Still, if Hyundai wanted to throw some performance tires on the Santa Fe and retune the suspension, a Santa Fe N Line or full N version might give the Ford Edge ST a run for the “Why Does This Exist?” performance SUV title.\n\nDoes ‘Calligraphy’ Write Checks the Interior Can’t Cash?\n\nThe 2021 model year also sees the introduction of the Calligraphy trim level to the Santa Fe lineup, slotting above the Limited as the nicest Santa Fe you can get. Inside, Calligraphy brings quilted Nappa leather upholstery on the seats, a headliner made of imitation suede (called “eco-suede”), a full-color head-up display and some extra interior niceties. Updated but still good is the Santa Fe’s straightforward touchscreen interface. It has intuitive physical controls, solid outward visibility, and wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity. The lower S and SEL trims have smaller touchscreens and wireless versions of both, though the SEL can be “upgraded” to a wired experience along with the larger touchscreen.\n\nThe Calligraphy interior definitely gets closer to a premium level, though the Santa Fe’s cousin, the Kia Sorento, does a better job. The large plastic trim pieces I complained about in the previous generation’s door panels are still present and I still find them aggravating. Overall, the Calligraphy feels nice enough to be worth the price premium over the Limited — $1,800 to $2,000 depending on wheel size — but it isn’t nice enough to trick you into thinking it’s a luxury vehicle.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that despite the Santa Fe Calligraphy being a Hyundai with Nappa leather, no one who drove it complained of the foul odors that plagued our long-term Palisade’s interior. It should also be noted that I was in the “either it doesn’t bother me or I’m noseblind” camp when it came to that smell, but hopefully this means Hyundai has worked out the issues.\n\nIs the Santa Fe a Palisade Alternative?\n\nBesides the Calligraphy trim, every 2021 Santa Fe gets a new interior design that makes it feel like a smaller, two-row Palisade. It has a larger, taller and more angular center console design with ample storage underneath, topped by an 8- or 10.25-inch touchscreen above a push-button gear selector. I found that the wide console cut into my leg space a bit while driving, but your legs and seating position may produce a different result. In the backseat, I had copious amounts of headroom and legroom, even though the backseat only reclines and doesn’t slide. Cargo room is also impressive thanks in part to the lack of a third row, and though Hyundai provides only a tire repair kit instead of a spare, it makes up for it by having significant underfloor storage space.\n\nSo, given the Santa Fe now looks like a Palisade on the inside, is it a two-row alternative? We’ve already discussed how the Santa Fe and Palisade’s cousins, the Kia Sorento and Telluride, step on each other’s toes, but I think the Hyundais do a better job of avoiding that problem.\n\nFor starters, the Santa Fe isn’t available with a third row. If you want to seat more than five people in a Hyundai, your only choice right now is the Palisade. And while the Santa Fe’s cargo space is nothing to sneeze at, the Palisade has it beat, both by Hyundai’s measurements and our own; Hyundai cites 45.8 cubic feet behind the Palisade’s second row to the Santa Fe’s 36.4. The Palisade also has a towing capacity advantage, maxing out at 5,000 pounds versus the Santa Fe’s 3,500 max.\n\nOur measurements didn’t reflect as great a difference as Hyundai’s, but the Palisade still has the advantage. We developed our system to eliminate inconsistencies in the ways trunks and hatchbacks are reported, and to erase troubling differences we’ve observed between brands. Our numbers typically render specs that are lower for hatches (measured only to the top of the rear seatbacks) and higher for trunks when compared with manufacturer data. We measured the Santa Fe’s volume behind the second row at 25.3 cubic feet, roughly 1 cubic foot less than the Palisade. For comparison, we measured the same space in a 2021 Sorento at 22.1 cubic feet. \n\nAmong Hyundai’s competitors, a five-seat 2021 Toyota Venza had 15.5 cubic feet, the five-seat Toyota RAV4 Hybrid had 20.7 cubic feet, and a three-row Toyota Highlander had 24.0 cubic feet behind its second row.\n\nOne clear advantage for the Santa Fe over the Palisade is its fuel economy: The 2.5-liter turbo is rated 3 mpg combined higher than the Palisade’s naturally aspirated 3.8-liter V-6. Another is price: The Santa Fe costs more than $5,000 — sometimes $6,000 — less than a virtually identical Palisade. The Santa Fe’s 2.5 turbo is also torquier, with 49 more pounds-feet to work with in a lighter vehicle than the Palisade.\n\nThe Santa Fe may poach a Palisade sale here or there, but only among shoppers who aren’t set on having three rows of seating. The two vehicles are different enough that most shoppers won’t consider both, unlike the three-row Kias.\n\nSafety Updates\n\nAs of this writing, the 2021 Santa Fe has yet to be fully rated by either the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration; you’ll find IIHS results here and NHTSA results here if/when testing takes place at a later date. The Santa Fe had solid child-safety seat scores in our Car Seat Check.\n\nNew safety features for 2021 include Hyundai’s hands-on semi-autonomous Highway Drive Assist, cyclist and junction-turning detection for the forward automatic emergency braking system, new rear low-speed automatic emergency braking, lane-following assist and curve-adaptive cruise control.\n\nMy favorite safety feature, however, remains a blind-spot view monitor that activates when the turn signal is engaged and displays a real-time image of what’s in either of the Santa Fe’s blind spots in one of two areas on the 12.3-inch digital instrument panel, which comes standard on the Calligraphy and Limited and is available on the SEL. The feature is incredibly useful, and I appreciate that the image is displayed on the side of the screen that corresponds to the turn indicator being used.\n\nPricier, but Still a Value Leader\n\nDespite being the new highest trim of the Santa Fe, the Calligraphy still feels like a relative bargain. With 19-inch wheels, the Calligraphy is only $2,000 more than a Santa Fe Limited before options. With $300 Quartz White paint and $185 carpeted floormats, plus a destination fee of $1,175, our test vehicle came out to $43,730. That’s a solid chunk of change, and definitely a departure from the previous generation’s ability to be fully loaded for under $40,000.\n\nThat price, however, would still be the lowest as-tested price in our 2-year-old mid-size SUV comparison test. Since that time, top trims of the Nissan Murano and Honda Passport have both risen in price, while the Ford Edge costs a bit less but also comes with fewer standard features.\n\nThe last time we compared this class of vehicles, the Santa Fe narrowly won in spite of itself. With significant improvements to its optional turbocharged powertrain and an even nicer interior, the new generation of Santa Fe looks poised to sit atop the group a bit longer.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The gas-powered Hyundai Santa Fe is practically the perfect family SUV, with top-notch space, comfort, technology and driving dynamics, only struggling when it comes to fuel economy with the turbo engine.\n\nVersus the competition: You could make a real case for the Santa Fe being the benchmark in this category, so good is it — few competitors can match the Santa Fe’s refinement, space, and performance, especially at this price.\n\nIt’s not often I throw around the “b-word” when talking about cars, because using the term “benchmark” is a pretty bold claim. That means it’s the standard against which all others should be judged, and that’s quite an achievement for any automaker. But as I spent more and more time driving and using the 2023 Hyundai Santa Fe over the course of a week, the gasoline-only version (not the hybrid) in top Calligraphy trim, that’s the word that kept coming back to mind for me. There are few cars I can think of that don’t have several things I can point to and say, “That’s not great.” This latest Santa Fe is one in which I actually struggled to come with items in the “What We Don’t Like” category for our research page. Simply put, it’s very, very good in just about every single category I can think of. It’s one of the few vehicles I’ve ever driven that I actually can’t point to a bunch of things and say, “That’s not great,” because so much of it is, well, exactly what it needs to be.\n\nRelated: What’s Changed for the 2023 Hyundai Santa Fe?\n\nForgoing Fake Frippery\n\nNow, this isn’t to say the Hyundai Santa Fe is the “perfect car.” It’s not suitable for a track day event, or scaling the Rubicon Trail, or towing a boat. But for its intended purpose to be an average, everyday family vehicle that seats five people in comfort and safety and has the means to entertain them on the journey, it comes damned close to that goal. It starts with the styling, the latest version of which is a slick combination of Hyundai’s latest avant garde looks (there really isn’t a “corporate” Hyundai look; all its vehicles look different yet somehow similar) that combine some interesting lighting elements and flowing, futuristic sheet metal. What you can say about the Santa Fe’s styling is that it’s interesting without being weird. It looks futuristic, with distinctive fanglike lighting elements up front and slim taillights in the back that have become a hallmark of Hyundai design — using the lighting elements themselves as critical styling features instead of being hidden or used as afterthoughts. Down the side, the wheel arches are emphasized with oversize patterns that match the openings, making the already big wheels and tires (20-inchers on this top-spec Calligraphy trim) appear even larger. The whole look is fresh, modern and attractive, somehow making a traditional two-box SUV shape look appealing without resorting to fake off-road frippery.\n\nClassy, Not Sassy\n\nInside the Santa Fe, you’re greeted with a clean design that’s modern without resorting to that massively annoying new trend of taking you to touchscreenland. Yes, there is indeed a big 10.25-inch touchscreen perched atop the center console, but there is also a massive bank of buttons and switches below it that offer a lot of redundant control of systems from climate to audio. Are there too many buttons? Well, maybe, but they’re all large, well marked and have the benefit of always being in the same place so they’re easy to use on the fly without resorting to multiple touches of a virtual screen button. The transmission shifter is also push-button, and we’re less thrilled with that, but it’s at least not angled away from you like it is in Hyundai’s smaller Tucson, so while it’s not as intuitive to use as a shift lever, it could be worse.\n\nBut it’s the combination of outstanding comfort in any of the Santa Fe’s five seating positions and the genuinely premium materials used throughout the cabin that really sets it apart. It’s just really, really nice in there, with soft-touch plastics in stylish shapes mated to tightly assembled panels, knobs and switches. There’s plenty of hip and shoulder room for first- and second-row occupants, and there’s legroom galore, as well. Even with the panoramic moonroof, there’s plenty of headroom thanks to the front seats’ excellent adjustability. My only complaint? The monotony of the color palette; it’s a sea of somber gray in there, and while some call that classy and elegant, I think it’s a little unnecessarily boring. Many automakers are bringing color back into interiors, with blues and greens making a renewed appearance; the Santa Fe could do with a zesty splash of it to break up the funereal grayscale theme.\n\nThe Tech Leader\n\nThe onboard tech is another reason I use the “b-word” around the Santa Fe — truly, nobody does multimedia and graphic displays better than Hyundai. That 10.25-inch touchscreen is chock full of features, information, graphics and customization options that let you have any number of options for how you want to control the vehicle’s systems and what you want it to show you. The digital gauge cluster can be had in one of four different themes, one of them truly out there in terms of uniqueness (cubes?!), but again, the level of customization combined with the bright clarity of the displays themselves is just outstanding. So many automakers have digital displays and do nothing interesting with them; Hyundai considers it yet another canvas for creative looks and manages to make some interesting things without driving users nuts trying to figure out how it all works. The only complaint about this system is one that’s common throughout all Hyundais with this big screen: There’s still no wireless Apple CarPlay available. It was an electronics decision Hyundai made years ago in developing the 10.25-inch system that it has yet to correct, but it is indeed notable by its absence … especially when you can get wireless Apple CarPlay with Hyundai’s smaller, lesser systems in less expensive models. Weird, eh?\n\nZippy, Not Sippy\n\nThe powertrain for this top Calligraphy model is the bigger turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine mated to an eight-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission driving all four wheels through permanent all-wheel drive. It pumps out a hefty 281 horsepower and 311 pounds-feet of torque, which is more than enough to get the Santa Fe scooting through traffic with a full load of people and luggage, and with even more alacrity if it’s just a driver on board. Acceleration is brisk, making highway entry ramps a breeze, and the eight-speed dual-clutch automatic is surprisingly smooth and unobtrusive, providing easy, quick shifts up or down the gear range when called for. The base engine in the Santa Fe is considerably less powerful: a naturally aspirated 2.5-liter four-cylinder making just 191 hp and 181 pounds-feet of torque, and that doesn’t sound terribly exciting. There are also two hybrid versions, one of them a plug-in with a dedicated electric range, for people who are more fuel-economy-minded. The downside to this powerful turbo engine is that fuel economy isn’t great: It’s EPA-rated at 21/28/24 mpg city/highway/combined, but my testing over the course of a week (and not even really with all that heavy a foot) only saw the Santa Fe return an average of 18 mpg, a pitiful showing for the vehicle.\n\nThe rest of the driving experience is excellent, however, thanks to an outstanding ride-and-handling balance. I wouldn’t call the Santa Fe athletic (although its zippy powertrain might disagree), with steering feel that’s acceptable (not numb like many other crossovers) and a ride that’s tuned more for comfort than sport, but sport is not the vehicle’s mission; well-controlled, confident family hauling is. And in that mission, the Santa Fe excels. The cabin is quiet at highway speeds or even under full acceleration, with very little wind or road noise making it to passengers’ ears. The ride is smooth and amazingly well damped even with the big 20-inch wheels wearing low-profile all-season tires. The brakes are strong, progressive and don’t exhibit any fade after repeated hard stops. It’s just so damned pleasant in nearly every way, there’s nothing to fault except that lackluster fuel economy.\n\nPacked, But Not Pricey\n\nWhat seals the deal for the new Santa Fe? It’s reasonable pricing. At the low end, the base entry price for a Santa Fe is just a tick over $30,000 (all prices include destination charge) for a front-wheel-drive SE model with the base 2.5-liter engine. It stretches up to the loaded Calligraphy 2.5T AWD I tested with an as-delivered price of $45,255. That actually brings a loaded gas-powered, luxurious, fully kitted Santa Fe in several thousand dollars less than the average transaction price for a new car in the U.S. Even a fully loaded plug-in hybrid version of the Santa Fe doesn’t top $50,000, which is kind of extraordinary.\n\nSo it has value, comfort, style, technology, room and just oozes competency. And if fuel economy is an issue, opt for the hybrid. The ‘23 Santa Fe ticks all the right boxes, and I confidently consider it to be the new benchmark for a family crossover.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nWhat’s the Best Compact SUV of 2023?\n2024 Hyundai Kona: Updated Performance, EV Offers Estimated 260 Miles of Range\nRedesigned 2024 Hyundai Sonata Embraces Curves Inside and Out\nResearch SUVs\nShop for a 2023 Hyundai Santa Fe\n\nRelated Video: \n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "It’s quite rare that a car fills the stringent requirements of each of my daily roles, but with just a couple of oversights, the 2013 Hyundai Santa Fe Limited comes close to being a perfect fit.\n\nFor 2013, the Santa Fe is actually two vehicles: the Hyundai Santa Fe Sport — which is a redesign of the five-seat Santa Fe that helped propel Hyundai’s rise in the U.S. — and a larger, three-row, seven-seat SUV version called simply the Santa Fe that replaces the 2012 Hyundai Veracruz. We cover the smaller Sport separately; here we tackle the three-row Santa Fe. (Compare the two here.)\n\nSimilar vehicles worth researching if you’re in the market for a three-row crossover are the Dodge Journey, Kia Sorento and Mazda CX-9. See them compared side-by-side here.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe exterior of the Santa Fe Limited manages to look fluid, sleek, modern and sporty all at once. Its slightly sloping, angled rear roofline leads to an angled rear window, as well, which intentionally brings attention to the greater passenger-hauling capability of the longer Santa Fe.\n\nThis smaller, angled rear window, while looking sharp, could cause some slight visibility problems for the driver.\n\nFAMILY-FRIENDLY FEATURES\nIn this class of price-conscious three-row crossovers, it’s quite tricky to find one with captain’s chairs in the second row. The Santa Fe has them in its higher, Limited trim level, which reduces the total seat count to six. The lower Hyundai Santa Fe GLS trim has the usual bench seat for three. My family is in the market for a three-row crossover, and I won’t even look at something without captain’s chairs. I have one (sometimes two) kids still in booster seats, which generally get installed in the outboard positions of the second row, depending upon the dimensions of the car and the seats. I don’t care how easy a car manufacturer claims it is to flip, flop, fold or slide the second-row bench to get to the third row; nothing is as easy for kids as simply slipping through a passageway between captain’s chairs.\n\nThe captain’s chairs in the Santa Fe Limited have the added benefit of also folding and/or sliding, customizing the interior of the car with additional legroom in either the second or third row, depending where you need it.\n\nThe Limited version I drove had standard heated leather seats for the driver and passenger as well as in the second row. An additional $2,900 Technology Package pushed the luxury quotient much higher than I was anticipating with a massive panoramic moonroof (it’s so impressive even an adult would ride in the “way back” just for the wide-open sky view), a heated steering wheel and rear side window sunshades.\n\nThe third-row passengers have control over their own heat and air conditioning, with the ability to turn their air on or off, adjust the direction of airflow toward their feet or heads, adjust the speed of their airflow, and control the temperature. This is a feature I haven’t seen in any other car in the class; most three-row crossovers are lucky to have an air vent back there.\n\nThe third row is split 50/50 and folds flat via pull tabs on the back of the seats, giving you the ability to increase cargo space when you need to switch from a normal grocery run to a Costco run. Pulling a release lever in the cargo area instantly folds the second row seats, as well, increasing cargo space even further. There’s also a standard home, 115-volt power outlet in the cargo area. While I love the idea of being able to plug a slew of electronics into the car, this feature would be more useful in the main passenger compartment than in the cargo area.\n\nThe Hyundai Santa Fe Limited I drove came with a standard keyless entry and proximity key with push-button start, a power liftgate, a backup camera and power-adjustable driver and passenger seats.\n\nNow onto one of those blatant oversights I mentioned earlier: There’s no memory function for the multi-adjustable power driver’s seat. In my family, I tend to drive the kids around all day and my husband (who is nearly a foot taller than me) often switches into the driver’s seat for evening hauls home from the dance studio or piano lessons. The next morning when I get back in, I have to start over from scratch to find the perfect position in the eight-way adjustable seat, not to mention adjust the side mirrors, as well. This is just plain annoying; I’d much rather just push a button and have the car “remember” me and move around to custom-fit my 5-foot, 3-inch frame. Or better yet, it should remember my settings based on the key I use.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Excellent\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nBEHIND THE WHEEL\nI’ve become increasingly aware recently of the difficulty in finding a seven-passenger vehicle I like both as a driver and as a passenger. As a driver, I prefer a slightly tighter, more car-like feel, with enough steering feedback to feel connected to the road and enough give to the suspension to not have my brains jiggled about driving to and from school each day. As a passenger, however, I want to feel like I’m being chauffeured around, surrounded by softness and luxury.The Santa Fe Limited fits the bill thanks to a comfortable suspension and standard driver-selectable steering modes. The driver can select among Comfort, Normal and Sport modes via the press of a button on the steering wheel, creating a softer or firmer feel to the steering feedback. I prefer to go through the day in Sport mode, as that feels most familiar to me given my current personal car is a small sedan. My husband chose the Comfort mode, which seemed to be very forgiving, smoothing out any herks or jerks passengers may feel from a more heavy-handed driver.\n\nThe Santa Fe Limited’s 3.3-liter V-6 engine with optional all-wheel drive has plenty of get up and go on both city streets and highways. Braking is smooth, with an acceptably linear feel through the entire braking cycle, and there is little to no tilt or roll in the corners.\n\nThe AWD Hyundai Santa Fe gets an EPA-estimated 18/24/20 mpg city/highway/combined. The standard FWD gets an estimated 18/25/21 mpg.\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2013 Hyundai Santa Fe is a Top Safety Pick, having received top crash scores of Good in all tests conducted by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.\n\nThe Hyundai Santa Fe comes with seven standard airbags: driver and front passenger, driver and front passenger seat-mounted side-impact airbags, side curtain airbags, and a driver knee airbag.\n\nAs has been required since the 2012 model year, the Santa Fe has standard antilock brakes, electronic stability control and traction control.\n\nThe second-row captain’s chairs in the Santa Fe Limited are a dream for families with kids of booster-seat age. They recline quite a bit, allowing parents to take the edge off for kids who still nap in the car (slumping over the seat belt just can’t be comfortable or safe). This also allows for a more custom fit with different car seats or booster seats that have slightly different angles to their backs.\n\nThe seat belt buckles in the captain’s chairs are on stable bases, making them easy for kids with small hands and limited dexterity to buckle independently. The belt buckles in the third row are on more floppy nylon bases, but as you’d generally put bigger kids in the “way back,” that shouldn’t be a problem.\n\nThe other oversight is the lack of blind spot monitors in the Santa Fe Limited, as is true on Hyundai’s entire 2013 product line. Other car manufacturers have taken to installing these as either standard or optional equipment, even on budget-priced cars like the $20,000 Dodge Dart — so much so that I’ve grown to appreciate and even rely on them in all the highway driving my family and I do. While Hyundai representatives can’t comment upon future product development, we know that the 2014 Hyundai Equus will have blind spot monitors, so I’m crossing my fingers they start to find their way into Hyundai’s other vehicles, as well.\n\nSee all the standard safety features listed here.\n\nIN THE MARKET\nIn the past years, crossovers have become increasingly powerful players in the market. With the Santa Fe Limited topping out close to $40,000, it may not seem like a base-price budget- or entry-level option. However, compared side by side with similarly equipped models, the Santa Fe Limited offers more features, higher-quality fit and finish, and of course Hyundai’s legendary 10-year, 100,000-mile powertrain warranty — which may be difficult for savvy, value-conscious shoppers to resist.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Hyundai has tinkered with the names of its mid-size and full-size SUVs for the 2019 model year. The redesigned two-row 2019 Santa Fe reviewed here replaces the Santa Fe Sport in Hyundai’s lineup, and the three-row Santa Fe has been dubbed Santa Fe XL for 2019 but is a carryover model with few changes. The Santa Fe XL isn’t long for this world, though; it’s slated to be replaced by the three-row Hyundai Palisade, which will arrive next summer as a 2020 model.\n\nThe 2019 Santa Fe starts at $26,545, including a $1,045 destination charge, for a base front-wheel-drive SE trim. We tested two higher-end versions: a $36,620 front-wheel-drive Ultimate with the 185-horsepower, 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine that goes in most trims, as well as a $39,970 all-wheel-drive Ultimate with the optional 235-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder.\n\nMore SUV, More Futuristic\n\nThe 2019 Santa Fe’s profile looks more upright than the outgoing Santa Fe Sport’s, with a windshield that’s not as raked. It looks more like an SUV now, and one big practical advantage of the design is good visibility: Thin front roof pillars and side mirrors mounted on the front doors (rather than the base of those pillars) help give the Santa Fe great forward views. Hyundai also flattened out the SUV’s beltline, increasing visibility for rear passengers and providing better over-shoulder views for the driver.\n\nThe Santa Fe’s front end is, without question, the most polarizing aspect of the design. Like Hyundai’s subcompact Kona SUV and upcoming three-row Palisade, the Santa Fe has slim LED daytime running lights that sit below the front edges of the hood and flank a gaping grille (the headlights sit below the DRLs). It’s not a new design tactic — the pre-2019 Jeep Cherokee had something similar — but it’s an approach that’s gaining steam; the upcoming 2019 Blazer also uses it.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThe Santa Fe is composed and comfortable in the city and on rural two-lane highways, but it’s flustered by more challenging, twisty roads. Some drivetrain-tuning choices also hurt the driving experience.\n\nThe standard 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine makes adequate power, but full-throttle acceleration is modest. The engine works with an eight-speed automatic transmission that kicks down quickly but isn’t always willing to select as low a gear as is needed.\n\nGas-pedal response is gradual in the Comfort drive mode, but you get used to it after a while. The Sport mode, however, isn’t great in everyday driving; it makes the gas pedal extremely sensitive, to the point that it’s hard to accelerate smoothly or hold a steady speed.\n\nThe optional turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder performs very well. It’s smooth and produces a lot of midrange power that helps the Santa Fe build speed rapidly. It’s also quieter than the base four-cylinder. Still, passing power is modest with this engine, too, and the automatic transmission’s unwillingness to kick down into its lower gears is partly to blame. Gas-pedal responsiveness is an issue with the turbo engine, as well; there’s some lag when starting off from a stop regardless of whether you’re in Comfort or Sport. Once you’re moving, the gas pedal can feel a bit too responsive, with a jumpiness that makes accelerating smoothly more difficult than it should be.\n\nThe Santa Fe’s suspension is comfort-oriented without feeling floaty, which seems like the right approach for this class. It feels composed and stable through sweeping corners, but handling suffers on more challenging roads due to numb, isolating steering feel and moderate body roll in tight corners.\n\nThe Inside\n\nHyundai touts the Santa Fe’s variable-density front seats, which use three types of cushioning. The seats are wide and supportive, but the cushions felt a little flat. Cloth upholstery is standard, and leather seating surfaces and heated front seats are included on Limited and higher trims.\n\nThe 60/40-split backseat is comfortable for adults. There’s good legroom, and the seat cushion is high enough off the floor to provide thigh support — an attribute that’s gradually vanishing across the market. On SEL Plus and higher trims, the seat slides forward and backward to balance cargo and passenger needs. The rear backrest reclines quite a bit, which gives stargazers a good view out the optional panoramic moonroof.\n\nMaterials quality in the high-end Ultimate trim is good, and the controls are sensibly arranged. The dashboard’s separated sections are intuitive, with a standard 7-inch touchscreen positioned above the center vents and air-conditioning controls, but the optional dual-zone automatic air-conditioning system’s temperature display is hard to read if viewed through polarized sunglasses.\n\nStandard technology features include Bluetooth streaming audio and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity. Satellite radio, an Infinity premium stereo, a head-up display, a 360-degree camera system, wireless device charging and a larger, 8-inch touchscreen with built-in navigation are optional.\n\nCargo\n\nThe Santa Fe has 35.9 cubic feet of cargo room behind the rear seat. The backseat folds flat with the cargo floor for a maximum 71.3 cubic feet of cargo room. There are two large bins under the cargo floor for storing items out of sight.\n\nSafety\n\nIn Insurance Institute for Highway Safety testing, the 2019 Santa Fe received the highest rating, good, in all crash tests, and the organization rated the SUV’s standard forward collision warning and automatic emergency braking systems superior, the best possible score.\n\nOther standard active-safety features include adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability, blind spot warning, lane keep assist, rear cross-traffic alert and a driver-drowsiness monitor.\n\nSEL Plus and higher trims also have Hyundai’s Rear Occupant Alert system. It monitors the backseat using a sensor, and if movement is detected after the SUV has been locked, the horn honks and the Hyundai Blue Link system sends an alert to a paired smartphone. While safety technology like this is welcome, we still recommend that drivers traveling with small children place in the rear seat something they plan on taking with them at the end of the trip, like a backpack or purse, to help minimize the chances a child is accidentally left inside.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nHyundai has long been known for giving shoppers a lot for their money, and the redesigned Santa Fe reinforces that reputation with its long list of standard active-safety and technology features at a starting price thousands of dollars less than some competitors. There’s a lot here to like — especially if the drivetrain quirks aren’t deal-breakers for you.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "We were a quarter of the way up the hill when I felt the Hyundai Santa Fe’s tires start slipping and I got that sinking feeling in my stomach. The steep, rock-strewn dirt path rising 275 feet to the top of Empire Pass outside Park City, Utah, was the final leg of our drive route, and now I wondered whether we were going to make it to the top just as a fast-moving hailstorm was rolling over the mountains.\n\nBefore I could really think about what I’d do if we started sliding down the hill, the Santa Fe’s rear wheels picked up the slack and kept us moving forward. It was an impressive performance by the redesigned 2019 Santa Fe’s optional all-wheel-drive system on the kind of terrain Jeep typically finds to demonstrate the off-road capabilities of the Cherokee and Grand Cherokee, two Santa Fe competitors.\n\nRelated: Video: 2019 Hyundai Santa Fe First Drive\n\nShowcasing the Santa Fe’s off-road capabilities — albeit in a controlled setting — aligns with Hyundai’s goal of reestablishing the Santa Fe’s SUV cred just as a wave of all-new and redesigned two-row mid-size SUVs are slated to hit dealerships in the coming months. The 2019 Santa Fe, which replaces the five-seat Santa Fe Sport in Hyundai’s lineup, is arriving at dealerships now.\n\n2019 Hyundai Santa Fe | Cars.com photo by Mike Hanley\n\nThe 2019 Santa Fe’s profile looks more upright than the Santa Fe Sport’s, with a windshield that’s not as raked. The design does give it something of a traditional SUV look, but a big practical advantage is good visibility: Thin front roof pillars and side mirrors mounted on the front doors rather than the base of those pillars contribute to the Santa Fe’s great forward views. Hyundai has also flattened out the SUV’s beltline, increasing visibility for rear passengers and providing better over-shoulder views for the driver.  \n\nThe Santa Fe’s front end is, without question, the most polarizing aspect of the design. Like Hyundai’s subcompact Kona SUV, the Santa Fe has slim LED daytime running lights below the front edges of the hood that flank a gaping grille (the headlights sit below the daytime running lights). It’s not a new design tactic — the pre-2019 Cherokee had something similar — but it’s an approach that’s gaining steam; the upcoming 2019 Chevrolet Blazer also uses it.\n\n2019 Hyundai Santa Fe | Cars.com photo by Mike Hanley\n\nThe altitude at the beginning of our drive was around 8,600 feet, and as someone who spends most of my time in the lowlands of Illinois, I could feel it. The Santa Fe’s optional turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, however, didn’t seem to mind the thin air. Rated at 235 horsepower and 260 pounds-feet of torque, the turbo four-cylinder is quiet, smooth-revving and offers great midrange punch. Passing power is modest, but that’s mainly due to the eight-speed automatic transmission, which was unwilling to choose a low enough gear even when it kicked down.\n\nThe gas pedal’s responsiveness also takes a little bit away from the powertrain. There’s some lag when starting off from a stop regardless of whether you’re in the Comfort or Sport drive mode, and once you’re moving, the gas pedal can feel a bit too responsive, with a jumpiness that makes accelerating smoothly harder than it should be. \n\nI don’t think I encountered a single pothole during our daylong drive, which has to be a minor miracle. The Santa Fe’s suspension tuning is comfort-oriented without feeling floaty, which seems like the right approach for this class. It feels composed and stable through sweeping corners, but its handling doesn’t set it apart; the Santa Fe has numb, isolating steering feel and moderate body roll in tight corners.\n\n2019 Hyundai Santa Fe | Cars.com photo by Mike Hanley\n\nHyundai touts the Santa Fe’s variable-density front seats, which use three types of cushioning. The seats are wide and supportive, but the cushions felt a little flat to me. The 60/40-split folding backseat is comfortable for adults; there’s good legroom and the seat cushion is high enough off the floor to provide thigh support. The rear seat slides forward and backward to balance cargo and passenger needs, and the backrest reclines.\n\nAs automakers have been adding small SUVs to their lineups and redesigning large three-row models, the two-row mid-size SUV class that the Santa Fe competes in has been comparatively quiet. That’s about to change, though, as brands rush to meet consumers’ appetite for SUVs of any size.\n\nThe 2019 Santa Fe is one of the first to hit dealer lots, and while it does have some drivability issues, there’s a lot here for value-minded shoppers who want the latest active safety features at no extra cost (automatic emergency braking, blind spot warning, lane-keeping assist and adaptive cruise control are all standard). Now it just needs a way to keep the driver calm when it’s on the side of a hill.\n\n2019 Hyundai Santa Fe | Cars.com photo by Mike Hanley\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "If we were to pick the best redesigned SUVs for 2007, Hyundai’s Santa Fe would be among the finalists. The overhaul gives new life to a model that was desperately in need of an update to stay competitive in the midsize body type SUV segment.\n\nThe new Santa Fe is larger and its engines are more powerful, but it also gets better gas mileage than its predecessor. The newly optional third-row seat increases the maximum seat count to seven, and the new cabin’s overall refinement is surprisingly good. It also has numerous standard safety features and an impressive warranty.\n\n \n\nGoing & Stopping\nThe Hyundai Santa Fe is offered with a choice of two V6 engines. The base GLS has a 2.7-liter V-6 while the midlevel SE and top-of-the-line Limited — the trim level I tested — feature a larger 3.3-liter V6. A five-speed manual transmission is standard in the GLS, but a four-speed auto is optional. The Hyundai Santa Fe SE and Limited have a five-speed automatic. Front-wheel and all-wheel-drive models are offered.\n\nHyundai Santa Fe Engines\n \t2.7-liter V-6\t3.3-liter V-6\nHorsepower (@ rpm)\t185 @ 6,000\t242 @ 6,000\nTorque (lbs.-ft. @ rpm)\t183 @ 4,000\t226 @ 4,500\nRequired gasoline\tRegular\tRegular\nEPA-estimated\ngas mileage\n(city/highway, mpg)\tManual: 20/25\nAutomatic:\n21/26 (FWD)\n19/25 (AWD)\t19/24\nSource: Manufacturer\n\n \n\nWith the 3.3-liter V6, the Hyundai Santa Fe is swift enough to easily handle most drivers’ power needs. It’s a rather smooth engine, too. Whether it’s accelerating hard when merging onto the highway or just making its way through traffic, the five-speed automatic transmission always seems to be in a sensible gear for conditions. Shifts are smooth, even those that occur under full-throttle acceleration. Both automatics include Hyundai’s Shiftronic clutchless-manual mode that gives the driver control over gear changes.\n\nThe Santa Fe’s all-disc brakes have no trouble stopping the SUV, and pedal feel is nice and natural.\n\n \n\nRide & Handling\nThe Santa Fe’s very stiff suspension was probably the most surprising aspect of the SUV. It didn’t help that most of my driving was done in the Land of Potholes — a.k.a. Chicago in the spring — where smooth pavement is hard to find. Even so, a little more damping would have been appreciated. The Limited’s 18-inch alloy wheels wear lower-profile tires than the ones mounted on the GLS’ 16-inch wheels, which might offer a little more ride comfort than the 18s. The Santa Fe steers just fine, but don’t expect it to be a source of driving joy.\n\nOther aspects of the Santa Fe’s handling capabilities are certainly praiseworthy. The Santa Fe’s manageable size feels stable on the highway, where it’s surprisingly quiet even on concrete interstates adept at generating cabin noise. Wind noise levels are low, too. Body roll is noticeable through tight corners, but it’s by no means excessive for this class.\n\nThe Inside\nThe Hyundai Santa Fe’s all-new cabin is a big improvement over its predecessor’s aging design. The Limited trim level had a number of unexpected details, like dual sunglass holders, a woven headliner, thick carpeted floormats, rich bluish-purple lighting and active head restraints for the front seats that adjust forward and back as well as up and down.\n\nThat’s not to say it got everything right. While the silver-colored trim pieces in Hyundai’s new Veracruz three-row crossover actually look pretty good, the treatment in the Santa Fe looks a little cheap; black plastic would have been fine instead. The brown faux wood trim is unconvincing, and the turn-signal stalk has a notchy feel. That said, other trim and dashboard plastic has nice graining, and the overall fit and finish is good.\n\nThe cabin had a hint of the chemically new-car smell that’s plagued a number of Hyundais we’ve tested, but it wasn’t as bad as others, and it should fade over time. Cloth seats are standard and leather ones are optional. The leather front bucket seats have firm cushioning but offer a comfortable driving position. Even though the Hyundai Santa Fe’s side windows taper upward toward the rear of the cabin, overall visibility from the driver’s seat is good.\n\nThe second-row seat offers just enough legroom for tall adults (my knees were touching the back of the front seat) but there’s good foot room and generous headroom. As in the front of the cabin, the second row has extra details like air-conditioning vents in the B-pillars.\n\nReclining the 60/40-split second-row seats in our five-person Santa Fe meant lifting a handle at the top of the seat. While it works just fine, it’s not as convenient as the low-mounted lever on the side of the seat cushion that some SUVs have. The optional Touring Package includes a 50/50-split third-row seat that increases the Santa Fe’s seat count to seven.\n\nSafety\nIn the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s frontal-offset crash test, the Hyundai Santa Fe received a Good overall rating, the best possible score. As of this writing, the new generation hasn’t been tested for side-impact protection by IIHS. All trim levels have standard antilock brakes, side-impact airbags for the front seats, side curtain airbags and an electronic stability system.\n\nCargo & Towing\nThe cargo area features a clean design that maximizes usable space thanks to minimal wheel-well intrusion and generous underfloor storage space in the two-row model. There’s 34.2 cubic feet of cargo room behind the second-row seats, and folding those seats flat creates 78.2 cubic feet of total space. The inclusion of both a strap and handle to close the liftgate is a thoughtful touch. Three-row models have only 10 cubic feet of room behind the third row and lose the larger of the two underfloor storage bins.\n\nThe Hyundai Santa Fe can tow up to 2,000 pounds without any special preparation, but pulling the maximum 2,800 (GLS) or 3,500 (SE and Limited) pounds requires a Touring Package that includes a transmission cooler, upgraded radiator and fan, and trailer wiring.\n\nFeatures\nThe SUV can be equipped with most of the comfort and entertainment features you might expect, including a power sunroof, a power driver’s seat with power lumbar adjustment, an Infinity premium sound system and rear-seat video. Two notable options — a navigation system and a rearview camera — aren’t offered. Most Santa Fe options are part of packages, which makes it impossible to pick and choose many features individually.\n\nSanta Fe in the Market\nWith competitors constantly pushing the level of features, technology and refinement with each redesign, I can see how a product planner for midsize SUVs could have a lot of sleepless nights. After driving the Hyundai Santa Fe, it’s clear that Hyundai cares about getting the small things right in a vehicle, and it got enough things right in this SUV that those planners should be sleeping just fine these days . . . at least for a few months.\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "Compact crossovers are hot for good reasons: They provide great functional space, a higher riding position, decent gas mileage and a few truck-like characteristics without all of that pesky truckiness.\n\nMost have smooth car-like rides out on the road due to their unibody construction, and there are plenty for consumers to choose from: the Ford Escape, the Honda CR-V, the Toyota Rav4, to name a few.\n\nSome, like the Escape and Jeep Patriot, lean toward an SUV; others, like the CR-V and Nissan Rogue, feel more like a car.\n\nThe 2011 Hyundai Santa Fe falls somewhere in between, and not in any of the good ways. It was refreshed for the 2010 model year and will be replaced in the coming year or so. Good.\n\nFirst, the Santa Fe is just homely looking. It’s as if Hyundai was trying out a few design languages at the same time. The front end is curvy and round, while the back end grows bigger — a product of that rising belt line and flared fenders. Its proportions look off-balance.\n\nHyundai has put out some striking vehicles recently, and those cars, namely the Elantra and Sonata, make the Santa Fe look so unimpressively normal. It may not be entirely fair to draw that comparison, but who wants to catch a glimpse of HDTV and then go back to black-and-white?\n\nNot everything is bad on this vehicle. The lines of sight are good all the way around — one of the benefits of a compact crossover.\n\nComfort and function\n\nThe interior is comfortable, and it comes with a slew of features. Hyundai’s use of blue backlighting on everything from the instrument panel to the cup holders makes the cabin extremely appealing.\n\nThere’s also plenty of room inside, which is why so many crossovers are so popular. You can carry five people very comfortably as well as all of their stuff in the easy-to-load cargo area.\n\nThere are also all the luxury features so many people want, such as navigation, backup camera and Bluetooth connectivity. For this model year, Hyundai also added an optional 605-watt Infinity Logic 7 Surround Sound stereo system; it’s excellent.\n\nThis vehicle, however, needs a good stereo because it’s incredibly noisy on the road. Road and wind noise fill the cabin. One unscientific test I use on a vehicle is to count how many times I adjust the volume on my commute to work. A perfect score would be zero adjustments, simply playing the stereo from the last time I drove it. The Santa Fe scored an 8.\n\nTruckish performance\n\nInterior noise aside, the Santa Fe performed well on the road.\n\nThe ride is feels more truckish than carlike. The bumps are hard, and on the highway, I never felt confident in this vehicle. The power-assisted rack-and-pinion steering was fine in city driving, with a nice taut feel, but on the highway, it was too sensitive, which leads to lots of overcorrecting.\n\nThere’s nothing bad to say about the powertrains. The 3.5-liter V-6 matched to a six-speed automatic transmission was excellent. Unlike many crossovers, which have transmissions that race to sixth gear to improve mileage by sacrificing performance, the Santa Fe seemed to pace itself, providing good acceleration, highway cruising and everything in between.\n\nIt also gets good gas mileage, hitting 20 mpg in the city and 26 mpg on the highway. A 2.4-liter powertrain that produces 175 horsepower will get you two more miles per gallon on the highway, which makes it almost irrelevant. Why get the four-banger when the six provides 111 more horsepower and gets the same city mileage?\n\nSafety galore\n\nHyundai also packs the Santa Fe with lots of safety features, such as six air bags, electronic stability control, tire pressure monitoring and brake assist, which will apply maximum brake force if it detects an emergency.\n\nAll in all, the Santa Fe isn’t a bad vehicle. But Hyundai has raised the bar on itself, and when you get into this vehicle, there’s very little that makes you say, “Wow, I really want one of these.”\n\nHyundai doesn’t even feel like the value vehicle in this segment, which is ground the carmaker often holds over the competition. It takes $23,000 to get a base model with an automatic transmission, and the top-of-the-line model cost more than $30,000.\n\nWith so much attention being paid to compact crossovers, the expectation has become that every vehicle needs to be the very best in the bunch.\n\nThe Santa Fe is not even in the top five.\n\nsburgess@detnews.com (313) 223-3217",
