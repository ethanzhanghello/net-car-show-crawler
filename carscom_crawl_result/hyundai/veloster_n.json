      "expert_review": "We’ve already established that the 2019 Hyundai Veloster R-Spec is pretty much the most fun you can have in a car less than $24,000. At that price (and even at a few grand above, I’d suggest), it’s one of the most enjoyable drives there is, with excellent balance, steering and a real peach of an engine.\n\nRelated: Is the 2019 Hyundai Veloster the Most Fun You Can Have for $24,000?\n\nBut what if you have $30,000 to spend? At that price, Hyundai is happy to offer you the Veloster N, the higher-performance sibling to the Veloster R-Spec that comes with a bit more of everything — more engine, a more sophisticated suspension and more styling flair. The question is: Does that translate to enough added smiles to offset the price difference?\n\nWhat the N Adds\n\nThe Veloster N has a more aggressive wing and a unique front fascia with venting designed to help cool the front brakes, but its changes are much more than skin-deep. It adds a comprehensive set of performance upgrades over the R-Spec, starting with its engine: Under the hood, the Veloster N gets a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that cranks out 250 horsepower and 260 pounds-feet of torque (versus the R-Spec’s 201 hp and 195 pounds-feet). That horsepower figure jumps up to 275 with the available Performance Package. Like the R-Spec, the N is only offered with a short-throw six-speed manual transmission, but the N’s adds downshift rev-matching.\n\nUnderneath the N is an adaptive suspension and an optional electronically controlled limited-slip differential that is also part of the Performance Package. The N also features a more aggressive N driving mode not found on the R-Spec in addition to an N Custom mode that allows the driver to customize the settings for the suspension, steering, engine, rev-matching, differential, stability control and exhaust.\n\nThe Veloster N starts at $27,785, but my test vehicle also came with the Performance Package and that adds $2,100 to the price tag, bringing it to $29,885 (all prices include an $885 destination charge). Beyond the upgraded engine power and differential, the Performance Package also adds larger brakes, 19-inch wheels and a variable exhaust system that adds cracks and burbles to the soundtrack.\n\nThe N Is Really Good\n\nThe N is, much like the R-Spec, an absolute joy to toss around. In normal modes, it comes off as pretty docile; the exhaust is muted and the suspension loosens up nicely to remain comfortable enough in day-to-day driving. But when you click the N button on the steering wheel, the entire car jumps to life. The engine and steering tighten up, the exhaust note loudens and deepens, and the suspension gets very taut.\n\nPower from the engine flows quickly and easily. The Veloster N pulls very hard out of turns, especially for a front-wheel-drive vehicle. The limited-slip differential does a good job up front of allowing the wheels to do double duty, and the rear end of the car gets held in place by the adaptive suspension. The manual transmission, much like the one in the R-Spec, is a joy to operate. It has the right amount of mechanical notchiness so it’s easy to feel where the gates to each gear are, and the throws are short. The rev matching also works quickly and doesn’t get in the way as you rip through the gears.\n\nHyundai also nailed the steering and balance feel on the N; it feels alive underneath you in a way that other cars that also feature adaptive suspensions do not. Those can feel detached from the road, but the N makes you feel more in concert with the car as it pushes faster and faster.\n\nIf I could make one change on the N, it might be the tires. The 19-inch wheels that come as a part of the Performance Package are wrapped in Pirelli P Zero summer tires, but the 18-inch wheels come with Michelin Pilot Super Sports and the R-Spec gets its own set of Michelin Pilot Sport 4 summer tires. On the N, the tires chirped constantly and felt to me like a limiting factor; I had no such problems in the R-Spec (I drove both on similar roads in dry, warm conditions).\n\nIs It Worth It?\n2019 Hyundai Veloster N | Cars.com photos by Brian Wong\n\nTaken on its own, the answer is a resounding yes — the Veloster N is a smile-inducing machine. I loved driving it, and it is significantly cheaper than the rest of its hot-hatch competition like the Honda Civic Type R and Volkswagen Golf R. But the question gets complicated when you factor in the R-Spec, in large part because that car punches so far above its price class. I’d argue that the R-Spec is more of a performance bargain at its $24,000 price tag than the Veloster N is at nearly $30,000.\n\nFurther complicating matters is that I didn’t note that much difference between how the two vehicles accelerated. The N has a big horsepower advantage and is measurably the faster of the two cars, but it doesn’t translate to a different experience on the street. I found the R-Spec’s engine to be just as responsive and feel nearly as quick. This could be a byproduct of the weight difference between the two: The R-Spec is more svelte at 2,833 to 2,921 pounds compared with the N’s 3,036 to 3,106 pounds.\n\nThat’s why I think the R-Spec nudges the N by a nose when it comes to smiles per dollar. The N has a higher performance ceiling, but it’s not one that’s easily touched on the street, and the R-Spec feels like 90 percent of what the N is at 75 percent of the price. Again, though: There is no wrong answer here. Both are exemplary and make it apparent that the road to hot-hatch glory now runs through Hyundai’s garage. At both price points, the Veloster (whether it be the R-Spec or the N) is the one I’d choose among the respective competitors.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The addition of a dual-clutch automatic transmission and newly standard performance features, plus an upgraded interior and additional go-fast goodies, make the 2021 Hyundai Veloster N a hot hatch for everyone.\n\nVersus the competition: Other hatches may be hotter than the Veloster N, but few rival Hyundai’s combination of performance, price and excellent available automatic transmission.\n\nI’m going to spoil the conclusion of this review slightly: I own a 2021 Hyundai Veloster N, which is the high-performance version of Hyundai’s front-wheel-drive Veloster three-door hatchback. (N is to Hyundai as M is to BMW — fitting, because Hyundai hired away the former head of BMW M to lead research and development.) So, yes, I think it’s worth your consideration.\n\nDespite the growing popularity of SUVs (Hyundai is even going to build a Kona N), the Veloster N faces robust competition, including the Honda Civic Si and Type R, the Volkswagen Golf GTI and R, and the Subaru WRX and WRX STi. Prices in this class range from the mid-$20,000s (Civic Si, Golf GTI, Subaru WRX) to north of $40,000 (Civic Type R, Golf R, WRX STi).\n\nThe Veloster N sits in the middle of the pack, with a starting price of $33,245, including destination. Besides dealer accessories, the sole available option is a new-for-2021 eight-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission in place of the standard six-speed manual gearbox, a $1,500 premium. Hyundai makes a point of calling it a wet dual-clutch transmission, likely because dry-clutch-based DCTs don’t have a great reputation.\n\nRelated: 2021 Hyundai Veloster N: Performance Standard, Automatic Optional\n\nIn addition to adding the available automatic transmission, Hyundai made the previously optional Performance Package standard for 2021, making the Veloster N’s standard horsepower figure 275, up from the 2020’s standard 250. Torque is 260 pounds-feet … most of the time. (We’ll get to that.) An electronic limited-slip differential, adjustable exhaust and summer performance tires are also part of the new standard package.\n\nAnother major update for 2021 is a set of manual N sport seats up front. Hyundai says the new seats save 4 pounds of weight, and the seatbacks feature an illuminated N logo. The seats really class up the interior, and the light-up logo is simultaneously incredibly corny and incredibly delightful.\n\nMy Veloster N is a six-speed manual, and I love it. After driving the new DCT version, I’m even more in love with the Veloster N. Here’s why.\n\nAccessibility Matters\n\nOne thing to note about the competitors listed above is that they skew heavily toward manual transmissions. That’s not a complaint; we created an entire holiday to celebrate stick shifts. But it does feel, well … limiting. Honda doesn’t even offer an automatic on either the Civic Si or the Type R. The Subaru WRX STi is also manual-only — and the WRX should be, given how badly Subaru’s continuously variable transmission performs. Volkswagen, at least, has an excellent dual-clutch automatic available for both the Golf GTI and the Golf R.\n\nIf you can’t or don’t want to drive a manual car (it’s never too late to learn!) but do want a relatively affordable performance hatchback, before this year you would have probably been looking at a Volkswagen, or maybe a Mini. Now you have another choice.\n\nPerformance Matters\n\nThe Veloster N’s dual-clutch transmission is great. If you’re simply looking to go as quickly as possible in a Veloster N, it’s the one I’d recommend. It nails upshifts and downshifts, and it never seemed to put a foot wrong. And rather than just building an automatic that did its job well, Hyundai gave the automatic an extra feature: N Grin Shift. The goofily but aptly named feature — activated by a button placed where the manual’s rev-matching feature goes — engages 20 seconds of turbocharger overboost that increases the engine’s torque output from 260 to 278 pounds-feet while temporarily activating the transmission’s sportiest shift program.\n\nIn a car this size (the DCT Veloster N weighs just 3,247 pounds, 141 more than the manual), that extra torque is noticeable. In the blink of an eye, it takes the Veloster N’s performance from, “Hey, this is really quick” to “Hey, I’m going how fast?” There’s a mandatory cooldown period between uses — which can be frustrating given how intoxicating the feature is — but not exploding your engine is also a good thing. Hyundai also added programming tweaks to the automatic to make for more aggressive driving. It can detect when you floor the accelerator or when you’re (hopefully) track driving and adjusting the shift programming accordingly.\n\nEven without N Grin Shift, straight-line acceleration is impressive. Hyundai estimates the automatic Veloster N will go from 0-60 mph in 5.6 seconds (the manual is rated slightly slower), but that estimate feels conservative. Other outlets have measured the manual at 5.2 seconds from 0-60 and the DCT at an impressive 4.8 seconds. No matter how quickly you get up to speed, the Veloster N sounds wonderful thanks to its newly standard adjustable exhaust system.\n\nThe Veloster N’s EPA-estimated fuel economy ratings are slightly worse for the automatic than for the manual: 20/27/22 mpg city/highway/combined versus the stick’s 22/28/25 mpg. Seems strange given the auto’s two extra gears, but that transmission does come with at least one additional benefit: At highway speeds, the automatic cruises in 8th gear at roughly 2,000-2,200 rpm. In the manual, which has only six forward gears, those same speeds result in revs in the much noisier 2,700-3,000 rpm range. On a longer trip, the automatic’s reduced noise output was most welcome.\n\nThe Veloster N’s fuel economy ratings are on the lower end for the class, it only drinks premium gas and it’s very difficult to drive with efficiency in mind. Fuel economy isn’t likely to be a primary concern for Veloster N buyers, but know that this hatch isn’t going to save you money at the pump.\n\nFor all the praise I’ve given the automatic, I am still happy with my choice of the manual Veloster N. Is it the best manual transmission in the class? Nope; that award probably goes to the Civic Type R, but the Veloster N’s is quite good. The clutch pedal is lighter than I prefer, and the shifter’s throws could be snappier, but after a few months of ownership I’m very pleased with it. And as good as the automatic is, the connection you feel with the car when driving the manual is tough to beat.\n\nThe Rest of the Driving Experience\n\nRide and handling are consistent across both versions of the Veloster N: Handling is impeccable, the ride is atrocious.\n\nLet’s start with ride quality, or rather the lack thereof. Since I bought a Veloster N, I obviously didn’t consider this a deal-breaker, but its ride is harsh — shake your kidneys harsh. Bounce out of your seat over a pothole harsh. Though its shock absorbers are adaptive and computer controlled, the suspension tuning that helps the Veloster N feel like it’s cornering on rails also leads to solid bumps and thumps, and the low-profile tires wrapped around 19-inch wheels don’t have any cushioning to spare. I read a Veloster N forum about aftermarket wheels, and it seemed like everyone was downsizing to 18-inch wheels. I get it; if or when I need a new set of summer tires, I’ll probably do the same.\n\nThe reward for that harsh ride quality, though, is some of the best handling I’ve experienced in a sub-$35,000 car. Cornering is flat; I never feel like I’m close to running out of grip in corners, and the electronic limited-slip differential keeps understeer at bay. One thing the LSD can’t always quite contain is the Veloster N’s ability to spin its front wheels when accelerating from a stop. Hit the go-pedal too hard and you’ll light up the tires, Scooby Doo in place for a moment, then take off.\n\nBetter Interior\n\nThe Veloster N’s interior is improved for 2021, mostly thanks to the new N Light sport seats. Aesthetically, they help break up the once-dreary, mostly black interior, and the Performance Blue seat belts are still there. More importantly, the seats are comfortable and do a good job holding occupants in place against harsh lateral forces. Both the driver and passenger seats are manually adjustable, save for power lumbar adjustment for the driver. I wouldn’t mind a bit more adjustability, especially with the seat’s fore and aft positions. The most ideal seating position I can find feels just a touch too close to the wheel for my liking, but the next notch backward feels too far away.\n\nThe backseat … exists. Like the Civic Type R, there are only two seats in back, with a permanent hard plastic divider bearing cupholders in between. You could fit adults back there for a short trip, but legroom and headroom are lacking. Access is limited, as well, with only a single rear door on the passenger side. The backseat is at least roomy enough to accommodate my 70-pound dog.\n\nInterior quality isn’t great, with lots of hard plastic, because this is still a Veloster at heart. Some higher-quality materials would be welcome, but they would likely drive up the cost, and I’d rather Hyundai focus on honing the Veloster N’s performance. One exception: Veloster Ns in other markets get heated front seats. Gimme, Hyundai.\n\nThe 8-inch touchscreen is easy to use, with crisp graphics and standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. The screen looks to be on the smaller side to me, but that’s mostly because I know Hyundai has larger screens in other vehicles.\n\nThe touchscreen also houses the N Mode performance pages, allowing the driver to adjust things like suspension firmness, traction control, exhaust note and more via a nifty spider graph. These pages also include the launch control and on/off toggles for the automatic transmission’s extra settings.\n\nSafety\n\nThe 2021 Veloster N also adds newly standard advanced safety features, including forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, lane-keeping assist and lane follow assist, blind spot warning and avoidance assist with rear cross-traffic alert, and a driver attention monitor. The safety features are welcome, though the lane-keeping and lane follow assist can sometimes lead to a bit of pinballing from lane edge to lane edge. Neither the manual nor the automatic Veloster N have adaptive cruise control, either, though admittedly that could be difficult to have on a manual car.\n\nThe 2021 Veloster and Veloster N earned top ratings in Insurance Institute for Highway Safety crashworthiness tests, and the N includes the acceptable-rated LED headlights standard. Though it shares the regular Veloster’s top ratings for vehicle-to-vehicle front-crash prevention, the Veloster N hadn’t been evaluated for vehicle-to-pedestrian collision avoidance as of publication. The Veloster N is also awaiting testing by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration as of this writing.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nI Bought a 2021 Hyundai Veloster N\n2020 Most Fun-to-Drive Car of the Year\nEvery Sports Car Needs This Button From the Hyundai Veloster N\n2022 Hyundai Ioniq 5 U.S. Specs Revealed, Included 300-Mile Range\nHyundai’s Kona Gets Racier With 2022 Kona N\nWhich Veloster N Should You Buy?\n\nSince I’ve bought one, obviously you should, too. But which one? Again, it all comes down to what you do or don’t want. Do you want to go as fast as possible? Are you planning on doing serious track driving? Do you just not want a stick shift? Go for the automatic. If you’re willing to sacrifice a little hustle for a more connected and satisfying driving experience, on the other hand, you should pick the manual.\n\nOne last thing to think about when making a purchase decision: How do you want your car to look? I’m not going to wax lyrical about the Veloster N’s “flowing lines” or anything; you can look at the photos yourself. I’ll only say there’s something about hot hatches and kind of out-there styling; just look at the Civic Type R and Mini John Cooper Works GP. At the other end of the spectrum are the buttoned-up stylings of the Volkswagen Golf GTI and Golf R.\n\nThe Veloster once again occupies a nice middle ground when it comes to appearance. Get it in Performance Blue, like I did, and the Racing Red accents that are part of the N’s signature styling really pop (same with the black or white exterior colors). Want more of a sleeper look? Get it in Racing Red, like the automatic we tested, and you’ll have a slightly more conservative appearance overall.\n\nI don’t think you can go wrong with any choice when it comes to the Veloster N, especially given the only choices you really have are transmission and paint color. It’s a delight to drive.\n\nRelated Video: 2019 Hyundai Veloster: First Drive\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
