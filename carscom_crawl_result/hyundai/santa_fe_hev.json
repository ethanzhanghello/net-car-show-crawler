      "expert_review": "The verdict: Hyundai’s new 2021 Santa Fe Hybrid feels softer than the updated gas-only version — particularly compared with that vehicle’s new turbocharged powertrain — but it’s a welcome, fuel-efficient addition to the Santa Fe lineup. \n\nVersus the competition: The Santa Fe Hybrid is a compelling choice in a growing field of larger fuel-efficient SUVs, but its lack of a third row or a more luxurious Calligraphy trim level may hold it back.\n\nIn its previous incarnation, the Hyundai Santa Fe won our mid-size SUV comparison despite its lackluster powertrain. When the South Korean automaker announced updates to the Santa Fe for the 2021 model year, we were excited to see a new turbocharged four-cylinder option that brought significantly more power and torque. But we were perhaps just as excited by the promise of new hybrid and plug-in hybrid versions for shoppers looking for a reasonably priced, fuel-efficient SUV.\n\nI already reviewed the new conventional Santa Fe in its also-new-for-2021 Calligraphy trim level complete with that new turbo four-pot; now it’s time to do the same for the new 2021 Santa Fe Hybrid. (We’re still waiting on the plug-in hybrid version, which should make its debut as a 2022 model.)\n\nRelated: 2021 Hyundai Santa Fe Calligraphy Review: The Rich Get Richer\n\nThe Santa Fe Hybrid faces competition from its Kia Sorento Hybrid cousin and two Toyota hybrid SUVs: the Highlander Hybrid and the Venza, which has been resurrected in hybrid-only form. The Venza may be the Santa Fe Hybrid’s closest competitor given both it and the Santa Fe are exclusively two-row vehicles; the Sorento and Highlander hybrids have three rows of seats. See them compared.\n\nYou can read my review of the updated Santa Fe in the link above; this review will focus mostly on what differs about the Santa Fe Hybrid’s driving experience.\n\nWell Then, How Does It Drive?\n\nThe 2021 Santa Fe Calligraphy I drove was equipped with a turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine rated at 277 horsepower and 311 pounds-feet of torque. That Santa Fe impressed with its sharpness and near-sportiness, but the Santa Fe Hybrid … well, it’s hard to be impressed by placidity, isn’t it? And that’s what you get: a no-fuss, no-frills driving experience.\n\nInstead of making nearly 300 hp, the Santa Fe Hybrid makes 226 system hp with its 1.6-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine, 59-hp electric motor and 1.49-kilowatt-hour battery pack. Where the gas-only Santa Fe uses either an eight-speed automatic transmission or an eight-speed dual-clutch automatic, the Hybrid uses a six-speed automatic. The Hybrid also comes standard with all-wheel drive, while the gas version gets front-wheel drive standard.\n\nThe Hybrid won’t produce any impressive feats of acceleration, but it won’t frustrate, either. Acceleration is brisk enough, and unlike the smaller Tucson Hybrid, there’s not much hesitation when you step firmly on the gas. It doesn’t have a lot of power to give, but what the Santa Fe Hybrid has, it gives willingly.\n\nSome hybrids have issues with awkward braking response, but I didn’t notice a significant difference between the Santa Fe Hybrid and the gas-only version. There’s a bit more sponginess to the pedal feel in the Hybrid, but its regenerative brakes didn’t dampen my driving experience.\n\nNeither did the lack of an electric-only driving mode. Those modes are usually very limited in traditional hybrids anyway, providing minimal gas-free driving. The Santa Fe Hybrid has more traditional driving modes, though they mostly just adjust accelerator response: Eco makes things more sluggish and Sport sharpens things up slightly, but neither makes a big difference.\n\nI didn’t get to take the Santa Fe Hybrid on a lengthy family road trip like I did the Sorento Hybrid, but in my time driving in and around Chicago, I saw fuel-economy readings in the low 30s — impressive for an SUV the Santa Fe’s size. The EPA rated the Santa Fe Hybrid at 36/31/34 mpg city/highway/combined in its less-equipped Blue version, 33/30/32 mpg in better-equipped (and, thus, heavier) trims. That trails the Venza’s 40/37/39 mpg rating, but the Santa Fe is larger, more powerful and significantly roomier than that car — and a few hundred pounds heavier. The gas-only Santa Fe only managed a maximum rating of 25/28/26 mpg.\n\nNot as Nice Inside\n\nWhere the Santa Fe Hybrid comes up short against its gas-only sibling is its interior quality — a place I already had some complaints. The Santa Fe Calligraphy is the top of the gas-only Santa Fe lineup, while the Hybrid’s top trim is a lower trim level, the Limited.\n\nThe Calligraphy has a faux-suede headliner and Nappa leather upholstery that’s nicer than the leather in the Limited. The lack of those nicer materials in the Hybrid we drove made the hard plastic used elsewhere in the cabin stand out even more; it could use an extra bit of sprucing up.\n\nThe rest of the interior is nearly identical between the two Santa Fe versions. There’s still the Palisade-lite angular center console design (and its physical controls), and that console is still wide enough to annoy drivers who enjoy a bit of manspreading while behind the wheel. At least that makes for an equally large storage space below the console, too.\n\nAside from some hybrid-specific details — like a hybrid power meter instead of a tachometer in the digital instrument panel and a few specific pages on the touchscreen — tech remains the same. The 10.25-inch touchscreen has the same clear graphics — and the same quirk of having only wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto (the smaller 8-inch touchscreen has wireless connectivity for both). Even more frustrating: Models with wireless smartphone connectivity don’t have wireless charging, while ones without wireless connectivity do.\n\nSafety\n\nSafety features in the Santa Fe Hybrid mimic the gas-only version, and advanced tech like Hyundai’s blind spot camera system and a Smart Park automated parking system are also available.\n\nAccording to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the 2021 Santa Fe is a 2021 Top Safety Pick, but it falls short of the highest status of Top Safety Pick Plus due to varied headlight ratings (Limited and Calligraphy models get a good rating and thus qualify for the award, while lower trims’ ratings vary by build date). The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gives the Santa Fe Hybrid a five-star rating.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2021 Hyundai Santa Fe Hybrid Puts Premium Price on Being Green\n2021 Hyundai Santa Fe Hybrid and 2022 Santa Fe Plug-In Hybrid Add Efficiency to Updated Santa Fe\nHyundai Santa Fe: Which Should You Buy, 2021 or 2022?\n2022 Hyundai Santa Fe Gets More Aggressive Looking With New XRT Appearance Package\nIs the 2021 Hyundai Santa Fe a Good Car? 5 Pros and 4 Cons\nWhich Santa Fe Is Right for You?\n\nThe Santa Fe Hybrid might cost more than a comparable gas-only Santa Fe, depending on configuration and options, but the gas-only Calligraphy is the most expensive Santa Fe on the market. Including $505 in cosmetic options and a $1,185 destination fee, our test Santa Fe Hybrid had a sticker price of $41,640. That’s slightly less than a comparable gas-only AWD Santa Fe Limited but more than a FWD version. It’s also less expensive than the almost $44,000 Santa Fe Calligraphy we tested earlier in 2021.\n\nThe Hybrid sacrifices a fair amount of towing capacity — it can pull 2,000 pounds, compared with the gas version’s 3,500 pounds — but its fuel efficiency, standard AWD and roughly comparable price might make it a better choice for buyers who don’t need that extra towing capacity or horsepower. With that in mind, the Santa Fe Hybrid is a great choice for SUV shoppers who don’t need a third row of seats — and it might just be the best all-around Santa Fe for sale.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Hyundai Santa Fe?\n\nThe Santa Fe is a five-seat mid-size SUV that competes with the Ford Edge, Honda Passport and Toyota Venza. There are five trim levels available: SE, SEL, XRT, Limited and Calligraphy.\n\nThe standard engine is a 191-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder that sends power to the front wheels via an eight-speed automatic transmission. All-wheel drive is optional. Upper trims (Limited and Calligraphy) come with a 281-hp, turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder coupled to an eight-speed dual-clutch automatic. Hybrid and plug-in hybrid variants are also available.\n\nThe Hyundai Santa Fe offers 25.3 cubic feet of cargo space behind its backseat, according to Cars.com’s cargo measurements. You can see how it scored in our Car Seat Check here.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Hyundai Santa Fe?\n\nThe 2023 Hyundai Santa Fe rolls into a new model year with only a little reshuffling of features among trims and option packages. For example, a power-operated liftgate, rear sunshades and dual-zone climate control are now standard on SEL and XRT trims.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Hyundai Santa Fe Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nLED automatic headlights\nCloth upholstery\n60/40-split folding and reclining backseat\n8-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nAdaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability\nFour USB ports\n18-inch alloy wheels\nBlind spot warning and rear cross-traffic alert\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nLane keeping assist\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nPower-folding side mirrors\nPanoramic moonroof\nLeather-trimmed seats\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated rear seats\n25-inch touchscreen with navigation\nHarman Kardon premium stereo\nWireless device charging\n360-degree camera system\nHead-up instrument display\n3-inch digital instrument cluster\nShould I Buy the 2023 Hyundai Santa Fe?\n\nThe Santa Fe delivers the passenger and cargo space that car shoppers want in a mid-size SUV. While the standard four-cylinder is fine for routine driving, the turbocharged 2.5-liter engine has notably stronger acceleration, especially during highway passing maneuvers. However, the eight-speed dual-clutch automatic that’s paired with the turbo engine delivered some low-speed jerkiness and awkward shifts during our time with it. In the plus column, having both hybrid and plug-in hybrid models in the range makes the Santa Fe appealing to SUV shoppers who’d like to avoid SUV fuel bills. A long lineup of standard active safety features further boosts the Santa Fe’s credentials.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Hyundai Santa Fe?\n\nThe Hyundai Santa Fe is a mid-size SUV with three rows and seating for six or seven people depending on whether a second-row bench or dual captain’s chairs are chosen. The regular gas-engine Santa Fe is powered by a 277-horsepower, turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine paired with an eight-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. The hybrid version has a turbo 1.6-liter four-cylinder teamed with a single electric motor and a six-speed automatic transmission; this powertrain makes 231 total hp. In either variant, front-wheel drive is standard and all-wheel drive is optional. The Santa Fe’s rivals are plentiful, including the Ford Explorer, Honda Passport and Pilot, Kia Sorento and Toyota Highlander. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Hyundai Santa Fe?\n\nAfter its radical re-imagining for 2024, the Santa Fe rolls into 2025 with no significant changes.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Hyundai Santa Fe Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n12.3-inch infotainment touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nCloth upholstery\nSecond-row bench seat\nFour USB ports\nProximity keyless entry\nHeated side mirrors\nHands-free power liftgate\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking with cyclist and pedestrian detection\nRear cross-traffic alert\nBlind spot warning\nLane departure steering assist\nAdaptive cruise control\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n12.3-inch digital gauge cluster\nWireless charging pad\nFaux leather upholstery\nLeather upholstery\nHeated steering wheel\nHeated front seats\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated second-row seats\nDual-zone climate control\nDigital Key smartphone app access\nDriver attention monitor\nRoof rails\nMoonroof\nVoice recognition\nHigher ride height (XRT model)\nAll-terrain tires (XRT model)\nShould I Buy the 2025 Hyundai Santa Fe?\n\nThe Santa Fe’s hyper-boxy exterior design certainly isn’t for everyone, but the upright body shape pays off in terms of maximizing occupant space and cargo room, and the SUV makes a compelling case for itself far beyond its Lego-like exterior. Even the entry-level trim comes respectably equipped, while the adventure-themed XRT improves towing capacity (4,500 pounds versus 3,500 pounds) and adds a bit of off-road capability thanks to its elevated ride height. The line-topping Calligraphy, meanwhile, is genuinely luxurious and loaded with features. And don’t overlook the Santa Fe Hybrid’s impressive 36 mpg combined EPA rating; it’s a significant improvement over the gas version’s 24 mpg rating. While it’s outstanding in many respects, though, the Santa Fe isn’t perfect: Acceleration is modest, partly because of its hefty 4,300-plus-pound curb weight, and its third row is tight compared with larger three-row SUVs like the Chevrolet Traverse, Toyota Grand Highlander, Volkswagen Atlas and Hyundai’s own Palisade.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2024 Santa Fe’s wild redesign not only makes the SUV stand out in a crowd, it also offers a compelling interior and cargo package sure to entice families of different sizes.\n\nVersus the competition: While some competitors are simply two-row versions of three-row models, the Santa Fe is a wholly unique model.\n\nThe redesigned 2024 Hyundai Santa Fe was certainly a head-scratcher when we first laid eyes on the blocky, over-the-top-styled SUV. It replaced a nondescript yet value-laden mid-size SUV in Hyundai’s lineup, slotting above the compact Tucson and below the three-row Palisade. It was almost as if the Santa Fe were a little kid acting out from lack of attention. After spending a day driving gasoline-only versions of the top-of-the-line Calligraphy and off-road-oriented XRT trims (the gasoline-electric Santa Fe Hybrid wasn’t available at the time of testing), I found this wildly different Santa Fe isn’t just having a hissy fit, and I appreciated the Santa Fe’s drastic departure and all the family-friendly goodness that comes with it. (Per Cars.com’s ethics policy, we pay for all travel and lodging at such manufacturer-sponsored events.)\n\nRelated: Up Close With the 2024 Hyundai Santa Fe: A Radical but Promising Departure\n\nHow Its Shape Affects Cargo and Passenger Room\n\nI say this with the utmost respect: The 2024 Santa Fe has been Ford Flexified. Sure, you may see some styling elements of the Land Rover Defender or Lexus GX in it, but the new Santa Fe’s relatively low ground clearance means it has the low-slung and blocky shape of the Flex, one of our favorite cars made in the past 20 years. The Santa Fe’s squared-off roofline is especially beneficial for space behind the second row both in terms of passenger room (for six or seven occupants) with the now-standard third row and additional cargo room.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nWeekend Home Depot warriors will surely appreciate an expansive cargo opening and low load-in height. The Santa Fe’s cargo opening has been widened by a staggering 5.7 inches, to 50.2 inches, and it’s 2 inches larger from top to bottom, at 32 inches. Hyundai says overall cargo space behind the second row has increased by 4.2 cubic feet to 40.5 cubic feet, but we’ll put the Santa Fe through our own cargo testing regime once we get one at Cars.com headquarters (though I have little doubt that our measurements of the Santa Fe’s cargo area will be any less impressive).\n\nIn practice, the cargo area is easy to use, and I could even crawl into the back with the third row folded and comfortably sit upright to take a quick snack break. While Hyundai would have you believe you could be looking at a picturesque mountainscape from this vantage point, I imagine a more common use could be backing up toward a kids’ soccer or baseball game, popping a squat in the rear cargo area and keeping tabs on the score or your wandering right fielder picking flowers during an at-bat. Either way, the cargo opening is large enough to give a good view out the cargo opening when seated back there.\n\nFor 2024, the Santa Fe comes standard with a third row, and it’s more than a third row in name only like a Tesla Model Y or the former Lexus RX 350L. The Santa Fe’s third row is usable for a 6-foot-tall adult such as myself thanks to the generous rear headroom afforded by the squared-off shape, though the low seating position significantly raised my knees. Perhaps more important, the third row has proper attachment points for child-safety seats with lower Latch connectors and top tether anchors in both seats, a pairing missing from the Lexus GX’s third row.\n\n2024 Hyundai Santa Fe | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nThe most annoying aspect of the Santa Fe’s newfound versatility is the power-folding second-row captain’s chairs on the top Calligraphy trim level, which have power-adjustment controls like the front seats. Unfortunately, it’s slow and cumbersome to fold the seats to maximize cargo space from the rear doors or to simply gain third-row access because the power seatback moves slowly. On all other trim levels, the split-folding bench seats recline manually, which is a much quicker and expected operation to achieve maximum cargo versatility and third-row access, though you do lose the power-folding controls in the cargo area.\n\nInterior Gadgets\n\nThe Santa Fe’s interior has similarly different styling and function to the exterior, working to similar effect with many features that maximize cabin storage space and versatility. One of my favorites is the center console storage, which has a removable insert for extra depth, as well as a dual-opening lid that’s openable from the front or back, allowing second-row passengers access.\n\n2024 Hyundai Santa Fe | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nA storage container pops out from the rear of the console, too, and can be used as a small trash can, which I’m excited about knowing all of the wrappers, little toys and miscellaneous junk that ends up on the floor of my family car when driving anywhere with the kids. There’s even more storage, too: The area under the center console is open for more cargo carrying because the gear selector is mounted on the steering-wheel column instead of the console, opening up space above and below the console. A device ledge on the front passenger side complements the other storage space well, making it easy to place items like a phone or key out of the way.\n\nSpeaking of devices, the Santa Fe’s standard 12.3-inch touchscreen includes wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, correcting a long-standing issue that omitted those features from Hyundai’s top-level screen. The Santa Fe’s screen and digital instrument panel combine in a slick uniform curve that looks like it belongs in a luxury car.\n\nThe Calligraphy trim also has a unique sanitizing compartment that uses ultraviolet light to clean 99.9% of germs on the outside of the object, according to Hyundai. While it’s difficult to verify this claim, it’s a thoughtful feature that came about when the car was designed during peak COVID-19 precautions — and even if you don’t need anything sanitized, the compartment adds another layer of storage inside the cabin.\n\n2024 Hyundai Santa Fe | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\nHow It Drives On- and Off-Road\n\nYou may be wondering why this “first drive” has driving impressions near the bottom; that’s because you won’t find a whole lot to talk about regarding how the new Santa Fe drives, which is more of a compliment than it seems. The standard turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine and eight-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission are competent without complaints, but it’s not a surprisingly quick and fun-to-drive car like the three-row Kia Sorento with a similar engine and transmission. Perhaps that’s because the Santa Fe’s 277 horsepower and 311 pounds-feet of torque are saddled with pulling a fairly heavy SUV; its base curb weight of 4,343 pounds with front-wheel drive is more than the base weight of a Palisade, nearly 700 pounds heavier than the outgoing Santa Fe and 549 pounds heavier than a Sorento. All-wheel-drive Santa Fes are even heavier.\n\n2024 Hyundai Santa Fe | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nThis extra weight, combined with a more powerful engine, is reflected in the Santa Fe’s fuel economy, which at 24 mpg with FWD and 23 mpg combined for with AWD (22 mpg for XRT) is only slightly better than the Palisade’s 22 mpg with FWD and 21 mpg with AWD and worse than the outgoing turbocharged Santa Fe’s 26 mpg with FWD and 24 mpg with AWD. A Santa Fe hybrid will be available in the spring with significantly improved fuel economy of 36 mpg with FWD and 34 mpg with AWD.\n\nTwo driving characteristics stood out: The Santa Fe drives like a much larger, beefier car; it’s more solid and weightier than you’d expect from a tweener SUV that’s not as long as a Palisade and not as short as a Tucson. A lot of that came from its squared-off hood, tall windshield and windows that give great visibility, but its heft might also have an impact here.\n\nThe biggest surprise was the Santa Fe’s ride quality because Hyundais with big wheels typically don’t ride that well; the Palisade has jitteriness with the larger wheel options, for example. That’s not the case in the Santa Fe; even with 21-inch wheels, the Calligraphy showed composure and smoothness on-road. Now, I qualify that by saying my time with the Santa Fe was on smooth Tennessee roads, and I’ll reserve final judgment for when we drive a Santa Fe back home in the Chicago area with less-than-ideal roads.\n\nThe Santa Fe XRT trim level is more aggressive than Hyundai’s other off-road offerings, with a raised ride height from suspension changes and larger-diameter all-terrain tires. I’ll say that the difference between driving the off-road XRT and Calligraphy over the same gravel road was stark; the 18-inch wheels, all-terrain tires and suspension on the XRT glided over a gravely path, while the Calligraphy was extremely busy and disturbed over the same terrain. On an off-road path up and down a steep hill, the XRT did the job without incident. More than its off-road proficiency, driving the Santa Fe over rocky and rutted terrain showed how solidly the Santa Fe is put together, with no creaks, groans or squeaks from the suspension or body.\n\n2024 Hyundai Santa Fe | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2024 Hyundai Santa Fe: New Looks Outside and Inside, Carryover Powertrains\nUp Close With the 2024 Hyundai Santa Fe: A Radical but Promising Departure\n2024 Hyundai Santa Fe Unveiled, Gets Extreme Makeover\nResearch the Hyundai Santa Fe\nIs the Santa Fe Worth It?\n\nPlacing a value on the Santa Fe is really interesting because while there is overlap between the Palisade in many trim levels, I actually think it rivals the Palisade’s interior quality in the top Calligraphy trim level and by extension is significantly higher-quality than many options in a class that include the Honda Passport, Volkswagen Atlas Cross Sport, Toyota Highlander and Subaru Outback. The Santa Fe starts at $35,345 (all prices include destination), which is about in the middle of competitors, and offers some surprising standard features, including front and rear parking sensors, a power tailgate with kick-to-open access, plus the standard third row and turbocharged engine.\n\nAt an as-tested $50,375, the Santa Fe Calligraphy is more expensive than many rivals’ top trims, though the Santa Fe also offers a unique combination of utility, quality and family-friendliness along with Hyundai’s staple of features and warranty for the money. The bulk of what I liked about the Santa Fe, however, comes in more affordable trim levels, including the overall shape and flexibility that it presents for people and cargo (up front and in back). As a family car, the Santa Fe might be one of the most exciting considerations in recent years for those who like the way it looks — and even if you don’t, because it’s that good.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Key Points\nThe Hyundai Santa Fe gets additional standard safety equipment for the 2026 model year, as well as a new transmission for the gas-only powertrain.\nPriced from $36,400 (all prices include $1,600 destination charge)\nAffordable hybrid upgrade available\n\nRolling into the third model year since its boxy reimagining, the Hyundai Santa Fe gets myriad minor upgrades for the 2026 model year — plus one big one that buyers are unlikely to notice. The latter is a new automatic transmission that replaces the dual-clutch automatic unit in gas-only models; it still has eight speeds. Likely a bigger draw for most customers, the upgraded forward collision warning tech that was previously only included on upper trim levels is now standard across the line. The 2026 Hyundai Santa Fe starts at $36,400.\n\nRelated: 2024 Hyundai Santa Fe Review: Don’t Knock It Till You Try It\n\nShoppers considering a more luxurious Santa Fe now get standard second-row captain’s chairs in the Limited (a bench is available for those who need as many seat belts as possible), and there’s a new Peach Brown Nappa leather option for the range-topping Calligraphy trim. The adventure-oriented Santa Fe XRT now gets Terrain Mode with Mud, Snow and Sand settings to optimize traction on various off-road surfaces, and the SEL and XRT now come with USB ports for the third row.\n\nRelease Date and Pricing\n\nThe 2026 Hyundai Santa Fe is on sale now. Full pricing is as follows:\n\nSanta Fe\nSE: $36,400\nSEL: $38,940\nXRT: $43,390\nLimited: $45,950\nCalligraphy: $48,950\nSanta Fe Hybrid\nSE: $37,750\nSEL: $40,040\nLimited: $47,050\nCalligraphy: $50,050\nTrim Levels\n\nOther than their powertrains, there are no differences in the gas-only and hybrid Santa Fes. The SE rides on 18-inch wheels and features keyless entry and start, LED exterior lighting, heated side mirrors and a hands-free power liftgate. Its seats are upholstered in fabric and manually adjustable up front, but the SE does have a standard 12.3-inch touchscreen with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.\n\nStandard safety technologies on every 2026 Santa Fe include forward collision warning with pedestrian and bicyclist detection, automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, lane departure steering assist, lane-centering steering, front and rear cross-traffic alert, front and rear parking sensors, a driver attention monitor and blind spot monitors.\n\nOne step up, the SEL adds synthetic leather upholstery, a power-adjustable driver’s seat, heated front seats, a wireless phone charger and Hyundai’s Digital Key 2, which allows the owner to use a paired smartphone or smartwatch as a key and to remotely monitor the vehicle.\n\nOnly available on the gas-only Santa Fe, the XRT is lifted 1.3 inches and rides on dark-gray 18-inch wheels with all-terrain tires. It also features a moonroof, black exterior trim, navigation and a second wireless charger.\n\nThe Limited adds 20-inch wheels, dual moonroofs and rain-sensing windshield wipers. Its cabin is upgraded with leather seating, a power-adjustable passenger seat, ventilated front seats, a heated steering wheel, heated second-row captain’s chairs, ambient lighting, rear window shades, a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster and a 12-speaker Bose audio system. The Limited also adds a 360-degree camera system, blind spot cameras, side parking sensors and automated parking.\n\nTopping the Santa Fe lineup, the Calligraphy boasts 21-inch wheels, upgraded exterior and interior trim, quilted Nappa leather upholstery, an upgraded driver’s seat, a head-up display and a digital rearview mirror that gives the driver a clear view aft even if their line of sight is obstructed by passengers or cargo. The Calligraphy also gets more standard safety equipment, including an upgraded forward collision warning system, blind spot intervention, and Highway Driving Assist 2, which combines the adaptive cruise control and lane-centering functions for hands-on semi-autonomous highway driving.\n\nRead More About the Hyundai Santa Fe:\n\nIs the 2024 Hyundai Santa Fe a Good SUV? 6 Pros, 2 Cons\nBest Car of 2025\nWhich Hybrid Vehicles Have All-Wheel Drive?\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2025 Hyundai Santa Fe?\nWhat Are the Best 2025 Hybrids for the Money?\nPowertrain Specs and MPG\n\nThe gas-only 2026 Santa Fe is powered by a 277-horsepower, turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine making 311 pounds-feet of torque; it’s mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission. Hybrids get a turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder that, with the help of an electric motor, generates a total of 231 hp and 271 pounds-feet of torque; the hybrid routes its power through a six-speed automatic. Front-wheel drive is standard with either powertrain on all trim levels; all-wheel drive is standard on the XRT and available for $1,800 for the rest of the lineup.\n\nThe gas-only Santa Fe returns an EPA-rated 20/29/24 mpg city/highway/combined with FWD and 20/28/23 mpg with AWD. With its taller ride height and all-terrain tires, the XRT is rated at 19/25/21 mpg. The hybrid powertrain returns 37/36/36 mpg with FWD and 35/34/34 mpg with AWD.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
