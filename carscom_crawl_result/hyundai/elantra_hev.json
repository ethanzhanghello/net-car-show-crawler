      "expert_review": "The verdict: The redesigned 2021 Hyundai Elantra compact sedan would be excellent rather than good if not for its lackluster cabin materials. If developing a car was a marathon, Hyundai didn’t run the last mile.\n\nVersus the competition: For a mass-market compact sedan, the Elantra combines class-leading drivability with loads of user-friendly technology. Alas, its low-rent interior weighs all that down.\n\nFor 2021, the Hyundai Elantra sedan comes in SE, SEL and Limited trim levels, all with a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine. (The Elantra GT hatchback has been discontinued.) The first-ever Elantra Hybrid, meanwhile, pairs a smaller four-cylinder with electric assist; it comes in SEL and Limited trims. Finally, the Elantra N Line has a turbocharged four-cylinder and the lineup’s only manual transmission. (Note that a higher-performance Elantra, called simply the N, without the “Line,” remains in the works as of this writing.) All other variants have an automatic, which is also available on the N Line. Stack up the whole current group, or compare the 2020 and 2021 Elantra.\n\nRelated: Redesigned 2021 Hyundai Elantra Starts at $20,645; Here’s What You Get\n\nWe evaluated an SEL over the course of a week and also took brief drives in the Limited Hybrid and a stick-shift N Line. \n\nSE, SEL, Limited: Refined Drivability\n\nA confounding but age-old reality in our recent comparison between the Honda Civic, Nissan Sentra and Toyota Corolla sedans was the trade-off between ride quality and handling chops. Hyundai elevates both better than any car in that trio, as well as most other compact sedans. \n\nDespite a torsion-beam rear axle — a cost-saving setup versus the independent rear suspensions used by some rivals, including the Civic and Corolla — the Elantra rides impressively. Aside from some skittishness during mid-corner bumps, body control feels impressive for a mass-market compact sedan. Ditto for shock absorption: The suspension takes sewer covers and rutted pavement with a degree of sophistication reminiscent of a larger, or pricier, car — and that’s with our SEL model’s optional 17-inch wheels and P225/45R17 tires. With available wheel diameters ranging from 15 to 18 inches, it’s possible lesser versions of the Elantra ride even more comfortably. (All other things being equal, larger wheels generally diminish ride quality.)\n\nKudos, too, for the Elantra’s reflexes. Fling it into a corner and the nose pushes early, but the steering feels as quick-ratio as the Civic’s — still one of the best-handling cars in the class — with less of the outgoing Elantra’s vagueness. The wheel seldom feels twitchy on center even at higher speeds, and body roll is nicely contained through sweeping curves.\n\nUnder the hood is last year’s 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (147 horsepower, 132 pounds-feet of torque), which runs on a more-efficient Atkinson cycle; gone is the prior generation’s Eco trim and its turbocharged 1.4-liter four-cylinder. The 2.0-liter has reasonable power past 3,000 rpm or so, and Hyundai’s continuously variable automatic transmission is a motivated partner to get you there. Revs climb energetically from a stop, and if you need more power while already in motion, the CVT kicks up engine rpm swiftly enough to mimic a downshift from a conventional automatic. The 2021 Elantra is not particularly quick, but it does a nice job with what it has to offer.\n\nElantra Hybrid: Even Better\n\nThe Elantra Hybrid pairs a 1.6-liter Atkinson four-cylinder with a 32-kilowatt electric motor for a total system output of 139 hp and 195 pounds-feet of torque. It’s a handy combination, particularly on the torque side, to move you out from a stop. Unlike the many hybrids that employ CVT-like power-split devices, Hyundai’s system uses a conventional stepped automatic transmission — in this case a six-speed dual-clutch unit. The stepped gears bring a welcome sensation of upshifts and downshifts, though the downshifts arrive only after a long delay or hard stab on the gas. Sport mode provides much-needed accelerator responsiveness — there’s your downshift — if you don’t mind sacrificing fuel efficiency.\n\nThat efficiency is considerable, with 50 mpg in EPA-estimated combined gas mileage (54 mpg in a higher-efficiency Elantra Hybrid Blue edition). That’s up some 40% over the Elantra’s still-impressive EPA 35 mpg combined (37 mpg for the SE trim). Both figures are competitive against respective rivals; compare Elantra Hybrid mileage or the regular Elantra’s.\n\nThe Elantra Hybrid gets an independent rear suspension versus the non-hybrid’s torsion beam, but the differences are hard to pick out. I drove the Elantra Hybrid Limited back to back with an Elantra SEL, both with 17-inch wheels, over the same route. Both cars rode similarly well — more of a feat for the SEL’s simpler hardware, perhaps, but we preach results over formula. The results speak for themselves.\n\nElantra N Line: A Minor Letdown\n\nIf there’s any disappointment in how the Elantra drives, it comes with the N Line. Like the Elantra Hybrid, it gets an independent rear suspension, but tuning is stiffer all around versus the regular Elantra, with a thicker front stabilizer bar, as well. It shows: Shock absorption is notably firmer — though not objectionably so, as was the case with its Elantra Sport predecessor. The steering, altered here for N Line duty, augments the regular Elantra’s quick ratio with better feedback. Whether through chassis tuning or better grip (our test car had Goodyear Eagle F1 summer tires), or a little of both, understeer feels immediately better contained.\n\nSo where’s the letdown? It’s all in the N Line’s powertrain. The N Line packs Hyundai’s turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder (201 hp, 195 pounds-feet of torque), an engine we’ve seldom found responsive enough. Hyundai says peak torque comes as early as 1,500 rpm, but it’s only after notable turbo lag. The lag diminishes if you keep engine revs north of 4,000 rpm or so, which requires frequent work with the stick-shift N Line’s longish throws and muddy gates. Even then, the N Line never feels particularly quick. The optional automatic transmission is a seven-speed dual-clutch unit, so it might alter some of the power delivery. Alas, we didn’t evaluate it.\n\nTech Features\n\nSE, SEL and N Line models have two USB ports, HD radio and an 8-inch touchscreen with adjacent physical controls, including the must-have volume and tuning knobs. Impressively, the standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto both have wireless integration. Wireless phone charging — critical if you really want to go cord-free, as wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto can drain your phone’s battery fast — is optional, as are all-digital gauges.\n\nThe Limited trim comes with wireless charging and swaps the 8-inch screen for a 10.25-inch touchscreen. It’s a slick, high-resolution display, but it introduces some annoyances. Gone is the tuning knob, and both Apple CarPlay and Android Auto revert to a wired setup. What’s more, the larger display has a widescreen ratio that’s starved for height, so items like the backup camera image appear only on part of the screen. The navigation map and Apple CarPlay leverage the entire display, but I didn’t test Android Auto (I’m an iPhone user). Cars.com staffers with Android devices have observed display limitations in other Hyundai models with the automaker’s 10.25-inch display. See for yourself on a test drive.\n\nThe Fatal Flaw?\n\nFor all the Elantra’s strengths, the obvious flaw comes inside. It’s not space: The low center console affords a wide berth for the driver, and backseat knee clearance should suit adult passengers. Our independent accounting of cargo space found 19 cubic feet in the Elantra’s trunk, within 1 cubic foot of our accounting in the Civic, Corolla and Sentra.\n\nHyundai’s problem is materials quality. Even in the Limited trim, the upper doors, where your arms and elbows might rest, are all cheap hard plastic, as are most areas your knees touch. Things decline even further in the backseat, where the dollar-store treatment extends to the door armrests. The glove box opens with an undamped clatter; the headliner is mouse fur.\n\nAll of that falls in line with the prior-generation Elantra, no standout for cabin materials itself. But if you haven’t been in other compact cars, you’re missing out. The Civic and Impreza have a proper woven headliner. The Sentra offers soft-touch materials where your knees land, and almost all rivals have soft-touch door materials up front, especially in higher trim levels. The Mazda3 keeps it classy front and rear.\n\nThere’s potential to right the ship immediately. All major controls feel uniformly meticulous, unlike rivals like the Corolla. All Hyundai would have to do is swap in better materials immediately for a modest cost per car. Of course, the bean counters will multiply that by the hundreds of thousands of cars the automaker hopes to sell. You know how that ends.\n\nFeatures and Value\n\nAs of this writing, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has yet to publish crash-test results for the 2021 Elantra, but once the agency does, those results will appear here. Standard safety and driver-assist features include automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, a blind spot warning system and lane-centering steering.\n\nThe Elantra SE starts just under $21,000 (all prices include destination). That’s roughly competitive with rivals’ base models, most of which have standard automatic transmissions, as well. Standard features include 15-inch alloy wheels, the 8-inch touchscreen with wireless phone integration and the aforementioned safety tech. Finding an SE might be hard, however: As of this writing, just 12% of new 2021 Elantra sedans on Cars.com are SE models, and that’s with the Elantra Hybrid and N Line not yet on sale. Their eventual arrival will consign the SE to an even smaller slice of the pie.\n\nThe vast majority of current inventory is the next-up Elantra SEL (about $22,000), which adds larger wheels, dual-zone automatic climate control and keyless access with push-button start. Add options or climb the trim levels, and you can get leather upholstery, a power driver’s seat with memory, heated and ventilated front seats, the larger touchscreen, Bose premium audio, adaptive cruise control and Highway Driving Assist. (HDA augments Hyundai’s standard lane-centering, called Lane Following Assist, with additional capabilities on designated highways. Read more about the differences.)\n\nThe N Line runs about $25,000, while the well-equipped Limited (around $26,500) doesn’t have any factory options. The Elantra Hybrid, meanwhile, exacts a $2,650 premium for its SEL and Limited trims versus the same non-hybrid examples. As such, expect an Elantra Hybrid Limited to set you back about $29,000 — likely the highest sticker price most shoppers will see on any Elantra. That’s still a decent value, especially considering Hyundai’s impressive warranty and three years’ free maintenance.\n\nValue might drive many shoppers toward the Elantra, and excellent drivability should justify consideration even among the less budget-conscious. The downfall comes with Hyundai’s lack of investment inside, a peskiness that leaves the Elantra at four-fifths of great.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2022 Hyundai Elantra?\n\nRedesigned last year, the Hyundai Elantra is a budget-friendly compact sedan that’s available with a choice of three engines: A 147-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder is standard, working with a continuously variable automatic transmission. The sportier N Line trim gets a 201-hp, turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder that pairs with a six-speed manual or seven-speed dual-clutch automatic. The fuel-sipping Elantra Hybrid is powered by a gas-electric hybrid drivetrain rated at 139 hp; it uses a six-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. Elantra rivals include the Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla and Nissan Sentra.\n\nThe Elantra offers 19 cubic feet of cargo space, according to Cars.com’s cargo measurements. You can see how it scored in our Car Seat Check here.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2022 Hyundai Elantra?\n\nApart from the addition of the high-performance Elantra N, there are no significant changes this year. \n\nWhat Features in the 2022 Hyundai Elantra Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nCloth upholstery\n8-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nCruise control\nAutomatic emergency braking\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nLane keep assist\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nLED headlights and taillights\nPower moonroof\nLeather-trimmed seats\nHeated and ventilated front seats\n10.25-inch touchscreen\nNavigation\nWireless device charging\nDual-zone automatic air conditioning\nDigital instrument panel\nAdaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability\nShould I Buy the 2022 Hyundai Elantra?\n\nThe Elantra’s sharply creased, aggressive exterior styling is eye-catching, but there’s a lot of substance here, too. Ride quality and handling are good, and the base 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine is refined. The hybrid model, meanwhile, offers impressive EPA-estimated gas mileage of up to 54 mpg combined. The biggest drawbacks are the Elantra’s low-grade interior materials and powertrain lag in the N Line version.",

A 147-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder is standard, coupled with a continuously variable automatic transmission. The Elantra Hybrid is motivated by a gas-electric hybrid drivetrain rated at 139 hp and employs a six-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. The performance-themed N Line has a 201-hp, turbo 1.6-liter four-cylinder that’s coupled with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic, and for high-performance enthusiasts, the racy Elantra N gets a 276-hp, turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder (with a choice of six-speed manual or eight-speed dual-clutch automatic transmissions) and a track-tuned chassis.\n\nThe Elantra offers 19 cubic feet of cargo space, according to Cars.com’s cargo measurements. You can see how it scored in our Car Seat Check here. Direct rivals include the Honda Civic, Kia Forte and Toyota Corolla.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Hyundai Elantra?\n\nFor 2023, the Elantra’s SEL Convenience Package adds 17-inch alloy wheels and a 10.3-inch digital gauge display, and — performance fans take note — the N Line is no longer offered with a manual transmission; that’s only available with the top-trim N variant.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Hyundai Elantra Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n8-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nCruise control\nTwo USB ports\nKeyless entry\nAutomatic emergency braking\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nLane departure steering assist\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nLED headlights and taillights\nPower moonroof\nLeather-trimmed seats\nHeated and ventilated front seats\n10.25-inch touchscreen\nNavigation\nWireless device charging\nDual-zone automatic climate control\nDigital instrument panel\nAdaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability\nShould I Buy the 2023 Hyundai Elantra?\n\nThe Elantra is a solid value with an eye-catching exterior you wouldn’t expect in a budget-minded compact sedan. Ride quality is good, and the Elantra’s handling makes it nimble in city traffic. The standard 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine delivers decent pep and refinement. If limiting your use of fuel is a priority, know that the Elantra Hybrid delivers an EPA-estimated 54 mpg in combined city and highway driving. What’s not to like? There are some noticeable penny-pinching materials in the Elantra’s cabin, plus some powertrain lag from the turbo engine in the sportier N Line trim.",

      "expert_review": "The Hyundai Elantra is one of the fresher compact sedans on the market, and it gets a bit fresher for 2024 thanks to a mild … uh, freshening that consists of a styling face-lift, interior revisions and additional safety equipment. The current-generation Elantra debuted for the 2021 model year, and among its mainstream-brand rivals, only the Honda Civic (which was redesigned for 2022) and Subaru Impreza (redesigned as a hatchback-only model for 2024) boast newer designs. I took a brief drive in an Elantra Hybrid Limited during the Midwest Automotive Media Association’s 2024 Spring Rally in Elkhart Lake, Wis., to sample the 2024 updates.\n\nRelated: 2024 Hyundai Elantra Gets Safer, Sleeker\n\nOutside of the high-performance N variant, the Elantra Hybrid Limited is the priciest model in the sedan-only Elantra roster. It starts at $30,600 (all prices include destination), and that’s more or less fully loaded. The only extra-cost options are Serenity White paint ($470) and accessory items such as splash guards and a trunk cargo net. The sole option on my test car was a $210 set of carpeted floormats that nudged the price to $30,810.\n\nA Softer Touch\n\nAs detailed in our 2021 Elantra review, one of our primary gripes with the model-year 2021-23 Elantra is its so-so interior materials. The updates for 2024 don’t suddenly turn the Elantra into a class leader in cabin ambiance, but they are definitely a step in the right direction. The front door panels have some soft-touch surfaces that were previously hard plastic. The upper portion of the panels is still hard plastic, and the new soft-touch surfaces are still not super cushy, but they’re better than they were before. The Limited trim’s new synthetic leather upholstery looks and feels quite nice, and on my test vehicle, it was accented by heather-gray cloth accents on the door panels and front seatbacks that added some texture and visual interest.\n\nAs before, the fully digital gauge cluster and integrated 10.25-inch infotainment touchscreen also add to the upmarket feel (the latter is now standard on SEL trims and above). The sleek, one-piece look of the instrument panel and infotainment screen makes the Elantra’s dashboard look futuristic, even if the section to the left of the steering wheel is still an odd blank space that serves no function other than to visually balance the gauge cluster, I guess?\n\nTech Updates\n\nLimiteds now come standard with an eight-speaker Bose audio system in place of the base six-speaker system, and Hyundai has also improved the Elantra’s ability to accommodate devices. The available wireless charging pad has been redesigned, Wi-Fi hot spot capability has been added, and the front USB-A data/charging port has been supplemented by a USB-C charging port. The previously neglected backseat passengers get a pair of USB-C charging ports on all but the base SE trim.\n\nSadly, you’ll still need to use that USB-A data port for Apple CarPlay or Android Auto connectivity with the uplevel trims’ 10.25-inch infotainment screen; annoyingly, this system doesn’t offer wireless Apple CarPlay or Android Auto connectivity, even though the Elantra’s base infotainment system does. Some newer Hyundais, such as the redesigned 2024 Santa Fe, finally get that functionality on their top-level screens, but the 2024 Elantra hasn’t been so blessed.\n\nNevertheless, the Elantra Limited gets some welcome new tech and convenience features, some of which are rare for the compact-car class, as standard equipment. Hyundai’s Digital Key 2 feature allows you to use your smartphone as a key, and a 360-degree camera system, blind spot cameras, and front and rear parking sensors expand the roster of safety equipment. Unfortunately, the Elantra Hybrid Limited only gets the Digital Key and parking sensors, and not the 360-degree camera and blind spot camera display. Even though the Elantra isn’t a big, unwieldy vehicle, I like having the added peace of mind of a surround-view camera when parking or backing up in close quarters and a blind spot camera view when changing lanes or turning, and Hyundai’s systems work well in other vehicles we’ve tested with them.\n\nAll 2024 Elantras get standard rear-seat side-impact airbags and a rear seat belt reminder, and steering-wheel haptic feedback has been added to the lane departure steering assist, blind spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert systems. The haptic feedback is a big plus in my book; I’d much rather have a smartphone-style vibration through the steering wheel than shrill warning chimes when those alerts are triggered.\n\nSharp Styling Updates\n\nFrankly, the Elantra’s origami-style bodywork is a bit much for me. Those sharply creased, Z-shaped slashes on the body sides make me imagine that Zorro somehow swashbuckled his way into Hyundai’s styling studio and went to town on the clay model, but the 2024 face-lift is an improvement. The front-end design is all-new, including the front fenders, and its “shark-nose” design gives the Elantra a slightly more aggressive look. The slim daytime running lights blend into a horizontal strip of aluminum trim for a slick, full-width look; this treatment stylistically syncs up the Elantra with Hyundai’s new Kona subcompact SUV and similarly refreshed-for-2024 Sonata mid-size sedan.\n\nPowertrains Hold the Line\n\nThe Elantra’s powertrains carry over with no changes, but the hybrid variant’s powertrain continues to satisfy with its decent power and generally smooth operation. The 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine is paired with a 32-kilowatt electric motor for a total system output of 139 horsepower and 195 pounds-feet of torque. The acceleration is never thrilling, but it’s almost always enough, and the six-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission is nicely tuned; it exhibits none of the occasional bogging-and-surging feel or clunkiness in low-speed driving that plague some dual-clutch transmissions. Kickdowns for extra passing power are prompt and smooth, and the transitions from gas to electric power are also smooth, almost to the point of being undetectable. Likewise, the Elantra Hybrid is dynamically unobjectionable, with a pleasant ride, predictable handling and adroitly balanced steering with a buttery-yet-responsive feel.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2024 Hyundai Elantra Up Close: Hey, We’ve Seen This One\nUpdated 2024 Hyundai Elantra Starts at $22,590\n2024 Hyundai Tucson, Elantra Awarded IIHS Top Safety Pick+\nWhat Are the Best 2024 Hybrids for the Money?\nShop for a 2024 Hyundai Elantra Hybrid\nVersus the Competition\n\nThe Elantra’s competitors aren’t standing still, of course — a radically styled new Kia compact sedan named K4 is set to replace the Forte for 2025, and Volkswagen just unveiled its refreshed-for-2025 Jetta, to name a couple. Neither of those will offer a hybrid powertrain, however. Curiously, given the general proliferation of hybrid powertrains in recent years, they remain rather rare in the mainstream compact-car category. Outside of the Toyota Prius, which is really in a category by itself due to its radical 2023 redesign, the only other compact cars that offer a hybrid powertrain at the moment are the Toyota Corolla and the just-launched 2025 Honda Civic Hybrid.\n\nI didn’t have a chance to measure fuel economy on my short drive, but Cars.com will soon publish real-world fuel economy results for this Elantra Hybrid and a Corolla Hybrid SE with all-wheel drive, so stay tuned for that. The Elantra Hybrid Limited’s EPA ratings of 49/52/50 mpg city/highway/combined are comparable with the Corolla Hybrid’s LE and XLE trims’ rating of 53/46/50 mpg. The Elantra Hybrid is also available in an entry-level Blue trim that boasts an EPA estimate of 51/58/54 mpg.\n\nHowever, the Corolla Hybrid can be had with AWD, as previously mentioned, while the Elantra Hybrid is front-wheel drive only, and the arrival of the 2025 Civic Hybrid changes the competitive-set math even more. The Civic Hybrid’s EPA ratings (50/47/49 mpg) are right in the wheelhouse with the Elantra and Corolla hybrids, but it also packs 200 hp, handily outclassing the Hyundai and Toyota (the Corolla Hybrid makes 138 hp total). The new Civic Hybrid feels as zippy as its horsepower rating suggests, and it also has a Linear Shift Control feature that mimics the sound of a sporty automatic transmission crisply shifting gears. The Elantra Hybrid feels a bit staid by comparison.\n\nThe catch is that the Civic Hybrid is significantly pricier across the board — the top-line Sport Touring trim starts at $32,845, about $2,200 more than the Elantra Hybrid Limited and $4,500 more than the FWD Corolla Hybrid XLE, which starts at $28,345 but isn’t as well equipped as the Elantra.\n\nWith that in mind, the Elantra Hybrid Limited might be the ideal choice if you’re shopping for a fuel-sipping compact car and can live without the Civic’s spicier acceleration or the Corolla’s available AWD.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Hyundai Elantra?\n\nThe Hyundai Elantra is a value-conscious compact sedan available with a choice of four engines. A 147-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder is standard, coupled with a continuously variable automatic transmission. The performance-themed N Line uses a 201-hp, turbo 1.6-liter four-cylinder that’s paired to a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic. The Elantra Hybrid is powered by a 1.6-liter four-cylinder hybrid powertrain that’s rated at 139 hp total and employs a six-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. For high-performance enthusiasts, the racy Elantra N gets a 276-hp, turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder with a choice of a six-speed manual or eight-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. That model also has a track-tuned suspension and unique trim touches. \n\nCabin space is plentiful for the class, and the Elantra Hybrid has an excellent 20.0 cubic feet of cargo space, according to Cars.com’s cargo measurements. The Elantra’s rivals include the Honda Civic, Kia K4, Nissan Sentra, Subaru Impreza and Toyota Corolla.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Hyundai Elantra?\n\nAfter a refresh last year, the Elantra sees only minor changes for 2025. The previous SEL trim is renamed SEL Sport and adds gloss-black mirrors and spoiler, 17-inch alloy wheels, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and alloy pedals. The Convenience Package becomes a separate trim named SEL Convenience. \n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Hyundai Elantra Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nLED headlights\n8-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nCruise control\nTwo USB ports\nKeyless entry\nAutomatic emergency braking\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nLane departure steering assist\nSafe exit warning\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nLED taillights\nPower moonroof\nLeather-trimmed seats\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nFour USB ports\n10.25-inch touchscreen\nNavigation\nWireless device charging\nDual-zone automatic climate control\nDigital instrument panel\nAdaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability\nShould I Buy the 2025 Hyundai Elantra?\n\nThe Hyundai Elantra is a solid value with an eye-catching exterior you wouldn’t expect in a budget-minded compact sedan. Ride quality is good, and the Elantra’s handling makes it nimble in city traffic. The standard 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine delivers decent pep and refinement, but the N Line and N versions provide truly exciting acceleration. If fuel economy is your priority, the Elantra Hybrid earns an EPA-estimated 54 mpg in combined city and highway driving. What’s not to like? There are some noticeable penny-pinching materials in the Elantra’s cabin, plus some powertrain lag from the turbo engine in the sporty N Line variant.",
