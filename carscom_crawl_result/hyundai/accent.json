      "expert_review": "Hyundai gave its fifth-generation Accent sedan the green light for U.S. dealers, but a hatchback variant that’s available elsewhere won’t make it stateside. Hatch-o-philes can consider the redesigned Kia Rio, a platform sibling that’s available as a hatch. Compare the Accent and Rio here, or stack up the 2018 and 2017 Accent here.\n\nThe Accent comes in SE, SEL and Limited trim levels (compare them here), all with a 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine. The SE has a standard six-speed manual transmission or optional six-speed automatic; the SEL and Limited have only the automatic transmission. We evaluated a Limited and an SE manual.\n\nOutside and In\n\nThe redesigned Hyundai Accent wears its scaled-down-Elantra styling well. Even SE models have painted side mirrors and door handles, avoiding the budget-car giveaway of black plastic. Alas, the dashboard blows that cover: It’s an unremarkable dome-and-shelf routine with center controls slapped down the middle — a shape little different from any interior a decade ago. Styling is subjective, but the dashboards in a few other subcompacts — the Rio and Toyota Yaris iA spring to mind — have interesting layered designs. The Accent’s does not.\n\nThe Accent’s infotainment system is generous, at least. SE models get a 5-inch touchscreen, while SEL and Limited trims have a 7-inch unit with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. Those are nice provisions for this small-car class, especially because all versions have proper shortcut buttons, plus volume and tuning knobs. All systems have Bluetooth phone and audio streaming, plus the soon-mandatory backup camera with dynamic guidelines.\n\nMost controls feel weighty and secure, and SEL and Limited trims have a padded center armrest, but quality is otherwise spartan. The seats have rough-hewn cloth upholstery even in Limited models, and a mess of hard, shiny plastic surrounds them. Shoppers on a shoestring budget need not accept such limitations: The Yaris iA and Ford Fiesta, for example, have notably higher quality.\n\nAgreeable Road Manners\n\nLike the Rio, the Accent has generous ride comfort on its standard 15-inch wheels and high-profile P185/65R15 tires. The 17-inch wheels and P205/45R17 tires on Limited trim levels introduce some busyness and road noise over uneven surfaces, but the effect is well short of harsh. It’s controlled, too, with little bouncing or floatiness over broken pavement, but it doesn’t stay that way if you add weight — especially over the rear axle. Our Limited test car rode a touch firmer with two adults aboard, but a third adult in the backseat turned ride quality downright harsh, with choppy suspension response over bumps of all sizes.\n\nAt least the new Accent’s pint-size four-cylinder is up to the task, with immediate accelerator response up front. And the 1.6-liter (130 horsepower, 119 pounds-feet of torque) delivers enough power at city speeds to sustain the oomph even with multiple adults aboard. Driving solo, highway passing is acceptable, if noisy — both from engine and wind noise. The six-speed automatic downshifts quickly, though it sometimes hunts for gears before settling on the right one.\n\nThe manual transmission has medium throws, a large shift knob and a light clutch. For parents who want to teach three-pedal driving to their teenage children — more for character-building than practical application at this point — the Hyundai Accent’s stick is a quick learn, though it comes at a slight mileage penalty: 31 mpg combined in EPA ratings, versus 32 mpg with the automatic. Both figures are class-competitive.\n\nSteering is free of the prior Accent’s numb feedback, and its quick ratio evokes the Yaris iA or Honda Fit. Modest body roll limits the fun, but road-holding is impressive with the Limited trim’s wider Continental tires, which stave off eventual understeer to impressive limits. Not so with the skinnier rubber on the SE and SEL (also Continentals). For all their benefit to ride comfort, they slide early and often.\n\nValue and Safety\nFinal Thoughts\n\nI suspect many shoppers will cross-shop the Accent with its Kia sibling, which comes in both sedan and hatchback forms. The hatch has a roomier backseat versus the Accent’s cramped bench, but the Accent gets more equipment in top trim levels. Few shoppers will benefit from that, however: Hyundai officials expect more than half of all Accent shoppers to buy the SE and just 10 percent to get the Limited.\n\nIn a value-conscious group like subcompacts, the 2018 Accent is acceptable in many ways and impressive in a few. That may not overcome shopper sentiment against a class that’s under steady sales decline. But if you’re among the shrinking group of consumers who want an entry-level sedan — and if you’ve read this far, I suspect you are — the new Hyundai Accent is worth a look.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "In terms of reliability and social status, a Hyundai is one apology removed from deadbeat dads. As an adventure in money well spent, there’s more satisfaction in writing a check to the IRS.\n\nHyundai’s one celebrity owner was Rodney King. According to pursuing officers–and they would never fib to the media–King wrung 120 m.p.h. out of his Excel that infamous night. Cynics might note that such velocity from a Hyundai is usually attained only when the car is first tossed off a cliff. In last month’s J.D. Power quality survey of 33 makes, Hyundai finished 32nd. Just below Volkswagen, just above Kia.\n\nIn fact, the only poll Hyundai ever topped was a Robb Report reader survey of the worst things in life. Equal dishonor went to honeymoons in Gaza and eating all your vegetables.\n\nBut bet your next six lease payments on the 1995 Hyundai reversing this awfulness.\n\nFor here is a South Korean-built car, yes, a subcompact from the land of kimchi and Confucianism, that competes with similar short-wheel-base miniatures from Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Geo and Ford. And that’s in price, performance, quality of build, and the level and variety of equipment included as a basic package.\n\nExample: Bargain-basement Accents come equipped with dual air bags. So do typical members of the competition, the Ford Aspire and Geo Metro hatchbacks. But standard Accent accents–such as seat belt height adjusters, passenger vanity mirrors, remote fuel door release, intermittent wipers, cargo area covers, fold-down rear seats, and rear-window defrosters–are either optional or not available on Aspire or Metro.\n\nWith a 1.5-liter, 12-valve engine producing 92 horsepower, Accent flexes more muscles than the 70-horsepower Metro and 63-horsepower Aspire. Its power is comparable to Toyota’s Tercel and Honda’s Civic, subcompacts that cost about $1,000 more.\n\nYet the strength of Accent remains the tightness and the quality of its engineering. Everything fits, nothing gapes, and there is no suggestion from any control or component that it was built to fall apart. Handling is reliable and devoid of steering hesitation and cornering wobbles. A firm suspension subdues worn street surfaces without losing a driver’s sense of precisely what’s under the wheels.\n\nAnd there’s just enough power for this nifty front-driver to dart, nibble, stalk and take great liberties with less spirited traffic.\n\n*\n\nIt is not often that a subcompact comes bearing the credentials of a driver’s car. But the Accent–especially with its capable five-speed manual–is mischievous proof that a shoe-box sedan doesn’t have to be tinny, carelessly assembled, dangerously slow-footed, rattling or boring.\n\nUnless you insist on automatic transmission. Then Accent’s horsepower shrivels, acceleration becomes a slower motion, and drag-racing should only be attempted against street sweepers and large gentlemen on mountain bikes.\n\nHyundai’s poor-boy special is the Accent L hatchback starting at a bearable $8,529, less than half today’s average price of a new car. But best forget this version unless you’re into the inconvenience and discomfort of driving a shell with no radio, no power steering, no air conditioning, naked pressed-steel wheels, skinny tires and manual everything.\n\nMost buyers will probably order the Accent sedan at an affordable $8,979, bumped to a still-manageable $10,899 by an options package adding power steering, air conditioning, four-speaker sound system and tinted glass. Anti-lock brakes can be included in the same package for about $600 more.\n\nAt this price, of course, do not expect chamois-lined cup holders and a Dunhill cigarette lighter. But look at it this way: Crank windows are a wonderful form of hand exercise. Sunroofs and T-tops are not the recommendation of skin cancer specialists. And if God had meant us to have power seats, power locks and powerw ndows, she’d have given us fuses instead of teeth.\n\n*\n\nIt’s tough building styling excitement into a dimensionally challenged subcompact. Their planes aren’t broad enough to include sweep. Short wheelbases do not encourage lines that carry an eye easily, gracefully from grille to trunk.\n\nBut Hyundai has succeeded better than most, working within the restrictions to craft cute instead of awkward; smoothing what could have been a chunky lump into a poised, nicely rounded bantam. The three-door hatchback is particularly attractive, with a balanced, bobbed tail and deep, gaping chin grille that adds a little more menace than necessary.\n\nThe interior is much richer than the sticker suggests, showing not the slightest suggestion of an economy car up to its door handles in low bids. Carpeting is quality; the vinyls don’t blind by a cheap plastic sheen; all coloring is delicate and coordinated.\n\nSeat comforts are better than adequate. Head and shoulder room, particularly for rear seat passengers, is also more than one might expect from a category of car usually associated with scuffed knees and cricked necks.\n\nAnd be prepared to fall in love with the upholstery fabric. It is patterned gray on silver. It whispers Moet with a sniff of bath oil; lingerie by candlelight and one of Victoria’s more sensual secrets.\n\nAlthough Accent’s performance is a spirited giggle, it takes a little effort to keep the car in its sporting mode. Gears must be shifted late and often. Calls to the engine room must be strident and constant.\n\nUnder such pressure, engine noise becomes quite noticeable. So does the lack of much insulation to keep the din down below and outside the passenger compartment. But power is smooth, comes on quickly and is particularly effective in the early to mid-range gears.\n\nOn the downside: In this era of cast aluminum wheels for about $250 a set wholesale, there should be no purpose for plasticwheel covers except as pie plates.\n\nFor five-speed fans, a tachometer would be a useful option. Although Hyundai’s five-speed is a fairly satisfying system, shorter throws with a more distinct transfer from fifth to fourth would be nice.\n\nOn the dubious side: Earlier Hyundai’s were notorious for spending most of their adult lives on hoists being serenaded by the hmmms and sheeeses of mechanics whose hourly rates are on a par with good shrinks. Only time will decide if the Accent is faithful commuter or chronic invalid.\n\nOn the upside: The Accent replaces the Excel that never did. Not even at 120 m.p.h.\n\n1995 Hyundai Accent\n\nThe Good: Small size, small price, large levels of engineering, fit and finish. Peppy performer. Gas stingy. Good looker. Fully equipped. Hyundai finally gets it right.\n\nThe Bad: Gearbox needs some polish. Buzzy engine when pushed.\n\nThe Ugly: Plastic wheel covers.\n\nCost Base, $8,979. As test ed, $10,899. (Includes two air bags, five-speed manual, air conditioning, four-speaker sound system, power steering, remote trunk and fuel door release. Anti-lock brakes a package option.)\n\nEngine 1.5-liter, 12-valve, four-cylinder engine developing 92 horsepower.\n\nType Front-engine, front-drive, subcompact sedan.\n\nPerformance 0-60 m.p.h., as tested, 11.3 seconds. Top speed, estimated, 102 m.p.h. Fuel consumption, EPA city and highway, 29 and 38 m.p.g.\n\nCurb Weight 2,105 pounds.",

      "expert_review": "Sometimes, you just want a basic car … one that has four wheels, runs consistently and does not cost an arm and a leg. The 2006 Hyundai Accent GLS sedan meets those standards, and then some.\n\nA recent, weeklong test of the GLS compact took me down memory lane, where I asked myself, “Why didn’t I have a nice, new car like this when I was young, instead of that rusting hulk of an ancient sedan I drove off to college?”\n\nThe short answer is: I was a dunce.\n\nHappily, today’s youth have much more on the ball and would be smart to consider the Accent GLS as a first new-car purchase. The Accent also shapes up as a second household car when the big family sedan or sport-utility vehicle are parked in the garage or otherwise involved in the commuting cycle. Why an Accent? Here’s why:\n\nFor starters, it’s nicely equipped for the price. Hyundai used to be another word for cheap price and cheap components; no longer.\n\nWith a manufacturer’s suggested retail price of $13,305, the tester’s standard features included such attention-getters as front side air bags, side curtain air bags, electronic brake force distribution, vented front disc brakes and a most capable, six-speaker audio system.\n\nBut wait, the tester called for an extra $1,500 for the so-called “Premium-Sport Package” that brought in such staples as air conditioning, power windows, power heated mirrors, power door locks, remote keyless entry and 15-inch tires and alloy wheels.\n\nSo what? Even with the add-ons, the tester’s bottom line came to only $14,870.\n\nThis is a Hyundai product, so you get the alluring warranty packages, including the 10- year/100,000-mile powertrain package, the five-year/60,000- mile vehicle coverage and roadside assistance coverage for five years or however many miles an owner can drive a GLS.\n\nHere are a couple of more good-news numbers for you: 28 miles per gallon in city driving and 36 mpg on the highway. The gas tank holds a few ounces short of 12 gallons.\n\nFor those who cannot remember the last time a gas tank fill-up cost less than $35, no further explanation is necessary.\n\nGreat, you say, but how does it handle? All things considered, not too bad.\n\nThe Accent zipped through crowded commuter traffic like a champ. Once the revs were up, it was a surprisingly willing freeway car. Steering was responsive, handling was nimble and parking was a snap.\n\nSure, the reality is that the 1.6-liter, four-cylinder engine has a maximum horsepower rating of 110. That means that anyone attempting to swoop an Accent in front of a speeding Porsche would be a dunce (see above).\n\nIt also means that climbing the Sierra Nevada on the way to Lake Tahoe is an experience in engine struggle and noise.\n\nThe Accent will get you there safely and without guzzling fuel, but it won’t be like a trip in a Corvette.\n\nBut that’s the point, isn’t it? The GLS is an entry-level car.\n\nAs for leg room, if you’re thinking about stuffing three adults into the back seats of the GLS, here’s my advice: Don’t be cruel.\n\nThree adults won’t fit back there, and two fairly normal-size human beings are also likely to squirm after an hour in the confined space. However, the 60/40- split rear seats fold easily to create some convenient cargo space, if needed.\n\nHere’s more food for thought: Back in February, Hyundai Motor America unveiled the 2007 Accent lineup at the Chicago Auto Show, adding all-new, three-door GS and SE models as alternatives to the GLS. The Accent coupes look nice, but if you want four doors in your affordable compact, the GLS is sticking around.\n\nAnd while Toyota Camrys and Honda Accords have been perpetually in the automotive news limelight, be advised that Hyundai has sold nearly 600,000 Accents since the model was introduced in 1994.\n\nThat’s a pretty good record of consumer confidence covering three generations of Accents.\n\nLarge families, horsepower freaks and SUV devotees are not going anywhere near the ’06 Accent GLS. And rightly so.\n\nBut if you’re looking to buy that first new car, get a second car that won’t devour the household budget or upgrade the college-bound child’s ride, Accent probably belongs on your must-test-drive list.\n\nHyundai Accent at a glance\nMake/model: 2006 Hyundai Accent GLS\n\nVehicle type: Five-passenger, four-door, front-drive, compact sedan\n\nBase price: $13,305 (as tested, $14,870)\n\nEngine: 1.6-liter in-line 4 with 110 horsepower at 6,000 revolutions per minute and 106 foot-pounds of torque at 4,500 rpm\n\nEPA fuel economy: 28 miles per gallon city; 36 mpg highway\n\nTransmission: Four-speed automatic with overdrive\n\nSteering: Power-assisted rack and pinion\n\nBrakes: Power-assisted, vented discs on front; solid disc on rear (with anti-lock and other braking-enhancement features)\n\nSuspension: Independent, MacPherson strut-type on front; coupled torsion beam axle on rear (coil springs and gas shock absorbers front and rear)\n\nFuel tank: 11.9 gallons\n\nInterior volume: 92.2 cubic feet\n\nCargo volume: 12.4 cubic feet\n\nCurb weight: 2,403 pounds\n\nTrack: 57.9 inches front and rear\n\nHeight: 57.9 inches\n\nLength: 168.5 inches\n\nWheelbase: 98.4 inches\n\nWidth: 66.7 inches\n\nTires: P195/55VR15 radials\n\nFinal assembly point: Ulsan, South Korea\n\nAbout the writer: The Bee’s Mark Glover can be reached at (916) 321-1184 or mglover@sacbee.com.",

      "expert_review": "I love underdogs, the people chosen to lose. It stems from my belief in the human spirit, the faith that persistence, intelligence and imagination can turn anyone into a winner.\n\nUnderdogs, in that regard, actually have an advantage. Opponents tend to play them for fools, to discount their intelligence and imagination, to underestimate their desire to succeed. That allows underdogs to win by stealth.\n\nHyundai Motor Co. is a case in point.\n\nOnce the butt of jokes on late-night talk shows, the company saw its U.S. sales rise by 82 percent last year. Nobody laughed at that. Everybody took notice.\n\nHyundai’s comeback from its failed days of the early 1990s was powered by new products and marketing savvy.\n\nThe products are represented by this week’s test car, the completely redesigned 2000 Hyundai Accent GL subcompact sedan, one of the best cars available at a base price under $10,000.\n\nHyundai’s marketing smarts are in its warranty plan, which is the best in the business. But more on that later. Let’s look at the Accent.\n\nThe new car is a bigger version of its former self. Hyundai borrowed techniques from its rivals and placed the Accent’s wheels at the farthest corners of the car. The effect was to create more legroom and headroom and more seating comfort for driver and passengers.\n\nOverall, the Accent’s wheelbase &#151; the distance between the front and rear wheels &#151; increased by 1.6 inches, to 96.1 inches. Overall width increased nearly two inches.\n\nOther improvements were in body strength. Previous Accents felt flimsy. The new model has discernibly more substance and rigidity. Credit stiffer windshield pillars (A-pillars) and center pillars (B-pillars). Hyundai also filled those pillars with foam to increase crash protection and reduce vibration.\n\nThe company also stiffened the beam supporting the dashboard and related structures. Thus, vibrations in the steering wheel and instrument panel have been eliminated. Wind and road noises in the car have been reduced by the use of double seals around the doors and more sound-deadening materials in floor panels.\n\nClearly, Hyundai’s strategy is to give consumers much more than they’d expect in a $10,000 car. In most cases, the company delivers.\n\nStandard equipment includes a stereo cassette sound system, a very decent five-speed manual transmission, comfortable seating for four people, a well-designed instrument panel and, of course, all the federally required safety items, including dual front air bags and three-point safety belts.\n\nBut there are reminders that the new Accent is a bargain ride. Though fit and finish generally are excellent, cheap plastic remains noticeable, especially in the covering around the ignition-lock assembly. The car’s 13-inch-diameter tires discourage anything except the most sensible driving. And if the tires don’t send you that message, the Accent’s 1.5-l iter four-cylinder engine will.\n\nForget 0-to-60 times. You start your engine and move slowly through suburban or city streets, and by the time you reach the expressway the Accent is ready to roll &#151; after a stint in the right lane.\n\nThe engine, with three valves per cylinder, develops 92 horsepower at 5,500 rpm and 97 pound-feet of torque at 4,000 rpm. The test car was equipped with an optional, electronically controlled four-speed automatic transmission, which seemed to add more drag to the process.\n\nBut, hey, the Accent is a commuter, not a racer. It’s a good, fuel-efficient city car that offers reliable transportation, with many amenities, at a very good price.\n\nWinning often involves sticking to the basics and beefing up performance in areas that give you advantage. Hyundai has done that here.\n\nNuts &amp; Bolts\n\n2000 Hyundai Accent GL Complaints: Poor acceleration. Do not cut in front of trucks or more power ful cars in this one.\n\nPraise: One of the best city cars available.\n\nHead-turning quotient: Mainstream attractive. Low “wow” factor.\n\nRide and handling: Good ride and handling. A four-wheel, independent suspension system is standard.\n\nBrakes: Power, ventilated front discs and rear drums. Anti-locks are optional.\n\nCapacities: The Accent can carry 10.7 cubic feet of cargo. Fuel tank holds 11.9 gallons of regular unleaded gasoline.\n\nMileage: About 30 miles per gallon, combined city/highway.\n\nWarranty: Basic bumper-to-bumper coverage is for five years or 60,000 miles. Powertrain coverage (for original buyer only) is for 10 years or 100,000 miles. Coverage includes 24-hour roadside assistance coverage &#151; no extra charge, no mileage limit &#151; for five years.\n\nPrice: Base price is $9,699. Dealer invoice on base model is $9,078. Price as tested is $11,384, including $1,250 in options and a $435 destination charge.\n\nPurse-strings note: This is an economy car. Don’t go nuts with options. Compare with Chevrolet Cavalier, Ford Focus, Toyota Echo, Daewoo Lanos, Kia Sephia and Honda Civic.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nHyundais smallest, least-expensive model was redesigned for 2000, and this year the GS and GL models get a larger engine  a 1.6-liter four-cylinder instead of a 1.5-liter. The front-drive Accent returns in two-door hatchback and four-door sedan styling.\n\nHyundai owns automaker Kia, which make up Koreas largest and second-largest auto manufacturers, respectively. DaimlerChrysler recently bought a 10 percent stake in Hyundai, and the two companies will work with Japanese manufacturer Mitsubishi to develop a new line of small cars for worldwide sale.\n\nExterior\nBoth body styles have a 96-inch wheelbase and an overall length of 167 inches, making them about 8 inches shorter than a Ford Focus Sedan or Honda Civic.\n\nInterior\nHyundai says the Accent seats five with its two front buckets and a rear bench seat, but limited legroom and a narrow interior make four people the practical limit. Cargo volume is 10.7 cubic feet on the sedan and 16 cubic feet on the hatchback, and both have a folding rear seatback that expands cargo capacity.\n\nStandard equipment includes power steering, a cassette player and rear window defroster.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 1.5-liter four-cylinder with 92 horsepower returns as the engine for the base models. The GS and GL models now get a 1.6-liter four-cylinder that generates 105 hp. Both engines come with a standard five-speed manual or optional four-speed automatic transmission.\n\n \n\nReported by Rick Popely  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2001 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nChanges for 2002 are few for Hyundais smallest, least-expensive model. Redesigned for 2000, the front-drive Accent is available as a two-door hatchback or a four-door sedan. A 105-hp, 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine is standard in the GL and GS, while the base Accent holds a 1.5-liter engine that makes 92 horsepower.\n\nDaimlerChrysler has a 10 percent stake in Hyundai, which in turn owns automaker Kia. The two companies rank as South Koreas largest and second-largest auto manufacturers, respectively. In the coming years, both are expected to work with Japanese manufacturer Mitsubishi to develop a new line of small cars for worldwide sale.\n\nExterior\nDiffering in appearance from the econoboxes of the past, Hyundais Accent is made up largely of straight lines and edges, with enough curves thrown in to attract interest. On a 96.1-inch wheelbase, the Accent has an overall length of 166.7 inches  about 8 inches shorter than the Ford Focus sedan or the Honda Civic.\n\nInterior\nCapable of seating five occupants, at least in theory, the Accent has two front buckets and a rear bench seat. Limited legroom and a narrow interior make four people the practical limit. Cargo volume is 11.8 cubic feet for the sedan and 16.9 cubic feet for the hatchback. Both body styles have a folding rear seatback that expands cargo capacity. Standard equipment includes power steering, a cassette player and a rear-window defroster.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe base model uses a 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine that develops 92 hp, while the GL and GS models get a 105-hp, 1.6-liter four-cylinder. Both power plants can team with a standard five-speed manual or an optional four-speed-automatic transmission. Antilock brakes and side-impact airbags are not available.\n\nDriving Impressions\nUnlike the small vehicles of Hyundais past, the Accent qualifies as one of the better small cars on the market  a market that isnt exactly overloaded these days. Despite some drawbacks, a lengthy powertrain warranty helps make the Accent a good value. Gas mileage is another big benefit.\n\nThe Accent is easy to drive. It has somewhat sluggish steering but maneuvers competently enough. A hatchback with an automatic transmission turned out to be enjoyable, practical and fairly comfortable. It is rather cute in appearance and appears to be well-built. Front-seat space is abundant, but riders in the backseat will be more cramped with only fair legroom. Getting into the back isnt so easy, either.\n\nDespite some slight choppiness, the ride is pleasant. Ample glass translates to fine visibility. When accelerating hard in lower gears, the engine delivers a loud blare, but its quieter while cruising. The manual-shift Accent is more spirited, but an automatic-transmission model lags in strength and has to struggle hard to trudge up steep grades. Passing and merging with the automatic might produce more noise than action, so discretion is needed before darting out into traffic, especially with the lower-powered engine.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2002 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "I can’t help but smile when I see a child-safety seat in a small car’s backseat. I like to think of these folks as rebels proclaiming to the world that having a family doesn’t relegate them to a life of minivans. If you also have a desire to buck the system and drive a smaller, more economical car with a child (or two) in tow, the redesigned 2012 Hyundai Accent is an attractive option.\n\nCombined with great fuel economy and a low sticker price, the 2012 Hyundai Accent gives parents an affordable car that doesn’t sacrifice style or personality.\n\nSure, the Accent won’t be feasible for many families, rebellious or not. If your family has more than four people, this subcompact won’t even be in the running. If you’ve got older kids, an outing with the entire family might lead to legroom complaints. However, the Accent’s size wasn’t a problem for my family of three, and it really got me thinking about how I could get used to driving an affordable car.\n\nMy hatchback test car with a standard six-speed manual transmission was fun to drive for the first couple of days. I was almost convinced that I could ditch my crossover and become a rebel mom, too, but after taking the Accent on the freeway, I knew I wouldn’t be heading to the dealer for a trade-in any time soon. The Accent was responsive and handled well around town while I was running errands, but at higher speeds, it seemed like it would blow off the road at times. I wouldn’t go so far as to compare it to a tin can tooling down the highway, but the car did feel lightweight.\n\nThe Hyundai Accent comes as both a hatchback and sedan, which has a starting MSRP of $12,445. The base GS hatchback starts at $14,595; my test car, a SE trim hatchback, had a $15,925 sticker price.\n\nEXTERIOR\nWith an all-new body style for 2012, the Accent is a real standout in the subcompact class, and it definitely looks more expensive than its price. From my test car’s bold Marathon Blue paint to its sporty, fluid styling, this modest five-door is a looker. I could hold my head high when parking in a crowded lot or pulling up to any destination as people surprisingly exclaimed, “That’s a Hyundai?”\n\nThe five-seater has a low step-in height, making it easy for kids to enter and exit it. Adults will want to watch their heads, though. I’m just 5 feet 4 inches tall and when standing next to the Accent I could see over its roof.\n\nThe hatchback body style gave me better access to the cargo area and made loading things like my stroller into the back a little easier, thanks to a deep-set space. Full disclosure: I had to remove one of my stroller’s wheels to get it in the back, but it fit along with a couple of grocery bags and a shopping cart seat cover! If I wasn’t so lazy, I could’ve folded the 60/40-split rear seats for even more cargo space.\n\nWhat I really liked about the Accent was filling up the gas tank for not a lot of cash. Its 138-horsepower, 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine gets an EPA-estimated 30/40 mpg city/highway with regular unleaded gas. Saving money is always a welcome scenario for a family, and it felt great to check the trip computer and revel over the gas mileage I was averaging. Just the fuel economy alone had me thinking about how nice it could be to put an Accent on permanent family duty.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Some\n\nINTERIOR\nWith its low price, you wouldn’t expect there’d be much to say about the Accent’s interior, but there are a lot of surprises when it comes to its cabin. Hyundai managed to make the inside of this small, inexpensive car look much more spacious and expensive than it really is. Small details such as piano-black surfaces surrounded by silver-painted trim were a welcome sight compared to the usual cheap plastic wasteland usually found in econo-cars.\n\nThe Accent’s biggest surprise was its roominess. It’s still small, but somehow all my passengers riding shotgun with a rear-facing child-safety seat behind them claimed to not feel cramped. There was room for the infant seat without having to pull the front passenger seat all the way forward. This is a considerable feat!\n\nCupholder enthusiasts should be warned that there are only two in the Accent. Backseat occupants will just have to hold their drinks. In the front row, there’s a decent-size upper bin intended to store sunglasses that can be used for other items if you’re feeling creative, and the cubby below the center stack can hold a smartphone and lip balm with room for spare change.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Puny\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2012 Accent received the top scores of Good in frontal, rear and roof-strength crash tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. It got the second highest score of Acceptable in side crash tests. In crash tests by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the Accent received an overall rating of four stars out of five.\n\nThe Accent has standard front-wheel drive, all-disc antilock brakes with brake assist, an electronic stability system with traction control, active front head restraints and six airbags, including side curtains for both rows. The best feature is that the base model and the top-trim Accent have the same safety features, which adds to its values for families — no matter their price point.\n\nI was concerned I’d have to become a human pretzel when it was time to install my daughter’s rear-facing infant-safety seat in the Accent, but it went much better I than expected. Thanks to the Accent’s roomy interior, I had a little wiggle room and the process was relatively painless. The two sets of lower Latch anchors were quickly located, though buried deeply between the seat cushions, and the car seat was installed and ready for use in minutes. See how the 2012 Accent performed in our Car Seat Check.\n\nGet more safety information about the Hyundai Accent here.",

      "expert_review": "The good thing about driving one of the smallest cars of 1998 – the Hyundai Accent two-door hatchback – is that it comes with a shrunken sticker price that’s sure to appeal to folks just seeking basic transportation.\n\nWho’s going to argue with the Accent’s base price of $9,899 – or our GS test vehicle, which only cost $11,008 – once you’ve added a couple amenities such as air conditioning and floor mats.\n\nWell, leave it to us to come up with a few compelling arguments, one for embracing the little Korean bargain and one for ignoring it.\n\nShe: I’m giving the Accent four stars, which is our highest rating, but I’m also going to tell buyers that I have some serious reservations about owning this smallest and cheapest Hyundai. It’s thrilling to have a new car that doesn’t feel like a stripped-down junker for only $10,000. But it’s also scary to drive it next to Ford Expeditions and Dodge Ram pickup trucks. And I would be a wreck putting one of our teen-agers in it.\n\nHe: I could make the same pitch against a Porsche Boxster. When you’re driving alongside one of those big sport-utes, you’re not going to feel safe in anything, unless it’s another big sport-ute. I also think the Accent is a terrific value. You get an awful lot of car for $11,000. The Accent GS comes with a thrifty overhead-cam 1.5-liter four-cylinder that returns up to 36 mpg in highway driving. It’s not the fastest small car on the road. But it’s pretty nimble and surprisingly spunky.\n\nShe: You’re being very clinical here. I think the Accent has the potential for great emotional appeal. In fact, the exterior styling reminds me a little of the new Volkswagen Beetle. It’s got a hood with slightly plump lines and a sprightly look overall. Inside, the rooflines are curvy and give the impression of more room than you’d expect in a vehicle that’s so tiny. It’s cute and huggable.\n\nHe: You want my seat-of-the-pants impression? The Accent is lots of fun to drive, with its all-independent suspension and stabilizer bars, although the relatively short 94.5-inch wheelbase makes for a pretty harsh and choppy ride on rough pavement. Still, it’s surprisingly comfortable, even for an old guy like me. I can see it having great appeal to teens and first-time buyers. And I wouldn’t have any problem recommending it to a friend.\n\nShe: I could see why you’d do that. The little hatchback is less than half the price of the average car today. And you do get some delightful little features that you’d expect on a more expensive vehicle. A rear window defroster and wiper, for example, and an AM/FM stereo with a cassette. More importantly, the Accent feels like Japanese quality, not Korean quality.\n\nHe: There are still some things that annoy me. The paint job is pretty rough, even for an $11,000 car, and some of the trim looks cheap and tacky. But overall, Hyundai continues to improve dramatically the quality of its cars.\n\nShe: There are still some things tha t impress me. Particularly the quality of the seats. The front driver’s seat has a five-way adjustment with lumbar support, and it’s actually quite comfortable over long hauls. The Accent’s back seat is definitely a cut above competitors such as the Dodge/Plymouth Neon, which feels more like a hard picnic bench than a car seat.\n\nHe: One additional thought. If you’re attracted to the Hyundai and you’ve got a few extra bucks to play with, you might want to check out the Accent GSi, which comes with larger 14-inch tires, alloy wheels and a stiffer suspension, plus lots of other upgrades.\n\nShe: The only thing you don’t get on any of the Accent models is enough sheet metal to make you feel immortal, infallible and invincible. If you can live with that, go ahead and buy it.\n\n1998 Hyundai Accent GS 3-door\n\nType: Front-wheel-drive, five-passenger hatchback\n\nPrice: Base, $9,899; as tested, $11,008 (no additional destination charge)\n\nWhat’s new ’98: Mild front and rear restyling; all models but L get power steering\n\nStandard equipment:\n\nFour-wheel independent suspension\n\nFront disc brakes\n\nTinted glass\n\nIntermittent wipers\n\nRear window defroster\n\nRear window wiper/washer\n\nAM/FM cassette radio\n\n60/40 split-fold rear seat\n\nCloth upholstery\n\nSafety:\n\nAdjustable front seat belts\n\nDual front air bags\n\nOptions on test vehicle:\n\nAir conditioner ($994)\n\nCarpeted floor mats ($60)\n\nMud guards ($55).\n\nEPA fuel economy: 28 mpg city/36 mpg highway\n\nEngine: 1.5-liter four-cylinder; 92 hp at 5,500 rpm; 97 lb-ft torque at 4,000 rpm\n\nTransmission: Five-speed manual\n\n12-month insurance cost, according to AAA Michigan: $1,100.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nHyundai’s smallest, least costly model got minor revisions for 2004 after receiving a major face-lift for the 2003 model year. The 2003 changes included reworked styling for the hood, fenders, headlights, fascias and taillights. Built in South Korea, the front-wheel-drive Accent was last redesigned for 2000.\n\nAntilock brakes are newly optional on 2005 models. GLS and GT trim levels are available for the three-door hatchback, while the four-door sedan comes only in GLS form.\n\nExterior\nRiding on a 96.1-inch wheelbase, the Accent is 166.7 inches long overall � that’s more than 8 inches shorter than the compact Honda Civic and Ford Focus sedans. GT models have 14-inch alloy wheels, a sport-tuned suspension, a rear spoiler and fog lamps.\n\nInterior\nAll Accent models are capable of seating up to five occupants; however, the car’s limited legroom and narrow interior make four passengers the practical limit.\n\nCargo volume is 11.8 cubic feet for the sedan and 16.9 cubic feet for the hatchback; both body styles have a 60/40-split folding rear seatback that expands cargo capacity. Standard equipment includes a cassette player and a rear-window defroster. Air conditioning is optional. GT hatchbacks have white-faced gauges and a leather-wrapped steering wheel.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Accent uses a 1.6-liter four-cylinder that develops 104 horsepower. A five-speed-manual gearbox is standard, and a four-speed-automatic transmission is optional.\n\nSafety\nSide-impact airbags are standard, and antilock brakes are optional.\n\nDriving Impressions\nUnlike the small cars of Hyundai’s past, the Accent qualifies as one of today’s better examples. Despite some drawbacks, a lengthy powertrain warranty makes the Accent a good value. Good gas mileage is another benefit.\n\nThe Accent is easy to drive. Steering isn’t as crisp as that of some other subcompact cars, but the Accent maneuvers competently. Front-seat space is abundant, but backseat riders will be more cramped because there’s only a fair amount of legroom. Getting into the hatchback’s backseat isn’t easy.\n\nDespite some light choppiness, the ride is generally pleasant. The Accent practically glides over rough spots even though its suspension fails to absorb much harshness. Ample glass area translates into fine visibility.\n\nWhen accelerating hard in lower gears, the engine delivers a loud blare, but it’s quieter while cruising. The manual-shift-equipped Accent is spirited, but the automatic-transmission model struggles on steep grades. Passing and merging with an automatic-equipped Accent can produce more noise than action, so discretion is wise before darting out into traffic.",

      "expert_review": "It’s easy to think of Hyundai’s sporty three-door Accent as an antidote to the rising price of gasoline.\n\nThe hatchback joins the existing Accent GLS sedan, and it is a good example of why small urban cars are gaining attention. Thrifty commuting doesn’t have to be boring or uncomfortable.\n\nThis sharp-looking compact comes in two trim levels. The GS starts at $10,995 and the SE at $14,495. Both are powered by a 1.6-liter engine rated at 32 miles per gallon in the city and 35 on the highway.\n\nAccording to Hyundai, the three-door has more interior volume, both passenger and cargo, than a Toyota Corolla or Honda Civic. Consequently, the government classifies it as a compact, rather than a subcompact.\n\nLessons learned from design and execution of larger cars continue to trickle down to small urban cars, and the Accent SE was a good example. Handsome styling, a wide assortment of standard equipment and agile handling made it clear that a small economy car doesn’t have to be a rolling penalty box.\n\nCreature comforts include air conditioning, power windows, power heated outside mirrors, keyless entry, 16-inch wheels and low-profile tires, fog lights, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and a 172-watt AM/FM/CD player with six speakers.\n\nThe test car’s options included a power sunroof and upgraded audio system with a six-disc CD player.\n\nSome folks worry about safety in small cars, but the SE comes with front, side and side-curtain airbags.\n\nThe Accent’s 110-horsepower, 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine has four valves per cylinder and continuously variable valve timing. This powerplant, which Hyundai says is the most powerful in its class, is full of energy and revs easily. Fuel economy is rated at 32 miles per gallon in the city and 35 on the highway. The engine qualifies for an Ultra Low Emission Vehicle rating and has a 10-year, 100,000-mile warranty. Roadside assistance is free for five years or 60,000 miles.\n\nThe five-speed gearbox has a light, direct shift linkage, and the clutch is a breeze to use. The final drive ratio seems to be fairly low because the engine rpm is about 3,400 at 70 mph, and that makes the engine sound busy on the highway.\n\nThe SE is not a sports car, but it handles with reasonable precision. It has a sport-tuned suspension with unique springs, shock absorber valving, stabilizer bar and steering gear that deliver considerably flatter cornering than the GLS sedan. The 45-series tires on 16-inch rims look great and aid handling, but their low profile contributes to a slightly choppy ride on uneven surfaces. That said, I still prefer the enhanced handling and solid road feel to a soft, mushy ride.\n\nFour-wheel, anti-lock disc brakes round out the SE’s performance package. The brakes also automatically distribute brake force from front to rear depending on load and conditions.\n\nThe SE’s cabin is nicely appointed. The light metallic blue test car had light gray cloth seats, a two-tone instrument panel and brushed silver accents. The two-tone instrument panel is dark on top to reduce reflections in the windshield and light on the bottom to help give the cabin a feeling of spaciousness.\n\nThe leather-wrapped steering wheel was pleasant to touch. Controls for the radio and climate were simple and direct. The center console had two cup holders, a removable ashtray and two power outlets. Additional storage is available with the seatback pockets and bottle holders in the front doors.\n\nThe 60/40 split-folding rear seat is handy for hauling large items, and it’s easy to load them with a hatchback.\n\nPrice The base price of the test car was $13,915. Options included a power sunroof and upgraded audio system with a six-disc CD player. The sticker price was $15,250.\n\nWarranty Five years or 60,000 miles with a 10-year, 100,000-mile powertrain warranty.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in June 2011 about the 2012 Hyundai Accent. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2013, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nEditor’s note: Estimated mileage ratings have been lowered to reflect a November 2012 EPA audit of this car’s stated mileage.\n\nA few years ago the subcompact class was supposed to take over the auto industry. There was a slew of small cars with low sticker prices and decent efficiency, power and features. While all of them got you to Point B, few did so as a complete package, and the segment as a whole didn’t set the world afire, even with high gas prices. Hyundai’s Accent was at the rear of the pack, and for 2012 the company has completely redesigned its entry-level offering.\n\nThe Accent now runs away from the rest of the segment in terms of value and features.\n\nThe bulbous two-door hatchback body style — and its sub-$10,000 price tag — are gone, replaced by attractive four-door sedan and hatchback body styles. The base price has risen by a few thousand dollars, but it actually delivers more value now.\n\nThe Accent sedan is on sale now, and the hatchback will arrive at dealers by the end of June.\n\nPerformance\nSubcompact buyers have been treated poorly in the performance department. Inexpensive engines and transmissions have resulted in subpar mileage numbers despite the fact that the subcompacts weigh less than compact cars.\n\nLike the Ford Fiesta, the new Accent gets an advanced engine. Hyundai has direct injection in its new 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine, good for 138 horsepower. That’s a lot of power in this segment. It gets 28/37 mpg city/highway when teamed with either the standard six-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission. The Fiesta is closest, with ratings of 28/37 mpg. You can choose a Fiesta SE hatchback with an automatic and optional SFE Package to get 29/40 mpg, but that will cost $16,990. The Accent’s highest configuration price is $16,795. The Honda Fit is far behind at 27/33 mpg, and the Toyota Yaris is in the mix at 29/36 mpg.\n\nWhile the Accent has more power than others in the class, I wouldn’t call it fleet of foot. When accelerating from a dead stop, the Accent strained, as do most in this class, and I was ferrying two other average-size adults in the car. It struggled even more up hills, but on the highway it passed with plenty of assurance.\n\nIt felt livelier than the Fiesta, especially when using the manual feature on the six-speed automatic I was testing. Few cars in this class have that feature or hill start assist, which is standard on automatic models. While stopped on an incline, it keeps the car from rolling backward when the driver’s foot moves from the brake to the gas.\n\nOnly the Fit might be quicker, but the Fit falls far short in a very important department that makes the Accent exceptional: It has a soft, comfortable ride that is rare not only among subcompacts but also most compacts. Road noise is also exceptionally quiet. My test route on the roads around Las Vegas and the Hoover Dam was made up of mostly fresh or smooth blacktop, but even over the rare concrete highway segments I encountered, it was easy to hold a conversation.\n\nSteering is as crisp as you would expect from a car this small. I did feel that the low-rolling-resistance tires didn’t offer enough grip when making sharp turns, however. The car didn’t exhibit much of the body roll you sometimes encounter in this segment.\n\nAdd that to terrific brakes — standard four-wheel discs — and the Accent exudes a sense of safe travel, which is something that is often hard to come by in a subcompact.\n\nExterior\nWhen you think subcompact, interesting design doesn’t immediately come to mind. Look at cars like the Yaris, Fit and Nissan Versa, and you won’t be wowed. Buyers in this segment have been basically told that with the bottom-basement sticker price comes ho-hum looks, and who are you to complain?\n\nHowever, tides are changing, and the Accent is the second of a new wave of aggressively styled yet affordable small cars along with the Fiesta and upcoming Kia Rio.\n\nThe front end mimics the larger compact Hyundai Elantra’s look, but the smaller dimensions of the Accent are most noticeable in profile and the rear of the sedan. Its short trunk lid and wraparound taillights highlight how much shorter the car is versus the Elantra.\n\nThe four-door hatchback is a bit better-looking and seems like a more cohesive, upscale design. It doesn’t look unique from the side and could be confused with any number of other hatchbacks on the market, but the rear hatch itself has a very small window and lots of sheet metal below it that’s framed by two very tall taillights.\n\nIt’s a bold look for an inexpensive car.\n\nInterior & Cargo\nLike the performance and the exterior design, the inside, too, reminds me of a more substantial vehicle. All the fabrics, buttons and plastic panels are of good quality. The textured dashboard and design look futuristic and sleek.\n\nHyundai had a new Ford Fiesta on hand during my test of the Accent, and I compared its high-quality interior with that of the Accent. I’d say the two are nearly on par, with Ford having a few more instances of chintzy materials, especially the flimsy plastic door handles, while the Accent has substantial chromed handles.\n\nThe front seats are also quite comfortable with good support. I drove for an hour and sat as the front passenger for about an hour and felt no twinges of discomfort. The rear is also rather large, ferrying adults in relative comfort with 33.3 inches of legroom and 47.2 inches of hip room. Both numbers are behind the spacious Fit at 34.5 and 51.3 inches, respectively, but are favorable to the Ford Fiesta’s 31.2 and 49.2 inches, respectively.\n\nAt 13.7 cubic feet, the sedan’s trunk is good, identically sized to the Yaris sedan and ahead of the Fiesta’s 12.8 cubic feet. The hatchback’s cargo area leads the class at 21.2 cubic feet, significantly bigger than the four-door versions of the Fiesta (15.4) and Yaris (9.8). The Fit is closest at 20.6 cubic feet, but when you fold the rear seats flat, the Fit wins with its 57.3 cubic feet versus the Accent’s 47.5 cubic feet.\n\nFeatures\nHyundai isn’t succeeding these days just because its cars are improving. The brand is also keeping prices low with impressive content levels. That continues here.\n\nThe base GLS sedan is the least expensive option, and its $12,445 price tag doesn’t include air conditioning, power mirrors and windows, or a stereo. To get those features and still keep the standard six-speed manual transmission, you need to opt for the Comfort Package, which raises the price to $14,195 and adds a stereo with USB input and power mirrors. I doubt many owners will forgo air conditioning, but if you do and regret it, Hyundai says you can easily go back to the dealer and get it installed for an additional fee.\n\nThe GLS still comes standard with 14-inch steel wheels, trip computer, height-adjustable driver’s seat, 60/40-split folding rear seat and a center armrest, none of which is a given in this class. A tilt steering wheel is standard across the line. No telescoping feature is available.\n\nIf you want the automatic transmission, it comes in an option package that includes the Comfort Package, raising the price to $15,195. A Premium Package can be added to the automatic GLS that adds remote keyless entry, cruise control, Bluetooth, premium cloth seats, sunglasses holder, sliding armrest and storage box, 16-inch alloy wheels, fog lights and steering-wheel-mounted audio controls.\n\nThe GLS is the only sedan trim available.\n\nThe five-door hatchback comes better equipped in GS and SE trims with either manual or automatic transmissions.\n\nAt $14,595, the GS has air conditioning, six-speaker stereo with USB, armrest, and power windows and mirrors. The automatic is an extra $1,200 and includes cruise control.\n\nThe $15,795 SE adds sportier steering, cruise control, Bluetooth, leather-wrapped steering wheel, premium cloth seats, 16-inch alloy wheels, fog lights and a rear spoiler. Automatic transmission is an additional $1,000.\n\nSafety\nThe Accent comes with a number of standard safety features we haven’t seen in this class. Chief among them is standard stability control, which is required by law on all 2012 models but isn’t present on many subcompacts currently on sale, even as an option. Active front head restraints and side-impact and side curtain airbags are also standard.\n\nThe Accent has not yet been crash-tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.\n\nAccent in the Market\nThe Accent is a winning formula of attractive design meeting extreme value. The fact that it drives well and gets class-leading mileage only cements it at the top of the subcompact class … for now. New models from Kia, Chevy and Nissan will be out later this year while redesigned products from Honda and Toyota are on the horizon.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nAvailable as base Blue, GS and sporty SE two-door hatchbacks or a GLS four-door sedan, the Accent competes with economy cars like the Chevrolet Aveo, Nissan Versa and Toyota Yaris. The compact car comes standard with six airbags and a 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine. All models include a 10-year, 100,000-mile limited powertrain warranty.\n\nNew for 2010\nThe Accent gets improved EPA-estimated fuel economy ratings and a new base trim, called Blue.\n\nExterior\nThe Accent Blue has black side mirrors and door handles; those parts are body-colored on other trims.\n\nAvailable power mirrors\n14- or 16-inch wheels\nStandard rear window defroster\nAvailable rear window wiper\nOptional ground-effects kit and alloy fuel door\nAvailable fog lights\n\nInterior\nFor 2010, all automatic Accents get an “Eco indicator” that tells drivers when they are being very fuel efficient (green), moderately efficient (yellow) and less efficient (red).

      "expert_review": "In a world of economic instability, any new car that can tout a sub-$10,000 starting price has a lot going for it. OK, it has exactly one thing going for it: It’s cheap. But that doesn’t necessarily mean a horrible driving experience — nor does it mean every trim level of said car is cheap.\n\nThat’s where the Hyundai Accent fits into the marketplace. It’s inexpensive, inoffensive and gets good gas mileage. While that may not sound like a ringing endorsement, the Accent holds its own in a crowded field, and that says a heck of a lot.\n\nI tested a 2009 Accent; 2010 models are arriving at dealerships now with a few changes.\n\nChanges for 2010\nThe biggest change for the 2010 Accent is its mileage. All trim levels see at least a 1 mpg bump, and the all-new base trim level, called Blue, gets a large jump versus the 2009 base model. The Blue comes only as a two-door hatchback and gets 28/36 mpg city/highway, versus 27/33 mpg for the base 2009 Accent.\n\nThose mileage gains come with no changes to horsepower or torque.\n\nA smaller change is the addition of a standard iPod/USB port for all trim levels. Otherwise, the 2010s should be nearly identical to the 2009 I detail below.\n\nPerformance\nA horsepower rating of 110 doesn’t sound like a lot of power to anyone these days, but it was only a few years ago that a Honda Civic produced only 115 hp. The Accent’s four-cylinder never felt underpowered, which says a lot for the little hatchback. It moved nimbly in city driving and handled itself well on the highway, too.\n\nThe Accent felt well-planted at high speeds and was relatively quiet for a car in this class. Besides some loud engine noise, the overall sound level reminded me just how far this class of cars has come in the past 10 years. The ride was pleasant, too. It wasn’t too firm, like the Honda Fit, while not being quite as comfortable as a Nissan Versa.\n\nThe 2009 Accent SE tested is rated at 27/33 mpg city/highway, and after 220 miles of morning and afternoon commutes through bumper-to-bumper traffic, side streets and suburban sprawl, it registered exactly 31 mpg, which is faithful to the ratings.\n\nThe one issue I had with the economy car’s performance was the manual transmission in my SE. It’s the same stick found in sub-$10,000 base models, and let me tell you, it is one annoying manual.\n\nThe clutch itself takes some getting used to, releasing much higher than most drivers would expect. The real issue, though, is the shifter. Each shift between gears is broken up by a huge “clunk” as the stick literally gets stuck mid-throw before reaching the next position in the traditional H pattern. Every single person who drove this car commented on it — with pained expressions. After a long commute, my right elbow was sore from all the hard shifting.\n\nAcceleration in 1st and 2nd gears is quite brisk, and I would even call it enjoyable. If it weren’t for the slightly zippier competition in the Yaris and Fit, the Accent’s quickness would have come as a bigger shock.\n\nInterior\nBecause the Accent has gone longer than most of its competition since its last redesign, the interior is definitely behind the others I’ve already mentioned, but it’s about on par with Chevy’s tiny Aveo5. If your last memory of a compact hatch is more than five years old, though, the Accent will probably be higher quality than you’d expect.\n\nAlthough it certainly feels and looks like a sub-$15,000 car, the Accent doesn’t feel like a $10,000 car. The dash is well laid out, fit and finish is decent, and there’s a lot of space for the driver and front passenger. I managed to fit my son’s full-size convertible car seat using the Latch connectors in the backseat. It was snug and kind of hard to get him in and out, but he couldn’t manage to kick the back of my seat, which is unusual in small test cars.\n\nMy one big gripe with the interior is the flimsy seats, which gave me a sore back about 20 minutes into my 70-minute commute (made so long by summer construction). When I got to my cubicle, my desk chair felt downright therapeutic in comparison. The only plus is the captain’s-chair-style armrests, which are a great thought in a car so small that its center console is low on the floor. The Yaris I tested didn’t have armrests at all.\n\nExterior\nThe two-door hatchback Accent is kind of cute, kind of sporty and a little dorky. Some folks I came across liked it; others just weren’t offended by it. The sedan’s styling is much more conservative, and overall no one is going to turn their head to look at an Accent. It certainly isn’t as striking as a Fit or Yaris.\n\nCargo\nAnother surprise was this little car’s big cargo area. At 15.9 cubic feet with the rear seats in place, the Accent far surpasses the Yaris’ 9.5 cubic feet of cargo volume, and it’s not far from the larger, four-door Versa hatchback, which boasts 17.8 cubic feet. The Honda Fit, though, is pretty huge, with 20.6 cubic feet.\n\nI was also able to squeeze two large baby gates into the back — upright, with the backseat down — along with other bulky items filling the rest of the cargo area while running some errands. Later, it swallowed a rather expensive grocery-store run ably, with no need to lower the seats.\n\nFeatures\nThe problem with low-cost models like the Accent is that their low advertised price translates to few frills — or even basic amenities. Pricing for the 2010 models starts at the same low $9,970 price of the 2009 base model and both come without air conditioning or a stereo. Our somewhat-loaded SE test car had power windows and, thankfully, air conditioning, along with a pretty decent stereo. It also had larger 16-inch wheels, antilock brakes and a sportier suspension. Its final price was $15,790, including a $720 destination charge.\n\nThat’s why those low prices are deceiving; while the Honda Fit starts much higher, at $15,610 after a $710 destination charge, it comes standard with almost everything in the SE version I tested.\n\nThe Fit is also bigger, more fun to drive and has a vastly superior interior, including comfier seats.\n\nAccent in the market\nIf all you need is the most basic transportation, a sub-$10,000 Accent might be the right pick for you. But once you reach the full price tag by loading it up with features most buyers expect in any car these days, you’re encroaching on territory ruled by Honda and Toyota.\n\nThe wild card is likely to be the real-world price, as you’re more likely to find a Hyundai with a bigger discount. Current incentives on the Accent are $1,500 cash back on 2009 models and $500 for 2010s (excluding the low-cost base models) through Nov. 2. The Fit rarely, if ever, sees cash-back offers.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "The competition among mainstream compact SUVs has only gotten hotter since the current Hyundai Tucson made its debut for 2016. For 2019, the Tucson gets a mid-cycle freshening that helps it keep pace with redesigned or revised competitors, including such sales leaders as the Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4 and Nissan Rogue. (Compare them here.)\n\nStyling tweaks give the Tucson’s look a modest update, but the more significant changes include a revised powertrain lineup, tech upgrades and additional safety and driver assistance systems available across more trim levels. These changes make the 2019 more attractive and add value to a car that already boasts Hyundai’s long warranty. Trim levels are slightly juggled, now including a base SE and a repackaged and repositioned Value, plus the SEL, Sport, Limited, Night and Ultimate. The SEL Plus has been dropped. And the Night is new, offering a second, more upscale sporty model with blacked-out trim and bigger wheels that slots between the Limited and Utimate in features and price.\n\nStyling Dialed Back a Notch\n\nThe most obvious styling change is a version of Hyundai’s signature “cascading grille,” a larger mouth that brings the Tucson more in line with the look of other new Hyundais. Along with the grille comes a higher hood lip and a new bumper that make the front end look bulkier. The headlights look less stretched and now have boomerang-shaped accent lights, replacing the distinctive long slashes. The rear gets reshaped taillights and a new bumper. Available 17-, 18- and 19-inch wheels are also new; the top trims get 18s rather than 19s, which are saved for the more aggressive-looking Sport and Night.\n\nThe effect is a 2019 Tucson that’s softer and less bold than the one that debuted for 2016. It’s not like the 2015 Hyundai Sonata’s transformation from swoopy to staid, but the Tucson’s attitude quotient has been dialed back. On the styling Richter scale, the Tucson is mid-pack, with neither the high style of a 2019 Mazda CX-5 nor the aggressiveness of a redone Toyota RAV4.\n\nNo More Turbo\n\nThe base engine for the SE and Value trims has not changed: it’s a 161-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder mated to a six-speed automatic transmission. While compact SUVs increasingly feature downsized turbocharged engines, the Tucson steps back by dropping the old version’s optional 175-hp, turbocharged 1.6-liter and seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission, instead giving SEL and higher trims a conventional 181-hp, 2.4-liter four-cylinder and six-speed automatic. This powertrain first appeared in the 2018 Tucson Sport.\n\nThe new engine has a bit more horsepower but less torque — and it kicks in later: the old 1.6-liter produced 195 pounds-feet of torque starting at 1,500 rpm, while the 2.4-liter peaks at 175 pounds-feet when wound up to 4,000 rpm. While I’d never argue for less power, the new powertrain is a much better fit for the Tucson. It gives up a little pep off the line but shifts notably more smoothly around town, and mid-range acceleration for on-ramps or highway passing is adequate.\n\nThe six-speed automatic might seem an anachronism in a world of mileage-chasing eight- to 10-speed transmissions and continuously variable automatics, but the wider gear steps are a good companion for the 2.4-liter. It downshifts willingly to tap into more power, with only slight hesitation. I never caught it searching for the right gear or upshifting at the wrong time in a turn, as some of the more exotic gearboxes do. The 1.6-liter turbo had a jerkier personality on startup, and the dual-clutch automatic could be hard-shifting and balky. My only complaints about the 2.4-liter is that it exhibits some diesel-like clatter and its automatic stop-start system is a little rough (though you can turn it off).\n\nHandling feels competent and in control, though not sporty, and the steering has more weight — in a good way — than many Hyundais. The suspension is firmer and more European than some rivals, but the ride is very comfortable, competently handling rough city streets. The ride in the top trims seems more refined than in the 2018, possibly due to the switch to 18-inch wheels from the old Tucson’s 19s and their less compliant tires.\n\nGas mileage ratings for 2019 are unfortunately also anachronistic in an era when we expect increases with each model change. The 2018 Tucson was no leader as it was, and the 2019 moves in the wrong direction, with a 2 mpg decline in combined EPA estimates for the 2.4-liter versus the retired 1.6-liter. The 2019 is rated 22/28/25 mpg city/highway/combined with front-wheel drive and 21/26/23 with all-wheel drive. Compare it with the 2018 here. That’s far behind leaders like the CR-V and Nissan Rogue, whose front-wheel-drive models rate up to 28/34/30 and 26/33/29 mpg, respectively. The Tucson’s base engine is unchanged, with combined ratings of 26 (FWD) and 23 (AWD).\n\nInterior and Tech Upgraded\n\nThe interior looks familiar, with the fanciest trims still more tasteful than opulent. The big panoramic moonroof option adds airiness, and the dashboard is fully redone, with new designs for the instrument cluster, center multimedia display and controls. A 7-inch touchscreen with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay integration is standard on all but the Ultimate, which gets an 8-inch screen with navigation. The display now stands up, tablet-style, on the dash, which puts it in a better line of sight and brings it closer for the driver to hit not just the touchscreen, but also the volume and tuning knobs and the shortcut buttons that flank the screen. With the redone climate controls sitting below new air vents, the center of the dash looks cleaner and less busy. A swath of soft wrap with stitching adds a premium touch.\n\nThe 2019 Tucson switches to a standard electronic parking brake on the console. There’s a new front seat design for interiors with leather upholstery (Limited and Ultimate) that’s more supportive and comfortable on long drives. YES Essentials cloth seats are standard on other trim levels; it’s a fabric Hyundai says repels odors as well as stains.\n\nNewly available tech includes wireless phone charging, which another Cars.com editor noted  worked well even with his bulky phone case, unlike in some other vehicles. Higher trims of the 2019 also get a USB outlet for the backseat, though I still wish for another one up front to go with the solo USB media port and a pair of 12-volt outlets. The Value trim level and above get three years of free Hyundai Blue Link connectivity services, including remote start, remote lock/unlock, roadside help and stolen vehicle recovery.\n\nNew upscale options include a heated steering wheel and 360-degree camera system that was much appreciated in the city, though the image could be larger and sharper.\n\nReclining adjustments help create a backseat with comfortable room for tall adults, though the cushioning is a little stiff for my taste and the bottom cushion is a hair short for longer trips. The Ultimate adds heated outboard seats.\n\nThere are a few interior details, however, that Hyundai could add to make higher trim levels feel more competitive with top versions of some rivals. One would be paying more attention to soft-touch surfaces. That includes not just in places you touch — where there’s still too much hard plastic — but also details like soft bottoms in some of the cubbies to eliminate small-item rattling and sliding. Another thing would be a modern configurable instrument cluster display like the one in the CR-V. A Wi-Fi hot spot would be nice, too.\n\nAverage Storage and Cargo Space\n\nThe Tucson has average cabin storage for a family SUV, including a medium-sized covered bin in the center console, a large-device cubby under the dash (with power ports, USB input and optional wireless charging), a smaller cubby in front of the center cupholders, smallish door bins with space for bottles, and a slim-item cubby on the front passenger side of the center console that was just right for my iPad Mini.\n\nCargo space is where the Tucson shows its smaller footprint; it’s about 4 to 8 inches shorter than most rivals. The Tucson has 31.0 cubic feet behind the backseat and 61.9 cubic feet with the 60/40-split, folding backrests down. The space doesn’t seem small, though, and it proved adequate for several carry-on bags with the seats raised; folded, there was room for me to help a friend move. But it does come up shy of compact SUV haulers like the CR-V, which has 39.2 cubic feet with the seats up and 75.8 with them down, and the Rogue, which has 39.3/70.0 cubic feet.\n\nA two-level cargo floor can be raised to the higher position to make a flatter full-length load floor when the backseat is folded, which also leaves space to store the cargo cover out of sight. It can also be lowered about 2 inches to make space for taller or bulkier items. Optional is an excellent hands-free power liftgate; just stand next to it with the key fob in your pocket or purse and it gives three warning beeps then opens wide. It’s more convenient than rival systems that need no hands but do require you to wave your foot under the bumper.\n\nSafety and Driver-Assistance Tech Upgraded\n\nThe 2019 Tucson is an IIHS Top Safety Pick, earning top scores for crashworthiness and a superior score for the front collision system. But it missed out on the higher Top Safety Pick Plus designation due to low scores for its headlights; the LED headlights on Sport and higher trims are rated only acceptable, and the base system is rated poor. Only two models in the institute’s small SUV class, the Hyundai Kona and Mazda CX-5, earned a good headlight rating.\n\nFor 2019, all Tucson trims get a standard front collision system with automatic braking and lane-keeping assist, features previously available only for an extra cost on the top trim. The second-level Value trim adds standard blind spot warning and rear cross-traffic alert. This helps the Tucson keep up with rivals, though the 2019 Rogue and RAV4 still have more full-featured standard safety tech packages. The 2019 CR-V, however, still doesn’t offer such tech on its base model.\n\nThe Tucson also has new-for-2019 advanced safety tech options, including adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability, driver attention alert and automatic high beams. See a full list of safety features here.\n\nThe 2019 Tucson has not yet undergone a Cars.com Car Seat Check, but the previous version scored well and little of substance that would affect child seats has changed.\n\nValue Still Appeals\n\nThe 2019 Tucson starts at a competitive $24,245 — $715 higher than 2018, but with added standard safety technology. But the highlight of the Tucson’s features-for-the-dollar equation — and worth its higher price — is the mid-range SEL, which starts at $26,645 (all prices include a destination fee) with FWD. It adds upscale exterior details, features like dual-zone automatic climate control, a second USB port in back and safety tech. Plus it adds the more satisfying 2.4-liter powertrain. Compare all Tucson trim levels here.\n\nThe value equation versus rivals extends to the fully loaded Ultimate, which is $33,995 with all-wheel drive. That undercuts similarly equipped AWD compact SUVs like the top CR-V Touring at $35,195, a 2019 RAV4 Limited with the top tech package at $38,815, and a Nissan Rogue SL with the Premium Package at $34,560. The Tucson also adds peace of mind thanks to Hyundai’s warranty, which provides five years/60,000 miles of vehicle coverage and 10 years/100,000 miles of powertrain coverage.\n\nThe Tucson may not be a star in any one area, but it’s a solid compact SUV all-around. One trade-off is that it’s also a bit smaller than most, so it might appeal most to shoppers who value parking ease and maneuverability over maximum hauling capacity.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Hyundai gave its fifth-generation Accent sedan the green light for U.S. dealers, but a hatchback variant that’s available elsewhere won’t make it stateside. Hatch-o-philes can consider the redesigned Kia Rio, a platform sibling that’s available as a hatch. Compare the Accent and Rio here, or stack up the 2018 and 2017 Accent here.\n\nThe Accent comes in SE, SEL and Limited trim levels (compare them here), all with a 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine. The SE has a standard six-speed manual transmission or optional six-speed automatic; the SEL and Limited have only the automatic transmission. We evaluated a Limited and an SE manual.\n\nOutside and In\n\nThe redesigned Hyundai Accent wears its scaled-down-Elantra styling well. Even SE models have painted side mirrors and door handles, avoiding the budget-car giveaway of black plastic. Alas, the dashboard blows that cover: It’s an unremarkable dome-and-shelf routine with center controls slapped down the middle — a shape little different from any interior a decade ago. Styling is subjective, but the dashboards in a few other subcompacts — the Rio and Toyota Yaris iA spring to mind — have interesting layered designs. The Accent’s does not.\n\nThe Accent’s infotainment system is generous, at least. SE models get a 5-inch touchscreen, while SEL and Limited trims have a 7-inch unit with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. Those are nice provisions for this small-car class, especially because all versions have proper shortcut buttons, plus volume and tuning knobs. All systems have Bluetooth phone and audio streaming, plus the soon-mandatory backup camera with dynamic guidelines.\n\nMost controls feel weighty and secure, and SEL and Limited trims have a padded center armrest, but quality is otherwise spartan. The seats have rough-hewn cloth upholstery even in Limited models, and a mess of hard, shiny plastic surrounds them. Shoppers on a shoestring budget need not accept such limitations: The Yaris iA and Ford Fiesta, for example, have notably higher quality.\n\nAgreeable Road Manners\n\nLike the Rio, the Accent has generous ride comfort on its standard 15-inch wheels and high-profile P185/65R15 tires. The 17-inch wheels and P205/45R17 tires on Limited trim levels introduce some busyness and road noise over uneven surfaces, but the effect is well short of harsh. It’s controlled, too, with little bouncing or floatiness over broken pavement, but it doesn’t stay that way if you add weight — especially over the rear axle. Our Limited test car rode a touch firmer with two adults aboard, but a third adult in the backseat turned ride quality downright harsh, with choppy suspension response over bumps of all sizes.\n\nAt least the new Accent’s pint-size four-cylinder is up to the task, with immediate accelerator response up front. And the 1.6-liter (130 horsepower, 119 pounds-feet of torque) delivers enough power at city speeds to sustain the oomph even with multiple adults aboard. Driving solo, highway passing is acceptable, if noisy — both from engine and wind noise. The six-speed automatic downshifts quickly, though it sometimes hunts for gears before settling on the right one.\n\nThe manual transmission has medium throws, a large shift knob and a light clutch. For parents who want to teach three-pedal driving to their teenage children — more for character-building than practical application at this point — the Hyundai Accent’s stick is a quick learn, though it comes at a slight mileage penalty: 31 mpg combined in EPA ratings, versus 32 mpg with the automatic. Both figures are class-competitive.\n\nSteering is free of the prior Accent’s numb feedback, and its quick ratio evokes the Yaris iA or Honda Fit. Modest body roll limits the fun, but road-holding is impressive with the Limited trim’s wider Continental tires, which stave off eventual understeer to impressive limits. Not so with the skinnier rubber on the SE and SEL (also Continentals). For all their benefit to ride comfort, they slide early and often.\n\nValue and Safety\nFinal Thoughts\n\nI suspect many shoppers will cross-shop the Accent with its Kia sibling, which comes in both sedan and hatchback forms. The hatch has a roomier backseat versus the Accent’s cramped bench, but the Accent gets more equipment in top trim levels. Few shoppers will benefit from that, however: Hyundai officials expect more than half of all Accent shoppers to buy the SE and just 10 percent to get the Limited.\n\nIn a value-conscious group like subcompacts, the 2018 Accent is acceptable in many ways and impressive in a few. That may not overcome shopper sentiment against a class that’s under steady sales decline. But if you’re among the shrinking group of consumers who want an entry-level sedan — and if you’ve read this far, I suspect you are — the new Hyundai Accent is worth a look.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "There’s a difference between cheap and inexpensive.\n\nThe Hyundai Excel, the first offering for the U.S. from the South Korean automaker in the 1986 model year, was cheap–$4,995\n\nThe Hyundai Accent, the model that replaced Excel in the 1995 model year, is inexpensive–$9,999.\n\nExcel was small, cramped and seemed to be held together with duct tape. Accent is larger, roomier and bolted together well.\n\nExcel was a low-cost new-car alternative to a used car. Accent is a low-cost new-car alternative to a new Toyota or Honda.\n\nBut while Accent is far better than its predecessor, you still have to accept some compromises. This is, after all, an entry-level machine aimed at attracting first-time buyers as well as those consumers more concerned with high mileage and low monthly payments than with having the most fashionable car in the parking lot.\n\nWhile one of Accent’s strong points, for example, is a lot of standard equipment considering the low base price, one of its shortcomings is that you still can’t add the full complement of desired equipment even if you are willing to spend more money.\n\nAccent is offered in coupe and sedan versions. We tested the entry-level Accent GL hatchback coupe dressed in sporty GT trim, a package not offered since the 1997 model year, that boosts the base price to $10,899.\n\nThe standard equipment list is impressive for an entry-level car–air conditioning, front- and side-impact air bags, fully independent suspension, all-season radials, AM/FM radio with cassette, body-colored side moldings/grille, digital clock, tinted glass and rear window washer/wiper.\n\nTo equip it as most would for convenience and safety, however, takes another $400 to add power windows, locks and mirrors and a sound system upgrade to AM/FM stereo with CD player.\n\nBut you can’t equip it to the max. Anti-lock brakes with traction control, sunroof and remote keyless entry are three items you can’t obtain through the factory.\n\nSide air bags are nice, but ABS with traction control would be better in helping you avoid situations that would require bag deployment.\n\nPower windows are nice, but a sunroof would help circulate the air even better and eliminate the wind noise coming through Accent’s side windows.\n\nHaving to lock/unlock the doors by inserting a key and turning rather than pressing the button on the fob is simply primitive today. When carrying a couple of packages and having to balance them while getting to the key or when parked in a dimly lit lot, remote keyless entry helps relieve a lot of unnecessary burden, not to mention stress and anxiety.\n\nThe 1.6-liter 4-cylinder is ideal for the mileage minded. The 29 m.p.g. city/33 m.p.g. highway rating with the standard 5-speed manual reduces the number of stops for fuel. Automatic runs an extra $650 and is rated at 25 m.p.g. city/35 m.p.g. highway.\n\nB ut the 1.6-liter is rated at only 104 horsepower and 106 foot-pounds of torque. Accent GT looks sporty thanks to its body-colored rocker-panel moldings and deck-lid spoiler. But the 4-cylinder is meant for mileage, not muscle.\n\nAnd, as with all 4-cylinder engines, you have to accept that it isn’t the quietest powerplant on the planet. Four-cylinder engines tend to transmit the audible commotion back into the cabin, especially at takeoff. And the 5-speed manual is a bit notchy.\n\nAccent has four-wheel independent suspension and front and rear stabilizer bars, but thanks to the upgrade to a stiffer sports-tuned suspension when you opt for the $495 GT package, the ride is a little firm and you’ll feel most of the imperfections in the road. Of course, that’s a compromise you have to accept in a $10,899 car.\n\nAccent comes with 13-inch radials as standard, 14-inch when you opt for the GT package. Have to suspect 15-inch radials would offer better handling, but anything to avoid teeny 13-inch radials is an improvement. Handling is typical for an economy car–little lean, little sway. Back off on the accelerator pedal when the road starts to twist sharply.\n\nThe Accent coupe is a hatchback. The cargo hold is rather large and well suited to haul gear or groceries. If you need more space, the split rear seat backs fold. After reaching for the release button from the rear cargo hold, however, you have to fiddle to get the shoulder belts on the seat backs out of the way so you can lower them.\n\nThe seats are comfortable and covered in cloth with a blue/red/green/purple speckle design that helps camouflage spills until you can clean them up–like at trade-in time.\n\nThe front seats in this two-door fold and slide forward to expose a rather large aisle to get in the back seat. Once in back, however, room is a bit tight for head and legs.\n\nCouple of nice touches are the remote fuel-filler door release alongside the driver’s seat, small coin tray in the center console and dual retractable cupholders that pop out of the dash. One cupholder in the back of the center console serves the two rear-seat passengers.\n\nSales of the entry-level subcompact Accent in ’03 through March are down to 13,225 from 19,350 a year earlier, while sales of the larger compact Elantra are up to 15,000 units from 12,500 a year earlier.\n\nOne reason for the shortfall is that the subcompact, front-wheel-drive Accent, priced from $9,999 to $11,700, offers a $1,000 rebate, and the compact, front-wheel-drive Elantra, priced from $12,900 to $15,300, offers a $1,500 rebate.\n\nAnother reason is that Elantra offers power windows/locks/mirrors as standard and ABS with traction control ($525) and power moonroof ($650) as options.\n\nAccent also is losing some sales to those migrating into the compact Santa Fe sport-utility vehicle. Santa Fe’s price range is $17,500 to $24,000, but for the first time it carries a $1,000 rebate, bringing in more buyers. Santa Fe sales have climbed to 23,354 through March from 17,870 a year earlier.\n\nNext month, by the way, Santa Fe adds the 3.5-liter, 195-h.p. V-6 in the Hyundai XG350 sedan as a companion to the 2.7-liter, 173-h.p. V-6 now offered. The big difference, however, should be launch off the line, with the 3.5-liter rated at 219 foot-pounds of torque versus 182 foot-pounds in the 2.7-liter.\n\nHyundai said the typical Accent buyer is a parent purchasing a car for the college student; the empty-nester/retiree purchasing a low-cost car to haul behind the motor home; or the consumer who wants to spend the minimum to invest the money saved in hobbies or toys.\n\nStrictly personal: Birthday greetings to granddaughter Taylor Brae, who is celebrating No. 3.\n\nTEST DRIVE\n\n’03 Hyundai Accent GL\n\nWheelbase: 96.1 inc hes\n\nLength: 166.7 inches\n\nEngine: 1.6-liter, 104-h.p., 16-valve 4-cylinder\n\nTransmission: 5-speed manual\n\nFuel economy: 29 m.p.g. city/33 m.p.g. highway\n\nBase price: $10,899.\n\nPrice as tested: $11,859. Includes $400 for popular equipment package that includes power windows/door locks/mirrors, and AM/FM stereo with CD and six speakers; $495 GT package with sport tuned suspension, sport cloth seats, two tone leather wrapped steering wheel, white face gauges, 14-inch six spoke alloy wheels, body colored rocker moldings, front fog lamps, body color rear spoiler, and GT badging; $65 carpeted floor mats; and $495 freight.\n\nPluses: Low cost, high mileage, stylish coupe. Just about everything available on this economy model that you’ll find on coupes with more prestigious nameplates.\n\nMinuses: Four-cylinder tad noisy, five speed a little notchy, have to fight belts to lower rear seat backs.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nHyundai’s least-expensive model receives a handful of new interior features, including an upgraded stereo, for 2008. Available in hatchback and sedan body styles, the Accent competes with economy cars like the Chevrolet Aveo, Nissan Versa and Toyota Yaris.\n\nThe Accent earned a substantial redesign for 2006. Now in its third generation, the compact car comes standard with six airbags — which strangely did not prevent last year’s model from being rated Poor in side-impact crash tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.\n\nA 1.6-liter four-cylinder produces 110 horsepower. Power rack-and-pinion steering is standard. Sister company Kia sells the Rio, a car that shares many components with the Accent. Both models include a 10-year, 100,000-mile drivetrain warranty, one of the industry’s longest.\n\nExterior\nHyundai says the Accent’s crisp modern lines, distinctive halogen headlights, and larger wheels and tires make this version more elegant than its predecessor. The base GS hatchback has black side mirrors and door handles; those parts are body-colored on the SE hatchback and GLS sedan.\n\nGS and SE hatchbacks sport a fairly typical wedge shape, but with telltale Hyundai curves. Standard steel wheels hold 14-inch tires. The GLS sedan has optional 15-inch alloy wheels, while the SE hatchback has 16-inch alloys and a sport-tuned suspension.\n\nInterior\nUp to five occupants can fit inside the Accent, which has 1.5 inches more rear legroom than before. Front headroom is 0.7 inches greater as well. Cargo space totals 12.4 cubic feet in the sedan and 15.9 cubic feet in the hatchback. Every door panel contains a bottle holder and storage pockets.\n\nFor 2008, GLS and SE models have restyled gauges. Later in the year, the CD stereo in both cars will add an auxiliary jack for MP3 players, as well as XM Satellite Radio with three months’ free service. The base GL hatchback doesn’t have a CD player, so be prepared to warble your own tunes.\n\nStandard equipment includes a tilt steering wheel and an eight-way driver’s seat with an adjustable armrest. The GLS sedan and SE hatchback add air conditioning, front seatback pockets and dual vanity mirrors. A folding backseat armrest with cupholders is also included — a rare feature in this class. An available Convenience Package adds power windows, power door locks with keyless entry and heated power mirrors, items that are standard in the SE hatchback.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Accent’s 110-hp, 1.6-liter four-cylinder features continuously variable valve timing and develops 107 pounds-feet of torque. Either a five-speed manual transmission or an optional four-speed automatic can be installed. SE models with the manual have a sport shifter from B&M Racing.\n\nSafety\nSeat-mounted side-impact airbags and side curtain airbags are standard across all trim levels. Front seat belt pretensioners and load limiters are installed, and all seating positions have adjustable head restraints. Four-wheel-disc antilock brakes are standard on the SE hatchback. ABS is optional for the GLS sedan and unavailable in the GS hatchback.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nAvailable in base GL, GS and sporty SE two-door hatchbacks or a GLS four-door sedan, the Accent competes with economy cars like the Chevrolet Aveo, Nissan Versa and Toyota Yaris. This subcompact car comes standard with six airbags and a 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine. All models include a 10-year, 100,000-mile limited powertrain warranty.\n\nNew for 2011\n\nThe base Accent hatchback is now designated GL instead of Blue, and the base price on the SE has been trimmed by $800 by deleting a power sunroof from the standard equipment.\n\n\nExterior\n\nThe Accent GL has black side mirrors and door handles; those parts are body-colored on other trims.\n\nExterior features include:\n\nAvailable power mirrors\n14- or 16-inch wheels\nStandard rear window defroster\nAvailable rear window wiper\nOptional ground-effects kit and alloy fuel door\nAvailable fog lights\n\n \n\nInterior\n\nAll automatic Accents have an “Eco indicator” that tells drivers when they are being very fuel efficient (green), moderately efficient (yellow) and less efficient (red). Manual models have a shift indicator that tells drivers the best time to shift gears for improved fuel economy. Up to five occupants can fit inside the Accent. Air conditioning is standard on all but the GL trim, where it’s optional. Every door panel contains a bottleholder and storage pockets. Power windows, power door locks with keyless entry and power mirrors are optional on the GS and SE hatchbacks and GLS sedan.\n\nInterior features include:\n\nAvailable tilt steering wheel and six-way driver’s seat with adjustable armrest\n60/40-split folding rear seat\nStandard audio system with CD player, iPod, USB and MP3 jacks (except GL)\nAvailable cruise control\n\n \n\nUnder the Hood\n\nFor 2010, all Accents received lower-friction engine components, low-rolling-resistance tires and other tweaks to improve mileage. The engines and transmissions are unchanged for 2011.\n\nMechanical features include:\n\n110-horsepower, 1.6-liter four-cylinder with 106 pounds-feet of torque\nContinuously variable valve timing\nFive-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission\nSE models with manual transmission have B&M Racing sport shifter\n\n \n\nSafety\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes are optional, except for the GL trim.\n\nStandard features for all models include:\n\nFront seat-mounted side-impact airbags\nRoof-mounted side curtain airbags for both rows of seats\nFront seat belt pretensioners",
