      "expert_review": "The verdict: The first affordable electric SUV without a defining flaw, the Ioniq 5 has a comfortable ride and plenty of space — and it’s relatively simple to operate — but some of its best features can be had only on the Limited trim level for thousands of dollars more. As of its launch, the Ioniq 5 is on sale in 26 states.\n\nVersus the competition: Even at its worst, the Ioniq 5 is average in its class, with a low tow rating and a need for more real buttons on the dashboard, but it shines when it comes to occupant and cargo room, ride quality and overall efficiency. At compatible DC fast-charging stations, it also charges faster than almost all its competitors.\n\nI’ve been waiting for an electric vehicle like the 2022 Hyundai Ioniq 5. It’s the first of several new affordable SUV-ish models that doesn’t have a defining shortcoming: The Ford Mustang Mach-E doesn’t ride well and has dismal brake-pedal feel, the Volkswagen ID.4 is plagued by an overabundance of touch-sensitive controls, and the Volvo XC40 Recharge’s underlying inefficiency diminishes its range and charging speed. The Tesla Model Y rides too firmly for some roads, has no instrument panel and is no longer eligible for a federal tax credit. (If the Model Y seems higher-priced than the others mentioned here, it’s partly because Tesla sells direct and actually raises its list prices. Not reflected in the other models’ MSRPs is the higher transaction prices that are also happening for those vehicles.)\n\nWe do have some bones to pick with the Ioniq 5; they just aren’t as big — individually or combined — as the ones mentioned above. Just so you’re aware, one drawback that stands out is the fact that the Ioniq 5’s cabin can’t be preconditioned when it’s connected to a charger if you remote-start using the key fob. (The heating or air conditioning does activate when not attached to the charger.) In order to carry out this important step, which helps preserve battery power for driving range before departing, you must use a smartphone app and Bluelink subscription — complimentary for only three years then $198 per year afterward (or as little as $93.67 per year if you pay three years in advance). Presumably you can program the car to precondition for a planned departure while it’s plugged in, but any unplanned trip requires Bluelink. Hyundai has done this kind of thing for years with its gas-powered cars, but now that it has remote-start on its remotes, preconditioning should work forever, for free. It’s a cornerstone of electric motoring, and Nissan, to name one brand, has maintained the functionality free, even on older Leafs.\n\nNote that the Ioniq 5 and new 2022 Kia EV6 weren’t available for thorough evaluation when we were deciding on our Best Electric Vehicle of 2022, which we granted to the Model Y. Cars.com is preparing to include all these models in a comprehensive multi-vehicle comparison test that will reveal more, but after my time with the Ioniq 5, it seems a strong candidate for next year’s award deliberations. We’ve already called it out as a Top EV Pick for families.\n\nVersions & Ranges\nIs It an SUV?\nHow It Drives\nGood Usability, Minimal Sacrifice\nThe Cabin\nCargo\nCharging\nEV as Backup Power\nWhat’s Wrong With It\n\nVersions & Ranges\n\nThe Ioniq 5 comes in SE, SEL and Limited trim levels. We tested a Limited with all-wheel drive, which is optional on all trims (rear-wheel drive is standard). If you want the Ioniq 5’s longest range, you’ll have to stick with RWD, which brings an EPA-estimated 303-mile range in favorable conditions. AWD drops the range to an estimated 256 miles. Not noted on this comparison on the EPA site is a “standard-range” RWD Ioniq 5, which has a smaller battery but is not sold in the U.S. Corporate sibling Kia does offer two battery sizes here for the Ioniq 5’s sister model, the EV6.\n\nAs of launch, the 2022 Ioniq 5 is only a bit more widely available than its predecessor. It’s offered in 26 states, including Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Maryland, Maine, Missouri, North Carolina, New Jersey, New Mexico, Nevada, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin.\n\nIs It an SUV?\n\nWhether a given model is an SUV, wagon, hatchback or something else is a tiresome argument that can be decided only by the individual, but nowadays the point is for vehicles to offer what we like about SUVs: a hatch rather than a trunk, a bit more size and versatility than a sedan, and optional AWD. The Ioniq 5 checks all these boxes.\n\nPersonally, I also focus on ground clearance because it matters to people who buy SUVs and/or AWD for use in snow, and the quest for aerodynamics sometimes leads EV manufacturers to use low-slung chin spoilers and other provisions that improve efficiency but hinder passage over snow. The Ioniq 5’s ground clearance is listed as 6.1 inches — better than the Mustang Mach-E’s 5.7 inches but lower than the Model Y’s 6.6 inches and the XC40 Recharge’s 6.9 inches.\n\nI happened to drive the Ioniq 5 during a snowstorm, and when I stood on the brake a couple of times, the car kept rolling too far for comfort while the antilock brakes chattered away. People usually blame this on brakes, but the way the car felt overall suggested the 20-inch Michelin Primacy Tour all-season tires (size 255/45R20), which are standard on the Limited, were a bit lacking. Tirerack.com shows a Winter/Snow rating of 7.7 for these tires, which seems decent, but three models in this competitive set are rated better (and they cost less), while just one has a lower rating.\n\nThe standard 19-inch wheels on the Ioniq 5’s lower trim levels also appear to come with Michelin tires, named Primacy (versus Primacy Tour), but we haven’t driven them.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThe biggest news here is that the Ioniq 5 rides comfortably, even with the Limited trim level’s needlessly large 20-inch wheels. For some reason, most affordable EVs ride firmly or poorly, though that’s starting to improve. The EV6 is among the exceptions, as is the ID.4 — despite a short wheelbase that can make a compliant ride more difficult to achieve. The Ioniq 5’s 118-inch wheelbase is 9 inches longer than the VW’s and roughly 4 inches longer than the Kia’s. This doesn’t do its turning diameter any favors: It’s 39.3 feet — versus the EV6’s 38.2 and the ID.4’s 31.5 (RWD) or 36.4 feet (AWD) — and you feel it in ordinary parking maneuvers.\n\nAs for handling, the Ioniq 5 felt good but not great, but it should be noted that the roads were — at best — cold and coated with salt during our evaluation period. The rear motor is rated 225 horsepower with RWD. With optional AWD it’s 221 hp, plus a front motor rated 99 hp, but the car tends to feel more like a front-drive vehicle when pushed hard through turns. It’s the same feeling we got from the ID.4, probably for the same reason: With so much torque in the rear, it would be too easy to spin out if the powertrain didn’t apportion output conservatively.\n\nFor what it’s worth, if you want sporty, the EV6 is definitely sportier … looking. You’ll probably see lots of reports about the EV6 being the sporty choice of the two, but our initial reaction is that the sister models drive similarly despite the Kia’s appearance and shorter wheelbase.\n\n2022 Hyundai Ioniq 5 drive mode indicator | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nThe Ioniq 5 is quick — as good as 0-60 mph in less than 5 seconds with AWD — but only in the right driving mode. The car’s modes include Normal, Eco, Sport and Snow, and they’re all reasonably well-designed, with the exception of Eco mode, which doesn’t allow full acceleration off the line even if you floor it. It’s a mistake on Hyundai’s part; Eco modes always dull the go-pedal, even in gas-powered cars, but they usually let loose if the accelerator hits the floor. Withholding power that drivers might expect from a car based on its other modes sure seems like a safety hazard. Imagine you’re trying to dive into traffic or turn left from a stop with oncoming vehicles bearing down, only to find Eco mode has turned your hare into a tortoise.\n\nI was most impressed with the number and execution of the Ioniq 5’s regenerative-braking levels. These vary the degree of deceleration when you lift off the accelerator, at which point the drive motors instantaneously serve as generators, returning energy to the battery pack. I teased Volkswagen for having just two regen levels in the ID.4 because it’s just programming; why not go crazy and have three? Well, Hyundai went crazy. The steering-wheel paddles let you select among four levels (Lv0 to Lv3), with Lv3 providing the most regen of the four, but then one more click activates i-Pedal. This is Hyundai’s one-pedal operation, requiring almost no use of the brake pedal in normal driving, even down to a complete stop. (Why i-Pedal isn’t just called Lv4 is a question for Nigel Tufnel of Spinal Tap.)\n\nBut wait, there’s more: Hold the right-hand paddle a few seconds and you’ll activate an Auto setting that uses sensors to adjust the regen based on following distance and slope. And if all this isn’t enough, when coasting in one of the Lv settings you can hold the left-hand paddle to add some deceleration, like a hand brake would.\n\nOnce you figure it out, it’s good to have this many options. Whenever I switch to a gas-powered vehicle, I’m reminded of the wasted energy an EV would be recapturing every time I step on the brake pedal.\n\nGood Usability, Minimal Sacrifice\n\nThe Ioniq 5’s interior design is certainly different — as some people think is required of an EV — but fortunately it doesn’t go off the deep end and become unusable in the process. To the contrary, it’s among the simplest EVs to operate. Unlike the Model Y, the Ioniq 5 has a dedicated instrument panel, and unlike the Mach-E’s, it’s large and displays a lot of information, including battery percentage and projected range, which varies with temperature and driving mode — which it also displays. (Tesla’s insistence on showing best-case range on the top-level display remains one of our biggest complaints.)\n\nThe center section of the Hyundai’s screen shows a wealth of other selectable information, and the Limited trim adds a blind spot view monitor, which displays a camera view of either blind spot when you activate the corresponding turn signal. This trim level also adds a Surround View Monitor that displays many different perspectives, but on the touchscreen. Thankfully, outward visibility is pretty good overall — much better than in the EV6, though the lack of a rear window wiper on both is regrettable.\n\nThe Ioniq 5’s 12.3-inch central touchscreen, which looks like a twin of the driver’s display, is simple enough to use. It’s supplemented by rows of mechanical and touch-sensitive buttons farther down — more than the Model Y but still not as many as we’d like. For one thing, controls for the heated seats and steering wheel (the latter feature is excluded from the SE trim level) are in a touchscreen submenu, which is a gaffe. These features are too important in an EV not to be at least top-level, and real buttons would be best. (See how the EV6 solves this problem in What’s Really the Difference Between the Hyundai Ioniq 5 and Kia EV6.) Regardless of the vehicle, heated seats are frequently fussed with and should be controllable by an unfamiliar passenger without the driver’s help. That’s not the case in the Ioniq 5, where you have to use the touchscreen or a touch-sensitive button labeled “warmer” to bring up the appropriate menu.\n\nThough we don’t care for the touch-sensitive buttons Hyundai has adopted across its lineup, they didn’t cause me as much trouble here as this type of button often does, even with gloves on. (But they still need to go.)\n\nThe touchscreen system supports wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Hyundai said it’s investigating whether existing vehicles will be upgradable to wireless versions of these smartphone interfaces but had no answers as of this writing. As usual in Hyundais, Android Auto doesn’t use the full width of the display. I don’t object to it as much as some simply because I don’t see the advantage of a widescreen map, which is my primary use of the feature.\n\nThe head-up display that’s included in the Limited is impressively large and full-featured. Among other info, it indicates when a vehicle is in your blind spot, putting that info closer to the driver’s line of sight than most such monitors. It even has augmented-reality-style arrows that appear to show you upcoming turns when using the built-in navigation system (but not with Apple or Google Maps). It’s similar to what we’ve seen in luxury vehicles.\n\nThe Interior\n\n \n\nThis long-awaited class is already delivering roomier interiors than we’ve had in past affordable plug-ins, and the Ioniq 5 takes it even further. In addition to its competitive front headroom and legroom dimensions, the lack of a conventional center console extending toward the dashboard leaves plenty of room for a purse, backpack or what have you. The console between the Ioniq 5’s front seats leaves plenty of open space, and the armrest raises most of the way. In the Limited trim level, the console can slide backward; without this feature, the armrest doesn’t raise quite far enough to get completely out of the way if you prefer a no-armrest space. The downsides to the Ioniq’s wide-open approach are less enclosed storage, the wireless smartphone charging pad being farther from reach and, as mentioned above, you lose some surfaces that could be home to needed buttons, as illustrated in the EV6.\n\nThe backseat is even more generous, with 39.4 inches of legroom, beating the Ford (38.1), Kia (39) and VW (37.6). The seat slides to apportion space where you need it — backseat or cargo area. Once again, the Limited trim level has exclusive features back here that lower trims don’t, including integrated side window shades and adjustable outboard head restraints. The available panoramic glass moonroof makes the backseat seem even roomier, which is an advantage over the Model Y and its opaque powered sunshade.\n\nCargo Space\n\nThe cargo area is quite generous. By our measurements — which don’t match manufacturer-supplied specifications but are more consistent from one brand to another — the Ioniq 5 has 19.1 cubic feet of cargo volume behind the backseat with that seat slid all the way back for maximum passenger space. That beats the ID.4, at 18.9 cubic feet. This is thanks in part to the Hyundai’s underfloor space, which we count in all cases because we know you use it. The two-row Model Y, however, wins, with 20.9 cubic feet behind its backseat.\n\nPeople are charmed by front trunks, and the Ioniq 5 has one, at least in name; it’s a clamshell box you might mistake for an engine (motor) cover. It’s probably big enough for a 120-volt trickle charger but not a lot else. It didn’t bother me that you have to pull the hood release to access it, given it’s a barely usable space. Frunks that provide legitimate space, like the Mach-E’s 2-cubic-foot frunk, deserve a key-fob release. Note, however, that even with its frunk and hatch combined, the Ford’s 17.9 cubic feet of cargo volume doesn’t match the Ioniq 5, and total space is what matters.\n\nFor those keeping score, the Model Y’s frunk adds 2.3 more cubic feet to the 20.9 cubic feet behind its backseat.\n\nCharging\n\nFrom many perspectives, the Ioniq 5 charges quickly, though I’d resist hyperventilating over its DC fast charging just yet. Overall its approach is solid, and it’s great to have a motorized charge-port door (like on Teslas) because you will inevitably leave this door open by accident; it closes automatically when you put the car into Drive or Reverse, saving you from having to get back out of the car when you see an instrument panel warning. (Even if you’ve never left a fuel-filler door open, perhaps using this one daily is what makes it inevitable.)\n\nWhat matters most is home charging, where the Ioniq 5 is rated to accept 10.9 kilowatts, in line with the ID.4 (11 kW) and Mach-E (10.5). For me, the car’s instrument panel showed well above 11.0 kW while charging. This means you’ll maximize your charging speed with a 48-amp Level 2 charger, which requires a 240-volt, 60-amp circuit breaker. (If your home’s service is limited to 100 amps, you’ll probably either have to get by with a less-powerful charger or spring for a costly service upgrade; see our guide to chargers and our experience outfitting six different houses.) On its own, this aspect of the Ioniq 5 is great.\n\nHow much this juice translates to miles of range depends on your drivetrain, because there’s an uncommonly wide efficiency gap between RWD and AWD versions: 114 and 98 mpg-equivalent, respectively, according to the EPA. Apart from costing you less per mile, higher efficiency means you add more miles of range per hour of charging than with a lower-rated vehicle, all other factors being equal. The Ioniq 5’s mpg-e ratings are pretty high in the field of all 2021-22 EV models, (though not as good as the Model Y’s), continuing what we saw in the Hyundai Ioniq EV sold primarily in California and other zero-emissions-vehicle states from 2017-21. The Ioniq 5 isn’t as stellar as its predecessor, even with RWD, partly because the new model is more of an SUV than a car. We know from our experience with the 2021-22 XC40 Recharge that an over-the-air update can increase a vehicle’s efficiency and range, so perhaps that will happen someday for the AWD version of the Ioniq 5.\n\nAt its best, the AWD Ioniq 5 added more than 30 miles of range per hour of charging. I suspect that the full 11 kW would have translated to roughly 40 mph in the more-efficient rear-drive version.\n\nAs for public DC fast charging, the Ioniq 5 and EV6 get credit for being the first affordable 800-volt EVs on the market (they’re technically 697 volts, according to the specs, but the point is that a nominal 400 volts is more common). That designation promises faster charging due to lower resistance when exploiting a powerful-enough charger — 250 kW or higher (likely to mean 350 kW at a station).\n\nIn one trial, the Ioniq 5 charged faster than any EV we’ve tested but still didn’t come close to Hyundai’s “as good as” claims of going from 10%-80% in 18 minutes, perhaps because it was 53 degrees out. In 18 minutes, we added 38% (93 miles of range). Our Detroit editor did better on a day that was about 12 degrees warmer, adding 160 miles of range in 16 minutes. We’ll take the advancement happily, but the effects of weather and countless other mostly uncontrollable factors, both detectable and mysterious, always seem to make fast charging any EV a dissatisfying experience — and anything other than home charging unviable for potential buyers.\n\nEV as Backup Power\n\nAs Ford learned — or taught — by putting up to 7.2 kW of optional power in the bed of its F-150 hybrid, adding value can make a technology more attractive. The upcoming F-150 Lightning fully electric pickup will do the same by upping the output closer to 10 kW and providing automatic home backup power for anyone willing to foot the installation bill.\n\nThe Ioniq 5 doesn’t go quite that far, but it and the EV6 are the first EVs to provide high-current outlets that can power appliances or tools and provide backup power in an emergency, so long as you’re willing to run some extension cords.\n\nThe Limited has one household outlet under the backseat and an adapter that plugs into the charging port to provide another 120-volt outlet. This feature is currently called Vehicle-to-Load, but that’s likely to change because it’s a terrible name. “Load” is the proper technical term for anything that uses power, but it’s probably not how you speak. (Maybe that’s why the TV commercial where Jason Bateman is camping calls it “two-way charging,” which is a nice try but far from precise. Is running a hibachi and some lights really “charging?”)\n\nThese aren’t the dinky outlets in the back of your minivan, which are probably limited to 160 watts and good enough only for a laptop or maybe a game console. The Ioniq’s outside outlet is rated at 15 amps, which means 1,800 watts. The owner’s manual says the interior one is 16 amps, so that’s 1,920 watts. (Household outlets in North America are 120 volts and usually 15 or 20 amps.) I had no trouble with a 12-amp circular saw, but a 15-amp Makita sander worked only every third try because it draws too much current when it first starts up — something the owner’s manual warns about. No problem; the Ioniq 5 reset after every failure and was ready to go again.\n\nCompare this with my Honda backup generator and its 3,000 peak-watts rating, and the appeal of an EV with over 3,700 watts of totally silent backup power is apparent. The only downside is that only the outside outlet is weather-resistant. Also, the inside one requires the car to be on and, presumably, a window to be open enough for a fat extension cord to pass through.\n\nWhat’s Wrong With It\n\nNo vehicle is perfect, and we did have some issues in the Ioniq 5. Some have already been mentioned, but there are a few more.\n\n2022 Hyundai Ioniq 5 Limited | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nThe aerodynamic, flush door handles, which motor out when you unlock the doors — or simply when you approach the car, depending on the setting you choose — didn’t do so well in snow and freezing rain, which kept one from emerging and some others from retracting once out. Still, they’re much better overall than the manual versions in the Model Y, which baffle unfamiliar passengers and also tend to get frozen shut.\n\nAlso, the cabin is slow to warm up. The AWD Ioniq has a heat pump — a technology with a reputation for pokiness in residential applications — and perhaps that’s the issue, but our Model Y also has a heat pump and gets the job done much faster. We haven’t tested a RWD Ioniq 5, which has conventional, resistive heat.\n\nAnother problem lies in the fact that many desirable features are available only on the Limited trim level. These include:\n\nPanoramic moonroof\nVentilated front seats (heated are standard)\nMemory driver’s seat\nFully reclining driver’s seat\nAdjustable head restraints for outboard rear seats\nBose premium audio\nHead-up display\nSliding function for center console\nRear side window sun shades\nVehicle-to-Load\nSmartphone as key\n360-degree cameras\nBlind spot view monitor\nParking Assist & Remote Smart Parking Assist (to move the vehicle from outside using your key fob or smartphone app)\n\nAt $51,845 (MSRP plus destination charge before any incentives), the Limited costs $4,700 more than the SEL. The cost isn’t necessarily a problem thanks to all that’s included, but the inability to select only the features you want a la carte, for less money, is a downer.\n\nAnother downer is that the Hyundai Ioniq 5’s already-limited supply is subject to the one-two-three punch of a longstanding inventory shortage, increased EV interest due to record gas prices and the vehicle’s unquestionable desirability. If you manage to find one close to MSRP plus destination, don’t hesitate.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "We’re fans of the Hyundai Ioniq 5, naming it our Best Electric Vehicle of 2023, but that doesn’t mean it’s perfect (we haven’t found one yet, but we’ll let you know when we do), and it’s just one of a number of all-electric SUVs you can buy. We use the term SUV loosely here; many of these EVs could be mistaken for mid-size hatchbacks, but since Americans are largely allergic to hatchbacks, SUVs they are.\n\nRelated: Hyundai Ioniq 5 Vs. Tesla Model Y: Functional Vs. Funky\n\nThe Ford Mustang Mach-E is another one of these hatchback-like SUVs, and it’s also a Cars.com award winner; it took home 2021 Best Eco-Friendly Car honors in its debut year. The Mustang Mach-E gets some updates for 2023, including the latest version of Ford’s BlueCruise hands-free driving system, which can now perform lane changes.\n\nWe recently tested both of these EVs in Chicago and its suburbs, driving them back to back and testing both Level 2 home charging and DC fast-charging performance. The testing revealed key differences between the two EVs, as well as who they might be best suited for. You can see what we liked (and disliked) about each below, or check out the related video where we discuss both EVs at length.\n\nRelated Video:\n\n2023 Ford Mustang Mach-E Premium AWD\n\nThe verdict: If you’re looking for a sportier EV, live somewhere with smooth roads or spend a lot of time driving on the highway, the Ford Mustang Mach-E’s handling attributes and hands-free driving system will be appealing, but beware its extremely firm ride.\n\nAs-tested price: $58,795 (including destination, but not counting federal tax credit of up to $3,750)\nEPA-rated combined efficiency: 92 mpg-equivalent\nEPA-rated range: 290 miles\nMiles of range added in 1 hour on 48-amp Level 2 home charger: 30\nMiles of range per minute at DC fast charger: 4.7\nThe Good\n\nHandling: It’s fun to toss the Mustang Mach-E into a corner — the SUV stays flat, composed and doesn’t complain — but its steering doesn’t offer any road feel, which limits overall driver engagement. The car will tolerate your antics, but it doesn’t urge you to push it even harder.\n\nHands-free driving system: Ford’s BlueCruise is a confidence-inspiring system that doesn’t make decisions that leave the driver second-guessing it, though it is better suited to stretches of open highway rather than the busy, sometimes hectic interstates near urban centers. The new lane-changing feature controlled by the turn signal stalk is a helpful addition.\n\nInterior quality: The Mustang Mach-E’s interior features solid build quality and materials that look and feel nice (aside from the faux carbon fiber on the dashboard, which is cheap-looking). Door panel materials and other soft-touch trim in the front of the cabin carry through to the rear seating area, which doesn’t see a drop-off in quality. Overall, the cabin feels just a bit nicer than the Ioniq 5’s.\n\nTouchscreen functionality: While climate controls that appear on a touchscreen still aren’t our first choice, Ford does it better than most on the Mustang Mach-E’s vertically oriented 15.5-inch touchscreen; the controls persist at the bottom of the screen regardless of what’s appearing in the top two-thirds. The touchscreen’s menus for audio and navigation are straightforward, too, though it’d be nice to have a direct tune feature for satellite radio as there is for FM radio. AM radio, alas, is absent.\n\nConnectivity: The Sync 4A infotainment system includes wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, and there are USB-A and USB-C ports if you prefer a wired connection. Wireless CarPlay is easy to set up, and CarPlay uses the majority of the touchscreen’s real estate above the climate controls.\n\nFront trunk: Unlike the Ioniq 5’s front storage bin that’s so small, it’s of questionable value, the Mustang Mach-E has a proper front trunk that enhances utility; the frunk adds another 2 cubic feet of cargo space, according to Cars.com’s cargo measurements, and it also includes a drain.\n\nRear window wiper: A rear window wiper might not seem like an important feature — and a number of electric SUVs, including the Ioniq 5, don’t have one — but it’s one of those things you don’t miss until you need it, and you’ll be glad you have it whenever it’s raining.\n\nThe Bad\n\nRide quality: Ride quality is the Mustang Mach-E’s Achilles’ heel. It’s too firm for what it needs to be; at one point, a backseat passenger of ours was on the brink of getting out because the ride was so uncomfortable on Chicago’s less-than-perfect blacktop. If you live anywhere potholes and rutted roads are more common than not, you should think twice before purchasing one of these.\n\nVisibility: The driver’s over-left-shoulder view is restricted by the Ford’s B-pillar, and over-right-shoulder visibility is hampered by the SUV’s shorter side windows. Electronic visibility aids include blind spot warning indicators in the side mirrors and a 360-degree camera system, both of which are helpful but not substitutes for natural visibility.\n\nBackseat accommodations: The backseat is reasonably comfortable — taller passengers sit with their knees elevated, but there’s good foot space underneath the front seats, as well as enough headroom with the glass roof — but the side windows are on the shorter side, which restricts visibility. The Ioniq 5’s interior feels airier, and its backseat slides and reclines (the Mustang Mach-E’s does neither).\n\nDC fast charging: It took 32 minutes to DC fast-charge the Mustang Mach-E’s extended-range battery from 26% to 80%, adding 149 miles of range. Our calculated average charging rate was 97.5 kilowatts — a bit below the extended-range variant’s maximum of 150 kW. The Ioniq 5, by comparison, charged from roughly the same level in almost half the time (18 minutes) on the 350-kW DC fast charger we used for our test.\n\nRear cargo area: While the Mustang Mach-E’s usable front trunk is a benefit, it has less cargo space behind its backseat than the Ioniq 5, according to our measurements. The cargo area measures 15.9 cubic feet to the Ioniq 5’s 19.1 cubic feet, and the Mach-E’s frunk can’t make up the difference.\n\nNo sunshade: The Premium trim level’s panoramic glass roof makes the interior of the Mach-E feel more open, but it’d be nice to have a sunshade for times you’d rather keep the sun out.\n\nResearch the 2023 Ford Mustang Mach-E | Search Inventory | Car Seat Check\n\n2023 Hyundai Ioniq 5 Limited AWD\n\nThe verdict: Many practical attributes like a reasonably comfortable ride, good interior space and quick DC fast charging make the Hyundai Ioniq 5 a sensible choice for families and anyone who plans on road-tripping with their EV.\n\nAs-tested price: $58,045 (with destination)\nEPA-rated combined efficiency: 101 mpg-e\nEPA-rated range: 266 miles\nMiles of range added in 1 hour on 48-amp Level 2 home charger: 31\nMiles of range per minute at DC fast charger: 7.2\nThe Good\n\nAcceleration: The Ioniq 5 responds quicker when you press the accelerator pedal, and it feels slightly swifter overall. The 0-60 mph times we observed at the drag strip when testing prior model years of the Mustang Mach-E and Ioniq 5 bear this out, with the Hyundai coming in 0.7 second quicker with a time of 4.7 seconds.\n\nRide quality: The Ioniq 5’s ride quality is better than the Mustang Mach-E’s; even though the Hyundai still rides firmly, it’s not as brittle or harsh over bumps. There’s better isolation from impacts overall, and that results in greater ride comfort. The Hyundai is a better choice if you live somewhere that doesn’t have perfectly smooth roads.\n\nDC fast charging: The Ioniq 5’s higher 235-kW maximum charging rate has real benefits when charging at the right type of DC fast charger. A 350-kW EVgo charger brought the Ioniq 5’s battery from 28% to 80% in 18 minutes, or a little more than half the time it took the Mach-E to charge (32 minutes) from roughly the same starting point. The charge session added 130 miles of range, or 7.2 miles of range per minute.\n\nRoomy interior: The front of the cabin is airy, the seats are comfortable, and the space between the driver and front passenger is relatively open. The Ioniq 5’s backseat also offers adjustability that the Mustang Mach-E doesn’t, with a sliding and reclining seat that has good space for adult passengers.\n\nVisibility: The Ioniq 5’s overall visibility is better than the Mach-E’s thanks to a shorter hood that drops away from the driver’s view, a more upright shape with taller side windows and roof pillars that aren’t as prone to blocking your view. The Hyundai also has a number of blind spot warning indicators — icons in the side mirrors along with camera views and warnings in the digital instrument panel.\n\nThe Bad\n\nHandling: The Ioniq 5’s more comfort-oriented suspension tuning means it doesn’t handle as well as the Mustang Mach-E; there’s more body roll in corners versus the Ford’s flatter cornering.\n\nTouch-sensitive climate controls: The Mach-E’s climate controls are on its large center touchscreen, but the Ioniq 5 has a separate touch panel below its own dashboard screen. We’re not fans of touch-sensitive controls that aren’t part of a screen, and Ioniq 5 drivers would have been better served with actual buttons or knobs for these controls.\n\nWireless connectivity: The Ioniq 5’s standard 12.3-inch touchscreen multimedia system includes Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, but it doesn’t support wireless connectivity for these systems. This might seem like a nitpick, but the convenience of wireless CarPlay and Android Auto is real, and you miss it in cars that don’t have it.\n\nNo hands-free driving system: The Ioniq 5 comes with different versions of Hyundai’s Highway Driving Assist system, depending on the trim level, and while the system can help manage speed and steering on the highway, it’s not a hands-free system like BlueCruise. The Limited trim’s Highway Driving Assist II system also includes lane change assist, but in our testing, it responded too tentatively to be of much use on busy urban interstates.\n\nNo rear window wiper: It’s odd Hyundai decided to skip a rear wiper blade for the Ioniq 5; you’ll find the common (and useful) feature on other Hyundai SUVs, including the inexpensive Venue.\n\nResearch the 2023 Hyundai Ioniq 5 | Search Inventory | Car Seat Check\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2023 Ford Mustang Mach-E: Orders Reopen With Lower Prices, Increased Range\nFord Mustang Mach-E Premium Vs.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Hyundai Ioniq 5?\n\nThe Hyundai Ioniq 5 is a five-seat electric-powered SUV with 220 to 303 miles of driving range depending on the size of the battery pack and whether you choose rear- or all-wheel drive. Its avant-garde exterior design will likely grab your attention first, but the Ioniq 5’s spacious and airy interior make it practical and comfortable. Impressive fast-charging capability is another strong point. The Ioniq 5’s EV competitors include the Ford Mustang Mach-E, Kia EV6 and Volkswagen ID.4, as well as the Tesla Model 3 and Model Y. A high-performance Ioniq 5 N model with 601 horsepower, a performance-tuned suspension and standard AWD is slated to join the lineup for the 2024 model year. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Hyundai Ioniq 5?\n\nThe Ioniq 5 now comes standard with rear side airbags, a Wi-Fi hot spot and steering-wheel haptic feedback for the blind spot warning and lane departure steering assist systems. A digital rearview-mirror camera display is newly standard on the Limited trim. \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Hyundai Ioniq 5 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n12.3-inch digital instrument display\n12.3-inch infotainment screen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nHeated front seats\nCloth upholstery\nNavigation \nSatellite radio\nSix-speaker stereo\nAutomatic emergency braking\nSafe exit assist\nBlind spot warning \nRear cross-traffic alert\nAdaptive cruise control\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nFront parking sensors\nHead-up instrument display\nHeated and cooled front seats\nPower-adjustable passenger seat\nPanoramic moonroof\nBose audio system\nPerpendicular parking assist\nWireless device charging\nShould I Buy the 2024 Hyundai Ioniq 5?\n\nThe Hyundai Ioniq 5 could persuade more than a few car shoppers to put an electric vehicle in their garage. It’s relatively affordable, and its powertrain choices allow it to be configured to prioritize a low(ish) price, driving range, or the speedy performance and extra grip afforded by AWD.  If you want its full 303 miles of range, pick an Ioniq 5 with RWD and the optional 77.4-kilowatt-hour battery pack. True, the Ioniq 5’s exterior design is polarizing to some, but the five-seat cabin is roomy, its onboard tech is intuitive, and outward visibility is excellent.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Subtle as they may be, updates to the Hyundai Ioniq 5’s charging, batteries and interior packaging for the 2025 model year cements it as one of the most compelling all-electric SUVs on the market.\n\nVersus the competition: The 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 mostly sits near the top of the mid-size EV heap from a range, driving experience and equipment perspective, butting heads with the Tesla Model Y, Ford Mustang Mach-E and Volkswagen ID.4. \n\nNow this is a satisfying refresh. Tweaked and twiddled for the new model year, the fresh-squeezed 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 adds everything you’ll like and nothing you won’t. Straight to the chase, eh? Well, there’s no point muckin’ about — I’ll leave that to the new off-roadish XRT trim level.\n\nRelated: 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 Moves to Georgia, Gets Face-Lift, Gains XRT Trim\n\nIt’s clear Hyundai listened to the swell of the crowd on this one. First and foremost, we’ve got a standard rear wiper, folks. As obvious as it seems, this was not an available, let alone standard, feature for any previous model years. This inexplicable oversight is rectified, as are a few stylistic and aerodynamic warts that apparently bothered Hyundai. The front end is massaged ever so slightly, we’ve got a new rear roof spoiler and a new aero-blade-style wheel design, all subtle stuff I’m happy to see has left the 5’s retro-cyberpunky aesthetic intact.\n\nRelated Video: \n\nWhat’s New Inside?\n\nThe interior gets the biggest switch-up. The center console is reorganized, with new placement of the wireless charging pad and a glorious row of physical buttons for frequently accessed comfort features including the heated and ventilated seats, heated steering wheel and parking cameras. Crucially, that lovely empty space ahead of the console that extends under the dash remains, offering one of the rare chances the modern consumer has to experience the fabulous, airy bench-seat cabins of yore.\n\nThe tech is better, too. The set of screens for the instrument panel and infotainment system are still 12.3 inches, but the infotainment system is new and now has standard wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. The climate controls are revised, the steering-wheel design is updated, and you can keep your compatriots cozy in the SEL and above trims with optional heated rear seats.\n\nAll excellent quality-of-life improvements of a rare caliber that should make those who upgrade quite happy. Another is the 2025 Ioniq 5’s North American Charging System port, the first new car outside of a Tesla to offer it as standard. This means that, yes, you can plug your new 2025 Ioniq 5 into Tesla’s sprawling charge network without messing with clunky adapters.\n\n2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\n\nHowever, if it’s absolute speed you seek, you might want to stick to the quickest Combined Charging System DC fast chargers, which the Ioniq 5 will still be able to use with an adapter. The new Ioniq 5’s quickest charge times are achieved via juicy CCS chargers, which can take the electric vehicle’s battery from 10%-80% in about 20 minutes at a peak vehicle charging rate of 257 kilowatts. NACS rates peak at 126 kW, but Hyundai is working on pushing that to 135 kW in the near future with an over-the-air update.\n\nBattery Bumps\n\nYour battery choices are revised as part of this charging overhaul, with 5 kilowatt-hours extra over its predecessor on the Standard Range pack for a total of 63 kWh and 6.6 kWh more for the Long Range pack, which is now rated at 84 kWh. Apply this to the different motor configurations, and the result is either minor or quite major: Range improvements depend on the trim level and motors, but the 2025 Ioniq 5 sees a minimum increase of 9 miles of range and a maximum of 30 miles, with the long-range rear-wheel-drive version rated to go 318 miles, according to the EPA. The standard-range RWD config has 245 miles of range, while dual-motor all-wheel-drive SE and SELs will cover 290 miles. The AWD Limited can cover a still solid 269 miles, while the new XRT trim is the dual-motor outlier with 259 miles of range, lesser no doubt due to its standard all-terrain tires.\n\nPower is unchanged, so that means the basest-of-base single-motor standard-range model still poots around with 168 horsepower and 258 pounds-feet of torque, jumping to a more manageable 225 hp with the bigger battery. Dual-motor Ioniq 5s remain sprightly with 320 hp and 446 pounds-feet.\n\n2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\nHow Does It Drive?\n\nThis means that yes, it does drive mostly the same. It’s as good as it was before, with the same battened-down sensation of over-road surety that’s pervasive across the extended Ioniq lineup. It feels confident, comfortable and quite quick in dual-motor configuration.\n\nIt’s a far cry from the nutso, 641-hp-max Ioniq 5 N, but the cushy 5 Limited still hustles with surprising capability through curvy country — or canyon — roads. A low center of gravity and an excellently engineered chassis means the balance between ride quality, body motion control and grip is better than just about any mainstream crossover you’ll find. Steering is digital (effortless and quite numb) but quick in the way almost all EVs are, while other inputs are well tuned enough that anyone with zero EV experience could immediately operate the new 5 with butter smoothness.\n\nWhat Is the Ioniq 5 XRT?\n\nThe XRT is the biggest addition to the lineup, serving very much the same role as other XRT trims do elsewhere in Hyundai’s family tree, including on the Santa Cruz pickup truck and Tucson SUV. This is the one to pick if you’re one of the many active lifestylers seeking a vehicle that’s equally happy on-road as it is … well, I won’t say off-road, but maybe as it is on a two-track desert fire road.\n\n2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\n\nWith a 0.9-inch suspension lift, functional tow hooks, rugged wheels, increased approach and departure angles, standard all-terrain tires and substantially increased protective cladding around the exterior, the XRT is perfect for getting to that remote trailhead, conquering that snowy driveway to the cabin or confidently ramping over the many dips and crags encountered in an urban environment.\n\nOut on Hyundai’s curated Mojave Desert trail outside Palm Springs, Calif., the XRT genuinely surprised me with its shocking comfort and body composure. Whereas even the dustiest, muddiest overland weaponry will rock and shake your bones to powder despite stunning capability, overcooking the XRT over washboard surfaces and through surprise arroyos was a far more refined experience than it had any right to be.\n\nDon’t mistake this for capability. There are clear limits to the XRT’s low ride height and simple Mud-Snow-Sand terrain modes, but with traction control off and access to a field of shallow sand, it does a cheeky impression of Hyundai’s i20 N rally car. Fun, but I had notes for the engineers on hand: I floated the idea of mashing the rugged, sand-scouring focus of the XRT with the power and simulated sound and shifting of the Ioniq 5 N. Their takeaway? “Wouldn’t that be nice!”\n\n2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nHyundai Extends Charging Offer to All 2025 Ioniq 5 SUVs\n2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 XRT Up Close: Digi-Camo!\nWhat to Know Before Purchasing an Electric Vehicle: A Buying Guide\nIs the 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 N an EV Car Enthusiasts Can Embrace?\nShop for a 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 Near You\nHow Much Does the Ioniq 5 Cost?\n\nTold ya — everything you wanted, nothing you didn’t. Even (some of) the inevitable price hike versus the prior model is as minor as can be: Prices rise just $780 for some trims and a more substantial $2,180 for others, with a starting price of $43,975 (including destination $1,475) for the basest-of-base 2025 Ioniq 5. It’s enough to make it one of the better EVs you can buy in 2025.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
