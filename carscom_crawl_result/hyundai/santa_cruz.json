      "expert_review": "The verdict: A small pickup truck that doesn’t much look like one, the Santa Cruz “Sport Adventure Vehicle” (Hyundai’s preferred nomenclature) provides an impressive driving experience and utility in an unusual package that historically has struggled to find buyers.\nVersus the competition: We haven’t yet driven the 2022 Ford Maverick, the other new compact pickup on the block, but we’ve been impressed by what we’ve seen thus far. The Santa Cruz takes a more premium and unconventional tack, but it seems more likely to face competition both from Hyundai and other brands’ compact and mid-size SUVs rather than traditional (or less traditional) pickups.\nWe’ve been teased by the idea of a Hyundai pickup truck for years and now, finally, here it is: the 2022 Hyundai Santa Cruz. Except … Hyundai won’t call it a pickup. No, the Santa Cruz is a Sport Adventure Vehicle, according to the automaker (Not to be confused with Sport Activity Vehicle, which is what BMW has always called its SUVs). But I’m going to let you in on a little secret. Come closer. Closerrrrr. OK, ready for the secret?\nIt’s a pickup.\nRelated: Hyundai Reveals Almost Everything on Its 2022 Santa Cruz Pickup: Size, Power, Towing\nIt’s a pickup in my book, anyway. If a vehicle has a pickup bed, it’s a pickup. (I will not be discussing whether a hot dog is a sandwich or if cereal and milk is soup.) That’s by no means a bad thing; we’re very excited about another unibody compact pickup truck, the 2022 Ford Maverick, and the less traditional unibody Honda Ridgeline is consistently a top finisher, if not a winner, in our mid-size pickup comparison tests.\nThe Santa Cruz looks even less like a pickup than the Maverick or Ridgeline, appearing to be more of a mid-size SUV with a bed. And between its looks and Hyundai’s unwillingness to call it a pickup truck, I have a feeling the Santa Cruz is going to be a more competitive choice among SUV shoppers, not those looking for a pickup — and having now driven one, I find the Santa Cruz a strange-looking but compelling choice.\nSmall in Size, Trick in Features Outside\n\n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    Visually, the Santa Cruz is something of a compact, modern Chevrolet Avalanche, though I will say I don’t think photos do it justice. It’s much more appealing in person, if a bit unusual-looking. I also appreciate that while the sides of the Santa Cruz have some sharp, sculpted lines, it doesn’t have the “pre-dented” look of Hyundai’s Elantra sedan or Tucson SUV.\nWhat the Santa Cruz also lacks, at least in the realm of pickups, is size. It’s 4 inches shorter from bumper to bumper than the Ford Maverick and more than a foot shorter than the Honda Ridgeline. We’ve done a more thorough breakdown of its size elsewhere, which you should check out, but the key takeaway is this: It doesn’t look big.\nThe Santa Cruz’s bed itself also isn’t big, at just over 4 feet long when the tailgate is closed and more than 6 feet long with the tailgate completely lowered. The tailgate can also take up a middle position to provide support for carrying 4-by-8-foot sheets of plywood or drywall. Bed depth is 19.2 inches, and width varies from nearly 54 inches at its widest to almost 43 inches between the wheel housings.\nTo make up for the bed’s small size (even though it’s likely enough bed for the average consumer), Hyundai added a number of trick features. Most noticeable is a factory-installed integrated retractable tonneau cover (not available with the base SE trim, but available on the SEL and standard on the SEL Premium and Limited), which opens and closes easily. There’s also a strap attached to the cover to help pull it closed; in our test vehicle, it was clipped to the bed to keep the strap from getting lost in the back of the bed, though I wonder what the best way to store it would be if the bed were full of items. If it stays clipped, it could get in the way; unclipped, it might get lost in the cargo.\nThe bed also has a lockable underfloor storage compartment with drain plugs, which is truly another signifier that the Santa Cruz is a pickup: Owners can take it to a tailgate party and fill one of its compartments with ice and six-packs of b … sodas. There are additional lockable side compartments, one of which can be equipped with an optional 115-volt, low-current power outlet as well as LED lighting above the bed and on each side. To improve bed access, there are steps built into the corners of the rear bumper. Numerous factory and aftermarket accessories will also be available.\nAll of this utility might not be enough to sway pickup purists, but a Santa Fe with a lockable and more durable rear cargo area is an enticing proposition.\nHyundai also placed numerous visual “Easter eggs” on the Santa Cruz’s exterior, though they’re not very well hidden. There are Santa Cruz silhouettes on the fender moldings, rear bumper molding and on the molding atop the bed sides.\nA Counterintuitive Cabin Inside\n\n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    Inside the Santa Cruz, you’ll find some modern Hyundai hallmarks. Materials quality was decent and felt slightly upscale in the top-of-the-line Limited I drove, and the control layout is intuitive. Hyundai even gave the Santa Cruz a traditional gear selector instead of the push-button selector found in some of its other vehicles; I prefer it because it’s more intuitive and the push-button design never really saves space.\nUnfortunately, a lot of that quality feeling is only skin-deep. Surfaces may be soft to the touch, but they lack underlying padding, particularly the upper portions of the front doors. Quality takes a dip in the backseat, where even the soft material is replaced by hard plastic. Cabin storage is also surprisingly minimal. There’s a decent-sized bin between the front seats but just a few small cubbies elsewhere up front, and much of the storage space ahead of the gear selector is taken up by the wireless charging pad.\nAnother strange quirk of the Santa Cruz, though not unique among Hyundais, is that the standard 8-inch touchscreen has wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, but the 10.25-inch display on the Limited can use those functions only via a wired connection. Even stranger, a model with the 8-inch screen might not have a wireless device charging pad, while one is standard on models that don’t have wireless CarPlay or Android Auto. I only got to experience the 10.25-inch display and remain a fan, having used it in other Hyundai vehicles already. The graphics are clear and crisp and the menus are intuitive.\nMore tech comes in the way of a 10.25-inch digital instrument panel in place of the base trim level’s conventional gauges — it’s standard on the SEL Premium and Limited and optional on the SEL. The graphics are clear and operating the menu system is easy here, too, though in my short drive, I was not a fan of the flat display without a traditional cockpit-style hood over it. That’s likely something I’d get used to quickly, but given a choice, I’d rather have the traditional cover.\nThe elephant in the room is the use of capacitive-touch buttons for audio, navigation and climate control in lieu of physical buttons. The layout and design are similar to the Tucson’s and, while it may look modern (and save Hyundai some money), they’re harder to use, consumers consistently don’t like them, and the control area gets covered in fingerprints and smudges after brief use. There are some physical controls for features like the heated and ventilated seats, and there are redundant physical controls for the audio on the steering wheel, but the capacitive ones are still aggravating.\nIn the backseat, there’s adequate headroom and shoulder room for large adults, but the backseat’s high floor put my knees in a too-elevated position and there wasn’t as much legroom as I would’ve hoped. The high beltline results in small rear windows, too, which can make the back feel cramped. The Limited trim, at least, gets two additional charging-only USB ports for rear passengers (or device-happy front occupants).\nHow It Drives\n\n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    Power comes from a choice of two 2.5-liter four-cylinder engines. The base engine makes 191 horsepower and 181 pounds-feet of torque, while the turbocharged version produces a much more impressive 281 hp and 311 pounds-feet. The naturally aspirated 2.5-liter gets a traditional eight-speed automatic transmission, while the turbo gets an eight-speed dual-clutch auto. The Santa Cruz is also available in front- or all-wheel drive, but the turbo four is paired only with AWD.\nDespite the added power and the added heft of AWD, the turbo four is only slightly lacking in fuel efficiency according to EPA ratings: 22 mpg combined, while both front- and all-wheel-drive versions of the non-turbo are rated at 23 mpg combined. Those numbers likely lag behind the hybrid Ford Maverick, but a better comparison — particularly for the turbo Santa Cruz — will be the turbocharged EcoBoost Maverick, which is not yet rated as of this writing.\nAn area where the Santa Cruz seems likely to distinguish itself is its maximum towing capacity: 3,500 pounds for FWD versions and 5,000 with AWD. That’s more than many compact and mid-size SUVs, more than the Maverick and equal or close to some mid-size pickups. Payload capacity varies from around 1,500 to 1,750 pounds, with more highly equipped models having lower capacities\nI drove a Santa Cruz Limited with standard AWD, the turbocharged 2.5-liter and eight-speed dual-clutch transmission, a drivetrain it shares with the Sonata N-Line. The sportiness isn’t quite on the same level as the sedan (it is a pickup truck, after all), but on twisty mountain roads it handled itself ably. Power delivery is linear and with minimal delay, and the transmission finds the right gear easily enough that if it stumbled, I didn’t notice. While the power figures aren’t identical, this turbo four-cylinder and dual-clutch transmission combination can be found in high-level Santa Fe SUVs, where I also found it impressive.\nRide and handling impressed, as well, though with the 20-inch wheels, you definitely feel road imperfections. The ones we encountered didn’t unsettle the truck, but I have a feeling the ride would seem harsher if we had been driving on worse roads; I’m eager to get behind the wheel of one in Chicago and see if I’m right. At no point in my driving did I find the Santa Cruz to be a sports car hiding under an unusual pickup truck body, but for what it is, it’s pretty damn sporty.\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nHyundai Reveals Almost Everything on Its 2022 Santa Cruz Pickup: Size, Power, Towing\nThe Big Surprise of Hyundai’s 2022 Santa Cruz: It Can Tow a Lot\nThe 2022 Ford Maverick Is Poised to Challenge More Than Just Trucks\n2021 Honda Ridgeline Review: Looking the Part Without Losing the Innovation\nMore Hyundai News\n\nSafety\nAs of this writing, the Santa Cruz has not yet been tested for crashworthiness by either the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, but you can check the links for yourself to see updates.\nStandard safety technology on the Santa Cruz includes forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning, automatic high beams, a driver attention monitor and a rear occupant alert system. Move up the trim levels and you can add blind spot collision avoidance, rear cross-traffic alert and a safe-exit warning system. The Limited also adds adaptive cruise control with lane-centering steering, a 360-degree camera system and Hyundai’s Blind-Spot View Monitor.\n\n  \n    Who’s Going to Buy One?\nWith prices from just over $25,000 to over $40,000, the Santa Cruz occupies a very interesting space. While more expensive than the Maverick, that price range is also where most compact SUVs reside, as well as many versions of mid-size pickups and even lightly equipped full-size pickups.\nWe keep hammering the point home that these small pickups and things like the Ridgeline are more than enough truck for the average buyer, but I’m not sure anyone is really listening. That said, as a pickup, the Santa Cruz is plenty capable.\nAnd while the Santa Cruz probably isn’t going to influence the purchasing decision of those looking for a true pickup — whether that’s because of a purist’s idea of what a pickup should be, the Santa Cruz’s relatively small bed, specific additional capabilities mid-size and larger pickups might offer, or some other reason, this Hyundai might just need to look for a different kind of buyer. The Santa Cruz makes a compelling case as an SUV alternative with a different sort of utility. We’ll have to see if that’s enough to give the Santa Cruz the staying power many of its forebears lacked.\nRelated Video:\n\n  \n    Cars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The 2023 Hyundai Santa Cruz is the latest vehicle to add a blacked-out trim to its lineup. Dubbed the Night, the new trim will sit near the top of the Santa Cruz hierarchy. Other updates to the compact pickup truck (Hyundai would prefer we call the Santa Cruz a “Sport Adventure Vehicle”) include additional standard safety features and improved equipment for higher trims. Prices are also increasing: The 2023 base SE now starts at $26,745, a $1,010 jump from the 2022 SE (all prices include destination fee).\n\nRelated: 2022 Hyundai Santa Cruz Review: A Good Kind of Weird\n\nThe Santa Cruz is available with either front- or all-wheel drive, with AWD standard on higher trims. Power comes from either a naturally aspirated 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine making 191 horsepower and 181 pounds-feet of torque, or a much peppier turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder producing 281 hp and 311 pounds-feet of torque. The base 2.5-liter is paired to a traditional eight-speed automatic transmission; turbo variants use an eight-speed dual-clutch automatic.\n\n2023 Hyundai Santa Cruz Night | Manufacturer image\nWorkin’ on Night Moves\n\nIt might be easier to make a list of vehicles that don’t offer blackout trims or appearance packages at this point, but there’s a reason for their popularity: Lots of shoppers think they look pretty cool. The Santa Cruz Night seems unlikely to be an exception to that rule, with a dark chrome grille, gloss-black mirror caps and door handles, dual side steps, and trim-specific 20-inch black wheels and front and rear styling. Exterior paint colors for the Night are limited to either black or gray.\n\nBeyond appearance changes, there are mechanical changes, as well. While based on the AWD SEL Activity’s equipment, the Night gives owners the turbo 2.5-liter four-cylinder, eight-speed dual-clutch automatic and steering-wheel-mounted shift paddles.\n\n2023 Hyundai Santa Cruz Night | Manufacturer image\nMore Standard Safety Tech, SEL Premium Adds Features\n\nForward collision warning with automatic emergency braking and pedestrian and cyclist detection, lane keep assist and a driver attention warning were already standard on the Santa Cruz. For 2023, it adds a safe exit warning system and blind spot warning with collision avoidance assist and rear cross-traffic alert.\n\nEquipment previously only available on the range-topping Limited now also appears on the second-highest trim, the SEL Premium. A 10.25-inch touchscreen display with navigation is now standard, as is voice recognition. The SEL Premium also gains adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go, speed limit assist and navigation-based cruise control that can detect curves in the road and adjust speeds accordingly.\n\nPricing and Release Date\n\nHyundai says the 2023 Santa Cruz is on sale now, with “stock increasing over time,” according to a Hyundai spokesperson in an email to Cars.com. Full pricing for the entire Santa Cruz lineup is below. The SE, SEL and SEL Activity are powered by the naturally aspirated 2.5-liter and can add AWD for an additional $1,500; all other trims come with the 2.5 turbo and AWD.\n\nSE: $26,745 ($1,010 increase)\nSEL: $29,085 ($150 increase)\nSEL Activity: $32,355 ($150 increase)\nNight: $37,105 (new for 2023)\nSEL Premium: $38,645 ($1,220 increase)\nLimited: $41,615 ($150 increase)\nVersus the Competition\n\nAt the moment, the Ford Maverick is the sole competitor for the Santa Cruz. While 2023 pricing isn’t available from Ford, the 2022 model is more affordable, with prices ranging from the low $20,000s to the mid-$30,000s. The 2023 Maverick will also add an available Tremor off-road package, but even with that added cost, it’s still likely to be more affordable than the Santa Cruz.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nIs the 2022 Hyundai Santa Cruz a Good Car? 5 Pros and 4 Cons\nHere Are the 10 Cheapest Pickup Trucks You Can Buy Right Now\nHere’s Every Car That Earned an IIHS Top Safety Award for 2022\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2022 Hyundai Santa Cruz?\nUp Close With the 2022 Hyundai Santa Cruz’s Cargo Bed\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Hyundai Santa Cruz? \nThe Hyundai Santa Cruz is a compact four-door, five-seat pickup truck with a unibody structure in place of traditional body-on-frame construction; it shares its architecture with Hyundai’s Tucson compact SUV. It has a 4-foot open bed with a lockable underfloor storage compartment, plus an available integrated cover, making for a versatile space for a variety of cargo-carrying needs. The base engine is a 191-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission and a choice of front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive. An available 281-hp, turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder pairs with an eight-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission and standard AWD; it comes standard on the Night trim level and above. The Santa Cruz’s only direct rival is the similar-in-concept Ford Maverick, but the larger Chevrolet Colorado, GMC Canyon, Honda Ridgeline, Nissan Frontier and Toyota Tacoma mid-size pickups are other competitors. \nWhat’s New on the 2024 Hyundai Santa Cruz? \nA new adventure-styled XRT trim level takes the place of the previous SEL Premium trim. Slotting above the blackout-look Night, which debuted for 2023, the XRT also gets blackout trim elements, along with unique fender flares, side steps, bed rails and orange wheel center caps. Along with minor updates to standard equipment on some trims, newly standard equipment includes LED projector headlamps and a steering wheel that vibrates for alerts from the blind spot warning and lane departure warning systems. \nWhat Features in the 2024 Hyundai Santa Cruz Are Most Important? \nStandard features include: \n\nCloth upholstery\nManually adjustable driver’s seat\nLockable under-bed storage compartment\nSheet-molded composite bed\nLED projector headlamps\n8-inch multimedia system\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nAutomatic emergency braking\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nLane departure steering assist\nDriver attention warning\nSafe exit warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nPower moonroof\nRear sliding window\nTonneau cover\nLeather- or leatherette-trimmed seats\nPower driver’s seat\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nDual-zone automatic climate control\nBose audio\n10.25-inch touchscreen\nRemote start\nWireless device charging\n115-volt power outlet in bed\nAdaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability\nSurround-view camera system\nDigital instrument panel\n\nShould I Buy the 2024 Hyundai Santa Cruz? \nWhether or not you should buy a Santa Cruz depends on what you need in a pickup. Essentially a Tucson SUV with a pickup bed, the Santa Cruz offers a more refined driving experience than a traditional truck, but less rough-terrain capability and hauling capacity. It’s rather poky with the base four-cylinder but reasonably quick with the available turbocharged engine. The turbo engine and AWD bump the Santa Cruz’s towing capacity to 5,000 pounds, which is respectable for a smaller pickup, but its unibody architecture and 4-foot bed limit payload capacity. In the end, our editors liked the Santa Cruz enough that we named it our Top Pick: Urban Pickup for 2024.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: With much of its updated interior and exterior shared with the similarly refreshed 2025 Tucson SUV, the new Santa Cruz is a compelling and refined entry in the niche unibody pickup truck class.\n\nVersus the competition: The Santa Cruz occupies a rather interesting niche in the already-tiny segment, offering a drive experience that’s more like a crossover than either the Ford Maverick or Honda Ridgeline, but similar in capability.\n\nThe Hyundai Santa Cruz is moderately refreshed for the 2025 model year, and much like the related 2025 Tucson SUV, all of its mechanical guts are left untouched. The majority of the upgrades are split between exterior stylistic tweaks and revised interior packaging, meaning the new trucklet drives quite a bit like the old one.\n\nRelated: 2025 Hyundai Santa Cruz Up Close: The Korean El Camino Gets a New Face\n\nI spent a brief time with the massaged Santa Cruz, all limited to a medium-speed dirt ranch road that wove through the rolling hills of California’s central coast savanna. The trail time was neither long nor challenging, but the off-road-themed Santa Cruz XRT crunched through enough undulating grit and gravel to guarantee you won’t get stuck on the rough route to your lake house or remote cabin.\n\nFor those not up-and-up on what the Santa Cruz represents, think of it as a Tucson with a 4.3-foot bed in place of the crossover’s closed cargo area. This means the same front-wheel-drive unibody architecture is here, as is the naturally aspirated 2.5-liter four-cylinder base engine. But where the Tucson offers hybrid and plug-in hybrid powertrains, the Santa Cruz adds a turbocharger to the 2.5-liter for its upper-trim engine.\n\n2025 Hyundai Santa Cruz XRT, interior | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\n\nThat’s what you’ll get if you pick the outdoorsy XRT trim, which standardizes the turbo and adds all-terrain tires, trim-specific wheels and extra exterior cladding. Compared to the prior model, the 2025 Santa Cruz XRT significantly toughens up its appearance in an effort to shy away from the divisive general “crossover-with-a-bed” vibe. But from what I could glean from the short trail, it sure still feels like a bedded-crossover — and that’s a good thing. Both the prior Santa Cruz, current Ford Maverick and Honda Ridgeline appeal to the buyer who seeks unibody comfort with the extra utility afforded by the bed, and in the Santa Cruz, you’re certainly getting body control and movement isolation that’s superior to body-on-frame mid-size trucks like the Ford Ranger or Toyota Tacoma.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nAfter a few trail loops, I parked and futzed with the new interior, which is far and away the most significantly updated portion of the new model. At least in the XRT and Limited trims, a pair of connected 12.3-inch displays form a curved digital dash, with one for the driver display and the other handling all infotainment functions. As it is in the refreshed Tucson, these displays are highly configurable and utilize the latest iteration of Hyundai’s intuitive, user-friendly interface with standard wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.\n\nI have a hard time imagining this is enough to coax existing Santa Cruz owners to trade up, but this curved dash is impressive and handsome enough to win over cross-shoppers. I also dug the new three-spoke steering-wheel design with the marque’s “dot-dot-dot-dot” motif that signals “H” in morse code, though I noticed the absence of the new Tucson’s column-mounted gear selector lifted from all-electric Ioniq models and the new mid-size Santa Fe SUV. On the compact Tucson, this cleans up the center console area significantly and allows for repositioning of the wireless charge pads and additional storage under the floating console tunnel. \n\n2025 Hyundai Santa Cruz XRT, wheel | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\n\nStill, the Santa Cruz XRT gains the Tucson’s reworked climate control panel — now a backlit unit that tidies things up nicely — and shares the same shelf area above the glove box that’s perfect for passenger phones or a bundle of Slim Jims.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nBaby’s First Face-Lift: Updated 2025 Hyundai Santa Cruz Starts at $28,895\n2025 Hyundai Santa Cruz Gets Interior Upgrades, More Rugged XRT\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2022 Hyundai Santa Cruz?\nUp Close With the 2022 Hyundai Santa Cruz’s Cargo Bed\nResearch the Hyundai Santa Cruz\n\nThe good news is that you won’t pay a whole lot extra for all of this — but you are going to pay extra (mostly). The XRT puts an extra $100 in your pocket compared to the 2024 model, but the top Limited trim requires an extra $1,180 and the base SE clocks in at $1,600 more than before.\n\nAre the 2025 Hyundai Santa Cruz’s updates enough to make you upgrade? Maybe, maybe not ­— we’ll check back in after a more comprehensive drive sometime in the near future.\n\n2025 Hyundai Santa Cruz XRT, front | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
