      "expert_review": "The verdict: Some electric vehicles are just weird: weird range, weird controls — but not the 2022 Hyundai Kona Electric. The electric version of Hyundai’s tiny SUV has a lot in common with the regular model, which is part of why it works so well.\n\nVersus the competition: The Kona Electric delivers good range at a competitive price, along with pleasant road manners and easy controls — unlike some other EVs. Where it falls short is in availability: In addition to supply chain issues affecting the entire market, it’s not even offered nationwide.\n\nThe Kona Electric was the automaker’s first all-electric SUV when it launched for model-year 2019; for 2022, it has a lightly freshened face and a larger standard touchscreen. See the models compared. The Kona goes up against other small electric SUVs, such as the Chevrolet Bolt EUV and Volkswagen ID.4. It’s also likely to be cross-shopped against the Nissan Leaf electric hatchback. See the models compared.\n\nRelated: 2022 Hyundai Kona Review: A Cute-Ute Formula That Makes Sense\n\nLike the gas-powered Kona, which I cover in a separate review linked above, there’s a lot to like about the electric version of this plucky subcompact SUV, from its zippy driving manners and no-nonsense controls to ample safety features and a focus on value. There are, however, some obvious differences between the gas-powered version and the EV. Here are three big ones.\n\n1. A Plug, Not a Pump\n\nThe biggest difference between the conventional Kona and the EV is obviously under the hood, and a hint about that comes from its face: The EV’s front sports a smoother, more streamlined design than the regular model, and there’s a charge panel that’s oddly off-center above a minimized grille.\n\nThe Kona Electric gets power from a 64-kilowatt-hour battery pack and single electric motor making 201 horsepower and 291 pounds-feet of torque. It comes only with front-wheel drive; the VW ID.4 has standard rear-wheel drive and optional all-wheel drive.\n\nPower comes on fast and smooth; near-instant torque makes for great pep off the line and gives the Kona some zip around town. The EV feels much quicker than the regular Kona, which already was decently peppy when equipped with the more powerful of its two available engines, a turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder. For even more zip, pop the Kona Electric into Sport mode, which increases responsiveness for a more aggressive feel. Eco mode plays it safe, which translates to dulled responsiveness, and Normal mode splits the difference.\n\nAll three modes have a big impact on how much energy the car uses, which in turn impacts its range. The EPA estimates the Kona Electric is good for 258 miles of range, which is competitive with other small EV estimates, such as the Chevrolet Bolt EUV’s 247 miles of range and the VW ID.4’s 280 miles in the base trim level with rear-wheel drive. The base front-drive-only Nissan Leaf is good for only 149 miles of range, while the Leaf Plus is rated up to 215 miles thanks to a larger battery.\n\nWith a 7.2-kilowatt onboard charger, the Kona can achieve a full battery charge from 10% in about nine hours with a Level 2 charger rated 32 amps or higher (the setup I have at home). Hyundai says it can reach an 80% charge from 10% in approximately 47 minutes using a public DC fast charger, which I did not try.\n\nThe Kona Electric is an efficient vehicle, which pays off both in cost of operation and charging speed, replenishing miles of range faster than some competitors. It recently earned the No. 4 spot on our list of the top 10 most efficient electric vehicles with a rating of 28 kWh per 100 miles. The Bolt EUV took seventh place with 29 kWh per 100 miles, while the ID.4 and Leaf didn’t crack the top 10.\n\nI tested the Kona in frigid temps and discovered that its range is relative — as is the case with all EVs due in part to extra energy demands from cabin heat and goodies like heated steering wheels and seats; use these less and you’ll get more range. With the Kona Electric’s Sport, Normal and Eco mode settings, you can customize climate control usage for each mode to balance your needs with the car’s range. Because I like all the cozy things, my range was always lower than the 258-mile max that’s available under just-right conditions. The good news is that the car’s range gauge seemed pretty accurate during my trips, and even though I always saw numbers less than the EPA-estimated range, the Kona still had plenty of juice for long trips.\n\nOther cold-weather-related factors play a part in the car’s range, as well. Cold weather limits how much energy is recaptured through the EV’s regenerative braking system, and lower temps impact how long it takes to bring the vehicle’s battery up to a full charge, so plan accordingly. The Kona does have an available battery warmer system to help prevent excessively long battery-charging intervals in cold weather: In a selectable Winter mode, the battery warmer can minimize battery-power loss due to low temperatures, ensuring quicker acceleration and charging by keeping the battery warm. There’s also an available app that helps manage charging and lets you control some vehicle systems remotely.\n\nYou’ll also feel the impact of the Kona Electric’s battery in the backseat, where the pack’s placement under the floor eats into backseat space and impacts comfort. The floor is elevated compared with the regular model, requiring a more awkward knees-up seating position. Where the gas-powered Kona has 35.2 inches of legroom, the Kona Electric has only 33.4 inches, and even those numbers don’t adequately reflect just how much usable legroom you forfeit in the EV. At least front legroom and cargo space dimensions are the same.\n\n2. Breaking in the Brakes\n\nThe EV’s driving experience is pretty different from the regular Kona’s in a couple of ways — not bad, just different. Where the gas-powered version sounds gruff and loud, the EV is quiet, making subtle whirring noises similar to what you’ll hear in other EVs. The EV also rides a bit firmer; it’s not uncomfortable, but it doesn’t absorb bumps as well as the gas version. This might be related to its low-rolling-resistance tires , which have been known to impact ride (though the technology is improving). For what it’s worth, overly firm or poorly sorted ride quality is a frequent complaint of ours in affordable EVs.\n\nThe electric Kona also has a very different brake feel that’s mostly typical of hybrid and electric cars, but with a twist: The Hyundai’s regenerative braking works to capture lost energy and return it to the battery to boost efficiency via an adjustable, customizable system.\n\nIn each of the car’s Sport, Eco and Normal modes, you can dial up the strength of the regen system — aka the degree to which the Kona decelerates when you lift off the accelerator pedal. For example, in Sport mode, I set it to Level 1, so the system reacted like relatively normal brakes, with a firm, responsive pedal.\n\nI set it to Level 3 in Eco mode, which is the highest setting, and thus the most unnatural-feeling one — but also the one that saves the most energy. At this level, you feel the car start to slow down dramatically when you remove your foot from the accelerator pedal, which led to a lot of lurching until I got the hang of it. Even in Level 3, however, it doesn’t quite slow down to a stop as can happen in one-pedal driving modes in some other EVs; the Nissan Leaf’s one-pedal system, for example, is easy to get used to and can be helpful in traffic. In the Kona, if you want the car to brake all the way to a stop, you can enable a one-pedal mode by holding down a steering-wheel paddle until the car stops, but it felt more like a gimmick than a useful way to drive.\n\nI ended up splitting the difference and got comfortable in Level 2, which still saves braking energy but doesn’t feel as weird as Level 3. One other minor annoyance: Changing the brake settings seemed to require digging through a few screens and menus. Access to these settings should be more straightforward, and while I eventually learned you can move between the levels via that steering-wheel paddle, it wasn’t clear until I dug into the owner’s manual.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nWhich Electric Cars Are Still Eligible for the $7,500 Federal Tax Credit?\nTop 10 Most Efficient Electric Cars\nElectric Cars With the Longest Range\nWhat It Cost to Outfit 6 Homes With EV Chargers\nElectric Vehicles: Understanding the Terminology\n3. What It Costs and Where You Can Get It\n\nThe last big difference between the conventional Kona and the electric one is cost and availability. The 2022 Hyundai Kona Electric is available in only two trims, SEL and Limited, starting around $35,000 (all prices include destination) — over $10,000 more than a gas-powered Kona SEL. That’s steep, but the Kona Electric is still eligible for a full $7,500 federal tax credit, which helps remove some of the sting.\n\nThat price is also pretty competitive. The Kona Electric costs about the same as the Chevrolet Bolt EUV, but that vehicle is no longer eligible for the tax credit. The Kona is also cheaper than the Volkswagen ID.4, which is a bit larger but also still eligible for the tax credit. The smaller Nissan Leaf is the best deal of all, at $28,375 for the base model with that relatively weak range. The Leaf is also still eligible for a tax credit.\n\nThere’s one more caveat, and it’s a big one — especially given the inventory shortages shoppers already face nationwide: The Kona Electric is currently sold only in states that require increasing sales of zero-emissions vehicles. As of this writing, those states include California, Colorado, Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington.\n\nWith real-world-livable range, likable road manners and a competitive price, the Kona Electric is a compelling option, and one of the least weird EVs out there — if you can find one.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Hyundai Kona?\n\nAvailable with a choice of front- or all-wheel drive, the 2023 Hyundai Kona is a five-seat subcompact SUV that excels in traffic that would make many larger SUVs feel bulky and ponderous. The Kona’s tidy proportions do, however, limit rear legroom and cargo volume. The base 147-horsepower four-cylinder is good on fuel economy but limited in performance. A 195-hp four-cylinder is also available, but for an even bigger kick, there’s the high-performance Kona N that’s motivated by a 276-hp, turbo four-cylinder. It scoots from 0-60 mph in an estimated 5.2 seconds. Also available is the all-electric Kona Electric, which offers 258 miles of range and has the same carlike responses of its gas-fed siblings. Unfortunately, it’s available only in select states with zero-emissions mandates.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Hyundai Kona?\n\nAfter an interior and exterior refresh last year, the Kona receives more standard equipment for the 2023 model year. In terms of safety features, all Konas now come standard with a blind spot warning system, safe exit alert and rear cross-traffic alert.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Hyundai Kona Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nAutomatic emergency braking\nRear cross-traffic alert\n8-inch infotainment screen\nThree USB ports\nKeyless entry\nSix-speaker audio system\nHeated side mirrors\nDriver-monitoring system\nBluetooth\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n10.25-inch infotainment screen\nHeated front seats\nSatellite radio\nNavigation\nPower moonroof\nAdaptive cruise control\nLED headlights and taillights\nPower-adjustable driver’s seat\nHarman Kardon audio system\nShould I Buy the 2023 Hyundai Kona?\n\nThe Hyundai Kona’s wide range of powertrains and easy-going driving manners should appeal to SUV shoppers who value economy and comfort. Granted, the base engine has only modest performance, but there are two turbocharged four-cylinders available for anyone wanting a boost in acceleration. While the Kona Electric delivers a nice balance of driving range and a reasonable price tag, it’s not sold nationwide. Rivals like the Honda HR-V, Subaru Crosstrek and Toyota Corolla Cross are worth considering, especially if the Kona’s backseat accommodations and cargo area feel too pinched for your needs.",

      "expert_review": "The redesigned 2024 Hyundai Kona Electric is ready to shine as an affordable-electric-vehicle alternative now that two of the most affordable electric cars in recent years, the Chevrolet Bolt EV and Bolt EUV, have temporarily been discontinued. I took a brief drive in the Kona Electric, which starts at $34,050 (all prices include destination), during the Midwest Automotive Media Association’s 2024 Spring Rally in Elkhart Lake, Wisc., to see what it’s like to drive one of the most affordable EVs out there.\n\nRelated: Read More About the 2024 Hyundai Kona Electric\n\nRight off the bat, know that its rock-bottom price comes with an asterisk, because the entry-level Kona Electric SE has less EV driving range, battery capacity and power versus the pricier SEL and Limited trim levels. I drove the top Limited trim level that, in addition to more power and EPA-rated driving range, for $42,420, is loaded with such niceties as a power moonroof, hands-free power liftgate, simulated-leather upholstery, heated and ventilated front seats, a Bose sound system, a 360-degree camera system and wireless charging. Current incentives, however, help make out-the-door pricing much more competitive.\n\n2024 Hyundai Kona Electric\tSE\tSEL, Limited\nPrice, including destination\t$34,050\t$38,050, $42,420\nHorsepower\t133\t201\nRange (EPA)\t200 miles\t261 miles\nBattery capacity\t48.6 kilowatt-hours\t64.8 kilowatt-hours\nEasy to Use\n\nIn all Kona Electrics, what stands out most is just how normal it is to use and drive. With physical buttons for climate control, a traditional instrument panel with digital gauges in front of you and an easy-to-use multimedia user interface, there’s no learning curve with the Kona Electric. And that’s not the norm, because most EVs differentiate themselves by offering unique controls and display experiences, often to the detriment of usability.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nOn the road, the front-wheel-drive Kona Electric is a joy to drive, with a surprisingly composed and comfortable ride for its small stature — which by today’s standards is subcompact in exterior dimensions, though a decade ago, this could very well have been considered a compact SUV. Wind and road noise is also well managed for a small SUV, showcasing an experience that feels a class above its size.\n\n2024 Hyundai Kona Electric | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nAll 2024 Kona EVs come with 17-inch alloy wheels. That may seem small compared with most plus-sized wheels on many newer cars, but I appreciate the wheel choice from the perspective of ride quality as well as driving range because larger tire sidewall helps with ride comfort, while larger wheels can make a big dent in an EV’s driving range.\n\nFurther testing of the Kona Electric’s range, efficiency and charging will come during a later test when we have the Kona Electric for more time.\n\nInterior\n\nThe Kona EV is surprisingly roomy and has no-nonsense technology including two well-designed 12.3-inch displays for the center touchscreen and digital instrument panel, which makes for a compelling budget-minded EV at its $34,050 starting price. You can also buy an adapter for the charge port called vehicle-to-load that allows you to plug in household AC devices to the Kona Electric and use the large capacity battery to power things like home appliances during an electrical outage or recreational devices while camping or working/playing outside.\n\nThe cabin is roomy enough on the inside, both the front and rear seat, for my 6-foot-tall frame thanks to increased dimensions versus the outgoing Kona EV. I was pleasantly surprised to see rear climate vents in the back console (found on SEL and Limited trims), which is typically a feature seen on larger SUVs. Rear climate vents are great when you have to carry kids in the back and can point the air vents their way, and it’s even more impressive to see these on the Kona Electric because Hyundai’s other electric SUV, the 2024 Ioniq 5, restricts this feature to its top Limited trim level, which is $12,455 more than the Kona Electric’s top Limited trim level.\n\nWhat You Don’t Get\n\nWhat you don’t get is the availability of all-wheel drive because the Kona Electric is FWD only. The Kona’s 201 horsepower in SEL and Limited trims is passable but hardly as much power as you can get in dedicated EVs (the Kona is also available with gas engines). There’s definitely more function than fun in how the Kona Electric drives, though its 261 miles of EPA-rated range is plenty enough for those seeking an around-town commuter and is more than what other affordable EVs like the 2024 Nissan Leaf (maximum 212 miles) and 2024 Mini Cooper SE Hardtop (114 miles) offer.\n\nVersus the Competition\n\nWhat’s disappointing for thrifty EV shoppers is that the 2024 Kona Electric’s base retail price is $5,255 more expensive than the outgoing 2023 Bolt EUV, and the Kona EV doesn’t qualify for the federal $7,500 tax credit on purchases, though leases can use that incentive to lower the overall amount.\n\n2024 Hyundai Kona Electric | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nThe only EVs that are less expensive than the Kona Electric — the Leaf and Cooper SE Hardtop — have serious caveats besides modest driving range: The Leaf uses a dated CHAdeMO connector for DC fast charging, and the Cooper SE Hardtop’s two doors limit its usability. Granted, the Kona Electric that’s most appealing starts at $38,050. If you’re looking at this SEL trim level, it’s not the cars that are less expensive than the Kona Electric that you should be considering, but the EVs that are more expensive because there are some good ones.\n\nA rear-wheel-drive Tesla Model Y Long Range can potentially cost less than $40,000 for buyers who qualify for the federal tax credit, while the Hyundai Ioniq 6 sedan with its quick DC fast-charging capability can also come under $40,000 without any tax credit (and there are cash-back incentives available on the Ioniq 6). Considering those cars and their superior DC fast-charging capabilities and performance, the Kona EV doesn’t look great when its price climbs near $40,000.\n\nAt the time of publishing, there are deep discounts available on the Kona Electric that make the more expensive and capable versions very appealing, including $7,500 cash rebates and low lease rates that can lower a Kona Electric SEL to just over $30,000. These discounts are what bring the Kona EV into the chat, especially considering the 2024 Kona Electric’s expanded availability to nearly 50 states (except Wyoming and South Dakota) and how easy it is to use and drive.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2024 Hyundai Kona Up Close: A Little Bigger, a Little Bolder\nAuto Show Faceoff: 2024 Hyundai Kona Electric Vs. 2023 Kia Niro EV\n2024 Hyundai Kona: Updated Performance, EV Offers Estimated 260 Miles of Range\n2024 Hyundai Kona Gets EV-Inspired Styling Inside and Out\n2024 Hyundai Kona Review: Bigger, Bolder, Better\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Competes with: Tesla Model 3, Chevrolet Bolt EV, Nissan Leaf, Hyundai Ioniq EV\n\nLooks like: A Kona SUV with a smoother snout. Despite switching to an electric vehicle powertrain, much of the design remains the same for Hyundai’s subcompact suvie.\n\nDrivetrain: A 201-horsepower electric motor making 291 pounds-feet of torque and coupled to a 64-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack sending power to the front wheels.\n\nHits dealerships: Early 2019. Sales will begin in California before migrating to other states with similar zero-emission vehicle mandates, currently including Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island and Vermont; the Kona Electric will not be sold in all 50 states.\n\nThe Hyundai Kona Electric combines the space and utility of the South Korean automaker’s new subcompact SUV along with an estimated 258 miles of driving range on a full charge. This places the Kona Electric among some of the very best electric cars available today, at least when it comes to maximizing mileage.\n\nRelated: What’s the Best Subcompact SUV for 2018?\n\nThe Chevrolet Bolt EV, for comparison, offers 238 miles of electric range. And depending on whether it has the standard battery pack or the optional long-range version, the Tesla Model 3 sedan delivers an electric range of between 220 and 310 miles.\n\nOne caveat with the Kona Electric is that sales will be limited to 10 states. Sales begin early next year, starting in California, and will eventually move to other states with similar emissions requirements and zero-emission vehicle mandates. Hyundai has not yet announced the price of the Kona Electric, nor whether it will be available with both a purchase and lease option.\n\nExterior\n\nLike many electric cars, there isn’t much that shouts that this Kona is electric. Sure, the front end kind of looks like a standard Kona wearing a surgical mask; the smoother nose undoubtedly helps aerodynamics and, since there is no traditional engine and radiator to keep cool, there’s less need for large front apertures and openings. Style is subjective, but when viewed from the front, the simpler-looking face of the Kona EV is definitely less busy than the standard model. Do we detect the subtlest hint of Tesla Model X? Maybe, though if anything, the Kona Electric is the better-looking car.\n\nStandard equipment includes front and rear LED lighting, along with aerodynamically shaped five-spoke alloy wheels. Apart from that, the electric model is nearly a visual twin of the standard version.\n\nInterior\n\nWe’ve tested more than a few hybrids and electric cars to know that a powertrain can make a big impact on the interior. This is especially true when an automaker crams a battery pack into the space normally reserved for luggage; you end up with a car that’s eco-friendly but downright mean when it comes time to load luggage or shopping bags. Thankfully, Hyundai has positioned the electric powertrain and battery pack in a way the preserves the 19.2 cubic feet of cargo room behind the split-folding rear seats. That’s a big plus point considering one of the main advantages of the Kona is its larger cargo area and handy rear hatch.\n\nFrom the driver’s seat, you’re greeted by a floating touchscreen mounted in the center of the dashboard. The largest version, equipped with navigation, measures 8 inches across and comes with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility. The standard 7-inch touchscreen includes features like voice recognition technology and a backup camera. Much like the exterior, the rest of the Kona Electric’s cabin is similar to what you’ll find in gas models.\n\nUnder the Hood\n\nThe Kona Electric is front-wheel drive and comes powered by an electric motor with the equivalent of 201 horsepower. That compares nicely to the standard model, which has a choice of a 147-hp, 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine or optional 175-hp, 1.6-liter turbocharged four. The car’s 64-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery can be recharged up to 80 percent of its total capacity in approximately 54 minutes when using a fast-charging system, according to Hyundai. The battery is also covered by a lifetime warranty, which should provide extra peace of mind to anyone on the fence about an EV’s long-term durability. The charging port is in the nose of the car to help make head-in parking-lot recharges a bit simpler.\n\nSafety\n\nWhile it’s not as obvious as the Kona Electric’s nose job, it’s nice to know Hyundai has fitted a number of safety items as standard in the Kona Electric, including forward collision warning with emergency braking. Other available safety items include lane keep assist, driver attention warning, blind spot monitors, rear cross-traffic alert and automatic high beams.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2021 Hyundai Kona?\n\nThe Hyundai Kona is a five-seat subcompact SUV, though from the outside, its proportions are more wagonlike in terms of height and size. This can be an advantage when driving in a crowded city center, but its driving position may not be high enough for some. \n\nAvailable with a choice of gas engines, the Kona is also offered with an all-electric drivetrain; the aptly named Kona Electric delivers a 258-mile EPA-estimated driving range. The Kona’s standard gas engine is a 147-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder that works with a six-speed automatic transmission; a 175-hp, turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder that teams with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic is also available. While gas Konas can have front- or all-wheel drive, the Kona Electric is front-drive only. Competitors include the Kia Soul, Nissan Rogue Sport and Honda HR-V. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2021 Hyundai Kona?\n\nA new Night Edition powered by the turbocharged four-cylinder features LED headlights and taillights, black 18-inch wheels and trim, black cloth upholstery and aluminum pedals. \n\nWhat Features in the 2021 Hyundai Kona Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\n16-inch alloy wheels \n7-inch touchscreen multimedia system \nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity \nBluetooth \nCruise control \nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane-keeping assist\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nPower moonroof\nLeather seating \nHeated front seats\nNavigation with 8-inch touchscreen\nInfinity premium stereo \nWireless device charging\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nAdaptive cruise control\nShould I Buy the 2021 Hyundai Kona?\n\nThe Kona is an excellent choice if you’re looking for a smaller SUV with carlike driving manners. While the base engine’s power is modest, the turbo four-cylinder provides an extra measure of performance. The Kona Electric, meanwhile, has the range needed to make it a viable daily driver, but it’s only offered in certain regions of the country.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Hyundai Kona?\n\nThe Hyundai Kona is a five-seat subcompact SUV, though from the outside you might think its proportions are more wagon-like in terms of height and size. This can be an advantage driving in a crowded city center, but the SUV’s unusual exterior design is polarizing.\n\nAvailable with a choice of gas engines, the Kona is also offered with an all-electric drivetrain; the aptly named Kona Electric delivers a 258-mile EPA-estimated driving range. The standard gas engine is a 147-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder that works with a six-speed automatic transmission. A 175-hp, turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder that works with a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission is also available. While gas Konas can have front- or all-wheel drive, the Kona Electric is front-drive only. Competitors include the Kia Soul, Nissan Rogue Sport and Honda HR-V.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Hyundai Kona?\n\nThe high-end Ultimate trim level gains adaptive cruise control. SEL Plus and higher versions get a 4.2-inch color multi-information display, wireless charging and an auto-dimming rearview mirror. Meanwhile, the Kona Electric adds an available battery warmer, and its Ultimate trim gets a larger 10.25-inch touchscreen.\n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Hyundai Kona Are Most Important?\n\nYou get a lot for your money with the Kona. Standard features include automatic headlights, heated side mirrors, a 7-inch touchscreen multimedia system, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity, Bluetooth and cruise control. To make your Kona more luxurious, available comfort touches include leather seating, heated front seats, navigation, an Infinity stereo and wireless device charging.\n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Hyundai Kona?\n\nThe 2020 Kona is an excellent choice if you’re looking for a smaller SUV with car-like manners. While the base engine’s power is modest, the turbo four-cylinder provides an extra jolt of performance. For early tech adopters, the Kona Electric has the range needed to make it a viable daily driver, but it’s only offered in certain regions of the country.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Hyundai Kona Electric?\n\nThe Hyundai Kona Electric is an all-electric version of the five-seat Kona subcompact SUV. It’s a well-rounded choice that’s long on value; it remains one of the more affordable electric vehicles you can buy. A 2024 redesign brought big improvements, including upsized dimensions for improved passenger and cargo room. All Kona Electrics are front-wheel drive; the base trim has a 48.6-kilowatt-hour battery paired with a 133-horsepower electric motor, while other trims use a 64.8-kWh battery and 201-hp motor. The Kona Electric’s competitors include the Nissan Leaf, Kia Niro EV and Toyota bZ4X. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Hyundai Kona Electric?\n\nThe Kona Electric sees minor updates for 2025 after its redesign last year. A new N Line trim adds sporty cosmetic touches inside and out, along with available 64-color ambient interior lighting previously offered only on the line-topping Limited. The SEL and N Line trims can now be had with LED interior lighting, which was previously offered only on the Limited. All Kona Electrics now have vehicle-to-load capability that allows them to charge other electric vehicles or power a home during an outage. \n\nHow Much Range Does the 2025 Hyundai Kona Electric Have?\n\nThe Kona EV’s EPA-estimated driving range runs from 200 to 261 miles, depending on battery and wheel size.\n\nHow Long Does it Take to Charge the 2025 Hyundai Kona Electric?\n\nAll Kona Electrics have a 10.8-kilowatt onboard charger that can charge the battery from 10% to 80% in about 43 minutes on a DC fast charger.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Hyundai Kona Electric Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n12.3-inch infotainment touchscreen\n12.3-inch digital instrument display\nCloth upholstery\nDual-zone climate control \nSix-speaker audio system\nNavigation\nWireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay \nHeated mirrors \nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nAdaptive cruise control\nLane-centering steering \nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nSafe exit warning\nDriver attention monitor\nTraffic sign recognition \nRear-seat reminder\n\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nPower-adjustable driver’s seat \nHeated front seats\nVentilated front seats \nSynthetic leather upholstery\nHeated steering wheel \nPower moonroof\nAmbient interior lighting \nWireless device charging\nEight-speaker Bose audio system\nHands-free power liftgate\nAutomated parking system\n360-degree camera system\nBlind spot cameras\nFront, side and rear parking sensors \nRear emergency braking\nShould I Buy the 2025 Hyundai Kona Electric?\n\nThe Hyundai Kona Electric is an appealing and competitively priced choice among electric SUVs, and it comes nicely equipped with safety and convenience features even in its base trim. Like its gas-powered counterpart, the Kona Electric offers good passenger and cargo room for its size, and unlike some EVs, its controls are refreshingly conventional and simple to operate. Several EV rivals, however — including Hyundai’s own Ioniq 5 — offer quicker charging speeds and longer driving ranges.",
