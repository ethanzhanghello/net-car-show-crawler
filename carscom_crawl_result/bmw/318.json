      "expert_review": "BMW’s truncated 318ti is easy to overlook as not being a real BMW because it has a 4-cylinder engine and looks like an economy hatchback. Yet, my recent test drive in a 318ti Sport proved to be both entertaining and enjoyable.\n\nEven though the 3-series sedan is all-new, the 318ti is a carryover model that uses the old-style bodywork. The 318ti Sport is the only model sold, and it will only be available in limited numbers. Its price has been reduced by $1,030 to $23,300.\n\nThe Sport package consists of an aggressive front spoiler like the M3, 16-inch wheels, sports seats, a three-spoke steering wheel and tighter suspension tuning. Grippy tires and a lack of body roll endow this diminutive coupe with the reflexes of its bigger, 6-cylinder sibling and encourage you to skip the freeway and take the back road whenever possible in hopes you will encounter some twisty two-lane pavement. While its racetrack performance may be hurt slightly by its semi-trailing arm rear suspension, in most everyday driving its cornering behavior is rock solid and loads of fun.\n\nIn keeping with BMW’s tradition of building cars with excellent road behavior, the 318ti has powerful and well-balanced brakes, which increase the driver’s confidence. All Season Traction limits wheelspin in slippery conditions and the four-wheel disc brakes have standard anti-lock.\n\nWhile the other 3-series BMWs have 6-cylinder engines, this two-door hatchback still has a 16-valve, dual-overhead-cam (DOHC) 1.9-liter, 4-cylinder with 138 horsepower. Although 138 horsepower is not a lot, the closely spaced 5-speed manual transmission provides more than adequate acceleration. High-speed cruising gets a bit noisy because the engine turns fairly high rpm in fifth gear, a tradeoff that results from a fairly low overall drive ratio.\n\nShifting is enjoyable because the clutch take-up is smooth and the short gear lever has a direct linkage that only moves a short distance between each shift.\n\nDeeply contoured seats with adjustable under-thigh support are part of the Sport package, and their firm padding makes a significant contribution to overall vehicle comfort. Of course, the back seat is so small as to be essentially useless for adults, but it does fold flat to create a mini-station wagon load area that is easily accessed by the rear hatchback.\n\nLarge, simple gauges dot the instrument panel and give the driver critical information at a glance. Less successful, however, are the controls for the radio and climate control, which are mounted on an angled panel in the center of the dash. This extra panel is canted slightly toward the driver, but it also faces down just enough to require an extra glance when you want to change radio stations or adjust the cabin temperature.\n\nA small center console runs between the seats and has two small cupholders that look like they were added at the last minute. German car companies have only recently figured out how to do cupholders well because they do not like them in the home country.\n\nNight driving reveals mediocre headlights, which is most unusual for BMW. The beam pattern was too diffused and the level of light output was adequate at best.\n\nTrue Bimmerphiles may look askance at the 318ti because of its radical shape and 4-cylinder engine, but all in all, I found it appealing because of its affordable price and fun-to-drive personality.\n\nPrice\nThe base price of our test car was $23,300. Standard equipment included power windows, power mirrors, cruise control, central locking, AM//FM stereo cassette and air conditioning.\n\nAdd destination charges of $570 and the sticker price is $23,870.\n\nWarranty\nFour years or 50,000 miles.\n\nPoint: The 318ti Sport is an inexpensive alternative to the more expensive 3-series models, and this is the last year for BMW enthusiasts to get one. The 4-cylinder engine and close-ratio manual transmission make it pepp while the sport suspension gives it cat-quick reflexes.\n\nCounterpoint: The 318’s chopped-off tail may be too abrupt for some, but I didn’t mind it. Radio and climate controls are not easy to read and the back seat is small.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\nENGINE: 1.9-liter, 4-cyl.\nTRANSMISSION: 5-speed\nCONFIGURATION: Front-engine, rear-drive\nWHEELBASE: 106.3 inches\nCURB WEIGHT: 2,778 lbs.\nBASE PRICE: $23,300\nPRICE AS DRIVEN: $23,870\nMPG RATING: 23 city, 32 hwy.",

      "expert_review": "Average is not a word usually associated with BMW, but that seems the best way to describe the entry-level 318is.\n\nThe German automaker has a lineup of coupes, sedans, convertibles (and now even a wagon) that many driving enthusiasts consider exemplary vehicles.\n\nBut the 318is is an expensive mystery.\n\nAfter nearly 500 miles in the silver test car 318is, I am still wondering: Where is the value in this car?\n\nThe 318is, a two-door sports coupe, is not particularly fast. It handles reasonably well, but sets no standards for cars in its class. And it is missing such things as an alarm system, CD player, power seats and cruise control.\n\nTake a look at almost any other sports coupe in this price range and you’ll likely find that you can get a lot more equipment and better performance for less money than a 318is.\n\nFor example, an Eagle Talon TSi offers all-wheel drive, comes with a turbocharged 200-horsepower engine, and delivers awesome performance for a sticker price of $21,000 – less when you factor in rebates and bargaining.\n\nAnd the Eagle is much more entertaining to drive than the BMW. So, too, is the new Ford Probe GT.\n\nPerhaps when BMW begins building cars in its factory in South Carolina it will be better able to compete in the lower end of the market.\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nThe 318is has a 138-horsepower, 16-valve four-cylinder engine that can be somewhat buzzy when revved hard. It will propel the 2,866-pound coupe to 60 mph in 9.9 seconds. By contrast, the Talon goes zero-to-60 mph in 6.8 seconds.\n\nThe 318is won’t get moving quickly unless you rev the engine and slowly release the clutch. That’s no good, because by doing that, the clutch will wear out faster. So you really have no choice except to live with the car’s somewhat leisurely acceleration.\n\nThe 318is comes only with a five-speed manual transmission. This is a highly refined gearbox that shifts smoothly and sports well-spaced gears that allow the engine to deliver excellent fuel economy.\n\nSensible driving will yield about 300 miles between fill-ups of unleaded premium. The test car returned 28 miles per gallon in city/highway driving using the air conditioner.\n\nHANDLING\n\nThe 318is handles well – to a point.\n\nUnlike most BMW’s, the 318is can get flustered in hard, fast curves.\n\nWhen I shoved the car around a corner at 50 mph, the tires squealed with disapproval – that’s unusual for a BMW, a company that has staked its reputation on building superb handling cars. Driven easily, however, the 318is is well able to cope with most driving situations.\n\nIt does an excellent job of filtering out road noise over rough pavement. The power-assisted steering gives the car sharp, quick reflexes.\n\nAs usual, BMW’s four-wheel power-assisted anti-lock disc brakes are well up to the task. The brakes had a lot of bite and they quickly and safely arrested the speed.\n\nThe independent suspension system is firm, but that doesn’t cause the car to shudder over speed bumps and potholes.\n\nGenerally, the 318is is stable and safe, but somewhat unexciting to drive.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nThe 318is’ aggressive styling and the excellent manner in which it is assembled are the car’s high points.\n\nThe car looks like a miniature version of the sleek $90,000 BMW 850i sports coupe. But BMW doesn’t just have a nice-looking coupe here. It has a sports coupe that can comfortably accommodate two average-sized passengers in the rear. Something the Talon and other cars of that ilk usually can’t do.\n\nThe rear seats split and fold forward to increase interior storage room, a nice touch. The gray cloth-covered front bucket and rear seats are smartly designed and quite firm. The front seats provide excellent support in all the crucial areas, even if adjusting them takes more work than one would expect in such an expensive car.\n\nAlthough the dash, center console and door panels contain acres of plastic, they are styled sensibly and user-friendly. The switches for the electric windows are located on the console, very close to your knee. They are easy to find and use in the dark. I did not find any defects. There were no rattles, leaks or squeaks.\n\nLooking at the competition, the 318is’ performance and equipment, I feel the car would be a good value at $16,000 or $17,000. At $24,000 and change, you would have to really have BMW fever to make such a purchase.\n\nAlthough the 318is is generally competent, you can get a lot more car for a lot less money elsewhere. Or, for a little more money, you can get a lot more car from BMW.\n\nThe 318is has a bigger brother right across the showroom. It’s the 325is, which is really the same car, but with a powerful six-cylinder engine and more equipment.\n\nAt about $29,000 and change, the 325is offers good value and better performance. It wipes out all the 318is’ shortcomings.\n\nTruett’s tip: The 318is is a sharp-looking sports coupe. Unfortunately, BMW’s smallest car is under-powered, under-equipped and overpriced.",

      "expert_review": "Over the years, BMW has consistently offered stylish, well-built, high-quality automobiles.\n\nCan you think of one ugly BMW model? Can you think of one that was poorly designed or plagued with mechanical troubles?\n\nUntil recently, however, there has been one minor blemish on BMW’s shiny German armor: There was nothing on BMW’s menu for people with an appetite for a car in the $20,000 price range.\n\nBefore the January arrival of the 318ti – this week’s test car – you needed about $30,000 to own a new BMW.\n\nThe new 318ti changes that.\n\nI just spent a week behind the steering wheel of a cherry red 318ti, and I can tell you that if you’ve yearned for an affordable BMW, you are going to be mighty delighted with this stubby-tailed hatchback.\n\nEven if you order a 318ti with none of the options in our test car, you’ll still own a quick, solid, well-equipped BMW.\n\nIn these days of spiraling car prices, it’s unusual when an automaker brings out a car that costs less. The 318ti maybe the least expensive BMW, but it remains true to the company’s performance-oriented heritage.\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nThe 318ti’s engine is a beefy 16-valve, double overhead cam four-cylinder that makes 138 horsepower.\n\nThe aluminum engine makes a muffled growl when the revs reach about 4,500 rpm. BMW’s 1.8-liter engine, though smooth, doesn’t have the same smoothness as a similar sized Japanese-made engine, which typically makes no more noise than a sewing machine.\n\nYou can hear and feel the BMW engine as it goes about its business. However, the mechanical sensations from under the hood never intrude to the point where it gets annoying.\n\nOur test car’s easy-shifting five-speed manual gearbox complemented the fast-revving engine and made for entertaining driving. Thanks to a clutch pedal that is easy on the leg, the 318ti requires little effort to shift.\n\nIf you prefer not to shift, you can order the 318ti with a four-speed automatic, butthat likely would sap much of the car’s verve.\n\nI once tested a 318i coupe with an automatic and found it slow and sluggish. Also, the automatic adds $975 to the sticker. If extracting the maximum performance out of the 318ti is important to you, then stick with the stick in this car.\n\nThe performance of the 318ti comes across as somewhat shy of fast, but the car offers plenty of pep and good acceleration from 0 to 60 mph, as long as you rev the engine hard and shift at the right time. A recent Car And Driver test pegged 0-to-60 mph acceleration at 7.8 seconds – slightly slower than a Ford Probe GT.\n\nFuel mileage for the 2,700 pound three-door BMW is excellent. I drove with a heavy foot and with the air conditioner running, yet our test car averaged better than 26 mpg in city highway driving.\n\nHANDLING\n\nVirtually all cars the size of this compact are front-wheel-drive. BMW says it opted to steer clear of front-wheel-drive in the interests of better h andling.\n\nI don’t buy that.\n\nI am not convinced rear-wheel drive has any significant handling advantages over front-wheel drive. There are some fast front-wheel compact hatchbacks, such as the Eagle Talon/Mitsubishi Eclipse, that offer standard-setting handling. Engineering a small car for front-wheel-drive also generally allows for more interior space.\n\nFact is, BMW has no experience building front-wheel-drive cars. Also, the 318ti is a mixture of parts from the 318/325 coupe and sedan and a European-only BMW – the 316i Compact. It was faster and far less expensive for BMW to make the 318ti a rear-drive car – regardless of what BMW says about handling.\n\nBe that as it may, the 318ti likely will perform over the road well enough to satisfy, and probably delight, most drivers.\n\nOur test car came with a $2,400 option BMW calls the Sports Package that included wheels and fatter tires; firmer shocks, springs and anti-roll bars; leather steering wheel and shift knob sportseats with cloth and leather upholstery, and fog lights. It’s an option package de signed for those who like to drive aggressively.\n\nAs with other BMWs, the 318ti is solid over the road. The power-assisted rack-and-pinion steering is razor sharp. The turning radius is a tight 34.1 feet.\n\nAll models come standard with power-assisted four-wheel anti-lock disc brakes. During the years, I have raved that BMW designs the best brakes in the business. The 318tidoesn’t skimp here. When you need to stop fast, all four brakes bite hard and slow the car effortlessly and in a straight line. The front end doesn’t dive – as it does on many other cars.\n\nThe suspension is firm but not punishing. You won’t provoke the body to lean much, no matter how fast you corner. I could do nothing to faze the 318ti.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nOur test car garnered more than the usual share of comments from co-workers and neighbors.\n\nMost were negative.\n\nThe 318ti has a sloping rear end and a tightly cropped tail section that does not protrude much past the rear wheels. It also has very long doors. The car’s proportions take a bit of getting used to, but the styling has a purpose. This is one two-door car that rear-seat passengers will likely have no difficulty with climbing in or out.\n\nThe doors extend a bit farther past the front bucket seats than they would on most other two-door cars. The front seat backs flip forward, exposing a clear path to the back. The rear seats are firm, and are angled back slightly. They are generally comfortable, and rear passengers will find ample foot and headroom.\n\nThe backs of the rear seats fold forward but don’t completely flatten. Still, the cargo area is large. I loaded four big boxes of copier paper and didn’t use all the space.\n\nUp front, the 318ti is a typical BMW. The seats, which adjust manually in many directions, are very firm – almost stiff. But they grip your midsection and hold you snugly as you take the car through a tight corner. It’s a nice feeling.\n\nOur test car came with surprisingly long list of equipment. And this is what impressed me most. The 318ti offers excellent value for the money. Our car had remote controlled power door locks, an electric sunroof, power windows, heated outside power mirrors, a rear windshield washer, a built-in anti-theft system and a superb AM/FM cassette radio.\n\nThe one-touch or express-down electric windows are a nice touch. The controls are simple and easy to use. Three knobs control the air-conditioning system. Two cup holders are planted between the seats, and there were numerous places to store small items such as key chains, wallets and sunglasses.\n\nIn more than 400 miles, I found the 318ti to be well-built, fun to drive and well worth its asking price.\n\nTruett’s tip: BMW’s new entry-level sports coupe is a tightly built, fun-to-drive car that offers pleasing performance and excellent handlin g.",

      "expert_review": "A couple of years ago at an event for Chrysler dealers, I saw two prototype Plymouth sedans that floored me.\n\nOne was a Neon, the other a Breeze. Both cars were equipped with large folding canvas soft tops.\n\nIt is unbelievable what a canvas roof can do to transform a car. Those two Plymouths almost were like convertibles. The interiors suddenly felt open and airy. And the cars had fun written all over them.\n\nThe Neon, already one of the most cheeky compacts, would have been every high school kid’s dream with that canvas top, and the Breeze would have become more than just a decent economy car.\n\nIn Europe, folding canvas roofs have been popular for years. In fact, Chrysler engineers borrowed the roof treatment from a spindly little French car called the Citroen 2CV. But Chrysler decided not to offer the canvas roof because engineers could not eliminate wind noise and water leaks.\n\nNow another automaker is testing the market to see if American buyers will warm up to this innovative item. BMW has added an electrically operated folding canvas roof to the menu of options available on the $20,000 318ti hatchback. The roof comes as part of the California Package.\n\nI recently tested a 318ti with the California Package. Not only was the car a blast to drive, but it also was a real head-turner when the roof was peeled back. It gave the car a breezy, youthful feel and greatly enhanced the car’s value.\n\nPERFORMANCE, HANDLING\n\nBMW engineers installed a better engine in the 1996 318 line. The 318ti is outfitted with a peppy, fast-revving 1.9-liter four-cylinder engine that has 16 valves and double-overhead cams. Horsepower is rated at an impressive 138. Our test car’s engine was coupled with an easy-to-shift five-speed manual transmission.\n\nThe 318ti is no pocket rocket, but it offers very respectable performance. Road & Track magazine clocked one at 8.6 seconds in a 0-to-60 mph test.\n\nThe 318ti delivers most of its power when the engine is revved between 3,000 and 5,000 rpm. The engine can get a bit raucous, but it has a very sporty sound that complements BMW’s image of building performance-oriented cars.\n\nOf all the BMW models I’ve tested, the 3-Series cars are best. I like the size of the car. You don’t feel as if the car is too big, and, at the same time, you don’t feel cramped. The dimensions and weight of the 318ti are a perfect match for the car’s finely tuned four-wheel independent suspension system. The combination gives the car a very balanced and solid feel.\n\nThe power-assisted rack-and-pinion steering system allows the 318ti to turn a complete circle in a tight 34.1 feet. The four-wheel anti-lock disc brakes are very strong, enhancing your feeling of control and security. The ride is quiet and sporty, though not so firm that it punishes.\n\nOur test car delivered superb fuel economy despite the fact that I often drove it hard. It averaged 24 miles per gallon in t he city and 32 miles per gallon on the highway.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nThe 318ti has a handsome, high-quality interior devoid of any flashy gadgets and gimmicks.\n\nI found the dash to be particularly well-designed and easy to use. For instance, rotary knobs in the center of the dash make adjustments to the air conditioner quick and easy. The switches for the wipers and cruise control, which are behind the steering wheel, are easy to reach and use.\n\nAt first I didn’t care for the old-style, pull-out headlight switch, but then as I got used to the car, it made sense: It was just part of the car’s user-friendly design.\n\nSome cars suffer from having too many functions on turn signal or windshield wiper switches, but the placement of the controls in the 318ti makes them easy to operate. They are arranged so that the driver need not take his or her eyes off the road for more than a second or two when it’s time adjust the air conditioner, radio or some others stem.\n\nThe 318ti’s seats are covered with durable black cloth. They are firm and supportive, but it takes some patience to figure out the myriad manual adjustments. Several pull-up levers control the seat adjustments.\n\nFor a subcompact car, there is plenty of room in the rear for passengers and cargo. The rear seats fold forward so that larger items can be placed inside the car.\n\nThe electrically operated folding roof made our 318ti special. A lighted switch on the roof near the mirror opens and closes the top.\n\nIt’s true that the canvas top lets in more noise and causes quite a bit of turbulence in the interior when you are cruising down the highway. Some people might find this trait unacceptable. When both windows were open, the buffeting subsided. But even with the windows closed, wind noise\n\nStill, the canvas top gave this entry-level BMW a free-spirited feeling.\n\nBMW officials in New Jersey are trying to gauge buyers’ enthusiasm for the top and are not sure if it will be added to the options list in 1997.\n\nThe California Package, an option that added $3,030 to the price of our test car, included the special roof, unique wheels, cruise control, leather-wrapped steering wheel and painted bumpers and side skirts.\n\nOur test car also had power windows, door locks and mirrors; air conditioning; traction control; and a powerful AM/FM radio.\n\nSpecifications: Base price: $20,560 Safety: Dual air bags, anti-lock brakes, side-impact protection, front and rear crumple zones Price as tested: $25,735 EPA rating: 23 mpg city/31 highway Incentives: None\n\nTruett’s tip: BMW’s 318ti California is light, breezy and fun to drive. It’s well-built, offers decent performance, good fuel economy and has plenty of room.",
