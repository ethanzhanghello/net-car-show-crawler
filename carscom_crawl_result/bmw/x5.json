      "expert_review": "When BMW recently threw up its hands in surrender and decided to sell Rover and Land Rover, industry ‘experts’ quickly decided that BMW must be destined for takeover. Without the fat profits of Land Rover, BMW faces a rocky road.\n\nBut those pundits haven’t driven the South Carolina-built BMW X5, the Bavarian firm’s first sport utility vehicle.\n\nOf course, saying SUV and BMW in the same breath strike some as heresy. They’d sooner be run over by a BMW SUV than drive one. To those purists I’d only say, drive it first.\n\nOne drive will bring on sudden revelations. First revelation: This is easily the sportiest of sport utilities, which is usually a category where the sport refers to the lifestyle attached to the vehicle, not the vehicle’s dynamics. Second revelation: BMW didn’t need Land Rover’s expertise to produce a killer SUV. Third revelation: It’s pricey, but there’s nothing like it on the SUV market.\n\nWhat makes this vehicle such a kick? It’s the driving dynamics this vehicle has. It drives like a BMW car, albeit a big one.\n\nInitially, all X5s will come with a 4.4-liter V-8 hooked to an automatic transmission. The double-overhead-cam, 32-valve engine pumps out a healthy 282 horsepower and 324 foot-pounds of torque at 3,200 rpm mated to a 5-speed automatic that allows for manual shifting. Unusual for a BMW: you won’t want to. This drivetrain is silky smooth with awesome amounts of power. With a curb weight of 4,828 pounds, this vehicle is quick for a sport utility, with a 0-60 mph time of 7.5 seconds, according to BMW.\n\nIt certainly felt that quick. The automatic transmission didn’t hinder progress. It always seemed to be in the right gear and in the right range for power. That’s why shifting wouldn’t help matters; there wasn’t anything to improve upon.\n\nAll the juice allows for pushing the car -um- truck’s handling limits. It takes sharp corners and curves that would put most SUVs tumbling head-over-heels. There was little of the pitching associated with trucks, except for closely spaced bumps at highway speeds. Thank electronics, especially Dynamic Stability Control, which helps keep things level in cornering or abrupt maneuvers by measuring steering wheel angle, acceleration and other measurements and then makes the vehicle respond to keep you on your intended path. It’s invisible in its operation.\n\nThis vehicle did an amazing job of balancing a compliant ride with traditional BMW handling capabilities. Most people will forget they are in a truck. They won’t forget they are in a BMW.\n\nWhat makes this all possible are a few unique features for this class. The X5 is unit body, rather than the more traditional body on frame. This allows for a tighter feel for the vehicle, more akin to the rest of the BMW line. It also makes the vehicle lighter, while still endowing the X5 with the expected rigidity. It also allows BMW to meet car safety-standards.\n\nThe suspension is fully independent, rather than the more traditi onal rear beam axle, improving on-road ability, where this vehicle will spend most of its time. When the driver encounters a bump on the left side of the vehicle, the right side will be unaffected.\n\nAll-wheel-drive is standard, splitting torque 38 percent front/62 percent rear. Electronic traction control operates at all four wheels. When a loss of traction is encountered, the vehicle responds by reducing engine torque or applying an individual wheel’s brake or both.\n\nThere is no low gear, but rather Hill Descent Control, which helps the driver maintain low speeds when descending a hill. Four-wheel disc brakes with anti-lock are standard, as are a wealth of air bags front and rear.\n\nIf the performance isn’t enough to draw you in, maybe the looks will. The exterior is taut and muscular, with all the crispness inherent in current BMW design. The rear looks very wide, yet the stance of the vehicle is just right, showing off the X5’s standard 18-inch wheel a nd tires. It was nice nough to draw crowds when parked, earning a thumbs up from the backwards-cap crowd.\n\nInside the X5, you’ll find all the flexibility and luxury that you’d expect in this class. Standard luxuries include a power tilt/telescopic steering wheel with automatic tilt-up for exiting the vehicle, power front seats with memory settings, acres of leather and wood trim, dual automatic climate control, split folding rear seats, multi-function trip computer and a climate control system that recognizes high levels of air-pollution and adjusts the system accordingly by recirculating cabin air instead.\n\nAs expected, the seats were quite comfortable and firm. The wood trim was tasteful, warming the interior nicely. Cabin space was plentiful, although some will wish for more cargo storage. A cargo net is standard.\n\nBMW always has great audio systems and this one was no exception. The only downside was the lack of a weather band, an unusual omission, especially for a vehicle whose specialty is foul weather.\n\nOptions for your X5 include a $2,470 Sport Package which upgrades the tires to 19-inch, firms up the suspension, adds sport seats inside and has a titanium color grille insert along with black chrome exhaust tips. Opting for the $850 Activity Package gets you headlight cleaners, rain-sensing ones, including Parking Distance Control (which uses front and rear sensors to detect when objects are too close to the vehicle) and an Onboard Navigation System using a GPS screen among many others.\n\nThis handsome, agile SUV has the sporting manners that should calm any enthusiast’s fears that BMW is going soft.\n\nIf the $49,970 base price and automatic-transmission-only doesn’t appeal, just wait. For 2001, BMW is releasing an X5 with a 3-liter double-overhead-cam in-line-six, 225 horsepower and a 5-speed manual for 10 grand less.\n\nNo matter which one you buy, this SUV answers the tug of heart most enthusiasts grapple with when facing a new purchase: sport utility or sports sedan? With the X5, you get both sports sedan manners and SUV practicality, making this one tops in its field.\n\n>> 2000 BMW X5 4.4i\n\nEngine: 4.4-liter DOHC 32-valve V8 with variable-valve timing\nTransmission: 5-speed Steptronic automatic transmission\nTires: 225/55R18 H all-season\nWheelbase: 111 inches\nLength: 183.7 inches\nWidth: 73.7 inches\nWeight: 4,828 pounds\nTowing capacity: 6,000 pounds\nBase price: $49,970\nEPA rating: 13 mpg city, 17 mpg highway\nTest mileage: 12 mpg\nFuel type: Premium only\n>>",

      "expert_review": "Motherhood is a glorious entrance into a new and brilliant existence, but like any force of nature, even in this wonderful state ripples of upheaval exist. Most recently in my case, a bout of circulating and re-circulating illness has reared its very ugly head. Nothing smothers the pure magic of parenthood faster than ghastly sick children. I’m talking weeks of toxic green snot, seeing-stars fevers, all-nighter piercing ear infections, “don’t-make-me-swallow” sore throats, wimpy aching abandoning muscles, “how-many-ribs-did I-just-snap” coughs, “it’s-raining-again” sneezes and countless other aches too hard to remember for a family of four. To sum it up: Absolutely, dreadfully, AWFUL. But finally, almost surprisingly, it came … the much-anticipated calm after the storm.\n\nNow I actually have the desire to venture out of the house again (wow, this is BIG), don some proverbial rose-colored glasses and revel in my rescued, carefree spirit (well, what’s left of it, post-children). Accordingly, I found stepping out of total disorder and into normalcy surprisingly divine. As I picked up the BMW X5, I knew it would take me far from home and help shake this recent sense of confinement. And what a charming car it was to make this mama feel pampered in just the right way. I immediately opened the X5’s gigantic sunroof, which spans front to back, and let the sunlight and fresh air filter in. As I adjusted my seat, I came upon a seat-bottom knee extension, which is also offered on the passenger side. I was intrigued enough to lower my seatback and rest my head for a minute … what a lovely position, and what excellent road-trip potential! I eventually scooted back up and familiarized myself with the navigation system. It requires more patience/reading than I have at the given moment (because I want to go, Go, GO). This iDrive system is used to control the navigation system (as well as communications, entertainment and climate controls) and is nothing less than a complete pain in the a@#. Its multifunction knob requires the dexterity of a highly evolved primate (or my 5-year-old son) to make it slide back and forth, left and right, rotate clockwise and counterclockwise and depress to scroll through an endless array of screens and menus. I can’t wait until enough people complain about it that BMW finally chooses to opt out.\n\nFor our trek up into the hills for some much needed recreational activity, I loaded skis from the cargo area through the cargo cubby and into a cleverly enclosed “hidden” ski sack. I enjoy this feature because it means the main cabin of the vehicle is protected from icky ski drips. When packing other items into the BMW X5 cargo hold, I made use of a small net on the driver’s side for some loose board books, and the recessed plastic bin on the passenger side held our day’s supply of water bottles.\n\nNext, I raised the BMW X5’s splendid rear side window shades for each of my two children, plopped them into their car seats (Note: although Latches are much improved over previous years – they no longer slice your fingers open while trying to install car seats – they could still be easier) and loaded a couple of lattes into the front cupholders. On a side note, said cupholders have a sliding cover, so when the teacher pokes her head into my car at carpool this clever little cover means she won’t be able to see the crumbs and other grit that inadvertently finds its way in there. I stored my cell phone in a small, deep rectangular area right next to the gearshift. On another crafty note, there is an open shelf in the rear, behind the center console, which I used to house a few more books for any “kids gone wild” occurrences. Additionally, I made use of the rear dual climate control (four vents), preventing any simultaneous “I’m-hot-I’m-cold,” just-for-the-sake-of-bugging-you battles between the kids.\n\nA feature I absolutely fell in love with in the BMW X5 was the remote key. Basically, I clipped my keys into the diaper bag and left them there. How, you wonder? Well, the car senses the remote and unlocks the door for me as soon as I begin to pull on the door handle. Then, once in the car, the super-simple keyless start allows me to depress the brake and push the start button, upon which the car becomes ready for almost my every desire.\n\nLast but not least, I appreciated the park assist, heated steering wheel (yippee), and nine driver-control steering-wheel buttons. Basically, BMW has left nothing to chance with the X5. It drives like a charm, and it pampers nicely. Getting away is easy in this joy of a ride; affording it may be more laborious.\n\n*For more information on the BMW X5 and its safety features, visit www.cars.com.\n\nLET’S TALK NUMBERS\n\nLATCH Connectors: 2\n\nSeating Capacity (includes driver): 5\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\n\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove On): Groove On",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in February 2007 about the 4.8i version of the 2007 BMW X5. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what details are different this year, check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe BMW X5 was one of the pioneers in the performance SUV segment when it was launched in the 2000 model year. Its focus on onroad excellence, as opposed to offroad capability, was a sensible move, considering BMW’s brand heritage and how seldom most consumers venture off-road in their SUVs. The second-generation, 2007 X5 continues in this vein but now comes with more power and can seat up to seven.\n\nOur test X5 had the optional 4.8-liter V-8, and it’s a great engine for a few reasons. It makes plenty of power at low engine speeds and propels the X5 at will around town and on the highway. The V-8 is forceful in its power delivery but never becomes unrefined; this engine is smooth anywhere on the rpm range. In short, it’s an engine you can find yourself addicted to rather quickly, and withdrawal is hard.\n\nBMW X5 Engines\n\t3.0-liter inline-six\t4.8-liter V-8\nHorsepower (@ rpm)\t260 @ 6,600\t350 @ 6,300\nTorque (lbs.-ft. @ rpm)\t225 @ 2,750\t350 @ 3,400\nZero to 60 mph (sec.)\t7.8\t6.4\nRequired gasoline\tPremium\tPremium\nEPA-estimated\ngas mileage\n(city/highway, mpg)\t17/23\t15/21\nSource: Manufacturer\n\nA 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder is standard, and both engines drive a six-speed automatic transmission that features BMW’s Steptronic clutchless-manual mode for driver-controlled gear changes. It’s a shame the X5 isn’t offered with a manual transmission like the smaller X3 SUV, but it comes down to demand. “The X5 buyer was less interested in manual shifting,” says Bill Scully, BMW product communications specialist, “whereas there’s still a market there in the X3.”\n\nAs automatics go, however, the X5’s is right up there with the best of them. Shift quality is excellent, and the transmission kicks down rapidly when necessary. In Sport mode, kickdown is swifter still, and the transmission doesn’t upshift as readily, providing decent engine braking with the V-8.\n\nEven though the X5 is one of the better-handling SUVs available today, the characteristic driving experience that makes BMW’s cars so enjoyable feels a little watered down here. Instead of offering lots of feedback and a weighty feel, the steering system has more power assist and it’s not especially sharp. Hard cornering brings on body roll, but the X5 always feels stable and under control.\n\nThe firmly tuned four-wheel independent suspension makes rough roads a jostling experience, but the normal BMW payoff — outstanding handling — is missing. It goes where you point it, but there’s no sense of connectedness between driver and machine that’s present when piloting a 3 Series coupe.\n\nWhy are we talking about coupes in an SUV review? The answer is that even though the X5 competes against other luxury SUVs, like the Acura MDX and Audi Q7, it will always be held up against the capabilities of BMW cars because the spinning propeller logo on its hood brings with it expectations. Obviously, endowing an SUV with classic BMW dynamics presents challenges, but once you’ve experienced them elsewhere you wish the X5 had them, too.\n\nTwo chassis options not present on our test car were Active Steering and AdaptiveDrive. Active Steering is a variable-ratio system designed to make the front wheels steer more sharply at lower speeds than at high ones for a given turn of the steering wheel. (Navigating a parking lot, for example, requires slighter turns of the steering wheel than would be needed with the standard steering system.) BMW also says Active Steering can make minor steering adjustments on its own to keep the X5 under control. AdaptiveDrive, meanwhile, is an adaptive suspension system that features adjustable stabilizer bars and two modes: Normal and Sport.\n\nThe Inside\nLike other BMWs, the X5’s cabin is sleek and purposeful without a lot of extra frills to get in the way of driving. While the interior doesn’t look or feel as luxurious as the Q7’s, optional wood trim lends an upscale appearance, and there are thoughtful details, like real stitching on the door panels. Leatherette upholstery is standard and real leather is optional. Interestingly, the optional third-row seat is covered in leather regardless of what surface the first and second rows have.\n\nThe interior is not without some questionable elements, though. For one, there’s no excuse for a $40,000-plus luxury SUV to still have vinyl sun visors that aren’t extendable to better shield the driver’s eyes when the sun is shining through the side window. Trim-piece fit and appearance is good overall, but there are some unusually large gaps around the clamshell glove box doors — they’re so big you can see some dashboard innards through them. The front seat belt anchors aren’t adjustable for height, either. These are small things, to be sure, but when you’re spending this much, their significance increases.\n\nVisibility from the supportive driver’s seat is good, but I found the cushioning too firm for my taste. Our test vehicle featured the optional multi-contour front seats, which include power-adjustable side bolsters and seat cushion length among their array of adjustments.\n\nThe split-bench, reclining second-row seat in our seven-seat X5 could slide forward and back to balance the legroom needs of middle and rear passengers. Moved to its rearmost position, the second row is a roomy place for adults. Other than its tad-too-firm cushion, center-seat comfort is decent and there’s no floor hump to crowd the middle passenger’s legs.\n\nThe second-row seat articulates forward with a pull of one lever to clear a path to the optional two-seat third row. Children will be the most likely occupants, and that’s a good thing, because there’s not a lot of room back there. Both the second and third rows can fold down level with the cargo floor for hauling purposes.\n\nSafety\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety awarded the 2007 X5 a Good rating, its highest, for its frontal-offset crash-test performance. Standard are all-disc antilock brakes with brake-fade compensation and a brake-drying feature that keeps the discs clean during inclement weather. Side-impact airbags for the front seats, an electronic stability system and side curtain airbags for the first and second rows (but not the available third row) are also standard.\n\nCargo & Towing\nWith all seats upright, including the available third row, the X5 has only 7.1 cubic feet of cargo room, which is less room than you’ll find in many compact sedans. Cargo capacity jumps to 18.5 cubic feet with the third row folded (plus more space if you don’t opt for that third row). With the second row folded flat, maximum cargo capacity totals 61.8 cubic feet. The inline-six and V-8 versions are both rated to tow up to 6,000 pounds when properly equipped.\n\nFeatures\nOptions include front and rear heated seats, front and rear parking sensors, Comfort Access keyless entry and ignition, a head-up display and a panoramic moonroof that’s made of two large glass panels and includes a power sunshade. The available navigation system can receive traffic information via a Clear Channel Communications FM broadcast that’s available in more than 40 metro areas. During route guidance, if the navigation system receives warning of a delay from the traffic broadcast it can recalculate the route to avoid the congestion.\n\nA six-CD changer is optional, but it’s located in the glove box — an outdated design — as opposed to being integrated with the radio head unit. A rear-seat entertainment system with an 8-inch screen is also optional.\n\nX5 in the Market\nIn addition to the MDX and Q7, the realm of performance SUVs includes the Infiniti FX45 and Land Rover Range Rover Sport. While the X5 doesn’t equal the driving performance of the FX45, which is more sports car than SUV to begin with, it holds its own against the others.\n\nBeside the fact that it’s an SUV, BMW purists will take issue with the X5’s comparatively less accomplished handling performance, but the company sells coupes and sedans for those folks. If you’re searching for a sporty SUV that’s at home at the country club but can still tow your M3 to a weekend club race, the X5 won’t disappoint.\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "At first glance, the BMW X5 3.0i and the Jaguar S-Type 3.0L have little in common except for the size of their engines.\n     The X5 is a luxury sport-utility from a German automaker. The S-Type is a luxury sedan from a venerable name in British auto    making that’s now owned by Ford Motor.\n  In fact, each even employs a different engine configuration, with the BMW getting the expected in-line version of its cylinders while the Jaguar employs a V-6.\n     Yet each represents an attempt by its maker to stretch the availability of a new model. In this case, the six-cylinder versions of these vehicles make them not only less powerful but also much cheaper than their V-8-bearing siblings.\n     The X5 4.4i with its 282-horsepower V-8 sells for $50,045 with destination charge. The X5 3.0i that we drove with its 225-horsepower in-line six sells for $39,545.\n     The S-Type 4.0L with its 281-horsepower V-8 sells for $49,950 with destination charge. The S-Type 3.0L that we drove with its 240-horsepower  V-6 sells for $44,250.\n     In these troubled economic times, even luxury car buyers think twice when making $5,000 or $10,000 decisions. Let’s see what they get for their money.\n      \nJaguar   S-Type 3.0L\n    It didn’t take the S-Type sports sedan long after its May 1999 debut to become the bestselling Jaguar in the United States. A price much more affordable than previous Jaguars and the car’s gorgeous exterior proved an      irresistible draw to many buyers.\n     With its four round front lights and oblong-shaped grille, the S-Type is instantly recognizable. Its body is contemporary and well-proportioned, and seems far removed from the ancient shape of the XJ sedan.\n    On the inside you’ll find the requisite leather and wood, both looking just a bit more elegant than in some competing luxury models.\n     The biggest differences, obviously, in the 4.0L and 3.0L versions of the rear-wheel-drive S-Type are under the     hood and on the road.\n     The 32-valve, dual-cam AJ-V8 found in the 4.0L has been around since 1996. It produces 281 horsepower and 287 foot-pounds of torque in the S-Type. It’s a fast and potent motor and one that gives a Jaguar the racy feel it      deserves.\n     The 3.0-liter AJ-V6 that arrived new with the S-Type in 1999 is Jaguar’s first production V-6. At 240 horsepower and 221 foot-pounds of torque, it is smooth and sophisticated. But, at least when compared with the whomping good V-8, it    feels a little unspirited on the road. Perhaps that’s because less than 100 pounds separate the two versions of this car. That means the V-6 has to move nearly the same amount of weight with much less power. Jaguar’s own performance numbers reveal that    while the 4.0L gets from 0 to 60 mph in 6.6 seconds, it takes the 3.0L 8.0 seconds to reach 60 mph.\n      In the end, once a few options are added — our nearly $50,000 test car                                                                            came with a $2,000 navigation system and a $3,200 memory/weather package with moon roof, heated seats and other features — the S-Type 3.0L gets pretty expensive. At that price, the six-cylinder S-Type is no bargain compared with similar models offered by BMW, Lexus, Volvo, Acura and others.\n      \nBMW X5 3.0i\n    In contrast, this new-for-2001 version 3.0i of the X5 sport-utility seems like more of a bargain. Perhaps it’s the      $10,500 sticker flicker between it and the 4.4i V-8 version. Perhaps it’s the great goodness of the new aluminum in-line six powering this all-wheel-drive car-truck.\n     Or perhaps it’s because BMW includes almost all of the good stuff in this cheaper model. That includes safety features like dynamic stability control and the head protection system, which can help keep you from crashing and cushions your noggin in case you do.\n     In terms of performance, a 4.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        X5 with an automatic transmission goes from 0 to 60 mph in 7.5 seconds while a 3.0i X5 does it in 8.6 seconds. The 3.0i weighs 256 pounds less (or 309 pounds less if you pick the X5 3.0i with the manual, a transmission choice that isn’t available on the   4.4i.) On the road, both versions have tight, precise rides — which you’d expect from a BMW but perhaps not from a sport-utility.\n     In this case, a cheaper price makes the X5 3.0i a better choice for many buyers.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: More spacious, luxurious and comfortable than ever, the latest BMW X5 continues to focus more on luxury than a sporty driving experience.\n\nVersus the competition: There are a dozen possibilities in this field, but it’s hard to match the latest 2020 Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class, with its benchmark interior quality, stunning graphics displays and optional adaptive suspension. If you want something truly sporty, an Alfa Romeo Stelvio or Jaguar F-Pace is more appropriate.\n\nThe BMW X5 has been around awhile, but here we have the latest and greatest — a new version that’s grown in every dimension in a quest to go up against the Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class, Lexus RX, Audi Q5, Jaguar F-Pace and a host of other crossover SUVs. The BMW is on a new platform for 2019, one shared with the latest BMW 3 Series sedan, as BMW works toward basing all its vehicles off a minimum number of basic structures to improve cost and simplicity. The X5’s mission: Represent the brand in an ever-growing SUV field that continues to replace the traditional sedan for millions of buyers every year, around the world. But the world is a tough place, full of worthy competitors. How does the latest X5 stack up?\n\nEvolutionary Looks\n\nThe new X5 is clearly a BMW. It’s immediately identifiable as one from a distance, and that’s a good thing. The new SUV may be larger than the old one, but the rear-wheel-drive proportions remain the same, as do many styling cues, including the “twin-kidney” oval grille. A new kick-up in the body-side lines around the rear door adds a little flair to the typical two-box SUV look, but BMW’s stylists did a good job keeping the X5 clean, modern and traditional. Its competitors look good, too; its closest rival is the all-new Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class, which also received a complete (and very attractive) redo on a new platform, though it will arrive later in 2019 as a 2020 model. The Land Rover Discovery matches up well against the new BMW, as does the high-spec version of the Jeep Grand Cherokee, which is often cross-shopped against luxury competitors in its high-dollar trim levels.\n\nA Very Un-BMW Driving Experience\n\nThe surprise of the new X5 comes behind the wheel. Despite the promise of being the Ultimate Driving Machine — a tagline BMW has used for decades now (and which most enthusiasts decry is no longer applicable to most of the company’s products) — the X5’s driving experience is numb and isolated. The powertrain isn’t the problem; the X5’s base engine is a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder pumping out a very healthy 335 horsepower and 330 pounds-feet of torque, mated to an eight-speed automatic and featuring standard all-wheel drive. Its acceleration is impressive: BMW reports a zero-to-60-mph sprint of 5.3 seconds, which we believe given the responsiveness of the throttle and the G-forces it generates when pressed. Braking is also strong; I thought it had excellent firmness, plenty of pedal feedback and a confidence-inspiring feel, though a couple of our editors who drove a different xDrive40i cited mushy pedal feel and nonlinearity, possibly associated with the by-wire nature of the braking system.\n\nThe problem comes with the steering. It’s almost completely numb, with very little in the way of feel or feedback. Its steering ratio is decently quick, which helps the big X5 change direction smartly, but there’s no joy in the driving experience. Making a bad situation worse, the automatic-steering safety systems, such as lane keep assist, constantly adjust the wheel in your hands. So not only does the steering not provide any feedback, it’s also not doing what you want it to do. It’s frenetic and doesn’t inspire any confidence in the driving experience. I tried shutting off all the safety minders and still found the wheel inexplicably dancing in my hands, making me wonder if the cold weather during my drive wasn’t playing havoc with BMW’s steering systems. Regardless, the experience of driving an X5 is not that of an athletic or sporty SUV like you’d find in an Alfa Romeo Stelvio or even the latest Mercedes-Benz GLE, both of which have exceptional handling properties and outstanding steering feedback.\n\nThe BMW’s fuel economy is competitive for the class, ringing in at an EPA-rated 20/26/22 mpg city/highway/combined with the twin-turbo I-6. In my week of testing, I was able to wring 23.5 mpg out of the SUV. By contrast, the standard engine in the rear-wheel-drive Mercedes-Benz GLE350 is a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder making just 255 hp — considerably less than the BMW’s engine, yet with a comparable 19/26/22 mpg rating. The standard engine in a Land Rover Discovery is a 340-hp, supercharged V-6 rated a considerably worse 16/21/18 mpg, while the Jeep Grand Cherokee’s standard 295-hp, 3.6-liter V-6 is rated a less-than-stellar 18/25/21 mpg.\n\nSpacious and Comfortable\n\nIf BMW has skewed its driving characteristics toward luxury in an attempt to mimic more luxurious competitors, that imitation is much more successful when applied to the X5’s interior appointments. The latest interior is spacious, comfortable and can be chock-full of all the latest technology goodies — for a significant cost. Front and center is a new set of fully electronic gauges, and they’re pretty wild. They’re reconfigurable like the ones in a Mercedes-Benz GLE, but much more futuristic and artsy than the Benz’s more traditional layout. Like the GLE, there’s a risk of information overload in the X5, but it’s definitely an attractive layout. BMW included its gimmicky gesture controls in the X5 but for some reason nerfed their utility, so they can be programmed only to do tasks nobody needs done. (We recently found these features useful in the 7 Series, where they controlled volume and track progression.) I also found BMW’s Comfort Access keyless entry to be completely buggy, often not locking or unlocking as it should have and eventually making me shut off the “smart access” system in favor of a more traditional setup.\n\nThe rest of the interior is well-done. Premium materials and high-quality assembly abound, making the X5 feel like a true top-tier luxury vehicle, a step above anything Cadillac, Acura or Infiniti seems able to muster but just on par with the newest stuff from Mercedes-Benz. The front seats are big and comfortable, and there’s plenty of room for two (three in a pinch) in the backseat. There’s an optional third row, but it’s best left to small children. If you’re in the market for a true three-row SUV, the upcoming X7 is a better idea.\n\nThe X5 has plenty of cargo room, rated at 33.9 cubic feet of space behind the second row, expandable to 72.3 cubic feet with the rear seats folded. By comparison, the Land Rover Discovery has 43.5 cubic feet of cargo room, expandable to 88.3 cubic feet, while the Jeep Grand Cherokee has 36.3/68.3 cubic feet. Specs for the new Mercedes-Benz GLE are not yet available.\n\nThe BMW does have a quirk to its cargo area, however: a clamshell two-piece hatch. There’s an upper liftgate portion and a lower tailgate portion, both of which are powered, but the lower portion makes it difficult to load large objects. You can’t easily reach all the way to the seatbacks with the tailgate in the way, though BMW has provided a button in the cargo area that lowers the air suspension.\n\nIntrusive Safety\n\nThe newest X5 passes its crash tests with flying colors. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety rated the BMW a Top Safety Pick Plus, representing top scores for all crashworthiness tests, as well as for crash prevention and mitigation. The X5 also received a four-star overall rating by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nThe brand has upped its standard safety equipment on the latest X5, including forward collision warning, lane departure warning, blind spot detection, and front and rear parking sensors standard. My test vehicle also included the optional Driving Assistance Professional Package, which brings a health-crisis aid along with a bunch of extra driving aids, like hands-free traffic jam assist with stop-and-go, steering and lane control assistant, and evasion aid. While some might see these as useful safety backups, I found them unpleasantly intrusive to the driving experience.\n\nCompetitively Expensive\n\nThe starting price for a 2019 X5 xDrive40i is $61,695, a princely sum to be sure. After adding extras like the Executive Package (remote start, soft-close doors, manual window shades, LED headlights with laser high-beams), an air suspension, 20-inch wheels, M Sport brakes, the Convenience Package (four-zone climate control, satellite radio, Comfort Access keyless entry), the Premium Package (parking assistant, head-up display, Gesture Control multimedia, Wi-Fi hot spot, rearview camera with surround view), running boards, special paint and leather, and a Harman Kardon premium audio system, my grand total rose to $72,530.\n\nMost of the X5’s competitors start several thousand dollars lower than the X5’s base price. The Mercedes-Benz GLE350 starts at $54,695, though that’s not for the all-wheel-drive version; that begins at $57,195. Keep in mind that this version has a much less powerful turbocharged four-cylinder engine, however. If you want something with power comparable to the base engine in an X5, the GLE450 and its turbocharged six-cylinder start at $62,145 including all-wheel drive. The Land Rover Discovery can be had in many forms, but the base price for an SE 4×4 is $53,975 with a supercharged V-6. The Jeep Grand Cherokee starts well below these models, but the trim comparable to the luxury models is the opulent Summit, which starts at $56,190 with the standard V-6 or $59,985 with the big Hemi V-8. Compare all four here.\n\nThere’s a lot to like about the new X5, from its opulence to its style to its comfortable interior, but its driving experience just isn’t one of them — at least, not if you’re expecting the Ultimate Driving Machine. If you’re just looking for a cushy luxury SUV, you’ll find little wrong with the new X5.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Quality, times five\nBMW X5 a substantial SUV choice\n\nFirst warning on the 2004 BMW X5 4.4i: Don’t listen to the hype. BMW has insisted on calling its X5 a “Sports Activity Vehicle” – either a silly attempt to create a new automotive segment or an effort to force a change in the language by continually repeating jargon.\n\nIt’s a little like “embedded,” which no self-respecting journalist dreamed of five years ago. Now, in Iraq, you would think they invented the word.\n\nThe tested X5 4.4i is a sport-utility vehicle – four doors, five seats, rear cargo area, rear seats that fold to make the cargo area bigger. Basic SUV stuff.\n\nOh, and one other thing: It’s an exceptional SUV.\n\nThat’s a good thing because the bottom line on the sticker for the test vehicle was $62,695. That included about $10,000 in gaudy options, the best of which was BMW’s “Sport Package,” with sexy touches such as 19-inch alloy wheels and black chrome exhaust tips.\n\nIf you want a more practical version of the X5 4.4i, the starting fare is $52,100.\n\nBMW models are a blizzard of alphabet soup, but the basic thing you need to know about the X5 4.4i is that it comes equipped with a 4.4-liter V-8 with 315 horsepower and 324 foot-pounds or torque, checking in at 3,600 revolutions per minute.\n\nMatched to a seamless six-speed automatic transmission, an outstanding all-wheel-drive system and independent suspension front and rear, the X5 is the highway bully of your dreams.\n\nOn a run up to Reno and back, the X5 toyed with pretenders trying to match its level of performance. On steep uphill runs, the X5 dug in and effortlessly maintained high speed while shapely sports cars and V-8 sedans gasped and dropped back. Even at the top of a long climb around 7,000 feet, the X5 did not whimper or seek relief through its gearbox.\n\nIf anything, it seemed to yawn and ask for more of a challenge.\n\nOn curves – uphill and down – the X5 was monorail-solid. I was begging the back end to slide out just an inch or two. How about a little bit of body roll?\n\nNo chance.\n\nThe BMW’s suspension and stability control systems functioned flawlessly.\n\nOn the surface streets, the X5 was not so civilized. The tightly wound suspension that made it such a warrior on the open road transmits street imperfections up the spine of the driver and passengers. Making a swift entrance into a typical suburban driveway felt more like hitting a too-tall speed bump at 35 mph.\n\nBut given the choice of freeway fun or sedate surface street manners, I’ll take the former every time.\n\nAppreciation of the X5’s performance goes up the first time you yank open one of its doors – or more accurately, attempt to open one of its doors.\n\nThe first time I tried this, I pulled the driver’s door open about six inches and then lost my grip. The doors are heavy – tank-solid. It’s a nice t hing to know in this age of red light-runners who would just as likely T-bone you as sneeze.\n\nThe heavy doors prompted me to ponder the curb weight of the vehicle, which I pegged at around 4,250 pounds.\n\nNot even close. It’s 4,927.\n\nSo I was whipping a nearly 5,000-pound vehicle around everything that moved on the curvy mountain run up to Reno and back? Now, I’m really impressed with the X5’s capabilities.\n\nEven among fortunate buyers who don’t blink at dropping $60,000-plus on a motor vehicle, those good feelings might sag at the gas pump. The fuel economy ratings for the BMW X5 4.4i are 16 miles per gallon in city driving and 22 mpg on the highway – not bad for a heavy vehicle with a hot-rod V-8 engine.\n\nBut BMW recommends premium unleaded for this X5. With a gas tank holding 24.6 gallons, welcome to the routine $50 fill-up at California gas pumps. Ouch!\n\nThankfully, there are tons of standard features on the X5 – freebies that m ght perhaps soothe the sting of those pricey gas stops. A short list of goodies includes hill-descent control, dual front door-mounted side air bags, rain-sensing windshield wipers, leather-wrapped steering wheel with a power tilt/telescoping feature, heated exterior door mirrors and an in-vehicle electronic tailgate release.\n\nThat last feature is notable because the rear cargo area has a wide opening to take on large or unusually shaped objects. Best to have the tailgate already open when you’re struggling to hang onto that octagon-shaped birdbath.\n\nOne more bonus: It looks nice. The tester actually looked more compact than its 183.7 inches in length and height of 67.5 inches. The front is nicely rounded, drawing attention to the classic BMW double-grille. Riding on gorgeous, five-spoke, 19-inch alloy wheels certainly added to the look and the sporty ambience.\n\nOverall, it’s one sweet, luxury-level SUV.\n\nAnd if you want to call the X5 a Sports Activity Vehicle, fine. Just do it out of my earshot.\n\nBMW X5 at a glance\n\nMake/model: 2004 BMW X5 4.4i.\n\nVehicle type: Five-seat, four-door, all-wheel-drive luxury sport-utility vehicle.\n\nBase price: $52,100 (as tested, $62,695).\n\nEngine: 4.4-liter V-8 with 315 horsepower at 5,400 revolutions per minute and 324 foot-pounds of torque at 3,600 rpm.\n\nEPA fuel economy: 16 miles per gallon city; 22 mpg highway.\n\nTransmission: Six-speed automatic with overdrive and special features.\n\nSteering: Power rack and pinion with speed-sensitive feature.\n\nBrakes: Power four-wheel discs with anti-lock and braking-enhancement features.\n\nSuspension type: Independent strut-type on front; independent, four-link integral on rear (with adjustable ride-height feature).\n\nCargo volume: 69 cubic feet.\n\nFuel tank: 24.6 gallons.\n\nCurb weight: 4,927 pounds.\n\nTrack: 61.4 inches (front and rear).\n\nHeight: 67.2 inches.\n\nLength: 183.7 inches.\n\nWheelbase: 111 inches.\n\nWidth: 73.7 inches.\n\nGround clearance: 7.1 inches.\n\nTires: P255/55R18 all-season radials (standard; 19-inch tires on tested X5 with Sport Package).\n\nTowing capacity: 6,000 pounds.\n\nAssembly site: Spartanburg, S.C",

      "expert_review": "When the 2002 BMW X5 4.6is was delivered, I stood there, looking at its tires.\n\nThe sidewalls were as low as an elephant’s toe.\n\nUp front were 275/40R20s, which looked massive. But they weren’t nearly as massive as the rear 315/35R20s. Yow!\n\nCouple that with the new number on the front fender — 4.6 for the new performance-tuned 340-horsepower V-8 — and you have an SUV that promised a lot more fun on-road than off.\n\nThe X5 is available in three trim levels, 3.0i, 4.4i and 4.6is, the last one being new for 2002.\n\nActually, the big news is the new V-8 model, which takes the 4.4i’s V-8 and enlarges the engine’s size along with adding a host of performance enhancements. They include higher compression, hotter valve timing, an increase in redline from 6,200 rpm to 7,000 rpm and a modified exhaust system.\n\nHooked to a 5-speed ZF Steptronic automatic, this motor allows sportier shifting. Leave it in “D” and the vehicle feels responsive, but sliding the lever to the left engages sport mode, which permits more aggressive shifting. For the ultimate in control, the vehicle can be shifted manually, with the ZF Steptronic being very obedient at holding its gear. Too many of these “manual” automatics override the driver’s wishes; this transmission doesn’t.\n\nThe 4.6is benefits from having the firmest suspension that one can get on an X5. It includes a self-leveling rear air-suspension system to keep rear seat riders on an even keel. Adjustable ride height, available on lesser models, isn’t available on this model.\n\nThe ride is firm, but you’ll never feel road shocks, because the fully independent suspension does an excellent job of absorbing them. There is some side-to-side pitching.\n\nDynamic Stability Control and Hill Descent Control are standard. They add a layer of electronic security to ensure control while rushing through corners or traversing steep grades. All X5s have full-time all-wheel-drive, with a power split of 38 percent to the front wheels, 62 percent of the power to the rear. This rear-wheel bias is what endows the X5 with its stellar handling.\n\nThe speed-sensitive power steering was excellent, communicating the tiniest nuance in road surface, while being quick and accurate. The brakes, already substantial in lesser models of the X5, are upgraded for the 4.6is. All the discs are ventilated and furnish outstanding stopping ability.\n\nYou’ll need the stopping power. The 4.6-liter V-8 supplies enough oomph to ensure big time thrills. BMW says 0-60 mph comes up in a brisk 6.2 seconds. Believe it. You’ll handily outrun many sports sedans. It’s so quick, you’ll wonder why other vehicles are driving so slow. Then you realize you’re going twice the legal limit.\n\nPower is instantaneous, as is fuel consumption. EPA rates this vehicle at 12 mpg city, 17 mpg highway. I easily matched the city figure, but o nly reached 15 mpg on the highway. Overall mileage was 14.5 mpg on premium fuel.\n\nThe X5 has a 6,000-pound trailer-towing rating.\n\nInside, the X5 is premium BMW.\n\nLarge analog gauges consisting of a speedometer, tachometer, engine and oil temperature are clear and easy to read. That’s more than can be said of the optional $1,800 navigation system, which also integrates the audio system and onboard computer. Navigating this digital quagmire is frustrating and counter-intuitive and surprising for a company that prides itself on building ultimate driving machines. When a vehicle is capable of the speeds that the X5 can attain, the fussiness of this system stands out.\n\nThe dual-zone climate control was effective, as were the three- setting seat heaters, which are furnished at all points. The seats themselves are very firm, but do a good job of holding you in place. The front bucket seats even had seat extenders for longer-legged passenge s. This is an idea more automakers should adopt.\n\nThe cargo area is somewhat shallow, but it has a cargo cover and an optional slide-out tray that makes unloading cargo a breeze. It’s also the location of the navigation system and 6-CD changer.\n\nI never did make it off-road, I didn’t want to. The X5 is such a delight, you won’t want to either.\n\nOne thing’s for sure, you’ll never tire of its siren song.\n\nBMW X5 4.6is\n\nEngine: 4.6-liter DOHC V-8\n\nTransmission: 5-speed Steptronic automatic\n\nTires: 275/40R-20, front; 315/35R-20 rear\n\nWheelbase: 111 inches\n\nLength: 183.7 inches\n\nWidth: 73.7 inches\n\nWeight: 4,824 pounds\n\nCargo volume: 23.8 cubic ft., seats up; 54.4 cubic ft., seats down\n\nBase price: $66,845\n\nAs tested: Not available\n\nEPA rating: 12 city, 17 highway\n\nTest mileage: 14.5 mpg\n\nFuel type: Premium\n\nBuilt in: Spartanburg, S.C.",

      "expert_review": "The BMW X5 diesel is a prime example of having your cake and eating it too. A rather expensive cake, mind you.\n\nThe twin-turbo, 3.0-liter diesel accelerates like a sports car, yet it is rated at 19 miles per gallon in the city and 26 on the highway. That’s 25 percent better fuel economy than the gasoline version.\n\nDiesels have been popular in Europe for years, but now they are heading to these shores in cars from Audi, BMW, Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz. They are no longer the loud and smelly engines that many Americans think of when they hear the name. Some argue that advanced diesel engines are more sophisticated than their gasoline counterparts.\n\nBMW’s six-cylinder diesel is a delightful powerplant because it delivers as much torque as the Chevrolet Corvette’s 6.2-liter V-8. BMW said the X5 can scoot to 60 miles per hour in 7.2 seconds.\n\nVariable twin turbos and direct fuel injection with piezo injectors are important factors in the engine’s ability to deliver good fuel economy and gobs of low-end torque. For daily driving, torque is more useful than horsepower, and the BMW diesel delivers its maximum torque at just 1,750 rpm. That means the slightest nudge of the throttle yields immediate motion.\n\nBy driving carefully, I was able to average 22.5 mpg in mostly city driving. A full tank yields 585 miles of highway driving.\n\nLike Audi, VW and Mercedes-Benz, BMW injects urea, called AdBlue, into a catalyst to reduce nitric oxides. The BMW meets the most stringent emission standards of California.\n\nAdBlue needs to be refilled at each oil change. The service will be covered under BMW’s no-charge service for the vehicle’s first four years or 50,000 miles.\n\nThe diesel’s carbon dioxide emissions are 20 percent lower than those of a gasoline engine.\n\nBMW diesel models have qualified for an Internal Revenue Service Advanced Lean Burn Technology Motor Vehicle Tax Credit because the engine burns significantly less fuel and produces significantly fewer greenhouse gas emissions. X5 buyers can qualify for an $1,800 tax credit.\n\nDiesel is not available at every station, and that can be an issue.\n\nEven though the X5 diesel gets excellent fuel economy, it still has the soul of a performance car and it handles more like a sports sedan than a utility vehicle. BMW uses a double-wishbone front suspension, a longer wheelbase, wider track and a revised four-link rear suspension.\n\nX5 options include active steering, active roll stabilization, electronic damping control, rearview camera and variable second-row seating. Active steering varies the steering sensitivity by speed. Active roll stabilization keeps the body flat in turns, and electronic damping provides adjustable shock absorbers.\n\nThe X5’s interior, particularly the instrument panel, is both functional and aesthetic. Large, simple gauges dominate the area in front of the driver, and the center stack has an LCD screen that is used for iDrive as well as the optional navigation system and rearview camera. I’m surprised both aren’t standard on a vehicle in this price segment.\n\nBMW’s iDrive uses a mouselike knob on the console for many functions, including the radio and climate control. Even though iDrive has been simplified and there are separate controls for climate control, the menu system is too complex. Simple tasks are still not as easy as they should be.\n\nIn back, the X5 has fold-flat rear seats, a roomier cargo area and an automatic tailgate. A third seat is optional. The test vehicle was not equipped with the third seat, but I suspect it is pretty snug, given the overall size of the vehicle.\n\nPrice\n\nThe base price of the test vehicle was $51,200. Options included a heated steering wheel, heated front and rear seats, power tailgate, premium sound system, rearview camera, navigation system, head-up display and satellite radio. The sticker price was $65,620.\n\nWarranty\n\nFour years or 50,000 miles.\n\n2009 BMW X5 xDrive35d\n\nEngine: 3.0-liter, 265-hp 6-cyl.\n\nTransmission: Automatic\n\nAll-wheel drive\n\nWheelbase: 115.5 inches\n\nCurb weight: 5,225 lbs.\n\nBase price: $51,200\n\nAs driven: $65,620\n\nMPG ratings: 19 city, 26 hwy.\n\nTom Strongman’s e-mail address is tom@tomstrongman.com.",

      "expert_review": "Imagine my surprise when this luxury Sports Activity Vehicle actually draws blood. When pulling off the covers to get to the Latch connectors, a sharp plastic edge slices right into my fingertip. Thank goodness for leather seats that wipe clean easily.\n\nOnce the offender is safely removed and my finger is bandaged, the Latch connectors prove easy enough to get to. A little elbow grease and three child seats are securely wedged in; great news for the average Joes (or Janes) of the world with 2.5 children. And, eureka, the center seatbelt is positioned just right to fit a child or an adult without chaffing their neck.\n\nWith the assistance of an electronically adjustable seat back (part of a $2,500 Premium Package), my daughter’s booster seat is positioned just right, so as to eliminate dreaded head-bobble in the event that she falls asleep in the car.\n\nAlso a blessing for sleeping children (besides the fact that they’re quiet) are the built-in window shades. These nondescript black shades are hidden when not in use, and pull out from the door and hook at the top of the window when a bit more shade is desired.\n\nTied for first place with the window shades in my book of favorite features is BMW’s Park Distance Control (included free of charge with my test vehicle). Not only does it monitor the rear of the vehicle for possible obstructions, but a separate tone alerts me of potential dangers in front. This makes parallel parking in tight spaces almost easy. Backing up: Beep … Beep … Beep … Beep-Beep. BEEEEEP. Now forward: Deet… Deet… Deet… Deet-Deet. DEEEEEET. Yes, I’m in!\n\nOne thing that continually baffles me about the 2005 BMW X5 is the navigation system. Not only is it near impossible to navigate the navigation system, but for a total price tag topping $62,000 on my test car, you’d think I’d get navigation AND a CD player. Not so. I guess I should consider myself lucky to get a cassette player, although it’s been 10 years or so since I owned a cassette tape. Do they even make those anymore?\n\nThe lovely weather we have during my two week test drive makes it difficult for me to fully experience BMW’s xDrive all wheel drive system. For those of you willing to travel to Spartanburg, South Carolina, you can experience extreme driving conditions in the controlled environment of the BMW Performance Center. A $550 women’s-only clinic is offered and open to all drivers, not just BMW owners.\n\nSomeone traveling to the performance center can anticipate an on-road and “other roads” course that includes driving on a skid pad to simulate black ice conditions and practicing accident avoidance with the help of a water wall. Sign me up! When can I go?\n\nBMW also offers a $400 teen-driving clinic. When my daughters turn 16, you’d better believe we’ll be flying out there. I’m sure they’ll get more value out of intense, real-world driving scenarios than the bland and boring driver’s ed class that I experienced as a teenager. Can you believe that my instructor actually fell asleep in the passenger’s seat during my driving class? Oh, that’s scary!\n\n*For more information on the BMW X5 and its safety features visit Cars.com.\n\nLET’S TALK NUMBERS\n\nLATCH Connectors: 2\n\nSeating Capacity (includes driver): 5\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\n\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 BMW X5?\n\nThe BMW X5 is a mid-size luxury SUV with five seats. The base engine is a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder that makes 375 horsepower and can be had with rear-wheel drive (sDrive40i) or all-wheel drive (xDrive40i). Other powertrains come solely with AWD, including the M60i’s 523-hp, twin-turbo 4.4-liter V-8 and the xDrive50e plug-in hybrid’s 483-hp setup, which delivers an EPA-estimated 40 miles of electric-only driving range. Sitting atop the lineup is a high-performance X5 M, which has 617 hp and track-tuned components. All X5s have an eight-speed automatic transmission. Competitors include the Audi Q7, Genesis GV80, Land Rover Range Rover Sport and Mercedes-Benz GLE.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 BMW X5?\n\nAfter undergoing an extensive refresh last year, the X5 is mostly unchanged for 2025. Among other minor alterations in standard and available equipment, the Driving Assistance Professional Package adds Active Lane Change with eye activation, in which the vehicle will suggest lane changes to the driver when operating in its hands-on semi-autonomous mode. All the driver has to do to initiate the lane change is look at the appropriate mirror; the car will then activate the turn signal and perform the lane change itself. A new, specially trimmed Silver Anniversary Edition commemorates 25 years of the X5. \n\nWhat Features in the 2025 BMW X5 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n12.3-inch digital instrument panel\n14.9-inch multimedia screen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto \nFive USB ports\nNavigation\nPanoramic moonroof\n40/20/40-split backseat\nForward collision warning\nBlind spot warning\nLane departure warning\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\n \n\nAvailable features include: \n\nRemote start\nHead-up display\n360-degree camera system\nBowers & Wilkins surround-sound stereo\nQuad-zone climate control\nInterior ambient lighting\nLow-speed hands-free driving system\nHeated steering wheel\nHeated front- and second-row seats\nVentilated and massaging front seats\nShould I Buy the 2025 BMW X5?\n\nThe X5’s broad range of available powertrains makes it suitable for a variety of preferences and budgets. Regardless of the powertrain under its hood, the X5 boasts high-quality cabin materials, an excellent balance of ride quality and handling prowess, decent cargo volume and ample passenger space. However, we’ve also found some of the active driver aids to be overly sensitive and distracting.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2022 BMW X5?\n\nThe BMW X5 mid-size luxury SUV seats five or seven, depending on the seating configuration. It’s available with rear- or all-wheel drive and is powered by a standard 335-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six engine or a twin-turbo 4.4-liter V-8 that makes 523 hp in the M50i and 600 to 617 hp in the X5 M. A plug-in hybrid variant is also available. All versions have an eight-speed automatic transmission, and competitors include the Audi Q7, Mercedes-Benz GLE and Land Rover Range Rover Sport. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2022 BMW X5?\n\nThe limited-edition Black Vermilion variant of the xDrive40i model joins the lineup this year. It features 22-inch alloy wheels and is painted black with red-accented grille bars and brake calipers. The black-and-red color scheme carries over to the cabin, which is finished in black leather with red piping and accent stitching. Around 350 units are destined for the U.S. \n\nWhat Features in the 2022 BMW X5 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nDigital instrument panel\n12.3-inch multimedia screen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nNavigation\nPanoramic moonroof\n40/20/40-split second-row seat\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nBlind spot warning\nLane departure warning\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nRemote start\nHead-up display\n360-degree camera system\nLow-speed hands-free driving system\nHeated steering wheel\nHeated front and second-row seats\nVentilated and massaging front seats\nShould I Buy the 2022 BMW X5?\n\nThe X5 is a luxurious, comfortable and quick luxury SUV. However, some of its active-safety systems can be too sensitive, and the optional gesture-based control system is gimmicky. The third-row seat is handy, but bear in mind that the space is best left to kids.",

      "expert_review": "Even in its mildest six-cylinder form, the BMW X5 is a cut above and a solid departure from the crowded field of sport utility vehicles.\n\nAlthough the very idea of BMW, the maker of “ultimate driving machines,” marketing an SUV may seem like a sellout, at least the X5 is a tight, crisp-driving truck that combines the versatility of an SUV with BMW’s usual sporty road manners.\n\nBMW doesn’t even call it an SUV but an SAV for “sport activity vehicle.” All well and good, but I’d rather call a spade a spade and an SUV an SUV.\n\nWhat you could call the X5 is an SUV for people who still like to drive. Although most SUVs are tuned for comfort with soft suspensions and modest handling, X5 is stiff and maneuverable. Though its tall profile and hefty weight may limit enthusiastic driving, X5 exhibits the same crisp steering, braking and maneuverability as BMW automobiles.\n\nThis may not be the recipe for a top-drawer off-roader, though the test truck did show some decent trail-handling ability in an excursion up a steep, rutted incline. Coming back down was even easier due to the Hill Descent Control like that found on Land Rovers, which keeps the X5 trundling downhill at a measured pace without any driver input.\n\nThe bulk of X5s and other SUVs never visit any venue more strenuous than a gravel parking lot, but the full-time all-wheel drive should prove valuable for snow country or muddy back roads.\n\nThe test X5 3.0i is the least of three versions in terms of performance. It’s powered by a classic BMW inline six-cylinder engine that displaces 3 liters and develops 225 horsepower, which is gutsy enough for all practical purposes.\n\nThis is the same 3-liter engine that feels so muscular in the compact 3-series cars and the Z3 sports car. But the X5’s more than 4,500-pound curb weight dampens the performance considerably.\n\nFor that, BMW supplies its other two X5s with mighty V-8s. The middle-range 4.4i is propelled by a 290-horsepower mill, while the 4.6is churns out 340 horsepower. I haven’t been in those, but according to reports, they are considerably faster and sportier than the 3.0i.\n\nThat’s fine, but I still thought the test X5 was a pretty sweet vehicle, especially at a solid $10,000 cheaper than the 4.4i or more than $17,000 cheaper than the 4.6is.\n\nThe X5 3.0i comes standard with a five-speed stick shift or, as tested, a Steptronic five-speed automatic that can be shifted manually.\n\nHandling, ride and stability are assisted by several electronic features, including four-wheel traction control; electronic brake proportioning that adjusts braking forces front and rear; Dynamic Brake Control to decrease stopping distances, and stability enhancement for cornering and emergency maneuvers.\n\nThe test truck was outfitted with adjustable ride height, a handy feature for keeping the X5 low for highway travel or raised for rough terrain.\n\nThe interior of the Z5 is expectedly attractive and accommo dating. Materials seem first-rate, seats are roomy and comfortable, and switches and controls are logical and accessible. The cabin seems a bit narrow in comparison with such SUV giants as Lincoln Navigator or Cadillac Escalade, but in line with most compact SUVs.\n\nThe test X5 was loaded with options that pushed its bottom line above $50,000. Options included a $3,900 premium package of leather and wood trim, on-board computer, moonroof, adjustable rear seat back, power passenger seat and other goodies; navigation system, $1,800; automatic transmission, $1,275; adjustable ride height, $1,200; radar-operated parking-distance control, $700; cold-weather package, $750; rear climate package, $600, and automatic dimming mirrors, $300. Shipping was $645.\n\nX5 receives a strong challenge this year from Volkswagen and Porsche, which recently debuted their similar Toureg and Cayenne models, respectively. Both of them, but especially the Porsche, take the same sporty road.\n\nAnd at could end X5’s domination of this singular niche.\n\nBMW X5 3.0I\n\nVehicle type: Five-passenger, four-door sport utility vehicle, all-wheel drive.\n\nBase price: $38,900.\n\nPrice as tested: $50,070.\n\nEngine: 3-liter inline-6, 225 horsepower at 5,900 rpm, 214 pounds-feet torque at 3,500 rpm.\n\nTransmission: Five-speed automatic.\n\nWheelbase: 111 inches.\n\nCurb weight: 4,586 pounds.\n\nEPA mileage: 15 city, 21 highway.\n\nHighs:\n\nTight performance.\n\nAttractive interior.\n\nAdvanced features.\n\nLows:\n\nPricey options.\n\nMild acceleration.\n\nStill drives like a truck.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: With its highly intoxicating twin-turbocharged V-8, the 2024 BMW X5 M60i blurs the line between simply being an X5 with an uplevel engine and a full-blown performance SUV.\n\nVersus the competition: The X5 M60i knows nothing of subtlety, with a racy V-8 engine, dance club interior lighting and angular styling.\n\nThe 2024 BMW X5 five-seat luxury SUV features an updated interior with new displays and control technology, plus a more chiseled exterior and new 48-volt mild-hybrid powertrains across the lineup. If you think that hybrid technology has cost the V-8-powered X5 some of its edge, you’re wrong: In the 2024 X5 M60i, the rip-roaring V-8 makes 523 horsepower.\n\nRelated: New Hybrid Powertrains for Refreshed 2024 BMW X5, X6 Lineup\n\nThe X5 is also available in six-cylinder 40i and plug-in hybrid 50e configurations, as well as a line-topping 617-hp X5 M. For this review, I drove an X5 M60i that, including options, cost around $100,000. I used the X5 for my everyday routine, both carrying around my family of four and enjoying open-road romps sans family; we also performed Cars.com’s standardized cargo and child-safety seat testing.\n\n2024 BMW X5 M60i | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\nM60i V-8 Goodness\n\nWhat stood out most was just how entertaining it was to hit the long pedal on the right. The M60i’s V-8 is powerful, but it’s also engaging and responsive in a way you wouldn’t expect from a mid-range performance car (the X5 M is the top version in the lineup). That said, a couple of years ago, the M60i could have been the M version: It uses a new engine, dubbed S68, versus the outgoing N63 V-8, and that “S” denotes it comes from the M division.\n\nThe 2024 M60i’s natural exhaust sounds are more exotic and less muscular than the old engine’s, which I prefer. It sounds like the spent gases should be coming from something much lower and sleeker, with fewer doors. The engine is snappy and powerful, and it doesn’t feel like there are any shortcomings — except possibly fuel economy, but that comes with the territory when you have over 500 hp in something that weighs 5,355 pounds. What seals the deal on this BMW’s performance is that the eight-speed automatic transmission is in harmony with the engine, and in sport driving modes, the transmission winds out gears like I would if I were driving a manual; it never upshifts beyond where the engine makes its gusto.\n\nThe M60i is rated at the same maximum 523 hp as the outgoing M50i, which lacked hybrid assist. The peak specs don’t show it, but the new mild-hybrid system exerts up to 147 pounds-feet of torque and 12 hp in certain driving conditions. The mild-hybrid system is composed of a 48-volt battery stored under the hood and an electric motor integrated into the eight-speed automatic transmission. This isn’t a system that lets you drive on electric power alone; rather, it gives the car a boost of electrons to smooth out the driving experience and boost fuel economy — but only slightly. Versus the 2023 M50i, it gains just 1 mpg in its EPA city rating and 1 mpg in its combined rating, to 19 mpg combined.\n\nThe 2024 X5 M60i’s 0-60 mph time isn’t any quicker, however; at 4.2 seconds, it’s actually a touch slower than the outgoing M50i’s time of 4.1 seconds, according to BMW. Will you feel that difference? Not likely, but the addition of the hybrid system seems like a lot of work, and cost, for minimal fuel savings and a slower 0-60 mph time.\n\nSurprisingly, ride quality even with 22-inch wheels and standard adaptive suspension (not the optional air suspension) is superb. Our test car was fitted with winter tires, and while you can hear impacts, you can’t feel them — which is impressive considering 22-inch wheels and tires often lead to harsh impacts and ride quality. Other than the faint slap of tires on the road, the cabin resists letting in wind and road noise.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nNew Controls\n\nThe X5’s 14.9-inch horizontally oriented touchscreen houses digital controls for the climate and audio systems; no physical buttons remain, though voice commands do. There’s thankfully still a volume knob, but the lack of physical buttons is a twofold annoyance: It’s harder to hit the right spot on a touchscreen than a button, and many climate settings — like heated seats, the heated armrest, recirculate and zone sync — are buried multiple menus deep. The screen itself is gigantic and high-resolution, though, which makes it well suited for Apple CarPlay. I also enjoyed the digital instrument panel; even though it contains a lot of information, it’s displayed in a way that’s very easy to read and understand.\n\nInterior Size and Quality\n\nThe main sticking point with the X5’s size is its backseat. According to the specs, it isn’t much larger than the BMW X3’s, and carting around my two kids under 6 years old in their car seats wasn’t easy. The rear doors don’t open very wide, which not only made it difficult to get the car seats in and out, but it was harder to help the kids get in and out, too. These points took the X5 down a grade in our Car Seat Check.\n\nThe X5’s cargo area is easy to use because it’s a nice rectangular shape with minimal intrusions, but its 19.3 cubic feet of Cars.com-measured space is on the smaller end in our testing of mid-size two-row SUVs. The Genesis GV80, for one, has 23.5 cubic feet of space; the X5 is more in line with the Jeep Grand Cherokee and all-electric BMW iX, which both have 20.3 cubic feet of cargo space in our testing. The X5 isn’t the biggest SUV in BMW’s lineup anymore, either, so if you need more cargo space or a third row, check out the X7. The X5 has kept its split tailgate/liftgate design instead of switching to the more common single liftgate design. There may be some uses where this is preferred, like sitting on the folded tailgate to watch a kids’ soccer game, but in most cases, I’d prefer not having to lean over the tailgate to retrieve items from the cargo area.\n\nHigher points of the X5’s interior include its materials quality, fit and finish, and colorful ambient lighting, which certainly puts on a show at night (even if the latter was a bit too much for me; I found it so overpowering I turned it off). The carbon fiber looks real, and I didn’t question the M60’s $100,000-or-so (including destination) price tag given the opulence delivered inside.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2024 BMW X5 Plug-In Hybrid EV Range: How Far Can It Go on Electricity Alone?\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2024 BMW X5?\n2024 BMW 5 Series Nabs Top Safety Pick+, X5 Misses the Mark\n2024 BMW X5, X6 M Competitions: Hybrid V-8 Promises Efficiency Boost\nWhich SUVs Can Tow at Least 5,000 Pounds?\nThe $100,000 Question: Is It Worth It?\n\nI didn’t flinch at the $100,000 as-tested price tag of the X5 M60i given its potent, refined powertrain and interior quality; leases in the Chicago area are going for $1,259 per month for 36 months to qualified buyers with a $6,325 down payment at this time of writing. The 2024 M60i’s headlights also perform better in Insurance Institute for Highway Safety testing than the ones in lesser trims. The 2024 X5’s standard headlights earned a marginal performance rating (on a scale of good, acceptable, marginal or poor), which keeps the SUV from being named an IIHS Top Safety Pick — something that’s been rectified for the 2025 model year.\n\nSpeaking of $100,000 performance SUVs, shortly after driving the X5 M60i, I drove an updated 2024 Porsche Cayenne S, which was astonishingly different from the BMW. While the Porsche is no lightweight in terms of curb weight, it was lighter on its feet and felt more coupelike in its cockpit. It’s more well rounded overall than the BMW’s brutish acceleration and dominant presence. As equipped, however, the Porsche I drove was $20,000 more than the BMW, which swings the needle back to the BMW for me.\n\nThere’s still another rung on the X5 ladder above the M60i: the $123,295 X5 M Competition. The X5 M60i, though, makes a compelling case for drivers looking for more-affordable V-8 performance, of which it offers plenty.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: More spacious, luxurious and comfortable than ever, the latest BMW X5 continues to focus more on luxury than a sporty driving experience.\n\nVersus the competition: There are a dozen possibilities in this field, but it’s hard to match the latest 2020 Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class, with its benchmark interior quality, stunning graphics displays and optional adaptive suspension. If you want something truly sporty, an Alfa Romeo Stelvio or Jaguar F-Pace is more appropriate.\n\nThe BMW X5 has been around awhile, but here we have the latest and greatest — a new version that’s grown in every dimension in a quest to go up against the Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class, Lexus RX, Audi Q5, Jaguar F-Pace and a host of other crossover SUVs. The BMW is on a new platform for 2019, one shared with the latest BMW 3 Series sedan, as BMW works toward basing all its vehicles off a minimum number of basic structures to improve cost and simplicity. The X5’s mission: Represent the brand in an ever-growing SUV field that continues to replace the traditional sedan for millions of buyers every year, around the world. But the world is a tough place, full of worthy competitors. How does the latest X5 stack up?\n\nEvolutionary Looks\n\nThe new X5 is clearly a BMW. It’s immediately identifiable as one from a distance, and that’s a good thing. The new SUV may be larger than the old one, but the rear-wheel-drive proportions remain the same, as do many styling cues, including the “twin-kidney” oval grille. A new kick-up in the body-side lines around the rear door adds a little flair to the typical two-box SUV look, but BMW’s stylists did a good job keeping the X5 clean, modern and traditional. Its competitors look good, too; its closest rival is the all-new Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class, which also received a complete (and very attractive) redo on a new platform, though it will arrive later in 2019 as a 2020 model. The Land Rover Discovery matches up well against the new BMW, as does the high-spec version of the Jeep Grand Cherokee, which is often cross-shopped against luxury competitors in its high-dollar trim levels.\n\nA Very Un-BMW Driving Experience\n\nThe surprise of the new X5 comes behind the wheel. Despite the promise of being the Ultimate Driving Machine — a tagline BMW has used for decades now (and which most enthusiasts decry is no longer applicable to most of the company’s products) — the X5’s driving experience is numb and isolated. The powertrain isn’t the problem; the X5’s base engine is a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder pumping out a very healthy 335 horsepower and 330 pounds-feet of torque, mated to an eight-speed automatic and featuring standard all-wheel drive. Its acceleration is impressive: BMW reports a zero-to-60-mph sprint of 5.3 seconds, which we believe given the responsiveness of the throttle and the G-forces it generates when pressed. Braking is also strong; I thought it had excellent firmness, plenty of pedal feedback and a confidence-inspiring feel, though a couple of our editors who drove a different xDrive40i cited mushy pedal feel and nonlinearity, possibly associated with the by-wire nature of the braking system.\n\nThe problem comes with the steering. It’s almost completely numb, with very little in the way of feel or feedback. Its steering ratio is decently quick, which helps the big X5 change direction smartly, but there’s no joy in the driving experience. Making a bad situation worse, the automatic-steering safety systems, such as lane keep assist, constantly adjust the wheel in your hands. So not only does the steering not provide any feedback, it’s also not doing what you want it to do. It’s frenetic and doesn’t inspire any confidence in the driving experience. I tried shutting off all the safety minders and still found the wheel inexplicably dancing in my hands, making me wonder if the cold weather during my drive wasn’t playing havoc with BMW’s steering systems. Regardless, the experience of driving an X5 is not that of an athletic or sporty SUV like you’d find in an Alfa Romeo Stelvio or even the latest Mercedes-Benz GLE, both of which have exceptional handling properties and outstanding steering feedback.\n\nThe BMW’s fuel economy is competitive for the class, ringing in at an EPA-rated 20/26/22 mpg city/highway/combined with the twin-turbo I-6. In my week of testing, I was able to wring 23.5 mpg out of the SUV. By contrast, the standard engine in the rear-wheel-drive Mercedes-Benz GLE350 is a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder making just 255 hp — considerably less than the BMW’s engine, yet with a comparable 19/26/22 mpg rating. The standard engine in a Land Rover Discovery is a 340-hp, supercharged V-6 rated a considerably worse 16/21/18 mpg, while the Jeep Grand Cherokee’s standard 295-hp, 3.6-liter V-6 is rated a less-than-stellar 18/25/21 mpg.\n\nSpacious and Comfortable\n\nIf BMW has skewed its driving characteristics toward luxury in an attempt to mimic more luxurious competitors, that imitation is much more successful when applied to the X5’s interior appointments. The latest interior is spacious, comfortable and can be chock-full of all the latest technology goodies — for a significant cost. Front and center is a new set of fully electronic gauges, and they’re pretty wild. They’re reconfigurable like the ones in a Mercedes-Benz GLE, but much more futuristic and artsy than the Benz’s more traditional layout. Like the GLE, there’s a risk of information overload in the X5, but it’s definitely an attractive layout. BMW included its gimmicky gesture controls in the X5 but for some reason nerfed their utility, so they can be programmed only to do tasks nobody needs done. (We recently found these features useful in the 7 Series, where they controlled volume and track progression.) I also found BMW’s Comfort Access keyless entry to be completely buggy, often not locking or unlocking as it should have and eventually making me shut off the “smart access” system in favor of a more traditional setup.\n\nThe rest of the interior is well-done. Premium materials and high-quality assembly abound, making the X5 feel like a true top-tier luxury vehicle, a step above anything Cadillac, Acura or Infiniti seems able to muster but just on par with the newest stuff from Mercedes-Benz. The front seats are big and comfortable, and there’s plenty of room for two (three in a pinch) in the backseat. There’s an optional third row, but it’s best left to small children. If you’re in the market for a true three-row SUV, the upcoming X7 is a better idea.\n\nThe X5 has plenty of cargo room, rated at 33.9 cubic feet of space behind the second row, expandable to 72.3 cubic feet with the rear seats folded. By comparison, the Land Rover Discovery has 43.5 cubic feet of cargo room, expandable to 88.3 cubic feet, while the Jeep Grand Cherokee has 36.3/68.3 cubic feet. Specs for the new Mercedes-Benz GLE are not yet available.\n\nThe BMW does have a quirk to its cargo area, however: a clamshell two-piece hatch. There’s an upper liftgate portion and a lower tailgate portion, both of which are powered, but the lower portion makes it difficult to load large objects. You can’t easily reach all the way to the seatbacks with the tailgate in the way, though BMW has provided a button in the cargo area that lowers the air suspension.\n\nIntrusive Safety\n\nThe newest X5 passes its crash tests with flying colors. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety rated the BMW a Top Safety Pick Plus, representing top scores for all crashworthiness tests, as well as for crash prevention and mitigation. The X5 also received a four-star overall rating by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nThe brand has upped its standard safety equipment on the latest X5, including forward collision warning, lane departure warning, blind spot detection, and front and rear parking sensors standard. My test vehicle also included the optional Driving Assistance Professional Package, which brings a health-crisis aid along with a bunch of extra driving aids, like hands-free traffic jam assist with stop-and-go, steering and lane control assistant, and evasion aid. While some might see these as useful safety backups, I found them unpleasantly intrusive to the driving experience.\n\nCompetitively Expensive\n\nThe starting price for a 2019 X5 xDrive40i is $61,695, a princely sum to be sure. After adding extras like the Executive Package (remote start, soft-close doors, manual window shades, LED headlights with laser high-beams), an air suspension, 20-inch wheels, M Sport brakes, the Convenience Package (four-zone climate control, satellite radio, Comfort Access keyless entry), the Premium Package (parking assistant, head-up display, Gesture Control multimedia, Wi-Fi hot spot, rearview camera with surround view), running boards, special paint and leather, and a Harman Kardon premium audio system, my grand total rose to $72,530.\n\nMost of the X5’s competitors start several thousand dollars lower than the X5’s base price. The Mercedes-Benz GLE350 starts at $54,695, though that’s not for the all-wheel-drive version; that begins at $57,195. Keep in mind that this version has a much less powerful turbocharged four-cylinder engine, however. If you want something with power comparable to the base engine in an X5, the GLE450 and its turbocharged six-cylinder start at $62,145 including all-wheel drive. The Land Rover Discovery can be had in many forms, but the base price for an SE 4×4 is $53,975 with a supercharged V-6. The Jeep Grand Cherokee starts well below these models, but the trim comparable to the luxury models is the opulent Summit, which starts at $56,190 with the standard V-6 or $59,985 with the big Hemi V-8. Compare all four here.\n\nThere’s a lot to like about the new X5, from its opulence to its style to its comfortable interior, but its driving experience just isn’t one of them — at least, not if you’re expecting the Ultimate Driving Machine. If you’re just looking for a cushy luxury SUV, you’ll find little wrong with the new X5.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in March 2009 about the 2009 BMW X5 xDrive35d. For 2010, BMW gave the X5 a next-generation iDrive interface — addressing a major issue we had with the 2009 model. To see other changes for 2010, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years. \n  Aside from a low clatter at startup, there are few initial signs that BMW’s diesel-powered X5 is a different sort of beast. Drive it you must, though, because diesel power is addictive. As is the case with most diesels, the X5 xDrive35d loses some high-revving zing compared to its gas-powered siblings, but it gains enough thrust off the line to send the kids’ iPods flying. The resulting mileage is equally impressive, even after you account for the higher cost of diesel.\n  Whether the X5 is worth considering in the luxury crossover category is open to question. Now in its third year, the current generation has a number of unaddressed shortcomings. As an upscale people-hauler, it works well enough. As a consummate luxury car costing $50,000, it falls a bit short. That said, if you’re considering getting an X5, the diesel version is the one to look at — provided your local gas station sells diesel.\n  The X5 comes with three drivetrains, all labeled xDrive because they get standard all-wheel drive. (Click here to compare the 2009 and 2008 X5s.) Gas models include the six-cylinder xDrive30i and the V-8 xDrive48i. I tested the diesel six-cylinder xDrive35d that BMW added for 2009, but I’ve also driven the V-8.\n  Diesel Power  Drive a diesel and you’ll likely notice the characteristic extra power when you’re pulling away from a stoplight. That comes from low-end torque diesels typically produce. The X5 xDrive35d has a huge reserve early on that propels the 5,225-pound SUV like a freight train. Though it gives up some high-revving power to the xDrive48i’s V-8, in everyday driving, it feels even beefier. I noticed some accelerator lag early on, but by the end of the week the SUV moved without hesitation — perhaps the result of its adaptive drivetrain logic, something many cars employ. In comparison, Mercedes’ turbo-diesel ML320 and GL320 Bluetecs exhibit annoying — and potentially dangerous — accelerator lag no matter how long you drive them.\n  BMW’s six-speed automatic is pretty efficient at upshifting, so the engine remains in its beefiest range more often than not, even under hard acceleration. It’s a far smoother gearbox than BMW’s earlier six-speed automatics, particularly those in the X3 crossover and early versions of the current 3 Series. Upshifts are smooth and well-timed, and highway kickdown happens with little delay.\n  Skeptics will recall the noisy sound and sooty exhaust from decades of diesel cars, but thanks to a host of new technologies, today’s models are far cleaner. That makes diesel’s mileage benefits far more attractive:\n\n\n\n     X5 Drivetrains Compared\n\n\n\n      \n     xDrive35d\n\n     xDrive30i\n\n     xDrive48i\n\n\n\n     Base price\n\n     $51,200\n\n     $47,500\n\n     $56,200\n\n\n\n     Drivetrain\n\n     3.0-liter turbo-diesel inline-six; six-speed auto\n\n     3.0-liter inline-six; six-speed auto\n\n     4.8-liter V-8; six-speed auto\n\n\n\n     Horsepower (@ rpm)\n\n     265 @ 4,200\n\n     260 @ 6,600\n\n     350 @ 6,300\n\n\n\n     Torque (lbs.-ft. @ rpm)\n\n     425 @ 1,750 – 2,250\n\n     225 @ 2,750\n\n     350 @ 3,400\n\n\n\n     Zero to 60 mph, sec.\n\n     6.9\n\n     7.8\n\n     6.4\n\n\n\n     EPA combined mileage (mpg)\n\n     22\n\n     18\n\n     16\n\n\n\n     Required fuel\n\n     Diesel\n\n     Premium unleaded\n\n     Premium unleaded\n\n\n\n     Max. towing capacity (lbs.)\n\n     6,000\n\n     6,000\n\n     6,000\n\n\n\n     Source: EPA and automaker data\n\n\n\n\n  It’s worth noting that the xDrive35d’s mileage slightly beats two major diesel competitors, the ML320 Bluetec and the forthcoming Audi Q7 3.0 TDI. Both achieve 20 mpg in combined city/highway driving, though Audi’s figure is still a preliminary estimate. It’s particularly impressive that the diesel X5 beats those SUVs’ numbers while out-accelerating them by more than a second in zero to 60 times, according to their respective manufacturers.\n  Ride & Handling  The X5 finds a sweet spot between SUV ride comfort and BMW athleticism — far better than the X6, which is two parts BMW to one part SUV. The X5’s ride quality is very good, as the suspension isolates the cabin from most bumps, but it retains a well-connected feeling with the road. You don’t get the floaty steering response over broken pavement that truck-based competitors like the Lexus GX 470 exhibit. The X5 has some body roll over curvy roads and quick, if not quite laser-like, response to steering inputs. The wheel turns with medium effort, but the turning circle is 42 feet, which is pretty wide for this class.\n  My test car had excessive squeaks and rattles — originating in areas from the A-pillars to the cargo area — but temperatures were in the 20s for much of my time with it. Those conditions produce noises in many cars we test, so be sure to take a good listen on your test drive. On the upside, there wasn’t excessive road or wind noise in the cabin, even at 70 mph.\n  The standard four-wheel-disc antilock brakes feel strong, though the pedal is a bit too touchy for smooth stops. My test car wasn’t equipped with the Sport Package, which swaps the 18-inch wheels for 19-inchers and adds an adaptive suspension that actively counteracts body roll. BMW’s Active Steering system is optional on the gasoline xDrive30i and xDrive48i but unavailable on the xDrive35d. It alters the steering ratio for easier turning at low speeds and more gradual response at higher speeds. Both options affect the driving experience, so be sure to test them if you’re interested.\n  Lingering Issues  The X5 hasn’t aged well. The styling — unchanged since the second generation hit dealerships in late 2006 — looks expressive up front but ham-handed in back. From the glove compartment to the center controls, the dashboard has a number of unsightly panel gaps, something editor Mike Hanley noted in his review of the 2007 model that BMW has yet to address. The same goes for the iDrive system, the knob-based interface that controls the navigation system, stereo and more. It’s as vexing as ever. BMW has installed a vastly improved fourth-generation iDrive across most of its lineup, but the X5 reportedly won’t get it until 2010. That alone could make waiting to buy this SUV worth it.\n  Reliability, too, could stand to improve. Though the xDrive35d technically represents a new — and unproven — drivetrain, its gas siblings have unimpressive track records. According to Consumer Reports’ owner surveys, the X5 has worse than average reliability for the six-cylinder and much worse than average reliability for the V-8. That’s generally better than the Q7 but worse than the M-Class. Japanese competitors like the GX 470 and Acura MDX beat all three.\n  It isn’t all bad. The X5’s cabin has characteristic BMW materials, with real wood and metal trim and soft-touch materials in places many luxury models stash harder, cheaper plastics. The front seats — 20-way power chairs in my test car — offer equal parts comfort and support. The second row has enough headroom and legroom for adults; my test car lacked the optional third row, but in the three-row X5 we tested two years ago, the back row was clearly best suited for kids.\n  With top marks in front, side and rear-impact tests, the X5 earned a Top Safety Pick designation from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. Click here to see the full list of safety features. Note: If you get the optional third row, the side curtain airbags don’t extend to cover it.\n  Crunching the Numbers  Prices for the X5 start at $47,500 for the xDrive30i; the diesel costs $51,200 and the lineup peaks at the $56,200 xDrive48i. Standard features include faux leather upholstery, power front seats, a panoramic moonroof and a 12-speaker CD stereo. Typical of BMW, there’s a smorgasbord of options: heated and ventilated seats, genuine leather, a navigation system, the third-row seat, 16-speaker audio and much more. Check all the boxes, and a fully loaded model tops out above $80,000.\n  Under the IRS’ Advanced Lean Burn Technology Vehicles program, the X5 diesel is eligible for an $1,800 federal tax credit, double what the ML320 Bluetec qualifies for (Q7 TDI credits aren’t yet available). Remember that tax credits go straight to your bottom line, as opposed to tax deductions, which simply lower your taxable income. The credit shaves the xDrive35d’s premium over the xDrive30i to just $1,900 — a reasonable cost for the diesel’s extra oomph.\n  The other cost to consider is fuel. Due mostly to supply and demand, diesel fuel costs more than gasoline: As of this writing, AAA’s national average cost for diesel fuel was $2.21 per gallon, versus $2.13 for premium unleaded. Because of diesel’s increased efficiency, however, the xDrive35d still saves about 15 percent in annual fuel costs versus the xDrive30i and 25 percent versus the xDrive48i.\n  X5 Diesel in the Market  From a driver’s perspective, the diesel X5 is a worthy effort: quick on its feet and agile when it needs to be, yet comfortable for the long haul. Well-to-do families might still give it a look — and, judging by the X5’s relative popularity, many of them have.\n  On the whole, though, too many aspects sink this BMW. Better reliability and a revamped iDrive alone could change its lot, so there certainly is hope down the road. Today’s model, diesel or not, is still a few steps short of justifying its price tag.\n\n\n\n     Send Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: More spacious, luxurious and comfortable than ever, the latest BMW X5 continues to focus more on luxury than a sporty driving experience.\n\nVersus the competition: There are a dozen possibilities in this field, but it’s hard to match the latest 2020 Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class, with its benchmark interior quality, stunning graphics displays and optional adaptive suspension. If you want something truly sporty, an Alfa Romeo Stelvio or Jaguar F-Pace is more appropriate.\n\nThe BMW X5 has been around awhile, but here we have the latest and greatest — a new version that’s grown in every dimension in a quest to go up against the Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class, Lexus RX, Audi Q5, Jaguar F-Pace and a host of other crossover SUVs. The BMW is on a new platform for 2019, one shared with the latest BMW 3 Series sedan, as BMW works toward basing all its vehicles off a minimum number of basic structures to improve cost and simplicity. The X5’s mission: Represent the brand in an ever-growing SUV field that continues to replace the traditional sedan for millions of buyers every year, around the world. But the world is a tough place, full of worthy competitors. How does the latest X5 stack up?\n\nEvolutionary Looks\n\nThe new X5 is clearly a BMW. It’s immediately identifiable as one from a distance, and that’s a good thing. The new SUV may be larger than the old one, but the rear-wheel-drive proportions remain the same, as do many styling cues, including the “twin-kidney” oval grille. A new kick-up in the body-side lines around the rear door adds a little flair to the typical two-box SUV look, but BMW’s stylists did a good job keeping the X5 clean, modern and traditional. Its competitors look good, too; its closest rival is the all-new Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class, which also received a complete (and very attractive) redo on a new platform, though it will arrive later in 2019 as a 2020 model. The Land Rover Discovery matches up well against the new BMW, as does the high-spec version of the Jeep Grand Cherokee, which is often cross-shopped against luxury competitors in its high-dollar trim levels.\n\nA Very Un-BMW Driving Experience\n\nThe surprise of the new X5 comes behind the wheel. Despite the promise of being the Ultimate Driving Machine — a tagline BMW has used for decades now (and which most enthusiasts decry is no longer applicable to most of the company’s products) — the X5’s driving experience is numb and isolated. The powertrain isn’t the problem; the X5’s base engine is a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder pumping out a very healthy 335 horsepower and 330 pounds-feet of torque, mated to an eight-speed automatic and featuring standard all-wheel drive. Its acceleration is impressive: BMW reports a zero-to-60-mph sprint of 5.3 seconds, which we believe given the responsiveness of the throttle and the G-forces it generates when pressed. Braking is also strong; I thought it had excellent firmness, plenty of pedal feedback and a confidence-inspiring feel, though a couple of our editors who drove a different xDrive40i cited mushy pedal feel and nonlinearity, possibly associated with the by-wire nature of the braking system.\n\nThe problem comes with the steering. It’s almost completely numb, with very little in the way of feel or feedback. Its steering ratio is decently quick, which helps the big X5 change direction smartly, but there’s no joy in the driving experience. Making a bad situation worse, the automatic-steering safety systems, such as lane keep assist, constantly adjust the wheel in your hands. So not only does the steering not provide any feedback, it’s also not doing what you want it to do. It’s frenetic and doesn’t inspire any confidence in the driving experience. I tried shutting off all the safety minders and still found the wheel inexplicably dancing in my hands, making me wonder if the cold weather during my drive wasn’t playing havoc with BMW’s steering systems. Regardless, the experience of driving an X5 is not that of an athletic or sporty SUV like you’d find in an Alfa Romeo Stelvio or even the latest Mercedes-Benz GLE, both of which have exceptional handling properties and outstanding steering feedback.\n\nThe BMW’s fuel economy is competitive for the class, ringing in at an EPA-rated 20/26/22 mpg city/highway/combined with the twin-turbo I-6. In my week of testing, I was able to wring 23.5 mpg out of the SUV. By contrast, the standard engine in the rear-wheel-drive Mercedes-Benz GLE350 is a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder making just 255 hp — considerably less than the BMW’s engine, yet with a comparable 19/26/22 mpg rating. The standard engine in a Land Rover Discovery is a 340-hp, supercharged V-6 rated a considerably worse 16/21/18 mpg, while the Jeep Grand Cherokee’s standard 295-hp, 3.6-liter V-6 is rated a less-than-stellar 18/25/21 mpg.\n\nSpacious and Comfortable\n\nIf BMW has skewed its driving characteristics toward luxury in an attempt to mimic more luxurious competitors, that imitation is much more successful when applied to the X5’s interior appointments. The latest interior is spacious, comfortable and can be chock-full of all the latest technology goodies — for a significant cost. Front and center is a new set of fully electronic gauges, and they’re pretty wild. They’re reconfigurable like the ones in a Mercedes-Benz GLE, but much more futuristic and artsy than the Benz’s more traditional layout. Like the GLE, there’s a risk of information overload in the X5, but it’s definitely an attractive layout. BMW included its gimmicky gesture controls in the X5 but for some reason nerfed their utility, so they can be programmed only to do tasks nobody needs done. (We recently found these features useful in the 7 Series, where they controlled volume and track progression.) I also found BMW’s Comfort Access keyless entry to be completely buggy, often not locking or unlocking as it should have and eventually making me shut off the “smart access” system in favor of a more traditional setup.\n\nThe rest of the interior is well-done. Premium materials and high-quality assembly abound, making the X5 feel like a true top-tier luxury vehicle, a step above anything Cadillac, Acura or Infiniti seems able to muster but just on par with the newest stuff from Mercedes-Benz. The front seats are big and comfortable, and there’s plenty of room for two (three in a pinch) in the backseat. There’s an optional third row, but it’s best left to small children. If you’re in the market for a true three-row SUV, the upcoming X7 is a better idea.\n\nThe X5 has plenty of cargo room, rated at 33.9 cubic feet of space behind the second row, expandable to 72.3 cubic feet with the rear seats folded. By comparison, the Land Rover Discovery has 43.5 cubic feet of cargo room, expandable to 88.3 cubic feet, while the Jeep Grand Cherokee has 36.3/68.3 cubic feet. Specs for the new Mercedes-Benz GLE are not yet available.\n\nThe BMW does have a quirk to its cargo area, however: a clamshell two-piece hatch. There’s an upper liftgate portion and a lower tailgate portion, both of which are powered, but the lower portion makes it difficult to load large objects. You can’t easily reach all the way to the seatbacks with the tailgate in the way, though BMW has provided a button in the cargo area that lowers the air suspension.\n\nIntrusive Safety\n\nThe newest X5 passes its crash tests with flying colors. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety rated the BMW a Top Safety Pick Plus, representing top scores for all crashworthiness tests, as well as for crash prevention and mitigation. The X5 also received a four-star overall rating by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nThe brand has upped its standard safety equipment on the latest X5, including forward collision warning, lane departure warning, blind spot detection, and front and rear parking sensors standard. My test vehicle also included the optional Driving Assistance Professional Package, which brings a health-crisis aid along with a bunch of extra driving aids, like hands-free traffic jam assist with stop-and-go, steering and lane control assistant, and evasion aid. While some might see these as useful safety backups, I found them unpleasantly intrusive to the driving experience.\n\nCompetitively Expensive\n\nThe starting price for a 2019 X5 xDrive40i is $61,695, a princely sum to be sure. After adding extras like the Executive Package (remote start, soft-close doors, manual window shades, LED headlights with laser high-beams), an air suspension, 20-inch wheels, M Sport brakes, the Convenience Package (four-zone climate control, satellite radio, Comfort Access keyless entry), the Premium Package (parking assistant, head-up display, Gesture Control multimedia, Wi-Fi hot spot, rearview camera with surround view), running boards, special paint and leather, and a Harman Kardon premium audio system, my grand total rose to $72,530.\n\nMost of the X5’s competitors start several thousand dollars lower than the X5’s base price. The Mercedes-Benz GLE350 starts at $54,695, though that’s not for the all-wheel-drive version; that begins at $57,195. Keep in mind that this version has a much less powerful turbocharged four-cylinder engine, however. If you want something with power comparable to the base engine in an X5, the GLE450 and its turbocharged six-cylinder start at $62,145 including all-wheel drive. The Land Rover Discovery can be had in many forms, but the base price for an SE 4×4 is $53,975 with a supercharged V-6. The Jeep Grand Cherokee starts well below these models, but the trim comparable to the luxury models is the opulent Summit, which starts at $56,190 with the standard V-6 or $59,985 with the big Hemi V-8. Compare all four here.\n\nThere’s a lot to like about the new X5, from its opulence to its style to its comfortable interior, but its driving experience just isn’t one of them — at least, not if you’re expecting the Ultimate Driving Machine. If you’re just looking for a cushy luxury SUV, you’ll find little wrong with the new X5.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The redesigned 2014 BMW X5 carries on its winning formula of being a stylish, expensive, luxurious SUV for secret station-wagon fans who prefer to sit up high.\n\nAmericans don’t like station wagons anymore — or so automakers keep telling us — which is why we have the BMW X5 xDrive35i, a tall, car-based SUV that has replaced the 5 Series wagon for BMW-loving U.S. buyers of family luxury cars. It may not look like a new vehicle, but the X5 is a complete redesign for 2014, with some new standard equipment, like the latest iDrive multimedia system with a touchpad and BMW Apps, plus automatic stop-start for the engine, a 40/20/40-split folding backseat and speed-sensitive power steering. For the first time ever, a less-expensive rear-wheel-drive model is also available, the X5 sDrive35i. See a comparison of the 2013 and 2014 models here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nIf you’re having trouble telling the 2014 model from last year’s, we don’t blame you. It doesn’t look different at all, just a slightly sleeker version of the familiar shape. All the BMW styling cues are there, including the “twin-kidney” grille (that really doesn’t look like kidneys anymore), the sweeping headlights, the character line running down the side, and the high taillights, which are now LEDs. It looks as it always has: like a tall 5 Series wagon. That’s not a bad thing, as it’s an attractive shape. Given BMW’s sales success with the X5, I guess it’s decided not to mess too much with a winning formula.\n\nHow It Drives\nMy test car was an BMW X5 xDrive35i, which is something of a mouthful that needs decoding: xDrive is BMW-speak for all-wheel drive (sDrive is rear-wheel drive) and 35i signifies the gasoline six-cylinder engine, even though BMW nomenclature no longer matches up to engine displacement. All engines are mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive with the exception of the gas six-cylinder, where all-wheel drive is optional.\n\nThe BMW X5 I drove is powered by a twin-turbocharged, 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder engine making a nice, round 300 horsepower. Acceleration with the twin-turbo I-6 is strong but not extraordinary. Power is available in just about any situation, and the eight-speed easily keeps the X5 in its power band. Engage Sport mode and the BMW X5 will stay in a lower gear, improving shift and throttle response time. Switch to the EcoPro mode if you want to try and eke out an extra mpg or two.\n\nHandling is smooth and steering is firm and communicative, as one might expect from a BMW. The brakes are equally firm, and the combination gives the BMW a more athletic feel than competitors like the Mercedes-Benz ML350, Land Rover LR4 or Jeep Grand Cherokee. There’s no agile or lightweight feel to the X5, just a heft that gives a feeling of solidity and quality. That heft translates into quiet, confident highway behavior that eats up miles of asphalt with ease. A sport suspension package is optional.\n\nStepping up to the X5 xDrive50i replaces the I-6 with a 445-hp, turbo 4.4-liter V-8, or you can get a 255-hp, turbocharged diesel six-cylinder in the X5 xDrive35d if you want to chase fuel economy.\n\nEven without the diesel engine, fuel economy is decent for a big five-seat SUV, with an EPA rating of 18/27/21 mpg city/highway/combined with all-wheel drive. My week in the BMW X5 included a jaunt from Ann Arbor, Mich., to Lexington, Ky., with the X5 returning 27 mpg on the highway and overall performance for the week of 23 mpg. This is considerably better than most of its competitors’ EPA estimates. The Mercedes-Benz ML350 is rated 17/22/19 mpg, the Jeep Grand Cherokee V-6 comes in at 17/24/19 mpg, and the Land Rover LR4 is rated a dismal 14/19/16 mpg. All but the Land Rover do offer diesel power, if you’re looking for fuel economy and torquey performance. The BMW X5 xDrive35d’s diesel engine boosts fuel economy to 23/31/26 mpg, while the ML350 Bluetec gets 20/28/23 mpg and the Jeep Grand Cherokee EcoDiesel is rated 21/28/24 mpg.\n\nInterior\nIt’s familiar BMW territory inside, too, with shapes and forms that have become common across all the brand’s vehicles. Material quality is top-notch, as are all the switches and knobs — with the exception of the transmission shifter. It’s a paddle-type affair that’s imprecise, tricky to use and unfortunately common among BMW vehicles.\n\nA big, chunky steering wheel covered in quality leather sits in front of large, clear gauges. The front seats are very supportive, widely adjustable and covered in excellent leather. The rear leather seats have plenty of legroom but feel low to the floor, resulting in a knees-up seating posture that gets tiring. A small third-row seat is also available as a $1,700 option, but my test vehicle was not equipped with this feature. Visibility is good in all directions, thanks to a high seating position for the driver and a tall roofline that allows for big windows all around. The standard panoramic moonroof also brings a lot of light into the interior, which was welcome in my tester, given the deep, dark mocha brown leather and poplar wood trim that adorned it.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nBMW’s latest version of iDrive comes standard in the X5, and it continues to improve with each generation. The display screen is now a separate styling element in the dashboard, a sizeable 10.2-inch LCD mounted atop the dash and controlled via a rotary knob on the center console. BMW has new app capability that includes interfaces with a number of mobile-device apps and streaming audio programs. I connected my iPhone5 and used the Glympse app, controlled through the iDrive system, to send a real-time location update to friends who were expecting me as I drove to Kentucky, and the interface worked flawlessly.\n\nI was less thrilled about BMW’s available head-up display on the windshield and the standard rain-sensing wipers. The head-up display projects all manner of information, from navigation to audio data, onto the windshield, but disappears completely when one puts on polarized sunglasses. Being this far into the 21st century, you’d think BMW would have figured out a way to solve that. The rain-sensing wipers didn’t seem to be able to accurately sense when there was sufficient water on the windshield to wipe; I found myself doing it manually more often than not, as the rain-sense function takes the place of a simple intermittent interval.\n\nCargo & Storage\nBeing a midsize SUV on the big end of that category, the BMW X5 should have competitive cargo room, but it doesn’t. While the cargo area is certainly tall and wide, the load floor is very high, making it a chore to load bulky or heavy objects. There’s not as much room in the X5’s cargo area as there is in competitors’ vehicles, either — 22.9 cubic feet of cargo room (66.0 when the rear seats are folded) versus 38.2 cubic feet (80.3 maximum) for the ML350, 36.3 for the Grand Cherokee (68.3) and a whopping 44.5 cubic feet in the LR4 (87.4).\n\nSafety\nWhile the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has not tested the 2014 BMW X5, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave the SUV its top rating of good in its first two tests and called its front-crash protection superior (additional crash tests hadn’t been performed as of publication). See the test results here.\n\nLike most luxury cars, the BMW X5 has a long list of electronic safety features — and like in most BMWs, they cost extra. You get bi-xenon headlights and parking sensors standard, but things like a backup camera, a blind spot monitor, forward collision warning with automatic braking, automatic cruise control and a surround-view camera are optional. You can view all the BMW X5’s safety equipment here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe many versions of the X5 start with the rear-wheel-drive, gasoline six-cylinder BMW X5 sDrive35i at $53,750, including destination charge. My test vehicle was the next level up: an all-wheel-drive, gasoline six-cylinder xDrive35i that started at $56,050, but which quickly climbed to $70,975 thanks to several option packages. Things like the Luxury Line package, which adds 19-inch alloy wheels, a sport steering wheel and satin roof rails, added $1,700. The Cold Weather Package, with its heated steering wheel, heated rear seats and headlight washers added $550, while the Driver Assistance Package tacked on another $1,400 for a backup camera and head-up display. The Driver Assistance Plus Package added a blind spot monitoring system, automatic cruise control and a surround view camera for $1,900. Full LED headlights with automatic high beams cost another $1,900, while a Premium Package with keyless entry, soft-close doors and satellite radio cost an astonishing $2,700. As with most BMWs, the X5 gets you on the options.\n\nThe X5 has plenty of competitors, but the biggest one may be the Mercedes-Benz ML-Class. The ML350 matches up quite well with the X5 in nearly every way — power, prestige and passenger space. It bests the X5 in cargo capacity and price but falls short in fuel economy, even when comparing diesel models.\n\nThe Jeep Grand Cherokee should be mentioned as well. Even though its starting price is considerably less than that of the BMW X5, a loaded Summit model with all-wheel drive and a V-6 comes within a couple grand of the X5’s starting price and features a competitive luxurious interior, an easier-to-use multimedia system, more cargo space and genuine all-road capability. Nothing in the category, though, can touch the Land Rover LR4 for off-road prowess, and it also features a more powerful V-6 engine than the BMW X5 and much more interior space (thanks to its boxier styling) for less money. It does not, however, offer a diesel or V-8 version. Compare all four competitors here.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in July 2014 about the 2014 BMW X5. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2015, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe redesigned 2014 BMW X5 carries on its winning formula of being a stylish, expensive, luxurious SUV for secret station-wagon fans who prefer to sit up high.\n\nAmericans don’t like station wagons anymore — or so automakers keep telling us — which is why we have the BMW X5 xDrive35i, a tall, car-based SUV that has replaced the 5 Series wagon for BMW-loving U.S. buyers of family luxury cars. It may not look like a new vehicle, but the X5 is a complete redesign for 2014, with some new standard equipment, like the latest iDrive multimedia system with a touchpad and BMW Apps, plus automatic stop-start for the engine, a 40/20/40-split folding backseat and speed-sensitive power steering. For the first time ever, a less-expensive rear-wheel-drive model is also available, the X5 sDrive35i. See a comparison of the 2013 and 2014 models here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nIf you’re having trouble telling the 2014 model from last year’s, we don’t blame you. It doesn’t look different at all, just a slightly sleeker version of the familiar shape. All the BMW styling cues are there, including the “twin-kidney” grille (that really doesn’t look like kidneys anymore), the sweeping headlights, the character line running down the side, and the high taillights, which are now LEDs. It looks as it always has: like a tall 5 Series wagon. That’s not a bad thing, as it’s an attractive shape. Given BMW’s sales success with the X5, I guess it’s decided not to mess too much with a winning formula.\n\nHow It Drives\nMy test car was an X5 xDrive35i, which is something of a mouthful that needs decoding: xDrive is BMW-speak for all-wheel drive (sDrive is rear-wheel drive) and 35i signifies the gasoline six-cylinder engine, even though BMW nomenclature no longer matches up to engine displacement. All engines are mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive with the exception of the gas six-cylinder, where all-wheel drive is optional.\n\nThe X5 I drove is powered by a twin-turbocharged, 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder engine making a nice, round 300 horsepower. Acceleration with the twin-turbo I-6 is strong but not extraordinary. Power is available in just about any situation, and the eight-speed easily keeps the X5 in its power band. Engage Sport mode and the X5 will stay in a lower gear, improving shift and throttle response time. Switch to the EcoPro mode if you want to try and eke out an extra mpg or two.\n\nHandling is smooth and steering is firm and communicative, as one might expect from a BMW. The brakes are equally firm, and the combination gives the BMW a more athletic feel than competitors like the Mercedes-Benz ML350, Land Rover LR4 or Jeep Grand Cherokee. There’s no agile or lightweight feel to the X5, just a heft that gives a feeling of solidity and quality. That heft translates into quiet, confident highway behavior that eats up miles of asphalt with ease. A sport suspension package is optional.\n\nStepping up to the X5 xDrive50i replaces the I-6 with a 445-hp, turbocharged 4.4-liter V-8, or you can get a 255-hp, turbocharged diesel six-cylinder in the X5 xDrive35d if you want to chase fuel economy.\n\nEven without the diesel engine, fuel economy is decent for a big five-seat SUV, with an EPA rating of 18/27/21 mpg city/highway/combined with all-wheel drive. My week in the X5 included a jaunt from Ann Arbor, Mich., to Lexington, Ky., with the X5 returning 27 mpg on the highway and overall performance for the week of 23 mpg. This is considerably better than most of its competitors’ EPA estimates. The Mercedes-Benz ML350 is rated 17/22/19 mpg, the Jeep Grand Cherokee V-6 comes in at 17/24/19 mpg, and the Land Rover LR4 is rated a dismal 14/19/16 mpg. All but the Land Rover do offer diesel power, if you’re looking for fuel economy and torquey performance. The BMW X5 xDrive35d’s diesel engine boosts fuel economy to 23/31/26 mpg, while the ML350 Bluetec gets 20/28/23 mpg and the Jeep Grand Cherokee EcoDiesel is rated 21/28/24 mpg.\n\nInterior\nIt’s familiar BMW territory inside, too, with shapes and forms that have become common across all the brand’s vehicles. Material quality is top-notch, as are all the switches and knobs — with the exception of the transmission shifter. It’s a paddle-type affair that’s imprecise, tricky to use and unfortunately common among BMW vehicles.\n\nA big, chunky steering wheel covered in quality leather sits in front of large, clear gauges. The front seats are very supportive, widely adjustable and covered in excellent leather. The rear seats have plenty of legroom but feel low to the floor, resulting in a knees-up seating posture that gets tiring. A small third-row seat is also available as a $1,700 option, but my test vehicle was not equipped with this feature. Visibility is good in all directions, thanks to a high seating position for the driver and a tall roofline that allows for big windows all around. The standard panoramic moonroof also brings a lot of light into the interior, which was welcome in my tester, given the deep, dark mocha brown leather and poplar wood trim that adorned it.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nBMW’s latest version of iDrive comes standard in the X5, and it continues to improve with each generation. The display screen is now a separate styling element in the dashboard, a sizeable 10.2-inch LCD mounted atop the dash and controlled via a rotary knob on the center console. BMW has new app capability that includes interfaces with a number of mobile-device apps and streaming audio programs. I connected my iPhone5 and used the Glympse app, controlled through the iDrive system, to send a real-time location update to friends who were expecting me as I drove to Kentucky, and the interface worked flawlessly.\n\nI was less thrilled about BMW’s available head-up display on the windshield and the standard rain-sensing wipers. The head-up display projects all manner of information, from navigation to audio data, onto the windshield, but disappears completely when one puts on polarized sunglasses. Being this far into the 21st century, you’d think BMW would have figured out a way to solve that. The rain-sensing wipers didn’t seem to be able to accurately sense when there was sufficient water on the windshield to wipe; I found myself doing it manually more often than not, as the rain-sense function takes the place of a simple intermittent interval.\n\nCargo & Storage\nBeing a midsize SUV on the big end of that category, the X5 should have competitive cargo room, but it doesn’t. While the cargo area is certainly tall and wide, the load floor is very high, making it a chore to load bulky or heavy objects. There’s not as much room in the X5’s cargo area as there is in competitors’ vehicles, either — 22.9 cubic feet of cargo room (66.0 when the rear seats are folded) versus 38.2 cubic feet (80.3 maximum) for the ML350, 36.3 for the Grand Cherokee (68.3) and a whopping 44.5 cubic feet in the LR4 (87.4).\n\nSafety\nWhile the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has not tested the 2014 X5, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave the SUV its top rating of good in its first two tests and called its front-crash protection superior (additional crash tests hadn’t been performed as of publication). See the test results here.\n\nLike most luxury cars, the X5 has a long list of electronic safety features — and like in most BMWs, they cost extra. You get bi-xenon headlights and parking sensors standard, but things like a backup camera, a blind spot monitor, forward collision warning with automatic braking, automatic cruise control and a surround-view camera are optional. You can view all the X5’s safety equipment here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe many versions of the X5 start with the rear-wheel-drive, gasoline six-cylinder sDrive35i at $53,750, including destination charge. My test vehicle was the next level up: an all-wheel-drive, gasoline six-cylinder xDrive35i that started at $56,050, but which quickly climbed to $70,975 thanks to several option packages. Things like the Luxury Line package, which adds 19-inch wheels, a sport steering wheel and satin roof rails, added $1,700. The Cold Weather Package, with its heated steering wheel, heated rear seats and headlight washers added $550, while the Driver Assistance Package tacked on another $1,400 for a backup camera and head-up display. The Driver Assistance Plus Package added a blind spot monitoring system, automatic cruise control and a surround view camera for $1,900. Full LED headlights with automatic high beams cost another $1,900, while a Premium Package with keyless entry, soft-close doors and satellite radio cost an astonishing $2,700. As with most BMWs, the X5 gets you on the options. See for yourself by building one here.\n\nThe X5 has plenty of competitors, but the biggest one may be the Mercedes-Benz ML-Class. The ML350 matches up quite well with the X5 in nearly every way — power, prestige and passenger space. It bests the X5 in cargo capacity and price but falls short in fuel economy, even when comparing diesel models.\n\nThe Jeep Grand Cherokee should be mentioned as well. Even though its starting price is considerably less than that of the X5, a loaded Summit model with all-wheel drive and a V-6 comes within a couple grand of the X5’s starting price and features a competitive luxurious interior, an easier-to-use multimedia system, more cargo space and genuine all-road capability. Nothing in the category, though, can touch the Land Rover LR4 for off-road prowess, and it also features a more powerful V-6 engine than the X5 and much more interior space (thanks to its boxier styling) for less money. It does not, however, offer a diesel or V-8 version. Compare all four competitors here.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nFor 2011, BMW’s all-wheel-drive X5 crossover sports revised styling and more streamlined trim levels. It also adopts the turbocharged six-cylinder and V-8 engines seen in models from the 3 Series to the X6. Both pack more power than last year’s normally aspirated engines. X5 competitors include the Audi Q7, Mercedes-Benz M- and GL-Class and Acura MDX.\n\nThe X5 comes in xDrive35i and xDrive50i trims, both with new engines. The diesel-powered xDrive35d and high-performance X5 M, meanwhile, carry the same drivetrains as last year.\n\n(Skip to details on the: X5 M)\n\nExterior\nBMW says the 2011 X5 has more than 4,000 new parts versus the 2010 model; comparatively few of them, however, adorn the exterior. Styling changes are fairly light: The standard fog lights have been moved inboard, and the grille and tail carry more body-colored elements. Like before, the headlights include BMW’s illuminated rings for daytime running lamps.\n\nChanges to the rear include a reshaped lower bumper and revised tailpipes. Eighteen-inch alloy wheels are standard, with 19-inchers optional. An M Sport Package adds more aggressive bodywork and 20-inch wheels.\n\nInterior\nThe X5’s interior continues mostly unchanged. The dash places a wide screen atop the central air vents, with navigation and other interfaces within. It’s controlled by BMW’s latest-generation iDrive system, whose knob controller now has various shortcut keys surrounding it for easier usage. The automatic transmission continues to employ a console-mounted electronic shifter.\n\nSeating for five is standard; an optional third-row seat raises capacity to seven. Other options include a panoramic moonroof, power-adjustable steering column, USB/iPod connectivity, and heated and ventilated seats.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe xDrive35i uses a new turbocharged six-cylinder that makes 300 hp and 300 pounds-feet of torque — up 40 hp and 75 pounds-feet of torque over last year’s normally aspirated X5 xDrive30i. With a new eight-speed automatic transmission, BMW says 60 mph for the xDrive35i comes in 6.4 seconds.\n\nThat’s how long it took last year’s 350-hp, V-8 xDrive48i to reach the mark. Its replacement, the xDrive50i, has a twin-turbo 4.4-liter V-8 that makes 400 hp and 450 pounds-feet of torque. Fitted with an eight-speed automatic, the xDrive50i can hit 60 mph in just 5.3 seconds, BMW estimates.\n\nBoth models employ a new Brake Energy Regeneration system, so under most conditions, the X5’s battery recharges only during braking or coasting. Overall, the system can save 1 percent to 2 percent on fuel consumption, the automaker says.\n\nThe X5 xDrive35d carries over with the same drivetrain: a twin-turbo diesel six-cylinder with 265 hp and 425 pounds-feet of torque. Sixty mph comes in 6.9 seconds, BMW says; thanks to the higher efficiency of diesel fuel, EPA gas mileage tops the X5 range at 19/26 mpg city/highway. The xDrive35d uses a six-speed automatic.\n\nAll-wheel drive is standard on all models.\n\nSafety\nSafety features include dual front-impact, seat-mounted side-impact and two-row side curtain airbags. Three-row curtain airbags come on models with the optional third-row seat. Antilock brakes, traction control and an electronic stability system are also standard.\n\nX5 M\nBMW’s M performance division souped-up the X5 for 2010, and its drivetrain carries over for 2011 unchanged. It’s powered by a twin-turbo 4.4-liter V-8 that makes 555 hp and 500 pounds-feet of torque and uses a six-speed automatic transmission. Zero-to- 60 mph comes in 4.5 seconds — quicker than many sports cars. As to be expected of a performance offshoot, the X5 M carries unique bumpers, aggressive side sills and highly bolstered sport seats.\n\nFor sharper handling, the X5 M’s all-wheel drive gains BMW’s Dynamic Performance Control system, which apportions extra power to the outside rear wheel during corners. The X6 is the only other BMW to include this system. Back to top",

      "expert_review": "I recently saw a 1967 BMW ad titled “Why is BMW a Man’s Car?” According to the ad, the answer is, “Because it was designed to suit a man’s taste. Fast, lean, tough. No frills, no nonsense. Just a handsome, totally dependable car that gets you there with a minimum of fuss and a maximum of driving pleasure.”\n\nAfter of week of diverging opinions between my husband and me about the 2013 BMW X5 xDrive35i, I’m starting to think the characterization of BMWs as “man’s cars” is true — at least in our family.\n\nThere are very few stereotypical gender roles my family and I subscribe to. (After all, the five of us spent Father’s Day at the nail salon getting pedicures, and my husband left with bright pink toenails with smiley faces painted on them, at the giggly insistence of our three girls.) All the same, my husband was enamored with the X5’s tight driving feel, along with its ability to haul all our kids plus their friends in a pinch (we drove a version with the optional third row). He also loved that we could fold all the seats down and cram in 32 bags of mulch. I, on the other hand, missed some frilly softness.\n\nThe X5 hasn’t changed much since the 2012 model year (see the two model years compared side by side here), but 2013 sees the addition of an optional M Performance Package, with which my test X5 xDrive35i was equipped. The package adds 15 horsepower and 30 pounds-feet of torque to the six-cylinder xDrive35i (for a total of 315 hp), and it means an extra 40 hp and 30 pounds-feet of torque in the xDrive50i (for 440 hp). The package also includes black-chrome exhaust tips and stainless-steel pedals. The X5 has five available trim levels, including a diesel-powered xDrive35d. All-wheel drive is standard. Compare the top four trim levels here.\n\nIf the X5 isn’t a perfect fit for you, you may want to check out other similarly priced seven-seat luxury SUVs, like the Mercedes-Benz M-Class or the Audi Q7. Compare them all here.\n\nEXTERIOR\nFrom the front, the X5 is instantly recognizable as a BMW, with its iconic dual-kidney-shaped grill. At a quick glance from other angles, however, it’s easy to mistake it for something else. When returning to our car after a sushi date, my husband and I first tried to get into someone else’s white Porsche Cayenne, then, realizing our mistake, headed toward a white Acura MDX in the parking lot. We’re not even sake drinkers, people!\n\nFAMILY-FRIENDLY FEATURES\nThe X5 doesn’t appear large enough to have a third row, but somehow it manages to squeeze in an optional one, which makes this SUV flexible enough for families with small children. However, that third row is really quite tiny. If the second row is situated so that second-row passengers have enough legroom, there’s little to no legroom for those in the third row. The third row is also quite close to the floor, so passengers back there should expect to have a great view of their knees and not much else. From the driver’s seat, I couldn’t even see the top of my daughter’s head in the third row, hidden behind the second row’s backrests. Despite this miniscule space (that I wouldn’t try to sit in myself), passengers in the “wayback” have their own controllable air vents and two cupholders.\n\nAccess to the third row is also tight. The second-row seats tilt forward, but only just enough for a small foot in a delicate shoe to pass through. The giant 1970s-esque silver moon boots that my 10-year-old fancies in chilly weather led to some clumsy entrances and exits.\n\nThe second row is much more comfortable. It can be equipped with air vents on the back of the B-pillars as well as the back of the center console for the kids to manage their own climate needs. Sunshades on the windows, a huge panoramic moonroof, in-door storage bins, seatback pockets, available heated seats and two cupholders round out the amenities for second row-ers.\n\nThe driver and passenger’s seats are infinitely adjustable, but the shoulder belts are not height adjustable. Even after raising the seat up into the proper driving position for myself, the belt cut too high on my neckline, causing some irritation. I would expect total comfort in a car of this price, but maybe it’s intentionally lacking those “frills” the early BMW advertisement referred to.\n\nThe liftgate on the X5 has a split design. The power-assisted top portion opens upward at the touch of a button. The small tailgate at the bottom can then be flipped down manually. I found this design to be useful during our annual kids-closet cleanout: It allowed me to stuff bags of clothes to be donated into the smallish cargo space, behind the lip, so they didn’t spill back out again.\n\nThe cargo space in the X5 is pretty tight behind the third row, but both the second and third rows fold flat pretty quickly, and it feels cavernous once they’re down. It just so happened that mulch was on sale the weekend we were driving the X5, and my husband made it his mission to see how many bags he could fit in the X5’s 75.2 cubic feet of cargo space. The grand total was 32. If you need to fit more bags of mulch than that, maybe you should find a new hobby. Or you could purchase the competing Mercedes-Benz M-Class, which has 80.3 cubic feet of maximum cargo space. The Audi Q7 has the least of the bunch, with 72.5 cubic feet.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nBEHIND THE WHEEL\nThe X5 feels exactly like you’d expect a BMW SUV to feel. It’s tight, sporty and peppy, and offers very direct road feedback to the driver. All those factors contributed to my husband’s infatuation with this SUV. The X5’s turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-6-cylinder engine gets an EPA-estimated 16/23/19 mpg city/highway/combined and has more than enough oomph and acceleration fun for those using the X5 as a daily driver.\n\nI, on the other hand, was left searching for a nonexistent comfort mode to take the edge off the ride just a little for my daily driving. I’m really not interested in experiencing every nook, groove and cranny in the cracked pavement every single day on the way to school for drop-off, and then back again for pickup. The X5 over the rough pavement in my neighborhood, coupled with being tossed around in every turn and corner, led to headaches.\n\nThe X5 features an electronic gear selector that you tap up or down to switch from Park, into Drive and back again. I found myself wishing for a tactile thump, or possibly even a beep or other tone confirming that the car had been successfully placed in Park and wouldn’t roll off with me when I took my foot off the brake. Instead, I had to look down at the gearshift or center instrument cluster and visually search for an illuminated P.\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2013 BMW X5 received the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s highest rating of Good in front-, side- and rear-impact crash tests. Unlike most models in this class, it wasn’t subjected to a roof-strength test, which indicates rollover protection. In National Highway Traffic Safety Administration crash tests, the X5 received four stars overall. In individual tests, it scored three stars in a front crash test, five stars in a side-impact crash test and four stars in a rollover-resistance test. Most models in this class score four stars or higher in the frontal test.\n\nAs is required of all new models since the 2012 model year, the X5 has standard antilock brakes, electronic stability control and traction control. It also features the typical six airbags: driver and passenger front and side-impact torso bags, along with side curtain airbags for front and second-row passengers. Note that the X5 is one of only six vehicles with curtain airbags that don’t extend back to protect third-row passengers (see the full report). This seems like an oversight or a cop-out in today’s rapidly evolving vehicle-safety industry, where 10 airbags are often standard (see the report) and third-row occupants are equally considered when it comes to crash protection.\n\nAnother missing safety feature in the X5 was a blind spot monitoring system. These are popping up even on entry-level, sub-$20,000 sedans, so I’d expect one on a vehicle of this price. While I did have a backup camera included as part of the pricey $3,500 Convenience Package on my test car, I wished the display included lines to help give me some more perspective while backing up — a common feature.\n\nThe seat belt buckles in the outboard seats of the second row, where children in booster seats would be likely to sit, are on stable bases, making them easy for young children to operate on their own. The lower Latch anchors are located within the seat bight, but are not too deep, so they’re still accessible. For a detailed report on how child-safety seats work with the X5, view our Car Seat Check of the 2012 BMW X5, whose results carry over for the 2013.\n\nSee all the standard safety features listed here.\n\nX5 IN THE MARKET\nWhile the X5 has a solid base of BMW loyalists who need the space and flexibility that a two- or three-row SUV offers, converting others over to the brand might be a little trickier. The X5 is lacking several of the niceties I have come to expect in this price range, namely, adjustable suspension settings, adjustable shoulder belts, extra airbags (including curtain airbags that extend to the third row, and knee airbags for the driver and front passenger) and a blind spot monitor.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "As a gal who’s always been true to crossovers, I’ve often endured heavy sighs and a tinge of attitude from my husband — Mr. Driving Enthusiast — when I ask that we take my car out and about on the weekends. It’s an area in which we’ve always differed. He wants to drive tiny cars that can zip around town and handle like they’re on a racetrack. I want to ride in comfort while I look above and beyond all the aforementioned tiny cars on the road. The 2012 BMW X5 could be the answer to our split driving personalities.\n\nWith its fantastic family utility and stylish looks, the 2012 BMW X5 offers a driving experience that can’t be matched by another crossover.\n\nBMW brings some stiff competition to the land of SUVs with the X5. As someone who usually glosses over the performance specs on a car’s window sticker, even I couldn’t deny the allure of BMW’s German engineering.\n\nIts precision handling and acute responsiveness quickly spoiled me, and for the first time, I realized what it truly felt like to drive and be one with the road. Even sweeter was that I didn’t have to sacrifice a thing for this experience while hauling my family (and tons of stuff) along with me.\n\nAdmittedly, this fusion of function and fun doesn’t come cheap. The 2012 X5 has a starting MSRP of $47,500. My test car, an X5 xDrive35i Premium trim with BMW’s Convenience Package, cost $67,875.\n\nEXTERIOR\nIt’s only fitting that a crossover with such performance prowess has such a chiseled, athletic figure. Despite its considerable size, the X5 looks fit and trim. Unmistakably a BMW, the X5 has the automaker’s trademark dual-kidney grille, unique-looking taillights and modern styling.\n\nThere’s no strain when loading kids in or out of the child-safety seats; the X5 sits at the perfect height to keep parents from bending down and the ceiling height keeps the kiddos from bonking their heads on the door frame during the process.\n\nMy biggest beef was the optional running boards. They were no help at all and extremely awkward. They aren’t quite wide enough to use as a step into the vehicle, but they’re too wide to bypass on the way out. After almost falling on my face a few times while exiting the X5, I wished I could rip them right off!\n\nHowever, a notable exterior feature that almost made up for the running boards was that in addition to the power liftgate, there was a tailgate that folds down. So, if you’ve got to load something awkward/heavy/large into the back, you can drop the tailgate to assist you and slide it right into the cargo area. It’s also convenient for diaper changes on the fly. It’s the little things!\n\nFuel economy isn’t great for the X5, but this isn’t a car for penny-pinchers at the pump. The turbocharged 3.0-liter six-cylinder engine makes 300 horsepower and has an eight-speed automatic transmission. It gets an EPA-estimated 16/23 mpg city/highway. I averaged 16 mpg during my weeklong test drive, but that probably was due to my enthusiastic driving demeanor. And thanks to that turbocharged engine, you’ll also need to fill up on premium gasoline.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nINTERIOR\nThe X5’s interior lives up to luxury standards; it’s not flashy, but the quality materials used inside and the attention to detail tell you it’s no ordinary vehicle. My test car had upgrades like a panoramic moonroof, heated leather seats, a rear entertainment system and wood trim (instead of fake wood that never fools anyone). It may be fancy, but the five-seater’s interior is durable and ready for anything a family may hurl at it.\n\nA family of four would be most comfortable in the X5, but just in case your brood is a bit larger, the second row can seat three. There’s also an optional third row that ups seating to seven. My test car didn’t have the third row, making the cargo area spacious. On a weekend jaunt to California’s Central Valley, we managed to fit a portable crib, a stroller, overnight bags and all the other random baby gear schlepped around for those “just in case” moments, and there was still room to spare in the cargo area.\n\nThere just aren’t many opportunities for complaints from the family when legroom isn’t skimpy, no passenger is shorted a cupholder, and all the usual storage bins appear in all of the expected places. An unexpected surprise was the sunshades built into the rear passenger windows. No glaring sun in my baby’s eyes means a smoother day of errands for me.\n\nI found the biggest triumph to be the X5’s tech features that functioned smoothly and performed without frustration. BMW’s multimedia system, iDrive, is easy to use, and everything is controlled with a knob in the center stack. While some systems set up this way can be cumbersome and irritating, iDrive works like a charm.\n\nClean, modern displays gave me any information I could possibly need while driving around town, and if I needed more, I could use the BMW Connected application on my smartphone to get the X5’s fuel level, range or even stream my favorite radio station. What really made my jaw drop — not in a good way — was that the app could also stream my Facebook friends’ status updates and Twitter feeds on the X5’s multimedia screen. No matter how strong my social-networking addictions may be, this is not the best or safest example to be setting while the kids are riding along with you. It’s not even a good idea when driving alone.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2012 X5 received four out of five stars in rollover crash tests by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. It hasn’t undergone any of NHTSA’s other crash tests, and it hasn’t been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.\n\nHowever, BMW has safety features that eased my mind while driving with my family in tow. Standard features include all-wheel drive, bi-xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights, all-disc antilock brakes, front and rear parking sensors, an electronic stability system with traction control, antiroll control and six airbags, including side curtains for both rows of seats.\n\nWith a few upgrades, you can also get my new favorite feature: the head-up display, which is part of the Technology Package ($1,700). It projected my speed on the windshield so I never had to take my eyes off the road, and when I was using the navigation system, turn-by-turn directions appeared there as well. Other optional features include a rearview camera with top view, a side-view camera, which proved helpful in tight parking spots and when parallel parking, and adaptive cruise control.\n\nThe only glaring omission was the absence of blind spot warning system. I expected the X5 to have it, especially because other SUVs, with significantly smaller price tags, are now offering the system.\n\nInstalling child-safety seats in the X5 was hassle-free, thanks to the two sets of easy-to-access lower Latch anchors and a roomy backseat.
