      "expert_review": "The verdict: Big, silent, smooth and stylish, the electrified version of BMW’s 7 Series sedan mixes traditional luxury with next-generation tech, and the results are mostly fantastic.\n\nVersus the competition: The i7 is more stylish and luxurious than a Tesla Model S, far more comfortable in every seat than a Mercedes-EQ EQS and likely more available than a Lucid Air.\n\nMy theory — which has been proven out repeatedly as of late — is that there are two schools of thought when it comes to electric-vehicle design. The first is, “Let’s make a normal car and simply replace the gasoline powertrain with a battery-electric one.” South Korean luxury brand Genesis has followed this path with its Electrified G80 sedan and Electrified GV70 SUV. The other is, “Let’s make a spaceship,” which is what Mercedes-Benz has done with its EQ line of vehicles. The EQS and EQE are both wildly styled, crammed with crazy, inscrutable technology and pretty much require a week’s worth of astronaut training to use effectively. A couple automakers, though, have begun to straddle the line between those approaches. One of them is Lucid, whose Air sedan works like a regular luxury car but looks like a spaceship, and the other is BMW.\n\nBMW’s redesigned 7 Series full-size luxury sedan is available in battery-electric i7 form, which is the version I drove, or with traditional internal-combustion power. Apart from their powertrains, the two cars are nearly identical, from their styling and interior appointments to their passenger space and controls. This gives BMW buyers an interesting choice: Go with a conventional powertrain and the 7 Series’ wild new styling, or make the leap to electrification with the i7 and its equally wild new styling. \n\nRelated: BMW Unveils 2024 i7 M70 xDrive, Most Powerful EV BMW Has Ever Produced\n\nAfter spending a week with the new i7 and its electric powertrain, I have to wonder why anyone would bother with a gas version. For the ultimate luxurious motoring experience, electrons are better than hydrocarbons. Let me tell you why.\n\nSilence Is Golden, the i7 Is Silver\n\nThere’s really only one big difference between the gas-powered 7 Series and electric i7, and that’s what’s under the hood. In place of the German gasoline-to-noise converter, BMW gives i7 buyers a choice of three electric powertrains. The i7 eDrive50, which arrives as a 2024 model, is a rear-wheel-drive car with a single electric motor making 449 horsepower and 549 pounds-feet of torque, put to the pavement through a single-speed transmission. It’s good for a manufacturer-estimated 0-60 mph time of 5.3 seconds. From there, you can step up to the all-wheel-drive i7 xDrive60, which gets two electric motors and a total system output of 536 hp and 549 pounds-feet of torque, which BMW says can do 0-60 in 4.5 seconds. If you want to go all out, there’s the 2024 i7 M70, which pumps up power to 650 hp and 749 pounds-feet of torque, with a 0-60 time of just 3.5 seconds. My test vehicle was an AWD xDrive60 in a silver hue. \n\nThe i7 xDrive60 features a 101.7-kilowatt-hour (usable) lithium-ion battery pack good for a driving range around 300 miles, according to EPA estimates. It can be DC fast-charged at up to 195 kilowatts (so don’t put one on a 350-kW charger at an Electrify America station unless you want dirty looks from other EV owners). At home, with a suitable circuit, it can be charged at up to 11 kW on a 240-volt Level 2 setup, which is quite good. \n\nThe remarkable part about the i7’s battery pack is that it’s only 4.3 inches thick, so putting it low in the floor of the 7 Series’ chassis doesn’t noticeably impact interior room, as it does in cars like the Genesis G80, whose battery costs it some headroom. All that weight down low also affects the way the i7 handles, but in a good way — the center of gravity is low and weight distribution is proper, so while the i7 feels seriously heavy (because, at nearly 3 tons, it is), it’s also reasonably nimble and hustles itself through corners quite respectably.\n\nEVs are all about acceleration, and the i7 doesn’t disappoint here, either. This is a massive car, so when it shoots from 0-60 in 4.5 seconds (BMW’s number, but I have no reason to doubt it after driving it myself) in complete silence, it’s an astonishing sensation. The more luxury electric cars I drive, the more I’m convinced this really is the proper powertrain for anything expensive and luxurious: It’s silent, smooth and provides effortless power on demand, all without any intrusive noises or odd vibrations. If you want it to make noise, you can by changing the settings, but I always find artificial, piped-in sounds intrusive. I’d much rather the experience be as quiet as possible, enhancing the feeling of coddled, isolated luxury you’re paying so much money to experience. \n\nWhile body control in the i7 is excellent, changing directions illustrates just how heavy the car is; that battery pack is not dinky. Flogging this car through twisty roads reveals that the i7 prefers to be a touring car, blasting between destinations on highways rather than being tossed around on a two-lane blacktop. It understeers predictably, but given the car’s heft, you’ll probably prefer driving it more sedately than, say, a BMW M5.\n\nA Different Sort of Opulence\n\nThe i7’s luxuriously silent operation does mean the rest of the car has to be even better than before, given there’s no powertrain noise to mask squeaks, rattles, road noise, wind roar, etc. The i7 is up to the task, with a build solidity that’s exceptional. I was surprised to see fabric upholstery in my test car rather than leather or vinyl, but it’s fantastic. It’s a tight, upscale-feeling weave that’s a welcome change from the smooth leathery seats found in almost every other vehicle on the market that isn’t a bare-bones subcompact. The i7’s seating material is the highlight of the interior, though; the rest of it feels a bit cheap in places — like the dash trim, which in my test vehicle was done up in a bland gray. There are illuminated panels on the dash and doors that add a pop of color, but they’re behind some cheap-feeling clear plastic, so it’s a bit of a mixed bag inside in terms of style.\n\nThe enormous rectangular display atop the dash doesn’t really help. Yes, there’s a bright and brilliant touchscreen on the right and reconfigurable gauges on the left, but this trend of plopping a big squared-off tablet atop the dash doesn’t do anything for style, especially when everyone is doing it. It also means that a lot of the i7’s controls are now in the touchscreen, including the ridiculously complicated and hard-to-decipher climate control system. I was hard-pressed to get the thing to do what I wanted it to do half the time, even when stationary — trying to manipulate the climate controls while driving is an exercise in serious distraction. Even figuring out how to work the individual vents took a minute, as they’re also touch-sensitive and not entirely intuitive. There’s such a thing as being so tech-forward that your products are challenging to use, and BMW’s starting to hit that point. It doesn’t need to be this way, as Lucid has very clearly demonstrated, but BMW continues to confuse “technology-packed” with “luxurious.” \n\nThe i7’s controls and some of its materials are my only quibbles with the interior. There’s tons of room in the front and rear seats, which can’t be said of its main competitor, the EQS. That backseat makes the i7 top-notch executive transport, with plenty of legroom and headroom. The EQS’ unusual packaging has neither in abundance. The i7 is close enough to the conventionally powered 7 Series sedan that the benefits of that traditional layout carry over to the electric model, but the EQS is totally different from the Mercedes-Benz S-Class — an effort on Mercedes’ part to separate the two models. Frankly, the BMW strategy seems to pay off more handsomely for consumers; there’s much less of a spaceship feel to the i7, lowering the barrier to entry for customers who don’t want to go through astronaut training to drive an EV.\n\nAstronomical Tech, Astronomical Price\n\nThe starting price for my test vehicle was an eye-watering $120,295, including a surprisingly reasonable (these days, anyway) $995 destination fee. But if there’s one thing German luxury automakers like to do, it’s make everything an option so they can charge you extra for it. This i7 xDrive60 was no exception, with $31,700 in options for a grand as-tested price of $151,995. These options included things like the Executive Package, which brings features like automatic-closing doors, “crystal” headlights, and electronic systems like Active Comfort Drive and Active Roll Stabilization. It also included Rear Executive Lounge Seating, which brings a reclining rear seat with a footrest, as well as a massive 31-inch screen that folds down from the ceiling (entirely blocking the driver’s view out the back window). As much as this car costs, though, my test car really reflects mid-level pricing for the i7; a rear-wheel-drive i7 eDrive50 can be had for $106,695 if you keep your fingers off the options selections, or you can max it out with a fully loaded, two-tone-painted i7 M70 sedan for more than $207,000.\n\nTo be fair, these prices are competitive with other luxury EVs these days, from just about anyone offering them. You’ll easily pay six figures for an Air or EQS, and you can option a Tesla Model S up to that level as well (though with far fewer luxury amenities). For well-heeled buyers in the market for a flagship full-size luxury sedan, BMW’s offering makes it a simple choice of either traditional gas power or next-generation electric. \n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2023 BMW 7 Series Adds Electric Model, Movie Theater Backseat\nWhat’s New With Electric Vehicles for 2023?\nBMW, Mini, Rolls-Royce to Gain Access to Tesla Superchargers\nResearch the 2023 BMW i7\nShop for a 2023 BMW i7\n\nRelated Video: \n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The electric version of BMW’s flagship 7 Series sedan, the i7, was introduced for the 2023 model year in a single configuration, the 536-horsepower, all-wheel-drive i7 xDrive60. For 2024, BMW bookended that variant with a rear-drive entry-level trim and the range-topping M70 xDrive.\n\nFor 2025, BMW is adding standard features to the base eDrive50 and mid-level xDrive60. The former gains a fixed-pane panoramic LED roof, while the latter adds massaging front seats and the Luxury Rear Seating Package, which includes ventilated and massaging rear seats. The 2025 i7 starts at $106,875 (all prices include $1,175 destination charge).\n\nRelated: 2023 BMW i7 Review: Smooth Operator, Tricky Technology\n\nRelease Date and Pricing\n\nThe 2025 BMW i7 is on sale now. Full line pricing is as follows:\n\neDrive50: $106,875\nxDrive60: $125,375\nM70: $169,675\nWhat Are the 2025 BMW i7’s Trim Levels?\n\nAs a more expensive electric version of BMW’s already pricey flagship sedan, the i7 is generously equipped from the jump. The entry-level eDrive50 boasts 19-inch wheels, an adaptive air suspension, rear-wheel steering, adaptive LED headlights, soft-close doors, and keyless entry and start. Leather upholstery is standard, as are heated front and rear seats, heated armrests and door panels, a heated steering wheel, ventilated front seats, four-zone automatic climate control and wireless device charging. Ambient lighting, power-operated rear-window shades and a Bowers & Wilkins surround-sound audio system help set the mood. BMW’s Curved Display joins a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster and 14.9-inch touchscreen that features Apple CarPlay and Android Auto under a single piece of curved glass.\n\nGiven the eDrive50’s long list of standard features, there’s not much to add to the pricier configurations. The xDrive60 gains 20-inch wheels, massaging front and rear seats, and ventilated rear seats. The M70 adds M sport brakes, black exterior trim and Active Comfort Drive with Road Preview, which scans the road ahead with a camera and proactively adjusts the suspension at each individual wheel to isolate occupants from road imperfections.\n\nTwo major packages are available with all three powertrains. The Premium Package includes an illuminated kidney grille, adaptive cruise control with stop and go, lane-centering steering, a 360-degree camera system and Parking Assistant Professional, which can remember and automatically retrace up to 650 feet of a parking maneuver. The Executive Package includes all of that plus massaging front seats (on the eDrive50, where they’re not already standard), crystal headlights and automatic doors.\n\nWithout the Premium or Executive Package, every 2025 i7 can still park itself, it just can’t do so from so far away. Other standard safety and driver-assistance tech includes forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, blind spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, lane departure steering assist, adaptive cruise control, a head-up display, front and rear parking sensors with automatic braking, and automatic high beams.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nIs the 2024 BMW i7 a Good Luxury EV? 5 Pros, 3 Cons\nBMW, Mini, Rolls-Royce to Gain Access to Tesla Superchargers\nWhat to Know Before Purchasing an Electric Vehicle: A Buying Guide\nResearch the BMW i7\nFind Your Next Car\nWhat Are the 2025 BMW i7’s Powertrain Specs and Range?\n\nA single electric motor drives the entry-level eDrive50’s rear wheels with 449 hp and 479 pounds-feet of torque. BMW says that is sufficient to accelerate the 5,635-pound luxury sedan from 0-60 mph in 5.3 seconds.\n\nThe xDrive designation denotes AWD courtesy of two electric motors with one powering each axle. In the xDrive60, those motors produce a combined 536 hp and 549 pounds-feet of torque; while the M70 xDrive enjoys a total of 650 hp and a whopping 749 pounds-feet, enough to catapult it to 60 mph in just 3.5 seconds, a full second ahead of the xDrive60.\n\nAll 2025 i7s draw power from a 105.6-kilowatt-hour battery pack. As is usually the case with electric vehicles, range for each configuration varies with wheel size, as larger wheels tend to be heavier and take more energy to turn. The base eDrive50 is good for up to an EPA-rated 314 miles on a charge, while the xDrive60 sacrifices just 3 miles for a best of 311 miles. The 650-hp M70 is capable of traveling up to 285 miles on a charge.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 BMW i7?\n\nThe electric version of BMW’s 7 Series flagship sedan, the i7 is every bit as luxurious and comfortable as its gasoline-powered counterpart; in fact, apart from their powertrains, the two are virtually identical. With four doors and five seats, the i7 is offered with a choice of three powertrains. The eDrive50 uses a single electric motor with 449 horsepower and rear-wheel drive, while the xDrive60 and the performance-oriented M70 get two electric motors for all-wheel drive; the former has 536 hp and the latter makes 650 hp. All models can be equipped with lavish optional features such as automatic closing doors, a reclining rear seat with footrest, massaging seats and a 31-inch theater-style screen for backseat passengers. The i7’s rivals include the Audi E-Tron GT, Genesis Electrified G80, Mercedes-EQ EQS Sedan, Porsche Taycan and Tesla Model S.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 BMW i7?\n\nThe eDrive50 and the M70 are both new for 2024, respectively slotting below and above the xDrive60 in terms of power and price. The eDrive50’s single-motor powertrain brings the i7’s starting price down by $18,500, while the M70’s extra-muscular powertrain and higher level of standard equipment make it $44,300 more expensive than the xDrive60. Properly equipped, the eDrive50 boasts the i7’s longest EPA-estimated range, at 321 miles. An M70 with 21-inch wheels has the shortest range, at 274 miles. \n\nHow Much Range Does the 2024 BMW i7 Have?\n\nThe i7’s EPA-estimated driving range runs from 274 to 321 miles depending on powertrain and wheel size.\n\nHow Long Does It Take to Charge the 2024 BMW i7?\n\nThe i7’s charging times range from an estimated 10.5 hours on a standard 240-volt Level 2 charger to an estimated 34 minutes on a 350-kilowatt DC fast charger (numbers reflect charging from 10% to 80%).\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 BMW i7 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nRWD\n19-inch wheels\nFour-wheel steering\n12.3-inch digital instrument panel\n14.9-inch infotainment touchscreen \nWireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay \nPremium audio system with 18 speakers\nReal-time traffic and weather info\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nSpeed-sensitive rain-sensing wipers\nHead-up display\nPanoramic sunroof\nPower-folding heated side mirrors\nLeather upholstery\n18-way heated and ventilated power front seats\nRear climate controls\nFour-zone automatic climate control\nAutomatic height-adjustable adaptive suspension\nAutomatic emergency braking with city collision mitigation\nRear collision mitigation\nBlind spot warning\nLane departure warning \nLane departure steering assist\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nAWD\n20- or 21-inch wheels\nPower-reclining rear seat with footrest\nHands-free park-assist system\nAutomatic-closing doors\nRear entertainment system with 31-inch ceiling-mounted screen\nPanoramic sunroof\nActive lane-keeping assistant with side collision avoidance\nAlcantara cabin trim\nHands-free highway driving assist\nAutomatic lane change\nShould I Buy the 2024 BMW i7?\n\nSave its electric powertrain, the i7 is essentially the same vehicle as BMW’s gas-powered 7 Series sedan. This makes it a good choice for electric vehicle shoppers who want a relatively conventional large luxury car instead of the spaceship-like looks and control layouts of some rival EVs, including the Mercedes-EQ EQS and Lucid Air. (That said, the i7 does have some finicky touch-sensitive controls of its own.) The i7 is also more spacious and comfortable inside than its similarly priced competitors.",
