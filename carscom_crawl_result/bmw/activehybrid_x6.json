      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe X6, one of BMW’s recent forays into SUV territory, is a tallish fastback that the company calls a sports activity coupe. With seating for four, it’s basically a midsize SUV with four doors, extroverted styling and a choice of two powerful engines. The X6 competes roughly with the Porsche Cayenne and Mercedes M-Class. BMW’s xDrive all-wheel drive is standard, and the X6 comes in two trim levels: the xDrive35i and xDrive50i. Both models seat four, and the xDrive50i’s V-8 will propel the SUV from zero to 60 mph in just 5.3 seconds.\n\n(Skip to details on the: BMW X6 M, BMW ActiveHybrid X6)\n\nNew for 2011\nA new eight-speed automatic transmission is standard on the 2011 models and replaces a six-speed automatic. The xDrive35i has BMW’s new single-turbo 3.0-liter inline six-cylinder (replacing a twin-turbo). Tapping technology normally found in hybrids, the 2011 X6 gets regenerative braking that charges the battery only when the car is braking, coasting or decelerating. BMW says this improves fuel economy up to 3 percent.\n\nExterior\nIf you took BMW’s Z4, raised it up and lengthened the rear quarters to add two more doors, you would get something of the X6’s profile. The scalloped headlights, twin kidney grilles and stacked tail are classic BMW.\n\nBlack moldings around the grille\nBoth models have a monotone front bumper, which is an upscale departure from the black inlays used on the X3 and X5\n19-inch wheels and run-flat tires\nAvailable 20-inch wheels\n\nInterior\nThe four-seat interior incorporates a shelved dashboard that houses the navigation display without adding an extra hump in the center, as many BMW dashboards do. Metallic rings grace the dual-zone climate controls, and BMW’s iDrive system operates the navigation and entertainment systems.\n\nStitched trimming on the dashboard\nCurvy gear selector finished in galvanized metal\nThree-spoke steering wheel with paddle shifters and radio controls\nStandard power liftgate\nAvailable four-zone climate control with separate settings for each rear passenger\nAvailable power-operated steering column\nAvailable heated front and rear seats\n\nUnder the Hood\nBoth engines incorporate direct fuel injection and turbocharging. The xDrive35i uses a new 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder with one turbocharger, while the xDrive50i uses a 4.4-liter V-8 with two. Power ratings are unchanged on the new six-cylinder, but BMW says it is more efficient. BMW says both engines promise minimal turbo lag and a flat torque curve that begins under 2,000 rpm.\n\n300-horsepower, 3.0-liter six-cylinder with 300 pounds-feet of torque (xDrive35i)\n400-hp, 4.4-liter eight-cylinder with 450 pounds-feet of torque (xDrive50i)\nNew eight-speed automatic transmission\nxDrive’s Dynamic Performance Control doles out power from front to rear and side to side, at least among the rear wheels\nDifferential electronically varies power proactively from a full 50/50 lock to as much as 100 percent going to either wheel to enhance performance and safety\nAdaptive Drive system electronically alters suspension’s stiffness between sport- and comfort-oriented settings to suit different driving conditions\n\nSafety\nThe xDrive50i has upgraded brakes with aluminum calipers. BMW’s Integrated Chassis Management coordinates the Dynamic Performance Control differential with stability and traction control systems to optimize the X6’s stability. Safety features include:\n\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes\nTraction control\nElectronic stability system\nSide-impact airbags for the front seats\nSide curtain airbags for both rows, including a tip sensor that makes them deploy for several seconds during a rollover\n\nBMW X6 M\nThe X6 M steps up from the 400-hp, 4.4-liter V-8 to a twin-turbocharged version making 555 hp. Torque is rated at 500 pounds-feet. BMW says the zero to 60 mph time is 4.5 seconds. A six-speed automatic is the only transmission offered with M-tuned Drive, Sport and Manual modes, the latter of which is activated with the console shifter or aluminum steering-wheel paddles. For 2011, there are no significant changes.\n\nIn addition to revised suspension geometry, bushings and tuning, the M suspension lowers the X6 by almost a half-inch. BMW has also tweaked the stability system and xDrive all-wheel drive to maximize performance, more proactively shifting torque rearward when called for. A display on the instrument panel shows the driver how much power is going to each wheel. The brakes are also beefed up, with larger discs and calipers.\n\nThe X6 M doesn’t hide its special status — especially with its huge air intakes in the front bumper for cooling the brakes, water-cooled turbo intercoolers as well as the engine. The M also features unique 20-inch wheels, front fender vents, quad tailpipes and rear diffuser. The side skirts are also body colored rather than black. Back to top\n\nBMW ActiveHybrid X6\nLike other so-called two-mode hybrids, the ActiveHybrid can accelerate gradually on electric power alone, up to 37 mph in the X6’s case. All-wheel drive and a seven-speed automatic are standard. Because the high-voltage battery pack is under the cargo floor, no hatch volume is sacrificed. But at nearly 5,800 pounds, the X6 ActiveHybrid weighs considerably more than even the X6 xDrive50i. With a combined 480 hp, the car hits 60 mph in 5.4 seconds, BMW says. Combined EPA mileage is 18 mpg — more than the 16-mpg xDrive50i, but short of the 19-mpg xDrive35i. Back to top",

The X6 M steps up from the 400-horsepower, 4.4-liter V-8 to a twin-turbocharged version making 555 hp. Torque is rated at 500 pounds-feet. BMW says the zero to 60 mph time is 4.5 seconds.

Back to top\n\nBMW ActiveHybrid X6\nThe ActiveHybrid X6 is BMW’s first hybrid model resulting from a joint venture with GM and Daimler, owner of Mercedes-Benz. BMW says the system is 20 percent more efficient than a “comparable” gas-only vehicle. Since it makes 480 horsepower from a twin-turbo V-8 and two electric motors, the ActiveHybrid has more power than the non-hybrid X6 xDrive5.0i’s maximum 440 hp, and that brings the combined mileage of 15 mpg up to 18 mpg. It improves slightly upon the V-6 model’s 17 mpg combined. Zero to 60 mph happens in 5.4 seconds, according to BMW.\n\nLike other so-called two-mode hybrids, the ActiveHybrid can accelerate gradually on electric power alone, up to 37 mph in the X6’s case. All-wheel drive is standard, as is a seven-speed automatic with manual-shifting capability. Because the high-voltage battery pack is under the cargo floor, no hatch volume is sacrificed.
