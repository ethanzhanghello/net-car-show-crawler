      "expert_review": "BMW calls it a touring sedan, but to everybody else it’s a station wagon.\n\nNo matter what it’s called, a BMW wagon is an intriguing idea. And if the company’s new 525i Touring is styled like a station wagon, functions like a station wagon, and looks like a station wagon, then there is a better than even chance that BMW owners are going to regard it as a station wagon.\n\n“It is (a station wagon),” said Richard Reinbold, president of Dreyer and Reinbold BMW. “Actually, it’s regarded as a sports wagon.”\n\nThe vehicle isn’t the first model of this type ever made by BMW. The company built an “02” Series wagon in 1971, and later a wagon on the 3 Series. But these were offered only in Europe.\n\nThis late-introduction 1992 525i is a 5 Series wagon, and the first model of this type ever to be exported to the United States.\n\nThe five-passenger unit functions quite handily as a multipurpose vehicle, combining wagon-like attributes with the sports qualities that have been standard fare for BMW automobiles for years.\n\nThe Touring is a takeoff on the 525i sedan, an automobile designed for motorists who drive with a sporting flair. Basically what engineering did was to change to the rear-end segment of the sedan’s four-door shell into a station wagon configuration and incorporate interior componentry having wagon characteristics.\n\nWith the rear seats folded down, the full liftgate rear fifth door gives access to a cargo area’s flat rear floor in a manner that is pure station wagon.\n\nIt all results in an intriguing idea becoming an intriguing vehicle. While the Touring shares the sedan’s basic chassis, power train and exterior dimensions, the wagon’s body has a slightly higher roofline along with built-in rails for a multipurpose roof-rack system.\n\nDoors, windows different\n\nThe door and window shapes are a little different from the sedan. The tailgate has a window that opens separately and a top-mounted spoiler. The power sunroof is the only one of its type available today. And larger taillights wrap around into the body sides.\n\nThe wagon’s coefficient of drag is higher than that of the 525i sedan. But the spoiler contributes to lower coefficients of lift for the front and rear of the vehicle, and this helps provide excellent stability at high speed.\n\nThe dual sunroof consists of two moving panels that serve both the front and rear seats. The front panel slides and tilts, and can slide over the rear panel. The rear panel can slide forward to provide open air to the rear seat. There are four different configurations available with the panels.\n\nThe wagon not only has all the versatility of the standard wagon but also versatile mechanical componentry. It fills out the 5 Series line with a vehicle capable of utility and sports use.\n\n“We never had a wagon before,” Reinbold said, “so it’s hard to gauge just what the market will be like. I believe it will be a supplemental family car for the wife and children. And it may be a primary car for young co uples who want some extra room.\n\nIn market for wagon\n\n“We’re finding people who have had a van in the family for awhile and are getting a little tired of them. They are looking for something that has cargo capacity, but a little more prestige.”\n\nA 525i wagon definitely is prestige, having a $38,600 base price. Options are limited, taking in items like leather, a trip computer and heated front seats. A loaded wagon going out the showroom door probably will cost about $40,000.\n\nOnce out, there’s a lot to make things go. The engine is a double-overhead-cam, four-valves-per-cylinder in-line six, with BMW sticking with its time-honored six cylinders in a row rather than the current trend of many manufacturers offering 24-valve V-6s.\n\nThe German automaker must be doing something right, because the in-line six-cylinder produces 189 horsepower from 152 cubic inches (2.5 liters), and that’s without a turbocharger.\n\nTop speed 128 mph\n\nThe power is such that B MW electronic ally limits the top speed to 128 mph for the American market.\n\n“It may fit into the needs of certain traveling men who want to present a better image,” Reinbold said.\n\nThe 5 Series is BMW’s midsized line of vehicles. The wheelbase is 108.7 inches and the overall length 185.8 inches. At 3,759 pounds curb weight, it is medium heavy, but not enough to encumber performance.\n\nWhile the wagon shares its basic engineering features with other 5 Series models, it has features that adapt it to its specific characteristics.\n\nThe wagon’s four-wheel independent suspension is calibrated to its weight, weight distribution and intended use. For instance, in accounting for almost 200 pounds of additional weight over the 525i sedan, the wagon’s suspension has a weight distribution of 47.5 percent front/52.5 percent rear vs. 50/50 for the sedan.\n\nThe rear suspension also is equipped with a self-leveling system that employs electronic controls and hydraulic pressure to keep the vehicle level regardless of the load carried. And the tires are larger and carry a higher speed rating than those of the sedan. Availability limited\n\nSales will be held down by limited availability. Projections are that the wagon will account for about 10 percent of 525i sales volume.\n\n“The 525i was BMW’s best seller last year,” Reinbold said. “And they just can’t make that many more wagons.”",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nBMW launched a slightly larger fifth-generation 5 Series midsize sedan for 2004. Trunk capacity and backseat space increased. A new weight-saving, all-aluminum front-end structure was used.\n\nThree 5 Series models are available. For 2006, the 525 is equipped with a new 215-horsepower, 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder, and the 530 gets a more powerful 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder. BMW’s V-8-powered 5 Series has a larger, stronger engine and is now known as the 550. Both the 530 and 550 are covered separately in the cars.com Research section.\n\nAn all-wheel-drive 525 joins the traditional rear-wheel-drive version for 2006. All 5 Series models now incorporate an engine start/stop button. Dynamic Stability Control gains brake-fade compensation, brake standby, brake drying and a start-off assist feature. Heated front seats are now available as a stand-alone option.\n\nBMW offers quite an array of optional equipment for the 525, including Active Roll Stabilization, adaptive xenon headlights, run-flat tires, a head-up display and Active Cruise Control. Active Steering is available for rear-wheel-drive 525s. Adaptive brake lights and BMW’s iDrive control system are standard.\n\nExterior\nThe 525’s styling follows on the heels of the company’s controversial 7 Series but is subtler. Short overhangs and what BMW calls “lean-forward dynamics” highlight the design. Standard tires measure 17 inches in diameter.\n\nA prominent twin-kidney grille provides a connection to BMW tradition. The grille is flanked by quad headlights inside luminous rings and beneath clear covers. The turn signals have clear lenses. Amber LED front parking lights are thin and wedge-shaped. The 525 incorporates BMW’s traditional reverse kink at the rear door windows. The contemporary rear end features a high trunk lid. An aluminum suspension is installed.\n\nInterior\nUp to five occupants fit inside the 525 sedan. Leatherette upholstery and Dark Poplar wood trim are standard, but leather upholstery is optional. Both front occupants get a 10-way power seat adjustment with driver memory. Options include 20-way power front seats.\n\nA variable warning segment in the tachometer activates at a lower rpm when the engine is cold. The three-spoke steering wheel holds multifunction controls. Rain-sensing wipers and a 10-speaker CD stereo with twin subwoofers are standard.\n\nFirst installed in the 7 Series, the iDrive control system uses a 6.5-inch display screen. Either the driver or front passenger can operate the system’s control knob atop the center console.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe 525 uses a 215-hp, 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder that develops 185 pounds-feet of torque. A rear-wheel-drive 525 equipped with the standard six-speed-manual gearbox can accelerate from zero to 60 mph in 7.3 seconds, while the six-speed Steptronic automatic requires 7.6 seconds, which is about half a second quicker than the 2005 model. The automatic incorporates Manual and Sport modes.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes, a tire-pressure-monitoring system and Dynamic Stability Control are standard. Side-impact airbags for the front seats and side curtain-type airbags are standard, and rear side-impact airbags and active head restraints for the front seats are optional. Active Roll Stabilization is part of the Sport Package, and this technology yields flatter cornering.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nBMW launched a slightly larger fifth-generation 5 Series midsize sedan for 2004. Trunk capacity and backseat space increased. A new weight-saving, all-aluminum front-end structure was used.\n\nThree 5 Series models are available. The 525 is equipped with a 215-horsepower, 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder, and the 530 gets a more powerful 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder. BMW’s V-8-powered 5 Series is known as the 550. Both the 530 and 550 are covered separately in the Cars.com Research section.\n\nFor 2007, an auxiliary audio input and tire pressure monitoring system are included. New options include HD Radio, which improves FM and AM signal quality, and BMW Night Vision, which uses a thermal-imaging camera to create an image of what’s ahead on the iDrive system’s screen. Real-time traffic information is included in 525s that have a navigation system.\n\nBMW offers quite an array of optional equipment for the 525, including Active Roll Stabilization, adaptive xenon headlights, run-flat tires, a head-up display and Active Cruise Control. Active Steering is available for rear-wheel-drive 525s.\n\nExterior\nShort overhangs and what BMW calls “lean-forward dynamics” highlight the 5 Series’ design. Standard tires measure 17 inches in diameter.\n\nA prominent twin-kidney grille provides a connection to BMW tradition. The grille is flanked by quad headlights inside luminous rings and beneath clear covers. The turn signals have clear lenses. Amber LED front parking lights are thin and wedge-shaped. The 525 incorporates BMW’s traditional reverse kink at the rear door windows and the rear end features a high trunk lid. Adaptive brake lights are standard.\n\nInterior\nUp to five occupants fit inside the 525 sedan. Leatherette upholstery and Dark Poplar wood trim are standard, but leather upholstery is optional. Both front occupants get a 10-way power seat adjustment with driver memory. Options include 20-way power front seats.\n\nA variable warning segment in the tachometer activates at a lower rpm when the engine is cold, and the three-spoke steering wheel holds multifunction controls. Rain-sensing wipers and a 10-speaker CD stereo with twin subwoofers are standard.\n\nFirst installed in the 7 Series, the iDrive control system uses a 6.5-inch display screen. Either the driver or front passenger can operate the system’s control knob atop the center console.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe 525 uses a 215-hp, 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder that develops 185 pounds-feet of torque. A rear-wheel-drive 525 equipped with the standard six-speed manual gearbox can accelerate from zero to 60 mph in 7.3 seconds, while the six-speed Steptronic automatic requires 7.6 seconds. The automatic incorporates Manual and Sport modes.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes, Dynamic Stability Control, side-impact airbags for the front seats, and side curtain airbags are standard. Rear side-impact airbags and active head restraints for the front seats are optional. Active Roll Stabilization is part of the Sport Package, and this technology yields flatter cornering.",

      "expert_review": "If you know the BMW 5-Series, you could almost hear the gasp going out when word spread the Bavarian automaker was looking at making a few tweaks and a few tucks for 2004. Change it? Inconceivable. Make it better? Impossible.\n\nHow do you improve a ride that was named a 10-Best winner by Car and Driver magazine six years running?\n\nYou could almost hear the rumblings from the BMW faithful firing up like a six-cylinder engine.\n\nWhen it comes to ride, handling and performance, it’s no secret the fourth-generation 5-Series has been both the bench and the mark. It has set the standard for luxury sport sedans. It has attracted more and more paying customers every year from 1996 through 2002 – defying convention by achieving even higher U.S. sales in its final calendar year. For seven years it has been the standard.\n\nSo why redesign? BMW says because it “knows how to follow tough acts.” Just make them tougher.\n\nWe’re here to say, the old champ hasn’t lost its crown.\n\nThree new models will be phased in next month, forming the new-generation 2004 5-Series – a roomier car that arrives longer, wider and taller than ever before. BMW says the gains in dimension will result in greater rear-seating space, more comfort and a bigger trunk.\n\nBig news? You don’t know the half of it.\n\nBut just when you thought the 5-Series might get too large around the middle, BMW says it promises to stay fit and trim where it counts. And there it really scores.\n\nReally, it’s all about carrying a good weight. Driving feel, maneuverability and agility have always been core values of the 5-Series and in the new model that theme continues mainly thanks to an all-aluminum front-end and chassis. It means an increase in size as well as advances in comfort and safety with decreases in overall vehicle weight.\n\nBut the largest shift, the biggest news, comes in the form of technology. Are you ready for this? Is the competition?\n\nSeveral items are being pulled directly from the recently redesigned 7-Series, including: iDrive, the central nervous system for the climate, audio and navigation controls that is standard on the 5-Series; Active Roll Stabilization, a traction control system that senses a possible rollover and then prevents it; Active Cruise Control, a brain on board that keeps the 5-Series a safe distance from other cars on the road; and a Harmon Kardon Logic 7 sound system.\n\nBut this isn’t some scaled down 7-Series, BMW’s biggest sedan. But it is enough to make you think you’re riding on the space shuttle.\n\nSeveral advanced technologies make their debut on the 5-Series for 2004, including BMW’s much-anticipated Active Front Steering. The AFS system varies the level of steering input a driver must use in direct relation to the style and speed of driving and road conditions. For example, under normal conditions at low and medium speeds, the steering becomes more dire ct, requiring less effort from the driver (turns of the wheel) and increasing agility in city driving and parking.\n\nIt’s downright remarkable. In tight, twisty turns, your hands never have to adjust on the wheel. In a straight line, it feels rock solid.\n\nOne note: More than once, after slowing down from highway speeds to make a turn, I initially used too much input on the steering wheel. But I think with enough time, that will come.\n\nAnd the technology continues. Additional features that debut on the 2004 5-Series include optional adaptive headlights that rotate to illuminate the road ahead in a turn and adaptive brake lights that will brighten the taillights when the driver applies extra pressure on the brake pedal, giving additional warning to following vehicles that hard braking is taking place. And there’s even an optional fold-down DVD player for rear-seat passengers.\n\nIf all of this has you thinking the new 5-Series is nothing more than a giant computer game, think again. BMW hasn’t forgotten there is still a sport in sport sedan.\n\nThe new Series consists of three models, each powered by its specific engine. The 525i sedan continues with the engine of its predecessor, the responsive and fuel-efficient 2.5-liter, 184 horsepower inline six-cylinder that belies any thought of “entry-level” status; the 530i offers a step-up in six-cylinder power with a 3-liter, 225-horsepower engine and additional standard equipment over the 525i; and the 545i sedan which derives its new model designation from the Vakvetronic engine first introduced in the 7 Series – a 4.4-liter V-8 delivering 325 horsepower, up 35 horses from the previous 540i.\n\nEach model is available with a choice of three transmissions, all six-speeds: manual; Steptronic automatic and a manual Sequential Manual Gearbox (SMG) that allows clutchless shifting.\n\nEach model flies. It is pure BMW guts and grunt with the refinement perfect for an Autobahn – if we had one, which might be the most frustrating thing about the 5.\n\nFrom the outside, design czar Chris Bangle – he of the redesigned 7-Series fame – has added his “flame front” styling, making the 5-Series a more sleek ride from curbside. It is bold. It is daring without losing the 5-Series’ trademark stance. It is gorgeous. Crisp lines flow from the front to the back, making it appear elegant yet sporty.\n\nInside, the upgrade allows for greater rear-seat roominess, expanding the 5-Series into a truly 5-person ride. And have we mentioned the tech stuff enough? There’s an optional multi-colored heads-up display, a wireless communication system than can link the car’s hands-free phone with the customer’s own cellphone. And the air-conditioning monitors the humidity level. The humidity!\n\nOn the negative side, the iDrive central computer is still a work in progress. In the 7-Series, rumor had it many older owners were taking their cars back to the dealer asking for a refund because the system was just too complex. This is easier – the main menu now controls only four categories (navigation, communications, climate control and entertainment) – but it still requires a day to figure out.\n\nAnd the price will probably edge up a bit – $39,995 for the 525i sedan all the way up to $58,295 for the 545i six-speed. That’s serious territory in the high end but, on the whole, BMW’s best-selling sedan is still the benchmark and more. Still the luxury sport sedan it always was. Still the Ultimate Driving Machine.\n\nFear not, 5-Series lovers. Fear not.\n\n2004 BMW 5-Series\n\nRating: 4\n\nHigh gear: With enough technology to launch a rocket, and a rocket of an engine underneath the hood, a good thing gets better.

      "expert_review": "Do you leave your teeth in a glass when you go to bed at night?\n   Then you are a candidate for a station wagon.\n   Do you keep a set of racing gloves next to those choppers on the night  stand?\n   Then make it a BMW station wagon.\n   BMW used to be known as the poor man’s Mercedes. Then BMW started to take  itself seriously and tried becoming Mercedes-only with the emphasis on  performance first, luxury second.\n   But a European performance car is one thing; a European performance car  that can stay out of the ditch in the Snow Belt is another. More than one  rear-wheel-drive Bimmer was spotted treading snow in those ditches during thiswinter’s storms.\n   In June, July or August a Bimmer scoots and scats and weaves in and out of traffic   with the best of them. But when nature flexes its muscles, Bimmers  sometimes are best appreciated parked in the garage with a “Don’t open until  spring” sign on the door.\n   Some argue that rear-wheel-drive cars and snow weren’t made for each          other.Some argue that rear-wheel-drive cars and snow can coexist, but that  rear-wheel-drive cars and thin performance tires such as those on a BMW aren’tgood companions.\n   If you had a nickel for every BMW that acted like a whirling dervish here  in  January and February, you probably could afford to spend those months in  Florida or Phoenix and not give two hoots about the plight of Midwesterners.\n   The sight of performance sedans tiptoeing on the roadway as Civics, Escortsand Saturns blew by     should have served notice to those who have a Bimmer or  long for one that about Nov. 1 it’s time to head to the shop and have a set ofsnow tires put on.\n   We tested a BMW 525i wagon. Rather than calling it a wagon, BMW calls it a Touring, which means even the automaker realizes that “wagon” has a negative  connotation. Not exactly the car we had in mind when BMW called and asked  whether we’d like to take a spin without worrying about taking a spin.\n   The wagon was decked out with AST, or          all-season traction, which means thatwhen the surface gets slick the tires will stick to the road, provided you addsnow tires and remove the Michelin or Pirelli performance tires that come withthe car. Snow, ice, water, gravel. With AST and snow tires you have a fightingchance. Without AST and snow tires you better tiptoe or leave the Bimmer home and take the Grand Cherokee instead.\n   As luck would have it, the minute the snow treads were fastened to the testcar’s wheels, nature took pity and kept the  roads clear of gunk. With  performance tires and clear, open roadways you focus on 0-to-60 m.p.h.  acceleration times, flat cornering and slipping into the passing lane and  burying the pedal each time you run up behind a Mercedes.\n   With snow treads, regardless of the condition of the pavement, you adopt a more conservative attitude. But at least you don’t have to worry about  alternate transportation if the snow starts to fall                                                                            .\n   Hmm. Dry roads, snow tires and a station wagon. This experience with the  Bimmer was a bummer. In fairness, the wagon offered decent ride and handling. The suspension kept just about all harshness from being transmitted from the  road into the     steering wheel or seat cushion. A rather pleasant experience,  considering that the vehicle of chance was one of those whose purpose it is tocarry little kids and their throne with the removable plastic bottom.\n   But we didn’t get to try AST-at least, we didn’t get the chance to  experience it with 6 inches of slop on the highway. But we can’t understand  why anyone, especially someone who lives or passes through the Snow Belt,  would purchase a high-performance rear-wheel-drive car-actually, any       car-without wanting traction control.\n   AST previously was offered only in the top-of-the-line 700- and 800-series BMWs. For 1994 it’s available in all BMWs except the base 318. The system  performs three tasks to keep the whe                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          els from locking and the car from  skidding. It reduces the throttle opening, reduces ignition timing and appliesbrake pressure to the rear wheels.\n   Most of the Bimmers we saw digging ditches during the snowstorms were oldermodels, obviously without  AST and burdened by BMW’s former front-heavy weight distribution. For 1994 the engine is moved farther back in the compartment to distribute the pounds more evenly.\n   The wagon we drove offered the choice of three shift settings for the  automatic     transmission: “automatic,” for economy shifting; “manual,” to enableyou to start in a lower gear, such as when leaving the light when the  intersection is buried in snow; or “sport,” for higher-r.p.m. shifts for  aggressive driving when the roads are dry  and the performance tires are on thewheels.\n   The 525i is powered by a 2.5-liter, 24-valve, dual-overhead-cam,  189-horsepower, six-cylinder engine rated at 18 m.p.g. city/25  highway.\n   The base price is $40,600. The list of standard equipment is long,  including four-wheel anti-lock brakes; dual air bags; power seats; leather  upholstery; air conditioning; foglights; central power locking; and AM/FM  stereo with cassette.\n   The test car added AST at $995; front and rear power sunroofs for     $1,325; aluggage net at $260 (save the money and apply it toward AST if you have to  pinch pennies); heated front seats at $370 (along with the savings from the  cargo net, you just about have AST paid for); and Pirelli snow tires at  $132.50 each, a      hefty price but still much less than paying the bills for a  tow truck and a body shop when you get stuck in a ditch.\n   However, if you have more than $40,000 to spend on a vehicle and purchase astation wagon, you probably are missing more than just a set of teeth.",

      "expert_review": "The question before the house is, can a V-8 lover find happiness with two cylinders gone AWOL? Corollary query: Can a driving enthusiast find happiness with an automatic transmission?  In the case of the BMW 525iA, I was surprised to find the answer   was a resounding yes.  \nSurprised, because I had earlier sampled the transcendant delight afforded by the fire-breathing 540i with 6-speed manual. To be sure, THAT one is lamentably far more car than we can properly exercise in a country with the       world’s best roads, worst drivers and, consequently, rather conservative speed limits. And – reality check – it costs 20 large more than its humble series sibling.  \nThe BMW 5 Series, generically, is the middle car in the Munich manufacturer’s current  U.S. lineup, falling between the 7 and 3 series. In terms of interior volume, it’s labeled a compact by Environmental Protection Agency Ping-Pong-ball counters.  \nFor 2001, the 5s got what the company labels a “discreet” design freshening, with new     grille frames, new front lighting units, revised fog lamps, updated rear lights, which feature LEDs as their light source, monochromatic side treatments and body-color protective strips on front and rear bumpers.  \nThe erstwhile base-level machine,     528i, has been dropped from the lineup, replaced by the 525i on the low end, the 530i upstream. Base price on the 525i, $35,400, is $3,500 less than what was asked for the 528i. This effort to democratize the line entails some sacrifices, of course. The   most obvious is in engine displacement, as reflected so Teutonically in the name. The 2.5-liter inline six has been tweaked, however, so that it makes a mere 9 hp less than its retired big brother.  \nThe climate control was made manual, rather than     automatic (oh, the hardship!), and the passenger’s seat is manual, instead of power-assisted. By way of compensating for this austerity plan, BMW has provided 16-inch alloy wheels instead of the 15-inchers the 528i had.  \nThe engine is such as to       forever banish the stigma of those porcine 525e machines BMW briefly made as an expedient answer to an earlier fuel-price shock. Where those were low-compression, low-revving affronts to what BMW stands for, the new 2.5 seems at its merriest near its      power peak – 6,000 rpm – where it is churning out 184 horses, a BMW-worthy specific output, if not quite so far-out as some. BMW gets there by using a dual intake resonance system and variable valve timing on this all-aluminum powerplant.  \nThe torque  peak – 175 foot-pounds – is achieved at a more workaday 3,500 rpm, and its curve is sufficiently flat to make it a relatively content partner to the automatic transmission I experienced.  \nThe 325iA weighs 3,505 pounds. Just looking at the numbers      cited, one might conclude that performance would be on the languid side. But without any heroic efforts, I found the machine could leap from a standing start to 60 mph in 8 seconds flat. Hardly awesome, but adequate for the ”                               entry-level” platform.  The manual-shifted version should take that down into the low 7s, which is considered fairly zippy.  \n BMW has evidently sacrificed a little fuel economy to achieve a better seat-of-the-pants experience for its customers who,    saddled with low top speeds, focus on blastoff brio.  \nIn the manual machine, fifth gear is not even an overdrive cog. It’s a straight-through, 1:1 ratio, backed by a final drive ratio of 3.15:1. The 5-speed automatic has a 0.75:1 ratio in fifth,       working through a stouter 3.46:1 rear end.  \nA more conservative approach might have squeezed an extra mile or two per gallon out of the EPA test cycle, at the expense of making the car seem a slug. As it is, the EPA numbers are 19 mpg city, 27         highway. I logged an overall score of 20.7, not wasting the car’s corner-munching prowess on much freeway time. With its compression ratio of 10.5:1, the engine expects 91-octane fuel.  \nWorking through traffic, I kept the engine humming around                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         0 rpm, and was consistently gratified by the strength and immediacy of the response. The Steptronic shifter (licensed from Porsche) allowed manual gear selection when the spirit moved, although it was quite competent doing its own thing.  \nOn the       whole, in a variety of driving circumstances, the available power seemed sufficient, despite my nostalgia for the wretched excess of the 282-hp, 324-foot-pound 4.4-liter V-8 that comes in the 540 model.  \nHandling was average BMW fare, which is to say  better than almost any production car in the world. BMW clings resolutely to the rear-drive configuration, which has inherently better handling because it separates the chores of steering and propelling. Even the low-end 5 series cars have both traction   control and stability control. I’ve found in winter tests that BMW’s traction control makes its cars at least the equal of front-drive machines. Not only does the car perform superbly, it makes the driver feel like part of the loop, an active participant. \nThe seats are firm and supportive, with good lumbar support. The steering wheel tilts through a short arc and also telescopes for a good fit.  \nThe tested car had the “sport” suspension, which involves tougher springs and shocks, as well as beefier anti-roll bars. The bulking-up notwithstanding, it still delivered an extremely livable ride, especially over nasty pavement, where lesser lights might feel overwhelmed. The 111-inch wheelbase kept pitching to a minimum, and an impressively low (0.30)     drag coefficient kept the cabin quiet at legal speeds and beyond.  \nThe optional wide-profile tires, which sometimes can degrade ride, seemed in this case merely to enhance grip, as they’re supposed to.  \nInstruments were but the usual four, though  well-placed and paragons of visibility. I suppose oil pressure and temperature gauges are superfluous on a modern car, but on one as intense as this would nonetheless be appreciated.  \nYou won’t want to stop in this car, but you might have to, so it’s  fitted with potent 11.7-inch ventilated discs front and rear. Pedal feel is superb, and the antilock was quiet and competent. Stopping distances from 70 were impressively short.  \nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has not crash-tested  a 5-series. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has. In IIHS’s demanding 40-mph offset barrier collision, the 5 earned a top mark in every category of occupant protection, and was deemed a “best pick” in its class, which IIHS curiously defines as   “large luxury.” One might reasonably infer five-star ratings on the government’s frontal crash, too. The 5 series has dual-stage front air bags and door-mounted side air bags for the front seat occupants.  \nThe standard stereo is a powerful 10-speaker  job, with an AM-FM-cassette front end. It’s prewired for a single-CD player or a remote 6-disc unit. A 12-speaker unit with two subwoofers is available. Sound quality on the supplied unit was very good,                                                      and the 4-channel FM antenna “diversity” system provided enough signal to avoid dropouts and distortion even in fringe areas.  \nOne point to ponder: in addition to the sedan, there’s a sport wagon variant for just $1,800 more that adds a soupçon of     practicality.  \nBase price on the 525i is $35,400. The tester had a mere sampling from the smorgasbord of available options: the Steptronic transmission, $1,275; in-dash single-CD player, $200; and the sport package (17-inch specific and very handsome  alloy wheels, 235/45 performance tires and sport suspension), $1,500. Total cost, with freight, was $38,945. \n\n“Gannett News Service”",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle OverviewIts been said that designers are at work on the next generation of BMWs midlevel sedan and wagon, but the launch of those models is a couple years down the line. For 2002, the Sport Premium and Convenience option packages are gone, and an in-dash CD player is newly standard. The 5 Series fits between BMWs smaller 3 Series and its flagship 7 Series sedan.\nThe 5 Series appearance was freshened for 2001. Base models equipped with a 2.5-liter inline-six-cylinder engine are called 525i, while those fitted with a larger 3.0-liter inline-six are designated 530i. The 4.4-liter V-8 that powers the 540i sedan and wagon was given a boost this year to 290 horsepower. All 5 Series models are rear-drive, have side-impact airbags for the front seats and come with a curtain-type Head Protection System. Side-impact airbags for the rear seats are optional.\nThe high-performance M5 sedan, which is fitted with a 394-hp, 5.0-liter V-8 engine and a six-speed-manual gearbox, also is available. Other 5 Series models may be equipped with either a manual or automatic transmission.\nExterior With a 111.4-inch wheelbase, the 5 Series fits into the full-size category by cars.com standards, though some observers consider it a midsize model. At 188 inches long overall, the 5 Series is slightly shorter than the Mercedes-Benz E-Class sedan and nearly 9 inches shorter than the Lexus LS 430. In appearance, the 5 Series closely resembles its smaller and larger mates, all of which sport BMWs familiar twin-kidney grille.\nInterior Seating is provided for five occupants. Front bucket seats have 10-way power adjustment for the driver. Standard equipment on all models includes remote keyless entry, a 10-speaker audio system, a power tilt/telescoping steering column, heated power mirrors and an alarm. The 540i sedan adds such extras as a moonroof, dual-mode automatic air conditioning and xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights.\nLeather upholstery is standard in the 540i and optional in the 525i and 530i, which otherwise come with standard imitation-leather seating. All models can be equipped with an optional split, folding rear seatback and BMWs navigation system.\nUnder the Hood The 525i uses a 184-hp, 2.5-liter inline-six-cylinder engine, while a 225-hp, 3.0-liter inline-six goes into the 530i. Topping the regular lineup, the 540i gets a 4.4-liter V-8 that now produces 290 hp  8 hp more than last years engine. Six-cylinder models are available with either a five-speed-automatic or five-speed-manual transmission. The 540i comes with a five-speed-automatic or six-speed-manual transmission.\nThe 540i actually costs more when fitted with a manual shift than with the automatic, but stick-shift versions come with a Sport Package that includes 17-inch tires and a tauter suspension. All 5 Series models are rear-drive only, unlike the smaller 3 Series, which offers all-wheel drive as an option.\nSafety Dual-stage front airbags deploy according to crash severity and whether occupants are buckled up. Side-impact airbags for the front seats and BMWs Head Protection System  which consists of curtain-type airbags that deploy to protect front-seat occupants  are standard. Side-impact airbags and head-protection curtains are optional for the rear seats. Standard safety features include antilock brakes, traction control and an electronic stability system that BMW calls Dynamic Stability Control. The optional Park Distance Control detects obstacles to the front and rear of the car while parking it.\nDriving Impressions BMW manages to mix big doses of both sport and luxury in the 5 Series models. Drivers can expect the precise maneuverability and control of a 3 Series, coupled with quite a few luxuries near the level of the big 7 Series. Although suspensions are undeniably firm, especially if the sedan is fitted with a Sport Package, ride comfort remains pleasant over most pavement surfaces.\nPerformance is reasonably energetic even with the smallest six-cylinder engine, but the V-8 unleashes a veritable torrent of strength for supremely confident highway operation. BMW appears to strive for symmetry in each of its models, so the dashboard and its easy-to-read gauges look about the same, regardless of the size of the sedan. \n \n\n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com;From the cars.com 2002 Buying Guide;Posted on 11/28/01",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nBMWs midlevel rear-wheel-drive (RWD) 525 sedan and wagon, which fit between the smaller 3 Series models and the flagship 7 Series cars, get several modifications for the 2003 model year. A moonroof is now standard on the base-model 525i, which holds a 2.5-liter inline-six-cylinder engine. BMWs Head Protection System for rear passengers has been added, and the available navigation system switches to DVD-based operation.\n\nA rain sensor is now included with the optional Premium Package. The German automaker also offers a 530i sedan with a larger six-cylinder engine, as well as a 540i sedan with V-8 power and a high-performance M5 sedan.\n\nBMWs midlevel six-cylinder 525 sport wagon competes primarily against other European-brand luxury wagons from Audi, Mercedes-Benz, Saab and Volvo. The German automaker also offers a 540 wagon with V-8 power but no equivalent to the 530i sedan. Unlike BMWs 325xi wagon, which has the option of all-wheel drive, the 5 Series is rear-wheel drive only.\n\nA moonroof is now standard on the base-model 525i wagon, which holds a 2.5-liter inline-six-cylinder engine. BMWs Head Protection System for the rear passengers has been added, and the available navigation system switches to DVD-based operation. Rain-sensing wipers are now included with the optional Premium Package.\n\nExterior\nRiding a 111.4-inch wheelbase, the 525i falls into the compact category according to interior-volume standards by the Environmental Protection Agency, but cars.com considers it a midsize model. At 188 inches long overall, the 525i is a little shorter than the Lexus GS 300. In appearance, the 5 Series sedans closely resemble their smaller and larger counterparts, all of which sport BMWs familiar twin-kidney grille.\n\nFrom the front doors forward, the wagons styling is identical to BMWs 5 Series sedans. Its overall appearance also resembles the smaller 3 Series and larger 7 Series, including the familiar twin-kidney grille. Even though the 525i is often considered a midsize model, it falls into the compact category according to interior-volume standards by the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nFog lights and cross-spoke 16-inch wheels are standard. Xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights are optional. A Sport Package for the 525i wagon includes a sport suspension, sport-style seats and 17-inch tires on star-spoke wheels.\n\nInterior\nSeating for five occupants is standard on all 5 series models. The front bucket seats have 10-way power adjustment for the driver. Standard equipment on all models includes remote keyless entry, a 10-speaker audio system with a CD player, a power tilt/telescoping steering column, heated power mirrors and an alarm. Leather upholstery is optional. Sedans can be equipped with an optional split, folding rear seatback.\n\nThe wagons include a split, folding rear seat and a retractable rear cargo cover. The powered front bucket seats have a 10-way adjustment, and they feature standard leatherette upholstery; leather is offered as an option. The 525 wagon also includes dual-zone automatic air conditioning, heated power mirrors with a memory feature, a CD stereo, a power tilt/telescoping steering column, an alarm, and a central locking system that can lock the doors and close the windows via remote control.\n\nCargo volume behind the rear seat totals 32.7 cubic feet, but folding the backseat increases space to 65.2 cubic feet. BMWs navigation system is optional, and Sport and Premium option groups are offered.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe 525i uses a 184-horsepower, 2.5-liter inline-six-cylinder engine, which teams with either a five-speed-automatic or five-speed-manual transmission. All 5 Series models are RWD only, unlike the smaller 3 Series, which offers all-wheel drive as an option.\n\nThe automatic gearbox in the 525i wagon incorporates a Steptronic mode that permits manually selected gear changes by tipping the shift lever fore and aft.\n\nSafety\nDual-stage front airbags deploy according to crash severity and whether occupants are buckled up. Side-impact airbags for the front seats and BMWs Head Protection System  which consists of curtain-type airbags that deploy to protect front-seat occupants  are standard on all series models. Side-impact airbags are optional for the rear seats. Safety features include antilock brakes, traction control and BMWs electronic stability system, called Dynamic Stability Control. The optional Park Distance Control detects obstacles to the front and rear of the car while parking.\n\nDriving Impressions\nBMW mixes big doses of both sport and luxury in all 5 Series models, starting with the 525i. Drivers can expect the precise maneuverability and control of a smaller 3 Series sedan, coupled with quite a few luxuries. The suspensions are undeniably firm, but ride comfort remains pleasant over most pavement surfaces.\n\nPerformance is reasonably energetic even with the 2.5-liter inline-six. BMW appears to strive for symmetry in each of its models, so the dashboard and its easy-to-read gauges look about the same, regardless of the size of the sedan. The ride and handling qualities differ little between the 5 Series sedans and wagons. Even with its inline-six-cylinder engine, the 525i wagons performance is reasonably energetic.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2003 Buying Guide\nPosted on 12/18/02",
