      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 BMW X3?\n\nThe BMW X3 is a five-seat compact luxury SUV that’s offered with a range of engine choices: The sDrive30i and xDrive30i are powered by a 248-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder, while the M40i gets a 382-hp, turbo 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder with a 48-volt mild-hybrid system. The high-performance X3 M, meanwhile, boasts track-focused features and has a turbo 3.0-liter inline-six that makes 473 hp (X3 M) or 503 hp (X3 M Competition). The sDrive30i is rear-wheel drive, but all other versions come standard with all-wheel drive. All X3s have an eight-speed automatic transmission, and competitors include the Volvo XC60, Mercedes-Benz GLC-Class and Audi Q5.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 BMW X3?\n\nThe X3 was refreshed for 2022 and sees no notable changes this year.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 BMW X3 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nForward collision warning\nLow-speed automatic emergency braking\nNavigation with 10.25-inch touchscreen\nTri-zone automatic climate control\nPower liftgate\nKeyless entry system\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nPanoramic moonroof\nWireless device charging\nHarman Kardon surround-sound system\n360-degree camera system\nAdaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability\n12.3-inch digital instrument panel\n12.3-inch touchscreen display\nM Sport Package\nShould I Buy the 2024 BMW X3?\n\nThe BMW X3 offers a sporty yet composed ride, good passenger space and an impressive lineup of refined engines. It’s a better value than many BMWs, though adding items from the long list of tempting available features drives up the price. Cargo room could be better, and some rivals offer posher interiors, but the X3 is a fine competitor in its class.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2022 BMW X3 M Competition is a competent performance vehicle that has a hard time cutting loose.\n\nVersus the competition: The X3 M Competition SUV isn’t as fun as some of its competitors, including the Alfa Romeo Stelvio Quadrifoglio and a whole host of performance cars, plus it lacks the utility and sheer brute force of larger performance SUVs.\n\nBMW’s X3 is a popular compact luxury SUV, and the M and M Competition variants that appeared for the 2020 model year offer shoppers most of the performance of an M3 sedan with the added utility of an SUV. That said, utility isn’t too high on BMW’s list of priorities; it insists on calling the X3 a “Sports Activity Vehicle.”\n\nFor 2022, the 503-horsepower X3 M Competition gets 479 pounds-feet of torque, up from 442 pounds-feet in the 2021 model. It also gets a larger grille design and more aggressive exterior styling, plus additional standard tech features.\n\nRelated: ​​IIHS: 2022-23 BMW 5 Series, X3 Upgraded to Top Safety Pick Plus\n\nThere are quite a few performance SUVs on the market these days, but few fit in the luxury compact SUV class: In addition to the X3 M, there’s the aforementioned Alfa, while the Mercedes-AMG GLC63 likely won’t reappear until sometime after the 2023 GLC arrives in dealerships. The Audi SQ5 isn’t as outright bonkers as the other European performance SUVs, and other entries are larger — sometimes much larger, like the Dodge Durango SRT 392 and SRT Hellcat or the Cadillac Escalade V.\n\nBMW has no plans to bring the M3 Touring wagon to the U.S. any time soon, so if you’re looking for a BMW that can haul ass and a fair amount of cargo, the X3 M — or the more hardcore M Competition — are your best options. Are they worth it?\n\nDrives a Conversation\n\nThe X3 M Competition is impressively quick; BMW estimates its 0-60 mph time at 3.7 seconds. Power comes on in a rush, with an eager-to-downshift eight-speed automatic transmission that seamlessly finds the ideal gear for aggressive acceleration without ticking through the gears in between. The exhaust note has a healthy, menacing burble, with appropriate crackling and popping on downshifts. (For drivers who prefer a more refined auditory experience, the exhaust is adaptive and can be quieter.)\n\nRide quality is also impressive even with the Competition’s 21-inch wheels and more aggressive settings dialed into the standard adaptive suspension. The X3 M Competition I drove was unbothered by road imperfections and always felt poised to tackle the next corner. There was also next to no body roll, which is both impressive and a little off-putting in an SUV; something as big and tall as this, with a higher seating position, feels like it should be tipping and pitching a bit around corners.\n\nThe rest of the BMW’s driving experience is more frustrating. The brakes are great in situations requiring aggressive stops, but the pedal is sensitive and the (necessarily) powerful brakes have a lot of bite, which can make smooth daily driving difficult. The steering in this BMW also left a lot to be desired, with a numbness that might be fine in a regular SUV but isn’t when “M Competition” appears in the name. This has been a common refrain in our reviews of recent BMWs, and while they can feel better in truly aggressive driving — like on an autocross course — those moments are best left to closed courses.\n\nConfigurability has been a central part of M cars for a while now, and that continues in the X3 M Competition. There are two bright red M buttons on the steering wheel for preset drive modes, another M Mode button on the center console and a button for the adaptive exhaust. There’s also a setup button that pulls up a menu in which you can further pick and choose your preferred powertrain, steering, suspension and all-wheel-drive settings — the latter with a mode that provides a pronounced and enjoyable rear-wheel-drive bias. It was almost too much configurability at first, but over time, I found combinations that worked for my preferences.\n\nUnfortunately, the entire experience feels more buttoned up and conservative than a 503-hp SUV with staggered-width wheels and tires has any right to be. It’s missing the unhinged playfulness of the Alfa Romeo Stelvio Quadrifoglio and its giant four-leaf clover badging and colossal shift paddles, not to mention the Alfa’s more communicative steering and handling chops. There are things the BMW does much better than that SUV, like technology and build quality, but from a pure driving perspective, I’d choose the Alfa every time.\n\nThe X3 M Competition is still one of the most capable SUVs you can buy, but if you start considering non-SUVs, its capabilities diminish — especially if performance driving is your focus. With so many high-performance cars available in the $70,000-$90,000 range — including BMW’s own M3 and M4 – choosing an X3 M Competition for purely performance reasons feels like a mistake.\n\nYet the X3 M Competition doesn’t offer enough utility to make up for the fact that it doesn’t reach those higher echelons of performance; besides the cargo area, there’s not much there. It doesn’t come with a tow hitch or tow mode, and BMW doesn’t even list a maximum towing capacity. The Dodge Durango SRT 392 and Hellcat may not be as nimble as the BMW, but both can tow up to 8,700 pounds when they’re not hauling ass.\n\nOne last mark against the X3 M Competition is its fuel economy. While it’s not surprising that a high-performance vehicle is inefficient — and the X3 M Competition is, with an EPA-estimated 15/20/17 mpg city/highway/combined — it’s shocking that the SUV’s estimated driving range on a full tank of gas is just 292 miles.\n\nAdequate Interior\n\nBuilt as a performance car, the X3 M Competition doesn’t have a plush interior, but it’s comfortable and well put together. The Competition Package adds front sport seats that are heavily bolstered but still comfortable, and while the backseat doesn’t get sport seats, it does have space and comfort to spare — along with climate controls, charging ports and available heated outboard seats. It’s roomy enough to have earned a respectable grade in our Car Seat Check, and interior touches like carbon-fiber trim and seat belts with M-inspired color stitching add to the sportiness.\n\nTechnology is also a strong suit, with standard wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity. (Wireless device charging is a stand-alone option that my test vehicle did not include.) The large 12.3-inch touchscreen is clear and easy to use in spite of a deep menu structure. The standard digital instrument panel also measures 12.3 inches and includes an M-specific mode that heightens the SUV’s sense of aggression by streamlining the information on display and adding red accents. Some of that information also carries over to the optional head-up display.\n\nEven better is the fact that despite the SUV’s tech-heavy interior, there are still ample physical climate and audio controls that are easy to use. These controls are especially welcome because the touchscreen can be hard to reach from the driver’s seat, and BMW’s optional gesture controls don’t always work (and trying to make them work while driving is distracting).\n\nThe interior layout will be familiar to BMW enthusiasts, but that familiarity is beginning to edge toward datedness. The X3 M Competition’s biggest interior weakness is that it doesn’t have the materials quality to match its price — $87,345 as tested (including destination). A comparable 2023 model will likely be over $90,000. To be blunt, it doesn’t feel like the M Competition interior is all that different from a pedestrian X3, which starts around $47,000 for 2023. Plastic abounds, mostly in the lower reaches of the interior. There’s an embossed “X” logo on the front doors that feels like an Easter egg, and I’m a sucker for those, but it also looks like it would be more at home on a Subaru than a BMW.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2023 BMW 840i Gran Coupe: What We Think of BMW’s Flagship ‘Coupe’\n2022 BMW i4 M50 Gran Coupe Review: Electric Rocket Ship\n2022 J.D. Power Tech Experience Index: Hyundai Dominates, Overall Satisfaction Dwindles\nBMW: New Subscription Fees for Heated Seats Won’t Impact U.S.\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2022 BMW X3 M?\nIs the X3 M Competition Right for You?\n\nThe appeal of a performance vehicle is not just what you actually do with it, but what it can do. The X3 M Competition gives owners those bragging rights while providing a comfortable ride, lovely sounding exhaust and utility you can’t find in a coupe with similar performance stats.\n\nWhile this vehicle makes sense in those terms, buyers looking for a true performance vehicle, or even a true performance SUV, might want to look elsewhere — especially if track driving is on the menu.\n\nBMW doesn’t let the X3 M Competition go for cheap. As mentioned, our test vehicle’s as-tested price was $87,345, but its starting price was just under $71,000. Options included the Competition Package ($7,000), Executive Package ($2,450), M Driver’s Package ($2,500) and $4,500 for matte-finish Frozen Marina Bay Blue Metallic paint. Prices have gone up since then, with the 2023 X3 M starting at over $75,000 before options.\n\nSome of the features in that optional Executive Package (heated steering wheel, heated outboard rear seats, head-up display) are standard on other luxury vehicles in this price range, and our pricey test vehicle didn’t have the optional Driving Assistance Professional Package ($1,700 on a 2023 model), which adds BMW’s low-speed Extended Traffic Jam Assistant and additional safety tech.\n\nThe Competition Package turns up the heat on the X3 M, but at $7,000, it might be pricier than what it delivers: additional horsepower and torque, unique wheels, sport exhaust and sport seats. The M Driver’s Package unlocks a higher top speed — 177 mph instead of 155 mph — and a day of track instruction. Those are the main selling points of these two packages, but buyers won’t have an autobahn where they can safely access all that power and speed — and even if they did, this SUV isn’t the best choice for a track day.\n\nAll of those options on our test car added more than $15,000 to its sticker price, and they aren’t all necessary if you’re happy with the level of enjoyment you can get out of the base X3 M — or an even cheaper X3 M40i. With the X3 M Competition, what you’re mostly paying for is bragging rights. If that’s what you want, so be it.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 BMW X3?\n\nThe BMW X3 is a five-seat luxury compact SUV that’s offered with a range of engine choices: The sDrive30i and xDrive30i are powered by a 248-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder, while the M40i gets a 382-hp, turbo 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder with a 48-volt mild-hybrid system. The high-performance X3 M, meanwhile, boasts track-focused features and has a turbo 3.0-liter inline-six that makes 473 hp (X3 M) or 503 hp (X3 M Competition). The sDrive30i is rear-wheel drive, but all of the others come standard with all-wheel drive. All X3s have an eight-speed automatic transmission, and competitors include the Audi Q5, Mercedes-Benz GLC and Volvo XC60.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 BMW X3?\n\nAfter a refresh for 2022, the X3 sees only minor changes to feature availability this year. \n\nWhat Features in the 2023 BMW X3 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nForward collision warning \nLow-speed automatic emergency braking\nNavigation with 10.25-inch touchscreen\nTri-zone automatic climate control\nPower liftgate\nKeyless entry system \n\nAvailable features include:\n\nHeated and ventilated front seats \nHeated steering wheel\nPanoramic moonroof\nWireless device charging\nHarman Kardon surround-sound system\n360-degree camera system \nAdaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability\n12.3-inch digital instrument panel\n12.3-inch touchscreen display \nM Sport Package \nShould I Buy the 2023 BMW X3?\n\nThe BMW X3 offers a sporty-yet-composed ride, good passenger space and an impressive lineup of refined engines. It’s a better value than many BMWs, though adding items from the long list of tempting available features drives up the price. Cargo room could be better and some rivals offer posher interiors, but the X3 is still a fine competitor in its class.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2021 BMW X3?\n\nThe BMW X3 is a five-seat compact luxury SUV. It’s offered with rear- or all-wheel drive, and power comes from a standard 248-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine. Available powertrains are a 288-hp plug-in hybrid; 382-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six; and 473-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six for the X3 M. All X3s have an eight-speed automatic transmission, and competitors include the Audi Q5, Mercedes-Benz GLC-Class and Volvo XC60.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2021 BMW X3?\n\nAndroid Auto smartphone connectivity joins Apple CarPlay, and satellite radio is also now standard. Newly standard active safety features include blind spot warning and lane departure warning. \n\nWhat Features in the 2021 BMW X3 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nForward collision warning \nLow-speed automatic emergency braking\nNavigation with a 10.25-inch touchscreen\nTri-zone automatic climate control\nPower liftgate\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nHeated and ventilated front seats \nHeated steering wheel\nPanoramic moonroof\nWireless device charging\nHarman Kardon surround-sound system\n360-degree camera system \nAdaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability\nShould I Buy the 2021 BMW X3?\n\nThe BMW X3 rides well and has a refined base four-cylinder engine, but it suffers from numb steering and modest cargo room. If you’re considering an X3, we’d recommend taking a look at BMW’s less expensive X1, too. It’s nearly as nice and has a roomy interior.",

      "expert_review": "There once was a time when BMW’s M performance variants graced only a few models, but those days are gone. The latest vehicles to get the M treatment are the X3 and X4 SUVs, whose new M variants — not to be confused with the next-rung-down M40i trim levels — can dispatch 60 mph in as little as 4 seconds flat.\n\nRelated: 2019 BMW X4 Quick Spin: Hot or Not\n\nThat’s if you get the Competition editions, of which the twin-turbo, inline-six-cylinder engines crank out 503 horsepower and 442 pounds-feet of torque apiece. Sans Competition grade, the X3 M and X4 M have the same engine with identical torque but 30 hp less, and it’s good for a 4.1-second sprint to 60 mph — still significantly quicker than the M40i versions of the X3 and X4 (355 hp, 4.6 seconds to 60 mph) but a few ticks slower than the rival Mercedes-AMG GLC 63 and Alfa Romeo Stelvio Quadrifoglio (as low as 3.7 seconds for the Benz and 3.6 seconds for the Alfa).\n\nHorsepower for both models peaks all the way up to 7,200 rpm, and Competition models sustain peak torque to nearly 6,000 rpm, versus 5,600 rpm for the standard M engines. Power reaches the wheels through an eight-speed automatic transmission, which has a gear selector with buttons to toggle between three shift strategies that alter how soon and fast the shifts occur. Standard all-wheel drive sends most power to the rear wheels to maximize balance, while a dual-exhaust system with electronic flaps — continuously variable in the Competition grades — spews its contents out four tailpipes, versus the two in M40i grades.\n\nSelectable driving modes vary myriad characteristics, with a row of buttons on the center console that allow you to mix and match how the steering effort, exhaust note and suspension behave. An M Dynamic mode sends even more power to the rear wheels through a variably locking rear differential.\n\nNaturally, drivetrain enhancements aren’t the only difference. M models have additional front-end bracing, including a strut brace under the hood that bridges the shock towers for increased chassis stiffness. Adaptive shock absorbers are standard, and BMW claims all manner of other unique suspension components for the M SUVs, from bearings and control arms to stabilizer bars and rear bracing. Starting in August, the automaker will offer the shock-tower brace in carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic — the same material used extensively in the i8 supercar — as an option.\n\nTwenty-inch wheels wear P255/45ZR20 tires up front and wider, P265/45ZR20 rubber in back. Competition grades have 21-inch wheels and lower-profile tires, albeit with the same width. Both sets frame enormous, cross-drilled disc brakes: 15.6 inches up front and 14.6 inches in back, or nearly 2 inches larger up front than the X3 M40i’s disks.\n\nVersus the M40i trims, the X3 M and X4 M have rejiggered front bumpers with taller, six-sided center openings flanked by more-tapered side portals. The tails have more body coloring on the lower bumpers versus the M40i SUVs, plus unique liftgate spoilers. The side mirrors sport BMW’s signature M design, each with an extra arm up top. As with the shock-tower brace, BMW will offer certain exterior elements in carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic as an option beginning in August.\n\nInside, the gauges, steering wheel and gear selector have unique M treatments, while the optional head-up display can show a rev indicator with shift lights. The sport seats have M logos, while unique seats with illuminated logos are standard if you get the Competition grades.\n\nIf you’re itching to buy one, expect sales to begin in late spring. Production of the M variants begins in April 2019, and a BMW spokesman told Cars.com that sales usually commence around two months after that.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
