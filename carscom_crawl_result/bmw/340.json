      "expert_review": "The BMW 3 Series is luxury sports sedan royalty. It’s the first car I think of when considering this class, and for good reason — it was the best for a good stretch of time. The BMW ran away from the luxury sports sedan field and won our 2013 Challenge in a landslide. That was the first Challenge that I participated in for Cars.com, and after driving each of the competitors, it was clear that the BMW was the class of the field. It accelerated harder, drove better and felt more refined.\n\nRelated: 2020 BMW M340i: Can BMW Lift the Crown Once Again?\n\nBut the crown has fallen on hard times of late. When we did the Luxury Sports Sedan Challenge again in 2017, the BMW 330i slipped all the way to sixth place. This was due in some part to a curious set of winter tires and strange options, but to me the bigger issue was that a new crop of contenders like the Alfa Romeo Giulia and Cadillac ATS had leapfrogged it — especially when it came to driving acumen.\n\nNot winning a Challenge is one thing, but losing a Challenge and not being one of the three cars selected to be a part of our “fun to drive” rankings? Double ouch. And that Challenge occurred before my favorite current entrant in the class arrived and took home our Best of 2019 award: the Genesis G70.\n\nIn an effort to reclaim its place, BMW has redesigned the 3 Series for 2019, which marks the introduction of the G20 generation (the previous generation was dubbed the F30). It has a better interior, new technology and safety features, and (of course) new styling. Going through all of that will take some more time with the car, but I arrived in Palm Springs, Calif., with a simpler question in mind: Does the 3 Series get its mojo back?\n\nI tested two versions of the new 3 Series, a 2019 330i and a 2020 M340i xDrive, in two very different environments — the 330i on the street, and the M340i on the track. (Per our ethics policy, Cars.com pays for its own lodging and transportation at such automaker-sponsored events.)\n\nTrack Impressions: Plenty of Go\n\nThe M340i is a new 3 Series family member. A 340i was offered last year, but the addition of the letter “M” to the car is significant. The M340i goes up a level when it comes to performance, and it starts under the hood with a 382-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder that makes 369 pounds-feet of torque. Those represent gains of 62 hp and 39 pounds-feet of torque compared with 2018’s 340i and a lowering of the zero-to-60-mph time from 4.8 to 4.2 seconds.\n\nAs a part of the redesign, the 3 Series dropped its manual transmission option, which leaves an eight-speed automatic as the only transmission. It’s sad to lose another manual, but in our recent testing, our staff did not have kind words for the manual and I’m here to tell you the automatic is quite good. On the track, I left it to its own devices and it held gears and downshifted when I wanted it to without prompting, two things automatics usually have trouble with.\n\nThe M340i I tested also came with all-wheel drive (that’s the xDrive part of the name), but it operates with a clear rear-wheel-drive bias. BMW says that the system prioritizes sending power to the rear wheels, and it feels that way on the track. Only when you’re trying to put down some extra power on corner exit do you really feel the AWD help to pull the car out of the corner and sling it toward the next one with added impetus.\n\nDriving on the track, the powertrain was the star of the show. The M340i has an earnest eagerness to its acceleration; power pours on quickly and carries through the long straightaways without letting up. It was also predictable, without any sudden spikes that could upset the car — if you’re precise with your foot, the engine’s output will match it.\n\nThe goodness of the powertrain doesn’t quite carry through to the rest of the driving experience. The notable issue I had was with the steering, which echoed a complaint that we had with the last generation of the 3 Series rears its head again here (as it did in the BMW Z4 I also evaluated recently). I found the M340i to have good balance on track, and the one I tested came with the optional adaptive suspension, which does a good job of limiting body roll and keeping the car neutral. But the steering is missing feedback, with a hint of vagueness that creeps up more noticeably the harder that you drive. It’s in those moments that I needed a bit more communication from the car, and the lack of response made me back off at times where I probably could have pushed the car further but couldn’t feel where the edge was.\n\nThe numerous powertrain and suspension updates to the new M340i make it a more capable car than the older 340i, without question. It’s really only the steering that holds the car back.\n\nStreet Impressions: Day-to-Day Fun\n2019 BMW 330i | Cars.com photos by Brian Wong\n\nNext, I drove a 330i on the street. The new-generation 330i also sees a power gain, its turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder making 255 hp and 295 pounds-feet of torque, which are increases of 7 hp and 37 pounds-feet of torque, respectively. It’s also mated to an eight-speed automatic and is offered with AWD, though I tested a RWD model that revealed some differences.\n\nMuch like the M340i, the powertrain is impressive. It, too, has a wide power band, with maximum torque opening up from 1,550 to 4,400 rpm. That makes the engine similarly responsive, just with less kick than the M340i — but I found that it’s still plenty. It has the same transmission, which is just as well-sorted for street driving as it is for track duty; on a curvy mountain road, bump the 330i into Sport mode and the transmission gladly holds gears through the turn to slingshot you out the other side.\n\nMy test vehicle started with a base price of $41,245 (including destination charges) but piled on the options until the sticker climbed all the way to $59,970 — more than the M340i’s base price of $54,995. Included in those options, however, were a slew of performance upgrades that are standard on the M340i, such as an M Sport suspension, M Sport brakes, M Sport differential and variable sport steering. This brought the two cars closer together in terms of their ride and handling than I thought they would be, and the 330i has much of the M340i’s great balance even without the adaptive suspension.\n\nI did find one way in which the 330i performed better than the M340i did: It has quicker turn-in. This could be due to suspension differences absent the AWD of my M340i. The 330i has a propensity to dive-bomb the nose of the car into corners, which gave it a bit of an Alfa Romeo Giulia flair in those initial moments. I think the car is still missing some steering feedback, but the vagueness isn’t quite as pronounced as it was in the M340i; I’d surmise that also has to do with the front wheels being unencumbered by drive hardware.\n\nThe 330i also rode quite well for a car on a non-adaptive sport suspension. It’s composed at highway speeds, and road imperfections on some beat-up backroads were felt but didn’t punish me. Also worth highlighting (on both vehicles) is the ease with which you can find an ideal driving position. The steering wheel has a lot of both tilting and telescoping travel, so I could set my feet in the right place and easily maneuver the steering wheel to match.\n\nAlmost There\n\nI found this to be a solid return to form for the 3 Series. The powertrains of both cars are a highlight, and they drive appreciably better than their counterparts in the F30 generation. Are the improvements enough for the 3 Series to reclaim its perch atop the class? From this much exposure, I’m not convinced it’s not quite there — the steering issues hold it back from taking that spot among competitors, but my goodness, those engines are fantastic.\n\nIt was striking to me that I preferred the 330i’s steering and, consequently, its driving experience slightly more than the M340i. It may not have the same raw acceleration, but I would take that more connected feeling over the M340i’s slightly robotic athleticism in most cases. To resolve this fully, it will probably take some time in a RWD version of the M340i (sans adaptive suspension) to get a truer comparison of the two. Track driving also exposes more of a car’s flaws than does a street drive, and I’m not sure how the 330i would have held up under the harsher light or if the M340i would look better after a jaunt on the streets. We’ll have to find that out soon enough.\n\nThe 2019 330i will hit dealerships in March, with the 2020 M340i to follow in the summer.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in October 2016 for the new 2016 BMW 340. Nothing has changed for 2017, but to see a side-by-side comparison of the two model years, click here. The 2017 BMW 3 Series did receive a Top Safety Pick Plus rating from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, an improvement over 2016.\n\nFor years now, BMW has billed its products as Ultimate Driving Machines, using that phase as an advertising tagline and claiming a sportier orientation than what’s found in rivals like Mercedes-Benz, Audi and Lexus. The backbone of that claim has always been the BMW 3 Series sedan; it’s the company’s best-selling model globally and heavily influences the rest of BMW’s lineup. For 2016, the company updated the 3 Series, giving it a barely perceptible face-lift and dropping a new engine into the six-cylinder 340i. (Compare the 2015 335i with the 2016 340i here). The new motor is more powerful (on paper) and joins some suspension refinements to create, says BMW, a new driving experience. I spent a week with a new 340i to see if the once-king of sports sedans still has its mojo.\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nThe 3 Series looks as it has for the past 20 years: Certain elements have been kept through successive generations even as the car has grown longer and wider. The same familiar twin-kidney grille is up front, flanked by sleek headlights. BMW’s traditional character line runs up the body sides, and the 340i ends in a high tail. The style is immediately identifiable as a 3 Series, and it’s very attractive. \n\nYou can specify if you’d rather have a sportier or more luxurious look for your 340i with either chrome or blacked-out trim. My test car didn’t have much in the way of optional Sport Package bling, but its bright Melbourne Red metallic paint and dark wheels definitely set it apart from more traditional silver or beige pigments.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nPowering the new 340i is a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder engine making a stout 320 horsepower. Those horses are sent to the rear wheels via either a standard eight-speed automatic transmission or a no-cost six-speed manual — one of the few left on the market. BMW’s xDrive all-wheel drive is optional for an extra cost, but I didn’t drive it; my test car was a rear-driver with the six-speed manual transmission. \n\nWhile they may not be hugely popular options anymore, manual transmissions are still prized by enthusiasts as one of the last true connections between man and machine — though whether or not that’s really true anymore, given how good automatics have gotten, is up for debate. \n\nThe six fires to life with a low burble, and it’s clear from the get-go that the sound the engine is making is being piped into the cabin — you can hear the noise when you’re inside the cabin, but not if a 340i drives past you on the street. That’s becoming more common as automakers improve noise isolation in cars and employ turbochargers that muffle exhaust sounds. As long as the electronic augmentation is representative of the engine’s actual sounds, I don’t mind it. \n\nAcceleration from the powerful engine is surprisingly tepid unless you switch the adjustable mode selector into Sport mode (your other options are Sport+, Eco and Normal). Blame lazy electronic throttle tuning for the car’s quick but uninspiring acceleration in Normal, because in Sport mode, the 340i’s reflexes and responses get much more entertaining. This is what the normal 340i would have felt like a couple of generations ago; this new one has been tuned to be much softer and more mainstream than previous BMW sports sedans. As such, it feels less different from the Mercedes-Benz C-Class than it used to — and considerably less taut and sporty than a Cadillac ATS 3.6. I drove the 340i to a launch drive of the new 2017 Ford Fusion Sport and came away more impressed by the sportiness of the Ford when driven back-to-back with the Bimmer.\n\nSteering response is heavy and somewhat numb on-center, and Sport mode doesn’t seem to do much to change that. The brakes are strong but require more travel than one might expect, with an initial softness that saps confidence during spirited driving. Both these attributes were surprising to me given my test car was equipped with a $1,700 Track Handling Package that introduces variable sport steering and upgraded M Sport brakes. The shifter isn’t anything special, either, operating no more precisely or requiring any greater effort than the one in the latest Honda Civic, nor offering any better feedback. \n\nRide quality has been made a noticeable priority in the 340i. When it’s left in Normal mode, the shock absorbers do an admirable job of keeping things smooth and comfortable. Sport mode merely makes the ride choppier, not any sportier. For a supposed sports sedan, the 340i doesn’t deliver any more sporting an experience than a Mercedes-Benz C-Class or Audi A4, and it feels less engaging than a Cadillac ATS. It feels as if it’s been dumbed down from its formerly sharp performance in an effort to give it greater appeal to compact-luxury-sedan buyers, and that’s a shame.\n\nFuel economy is average for the category, rated by the EPA at 20/29/23 mpg city/highway/combined equipped with rear-wheel drive and the six-speed manual. Thanks in part to two extra gears, the 340i with the eight-speed auto box is rated 22/32/25 mpg. My week of testing netted about 21 mpg overall in mostly suburban driving — and with an admittedly heavy foot. Competitors aren’t any better: The Audi S4 is rated a miserable 17/26/20 mpg with its manual but features AWD standard, the automatic-only Mercedes-Benz C450 AMG comes in at 21/28/24 mpg, and the automatic Cadillac ATS 3.6 manages to rate 20/29/24 mpg on regular gas instead of premium like the others.\n\nInterior\n\nInside, the BMW 340i is the typical mix of materials BMW is known for. As is common in the class, leather is not standard, but my test car included it as an option. \n\nIt’s narrow inside the 340, with a wide center console and lower door trim that intrudes into the driver’s legroom in order to feature a bottleholder. Materials quality is mostly good, a mix of nice soft-touch materials with some cheap-feeling hard plastic. The dark ash wood trim almost disappeared into my car’s black interior. Overall, the look is less luxurious than the Benz or Audi but decidedly higher quality than the Cadillac.\n\nFinding a comfortable seating position is also something of a challenge. Despite the front seats’ multi-adjustability, the pedals are a long way from the driver’s seat and the steering wheel doesn’t telescope in far enough for shorter drivers to fully engage the clutch pedal without being uncomfortably close to the steering wheel. This isn’t an issue with the automatic car, but it’s the situation in which I found myself in the 340i. Playing around with the seat cushion angle helped. \n\nThe backseat is a little tight in the legroom department, but that’s not uncommon in this vehicle class, and the BMW doesn’t seem any worse than its competitors here.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nIf you keep checking option boxes, you can load your 340i up with all sorts of fun electronic goodies, as my test car was. From a rather complete head-up information display to the latest remote concierge services and BMW’s iDrive multimedia system, the 340i can be very well-equipped with all the latest gadgetry. Interestingly, it’s display is not a touchscreen; it operates from a rotary controller in the center console that takes a little getting used to before you can successfully navigate the menu-based system. The upside is that you’re never trying to reach for the display while driving and there are no smudgy fingerprints on it.\n\nCargo & Storage\n\nFor a compact sedan, the 340i has a surprisingly spacious trunk, with 13.0 cubic feet overall. That’s more than its rivals possess, with the Mercedes-Benz C430 AMG coming in at 12.6 cubic feet and the Audi S4 not far behind at 12.4. The Cadillac ATS is closer in size to previous-generation 3 Series models at just 10.4 cubic feet. All these cars feature a split, folding rear seatback to allow for expansion of the trunk for larger items.\n\nSafety\n\nThe BMW 340i earned five stars across the board in National Highway Traffic Safety Administration crash tests, but it didn’t fare quite as well with the IIHS. It’s rated good (out of possible ratings of good, acceptable, fair and poor) in most tests, but is ranked marginal in the small overlap front test and headlight illumination rating. See how its competitors rate in the institute’s Midsize luxury cars class.\n\nAs with most German luxury cars, plenty of high-tech safety equipment is available for an extra cost, driving the price of a 340i even higher. The only systems of note that come standard on the 340i are adaptive brake lights and front side-impact airbags. Everything else, from a backup camera and parking sensors to autonomous braking and blind spot detection, costs extra. \n\nA model equipped with forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking earned a rating of advanced from IIHS — ranking between the scores of basic and superior — for its emergency stopping performance. See all the BMW 340i’s standard and optional equipment here.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nYou can get a less-expensive 3 Series — the 328i with a 2.0-liter, turbocharged four-cylinder engine — or you can get a much more expensive performance model in the M3. The 340i splits the difference between those two, starting at $46,795 including destination for a six-cylinder model. All-wheel drive is an extra $2,000. \n\nThe car I drove was loaded with options, including BMW’s Driver Assistance and Driver Assistance Plus packages, plus the Cold Weather Package, Lighting Package, Technology Package and Track Handling Package. Manual rear side window shades and enhanced Bluetooth were also included, as was a $550 metallic paint and $1,450 leather interior, to bring the grand total to an uncomfortable $58,420. If you keep going and add an M Sport appearance package and automatic parking, you’ll end up spending more than $60,000 for a compact luxury sedan.\n\nCompetitors at this level tend to be the mid-range performance models of other German luxury automakers. The Mercedes-Benz C450 AMG is a little more expensive to start, at $51,725, but comes with standard AWD. Like the BMW, leather is not standard, and opting for it requires adding packages that boost the price just as quickly as the 340i’s sticker can inflate. \n\nThe Audi S4 is a little different. It also comes with standard AWD but on front-drive architecture. It starts a little higher than the BMW, at $50,125. But just like the C450 AMG, its specs are well-matched against the BMW and it comes with more standard sport equipment (real leather is still optional, however).\n\nThe Cadillac ATS has a powerful V-6 and an available Sport Package model, and while its interior isn’t quite up to snuff versus its German rivals, its chassis dynamics and performance are easily competitive with, if not superior to, the BMW. It’s something of a bargain, too, starting at $42,335 for a rear-wheel-drive 3.6 Luxury model that features leather seats, front and rear parking sensors, a sport suspension and Brembo brakes standard.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Despite being billed as an Ultimate Driving Machine, the latest BMW 340i feels dumbed down to widen its appeal to buyers of rival machines.\n\nVersus the competition: The BMW 340i is certainly powerful and offers lots of customization abilities, but it no longer has a lock on being the sportiest luxury sports sedan in the class. Several other brands offer sharper-performing cars with similar price tags.\n\nFor years now, BMW has billed its products as Ultimate Driving Machines, using that phase as an advertising tagline and claiming a sportier orientation than what’s found in rivals like Mercedes-Benz, Audi and Lexus. The backbone of that claim has always been the BMW 3 Series sedan; it’s the company’s best-selling model globally and heavily influences the rest of BMW’s lineup. For 2016, the company updated the 3 Series, giving it a barely perceptible face-lift and dropping a new engine into the six-cylinder 340i. (Compare the 2015 335i with the 2016 340i here). The new motor is more powerful (on paper) and joins some suspension refinements to create, says BMW, a new driving experience. I spent a week with a new 340i to see if the once-king of sports sedans still has its mojo.\nExterior & Styling\nThe 3 Series looks as it has for the past 20 years: Certain elements have been kept through successive generations even as the car has grown longer and wider. The same familiar twin-kidney grille is up front, flanked by sleek headlights. BMW’s traditional character line runs up the body sides, and the 340i ends in a high tail. The style is immediately identifiable as a 3 Series, and it’s very attractive.\n\nYou can specify if you’d rather have a sportier or more luxurious look for your 340i with either chrome or blacked-out trim. My test car didn’t have much in the way of optional Sport Package bling, but its bright Melbourne Red metallic paint and dark wheels definitely set it apart from more traditional silver or beige pigments.\nHow It Drives\nPowering the new 340i is a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder engine making a stout 320 horsepower. Those horses are sent to the rear wheels via either a standard eight-speed automatic transmission or a no-cost six-speed manual — one of the few left on the market. BMW’s xDrive all-wheel drive is optional for an extra cost, but I didn’t drive it; my test car was a rear-driver with the six-speed manual transmission.\n\nWhile they may not be hugely popular options anymore, manual transmissions are still prized by enthusiasts as one of the last true connections between man and machine — though whether or not that’s really true anymore, given how good automatics have gotten, is up for debate.\n\nThe six fires to life with a low burble, and it’s clear from the get-go that the sound the engine is making is being piped into the cabin — you can hear the noise when you’re inside the cabin, but not if a 340i drives past you on the street. That’s becoming more common as automakers improve noise isolation in cars and employ turbochargers that muffle exhaust sounds. As long as the electronic augmentation is representative of the engine’s actual sounds, I don’t mind it.\n\nAcceleration from the powerful engine is surprisingly tepid unless you switch the adjustable mode selector into Sport mode (your other options are Sport+, Eco and Normal). Blame lazy electronic throttle tuning for the car’s quick but uninspiring acceleration in Normal, because in Sport mode, the 340i’s reflexes and responses get much more entertaining. This is what the normal 340i would have felt like a couple of generations ago; this new one has been tuned to be much softer and more mainstream than previous BMW sports sedans. As such, it feels less different from the Mercedes-Benz C-Class than it used to — and considerably less taut and sporty than a Cadillac ATS 3.6. I drove the 340i to a launch drive of the new 2017 Ford Fusion Sport and came away more impressed by the sportiness of the Ford when driven back-to-back with the Bimmer.\n\nSteering response is heavy and somewhat numb on-center, and Sport mode doesn’t seem to do much to change that. The brakes are strong but require more travel than one might expect, with an initial softness that saps confidence during spirited driving. Both these attributes were surprising to me given my test car was equipped with a $1,700 Track Handling Package that introduces variable sport steering and upgraded M Sport package brakes. The shifter isn’t anything special, either, operating no more precisely or requiring any greater effort than the one in the latest Honda Civic, nor offering any better feedback.\n\nRide quality has been made a noticeable priority in the 340i. When it’s left in Normal mode, the shock absorbers do an admirable job of keeping things smooth and comfortable. Sport mode merely makes the ride choppier, not any sportier. For a supposed sports sedan, the 340i doesn’t deliver any more sporting an experience than a Mercedes-Benz C-Class or Audi A4, and it feels less engaging than a Cadillac ATS. It feels as if it’s been dumbed down from its formerly sharp performance in an effort to give it greater appeal to compact-luxury-sedan buyers, and that’s a shame.\n\nFuel economy is average for the category, rated by the EPA at 20/29/23 mpg city/highway/combined equipped with rear-wheel drive and the six-speed manual. Thanks in part to two extra gears, the 340i with the eight-speed auto box is rated 22/32/25 mpg. My week of testing netted about 21 mpg overall in mostly suburban driving — and with an admittedly heavy foot. Competitors aren’t any better: The Audi S4 is rated a miserable 17/26/20 mpg with its manual but features AWD standard, the automatic-only Mercedes-Benz C450 AMG comes in at 21/28/24 mpg, and the automatic Cadillac ATS 3.6 manages to rate 20/29/24 mpg on regular gas instead of premium like the others.\nInterior\nInside, the BMW 340i is the typical mix of materials the BMW 3 Series is known for. As is common in the class, leather is not standard, but my test car included it as an option.\n\nIt’s narrow inside the 340, with a wide center console and lower door trim that intrudes into the driver’s legroom in order to feature a bottleholder. Materials quality is mostly good, a mix of nice soft-touch materials with some cheap-feeling hard plastic. The dark ash wood trim almost disappeared into my car’s black interior. Overall, the look is less luxurious than the Benz or Audi but decidedly higher quality than the Cadillac.\n\nFinding a comfortable seating position is also something of a challenge. Despite the front seats’ multi-adjustability, the pedals are a long way from the driver’s seat and the steering wheel doesn’t telescope in far enough for shorter drivers to fully engage the clutch pedal without being uncomfortably close to the steering wheel. This isn’t an issue with the automatic car, but it’s the situation in which I found myself in the 340i. Playing around with the seat cushion angle helped.\n\nThe backseat is a little tight in the legroom department, but that’s not uncommon in this vehicle class, and the BMW doesn’t seem any worse than its competitors here.\nErgonomics & Electronics\nIf you keep checking option boxes, you can load your BMW 3 Series 340i up with all sorts of fun electronic goodies, as my test car was. From a rather complete head-up information display to the latest remote concierge services and BMW’s iDrive infotainment system, the 340i can be very well-equipped with all the latest gadgetry. Interestingly, it’s display is not a touchscreen; it operates from a rotary controller in the center console that takes a little getting used to before you can successfully navigate the menu-based system. The upside is that you’re never trying to reach for the display while driving and there are no smudgy fingerprints on it.\nCargo & Storage\nFor a compact sedan, the 340i has a surprisingly spacious trunk, with 13.0 cubic feet overall. That’s more than its rivals possess, with the Mercedes-Benz C430 AMG coming in at 12.6 cubic feet and the Audi S4 not far behind at 12.4. The Cadillac ATS is closer in size to previous-generation 3 Series models at just 10.4 cubic feet. All these cars feature a split, folding rear seatback to allow for expansion of the trunk for larger items.\nSafety\nThe BMW 340i earned five stars across the board in National Highway Traffic Safety Administration crash tests, but it didn’t fare quite as well with the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. It’s rated good (out of possible ratings of good, acceptable, fair and poor) in most tests, but is ranked marginal in the small overlap front test and headlight illumination rating. See how its competitors rate in the institute’s Midsize luxury cars class.\n\nAs with most German luxury cars, plenty of high-tech safety equipment is available for an extra cost, driving the price of a 340i even higher. The only systems of note that come standard on the 340i are adaptive brake lights and front side-impact airbags. Everything else, from a backup camera and parking sensors to autonomous braking and blind spot detection, costs extra.\n\nA model equipped with forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking earned a rating of advanced from IIHS — ranking between the scores of basic and superior — for its emergency stopping performance. See all the BMW 340i’s standard and optional equipment here.\nValue in Its Class\nYou can get a less-expensive 3 Series — the 328i with a 2.0-liter, turbocharged four-cylinder engine — or you can get a much more expensive performance model in the M3. The 340i splits the difference between those two, starting at $46,795 including destination for a six-cylinder model. All-wheel drive is an extra $2,000.\n\nThe car I drove was loaded with options, including BMW’s Driver Assistance and Driver Assistance Plus packages, plus the Cold Weather Package, Lighting Package, Technology Package and Track Handling Package. Manual rear side window shades and enhanced Bluetooth were also included, as was a $550 metallic paint and $1,450 leather interior, to bring the grand total to an uncomfortable $58,420. If you keep going and add an M Sport appearance package and automatic parking, you’ll end up spending more than $60,000 for a compact luxury sedan.\n\nCompetitors at this level tend to be the mid-range performance models of other German luxury automakers. The Mercedes-Benz C450 AMG is a little more expensive to start, at $51,725, but comes with standard AWD. Like the BMW, leather is not standard, and opting for it requires adding packages that boost the price just as quickly as the 340i’s sticker can inflate.\n\nThe Audi S4 is a little different. It also comes with standard AWD but on front-drive architecture. It starts a little higher than the BMW, at $50,125. But just like the C450 AMG, its specs are well-matched against the BMW and it comes with more standard sport equipment (real leather is still optional, however).\n\nThe Cadillac ATS has a powerful V-6 and an available Sport Package model, and while its interior isn’t quite up to snuff versus its German rivals, its chassis dynamics and performance are easily competitive with, if not superior to, this entry-level BMW. It’s something of a bargain, too, starting at $42,335 for a rear-wheel-drive 3.6 Luxury model that features leather seats, front and rear parking sensors, a sport suspension and Brembo brakes standard. Compare all four here.\n\nemail",
