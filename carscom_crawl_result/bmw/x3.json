      "expert_review": "Everyone has a favorite.\n\nIn the car world, I break down many of mine — yes, there is more than one — by segment. Among trucks, midsize sedans, sporty coupes, there are vehicles that I just like more than others. Some are not always the best value and some might surprise you.\n\nIn the compact SUV group, I like the BMW X3 3.0si with xDrive most of all.\n\nAt least I thought I did, based on past experiences with this snazzy SUV. With its plush interior and its prim-and-proper road manners, what’s not to like? But a lot of compact SUVs have hit the market since I last drove the X3 and I wasn’t sure it would still top my list.\n\nSo, naturally, when BMW asked me to test drive the 2008 X3, I grabbed the keys and headed out to “run some errands.”\n\nYep, it hasn’t changed: I love this little all-wheel drive piece of German engineering.\n\nIt’s a 3 Series sedan with more cargo space and a higher riding position.\n\nThe long nose, the distinctive grille and the lit ring around the headlights give away its pedigree. The dual kidney grille and a big ‘ol air intake under the bumper add to its powerful look. Yes, this compact SUV was made for me.\n\nZipping along I-75, I could barely hear the harsh world outside. Construction plagues the interstate near my home but the BMW just gobbled up all of those uneven concrete pieces and melded them into a minor bump in the road. It’s a quiet ride perched behind the driver’s seat of this vehicle.\n\nNothing is overstated and that’s one of the reasons I like X3 so much. The leather seats feel like sport seats — well bolstered and comfortable. The wood trim looks like it came off some impeccably maintained Victorian piece of furniture. The simple white-on-black gauges are pure BMW.\n\nThe second row offers plenty of space for adults, but I wouldn’t try to cram three in the back for a long trip. Really, this compact luxury SUV is the perfect runabout for a family that has lots of little trips to soccer practice, instrument lessons and Friday date nights. It’s a multi-purpose kind of vehicle with true utility.\n\nFold the backseats and there’s more than 70 cubic feet of space. That’s enough space to pack things to fill a dorm room — which any smart college student would tell his parents.\n\nBut keep this fun runner at home. It can bring home the bacon so the maid can fry it up in a pan.\n\nThere are some excellent details that I enjoy as well, such as the door handles that have a modern art kind of look about them. Simple and elegant, the handles reach around the arm rest connecting to the door above and below it. Those are the touches a driver with impeccable tastes can appreciate — I like them too.\n\nThe X3, however, never shows off in the cab. It saves that for the road.\n\nThe 3-liter I-6, made of a composite of aluminum and magnesium, in the X3 cranks 260 horsepower and jumps off the line with a surge. This is a product of the 225-pound-feet torque and the all-wheel drive system that gets every tire moving quickly.\n\nThe steering is precise and has just enough of that twitchy feel in sharp turns to keep you mind on the road, the all-wheel drive system also handles wet roads very well, keeping the back in a tight line through a turn. The optional adaptive headlights will help with the big corners as they will remain level and follow you through the turn. Really, it is just fun to drive and it handles more like a car than a truck.\n\nFirst of all, the BMW nameplate carries a certain celebrity that other vehicles just don’t have. Secondly, it’s an expensive vehicle. Starting at $39,000, my test vehicle topped $47,000 once it was upgraded and added features such as heated front and rear seats, Xenon headlamps, navigation system, a premium audio system and HD radio.\n\nThey are all features I enjoyed and used while cruising about, though the price tag scared me a little. There are lots of other compact SUVs to choose from for a lot less — but none have the same abilities as the X3.\n\nI don’t see this as a serious off roading machine, more because I would hate to scratch the paint.\n\nNo, the X3 belongs on the highways and byways, blasting through curves and gobbling up straight-aways. The toughest off-roading should be the gravel driveway to the summer home or a snow-covered road on the ski trip.\n\nThat’s where the X3 will bring you the most joy.\n\n2008 BMW X3\n\nPrice: $39,000\n\nSeating capacity: 5\n\nEngine: 3-liter I-6\n\nTransmission: six-speed automatic or manual\n\nHorsepower: 260 @ 6,600 rpm\n\nTorque: 225-pound-feet @ 2,750 rpm\n\nTowing capacity: 3,500 pounds\n\nFuel tank: 17.7 gallons\n\nEPA gas mileage:\n\nManual: 16 mpg city / 23 mpg highway\n\nAutomatic: 17 mpg city / 24 mpg highway\n\nDimensions (inches):\n\nLength: 179.9\n\nWidth: 73\n\nHeight: 65.9\n\nWheelbase: 110.1\n\nCurb weight: 4,012\n\nInterior dimensions (inches):\n\nFront/rear\n\nHeadroom: 39/39\n\nShoulder room: 56/55\n\nLegroom: 40.2/35.8\n\nLuggage capacity: 30 cubic feet\n\nMaximum cargo capacity: 71 cubic feet\n\nWarranty:\n\n48 months / 50,000 miles unlimited\n\nFour-year BMW Roadside Assistance\n\n4 year / 50,000 miles Full Maintenance Program\n\nScott Burgess is the auto critic for The Detroit News.

      "expert_review": "You see them every day: SUVs operated by people who think sitting high behind the wheel of a large vehicle makes them nearly invulnerable, or believe a powerful engine and leather bucket seats mean they are driving a sports car.\n\nThe BMW X3 may suit both kinds of drivers.\n\nIt is not big (seating four adults comfortably, five in a pinch). It will tow a small boat or a utility trailer — not a cabin cruiser or big horse trailer. And it is not an off-road monster.\n\nBut those are not necessarily negatives. Far too many SUV owners buy vehicles with more capabilities — and expensive ones — than they will ever use.\n\nThe X3 sits low, so it has stability in corners — even in hard, sporty corners or fast lane-changes when passing on the highway. And its steering provided instant, accurate feedback, as though you could feel the tires carving at every moment.\n\nIts stablemate, the X5, was the first SUV out of the BMW garage in 2000. It is built with underpinnings from the 5 Series sedans and, as larger SUVs go, it also is quite stable.\n\nNow, with a tweak to the X3 lineup, which was introduced in 2004, BMW has made choosing the X3 ever more simple.\n\nFirst, the 2.5-liter, I-6 engine is gone. It really was a bit weak, even for a small but fully loaded SUV. Now, the only option is the 3.0i that we tested on Massachusetts highways and New Hampshire hills. At 225 horsepower, this I-6, 3.0-liter engine (a lesser option in the X5) is surprisingly powerful and quick.\n\nTransmissions include either a six-speed manual or, as tested, a five-speed automatic with manual-shift option.\n\nOutside, there is no mistaking this for anything other than a BMW. Unless they are parked side by side, it can be hard to distinguish the X3 from the X5. They both have distinct twin kidney grilles, sharp lower lines, sharper hip lines, and chopped rear ends.\n\nInside, the X3 is Spartan yet elegant. Seats are broad and supportive. The rear seat folds 60/40 and, with both sides down, a couple cruising the Maine coast on a Sunday afternoon would have plenty of room for antiques or overpriced lobster-trap coffee tables. You can secure your load safely with cargo tie-down points.\n\nGauges behind the wheel are big and easy to read, though I did find center stack controls for audio and climate to be a bit small and fussy.\n\nThe X3 has a standard antilock braking system, and stability control, which monitors wheels and sends power to those with the most traction. Also standard are front, front-side, and front-and-rear curtain air bags. Rear side-impact bags are optional.\n\nThe X3 is available in one trim level, with such standard fare as automatic climate control, vinyl upholstery, 17-inch alloy wheels, heated mirrors, and power locks and windows.\n\nPremium, Sport, and Cold Weather packages add such goodies as a leather interior, 18-inch wheels, sport-tuned suspension, heated front seats, navigation system, and rear parking sensors.\n\nThe test car had the first two, at $1,800 each, which helped to drive the price up to more than $44,000.\n\nRoyal Ford can be reached at ford@globe.com.\n\n2006 BMW X3\n\nTHE BASICS\nBase price/as tested: $36,800/$44,120\nFuel economy: 20.1 m.p.g. in Globe testing Annual fuel cost: $2,051 (at $3.171 per gallon, premium, 13,000 miles per year)\n\nTHE SPECIFICS\nDrivetrain: All-wheel drive\nSeating: Five occupants\nHorsepower: 225 Torque: 214 lb.-ft.\nOverall length: 179.7inches\nWheelbase: 110.1 inches\nHeight: 66.0 inches\nWidth: 73.0 inches\nCurb weight: 4,023 pounds\n\nTHE SKINNY\nNice touch: lots of rear cargo space in a vehicle that does not drive like a truck — or an SUV.\nAnnoyance: A luxury car in the $37,000-and-up range that tacks on an extra $475 for special paint? What’s that make the regular paint, cheap and dull?\nWatch for: more smaller SUVs and crossovers with these carlike features.",

      "expert_review": "BMW’s compact crossover, the X3, got a makeover for 2007, giving it a new engine and transmission, more-refined interior and a “freshened” exterior, the German luxury automaker says.\n\nBut the biggest news about the X3 just might be that production of the vehicle is expected to shift to BMW’s South Carolina plant from Austria, probably in 2010. BMW announced recently that it would expand production capacity of its Greer, S.C., plant to 200,000 vehicles a year, up from the present 140,000.\n\nAnd while the automaker has yet to say that the X3 will be added to the plant’s product list, the industry weekly Automotive News reported this past week that production would be moved from the Magna Steyr plant in Graz, Austria. Magna Steyr, an independent contractor, has been assembling the X3 for BMW since the vehicle was introduced for model year 2003.\n\nSeveral European automakers are looking to move more of their production to the United States as a hedge against the falling value of the dollar against the euro.\n\nIn its story, Automotive News said that BMW posted $900 million in currency losses last year because of the weakness of both the dollar and the Japanese yen against the euro.\n\nThe devalued dollar is making European travel much more expensive for Americans this year, which is affecting the tourism business.\n\nBut the bigger impact of the strong euro, the currency of the European Union, is on trade, particularly auto manufacturing. Building vehicles in the United States, where workers and other manufacturing expenses are paid with U.S. dollars, helps reduce costs vs. assembling the cars in Europe, and paying with euros – only to sell those vehicles in the United States for dollars.\n\nTo remain competitive in the U.S. market, BMW can’t raise its vehicle prices enough to counter the currency differences. But there is already extra capacity at the Spartanburg plant, which built 104,632 vehicles during 2006 – a decrease of 16 percent from 2005, Automotive News noted.\n\nThe Greer plant now builds the midsize X5 sport utility, as well as the Z4 sports car. The next generation of the X3 will be the one assembled at the U.S. plant, which also will build yet another new midsize crossover, the X6, which is scheduled for introduction sometime during 2008, according to the report.\n\nThe South Carolina plant, which is just off Interstate 85 between Greenville and Spartanburg, is a sprawling, state-of-the-art facility that opened in 2002. I’ve toured the plant twice, during separate media introductions of the X5 and Z4.\n\nThe X5 was the plant’s first product. If the X3 and X6 are added to the model mix along with the Z4 and X5, that will result in four models coming down the same assembly line.\n\nSuch a move would not be unprecedented in the auto plants of the South, however. Nissan, for instance, builds four models at its plant in Canton, Miss. Those are the Nissan Titan pickup, Altima sedan and Armada full-size sport utility, and the Infiniti QX56 premium SUV.\n\nThe BMW plant had a higher capacity until its two assembly lines were merged last year into a single flexible line.\n\nFlexible assembly lines can handle two or more different products at the same time, and are a popular new cost-saving development in auto manufacturing.\n\nThe Greer plant’s biggest year so far was 2003, when 166,090 vehicles were assembled.\n\nAs for the redesigned 2007 X3, this is the first in-depth redo of the vehicle since it was introduced, although BMW is not calling the ’07 model the second generation. The changes were not that drastic, and the vehicle still rides on the platform of the previous 3-series cars and has many carryover parts. The next generation will get a new chassis based on the current 3-series.\n\nThe X3, which BMW refers to as a “sports activity vehicle,” or SAV, now comes in only one model, whereas before 2006 there were two, the 2.5i and 3.0i.\n\nSAV is a BMW trademark, which is why you won’t see it being used to describe similar models by other manufacturers. BMW says the SAV is a vehicle that combines sportiness with the SUV form.\n\nThe X3 model designations referred to the biggest difference between the two versions – the engine. The 2.5i came with a 2.5-liter inline six-cylinder engine, while the 3.0i came with a 3.0-liter inline six. Both engines were taken from the 3-series car line. For 2007, the only model offered is the 3.0si.\n\nIt comes with a new 3.0-liter aluminum/magnesium Valvetronic inline six.\n\nList price is $38,000 (plus $695 freight), up from $36,800 last year.\n\nIn 2005, the X3 2.5i model, with its 175-horsepower engine, listed for just under $31,000, including freight, which gave the vehicle a bargain entry-level price.\n\nBut BMW said there were few takers for the 2.5i, as most customers wanted the bigger engine.\n\nThe new engine boosts the X3 to 260 horsepower from 225 for last year’s 3.0-liter six.\n\nA six-speed manual remains the standard gearbox, but optional (at no extra cost) is a new six-speed Steptronic automatic, which replaced last year’s five-speed automatic. The manual is offered in line with BMW’s reputation as a driver-oriented performance brand, and it is one of the few manuals available among premium SUVs. With the new powertrain, the X3’s performance has improved.\n\nIt can accelerate from zero to 60 mph in 6.9 seconds with the manual transmission, down from 7.6 seconds last year.\n\nWith the automatic, 60 mph is achieved in as little as 7.1 seconds, an improvement of 0.8 seconds over the 2006 model, BMW says. I’ll take the company’s word for it – I didn’t check the performance of the automatic-transmission model I tested.\n\nSurprisingly, the X3’s bigger engine has better fuel economy than last year’s. The 2007 EPA ratings are 19 miles per gallon city/26 highway with the automatic, and 18 city/26 highway with the manual. That’s up from 16 city/23 highway with last year’s automatic version, and 17 city/25 highway with the manual.\n\nThe sixth gear in the automatic transmission, which is a second overdrive, is responsible for some of the extra efficiency.\n\nLast year, BMW beefed up the standard-equipment list for the X3 to try to put it ahead of its competitors. Added was a panoramic sunroof, and the automatic transmission was made a no-cost option.\n\nNew this year are “numerous interior and exterior revisions,” BMW says, “including reworked front and rear styling, new standard and optional wheels, and richer interior materials.”\n\nAmong the interior improvements are “richer, more refined materials” on the instrument panel and door panels, along with a new dashboard covering, and “Pearl Gloss” trim on the air conditioning vents, the company says.\n\nStandard are new “star” spoke 17-inch wheels, while double-spoke 18-inch and V-spoke 19-inch wheels are optional.\n\nAll-wheel drive with BMW’s xDrive system is standard, along with electronic stability control and traction control, side-curtain air bags for both rows of seats, and a new tire-pressure monitoring system.\n\nThere is no third-seat option for the X3; it seats five people in two rows.\n\nPremium, sport and cold-weather packages are optional.\n\nDirect competitors include the all-new Land Rover LR2 (just under $35,000 with freight), as well as the four-cylinder (240 horsepower) Acura RDX ($33,700-$37,000). Those two vehicles are the closest in size to the X3, which is just slightly smaller and about 600 pounds lighter than the X5.\n\nThe X5 starts at just under $45,000 (plus freight) for the 3.0si model that has the same engine as the X3. A V-8 version of the X5, called the 4.8i, starts just under $51,000. The X3 competes price-wise with slightly larger midsize crossovers such as the Volvo XC90 ($37,000 for the V-6 model), Cadillac SRX ($37,000), Infiniti FX35 ($38,000), Lexus RX 350 ($38,000) and the new Lincoln MKX ($35,000-$37,000).",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in May 2009 about the 2009 BMW X3. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2010, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThere is very little about the 2009 BMW X3 that hasn’t already been covered by Cars.com; the 2007 model that Kelsey Mays reviewed is essentially the same vehicle that’s offered for 2009. What has changed, however, is the X3’s competition, as a number of new luxury SUVs have debuted in the intervening years that BMW now has to contend with.\n\nWhile the car’s pros and cons haven’t changed much, the X3 is showing its age in terms of technology features — especially when compared with newcomers that best it in both price and style.\n\nExterior\nThe exterior remains the same for 2009, and the X3 retains its awkward angles, disjointed taillights and odd lower bodywork. It’s not unattractive, but it sure isn’t as stylish as Mercedes’ new GLK350, Audi’s Q5 or the new Volvo XC60, which actually turned heads when I tested it recently.\n\nInterior\nEven though it’s relatively unchanged for 2009, the X3’s interior remains very upscale for this segment. My test car’s dark brown leather upholstery and black dashboard made for an especially classy color combination. As usual, BMW’s leather is of a higher grade than you’ll find in other vehicles.\n\nThe front seats are comfortable and supportive, and even the backseat isn’t terribly uncomfortable. Backseat legroom overall is about average for the class, coming in at 35.8 inches, compared with 35.1 in the GLK350, 36.4 in the XC60 and 37.4 in the Q5.\n\nThe best part of the X3 is its utility. The cargo area is exceptionally tall compared with others in the class, which means you can stack things upright that you’d otherwise have to lay flat, like golf bags. The load floor is also nice and low, which makes Costco runs a lot easier on your back. The X3 bests the three models above in overall cargo room, and it only trails the Volvo when the rear seats are up.\n\nPerformance\nFor 2009, there’s just one engine: a 3.0-liter six-cylinder that’s good for 260 horsepower. It teams with either a six-speed manual or a six-speed automatic transmission. All X3s have all-wheel drive. In our 2007 review, we thought the automatic’s shift quality was imprecise and a bore. I also drove a family member’s 2005 X3 and remember thinking the transmission wasn’t the best. The 2009, however, shifted flawlessly and was much more enjoyable to drive around town. Power has never been a problem in the X3; even though we love BMW’s twin-turbo six-cylinder, the X3’s normally aspirated six is no slouch.\n\nSteering is tremendously heavy and laborious, as is often the case in BMWs. While I appreciate such weighted steering in a performance car — and in the X3 when I’m driving at high speeds — I found it burdensome when navigating parking lots in this meant-for-the-suburbs SUV. That said, the steering is spot-on precise.\n\nRide comfort is a mixed bag. While highway driving was comfortable, the X3 hiccups around the pothole-strewn streets of Chicago and its suburbs at even the lowest of speeds. Believe it or not, this tester felt like an improvement compared with X3s I’ve driven in the past. I hopped into the XC60 after my X3 test week was over, and it had very similar road sensitivity. To my mind, the GLK350 is better in this regard. I haven’t yet tested the Q5.\n\nFeatures\nThe 2009 X3 starts at $39,700 and comes standard with leatherette upholstery, eight-way power front seats, a panoramic moonroof and rain-sensing windshield wipers. There are four option packages available. The $2,800 Premium Package, which my test vehicle came equipped with, adds upgrades like leather upholstery, auto-dimming mirrors, a universal garage door opener and Bluetooth. All of this should be standard in a vehicle in this class. There are also Sport Activity ($1,400) and Sport ($2,300) packages available that add varying interior and exterior features, including larger wheels and, in the case of the Sport package, a different suspension.\n\nOur tester also had a Cold Weather Package ($1,000) that included heated front and rear seats, as well as the optional navigation system ($1,800). The navigation system in the X3 is severely outdated and isn’t operated via the company’s iDrive controller. Not only is the screen hard to see in direct sunlight, but the system got one of our editors lost on a long test drive. And no, that doesn’t happen often.\n\nIf you optioned out an X3 like our tester was equipped, it would have an as-tested price of $47,375, including an $825 destination charge.\n\nThe Q5 and XC60 start at $37,200, and the all-wheel-drive GLK350 is $35,900. Similarly equipped, the Q5 and GLK would both cost around $45,000, and the XC60 would come in at about $43,000. That means the X3 isn’t just more to start, it’s more when similarly equipped, yet it offers outdated features, like its navigation unit. The other models also have newer options like iPod integration, blind spot warning systems and more that the X3 doesn’t offer.\n\nSafety\nThe X3 earned a 2009 Top Safety Pick designation from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the agency’s highest award. That means it earned top scores in IIHS’ frontal-offset, side-impact and rear crash tests. All X3s have standard electronic stability control and a full complement of airbags.\n\nAs of publication, the Q5, GLK350 and XC60 hadn’t been tested by IIHS.\n\nX3 in the Market\nAs you can probably guess by now, the market has caught up with and in many ways passed the X3. That said, if it weren’t for BMW’s initiative, this segment might not even exist today, let alone offer so many robust choices; Infiniti, Acura and Land Rover also offer competitors.\n\nWhile the X3’s performance chops are probably better than they’ve ever been, that might not matter much in this segment. Buyers are looking for a certain level of luxury and features, plus mild utility and a decent price, and the X3 isn’t delivering.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "There is very little about the 2009 BMW X3 that hasn’t already been covered by Cars.com; the 2007 model that Kelsey Mays reviewed is essentially the same vehicle that’s offered for 2009. What has changed, however, is the X3’s competition, as a number of new luxury SUVs have debuted in the intervening years that BMW now has to contend with.\n\nWhile the car’s pros and cons haven’t changed much, the X3 is showing its age in terms of technology features — especially when compared with newcomers that best it in both price and style.\n\nExterior\nThe exterior remains the same for 2009, and the X3 retains its awkward angles, disjointed taillights and odd lower bodywork. It’s not unattractive, but it sure isn’t as stylish as Mercedes’ new GLK350, Audi’s Q5 or the new Volvo XC60, which actually turned heads when I tested it recently.\n\nInterior\nEven though it’s relatively unchanged for 2009, the X3’s interior remains very upscale for this segment. My test car’s dark brown leather upholstery and black dashboard made for an especially classy color combination. As usual, BMW’s leather is of a higher grade than you’ll find in other vehicles.\n\nThe front seats are comfortable and supportive, and even the backseat isn’t terribly uncomfortable. Backseat legroom overall is about average for the class, coming in at 35.8 inches, compared with 35.1 in the GLK350, 36.4 in the XC60 and 37.4 in the Q5.\n\nThe best part of the X3 is its utility. The cargo area is exceptionally tall compared with others in the class, which means you can stack things upright that you’d otherwise have to lay flat, like golf bags. The load floor is also nice and low, which makes Costco runs a lot easier on your back. The X3 bests the three models above in overall cargo room, and it only trails the Volvo when the rear seats are up.\n\nPerformance\nFor 2009, there’s just one engine: a 3.0-liter six-cylinder that’s good for 260 horsepower. It teams with either a six-speed manual or a six-speed automatic transmission. All X3s have all-wheel drive. In our 2007 review, we thought the automatic’s shift quality was imprecise and a bore. I also drove a family member’s 2005 X3 and remember thinking the transmission wasn’t the best. The 2009, however, shifted flawlessly and was much more enjoyable to drive around town. Power has never been a problem in the X3; even though we love BMW’s twin-turbo six-cylinder, the X3’s normally aspirated six is no slouch.\n\nSteering is tremendously heavy and laborious, as is often the case in BMWs. While I appreciate such weighted steering in a performance car — and in the X3 when I’m driving at high speeds — I found it burdensome when navigating parking lots in this meant-for-the-suburbs SUV. That said, the steering is spot-on precise.\n\nRide comfort is a mixed bag. While highway driving was comfortable, the X3 hiccups around the pothole-strewn streets of Chicago and its suburbs at even the lowest of speeds. Believe it or not, this tester felt like an improvement compared with X3s I’ve driven in the past. I hopped into the XC60 after my X3 test week was over, and it had very similar road sensitivity. To my mind, the GLK350 is better in this regard. I haven’t yet tested the Q5.\n\nFeatures\nThe 2009 X3 starts at $39,700 and comes standard with leatherette upholstery, eight-way power front seats, a panoramic moonroof and rain-sensing windshield wipers. There are four option packages available. The $2,800 Premium Package, which my test vehicle came equipped with, adds upgrades like leather upholstery, auto-dimming mirrors, a universal garage door opener and Bluetooth. All of this should be standard in a vehicle in this class. There are also Sport Activity ($1,400) and Sport ($2,300) packages available that add varying interior and exterior features, including larger wheels and, in the case of the Sport package, a different suspension.\n\nOur tester also had a Cold Weather Package ($1,000) that included heated front and rear seats, as well as the optional navigation system ($1,800). The navigation system in the X3 is severely outdated and isn’t operated via the company’s iDrive controller. Not only is the screen hard to see in direct sunlight, but the system got one of our editors lost on a long test drive. And no, that doesn’t happen often.\n\nIf you optioned out an X3 like our tester was equipped, it would have an as-tested price of $47,375, including an $825 destination charge.\n\nThe Q5 and XC60 start at $37,200, and the all-wheel-drive GLK350 is $35,900. Similarly equipped, the Q5 and GLK would both cost around $45,000, and the XC60 would come in at about $43,000. That means the X3 isn’t just more to start, it’s more when similarly equipped, yet it offers outdated features, like its navigation unit. The other models also have newer options like iPod integration, blind spot warning systems and more that the X3 doesn’t offer.\n\nSafety\nThe X3 earned a 2009 Top Safety Pick designation from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the agency’s highest award. That means it earned top scores in IIHS’ frontal-offset, side-impact and rear crash tests. All X3s have standard electronic stability control and a full complement of airbags.\n\nAs of publication, the Q5, GLK350 and XC60 hadn’t been tested by IIHS.\n\nX3 in the Market\nAs you can probably guess by now, the market has caught up with and in many ways passed the X3. That said, if it weren’t for BMW’s initiative, this segment might not even exist today, let alone offer so many robust choices; Infiniti, Acura and Land Rover also offer competitors.\n\nWhile the X3’s performance chops are probably better than they’ve ever been, that might not matter much in this segment. Buyers are looking for a certain level of luxury and features, plus mild utility and a decent price, and the X3 isn’t delivering.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "Excellence continued\n\nThe BMW X3 is slightly smaller than the popular X5.\n\nWhen BMW announced plans to build a sport utility vehicle, it was assailed by critics who feared that the German builder of highly regarded sport sedans was caving to market forces and diluting the brand.\n\nBut the X5 lived up to BMW’s reputation for performance and prestige, and has been highly successful. That was four years ago, and BMW now has a new SUV, the compact X3, that is slightly smaller, more carlike and less expensive than X5.\n\nAs the X5 is a sibling of BMW’s 5-series sedans, X3 is akin to the smaller 3 series, BMW’s most popular line. X3 is certainly not a mini doppelganger of X5 but a vehicle with an entirely separate style and image.\n\nStarting at $31,000, or $11,000 less than the cheapest X5, X3 has a lower roofline and sleeker styling, set up as a “crossover” vehicle that blends the qualities of SUVs and passenger cars.\n\nBMW calls X3 a compact SUV, but it’s not compact in the sense of Toyota RAV4 or Honda CR-V. It’s more along the lines of Toyota’s midsize Highlander. Just four inches shorter than X5, it rides on a substantial 110-inch wheelbase with a spacious interior and accommodations for five.\n\nMost importantly, X3 drives like a BMW, with much of the same spark and maneuverability as the 3-series automobiles. Though the ride is softer, befitting its role as family transport, and it lacks some of the aggressive edge of the X5, the latest BMW fulfills its mission without damaging BMW’s reputation.\n\nNotch up another winner for BMW, whose affluent buyers now have yet another choice.\n\nWhat it is\n\nA new SUV for BMW, blending practicality, style and performance.\n\nPerformance\n\nX3 comes with two versions of BMW’s familiar inline-six engines, a 2.5-liter producing 184 horsepower and a 3-liter with 225 horsepower. These are the same aluminum engines found in BMW’s 3-series cars, including the Z4 sports car.\n\nThe test SUV was equipped with the 3-liter six, a gutsy and enjoyable engine that provides plenty of pull for this two-ton vehicle. Power is soft off the line but gains muscle as engine speed builds.\n\nThe bigger engine comes at a $6,000 premium over the 2.5 liter, though that includes a bunch of additional features and upgrades.\n\nBoth models and the latest X5 are equipped with BMW’s new xDrive all-wheel-drive system that’s designed to improve handling on dry road as well as provide traction off the highway or in mud, ice and snow. The system operates as a rear-wheel drive but continuously feeds torque as needed to the front wheels through a complex electronic system and multiplate clutchX3 should not be confused with a tough off-road warrior, however. It’s low ground clearance and carlike suspension makes it suitable for rough dirt roads or muddy trails, but leave boulder-hopping to the Jeep guys. Or the X5, wh ich is better set up for back-country expeditions.\n\nX3 comes with either a six-speed manual or five-speed automatic transmission. The tester came with automatic, which was kind of an expensive option at $1,275. It shifted flawlessly.\n\nDrivability\n\nNot as crisp handling as the X5 or BMW automobiles, X3 feels stable but sedate in cornering maneuvers and lane changes. The rack-and-pinion steering and four-wheel disc brakes are very responsive.\n\nThe front suspension is unique to X3 for improved ride and handling, and the chassis feels very stiff and solid.\n\nX3 comes with significant high-technology features to improve drivability and safety. The overall system is called Dynamic Stability Control, which includes electronic brake-force proportioning, antilock braking, wheel-brake action for stability in corners, Hill Descent Control for steep off-roading descents and a function to improve trailer-towing stability.\n\nStyling\n\nEas ly recognizable as a BMW, with a lower, leaner look than X5.\n\nInterior\n\nThe interior has BMW’s usual sturdy feel, with a nicely laid out dashboard and supportive seats. It’s surprisingly roomy, front and rear, with a decent amount of luggage room in back.\n\nThe look is pretty conservative, though, compared with the futuristic interiors of many new SUVs and minivans.\n\nThere were a host of convenience and safety features on the test X3 including standard computer system, eight-way power seats and automatic climate control. There was an optional premium package that included a panoramic glass moonroof that spanned but front and rear seats, with the glass sliding open over the front.\n\nPricing\n\nBase price for the 3.0-liter model is $36,300, with the test X3 including the premium package with the panoramic moonroof, leather upholstery and upgraded interior trim, $2,550; a sport package of 18-inch alloy wheels, sport steering wheel, sport suspension, sport seats and special exterior trim, $1,500; automatic, $1,275; a cold weather package of heated seats, heated headlight washers and ski bag, $750; titanium silver metallic paint, $475; privacy glass, $350; and shipping, $695.\n\nThe total of $43,895 makes the X3 fairly exclusive and pushes it well into X5 territory.\n\nBottom line\n\nA practical and stylish compromise between car and SUV for well-financed families.",

      "expert_review": "When BMW introduced its X5 SUV in 1999, I was mesmerized by the experience of driving an SUV that not only looked like a BMW but also performed like one.\n\nThat X5 was a vehicle that was out of both my needs and price range, but it had earned one of the “first love” spots in my heart. BMW got this one “right” from the beginning.\n\nWhen this week’s test car, a BMW X3 compact SUV, hit my driveway, it sparked a déjà vu experience. While earlier versions of the X3 left something to be desired, this new model has grown up and been transformed from a not-so-perfect compact SUV into a swan-like, mid-sized SUV.\n\nThat original X5 from 1999 was 183.7 inches long with a 111-inch wheelbase. It was 73.7 inches wide and a bit over 67 inches high. Our “compact” X3 is 183 inches long, has a 110.5-inch wheelbase and is wider (74.1 inches) and shorter (65.4 inches) than that X5.\n\nGone were the outgoing X3 model’s choppy ride and chintzy (by BMW standards) interior accoutrements. Rear passengers enjoy plenty of legroom. Three can fit in back, but two can ride in style back there with a lowered armrest. The rear seatback is a 40-20-40 configuration and can be lowered as needed for added cargo space. We put one side down to slide in an eight-foot box holding a new Christmas tree.\n\nThe ride is thanks to a refined suspension and electronic power steering. However, to be sure, we took a series of rides over my latest local torture track, a quarter-mile section of Hay Street in Newbury, Ma. The X3 proved to be ready for the worst New England will throw at it—at least in on-road situations.\n\nOur X3 was the base xDrive28i model, powered by the tried-and-true BMW 3.0-liter in-line six-cylinder engine mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission and the company’s xDrive all-wheel-drive system. It was a perfect vehicle to have on hand for our Halloween weekend Nor’easter.\n\nThe X3 is available with a turbocharged version of the 3.0-liter six, which should be a rocket, if that’s your preference. But we were quite happy with the performance of the lesser version.\n\nIt took a while to get used to the throttle response—a bit slow starting off unless you gave it a little extra push. Then the powertrain was in its element with quick shifts and effortless acceleration in all other conditions.\n\nIn true BMW engineering style, the automatic transmission downshifts the correct number of gears for smooth power delivery according to the throttle request.\n\nStandard features include stability control with brake drying, braking stand-by, and brake-fade compensation. Also standard were a start-off assist, hill-descent control, and electronic speed-sensitive steering.\n\nThe base price is $37,625 (including destination). I’d be happy living with that base vehicle. However, a long list of options run the bottom line to $44,165. They include:\n\n    The sport activity package ($1,550) that adds alloy wheels, sport steering wheel, aluminum satin roof rails, exterior trim package, and sport seats.\n\n    The premium package ($3,450) with Siena wood trim, panoramic moonroof, auto-dimming rearview and side mirrors, lumbar support, a storage package, and enhanced interior lighting.\n\n    A heated steering wheel ($190), keyless entry ($500), heated front seats ($500) and satellite radio with a year’s subscription ($350).\n\nHowever talented BMW’s engineering staff may be, they still need an IE—Intuitive Engineer—on their staff. Controls remain peculiar to the brand, something that has become second nature to long-time BMW owners, but can be off-putting to newcomers to the marque.\n\nFor two days, I refused to believe our X3 had the heated steering wheel the sticker listed as part of its equipment. Reading the owner’s manual was some help, but even the arrow on the controls diagram didn’t really locate the switch, hidden low on the left side of the steering column behind the large lever that adjusts the tilt-and-telescope steering wheel feature.\n\nThe push-button start-stop switch is also confusing, leaving the radio and other accessories activated when the engine is stopped. Because the engine was so quiet I once managed to get out of the car and lock the door with the engine still quietly running; only realizing it because the running lights still were on. Likewise, a rain-sensitive feature on the windshield wipers needs to be activated by pushing a button on the end of the stalk.\n\nBut these are the things BMW owners know … and smirk when the likes of me works up the learning curve—which is a road worth taking.\n\n2011 BMW X3 xDrive 28i\n\nTHE BASICS\nPrice, base/as tested (with destination): $37,625 / $44,165. Fuel economy, EPA estimated: 19 mpg city / 26 mpg highway. Fuel economy, Globe observed: 24.8. Drivetrain: 3.0-liter in-line six-cylinder engine, eight-speed automatic transmission, all-wheel-drive. Body: 5-passenger SUV.\n\nTHE SPECIFICS\nHorsepower: 240. Torque: 221 lb.-ft. Overall length: 183.0 in. Wheelbase: 110.5 in. Height: 65.4 in. Width: 74.1 in. Curb weight: 4,112 pounds.\n\nTHE GOOD: Refined ride and powertrain.\n\nTHE BAD: High-priced options, tricky initial throttle response.\n\nTHE BOTTOM LINE: The X3 has grown up and can play with the bigger kids on the block.\n\nALSO CONSIDER: Acura RDX, Audi Q5, Infiniti EX35, Mercedes-Benz GLK 350, Volvo XC60.",

      "expert_review": "Redesigned for 2018, the BMW X3 has standard all-wheel drive and comes in four-cylinder (xDrive30i) and six-cylinder (M40i) configurations. We drove a well-optioned X3 xDrive30i.\n\nCleaner Styling\n\nThe new X3 is decluttered versus the 2017 model, emulating the smaller X1 — a handsome place to start. Three bumper openings replace the prior four, with lighting elements in the outboard units instead of last year’s separate foglight dimples. Styling is subjective, of course, but I suspect this will age well — unlike the first- and second-generation X3s, which struck me as too busy-looking.\n\nExterior dimensions haven’t changed, but the wheelbase is 2.2 inches longer. Eighteen-inch alloy wheels, LED low-beam headlights and dual tailpipes are standard. So is dark lower cladding that brings a durable, go-anywhere look; that’s a check the BMW X3’s 8 inches of ground clearance should be able to cash. The M40i swaps that cladding for body-colored ground effects, though an optional M Sport Package on the xDrive30i emulates much of the look for less cash. You can also get adaptive headlights, LED high beams and wheels up to 21 inches.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nA poky eight-speed automatic transmission holds back an otherwise strong driving experience in the X3 xDrive30i, whose 2.0-liter turbo four-cylinder makes 248 horsepower and 258 pounds-feet of torque. It’s a capable engine with broad power that comes early and stays late. That’s much needed, as the transmission resists downshifts in its normal driving mode until you push the gas hard. (A Sport mode helps by holding lower gears longer, but it does so inconsistently.) But even absent a downshift, the xDrive30i has enough low-rpm muscle to maintain highway speed with multiple occupants aboard.\n\nThe SUV’s rear-drive roots reveal competent balance if you push it hard, but numb steering and modest body roll don’t encourage spirited driving. Sport mode shores up some of the body lean and relaxes power-steering assist to improve feedback through the turn, but the initial numbness remains. On the flip side, at least ride quality is strong. With its optional adaptive shock absorbers, our xDrive30i had a degree of sophistication that’s rare for this class — better than the unsorted Volvo XC60 and busy Lexus RX, and quieter on broken pavement than the Audi Q5.\n\nIf you want something more hardcore, the X3 M40i employs a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-6 (355 horsepower, 369 pounds-feet of torque). BMW says it hits 60 mph in a scant 4.6 seconds, versus 6 seconds flat for the xDrive30i. The M40i also gets higher-performance suspension tuning, plus a litany of hardware that’s optional on the xDrive30i: a performance steering ratio, upgraded brakes and AWD that sends more power to the outside wheels during corners. (Numb reflexes and all, our xDrive30i test car had those options.) Adaptive shock absorbers are also optional on the M40i.\n\nEPA-estimated fuel economy for the xDrive30i is 22/29/25 mpg (city/highway/combined), which is competitive with the class. Over some 360 miles of mostly highway driving, I hit the highway rating on the dot. The M40i sacrifices 2 mpg across the board. Like most German luxury models, all versions of the BMW X3 prefer premium gas. Competitors like the RX and Cadillac XT5 are less efficient but run fine on the cheap stuff. It’s a toss-up.\n\nThe Inside\n\nThe new X3’s cabin follows BMW’s norm, with a mashup of stacked controls below a tablet-like screen that floats above the center air vents. Storage provisions are good, and handsome materials adorn all eye-level areas, with an optional stitched vinyl wrap on upper sections of the dashboard and doors. Still, grainier finishes and unpadded surfaces sit below elbow level — on par with most competitors, though the Mercedes-Benz GLC-Class and XC60 feel a cut above.\n\nPower-adjustable front seats and vinyl upholstery, which BMW calls SensaTec, are standard. Leather is optional, as are heated and ventilated front seats and heated rear seats. The seats are comfortable overall, with good headroom in both rows despite our test car’s optional panoramic moonroof (a feature that typically cuts overhead space). Chunky grab handles on the front doors invade outboard knee space, and adults in back may find their knees uncomfortably elevated because the bench sits so low to the floor. Overall legroom in back is merely so-so.\n\nThe 40/20/40-split backseat reclines a few degrees but doesn’t slide. A power liftgate is standard, and BMW pegs cargo volume at 28.7 cubic feet behind the backseat and 62.7 cubic feet with the seats folded. We’ve found cargo specs unreliable, but BMW says it measured the X3 in apples-to-apples fashion with its other SUVs. At minimum, that suggests cargo volume closer to that of the X1 (27.1 cubic feet behind the rear seats; 58.7 cubic feet with the seats folded) than the X5 (35.8 and 76.7 cubic feet).\n\nHD radio, Bluetooth and a 6.5-inch display with a backup camera — but not a touchscreen — is standard. Some more premium package options include a 10.3-inch display that works via touchscreen or BMW’s iDrive system controls. You can also get wireless Apple CarPlay, BMW’s newfangled gesture control, a 12.3-inch digital instrument panel, LTE in-car Wi-Fi and a bevy of device compatibility (smartphone and smartwatch apps, plus Amazon Echo integration). Despite all this, Android Auto is unavailable.\n\nThe X3 has yet to be crash-tested, but forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking remains optional, not standard. That’s an important safety provision that’s widely standard in the class; it’s even standard on a $16,530 Toyota Yaris. BMW needs to get with the program. Other options run the semi-autonomous gamut, from lane-centering steering to adaptive cruise control. Both systems can work all the way down to a stop, though the steering feature requires periodic driver inputs; it isn’t hands-free like Cadillac’s Super Cruise.\n\nVersus the Alternatives\n\nShopping the X3 M40i? Have at it. We haven’t driven the high-performance X3, which starts in the mid-$50,000s and runs to about $70,000 with all options; it gives enthusiasts an alternative to the Audi SQ5, Mercedes-AMG GLC43 and others of that ilk.\n\nBut I suspect most X3 shoppers want the xDrive30i, which accounts for some 85 percent of the 2018 model-year X3 inventory on Cars.com as of this writing. It starts around $43,500 and tops out in the low $60,000s with a full slate of factory options. That’s in line with competing, base-engine luxury SUVs. Just look around the showroom first.\n\nThe X1 runs from the mid-$30,000s with similar standard features (albeit optional AWD) to the low $50,000s with a slew of options. Luxury cars have a way of playing up the numbers, but the X3 is not automatically better. Its smaller sibling gives up some front-seat comfort but repays it in back, with a higher seating position plus an optional reclining and sliding backseat. Cargo space and acceleration are comparable, as is cabin quality. The X1 rides notably firmer with no handling payoff to show for it — its weakest point, to be sure, but something I doubt will rankle many SUV drivers in practice.\n\nSeldom does a class beg you to upgrade more than subcompact SUVs do. They seem to want you to opt for their larger, compact siblings — even among luxury brands. The X1 is the exception. It’s a remarkable SUV in an unremarkable class, and it gives X3 shoppers a compelling alternative at substantial savings.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "BMWs have been getting stranger and stranger with every newly introduced or refreshed model, pushing the limits of styling both on the inside and the outside while still delivering the German luxury brand’s signature driving enjoyment. But that ever more unusual wrapper still came with the benefit of high-quality materials, smart packaging and useful features — until now. Behold the X3 M50 xDrive, BMW’s luxury compact SUV, which has been redesigned for 2025. It’s the beneficiary of a reskinned exterior and a new cabin — and it is an absolute mess.\n\nRelated: BMW Redesigns X3 SUV for 2025, Starts at $50,675\n\nWhy Would You Make It Look Like the iX?\n\nThe undeniably ugliest vehicle in the BMW showroom is the iX electric mid-size SUV, and with its own updates for the 2026 model year, it retains that title. But BMW decided that instead of making the iX look like the more appealing prior-generation X3 or the X5, it was going to go the other way and style the redesigned X3 after the iX. The new X3 has a grille and headlight treatment that’s reminiscent of the iX’s, and having a dark paint color like my test vehicle’s matte-finish Frozen Deep Grey does help mask the awfulness of the front-end styling — but not much. The X3’s optional 21-inch wheels help the look some, but the flat-black murdered-out look does not compliment the X3’s styling. Rather, it simply makes it look unfinished, like the primer has been sprayed on but not the color coat.\n\nThankfully, you only have to look at it as you approach or depart the SUV, so the styling changes aren’t terribly egregious. For the truly awful part, you’ll have to get inside and have a seat.\n\nWhat the Hell Happened in Here?\n\nThe redesigned interior is a hot mess. It starts with a surprising lack of room in front due to a thick door panel combined with an unnecessarily wide center console. You’d think this was BMW’s smaller X1 SUV instead of its X3 given how cramped it is inside. It’s even less spacious and comfortable up front than a subcompact Volkswagen Taos. But the list of egregious missteps only continues from there.\n\nFirst is the materials quality, which would be questionable in a budget-brand vehicle but is absolutely unacceptable in a luxury marque. Your average Hyundai has a higher-quality interior than what I found in this expensive luxury SUV. All of the plastic trim, all of it, feels cheap, thin and hollow. BMW’s clear plastic “crystal-like” trim is present, and it changes color with ambient lighting changes, but it still looks like chintzy plastic. Simple things like the air vents use a bizarre combination of BMW’s “0-1” touch-sensitive sliders and unusual directional control knobs. The steering-wheel position is comically low even at its highest-set position, and it’s so thick that it’s actually difficult to properly grab — and this is for someone like me who has large hands; if you don’t have large hands, it’s going to feel absolutely massive.\n\nYet while the steering wheel position is oddly low, the seats themselves are oddly high, with a steep rake to the seat bottom that makes it feel like you’re steering the X3 from your lap. The dashboard slopes down dramatically, but the beltline is high, making the windshield seem curiously small and outward visibility (to the front) less than stellar. This has to be one of the most uncomfortable, oddly arranged driving positions I’ve ever experienced in a modern car. At least there’s sufficient headroom, even with a panoramic moonroof overhead. The same cannot be said for rear-seat legroom; if your front occupants are over 5 feet, 9 inches tall, fitting anyone in the backseat will be a serious challenge. The packaging, space utilization, materials quality and layout of the new X3’s cabin is nothing short of atrocious for a luxury SUV.\n\nNice to Drive, But So What?\n\nThere are two flavors of X3 for 2025: the X3 30 xDrive, featuring a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine making 255 horsepower and 295 pounds-feet of torque, or the X3 M50 xDrive, packing a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder engine making 393 hp and 428 pounds-feet of torque. The M50’s numbers are extremely robust, and BMW says the SUV can blast from 0-60 in just 4.4 seconds (6 seconds flat for the X3 30).\n\nDynamically, the X3 M50 is fantastic — quick and responsive, with neutral, well-balanced ride and handling. The snorty character of the snarling inline-six is fun, and the mechanicals of the X3 M50 practically beg the driver to hustle a little bit faster, take a turn more sharply and generally enjoy themselves given what the car can do.\n\nBut as the driver, I was so uncomfortable, so oddly positioned, and so unable to properly grip the massive steering wheel or use the ancillary controls that I simply didn’t want to spend time driving it aggressively. It has the goods to be a truly fun and engaging sporty SUV, but the design failures of the cabin make it a place you simply don’t want to spend much time in — not when there are more accommodating, more comfortable, more luxurious, more easily usable interiors in other luxury SUVs that offer the same level of kicks (see models like the Mercedes-AMG GLC43, Audi SQ5, Maserati Grecale and Land Rover Range Rover Velar).\n\nSo, it’s a hot-performing little number, this new X3 M50 xDrive, but it’s also surprisingly awful inside, a stunning miss from a longtime market-leading luxury brand that suggests something’s gone very wrong in Munich. The icing on this underbaked cake is the price: My test vehicle rang in at a stunning $76,675, including delivery fee, which is a ludicrous price for a cabin full of absent luxuriousness and unacceptable quality. BMW can make much better cars than this — and they still do. The latest X3 is not the brand’s best effort, to say the least.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nWhich Trim Level of the 2025 BMW X3 Should You Buy?\n2022 BMW X3 M Competition Review: Competing for Bragging Rights\n2023 BMW X3 Named IIHS Top Safety Pick+\nResearch BMW Vehicles\nShop for a 2025 BMW X3 Near You\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in April 2011 about the 2011 BMW X3. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2012, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe BMW X3 may have been a pioneer among compact luxury crossovers, but a number of competitors — including the Audi Q5, Mercedes-Benz GLK-Class and Volvo XC60 — have entered the fray since its debut as a 2004 model. Now, with the second-generation X3, BMW has new metal to take them on.\n\nThe 2011 BMW X3 is still the small luxury crossover of choice for driving enthusiasts, but its substantially more forgiving suspension tuning should make the new version far more appealing.\n\nI tested the base xDrive28i, which starts at $36,750; with options, our test car’s sticker price was $43,875. For a side-by-side comparison with the competitors mentioned above, click here.\n\nRide & Handling\nOne of my lasting memories of the prior-generation X3 was its extremely firm ride, which led to a choppy driving experience on rough roads. It was disappointing, to say the least, because BMWs often strike an impressive balance between decent ride comfort and top-tier handling. In the old X3, such comfort was nowhere to be found.\n\nFast-forward to 2011 and the new X3, and the experience is significantly better. The redesigned X3’s suspension is much more forgiving on potholed pavement — much the same way a 3 Series is — but maintains the balanced handling that earns BMW respect in enthusiast circles. Toss the X3 into a corner, and after some initial body roll it steadies itself and gives you confidence to go faster. There’s no getting around the fact that the X3 isn’t as rewarding to drive as are BMW’s cars — its taller stance degrades the driving experience — but it’s one of the most fun-to-drive compact luxury crossovers available today.\n\nContributing to the driving experience is the X3’s standard rear-biased xDrive all-wheel drive. The system does a good rear-wheel-drive imitation when accelerating out of a corner; the X3 squats a little over its outside rear wheel and holds the line it’s on.\n\nThere was a time when you could bulk up your forearms just by commuting in a BMW, but today they have much more power-steering assistance, resulting in lighter, easier steering; driving up and down the spirals of a parking garage is a breeze. While this comfort-oriented nature may draw scorn from BMW purists, it’s the right choice for a luxury crossover.\n\nGoing & Stopping\nThe xDrive28i’s 3.0-liter, inline-six-cylinder engine is unexpectedly stout, and it makes this two-ton crossover pretty quick; BMW cites a zero-to-60-mph acceleration time of 6.7 seconds, and you never get a sense that the engine’s working hard. A more powerful xDrive35i with a turbocharged six-cylinder is offered, but the base model is by no means underpowered.\n\nContributing to both acceleration performance and fuel economy is the X3’s new eight-speed automatic transmission (a manual gearbox isn’t offered). The addition of two more forward gears versus the old X3’s automatic results in more optimized ratios, and the drivetrain gets an EPA-estimated 19/25 mpg city/highway. That’s ahead of the all-wheel-drive Mercedes-Benz GLK350 (16/21) and the base engine in the all-wheel-drive XC60 (18/24), but it trails the base turbo four-cylinder in the Q5 (20/27).\n\nNot all is well with the drivetrain, however, as more than one editor complained of accelerator lag, primarily during standing starts. Kickdown response is also lacking; there’s a noticeable pause from the time you floor the gas pedal until the transmission drops a few gears for passing power. A Sport mode is included, and it helps enhance the drivetrain’s responsiveness by keeping the transmission in lower gears longer.\n\nDespite decent pedal feel, it’s difficult to come to a smooth stop in the X3. Whether it’s the fault of the automatic transmission stepping down through the gears or the crossover’s standard Brake Energy Regeneration system, the result is jerky stops.\n\nThe Inside\nThe X3’s redesigned interior continues the sparse, minimalistic design approach that BMW favors, but it does a better job of integrating the center screen, which serves as the display for the standard iDrive system.\n\nUnfortunately, the quality of the materials inside degrades the lower you look. While our test car was fitted with a nice-looking upper dashboard and classy optional wood trim, the center control panel was plain. As your eyes move down to the door pockets, you see they’re made of cheap-looking shiny plastic, complete with rough edges that say “economy car” more than “luxury crossover.”\n\nAnother aspect our editors panned was the X3’s optional leather upholstery, which lacks appropriate richness. In terms of cushioning and support, though, the front bucket seats are comfortable.\n\nIt’s nice to see the X3 bucks the trend of decreasing visibility that plagues many new cars. It has thin roof pillars and lots of glass, resulting in good all-around views.\n\nBackseat legroom is acceptable for adult passengers. The seat cushion, though, is too low to the floor, leading to a knees-up seating position that reduces thigh support. Unfortunately, the 60/40-split backrest doesn’t recline.\n\nSafety\nStandard safety features include antilock brakes, side curtain airbags, active head restraints for the front seats and an electronic stability system.\n\nFor a full list of safety features, visit the Standard Equipment & Specs page.\n\nX3 in the Market\nThe compact luxury crossover segment has undergone a revolution since the first-generation X3 debuted. Both the Q5 and GLK-Class have become popular sellers, while X3 sales have lagged behind.\n\nThe redesigned X3 puts BMW in position to retake some of the market thanks to its more forgiving ride. Despite some shortcomings, it’s still luxurious enough to cut it in this segment, and its more competitive starting price that’s about $2,000 less than the 2010 X3 won’t hurt, either.\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2021 BMW X3?\n\nThe BMW X3 is a five-seat compact luxury SUV. It’s offered with rear- or all-wheel drive, and power comes from a standard 248-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine. Available powertrains are a 288-hp plug-in hybrid; 382-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six; and 473-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six for the X3 M. All X3s have an eight-speed automatic transmission, and competitors include the Audi Q5, Mercedes-Benz GLC-Class and Volvo XC60.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2021 BMW X3?\n\nAndroid Auto smartphone connectivity joins Apple CarPlay, and satellite radio is also now standard. Newly standard active safety features include blind spot warning and lane departure warning. \n\nWhat Features in the 2021 BMW X3 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nForward collision warning \nLow-speed automatic emergency braking\nNavigation with a 10.25-inch touchscreen\nTri-zone automatic climate control\nPower liftgate\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nHeated and ventilated front seats \nHeated steering wheel\nPanoramic moonroof\nWireless device charging\nHarman Kardon surround-sound system\n360-degree camera system \nAdaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability\nShould I Buy the 2021 BMW X3?\n\nThe BMW X3 rides well and has a refined base four-cylinder engine, but it suffers from numb steering and modest cargo room. If you’re considering an X3, we’d recommend taking a look at BMW’s less expensive X1, too. It’s nearly as nice and has a roomy interior.",

      "expert_review": "Redesigned for 2018, the BMW X3 has standard all-wheel drive and comes in four-cylinder (xDrive30i) and six-cylinder (M40i) configurations. We drove a well-optioned X3 xDrive30i.\n\nCleaner Styling\n\nThe new X3 is decluttered versus the 2017 model, emulating the smaller X1 — a handsome place to start. Three bumper openings replace the prior four, with lighting elements in the outboard units instead of last year’s separate foglight dimples. Styling is subjective, of course, but I suspect this will age well — unlike the first- and second-generation X3s, which struck me as too busy-looking.\n\nExterior dimensions haven’t changed, but the wheelbase is 2.2 inches longer. Eighteen-inch alloy wheels, LED low-beam headlights and dual tailpipes are standard. So is dark lower cladding that brings a durable, go-anywhere look; that’s a check the BMW X3’s 8 inches of ground clearance should be able to cash. The M40i swaps that cladding for body-colored ground effects, though an optional M Sport Package on the xDrive30i emulates much of the look for less cash. You can also get adaptive headlights, LED high beams and wheels up to 21 inches.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nA poky eight-speed automatic transmission holds back an otherwise strong driving experience in the X3 xDrive30i, whose 2.0-liter turbo four-cylinder makes 248 horsepower and 258 pounds-feet of torque. It’s a capable engine with broad power that comes early and stays late. That’s much needed, as the transmission resists downshifts in its normal driving mode until you push the gas hard. (A Sport mode helps by holding lower gears longer, but it does so inconsistently.) But even absent a downshift, the xDrive30i has enough low-rpm muscle to maintain highway speed with multiple occupants aboard.\n\nThe SUV’s rear-drive roots reveal competent balance if you push it hard, but numb steering and modest body roll don’t encourage spirited driving. Sport mode shores up some of the body lean and relaxes power-steering assist to improve feedback through the turn, but the initial numbness remains. On the flip side, at least ride quality is strong. With its optional adaptive shock absorbers, our xDrive30i had a degree of sophistication that’s rare for this class — better than the unsorted Volvo XC60 and busy Lexus RX, and quieter on broken pavement than the Audi Q5.\n\nIf you want something more hardcore, the X3 M40i employs a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-6 (355 horsepower, 369 pounds-feet of torque). BMW says it hits 60 mph in a scant 4.6 seconds, versus 6 seconds flat for the xDrive30i. The M40i also gets higher-performance suspension tuning, plus a litany of hardware that’s optional on the xDrive30i: a performance steering ratio, upgraded brakes and AWD that sends more power to the outside wheels during corners. (Numb reflexes and all, our xDrive30i test car had those options.) Adaptive shock absorbers are also optional on the M40i.\n\nEPA-estimated fuel economy for the xDrive30i is 22/29/25 mpg (city/highway/combined), which is competitive with the class. Over some 360 miles of mostly highway driving, I hit the highway rating on the dot. The M40i sacrifices 2 mpg across the board. Like most German luxury models, all versions of the BMW X3 prefer premium gas. Competitors like the RX and Cadillac XT5 are less efficient but run fine on the cheap stuff. It’s a toss-up.\n\nThe Inside\n\nThe new X3’s cabin follows BMW’s norm, with a mashup of stacked controls below a tablet-like screen that floats above the center air vents. Storage provisions are good, and handsome materials adorn all eye-level areas, with an optional stitched vinyl wrap on upper sections of the dashboard and doors. Still, grainier finishes and unpadded surfaces sit below elbow level — on par with most competitors, though the Mercedes-Benz GLC-Class and XC60 feel a cut above.\n\nPower-adjustable front seats and vinyl upholstery, which BMW calls SensaTec, are standard. Leather is optional, as are heated and ventilated front seats and heated rear seats. The seats are comfortable overall, with good headroom in both rows despite our test car’s optional panoramic moonroof (a feature that typically cuts overhead space). Chunky grab handles on the front doors invade outboard knee space, and adults in back may find their knees uncomfortably elevated because the bench sits so low to the floor. Overall legroom in back is merely so-so.\n\nThe 40/20/40-split backseat reclines a few degrees but doesn’t slide. A power liftgate is standard, and BMW pegs cargo volume at 28.7 cubic feet behind the backseat and 62.7 cubic feet with the seats folded. We’ve found cargo specs unreliable, but BMW says it measured the X3 in apples-to-apples fashion with its other SUVs. At minimum, that suggests cargo volume closer to that of the X1 (27.1 cubic feet behind the rear seats; 58.7 cubic feet with the seats folded) than the X5 (35.8 and 76.7 cubic feet).\n\nHD radio, Bluetooth and a 6.5-inch display with a backup camera — but not a touchscreen — is standard. Some more premium package options include a 10.3-inch display that works via touchscreen or BMW’s iDrive system controls. You can also get wireless Apple CarPlay, BMW’s newfangled gesture control, a 12.3-inch digital instrument panel, LTE in-car Wi-Fi and a bevy of device compatibility (smartphone and smartwatch apps, plus Amazon Echo integration). Despite all this, Android Auto is unavailable.\n\nThe X3 has yet to be crash-tested, but forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking remains optional, not standard. That’s an important safety provision that’s widely standard in the class; it’s even standard on a $16,530 Toyota Yaris. BMW needs to get with the program. Other options run the semi-autonomous gamut, from lane-centering steering to adaptive cruise control. Both systems can work all the way down to a stop, though the steering feature requires periodic driver inputs; it isn’t hands-free like Cadillac’s Super Cruise.\n\nVersus the Alternatives\n\nShopping the X3 M40i? Have at it. We haven’t driven the high-performance X3, which starts in the mid-$50,000s and runs to about $70,000 with all options; it gives enthusiasts an alternative to the Audi SQ5, Mercedes-AMG GLC43 and others of that ilk.\n\nBut I suspect most X3 shoppers want the xDrive30i, which accounts for some 85 percent of the 2018 model-year X3 inventory on Cars.com as of this writing. It starts around $43,500 and tops out in the low $60,000s with a full slate of factory options. That’s in line with competing, base-engine luxury SUVs. Just look around the showroom first.\n\nThe X1 runs from the mid-$30,000s with similar standard features (albeit optional AWD) to the low $50,000s with a slew of options. Luxury cars have a way of playing up the numbers, but the X3 is not automatically better. Its smaller sibling gives up some front-seat comfort but repays it in back, with a higher seating position plus an optional reclining and sliding backseat. Cargo space and acceleration are comparable, as is cabin quality. The X1 rides notably firmer with no handling payoff to show for it — its weakest point, to be sure, but something I doubt will rankle many SUV drivers in practice.\n\nSeldom does a class beg you to upgrade more than subcompact SUVs do. They seem to want you to opt for their larger, compact siblings — even among luxury brands. The X1 is the exception. It’s a remarkable SUV in an unremarkable class, and it gives X3 shoppers a compelling alternative at substantial savings.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Redesigned for 2018, the BMW X3 has standard all-wheel drive and comes in four-cylinder (xDrive30i) and six-cylinder (M40i) configurations. We drove a well-optioned X3 xDrive30i.\n\nCleaner Styling\n\nThe new X3 is decluttered versus the 2017 model, emulating the smaller X1 — a handsome place to start. Three bumper openings replace the prior four, with lighting elements in the outboard units instead of last year’s separate foglight dimples. Styling is subjective, of course, but I suspect this will age well — unlike the first- and second-generation X3s, which struck me as too busy-looking.\n\nExterior dimensions haven’t changed, but the wheelbase is 2.2 inches longer. Eighteen-inch alloy wheels, LED low-beam headlights and dual tailpipes are standard. So is dark lower cladding that brings a durable, go-anywhere look; that’s a check the BMW X3’s 8 inches of ground clearance should be able to cash. The M40i swaps that cladding for body-colored ground effects, though an optional M Sport Package on the xDrive30i emulates much of the look for less cash. You can also get adaptive headlights, LED high beams and wheels up to 21 inches.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nA poky eight-speed automatic transmission holds back an otherwise strong driving experience in the X3 xDrive30i, whose 2.0-liter turbo four-cylinder makes 248 horsepower and 258 pounds-feet of torque. It’s a capable engine with broad power that comes early and stays late. That’s much needed, as the transmission resists downshifts in its normal driving mode until you push the gas hard. (A Sport mode helps by holding lower gears longer, but it does so inconsistently.) But even absent a downshift, the xDrive30i has enough low-rpm muscle to maintain highway speed with multiple occupants aboard.\n\nThe SUV’s rear-drive roots reveal competent balance if you push it hard, but numb steering and modest body roll don’t encourage spirited driving. Sport mode shores up some of the body lean and relaxes power-steering assist to improve feedback through the turn, but the initial numbness remains. On the flip side, at least ride quality is strong. With its optional adaptive shock absorbers, our xDrive30i had a degree of sophistication that’s rare for this class — better than the unsorted Volvo XC60 and busy Lexus RX, and quieter on broken pavement than the Audi Q5.\n\nIf you want something more hardcore, the X3 M40i employs a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-6 (355 horsepower, 369 pounds-feet of torque). BMW says it hits 60 mph in a scant 4.6 seconds, versus 6 seconds flat for the xDrive30i. The M40i also gets higher-performance suspension tuning, plus a litany of hardware that’s optional on the xDrive30i: a performance steering ratio, upgraded brakes and AWD that sends more power to the outside wheels during corners. (Numb reflexes and all, our xDrive30i test car had those options.) Adaptive shock absorbers are also optional on the M40i.\n\nEPA-estimated fuel economy for the xDrive30i is 22/29/25 mpg (city/highway/combined), which is competitive with the class. Over some 360 miles of mostly highway driving, I hit the highway rating on the dot. The M40i sacrifices 2 mpg across the board. Like most German luxury models, all versions of the BMW X3 prefer premium gas. Competitors like the RX and Cadillac XT5 are less efficient but run fine on the cheap stuff. It’s a toss-up.\n\nThe Inside\n\nThe new X3’s cabin follows BMW’s norm, with a mashup of stacked controls below a tablet-like screen that floats above the center air vents. Storage provisions are good, and handsome materials adorn all eye-level areas, with an optional stitched vinyl wrap on upper sections of the dashboard and doors. Still, grainier finishes and unpadded surfaces sit below elbow level — on par with most competitors, though the Mercedes-Benz GLC-Class and XC60 feel a cut above.\n\nPower-adjustable front seats and vinyl upholstery, which BMW calls SensaTec, are standard. Leather is optional, as are heated and ventilated front seats and heated rear seats. The seats are comfortable overall, with good headroom in both rows despite our test car’s optional panoramic moonroof (a feature that typically cuts overhead space). Chunky grab handles on the front doors invade outboard knee space, and adults in back may find their knees uncomfortably elevated because the bench sits so low to the floor. Overall legroom in back is merely so-so.\n\nThe 40/20/40-split backseat reclines a few degrees but doesn’t slide. A power liftgate is standard, and BMW pegs cargo volume at 28.7 cubic feet behind the backseat and 62.7 cubic feet with the seats folded. We’ve found cargo specs unreliable, but BMW says it measured the X3 in apples-to-apples fashion with its other SUVs. At minimum, that suggests cargo volume closer to that of the X1 (27.1 cubic feet behind the rear seats; 58.7 cubic feet with the seats folded) than the X5 (35.8 and 76.7 cubic feet).\n\nHD radio, Bluetooth and a 6.5-inch display with a backup camera — but not a touchscreen — is standard. Some more premium package options include a 10.3-inch display that works via touchscreen or BMW’s iDrive system controls. You can also get wireless Apple CarPlay, BMW’s newfangled gesture control, a 12.3-inch digital instrument panel, LTE in-car Wi-Fi and a bevy of device compatibility (smartphone and smartwatch apps, plus Amazon Echo integration). Despite all this, Android Auto is unavailable.\n\nThe X3 has yet to be crash-tested, but forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking remains optional, not standard. That’s an important safety provision that’s widely standard in the class; it’s even standard on a $16,530 Toyota Yaris. BMW needs to get with the program. Other options run the semi-autonomous gamut, from lane-centering steering to adaptive cruise control. Both systems can work all the way down to a stop, though the steering feature requires periodic driver inputs; it isn’t hands-free like Cadillac’s Super Cruise.\n\nVersus the Alternatives\n\nShopping the X3 M40i? Have at it. We haven’t driven the high-performance X3, which starts in the mid-$50,000s and runs to about $70,000 with all options; it gives enthusiasts an alternative to the Audi SQ5, Mercedes-AMG GLC43 and others of that ilk.\n\nBut I suspect most X3 shoppers want the xDrive30i, which accounts for some 85 percent of the 2018 model-year X3 inventory on Cars.com as of this writing. It starts around $43,500 and tops out in the low $60,000s with a full slate of factory options. That’s in line with competing, base-engine luxury SUVs. Just look around the showroom first.\n\nThe X1 runs from the mid-$30,000s with similar standard features (albeit optional AWD) to the low $50,000s with a slew of options. Luxury cars have a way of playing up the numbers, but the X3 is not automatically better. Its smaller sibling gives up some front-seat comfort but repays it in back, with a higher seating position plus an optional reclining and sliding backseat. Cargo space and acceleration are comparable, as is cabin quality. The X1 rides notably firmer with no handling payoff to show for it — its weakest point, to be sure, but something I doubt will rankle many SUV drivers in practice.\n\nSeldom does a class beg you to upgrade more than subcompact SUVs do. They seem to want you to opt for their larger, compact siblings — even among luxury brands. The X1 is the exception. It’s a remarkable SUV in an unremarkable class, and it gives X3 shoppers a compelling alternative at substantial savings.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe BMW X3 was last redesigned for 2011. Some visual changes join significant interior updates, particularly among the dashboard’s center controls. But the biggest news may be the diesel X3 xDrive28d, which is the first time we’ve seen a diesel X3 in the U.S. There’s also a new rear-wheel-drive version of the four-cylinder gasoline X3, called the sDrive28i.\nExteriorThe most significant styling change comes to the X3’s headlights. They adopt a similar framework to the larger X5’s headlights. BMW says the front and rear bumpers are new, as are the headlights, grille and side mirrors. LED headlights are optional.\nBMW says overall length has grown just 1 centimeter. A new xLine Package adds metallic bumper inserts, aluminum side cladding, bars across the air intakes and more underbody work in the front and rear. An M Sport Package, meanwhile, adds some aerodynamic enhancements and 19- or 20-inch alloy wheels.\nIn back, BMW’s new Smart Opener allows you to wave your foot under the bumper to open the power tailgate, similar to a feature in the Ford Escape.\nInteriorThe redesigned center controls feature BMW’s black-panel display with a dark finish and illuminated icons. BMW’s latest iDrive controller governs the action on a 6.5- inch dashboard display.\nThe five-seat interior has 27.6 cubic feet of cargo room, with 63.3 cubic feet available with the seats folded down. That beats the Mercedes-Benz GLK-Class and the Audi Q5, though only with the rear seats folded, but the Lexus RX still rules the roost with 40 and 80.3 cubic feet with the rear seats up and down, respectively.\nUnder the HoodThe diesel xDrive28d employs a turbocharged diesel four-cylinder that makes 180 horsepower and 280 pounds-feet of torque. The sDrive28i and xDrive28i have a turbo 2.0-liter gasoline four-cylinder with 240 hp and 260 pounds-feet of torque, while the xDrive35i’s turbo 3.0-liter six-cylinder makes 300 hp and 300 pounds-feet of torque. The X3’s eight-speed automatic transmission includes paddle shifters in M Sport versions. A drivetrain controller includes an Eco Pro mode, which purports to improve real-world gas mileage.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 BMW X3?\n\nThe BMW X3 is a five-seat luxury compact SUV that’s offered with a range of engine choices: The sDrive30i and xDrive30i are powered by a 248-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder, while the M40i gets a 382-hp, turbo 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder with a 48-volt mild-hybrid system. The high-performance X3 M, meanwhile, boasts track-focused features and has a turbo 3.0-liter inline-six that makes 473 hp (X3 M) or 503 hp (X3 M Competition). The sDrive30i is rear-wheel drive, but all of the others come standard with all-wheel drive. All X3s have an eight-speed automatic transmission, and competitors include the Audi Q5, Mercedes-Benz GLC and Volvo XC60.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 BMW X3?\n\nAfter a refresh for 2022, the X3 sees only minor changes to feature availability this year. \n\nWhat Features in the 2023 BMW X3 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nForward collision warning \nLow-speed automatic emergency braking\nNavigation with 10.25-inch touchscreen\nTri-zone automatic climate control\nPower liftgate\nKeyless entry system \n\nAvailable features include:\n\nHeated and ventilated front seats \nHeated steering wheel\nPanoramic moonroof\nWireless device charging\nHarman Kardon surround-sound system\n360-degree camera system \nAdaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability\n12.3-inch digital instrument panel\n12.3-inch touchscreen display \nM Sport Package \nShould I Buy the 2023 BMW X3?\n\nThe BMW X3 offers a sporty-yet-composed ride, good passenger space and an impressive lineup of refined engines. It’s a better value than many BMWs, though adding items from the long list of tempting available features drives up the price. Cargo room could be better and some rivals offer posher interiors, but the X3 is still a fine competitor in its class.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 BMW X3?\n\nThe BMW X3 is a five-seat compact luxury SUV that’s offered with a range of engine choices: The sDrive30i and xDrive30i are powered by a 248-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder, while the M40i gets a 382-hp, turbo 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder with a 48-volt mild-hybrid system. The high-performance X3 M, meanwhile, boasts track-focused features and has a turbo 3.0-liter inline-six that makes 473 hp (X3 M) or 503 hp (X3 M Competition). The sDrive30i is rear-wheel drive, but all other versions come standard with all-wheel drive. All X3s have an eight-speed automatic transmission, and competitors include the Volvo XC60, Mercedes-Benz GLC-Class and Audi Q5.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 BMW X3?\n\nThe X3 was refreshed for 2022 and sees no notable changes this year.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 BMW X3 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nForward collision warning\nLow-speed automatic emergency braking\nNavigation with 10.25-inch touchscreen\nTri-zone automatic climate control\nPower liftgate\nKeyless entry system\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nPanoramic moonroof\nWireless device charging\nHarman Kardon surround-sound system\n360-degree camera system\nAdaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability\n12.3-inch digital instrument panel\n12.3-inch touchscreen display\nM Sport Package\nShould I Buy the 2024 BMW X3?\n\nThe BMW X3 offers a sporty yet composed ride, good passenger space and an impressive lineup of refined engines. It’s a better value than many BMWs, though adding items from the long list of tempting available features drives up the price. Cargo room could be better, and some rivals offer posher interiors, but the X3 is a fine competitor in its class.",

      "expert_review": "Looks like: The current X3 with some minor tweaks\n\nCompetes with: Alfa Romeo Stelvio, Audi Q5, Genesis GV70, Lexus RX, Mercedes-Benz GLC, Volvo XC60\n\nPowertrains: 248-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder (sDrive30i, xDrive30i); 382-hp, turbo 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder with 48-volt mild hybrid (M40i); 473- (X3 M) or 503-hp (X3 M Competition), turbo 3.0-liter inline-six; rear- (sDrive30i) or all-wheel (xDrive30i, M40i, X3 M) drive; eight-speed automatic transmission\n\nHits dealerships: September\n\nBMW’s compact X3 SUV will gain several subtle but significant updates for the 2022 model year, including a lightly revised appearance. The new look is so similar, in fact, that it’s difficult to tell it apart from the 2021 version without looking at them side by side. The most significant change is the inclusion of a 48-volt mild-hybrid system on the six-cylinder M40i. The rest of the updates include more advanced standard and available technology and a few extra standard safety features.\n\nRelated: 2022 BMW iX xDrive50: A Smartphone on Wheels\n\nExterior\n\nUp front, the headlights are 0.4 inch thinner, according to BMW, while the signature kidney grille gets a new one-piece frame and is larger, though not of the gaping proportions of the redesigned 4 Series or recently announced all-electric iX. In back, wider exhaust cutouts give the X3 a sportier appearance, and the LED taillights with integrated turn signals have a redesigned “pincer claw” look with a black surround.\n\nNew, more aerodynamic black 19-inch wheels can be equipped for improved fuel efficiency, and an optional M Sport Package makes the SUV look more aggressive with features like larger front air intakes. The optional Shadowline Package adds dark exterior accents.\n\nThe more powerful six-cylinder M40i gets an M-specific grille design, side mirrors and 19-inch wheels, with 20s and 21s optional.\n\nInterior, Tech Updates\n\nFor 2022, the X3 borrows its cockpit design from the latest 4 Series, using a standard 10.25-inch touchscreen display. The optional Live Cockpit Professional adds a 12.3-inch digital instrument panel and ups the touchscreen display to 12.3 inches, as well. The new center console’s control layout mimics the current 3 Series.\n\nInterior technology has also been updated with iDrive 7, the latest version of BMW’s multimedia software. Enhanced built-in navigation includes improved arrival prediction times, more traffic updates for smaller roads and an improved ability to find available parking near a destination. The BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant — activated either by a button or by saying, “Hey, BMW” — now has greater functionality, including being able to change the driving modes, open or close the windows, or regulate the air conditioning.\n\nThe 2022 X3 will also support over-the-air updates for future improvements.\n\nMild Hybridization\n\nNew for 2022, six-cylinder M40i models have 48-volt mild-hybrid systems for improved efficiency and an on-demand 11 horsepower to assist the six-cylinder’s 382 hp, which also delivers 369 pounds-feet of torque. BMW has yet to release any fuel economy estimates, however. With standard all-wheel drive, BMW says the M40i goes from 0-60 mph in 4.4 seconds.\n\nThe X3 M40i also gets a standard performance exhaust system and adaptive suspension, and its AWD system is tuned to provide more power to the rear wheels for a sportier feel.\n\nThe rear-wheel-drive sDrive30i and all-wheel-drive xDrive30i use BMW’s turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, producing 248 hp and 258 pounds-feet of torque. Both versions do the 0-60 sprint in 6.0 seconds, according to BMW. All versions of the X3 use an eight-speed automatic transmission.\n\nAn optional Dynamic Handling Package adds variable-ratio steering along with BMW’s Dynamic Damper Control and M Sport brakes. X3s with the M Sport Package also get a feature called Performance Control, which — like in the M40i — can deliver more power to the rear wheels for sportier driving characteristics.\n\nMore Torque for X3 M, M Competition\n2022 BMW X3 M Competition (European model shown) | Manufacturer image\n\nThe true M versions of the X3, the X3 M and M Competition, receive much of the same design and technology updates as the more vanilla 2022 X3. The big news for performance SUV fans comes in the form of revised engine tuning, which ups the torque figure for the X3 M from 442 pounds-feet to 457, while the M Competition’s torque increases 37 pounds-feet to 479. Horsepower remains unchanged at 473 for the X3 M and 503 for the M Competition.\n\nWith the added twist, BMW says the X3 M’s 0-60 mph time drops from 4.1 to 3.9 seconds, while the M Competition’s drops from 4.0 to 3.7 seconds.\n\nSome Standard Safety Tech\n\nThe X3 comes standard with some advanced safety features, including forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking and pedestrian and cyclist detection, lane departure warning and blind spot warning.
