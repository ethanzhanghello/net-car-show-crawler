      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nBMW’s flagship 7 Series is a full-size luxury sedan that competes with top-line luxury cars like the Audi A8, Jaguar XJ and Mercedes-Benz S-Class. The V-8-powered 750 comes in regular and extended lengths with rear- or all-wheel drive. The luxury sedan is available with four or five seats, and there’s also a six-cylinder 740 as well as a V-12 760, an ActiveHybrid 750 and a performance-oriented Alpina B7.\n\nNew for 2012\nAll models add a standard iPod/USB adapter, sport steering wheel and a backup camera. V-8 models gain 19-inch wheels with all-season tires and a premium stereo.  In a cost-cutting move, the ActiveHybrid 750 loses its standard leather dashboard, head-up display, and active and ventilated front seats.\n\nExterior\nThe current 7 Series adopts more conservative styling than its predecessor. It’s also a bit larger. The optional M Sport Package augments the exterior with more aggressive lower bodywork and darker Shadowline door and window trim. Exterior features include:\n\n\nExtended-length versions are 5.5 inches longer\nAluminum roof, doors, hood and front fenders for decreased weight\nOptional high-beam assist automatically dims high beams for oncoming drivers\nStandard xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights\nStandard adaptive headlights move with steering wheel\n18-inch wheels\nOptional 19- or 20-inch wheels\n21-inch wheels (Alpina B7)\n\nInterior\nAn array of entertainment and comfort features is available. BMW’s iDrive system, which controls the navigation system, stereo, climate control and other functions, was revised in recent years to make it more user-friendly. Interior features include:\n\n\n10.2-inch dashboard screen for iDrive\nFour-zone climate control, including independent control for rear passengers\nOptional rear massaging and ventilated seats\nOptional rear entertainment system with dual screens in head restraints\nOptional head-up display\nOptional night vision with pedestrian detection\n\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe engine lineup includes a 315-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder for the 740; a 4.4-liter V-8 for the 750, Alpina B7 and ActiveHybrid models; and a 6.0-liter V-12 with 535 hp for the 760. The V-8 produces 400 hp in the 750, 440 hp in the ActiveHybrid 750 and 500 hp in the Alpina B7. All engines have twin turbochargers. The ActiveHybrid 750 has lithium-ion batteries, which power an electric motor that assists the V-8 during acceleration.\n\nThe 750 and Alpina B7 are available with rear- or xDrive all-wheel drive. xDrive can send up to 80 percent of power to the rear wheels if needed, keeping acceleration and handling traits similar to those of the rear-wheel-drive 7 Series. Mechanical features include:\n\n\nSix-speed automatic transmission (six-cylinder and V-8 models)\nEight-speed automatic transmission (ActiveHybrid 750 and V-12)\nRear- or all-wheel drive\n\n\nSafety\nSafety features include:\n\n\nStandard side curtain airbags\nStandard front-seat side-impact airbags\nStandard knee airbags\nStandard electronic stability system\nOptional lane departure warning system\nOptional blind spot monitoring system",

      "expert_review": "CORNWALL, N.Y. Luxury has a conscience. It can be found in the 2011 BMW ActiveHybrid7 — a gas-and-electric version of the BMW 750i sedan.\n\nBut it is not conscience with humility. The ActiveHybrid7, in the words of its maker, is “the world’s fastest street-legal . . . most luxurious and dynamic hybrid.”\n\nAll of which means you’ll pay dearly to get it. The gasoline-only version of the 750i starts at $82,000. The ActiveHybrid7 model carries a base price of $102,300.\n\nThe price differential automatically makes something clear: Anyone with the wherewithal and will to pay a $20,000 premium for the privilege of driving a hybrid automobile isn’t doing it to spend less on gasoline. Nor is that buyer overwhelmingly concerned about the environment.\n\nPeople who want hybrid cars strictly for reasons of fuel conservation and environmental purity should buy the world’s most revered symbol of motorized piety, the compact Toyota Prius, which starts at $22,800 in the United States.\n\nBut not everyone wants a Prius. Nor does everyone want to take a vow of poverty or work for nonprofit organizations, environmental or otherwise. Charity requires benefactors — the bigger the charity, the richer the benefactors.\n\nBMW made the ActiveHybrid7 for wealthy benefactors. Think of this car as the motorized equivalent of an expensive charity ball, given by the swells of the community for the greater good of all.\n\nOnly a few people can afford to attend the ball. But the few who arrive in an ActiveHybrid7 will do so in guilt-free, or at least propitious, luxury.\n\nIt’s a bauble. But, like it or not, the ActiveHybrid7 works wonderfully well.\n\nBMW has trumped its rivals in the hybrid-car business by using a lithium-ion battery pack, which has a higher energy density than the commonly used nickel-metal-hydride type. Higher energy density means more charge for the buck in a smaller package, which BMW, in this case, has cleverly located in the northwest corner of the ActiveHybrid7’s trunk.\n\nThe battery energizes an electric motor (15-kilowatt, 20 horsepower equivalent) that works in tandem with a 4.4-liter twin-turbocharged V-8 engine (455 horsepower, 515 foot-pounds of torque).\n\nThe arrangement saves fuel and reduces tailpipe pollution in city traffic when the gasoline motor shuts down at stoplights and other traffic interruptions and the battery and electric motor take over.\n\nBut the two power systems work together on the highway, providing a tremendous boost in acceleration, beating the heck out of many full-size gas-guzzling sedans and wearing something of an environmental halo in the process.\n\nWith it all comes BMW 7-Series comfort, elegance and opulence — four-zone climate control, a leather-wrapped steering wheel with plush leather seats, rich wood-grain accents, ambient interior lighting for night driving, onboard navigation with a high-definition backup camera, and myriad active and passive safety technologies.\n\nIt’s the perfect answer for wealthy car shoppers who want to keep everything, including the esteem of their more environmentally righteous fellows.\n\nIs it worth it? Does it make sense? I think so. It carries similar value and makes as much sense as one of those fancy black-tie charity balls. What charitable or public interest organization can exist without them?\n\nBrown is a special correspondent.",
