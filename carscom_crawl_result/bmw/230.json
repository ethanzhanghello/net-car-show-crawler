      "expert_review": "Looks like: A more aggressive take on the outgoing 2 Series Coupe\n\nCompetes with: Audi TT, Nissan Z, Toyota Supra \n\nPowertrains: 255-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder (230i) or 382-hp, 3.0-liter six-cylinder (M240i); eight-speed automatic transmission\n\nHits dealerships: November\n\nBMW’s entry-level 2 Series Coupe enters its second generation with styling, performance, and tech upgrades aimed to seduce the driving enthusiast. However, the omission of a manual transmission for the 2022 BMW 230i and its higher-performance variant, the M240i, will undoubtedly deal a blow for enthusiasts who wish to row their own gears.\n\nRelated: 2022 BMW X3 Lineup Adds Electrification, Torque, Technology\n\nDrivers considering the 2 Series Coupe for 2022 will find a more aggressive and functional exterior, improved safety tech and more powerful engine options. (They’ll also still find a rear-drive-based platform — distinct from the front-drive-based 2 Series Gran Coupe, a relative by name only.) What they’ll no longer find is a six-speed manual transmission, but BMW made similar moves in recent years with the redesigned 3 Series and 4 Series, only to return three-pedal driving to the related M3 and M4. Stay tuned to see if that occurs with a reprised M2, which — if it came — would slot above the M240i.\n\nPerformance-Minded Exterior\n\nExterior changes to the 2 Series Coupe aim to enhance the model’s performance.  Both variations add 2.6 inches of width and increased tracks on both axles to improve cornering. Wheelbase grows a couple of inches, with overall length up roughly 4 inches. The 230i drops a full inch of height, while the M240i stays roughly even with its predecessor. \n\nIf the hood-to-ground grille on the new 4 Series seemed a bit much, you can exhale: The 2 Series retains a tidier arrangement that stays more with BMW tradition. That said, the 2 Series Coupes flaunts a new front end, with an updated grille that employs motorized air flaps in BMW’s iconic kidney framework to reprise the vertical bars from before. The electrically operated flaps can open in 10 stages to increase engine cooling. Horizontal cooling flaps on the lower front bumper operate in a similar fashion to help cool the brakes, while air curtains situated in triangular bumper inserts can guide air over the wheels for improved aerodynamics. \n\n2022 BMW 2 Series Coupe grille | Manufacturer image\n\nBMW distinguishes the M240i with an aggressive bumper that sports larger outboard openings, plus reshaped exhaust tips and some unique trim pieces. High-gloss trim on the rear bumper and black diffuser further set the M variant apart. Drivers that want edgier styling for the BMW 230i can opt for one of two M Sport packages to add visual tweaks more in line with the M240i, plus higher-performance brakes. Eighteen-inch alloy wheels are standard, with 19-inchers available.\n\nUpdated Chassis and Engines\n\nBMW claims the new 2 Series gains added control and comfort on long-distance drives. An optional M Sport suspension offers a firmer ride, while the Adaptive M suspension, which comes standard in the BMW M240i xDrive Coupe, adds adaptive shock absorbers.\n\nThe new 230i Coupe is powered by BMW’s updated turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, which makes 255 horsepower and 295 pounds-feet of torque; that’s up 7 hp and 37 pounds-feet over the 2021 230i. Even with the higher power and torque outputs, the 230i Coupe with RWD hits 60 mph in 5.5 seconds, which is a fraction slower than the outgoing model’s 5.3 seconds. \n\nIn the M240i, a more powerful turbocharged 3.0-liter six-cylinder produces 382 hp and 369 pounds-feet of torque (an increase of 47 horses and 1 pound-foot over the previous model). BMW says the all-wheel-drive M240i hits 60 mph in 4.1 seconds, just a hair quicker than the 2021 model’s 4.2 seconds.\n\nNo More Manual\n\nWhile the first generation of the 2 Series coupe came with an available six-speed manual in both the 230i and M240i, BMW dropped this option for the redesigned 2 Series. The new coupes come standard with an eight-speed automatic transmission, which the automaker claims has been updated for sharper shifts, improved efficiency and faster, smoother operation.\n\nBoth the 230i and M240i Coupes will be configurable with rear-wheel drive or BMW’s xDrive all-wheel drive, though the 230i will come initially with RWD and the M240i with AWD. (A rear-drive M240i and AWD 230i will be available later, BMW says.) The M240i has an M Sport rear differential to optimize power distribution and improve handling. \n\nInterior and Tech\n\nInside the 2022 2 Series is a new, driver-focused cockpit. Both 2 Series coupes come with standard sport seats; an optional moonroof is 20% larger than that of the outgoing model. \n\nImproved safety and convenience technology can be found in what BMW calls a more precise lane departure warning system with lane keep assist, as well as a blind spot warning system and head-up display; the HUD is a first for the 2 Series Coupe. These features join BMW’s forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking and rear cross-traffic alert. \n\nThe 2 Series Coupe comes with BMW’s iDrive 7 system, which has a standard 8.8-inch touchscreen. A larger 10.25-inch touchscreen is optional, as are 12.3-inch digital gauges in place of physical gauges and a 5.1-inch display. Also standard is navigation, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay integration, and a phone-as-key function for iPhone users.\n\nPricing and Release Date\n2022 BMW 2 Series Coupe | Manufacturer image\n\nThe BMW 2 Series hits dealerships in November, with the rear-drive 230i and the all-wheel-drive M240i xDrive Coupes launching first, followed by the AWD 230i xDrive and RWD M240i. Including a $995 destination fee, the 2022 BMW 230i Coupe starts at $37,345, while the M240i xDrive Coupe starts at $49,545.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nWhat’s New for BMW in 2021?\n2021 BMW M3 and M4: M Stands for Manual\n2021 BMW 4 Series: More Power, More Tech, More Grille, Just … More on the 4\nBMW Software Updates Will Enable Owners to Add Options After Purchase\nBMW First to Let You Unlock, Start Your Car With iPhone Digital Key\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 BMW 2 Series?\n\nThe BMW 2 Series is a small, sporty luxury coupe available with a choice of three engines. Powering the base 230i is a 255-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder, while the energetic M240i is equipped with a 382-hp, turbo 3.0-liter inline-six. Both engines are coupled with an eight-speed automatic transmission and rear- or all-wheel drive. Sorry, BMW fans: If you want a manual gearbox, you’ll have to pony up for the pricey super-performance M2 version. That car has a 473-hp, twin-turbo six-cylinder, standard AWD, and a six-speed manual or eight-speed automatic transmission. The 2 Series’ competitors include the Toyota GR Supra, Lexus RC and Nissan Z.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 BMW 2 Series?\n\nFor 2025, the 2 Series lineup gets BMW’s latest infotainment software and the brand’s Curved Display, which melds a 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster and 14.9-inch central display into one seamless, curved screen. All trims also receive new steering wheels, along with new paint colors and interior and exterior trim updates. The 2025 M2’s 473-hp rating is a 20-hp bump over the 2024 version. \n\nWhat Features in the 2025 BMW 2 Series Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n12.3-inch digital instrument panel\n14.9-inch infotainment touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto \nNavigation\nWi-Fi hot spot\nDual-zone climate control\nTwo USB ports\nPower-adjustable front seats\nLane departure steering assist\nLane departure warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nBlind spot warning\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nSix-speed manual transmission (M2)\nMoonroof\nInterior ambient lighting\nHeated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nHead-up instrument display\nHands-free park assist\n360-degree camera system \nWireless device charging\n16-speaker Harman Kardon audio system\nShould I Buy the 2025 BMW 2 Series?\n\nThe 2 Series is the type of BMW that enthusiast drivers love. It’s small and agile, wonderfully quick (even with its base engine) and has a firm ride that inspires confidence in spirited driving. Optional AWD provides added grip when Mother Nature doesn’t want to cooperate. The 2 Series’ small trunk and tiny backseat are expected in such a pert coupe, but we wish the exhaust note were more aggressive across the range — even in the tire-smoking M2. The steering also exhibits a degree of numbness that’s surprising in such a sporty vehicle.",

      "expert_review": "The 2023 BMW 2 Series received a major redesign for 2022, so the German luxury automaker is making only minor changes to the compact coupe for 2023 and bumping up the price slightly to $39,195 (all pricing includes a $995 destination charge).\n\nRelated: 2022 BMW M240i Review: BMW’s Tiniest Grand Tourer\n\nThe 2023 2 Series’ exterior styling carries over largely unchanged. However, all 2023 variants now get BMW’s curved gauge cluster as standard equipment. The remainder of the updates are defined by trim-option deletions for the 230i; Satin Aluminum exterior trim and Black High Gloss interior trim are no longer available. The M2 was fully redesigned for the 2023 model year; details can be found here.\n\nPerformance for the 2023 BMW 2 Series is also mostly unchanged, with the base 230i being powered by a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that makes 255 horsepower. The M240i gets a 382-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six; the 228i xDrive Gran Coupe comes with a 228-hp, turbo 2.0-liter inline-four; the M235i xDrive Gran Coupe has a turbo 2.0-liter inline-four that makes 301 hp; and the range-topping M2 now has a 453-hp, twin-turbo inline-six. An eight-speed automatic is the lone transmission for most of the lineup; the M2 comes with a standard six-speed manual and has the automatic transmission available.\n\nPricing and Release Date\n\nThe 2023 BMW 2 Series is available now. Rear-wheel drive is standard, and optional all-wheel drive adds $2,000; the M2 is RWD only. Full pricing is below:\n\n230i: $39,195\n228i Gran Coupe: $38,795\nM235i xDrive Gran Coupe: $48,595\nM240i: $50,095\nM2: $63,195\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nRedesigned 2023 BMW M2: The Smallest M Scores Big HP Boost\n2020 BMW 228 Gran Coupe Review: Little, and of Little Point\n2020 BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe Poised to Take on Mercedes CLA\n2022 BMW 2 Series Coupe Gains Power, Loses Manual\n2020 BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe: 5 Things We Like, 6 Things We Don’t\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 BMW 2 Series?\n\nThe BMW 2 Series is a small, sporty luxury coupe available with a choice of three engines. Powering the base 230i is a 255-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder, while the energetic M240i is equipped with a 382-hp, turbo 3.0-liter inline-six. Both engines are coupled with an eight-speed automatic transmission and rear- or all-wheel drive. Sorry, BMW fans: If you want a manual gearbox, you’ll have to pony up for the pricey performance M2 version that has a 453-hp, twin-turbo six-cylinder, standard AWD, and a six-speed manual or eight-speed automatic transmission. The 2 Series’ competitors include the Lexus RC, Nissan Z and Toyota Supra.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 BMW 2 Series?\n\nThe 2 Series lineup enters the 2024 model year with no notable changes or updates. \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 BMW 2 Series Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n12.3-inch digital instrument panel\n8.8-inch infotainment display\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto \nNavigation\nWi-Fi hot spot\nDual-zone climate control\nTwo USB ports\nPower-adjustable front seats\nLane departure steering assist\nLane departure warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nBlind spot warning\n\nAvailable features include: \n\n10.3-inch infotainment display\nSix-speed manual transmission (M2)\nMoonroof\nInterior ambient lighting\nHeated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nHead-up instrument display\nHands-free park assist\n360-degree camera system\nWireless device charging\n16-speaker Harman Kardon audio system\nShould I Buy the 2024 BMW 2 Series?\n\nThe 2 Series is the type of BMW that enthusiast drivers love. It’s small and agile, wonderfully quick (even with its base engine) and has a firm ride that inspires confidence in spirited driving. Optional AWD provides added grip when Mother Nature doesn’t want to cooperate. The 2 Series’ small trunk and tiny backseat are expected in such a pert coupe, but we wish the exhaust note were more aggressive across the range, including the tire-smoking M2. The steering also exhibits a degree of numbness that’s surprising in such a sporty vehicle.",

      "expert_review": "BMW's smallest series of vehicles gets a small set of updates for the 2018 model year. Each member of the 2 Series is receiving slightly tweaked exterior styling and updated interiors with new technology and materials.\n\n\nThe 2 Series will continue to be sold in both coupe and convertible body styles in two models: 230i, M240i. The performance-oriented M2 is coupe-only.\n\n \n\nExterior\nExterior changes in this update are few, but BMW says each of the 2 Series models adds LED headlights and three new paint colors, along with updated wheel designs. The general aesthetic remains intact, with a long hood and short deck lid, which makes the passenger area appear to be pushed toward the rear of the vehicle.\n\nInterior\nMost of the updates to the 2018 2 Series are found inside, where BMW has redesigned the instrument panel and installed the latest version of its multimedia system, iDrive 6.0. A 6.6-inch display is standard, with a larger 8.8-inch touchscreen as an option.\n\nAlso on the technology side, the 2 Series offers a few handy features, including the On-Street Parking Information service to guess where open parking spaces will be along your route. Wireless charging is optional and the 2 Series will also offer wireless integration of Apple CarPlay.\n\nThe BMW Connected app will be more helpful on the navigation front, sending addresses to the vehicle and even syncing with your calendar to let the driver know ideal departure times for appointments based on real-time traffic data.\n\nUnder the Hood\nEach of the three 2 Series models features a different engine, starting with 230i models and their 248-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder, which is mated to a six-speed manual or eight-speed automatic transmission. The M240i has the same transmission options and a larger 335-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter inline six-cylinder. Both models come with standard rear-wheel drive and all-wheel drive as an option.\n\nSafety\nAvailable safety technology includes adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability, lane departure warning, automatic emergency braking at speeds up to 37 mph with pedestrian detection, and an automatic parking system.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 BMW 2 Series?\n\nThe BMW 2 Series is the brand’s entry-level car. It is a sporty two-door coupe or convertible with seating for four. Two models are available: the 230i and M240i. The 230i is powered by a 248-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine while the M240i gets a 335-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter six-cylinder. Both versions are offered with rear- or all-wheel drive and either an eight-speed automatic transmission or a six-speed manual. Competitors include the Audi A3  and Mercedes-Benz A-Class .\n\nWhat’s New on the 2019 BMW 2 Series?\n\nStandard Active Driving Assistant includes lane departure and forward collision warnings and city collision mitigation. Parking sensors are now standard. The optional navigation system adds real-time traffic information and a one-year trial of Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 BMW 2 Series Are Most Important?\n\nAs most cars of this size have migrated to front-wheel drive, the 2 Series’ rear-wheel-drive-based architecture has become a more unique offering.  Available features include a heated steering wheel, heated front seats, a moonroof, wireless device charging and a Wi-Fi hot spot.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 BMW 2 Series?\n\nAs BMW’s lineup continues to expand and become more technologically complex, the 2 Series offers the elemental, well-balanced driving experience on which the brand built its reputation. The 2 Series also has a surprising amount of interior and trunk room for its size. Luxury competitors don’t offer much like it without stepping up to the next size and price class, but it is light on standard luxury features and can get expensive when optioned out.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 BMW 2 Series?\n\nThe BMW 2 Series is the brand’s entry-level car. It is a sporty two-door coupe or convertible with seating for four. Two models are available: the 230i and M240i. The 230i is powered by a 248-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, while the M240i gets a 335-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six. Both versions are offered with rear- or all-wheel drive and either an eight-speed automatic transmission or a six-speed manual. Competitors include the Audi A3 and Mercedes-Benz A-Class. A new 2 Series Gran Coupe debuts for 2020 and is covered separately in the Cars.com Research section.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 BMW 2 Series?\n\nTrim updates include darkened taillights, a gloss-black grille frame for the 230i and gloss-black mirror caps and gray accents for the M240i. Rain-sensing wipers are now standard.\n\nWhat Features in the 2020 BMW 2 Series Are Most Important?\n\nAs most cars of this size have migrated to front-wheel drive, including the new 2 Series Gran Coupe, the two-door 2 Series’ rear-wheel-drive-based architecture has become a more unique offering. Available features include a heated steering wheel, heated front seats, a moonroof, wireless device charging and a Wi-Fi hot spot.\n\nShould I Buy the 2020 BMW 2 Series?\n\nAs BMW’s lineup continues to expand and become more technologically complex, the 2 Series offers the elemental, well-balanced driving experience on which the brand built its reputation. The 2 Series also has a surprising amount of interior and trunk room for its size. Luxury competitors don’t offer much like it without stepping up to the next size and price class, but it is light on standard luxury features and can get expensive when optioned out.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2021 BMW 2 Series?\n\nThe BMW 2 Series is the brand’s entry-level car. It’s available as a four-seat coupe or convertible and a five-seat, four-door Gran Coupe. \n\nThe coupe and convertible come in 230i and M240i form. The 230i is powered by a 248-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, while the M240i gets a 335-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six. Both versions are offered with rear- or all-wheel drive and an eight-speed automatic or six-speed manual transmission. \n\nThe Gran Coupe is powered by a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that makes 228 hp in the 228i and 301 hp in the M235i. The Gran Coupe has standard all-wheel drive and an eight-speed automatic transmission. Competitors include the Audi TT and Mercedes-Benz A-Class. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2021 BMW 2 Series?\n\nThe coupe and convertible gain standard Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity, while the Gran Coupe adds Android Auto and a digital instrument panel. \n\nWhat Features in the 2021 BMW 2 Series Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n17-inch wheels\nLED headlights\nRain-sensing windshield wipers\nPush-button start\nForward collision warning\nLane departure warning\nFront and rear parking sensors\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nKeyless access\nPower moonroof\nHeated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nWireless device charging\nHarman Kardon stereo\nShould I Buy the 2021 BMW 2 Series?\n\nAs BMW’s lineup expands and becomes more technologically complex, the 2 Series coupe and convertible offer the well-balanced, sporty driving experience upon which the brand built its reputation. The 2 Series also has a surprising amount of interior and trunk room for its size. The Gran Coupe, however, uses a front-wheel-drive platform, and the car’s driving experience doesn’t measure up to BMW standards.",
