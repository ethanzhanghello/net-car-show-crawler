      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe rear-wheel-drive BMW 1 Series enters its fifth year on the market with a few visual changes, as well as a new higher-performance version from BMW’s M division, dubbed the 1 Series M. Above the entry-level 128i is the 135i, whose compact dimensions and two-door layout give it few genuine competitors. The car comes as a coupe or convertible; shoppers might cross-shop the 135i with the Nissan 370Z, Infiniti G37 coupe or top-end versions of Detroit’s muscle cars.\n\nThe 128i is covered separately in Cars.com’s Research section.\n\n(Skip to details on the: BMW 1 Series M)\n\nExterior\nWith standard visual cues that come only with the 128i’s optional M Sport Package, the 135i has an aggressive front bumper with three large air inlets. Xenon headlights are standard, and they carry a white bordering up top for 2012, mirroring the headlight treatment across most other BMWs. These lights include a string of LEDs embedded in the caps, a visual cue used in the automaker’s redesigned 6 Series.\n\nRather than the 3 Series convertible’s folding metal hardtop, the 135i convertible has a fabric soft-top that can open or close in 22 seconds, BMW says. It operates at speeds up to 25 mph.\n\nThe 1 Series remains a small car overall, about 2 inches shorter and narrower than a Scion tC. The popular 3 Series coupe, in comparison, measures about 10 inches longer.\n\nInterior\nThe 135i’s interior design is fairly traditional, with more upright shapes than sweeping contours. Dual-zone climate controls sit below the center air vents and optional navigation system, with BMW’s latest-generation iDrive knob controller ahead of the center console. The system can now read text messages aloud or stream songs off a paired BlackBerry smartphone.\n\nBMW says the cabin controls boast “a more refined look and feel” for 2012, though the layout is hard to distinguish from 2011’s. In contrast to the seat belts that motor forward for easier reach in the 3 Series coupe, the 1 Series’ belts are fixed onto the B-pillars.\n\nOn 135i coupes, the two-position backseat folds in a standard 60/40 split. The convertible offers only a center pass-through. Vinyl seats are standard, with leather optional. The M Sport Package adds unique headliner materials, an M-branded steering wheel and shifter, and sport seats with more aggressive side bolstering.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe 135i’s turbocharged inline-six makes 300 horsepower and 300 pounds-feet of torque. It works through a six-speed manual or BMW’s seven-speed dual-clutch automatic. Either car hits 60 mph in about 5 seconds, BMW says. The M Sport Package adds a sport-tuned suspension with high-performance, six-piston front and two-piston rear brakes.\n\nIf that seems like too much, consider stepping down to the 230-hp, normally aspirated 128i, which is covered separately in the Cars.com Research section.\n\nSafety\nActive head restraints, two-row side curtain airbags, front airbags and side-impact airbags for the front seats are all standard. So is an electronic stability system, antilock brakes and traction control. Like most convertibles, the 135i convertible does not have the curtain airbags; pop-up roll bars deploy behind the rear seats in the event of a rollover.\n\n1 Series M\nRather than the single-turbo setup from the 135i, the 1 Series M gets a twin-turbo six-cylinder that’s good for 335 hp and 332 pounds-feet of torque. In extreme situations, the 1 Series M can enter an overboost mode to crank out 369 pounds-feet of torque (horsepower remains the same). A standard limited-slip differential can go all the way to lock, rendering maximum straight-line acceleration and better traction on slippery surfaces.\n\nThe 1 Series M comes only as a coupe, and only with a six-speed manual transmission. Citing a lower center of gravity and overall weight savings of 35 pounds, BMW will not offer the 1 Series’ optional moonroof on the M car. That helps it tip the scales at just under 3,300 pounds, more than 400 pounds less than the 414-hp M3 coupe — the next rung up on BMW’s M ladder. Indeed, the 1 Series M’s zero-to-60 time — just 4.7 seconds, BMW says — ties a stick-shift M3’s.\n\nVisual changes include unique side mirrors that look similar to those on the M3, as well as a more aggressive front bumper and quad tailpipes. The 1 Series M’s extended fenders house a track that’s 2.8 inches wider up front and 1.8 inches wider in back versus the 135i. The suspension, which shares its aluminum components with the M3, supports lightweight 19-inch wheels. The car also gets cross-drilled 14.2-inch front and 13.8-inch rear brake discs.\n\nInside, the 1 Series M gets standard sport seats, plus gray gauges and leather-wrapped portions of the dashboard.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nBMW’s small 1 Series debuted in the U.S. for 2008 as a coupe and a convertible. The up-level 135i is powered by a new 300-horsepower inline-six-cylinder engine with one turbocharger instead of two that drives the rear wheels. A less expensive 128i covered separately in the Cars.com Research section is also offered. The 135i competes with performance cars like the Nissan 370Z and Audi TT.\n\nNew for 2011\nIn addition to the new 3.0-liter engine for the 135i, an optional seven-speed dual-clutch automated manual transmission replaces the six-speed automatic. BMW also added some features to option packages.\n\nExterior\nCompared to the 3 Series coupe, the 135i features a more upright grille and a C-pillar that’s not as sleekly styled. A pronounced sheet metal crease runs the length of the coupe’s sides, which are otherwise relatively smooth.\n\nAdaptive xenon headlights follow the direction of the steering wheel\nAvailable automatic high-beam headlights\n135i adds an aero kit that BMW says provides greater downforce and improved brake cooling\n18-inch wheels are standard on coupe, available on convertible\nHeated side mirrors and heated windshield washer jets\nRain-sensing wipers\nConvertible features power-operated soft-top that BMW says can open or close in 22 seconds\n\nInterior\nFront occupants sit on bucket seats, and there’s room for two in the backseat.\n\nAuxiliary jack for connecting an MP3 player\n60/40-split folding rear seat can expand the coupe’s trunk\nOptional Sport Package includes sport seats with more aggressive bolstering\nConvertible’s leather seats have BMW’s Sun Reflective Technology, which is designed to lower the temperature of seats exposed to sunlight\nOptional navigation system equips the 1 Series with BMW’s iDrive control system\nStandard HD radio\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe 135i’s new 3.0-liter inline-six uses a single turbocharger instead of two as on the previous version, but it retains the same power ratings: 300 hp and 300 pounds-feet of torque. BMW says the new engine is more efficient.\n\n3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder engine\nRear-wheel drive\nSix-speed manual or new seven-speed dual-clutch automated manual transmission\nOptional paddle shifters for automatic transmission\nOptional Active Steering system can adjust how much the car turns for a given turn of the steering wheel\nCompared to the 128i, the 135i has a stiffer sport suspension and performance brakes\n\nSafety\nSafety features include:\n\nSide-impact airbags for the front seats\nSide curtain airbags for front and rear occupants\nElectronic stability system\nAntilock brakes\nConvertible loses the side curtain airbags but keeps the side-impact airbags and features pop-up roll bars",

      "expert_review": "NEW YORK — The new face of fast got slapped hard here. It turned the other cheek and got slapped again. It got slapped every time it ventured forth in this city of hard knocks. That’s New York for you. It has no respect for German engineering, finely tuned sports cars or automobiles other than those yellow crater crawlers with “TAXI” signs up top. Anything else gets trashed.\n\nThus was the case with the 2008 BMW 135i coupe we drove here. On smooth, well-maintained roads, the tightly hewn, rear-wheel-drive 135i — one of four members of BMW’s new 1-Series family now on sale in the United States — is marvelous to behold. It lives up to its marketing slogan, “the new look of fast.” It handles brilliantly, the sharpest handling we’ve experienced in a compact car at any price. It is a driver’s car supreme.\n\nBut smooth, well-maintained roads in New York City and environs are as rare as a politician willing to call for an increase in federal gasoline taxes in an election year. The streets here are beyond bad. They are mean. They are brutal.\n\n“Ahhh-ouch!” cried my wife, Mary Anne. “Can’t you be more careful?” she asked as the 135i’s front wheels crashed over a crater on West 41st Street. She was sitting in the front passenger’s seat. I felt her pain but could do little to relieve it.\n\nI tried keeping an eye out for egregious potholes, sunken manhole covers, urban earthquake faults, ruffles, ripples and ridges. But there were too many of them to avoid — a pothole followed or accompanied by a vertical tear in the street; a road section that rose on the left and dropped precipitously on the right; and steel plates that appeared to have been dropped willy-nilly, rather than fitted properly over street segments that had been carved out by road destruction — oops! — construction crews.\n\nIt was shameful.\n\nBMW’s engineers went all out to develop a sports car with a suspension that performs superbly on good roads and reasonably well on surfaces that are less than perfect. But despite the 135i’s excellent suspension engineering — MacPherson struts up front, stabilizer bars front and rear along with a rear multi-link suspension setup, a four-wheel independent suspension designed to keep the car upright and turn-tight — it wasn’t ready for New York.\n\nThis city’s streets are bereft of decency in terms of drivability. Here is where infrastructure has come to die and to take as many cars as possible along with it.\n\nThis is no joke. On an outbound trip, turning off Second Avenue onto East 31st, heading toward the Lincoln Tunnel and the New Jersey Turnpike, I slammed on the 135i’s brakes to avoid hitting a Yellow Cab helplessly sprawled in the street. The cab’s left front wheel was twisted upward, seemingly torn from its axle. The cab’s axle, in fact, was broken on the left side, largely thanks to a pothole that swallowed and twisted the left-wheel assembly.\n\nSo much for that crater crawler! Not even it could escape the endless torture of Gotham’s roads.\n\nThere was passable space between the cab’s front end and cars parked next to the left curb. I put the 135i in first gear and slowly moved around the wreckage, thanking heaven that the cab had found that particular pothole before we did.\n\nHow strange it all seemed. We were in a superbly engineered car, albeit one not designed for maximum passenger comfort in the rear. On the reasonably maintained New Jersey Turnpike, we were in road-trip paradise. The 135i moved so swiftly, handled emergency maneuvers so deftly, our drive time seemed to fly by.\n\nAnd then we entered the mouth of this car-eating metropolis, this city of the endless speed bump and the sinkhole traffic circle. Suddenly, the 135i seemed not up to the task. The remarkable competence of its engineering was undermined by the sad incompetence of an urban infrastructure falling apart one street at a time.",

      "expert_review": "CORNWALL, N.Y. — Bad times are best enjoyed in the rearview mirror. So mostly for the heck of it, I got in the 2009 BMW 135i coupe and drove here nearly 300 miles from my home in Northern Virginia.\n The women in my family would’ve had me do otherwise — hop a plane, take a train or, God forbid, ride a bus from Virginia to New York. I will do that sort of thing eventually.\nBut now I’d rather revel in my hypocrisy, passionately proclaiming my support for mass transit while doing everything in my power to avoid it.\nThat, to many people, including some in my family, is an unseemly charade, one worthy of a politician — other than, of course, Vice President Biden, who seems to have a genuine thing for Amtrak.\nBut I can explain.\nI love cars. I am hopelessly addicted to them, although I am keenly aware of their rather steep downside in matters environmental and energy. I require no intervention. None would work, anyway. Just put me in something like the 135i coupe and let me go.\nIt is the kind of car loved by people who love driving — rear-wheel drive, diminutive yet gifted with power (in this case, 300 horsepower delivered by an inline six-cylinder engine) and wonderfully agile on surfaces such as Angola Road here, which twists, turns, dips, disappears and reappears around curves.\nThere’s just something to love about a car that intuitively follows all of that. It’s like the motorized version of a faithful dog — I’m thinking chocolate Labrador — who follows you everywhere, knows your moves, and senses your mood. It is the car as pet.\n That means it also comes with a few surprises — happily, all of them good. The first is comfort.\nCoupes and roadsters inherently are selfish cars, “me-mobiles” often expressly designed for the pleasure of the driver. The 135i certainly delivers on that score. But even there, it does its job in a way that doesn’t wear out the car’s driver or its passengers.\nA part of the secret is BMW’s application of common sense. Unlike some of its rivals, BMW does not attempt to stuff five seats into a compact coupe that is more desirable for four people. There are four seats — two up front and two in the rear, and that’s that. The result is enough headroom and legroom for four people, which helps to keep those four people reasonably civil on long trips.\nThe second surprise is the sheer ease with which the135i graces the road. Put another way, it does a good job of providing driving excitement without demanding Grand Prix racing competence from the driver.\nI like that. I want to have fun behind the wheel without being made to feel less than worthy for sitting there, which is the way some automobiles — I’m thinking the $1.45 million Lamborghini Reventon — can make you feel.\nModels such as the Reventon are so expensive, so powerful, so technologically sophisticated, and so darned fast, they quite literally leave you breathless, thinking that you should be somewhere else instead of the driver’s seat, overwhelmed with the anxiety of possibly crashing the thing or doing some other damage that will scar you and the car forever.\nThere is excitement in driving cars such as the Reventon. But, for me, there is no fundamental joy in doing so, certainly not the kind I get from getting behind the wheel of a well-crafted, well-balanced, reasonably affordable (for successful entrepreneurs or wage slaves still fortunate enough to be in jobs that pay higher tax-rate salaries) coupe such as the BMW 135i.",

      "expert_review": "The 2013 135is isn’t the quickest or most sophisticated car in BMW’s lineup, but its size and athletic demeanor make it one of the brand’s most entertaining models for everyday driving.\n  The BMW 135is is about as back to basics a performance coupe as you’ll find in BMW’s range these days, a reminder of a time when the brand was more about the driving experience than luxury goodies. There is no adjustable suspension. Don’t want BMW’s iDrive control system? No problem.\n  Essentially, it’s you, a slick-shifting six-speed manual and a turbocharged inline-six engine — and the results are magical.\n  The 135is is the most performance-oriented version of the 2013 BMW 1 Series, positioned above the less powerful 135i and 128i models. This position is reflected in the coupe’s $44,175 starting price, which includes a $925 destination charge. That’s nearly a $4,000 price premium over the 135i coupe, and the upcharge is similar for the soft-top convertible body style. We tested a 135is coupe with an as-tested price of $48,245 (see the Monroney sticker); to see how its specs compare with other convertible-optional cars like the Audi TTS and Infiniti IPL G, click here.\n  What Makes an ‘is’  Performance-oriented exterior cues help distinguish the 135is from the regular 135i, but they aren’t as extreme as the ones on the now-discontinued 1 Series M Coupe. The overall look is aggressive without being over the top; features include unique 18-inch alloy wheels, black strakes in the twin-kidney grille and black mirror caps. The 135is sounds different, too, thanks to a louder performance exhaust notes.\n  Turbocharged Power  The BMW 135is isn’t just an exercise in unique styling, though, as the car also gets a more powerful turbocharged inline-six engine that’s rated at 320 horsepower — 20 hp more than the 135i.\n  For an engine with a lot of low-end torque — 317 pounds-feet at 1,300 rpm — I expected stronger off-the-line performance, especially in a car with a curb weight of 3,373 pounds, which is relatively light by modern standards. You don’t really feel the engine’s power until the tachometer needle swings past 3,000 rpm. The turbo six-cylinder enjoys being revved — and it must be if you want to experience its considerable potential; BMW cites a zero-to-60-mph time of 4.9 seconds with the manual transmission or 4.8 with the optional dual-clutch automatic.\n  Our test car had the standard six-speed manual. The shifter is precise, and it didn’t feel excessively tall, like some BMW shift levers. The clutch pedal is firm underfoot, but not so heavy that commuting in traffic was a nightmare.\n  Clutch engagement is predictable and smooth, but matching engine rpm when downshifting was tricky due to the gas pedal. The problem is that there’s a half-second or so delay between pressing the pedal and when engine-rpm jumps, and this lag makes it difficult to consistently blip the throttle on downshifts. It’s the biggest issue with this manual-transmission drivetrain.\n  Thrifty fuel economy probably isn’t a key requirement for BMW 135is shoppers, but it is a side benefit. The coupe achieves an EPA-estimated 20/28 mpg city/highway with the manual transmission and 18/25 mpg with the automatic. The turbo six-cylinder takes more expensive premium gas, but that’s the norm among luxury-badged performance cars.\n  Ride & Handling  If you want to know why car enthusiasts rave about BMWs, a quick drive in the rear-wheel-drive 135is will answer a lot of your questions. Typically, their enthusiasm is centered around handling, and that’s where the 135is really excels.\n  The 135is is proof that you can’t fool the laws of physics. The 1 Series coupe is small by modern standards — roughly the size of a BMW 3 Series from the 1980s — but its tidy dimensions are an incredible asset when it comes to handling performance and help establish the car’s stellar driving feel.\n  It’s not just that the car stays relatively flat when cornering, which a lot of performance cars manage to do, but that it feels magnetized to the road throughout the turn, with the weight of the car over the outside rear wheel.\n  This performance comes courtesy of the 135is’ M sport suspension. The setup yields a firm ride that produces quick reactions to bumps, but even on some of the worst roads in Chicago, ride quality was never harsh or punishing like it can be in some sporty cars. You’ll have to be the judge as to whether the setup is too high strung for you, but I appreciated the connected feel it delivered.\n  The steering is an important part of the BMW 1 Series 135is’ driver-oriented formula, too. The car has a thick-rimmed M-style steering wheel that feels great in your hands. There’s an appealing weightiness to it, and it provides a direct, undiluted feel for the road that perfectly complements the sport package suspension.\n  Simple Interior  Modern cars have an amazing amount of technology. Even though the 135is is packed with its share of features, when compared with other new BMWs the standard cabin looks remarkably simple. The center console, for one, has a parking brake lever, the manual shifter and … that’s it. There isn’t an iDrive controller or any of its associated buttons (it’s optional), and neither are there rocker switches for the Driving Dynamics Control that other BMWs incorporate. For a driving enthusiast, the interior’s overall focus on the most important controls — the shifter, steering wheel and pedals — is refreshing.\n  The other thing that’s refreshing about the 135is is its great natural visibility. The past few years have seen the rise of safety features like blind spot warning systems that are designed to counteract the increasingly prevalent problem of cars that are hard to see out of, whether because of high belt lines, tall trunk lids or thick roof pillars. This technology is often a poor substitute, and the 135is proves that when you give the driver enough visibility in the first place, these features are less important. The 135is has enough glass in the right places to give you the visibility you need when checking for traffic around you.\n  Sport bucket seats are part of the deal with the BMW 135is. They’re comfortable, though not especially wide, but the bigger issue is how far you have to reach for the seat belt, which is attached to the B-pillar. I’m 6 feet 1 inch tall, and it was quite a reach for me; it would be even harder for shorter drivers who sit closer to the steering wheel. If you thought those motorized seat belt assistants that some cars have are gimmicks, you won’t after a few days in the 135is. Other cabin shortcomings include tiny cupholders and an audio system display that blacks out completely when wearing polarized sunglasses.\n  There’s room for two in the backseat, but it’s tight for taller adults. It’s not so much the seat cushioning, which offers decent comfort, but more the lack of both headroom (my head was touching the roof) and legroom.\n  Safety  Neither the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety nor the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has crash-tested the BMW 1 Series, and the model’s limited sales volume means testing at a future date is unlikely.\n  Standard safety features for the BMW 135is coupe include antilock brakes, an electronic stability system, side-impact airbags for the front seats and side curtain airbags for front and rear occupants. The car also has adaptive headlights and brake lights. For a full list of safety features, check out the Features & Specs page.\n  135is in the Market  The less-is-more mantra doesn’t always make a lot of sense (Who really wants less bacon?), but as an admitted handling snob, I submit it has a certain appeal when it comes to cars. The BMW 135is is fun in a way that only a small, light car can be, and these types of cars are getting harder and harder to find — in the BMW lineup or elsewhere. It’s a driver’s car that doesn’t sacrifice everyday comfort, and that’s why it’s great.\n\n\n\n     Send Mike an email",
