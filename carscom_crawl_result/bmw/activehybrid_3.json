      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe 2013 model year brings the launch of the BMW ActiveHybrid 3, a hybrid version of the 3 Series sedan. The five-seat sedan can operate at speeds up to 47 mph on electric power alone. It also retains performance qualities that BMW is known for, with acceleration from zero to 60 mph in 5.2 seconds, according to the automaker. Competitors include the Infiniti M35h and Lexus GS 450h hybrids. It hits dealerships in fall 2012.\nExterior\nSubtle styling cues differentiate the ActiveHybrid 3 from the regular 3 Series. There are logos on the rear roof pillars, adaptive xenon headlights, galvanized slats in the twin-kidney grille and matte chrome tailpipes. The sedan comes with standard 18-inch alloy wheels. InteriorDifferences in the cabin are similarly minimal. The ActiveHybrid 3 features a standard 8.8-inch iDrive screen with a navigation system. Most options from the regular 3 Series sedan carry over to the ActiveHybrid 3. Some of those options include heated and ventilated seats, heated rear seats, a heated steering wheel, a head-up display and a premium stereo.\nUnder the Hood\nThe ActiveHybrid 3’s hybrid drivetrain consists of a 300-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder engine, an eight-speed automatic transmission with an integrated electric motor that makes 55 hp and a lithium-ion battery pack. Total system output is 335 hp and 330 pounds-feet of torque. The battery is located between the rear wheel arches in the trunk, resulting in a little less cargo space than the regular 3 Series. The rear-seat does continue to have standard split-folding.\n\nA unique feature of the hybrid powertrain is that when it’s in pure Eco Pro (electric only) mode, the car can be driven for up to 2.5 miles at speeds up to 47 mph. The electric motor can provide a power boost when accelerating, and the gas engine can shut down when coasting at speeds up to 100 mph. Also standard is stop/start fuel-saving technology, which automatically shuts the engine off at stop lights, restarting when needed.\n\nThe hybrid’s Driving Experience Control includes an Eco Pro mode in addition to Comfort and Sport modes. Eco Pro promotes fuel efficiency by increasing the time spent in the car’s all-electric mode.\nSafety\nSafety features include antilock brakes, an electronic stability system, side-impact airbags, knee airbags and side curtain airbags. Optional features include parking sensors, parallel parking assist, a backup camera, the Surround View system, adaptive headlights, speed limit information, a lane departure warning system and night vision with pedestrian detection.",

It’s available as a sedan, hatchback (Gran Turismo) or wagon, and numerous drivetrains are offered including hybrid and diesel versions. The five-seat 3 Series comes with rear- or all-wheel drive and competes with the Audi A4, Cadillac ATS and Mercedes-Benz C-Class.\n\n(Skip to details on the: 3 Series Gran Turismo, ActiveHybrid 3)\n\nNew for 2014\nThe 3 Series Sport Wagon rejoins the lineup after skipping a model year, and a new Gran Turismo version that combines coupe and hatchback styling is also new. A new turbocharged four-cylinder diesel engine makes its debut in the 328d and gets an EPA-estimated 32/45 mpg city/highway with rear-wheel drive. The new 4 Series coupe has replaced the 3 Series coupe in BMW’s lineup. \n\nNew standard features include a leather-wrapped sport steering wheel, dark burl walnut wood trim and a 10-year subscription to BMW’s emergency communication system that includes automatic collision notification. Models with the available navigation system get a new iDrive controller with a text-input touchpad.\n\nExterior Highlights\n\n\nDifferent grille, side mirror and tailpipe treatments distinguish among the Sport, Luxury and M Sport “lines”\n17-inch alloy wheels; available 18- or 19-inch wheels\nRain-sensing windshield wipers\nAvailable Active Steering system with speed-sensitive assist\nAvailable adaptive xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights\nAvailable automatic high-beam headlights\nAvailable power moonroof\n\nInterior Highlights\n\n\nSeats five\nManually adjustable front seats; power front seats available\nAvailable leather upholstery\nAvailable heated front and rear seats, heated steering wheel\nAvailable split-folding backseat\nPush-button start\nDual-zone automatic climate control\nTilt/telescoping steering wheel\nCD stereo with HD Radio and USB port\nBluetooth connectivity\nIDrive controller and 6.5-inch screen\nAvailable navigation system\nAvailable Harman Kardon surround-sound stereo\nAvailable sunshades for the rear windows\n\nUnder the Hood\n\n\n180-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (320i)\n180-hp, turbo-diesel 2.0-liter four-cylinder (328d)\n240-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder (328i)\n300-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder (335i)\nEight-speed automatic transmission\nSix-speed manual available\nFuel-saving stop-start technology\n\nSafety Features\n\nAntilock brakes\nElectronic stability system\nSide-impact airbags for the front seats\nSide curtain airbags\nFront knee airbags\nAvailable front and rear parking sensors\nAvailable backup camera\nAvailable lane departure warning\nAvailable blind spot warning system\nAvailable active cruise control with Stop & Go technology\n\n\n3 Series Gran Turismo\nThe 3 Series Gran Turismo is a new four-door coupe like hatchback version of BMW’s compact luxury car. Though styling cues are shared with the 3 Series Sport Wagon, the 3 Series Gran Turismo is a larger car overall, measuring nearly 8 inches longer and more than 3 inches taller.
