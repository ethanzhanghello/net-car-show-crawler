      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe five-seat 5 Series is offered with a twin-turbo V-8 (550i), a single-turbo six-cylinder (535i) and a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder for the 528i, with an eight-speed automatic transmission available across the board. Competitors include the Mercedes-Benz E-Class, Audi A6 and Infiniti M.\n\nThe 5 Series lineup includes the Gran Turismo, a tall hatchback built on the 7 Series sedan platform. There’s also an ActiveHybrid 5 model that gets an EPA-estimated 23/30 mpg city/highway; it’s covered separately in the Cars.com Research section just like the high-performance M5 sport sedan.\n\n(Skip to details on the: 5 Series Gran Turismo)\nNew for 2013\nFor 2013, the 535i and 550i can now have the BMW Individual Composition Package, which includes extended leather upholstery, 19-inch alloy wheels, Alcantara headliner material and Shadowline trim. Standalone BMW Individual options include wood inlays on the steering wheel, and unique paint and wood trim. Updates to the navigation system include revised submenus, weather information and optional Google search.\nExterior\nThe 5 Series shares its platform with the bigger 7 Series sedan. Up front, the car’s signature kidney grilles sit low and are upright. Adaptive xenon headlights are optional on the 528i and standard elsewhere. The taillights employ three rows of LED lights, and BMW’s Adaptive Brake Lights illuminate a larger section under hard braking. Exterior features include:\n\n\n17-inch alloy wheels (528i)\nAvailable 18- and 19-inch rims\nStandard power sunroof\nStandard heated side mirrors\n\nInterior\nDrawing cues from the 7 Series, the 5 Series’ climate-control readouts use BMW’s Black Panel technology to appear out of dark panels without the brightened look of traditional electroluminescent displays. Cupholders are in the center console instead of flipping from the dashboard as on the previous generation.\n\nThe optional navigation system includes a massive high-resolution 10.2-inch center display. Without navigation, the display still sorts through various audio and setup menus, but it shrinks to a 7-inch display and 800-by-480 pixel resolution. Both setups incorporate BMW’s iDrive system. Interior features include:\n\n\n10-way power front seats\nAutomatic dual-zone air conditioning\nPower tilt/telescoping steering wheel\nOptional head-up display\nOptional heated and ventilated front seats\nOptional 60/40-split folding backseat\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe 528i has a 240-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine. The 535i features a 300-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter six-cylinder and the 550i has a twin-turbo 4.4-liter V-8 that makes 400 hp. All three use an eight-speed automatic transmission; the 535i and 550i also offer a six-speed manual. All three models are available with rear- or xDrive all-wheel drive.\n\nBMW’s available Adaptive Drive system includes Active Roll Stabilization, which attempts to actively counter body roll, as well as an adaptive suspension and customizable settings for both the drivetrain and suspension. Mechanical features include:\n\n\nOptional Active Steering varies the steering ratio to render easier turning at low speeds and stable handling at high speeds\nOptional adaptive cruise control includes full stop-and-go capabilities to manage heavy traffic\n\nSafety\nA blind spot monitoring system, a self-parking assist and a lane departure warning system are optional, as is adaptive cruise control with a collision warning system. Standard safety features include:\n\n\nSide curtain airbags\nSide-impact airbags for the front seats\nActive front head restraints\nElectronic stability system\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes\n\n5 Series Gran Turismo\nBMW’s hatchback version of the 5 Series, dubbed the 5 Series Gran Turismo (GT), receives a few changes for 2013. The base 535i GT is powered by a 300-hp turbocharged six-cylinder while the 550i gets a power boost for its twin-turbo 4.4-liter V-8 engine, which now makes 445 hp and 480 pounds-feet of torque. The engine also gets fuel-saving stop-start technology and BMW’s Eco Pro system. Both engines team with an eight-speed automatic transmission and are available with rear- or all-wheel drive.\n\nAn M Sport Package that includes aero body trim, larger wheels and tires, and other performance enhancements is available. BMW Apps, an application that allows a variety of iPhone applications to run through the iDrive system, is a $250 option.\n\nThe Gran Turismo’s interior and exterior borrow cues from BMW’s 7 Series flagship sedan. With its steeply raked hatch ending in a short, sedanlike trunk, the Gran Turismo measures about 6 inches longer than the 5 Series sedan. The hatch opens in two sections: The entire hatch can be raised, or a section below the rear window opens separately to reveal a trunk behind the rear seats and below a cargo cover. For additional storage capacity, the seats fold in a 40/20/40 split.\n\nThe Gran Turismo can accommodate four or five, depending on the backseat configuration. Though it carries the 5 Series name, this model shares as much with the larger 7 Series, and many of its measurements — including all seating dimensions — differ from those of the 5 Series sedan.\n\nThe Gran Turismo’s interior includes Black Panel gauge and climate displays. The available Value Package includes an updated navigation system, a head-up display and smartphone integration. Back to top",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in November 2010 about the 2011 BMW 535. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2012, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nI don’t walk away from every new model with a single overriding impression, but sometimes a car grabs me by the collar and shakes me. While that wasn’t exactly the case with the redesigned 2011 BMW 5 Series, that car did consistently whisper in my ear.\n\nIf the new 5 Series is anything, it’s quiet and comfortable.\n\nThis new level of comfort broadens the sport sedan’s appeal, but at the same time the newly redesigned car gives up even more of its old visceral experience, which has been abating generation by generation.\n\nThe 5 Series sedan comes in three levels: the 528i, 535i and 550i. (The bizarre 5 Series Gran Turismo is reviewed separately.) Though there was a time when those numbers represented engine sizes, BMW’s recent embrace of turbocharging has cast off any semblance of meaning. Suffice it to say the 528i has a six-cylinder, the 535i has a turbocharged six-cylinder and the 550i has a turbocharged V-8. See them compared here.\n\nI tested the 535i and 550i with rear-wheel drive. All-wheel drive is available for both of these levels, designated “xDrive.”\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe 2011 5 Series is further proof that BMW is pulling itself out of an awkward design era. Recently, the only element that had seemed to tie one model to another was an ill-conceived — and poorly received — rear-end design nicknamed the “Bangle butt,” after former chief designer Chris Bangle. Though the previous-generation 5 Series’ trunklid was better integrated than the one on the earlier 7 Series, its too-small grille and raised-eyebrow headlights were an aesthetic failure. With a design inspired by the headlights, the taillights looked like they were trying to escape the car altogether. Blech.\n\nRefreshes weren’t enough to cure the 5’s ills, so 2011’s complete redesign is a godsend. The grille is stronger than ever, the taillights look like they want to be there and the headlights are more aggressive than fey. They aren’t perfect, though: There’s a translucent white stripe along the top of the headlight clusters, also seen on other BMWs. It looks like something that was supposed to be removed after shipping.\n\nThe hood is sculpted in the fashion of other recent BMW redesigns, including the Z4 and 7 Series. In lieu of faux vents on the front fenders, chrome surrounds the side marker lights — relatively subtle by today’s standards. The 528i has 17-inch alloy wheels, and the 535i and 550i have 18-inchers. Larger wheels are optional.\n\nCompared with the 2010 model, the 2011 is 2 inches longer and a half-inch wider, with 3.2 more inches of wheelbase. The car is easily mistaken for the redesigned 7 Series, though the flagship is almost 7 inches longer and nearly 2 inches wider.\n\nIn the Cabin\nBecause each was equipped with the optional Sport Package, both of our test cars had “multi-contoured” power sport seats, which we found comfortable. An additional seat adjustment, which tilts the upper section of the backrest forward independently, is a cherished feature. Likewise for the power-extending bottom cushion, though the gap it forms collects enough crud to clog a Dustbuster. We were satisfied with the front seats’ overall comfort and dimensions, but we wouldn’t have minded a little more front-seat legroom.\n\nDespite the larger exterior, the 5 Series’ interior isn’t notably roomier than before. Most seating dimensions increase or decrease by no more than a tenth of an inch or so, though front headroom is up 1.4 inches, and there’s an inch more shoulder room up there. Shoulder room is an inch narrower in the backseat. While it’s workable, the backseat isn’t exceptionally roomy. By the numbers alone, nothing in this class has impressive rear legroom, though we found the Infiniti M sedan’s backseat more accommodating. The midsize luxury sedan class is dominated by rear- and all-wheel-drive cars, which mean a large center floor hump. Call them five-seaters if you want, but those center seats are less usable than in other cars.\n\nCharacteristic of BMWs, the 5 Series’ cabin is relatively simple and spare, mostly in a good way. The instruments, though, are too plain in a market segment full of glowing electroluminescent gauges, though you can opt for a head-up display that projects crucial info onto the windshield. The 5 Series’ interior is otherwise a deft exercise in restraint. The materials are high-quality overall, with elements like standard genuine wood trim, or real aluminum available as a no-cost alternative. One big sticking point for me — which, again, is par for the course with BMWs — is the standard leatherette (that’s fake leather) seats in the 528i and 535i. Real leather is optional on these and standard on the 550i.\n\nThough BMW has high-quality vinyl, the lack of real leather at these prices is hard to swallow. Archrival Mercedes-Benz is guilty of the same, but comparable models from Audi, Infiniti, Jaguar and Volvo all have leather to start, and some of those are priced lower.\n\nFrankly, this isn’t a new phenomenon for BMW, or even for the luxury class, where you’re more likely to pay for features that come standard in the most affordable of vehicles. For example, practically every new entry-level car comes standard with a folding backseat, and, increasingly, an iPod connector. In the 5 Series, they’ll cost you $475 and $400, respectively.\n\nOne after another of our editors remarked about the shortage of features at our 535i’s $58,275 as-tested price. It had no navigation, no heated or cooled seats, no backup camera. On the upside, though some of these items are included in packages, you can also get them a la carte, so you’re not forced to pay extra for something you might not want.\n\nThe standard sedan has a 7-inch display and an abbreviated version of the iDrive control system, which employs a multifunction knob/joystick and a cluster of buttons on the center console. With the $1,900 navigation option, the screen increases to 10.2 inches and includes voice activation and traffic information. iDrive controls many audio system functions, the telephone, the BMW Assist telematics system and numerous vehicle settings.\n\nBMW’s iDrive has earned disdain over the years, but the current generation is actually pretty good. To my way of thinking, the issue has never been how hard it might be to learn but how simple it is to operate once you do learn it, and that’s the aspect that has improved. Don’t let iDrive’s reputation distract you from the true ergonomic foibles on this and other BMWs: I speak of the electronic gear selector and turn-signal stalk, both of which immediately spring back to a center position after you move them rather than stay where you put them. With this design, you lose the ingrained and perfectly natural feedback of a turn signal that’s still on and a transmission that’s in the gear you want. As a result, you’re always looking for displays just to make sure you don’t, for example, roll the wrong way when you lift off the brake.\n\nAre these controls bothersome enough to break the deal for a would-be buyer? You’d be surprised, but the BMW faithful have overlooked such things because of the vaunted BMW driving experience. So how’s that going in 2011?\n\nDrivetrains\nThe 528i, 535i and 550i are rated at 240, 300 and 400 horsepower, respectively. The turbocharged version of the 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder in the 535i makes the 550i superfluous, rocketing the car to 60 mph in less than 6 seconds. If you prefer 5 seconds, the 550i’s twin-turbo 4.4-liter V-8 will deliver, but the 535i’s character is more than you might expect from a turbo-six. There was some hesitation at times, but I wouldn’t attribute it to turbo lag, because it’s intermittent. Almost across the board, this turbo-six feels like a V-8. It’s damn impressive, and plenty efficient at 20/30 mpg city/highway with the automatic transmission. This beats practically all competitors. Only the base Audi A6 tops it, at an estimated 21/30 mpg.\n\nAll-wheel drive, in the 535i xDrive, gives up 1 mpg. The six-speed manual transmission, available only with rear-wheel drive — is rated lower still, at 19/28 mpg. The 528i, which comes only with an automatic and rear-wheel drive, saves you a couple of mpg, rated 22/32 mpg. The 550i’s best performance is 17/25 mpg with the automatic, 16/24 mpg with xDrive and 15/22 mpg with the manual transmission. All the cars require premium gas.\n\nWhere does this efficiency come from? Direct fuel injection plays a part, but as the mileage ratings reflect, the new eight-speed automatic transmission is a major player. My impressions of it are positive overall, though it’s more effective with the 550i’s larger engine (as is often true of automatics). What stood out was how quickly it kicked down under all circumstances, be it one gear, three gears, basically anything. This isn’t always the case. In fact, historically, an increase in the number of a transmission’s gears hasn’t always guaranteed satisfying performance.\n\nThe transmission’s responsiveness was still good in the 535i, but it wasn’t quite as quick and decisive on the downshift as it had been in the 550i. In either car, sliding the gear selector to the left (the only position it actually stays in) activates an automatic Sport mode, which raises the rpm at which the transmission upshifts. It’s a sportier approach, but it doesn’t seem to speed the actual gear-change time. You can also shift manually by then pushing the stick forward or back, or by using paddles on the steering wheel. Frankly, with eight speeds to work with, you’re always wondering what gear you’re in, where you need to be and if it will even let you shift higher or lower from your current speed. The fun is lost.\n\nAutomatics have become so smooth that you often can’t tell when they’re shifting up. In normal Drive mode in the 535i, I was quite aware of the shifting. It’s under heavier acceleration that the transmission is its smoothest. It’s an odd approach, but we don’t object.\n\nBraking: One Step Up, Two Back\nThere is an aspect of the 5 Series that we do object to, though, and that’s the braking. To be clear, the car stops well enough; it’s not a safety concern. The problem is the feel of the braking, which pays the price for one of BMW’s “Efficient Dynamics” provisions. Like the new 7 Series, the 5 Series employs Brake Energy Regeneration, which is a distant cousin of the regenerative braking that hybrids use to recover spent energy and use it again. In this case, there’s no motor helping propel the car, but the generator (alternator) can be turned on and off with a clutch.\n\nDriven by a belt, an alternator puts a constant load on an engine, and that hurts efficiency. This is the same reason belt-driven hydraulic steering pumps have been replaced by electric power assist in many cars, including the 5 Series. The alternator must be turned by the engine, but it doesn’t have to be all the time. BMW’s alternator has a clutch that releases the belt drive as often as possible, allowing the ignition and any accessories to run off the battery. The battery isn’t much different from a regular 12-volt starter battery, though it’s designed for deeper cycling — to discharge as much as 40 percent and then recharge. (Conventional starter batteries are kept topped off all the time.)\n\nIt’s when the car is decelerating that the alternator reengages and recharges the battery. This is a clever idea that BMW claims is good for a 3 percent efficiency boost, or roughly 1 mpg in mileage terms. Unfortunately, it makes the braking feel uneven, nonlinear. As you brake, the transmission downshifts through the gears as the car decelerates, aggressively locking the torque converter whenever possible. This allows the car’s inertia to turn the engine and its alternator, optimizing electrical regeneration. In a normal arrangement, an automatic transmission holds on to a high gear as you decelerate and brake, ultimately downshifting when you come to a stop. That sensation is smoother.\n\nThe problem is that the degree of engine braking varies as the 5 Series’ transmission downshifts through the gears, so even though you’re applying steady pressure to the brake pedal, the deceleration is uneven and you tend to come to an abrupt halt. For what it’s worth, we thought this sensation was worse in the 550i Gran Turismo we tested, but it’s still a problem here — and it’s not what we’d expect from a company that once touted “The Ultimate Driving Machine” (recently overshadowed by the ill-advised “Joy” advertising campaign).\n\nGiven a choice, I’d want BMW to tweak the operation or eliminate the transmission’s downshifting behavior during braking. I don’t know how much that would hurt the mileage, but I suspect any driving enthusiast would prefer it. The driving experience is neither ultimate nor joyful. I wouldn’t like it from any brand, but it’s especially hard to accept from BMW.\n\nRide & Handling\nBoth our test cars had the Sport Package, which includes several features that affect ride and handling, so bear in mind that the base suspension will perform differently. The package adds an adaptive suspension and active stabilizer bars, both of which are controlled by the Driving Dynamics Control rocker switch next to the shifter. DDC’s four modes — Comfort, Normal, Sport and Sport+ — vary the suspension settings, along with accelerator sensitivity, automatic shifting behavior, power-steering assist and traction control. It’s much simpler to use than the old approach, which included multiple buttons for the various systems. Now you can program the Sport mode to vary the chassis settings, the drivetrain behavior or both, making your preferences just a push or two away using the DDC buttons.\n\nThe 5 Series rides comfortably indeed in the Comfort mode, and it’s not bad in Normal. I was surprised by that because the Sport Package equipped both of our test cars with 19-inch wheels and lower-series run-flat tires. Sounds like a recipe for jarred bones, but that wasn’t the case. Cycle through the modes, and you can feel the ride firm up and soften, but it’s not always as noticeable as you’ll find in some cars, and that’s fine. One gets the impression the system is designed for true performance differences, not dramatic effect, so it really depends on the type of road and driving conditions.\n\nThe handling is interesting. Both the 535i and 550i are true to BMW’s founding principle of balanced front/rear weight distribution: The 535i is rated 50.9/49.1 percent and the 550i is 52.4/47.6 percent. The automatic is light enough that the manual transmission relinquishes only a tenth of a percent to the rear in either car. More important than the specs, the cars feel wonderfully balanced and controllable. Size be damned, you can four-wheel-drift these things all day. The standard electronic stability system can be dialed back or defeated entirely.\n\nThe standard suspension and different wheel sizes and tire types will all affect roadholding, but there’s no mistaking when the dynamic basics are there, and in the 5 Series, they are. My main complaint is about the sense of involvement. Dynamically, the 5 Series does what you want it to and more, but it’s less visceral than I’d like, and maybe even less than the version that ended in 2010. Generation by generation, BMWs are becoming less engaging to drive. Though it had its own shortcomings, the 5 Series of two generations ago, coded E39, felt more ultimate.\n\nThe electric power steering might play a part, as its feedback isn’t as good as it was in the best of BMW’s now-endangered hydraulic-assist implementations, but it’s good enough that a casual driver wouldn’t know the difference. (For the record, I’m talking about the standard steering; the active steering option, which is sometimes criticized for its feel, wasn’t on our test cars.)\n\nSafety\nThe BMW 5 Series has earned Top Safety Pick status from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety for top scores in frontal, side and rear crash tests and a roof-strength test that reflects rollover protection. The 5 Series is also among the first models tested under the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s revamped New Car Assessment Program, in which it earned an overall score of five stars, the highest possible composite score. Of the various separate tests, however, in the frontal crash it scored four rather than five stars for both the driver and front passenger. That wasn’t enough to bring down its overall score.\n\nThere are six airbags: two in front, a seat-mounted side-impact airbag for each of the front occupants, and side curtains that cover the side windows flanking the front and rear seats. Standard safety features include four-wheel antilock brakes, a stability system with traction control, and active head restraints for the front seats. For a full list of safety features, click here.\n\n5 Series in the Market\nThe things that trouble me about the 5 Series — high price, fewer standard features than some competing models — are things that sort themselves out. If BMW is asking too much for too little, consumers will make it clear in the only language that matters: money, or the lack thereof, in the hands of BMW dealers. There’s a lot to like about the 5, not the least of which is its admirable mileage.\n\nThe 5 Series’ combination of capability with unprecedented comfort is bound to broaden its appeal overall. BMW isn’t the only brand that has attempted to provide all things to all buyers. Lexus and Mercedes have been chasing that ghost for decades. Technology enables a single car to deliver a broad range of comfort and sportiness, and in some ways the new 5 Series sedan is a high-water mark in this regard, both for BMW’s line and for the entire midsize luxury car segment. It succeeds in behaving like two types of car, but what it doesn’t do is feel like two types of car, and I suspect the loss of that visceral feeling will disappoint the BMW faithful.\n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "I don’t walk away from every new model with a single overriding impression, but sometimes a car grabs me by the collar and shakes me. While that wasn’t exactly the case with the redesigned 2011 BMW 5 Series, that car did consistently whisper in my ear.\n\nIf the new 5 Series is anything, it’s quiet and comfortable.\n\nThis new level of comfort broadens the sport sedan’s appeal, but at the same time the newly redesigned car gives up even more of its old visceral experience, which has been abating generation by generation.\n\nThe 5 Series sedan comes in three levels: the 528i, 535i and 550i. (The bizarre 5 Series Gran Turismo is reviewed separately.) Though there was a time when those numbers represented engine sizes, BMW’s recent embrace of turbocharging has cast off any semblance of meaning. Suffice it to say the 528i has a six-cylinder, the 535i has a turbocharged six-cylinder and the 550i has a turbocharged V-8. See them compared here.\n\nI tested the 535i and 550i with rear-wheel drive. All-wheel drive is available for both of these levels, designated “xDrive.”\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nThe 2011 5 Series is further proof that BMW is pulling itself out of an awkward design era. Recently, the only element that had seemed to tie one model to another was an ill-conceived — and poorly received — rear-end design nicknamed the “Bangle butt,” after former chief designer Chris Bangle. Though the previous-generation 5 Series’ trunklid was better integrated than the one on the earlier 7 Series, its too-small grille and raised-eyebrow headlights were an aesthetic failure. With a design inspired by the headlights, the taillights looked like they were trying to escape the car altogether. Blech.\n\nRefreshes weren’t enough to cure the 5’s ills, so 2011’s complete redesign is a godsend. The grille is stronger than ever, the taillights look like they want to be there and the headlights are more aggressive than fey. They aren’t perfect, though: There’s a translucent white stripe along the top of the headlight clusters, also seen on other BMWs. It looks like something that was supposed to be removed after shipping.\n\nThe hood is sculpted in the fashion of other recent BMW redesigns, including the Z4 and 7 Series. In lieu of faux vents on the front fenders, chrome surrounds the side marker lights — relatively subtle by today’s standards. The 528i has 17-inch alloy wheels, and the 535i and 550i have 18-inchers. Larger wheels are optional.\n\nCompared with the 2010 model, the 2011 is 2 inches longer and a half-inch wider, with 3.2 more inches of wheelbase. The car is easily mistaken for the redesigned 7 Series, though the flagship is almost 7 inches longer and nearly 2 inches wider.\n\nIn the Cabin\n\nBecause each was equipped with the optional Sport Package, both of our test cars had “multi-contoured” power sport seats, which we found comfortable. An additional seat adjustment, which tilts the upper section of the backrest forward independently, is a cherished feature. Likewise for the power-extending bottom cushion, though the gap it forms collects enough crud to clog a Dustbuster. We were satisfied with the front seats’ overall comfort and dimensions, but we wouldn’t have minded a little more front-seat legroom.\n\nDespite the larger exterior, the 5 Series’ interior isn’t notably roomier than before. Most seating dimensions increase or decrease by no more than a tenth of an inch or so, though front headroom is up 1.4 inches, and there’s an inch more shoulder room up there. Shoulder room is an inch narrower in the backseat. While it’s workable, the backseat isn’t exceptionally roomy. By the numbers alone, nothing in this class has impressive rear legroom, though we found the Infiniti M sedan’s backseat more accommodating. The midsize luxury sedan class is dominated by rear- and all-wheel-drive cars, which mean a large center floor hump. Call them five-seaters if you want, but those center seats are less usable than in other cars.\n\nCharacteristic of BMWs, the 5 Series’ cabin is relatively simple and spare, mostly in a good way. The instruments, though, are too plain in a market segment full of glowing electroluminescent gauges, though you can opt for a head-up display that projects crucial info onto the windshield. The 5 Series’ interior is otherwise a deft exercise in restraint. The materials are high-quality overall, with elements like standard genuine wood trim, or real aluminum available as a no-cost alternative. One big sticking point for me — which, again, is par for the course with BMWs — is the standard leatherette (that’s fake leather) seats in the 528i and 535i. Real leather is optional on these and standard on the 550i.\n\nThough BMW has high-quality vinyl, the lack of real leather at these prices is hard to swallow. Arch competitor Mercedes-Benz is guilty of the same, but comparable models from Audi, Infiniti, Jaguar and Volvo all have leather to start, and some of those are priced lower.\n\nFrankly, this isn’t a new phenomenon for BMW, or even for the luxury class, where you’re more likely to pay for features that come standard in the most affordable of vehicles. For example, practically every new entry-level car comes standard with a folding backseat, and, increasingly, an iPod connector. In the 5 Series, they’ll cost you $475 and $400, respectively.\n\nOne after another of our editors remarked about the shortage of features at our 535i’s $58,275 as-tested price. It had no navigation, no heated or cooled seats, no backup camera. On the upside, though some of these items are included in packages, you can also get them a la carte, so you’re not forced to pay extra for something you might not want.\n\nThe standard sedan has a 7-inch display and an abbreviated version of the iDrive control system, which employs a multifunction knob/joystick and a cluster of buttons on the center console. With the $1,900 navigation option, the screen increases to 10.2 inches and includes voice activation and traffic information. iDrive controls many audio system functions, the telephone, the BMW Assist telematics system and numerous vehicle settings.\n\nBMW’s iDrive has earned disdain over the years, but the current generation is actually pretty good. To my way of thinking, the issue has never been how hard it might be to learn but how simple it is to operate once you do learn it, and that’s the aspect that has improved. Don’t let iDrive’s reputation distract you from the true ergonomic foibles on this and other BMWs: I speak of the electronic gear selector and turn-signal stalk, both of which immediately spring back to a center position after you move them rather than stay where you put them. With this design, you lose the ingrained and perfectly natural feedback of a turn signal that’s still on and a transmission that’s in the gear you want. As a result, you’re always looking for displays just to make sure you don’t, for example, roll the wrong way when you lift off the brake.\n\nAre these controls bothersome enough to break the deal for a would-be buyer? You’d be surprised, but the BMW faithful have overlooked such things because of the vaunted BMW driving experience. So how’s that going in 2011?\n\nDrivetrains\n\nThe 528i, 535i and 550i are rated at 240, 300 and 400 horsepower, respectively. The turbocharged version of the 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder in the 535i makes the 550i superfluous, rocketing the car to 60 mph in less than 6 seconds. If you prefer 5 seconds, the 550i’s twin-turbo 4.4-liter V-8 will deliver, but the 535i’s character is more than you might expect from a turbo-six. There was some hesitation at times, but I wouldn’t attribute it to turbo lag, because it’s intermittent. Almost across the board, this turbo-six feels like a V-8. It’s damn impressive, and plenty efficient at 20/30 mpg city/highway with the automatic transmission. This beats practically all competitors. Only the base Audi A6 tops it, at an estimated 21/30 mpg.\n\nAll-wheel drive, in the 535i xDrive, gives up 1 mpg. The six-speed manual transmission, available only with rear-wheel drive — is rated lower still, at 19/28 mpg. The 528i, which comes only with an automatic and rear-wheel drive, saves you a couple of mpg, rated 22/32 mpg. The 550i’s best performance is 17/25 mpg with the automatic, 16/24 mpg with xDrive and 15/22 mpg with the manual transmission. All the cars require premium gas.\n\nWhere does this efficiency come from? Direct fuel injection plays a part, but as the mileage ratings reflect, the new eight-speed automatic transmission is a major player. My impressions of it are positive overall, though it’s more effective with the 550i’s larger engine (as is often true of automatics). What stood out was how quickly it kicked down under all circumstances, be it one gear, three gears, basically anything. This isn’t always the case. In fact, historically, an increase in the number of a transmission’s gears hasn’t always guaranteed satisfying performance.\n\nThe transmission’s responsiveness was still good in the 535i, but it wasn’t quite as quick and decisive on the downshift as it had been in the 550i. In either car, sliding the gear selector to the left (the only position it actually stays in) activates an automatic Sport mode, which raises the rpm at which the transmission upshifts. It’s a sportier approach, but it doesn’t seem to speed the actual gear-change time. You can also shift manually by then pushing the stick forward or back, or by using paddles on the steering wheel. Frankly, with eight speeds to work with, you’re always wondering what gear you’re in, where you need to be and if it will even let you shift higher or lower from your current speed. The fun is lost.\n\nAutomatics have become so smooth that you often can’t tell when they’re shifting up. In normal Drive mode in the 535i, I was quite aware of the shifting. It’s under heavier acceleration that the transmission is its smoothest. It’s an odd approach, but we don’t object.\n\nBraking: One Step Up, Two Back\n\nThere is an aspect of the 5 Series that we do object to, though, and that’s the braking. To be clear, the car stops well enough; it’s not a safety concern. The problem is the feel of the braking, which pays the price for one of BMW’s “Efficient Dynamics” provisions. Like the new 7 Series, the 5 Series employs Brake Energy Regeneration, which is a distant cousin of the regenerative braking that hybrids use to recover spent energy and use it again. In this case, there’s no motor helping propel the car, but the generator (alternator) can be turned on and off with a clutch.\n\nDriven by a belt, an alternator puts a constant load on an engine, and that hurts efficiency. This is the same reason belt-driven hydraulic steering pumps have been replaced by electric power assist in many cars, including the 5 Series. The alternator must be turned by the engine, but it doesn’t have to be all the time. BMW’s alternator has a clutch that releases the belt drive as often as possible, allowing the ignition and any accessories to run off the battery. The battery isn’t much different from a regular 12-volt starter battery, though it’s designed for deeper cycling — to discharge as much as 40 percent and then recharge. (Conventional starter batteries are kept topped off all the time.)\n\nIt’s when the car is decelerating that the alternator reengages and recharges the battery. This is a clever idea that BMW claims is good for a 3 percent efficiency boost, or roughly 1 mpg in mileage terms. Unfortunately, it makes the braking feel uneven, nonlinear. As you brake, the transmission downshifts through the gears as the car decelerates, aggressively locking the torque converter whenever possible. This allows the car’s inertia to turn the engine and its alternator, optimizing electrical regeneration. In a normal arrangement, an automatic transmission holds on to a high gear as you decelerate and brake, ultimately downshifting when you come to a stop. That sensation is smoother.\n\nThe problem is that the degree of engine braking varies as the 5 Series’ transmission downshifts through the gears, so even though you’re applying steady pressure to the brake pedal, the deceleration is uneven and you tend to come to an abrupt halt. For what it’s worth, we thought this sensation was worse in the 550i Gran Turismo we tested, but it’s still a problem here — and it’s not what we’d expect from a company that once touted “The Ultimate Driving Machine” (recently overshadowed by the ill-advised “Joy” advertising campaign).\n\nGiven a choice, I’d want BMW to tweak the operation or eliminate the transmission’s downshifting behavior during braking. I don’t know how much that would hurt the mileage, but I suspect any driving enthusiast would prefer it. The driving experience is neither ultimate nor joyful. I wouldn’t like it from any brand, but it’s especially hard to accept from BMW. \n\nRide & Handling\n\nBoth our test cars had the Sport Package, which includes several features that affect ride and handling, so bear in mind that the base suspension will perform differently. The package adds an adaptive suspension and active stabilizer bars both of which are controlled by the Driving Dynamics Control rocker switch next to the shifter. DDC’s four modes — Comfort, Normal, Sport and Sport+ — vary the suspension settings, along with accelerator sensitivity, automatic shifting behavior, power steering assist and traction control. It’s much simpler to use than the old approach, which included multiple buttons for the various systems. Now you can program the Sport mode to vary the chassis settings, the drivetrain behavior or both, making your preferences just a push or two away using the DDC buttons.\n\nThe 5 Series rides comfortably indeed in the Comfort mode, and it’s not bad in Normal. I was surprised by that because the Sport Package equipped both of our test cars with 19-inch wheels and lower-series run-flat tires. Sounds like a recipe for jarred bones, but that wasn’t the case. Cycle through the modes, and you can feel the ride firm up and soften, but it’s not always as noticeable as you’ll find in some cars, and that’s fine. One gets the impression the system is designed for true performance differences, not dramatic effect, so it really depends on the type of road and driving conditions.\n\nThe handling is interesting. Both the 535i and 550i are true to BMW’s founding principle of balanced front/rear weight distribution: The 535i is rated 50.9/49.1 percent and the 550i is 52.4/47.6 percent. The automatic is light enough that the manual transmission relinquishes only a tenth of a percent to the rear in either car. More important than the specs, the cars feel wonderfully balanced and controllable. Size be damned, you can four-wheel-drift these things all day. The standard electronic stability system can be dialed back or defeated entirely.\n\nThe standard suspension and different wheel sizes and tire types will all affect roadholding, but there’s no mistaking when the dynamic basics are there, and in the 5 Series, they are. My main complaint is about the sense of involvement. Dynamically, the 5 Series does what you want it to and more, but it’s less visceral than I’d like, and maybe even less than the version that ended in 2010. Generation by generation, BMWs are becoming less engaging to drive. Though it had its own shortcomings, the 5 Series of two generations ago, coded E39, felt more ultimate.\n\nThe electric power steering might play a part, as its feedback isn’t as good as it was in the best of BMW’s now-endangered hydraulic-assist implementations, but it’s good enough that a casual driver wouldn’t know the difference. (For the record, I’m talking about the standard steering; the active steering option, which is sometimes criticized for its feel, wasn’t on our test cars.)\n\nSafety\n\nThe BMW 5 Series has earned Top Safety Pick status from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety for top scores in frontal, side and rear crash tests and a roof-strength test that reflects rollover protection. The 5 Series is also among the first models tested under the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s revamped New Car Assessment Program, in which it earned an overall score of five stars, the highest possible composite score. Of the various separate tests, however, in the frontal crash it scored four rather than five stars for both the driver and front passenger. That wasn’t enough to bring down its overall score.\n\nThere are six airbags: two in front, a seat-mounted side-impact airbag for each of the front occupants, and side curtains that cover the side windows flanking the front and rear seats. Standard safety features include four-wheel antilock brakes, a stability system with traction control, and active head restraints for the front seats. For a full list of safety features, click here.\n\n5 Series in the Market\n\nThe things that trouble me about the 5 Series — high price, fewer standard features than some competing models — are things that sort themselves out. If BMW is asking too much for too little, consumers will make it clear in the only language that matters: money, or the lack thereof, in the hands of BMW dealers. There’s a lot to like about the 5, not the least of which is its admirable mileage.\n\nThe 5 Series’ combination of capability with unprecedented comfort is bound to broaden its appeal overall. BMW isn’t the only brand that has attempted to provide all things to all buyers. Lexus and Mercedes have been chasing that ghost for decades. Technology enables a single car to deliver a broad range of comfort and sportiness, and in some ways the new 5 Series sedan is a high-water mark in this regard, both for BMW’s line and for the entire midsize luxury car segment. It succeeds in behaving like two types of car, but what it doesn’t do is feel like two types of car, and I suspect the loss of that visceral feeling will disappoint the BMW faithful.\n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "When the BMW 535xi arrived in my driveway, the first thing I noticed was it slyly glancing my way with its long-lashed cat-eye headlights. Admiring her understated feminine lines, I definitively decided she’s a gal. After driving her, I can attest that this car is bursting with sleek, sexy she-power.\n\nInside this all-wheel-drive sedan, I lazily lounged back in the lovely leather driver’s seat, which I had adjusted to an absolutely perfect setting. Luckily, the seat has a couple of programmable pre-sets, otherwise I would have had to waste all my spare while-baby’s-sleeping moments finding the ideal setting again. Unlike the BMW 750i, which I wrote about a few months back, this 5 Series lacked a delightful seat massage feature, but I still had toasty hands from the steering-wheel heat, great thigh support from the knee extension and a cradling headrest to pamper me.\n\nMy lipstick and a few other small trinkets fit in the center console, but there’s not room there for much else. Luckily for me, baby wipes and diapers are a thing of the past, otherwise this car would have had me scolding its lack of space. Speaking of space, bulky water bottles are out in the BMW 535xi. Each time I exposed one of the two suspended cupholders up front – quirkily labeled with a not-for-wineglasses symbol – I was reminded of leisurely cocktails at outdoor European cafes. That’s not a surprise, given the automaker is headquartered in Munich, which bursts with European charm. I made do with a Starbucks latte and felt it was just refined enough for a BMW.\n\nBMW is also known for power, and this car has plenty of it. I was literally unable to accelerate slowly in it. Whether coming off a red light or heading onto the highway, I just had to “let her go.” It was invigorating to go from juggling kid paraphernalia to sauntering out the front door and into this posh car, dashing along on the highway. Even on snowy roads, the all-wheel drive handled beautifully.\n\nKeyless entry and start enabled me to briskly walk up to the car, tug on the handle of its just-unlocked door, plop into the driver’s seat, depress the brake while pushing the start button and go. Graceful efficiency at its best! Somehow, a day laden with a string of errands became much more pleasant just because getting in and out of the car was such a cinch. This has quickly become one of my favorite fluff features on any car.\n\nAs much as this little number sizzles, I couldn’t help but feel like I, too, was sizzling at times. The driver temperature controls, both in the dash and accessed through iDrive, are a pain to tweak correctly; there are just too many different settings to adjust in a hurry. As moms, we all know how counterproductive that is when kids are being kids. Instead of trying to fiddle with the cumbersome iDrive system to find the right setting, I was forced to use the A/C max button to cool down the sweltering cabin in a jiffy.\n\nI also felt some heat when I needed extra cargo space. A folding backseat isn’t standard on this car; it costs extra. Consider me dumbfounded.\n\nFurthermore, I was peeved to find that the silver trunk-release button on the key fob is also the panic button, if you hold it down long enough. As much as I love the stainless steel look, I’d like to see a panic button that’s colored with its purpose in mind. It’s for a PANIC situation, during which time I’d rather not have to remember which silly button (is it the lock, the unlock or the trunk release?) also happens to double as the panic button. Let’s get a bit more user-friendly, shall we?\n\nI felt safe while driving the 535xi, until I noticed its three-star driver’s side front-impact crash-test result. Still, that didn’t subtract from the hint of adventure it offers; it’s risqué with just the right amount of elegance and powerful with just the right amount of control. Go ahead and celebrate your she-power in this batting-her-lashes mademoiselle!\n\n*For more information on the BMW 535xi and its safety features, visit Cars.com.

      "expert_review": "In the world of luxury station wagons, there isn’t much sense in trying to justify the price tag. Normally, a wagon is a practical body-type choice for families looking for utility with improved mileage versus a similarly sized SUV. If, however, you’re shopping the all-wheel-drive 535i xDrive or its competitors — the Audi A6 Avant and Mercedes-Benz E-Class wagon — you clearly have an entirely different set of priorities.\n\nThose probably include a high level of luxury, features, performance and, yes, some utility thrown in. This BMW 5 Series wagon provides plenty of each and elicited raves from our staff, my family and even me. It’s hard to fathom why anyone would purchase a $55,000-$75,000 station wagon, but if you’re going to, it would be hard to go wrong with this one.\n\nThe 5 Series wagon comes only in all-wheel-drive 535i xDrive form. Its sedan counterpart can be had in all-wheel or rear-wheel drive, 528i, 535i or 550i configurations; the 528i and 550i are covered separately in Cars.com’s Research section. Click here to compare the whole lineup.\n\nPerformance\nWhat sets the BMW 5 Series wagon apart from the A6 and E-Class is the way it drives. Sure, its looks scream BMW inside and out, but so does the sweetly smooth acceleration coming from the twin-turbo six-cylinder under the hood. In today’s horsepower-heavy world, where cars of all classes frequently top 400 hp, the 535i’s twin-turbocharged 300 hp doesn’t sound very impressive, especially when you consider how heavy a car this is — 4,101 pounds — but it’s still lighter and more powerful than the A6 and E350.\n\nIt also has a superior engine in terms of refinement. The six-speed automatic features a manual setting, but rest assured that even in plain old Drive, the 535i wagon transmission shifts flawlessly and will deliver enough thrills for most drivers.\n\nBMW is notorious for heavy-handed yet precise steering. The 535i features what BMW calls Active Steering, which happily takes away a lot of the labor involved in turning the car during low-speed maneuvers, like navigating parking lots. It isn’t as heavy as its sibling X3 crossover I tested the week prior, and during high-speed driving the steering wheel feels incredibly natural and intuitive — like a good sports car’s.\n\nThe steering was probably the most surprising performance aspect, because you don’t expect such a long, large wagon to carve corners like this one did. No, it isn’t a sports car, nor is it an M3. But for a station wagon, it’s near the top of the heap in terms of cornering and handling.\n\nEven the ride was more comfortable than you’d expect, and it definitely felt smoother than the last two 5 Series sedans — a 528i and 550i — I’ve tested. (The latter one, to be fair, had a suspension-firming Sport package. The wagon did not.)\n\nExterior\nThe 5 Series is BMW’s second-largest sedan, next to the 7 Series, and the wagon adds even more bulk. The rather large rump reminds me of more traditional wagons from the past, while competitors often try to make their wagons look as un-wagon-like as possible. Sure, the 535i xDrive may be frumpy in some regards, but it has elegant lines and a striking profile.\n\nInterior\nWhere BMW has always done things right is on the inside. Sliding into the driver’s seat — my test car had the optional contour seat package, a $1,200 option — is akin to being let into a room at the Ritz. The black dashboard is leather-trimmed with highly polished wood accents. The armrest is padded in thick leather, which feels great. The smell of new leather in a BMW is a favorite sensation, and it was still there even though nearly 5,000 miles had been put on the car before it reached my hands.\n\nThe steering wheel is nicely padded and it’s heated. I drove in damp 40-degree weather most of the time I had the 5 Series wagon and loved the feature; it meant I didn’t need gloves.\n\nThere are a number of ergonomic eccentricities BMW is for some reason holding onto. Cupholders pop out of the dash instead of sitting in the center console, meaning my coffee thermos or Diet Coke rests right above the stereo. The passenger’s cupholder is better-placed, but both move more than you’d like, especially if you have a to-go coffee cup with an open top. Consider yourself warned.\n\nYou could also spill coffee on the new iDrive controller, which happens to be one of the few changes to the 2009 model. This latest controller adds a number of buttons encircling the main control knob so you can easily jump between audio, phone and navigation screens. I much prefer this setup, and now I’d say the iDrive system is as easy to use as similar systems from Audi and Mercedes. You couldn’t say that last year.\n\nBackseat room is very good, but you sit a bit upright and there’s a large hump for the middle passenger to straddle. Parents will find plenty of room for child-safety seats and very easy-to-use Latch connectors with flip-up covers. In other BMWs, you have to remove the covers, greatly increasing your chances of losing them.\n\nCargo\nIn wagon form, the 5 Series is quite utilitarian. There are a lot of convenient features I appreciated during my time with it. Chief among them was the cargo cover that raised and lowered when you opened and closed the hatch. Normally I never keep cargo covers in place because they get in the way of loading groceries or other items when I’m running errands. Might as well not have a cover — except that they keep the sun out and keep everything covered from prying eyes.\n\nBMW’s solution is really simple and works flawlessly. The cargo cover also features a built-in net that attaches to the ceiling. These are generally used to keep pets safer in back, and also to keep them from drooling on your leather.\n\nThe specs for the cargo area come in at 17.7 cubic feet when the rear seats are in place and 58.3 cubic feet when they’re lowered. That first number is far lower than the competition. The Audi A6 has 33.9 cubic feet, and the Mercedes-Benz E-Class has 24.4 cubic feet. The less expensive Volvo XC70 has 33.3 cubic feet. I must say, though, that those numbers really surprise me. Take, for example, the A6. It’s 16 cubic feet bigger with the seats up, but only 5.5 cubic feet larger with them down, coming in at 63.8 cubic feet. Eyeballing the cargo area with the seats up, I don’t think owners will notice such a significant difference between it and the 5 Series.\n\nThe Volvo XC70, on the other hand, is a considerably larger wagon in terms of interior and cargo space, both in terms of specs and my personal experience. What does this mean to luxury-wagon shoppers? Not much. Unless you’re hauling large goods like antiques or boxes routinely, the 5 Series’ space won’t be a hindrance. Its everyday features should more than make up for the smaller area overall.\n\nFeatures\nThe 535i xDrive starts at $55,800 and comes with a fair amount of standard features, like a panoramic moonroof, xenon headlights and rain-sensing windshield wipers. As with most BMWs, though, it’s very easy to load it up with option packages and extravagant features. Our tester was loaded with so many it stickered at almost $74,000.\n\nLeather seats aren’t standard, leatherette is, but BMW adds leather in its Value Package, which comes at no extra cost and also includes an iPod and USB adapter, a heated steering wheel and heated seats. A Premium Package ($2,500) adds a power liftgate. The Sport Package ($1,400) includes comfort seats and black trim around the windows. An M Sport Package ($3,000) includes everything in the Sport Package plus 18-inch alloy wheels with run-flats, an exterior aero kit, a sport steering wheel, and unique paint and interior combinations.\n\nThere are a number of stand-alone options as well. The one I would seriously recommend is the comfort seats ($1,200). These feature a number of additional adjustments and are some of the best seats I’ve ever tested. Less necessary are the head-up display ($1,200) and night vision ($2,200). Both are intended to make driving safer, but are definitely not worth their cost.\n\nNavigation is another $1,900, while a premium stereo is $1,200. Other safety features, like active cruise control ($2,400) and lane departure warning ($950) are nowhere near as useful as the park distance control ($750). Parking sensors have been around a long time, but BMW uses a very simple diagram on the center LCD screen that tells you exactly how close you are to objects while parking. Unlike backup cameras that distort your surroundings, this clear diagram takes even more of the guesswork out of tricky maneuvers.\n\nAs you can see, it’s not that hard to get above the $70,000 mark.\n\nSafety\nBesides options like lane departure warning and antilock brakes, the 5 Series comes equipped with a suite of side curtain airbags and front-seat side-impact airbags. Rear seat-mounted airbags can be ordered as a $385 option.\n\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has crash-tested the BMW 5 Series sedan, but not the wagon. Front and rear crash tests of the sedan received top marks of Good, while side tests produced Marginal ratings, which are second worst. This was because of specific damage to the driver’s torso in the tests.\n\nBMW 535 in the Market\nThe large luxury wagon is not the most sought-after segment in the auto industry, especially these days. The SUV has dominated this market, offering similar utility and space as wagons in a class where gas mileage matters little.\n\nHowever, for those who want the sport-utility of a smaller SUV and the driving feel of a car, wagons are still quite appealing. If the driving experience is vital to your decision, you have to look at the 535i xDrive. Audi’s A6 and Mercedes’ E350 compete in terms of utility and price, especially now that the 2009 A6 has upgraded to a new supercharged engine that produces similar power as the 5 Series wagon.\n\nFor shoppers in this very limited segment, the BMW 535i xDrive is surely an ideal choice, but with the masses still choosing SUVs even today, I wonder how long any manufacturer will keep producing wagons, no matter how good they are.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in June 2009 about the 2009 BMW 535. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2010, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nIn the world of luxury station wagons, there isn’t much sense in trying to justify the price tag. Normally, a wagon is a practical choice for families looking for utility with improved mileage versus a similarly sized SUV. If, however, you’re shopping the all-wheel-drive 535i xDrive or its competitors — the Audi A6 Avant and Mercedes-Benz E-Class wagon — you clearly have an entirely different set of priorities.\n\nThose probably include a high level of luxury, features, performance and, yes, some utility thrown in. BMW’s 5 Series wagon provides plenty of each and elicited raves from our staff, my family and even me. It’s hard to fathom why anyone would purchase a $55,000-$75,000 station wagon, but if you’re going to, it would be hard to go wrong with this one.\n\nThe 5 Series wagon comes only in all-wheel-drive 535i xDrive form. Its sedan counterpart can be had in 528i, 535i or 550i configurations; the 528i and 550i are covered separately in Cars.com’s Research section. Click here to compare the whole lineup.\n\nPerformance\nWhat sets the 5 Series wagon apart from the A6 and E-Class is the way it drives. Sure, its looks scream BMW inside and out, but so does the sweetly smooth acceleration coming from the twin-turbo six-cylinder under the hood. In today’s horsepower-heavy world, where cars of all classes frequently top 400 hp, the 535i’s 300 hp doesn’t sound very impressive, especially when you consider how heavy a car this is — 4,101 pounds — but it’s still lighter and more powerful than the A6 and E350.\n\nIt also has a superior engine in terms of refinement. The six-speed automatic features a manual setting, but rest assured that even in plain old Drive, the 535i wagon shifts flawlessly and will deliver enough thrills for most drivers.\n\nBMW is notorious for heavy-handed yet precise steering. The 535i features what BMW calls Active Steering, which happily takes away a lot of the labor involved in turning the car during low-speed maneuvers, like navigating parking lots. It isn’t as heavy as its sibling X3 crossover I tested the week prior, and during high-speed driving the steering wheel feels incredibly natural and intuitive — like a good sports car’s.\n\nThe steering was probably the most surprising performance aspect, because you don’t expect such a long, large wagon to carve corners like this one did. No, it isn’t a sports car, nor is it an M3. But for a station wagon, it’s near the top of the heap in terms of cornering and handling.\n\nEven the ride was more comfortable than you’d expect, and it definitely felt smoother than the last two 5 Series sedans — a 528i and 550i — I’ve tested. (The latter one, to be fair, had a suspension-firming Sport package. The wagon did not.)\n\nExterior\nThe 5 Series is BMW’s second-largest sedan, next to the 7 Series, and the wagon adds even more bulk. The rather large rump reminds me of more traditional wagons from the past, while competitors often try to make their wagons look as un-wagon-like as possible. Sure, the 535i xDrive may be frumpy in some regards, but it has elegant lines and a striking profile.\n\nInterior\nWhere BMW has always done things right is on the inside. Sliding into the driver’s seat — my test car had the optional contour seat package, a $1,200 option — is akin to being let into a room at the Ritz. The black dashboard is leather-trimmed with highly polished wood accents. The armrest is padded in thick leather, which feels great. The smell of new leather in a BMW is a favorite sensation, and it was still there even though nearly 5,000 miles had been put on the car before it reached my hands.\n\nThe steering wheel is nicely padded and it’s heated. I drove in damp 40-degree weather most of the time I had the 5 Series wagon and loved the feature; it meant I didn’t need gloves.\n\nThere are a number of ergonomic eccentricities BMW is for some reason holding onto. Cupholders pop out of the dash instead of sitting in the center console, meaning my coffee thermos or Diet Coke rests right above the stereo. The passenger’s cupholder is better-placed, but both move more than you’d like, especially if you have a to-go coffee cup with an open top. Consider yourself warned.\n\nYou could also spill coffee on the new iDrive controller, which happens to be one of the few changes to the 2009 model. This latest controller adds a number of buttons encircling the main control knob so you can easily jump between audio, phone and navigation screens. I much prefer this setup, and now I’d say the iDrive system is as easy to use as similar systems from Audi and Mercedes. You couldn’t say that last year.\n\nBackseat room is very good, but you sit a bit upright and there’s a large hump for the middle passenger to straddle. Parents will find plenty of room for child-safety seats and very easy-to-use Latch connectors with flip-up covers. In other BMWs, you have to remove the covers, greatly increasing your chances of losing them.\n\nCargo\nIn wagon form, the 5 Series is quite utilitarian. There are a lot of convenient features I appreciated during my time with it. Chief among them was the cargo cover that raised and lowered when you opened and closed the hatch. Normally I never keep cargo covers in place because they get in the way of loading groceries or other items when I’m running errands. Might as well not have a cover — except that they keep the sun out and keep everything covered from prying eyes.\n\nBMW’s solution is really simple and works flawlessly. The cargo cover also features a built-in net that attaches to the ceiling. These are generally used to keep pets safer in back, and also to keep them from drooling on your leather.\n\nThe specs for the cargo area come in at 17.7 cubic feet when the rear seats are in place and 58.3 cubic feet when they’re lowered. That first number is far lower than the competition. The Audi A6 has 33.9 cubic feet, and the Mercedes-Benz E-Class has 24.4 cubic feet. The less expensive Volvo XC70 has 33.3 cubic feet. I must say, though, that those numbers really surprise me. Take, for example, the A6. It’s 16 cubic feet bigger with the seats up, but only 5.5 cubic feet larger with them down, coming in at 63.8 cubic feet. Eyeballing the cargo area with the seats up, I don’t think owners will notice such a significant difference between it and the 5 Series.\n\nThe Volvo XC70, on the other hand, is a considerably larger wagon in terms of interior and cargo space, both in terms of specs and my personal experience. What does this mean to luxury-wagon shoppers? Not much. Unless you’re hauling large goods like antiques or boxes routinely, the 5 Series’ space won’t be a hindrance. Its everyday features should more than make up for the smaller area overall.\n\nFeatures\nThe 535i xDrive starts at $55,800 and comes with a fair amount of standard features, like a panoramic moonroof, xenon headlights and rain-sensing windshield wipers. As with most BMWs, though, it’s very easy to load it up with option packages and extravagant features. Our tester was loaded with so many it stickered at almost $74,000.\n\nLeather seats aren’t standard, leatherette is, but BMW adds leather in its Value Package, which comes at no extra cost and also includes an iPod and USB adapter, a heated steering wheel and heated seats. A Premium Package ($2,500) adds a power liftgate. The Sport Package ($1,400) includes comfort seats and black trim around the windows. An M Sport Package ($3,000) includes everything in the Sport Package plus 18-inch alloy wheels, an exterior aero kit, a sport steering wheel, and unique paint and interior combinations.\n\nThere are a number of stand-alone options as well. The one I would seriously recommend is the comfort seats ($1,200). These feature a number of additional adjustments and are some of the best seats I’ve ever tested. Less necessary are the heads-up display ($1,200) and night vision ($2,200). Both are intended to make driving safer, but are definitely not worth their cost.\n\nNavigation is another $1,900, while a premium stereo is $1,200. Other safety features, like active cruise control ($2,400) and lane departure warning ($950) are nowhere near as useful as the park distance control ($750). Parking sensors have been around a long time, but BMW uses a very simple diagram on the center LCD screen that tells you exactly how close you are to objects while parking. Unlike backup cameras that distort your surroundings, this clear diagram takes even more of the guesswork out of tricky maneuvers.\n\nAs you can see, it’s not that hard to get above the $70,000 mark.\n\nSafety\nBesides options like lane departure warning, the 5 Series comes equipped with a suite of side curtain airbags and front-seat side-impact airbags. Rear seat-mounted airbags can be ordered as a $385 option.\n\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has crash-tested the 5 Series sedan, but not the wagon. Front and rear crash tests of the sedan received top marks of Good, while side tests produced Marginal ratings, which are second worst. This was because of specific damage to the driver’s torso in the tests.\n\nBMW 535 in the Market\nThe large luxury wagon is not the most sought-after segment in the auto industry, especially these days. The SUV has dominated this market, offering similar utility and space as wagons in a class where gas mileage matters little.\n\nHowever, for those who want the utility of a smaller SUV and the driving feel of a car, wagons are still quite appealing. If the driving experience is vital to your decision, you have to look at the 535i xDrive. Audi’s A6 and Mercedes’ E350 compete in terms of utility and price, especially now that the 2009 A6 has upgraded to a new supercharged engine that produces similar power as the 5 Series wagon.\n\nFor shoppers in this very limited segment, the 535i xDrive is surely an ideal choice, but with the masses still choosing SUVs even today, I wonder how long any manufacturer will keep producing wagons, no matter how good they are.\n\nSend David an email",
