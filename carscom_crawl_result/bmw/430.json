      "expert_review": "Competes with: Audi A5 and Mercedes-Benz C-Class\nLooks like: The 4 Series gets more polish for its sophomore season\nPowertrain: 255-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder (430i and 430i xDrive); 382-hp, turbocharged inline-six-cylinder (M440i xDrive); rear- or all-wheel drive; eight-speed automatic transmission\nHits dealerships: October\nBMW just unveiled a redesigned version of its 4 Series coupe for 2021 with more power, torque and technology than the previous generation. The 4 Series first hit the market in 2014, and the new, second-generation version goes on sale globally in the fall.\nRelated: Which Cars Have Self-Driving Features for 2020?\n\n  \n    \n  \n    Exterior\nThe new model wears a dramatic face highlighted by a reimagining of BMW’s signature kidney grille. It’s larger, angled forward and extends to the bottom of the front bumper; the design also features a new three-dimensional mesh structure. Flanking the grille are slimmer, tapered standard LED headlights and U-shaped daytime running lights. In back, darkened L-shaped LED taillights extend into the quarter panels. M Sport Package models add a specific bumper with larger air intakes, high-gloss black exterior trim and a trunk lid spoiler.\nThe 4 Series grows in size for 2021. The new model rides on  a 1.6-inch-longer wheelbase; it’s 5.2 inches longer and an inch wider overall. BMW says its updated design makes it more aerodynamic.\nInterior \nThe 430i and 430i xDrive models wear open-pore oak grain trim; M440i xDrive versions have aluminum paneling instead. Optional on both is high-gloss ash-gray wood trim or aluminum mesh trim. Leather for the seats and surfaces is optional and available in a variety of colors.\nThe iDrive 7 multimedia system with navigation is standard. BMW said the system’s maps function has been enhanced for more accurate and dynamic routes as well as additional point-of-interest details. The multimedia system is controlled via a touchscreen or using the iDrive controller. The standard screen is 8.8 inches; a 10.25-inch screen is optional. Also standard are wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility.\nThe new 4 Series also uses the latest version of the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant voice recognition system, activated by saying “Hey, BMW.”  It can now be used for things like opening and closing the car’s windows or adjusting the air conditioning.\nEngine, Transmission and 0-60 \nPower is up for 2021. Rear-wheel-drive 430i and all-wheel-drive 430i xDrive models use an updated turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that delivers 255 horsepower and 294 pounds-feet of torque — a boost of 7 hp and 36 pounds-feet, respectively, over the previous model.  BMW says the 430i does 0-60 mph in 5.5 seconds; AWD models hit that mark in 5.3 seconds.\nThe AWD-only M440i xDrive model gets power from a turbocharged inline-six-cylinder engine good for 382 hp and 369 pounds-feet of torque, up 62 hp and 39 pounds-feet, respectively; it does 0-60 in 4.3 seconds. M440i xDrive models get a standard rear M Sport differential, which manages the torque between the left and right rear wheels under acceleration.\nStandard on the six-cylinder model is a 48-volt mild-hybrid system. The starter generator improves both fuel efficiency as well as performance. BMW says it can be used during hard acceleration to increase performance or power the car’s electronic systems. The automaker also says the automatic stop-start function can turn off the engine while the driver is braking for a stop as soon as the speed drops below 9 mph.\nThe optional M Sport Package adds performance-enhancing features like the Adaptive M Suspension and Variable Sport steering, which BMW says adjusts to changes in the steering angle to maximize cornering agility and low-speed comfort.\nBoth models use a standard eight-speed automatic transmission; a manual transmission is no longer available. BMW says the eight-speed is updated and works with the standard navigation system. It uses data from the system and the optional Active Cruise Control system’s radar sensors to plan gear changes related to turns and changes in speed.\nSafety \nStandard safety features include forward collision warning with pedestrian detection, lane departure warning and city collision mitigation. Optional features include active cruise control with stop-and-go functionality, a park assist system, the hands-free Extended Traffic Jam Assist system, and a camera based system that automatically records and saves 20 seconds of video surrounding the moment of impact during a crash.\nPrice\nPrices start at $46,595 for the 430i coupe and $48,595 for the 430i xDrive, $650 more than the outgoing model. The M440i xDrive coupe starts at $59,495 — $5,150 more than the previous model (all prices include a destination charge).\nThe sedan is set for a global market launch in October; no word yet on a redesign of the convertible version.\nEditor’s note: This story was updated Sept. 29, 2020, to reflect that the engines use a single turbocharger instead of twin turbocharging.\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 BMW 4 Series?\n\nThe BMW 4 Series debuted for 2014 as a replacement for the previous-generation 3 Series coupe and convertible. Power comes from turbocharged four- or six-cylinder engines, and rear- and all-wheel-drive versions are available. Competitors include the Audi A5 and Mercedes-Benz C-Class.\n\nWith the same length, width, wheelbase and track as the two-door coupe, but a bit more headroom, the 4 Series Gran Coupe sports a sedan profile. Like the 4 Series coupe and convertible, it’s offered in four-cylinder 430i and six-cylinder 440i forms. The high-performance M4 is available as a coupe or convertible and competes with the Lexus RC F.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 BMW 4 Series?\n\nNew standard active safety features include forward collision warning with pedestrian detection, lane departure warning and city collision mitigation. Rain-sensing windshield wipers are also standard. Trim updates include darkened taillights, a gloss-black grille frame and a new diffuser.\n\nWhat Features in the 2020 BMW 4 Series Are Most Important?\n\nBMW’s rear-wheel-drive handling characteristics have been benchmarked by practically every automaker fielding a luxury sports car. Available active safety features include blind spot warning and adaptive cruise control. Other available tech features include a head-up display, a digital instrument panel, wireless device charging and a Wi-Fi hot spot (data subscription required after initial trial).\n\nShould I Buy the 2020 BMW 4 Series?\n\nHandling and braking are 4 Series highlights. The Gran Coupe version offers extra cargo versatility without sacrificing style, while the retractable-hardtop convertible delivers year-round practicality. However, the automatic transmission’s responses during performance driving are lacking, and the car’s stability system is too conservative.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 BMW 4 Series?\n\nThe BMW 4 Series lineup shares basic underpinnings with BMW’s 3 Series compact car, but with sleeker, personal-luxury-focused body styles. The 4 Series comes as a two-door coupe or convertible, as well as a four-door Gran Coupe sedan with a low, coupelike roofline. The 430 is powered by a 255-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder, while the M440 gets a 382-hp, turbo 3.0-liter inline-six. The mighty M4 high-performance variant has an upgraded version of the 3.0-liter six-cylinder that produces 473 or 503 hp, depending on the model. BMW still offers a six-speed manual transmission, but only on the M4; all other 4 Series cars have a silky eight-speed automatic. Most 4 Series models offer a choice of rear- or all-wheel drive. The 4 Series’ rivals include the Audi A5, Lexus RC and Mercedes-Benz C-Class.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 BMW 4 Series?\n\nAll 4 Series models receive BMW’s Curved Display, which includes a 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster and a 14.9-inch infotainment touchscreen integrated into a single curved panel. The infotainment software is upgraded to the latest iDrive 8 version, which includes new graphics and additional functions.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 BMW 4 Series Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n12.3-inch digital instrument panel\n14.9-inch infotainment touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nSatellite radio\nNavigation \nWi-Fi hot spot\nDual-zone climate control\nTwo USB ports\n10-speaker stereo\nRear cross-traffic alert\nBlind spot warning\nLane departure warning\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nWireless device charging\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nLeather seating\nHead-up instrument display\nAdaptive M Sport suspension\nM Sport differential\nM Sport brakes\n360-degree parking camera\nLane departure steering assist\nShould I Buy the 2024 BMW 4 Series Gran Coupe?\n\nLuxury car shoppers on the fence about what they want most in their next vehicle will appreciate the many body styles offered by the BMW 4 Series. Few vehicles can be had as a sleek coupe, a sun-loving convertible and a relatively practical sedan. No 4 Series will spoil you with backseat space or cargo volume, particularly not with the coupe and convertible, but when it comes to performance and interior quality, this car impresses with its sharp driving manners and elegant cabin layout.",

      "expert_review": "The BMW 4 Series continues into 2023 with slight revisions to its packaging, a new paint color and new pricing after its variants received a refresh for 2021 and 2022, but the biggest change is inside: Starting in March, all 4 Series will come with a curved display and the latest multimedia system for the dashboard and infotainment.\n\nRelated: 2021 BMW M440i Convertible Review: Escape Artist\n\nBoth the regular 4 Series and the performance-minded M4 soon will house BMW’s curved display, which features a 12.3-inch information display behind the steering wheel and a 14.9-inch control display all running on BMW’s iDrive 8 system. Gone are many buttons and controllers in favor of an emphasis on voice and touch controls — emphasized all the more because, like many other Bimmers for 2023, also gone from the lineup is gesture control.\n\nFor models on sale before March, however, the interior largely carries over. The Driving Assistance Professional Package is out and the Premium Package’s head-up display is now only available on the M440i, while the Parking Assist Package has returned and adaptive LED headlights are no longer available as a stand-alone option. A synthetic leather dashboard is now optional on all 4 Series models. On the M4, the driver recorder function is now a stand-alone option.\n\nElsewhere, the Shadowline Package now gets M Sport brakes with red or blue calipers, and a new Skyscraper Grey metallic paint replaces Bluestone metallic. The base 430i’s powerplant is a 255-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine; the M440i gets you a 382-hp, turbo 3.0-liter inline-six; and the range-topping M4 offers a 473-hp, twin-turbo 3.0-liter inline-six capable of up to 503 hp when equipped with the Competition Package. An eight-speed automatic is standard across most of the lineup; the M4 comes with a six-speed manual. Rear-wheel drive is standard; all-wheel drive is optional except on the M4 Competition convertible, where it comes standard.\n\nPricing and Release Date\n\nThe 2023 BMW 4 Series lineup is available now, and full pricing (including the $995 destination fee) is below. All-wheel drive adds $2,000 except on the M4 Competition, where it’s an extra $4,100 on the coupe and standard on the convertible.\n\nCoupe\n\n430i: $48,395\nM440i: $59,245\nM4: $75,695\nM4 Competition: $79,595\n\nConvertible\n\n430i: $56,495\nM440i: $67,245\nM4 Competition: $90,695\n\nGran Coupe\n\n430i: $46,895\nM440i: $58,445\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nQuicker 2022 BMW M3, M4 Competitions With AWD Priced Under $80,000\n2021 BMW M3 and M4: M Stands for Manual\n2021 BMW 4 Series Convertible Drops Its Cover, and Its (Soft) Top\n2021 BMW 4 Series: More Power, More Tech, More Grille, Just … More on the 4\nMore BMW News\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nWhat it is: The BMW 4 Series debuted for 2014 as a replacement for the previous-generation 3 Series coupe and convertible. The 4 Series also includes the high-performance M4 and 4 Series Gran Coupe, a four-door model with coupe like styling.\n\nPower comes from turbocharged four-cylinder and six-cylinder engines, and rear- and all-wheel-drive versions are available. Competitors include the Audi A5 and Mercedes-Benz C-Class.\n\n(Skip to details on the 4 Series Gran Coupe and M4)\nNew for 2017\nTwo new engines bring more power and new model nomenclature. A 248-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder replaces a turbo 2.0-liter that had 240 hp, and the model designation changes from 428i to 430i. Six-cylinder models have a new 320-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six engine, replacing a 300-hp six-cylinder of the same size, and these models are now designated 440i instead of 435i. Wireless phone charging and a Wi-Fi hotspot are new options.\nSignificant Standard Features\n\nPower-adjustable seats\nSplit-folding rear seat\nDual-zone automatic climate control\nBluetooth and USB connectivity\nPower moonroof (coupe)\nPower-retractable hardtop (convertible)\nRequired in every new car: front airbags, antilock brakes and an electronic stability system\n\nSignificant Available Features\n\n248-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (430i)\n320-hp, turbocharged six-cylinder engine (440i)\nSix-speed manual or eight-speed automatic transmission\nRear- or all-wheel drive\nLeather upholstery\nHeated front seats and steering wheel\nFront and rear parking sensors\nSide, top-view and backup cameras\nWireless phone charging\nWi-Fi hotspot\nHead-up display\nBlind spot warning system\nLane departure warning\nHarman Kardon premium stereo\n\n4 Series Gran Coupe\n\nWith the same length, width, wheelbase and track as the two-door coupe but a bit more headroom, the 4 Series Gran Coupe sports a tall hatchback sedan profile and 45.9 cubic feet of luggage space. Like the 4 Series coupe and convertible, it’s offered in four-cylinder 430i and six-cylinder 440i form.\n\nWhat’s Special\n\nHatchback versatility with the look of a coupe\n40-20-40-split rear seatbacks\nEight-speed automatic transmission standard\nRear- or all-wheel drive\n\nBack to top\n\nM4\n\nThe high-performance M4 is available in coupe or convertible form and competes with the Cadillac ATS-V and Lexus RC F. For 2017, the adaptive M suspension is standard instead of optional, and wireless phone charging and a Wi-Fi hotspot are included in the Executive Package.\nWhat’s Special\n\nStandard 425-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter six-cylinder engine\nSix-speed manual or seven-speed dual-clutch transmission\nCarbon fiber roof (coupe)\nPower-retractable hardtop (convertible)\nAvailable Competition Package\nAvailable carbon ceramic brakes\n\nBack to top",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 BMW 4 Series?\n\nThe BMW 4 Series lineup shares basic underpinnings with BMW’s 3 Series compact car, but with sleeker, personal-luxury-focused body styles. The 4 Series comes as a two-door coupe, a two-door convertible and a four-door Gran Coupe sedan with a low, coupe-like roofline. The 430 is powered by a 255-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder, while the M440 gets a 386-hp, turbo 3.0-liter inline-six. The mighty M4 high-performance variant uses an upgraded version of the 3.0-liter six-cylinder that produces 473, 503, 523 or 543 hp depending on the model. BMW still offers a six-speed manual transmission, but only on the M4; all other 4 Series cars have a silky eight-speed automatic. Most 4 Series models offer a choice of rear- or all-wheel drive. The 4 Series’ rivals include the Audi A5, Mercedes-Benz CLE and Lexus RC. BMW also offers an all-electric version of the 4 Series Gran Coupe called the i4 Gran Coupe.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 BMW 4 Series?\n\nThe 4 Series lineup gets restyled headlights and taillights, plus other minor trim updates and updated infotainment software for 2025. Both the 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine in the 430i and the M440i’s inline-six get a new 48-volt mild-hybrid system. The AWD M4 Competition trim gets a 20-hp boost, up to 523 total, and a lightweight M4 CS version with 543 hp joins the line.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 BMW 4 Series Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n12.3-inch digital instrument panel\n14.9-inch infotainment touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nSatellite radio\nNavigation \nWi-Fi hot spot\nDual-zone climate control\nTwo USB ports\n10-speaker stereo\nRear cross-traffic alert\nBlind spot warning\nLane departure warning\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nWireless device charging\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nLeather seating\nHead-up instrument display\nAdaptive M Sport suspension\nM Sport differential\nM Sport brakes\n360-degree camera system\nLane-centering steering\nShould I Buy the 2025 BMW 4 Series Gran Coupe?\n\nLuxury car shoppers on the fence about what they want most in their next vehicle will appreciate the many body styles offered by the BMW 4 Series; few vehicles can be had as a sleek coupe, a sun-loving convertible and a relatively practical sedan. There isn’t a 4 Series that will especially spoil you with backseat space or cargo volume — particularly not the coupe or convertible — but when it comes to performance and interior quality, this car impresses with its sharp driving manners and elegant cabin layout.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 BMW 4 Series?\n\nThe BMW 4 Series debuted for 2014 as a replacement for the previous-generation 3 Series coupe and convertible. Power comes from turbocharged four- or six-cylinder engines, and rear- and all-wheel-drive versions are available. Competitors include the Audi A5 and Mercedes-Benz C-Class.\n\nWith the same length, width, wheelbase and track as the two-door coupe, but a bit more headroom, the 4 Series Gran Coupe sports a sedan profile. Like the 4 Series coupe and convertible, it’s offered in four-cylinder 430i and six-cylinder 440i form. The high-performance M4 is available as a coupe or convertible and competes with the Cadillac ATS-V and Lexus RC F.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2019 BMW 4 Series?\n\nNavigation with real-time traffic information and a one-year trial of Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity is now standard. The M4 also adds standard parking sensors.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 BMW 4 Series Are Most Important?\n\nBMW’s rear-wheel-drive platform’s handling characteristics have been benchmarked by practically every automaker fielding a luxury sports sedan. Available active safety features include blind spot warning, adaptive cruise control and automatic emergency braking. Other available tech features include a head-up display, a digital instrument panel, wireless device charging and a Wi-Fi hot spot (data subscription required after initial trial).\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 BMW 4 Series?\n\nHandling and braking are 4 Series highlights. The Gran Coupe version offers extra cargo versatility without sacrificing style, while the retractable-hardtop convertible delivers year-round practicality. However, the automatic transmission’s responses during performance driving are lacking, and the car’s stability system is too conservative.",
