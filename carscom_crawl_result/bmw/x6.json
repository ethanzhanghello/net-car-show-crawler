      "expert_review": "The 2008 BMW X6 xDrive 35i doesn’t have any head-to-head competition. And why should it? No carmaker has entered the ugly vehicle segment since the Pontiac Aztek was discontinued.\n\nBut BMW, which introduced the X6 at the Detroit auto show earlier this year, thinks it’s onto something. The four-door hatchback, which the German carmaker calls a coupe, may have a certain charm to it with its long hood and pod-like cabin. It’s part car, part truck and part moon rover.\n\nTechnically, BMW calls it a Sports Activity Coupe, a four-passenger utility vehicle with a twin turbo charged I-6 (there’s also a version with a 400-horsepower V-8 for those in search of va-va-voom).\n\nThe idea was to create a sporty utility vehicle that is distinctive, luxurious and all BMW. But something was lost in the translation between the design department and the factory.\n\nThe high back end and the 19-inch low profile tires pushed forward throw off its proportions. It may have a confident and athletic stance, but I can’t imagine it in the Olympics. It must have looked so good on paper. Even now, pictures of the X6 look fantastic.\n\nBut when you stand in front of the vehicle, you cock your head to the side to find just the right angle to enjoy the view, then tilt your head a little more, a little more, and whoops, you’re laying flat on your side, saying “hummm?”\n\nPerhaps this vehicle is a piece of art that I just don’t know how to appreciate, like the first time you see a Mark Rothko or Jackson Pollock. For me, abstract expressionism plays better with oil and canvas than sheet metal and highways.\n\nThe mean part of me wants to call it an over-sized sedan with a lift kit or just another way to show your neighbors you have $60,000 you had no idea what to do with it. What do you even say to them when they ask why you bought it?\n\n“Yeah, well, I wanted something that got the gas mileage of an SUV but is less practical.” Then start polishing the BMW badge on the hood until they notice the brand.\n\nI-6 makes X6 quick, nimble.\n\nObviously, I’m not a fan of its exterior, but once inside, the smooth leather soothed me. Start it up and take off and the X6 provides an excellent ride. From the inside looking out, you never doubt that this is a BMW. Its performance lives up to its pedigree.\n\nThe 300-horsepower twin turbo I-6 has plenty of pep — making the X6 quick and nimble. It launches well from the line and keeps the precise German handling you’d expect.\n\nThe all-wheel-drive system, known as xDrive by BMW, also includes a Dynamic Performance Control that can vary the amount of force going through either rear wheel.\n\nUsing a computer control system and an all-new rear differential, the X6 can help steer the car with torque through the back tires. It can do this while the vehicle is speeding up or slowing down.\n\nReally, it’s just amazing and works extremely well. Say you’re coming up to a turn too fast: the system begins to react when you take your foot off the accelerator. It provides you with a much more stable platform to handle nearly any condition. Chalk one point for the X6.\n\nAnd in heavy cornering, the X6 stays flat as a pancake. The body doesn’t roll and the steering remains firm. On the highway, the ride is quiet and comfortable, though the low-profile tires transfer some road noise into the cabin.\n\nInterior offers many positives\n\nInside, I like the X6. The high-riding position provides a commanding view in traffic and all the materials are what I’d expect from BMW: plush leather seats, clean sweeping lines across the dash and the simple but elegant instrument panel. Everything seems to be laid out across horizontal lines.\n\nIt took a few days to adjust to the center console mounted gear shifter, which reminded me of the steering column mounted gear shifter on many Mercedes Benz. It clicks but doesn’t really move and you have to push it forward to find reverse.\n\nI have no problem with the much maligned iDrive. It seems fairly intuitive and when I’m not sure about something, I consult the owner’s manual, which is thicker than the New York City phone book.\n\nAnd since BMW designed the X6 for four smoking adults (there are ash trays in the front and back), there is plenty of space to stretch out. The cargo department offers 25.6 cubic feet of space, which BMW says can hold four golf bags. If you need more space, the second row folds flat and allows for nearly 60 cubic feet.\n\nWhile it may look different than other BMWs, the X6 comes with lots of complex techno features. There’s the optional active steering that can change the relationship between turning the steering wheel and how far the tires turn.\n\nThis means a driver can turn the steering wheel a little at low speeds and the front tires move more. At high speeds, it’s just the opposite. This, as BMW puts it, “offers exactly the right steering ratio at all speeds.”\n\nThere are loads of other features you can appreciate: power lift-gate, backup camera, heated and ventilated seats, second-row entertainment system and navigation system with real time traffic updates. It’s everything you’d expect and more.\n\nRear visibility an issue\n\nWhile the higher driving position is nice, the way the back window slants it’s difficult to see much through the rearview mirror. One unnerving problem I ran into was the inability to see the roofs of cars behind me. For alert drivers, this means it’s more difficult to determine whether the car following you at night has lights on the roof that can flash in various colors.\n\nBut all the gadgets, gizmos and German-designed advanced safety features don’t make up for this ugly duckling that will never become a swan.\n\nBut I don’t dislike it because it’s homely. I dislike it because it lacks a true purpose. There are ugly vehicles made today that I adore, because they provide function. The X6 doesn’t. It’s easy to measure it by what it can’t do — like carry five people — instead of what it can.\n\nMaybe that’s the reason no other carmaker has decided to enter this uncharted market segment.\n\nScott Burgess is the auto critic for The Detroit News.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 BMW X6?\n\nThe BMW X6 is based on the mid-size BMW X5 SUV but has a sleeker profile thanks to its tapered, fastback-style roofline. The xDrive40i trim has a 335-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six engine, while the M60i has a 523-hp, twin-turbocharged 4.4-liter V-8. The high-performance X6 M packs an upgraded 617-hp version of the twin-turbo V-8, along with a specific track-tuned suspension and other performance-focused hardware. All X6s come with an eight-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive. The X6’s rivals include the Audi Q8, Land Rover Range Rover Sport and Porsche Cayenne Coupe.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 BMW X6?\n\nAfter undergoing an extensive refresh last year, the X6 is mostly unchanged for 2025. Among other minor alterations in standard and available equipment, the Driving Assistance Professional Package adds Active Lane Change with eye activation, in which the vehicle will suggest lane changes to the driver when operating in its hands-on semi-autonomous mode. All the driver has to do to initiate the lane change is look at the appropriate mirror; the car will then activate the turn signal and perform the lane change itself.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 BMW X6 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n12.3-inch configurable instrument display\n14.9-inch infotainment touchscreen\nAmbient interior lighting\nPanoramic moonroof\nAndroid Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity\nNavigation\nForward collision warning with city collision mitigation\nLane departure warning\nBlind spot warning\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nHighway Assistant driving aid\n360-degree camera system\nHead-up instrument display\nHarman Kardon surround-sound stereo\nReverse automatic emergency braking\nFour-zone automatic climate control\nHeated front and rear seats\nHeated steering wheel and armrests\nShould I Buy the 2025 BMW X6?\n\nThe X6 is BMW’s sportier take on its more conventionally shaped X5 sibling. It’s also more expensive and less practical than the X5 because its sloping roofline eats into cargo space and hurts rear visibility. On the other hand, its head-turning looks and strong performance will appeal to SUV shoppers who want something that stands out in a crowd; thanks to its rakish roofline, the X6 does exactly that. It also comes with a long list of standard comfort, tech and safety features.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 BMW X6?\n\nThe BMW X6 is based on the mid-size BMW X5 SUV but has a sleeker profile thanks to its tapered, fastback-style roofline. The xDrive40i trim has a 335-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six engine, while the M60i has a 523-hp, twin-turbocharged 4.4-liter V-8. The high-performance X6 M packs an upgraded 617-hp version of the twin-turbo V-8 along with a specific track-tuned suspension and other performance-focused hardware. All X6s come with an eight-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive. The X6’s rivals include the Audi Q8, Land Rover Range Rover Sport and Porsche Cayenne Coupe.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 BMW X6?\n\nAlong with its X5 sibling, the X6 undergoes an extensive refresh that includes updated exterior styling, hybridized powertrains, revised interiors, new tech features and a renamed trim level. All powertrains get a 48-volt mild-hybrid system, and output of the entry-level turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder engine has been bumped from 335 hp to 375. Despite a name change from M50i to M60i, the M60i’s twin-turbo 4.4-liter V-8 stands pat at 523 hp. The X6 M is now offered solely in top-line Competition form. Every X6 gets a freshened interior featuring BMW’s Curved Display, which is a 12.3-inch digital gauge panel paired with a 14.9-inch infotainment touchscreen. The 2024 X6 also gets the latest version of BMW’s iDrive infotainment software and new ambient lighting features. BMW’s Highway Assistant hands-free driving system is newly available.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 BMW X6 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n12.3-inch configurable instrument display\n14.9-inch infotainment touchscreen\nAmbient interior lighting\nPanoramic moonroof\nAndroid Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity\nNavigation\nForward collision warning with city collision mitigation\nLane departure warning\nBlind spot warning\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nHighway Assistant driving aid\n360-degree camera system\nHead-up instrument display\nHarman Kardon surround-sound stereo\nReverse automatic emergency braking\nFour-zone automatic climate control\nHeated front and rear seats\nHeated steering wheel and armrests\nShould I Buy the 2024 BMW X6?\n\nThe BMW X6 is a sportier take on its more conventionally shaped X5 sibling. It’s also more expensive and less practical than the X5 because its sloping roofline eats into cargo space and hurts rear visibility. On the other hand, its head-turning looks and strong performance will appeal to SUV shoppers who want something that stands out in a crowd. Thanks in part to its updated and slightly edgier design, the X6 does exactly that. It also comes with a long list of standard comfort, tech and safety features.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe four-door BMW X6 gains light visual updates and two new performance packages for 2013. The five-seat X6 comes with a turbocharged six-cylinder or V-8 engine, all-wheel drive and an eight-speed automatic transmission. Competitors include the Porsche Cayenne and Land Rover Range Rover Sport.\n\nTrim levels are the six-cylinder X6 xDrive35i and the V-8 X6 xDrive50i. A turbocharged V-8 X6 M caps the lineup. BMW dropped the gas-electric ActiveHybrid X6, which garnered few sales, after 2011.\n\n(Skip to details on the: X6 M)\n\nNew for 2013\nThe 2013 X6 gains light visual changes, a new leather choice inside and two performance packages for the non-M model.\n\nExterior\nA roofline that peaks early and descends all the way to the tail distinguishes the X6. It’s a profile that cars like the less-expensive Acura ZDX have emulated. The BMW’s taillights sit high on the trunk, and the belt line sits high against short windows. The whole of it gives the X6 the look of a four-door coupe on a beefier, raised suspension.\n\nVisual changes include relocated fog lights, reshaped tailpipes and subtle changes to BMW’s twin-kidney grille. The headlights gain white caps similar to those on BMW’s other cars; here, like on the 1 Series and 6 Series coupes, the caps have embedded LED lights. Xenon headlights are standard, with adaptive LED headlights optional. An optional M Performance Package adds 20-inch alloy wheels, upgraded exterior trim and darker exhaust tips.\n\nInterior\nInside, the dashboard’s high shelf integrates gauges and a center screen. The M Performance Package adds unique doorsills, headliner and footrests. Four seats are standard; an optional three-seat rear bench raises capacity to five.\n\nCargo room behind the rear seats totals 25.6 cubic feet. Fold down the seats and the X6 has 51.2 cubic feet of room. The cargo-area figure compares favorably to BMW’s 5 Series Gran Turismo (15.0 cubic feet) and the Porsche Cayenne (23.7 cubic feet), but it trails the Range Rover Sport (33.8 cubic feet).\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe xDrive30i’s turbocharged 3.0-liter six-cylinder makes 300 horsepower and 300 pounds-feet of torque, while the xDrive50i’s turbocharged 4.4-liter V-8 is good for 400 hp and 450 pounds-feet of torque. Both engines route power through an eight-speed automatic and all-wheel drive.\n\nThe M Performance Package adds extra power this year, bumping xDrive30i output to 315 hp and 330 pounds-feet of torque. On the xDrive50i, it makes 440 hp and 480 pounds-feet of torque.\n\nSafety\nFront, side-impact and side curtain airbags are standard, as are antilock brakes and an electronic stability system.\n\nX6 M\nIntroduced in late 2009, the X6 M cranks output for the turbocharged 4.4-liter V-8 to 555 hp. Other changes include a reworked exterior with aggressive ground effects, a unique suspension and performance-oriented interior cues. While other X6s have an eight-speed automatic, the X6 M gets a six-speed auto. Back to top",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe X6, one of BMW’s recent forays into crossover territory, is a tallish fastback that the company calls a sports activity coupe. With seating for four or five depending on the setup, it’s basically a midsize crossover with four doors, extroverted styling and a choice of two powerful engines. The X6 competes roughly with the Porsche Cayenne and Mercedes-Benz M-Class. BMW’s xDrive all-wheel drive is standard, and the X6 comes in two trim levels: the xDrive35i and xDrive50i. The xDrive50i’s V-8 will propel the crossover from zero to 60 mph in just 5.3 seconds. In addition, there’s a performance-oriented X6 M and a hybrid model.\n\n(Skip to details on the: X6 M, ActiveHybrid X6)\n\nNew for 2012\nNew standard features include an iPod/USB adapter, the BMW Assist emergency communication system, auto-dimming mirrors, privacy glass, ambient lighting and heated front seats. The xDrive50i gains a universal garage door opener. Previously, the X6 came only with four seats, but a five-seat option is now available.\n\nExterior\nIf you took BMW’s Z4, raised it up and lengthened the rear quarters to add two more doors, you would get a sense of the X6’s profile. The scalloped headlights, twin kidney grille and stacked tail are classic BMW. Exterior features include:\n\n\nBlack moldings around the grille\nBoth models have a monotone front bumper\n19-inch wheels and run-flat tires\nAvailable 20-inch wheels\nStandard power liftgate\n\nInterior\nThe standard four-seat interior incorporates a shelved dashboard that houses the navigation display without adding an extra hump in the center, as many BMW dashboards do. Metallic rings grace the dual-zone climate controls, and BMW’s iDrive system operates the navigation and entertainment systems. Interior features include:\n\n\nStitched trimming on the dashboard\nCurvy gear selector finished in galvanized metal\nThree-spoke steering wheel with paddle shifters and radio controls\nAvailable four-zone climate control with separate settings for each rear passenger\nAvailable power-adjustable steering column\nStandard heated front seats; available heated rear seats\nStandard iPod/USB adapter\n\n\nUnder the Hood\nBoth engines incorporate direct fuel injection and turbocharging. The xDrive35i uses a 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder with one turbocharger, while the xDrive50i uses a 4.4-liter V-8 with two. BMW says both engines promise minimal turbo lag and a flat torque curve that begins under 2,000 rpm.\n\nTapping technology normally found in hybrids, the X6 gets regenerative braking that charges the battery when the car is braking, coasting or decelerating. BMW says this improves fuel economy up to 3 percent. Mechanical features include:\n\n\n300-horsepower, 3.0-liter six-cylinder with 300 pounds-feet of torque (xDrive35i)\n400-hp, 4.4-liter V-8 with 450 pounds-feet of torque (xDrive50i)\nEight-speed automatic transmission\nxDrive’s Dynamic Performance Control doles out power from front to rear and side to side, at least among the rear wheels\nDifferential electronically varies power proactively from a full 50/50 lock to as much as 100 percent going to either wheel to enhance performance and safety\nAdaptive Drive system electronically alters suspension’s stiffness between sport- and comfort-oriented settings to suit different driving conditions\n\nSafety\nThe xDrive50i has upgraded brakes with aluminum calipers. BMW’s Integrated Chassis Management coordinates the Dynamic Performance Control differential with stability and traction control systems to optimize the X6’s stability. Safety features include:\n\n\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes\nTraction control\nElectronic stability system\nSide-impact airbags for the front seats\nSide curtain airbags for both rows, including a tip sensor that makes them deploy for several seconds in the event of a rollover\n\nX6 M\nThe X6 M steps up from the 400-hp, 4.4-liter V-8 to a twin-turbocharged version making 555 hp. Torque is rated at 500 pounds-feet. BMW says the zero to 60 mph time is 4.5 seconds. A six-speed automatic is the only transmission offered with M-tuned Drive, Sport and Manual modes, the latter of which is activated with the console shifter or aluminum steering-wheel paddles. Other than the addition of a newly standard iPod/USB adapter, there are no significant changes for 2012.\n\nIn addition to revised suspension geometry, bushings and tuning, the M suspension lowers the X6 by almost a half-inch. BMW has also tweaked the stability system and xDrive all-wheel drive to maximize performance, more proactively shifting torque rearward when called for. A display on the instrument panel shows the driver how much power is going to each wheel. The brakes are also beefed up, with larger discs and calipers.\n\nThe X6 M doesn’t hide its special status — especially with its huge air intakes in the front bumper for cooling the brakes, water-cooled turbo intercoolers and the engine. The M also features unique 20-inch wheels, front fender vents, quad tailpipes and a rear diffuser. The side skirts are also body-colored rather than black. Back to top\n\nActiveHybrid X6\nLike other so-called two-mode hybrids, the ActiveHybrid can accelerate gradually on electric power alone, up to 37 mph in the X6’s case. All-wheel drive and a seven-speed automatic are standard. Because the high-voltage battery pack is under the cargo floor, no cargo volume is sacrificed. At nearly 5,800 pounds, however, the ActiveHybrid X6 weighs considerably more than even the X6 xDrive50i. With a combined 480 hp, the car hits 60 mph in 5.4 seconds, BMW says. Combined EPA mileage is 18 mpg — more than the 16-mpg xDrive50i, but short of the 19-mpg xDrive35i. Back to top",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in June 2008 about the xDrive 35i version of the 2008 BMW X6. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2009, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nMy wife and I had just climbed out of the X6 SUV, one of BMW’s newest models, and were walking away from it when she summed up her thoughts on its interesting shape. “It looks like an Aztek,” she scoffed, in reference to Pontiac’s often-maligned (and now discontinued) SUV. That’s sure to make BMW cringe, and while there are some similarities between the two from the outside, there’s a lot more to this new BMW than just its looks — though they are among its signature elements.\n\nWhat else, you ask? Despite its large size, it’s a respectable performer thanks to a powerful inline-six engine and taut suspension, and it has a fairly large cargo area when you consider its rakish appearance. That look does make for some compromises elsewhere, though, particularly in terms of visibility and backseat comfort.\n\nI tested the base trim level of the X6, which is called the xDrive35i, and briefly drove the V-8-powered xDrive50i.\n\nStyling\nWith the X6, BMW takes aim at a model that’s been relatively unchallenged in the SUV segment: the Infiniti FX. The FX is a true performance SUV — it shares its platform with the Nissan 350Z sports car — and it delivers a relatively engaging driving experience. Like the X6, it looks more like a coupe than an SUV, though both have four doors.\n\nThe X6 shares a number of design cues with the automaker’s X5 SUV, like a large twin-kidney grille, pointy headlights and a scalloped hood. The X6, however, strikes a more aggressive look thanks to large ports and mesh inserts in the front bumper (see a side-by-side comparison with the 2008 X5).\n\nWhen you look at the two of these models from the side, however, the similarities quickly fade. While the X5 had the traditional shape of an SUV, the X6’s roofline angles downward over the backseat, and it keeps dropping all the way to the back of the vehicle, giving the X6 coupelike styling with a twist. The twist is that this is one big vehicle, and many coupes aren’t. The massive back end of the X6 gives it a hulking presence that seems a little excessive, and the rear bumper height also makes it difficult to load cargo. Regardless of whether you like it or are of my wife’s opinion, the X6’s styling makes you choose a side.\n\nRide & Handling\nThe X6 surprised me here, and in a good way. Upon sizing up its aggressive design, you might think that this is an SUV that’s all about delivering a performance driving experience, even if it comes at the expense of ride comfort. That’s not the case at all. While the suspension is definitely firm, it doesn’t crash over large bumps in the road — which are unfortunately prevalent on the roads I frequent in Chicago — the way other cars can. What made this even more surprising was the fact that the X6 I tested came equipped with the Sport Package, which features an adaptive suspension and can have P275/40R20 performance tires in front and P315/35R20 rubber in back. Even on a sports car those would be considered extremely aggressive tires. Sharp rises in the road are met with quite a bit of suspension rebound.\n\nYou can tell BMW wants you to think of the X6 as a performance SUV from how the company has tuned its steering characteristics. Rather than having a lightweight feel to the wheel, the X6 demands that drivers flex their muscles to maneuver it. In fact, it doesn’t feel that different from the steering in BMW’s new small two-door, the 128i. The X6 responds readily to your command, and while I generally like heavier-feeling steering, non-enthusiast SUV shoppers might find it to be tedious after awhile.\n\nGoing & Stopping\nThe twin-turbo 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder that powers the X6 xDrive35i is the same engine that impressed us in the 335i and 135i, and it shows itself to be a capable SUV engine, too.\n\nEven though the six-cylinder uses two turbochargers to make its 300 horsepower and 300 pounds-feet of torque, the engine doesn’t display any of the negative characteristics in around-town driving — like power lag — that you might associate with a turbocharged engine; you just get smooth power when you press the gas pedal. Dropping the six-speed automatic transmission into its Sport mode shows off the engine’s responsiveness better than regular Drive.\n\nThe inline-six should offer plenty of power for most buyers, but BMW also sells a 400-hp X6 xDrive50i. Its 4.4-liter twin-turbo V-8 rockets this big vehicle from zero to 60 mph in 5.3 seconds, according to BMW. You can feel that quickness in everyday driving, as the V-8 moves the X6 with a degree of authority that’s surprising for a larger SUV. Even at highway speeds, if you mash the gas pedal the xDrive50i lunges forward with a level of assertiveness you don’t see in a lot of vehicles. What’s more, the V-8 sounds great whether you’re driving around town or slicing through highway traffic. It creates a smooth, deep and powerful sound.\n\nThe V-8 pairs with a six-speed automatic. It makes acceptably smooth shifts and quick kickdowns, but where it excels compared to other automatics is in the shift quickness of its clutchless-manual mode, which enhances the appeal of this feature immensely. Clutchless-manuals aren’t usually that compelling because many aren’t that responsive — you might move the gear selector to change gears then wait a second for it to happen. When you nudge the gear selector in the xDrive50i — to downshift or upshift — the gear change happens nearly instantaneously, and this makes the mode much more enjoyable to use.\n\nGas mileage for the xDrive35i is 15/20 mpg city/highway; it dips to 13/18 mpg for the xDrive50i.\n\nToward the end of my time with the X6 xDrive35i, an electrical problem cropped up that nearly brought this SUV to its knees. All of the gauges and displays in the instrument panel went dead and the drivetrain defaulted to a low-power mode in which the SUV could still be driven, but with significantly reduced responsiveness. A BMW dealer was able to bring the X6 back to health, but it was disconcerting to experience a problem this big in a new vehicle.\n\nThe X6 comes with vented disc brakes at all four corners that stop this large SUV handily. The brake pedal only needs light pressure to engage the brakes, which are easily controlled.\n\nThe Inside\nThe X6’s cabin is something of a dichotomy. The severe dashboard angles and technology-laden center console — which features a joystick-style gear selector for the automatic transmission and the iDrive control knob — might be intimidating to some drivers, but the rich, upscale materials like wood, aluminum and soft leather invite you in a way that the design might not.\n\nThe front sport seats, however, are quite comfortable. They feature wide bottom and backrest cushions, include adjustable thigh support, and are covered in leather and suedelike Alcantara.\n\nClimbing out of the driver’s seat is more of a chore than it should be; in order to swing your left leg out to reach the ground, you have to clear a wide rocker panel that without fail rubs against your pants, even when you’re trying to avoid it. This has always been a problem with the X5, especially in dusty regions and on road-salt-covered winter roads.\n\nMost SUVs have a bench seat in the second row, but the X6 has two bucket seats, so its maximum seating capacity is just four. There’s a center console between the rear seats that has cupholders, storage bins and a 12-volt power outlet. There’s decent legroom in the backseat, but the X6’s sloping roof noticeably encroaches on headroom. The rear door openings and the position of the bucket seats make graceful exits difficult.\n\nAnother downside of the X6’s coupelike shape is poor rear visibility; the rear window is a mere slit in the rearview mirror.\n\nCargo\nDespite the X6’s sloping back end, the SUV has more cargo room than a two-row X5: 25.5 cubic feet as opposed to the X5’s 21.9 cubic feet. The FX, meanwhile, has 24.8 cubic feet of space. If you need more room, the X6’s split-folding backseat folds down nearly flat with the cargo floor to make 59.7 cubic feet of space.\n\nSafety\nAs of publication, the X6 hasn’t been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. The SUV comes with a number of standard safety features, including antilock brakes, side-impact airbags for the front seats, side curtain airbags, active front head restraints and an electronic stability system.\n\nX6 in the Market\nYou might be thinking to yourself: Why is BMW coming out with another SUV? Well, the South Carolina-built X5 has been a solid seller for BMW, giving the brand a foothold in the SUV segment, but the X6, which is built alongside the X5, seems to better align with BMW’s Ultimate Driving Machine motto. From its looks to its performance, the X6 holds to the idea of a driver’s car more closely than the X5, but it does so without losing traditional SUV characteristics, like a taller seating position and cargo versatility.\n\nThe X6 goes up against an established competitor in the FX, which Infiniti has refined for 2009. The driving experience in the FX is much the same as the X6, but what’s sure to appeal to many people looking for a performance SUV is the all-wheel-drive FX’s significantly lower starting price, which is about $10,000 less than the X6’s $52,500 base price. That’s a big difference, even in this part of the market.\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2020 BMW X6 M50i doesn’t make a lot of sense, but its superb powertrain and technology make it enjoyable anyway.\n\nVersus the competition: The X6 M50i doesn’t have trouble keeping up with its competitors, but some of them offer better handling, like the Porsche Cayenne.\n\nRelated: Redone 2020 BMW X6 ‘Coupe’ a Rakish Take on 2019 X5 SUV\n\nThe BMW X6 has always puzzled me, as have the rest of its even-numbered BMW SUV brethren. My tongue-in-cheek reasoning for their existence is that BMW wanted to make sure it covered all the numbers; that’s why we get an X2, X4 and X6, which are all oddly shaped mutations of the original X1, X3 and X5 SUV triumvirate. But these days it seems the more SUVs a company can put out, the better — “if you build it, they will come” and all that.\n\nFor 2020, the X6 gets a full redesign that feels familiar. That’s because its updates follow those of the 2019 X5, which was redesigned a year prior. These two SUVs have a lot in common, including the same powertrains, wheelbase and technology — just with different bodies on top. The X5 is a more traditional SUV, with high sides and big windows all around, while the X6 has more of a fastback, coupe-esque shape to it, with a roofline that peaks right above the steering wheel and quickly tapers back. The X6 competes against other powerful five-seat, coupe-shaped SUVs, like the Mercedes-AMG GLE 63, Jaguar F-Pace and Porsche Cayenne Coupe (and eventually the Audi SQ8, which is still to come).\n\nThere are three X6 variants: 40i, M50i and X6 M. The 40i comes with the smallest engine: a 335-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder that makes 330 pounds-feet of torque. It’s available with rear- or all-wheel drive. The M50i is a big jump up in power, with a 523-hp, turbocharged 4.4-liter V-8 that makes 553 pounds-feet of torque. The M50i also adds standard AWD. The X6 M is the most bonkers of the three, with a high-performance version of the M50i’s engine that bumps output up to 600 hp. All come with an eight-speed automatic transmission.\n\nI tested the middle child, the M50i, though it’s closer in nature to the X6 M than the 40i (200 more hp leaves quite a gap between those two models). What I found was that it’s not necessary to understand the X6 to enjoy the hell out of it.\n\nGiddy-Up: Speed and 0-60\n\nThe X6’s V-8, like much of the X6, isn’t new to me. I’ve tested the engine in the 8 Series M850i and X7 M50i, and I’ve tested its technology and safety features throughout the BMW lineup. In this instance, familiarity doesn’t breed contempt; it’s more like anticipation. The strength of its powertrain is what makes the X6 fun to drive.\n\nThere’s no reason a vehicle this big should move the way the X6 does. It zips forward with supreme indifference. You start off tentatively, but the easy way it accelerates at half throttle gives you cause to bury your foot into the gas pedal — and then it hurls forward like a meteor. Here one second, gone the next: 60 mph comes in an estimated 4.1 seconds, which is very impressive for a 5,115-pound vehicle.\n\nThe X6 isn’t quite as at home on a winding road, especially under braking. Trying to get the vehicle to slow down quickly to prepare for a corner results in a lot of nosedive. Though it feels stable when you stand on the brake pedal, I could also feel the back end of the X6 get a little light. My test vehicle came with the Dynamic Handling Package ($2,600), which added active roll stabilization, an adaptive M suspension and active steering. Yet even with all that electronic wizardry working underneath it, the X6 doesn’t feel agile. It will do the dance steps you ask of it, for the most part, but without great enthusiasm and with plenty of body roll. The throttle response indicates a good deal of athleticism, but curves expose the X6’s SUV soul. I also wished for some more feedback from the steering, as I do from most BMWs these days.\n\nRide quality is good — especially in the more comfortable driving modes — despite the large (and optional) 22-inch wheels on the SUV I drove. It turns the X6 into a rather good touring vehicle, minus its fuel economy. The X6’s EPA estimates are 21/26/23 mpg city/highway/combined for the RWD 40i and 20/26/22 mpg with AWD. The M50i is even worse, at 16/22/18 mpg. While a long drive might be comfortable for driver and passenger alike, it’ll take a bunch of premium fuel to complete.\n\nInterior and Technology\n\nThe interior has no surprises. It uses BMW’s latest iDrive control system, with a standard 12.3-inch touchscreen that can also be operated by a rotary controller to the right of the gear selector. I find the touchscreen to be an easier way to use the system, but it’s kind of far to reach without leaning forward a little. For simpler tasks I found myself using the knob, especially while driving, or the steering-wheel controls. Flipping through radio stations or changing audio sources can be done via another 12.3-inch screen (also standard) that replaces the traditional instrument panel, or through an optional head-up display. \n\nAndroid Auto is still not offered (though that will be changing soon). Apple CarPlay comes standard and now without a fee (after BMW came to its senses).\n\nDespite what the roofline may suggest, passenger room is decent in the backseat, and there are good sight lines. The sides don’t dip down that far, and the window gets larger as you move forward, so it feels less claustrophobic than I had feared. Legroom is ample for adult passengers; a couple of 6-foot adults fit back-to-back (driver and driver-side rear passenger) without issue. \n\nThat doesn’t mean visibility is great for the driver, though: The blind spots over each shoulder are manageable, but looking directly rearward is a problem thanks to that sharply slanted rear window. It’s not so bad on the road, but low-speed maneuvers in tight spaces are difficult because you won’t be able to see any short objects behind you. BMW’s 360-degree camera system, which is quite good, is almost a must on this vehicle. It’s included in the Parking Assistance Package ($700), and it’s an option box I’d check on any X6.\n\n2020 BMW X6 M50i | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\nA Price That’s Gonna Cost You\n\nLike other expensive luxury vehicles, there’s a huge price range for the X6. The 40i starts at $65,295 (including destination charges), while the M50i starts more than $20K higher, at $86,645. All that speed doesn’t come cheap. On top of that, my test vehicle added various option packages and those 22-inch alloy wheels, pushing the final price tag to $99,645. \n\nThe X6’s safety features include standard blind spot warning, forward automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning, and front and rear parking sensors. Notably missing from that list are adaptive cruise control, lane-keep assist and the 360-degree cameras I found so essential. Some of those optional features are standard on much more affordable cars, and others can be added on their own, not just by getting expensive option packages on higher trim levels (I’m thinking of our Hyundai Palisade in particular). I hope luxury makes start following that trend soon.\n\n2019 BMW X5 | Cars.com photos by Joe Bruzek\nWhy Not an X5?\n\nThis ends up being the biggest question about the X6, given it doesn’t seem to have any of the hidden sports car essence its shape might suggest. The X5’s M50i trim level starts $3,500 less, has more cargo room (33.9 cubic feet behind the rear seat vs. 27.4 cubic feet) and a roomier cabin. With equal feature sets and powertrains, it’s hard to give the X6 an edge in any quantitative sense. \n\nThat being said, personal preferences and styling have to be taken into account. One of my favorite things to say to folks looking at buying a car is, “buy what you like.” If your heart says to get the X6 because you like the way it looks, go for it. Maybe a traditional SUV isn’t what you want. There’s goofy fun in big vehicles that go fast, and the X6 M50i certainly fits that bill.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe X6, one of BMW’s recent forays into SUV territory, is a tallish fastback that the company calls a sports activity coupe. With seating for four, it’s basically a midsize SUV with four doors, extroverted styling and a choice of two powerful engines. The X6 competes roughly with the Porsche Cayenne and Mercedes M-Class. BMW’s xDrive all-wheel drive is standard, and the X6 comes in two trim levels: the xDrive35i and xDrive50i. Both models seat four, and the xDrive50i’s V-8 will propel the SUV from zero to 60 mph in just 5.3 seconds.\n\n(Skip to details on the: BMW X6 M, BMW ActiveHybrid X6)\n\nNew for 2011\nA new eight-speed automatic transmission is standard on the 2011 models and replaces a six-speed automatic. The xDrive35i has BMW’s new single-turbo 3.0-liter inline six-cylinder (replacing a twin-turbo). Tapping technology normally found in hybrids, the 2011 X6 gets regenerative braking that charges the battery only when the car is braking, coasting or decelerating. BMW says this improves fuel economy up to 3 percent.\n\nExterior\nIf you took BMW’s Z4, raised it up and lengthened the rear quarters to add two more doors, you would get something of the X6’s profile. The scalloped headlights, twin kidney grilles and stacked tail are classic BMW.\n\nBlack moldings around the grille\nBoth models have a monotone front bumper, which is an upscale departure from the black inlays used on the X3 and X5\n19-inch wheels and run-flat tires\nAvailable 20-inch wheels\n\nInterior\nThe four-seat interior incorporates a shelved dashboard that houses the navigation display without adding an extra hump in the center, as many BMW dashboards do. Metallic rings grace the dual-zone climate controls, and BMW’s iDrive system operates the navigation and entertainment systems.\n\nStitched trimming on the dashboard\nCurvy gear selector finished in galvanized metal\nThree-spoke steering wheel with paddle shifters and radio controls\nStandard power liftgate\nAvailable four-zone climate control with separate settings for each rear passenger\nAvailable power-operated steering column\nAvailable heated front and rear seats\n\nUnder the Hood\nBoth engines incorporate direct fuel injection and turbocharging. The xDrive35i uses a new 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder with one turbocharger, while the xDrive50i uses a 4.4-liter V-8 with two. Power ratings are unchanged on the new six-cylinder, but BMW says it is more efficient. BMW says both engines promise minimal turbo lag and a flat torque curve that begins under 2,000 rpm.\n\n300-horsepower, 3.0-liter six-cylinder with 300 pounds-feet of torque (xDrive35i)\n400-hp, 4.4-liter eight-cylinder with 450 pounds-feet of torque (xDrive50i)\nNew eight-speed automatic transmission\nxDrive’s Dynamic Performance Control doles out power from front to rear and side to side, at least among the rear wheels\nDifferential electronically varies power proactively from a full 50/50 lock to as much as 100 percent going to either wheel to enhance performance and safety\nAdaptive Drive system electronically alters suspension’s stiffness between sport- and comfort-oriented settings to suit different driving conditions\n\nSafety\nThe xDrive50i has upgraded brakes with aluminum calipers. BMW’s Integrated Chassis Management coordinates the Dynamic Performance Control differential with stability and traction control systems to optimize the X6’s stability. Safety features include:\n\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes\nTraction control\nElectronic stability system\nSide-impact airbags for the front seats\nSide curtain airbags for both rows, including a tip sensor that makes them deploy for several seconds during a rollover\n\nBMW X6 M\nThe X6 M steps up from the 400-hp, 4.4-liter V-8 to a twin-turbocharged version making 555 hp. Torque is rated at 500 pounds-feet. BMW says the zero to 60 mph time is 4.5 seconds. A six-speed automatic is the only transmission offered with M-tuned Drive, Sport and Manual modes, the latter of which is activated with the console shifter or aluminum steering-wheel paddles. For 2011, there are no significant changes.\n\nIn addition to revised suspension geometry, bushings and tuning, the M suspension lowers the X6 by almost a half-inch. BMW has also tweaked the stability system and xDrive all-wheel drive to maximize performance, more proactively shifting torque rearward when called for. A display on the instrument panel shows the driver how much power is going to each wheel. The brakes are also beefed up, with larger discs and calipers.\n\nThe X6 M doesn’t hide its special status — especially with its huge air intakes in the front bumper for cooling the brakes, water-cooled turbo intercoolers as well as the engine. The M also features unique 20-inch wheels, front fender vents, quad tailpipes and rear diffuser. The side skirts are also body colored rather than black. Back to top\n\nBMW ActiveHybrid X6\nLike other so-called two-mode hybrids, the ActiveHybrid can accelerate gradually on electric power alone, up to 37 mph in the X6’s case. All-wheel drive and a seven-speed automatic are standard. Because the high-voltage battery pack is under the cargo floor, no hatch volume is sacrificed. But at nearly 5,800 pounds, the X6 ActiveHybrid weighs considerably more than even the X6 xDrive50i. With a combined 480 hp, the car hits 60 mph in 5.4 seconds, BMW says. Combined EPA mileage is 18 mpg — more than the 16-mpg xDrive50i, but short of the 19-mpg xDrive35i. Back to top",

      "expert_review": "Crow tastes better with the right seasoning.\n\nAfter writing a less-than-favorable review of the 2010 BMW 5 Series GT, I had visions of putting Mangus Hirschfield behind the wheel of the 2010 X6 M.\n\nBMW refers to the X6 as a sports activity coupe but that has always felt disingenuous. The vehicle has more doors (five) than seats (four), and its gangly body makes it look like a lunar rover. The X6 seems to have an identity crisis.\n\nHirshcfield, a German sexologist in the early 1900s, might be able to help; after all, he did coin the term transvestism. I figured he could help wade through the perils of judging something by its cover.\n\nBut after a day of driving the X6 M, I realized you just can’t spell Adam’s Apple with an M. Looks aren’t everything; even in today’s hyper-shallow world.\n\nSomewhere south of Saginaw, I was well over the suggested speed along Interstate 75. It was pouring rain and there were semi trucks in the left and right lanes in front of me.\n\nSplitting big rigs on the edges of three lanes is never fun. Add to that the blinding wall of water both kicked back, and I thought I might be trapped behind them all the way to Grand Blanc.\n\nBut then I tapped the aluminum paddle shifter twice, dropping the X6 M into fourth gear, and it roared with laughter — pulling all 555 horsepower from its 4.4-liter twin turbocharged V-8. I was through the crease faster than Barry Sanders.\n\nThe acceleration above 70 mph is fantastic. BMW includes a new twin scroll twin turbos with a crossover exhaust manifold, which obviously sounds very important. The result is a clean, efficient power boost that launches this vehicle whenever you want to. Who doesn’t want 500 pound-feet of delicious torque at his or her beck and call? People who don’t drive M’s, that’s who.\n\nBut that power wouldn’t have anywhere to go if the lightning-fast six-speed automatic transmission wasn’t so silky. The electronic shift mounted between the two front seats is still a little awkward.\n\nThree different drive modes\n\nThere are three different modes that the transmission works under: Drive, Sport or Manual. Sport mode provides a more aggressive shifting, holding gears longer and letting you stay in the engine’s power curve longer. Manual mode lets you become downright abusive — riding gears right to redline. (It’s smart enough to not let you blow the engine, though, I had to see what would happen.)\n\nBut most of the time, I drove the X6 M in Drive mode, using the paddle shifters when I wanted to get a little extra power, then moving it back into the automatic mode.\n\nEven Hirschfield would approve of the X6 M’s dual personality. It’s one thing during the day, and a completely different one on hot corners.\n\nThe more I drove it, the more I wanted to push this car-like trucky thing. One of the first BMWs with an all-wheel drive system, the X6 M sticks nicely to the road through big and little turns.\n\nThe ride was excellent. The X6 M comes standard with BMW’s adaptive drive, which combines electronic dampening control and active roll stabilization. This system is constantly monitoring what’s happening, what kind of inputs the driver is providing and what the road is saying. Then it adjusts. Of course, the 20-inch high performance tires and big brakes make the X6 M brake like a roadster.\n\nBMW’s Servotronic steering is firm and makes you want to drive faster. It’s speed sensitive, but can be set for regular driving or sport driving, which tightens it up a little more. The X6 M just feels right on the road.\n\nPlush, comfortable interior\n\nAnd I felt as if all was right sitting in this truck-like car thing. The interior is beautiful.\n\nThe white Merino leather seats are plush and comfortable. (Though I would never own a vehicle with white interior anything due to Dunkin’ Donuts coffee sloshing and Big Mac lettuce spillage.) The M seats provide extra bolstering for hard corners.\n\nOf course, this being an M, BMW feels obligated to remind you why you plunked down $90,000 for it. There’s the M door sill, M steering wheel, M floor mats, M head rests and the M center console. Forrest Mars never saw this many M&Ms, and he holds the patent for them.\n\nBut even with the so many Ms around the cabin, nothing feels in your face or overstated. The cabin feels luxurious with a touch of speed. The lines are long and horizontal and covered in leather. It’s stable and there’s a simplicity inside that calms your nerves at the times you need a steady hand and confidence, like barreling between two big trucks.\n\nEasy to operate iDrive\n\nThen there’s the iDrive.\n\nAfter testing a series of BMW’s this year, I am starting to take a more German approach to the iDrive. Americans are just stupid.\n\nPlease don’t be offended by that if you are not the brightest LED in the headlamp, but there’s an owner’s manual in the glove box and not everything good in life needs to be figured out in three minutes with the lights off. The iDrive provides lots of function. It’s easy to operate and lets you keep your hand on the wheel while you’re doing it.\n\nIf you get stumped, look it up. BMW writes one in English.\n\nThere are, of course, all of the premium features you’d expect on the X6 M: The standard glass roof, the dual climate zones in front — and you can get dual climate zones in the second row too.\n\nThere’s a heads-up display that includes navigation guidance, cruise control settings and, of course, your speed. There are automatic high beams that adjust to oncoming traffic.\n\nThen there is the back-up camera system. This provides a bird’s eye view of the vehicle and everything around it. It comes on automatically when you put the vehicle in reverse and can be turned on when you select the parking distance control button. It’s excellent for seeing what’s right in front of you as well, such as pulling into a tight space or a garage.\n\nDriving pleasure\n\nDriving the X6 M changed the way I looked at this vehicle.\n\nSome of that gangly look disappeared as the vehicle’s performance matured my perception. It has a toughness, a meanness too that it didn’t have before. It may not be pretty or sexy, but it’s certainly handsome in the same way Tom Petty is handsome.\n\nHirschfield would, no doubt, be proud of the way I grew during a week of testing the X6 M.\n\nIt still may only seat four people, but my advice is to just not be the fifth person invited to ride in it.\n\nThe X6 M earns its M badge by what it can do, not by how it looks.\n\nsburgess@detnews.com (313) 223-3217\n\nReport Card\n\nOverall: ****\n\nExterior: Good. Angular design is smart and clean and stance is aggressive. Subtle M badges only add to the mystique.\n\nInterior: Excellent. Both rows provide about the same comfort, which is excellent. Lots of techy features that fit in with the stunning design.\n\nPerformance: Excellent: From the extra cool rear view back-up system to the 555 horsepower, the X6 M is one of the biggest sports cars around.\n\nPros: Excellent handling, great steering and tons of power.\n\nCons: A price tag that tops $90,000.\n\nGrading Scale\n\n**** Excellent *** Good ** Fair * Poor",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in May 2015 about the 2015 BMW X6. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2016, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe BMW X6 makes absolutely no sense. It has all the performance-sapping mass and heft of an X5 SUV, with none of that car’s passenger- or cargo-carrying usefulness.\n\nBMW would like you to believe that this is a coupe. Never mind that it’s enormous and rides tall or that it has four full-sized doors and a hatchback. But since the German epidemic of labeling vehicles like this as coupes shows no signs of abating, we’ll just nod and smile and quietly roll our eyes at this obvious silliness. What the X6 really is, is a BMW X5 SUV that’s had its top chopped, its cargo and headroom slashed, and its body modestly restyled — all for more money than BMW wants for an X5.\n\nThere haven’t been any significant changes for 2015 (compare the 2014 and 2015 models here) aside from the addition of a rear-wheel-drive version; previous X6s have been all-wheel drive only. So at first glance the X6 seems like a ridiculous proposition. It begs the question: Could its driving experience somehow redeem it?\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe X6 is a provocative vehicle in much the same way the Pontiac Aztek was — some people get it, most people don’t, but everyone has an opinion about the way it looks. It’s obviously a BMW, with its signature twin grille, its swept-back headlights and its high taillights, but the overall silhouette causes everyone to pause to consider exactly what they’re looking at.\n\nIt reminds me of a toy I had as a child called a Stomper “FunX4.” It was a little electric monster truck that had interchangeable bodies, and my favorite thing was to take a car body and put it over the truck frame. That seems to be what BMW has done here, as well. Whether the look is successful is another matter. Inevitably, everyone stands back and gazes at the X6, scratches their head, and ponders, “What the heck is that?”\n\nHow It Drives\nUnder its curvy sheet metal, the bones of the X6 come from the X5 SUV, which is itself basically a high-riding BMW 5 Series wagon. As such, it handles and behaves much as the X5 does. The mass of its body structure combines with its high seating position to create body roll when cornering — it feels heavy because it is.\n\nThe standard engine in the X6 is a twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder pumping out a decent 300 horsepower. It moves the X6 from zero to 60 mph in a quick 6 seconds, BMW says. It doesn’t feel that quick, however, given the size and heft of the truck.\n\nLike most BMWs, it feels more responsive when the adjustable driving mode is switched to Sport, but its sports-car looks simply aren’t matched by sports-car performance. If you want something tighter, quicker and faster, that handles better, you’ll have to opt for the X6 M and its 567-hp, twin-turbocharged V-8 engine and dedicated sports-oriented parts.\n\nStopping power from the X6’s big, grabby brakes is more than adequate and well-matched to the X6’s ability to be driven fast. While the X6 can be driven fast, it’s unlikely to be, given its heft. Where that mass comes in handy is in ride quality, which was excellent despite my test car’s 20-inch wheels.\n\nWhat is most assuredly not excellent in the X6 is the horrible wind noise. There’s a whistling shriek from the side mirrors that pierces the cabin when you have the windows open, even just a crack. It’s particularly troublesome at speeds below 40 mph, and you’ll hear the same noise from each side of the car. Something about the X6’s aerodynamics and the airflow over the mirrors causes it, and it is truly horrible.\n\nCompetitors are similar in form, most notably the nearly identical-looking upcoming 2016 Mercedes-Benz GLE Coupe. Based on the GLE (formerly ML-Class) SUV, the GLE Coupe features a 362-hp, twin-turbocharged V-6, a nine-speed automatic and standard all-wheel drive. It outguns the 300-hp X6 but is so similar in nearly every other way that calling it a copycat model is not hyperbole. The Porsche Macan also fits the bill as an X6 competitor, even though it’s slightly smaller and a little less expensive (to start). That model is basically the only real competitor the X6 has right now; the old Acura ZDX mercifully got the ax for the 2014 model year, leaving the X6 to soldier on as a unique offering in the industry — at least until the GLE Coupe gets here.\n\nFuel economy is fair for such a big, heavy truck. The X6 xDrive35i is rated 18/27/21 mpg city/highway/combined. If you forgo all-wheel drive, which is easy to do in places that don’t get much in the way of inclement weather, you can boost your fuel economy slightly to 19/27/22 mpg. Opting for the bigger, V-8 powered, all-wheel-drive X6 xDrive50i drops fuel economy to 15/22/17 mpg, which is not so stellar.\n\nThe Land Rover Range Rover Sport is a decent competitor, featuring a standard supercharged 3.0-liter V-6. It earned a 17/22/19 mpg rating, significantly worse than the X6, but features a more powerful engine. Information for the Mercedes-Benz GLE Coupe was unfortunately not yet available at the time of this writing.\n\nInterior\nInside, the X6 I drove had a few optional upgrades that made the cabin more luxurious and opulent than a typical base model. It’s already slightly sportier inside than your standard X5 SUV, despite sharing most of the interior trim between the two. It featured a Cognac Interior Design Package, which brings special seat trim in Nappa leather, contrasting brown with the gray overall trim. It’s not what I would call classy, but it is distinctive.\n\nThe seats themselves are wonderfully comfortable up front, with 10-way adjustment — but getting into them isn’t as easy as you might think. The X6’s high ride height combines with a low roofline to make getting in and out a contortionist’s act, even for front occupants. Backseat passengers have an even lower roofline to deal with, making it even more challenging to get in and out without hitting your head.\n\nOnce inside, the front seats are comfortable, with heaters, high adjustability and plenty of width, but the backseat is again an issue, thanks to confining headroom and a smaller window that makes it feel dark and confined back there.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz GLE Coupe is a much nicer place to be, with materials and shapes that make it look much more luxurious than the X6. For a comparable price, the seats are more bolstered, the surfaces are covered in higher-quality leather and the wood trim looks more like wood should. This isn’t to say the X6 is bad; it’s just that the GLE Coupe looks and feels a step better. The Macan is also a step up from how the X6 feels and can be optioned up to ridiculous levels of wood, leather, metal and carbon, as is typical of Porsche. It’s more cramped in back than the X6, however; it doesn’t feature the same kind of room for either passengers or cargo.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nBMW includes a considerable amount of technology in the X6, but as with all German luxury cars the high-end gadgets cost extra despite the car’s already high sticker price. My test car included options like a head-up display, keyless entry, four-zone climate control, satellite radio, heated rear seats and side- and top-view cameras. Their inclusion makes for a well-equipped vehicle, however, and the way BMW lays out the controls continues to be intuitive and simple to use. Strangely, despite the X6’s lofty sticker price, a premium audio system was not included on my test car, but the base system is acceptable.\n\nA navigation system is standard on the X6, with a 10.2-inch, high-resolution screen situated high in the dash. The associated iDrive controller knob mounted low on the center console is easy to use without having to hunt for buttons. On-screen menus are clear and easy to navigate; BMW has had a lot of time to get the ergonomics of its control systems right, and its work has paid off.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThis is where the X6 really starts to run into trouble. The price, mass and equipment all say “SUV,” but the cargo area says “sport sedan.” Cargo room for the X6 is 26.6 cubic feet behind the rear seats, expandable to 59.7 cubic feet with the rear seats folded. The X5 has considerably more room, with 35.8 cubic feet behind the rear seats, expanding to a maximum of 76.7 cubic feet. No information is yet available on the interior size of the Mercedes-Benz GLE Coupe, but the Range Rover Sport features a similar 27.7 cubic feet behind the rear seats, expandable to 62.2 cubic feet maximum. As for towing, the X6 maxes out at 6,000 pounds, while the Range Rover Sport manages a bit more, rated to tow a 7,716-pound trailer.\n\nSafety\nThe BMW X6 had not been crash-tested as of publication.\n\nStandard safety features include only basic equipment, like a full complement of airbags, front and rear parking sensors and a 10-year subscription to the BMW Assist eCall concierge service. Just about all other electronic safety features are optional, including the Driver Assistance Package with a backup camera and head-up display, radar-based cruise control, forward collision warning with autonomous braking, blind spot warning and more. See a list of all the X6’s standard safety features here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nSo in the end we have an SUV-sized “coupe” that doesn’t do the things the X5 does, but costs more. Starting price for a rear-wheel-drive X6 sDrive35i is $60,550, including a destination fee. That price bumps up to $62,850 if you upgrade to the all-wheel-drive xDrive35i model. Going for a V-8-powered xDrive50i will cost $73,850 to start, a hefty premium for the bigger engine and more standard features. My xDrive35i added $550 for Mineral White paint, $2,500 for the xLine trim, $1,950 for Cognac leather interior trim, $550 for a Cold Weather Package, $1,400 for a Driver Assistance Package, $1,300 for a Premium Package (including keyless entry, satellite radio and four-zone climate control), $1,500 for multicontour seats, $750 for LED fog lights, and $750 for side- and top-view cameras, for a grand total of $73,200. Price an X6 your way here.\n\nThe X6’s main competitor, the 2016 Mercedes-Benz GLE Coupe, isn’t on the market just yet but is expected in late 2015. It will likely be priced a bit higher than the X6, if tradition holds. The initial launch version will be the GLE 450 AMG Sport Coupe, powered by a 362-hp, twin-turbocharged V-6. That will make it more powerful than a six-cylinder X6 but less powerful than the V-8 version. The Porsche Cayenne is slightly bigger and more expensive than the X6 and more a match for the X5 M, but the smaller Macan doesn’t match either (it’s too small). The Land Rover Range Rover Sport is a good match, however; it’s priced almost identically and is nearly the same size, as well. It’s slightly larger than the X6, but not much, and is meant to compete for the same sporty-SUV-intending buyers. See how it stacks up against the X6 here.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2020 BMW X6 M50i doesn’t make a lot of sense, but its superb powertrain and technology make it enjoyable anyway.\n\nVersus the competition: The X6 M50i doesn’t have trouble keeping up with its competitors, but some of them offer better handling, like the Porsche Cayenne.\n\nRelated: Redone 2020 BMW X6 ‘Coupe’ a Rakish Take on 2019 X5 SUV\n\nThe BMW X6 has always puzzled me, as have the rest of its even-numbered BMW SUV brethren. My tongue-in-cheek reasoning for their existence is that BMW wanted to make sure it covered all the numbers; that’s why we get an X2, X4 and X6, which are all oddly shaped mutations of the original X1, X3 and X5 SUV triumvirate. But these days it seems the more SUVs a company can put out, the better — “if you build it, they will come” and all that.\n\nFor 2020, the X6 gets a full redesign that feels familiar. That’s because its updates follow those of the 2019 X5, which was redesigned a year prior. These two SUVs have a lot in common, including the same powertrains, wheelbase and technology — just with different bodies on top. The X5 is a more traditional SUV, with high sides and big windows all around, while the X6 has more of a fastback, coupe-esque shape to it, with a roofline that peaks right above the steering wheel and quickly tapers back. The X6 competes against other powerful five-seat, coupe-shaped SUVs, like the Mercedes-AMG GLE 63, Jaguar F-Pace and Porsche Cayenne Coupe (and eventually the Audi SQ8, which is still to come).\n\nThere are three X6 variants: 40i, M50i and X6 M. The 40i comes with the smallest engine: a 335-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder that makes 330 pounds-feet of torque. It’s available with rear- or all-wheel drive. The M50i is a big jump up in power, with a 523-hp, turbocharged 4.4-liter V-8 that makes 553 pounds-feet of torque. The M50i also adds standard AWD. The X6 M is the most bonkers of the three, with a high-performance version of the M50i’s engine that bumps output up to 600 hp. All come with an eight-speed automatic transmission.\n\nI tested the middle child, the M50i, though it’s closer in nature to the X6 M than the 40i (200 more hp leaves quite a gap between those two models). What I found was that it’s not necessary to understand the X6 to enjoy the hell out of it.\n\nGiddy-Up: Speed and 0-60\n\nThe X6’s V-8, like much of the X6, isn’t new to me. I’ve tested the engine in the 8 Series M850i and X7 M50i, and I’ve tested its technology and safety features throughout the BMW lineup. In this instance, familiarity doesn’t breed contempt; it’s more like anticipation. The strength of its powertrain is what makes the X6 fun to drive.\n\nThere’s no reason a vehicle this big should move the way the X6 does. It zips forward with supreme indifference. You start off tentatively, but the easy way it accelerates at half throttle gives you cause to bury your foot into the gas pedal — and then it hurls forward like a meteor. Here one second, gone the next: 60 mph comes in an estimated 4.1 seconds, which is very impressive for a 5,115-pound vehicle.\n\nThe X6 isn’t quite as at home on a winding road, especially under braking. Trying to get the vehicle to slow down quickly to prepare for a corner results in a lot of nosedive. Though it feels stable when you stand on the brake pedal, I could also feel the back end of the X6 get a little light. My test vehicle came with the Dynamic Handling Package ($2,600), which added active roll stabilization, an adaptive M suspension and active steering. Yet even with all that electronic wizardry working underneath it, the X6 doesn’t feel agile. It will do the dance steps you ask of it, for the most part, but without great enthusiasm and with plenty of body roll. The throttle response indicates a good deal of athleticism, but curves expose the X6’s SUV soul. I also wished for some more feedback from the steering, as I do from most BMWs these days.\n\nRide quality is good — especially in the more comfortable driving modes — despite the large (and optional) 22-inch wheels on the SUV I drove. It turns the X6 into a rather good touring vehicle, minus its fuel economy. The X6’s EPA estimates are 21/26/23 mpg city/highway/combined for the RWD 40i and 20/26/22 mpg with AWD. The M50i is even worse, at 16/22/18 mpg. While a long drive might be comfortable for driver and passenger alike, it’ll take a bunch of premium fuel to complete.\n\nInterior and Technology\n\nThe interior has no surprises. It uses BMW’s latest iDrive control system, with a standard 12.3-inch touchscreen that can also be operated by a rotary controller to the right of the gear selector. I find the touchscreen to be an easier way to use the system, but it’s kind of far to reach without leaning forward a little. For simpler tasks I found myself using the knob, especially while driving, or the steering-wheel controls. Flipping through radio stations or changing audio sources can be done via another 12.3-inch screen (also standard) that replaces the traditional instrument panel, or through an optional head-up display. \n\nAndroid Auto is still not offered (though that will be changing soon). Apple CarPlay comes standard and now without a fee (after BMW came to its senses).\n\nDespite what the roofline may suggest, passenger room is decent in the backseat, and there are good sight lines. The sides don’t dip down that far, and the window gets larger as you move forward, so it feels less claustrophobic than I had feared. Legroom is ample for adult passengers; a couple of 6-foot adults fit back-to-back (driver and driver-side rear passenger) without issue. \n\nThat doesn’t mean visibility is great for the driver, though: The blind spots over each shoulder are manageable, but looking directly rearward is a problem thanks to that sharply slanted rear window. It’s not so bad on the road, but low-speed maneuvers in tight spaces are difficult because you won’t be able to see any short objects behind you. BMW’s 360-degree camera system, which is quite good, is almost a must on this vehicle. It’s included in the Parking Assistance Package ($700), and it’s an option box I’d check on any X6.\n\n2020 BMW X6 M50i | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\nA Price That’s Gonna Cost You\n\nLike other expensive luxury vehicles, there’s a huge price range for the X6. The 40i starts at $65,295 (including destination charges), while the M50i starts more than $20K higher, at $86,645. All that speed doesn’t come cheap. On top of that, my test vehicle added various option packages and those 22-inch alloy wheels, pushing the final price tag to $99,645. \n\nThe X6’s safety features include standard blind spot warning, forward automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning, and front and rear parking sensors. Notably missing from that list are adaptive cruise control, lane-keep assist and the 360-degree cameras I found so essential. Some of those optional features are standard on much more affordable cars, and others can be added on their own, not just by getting expensive option packages on higher trim levels (I’m thinking of our Hyundai Palisade in particular). I hope luxury makes start following that trend soon.\n\n2019 BMW X5 | Cars.com photos by Joe Bruzek\nWhy Not an X5?\n\nThis ends up being the biggest question about the X6, given it doesn’t seem to have any of the hidden sports car essence its shape might suggest. The X5’s M50i trim level starts $3,500 less, has more cargo room (33.9 cubic feet behind the rear seat vs. 27.4 cubic feet) and a roomier cabin. With equal feature sets and powertrains, it’s hard to give the X6 an edge in any quantitative sense. \n\nThat being said, personal preferences and styling have to be taken into account. One of my favorite things to say to folks looking at buying a car is, “buy what you like.” If your heart says to get the X6 because you like the way it looks, go for it. Maybe a traditional SUV isn’t what you want. There’s goofy fun in big vehicles that go fast, and the X6 M50i certainly fits that bill.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The BMW X6 makes absolutely no sense. It has all the performance-sapping mass and heft of an X5 SUV, with none of that car’s passenger- or cargo-carrying usefulness.\n\nBMW would like you to believe that this is a coupe. Never mind that it’s enormous and rides tall or that it has four full-sized doors and a hatchback. But since the German epidemic of labeling vehicles like this as coupes shows no signs of abating, we’ll just nod and smile and quietly roll our eyes at this obvious silliness. What the X6 really is, is a BMW X5 SUV that’s had its top chopped, its cargo and headroom slashed, and its body modestly restyled — all for more money than BMW wants for an X5.\n\nThere haven’t been any significant changes for 2015 (compare the 2014 and 2015 models here) aside from the addition of a rear-wheel-drive version; previous X6s have been all-wheel drive only. So at first glance the X6 seems like a ridiculous proposition. It begs the question: Could its driving experience somehow redeem it?\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe X6 is a provocative vehicle in much the same way the Pontiac Aztek was — some people get it, most people don’t, but everyone has an opinion about the way it looks. It’s obviously a BMW, with its signature twin grille, its swept-back headlights and its high taillights, but the overall silhouette causes everyone to pause to consider exactly what they’re looking at.\n\nIt reminds me of a toy I had as a child called a Stomper “FunX4.” It was a little electric monster truck that had interchangeable bodies, and my favorite thing was to take a car body and put it over the truck frame. That seems to be what BMW has done here, as well. Whether the look is successful is another matter. Inevitably, everyone stands back and gazes at the X6, scratches their head, and ponders, “What the heck is that?”\n\nHow It Drives\nUnder its curvy sheet metal, the bones of the X6 come from the X5 SUV, which is itself basically a high-riding BMW 5 Series wagon. As such, it handles and behaves much as the X5 does. The mass of its body structure combines with its high seating position to create body roll when cornering — it feels heavy because it is.\n\nThe standard engine in the X6 is a twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder pumping out a decent 300 horsepower. It moves the X6 from zero to 60 mph in a quick 6 seconds, BMW says. It doesn’t feel that quick, however, given the size and heft of the truck.\n\nLike most BMWs, it feels more responsive when the adjustable driving mode is switched to Sport, but its sports-car looks simply aren’t matched by sports-car performance. If you want something tighter, quicker and faster, that handles better, you’ll have to opt for the X6 M and its 567-hp, twin-turbocharged V-8 engine and dedicated sports-oriented parts.\n\nStopping power from the X6’s big, grabby brakes is more than adequate and well-matched to the X6’s ability to be driven fast. While the X6 can be driven fast, it’s unlikely to be, given its heft. Where that mass comes in handy is in ride quality, which was excellent despite my test car’s 20-inch wheels.\n\nWhat is most assuredly not excellent in the X6 is the horrible wind noise. There’s a whistling shriek from the side mirrors that pierces the cabin when you have the windows open, even just a crack. It’s particularly troublesome at speeds below 40 mph, and you’ll hear the same noise from each side of the car. Something about the X6’s aerodynamics and the airflow over the mirrors causes it, and it is truly horrible.\n\nCompetitors are similar in form, most notably the nearly identical-looking upcoming 2016 Mercedes-Benz GLE Coupe. Based on the GLE (formerly ML-Class) SUV, the GLE Coupe features a 362-hp, twin-turbocharged V-6, a nine-speed automatic and standard all-wheel drive. It outguns the 300-hp X6 but is so similar in nearly every other way that calling it a copycat model is not hyperbole. The Porsche Macan also fits the bill as an X6 competitor, even though it’s slightly smaller and a little less expensive (to start). That model is basically the only real competitor the X6 has right now; the old Acura ZDX mercifully got the ax for the 2014 model year, leaving the X6 to soldier on as a unique offering in the industry — at least until the GLE Coupe gets here.\n\nFuel economy is fair for such a big, heavy truck. The X6 xDrive35i is rated 18/27/21 mpg city/highway/combined. If you forgo all-wheel drive, which is easy to do in places that don’t get much in the way of inclement weather, you can boost your fuel economy slightly to 19/27/22 mpg. Opting for the bigger, V-8 powered, all-wheel-drive X6 xDrive50i drops fuel economy to 15/22/17 mpg, which is not so stellar.\n\nThe Land Rover Range Rover Sport is a decent competitor, featuring a standard supercharged 3.0-liter V-6. It earned a 17/22/19 mpg rating, significantly worse than the X6, but features a more powerful engine. Information for the Mercedes-Benz GLE Coupe was unfortunately not yet available at the time of this writing.\n\nInterior\nInside, the X6 I drove had a few optional upgrades that made the cabin more luxurious and opulent than a typical base model. It’s already slightly sportier inside than your standard X5 SUV, despite sharing most of the interior trim between the two. It featured a Cognac Interior Design Package, which brings special seat trim in Nappa leather, contrasting brown with the gray overall trim. It’s not what I would call classy, but it is distinctive.\n\nThe seats themselves are wonderfully comfortable up front, with 10-way adjustment — but getting into them isn’t as easy as you might think. The X6’s high ride height combines with a low roofline to make getting in and out a contortionist’s act, even for front occupants. Backseat passengers have an even lower roofline to deal with, making it even more challenging to get in and out without hitting your head.\n\nOnce inside, the front seats are comfortable, with heaters, high adjustability and plenty of width, but the backseat is again an issue, thanks to confining headroom and a smaller window that makes it feel dark and confined back there.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz GLE Coupe is a much nicer place to be, with materials and shapes that make it look much more luxurious than the X6. For a comparable price, the seats are more bolstered, the surfaces are covered in higher-quality leather and the wood trim looks more like wood should. This isn’t to say the X6 is bad; it’s just that the GLE Coupe looks and feels a step better. The Macan is also a step up from how the X6 feels and can be optioned up to ridiculous levels of wood, leather, metal and carbon, as is typical of Porsche. It’s more cramped in back than the X6, however; it doesn’t feature the same kind of room for either passengers or cargo.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nBMW includes a considerable amount of technology in the X6, but as with all German luxury cars the high-end gadgets cost extra despite the car’s already high sticker price. My test car included options like a head-up display, keyless entry, four-zone climate control, satellite radio, heated rear seats and side- and top-view cameras. Their inclusion makes for a well-equipped vehicle, however, and the way BMW lays out the controls continues to be intuitive and simple to use. Strangely, despite the X6’s lofty sticker price, a premium audio system was not included on my test car, but the base system is acceptable.\n\nA navigation system is standard on the X6, with a 10.2-inch, high-resolution screen situated high in the dash. The associated iDrive controller knob mounted low on the center console is easy to use without having to hunt for buttons. On-screen menus are clear and easy to navigate; BMW has had a lot of time to get the ergonomics of its control systems right, and its work has paid off.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThis is where the X6 really starts to run into trouble. The price, mass and equipment all say “SUV,” but the cargo area says “sport sedan.” Cargo room for the X6 is 26.6 cubic feet behind the rear seats, expandable to 59.7 cubic feet with the rear seats folded. The X5 has considerably more room, with 35.8 cubic feet behind the rear seats, expanding to a maximum of 76.7 cubic feet. No information is yet available on the interior size of the Mercedes-Benz GLE Coupe, but the Range Rover Sport features a similar 27.7 cubic feet behind the rear seats, expandable to 62.2 cubic feet maximum. As for towing, the X6 maxes out at 6,000 pounds, while the Range Rover Sport manages a bit more, rated to tow a 7,716-pound trailer.\n\nSafety\nThe BMW X6 had not been crash-tested as of publication.\n\nStandard safety features include only basic equipment, like a full complement of airbags, front and rear parking sensors and a 10-year subscription to the BMW Assist eCall concierge service. Just about all other electronic safety features are optional, including the Driver Assistance Package with a backup camera and head-up display, radar-based cruise control, forward collision warning with autonomous braking, blind spot warning and more. See a list of all the X6’s standard safety features here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nSo in the end we have an SUV-sized “coupe” that doesn’t do the things the X5 does, but costs more. Starting price for a rear-wheel-drive X6 sDrive35i is $60,550, including a destination fee. That price bumps up to $62,850 if you upgrade to the all-wheel-drive xDrive35i model. Going for a V-8-powered xDrive50i will cost $73,850 to start, a hefty premium for the bigger engine and more standard features. My xDrive35i added $550 for Mineral White paint, $2,500 for the xLine trim, $1,950 for Cognac leather interior trim, $550 for a Cold Weather Package, $1,400 for a Driver Assistance Package, $1,300 for a Premium Package (including keyless entry, satellite radio and four-zone climate control), $1,500 for multicontour seats, $750 for LED fog lights, and $750 for side- and top-view cameras, for a grand total of $73,200.\n\nThe X6’s main competitor, the 2016 Mercedes-Benz GLE Coupe, isn’t on the market just yet but is expected in late 2015. It will likely be priced a bit higher than the X6, if tradition holds. The initial launch version will be the GLE 450 AMG Sport Coupe, powered by a 362-hp, twin-turbocharged V-6. That will make it more powerful than a six-cylinder X6 but less powerful than the V-8 version. The Porsche Cayenne is slightly bigger and more expensive than the X6 and more a match for the X5 M, but the smaller Macan doesn’t match either (it’s too small). The Land Rover Range Rover Sport is a good match, however; it’s priced almost identically and is nearly the same size, as well. It’s slightly larger than the X6, but not much, and is meant to compete for the same sporty-SUV-intending buyers. See how it stacks up against the X6 here.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 BMW X6?\n\nThe BMW X6 blends a coupe-like appearance with SUV attributes. It seats up to five people and is available in rear- and all-wheel-drive form. A 300-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six engine is standard, while a 445-hp, twin-turbocharged 4.4-liter V-8 is optional. A high-performance X6 M that makes 567 hp is also offered. All trim levels use an eight-speed automatic transmission. Competitors include the Audi Q8 and Maserati Levante.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2019 BMW X6?\n\nApple CarPlay is standard, but unlike other automakers, BMW makes the connectivity feature subscription-based after an initial one-year trial. New standard active safety features include forward collision warning with pedestrian detection, low-speed automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning and blind spot warning.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 BMW X6 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include adaptive headlights, power-folding side mirrors, a power liftgate, leather upholstery, heated front seats, navigation with a 10.2-inch touchscreen, a power moonroof, dual-zone automatic air conditioning and front and rear parking sensors.\n\nAvailable features include LED headlights with automatic high beams, Nappa leather upholstery, ventilated front seats, heated rear seats, a heated steering wheel, a 360-degree camera system, a head-up display, a Bang & Olufsen premium stereo, adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability, night vision and an adaptive suspension.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 BMW X6?\n\nThe X6 favors style over traditional SUV practicality, and that has its consequences. Backseat headroom and cargo space are limited, as is rear visibility. On the plus side, the X6 delivers strong acceleration and good ride comfort.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2020 BMW X6 M50i doesn’t make a lot of sense, but its superb powertrain and technology make it enjoyable anyway.\n\nVersus the competition: The X6 M50i doesn’t have trouble keeping up with its competitors, but some of them offer better handling, like the Porsche Cayenne.\n\nRelated: Redone 2020 BMW X6 ‘Coupe’ a Rakish Take on 2019 X5 SUV\n\nThe BMW X6 has always puzzled me, as have the rest of its even-numbered BMW SUV brethren. My tongue-in-cheek reasoning for their existence is that BMW wanted to make sure it covered all the numbers; that’s why we get an X2, X4 and X6, which are all oddly shaped mutations of the original X1, X3 and X5 SUV triumvirate. But these days it seems the more SUVs a company can put out, the better — “if you build it, they will come” and all that.\n\nFor 2020, the X6 gets a full redesign that feels familiar. That’s because its updates follow those of the 2019 X5, which was redesigned a year prior. These two SUVs have a lot in common, including the same powertrains, wheelbase and technology — just with different bodies on top. The X5 is a more traditional SUV, with high sides and big windows all around, while the X6 has more of a fastback, coupe-esque shape to it, with a roofline that peaks right above the steering wheel and quickly tapers back. The X6 competes against other powerful five-seat, coupe-shaped SUVs, like the Mercedes-AMG GLE 63, Jaguar F-Pace and Porsche Cayenne Coupe (and eventually the Audi SQ8, which is still to come).\n\nThere are three X6 variants: 40i, M50i and X6 M. The 40i comes with the smallest engine: a 335-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder that makes 330 pounds-feet of torque. It’s available with rear- or all-wheel drive. The M50i is a big jump up in power, with a 523-hp, turbocharged 4.4-liter V-8 that makes 553 pounds-feet of torque. The M50i also adds standard AWD. The X6 M is the most bonkers of the three, with a high-performance version of the M50i’s engine that bumps output up to 600 hp. All come with an eight-speed automatic transmission.\n\nI tested the middle child, the M50i, though it’s closer in nature to the X6 M than the 40i (200 more hp leaves quite a gap between those two models). What I found was that it’s not necessary to understand the X6 to enjoy the hell out of it.\n\nGiddy-Up: Speed and 0-60\n\nThe X6’s V-8, like much of the X6, isn’t new to me. I’ve tested the engine in the 8 Series M850i and X7 M50i, and I’ve tested its technology and safety features throughout the BMW lineup. In this instance, familiarity doesn’t breed contempt; it’s more like anticipation. The strength of its powertrain is what makes the X6 fun to drive.\n\nThere’s no reason a vehicle this big should move the way the X6 does. It zips forward with supreme indifference. You start off tentatively, but the easy way it accelerates at half throttle gives you cause to bury your foot into the gas pedal — and then it hurls forward like a meteor. Here one second, gone the next: 60 mph comes in an estimated 4.1 seconds, which is very impressive for a 5,115-pound vehicle.\n\nThe X6 isn’t quite as at home on a winding road, especially under braking. Trying to get the vehicle to slow down quickly to prepare for a corner results in a lot of nosedive. Though it feels stable when you stand on the brake pedal, I could also feel the back end of the X6 get a little light. My test vehicle came with the Dynamic Handling Package ($2,600), which added active roll stabilization, an adaptive M suspension and active steering. Yet even with all that electronic wizardry working underneath it, the X6 doesn’t feel agile. It will do the dance steps you ask of it, for the most part, but without great enthusiasm and with plenty of body roll. The throttle response indicates a good deal of athleticism, but curves expose the X6’s SUV soul. I also wished for some more feedback from the steering, as I do from most BMWs these days.\n\nRide quality is good — especially in the more comfortable driving modes — despite the large (and optional) 22-inch wheels on the SUV I drove. It turns the X6 into a rather good touring vehicle, minus its fuel economy. The X6’s EPA estimates are 21/26/23 mpg city/highway/combined for the RWD 40i and 20/26/22 mpg with AWD. The M50i is even worse, at 16/22/18 mpg. While a long drive might be comfortable for driver and passenger alike, it’ll take a bunch of premium fuel to complete.\n\nInterior and Technology\n\nThe interior has no surprises. It uses BMW’s latest iDrive control system, with a standard 12.3-inch touchscreen that can also be operated by a rotary controller to the right of the gear selector. I find the touchscreen to be an easier way to use the system, but it’s kind of far to reach without leaning forward a little. For simpler tasks I found myself using the knob, especially while driving, or the steering-wheel controls. Flipping through radio stations or changing audio sources can be done via another 12.3-inch screen (also standard) that replaces the traditional instrument panel, or through an optional head-up display. \n\nAndroid Auto is still not offered (though that will be changing soon). Apple CarPlay comes standard and now without a fee (after BMW came to its senses).\n\nDespite what the roofline may suggest, passenger room is decent in the backseat, and there are good sight lines. The sides don’t dip down that far, and the window gets larger as you move forward, so it feels less claustrophobic than I had feared. Legroom is ample for adult passengers; a couple of 6-foot adults fit back-to-back (driver and driver-side rear passenger) without issue. \n\nThat doesn’t mean visibility is great for the driver, though: The blind spots over each shoulder are manageable, but looking directly rearward is a problem thanks to that sharply slanted rear window. It’s not so bad on the road, but low-speed maneuvers in tight spaces are difficult because you won’t be able to see any short objects behind you. BMW’s 360-degree camera system, which is quite good, is almost a must on this vehicle. It’s included in the Parking Assistance Package ($700), and it’s an option box I’d check on any X6.\n\n2020 BMW X6 M50i | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\nA Price That’s Gonna Cost You\n\nLike other expensive luxury vehicles, there’s a huge price range for the X6. The 40i starts at $65,295 (including destination charges), while the M50i starts more than $20K higher, at $86,645. All that speed doesn’t come cheap. On top of that, my test vehicle added various option packages and those 22-inch alloy wheels, pushing the final price tag to $99,645. \n\nThe X6’s safety features include standard blind spot warning, forward automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning, and front and rear parking sensors. Notably missing from that list are adaptive cruise control, lane-keep assist and the 360-degree cameras I found so essential. Some of those optional features are standard on much more affordable cars, and others can be added on their own, not just by getting expensive option packages on higher trim levels (I’m thinking of our Hyundai Palisade in particular). I hope luxury makes start following that trend soon.\n\n2019 BMW X5 | Cars.com photos by Joe Bruzek\nWhy Not an X5?\n\nThis ends up being the biggest question about the X6, given it doesn’t seem to have any of the hidden sports car essence its shape might suggest. The X5’s M50i trim level starts $3,500 less, has more cargo room (33.9 cubic feet behind the rear seat vs. 27.4 cubic feet) and a roomier cabin. With equal feature sets and powertrains, it’s hard to give the X6 an edge in any quantitative sense. \n\nThat being said, personal preferences and styling have to be taken into account. One of my favorite things to say to folks looking at buying a car is, “buy what you like.” If your heart says to get the X6 because you like the way it looks, go for it. Maybe a traditional SUV isn’t what you want. There’s goofy fun in big vehicles that go fast, and the X6 M50i certainly fits that bill.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
