      "expert_review": "The verdict: The redesigned 2023 BMW X1 is a polished and plucky small SUV that delivers spirited acceleration, engaging road manners and a new multimedia system that’s both tech-forward and straightforward.\n\nVersus the competition: The X1 is one of the more fun-to-drive vehicles in the luxury compact SUV class, and it further stands out with decent interior room, above-average fuel efficiency and a winning multimedia system.\n\nWith its 2023 redesign, the third-generation BMW X1 has grown in size and now boasts a fresh face, more power and a new multimedia system (compare it with the outgoing version). It competes in the luxury compact SUV class against the likes of the Audi Q3, Cadillac XT4 and Mercedes-Benz GLA; see them compared.\n\nRelated: 2023 BMW X1: BMW’s Littlest SUV Grows Up With New Tech, More Power\n\nModern Multimedia\n\nA much-needed multimedia update makes the new X1’s controls more tech-focused and less fussy, and it’s a winning formula. I’ve long been annoyed by some hallmarks of BMW’s multimedia system, including the distracting rotary iDrive knob, a lack of traditional buttons and its puzzling menus. The new X1, however, uses the latest version of BMW’s iDrive 8 operating system, and it’s thankfully missing all those things. Instead, you’ll find straightforward menus, customizable screens and a responsive touchscreen. It also offers loads of tech-forward functionality — most of it useful, some of it gimmicky.\n\nThe new setup pairs a 10.7-inch touchscreen in the center of the dashboard with a 10.25-inch digital instrument panel ahead of the driver — similar to what’s in BMW’s new iX and i4 electric vehicles. The screens blend together and are curved toward the driver, making for a slick look and ergonomically friendly usability.\n\nBetween the front seats (in the space where the old iDrive controller resided) is a new floating console with a shifter toggle and volume thumbwheel, plus touch-sensitive panels for tuning the radio and engaging different drive modes. The layout is intuitive and the controls are refreshingly well placed and responsive.\n\nWhat’s missing, however, are physical controls for climate functions; that’s almost entirely controlled via the touchscreen. It’s not a deal breaker, but it’d be nice to have a few key climate buttons under the screen. Even so, the climate controls are overall easy to find and quick to engage via that screen.\n\nWireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay are standard, and they worked seamlessly during my test. Unlike in some vehicles with horizontally oriented screens, the X1’s Android Auto interface uses the whole screen, allowing you to see multiple apps at once with no wasted space. Navigation is also standard, but BMW’s impressive augmented reality functionality is optional. With it, a live video stream from the driver’s perspective is displayed on the center screen, with animated arrows overlaid at junctions for turn-by-turn visual support.\n\nThis setup brings both pros and cons. I appreciated the clarity and specificity of the directions projected onto the touchscreen; Mercedes also does this very well in many of its newer vehicles, but Mercedes also clearly projects those arrows onto the head-up display. Navigation graphics in the X1’s available head-up display, on the other hand, look dated and are confusing; I ended up turning it off and defaulting to my Android Auto nav, which shows simpler directions in the head-up display.\n\nI found the X1’s voice command functionality to be accurate and useful. Just push the microphone button or say “Hey BMW” to activate it, and the system is able to perform a wide array of functions, from changing the radio station to lowering the windows. It has its limitations, however, and some of them are odd. For one, the windows can be rolled down via voice, but they can’t be rolled back up — likely a safety move.\n\nThe X1 works with the My BMW App for enhanced connectivity between your smartphone and your SUV. Owners can use it to locate the vehicle, lock and unlock the doors, and engage the X1’s optional Digital Key Plus feature, which enables drivers to automatically lock and unlock and operate the X1 with their iPhone.  The app also connects with BMW’s optional Remote Theft Recorder system, which can record video images from the X1’s 360-degree and interior camera systems and notify the car’s owner via the app if a break-in is attempted. The interior camera can also take pictures of the car’s cabin and display them in the app. Helpful feature for checking if a bag was left behind, or creepy way to spy on your passengers? We’ll let you decide.\n\nPlucky, Dynamic Road Manners\n\nThere’s a lot to like behind the wheel of the X1 — as long as you’re on the right kind of road. Power feels potent and delivery is aggressive from a stop. If it seems like it has a bit more oomph than before, you’re right: The sole powertrain for 2023 is a 241-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder gas engine; the previous X1 had a 228-hp four-cylinder. This is a bit more  power than you’ll get in base versions of the XT4 and GLA, and it’s a lot more than the base Q3’s 184 hp (though an uplevel variant of that vehicle makes 228 hp). Last year’s eight-speed automatic transmission has been replaced with a new seven-speed dual-clutch automatic. Also gone is the front-wheel-drive model; BMW’s xDrive all-wheel-drive system is now standard, and there’s just one trim level: xDrive28i.\n\nAfter brief lag, power is quick from a stop, especially in Sport mode. The seven-speed transmission, however, can be a little too eager for my liking; power delivery isn’t exactly smooth. Driving around town, shift timing can feel busy, and the shifts themselves are abrupt. The automatic engine stop-start system (which can be turned off, though the setting is buried in the touchscreen ) piles on with a laggy, lurchy quality. Power delivery on the highway is much smoother and more predictable, with plenty of reserves for effortless passing and merging.\n\nThe X1’s dynamic road manners really come through around town thanks to firm, reactive steering and precise, controlled cornering. It’s agile, maneuverable and delivers an engaging, connected-to-the-road feel that adds some exhilaration to everyday errands — until you hit a pothole. Suspension tuning is on the firm side, and that shows up big time courtesy of even the smallest potholes. While the X1 never became unsettled during my testing, ride composure was sometimes an issue. That said, some of that may have been due to my test model’s larger 19-inch wheels, which are available with the xLine Package; 18-inch wheels and tires are standard. An adaptive suspension is available with the M Sport Package, but the X1 comes standard with a fixed suspension.\n\nIn addition to a bump in horsepower for 2023, the X1’s combined fuel economy has also risen slightly, by 2 mpg. The 2023 X1 is EPA-rated 25/34/28  mpg city/highway/combined, which is better than AWD versions of the Cadillac XT4 (22/29/24  mpg) and Mercedes-Benz GLA (23/32/26  mpg). The Audi Q3, which has standard AWD, is rated 21/28/24 or 22/29/25 mpg, depending on model.\n\nSo-So Interior Room\n\nThe X1 is a compact SUV, so it’s no surprise the backseat is a bit snug. While it did grow a bit in some dimensions for 2023, the new model has the same overall passenger volume as the outgoing version.\n\nThe X1 has a bit more  backseat headroom than its competitors, but there’s less rear legroom than you’ll find in the XT4 and GLA. Two smaller adults will fit comfortably back there, but putting someone in the middle spot is not advisable — even a car seat. It’s narrow, straddles a floor hump and has a seat belt attached at the ceiling, which blocks the driver’s rear view. If you’re not carrying people back there, you can improve rear visibility by flipping down the head restraints. However, the X1’s easy-access Latch anchors and removable head restraints make car-seat installation in the outboard rear seats a breeze. Read our full Car Seat Check for more details.\n\nThe new model’s added size also fails to translate to increased cargo room. In fact, it has a bit less cargo room than the old X1, according to the automaker’s measurements . In practice, however, there’s ample room for a grocery run. BMW says there’s 25.7 cubic feet of space behind the backseat, which is a little more than you’ll find in the Q3 and XT4 and much more than in the GLA. The backseat also folds in a 40/20/40 split, which is useful when you need to carry long items and two people in back.\n\nThe X1 also does well when it comes to small-items storage. The sides of the cargo area include two handy spaces for containing smaller items, and there’s a large bin under the gear selector that will fit a small to medium-size bag. There’s also a narrow bin under the front armrest. A vertical phone holder under the central touchscreen can solidly secure a phone via a clip, though I worry the phone’s high visibility in that spot would become distracting. The space doubles as a wireless charging pad on models where that option has been added.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nWhat’s New With SUVs for 2023?\nHands to Yourself: 2023 BMW X3 Removes Gesture Control\n2024 BMW X5, X6 M Competitions: Hybrid V-8 Promises Efficiency Boost\nResearch SUVs\nShop for a 2023 BMW X1\nSafety and Value\n\nStandard active-safety features include blind spot warning, lane departure warning, parking sensors, and front collision warning with automatic emergency braking. An optional Driving Assistance Professional Package adds adaptive cruise control, active lane keeping with side collision avoidance, front cross-traffic alert and BMW’s Extended Traffic Jam Assistant system, which allows attentive hands-free driving at speeds up to 40 mph on limited-access highways. Other options include an updated version of BMW’s Parking Assistant Plus system, which can automatically park the vehicle in a parallel or perpendicular parking space.\n\nThe 2023 BMW X1 starts at $40,095  (all prices include destination), an increase over the 2022 X1 xDrive28i. That’s a little more than some competitors start, though the XT4 ($37,490)  and GLA ($38,650 ) have standard front-wheel drive, so it makes sense they cost less to start. The 2023 Audi Q3 starts at $40,395, but a less expensive version with the smaller engine, the Q3 40 TFSI, is expected to go on sale in the spring starting at $37,995.\n\nWhile the price is up, it’s not for nothing: The upcharge comes with upgrades that help make the new X1 a leader in the premium compact SUV class.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2020 BMW X1 delights with powertrain pep and on-road poise, but its multimedia system is a big-time frustration.\n\nVersus the competition: Like several others in the class, the X1 deftly combines luxury and fun, rising above the crowd in terms of roominess and fuel economy but sinking below the rest in multimedia usability.\n\nRelated: How Do Car Seats Fit in a 2020 BMW X1?\n\nThe X1 is BMW’s smallest SUV and seats five. It got some minor styling tweaks for 2020, including a larger version of the automaker’s kidney grille, punctuated by updated LED headlights and a more muscular bumper. See it compared with last year’s version.\n\nIt goes head to head against the likes of the Audi Q3, Cadillac XT4 and Volvo XC40; compare them.\n\nLively Engine, Playful Feel\n\nDriving the X1 was a delight. After just a hint of lag, the turbocharged 2.0-liter engine was lively from a stop, and clean, snappy shifts from the eight-speed automatic quickly furnished more power. For 2020, BMW revised the transmission’s gear ratios for quicker performance, with 0-60 mph acceleration now happening in 6.3 seconds for the all-wheel-drive X1 xDrive28i and 6.6 seconds in the X1 sDrive28i, BMW says.\n\nPopping the X1 into Sport mode (via a button near the center console) amped up the level of engagement with increased accelerator response and firmer steering. Eco mode did the opposite, dulling throttle to benefit fuel economy; Comfort mode splits the difference.\n\nEspecially in Sport mode, the X1 is as spirited as the Q3 and more playful than the XC40, with a firm, controlled ride to complement direct steering and an overall feeling of nimbleness. Its small turning radius made short work of parking maneuvers. Buyers can opt for an M Sport suspension for more dialed-in road manners.\n\nIt also rises above the rest in fuel economy. In base two-wheel-drive trim, the X1 gets an EPA-estimated 24/33/27 mpg city/highway/combined, a smidge better than 2WD versions of the Cadillac XT4 (24/30/26 mpg) and Volvo XC40 (23/33/27 mpg), and a lot better than a base Audi Q3 (19/27/22 mpg), though that car  has standard all-wheel drive. Like the others, the X1 is available with all-wheel drive; there’s a small mileage penalty, however, of 1 mpg combined.\n\nThere are a few blemishes on the X1’s road manners. First, the automatic engine stop-start system needs work. Where the rest of the powertrain is smooth overall, the system shudders to life awkwardly. Second, the X1’s taut suspension and stiff ride don’t play nicely with bumpy roads. Lastly, noise isolation could be better; quite a bit of road and wind noise make their way into the cabin.\n\nControl Woes\n\nWhile the exterior got an update for 2020, not much changed on the inside this year aside from some new contrast stitching for the imitation leather seats and surfaces. As before, the cabin waves its luxury-car flag with lovely gloss wood paneling and leather trim. A few cheap spots stand out, like some hard plastic on the door, but the overall vibe is quality.\n\nWhat needs an update (another one) is BMW’s multimedia system. Last year’s standard 6.5-inch display is gone, replaced by the previously optional 8.8-inch unit, which is now standard. It comes with navigation and Apple CarPlay compatibility but no Android Auto (a problem for me).\n\nMore problems: The X1’s multimedia system bundles navigation, radio, phone and the car’s overall systems menu, all controlled by a rotary knob. The system is both distracting and annoying to control via the console-area knob, which I also found ergonomically challenging to reach. Eschewing the knob for the touchscreen solves some of that, but the system’s menu structure isn’t very straightforward, so tasks that should be simple — such as opening your favorites menu or switching the station — require several steps.\n\nAudi, Cadillac and Volvo all approach multimedia systems in different ways, and after sampling many of them, the X1’s is the most confounding — and it has one of the smallest screens.\n\nUn-Compact-Sized Room\n\nIn both rows, the seats are comfy and space is more generous than the car’s compact dimensions suggest. The X1 has more rear headroom than competitors and more rear legroom than all but the XT4.\n\nThis played out when installing child-safety seats. The X1 had ample space for two of them — even space-hogging rear-facing car seats — and exposed Latch anchors made installation a breeze. Check out our full Car Seat Check.\n\nBehind the rear seats, there’s 27.1 cubic feet of space — plenty for a full load of groceries for my family of five and significantly more than the Q3 (23.7), XT4 (22.3) or XC40 (20.7) offer. With the seats folded, the X1 has 58.7 cubic feet of space, once again more than its competitors; there’s also a pass-through for carrying longer items.\n\nSafety and Value\n\nThe 2020 BMW X1 received five stars from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and top crashworthiness scores from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, but it did not pass that organization’s vehicle-to-pedestrian front crash prevention test.\n\nIn safety features, the X1 is well equipped, with standards like low-speed forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning and automatic high-beam headlights. One of the X1’s safety blind spots is that you can’t get blind spot monitoring. Another is that other driver assistance and safety features, including adaptive cruise control ($1,000), can get expensive.\n\nThe 2020 BMW X1 starts at $36,195 as a base sDrive28i with front-wheel drive. That’s a little more than the Audi Q3 (impressive for Audi given the Q3 comes with standard all-wheel drive) and Volvo XC40, but slightly less than a Cadillac XT4 (all prices include destination charges).\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The redesigned BMW X1 is astonishingly practical, but it’s less of an ultimate driving machine than the automaker’s faithful may care for.\n\nVersus the competition: Given it’s a BMW, the X1’s unremarkable drivability is shocking, but it delivers in spades what many other subcompact luxury SUVs sacrifice: actual utility.\n\nThe second generation of BMW’s smallest SUV drops its predecessor’s performance hallmarks: near-perfect weight distribution and an available turbo six-cylinder that made the X1 more rocket ship than SUV. We drove the 2016 X1’s sole variant, the xDrive28i (compare it with the 2015 BMW X1 here).\n\nExterior and Styling\nBMW’s redesign adds some much-needed sophistication versus the old X1, which was a hodgepodge of ungainly proportions and oversized elements. (To me, anyway.) Proportioned and styled like a miniature X5, the new SUV-like X1 is shorter than its predecessor from bumper to bumper, but also taller, wider and slightly lighter. It’s on the larger side of German body-type rivals like the Audi Q3 and Mercedes-Benz GLA250. For similar money, though, the Acura RDX and Lexus NX dwarf the whole group.\n\nShoppers will appreciate the X1’s best-in-group turning circle, which is a tidy 37.4 feet. Eighteen-inch alloy wheels, fog lights and LED daytime running lights are standard. Full-LED headlights and 19-inch alloys are optional.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe BMW X1’s turbo four-cylinder (228 horsepower, 258 pounds-feet of torque) has adequate power for just about all situations, but noticeable — and inconsistent — accelerator lag hampers things from a standstill. Still, once you get past the initial gremlins, power comes early and stays late, and the standard 8-speed automatic transmission finds the right gear without too much delay.\n\nAt highway speeds, noise insulation is up to luxury-car snuff. Ride quality from the X1’s standard M Sport suspension is characteristic of BMW, with good isolation at higher speeds but somewhat firm response to individual bumps. It’s appropriate for a premium SUV and stops short of being uncomfortable — unlike the brittle GLA250 or busy NX — but I still find the Q3’s masterful ride quality tops.\n\nSure to disappoint BMW fans, however, spirited driving reveals the X1’s downfalls. On wet pavement, hard acceleration induces lots of front wheelspin before the driveline sends power to the rear. Throw the SUV around corners, and it feels as nose-heavy as any SUV from a not-so-premium Detroit or Japanese brand. The steering has a degree of slop that’s on par with them, too, and a soft, mushy brake pedal further blunts the BMW X1’s reflexes.\n\nIndeed, this redesign shifts a lot more weight over the front axle than the previous X1 — a near-inevitable outcome of BMW moving the BMW X1 from its rear-drive past to a new, front-drive platform. Such underpinnings need not sentence a car to lackluster handling (see the GLA-Class, for example), but the X1’s foundation does just that. You don’t need to take the SUV to the racetrack to figure it out: In ordinary spirited driving, the X1 handles like a grocery-getter SUV, even with various driving modes dialed to their sportiest settings. It begs to be driven slower.\n\nInterior\nRedemption comes inside. Most subcompact SUVs are known for being skinny on utility, but the X1 would impress even in a larger class. An upright windshield, tall windows and fold-forward backseat head restraints lend excellent visibility, aided by a higher seating position to begin with. BMW says it raised the seating position by more than an inch up front and 2.5 inches in back versus the 2015. Larger adults may find the lower cushions too small, but the chairs themselves have excellent adjustment range, and a low center tunnel clears out plenty of knee and thigh space. Power-adjustable front seats with a memory driver’s seat and faux-leather upholstery are standard. Heated seats, a panoramic moonroof and real leather seats are optional.\n\nCabin materials are stepped up a notch from the old X1’s evident cost-cutting — for a luxury model, anyway — with uniform finishes in most areas above knee level. I also welcome the return of a bona fide mechanical gearshift. The previous X1’s electronic shifter, in all its lifeless artificiality, is gone. Other BMWs should follow suit.\n\nThe backseat’s bottom cushions are a bit short for taller adults, but the space is otherwise excellent. Legroom and headroom are both good, and the bench seat has a nice, high position off the floor. The backseat has optional manual adjustments (a $300 stand-alone option) that enable 30 degrees of reclining and 5 inches of sliding.\n\nErgonomics and Electronics\nThe standard audio setup includes a 6.5-inch multimedia screen and BMW’s iDrive controller. Bluetooth phone and audio streaming, HD radio, a USB input and steering-wheel audio controls are also standard. A basic navigation system, satellite radio and Harman Kardon surround-sound premium audio are optional. A Technology Package with navigation and an upsized screen (8.8 inches) is optional; it also adds a touchpad to the iDrive controller for you to scrawl letters or numbers — a feature I’ve found little use for in other cars.\n\nA head-up display is optional. BMW’s ConnectedDrive Services portal integrates various apps (Glympse, Spotify, Pandora and more) from a compatible smartphone into the multimedia system; some features require a ConnectedDrive monthly subscription. Dedicated smartphone portals like Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are unavailable right now, but BMW says it’s looking into integrating both.\n\nCargo and Storage\nPracticality continues in terms of storage. A small cubby near the cupholders provides convenient open storage; the door pockets and center console are roomy for this class. The rear seats fold in a 40/20/40 split, and optional power-folding rear seats are operable from the cargo area. A power liftgate is standard.\n\nCargo space behind the rear seats amounts to a very good 27.1 cubic feet, with 58.7 cubic feet of maximum room when the seats are down. Both figures are impressive for the segment.\n\nSafety\nThe BMW X1 has yet to be crash-tested. Click here to see a full list of safety features. Notable options include lane departure warning and forward collision warning with automatic braking, both part of a $700 Driver Assistance Plus Package. A backup camera — something many cheaper SUVs include standard — comes in a $1,150 Driver Assistance Package. C’mon, BMW.\n\nValue in Its Class\nUnlike many immediate front-wheel-drive or rear-wheel-drive competitors, the X1 has standard all-wheel drive — and its starting price, at a relatively steep $35,795 with destination, reflects that. Go to town with options, and a loaded X1 can top $50,000. That’s a stratosphere only the GLA250 reaches.\n\nThe lack of a cheaper two-wheel-drive model will turn some shoppers away from the X1, particularly in Sun Belt states. Whether BMW’s latest SUV attracts others depends on how much drivability matters to them. BMW’s performance tradition is clearly missing, but practicality has taken its place. The redesigned X1 is BMW’s take on a Toyota RAV4 or Honda CR-V — a quicker one with better cabin materials, to be sure, but still a shopping-mall SUV that prioritizes utility over driving fun.\n\nMy prediction? Shoppers won’t care one bit. Practicality-minded SUVs are selling like gangbusters right now, and for all their novelty, too many subcompact luxury SUVs have too many practical compromises. The reimagined BMW X1 will cause fits among some enthusiasts, but I suspect it’s the right move. Among the broader horde of SUV shoppers, BMW’s latest should do just fine.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 BMW X1?\n\nThe X1 is BMW’s smallest SUV, styled in line with its larger X3 sibling. It wears the brand’s large, dual-kidney grille, and pronounced fender flares add to its muscular look. Power comes from a standard 228-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that works with an eight-speed automatic transmission. Front- and all-wheel-drive versions are offered, and competitors include the Audi Q3 and Volvo XC40.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2019 BMW X1?\n\nNew standard active safety features include low-speed automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning, automatic high-beam headlights, and forward collision warning with daytime pedestrian detection. Other new standard features include front and rear parking sensors, navigation and subscription-based Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity with a free one-year trial.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 BMW X1 Are Most Important?\n\nThe X1 benefits from new standard active safety and tech features, but we don’t like how BMW makes Apple CarPlay a subscription-based service rather than a feature included for the life of the car. Other standard features include rain-sensing windshield wipers, a power liftgate, power-adjustable front seats, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, a 6.5-inch touchscreen, Bluetooth streaming audio and automatic air conditioning.\n\nAvailable features include a panoramic moonroof, wireless device charging, a Wi-Fi hot spot, heated front seats, a heated steering wheel, a Harman Kardon surround-sound system, a sliding and reclining backseat, a head-up display, and adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 BMW X1?\n\nThe 2019 BMW X1 scores points for its roomy interior, cargo and storage spaces, good visibility and cabin materials. While its turbo four-cylinder offers good passing power, handing and brake-pedal feel disappoint.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in August 2013 about the 2013 BMW X1. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2014, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThough pint-sized, the 2013 BMW X1 delivers huge value in gas mileage and affordability while keeping BMW’s signature driving enjoyment and luxury.\n\nSince 2004, the X3 has been BMW’s smallest SUV. Now the company has added the all-new 2013 X1, which becomes both the smallest and most affordable BMW SUV. The automaker could have easily muddied the distinction between these two models — a mistake we’ve seen from other automakers — but BMW properly distinguishes the similar-looking X1 and X3 SUVs in size, price and usability so buyers should have an easy go deciding which one better fits their lifestyle.\n\nCompared with BMW’s other SUVs, which include the X3, X5 and X6, the X1’s low ride height, ease of entry and small backseat space are more like what a hatchback or wagon offers. The X3 has grown so large and expensive — $40,000 with destination — that a small SUV like the X1 starting closer to $32,000 should intrigue luxury SUV shoppers.\n\nDid someone say wagons? BMW’s new 2014 3 Series Sports Wagon has slightly more cargo room than the X1 but less than the X3, and it’s priced closer to the X3. Compare the X1, 3 Series wagon and X3 here.\n\nI tested a BMW X1 sDrive 28i with a standard turbocharged four-cylinder engine, eight-speed automatic transmission and rear-wheel drive; all-wheel drive (xDrive) and a more-powerful turbocharged six-cylinder (35i) are available.\n\nFor a photo gallery, click here. For a video review, click here.\n\nHoney, I Shrunk the BMW X3\nThe X1 and X3 are nearly impossible to distinguish from each other when whizzing by on the road. However, the X1 is smaller than the X3 in almost every dimension. Overall length is 6.5 inches shorter than the X3, height is down 4.6 inches and the X1 is 3.3 inches narrower. The X1’s svelte size was a pure pleasure to drive through Chicago’s narrow back alleys and neighborhood streets, and just as easy to park, with a turning diameter of 37.1 feet in the rear-drive version. With xDrive, the diameter is 38.7 feet, almost identical to the X3, which comes only with all-wheel drive. The turning circle offers more agility than an Acura RDX (39) or Audi Q5 (38) but isn’t as short as the Audi A3 hatchback (35.1) or toy-size Buick Encore (36.7). Compare turning circles and other specifications of those models here.\n\nThe X1’s smaller dimensions are easier to spot on the inside, where cargo and backseat room take the biggest hit compared with the X3. The X1’s maximum cargo volume with the backseat folded is 56 cubic feet, versus the X3’s 63.3 cubic feet. In practice, the X1’s cargo area is still very usable with nearly as much space as the X3 behind the rear seats — 25 cubic feet compared to 27.6 cubic feet for the X3. The X1’s rear seats fold easily in a versatile 40/20/40 split. There’s enough room for groceries and smaller household items, but fitting a large stroller in the back with the seats up takes up most of the usable room.\n\nFamilies will value the X3’s larger maximum cargo size. The 2014 BMW 3 Series Sports Wagon fits right between the X1 and X3, with a maximum 53 cubic feet of cargo volume with the seats down. The wagon, like the X3, has standard all-wheel drive.\n\nThe X1’s backseat is tight, with little room to spare and a large center hump that intrudes on leg space. Up front is where you want to sit. A low driver’s seating position gives sedanlike ease of entry and exit, plus there’s enough legroom and headroom for 6-foot-tall adults like myself to be completely comfortable. Small SUVs often keep characteristics of larger ones, like a high seating position for visibility, which is a common reason many people buy SUVs. The X1 is not one of those SUVs; it’s more like a low-slung sports sedan, though visibility is still very good thanks to tall, large windows.\n\nFeatures & Interior Quality\nIts $31,725 starting price (including the destination charge) makes the X1 BMW’s least-expensive model, below the BMW 128i coupe. The larger 2014 X3 starts at $40,525, and a 328i Sports Wagon is $42,375. It’s clear the X1 is the baby, budget SUV once you start looking at standard and optional equipment. It’s lacking a power liftgate, which is a popular feature among SUVs of all sizes, and not just luxury ones. There’s a manual handbrake instead of an electronic parking brake, and you won’t find a head-up display, blind spot warning, lane departure warning or other advanced collision-avoidance systems.\n\nNotable standard features on the X1 sDrive28i include automatic climate control, heated exterior mirrors, HD radio, a USB input and rain-sensing windshield wipers. What’s not standard are leather seating, all-wheel drive, satellite radio and power front seats. The list of optional features reads more like a sedan’s, with no power liftgate or BMW’s top-down-view camera system for easy parking. BMW’s iDrive navigation and multimedia system with social media and internet radio apps is also available.\n\nI tested an X1 with the M Sport Package, navigation, Nevada leather, panoramic moonroof and more — and our test vehicle’s $44,245 price was anything but entry-level. Still, loading up the X1 with options isn’t putting lipstick on a pig; the upgraded interior was nearly as luxurious as an X3’s. I could fault it only because the X3 has more nicely trimmed door panels with soft materials and accent stitching. The X1’s grab handles are bare of any decoration. Everything else inside is surprisingly nice for the X1’s entry-level starting point.\n\nM Sport Package\nAfter spending time with the X1, you’ll realize it’s more chiseled, athletic and slender than the X3 not only in how it looks, but also in how it drives. The M Sport Package from BMW’s M division amplifies the driving experience with a sport suspension, sport seats, an M steering wheel and 18-inch M wheels with Pirelli all-season performance tires. Despite the body lines that say “SUV,” the steering wheel says “sports sedan” with this seriously fun package that keeps the X1 poised and flat when thrown into a corner.\n\nBut even without the M Package, the fun factor is still there with the base 240-horsepower, turbocharged four-cylinder engine and eight-speed automatic transmission, with Eco Pro and Sport modes for the driver’s choice of economy or performance, respectively. The 240-hp rating seems conservative considering how the potent engine moves the 3,527-pound X1 from zero to 60 mph in a claimed 6.2 seconds. The X1 is 541 pounds lighter than the X3, which is appropriate, and only 117 pounds heavier than a 328i sedan with an automatic transmission. Now that’s impressive.\n\nThe EPA rates the X1 sDrive28i at 24/34 mpg city/highway with rear-wheel drive. The estimates drop to 22/33 mpg for the all-wheel-drive xDrive28i, and to 18/27 mpg for the xDrive35i, which has a 300-hp, six-cylinder engine.\n\nSo the X1 is fun to drive, quick and gets up to 34 mpg on the highway? Sounds more like the 3 Series sedan than an SUV. The X3 with the same four-cylinder engine and all-wheel drive is rated 21/28 mpg, and the 328i wagon is 22/33 mpg. Unlike the X3 and X1, the wagon has a diesel engine option rated a much higher 31/43 mpg.\n\nThe most troubling part of the engine and fuel economy equation is the auto stop-start mode that’s there to save fuel while at a stop, a feature that now plagues many BMW cars and SUVs. The X1’s execution is among the worst; when the engine starts up, it’s felt through the entire car. I mostly drove with the feature turned off.\n\nRather unimpressive is how the X1 with the sport suspension rides over rough roads — which is to say, poorly. High-dollar cars often combine sportiness and comfort through the use of electronically adjustable suspensions. The X1’s suspension has a fixed firmness — fixed in the “ouch” condition for rear passengers. I ran over what I thought was a moderate imperfection in the road with three passengers in the backseat who all made it very clear they didn’t like being back there.\n\nSafety\nThe BMW X1 is an Insurance Institute for Highway Safety Top Safety Pick, having scored the agency’s best rating, Good, in frontal, side, rear and roof tests. The X1 scored Marginal in the institute’s new small overlap front tests — second from the lowest in the range (Good, Acceptable, Marginal, Poor), keeping the X1 from earning IIHS’ highest award, Top Safety Pick+.\n\nStandard safety features include frontal and side-impact airbags for front occupants and side curtain airbags for front and rear occupants, as well as the federally mandated electronic stability system and antilock brakes. Available safety features include a backup camera and backup sensors. Advanced safety technology, like blind spot warning and lane departure warning, are not available. See more safety features here, and check out how child-safety seats fit in the X1 in our Car Seat Check.\n\n2013 BMW X1 in the Market\nDownsizing is happening within the luxury market; new, smaller engines and smaller cars and SUVs like the Acura ILX and Buick Encore give luxury buyers more-affordable options.\n\nBuyers may miss out on the latest and highest-tech gadgets and features BMW offers, but they won’t miss out on BMW’s mainstays of interior quality and a properly entertaining driving experience, especially with the M Sport Package. For now, the X1’s smaller size doesn’t seem to be hurting the subcompact luxury SUV one bit: The X1 outsold the X3 in July 2013. The BMW X1 is downsizing done right; the gas mileage is right, the size is right and the price is right.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2020 BMW X1 delights with powertrain pep and on-road poise, but its multimedia system is a big-time frustration.\n\nVersus the competition: Like several others in the class, the X1 deftly combines luxury and fun, rising above the crowd in terms of roominess and fuel economy but sinking below the rest in multimedia usability.\n\nRelated: How Do Car Seats Fit in a 2020 BMW X1?\n\nThe X1 is BMW’s smallest SUV and seats five. It got some minor styling tweaks for 2020, including a larger version of the automaker’s kidney grille, punctuated by updated LED headlights and a more muscular bumper. See it compared with last year’s version.\n\nIt goes head to head against the likes of the Audi Q3, Cadillac XT4 and Volvo XC40; compare them.\n\nLively Engine, Playful Feel\n\nDriving the X1 was a delight. After just a hint of lag, the turbocharged 2.0-liter engine was lively from a stop, and clean, snappy shifts from the eight-speed automatic quickly furnished more power. For 2020, BMW revised the transmission’s gear ratios for quicker performance, with 0-60 mph acceleration now happening in 6.3 seconds for the all-wheel-drive X1 xDrive28i and 6.6 seconds in the X1 sDrive28i, BMW says.\n\nPopping the X1 into Sport mode (via a button near the center console) amped up the level of engagement with increased accelerator response and firmer steering. Eco mode did the opposite, dulling throttle to benefit fuel economy; Comfort mode splits the difference.\n\nEspecially in Sport mode, the X1 is as spirited as the Q3 and more playful than the XC40, with a firm, controlled ride to complement direct steering and an overall feeling of nimbleness. Its small turning radius made short work of parking maneuvers. Buyers can opt for an M Sport suspension for more dialed-in road manners.\n\nIt also rises above the rest in fuel economy. In base two-wheel-drive trim, the X1 gets an EPA-estimated 24/33/27 mpg city/highway/combined, a smidge better than 2WD versions of the Cadillac XT4 (24/30/26 mpg) and Volvo XC40 (23/33/27 mpg), and a lot better than a base Audi Q3 (19/27/22 mpg), though that car  has standard all-wheel drive. Like the others, the X1 is available with all-wheel drive; there’s a small mileage penalty, however, of 1 mpg combined.\n\nThere are a few blemishes on the X1’s road manners. First, the automatic engine stop-start system needs work. Where the rest of the powertrain is smooth overall, the system shudders to life awkwardly. Second, the X1’s taut suspension and stiff ride don’t play nicely with bumpy roads. Lastly, noise isolation could be better; quite a bit of road and wind noise make their way into the cabin.\n\nControl Woes\n\nWhile the exterior got an update for 2020, not much changed on the inside this year aside from some new contrast stitching for the imitation leather seats and surfaces. As before, the cabin waves its luxury-car flag with lovely gloss wood paneling and leather trim. A few cheap spots stand out, like some hard plastic on the door, but the overall vibe is quality.\n\nWhat needs an update (another one) is BMW’s multimedia system. Last year’s standard 6.5-inch display is gone, replaced by the previously optional 8.8-inch unit, which is now standard. It comes with navigation and Apple CarPlay compatibility but no Android Auto (a problem for me).\n\nMore problems: The X1’s multimedia system bundles navigation, radio, phone and the car’s overall systems menu, all controlled by a rotary knob. The system is both distracting and annoying to control via the console-area knob, which I also found ergonomically challenging to reach. Eschewing the knob for the touchscreen solves some of that, but the system’s menu structure isn’t very straightforward, so tasks that should be simple — such as opening your favorites menu or switching the station — require several steps.\n\nAudi, Cadillac and Volvo all approach multimedia systems in different ways, and after sampling many of them, the X1’s is the most confounding — and it has one of the smallest screens.\n\nUn-Compact-Sized Room\n\nIn both rows, the seats are comfy and space is more generous than the car’s compact dimensions suggest. The X1 has more rear headroom than competitors and more rear legroom than all but the XT4.\n\nThis played out when installing child-safety seats. The X1 had ample space for two of them — even space-hogging rear-facing car seats — and exposed Latch anchors made installation a breeze. Check out our full Car Seat Check.\n\nBehind the rear seats, there’s 27.1 cubic feet of space — plenty for a full load of groceries for my family of five and significantly more than the Q3 (23.7), XT4 (22.3) or XC40 (20.7) offer. With the seats folded, the X1 has 58.7 cubic feet of space, once again more than its competitors; there’s also a pass-through for carrying longer items.\n\nSafety and Value\n\nThe 2020 BMW X1 received five stars from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and top crashworthiness scores from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, but it did not pass that organization’s vehicle-to-pedestrian front crash prevention test.\n\nIn safety features, the X1 is well equipped, with standards like low-speed forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning and automatic high-beam headlights. One of the X1’s safety blind spots is that you can’t get blind spot monitoring. Another is that other driver assistance and safety features, including adaptive cruise control ($1,000), can get expensive.\n\nThe 2020 BMW X1 starts at $36,195 as a base sDrive28i with front-wheel drive. That’s a little more than the Audi Q3 (impressive for Audi given the Q3 comes with standard all-wheel drive) and Volvo XC40, but slightly less than a Cadillac XT4 (all prices include destination charges).\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Though pint-sized, the 2013 BMW X1 delivers huge value in gas mileage and affordability while keeping BMW’s signature driving enjoyment and luxury.\n\nSince 2004, the X3 has been BMW’s smallest SUV. Now the company has added the all-new 2013 X1, which becomes both the smallest and most affordable BMW SUV. The automaker could have easily muddied the distinction between these two models — a mistake we’ve seen from other automakers — but BMW properly distinguishes the similar-looking X1 and X3 SUVs in size, price and usability so buyers should have an easy go deciding which one better fits their lifestyle.\n\nCompared with BMW’s other SUVs, which include the X3, X5 and X6, the X1’s Specs – low ride height, ease of entry and small backseat space – are more like what a hatchback or wagon offers. The X3 has grown so large and expensive — $40,000 with destination — that a small SUV like the X1 starting closer to $32,000 should intrigue luxury SUV shoppers.\n\nDid someone say wagons? BMW’s new 2014 3 Series Sports Wagon has slightly more cargo room than the X1 but less than the X3, and it’s priced closer to the X3. Compare the X1, 3 Series wagon and X3 here.\n\nI tested a BMW X1 sDrive 28i with a standard turbocharged four-cylinder engine, eight-speed automatic transmission and rear-wheel drive; all-wheel drive (xDrive) and a more-powerful turbocharged six-cylinder (35i) are available.\n\nHoney, I Shrunk the BMW X3\nThe BMW X1 and X3 are nearly impossible to distinguish from each other when whizzing by on the road. However, the X1 is smaller than the X3 in almost every dimension. Overall length is 6.5 inches shorter than the X3, height is down 4.6 inches and the X1 is 3.3 inches narrower. The X1’s svelte size was a pure pleasure to drive through Chicago’s narrow back alleys and neighborhood streets, and just as easy to park, with a turning diameter of 37.1 feet in the rear-drive version. With xDrive, the diameter is 38.7 feet, almost identical to the X3, which comes only with all-wheel drive. The turning circle offers more agility than an Acura RDX (39) or Audi Q5 (38) but isn’t as short as the Audi A3 hatchback (35.1) or toy-size Buick Encore (36.7). Compare turning circles and other specifications of those models here.\n\nThe BMW X1’s smaller dimensions are easier to spot on the inside, where cargo and backseat room take the biggest hit compared with the X3. The X1’s maximum cargo volume with the backseat folded is 56 cubic feet, versus the X3’s 63.3 cubic feet. In practice, the X1’s cargo area is still very usable with nearly as much space as the X3 behind the rear seats — 25 cubic feet compared to 27.6 cubic feet for the X3. The X1’s rear seats fold easily in a versatile 40/20/40 split. There’s enough room for groceries and smaller household items, but fitting a large stroller in the back with the seats up takes up most of the usable room.\n\nFamilies will value the X3’s larger maximum cargo size. The 2014 BMW 3 Series Sports Wagon fits right between the X1 and X3, with a maximum 53 cubic feet of cargo volume with the seats down. The wagon, like the X3, has standard all-wheel drive.\n\nThe X1’s backseat is tight, with little room to spare and a large center hump that intrudes on leg space. Up front is where you want to sit. A low driver’s seating position gives sedanlike ease of entry and exit, plus there’s enough legroom and headroom for 6-foot-tall adults like myself to be completely comfortable. Small SUVs often keep characteristics of larger ones, like a high seating position for visibility, which is a common reason many people buy SUVs. The X1 is not one of those SUVs; it’s more like a low-slung sports sedan, though visibility is still very good thanks to tall, large windows.\n\nFeatures & Interior Quality\nIts $31,725 starting price (including the destination charge) makes the X1 BMW’s least-expensive model, below the BMW 128i coupe. The larger 2014 X3 starts at $40,525, and a 328i Sports Wagon is $42,375. It’s clear the X1 is the baby, budget SUV once you start looking at standard and optional equipment. It’s lacking a power liftgate, which is a popular feature among SUVs of all sizes, and not just luxury ones. There’s a manual handbrake instead of an electronic parking brake, and you won’t find a head-up display, blind spot warning, lane departure warning or other advanced collision-avoidance systems.\n\nNotable standard features on the X1 sDrive28i include automatic climate control, heated exterior mirrors, HD radio, a USB input and rain-sensing windshield wipers. What’s not standard are leather seating, all-wheel drive, satellite radio and power front seats. The list of optional features reads more like a sedan’s, with no power liftgate or BMW’s top-down-view camera system for easy parking. BMW’s iDrive navigation and multimedia system with social media and internet radio apps is also available.\n\nI tested a BMW X1 with the M Sport Package, navigation, Nevada leather, panoramic moonroof and more — and our test vehicle’s $44,245 price was anything but entry-level. Still, loading up the X1 with options isn’t putting lipstick on a pig; the upgraded interior was nearly as luxurious as an X3’s. I could fault it only because the X3 has more nicely trimmed door panels with soft materials and accent stitching. The BMW X1’s grab handles are bare of any decoration. Everything else inside is surprisingly nice for the X1’s entry-level starting point.\n\nM Sport Package\nAfter spending time with the X1, you’ll realize it’s more chiseled, athletic and slender than the X3 not only in how it looks, but also in how it drives. The M Sport Package from BMW’s M division amplifies the driving experience with a sport suspension, sport seats, an M steering wheel and 18-inch M wheels with Pirelli all-season performance tires. Despite the body lines that say “SUV,” the steering wheel says “sports sedan” with this seriously fun package that keeps the X1 poised and flat when thrown into a corner.\n\nBut even without the M Package, the fun factor is still there with the base 240-horsepower, turbocharged four-cylinder engine and eight-speed automatic transmission, with Eco Pro and Sport modes for the driver’s choice of economy or performance, respectively. The 240-hp rating seems conservative considering how the potent engine moves the 3,527-pound X1 from zero to 60 mph in a claimed 6.2 seconds. The X1 is 541 pounds lighter than the X3, which is appropriate, and only 117 pounds heavier than a 328i sedan with an automatic transmission. Now that’s impressive.\n\nThe EPA rates the X1 sDrive28i at 24/34 mpg city/highway with rear-wheel. The estimates drop to 22/33 mpg for the all-wheel-drive xDrive28i, and to 18/27 mpg for the xDrive35i, which has a 300-hp, six-cylinder engine.\n\nSo the front engine BMW X1 is fun to drive, quick and gets up to 34 mpg on the highway? Sounds more like the 3 Series sedan than an SUV. The X3 with the same four-cylinder engine and all-wheel drive is rated 21/28 mpg, and the 328i wagon is 22/33 mpg. Unlike the X3 and X1, the wagon has a diesel engine option rated a much higher 31/43 mpg.\n\nThe most troubling part of the engine and fuel economy equation is the auto start-stop mode that’s there to save fuel while at a stop, a feature that now plagues many BMW cars and SUVs. The X1’s execution is among the worst; when the engine starts up, it’s felt through the entire car. I mostly drove with the feature turned off.\n\nRather unimpressive is how the X1 with the sport suspension rides over rough roads — which is to say, poorly. High-dollar cars often combine sportiness and comfort through the use of electronically adjustable suspensions. The X1’s suspension has a fixed firmness — fixed in the “ouch” condition for rear passengers. I ran over what I thought was a moderate imperfection in the road with three passengers in the backseat who all made it very clear they didn’t like being back there.\n\nSafety\nThe BMW X1 is an Insurance Institute for Highway Safety Top Safety Pick, having scored the agency’s best rating, Good, in frontal, side, rear and roof tests. The X1 scored Marginal in the institute’s new small overlap front tests — second from the lowest in the range (Good, Acceptable, Marginal, Poor), keeping the X1 from earning IIHS’ highest award, Top Safety Pick+.\n\nStandard safety features include frontal and side-impact airbags for front occupants and side curtain airbags for front and rear occupants, as well as the federally mandated electronic stability system and antilock brakes. Available safety features include a backup camera and backup sensors. Advanced safety technology, like blind spot warning and lane departure warning, are not available. See more safety features here, and check out how child-safety seats fit in the X1 in our Car Seat Check.\n\n2013 BMW X1 in the Market\nDownsizing is happening within the luxury market; new, smaller engines and smaller cars and SUVs like the Acura ILX and Buick Encore give luxury buyers more-affordable options.\n\nBuyers may miss out on the latest and highest-tech gadgets and features BMW offers, but they won’t miss out on BMW’s mainstays of interior quality and a properly entertaining driving experience, especially with the M Sport Package. For now, the X1’s smaller size doesn’t seem to be hurting the subcompact luxury SUV one bit: The X1 outsold the X3 in July 2013. The BMW X1 is downsizing done right; the gas mileage is right, the size is right and the price is right.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in February 2016 about the 2016 X1. The 2017 adds a front-wheel-drive variant with a lower starting price, but little else of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2017, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe second generation of BMW’s smallest SUV drops its predecessor’s performance hallmarks: near-perfect weight distribution and an available turbo six-cylinder that made the X1 more rocket ship than SUV. We drove the 2016 X1’s sole variant, the xDrive28i (compare it with the 2015 X1 here).\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nBMW’s redesign adds some much-needed sophistication versus the old X1, which was a hodgepodge of ungainly proportions and oversized elements. (To me, anyway.) Proportioned and styled like a miniature X5, the new X1 is shorter than its predecessor from bumper to bumper, but also taller, wider and slightly lighter. It’s on the larger side of German rivals like the Audi Q3 and Mercedes-Benz GLA250. For similar money, though, the Acura RDX and Lexus NX dwarf the whole group.\n\nShoppers will appreciate the X1’s best-in-group turning circle, which is a tidy 37.4 feet. Eighteen-inch alloy wheels, fog lights and LED daytime running lights are standard. Full-LED headlights and 19-inch alloys are optional.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThe X1’s turbo four-cylinder (228 horsepower, 258 pounds-feet of torque) has adequate power for just about all situations, but noticeable — and inconsistent — accelerator lag hampers things from a standstill. Still, once you get past the initial gremlins, power comes early and stays late, and the standard eight-speed automatic transmission finds the right gear without too much delay.\n\nAt highway speeds, noise insulation is up to luxury-car snuff. Ride quality from the X1’s standard M Sport suspension is characteristic of BMW, with good isolation at higher speeds but somewhat firm response to individual bumps. It’s appropriate for a premium SUV and stops short of being uncomfortable — unlike the brittle GLA250 or busy NX — but I still find the Q3’s masterful ride quality tops.\n\nSure to disappoint BMW fans, however, spirited driving reveals the X1’s downfalls. On wet pavement, hard acceleration induces lots of front wheelspin before the driveline sends power to the rear. Throw the SUV around corners, and it feels as nose-heavy as any SUV from a not-so-premium Detroit or Japanese brand. The steering has a degree of slop that’s on par with them, too, and a soft, mushy brake pedal further blunts the X1’s reflexes.\n\nIndeed, this redesign shifts a lot more weight over the front axle than the previous X1 — a near-inevitable outcome of BMW moving the X1 from its rear-drive past to a new, front-drive platform. Such underpinnings need not sentence a car to lackluster handling (see the GLA-Class, for example), but the X1’s foundation does just that. You don’t need to take the SUV to the racetrack to figure it out: In ordinary spirited driving, the X1 handles like a grocery-getter SUV, even with various driving modes dialed to their sportiest settings. It begs to be driven slower.\n\nInterior\n\nRedemption comes inside. Most subcompact SUVs are known for being skinny on utility, but the X1 would impress even in a larger class. An upright windshield, tall windows and fold-forward backseat head restraints lend excellent visibility, aided by a higher seating position to begin with. BMW says it raised the seating position by more than an inch up front and 2.5 inches in back versus the 2015. Larger adults may find the lower cushions too small, but the chairs themselves have excellent adjustment range, and a low center tunnel clears out plenty of knee and thigh space. Power-adjustable front seats with a memory driver’s seat and faux-leather upholstery are standard. Heated seats, a panoramic moonroof and real leather are optional.\n\nCabin materials are stepped up a notch from the old X1’s evident cost-cutting — for a luxury model, anyway — with uniform finishes in most areas above knee level. I also welcome the return of a bona fide mechanical gearshift. The previous X1’s electronic shifter, in all its lifeless artificiality, is gone. Other BMWs should follow suit.\n\nThe backseat’s bottom cushions are a bit short for taller adults, but the space is otherwise excellent. Legroom and headroom are both good, and the bench seat has a nice, high position off the floor. The backseat has optional manual adjustments (a $300 stand-alone option) that enable 30 degrees of reclining and 5 inches of sliding.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nThe standard audio setup includes a 6.5-inch multimedia screen and BMW’s iDrive controller. Bluetooth phone and audio streaming, HD radio, a USB input and steering-wheel audio controls are also standard. A basic navigation system, satellite radio and Harman Kardon surround-sound premium audio are optional. A Technology Package with navigation and an upsized screen (8.8 inches) is optional; it also adds a touchpad to the iDrive controller for you to scrawl letters or numbers — a feature I’ve found little use for in other cars.\n\nA head-up display is optional. BMW’s ConnectedDrive Services portal integrates various apps (Glympse, Spotify, Pandora and more) from a compatible smartphone into the multimedia system; some features require a ConnectedDrive monthly subscription. Dedicated smartphone portals like Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are unavailable right now, but BMW says it’s looking into integrating both.\n\nCargo & Storage\n\nPracticality continues in terms of storage. A small cubby near the cupholders provides convenient open storage; the door pockets and center console are roomy for this class. The rear seats fold in a 40/20/40 split, and optional power-folding rear seats are operable from the cargo area. A power liftgate is standard.\n\nCargo space behind the rear seats amounts to a very good 27.1 cubic feet, with 58.7 cubic feet of maximum room when the seats are down. Both figures are impressive for the segment.\n\nSafety\n\nThe X1 has yet to be crash-tested. Click here to see a full list of safety features. Notable options include lane departure warning and forward collision warning with automatic braking, both part of a $700 Driver Assistance Plus Package. A backup camera — something many cheaper SUVs include standard — comes in a $1,150 Driver Assistance Package. C’mon, BMW.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nUnlike many immediate competitors, the X1 has standard all-wheel drive — and its starting price, at a relatively steep $35,795 with destination, reflects that. Go to town with options, and a loaded X1 can top $50,000. That’s a stratosphere only the GLA250 reaches.\n\nThe lack of a cheaper two-wheel-drive model will turn some shoppers away from the X1, particularly in Sun Belt states. Whether BMW’s latest SUV attracts others depends on how much drivability matters to them. BMW’s performance tradition is clearly missing, but practicality has taken its place. The redesigned X1 is BMW’s take on a Toyota RAV4 or Honda CR-V — a quicker one with better cabin materials, to be sure, but still a shopping-mall SUV that prioritizes utility over driving fun.\n\nMy prediction? Shoppers won’t care one bit. Practicality-minded SUVs are selling like gangbusters right now, and for all their novelty, too many subcompact luxury SUVs have too many practical compromises. The reimagined X1 will cause fits among some enthusiasts, but I suspect it’s the right move. Among the broader horde of SUV shoppers, BMW’s latest should do just fine.",
