      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 BMW 3 Series?\n\nThe BMW 3 Series is a five-seat luxury sports sedan pitted against competitors such as the Audi A4, Cadillac CT4, Genesis G70 and Mercedes-Benz C-Class. Powering the base 330i is a 255-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that’s coupled with an eight-speed automatic transmission. The M340i gets a 382-hp, turbo 3.0-liter inline-six with a 48-volt mild-hybrid system. Rounding out the 3 Series lineup is the plug-in hybrid 330e (which has up to 22 miles of electric driving range) and the high-performance M3. The M3 has a twin-turbo inline-six with at least 473 hp, and it’s the only 3 Series model still available with a six-speed manual transmission. All 3 Series models are available with rear-wheel drive or all-wheel drive.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 BMW 3 Series? \n\nAfter a mid-cycle refresh for the 2023 model year, the regular BMW 3 Series lineup doesn’t see any significant changes for 2024. The M3 gains a limited-edition CS trim with 543 hp, specific suspension tuning and a starting price of almost $120,000. \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 BMW 3 Series Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n14.9-inch infotainment touchscreen\n12.3-inch digital gauge display\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nPower moonroof\nLED headlights \n40/20/40-split, folding backseat\nSatellite radio\nNavigation\nRain-sensing wipers\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nRemote start\nHeated front and rear seats\nHeated steering wheel\nHarman Kardon premium stereo\nHead-up instrument display\nBlind spot warning\nLane departure steering assist\nHands-free low-speed highway driving system\n​​Adaptive suspension\nShould I Buy the 2024 BMW 3 Series?\n\nFor many years, the BMW 3 Series has been the default choice for luxury shoppers looking for a relatively small and sporty sedan. The cabin has adult-friendly accommodations, and the onboard tech is suitably impressive for a car in this class. That said, care must be taken when adding options or climbing to higher-performing models. Both quickly raise the price, making the 3 Series a tougher sell for anyone seeking to balance value with driving pleasure.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 BMW 3 Series?\n\nThe BMW 3 Series is a five-seat luxury sports sedan that competes with the Audi A4, Lexus IS and Mercedes-Benz C-Class. The 330i is powered by a 255-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, while the M340i gets a 382-hp, turbo 3.0-liter inline-six that works with a mild-hybrid system. Both engines team with an eight-speed automatic transmission, and rear- and all-wheel-drive models are offered. Plug-in hybrid 330e and high-performance M3 versions of the 3 Series are also available. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 BMW 3 Series? \n\nThe 3 Series’ exterior sees some subtle styling updates, and the cabin gets BMW’s Curved Display — a combination of a 12.3-inch digital instrument panel and a 14.9-inch touchscreen display.

      "expert_review": "Whew. BMW is having quite a year. So far, 2001 has been the German company’s best sales year. In June, BMW for the first time eclipsed fellow luxury brands Lexus, Mercedes-Benz and Cadillac in overall sales.\n\nThere’s been a constant stream of lauds and accolades about BMW cars from the media and consumer groups, including a recent AutoWeek readership poll that picked BMW’s 3 Series as the best car or truck sold in the United States. And the 5 Series was pick No. 3. No self-esteem problems here. With great products, excellent marketing and a strong image, BMW just keeps climbing the charts.\n\nI have no problem with AutoWeek’s first-place winner. The 3 Series models really are gems, fine compact cars with a sporty balance of poise and performance. For the 2001 model year, two new, more powerful versions of BMW’s classic inline-six engines, a 2.5-liter engine with 184 horsepower and a 3-liter mill with a roaring 225 horsepower, further enhance the breed.\n\nRecently, I had the opportunity to sample the new 3-liter engine in the Z3 sports car and found it to be wonderfully strong, smooth and tractable. Now, I’ve tested out the 330i, and that engine really shines.\n\nWith a five-speed stickshift and optional sport-tuned suspension that includes 17-inch performance wheels and tires, the 330 was a blast to drive. Tight, agile, quick, great brakes and fabulous cornering, all in a practical four-door sedan. So what’s not to like? Well, the nearly $40,000 price tag takes it off most people’s shopping lists. The base-model 325i sedan starts at $27,560, quickly hitting the mid-30s as options pile on. The 3 Series may be BMW’s entry level, but it is a BMW, after all.\n\nActually, the 3 Series cars are my favorite BMWs. I like how trim and racy they feel, all stiff suspension and balanced precision. Drivers who enjoy BMWs appreciate the handling advantages of that stiff suspension, though passengers may find it hard-riding.\n\nAs noted in the recent Z3 review, the new 3- and 2.5-liter engines now have aluminum blocks for lighter weight; electronic-hydraulic variable valve timing for consistent power and torque from low to high rpm; electronic throttle linkage for smoother transitions; and a new intake manifold that helps boost power. And along with all that strength and performance, the new engines meet EPA limits for “ultra-low emissions vehicle” classification. The new 3-liter engine also gets better gas mileage than the less-powerful 2.8-liter engine it replaces.\n\nAnother addition to the 3 Series sedans is optional all-wheel drive, giving the usually rear-drive cars more traction on slippery surfaces as well as enhancing cornering in a variety of conditions. Both rear-wheel-drive and all-wheel-drive models get electronic Dynamic Stability Control that helps control skids, which can save your hide if you go into a corner a little too fast.\n\nSpeaki ng of rear-wheel-drive, it’s still favored over front-wheel drive for balance and performance in a sporty car. Plus, it’s great to hit the throttle and have the rear hunker down and grab instead of the front wheels spinning like mad.\n\nInside, the 330i is all business, with nice, straightforward switches and gauges, newly enhanced with aluminum trim. I’m still not real happy with the orange glow of the gauges at night. And the little gas-mileage needle, which flips around wildly as you speed up and slow down, is absolutely worthless.\n\nAlso, the “multifunction” steering wheel has a confusing array of buttons and switches.\n\nFront seating is comfortable, supportive and roomy, but rear-seat denizens might find legroom a bit cramped (especially if they’re as tall as my teenage boys).\n\nOptions on the test car included the sport package, including sharp-looking modular wheels, leather-trimmed multi-function steering wheel and aerodynamic en ements, $1,200; leather interior, $1,450; moonroof, $1,050; and a stereo upgrade, $200.\n\nOnce you get past price, features, stereos and such, the 330i has one simple thing over other small sedans. It has to do with poise and power, sports-car handling and a favorite stretch of two-lane blacktop.",

The M3 also gets the new 8.5 software, along with BMW’s Curved Display digital dashboard, a new flat-bottom steering wheel and redesigned headlights. \n\nWhat Features in the 2025 BMW 3 Series Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n14.9-inch infotainment touchscreen\n12.3-inch digital gauge display\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nPower moonroof\nLED headlights \n40/20/40-split folding backseat\nSatellite radio\nNavigation\nRain-sensing wipers\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nRemote start\nHeated front and rear seats\nHeated steering wheel\nHarman Kardon premium stereo\nHead-up instrument display\nBlind spot warning\nLane-centering steering\nHands-free low-speed highway driving system\n​​Adaptive suspension\nShould I Buy the 2025 BMW 3 Series?\n\nFor many years, the BMW 3 Series has been the default choice for luxury shoppers looking for a relatively small and sporty sedan. The cabin has adult-friendly accommodations (at least in the front seats), and its onboard tech is suitably impressive for a car in this segment. That being said, care must be taken when adding options or climbing to higher-performing models. Both quickly raise the price, making the 3 Series a tougher sell for anyone seeking to balance value with driving pleasure.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The redesigned BMW 3 Series comes with a renewed focus on technology and luxury, but it loses some of its driving character in the bargain.\n\nVersus the competition: There are other options in this class if you want to have fun behind the wheel, but the 3 Series’ technology credentials and excellent cabin hold up well against the field.\n\nAfter I finished testing the redesigned 2019 BMW 330i, I took a look at the headlines of the 3 Series stories I’ve written over the past year: “Is the Mojo Back?” “Can BMW Lift the Crown Once Again?” All my 3 Series stories have been about the past as much as the future because I’ve been hoping for the sports sedan to hark back to the BMW of old — the one that led the field in driving dynamics and was a blast to pilot everywhere, from an autocross to any mountain road you could find.\n\nBut the new car isn’t the analog, canyon-carving 3 Series I longed for. Time and a shift in market demand seem to have driven the newest generation of the 3 (codenamed G20) in a different direction. In that regard, it has succeeded. Layers of technology drape over both the cabin and the driving experience, and while that’s made the car more modern and luxurious, it’s also lost something in the balance.\n\nThe redesigned 3 Series competes in a crowded field of compact luxury sports sedans, notably the Mercedes-Benz C-Class, Audi A4 and our reigning Best of 2019 winner, the Genesis G70.\n\nSmall Engine, Big Power\n\nThere is one place, however, where the BMW hasn’t lost a step: under the hood. The 330i comes with a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder making 255 horsepower and 295 pounds-feet of torque, mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission. (Regrettably, BMW has discontinued the manual transmission.) Rear-wheel drive was standard in my 330i test car; all-wheel drive is optional in the 330i xDrive. The new 330i’s power numbers represent modest increases of 7 hp and 37 pounds-feet of torque over the 2018 car without changing displacement.\n\nIt’s an impressive engine for a turbo four. The power band is wide and kicks in early; maximum torque opens up at just 1,550 rpm, and the transmission is adept at finding gears quickly when you press the accelerator. Flip the 330i into Sport mode and the powertrain jumps up eagerly. I mostly left the transmission to its own devices while driving hard, and it was adept at holding onto gears to give me a good boost of power on corner exits, as well as downshifting under harder gas-pedal inputs. The powertrain’s instant responsiveness was the best part of the 330i driving experience — in sharp contrast to the steering and suspension’s lack of communication.\n\n2019 BMW 330i | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\nThe Things We Left Behind\n\nIn the previous-generation 3 Series, the addition of the optional M Suspension and steering really shored up the car’s dynamics, and I’d hoped the same would be true here. My test vehicle came with all the performance boxes checked: M Sport Package with sport steering, Track Handling Package with M Sport brakes and differential, and an Adaptive M Suspension, all of which added $8,150 to the 330i’s price tag.\n\nGiven this is pretty much the sharpest 330i you can get, it was disappointing. My initial impression was that the suspension and steering vagueness were noticeable but not an impediment, but after a week in the car, my mind changed. If you’re looking for a vehicle in this class that emphasizes driving enjoyment, you’ll have to look elsewhere (I’d recommend going in the direction of the aforementioned G70 or the Alfa Romeo Giulia).\n\nThe BMW’s steering really lets you down when you push the car. I could feel the body rolling around behind me when I put the 330i through a dynamic lap in the canyons above Malibu. The steering’s weight isn’t really the issue — it firms up in Sport mode to provide enough resistance — it’s just missing any sort of feedback as the car’s speed increases, which is exactly when you most need to know what the front wheels are doing.\n\nAs a counterpoint to this, the 330i rides well on the road and has excellent highway manners — as it should, given the car’s lack of dynamism. It’s apparent that the 330i was tuned for comfort, not hijinks. It’s just grown up a bit too much for my taste; those qualities don’t necessarily have to be mutually exclusive, though it is difficult to build a car that can do both things well.\n\nThe last hope for the 3 Series is its second version, the M340i, which will debut as a 2020 model later in 2019. It has a 382-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder that makes 369 pounds-feet of torque and goes like stink. Zero-to-60 flies by in just 4.2 seconds, BMW says. I tested one on the track, where the engine proved well suited for that environment.\n\nEPA-estimated fuel economy for the 330i is 26/36/30 mpg city/highway/combined for RWD models, with AWD 330i’s coming in slightly behind that at 25/34/28 mpg, both on required premium gasoline.\n\nInterior and Technology Improvements\n\nThe new 330i is a technology powerhouse. My test vehicle came equipped with both a 12.3-inch digital instrument panel and a 10.25-inch multimedia touchscreen (an 8.8-inch screen is standard), giving the driver’s side and center of the dashboard a futuristic feel. BMW gives you a lot of options for how you can interact with the car’s multimedia functions: via touchscreen, using a rotary dial by the shifter, with voice commands or even via gestures.\n\nIf that all sounds overwhelming, that’s because it is — at first. There are definitely more efficient ways to use the system in different situations, and I was thankful I had tested a few other BMW products with this version of iDrive before I had the 3 Series; without that, I would have felt much more lost. The good news is that once you get it down — including the best cadence for the voice controls — it all works quite seamlessly. But again, if you’re not tech-savvy or prefer a simpler setup, it will be a lot to take in.\n\nOne thing to watch out for: You can get Apple CarPlay connectivity (wireless, at that), but it comes at a cost. The first year will be free, but using it thereafter will cost $80 per year (you can set up and pay via the car’s multimedia system). Android users like yours truly will continue to be completely out of luck.\n\nThe 3 Series has grown in this redesign. The wheelbase has stretched by 1.6 inches, and that spaces out the cabin a bit. According to the official specifications, there’s only 0.1 inch more backseat legroom, but when I hopped back there it felt like more than that. It’s still not the biggest backseat in this class, but now I can at least sit behind where I set the driver’s seat somewhat comfortably (I’m 5-foot-11). It also offers enough support for longer trips, as well. The trunk provides 17.0 cubic feet of cargo room, up from 13.0 last year. This gives the 3 Series a big advantage over its competition: The A4 has 13.0 cubic feet, the C-Class has 12.6 and the G70 falls way behind, at 10.5 cubic feet.\n\n2019 BMW 330i | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\nSafety Blanket\n\nThe 2019 330i’s technology upgrades aren’t limited to multimedia. It offers a ton of optional safety technology, as well, and my test vehicle had it all. The requisite luxury safety features were present, like forward automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist, blind spot warnings, and front and rear parking sensors. But the 3 Series goes above and beyond the requisite, particularly with two features: Extended Traffic Jam Assistant and Backup Assistant.\n\nExtended Traffic Jam Assistant works at speeds of less than 37 mph on limited-access highways, and it doesn’t require the driver to touch the wheel. A small camera in the instrument cluster makes sure the driver is paying attention, and as long as that’s the case, the system remains activated and guides the car down the highway in one lane. The system can be a bit tricky to turn on and keep on, but it made the Los Angeles traffic I had parked myself in much more bearable once it was up and running. Backup Assistant is similarly impressive: If you have to pull forward into a tricky space, the car remembers up to 50 yards of the path and can recreate it in Reverse, steering automatically on the way out to avoid obstacles or bushes.\n\nIt’s also worth noting the myriad camera views offered, from a 360-degree view to a simulated view that rotates around the car. For example, if you slowly approach a curb while parking, the camera will automatically shift to show you a top-down view of the hood so you can see exactly how close you are to objects in front of you.\n\n2019 BMW 330i | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\nValue and Pricing\n\nThe 330i I tested was pretty much fully loaded. It starts at $41,245 (including destination charge) for RWD models, while AWD versions start at $43,745 — a $2,000 premium. Adding all the multimedia and safety technology I mentioned earlier, plus leather upholstery and a fantastic Portimao Blue Metallic paint, drove the price tag for our tester up to a dizzying $59,920.\n\nThat isn’t to say the BMW is alone in reaching such dizzying price heights; you can option competitors in this class to similar places. But there are also much better deals to be had, particularly in the G70. It may not offer the same level of technology, but for much less money you get a larger engine, all-wheel drive, Nappa leather and a much better driving experience (and don’t forget Android Auto). If you want to price the 330i to match a G70, you’ll have to give back many of the features that earn it distinction.\n\nAfter my week with the 2019 330i concluded, I hadn’t embraced the new paradigm. There was still some wistfulness for the 3 Series of old, and I think it might always be there for me. Perhaps one day the sedan will be both a technological and driving powerhouse, but the current iteration’s delights come more through your eyes than your hands.\n\n(Disclaimer: The wheels and tires in these photographs don’t match; the 330i I tested came equipped with the Track Handling Package, which normally adds black wheels and conventional (not run-flat) tires. The car I tested has bi-color wheels and originally came with run-flat tires, which BMW swapped out to non-run-flats so performance would be as intended. BMW did say this combination will be available for order in the 2020 model year.)\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "In our long, hot summer, I didn’t want to even think about topless motoring, much less spend a week doing it. Yes, hot summer nights do have some charm when the air conditioner’s blasting, but forget about UV-A and UV-B.\n\nBut now as fall looms, the charms of a car that’s really two cars in one begin to be more seductive. And this week’s scrutinizee is a real spoiler.\n\nThe 3 Series is the smallest of the BMW-labeled offerings in this country, though calling them “entry-level” rings false in a couple of ways. They’re too sophisticated and too expensive to wear such a plebeian tag.\n\nIn some ways, I’ve always found the 3 Series to be the most enjoyable of all the horses in the BMW stable. Thanks to its tidy size and mass, it allow a bit more intimacy between driver and road than the larger offerings.\n\nThe 3 line is at midlife, and so was given an exterior “freshening” for the 2002 model year, along with evolutionary mechanical tweaks. The convertibles’ looks are the least different, but they still are particularly dashing. Their proportions, top up or down, just work.\n\nThere are two choices, the 325Ci and the 330Ci, differing most existentially in what’s under the hood. Depending on how flush you’re feeling these days, the choice may come down to price – there’s a $6,300 chasm between them in stock trim.\n\nBecause of their exclusivity and their extra mechanicals, the convertibles are the most expensive members of the 3-Series family. The 325Ci starts at $36,745, freight included, the 330Ci at $43,045. Both of those prices eclipse those of even the all-wheel-drive sedans, in furtherance of the proof of my premise that convertible owners are, by and large, nuts. In the case instant, however, the dementia case is harder to make – this car outhandles most of the sedans and coupes on the road today and is as well a paradigm of good convertible behavior.\n\nLast point first. The 330Ci has a well-mannered powered top, which folds itself and tucks neatly under a metal cover with a gentle press on a switch when one wants to let the sun shine in. It’s just as easily reversed when the weather is adverse, mating easily with the top of the windshield on the return trip.\n\nThe car is so set up that a six-footer does not get a scalp massage when motoring briskly al fresco. All too often in cars of this size one’s head protrudes into the airstream. But here, thanks to a fairly low seating position and a front windshield allowed to ramp up at a sensible angle, the air rushes over both vehicle and occupant at the highest legal speeds.\n\nFurthermore, at such speeds, there’s relatively little turbulence in the passenger space. I wouldn’t put a stack of hundreds on the co-pilot’s seat, but it isn’t the vortex effect again too often found on vehicles of the type.\n\nWhen the top is up, visibility suffers big time, what with the smallish greenhouse and the large, opaque sailplane. The rear window isn’t exactly panoramic either . But devotees will counter that only a motorcycle offers a less obstructed view when the top is where it belongs.\n\nThe 330Ci’s top is thick enough to provide considerable sound-deadening effect even at freeway speeds. Of course if it’s down, you might as well be in a foundry when motoring on the freeway.\n\nOf the XXLT persuasion, I nonetheless felt quite comfortable behind the wheel of this car which is officially designated a mini-compact. Because of the space taken up by the motors and the hideaway space for the top, the 330Ci has only 80 cubic feet of interior space. As you might infer, that doesn’t leave a great deal of lounging room for the alleged two rear-seat passengers, nor does it provide a trunk that would welcome multiple sets of Pings (7.7 cubic feet). The sedan version of this car is a compact, with 90.8 cubic feet of cabin space and a still-tidy 10.7 cubic feet in back. The biggest reason to go for the 330Ci over the 325Ci is of course hidden under that sleek hood.\n\nMost convertible buyers are probably more interested in show than go, but the BMW-inclined will appreciate 0-60 times right at the 7-second mark, with the five-speed manual transmission. Equipped with the smaller engine, the car would need a couple of seconds more to accomplish the feat.\n\nThe 3-liter inline six produces 225 hp at 5,900 rpm, and 214 foot-pounds of torque at 3,500. It’s almost surprising that the car drag races as well as it does, for the convertible weighs in at a portly 3,600 pounds and change.\n\nAs the peak-power curve suggests, the car begs to be ridden hard. It pulled decently from about 2,000 rpm, but the big surge started at 4,000 or so and rose triumphantly toward the redline, the exhaust note turning from civilized to feral somewhere along the way.\n\nClutch actuation was easily managed, and the shifter was, if not the best ever, nonetheless delightful. The first three ratios are spaced widely enough that you’ll want to keep the revs up while shifting, but that’s half the fun. Fourth gear is a direct 1:1 ratio, while fifth is a mild (0.74:1) overdrive, yielding about 24 mph per thousand engine turns.\n\nEPA estimates for this car are 20 mpg city, 28 highway. The 24.3 I logged in enthusiastic country drives, with a bit of freeway thrown in, speaks to the efficiency of BMW’s variable-cam design. The engine has two knock sensors, but premium unleaded is still strongly advised. The first time I dashed into a familiar curve, I was impressed with the rigidity of the chassis and the crispness of the steering, qualities that just became more endearing as our relationship matured. Many convertibles suffer from having their steel carapace cut off, exhibiting their displeasure by shaking and feeling uncoordinated when the road turns interesting. In the 330Ci, I soon went looking for road signs that looked like snakes. Grip comes from excellent chassis engineering and having plenty of rubber underneath. Standard skins are 205/50/17s, all-season, V-rated for continuous running up to 149 mph. You can get performance tires, both wider and bigger around, by opting for a sports package, though you hardly need to.\n\nThe 330Ci is rear-drive, of course, and has both traction control and stability control. The cool thing about this stability control, whose primary function is to keep you out of the woods by reining the car in when too much is asked of it in the way of cornering, is that it can be adjusted, as well as turned off.\n\nWhy would you want to do that? BMW cites very slippery road surfaces. Anybody who favors a rear-drive car over front-drive will think of other applications – you know, closed-course, professional driver, don’t try this at home stuff. Anyway, pushing the DSC button turns off the stability control, while one quick punch tells it to use only selective braking to accomplish its mission, leaving engine control to the driver. I found the car quite obliging even with DSC on.\n\nNeither feds nor insurance folks have crash-tested this car, although the sedan version got very high marks from the insurance institute – but no fair extrapolating. The presence of dual-stage front air bags, along with a pair on the side, is no small comfort. The brakes are hefty ventilated discs all around, antilocked of course. Pedal feel was precise and crisp and stopping distances breathtaking.\n\nThe 330Ci has an enhanced audio system, a Harman Kardon unit which would give Bose a run in clarity and presence.\n\nAlas, Edmunds.com says most folks are paying close to full retail for this car, but that is no surprise. At the suggested price, the test car would cost you $873 a month, assuming 20 percent down, 10 percent interest and 48 installments.",

      "expert_review": "Posted on 10/17/02\nVehicle Overview\nEntry-level BMW shoppers whod like a little more power than the 325 provides can still step up to the 330, which holds a larger six-cylinder engine. A front armrest and a headrest in the center rear seat are standard for the 2003 model year. A rain sensor with an automatic headlight control has been added to the Premium Package. BMWs optional navigation system has been upgraded to DVD-based operation and can now be installed along with an in-dash CD player.\n\nIn addition to the four-door 330i, the lineup includes a 330Ci coupe and convertible. Unlike the 325, there is no wagon in the 330 Series. All versions have rear-wheel drive except the 330xi, which is equipped with all-wheel drive (AWD). AWD models include Dynamic Stability Control to help prevent skids.\n\nBecause of the companys sporty image and its reputation for quality, 3 Series models have been popular among first-time luxury-car buyers. BMWs most popular line competes against the Audi A4, Jaguar X-Type, Lexus IS 300 and Mercedes-Benz C-Class.\n\nExterior\nThe 330 sedans and coupes look alike at a glance, but they share no body panels. The coupes styling also serves the convertible model. BMWs familiar look features four round headlamps and a twin-kidney grille, but the sedans front end is different.\n\nThe coupe and convertible are 176.7 inches long overall, while the sedan measures 176 inches in length. All 330 models have a 107.3-inch wheelbase. The windshields on the coupe and convertible are slanted 2 degrees more than the sedans windshield. Convertible models have a power folding top.\n\nInterior\nThe 330 sedans hold five passengers, while the coupe and convertible are four-seaters. Space is ample up front with twin bucket seats, but passengers cant stretch their legs in the backseat. A typical BMW dashboard has large, easy-to-read gauges. Simple stereo and climate control push-buttons are in easy reach.\n\nUnder the Hood\nBMWs 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder engine cranks out 225 horsepower and teams with a five-speed-manual or five-speed-automatic transmission that has a provision for manual gear changes.\n\nSafety\nSide-impact and side curtain-type airbags for the front seats are standard. Rear-seat side-impact airbags are optional in the sedan. The front airbags deploy with less force in low-speed impacts. Antilock brakes and traction control are standard. BMWs Dynamic Stability Control reduces engine power and applies the brakes to prevent skids.\n\nDriving Impressions\nPlenty of enthusiast drivers still consider BMW the standard by which other makes are judged. At a time when luxury amenities are promoted, BMW stresses the dynamic handling qualities of its automobiles. Athletic maneuvers are the norm in both ordinary and demanding driving.\n\nBoth 3 Series models promise spirited performance and crisp handling, but the 330 delivers greater exuberance than its 325 companion. But performance of the 325 will satisfy many owners. The 3.0-liter engine actually feels so strong that it almost has to be restrained a bit.\n\nBMWs manual gearshift is sheer joy to manipulate. The 330s clutch behavior is performance oriented, so getting truly smooth takeoffs takes some practice.\n\nAvailable AWD is a bonus for buyers in the Snow Belt because a rear-drive BMW can get finicky on slippery surfaces. The seats are firm and driver oriented, but getting in and out of this vehicle isnt quite as easy as in some other cars.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2003 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "For many driving enthusiasts, the BMW 3-Series is the pinnacle of sports sedans. It is the car that has defined the genre, with roots stretching back to the beloved 2002ti model of the late 1960s and early ’70s.\n\nFor that reason, it is the model that most automakers try to emulate when making their premium small cars. The competition is coming at BMW not only from Europe, but also from Japan and the United States.\n\nWhile many competitors come close to matching the 3-Series, when it comes to being a member of the in-crowd, the original is still the greatest.\n\nThe 3-Series is the cheapest BMW you can buy and is available in coupe sedan and wagon. Two engines double-overhead-cam, 24-valve in-line 6-cylinder engines are available. All 325 models come with a 184-horsepower 2.5-liter six-cylinder, while the more expensive 330 models come with a 3-liter 225-horsepower six-cylinder.\n\nA five-speed manual transmission and a Steptronic automatic transmission are available. While most 3-series cars are rear wheel drive, the car is available in all-wheel-drive, dubbed xi.\n\nGot all that?\n\nBMW loaned a 330xi with the Steptronic automatic for testing.\n\nIt turns out that the 330xi with the Steptronic still has enough sporting manners to keep an enthusiast enthralled. As the car comes alive, its engine snarls like a four-wheeled Bavarian beast.\n\nPower from the engine is smooth and assured and the all-wheel-drive system is unobtrusive while providing tremendous grip. Handling is responsive and precise. The steering is nicely weighted without feeling heavy or stiff. Body lean comes only at the limit. Braking is strong with progressive pedal feel.\n\nThe Steptronic is mated nicely to the vehicle’s motor, allowing for manual shifting without a clutch. Tip the shifter forward to upshift, backward to downshift. While not as much fun as a manual, it still makes the car much more rewarding to drive.\n\nOpting for an automatic will cost you about a half-second in 0-60 mph performance, while the all-wheel-drive extracts another half-second. 0-60 is still a none too pokey 7.5 seconds.\n\nThe usual laundry list of electronic handling aids are standard, including Dynamic Stability Control, traction control, anti-lock brakes, Electronic Brake Proportioning and Dynamic Brake Control. While I could explain in detail how all this functions, let’s just say it’s designed to prevent you from losing traction and sliding into a ditch. It all works invisibly.\n\nFront bucket seats are firm but comfortable. A seat bottom cushion extension helps to add support for taller drivers. This is a nice touch that other automakers should emulate. Leg room is good as well. The front cabin has decent room, despite its somewhat narrow feel.\n\nBackseat foot room and headroom are good, but knee room is scarce, making the area cramped without some compromises from front seat passengers. It’s a reminder that this car is about the same size as a Toyota Corolla.\n\nTrunk space is better than its rated size suggests.\n\nThe 3-Series starts at $28,495 for the 325i sedan. The base price of the 330xi is $37,045, yet it’s still lacking in some of the luxuries one might expect, including leather trim (which is a $1,450 stand-alone option or available in an option package.)\n\nThe test vehicle came equipped with one of three option packages, a $1,200 Sports Package.\n\nThe Sports Package adds an aero kit, sports seats and steering wheel, 17” run-flat tires with special wheels and a tire pressure monitor.\n\nRun-flat tires allow you to continue driving at speed despite a puncture. As is true of other tire-pressure monitoring systems hooked to run-flat tires, when one tire lost a couple pounds of pressure, the system was activated. An idiot light comes on, glaring at the driver to the point of distraction. Yet the tire was fine. The system is a nice uch, but I turned it off.\n\nIn addition, buyers can opt for a $2,900 Premium Package, which adds a moonroof, auto-dimming mirror, wood and leather trim, lumbar support, rain sensors and automatic headlamps or a $1,000 cold-weather package (fold-down seats with ski rack, heated seats, headlamp washers and rear armrest.) Other options include parking distance control, high-intensity discharge headlamps, navigation system, rear door-mounted side airbags, and metallic paint.\n\nWhile the test car lacked most of these options, you’d never miss them. The door locks and headlamps operated manually. The steering wheel adjusted manually for rake and reach.\n\nInstead BMW put the money where it counts: in the performance. That’s what enthusiasts crave and that’s what the 330xi delivers.\n\nJust try and match it.",

      "expert_review": "I do not bring a lot of sympathy to any BMW. I think the cars are a bit overpriced and, because of how the option packages are structured, getting your Bimmer kitted to your liking can add thousands more. Steam gently wafts from my ears every time I use the company’s iDrive system — the magic knob interface for the navigation, audio, communications and climate menus. BMW’s recent “flame surfacing” styling exertions, on cars such as the Z4 and 5-series, leave me colder than the 10th planet.\n\nLastly, there are just too many of them in Los Angeles. BMWs swarm this city like Bavarian roaches.\n\nSo it’s with no small cognitive dissonance that I report that the new 3-series, redesigned for model year 2006, is a spectacular car: lean and perfectly balanced, ineffably masculine and refined, and built with a futuristic precision that makes me wish the company made space shuttles.\n\nCar watchers held their breath waiting to see whether the redesigned 3-series — BMW’s bedrock product, accounting for more than half its 1.2-million sales worldwide — would carry on with the widely derided flame surfacing. When the new car appeared, critics declared it “conservative,” and so, perforce, a rebuke of BMW Group design chief Chris Bangle. I’m not so sure. The wick has been turned down, certainly, but the 3-series still has sagging ventral accents along the rocker panel and a loose concavity in the car’s flanks below the beltline. The headlight assemblies have the swept-amber canthus of the Z4, and the hood rises in a second tier over the front fenders like the 7-series. Looks pretty Bangle-esque to me.\n\nIn any event, the 3-series sculpting will race no pulses, and maybe that’s just the point. Life begins in earnest once your butt lands in the driver’s seat.\n\nA couple of notes from the cockpit: Burl walnut wood trim is standard equipment on the 330i, and it looks terrific. This may be the most cabinet-worthy lumber in any car south of $70,000. Other above-the-call standard equipment includes a cooling compartment in the center armrest; a 13-speaker Logic7 surround-sound audio system; automatic, road-following Xenon headlights and rain-sensing wipers, and plenty more for the car’s base price of $36,995, delivered. Buyers will still have to pony up for leather upholstery ($1,450), heated seats ($500) and the navigation system ($2,000); even so, the 330i seems like a lot more car for the money than its predecessor.\n\nThe car’s interior design is spare and self-assured. There are no grand, sweeping consoles, amoebic climate outlets or Art Nouveau dash contours. Models with the iDrive do have a second, humped binnacle in the dash to house the LCD screen — like the 5-series cars — and this continues to strike me as odd placement. Otherwise, you couldn’t ask for a more businesslike environment.\n\nAs always, BMWs have a great sense of touch. The 3-series’ wands behind the steering wheel (turn signals, wipers and cruise control) have heavy springs inside them and move through their range of motion on heavy cams. The detents of the switches, from the steering wheel to the window and audio controls, require exactly the same inch-ounce of pressure to activate. The parking brake ratchets up with a stiff, smooth burr. When people talk in broad terms about a car’s sense of refinement, this is the stuff they are talking about.\n\nAnyone wanting to tease out what makes a BMW so much fun to drive could start with the steering wheel. Slightly smaller than others in rim-to-rim diameter, thick in cross-section and densely padded under the leather skin, the BMW wheel feels like a precision instrument. The padding is important to prevent fatigue, since so much fine vibration from the tires is allowed back in the form of road feedback.\n\nThat steering wheel is connected to some of the best hardware in the business: The front-end steering geometry gives the cars their excellent compromise between self-centering and road feel. The 3-series feels instinctive, incisive, composed and utterly predictable when driven hard. I flogged a car equipped with the sport package — high-bolstered seats and 18-inch tires — from Los Angeles to Monterey and back a couple of weeks ago, and the car stuck to the road like DOT paint.\n\nUp front, the 2006 model has forged aluminum lower control arms, aluminum steering rack and sub-frame, and revised McPherson struts. In back, a five-link rear suspension replaces the familiar four-link setup. BMW’s Active Steering system — which kicks in counter-steering if the stability system detects a skid or even a strong crosswind — is also available.\n\nThe stability system also integrates a number of new smart-brake functions, including “Comfort Stop,” which smoothes out the braking forces in the last few feet before a stop; and “Start-off Assistant,” which is supposed to resist the car rolling back on a hill before a forward gear is engaged. No sense leaving your back bumper on the streets of San Francisco.\n\nCurrently, the 3-series comes in two flavors, both powered by the same 3.0-liter six-cylinder engine featuring variable-valve timing, BMW’s Valvetronic valve-lift control (eliminating the need for a butterfly throttle) and lightweight magnesium-aluminum engine construction. The 325i ($30,995, delivered) produces 215 horsepower; the 330i, equipped with a trick three-stage induction system, freer breathing exhaust and more aggressive software, puts out 255 hp. The latter motor could teach Bordeaux butter a thing or two about smoothness. It’s not the most potent engine in this segment, but thanks to its highly orchestrated valve-works, it produces peak torque (220 pound-feet) at 2,750 rpm and keeps pulling like that until nearly 6,000 rpm, all with an exhaust note that sounds like a mechanized hummingbird.\n\nOur test car was equipped with the six-speed manual transmission — the new car’s clutch has a smoother uptake than the old, and the gear action feels less rubbery. This powertrain delivers respectable mileage and acceleration, something like 0-60 mph in 6 seconds. The company’s six-speed automatic is optional.\n\nIn its well-grooved way, BMW will eventually bring out a coupe, a station wagon and an M3 variant of the car. The 3-series is not so much a car but a boutique.\n\nWith this latest generation, I’m running out of reasons not to like this car. It’s still a bit of an automotive cliché, especially in L.A., but you can hardly fault the car or company for that. The new 3-series is that rarest thing in Hollywood: a worthy sequel.\n\n– – –\n\n2006 BMW 330i\n\nBase price: $36,300 ($695 destination and delivery)\n\nPrice, as tested: $42,365\n\nPowertrain: 3.0-liter, 24-valve inline 6, dual-overhead cam, with variable-valve timing and lift; six-speed manual transmission; rear-wheel drive.\n\nHorsepower: 255 at 6,000 rpm\n\nTorque: 220 pound-feet at 2,750 rpm\n\nCurb weight: 3,417 pounds\n\n0-60 mph: 6 seconds\n\nWheelbase: 108.7 inches\n\nOverall length: 178.2 inches\n\nEPA fuel economy: 20 miles per gallon city, 30 mpg highway\n\nFinal thoughts: Voted most popular; letters in track\n\n– – –\n\nAutomotive critic Dan Neil can be reached at dan.neil@latimes.com.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The redesigned BMW 3 Series comes with a renewed focus on technology and luxury, but it loses some of its driving character in the bargain.\n\nVersus the competition: There are other options in this class if you want to have fun behind the wheel, but the 3 Series’ technology credentials and excellent cabin hold up well against the field.\n\nAfter I finished testing the redesigned 2019 BMW 330i, I took a look at the headlines of the 3 Series stories I’ve written over the past year: “Is the Mojo Back?” “Can BMW Lift the Crown Once Again?” All my 3 Series stories have been about the past as much as the future because I’ve been hoping for the sports sedan to hark back to the BMW of old — the one that led the field in driving dynamics and was a blast to pilot everywhere, from an autocross to any mountain road you could find.\n\nBut the new car isn’t the analog, canyon-carving 3 Series I longed for. Time and a shift in market demand seem to have driven the newest generation of the 3 (codenamed G20) in a different direction. In that regard, it has succeeded. Layers of technology drape over both the cabin and the driving experience, and while that’s made the car more modern and luxurious, it’s also lost something in the balance.\n\nThe redesigned 3 Series competes in a crowded field of compact luxury sports sedans, notably the Mercedes-Benz C-Class, Audi A4 and our reigning Best of 2019 winner, the Genesis G70.\n\nSmall Engine, Big Power\n\nThere is one place, however, where the BMW hasn’t lost a step: under the hood. The 330i comes with a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder making 255 horsepower and 295 pounds-feet of torque, mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission. (Regrettably, BMW has discontinued the manual transmission.) Rear-wheel drive was standard in my 330i test car; all-wheel drive is optional in the 330i xDrive. The new 330i’s power numbers represent modest increases of 7 hp and 37 pounds-feet of torque over the 2018 car without changing displacement.\n\nIt’s an impressive engine for a turbo four. The power band is wide and kicks in early; maximum torque opens up at just 1,550 rpm, and the transmission is adept at finding gears quickly when you press the accelerator. Flip the 330i into Sport mode and the powertrain jumps up eagerly. I mostly left the transmission to its own devices while driving hard, and it was adept at holding onto gears to give me a good boost of power on corner exits, as well as downshifting under harder gas-pedal inputs. The powertrain’s instant responsiveness was the best part of the 330i driving experience — in sharp contrast to the steering and suspension’s lack of communication.\n\n2019 BMW 330i | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\nThe Things We Left Behind\n\nIn the previous-generation 3 Series, the addition of the optional M Suspension and steering really shored up the car’s dynamics, and I’d hoped the same would be true here. My test vehicle came with all the performance boxes checked: M Sport Package with sport steering, Track Handling Package with M Sport brakes and differential, and an Adaptive M Suspension, all of which added $8,150 to the 330i’s price tag.\n\nGiven this is pretty much the sharpest 330i you can get, it was disappointing. My initial impression was that the suspension and steering vagueness were noticeable but not an impediment, but after a week in the car, my mind changed. If you’re looking for a vehicle in this class that emphasizes driving enjoyment, you’ll have to look elsewhere (I’d recommend going in the direction of the aforementioned G70 or the Alfa Romeo Giulia).\n\nThe BMW’s steering really lets you down when you push the car. I could feel the body rolling around behind me when I put the 330i through a dynamic lap in the canyons above Malibu. The steering’s weight isn’t really the issue — it firms up in Sport mode to provide enough resistance — it’s just missing any sort of feedback as the car’s speed increases, which is exactly when you most need to know what the front wheels are doing.\n\nAs a counterpoint to this, the 330i rides well on the road and has excellent highway manners — as it should, given the car’s lack of dynamism. It’s apparent that the 330i was tuned for comfort, not hijinks. It’s just grown up a bit too much for my taste; those qualities don’t necessarily have to be mutually exclusive, though it is difficult to build a car that can do both things well.\n\nThe last hope for the 3 Series is its second version, the M340i, which will debut as a 2020 model later in 2019. It has a 382-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder that makes 369 pounds-feet of torque and goes like stink. Zero-to-60 flies by in just 4.2 seconds, BMW says. I tested one on the track, where the engine proved well suited for that environment.\n\nEPA-estimated fuel economy for the 330i is 26/36/30 mpg city/highway/combined for RWD models, with AWD 330i’s coming in slightly behind that at 25/34/28 mpg, both on required premium gasoline.\n\nInterior and Technology Improvements\n\nThe new 330i is a technology powerhouse. My test vehicle came equipped with both a 12.3-inch digital instrument panel and a 10.25-inch multimedia touchscreen (an 8.8-inch screen is standard), giving the driver’s side and center of the dashboard a futuristic feel. BMW gives you a lot of options for how you can interact with the car’s multimedia functions: via touchscreen, using a rotary dial by the shifter, with voice commands or even via gestures.\n\nIf that all sounds overwhelming, that’s because it is — at first. There are definitely more efficient ways to use the system in different situations, and I was thankful I had tested a few other BMW products with this version of iDrive before I had the 3 Series; without that, I would have felt much more lost. The good news is that once you get it down — including the best cadence for the voice controls — it all works quite seamlessly. But again, if you’re not tech-savvy or prefer a simpler setup, it will be a lot to take in.\n\nOne thing to watch out for: You can get Apple CarPlay connectivity (wireless, at that), but it comes at a cost. The first year will be free, but using it thereafter will cost $80 per year (you can set up and pay via the car’s multimedia system). Android users like yours truly will continue to be completely out of luck.\n\nThe 3 Series has grown in this redesign. The wheelbase has stretched by 1.6 inches, and that spaces out the cabin a bit. According to the official specifications, there’s only 0.1 inch more backseat legroom, but when I hopped back there it felt like more than that. It’s still not the biggest backseat in this class, but now I can at least sit behind where I set the driver’s seat somewhat comfortably (I’m 5-foot-11). It also offers enough support for longer trips, as well. The trunk provides 17.0 cubic feet of cargo room, up from 13.0 last year. This gives the 3 Series a big advantage over its competition: The A4 has 13.0 cubic feet, the C-Class has 12.6 and the G70 falls way behind, at 10.5 cubic feet.\n\n2019 BMW 330i | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\nSafety Blanket\n\nThe 2019 330i’s technology upgrades aren’t limited to multimedia. It offers a ton of optional safety technology, as well, and my test vehicle had it all. The requisite luxury safety features were present, like forward automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist, blind spot warnings, and front and rear parking sensors. But the 3 Series goes above and beyond the requisite, particularly with two features: Extended Traffic Jam Assistant and Backup Assistant.\n\nExtended Traffic Jam Assistant works at speeds of less than 37 mph on limited-access highways, and it doesn’t require the driver to touch the wheel. A small camera in the instrument cluster makes sure the driver is paying attention, and as long as that’s the case, the system remains activated and guides the car down the highway in one lane. The system can be a bit tricky to turn on and keep on, but it made the Los Angeles traffic I had parked myself in much more bearable once it was up and running. Backup Assistant is similarly impressive: If you have to pull forward into a tricky space, the car remembers up to 50 yards of the path and can recreate it in Reverse, steering automatically on the way out to avoid obstacles or bushes.\n\nIt’s also worth noting the myriad camera views offered, from a 360-degree view to a simulated view that rotates around the car. For example, if you slowly approach a curb while parking, the camera will automatically shift to show you a top-down view of the hood so you can see exactly how close you are to objects in front of you.\n\n2019 BMW 330i | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\nValue and Pricing\n\nThe 330i I tested was pretty much fully loaded. It starts at $41,245 (including destination charge) for RWD models, while AWD versions start at $43,745 — a $2,000 premium. Adding all the multimedia and safety technology I mentioned earlier, plus leather upholstery and a fantastic Portimao Blue Metallic paint, drove the price tag for our tester up to a dizzying $59,920.\n\nThat isn’t to say the BMW is alone in reaching such dizzying price heights; you can option competitors in this class to similar places. But there are also much better deals to be had, particularly in the G70. It may not offer the same level of technology, but for much less money you get a larger engine, all-wheel drive, Nappa leather and a much better driving experience (and don’t forget Android Auto). If you want to price the 330i to match a G70, you’ll have to give back many of the features that earn it distinction.\n\nAfter my week with the 2019 330i concluded, I hadn’t embraced the new paradigm. There was still some wistfulness for the 3 Series of old, and I think it might always be there for me. Perhaps one day the sedan will be both a technological and driving powerhouse, but the current iteration’s delights come more through your eyes than your hands.\n\n(Disclaimer: The wheels and tires in these photographs don’t match; the 330i I tested came equipped with the Track Handling Package, which normally adds black wheels and conventional (not run-flat) tires. The car I tested has bi-color wheels and originally came with run-flat tires, which BMW swapped out to non-run-flats so performance would be as intended. BMW did say this combination will be available for order in the 2020 model year.)\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The redesigned BMW 3 Series comes with a renewed focus on technology and luxury, but it loses some of its driving character in the bargain.\n\nVersus the competition: There are other options in this class if you want to have fun behind the wheel, but the 3 Series’ technology credentials and excellent cabin hold up well against the field.\n\nAfter I finished testing the redesigned 2019 BMW 330i, I took a look at the headlines of the 3 Series stories I’ve written over the past year: “Is the Mojo Back?” “Can BMW Lift the Crown Once Again?” All my 3 Series stories have been about the past as much as the future because I’ve been hoping for the sports sedan to hark back to the BMW of old — the one that led the field in driving dynamics and was a blast to pilot everywhere, from an autocross to any mountain road you could find.\n\nBut the new car isn’t the analog, canyon-carving 3 Series I longed for. Time and a shift in market demand seem to have driven the newest generation of the 3 (codenamed G20) in a different direction. In that regard, it has succeeded. Layers of technology drape over both the cabin and the driving experience, and while that’s made the car more modern and luxurious, it’s also lost something in the balance.\n\nThe redesigned 3 Series competes in a crowded field of compact luxury sports sedans, notably the Mercedes-Benz C-Class, Audi A4 and our reigning Best of 2019 winner, the Genesis G70.\n\nSmall Engine, Big Power\n\nThere is one place, however, where the BMW hasn’t lost a step: under the hood. The 330i comes with a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder making 255 horsepower and 295 pounds-feet of torque, mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission. (Regrettably, BMW has discontinued the manual transmission.) Rear-wheel drive was standard in my 330i test car; all-wheel drive is optional in the 330i xDrive. The new 330i’s power numbers represent modest increases of 7 hp and 37 pounds-feet of torque over the 2018 car without changing displacement.\n\nIt’s an impressive engine for a turbo four. The power band is wide and kicks in early; maximum torque opens up at just 1,550 rpm, and the transmission is adept at finding gears quickly when you press the accelerator. Flip the 330i into Sport mode and the powertrain jumps up eagerly. I mostly left the transmission to its own devices while driving hard, and it was adept at holding onto gears to give me a good boost of power on corner exits, as well as downshifting under harder gas-pedal inputs. The powertrain’s instant responsiveness was the best part of the 330i driving experience — in sharp contrast to the steering and suspension’s lack of communication.\n\n2019 BMW 330i | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\nThe Things We Left Behind\n\nIn the previous-generation 3 Series, the addition of the optional M Suspension and steering really shored up the car’s dynamics, and I’d hoped the same would be true here. My test vehicle came with all the performance boxes checked: M Sport Package with sport steering, Track Handling Package with M Sport brakes and differential, and an Adaptive M Suspension, all of which added $8,150 to the 330i’s price tag.\n\nGiven this is pretty much the sharpest 330i you can get, it was disappointing. My initial impression was that the suspension and steering vagueness were noticeable but not an impediment, but after a week in the car, my mind changed. If you’re looking for a vehicle in this class that emphasizes driving enjoyment, you’ll have to look elsewhere (I’d recommend going in the direction of the aforementioned G70 or the Alfa Romeo Giulia).\n\nThe BMW’s steering really lets you down when you push the car. I could feel the body rolling around behind me when I put the 330i through a dynamic lap in the canyons above Malibu. The steering’s weight isn’t really the issue — it firms up in Sport mode to provide enough resistance — it’s just missing any sort of feedback as the car’s speed increases, which is exactly when you most need to know what the front wheels are doing.\n\nAs a counterpoint to this, the 330i rides well on the road and has excellent highway manners — as it should, given the car’s lack of dynamism. It’s apparent that the 330i was tuned for comfort, not hijinks. It’s just grown up a bit too much for my taste; those qualities don’t necessarily have to be mutually exclusive, though it is difficult to build a car that can do both things well.\n\nThe last hope for the 3 Series is its second version, the M340i, which will debut as a 2020 model later in 2019. It has a 382-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder that makes 369 pounds-feet of torque and goes like stink. Zero-to-60 flies by in just 4.2 seconds, BMW says. I tested one on the track, where the engine proved well suited for that environment.\n\nEPA-estimated fuel economy for the 330i is 26/36/30 mpg city/highway/combined for RWD models, with AWD 330i’s coming in slightly behind that at 25/34/28 mpg, both on required premium gasoline.\n\nInterior and Technology Improvements\n\nThe new 330i is a technology powerhouse. My test vehicle came equipped with both a 12.3-inch digital instrument panel and a 10.25-inch multimedia touchscreen (an 8.8-inch screen is standard), giving the driver’s side and center of the dashboard a futuristic feel. BMW gives you a lot of options for how you can interact with the car’s multimedia functions: via touchscreen, using a rotary dial by the shifter, with voice commands or even via gestures.\n\nIf that all sounds overwhelming, that’s because it is — at first. There are definitely more efficient ways to use the system in different situations, and I was thankful I had tested a few other BMW products with this version of iDrive before I had the 3 Series; without that, I would have felt much more lost. The good news is that once you get it down — including the best cadence for the voice controls — it all works quite seamlessly. But again, if you’re not tech-savvy or prefer a simpler setup, it will be a lot to take in.\n\nOne thing to watch out for: You can get Apple CarPlay connectivity (wireless, at that), but it comes at a cost. The first year will be free, but using it thereafter will cost $80 per year (you can set up and pay via the car’s multimedia system). Android users like yours truly will continue to be completely out of luck.\n\nThe 3 Series has grown in this redesign. The wheelbase has stretched by 1.6 inches, and that spaces out the cabin a bit. According to the official specifications, there’s only 0.1 inch more backseat legroom, but when I hopped back there it felt like more than that. It’s still not the biggest backseat in this class, but now I can at least sit behind where I set the driver’s seat somewhat comfortably (I’m 5-foot-11). It also offers enough support for longer trips, as well. The trunk provides 17.0 cubic feet of cargo room, up from 13.0 last year. This gives the 3 Series a big advantage over its competition: The A4 has 13.0 cubic feet, the C-Class has 12.6 and the G70 falls way behind, at 10.5 cubic feet.\n\n2019 BMW 330i | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\nSafety Blanket\n\nThe 2019 330i’s technology upgrades aren’t limited to multimedia. It offers a ton of optional safety technology, as well, and my test vehicle had it all. The requisite luxury safety features were present, like forward automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist, blind spot warnings, and front and rear parking sensors. But the 3 Series goes above and beyond the requisite, particularly with two features: Extended Traffic Jam Assistant and Backup Assistant.\n\nExtended Traffic Jam Assistant works at speeds of less than 37 mph on limited-access highways, and it doesn’t require the driver to touch the wheel. A small camera in the instrument cluster makes sure the driver is paying attention, and as long as that’s the case, the system remains activated and guides the car down the highway in one lane. The system can be a bit tricky to turn on and keep on, but it made the Los Angeles traffic I had parked myself in much more bearable once it was up and running. Backup Assistant is similarly impressive: If you have to pull forward into a tricky space, the car remembers up to 50 yards of the path and can recreate it in Reverse, steering automatically on the way out to avoid obstacles or bushes.\n\nIt’s also worth noting the myriad camera views offered, from a 360-degree view to a simulated view that rotates around the car. For example, if you slowly approach a curb while parking, the camera will automatically shift to show you a top-down view of the hood so you can see exactly how close you are to objects in front of you.\n\n2019 BMW 330i | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\nValue and Pricing\n\nThe 330i I tested was pretty much fully loaded. It starts at $41,245 (including destination charge) for RWD models, while AWD versions start at $43,745 — a $2,000 premium. Adding all the multimedia and safety technology I mentioned earlier, plus leather upholstery and a fantastic Portimao Blue Metallic paint, drove the price tag for our tester up to a dizzying $59,920.\n\nThat isn’t to say the BMW is alone in reaching such dizzying price heights; you can option competitors in this class to similar places. But there are also much better deals to be had, particularly in the G70. It may not offer the same level of technology, but for much less money you get a larger engine, all-wheel drive, Nappa leather and a much better driving experience (and don’t forget Android Auto). If you want to price the 330i to match a G70, you’ll have to give back many of the features that earn it distinction.\n\nAfter my week with the 2019 330i concluded, I hadn’t embraced the new paradigm. There was still some wistfulness for the 3 Series of old, and I think it might always be there for me. Perhaps one day the sedan will be both a technological and driving powerhouse, but the current iteration’s delights come more through your eyes than your hands.\n\n(Disclaimer: The wheels and tires in these photographs don’t match; the 330i I tested came equipped with the Track Handling Package, which normally adds black wheels and conventional (not run-flat) tires. The car I tested has bi-color wheels and originally came with run-flat tires, which BMW swapped out to non-run-flats so performance would be as intended. BMW did say this combination will be available for order in the 2020 model year.)\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "There are smaller vehicles than the 3 Series in BMW showrooms — cheaper ones, too, designed to lure first-time buyers. This means the 3 Series needs to be nicer, more sophisticated, more luxurious and have more content than ever before so that buyers trading in the lease on their 2 Series will have something to look forward to.\n\nYet the BMW 3 Series sedan has been only mildly updated a couple of times since the current generation was introduced. This year’s changes are powertrain-related, with new engines that prompted a model name change: I tested a 2017 330i, which was in 2016 known as the 328i (compare the two here). The new name is meant to draw attention to the all-new, 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine, replacing last year’s 2.0-liter, turbocharged four-cylinder engine. The new engine has 8 more horsepower, at 248 hp, and gains a few more pounds-feet of torque, rising from 255 to 258 pounds-feet.\n\nWe’re not sure why BMW’s updated the engine for such a minor power bump (not to mention fuel economy went down 1 mpg on the highway), but we suspect it’s in keeping with BMW’s traditional strategy of changing to a new powertrain before changing the rest of the car in a major redesign a couple of years later (Other automakers, like Toyota, do this too).\n\nAside from a couple of color changes and the Sport Line trim now being called the Sport Package, the engine is the extent of the changes for the BMW 330i for 2017. So how does the new engine do?\n\nNew Engine, Same Experience\n\nQuite well, actually. My test vehicle was a new 2017 BMW 330i optioned up the way you’d most likely lease one if you lived in Orange County, Calif. (where this car is ubiquitous). It had an eight-speed automatic transmission (a six-speed manual is also available) and rear-wheel drive, but no sport packages or any go-fast bits, so I got a good taste of the entry-level non-sport sedan.\n\nThe engine itself purrs well, but that purring noise is deceptive — it’s not actually coming from the exhaust, it’s coming from all around you. The sound is piped in through the speakers, which explains why it sounds like a straight six cylinder engine instead of a two-liter four cylinder.\n\nI don’t actually mind the sound. Plant your foot and the powerful little motor spins up quickly, propelling the car with authority and proving to be quite enjoyable to drive. It doesn’t lack for power in any gear, but the default Comfort mode in Driving Dynamics Control makes the drivetrain and suspension feel lazy. Pressing the gas doesn’t make a lot happen unless you dig deep, and the transmission isn’t eager to downshift under slower driving conditions. When it says Comfort, it means Comfort: the 330i is cushy, relaxed and even a bit ponderous in its powertrain responses.\n\nPop it into Sport mode, though, and the sedan wakes up considerably. Throttle response is much more immediate, and the transmission holds lower gears longer for better acceleration.\n\n“This is what I imagine a BMW sedan should feel like,” I found myself saying after keeping it in high-performance Sport mode for a while. Problem is, driving like this all the time — with the motor revving higher while just cruising along — gets tedious. I would have liked a sportier Comfort mode and a more comfortable Sport mode, not a Jekyll-and-Hyde situation that forces you to choose one personality over another.\n\nA Softer, Gentler BMW\n\nOne attribute BMW has dialed in well is ride comfort. Over a varying array of surfaces, very little upset the 330i regardless of what mode it was in. Chassis tuning is excellent, with little body roll, no impact harshness over bumps, and very satisfying sporty ride and handling.\n\nSteering is much less communicative than enthusiasts will remember from previous generations of BMW 3 series’, reinforcing the idea that BMW is now going after more mainstream buyers in an effort to chase sales. Shoppers getting out of a Toyota Camry and into a  BMW 330 will be impressed as hell with how the steering feels, but those cross-shopping new entries, like the Alfa Romeo Giulia, will be disappointed at the comparably bland numbness the supposed “Ultimate Driving Machine” exhibits.\n\nFamiliar, Outside and In\n\nInside, there’s nothing new to report — and that’s both good and bad. It’s good in that the interior is still the same familiar, well-laid-out, comfortable and high-quality environment that it’s always been. The materials are up to snuff, the multimedia system works better than it ever has, and the switches and levers all feel traditionally BMW — they’ll be very familiar to anyone who’s been leasing 3 Series sedans for the past 20 years. The gauges still light up orange at night in a unique and simple, highly visible arrangement that forgoes a gimmicky all-digital gauge screen, like the head-up-inspired Virtual Cockpit in the latest Audi A4. The front seats are still comfortable, the rear seats are still a bit cramped (not unusual for this class), and the 3 Series still looks, feels and even smells like a familiar BMW 3 Series inside.\n\nBut that lack of change is starting to catch up to the BMW 3 Series. It still uses an annoying spring-back transmission shift lever that can be confusing for people not familiar with the type. Spring-back, European-style turn signal levers are present, as well. Leather upholstery is still not standard, even in the mid-$40,000 price bracket, and neither is a backup camera. Audi has updated its latest offerings nicely, and the latest Mercedes-Benz C-Class has a stunning interior with luxurious materials and state-of-the-art amenities.\n\nAt least the 3 Series is still one of the safest compact luxury sedans you can buy, earning top scores from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and a five-star overall rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nWhile it will help you survive the crash, though, it isn’t as advanced as some newer models in avoiding the crash, according to IIHS’ category report for mid-size luxury cars, which ranks the BMW 3 Series lower than competitors due to lesser performance in automatic braking tests.\n\nNot Getting Any Cheaper\n\nMSRP for the 330i I tested was $39,745, a fairly lofty price for a car that doesn’t include a lot of advanced safety features. My test model added some popular and common equipment add-ons, like Driver Assistance Package and Premium Package, plus navigation, heated front seats, leather upholstery and 18-inch wheels for a grand total of $47,345. That’s a lot of money for a car without forward collision warning, adaptive cruise control or even blind spot warning. So the BMW 330i definitely doesn’t win on value, but given that leasing is very strong within the BMW brand, that price often doesn’t matter to repeat buyers — only their monthly payment.\n\nThe new 330i sedan is ready for an update, a next-generation model to match some of the newer offerings on the market, but if tradition, familiarity and the badge on the hood are all more important to you, the latest BMW 3 Series still delivers.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
