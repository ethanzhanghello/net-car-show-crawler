      "expert_review": "The verdict: When you need to get away from it all, the redesigned 2021 BMW M440i convertible is comfortable for cruising, sporty in corners and classy all the while.\n\nVersus the competition: The 4 Series convertible’s switch from a retractable hardtop to a power-folding soft top aligns it with luxury competition from Audi and Mercedes-Benz, and the M440i’s focus on comfort over maximum performance is sensible for a droptop.\n\nThe M440i is the mid-level performance car in the 4 Series lineup, slotting between the base 430i (powered by a turbocharged four-cylinder engine) and the high-performance M4 (twin-turbo inline-six-cylinder engine). The M440i’s inline-six has a single turbocharger and works with a 48-volt mild-hybrid system. The 2021 430i and M440i are available in coupe and convertible form, but the M4 is coupe-only for 2021 (an M4 convertible arrives as a 2022 model). For more details on each version, check out the BMW 4 Series specs comparison.\n\nRelated: 2021 BMW 4 Series Convertible Drops Its Cover, and Its (Soft) Top\n\nThe 2021 M440i convertible starts at $64,995 (including a $995 destination charge) and comes with rear-wheel drive. A handful of stand-alone options and BMW’s Executive, Parking Assistance and Dynamic Handling packages increased our test car’s price to $74,670.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThe M440i is no M4, but its 382-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter six-cylinder still packs a performance punch, with plenty of low-end torque and reserve power for high-speed passing. The six-cylinder teams with an eight-speed automatic transmission, and the duo is good for an EPA-estimated 23/31/26 mpg city/highway/combined. The automatic is quick to kick down when you want more power, but shift paddle response is sluggish — even in the car’s sportier drive modes.\n\nOur M440i had the optional adaptive M suspension. Ride quality was good in the car’s Comfort mode even on older, pockmarked pavement. Our test car had low-profile summer performance tires on optional 19-inch wheels, but the suspension soaked up road imperfections, preventing them from disturbing the cabin.\n\nWhen the roads are in better shape or you’re pushing the car harder, there are Sport and Sport Plus modes that firm up the suspension and alter other aspects of the driving experience, like transmission response and steering feel. The differences aren’t dramatic in Sport, but transmission shift points are markedly more aggressive in Sport Plus.\n\nThe M440i’s braking system has ventilated discs, four-piston front calipers and single-piston rear calipers. The brakes shed speed easily, but the pedal is a little touchy at times.\n\nConvertible Commentary\n\nBMW says the 4 Series’ new power soft top is around 40% lighter than the previous retractable hard top, which helps lower the car’s center of gravity. The top’s operation is quiet and smooth, and BMW says it takes 18 seconds to lower or raise (it took about 20 seconds for us). The top is operable up to 31 mph.\n\nWith the top and side windows up, there’s a little more noise in the cabin from nearby cars than you’d hear in a coupe, but the difference is minimal on suburban streets. There’s some wind and tire noise at highway speeds when the top is up, but wind buffeting is light with the top down.\n\nTop-up visibility is mixed. The lack of B-pillars creates an unobstructed view over your left shoulder, but a small rear window and the soft-top fabric conspire to make larger blind spots when looking over your right shoulder before changing lanes or backing up. The reduced rear visibility is offset by helpful rear and 360-degree camera system views, the latter of which is optional.\n\nThe soft top is more compact when folded than was the retractable hard top, BMW says, which increases trunk space slightly. The lowered top takes up the upper half of the trunk, but you get this space back when the top is raised and the collapsible partition is out of the way.\n\nThe Interior\n\nThe M440i’s cabin will feel familiar if you’ve been in a newer BMW lately. The dashboard design is all-new, and our test car had an optional fully digital instrument panel and 10.25-inch center screen, but there’s still a strong visual connection to the previous 4 Series.\n\nMost of the interior surfaces are finished in high-quality materials, but the matte-finish wood trim on the center console had a plasticky appearance that was out of place in a nearly $75,000 luxury convertible. The car’s drive mode buttons, positioned aft of the gear selector on the center console, also aren’t the easiest to use without looking.\n\nThe power-adjustable driver’s seat includes side bolster and lumbar adjustments, along with a manual seat cushion extender. It’s comfortable and not overly restrictive, and options like seat heaters, a heated steering wheel and a neck-level heating system should help extend convertible season in the northern U.S. The two-person backseat, however, is snug for adults, with minimal legroom and an upright backrest.\n\nThe standard iDrive multimedia system’s onscreen menus are easy to navigate with the system’s console knob controller, but both the standard 8.8-inch center display and the optional 10.25-inch one are touchscreens, so you can tap the screen to make selections, too. This is especially useful when using Apple CarPlay or Android Auto, as both interfaces are optimized for touchscreens.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2021 BMW 4 Series: More Power, More Tech, More Grille, Just … More on the 4\n2021 BMW M3 and M4: M Stands for Manual\nWhich Convertibles Offer AWD or 4WD?\nResearch Convertibles\nShop for a 2021 BMW M440i\nSafety and Driver-Assist Features\n\nThe 2021 BMW 4 Series convertible hadn’t been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety as of publication, and it’s unlikely IIHS will test it in the future; the only current convertible it has tested is the Ford Mustang.\n\nThe M440i’s standard active-safety features include forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning, blind spot warning, rear cross-traffic alert and automatic high-beam headlights. The optional Driving Assistance Professional Package adds adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability, front cross-traffic alert and BMW’s Extended Traffic Jam Assistant, a hands-free driver-assist system for limited-access highways. The convertible also has a rollover protection system with two pop-up roll bars behind the rear-seat head restraints.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nThe M440i convertible’s $64,995 starting price falls between the $61,645 Audi S5 and $66,550 Mercedes-AMG C43 cabriolets (see their specs compared). The M440i convertible is rear-wheel drive, while both the S5 and C43 have all-wheel drive. The C43 costs more to start, but its standard equipment includes features that are optional on the BMW, including heated front seats, a neck-level heating system, a digital instrument panel, a 10.25-inch center display and a premium stereo.\n\nOur M440i was pricey at nearly $75,000, and even then, it didn’t have BMW’s hands-free driving system. That would have added $1,700 to the already-high total.\n\nIf the M440i’s pricing — or its controversial grille design — isn’t a deal-breaker for you, it’s worth a test drive if you’re shopping for a luxury droptop. Its combination of power, luxury and style is highly appealing.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Is the BMW M440i a Good Car?\n\nAn increasingly rare breed, the 2025 BMW M440i is a satisfying option for coupe fans, with style and driving satisfaction that only a two-door can bring.\n\nHow Does the BMW M440i Compare With Other Luxury Coupes?\n\nThe M440i’s only real remaining competitor lives over at Mercedes-Benz, which recently launched a CLE that consolidates the automaker’s C- and E-Class coupes into one model. The Benz matches up with the BMW in terms of performance but looks less controversial.\n\nTwo-door personal luxury coupes are almost extinct. In the U.S., your choices are the BMW 4 Series you see here, the Mercedes-Benz CLE, the Lexus RC … and that’s it. BMW makes a less expensive 2 Series sports coupe and a more expensive 8 Series coupe, but if you’re looking for four-person luxury without a six-figure price tag, that’s pretty much it. BMW offers the 4 Series in three versions: the base 430i, the more powerful M440i and the high-performance M4. \n\nThe 430i comes standard with rear-wheel drive (xDrive all-wheel drive is optional) and a 255-horsepower, turbocharged four-cylinder engine. The dusky-green coupe seen here is an M440i xDrive, which is an AWD version of the 4 Series with a 386-hp, turbo six-cylinder engine. It’s the last stop on the roster before the high-powered M4 Coupe, which is itself available in three trims. \n\nThe 4 Series isn’t the most popular model in the BMW lineup, but does that make it any less enjoyable or desirable? There’s just something about a coupe that makes a fantastic statement and delivers an experience like no SUV can, and that holds true with the latest M440i — albeit with all the difficulties present in a lot of BMWs these days.\n\nRelated: 2025 BMW 4 Series: Mild-Hybrid Power, $51,695 Starting Price\n\nHow Much Does a 2025 BMW 4 Series Coupe Cost?\n\nAssembled in Dingolfing, Germany, and imported to the U.S., there are two basic flavors of the 4 Series Coupe: 430i and M440i. RWD is standard, with BMW’s xDrive AWD system available on both versions for an extra $2,000. All prices include a surprisingly reasonable $1,175 destination fee:\n\n430i Coupe: $52,325\nM440i Coupe: $66,025\nThe Styling Still Hurts …\n\nLuxury coupes are meant to be long, lovely, swoopy and curvaceous — boldly styled to draw attention, but tasteful enough to be the right kind of attention. BMW styling, meanwhile, has produced a difficult mix of daring lines and unpleasant shapes for years now, to the point that it’s turned off some buyers. The latest version of the 4 Series is a mixed bag in this department. It’s distinctive, and it’s clear that BMW has gotten the message about its beaver-toothed grille, as the blacked-out trim on the current model helps it blend in a bit better. Even so, the 4 Series is still not what one would call a pretty car. Next to a Mercedes-Benz CLE coupe, it looks awkward and odd. Of course, styling is subjective — maybe you think it’s the most gorgeous interpretation of the classic BMW look to come along in years. You’re entitled to your opinion (regardless of how wrong it is).\n\n… But the Driving Experience Doesn’t\n\nWhere BMW makes up for its recent styling deficiencies is in its driving experience, and that holds true with the M440i. Unlike the wild powertrains we’re starting to see in BMW’s M performance models (see my M5 review), the M440i uses a more conventional motivator: a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder engine that makes 386 hp and 398 pounds-feet of torque. That’s a “system” rating, however; the powertrain uses 48-volt mild-hybrid technology that integrates a starter-generator, which adds 11 hp. You’ll never notice any hybrid oddness in its operation, though; you’d never even know it was a mild-hybrid unless you read the specs. \n\nAcceleration is fantastic — either quiet and sedate or blisteringly quick, depending on what you want and which drive mode you’re in. BMW says the M440i xDrive can do 0-60 mph in 4.2 seconds, and I’ve no reason not to believe it. The standard eight-speed automatic transmission is the only one offered (there hasn’t been a stick shift in quite some time here), but it’s well matched to the engine and snaps off quick, drama-free shifts. Frankly, in a coupe that’s equal parts luxury and sportiness, the automatic feels more appropriate than a stick shift. \n\nDynamically, there’s truly nothing to complain about in the M440i. Steering feel through the super-thick sport-style steering wheel is excellent, as is road surface feedback. Ride quality is also top notch — even with its big, beautiful 19-inch wheels — thanks to the optional Adaptive M Suspension on my test vehicle. Road imperfections are easily absorbed; nothing will disturb you or your passengers. The brakes are strong and exhibit no fade during aggressive driving, and they aren’t grabby or squeaky at lower speeds like carbon-ceramic brakes would be. It’s a solid-feeling, entertaining sports coupe that delivers driving satisfaction you simply can’t get from an SUV. It might not look great, but it feels great to operate. \n\nA Mixed-Bag Interior\n\nInside the M440i, you’re faced with a bit of a conundrum. Materials quality in the cabin is quite decent, matching up well with the car’s price tag. Our test car had BMW’s available Mocha leather seats and trim, and it looked and felt lovely, especially combined with the car’s Cape York Green Metallic exterior paint (this is a dynamite spec). Carbon-fiber trim is everywhere if you opt for the optional trim package, but you can skip that if it’s not to your taste; wood or metal trim can be had instead. Ambient lighting is available in many different colors, but that’s common these days.\n\nUnfortunately, also common is the idea that a massive rectangular dashboard screen is somehow stylish. That’s what you face in the M440i: a huge curved display that incorporates both a gauge cluster and a touchscreen running the latest BMW multimedia system. On one hand, it’s big and bright, configurable to display tons of information in a few different styles. On the other hand, for new users (or older customers who struggle to operate a smartphone), it’s overwhelming and confusing, laden with icons, menus, systems and apps. The climate controls are also incorporated into the touchscreen, though they feel a bit simpler to operate than the last iteration I tried. One competitive advantage over the CLE: the 4 Series’ steering wheel does not have touch-sensitive controls (they’re traditional buttons), so there’s no accidentally triggering a function while just trying to drive the car normally. \n\nComfort in the front seats is excellent, as is outward visibility to the front and sides. The narrow rear window and thick roof pillars make the rear-quarter view a little challenging, but not a lot — and there are more than enough safety systems in the M440i to help you detect anything in your blind spot. Backseat comfort is challenging, but that’s the nature of a coupe — if you cared about people sitting in the backseat, you’d get a sedan or SUV instead. The coupe is meant to be seen in and to enjoy the experience — and to make a statement that you have enough money to make an expensive, impractical vehicle your main conveyance. \n\nMore From Cars.com: \n\n2025 BMW 4 Series Gran Coupe and i4 Updated Inside and Out\nBMW Replays a Greatest Hit: M2 CS Returns for 2026 With 523 Horsepower\n2025 BMW M5 Review: Tech.

It’s a beautifully balanced, technologically advanced machine, with styling that, while polarizing, is certainly distinctive. It will get you noticed. My very-well-optioned M440i xDrive included some useful option packages — including the Premium Package (which adds Harman Kardon premium audio, a head-up display and a power trunk lid) — and it had an as-tested price of $76,445. That matches up well with a well-equipped Mercedes-Benz CLE450. \n\nAs coupes continue to disappear from showrooms, your choices are increasingly limited. But the ones that are still available, like the M440i, are solidly enjoyable. Get one while you still can.\n\nRelated Video: \n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The BMW 4 Series continues into 2023 with slight revisions to its packaging, a new paint color and new pricing after its variants received a refresh for 2021 and 2022, but the biggest change is inside: Starting in March, all 4 Series will come with a curved display and the latest multimedia system for the dashboard and infotainment.\n\nRelated: 2021 BMW M440i Convertible Review: Escape Artist\n\nBoth the regular 4 Series and the performance-minded M4 soon will house BMW’s curved display, which features a 12.3-inch information display behind the steering wheel and a 14.9-inch control display all running on BMW’s iDrive 8 system. Gone are many buttons and controllers in favor of an emphasis on voice and touch controls — emphasized all the more because, like many other Bimmers for 2023, also gone from the lineup is gesture control.\n\nFor models on sale before March, however, the interior largely carries over. The Driving Assistance Professional Package is out and the Premium Package’s head-up display is now only available on the M440i, while the Parking Assist Package has returned and adaptive LED headlights are no longer available as a stand-alone option. A synthetic leather dashboard is now optional on all 4 Series models. On the M4, the driver recorder function is now a stand-alone option.\n\nElsewhere, the Shadowline Package now gets M Sport brakes with red or blue calipers, and a new Skyscraper Grey metallic paint replaces Bluestone metallic. The base 430i’s powerplant is a 255-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine; the M440i gets you a 382-hp, turbo 3.0-liter inline-six; and the range-topping M4 offers a 473-hp, twin-turbo 3.0-liter inline-six capable of up to 503 hp when equipped with the Competition Package. An eight-speed automatic is standard across most of the lineup; the M4 comes with a six-speed manual. Rear-wheel drive is standard; all-wheel drive is optional except on the M4 Competition convertible, where it comes standard.\n\nPricing and Release Date\n\nThe 2023 BMW 4 Series lineup is available now, and full pricing (including the $995 destination fee) is below. All-wheel drive adds $2,000 except on the M4 Competition, where it’s an extra $4,100 on the coupe and standard on the convertible.\n\nCoupe\n\n430i: $48,395\nM440i: $59,245\nM4: $75,695\nM4 Competition: $79,595\n\nConvertible\n\n430i: $56,495\nM440i: $67,245\nM4 Competition: $90,695\n\nGran Coupe\n\n430i: $46,895\nM440i: $58,445\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nQuicker 2022 BMW M3, M4 Competitions With AWD Priced Under $80,000\n2021 BMW M3 and M4: M Stands for Manual\n2021 BMW 4 Series Convertible Drops Its Cover, and Its (Soft) Top\n2021 BMW 4 Series: More Power, More Tech, More Grille, Just … More on the 4\nMore BMW News\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 BMW 4 Series?\nThe BMW 4 Series lineup shares basic underpinnings with BMW’s 3 Series compact car, but with sleeker, personal-luxury-focused body styles. The 4 Series comes as a two-door coupe or convertible, as well as a four-door Gran Coupe sedan with a low, coupelike roofline. The 430 is powered by a 255-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder, while the M440 gets a 382-hp, turbo 3.0-liter inline-six. The mighty M4 high-performance variant has an upgraded version of the 3.0-liter six-cylinder that produces 473 or 503 hp, depending on the model. BMW still offers a six-speed manual transmission, but only on the M4; all other 4 Series cars have a silky eight-speed automatic. Most 4 Series models offer a choice of rear- or all-wheel drive. The 4 Series’ rivals include the Audi A5, Lexus RC and Mercedes-Benz C-Class.\nWhat’s New on the 2024 BMW 4 Series?\nAll 4 Series models receive BMW’s Curved Display, which includes a 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster and a 14.9-inch infotainment touchscreen integrated into a single curved panel. The infotainment software is upgraded to the latest iDrive 8 version, which includes new graphics and additional functions.\nWhat Features in the 2024 BMW 4 Series Are Most Important?\nStandard features include:\n\n12.3-inch digital instrument panel\n14.9-inch infotainment touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nSatellite radio\nNavigation \nWi-Fi hot spot\nDual-zone climate control\nTwo USB ports\n10-speaker stereo\nRear cross-traffic alert\nBlind spot warning\nLane departure warning\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nWireless device charging\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nLeather seating\nHead-up instrument display\nAdaptive M Sport suspension\nM Sport differential\nM Sport brakes\n360-degree parking camera\nLane departure steering assist\n\nShould I Buy the 2024 BMW 4 Series Gran Coupe?\nLuxury car shoppers on the fence about what they want most in their next vehicle will appreciate the many body styles offered by the BMW 4 Series. Few vehicles can be had as a sleek coupe, a sun-loving convertible and a relatively practical sedan. No 4 Series will spoil you with backseat space or cargo volume, particularly not with the coupe and convertible, but when it comes to performance and interior quality, this car impresses with its sharp driving manners and elegant cabin layout.",
