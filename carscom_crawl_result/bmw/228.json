      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nBMW is continuing its confusing numbers game and will welcome the 2 Series to its lineup in early 2014. The rear-wheel drive coupe seats four and replaces the 1 Series coupe. The 2 Series will be available in 228i and M235i versions.\n\nPowering the 228i is a 240-horsepower, twin-turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder; BMW says it’s good for a zero-to-60 time of 5.4 seconds with the eight-speed automatic; a six-speed manual is also available. Preliminary fuel economy estimates for the eight-speed are 23/35/27 mpg city/highway/combined and 22/34/26 mpg for the six-speed manual.\n\nThe M is amped up in every way, with a twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter inline six-cylinder good for 322 hp and 332 pounds-feet of torque as well as an M specific adaptive suspension, M Sport braking system, variable sport steering and specially tuned exhaust. BMW pegs its zero-to-60 time at 4.8 seconds with the eight-speed automatic and estimates a 22/32/25 mpg rating for the automatic and 19/28 /22 for the six-speed manual. The eight-speed is standard, and the six-speed manual is a no-cost option on the M235i. An automatic stop-start system is standard on both models.\n\nThe new coupe is 2.8 inches longer than the 1 Series, which BMW says translates into 0.7 inches of additional front headroom and 0.8 inches of extra rear legroom. The trunk also grows slightly, with an added 0.7 cubic feet of space for a total of 13.8 cubic feet.\n\nStandard interior features include dual-zone automatic climate control; Driving Experience Control, which allows the driver to adjust the suspension setup; and BMW’s iDrive multimedia system (with a 6.5-inch screen). Navigation with an upgraded 8.8-inch screen is optional. Other options include Bluetooth audio streaming, an upgraded Harman Kardon audio system, adaptive headlights, the ConnectedDrive in-car connectivity system, parking assist, a rearview camera and a cruise control system with braking function.",
