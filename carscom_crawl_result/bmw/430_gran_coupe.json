      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 BMW 4 Series?\n\nThe BMW 4 Series debuted for 2014 as a replacement for the previous-generation 3 Series coupe and convertible. Power comes from turbocharged four- or six-cylinder engines, and rear- and all-wheel-drive versions are available. Competitors include the Audi A5 and Mercedes-Benz C-Class.\n\nWith the same length, width, wheelbase and track as the two-door coupe, but a bit more headroom, the 4 Series Gran Coupe sports a sedan profile. Like the 4 Series coupe and convertible, it’s offered in four-cylinder 430i and six-cylinder 440i forms. The high-performance M4 is available as a coupe or convertible and competes with the Lexus RC F.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 BMW 4 Series?\n\nNew standard active safety features include forward collision warning with pedestrian detection, lane departure warning and city collision mitigation. Rain-sensing windshield wipers are also standard. Trim updates include darkened taillights, a gloss-black grille frame and a new diffuser.\n\nWhat Features in the 2020 BMW 4 Series Are Most Important?\n\nBMW’s rear-wheel-drive handling characteristics have been benchmarked by practically every automaker fielding a luxury sports car. Available active safety features include blind spot warning and adaptive cruise control. Other available tech features include a head-up display, a digital instrument panel, wireless device charging and a Wi-Fi hot spot (data subscription required after initial trial).\n\nShould I Buy the 2020 BMW 4 Series?\n\nHandling and braking are 4 Series highlights. The Gran Coupe version offers extra cargo versatility without sacrificing style, while the retractable-hardtop convertible delivers year-round practicality. However, the automatic transmission’s responses during performance driving are lacking, and the car’s stability system is too conservative.",

      "expert_review": "The BMW 4 Series continues into 2023 with slight revisions to its packaging, a new paint color and new pricing after its variants received a refresh for 2021 and 2022, but the biggest change is inside: Starting in March, all 4 Series will come with a curved display and the latest multimedia system for the dashboard and infotainment.\nRelated: 2021 BMW M440i Convertible Review: Escape Artist\nBoth the regular 4 Series and the performance-minded M4 soon will house BMW’s curved display, which features a 12.3-inch information display behind the steering wheel and a 14.9-inch control display all running on BMW’s iDrive 8 system. Gone are many buttons and controllers in favor of an emphasis on voice and touch controls — emphasized all the more because, like many other Bimmers for 2023, also gone from the lineup is gesture control.\nFor models on sale before March, however, the interior largely carries over. The Driving Assistance Professional Package is out and the Premium Package’s head-up display is now only available on the M440i, while the Parking Assist Package has returned and adaptive LED headlights are no longer available as a stand-alone option. A synthetic leather dashboard is now optional on all 4 Series models. On the M4, the driver recorder function is now a stand-alone option.\nElsewhere, the Shadowline Package now gets M Sport brakes with red or blue calipers, and a new Skyscraper Grey metallic paint replaces Bluestone metallic. The base 430i’s powerplant is a 255-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine; the M440i gets you a 382-hp, turbo 3.0-liter inline-six; and the range-topping M4 offers a 473-hp, twin-turbo 3.0-liter inline-six capable of up to 503 hp when equipped with the Competition Package. An eight-speed automatic is standard across most of the lineup; the M4 comes with a six-speed manual. Rear-wheel drive is standard; all-wheel drive is optional except on the M4 Competition convertible, where it comes standard.\nPricing and Release Date\nThe 2023 BMW 4 Series lineup is available now, and full pricing (including the $995 destination fee) is below. All-wheel drive adds $2,000 except on the M4 Competition, where it’s an extra $4,100 on the coupe and standard on the convertible.\nCoupe\n\n430i: $48,395\nM440i: $59,245\nM4: $75,695\nM4 Competition: $79,595\n\nConvertible\n\n430i: $56,495\nM440i: $67,245\nM4 Competition: $90,695\n\nGran Coupe\n\n430i: $46,895\nM440i: $58,445\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nQuicker 2022 BMW M3, M4 Competitions With AWD Priced Under $80,000\n2021 BMW M3 and M4: M Stands for Manual\n2021 BMW 4 Series Convertible Drops Its Cover, and Its (Soft) Top\n2021 BMW 4 Series: More Power, More Tech, More Grille, Just … More on the 4\nMore BMW News\n\nRelated Video:\n\n  \n    \n\n  \n    Cars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 BMW 4 Series?\nThe BMW 4 Series debuted for 2014 as a replacement for the previous-generation 3 Series coupe and convertible. Power comes from turbocharged four- or six-cylinder engines, and rear- and all-wheel-drive versions are available. Competitors include the Audi A5 and Mercedes-Benz C-Class.\nWith the same length, width, wheelbase and track as the two-door coupe, but a bit more headroom, the 4 Series Gran Coupe sports a sedan profile. Like the 4 Series coupe and convertible, it’s offered in four-cylinder 430i and six-cylinder 440i form. The high-performance M4 is available as a coupe or convertible and competes with the Cadillac ATS-V and Lexus RC F.\nWhat’s New on the 2019 BMW 4 Series?\nNavigation with real-time traffic information and a one-year trial of Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity is now standard. The M4 also adds standard parking sensors.\nWhat Features in the 2019 BMW 4 Series Are Most Important?\nBMW’s rear-wheel-drive platform’s handling characteristics have been benchmarked by practically every automaker fielding a luxury sports sedan. Available active safety features include blind spot warning, adaptive cruise control and automatic emergency braking. Other available tech features include a head-up display, a digital instrument panel, wireless device charging and a Wi-Fi hot spot (data subscription required after initial trial).\nShould I Buy the 2019 BMW 4 Series?\nHandling and braking are 4 Series highlights. The Gran Coupe version offers extra cargo versatility without sacrificing style, while the retractable-hardtop convertible delivers year-round practicality. However, the automatic transmission’s responses during performance driving are lacking, and the car’s stability system is too conservative.",

      "expert_review": "The BMW 4 Series Gran Coupe and its electric stablemate, the i4, were just overhauled for the 2022 model year, but BMW is tweaking the pair for 2025 with updated infotainment tech, new head- and taillights, and more.\nRelated: 2024 BMW i4 Adds xDrive40 Variant, Priced From $53,195\nWhat’s New?\nThe biggest change is to the gas-powered 4 Series Gran Coupe. As with other BMWs, the 2025 4 Series Gran Coupe now includes a standard 48-volt mild-hybrid system with both available engines. The 430i Gran Coupe’s turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder is thoroughly reworked for increased efficiency, but with the additional hybrid components, its output remains unchanged at 255 horsepower and 295 pounds-feet of torque.\nThe turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six in the M440i Gran Coupe gets some efficiency rework, and the mild-hybrid system bumps its total output up to 386 hp and 398 pounds-feet, increases of 4 hp and 29 pounds-feet. Both engines are paired exclusively with an eight-speed automatic transmission, with rear-wheel drive standard and all-wheel drive available. EPA fuel economy estimates for the hybrid engines are not yet available. The i4’s electric powertrain is unchanged for 2025.\nOther Updates\n\n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    Revised head- and taillights are the extent of the major exterior updates on the cars, and the upper portion of the i4’s grille is now closed. Inside, the standard Curved Display, in which the digital instrument panel flows seamlessly into the central touchscreen behind a single piece of curved glass, is updated to the latest generation of BMW’s iDrive with QuickSelect. Running on BMW Operating System 8.5, the infotainment system features a revised menu structure aimed at keeping more commonly used functions readily accessible through the touchscreen.\nThis software version also expands the use of voice commands and works with the My BMW mobile app to allow remote access to vehicle information — and, in some cases, functions like door locking and unlocking — from anywhere with cellular service or Wi-Fi connectivity. The newly standard Personal eSim allows for a 5G data connection for communications and connectivity services even in the absence of a paired smartphone.\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nBMW i4, Mini Cooper SE Hardtop Top 2024 J.D.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 BMW 4 Series?\nThe BMW 4 Series lineup shares basic underpinnings with BMW’s 3 Series compact car, but with sleeker, personal-luxury-focused body styles. The 4 Series comes as a two-door coupe or convertible, as well as a four-door Gran Coupe sedan with a low, coupelike roofline. The 430 is powered by a 255-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder, while the M440 gets a 382-hp, turbo 3.0-liter inline-six. The mighty M4 high-performance variant has an upgraded version of the 3.0-liter six-cylinder that produces 473 or 503 hp, depending on the model. BMW still offers a six-speed manual transmission, but only on the M4; all other 4 Series cars have a silky eight-speed automatic. Most 4 Series models offer a choice of rear- or all-wheel drive. The 4 Series’ rivals include the Audi A5, Lexus RC and Mercedes-Benz C-Class.\nWhat’s New on the 2024 BMW 4 Series?\nAll 4 Series models receive BMW’s Curved Display, which includes a 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster and a 14.9-inch infotainment touchscreen integrated into a single curved panel. The infotainment software is upgraded to the latest iDrive 8 version, which includes new graphics and additional functions.\nWhat Features in the 2024 BMW 4 Series Are Most Important?\nStandard features include:\n\n12.3-inch digital instrument panel\n14.9-inch infotainment touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nSatellite radio\nNavigation \nWi-Fi hot spot\nDual-zone climate control\nTwo USB ports\n10-speaker stereo\nRear cross-traffic alert\nBlind spot warning\nLane departure warning\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nWireless device charging\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nLeather seating\nHead-up instrument display\nAdaptive M Sport suspension\nM Sport differential\nM Sport brakes\n360-degree parking camera\nLane departure steering assist\n\nShould I Buy the 2024 BMW 4 Series Gran Coupe?\nLuxury car shoppers on the fence about what they want most in their next vehicle will appreciate the many body styles offered by the BMW 4 Series. Few vehicles can be had as a sleek coupe, a sun-loving convertible and a relatively practical sedan. No 4 Series will spoil you with backseat space or cargo volume, particularly not with the coupe and convertible, but when it comes to performance and interior quality, this car impresses with its sharp driving manners and elegant cabin layout.",
