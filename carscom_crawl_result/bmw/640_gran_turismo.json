      "expert_review": "BMW has unveiled an all-new 6 Series in four-door Gran Turismo form. The GT will come in one variation: the 640i xDrive, with all-wheel drive and a turbocharged six-cylinder engine.\n\n\nBMW told us it will continue to sell other 6 Series variants — to wit, the 6 Series convertible and four-door Gran Coupe — for the 2018 model year, even though the Gran Turismo is based on an all-new generation of the car. (BMW dropped the traditional 6 Series coupe for the U.S.) \n\n \n\nExterior\nWith a wheelbase that’s 4 inches longer than the 6 Series Gran Coupe, the new 6 Series Gran Turismo shares subtle cues with the 5 Series and 7 Series — namely, headlights that join BMW’s signature double-kidney grille rather than sit out to the side as they do on the current 6 Series. The GT’s roofline peaks around the B-pillar to flow all the way down to the rear of the car.\n\nAdaptive LED headlights are standard. The trunk opens as a hatchback, with standard power actuation and hands-free foot activation. A subtle deck-lid spoiler deploys below the rear window when the car exceeds 75 mph; it retracts again when you drop below 50 mph. (Fortunately, Dennis Hopper won’t force you to stay above that.) Alloy wheels range from 19 to 21 inches.\n\nInterior\nIf you’ve been inside the 5 Series or 7 Series, the 6 Series GT should look familiar. The dashboard has a tablet-like display that measures 10.25 inches, with a thin screen below for climate-control readouts. A vinyl-wrapped dashboard with stitching is standard. Stitched trim adorns many other areas, from the upper doors and steering-wheel hub to portions of the center console. The overhead reading lights have a veined finish that recalls the GT’s taillights.\n\nBMW claims there’s 38.5 inches’ rear headroom — 1.5 inches more than in the 6 Series Gran Coupe. Leather upholstery and a panoramic moonroof are standard. Quilted Nappa leather is optional, as are massaging front seats with ventilation. The backseat fits three, and rear passengers can have optional sunshades and recliners, both power-operated. BMW says the seats fold in a 40/20/40 split via releases in the cargo area, with a rigid cargo cover that stows under the cargo floor.\n\nApple CarPlay is optional; Android Auto is unavailable.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe turbo 3.0-liter six-cylinder makes 335 horsepower and 332 pounds-feet of torque, driving all wheels through an eight-speed automatic transmission. BMW says the new 640i xDrive Gran Turismo hits 60 mph in 5.1 seconds — about as quick as its Gran Coupe sibling. The suspension employs standard front coil springs, rear air springs and fixed stabilizer bars. A bevy of performance options include variable-ratio steering, rear-wheel active steering and front air springs, plus adaptive shock absorbers and active stabilizer bars all around.\n\nSafety\nBlind spot and lane departure warning systems are standard, as is a forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking. Optional adaptive cruise control (effective up to 130 mph) can track speeds up to two cars ahead, while BMW says the car can steer itself in the right conditions for up to 50 seconds hands-free — though it’s still “a hands-on system,” the automaker says. A parking assist system can manage steering and gas and brakes during low-speed parking maneuvers.",

A Harman Kardon surround-sound system is available.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 BMW 6 Series?\n\nThe 6 Series’ driving experience impresses with good power from its base six-cylinder engine and controlled body motions. The cabin can be richly finished and BMW’s iDrive system, which uses a console control knob to operate the dashboard screen, is intuitive. The 6 Series is now only offered in four-door form, so if you want a coupe or convertible you may need to look at another luxury brand.",
