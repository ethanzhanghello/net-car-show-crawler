      "expert_review": "BMW used to have the lock on enthusiast vehicles — cars for people who love to drive and see every trip to the grocery store as a chance to apex some corners, every highway on-ramp as a little slice of fun. But somewhere along the way, it decided to chase volume at the expense of those enthusiasts. And while making its cars more broadly appealing has helped sales, it’s also created a bunch of lackluster automobiles that sell on the old image of the brand, not their current performance.\n\nEnter the new 2017 BMW 440i, a twin-turbo, six-cylinder, two-door version of the 3 Series sedan. It’s posh, smooth, quiet, quick and comfortable. What it’s not is entertaining.\n\nThe 440i got a slight update this year, including a new engine and nomenclature: What had been the 435i is now the 440i, and it comes with a 320-horsepower, twin-turbocharged inline-six-cylinder engine. It’s mated to a standard eight-speed automatic transmission; a six-speed manual is a no-cost option. Rear- or all-wheel drive xDrive can be had (my test car was rear-drive). Throw in a few minor styling tweaks to the lights and bumpers, and that’s pretty much the extent of the updates for 2017 (compare the two model years side by side here). As before, the 4 Series can be had in coupe, convertible or four-door Gran Coupe body styles.\n\nClassic BMW Styling Outside\n\nThe exterior changes aren’t noticeable. Put it next to a 2016 BMW 4 Series and you’ll be hard-pressed to spot which is newer unless you look at the badge. But while it’s not as flashy as competitors like the Mercedes-Benz C-Class or Lexus RC, it’s still a handsome design — simple and understated, as BMWs have traditionally been. The brand has always been about the driving; the goal of its styling has been to not distract from the experience with anything too outrageous. In this sense, the 440i delivers — it looks like a classic BMW. Whether that will continue to be popular as competitors update their looks remains to be seen.\n\nBoring BMW Styling Inside\n\nUnfortunately, the classic exterior styling has been carried over to the interior materials, which include a lot of hard plastic, grained soft-touch padding and all-too-familiar shapes. My interior was devoid of any wood; in its place was faux metal trim, which did not represent the 440i’s price tag very well. Other, more luxurious options are available, as are some better, more interesting color choices. The gauges aren’t great, either, with light-gray numerals on dark-gray dials that make them hard to see in bright sunlight.\n\nWhile other automakers have started to take some gambles or put obvious money into their interiors, BMW hasn’t done much with the 4 Series’ insides. (Go sit in any trim level of the new Mercedes-Benz C-Class — the benchmark for this segment — and you’ll see what I mean.) The top trim of your average Mazda feels more premium than this BMW interior, and for much less money. It wasn’t just me saying this, either; several passengers said the car didn’t feel any more luxurious inside than your average Hyundai or Honda.\n\nBut it’s not all bad in the 440i. It’s still a comfortable place to be, with supportive seats, a low beltline and excellent all-around visibility. The side glass is tall and long, providing excellent views forward and to the sides. The backseat is tight, but you expect that in a coupe; you trade in utility and practicality for style when you leave the showroom with a two-door.\n\nHead room up front is ample, even with the moonroof. The adjustable seat goes low enough that you won’t brush your head on the headliner, something the Cadillac ATS can’t claim.\n\nControls are easily located and simple to operate even at speed. There are no tricky touchpads like Lexus, no cheap-looking touchscreens like Cadillac. Most functions are controlled through the iDrive multifunction knob and dedicated buttons on the center console. While this eats up some real estate that could have been used for much-needed storage space, it’s a simple way to operate the multimedia system while avoiding smudgy fingerprints on the glass. And kudos to BMW for including an engine stop-start defeat switch that doesn’t need to be pressed every time you start the car — push it once, and it stays off.\n\nThe Best Part: The Engine Still Sings\n\nThe absolute best thing about the 440i is its powertrain. The 3.0-liter twin-turbo six is fantastic, with gobs of power on demand and a delivery that can be either smooth and strong or furious and brutal, depending on where you’ve set the Drive Mode selector. You’ll almost certainly want to keep the BMW 4 Series in Sport mode, as throttle response in Normal is less than lively. The transmission is much more eager to downshift in Sport mode, as well, and keeps the powertrain in lower gears for snappier torque responses. It’s a shame the car is let down by its numb steering and a suspension that’s geared more toward comfort than sport; the powertrain engineers really brought their A-game to the party.\n\nIt’s not the most fuel-efficient beast, rated 21/32/25 mpg city/highway/combined with the automatic, 19/29/23 mpg with the manual (those two extra gears in the automatic make a real difference). If you want better fuel economy, opt for the four-cylinder 430i instead, which gets 23/34/27 mpg with the automatic and 21/33/25 mpg with the stick shift.\n\nMy week with the 440i netted 24 mpg combined — an acceptable result given it entailed mostly city driving. That’s about on par with competing compact luxury coupes like the Cadillac ATS, Audi A5 and Lexus RC.\n\nAs for crash tests, the BMW 4 Series has not yet been tested by either the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. As with most German performance-oriented luxury cars, there’s a minimal level of standard electronic safety equipment; you can up that content depending on how much money you want to spend. Items like forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, blind spot warning, lane departure warning and prevention, and other safety systems are all extra-cost options.\n\nReady, Set, Lease!\n\nThe 2017 BMW 440i starts at $49,495 including destination fee, which brings it in a couple of thousand dollars more than a Cadillac ATS V-6 coupe and more than $5,000 more than a Mercedes-Benz C300 coupe. At this price, you get the standard straight-six cylinder engine, an eight-speed automatic transmission, LED headlights, a moonroof, a Harman Kardon premium 16-speaker audio system and faux leather seating surfaces (real leather costs $1,450 extra). It’s a decent level of content for the money, but you’ll likely pay considerably more to add features that bring it up to premium-car standards, like a sport suspension, modern safety equipment and real leather upholstery. Even Apple CarPlay costs extra, and Android Auto is not available.\n\nMy test car came with $2,000 worth of optional Estoril Blue paint and a black leather interior, plus the $2,000 Premium Package (including navigation and heated seats) and $2,550 M Sport Package (which gets you “shadowline” black exterior trim, sport seats, 18-inch wheels, carbon-fiber trim, an M Sport suspension and steering wheel, and a dark headliner) for a grand total of $56,245.\n\nIt’s not that competitors don’t also charge a lot for similar content. The Mercedes-Benz C-Class coupe is an interesting comparison. There isn’t a Benz trim level that lines up directly with the BMW 440i — the C300 is less expensive and less powerful, lining up better with the 430i, while the C43 AMG is more powerful and more expensive, but comes in less than an M4 coupe (the highest-performance 4 Series). The Cadillac ATS 3.6 coupe has more content for less money, plus a chassis that’s arguably a better choice for driving enthusiasts than the BMW, but its interior feels even more low-rent than the 440i’s. The Lexus RC coupe amps up the style factor, as does the Infiniti Q60 coupe. Both of those cars aim squarely at the 440i. Compare the latter three here.\n\nChoosing one of these cars largely comes down to personal preferences. If you’re just looking for a premium luxury coupe, any of them fit the bill. If you’re looking for the Ultimate Driving Machine, however, know this BMW 4 Series no longer holds a legitimate claim to that title.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 BMW 4 Series?\n\nThe BMW 4 Series debuted for 2014 as a replacement for the previous-generation 3 Series coupe and convertible. Power comes from turbocharged four- or six-cylinder engines, and rear- and all-wheel-drive versions are available. Competitors include the Audi A5 and Mercedes-Benz C-Class.\n\nWith the same length, width, wheelbase and track as the two-door coupe, but a bit more headroom, the 4 Series Gran Coupe sports a sedan profile. Like the 4 Series coupe and convertible, it’s offered in four-cylinder 430i and six-cylinder 440i forms. The high-performance M4 is available as a coupe or convertible and competes with the Lexus RC F.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 BMW 4 Series?\n\nNew standard active safety features include forward collision warning with pedestrian detection, lane departure warning and city collision mitigation. Rain-sensing windshield wipers are also standard. Trim updates include darkened taillights, a gloss-black grille frame and a new diffuser.\n\nWhat Features in the 2020 BMW 4 Series Are Most Important?\n\nBMW’s rear-wheel-drive handling characteristics have been benchmarked by practically every automaker fielding a luxury sports car. Available active safety features include blind spot warning and adaptive cruise control. Other available tech features include a head-up display, a digital instrument panel, wireless device charging and a Wi-Fi hot spot (data subscription required after initial trial).\n\nShould I Buy the 2020 BMW 4 Series?\n\nHandling and braking are 4 Series highlights. The Gran Coupe version offers extra cargo versatility without sacrificing style, while the retractable-hardtop convertible delivers year-round practicality. However, the automatic transmission’s responses during performance driving are lacking, and the car’s stability system is too conservative.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 BMW 4 Series?\nThe BMW 4 Series debuted for 2014 as a replacement for the previous-generation 3 Series coupe and convertible. Power comes from turbocharged four- or six-cylinder engines, and rear- and all-wheel-drive versions are available. Competitors include the Audi A5 and Mercedes-Benz C-Class.\nWith the same length, width, wheelbase and track as the two-door coupe, but a bit more headroom, the 4 Series Gran Coupe sports a sedan profile. Like the 4 Series coupe and convertible, it’s offered in four-cylinder 430i and six-cylinder 440i form. The high-performance M4 is available as a coupe or convertible and competes with the Cadillac ATS-V and Lexus RC F.\nWhat’s New on the 2019 BMW 4 Series?\nNavigation with real-time traffic information and a one-year trial of Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity is now standard. The M4 also adds standard parking sensors.\nWhat Features in the 2019 BMW 4 Series Are Most Important?\nBMW’s rear-wheel-drive platform’s handling characteristics have been benchmarked by practically every automaker fielding a luxury sports sedan. Available active safety features include blind spot warning, adaptive cruise control and automatic emergency braking. Other available tech features include a head-up display, a digital instrument panel, wireless device charging and a Wi-Fi hot spot (data subscription required after initial trial).\nShould I Buy the 2019 BMW 4 Series?\nHandling and braking are 4 Series highlights. The Gran Coupe version offers extra cargo versatility without sacrificing style, while the retractable-hardtop convertible delivers year-round practicality. However, the automatic transmission’s responses during performance driving are lacking, and the car’s stability system is too conservative.",
