      "expert_review": "Verdict: The 2022 BMW M240i brings markedly improved performance over the previous generation, but it has the same numb steering that’s plaguing BMW’s entire lineup these days.\n\nVersus the competition: The 2022 M240i’s performance surpasses or at least matches cheaper hot hatches and sedans, but it lacks their engagement and sense of fun.\n\nBMW redesigned its 2 Series coupe for the 2022 model year, making it longer, wider and lower. The result is a well-proportioned coupe that looks fantastic, particularly in our test vehicle’s Thunderknight Metallic purple paint, which was nicely complemented by the gold accents of BMW’s optional adaptive LED headlights. Also in its favor: BMW didn’t give the 2 Series the larger 4 Series’ garish grille design.\n\nThe more powerful M240i gets standard all-wheel drive and the brand’s familiar turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder engine, which makes an impressive 382 horsepower and 369 pounds-feet of torque — up 47 hp and 1 pound-foot, respectively, from the last generation.\n\nRelated: 2022 BMW 2 Series Coupe Gains Power, Loses Manual\n\nAnything that gets a “nice car” comment from the guys doing the hand drying at the car wash starts off on the right foot with me. But does the M240i’s performance live up to its looks?\n\nTiger on Paper, Tranquilized on Pavement\n\nDetermining whether the M240i’s performance lives up to its looks is, well, complicated — fitting for a BMW. The automaker says the M240i can go from 0-60 mph in 4.1 seconds. Other BMWs with similar acceleration include the AWD M340i xDrive (4.2 seconds), the M440i xDrive (4.3), the rear-wheel-drive M3 and M4 with the six-speed manual transmission (4.1), and the upcoming 2023 M2 with a six-speed manual transmission (4.1). A 2020 M340i xDrive we tested rocketed from 0-60 mph in 3.89 seconds, so it’s possible the M240i is even quicker than estimated.\n\nAfter driving it, I wouldn’t be surprised if it is. Straight-line acceleration impresses, pushing you back in your seat as the eight-speed automatic transmission (the only one offered) snaps off shifts quickly and crisply. It’d be nice to have a manual option, but the eight-speed is so good, I didn’t miss one — plus, BMW’s manuals haven’t been the crispest of late.\n\nUnfortunately, the M240i tells a different story when the road gets twisty. Performance still seems to be there — the M240i consistently turned in the fastest autocross times at a gathering of automotive journalists — but the car also consistently elicited complaints about a lack of steering feel. We’ve complained a lot about the steering in other BMWs, and the problem continues here: It’s difficult to feel like you’ve pointed the M240i in the right direction, and the steering wheel doesn’t communicate enough about what’s happening to inspire confidence.\n\nHandling feel isn’t helped by the M240i’s heft: BMW lists its curb weight at 3,871 pounds, and the larger M440i xDrive coupe tips the scales at 3,977 pounds. Between the weight and its long hood, the M240i feels like a bigger vehicle than it is. Fortunately, its brakes can handle that heft, with solid pedal feel and linearity.\n\nExhaust sounds, which can add to a car’s engagement and fun factor, is lacking in the M240i. There’s something disappointing about the fact that a variety of Hyundais, specifically the N versions, sound better than a BMW with an M in its model name. There’s a decent rumble to the M240i’s exhaust, it just lacks the sensations that make drivers grin.\n\nThe saving grace for the M240i is that in the 2 Series lineup, it doesn’t have to be the highest-performance model – that’ll be the upcoming M2. Instead, the more I drove it, the more I thought of the M240i as a grand tourer. Whereas a sports car feels its best during aggressive driving, usually sacrificing comfort for performance, a grand tourer is all about smooth, comfortable long-distance driving at higher speeds.\n\nThe heft and tuning of the M240i’s standard adaptive suspension, along with a longer wheelbase than the prior generation’s, significantly improves ride quality. It’s still a small car, though, and with our test car’s 19-inch wheels, we definitely still felt the bumps. But the bumps don’t unsettle the car — there’s an impact, then the M240i just settles again with no reverberation. The M240i just begs to eat up highway miles with its fairly comfortable ride and impressive straight-line speed.\n\nThe M240i’s fuel economy will help owners do that, at least to a certain extent. The EPA rates the car’s gas mileage at 23/32/26 mpg city/highway/combined, and that highway number in particular should come in handy. Because of its 13.7-gallon fuel tank, however, the M240i can only go a little over 350 miles on a single tank, according to the EPA.\n\nA Grand Tourer on the Inside, Too\n\nAnother reason I always felt like I was driving a grand tourer in the M240i is that the car is extremely comfortable and well-laid-out inside — as long as you’re sitting up front. The front seats are comfortable and sight lines from the driver’s seat are mostly good. The control layout is intuitive, with a bevy of physical controls for audio and climate settings, as well as BMW’s easy-to-use drive mode buttons on the center console by the gear selector.\n\nThe M240i’s iDrive touchscreen display includes standard wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto; they’re welcome, as is wireless device charging. As in most BMW’s these days, the touchscreen pushes the boundary of being overly involved and complicated, but it doesn’t cross it. I also noticed lag when using wireless Apple CarPlay, particularly when trying to quickly and repeatedly change songs, but overall connectivity was acceptable. All this combines to make the M240i a pleasant driving and riding experience over longer journeys.\n\nLike a true grand tourer, the M240i’s backseat is best used for additional storage. Accessing the backseat is difficult thanks to a small door opening and interference from the front seat even in its most forward folded position, but that point is essentially moot because there’s no room back there for adults anyhow. Legroom and headroom are cramped, and I couldn’t come close to sitting up straight. It felt a little worse than the backseat in the 2 Series Gran Coupe, but in this case it’s forgivable because the M240i is a two-door coupe, not a four-door sedan.\n\nThe M240i’s trunk is fairly roomy, at least for a car this size, so you might not often utilize that backseat luggage space. BMW lists its capacity at 10 cubic feet; in practice, it was enough for a large grocery haul.\n\nOur test vehicle included an optional Premium Package, which adds a head-up display and BMW’s Live Cockpit digital instrument panel with navigation. I found both useful and was especially pleased that the head-up display displayed navigation instructions from Apple Maps when connected to Apple CarPlay — but as a Google Maps person, it was frustrating (though understandable) not to see those directions on the display.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nRedesigned 2023 BMW M2: The Smallest M Scores Big HP Boost\n2022 BMW i4 M50 Gran Coupe Review: Electric Rocket Ship\n2023 BMW i4 eDrive35 Joins i4 Lineup With Lower Price, Less Power and Range\n2023 BMW 3 Series Freshens Up for July Launch\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto: Where Are They Now?\nSafety\n\nThe 2 Series Gran Coupe is a 2022 Insurance Institute for Highway Safety Top Safety Pick, but the 2022 2 Series Coupe uses an entirely different platform, and it’s yet to be evaluated by IIHS. If or when the coupe is evaluated, its rating will appear here. The same applies to National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ratings.\n\nLots of Fun, But Is it Worth It?\n\nThe 2022 BMW M240i starts at $49,545 (all prices include destination); with options, our test vehicle came to $56,845. At that price, you could almost afford a base 2022 Audi RS 3, which is similarly sized and an absolute riot to drive, though its ride is harsher. There are also cars that cost tens of thousands of dollars less and are more engaging to drive, but these cars, like the Hyundai Elantra N and Honda Civic Type R, look less mature, have cheaper interiors and ride more firmly. Those more engaging mainstream cars are also much slower in a straight line.\n\nThe most similar car to the M240i is quite possibly the two-seat Toyota Supra (cue the jokes about the Supra’s BMW-sourced DNA), but the M240i’s borderline vestigial backseat provides extra utility for a daily driver. The M240i is enjoyable, comfortable and stylish, and it makes sense as a mini grand tourer — but that “M” in its name is a bit misleading. Sports-car shoppers should wait for the M2 or look elsewhere.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The 2023 BMW 2 Series received a major redesign for 2022, so the German luxury automaker is making only minor changes to the compact coupe for 2023 and bumping up the price slightly to $39,195 (all pricing includes a $995 destination charge).\n\nRelated: 2022 BMW M240i Review: BMW’s Tiniest Grand Tourer\n\nThe 2023 2 Series’ exterior styling carries over largely unchanged. However, all 2023 variants now get BMW’s curved gauge cluster as standard equipment. The remainder of the updates are defined by trim-option deletions for the 230i; Satin Aluminum exterior trim and Black High Gloss interior trim are no longer available. The M2 was fully redesigned for the 2023 model year; details can be found here.\n\nPerformance for the 2023 BMW 2 Series is also mostly unchanged, with the base 230i being powered by a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that makes 255 horsepower. The M240i gets a 382-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six; the 228i xDrive Gran Coupe comes with a 228-hp, turbo 2.0-liter inline-four; the M235i xDrive Gran Coupe has a turbo 2.0-liter inline-four that makes 301 hp; and the range-topping M2 now has a 453-hp, twin-turbo inline-six. An eight-speed automatic is the lone transmission for most of the lineup; the M2 comes with a standard six-speed manual and has the automatic transmission available.\n\nPricing and Release Date\n\nThe 2023 BMW 2 Series is available now. Rear-wheel drive is standard, and optional all-wheel drive adds $2,000; the M2 is RWD only. Full pricing is below:\n\n230i: $39,195\n228i Gran Coupe: $38,795\nM235i xDrive Gran Coupe: $48,595\nM240i: $50,095\nM2: $63,195\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nRedesigned 2023 BMW M2: The Smallest M Scores Big HP Boost\n2020 BMW 228 Gran Coupe Review: Little, and of Little Point\n2020 BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe Poised to Take on Mercedes CLA\n2022 BMW 2 Series Coupe Gains Power, Loses Manual\n2020 BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe: 5 Things We Like, 6 Things We Don’t\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 BMW 2 Series?\n\nThe BMW 2 Series is a small, sporty luxury coupe available with a choice of three engines. Powering the base 230i is a 255-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder, while the energetic M240i is equipped with a 382-hp, turbo 3.0-liter inline-six. Both engines are coupled with an eight-speed automatic transmission and rear- or all-wheel drive. Sorry, BMW fans: If you want a manual gearbox, you’ll have to pony up for the pricey performance M2 version that has a 453-hp, twin-turbo six-cylinder, standard AWD, and a six-speed manual or eight-speed automatic transmission. The 2 Series’ competitors include the Lexus RC, Nissan Z and Toyota Supra.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 BMW 2 Series?\n\nThe 2 Series lineup enters the 2024 model year with no notable changes or updates. \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 BMW 2 Series Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n12.3-inch digital instrument panel\n8.8-inch infotainment display\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto \nNavigation\nWi-Fi hot spot\nDual-zone climate control\nTwo USB ports\nPower-adjustable front seats\nLane departure steering assist\nLane departure warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nBlind spot warning\n\nAvailable features include: \n\n10.3-inch infotainment display\nSix-speed manual transmission (M2)\nMoonroof\nInterior ambient lighting\nHeated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nHead-up instrument display\nHands-free park assist\n360-degree camera system\nWireless device charging\n16-speaker Harman Kardon audio system\nShould I Buy the 2024 BMW 2 Series?\n\nThe 2 Series is the type of BMW that enthusiast drivers love. It’s small and agile, wonderfully quick (even with its base engine) and has a firm ride that inspires confidence in spirited driving. Optional AWD provides added grip when Mother Nature doesn’t want to cooperate. The 2 Series’ small trunk and tiny backseat are expected in such a pert coupe, but we wish the exhaust note were more aggressive across the range, including the tire-smoking M2. The steering also exhibits a degree of numbness that’s surprising in such a sporty vehicle.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2021 BMW 2 Series?\n\nThe BMW 2 Series is the brand’s entry-level car. It’s available as a four-seat coupe or convertible and a five-seat, four-door Gran Coupe. \n\nThe coupe and convertible come in 230i and M240i form. The 230i is powered by a 248-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, while the M240i gets a 335-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six. Both versions are offered with rear- or all-wheel drive and an eight-speed automatic or six-speed manual transmission. \n\nThe Gran Coupe is powered by a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that makes 228 hp in the 228i and 301 hp in the M235i. The Gran Coupe has standard all-wheel drive and an eight-speed automatic transmission. Competitors include the Audi TT and Mercedes-Benz A-Class. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2021 BMW 2 Series?\n\nThe coupe and convertible gain standard Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity, while the Gran Coupe adds Android Auto and a digital instrument panel. \n\nWhat Features in the 2021 BMW 2 Series Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n17-inch wheels\nLED headlights\nRain-sensing windshield wipers\nPush-button start\nForward collision warning\nLane departure warning\nFront and rear parking sensors\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nKeyless access\nPower moonroof\nHeated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nWireless device charging\nHarman Kardon stereo\nShould I Buy the 2021 BMW 2 Series?\n\nAs BMW’s lineup expands and becomes more technologically complex, the 2 Series coupe and convertible offer the well-balanced, sporty driving experience upon which the brand built its reputation. The 2 Series also has a surprising amount of interior and trunk room for its size. The Gran Coupe, however, uses a front-wheel-drive platform, and the car’s driving experience doesn’t measure up to BMW standards.",

Two models are available: the 230i and M240i. The 230i is powered by a 248-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine while the M240i gets a 335-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter six-cylinder. Both versions are offered with rear- or all-wheel drive and either an eight-speed automatic transmission or a six-speed manual. Competitors include the Audi A3  and Mercedes-Benz A-Class .\n\nWhat’s New on the 2019 BMW 2 Series?\n\nStandard Active Driving Assistant includes lane departure and forward collision warnings and city collision mitigation. Parking sensors are now standard. The optional navigation system adds real-time traffic information and a one-year trial of Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 BMW 2 Series Are Most Important?\n\nAs most cars of this size have migrated to front-wheel drive, the 2 Series’ rear-wheel-drive-based architecture has become a more unique offering.  Available features include a heated steering wheel, heated front seats, a moonroof, wireless device charging and a Wi-Fi hot spot.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 BMW 2 Series?\n\nAs BMW’s lineup continues to expand and become more technologically complex, the 2 Series offers the elemental, well-balanced driving experience on which the brand built its reputation. The 2 Series also has a surprising amount of interior and trunk room for its size. Luxury competitors don’t offer much like it without stepping up to the next size and price class, but it is light on standard luxury features and can get expensive when optioned out.",

      "expert_review": "BMW's smallest series of vehicles gets a small set of updates for the 2018 model year. Each member of the 2 Series is receiving slightly tweaked exterior styling and updated interiors with new technology and materials.\n\n\nThe 2 Series will continue to be sold in both coupe and convertible body styles in two models: 230i, M240i. The performance-oriented M2 is coupe-only.\n\n \n\nExterior\nExterior changes in this update are few, but BMW says each of the 2 Series models adds LED headlights and three new paint colors, along with updated wheel designs. The general aesthetic remains intact, with a long hood and short deck lid, which makes the passenger area appear to be pushed toward the rear of the vehicle.\n\nInterior\nMost of the updates to the 2018 2 Series are found inside, where BMW has redesigned the instrument panel and installed the latest version of its multimedia system, iDrive 6.0. A 6.6-inch display is standard, with a larger 8.8-inch touchscreen as an option.\n\nAlso on the technology side, the 2 Series offers a few handy features, including the On-Street Parking Information service to guess where open parking spaces will be along your route. Wireless charging is optional and the 2 Series will also offer wireless integration of Apple CarPlay.\n\nThe BMW Connected app will be more helpful on the navigation front, sending addresses to the vehicle and even syncing with your calendar to let the driver know ideal departure times for appointments based on real-time traffic data.\n\nUnder the Hood\nEach of the three 2 Series models features a different engine, starting with 230i models and their 248-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder, which is mated to a six-speed manual or eight-speed automatic transmission. The M240i has the same transmission options and a larger 335-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter inline six-cylinder. Both models come with standard rear-wheel drive and all-wheel drive as an option.\n\nSafety\nAvailable safety technology includes adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability, lane departure warning, automatic emergency braking at speeds up to 37 mph with pedestrian detection, and an automatic parking system.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 BMW 2 Series?\n\nThe BMW 2 Series is the brand’s entry-level car. It is a sporty two-door coupe or convertible with seating for four. Two models are available: the 230i and M240i. The 230i is powered by a 248-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, while the M240i gets a 335-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six. Both versions are offered with rear- or all-wheel drive and either an eight-speed automatic transmission or a six-speed manual. Competitors include the Audi A3 and Mercedes-Benz A-Class. A new 2 Series Gran Coupe debuts for 2020 and is covered separately in the Cars.com Research section.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 BMW 2 Series?\n\nTrim updates include darkened taillights, a gloss-black grille frame for the 230i and gloss-black mirror caps and gray accents for the M240i. Rain-sensing wipers are now standard.\n\nWhat Features in the 2020 BMW 2 Series Are Most Important?\n\nAs most cars of this size have migrated to front-wheel drive, including the new 2 Series Gran Coupe, the two-door 2 Series’ rear-wheel-drive-based architecture has become a more unique offering. Available features include a heated steering wheel, heated front seats, a moonroof, wireless device charging and a Wi-Fi hot spot.\n\nShould I Buy the 2020 BMW 2 Series?\n\nAs BMW’s lineup continues to expand and become more technologically complex, the 2 Series offers the elemental, well-balanced driving experience on which the brand built its reputation. The 2 Series also has a surprising amount of interior and trunk room for its size. Luxury competitors don’t offer much like it without stepping up to the next size and price class, but it is light on standard luxury features and can get expensive when optioned out.",
