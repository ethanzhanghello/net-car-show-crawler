      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 BMW 3 Series?\n\nThe BMW 3 Series is a five-seat luxury sports sedan that competes with the Audi A4, Lexus IS and Mercedes-Benz C-Class. The 330i is powered by a 255-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, while the M340i gets a 382-hp, turbo 3.0-liter inline-six that works with a mild-hybrid system. Both engines team with an eight-speed automatic transmission, and rear- and all-wheel-drive models are offered. Plug-in hybrid 330e and high-performance M3 versions of the 3 Series are also available. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 BMW 3 Series? \n\nThe 3 Series’ exterior sees some subtle styling updates, and the cabin gets BMW’s Curved Display — a combination of a 12.3-inch digital instrument panel and a 14.9-inch touchscreen display. BMW says the displays have improved graphics and use the automaker’s latest operating system with improved Intelligent Personal Assistant functionality. \n\nWhat Features in the 2023 BMW 3 Series Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nPower moonroof\nLED headlights \n40/20/40-split, folding backseat\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nNavigation\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nRemote start\nHeated front and rear seats\nHeated steering wheel\nHarman Kardon premium stereo\nHead-up display\nBlind spot warning\nLane departure steering assist\nHands-free low-speed highway driving system\n​​Adaptive suspension\nShould I Buy the 2023 BMW 3 Series?\n\nIf you’re looking for a compact sports sedan that prioritizes performance, particularly in M340i or performance M3 form, the BMW 3 Series should be on your list. The 3 Series also offers good ride quality, and its interior boasts high-quality materials and upgraded tech. A lack of steering feel is a notable negative, though, and the 3 Series can get pricey with options.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 BMW 3 Series?\n\nThe BMW 3 Series is a five-seat luxury sports sedan pitted against competitors such as the Audi A4, Cadillac CT4, Genesis G70, Lexus IS and Mercedes-Benz C-Class. Powering the base 330i is a 255-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that’s coupled with an eight-speed automatic transmission. The M340i gets a 386-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six with a 48-volt mild-hybrid system. The high-performance M3 packs a twin-turbo inline-six with 473 hp in the base trim; the M3 Competition makes 503 hp with rear-wheel drive and 523 hp with all-wheel drive. The base M3 is available with a six-speed manual transmission; all other trims come only with an eight-speed automatic. All trims are available with RWD or AWD. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 BMW 3 Series? \n\nThe plug-in hybrid 330e and the limited-edition M3 CS have been dropped for 2025. The 330 and M340i get a retuned suspension and interior updates, including BMW’s latest Operating System 8.5 infotainment software and new steering wheels. The M3 also gets the new 8.5 software, along with BMW’s Curved Display digital dashboard, a new flat-bottom steering wheel and redesigned headlights. \n\nWhat Features in the 2025 BMW 3 Series Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n14.9-inch infotainment touchscreen\n12.3-inch digital gauge display\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nPower moonroof\nLED headlights \n40/20/40-split folding backseat\nSatellite radio\nNavigation\nRain-sensing wipers\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nRemote start\nHeated front and rear seats\nHeated steering wheel\nHarman Kardon premium stereo\nHead-up instrument display\nBlind spot warning\nLane-centering steering\nHands-free low-speed highway driving system\n​​Adaptive suspension\nShould I Buy the 2025 BMW 3 Series?\n\nFor many years, the BMW 3 Series has been the default choice for luxury shoppers looking for a relatively small and sporty sedan. The cabin has adult-friendly accommodations (at least in the front seats), and its onboard tech is suitably impressive for a car in this segment. That being said, care must be taken when adding options or climbing to higher-performing models.

      "expert_review": "The BMW 3 Series is luxury sports sedan royalty. It’s the first car I think of when considering this class, and for good reason — it was the best for a good stretch of time. The BMW ran away from the luxury sports sedan field and won our 2013 Challenge in a landslide. That was the first Challenge that I participated in for Cars.com, and after driving each of the competitors, it was clear that the BMW was the class of the field. It accelerated harder, drove better and felt more refined.\n\nRelated: 2020 BMW M340i: Can BMW Lift the Crown Once Again?\n\nBut the crown has fallen on hard times of late. When we did the Luxury Sports Sedan Challenge again in 2017, the BMW 330i slipped all the way to sixth place. This was due in some part to a curious set of winter tires and strange options, but to me the bigger issue was that a new crop of contenders like the Alfa Romeo Giulia and Cadillac ATS had leapfrogged it — especially when it came to driving acumen.\n\nNot winning a Challenge is one thing, but losing a Challenge and not being one of the three cars selected to be a part of our “fun to drive” rankings? Double ouch. And that Challenge occurred before my favorite current entrant in the class arrived and took home our Best of 2019 award: the Genesis G70.\n\nIn an effort to reclaim its place, BMW has redesigned the 3 Series for 2019, which marks the introduction of the G20 generation (the previous generation was dubbed the F30). It has a better interior, new technology and safety features, and (of course) new styling. Going through all of that will take some more time with the car, but I arrived in Palm Springs, Calif., with a simpler question in mind: Does the 3 Series get its mojo back?\n\nI tested two versions of the new 3 Series, a 2019 330i and a 2020 M340i xDrive, in two very different environments — the 330i on the street, and the M340i on the track. (Per our ethics policy, Cars.com pays for its own lodging and transportation at such automaker-sponsored events.)\n\nTrack Impressions: Plenty of Go\n\nThe M340i is a new 3 Series family member. A 340i was offered last year, but the addition of the letter “M” to the car is significant. The M340i goes up a level when it comes to performance, and it starts under the hood with a 382-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder that makes 369 pounds-feet of torque. Those represent gains of 62 hp and 39 pounds-feet of torque compared with 2018’s 340i and a lowering of the zero-to-60-mph time from 4.8 to 4.2 seconds.\n\nAs a part of the redesign, the 3 Series dropped its manual transmission option, which leaves an eight-speed automatic as the only transmission. It’s sad to lose another manual, but in our recent testing, our staff did not have kind words for the manual and I’m here to tell you the automatic is quite good. On the track, I left it to its own devices and it held gears and downshifted when I wanted it to without prompting, two things automatics usually have trouble with.\n\nThe M340i I tested also came with all-wheel drive (that’s the xDrive part of the name), but it operates with a clear rear-wheel-drive bias. BMW says that the system prioritizes sending power to the rear wheels, and it feels that way on the track. Only when you’re trying to put down some extra power on corner exit do you really feel the AWD help to pull the car out of the corner and sling it toward the next one with added impetus.\n\nDriving on the track, the powertrain was the star of the show. The M340i has an earnest eagerness to its acceleration; power pours on quickly and carries through the long straightaways without letting up. It was also predictable, without any sudden spikes that could upset the car — if you’re precise with your foot, the engine’s output will match it.\n\nThe goodness of the powertrain doesn’t quite carry through to the rest of the driving experience. The notable issue I had was with the steering, which echoed a complaint that we had with the last generation of the 3 Series rears its head again here (as it did in the BMW Z4 I also evaluated recently). I found the M340i to have good balance on track, and the one I tested came with the optional adaptive suspension, which does a good job of limiting body roll and keeping the car neutral. But the steering is missing feedback, with a hint of vagueness that creeps up more noticeably the harder that you drive. It’s in those moments that I needed a bit more communication from the car, and the lack of response made me back off at times where I probably could have pushed the car further but couldn’t feel where the edge was.\n\nThe numerous powertrain and suspension updates to the new M340i make it a more capable car than the older 340i, without question. It’s really only the steering that holds the car back.\n\nStreet Impressions: Day-to-Day Fun\n2019 BMW 330i | Cars.com photos by Brian Wong\n\nNext, I drove a 330i on the street. The new-generation 330i also sees a power gain, its turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder making 255 hp and 295 pounds-feet of torque, which are increases of 7 hp and 37 pounds-feet of torque, respectively. It’s also mated to an eight-speed automatic and is offered with AWD, though I tested a RWD model that revealed some differences.\n\nMuch like the M340i, the powertrain is impressive. It, too, has a wide power band, with maximum torque opening up from 1,550 to 4,400 rpm. That makes the engine similarly responsive, just with less kick than the M340i — but I found that it’s still plenty. It has the same transmission, which is just as well-sorted for street driving as it is for track duty; on a curvy mountain road, bump the 330i into Sport mode and the transmission gladly holds gears through the turn to slingshot you out the other side.\n\nMy test vehicle started with a base price of $41,245 (including destination charges) but piled on the options until the sticker climbed all the way to $59,970 — more than the M340i’s base price of $54,995. Included in those options, however, were a slew of performance upgrades that are standard on the M340i, such as an M Sport suspension, M Sport brakes, M Sport differential and variable sport steering. This brought the two cars closer together in terms of their ride and handling than I thought they would be, and the 330i has much of the M340i’s great balance even without the adaptive suspension.\n\nI did find one way in which the 330i performed better than the M340i did: It has quicker turn-in. This could be due to suspension differences absent the AWD of my M340i. The 330i has a propensity to dive-bomb the nose of the car into corners, which gave it a bit of an Alfa Romeo Giulia flair in those initial moments. I think the car is still missing some steering feedback, but the vagueness isn’t quite as pronounced as it was in the M340i; I’d surmise that also has to do with the front wheels being unencumbered by drive hardware.\n\nThe 330i also rode quite well for a car on a non-adaptive sport suspension. It’s composed at highway speeds, and road imperfections on some beat-up backroads were felt but didn’t punish me. Also worth highlighting (on both vehicles) is the ease with which you can find an ideal driving position. The steering wheel has a lot of both tilting and telescoping travel, so I could set my feet in the right place and easily maneuver the steering wheel to match.\n\nAlmost There\n\nI found this to be a solid return to form for the 3 Series. The powertrains of both cars are a highlight, and they drive appreciably better than their counterparts in the F30 generation. Are the improvements enough for the 3 Series to reclaim its perch atop the class? From this much exposure, I’m not convinced it’s not quite there — the steering issues hold it back from taking that spot among competitors, but my goodness, those engines are fantastic.\n\nIt was striking to me that I preferred the 330i’s steering and, consequently, its driving experience slightly more than the M340i. It may not have the same raw acceleration, but I would take that more connected feeling over the M340i’s slightly robotic athleticism in most cases. To resolve this fully, it will probably take some time in a RWD version of the M340i (sans adaptive suspension) to get a truer comparison of the two. Track driving also exposes more of a car’s flaws than does a street drive, and I’m not sure how the 330i would have held up under the harsher light or if the M340i would look better after a jaunt on the streets. We’ll have to find that out soon enough.\n\nThe 2019 330i will hit dealerships in March, with the 2020 M340i to follow in the summer.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
