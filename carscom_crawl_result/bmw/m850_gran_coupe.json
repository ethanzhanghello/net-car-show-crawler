      "expert_review": "Competes with: Mercedes-Benz CLS and AMG GT, Audi S7 and RS7, Porsche Panamera\n\nLooks like: An 8 Series coupe with less sensuality and more practicality\n\nDrivetrains: 335-horsepower, 3.0-liter turbocharged inline six-cylinder or 523-hp, twin-turbocharged 4.4-liter V-8; eight-speed automatic transmission; rear or all-wheel drive\n\nHits dealerships: September\n\nThe rollout of BMW’s new flagship 8 Series continues with the unveiling of the 2020 Gran Coupe, a four-door coupe-style sedan that will join the two-door coupe and convertible atop the lineup.\n\nRelated: BMW Blows Lid Off 8 Series Coupe With New Convertible\n\nThe fastback sedan will be offered in three versions: a rear-wheel-drive 840i, an all-wheel-drive 840i xDrive and the M850i xDrive performance version. It will be the biggest and heaviest 8 Series model at 9.0 inches longer, 1.2 inches wider and 2.2 inches taller than the two-door coupe on a wheelbase that is 7.9 inches longer.\n\nPricing starts at $85,895 for the 2020 840i Gran Coupe. The all-wheel-drive 840i xDrive Gran Coupe starts at $88,795, and the M850i xDrive Gran Coupe starts at $109,895. All prices include a $995 destination charge. These new variants will join the coupe and convertible at U.S. dealers in September.\n\nExterior\n\nThe sedan’s styling is new from the less steeply raked windshield and back, and a sleek fastback roofline blends a trunk lid with an upturned spoiler lip. But overall it gives up quite a bit of the sensuality exhibited by the two-door’s body shape and surfaces, trading the purity of the styling for the practicality of its larger size and four doors.\n\nLED headlights flank the large, one-piece kidney grille, and the aggressive bumper openings are functional. The heavily sculpted rear end features wide LED taillights.\n\nA panoramic glass moonroof stretches from the windshield to the back window, though the M850i will offer a lighter carbon fiber roof that also lowers the car’s center of gravity.\n\n2020 BMW 8 Series Gran Coupe | Manufacturer image\nInterior\n\nThe luxury cabin is familiar from the coupe model, just roomier, thanks to the added width and height. And the added wheelbase and length will make for more comfortable rear-seat accommodations than the tight coupe, as well as slightly more grand-touring-worthy trunk space measuring 15.5 cubic feet, not quite a foot more than the two-door. Rear headroom is up by 3.4 inches, legroom by 7.1 inches and shoulder room by 7.7 inches. The rear seat has a 40/20/40-split, folding back for more cargo room.\n\nFront sport seats, and Nappa leather dashboard and door trim, are standard. Vernasca leather seats are standard on the 840i trim levels, with Merino leather as an option (standard on the M850i). A fancier Merino leather interior is optional for all. And the Gran Coupe gets its own center console that extends to divide the rear seats but still allow for a center passenger when needed. Ambient lighting also is standard.\n\nThe dashboard features a 10.25-inch touchscreen and center controls along with a BMW iDrive knob-and-button multimedia controller. A navigation system is standard, along with a 12.3-inch configurable instrument display and a head-up display.\n\nUnder the Hood\n\nThe 840i models get the latest edition of BMW’s 3.0-liter inline six-cylinder putting out 335 horsepower and 368 pounds-feet of torque and are mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission with standard paddle shifters and launch control. BMW says the rear-wheel-drive 840i Gran Coupe can accelerate from zero-to-60 mph in 4.9 seconds and the all-wheel-drive 840i xDrive can get there in 4.6 seconds. Both are speed limited to 130 mph with all-season tires and 155 mph with performance tires.\n\nThe brute is the M850i xDrive Gran Coupe with a 523-hp, twin-turbocharged 4.4-liter V-8 putting out 553 pounds-feet of torque with an eight-speed automatic and all-wheel drive. BMW says the zero-to-60 mph time is 3.7 seconds, while top-speed limits are the same as the 840i. The V-8 includes a standard flap-controlled sport exhaust system keyed to the 8 Series’ mild-to-wild driving modes, with the exhaust note in the most-aggressive Sport Plus most likely to unsettle your neighbors.\n\nThe eight-speed transmission’s electronic control system is capable of using data from the navigation system to alter shifting characteristics to suit current driving conditions, including downshifting early when approaching intersections and minimizing unnecessary shifts between closely grouped corners. BMW also uses navigation data and sensors that read the movement of other vehicles to avoid unnecessary activation of the stop-start system. The torque-vectoring all-wheel-drive system is full time and rear biased. It has an electronic clutch that fully shifts torque between front and rear wheels. And adaptive shock absorbers are standard on all models. The 840i models get 18-inch wheels standard with larger sizes optional, while the 850i has standard 20-inch wheels.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nBMW Lineup Gets a New Top Coupe: the 2019 BMW 8 Series\nTo Say We Took a Quick Spin in the 2019 BMW M850i Is a Gross Understatement\nCheck M8: BMW Moves Pieces Into Place for High-Performance 8 Series\nBMW Looks (Way) Ahead to L.A. for 2 Series Gran Coupe Entrée\n2019 BMW X7: Plenty to Like About the Three-Row Bimmer\n2018 BMW M5 Review: Automatic for the People\nSafety\n\nA full range of safety and driver assistance technology is offered for the Gran Coupe. Standard on all versions is a front collision system with automatic braking.\n\nAn optional Driver Assistance Professional Package adds a blind spot and rear-cross-traffic alert, lane departure warning, lane-keeping steering assist, adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go, parking assistance and a 360-degree camera system. It also includes what BMW calls its Extended Traffic Jam Assistant that allows for semi-autonomous driving in congestion on limited-access highways at speeds below 40 mph.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2022 BMW 8 Series?\n\nThe BMW 8 Series is a high-end luxury car that’s offered in three body styles — coupe, convertible and four-door Gran Coupe — with seating for four or five, depending on the body style. The 840i is powered by a 335-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six engine, while the M850i and M8 Gran Coupe get turbocharged 4.4-liter V-8s rated at 523 and 617 hp, respectively. The new Alpina B8 Gran Coupe has a 612-hp, turbo 4.4-liter V-8.\n\nAn eight-speed automatic transmission is standard, and rear- and all-wheel-drive models are available. Competitors include the Jaguar F-Type, Lexus LC 500 and Porsche Panamera.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2022 BMW 8 Series?\n\nThe M Sport Package and extended leather upholstery are now standard. Coupe and convertible versions of the M8 return for 2022, and all M8s now come with the Competition Package.\n\nWhat Features in the 2022 BMW 8 Series Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nLeather upholstery\nDigital instrument panel\n10.25-inch multimedia screen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nHarman Kardon surround-sound system\nSatellite radio\nForward collision warning\nCity collision mitigation\nLane departure warning\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nHands-free low-speed highway driving system\n360-degree camera system\nBlind spot warning\nFour-wheel steering\nShould I Buy the 2022 BMW 8 Series?\n\nIf you’re in the market for a luxurious European sedan that’s a bit more stylish than a BMW 7 Series or Mercedes-Benz S-Class, the 8 Series Gran Coupe is worth a look. The coupe and convertible variants are sportier still, and that’s not counting the high-performance M8 versions. Whichever model you choose, you’ll be getting a premium grand tourer that can be packed with technology.",
