      "expert_review": "The saying is that good things come in threes. At Bavarian Motor Works you can add, “and in V-8 form.”\n\nThe German automaker brings to market for 1994 three new V-8 models in its 5-Series line of automobiles. As BMW’s midsize line of sports-oriented vehicles, the 5-Series already had a sterling reputation for quality and performance with in-line six-cylinder engines, and now it is offering a pair of V-8s for the really go-fast contingent.\n\nActually, there still are a couple of six-cylinders available in the 5 cars, a 525i Sedan and a 525i Touring sports wagon. But it is those 5-Series models with two more cylinders that are going rattle a few chains on the open road.\n\nThese are a 530i Sedan and Touring, and a 540i Sedan.\n\nUsing the last two numerals as a reference to engine size for the 5s, the 530i is powered by a 3.0-liter V-8. And the rocket ship 540i uses the 4.0-liter V-8 that powers the 740i and 740iL BMWs.\n\nBoth V-8s are exotic speedway-type motors sporting four overhead camshafts and four valves per cylinder. When you push on the button with these babies, all sorts of things begin to happen, especially with the larger displacement engine.\n\nThe 243-cubic inch (4.0-liter) V-8 hauls the 3,800 pound Sedan model from zero to 60 miles per hour in 6.7 seconds, all the more impressive in view of the fact it’s done with a “five-speed” automatic transmission. A manual gearbox is not available.\n\n“Many of the world’s luxury car makers are going to five- speed automatics,” said Dennis Reinbold, president of Dreyer & Reinbold BMW. “Detroit doesn’t seem to want to do this, but we think it’s a better transmission.”\n\nThe performance really is not all that surprising, as the 243-cube V-8 puts out 282 horsepower, a performance figure well above the accepted performance benchmark of one horsepower per cubic inch.\n\nFor the flat-to-the-floor coterie of motorists, top speed is electronically limited to 149 mph. If it weren’t for the limiter, this thing would almost fly.\n\nOf course, it takes money to go this fast, something on the order of $47,500 base sticker. If you don’t mind going a little slower for $6,000 less cost, the 530i is the same basic automobile with a smaller engine.\n\nYou’re not exactly dragging your heels here, as the 3.0-liter-powered sedan has a 0-60 rating of 9.1 seconds, and a top speed of 139 mph.\n\nThe 183-cubic-inch, 32-valve V-8 is rated at 215 horsepower, and like its larger sibling has a power figure exceeding one horsepower per cubic inch. This model also is available only with a five-speed automatic.\n\nAmerican automobile manufacturers have not been at all enthusiastic about a five-speed automatic, believing that with the complexity of technology and additional cost the five- speeder doesn’t offer that much over a four-speed.\n\nBMW doesn’t agree with this analysis, and backs up its belief with a quite advanced electronically controlled automatic that is a major step forward in automatic transmission performance.\n\nThe 5-Ser ies offers an automatic that responds to driving conditions via an ATC system whose cognomen stands for Adaptive Transmission Control. Going beyond BMW’s three-mode system of Economy-Sport- Winter, ATC increases the number of modes to nine and makes mode selection automatic.\n\nIn addition to the Adaptive mode, where the automatic does all your thinking for you, there is a Manual mode whereby a driver can manually shift the five-speed automatic from first gear through fourth gear. The Manual mode is designed for those who want to do more than just steer.\n\n“It (the automatic) is as smooth an anything you’ve ever encountered,” Reinbold said. “There’s just nothing like it on the market.”\n\nThere is more to the 530i and 540i than the engine and transmission, of course.\n\nStylewise, the exterior of the V-8 models is distinguished by new, wider BMW “kidney” grille centers, trunk-lid identification badge and, for the 540i, new honeycomb-pattern alloy wheels. Interior luxury is en hanced by ga thered leather upholstery and high-gloss walnut trim.\n\nIn the case of the 540i, the telescopic steering column is power adjusted and is combined with a three position memory system.\n\nAs midrange, midsized automobiles, the 530i and 540i constitute midlevel marketing penetration.\n\n“It’s hard to judge which sells the best,” Reinbold said, “because sales are split between them. But together they make up about a quarter of our overall sales.\n\n1994 BMW 540i Sedan Base price: $47,500.Type: front engine, rear-wheel drive, five-passenger, luxury, midsized sedan.Engine: dual-overhead-cam V-8, 4.0 liters, 32 valves, fuel injected, 282 horsepower, 295 foot-pounds of torque.Transmission: five- speed automatic.Acceleration: 0-60 mph in 6.7 seconds.Top speed: 149 mph.Mileage: 16 mpg city/23 mpg highway.Dimensions: wheelbase 108.7 inches; length 185.8 inches; width 68.9 inches; height 55.6 inches; curb weight: 3,800 pounds.Options: all-season traction control, heated front seats, heated outside mirrors.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 BMW 5 Series?\nThe BMW 5 Series is a five-seat, mid-size luxury sedan that competes with rivals like the Acura TLX, Audi A6, Genesis G80 and Mercedes-Benz E-Class. The entry-level 530i is powered by a 255-horsepower, turbocharged four-cylinder that sends power to the rear wheels via an eight-speed automatic transmission. The 530i xDrive employs the same turbo four-cylinder but adds all-wheel drive. The 540i xDrive comes with a 375-hp, turbo 3.0-liter inline-six, AWD and the eight-speed gearbox. New for 2025 is the 550e xDrive plug-in hybrid, which uses the same turbo 3.0-liter six-cylinder but adds an electric motor for a total output of 483 hp and an EPA-estimated electric driving range of 34 miles.\nThe 2025 model year also marks the return of the high-performance M5, which is now offered as a Touring wagon in addition to a sedan. It comes standard with a PHEV powertrain that pairs a twin-turbo 4.4-liter V-8 with an electric motor for a total output of 717 hp. The M5 accelerates from 0-60 mph in about 3.5 seconds and has a BMW-estimated electric driving range of 25 miles. \n\nBMW also offers an all-electric version of the 5 Series called the i5. \nWhat’s New on the 2025 BMW 5 Series?\nThe 5 Series was redesigned for 2024 and sees little change for 2025 other than the addition of the 550e xDrive and M5.\nWhat Features in the 2025 BMW 5 Series Are Most Important?\nStandard features include:\n\n14.9-inch touchscreen\n12.3-inch digital instrument cluster\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nWireless charging pad\nNavigation \nSatellite radio\nTwo USB ports\nWi-Fi hot spot\nKeyless entry\nMoonroof\n12-speaker Harman Kardon stereo\nSynthetic leather upholstery\nHeated front seats\nBlind spot warning \nRear cross-traffic alert\nAutomatic high beams\nLane departure warning\nRain-sensing wipers\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nVoice and gesture controls\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated rear seats\nPanoramic glass roof\nBowers & Wilkins audio system\nHeated steering wheel\nPower-operated rear sunshades\nAdaptive cruise control\nEvasive steering assist\nHead-up instrument display\n21-inch alloy wheels\nRear-wheel steering\n\nShould I Buy the 2025 BMW 5 Series?\nThe BMW 5 Series is a technical tour de force for car shoppers looking for a powerful and refined mid-size luxury sedan. With so many drivetrains on offer, there’s no shortage of ways to customize a 5 Series, and even the base 530i offers plenty of comfort, safety and tech features. While the 14.9-inch touchscreen is visually impressive, it can be confusing to use, and some menus are overly complicated. BMW fans might also find the 5 Series’ steering lacks the sharpness that’s often associated with the German automaker’s products. Yet for buyers who want to sidestep a larger, bulkier SUV, the 5 Series is a suave and sophisticated choice. The new M5 delivers jaw-dropping performance, but some enthusiasts complain it favors techno-wizardry over true driver engagement.",

      "expert_review": "A wave of depression overcame us when we opened the front door and peered at the car that had been dropped off for a Test Drive\n\nThe wife spotted the vehicle, too, raced to the closet and yanked out the uniform hanging there for just this occasion-double-breasted suit, hand-painted silk tie, white shirt with initials on pocket and cuffs, two socks of the same color, a pair of wingtips and the bottle of cologne without a hotel name on the label.\n\nYes, you guessed it, it was a Bimmer-the 540i sports sedan.\n\n“Puuulllleeeezzzze,” we begged the wife. “Every time we put those duds on when driving a BMW, people stop us at traffic lights to ask the price of pork belly futures or if we want to join the Chicago Bar Association.”\n\nAs usual, however, the pleading didn’t work, and we set off to slip behind the wheel of the machine of choice of those who not only wear Gucci and Pucci, but who also know those guys’ first names.\n\nRegular readers are aware that we typically hold Bimmers suspect as overpriced and overrated machines that gained fame and notoriety as the “poor man’s” Mercedes before the folks from BMW started believing the press clippings and priced their vehicles at levels that would make Benz blush.\n\nThen, too, though BMWs traditionally have been built to breathe fire on autobahns, we’ve searched the road atlas for years and haven’t found an autobahn in the greater metropolitan Chicago region-just a bunch of roads filled with construction barricades and, therefore, bumper-to-bumper traffic between March and November.\n\nTo say the least, we entered the BMW 540i with trepidation, which lasted only about two minutes-the time it took to heat the boiler, fasten the belt and reach second gear.\n\nThe540i is a little gem, a high-performance sports sedan with a whisper-smooth rocket in a 4-liter, 32-valve, 282-horse-power, V-8 rocket.\n\nEach forward gear forces you back into the leather bucket as the slippery smooth 6-speed manual, offered for the first time in the 540i, coaxes every ounce of energy out of the V-8.\n\nThe tires don’t just grab the pavement, they lock on. Take a turn, take a turn at speed, take a turn at a bit too much speed, and the car sits flat and you sit erect and in total control.\n\nSafety isn’t just air bags and brakes-though dual air cushions and anti-lock brakes are standard-it’s also command of the road. In the 540i, you own it.\n\nThen Ma Nature dumped a light load of snow/sleet on the pavement, just enough so the tire tracks approaching the stop sign looked as if two huge rubber serpants had gotten there first.\n\nYou promise to tread lightly, until you remember that the 540i comes with traction assist to keep you pointed straight and sitting upright even when the road surface is dusted in frozen dew.\n\nThis is about as close as you get to motoring utopia, even if the folks fro m BMW still insist that the only good seat is a granite one, and the narrower the better. And attached to those seats are headrests of so large they block vision when backing up.\n\nWhile we’re listing gripes: If you’ve got more than one passenger, the one getting the minuscule back seat better be kin and good-natured to boot.\n\nAlso, though 4-liter likes to flex its muscle, in doing so it develops quite a thirst. The 14-mile-per-gallon city/23 m.p.g. highway rating means the only thing that can hold back a 540i is the sight of a gas station-any gas station.\n\nAcquiring a 540i is costly. Base price is $48,600. Standard equipment includes speed-sensitive power steering, fog lights, speed-controlled intermittent wipers, dual power/heated outside mirrors, heated driver’s door lock, map lights, removable flashlight in glovebox, 12-way power driver’s seat, split folding rear seats, trip odometer, leather upholstery and steering wheel cover, velour carpeting , power windows with key-off operation, rear-window defroster, air conditioning, power sunroof, AM/FM stereo with cassette, wiring for CD changer, power locks, remote keyless entry, front and rear roll bars, twin tube gas pressurized shocks, four-wheel disc brakes, cast alloy wheels and all-season radial tires.\n\nAdd $1,300 in gas-guzzler tithing and another $1,350 for the traction assist, a pricey system that will pay for itself the first time it saves you a trip to the body shop.\n\nThen add the 10 percent luxury tax (for any transaction that exceeds $32,000). A trade-in, of course, will lessen the luxury tax burden. Of course, when you are in the $48,600 region, who quibbles about a luxury tax or the price of pork bellies or membership in the Chicago Bar Association?\n\nAdd another $370 for heated seats and $470 for freight and you’re on your way. To save a few pennies, you can opt for the 540i with 5-speed automatic rather than the 6-speed manual, because the car with automatic starts at $47,950, or $650 less. By going with automatic plus dropping the heated seats, you can save $1,000 to help offset the guzzler tax.\n\nOne word of warning about the 540i: BMW says its owners need to devote their total time and energy to driving, not sipping their favorite beverage, so this $48,600 machine comes without a cupholder.\n\nGucci and Pucci are welcome, but not the Hills Bros.\n\n1995 BMW 540i\nWheelbase: 108.7 inches\nLength: 185.8 inches\nEngine: 4-liter, 32-valve, 282-h.p., V-8\nTransmission: 6-speed manual\nEPA mileage: 14 m.p.g. city/23 m.p.g. highway\nPluses: Dual air bags and ABS standard, traction control available as an option. The 4-liter is super quick, yet quiet. The 6-speed is very smooth. The suspension is a dream.\nMinuses: You may never pass a gas station that the 4-liter doesn’t like. The seats are a bit stiff. The front seat headrests are too large and obstruct side and rear vision. The rear seat isn’t all that roomy. Because there are no autobahns in Illinois, how about just one cupholder, please?",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 BMW 5 Series?\n\nThe 2020 BMW 5 Series is a five-seat mid-size luxury sedan that competes with the Mercedes-Benz E-Class and Audi A6, among others. It offers a choice of turbocharged gas engines as well as plug-in hybrid, M Performance and M5 versions. Rear- and all-wheel-drive models are offered.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 BMW 5 Series?\n\nKeyless entry is now standard. The performance-oriented M550i’s twin-turbocharged V-8 engine is now rated at 523 horsepower and 553 pounds-feet of torque; that’s an increase of 67 hp and 73 pounds-feet of torque from last year, and the sedan’s 0-60-mph time has dropped 0.3 second to just 3.6 seconds. Meanwhile, the 530e gets a larger high-voltage battery pack that increases the car’s all-electric range from 16 to 20 miles for rear-drive versions and from 14 to 18 miles for all-wheel-drive models.\n\nNewly standard features for the M5 include a digital instrument panel and wireless device charging. The M5 lineup also includes the Edition 35 Years, which celebrates 35 years of the M5 sports sedan. Just 35 have been allotted for the U.S.\n\nWhat Features in the 2020 BMW 5 Series Are Most Important?\n\nStandard active safety features include blind spot warning, lane departure warning, forward collision warning, pedestrian detection, city collision mitigation and rear cross-traffic alert. Standard luxury features include wood trim, automatic air conditioning and navigation. Available features include an active suspension, power trunk lid, aluminum cabin trim, Nappa leather upholstery, massaging front seats, a heated steering wheel, a head-up display, wireless device charging, a gesture-based interface, a Harman Kardon or Bowers & Wilkins surround-sound system, a night vision system, adaptive cruise control and a 360-degree camera system.\n\nShould I Buy the 2020 BMW 5 Series?\n\nWhether you’re looking for an efficient luxury car or a high-powered sports sedan, there’s probably a version of the 5 Series that’ll fit your needs. Its high-quality interior impresses and the car can be loaded up with tech features, but some shoppers might find the backseat not roomy enough.",

      "expert_review": "Competes with: Audi A6, Genesis G80, Jaguar XF, Mercedes-Benz E-Class\n\nLooks like: A longer, taller, wider 5 Series with more dynamic styling\n\nPowertrains: 335-horsepower, single-motor EV drive unit with 84.3-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack and rear-wheel drive (i5 eDrive40); 593-hp, dual-motor EV drive unit with 84.3-kWh lithium-ion battery pack and all-wheel drive (i5 M60); 255-hp, twin-turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine and RWD or AWD (530i); 375-hp, twin-turbo 3.0-liter six-cylinder (540i)\n\nHits dealerships: Now\n\nBMW’s mid-size 5 Series sedan was last revised for 2021, and it’s got some big news for 2024: The i5 fully electric version is joining the lineup.\n\nRelated: Packages, Paints, Prices Shift for 2023 BMW 5 Series\n\nFor 2024, the eighth generation of the 5 Series sees other changes, including revised styling, updated gas powertrains, additional driver-assistance features that take self-driving to another level and a new operating system for infotainment.\n\nExterior\n\nThe 2024 5 Series grows in every direction over 2023. The new model is 3.4 inches longer, 1.3 inches wider and 1.4 inches taller than the outgoing version. The sedan’s wheelbase has been increased by 0.8 inch; BMW says the added dimensions translate to more occupant space and cargo room. The new model’s styling changes are most dramatic in front, with a more upright grille and striking headlight design. Two nearly vertical daytime running lights flank the optional illuminated BMW kidney grille for a more dynamic looking face.\n\nThe i5 M60 wears additional gloss-black exterior styling bits as well as large air intakes, a grille featuring horizontal slats and an M logo, 19-inch M light alloy wheels, and a rear apron with a pronounced diffuser.\n\nInterior\n\nThe new 5 Series features a revised interior highlighted by the BMW Curved Display. The setup pairs a 12.3-inch information display behind the steering wheel with a 14.9-inch control display front and center; together they combine to create the look of one sleek, seamless large screen.\n\nThe iDrive infotainment system uses the latest version of BMW’s operating system, which the automaker says offers more modern graphics along with a cleaner-looking start screen and more intuitive operation. It can be controlled via the touchscreen, voice commands, steering wheel buttons and on the center console; gesture control functionality is optional, a reversal from its swift purging recently from the BMW lineup.\n\nOne new feature is an in-car gaming system via the AirConsole gaming platform. According to the automaker, the driver and passengers can stream content or play video games while the vehicle is stationary via a smartphone connection to the infotainment system. Games currently available include racing, sports and quiz games as well as simulation, strategy, jump-and-run and puzzle games, and BMW says the content will be continuously expanded.\n\nIn back, the rear seat folds in a 40/20/40 split, and trunk capacity is greater. According to BMW’s measurements, the i5 has 17.3 cubic feet of storage, while the 530i has 18.4 cubic feet, up from 2023’s 14.5 cubic feet.\n\nPerforated Veganza imitation leather is available for the 5 Series’ seats and surfaces; Merino leather upholstery in several colors is an option. Other options include a giant panoramic Sky Lounge that BMW says has a viewing area almost 90% larger than that of the standard tilt-and-slide moonroof.\n\nPowertrain Specs\n\nThe big news is the addition of the all-electric i5 eDrive40 and i5 M60. The rear-wheel-drive i5 eDrive40 uses an electric motor at the rear axle for a maximum power output of 335 horsepower and maximum torque of 295 pounds-feet or 317 pounds-feet when the Sport Boost or Launch Control functions are activated. BMW estimates its range at 295 miles with the model’s standard 19-inch wheels and says the model will sprint from 0-60 mph in 5.7 seconds. The performance-oriented all-wheel-drive i5 M60 variant adds a motor at the front axle that produces 257 hp for a total system output of 593 hp and 586 pounds-feet of torque (605 pounds-feet when M Sport Boost or the M Launch Control function is activated). BMW says the M60 sprints from 0-60 in 3.7 seconds and has an estimated range of 256 miles.\n\nThe models use a lithium-ion battery pack good for 84.3 kilowatt-hours and have a charging unit that enables Level 2 AC charging up to 11 kilowatts with a 205-kW max charging rate. According to the automaker, when connected to a DC fast charger, the battery can be topped up from 10% to 80% in about 30 minutes. First-time owners receive two years of complimentary 30-minute charging sessions at Electrify America DC fast-charging locations.\n\nFor 2024, 530i variants use a new generation of BMW’s turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-four-cylinder. For 2024, it makes 255 hp and 295 pounds-feet of torque, increases of 7 hp and 38 pounds-feet, respectively. It’s paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission.\n\nThe 540i xDrive also returns to the lineup. It again uses a twin-turbo 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder good for a maximum output of 375 hp, an increase of 40 hp over the previous generation. The engine’s maximum torque increases by 52 pounds-feet to 384 and can be boosted to 398 pounds-feet with the additional power of the 48-volt mild-hybrid system. BMW says it can accelerate from 0-60 in a scant 4.5 seconds. The automaker also said the 550e xDrive plug-in hybrid will join the lineup in the summer of 2024.\n\nSafety\n\nStandard safety systems include park assist, forward automatic emergency braking, lane departure steering assist, blind spot warning, rear cross-traffic alert with braking intervention, speed limit sign recognition and a safe exit assist. The optional Driving Assistance Professional Package includes a new feature, Highway Assistant. The system enables hands-free driving at speeds up to 85 mph where conditions and speed limits allow. The driver’s attention is continuously monitored by the system via an interior camera. It also uses a new feature BMW claims is a world first called Active Lane Change with eye activation: When the vehicle suggests a lane change, the driver can confirm it simply by looking in the corresponding outside rearview mirror.\n\nPricing and Release Date\n\nThe 2024 BMW 5 Series and i5 are on sale now.. Trim level pricing is as follows (all prices include destination fees):\n\n530i: $58,895 (an increase of $1,900)\n530i xDrive: $61,195 (an increase of 1,900)\ni5 eDrive40: $67,795\ni5 M60 xDrive: $85,095\n540i xDrive: $65,895 (a decrease of $300)\n\nEditor’s note: This story was updated Feb. 6, 2024, to revise specs and update the on-sale date.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nMore From Cars.com\n\n2021 BMW M5: Updates for the Ultimate 5 Series\n2021 BMW 540i M Sport Review: Light on Sport, Heavy on Tech\nIIHS: 2022-23 BMW 5 Series, X3 Upgraded to Top Safety Pick Plus\nMore BMW News\nFind Your Next Car\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nA high-performance M5 sedan joins the 5 Series lineup, giving BMW a direct rival for the Mercedes-Benz E55, a muscle-car version of the E-Class sedan. The M5 returns to the United States after a seven-year hiatus.\n\nBesides the M5, the 5 Series lineup includes the six-cylinder 528i and V-8 540i, both of which come as sedans and station wagons.\n\nExterior\nThe M5’s visual distinctions from other 5 Series sedans include a larger air scoop and oval fog lamps in the front air dam, four exhaust pipes at the rear and 18-inch tires mounted on wheels with a chrome satin finish.\n\nAt 188 inches overall, the 5 Series sedan is about an inch shorter than the E-Class and nearly 9 inches shorter than the Lexus LS400. All three have rear-wheel drive.\n\nInterior\nAll models come with front bucket seats with 10-way power adjustments, automatic climate control and a power tilt/telescopic steering column. Leather upholstery is standard on the 540i and M5 and optional on the 528i. A split, folding rear seatback is optional on all.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe M5 comes with a 400-horsepower 5.0-liter V-8 engine and a six-speed manual transmission only. To help owners manage all that power, BMW throws in a free driver-training course at its new Performance Center next to the Spartanburg, S.C., plant where the Z3 and X5 are built.\n\nA 193-horsepower 2.8-liter inline six-cylinder powers the 528i and is available with a five-speed manual or new five-speed automatic transmission. The 540i has a 4.4-liter V-8 with 282 horsepower and comes with either a six-speed manual or five-speed automatic. In a switch from usual pricing practices, the 540i costs more with manual than automatic ($54,470 versus $51,670).\n\nSafety\nAll models have two-stage front airbags whose deployment force depends on crash severity and whether the occupants are buckled, side-impact airbags for the front seats, and the Head Protection system  a tubular side airbag that deploys from the roof liner to protect front-seat occupants. Rear side-impact airbags are optional.\n\nBMW’s Head Protection System uses a tubular airbag to protect a front-seat occupant from hitting the side window.\n\n\nTraction control, an anti-skid system called Dynamic Stability Control and anti-lock brakes are standard.\n\nPerformance\nThe six-cylinder 528i offers most of the features and the same quality as the 540i at a considerably lower price but lacks the spirited performance one might expect from a $40,000 luxury car.\n\n \n\nReported by Rick Popely  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2000 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "If F. Scott Fitzgerald were writing The Great Gatsby today instead of the 1920s, he surely would have put the wealthy, yet tragically flawed main character, Jay Gatsby, in the BMW 540i Sport. At $55,170, it’s truly the plaything of the rich and famous – and brainless, says Anita.\n\nHe: You know, sometimes you drive me crazy, Miss Daisy. This is truly one of the finest cars we’ve driven in the past year, and all you do is complain, complain, complain. Virtually everything about the 540i is so exceptional – from its superb twin-cam 4.4-liter V-8 to one of the world’s great touring suspensions – about the only thing you can criticize is how relevant or useful this BMW may be on American roads.\n\nShe: You mean, to American women. I was reminded of feminist Gloria Steinem as I drove the BMW for miles and miles on the freeways in Michigan, never ever finding the need to shift into the sixth gear. Gloria said, “A woman needs a man like a fish needs a bicycle.” I think a woman needs a six-speed like she needs a … well, you know.\n\nHe: This is coming from a woman who still owns the three-speed bicycle that she got in the fifth grade. A bicycle, I might add, that no self-respecting fish would be seen on. How can you fault a car with such incredible road-holding ability, with such sensational performance and with such an impressive array of safety features? The 5 series this year offers BMW’s new inflatable Head Protection System, which cushions and protects your head in a side impact. This is in addition to standard side air bags for front passengers and optional side bags in the rear.\n\nShe: I wish it came with an optional bag you could cover it with when you parked. The arctic silver test car we drove just looked like it was dripping with status, so much so that I felt funny parking it in most urban settings. I realize that’s a cultural problem, not a car problem, but it’s something that women think of when they make purchase decisions. It’s why those vanilla Toyota Camrys are so popular with us. They allow us to fly beneath the radar of a lot of troublemakers.\n\nHe: How do you explain all those women driving vanilla Lincoln Navigators? And while we’re on the subject of six-speeds, the extra top gear actually makes sense in the BMW. Use it at freeway speeds, and you’ll notice a marked improvement in gas mileage. The EPA rates the 540i at 15 mpg in city driving, which makes it subject to a $1,300 gas-guzzler penalty. However, on the highway, you can expect to get 24-25 mpg because the engine and transmission are so efficient at high speeds.\n\nShe: I know the 540i comes with lots of goodies, such as automatic climate control with zones for driver and passenger, and power windows with one-touch up and down on all four windows. But you can get nearly the same features on a Cadillac Seville STS, which costs only $47,000 and you won’t pay a guzzler tax. My problem with the 540i is that you are paying a premium for the BMW name.\n\nHe: Exactly. What do you think the attraction is to many people? That BMW name typifies world-class performance and quality. Let’s face it. This is a benchmark car, with few peers. The new Lexus GS 400 gives it a run for the money, but lacks the BMW cachet. A Jaguar XJ8 may look prettier, but if you do lots of high-speed driving every day – and you really love to drive – I think you’re going to prefer the BMW.\n\nShe: We drove the Sport version, which includes a firmer suspension, 17-inch wheels and tires, fancy seats and something BMW calls the Shadowline trim package, with matte-black window frames, door sills and bumper strips. I wish we would have had the “Security Car” version of the 540i, which is available as a special order vehicle. BMW refers to this as a “light-armored” vehicle, with Aramid-fiber layers in the doors, roof and rear deck, plus bulletproof glass, run-flat tires and a special communications system. Now that makes more sense to me than ix speeds.\n\nHe: So if Fitzgerald were to follow Steinem’s advice, would he have put Gatsby in a BMW – or would you prefer Jay walking?\n\n1998 BMW 540i Sport\n\nType: Front-engine, rear-wheel drive, five-passenger luxury/sport sedan\n\nPrice: Base, $53,300; as tested, $55,170 (including $570 destination charge and $1,300 gas-guzzler tax)\n\nWhat’s new for ’98: Head air bags, optional rear-seat side bags\n\nEngine: 4.4-liter V-8; 282 hp at 5,700 rpm; 310 lb-ft torque at 3,900 rpm\n\nTransmission: Six-speed manual\n\nEPA fuel economy: 15 mpg city/24 mpg highway\n\nStandard equipment:\n\nFour-wheel power disc brakes\n\nSpeed-sensitive power steering\n\n12-month insurance cost, according to AAA Michigan: $1,741.\n\nRates based on an average family of four from the Livonia area whose primary driver is aged 40 with no tickets who drives 3-10 miles each way to work. Rates reflect multicar discount and, where appropriate, discounts for air bags and seat belts.\n\nWhere built: Dingolfing, Germany",

      "expert_review": "Let’s make the point by word association: station wagon.\n\nWebster’s–barely able to cork its enthusiasm–says it’s an automobile with more cargo space than a comparable sedan, plus a rear seat that folds flat and a rear door hinged at any of four sides.\n\nLet’s get serious. Station wagon:\n\n* Yards of tin stamped and painted to look like hickory ribs riveted to mahogany paneling. Given enough acid rain, the look matures to shelf paper around an Altoids box. After two seasons, your Young Woodie looks like Old Ironsides.\n\n* Twenty-seven children practicing handstands, two dogs and Mom, all waiting in line at Taco Bell. The woman is weeping, and one of the Labs is chewing on her cell phone.\n\n* Station wagons are cemented in memory as June Allyson, Doris Day or Jennifer Jones, waiting to meet Gig Young, Gregory Peck or Howard Duff, arriving on the 5:10 to Milford, Conn. A martini before your meatloaf, dear?\n\n* They most certainly were Country Squire, Parklane, Estate Wagon, Villager, Colony Park and other names bearing nuances of horse manure and penthouses.\n\nSo where does the 1999 BMW 540i station wagon fit this history? It doesn’t, except as a magnificent anomaly that flattens all our perceptions: that no mandate exists saying an automobile with more cargo space than a comparable sedan, plus a square bum and roof rails, can’t play on the same street with Jaguars, Plymouth Prowlers, Aston Martins and up-market roadsters. Up to and including, at least in matters of initial acceleration, the Porsche Boxster roadster.\n\nDespite its apron and slippers, the BMW is America’s fastest station wagon. If not for a speed-setting governor that restricts it to 135 mph, the 540i would be the world’s fastest station wagon.\n\nThe 540i wagon may look as though it has a performance envelope that includes six bags of ballast from Gelson’s, but from standstill it hammers to 60 mph in a blink over six seconds. That’s faster than the Mercedes-Benz SLK230 Sport five-speed and a clean match for the frighteningly quick Lexus GS400.\n\nIt is certainly the only wagon since Country Squires and Colony Parks went away that has a 4.4-liter V-8 engine. It also is the only mover of things large and lumpy that offers 282 horsepower and 324 foot-pounds of torque. Surprisingly close to power numbers you get from a Corvette.\n\n*\n\nYet there’s nothing uncouth about this wolf in perambulator clothing. Linings that aren’t glove leather are baby-soft velour. The dashboard is trimmed in Vavona redwood. All the BMW quality, luxury and suburban accessories are in place: a cover to hide cargo, a self-leveling rear suspension for working weekends, luggage nets, tote tie-downs, sunshades for rear windows, even a loading floor that doubles as a Veuve Cliquot table for the most elegant of waterside picnics.\n\nBut what’s this with low-profile, high-performance tires on 17-inch wheels and brake rotors the size of Hula-Hoops staring through the spokes? Trained eyes w ill lock onto maroon and blue stitching around the three-spoke steering wheel, with an “M” badge buried in the rim. It says the gig is up and that this station wagon has been given large gobs of BMW’s famed Motorsports treatment.\n\nNot the Full Monty, mind you. Not full-blown M-Series engine enhancements. But certainly most of the modifications, including a sport suspension with firmer springs and shock absorbers. Ride height–and in turn the 540i’s center of gravity–has been dropped almost one inch.\n\nWith that almighty V-8, with a five-speed automatic transmission incorporating a manual sequential shifter, with stiffened suspension adding Super Glue to the car’s cornering talents, it’s all more than enough to create a rapid, silky machine capable of sly performance ranging from docile to mildly demonic. Such potential for absolute deception may even be worth its $55,000 sticker.\n\n*\n\nOf course, there will be public pondering of the purpose of a high-perform ance station wag on. It’s a contradiction of terms, and a confounding of design and concept. But maybe the fun element is quite enough.\n\nFor mothers who once saw the station wagon as a form of domestic relegation, the 540i will have them feeling they are romancing a hunk. For us hunks, there’s much wicked pleasure in watching drivers of Mustang GTs and V-10 Dodge Rams thoroughly bemused by having their clocks cleaned by a station wagon.\n\nEspecially if Mom is driving.",

      "expert_review": "Get you where you want to go quickly yet nimbly thanks to engines and suspension systems designed to complement one another.\n\nNot machines for everyone, however. There’s a price to pay for being able to motor aggressively, the primary one being suspensions tuned to force the vehicles to sit flat in corners and turns for agile handling, but in doing so sacrifice a cushioned ride. If the backside is tender, visit the Mercedes store.\n\nA combination of firm sports-tuned suspensions and firm, actually too firm, seats with rib-poking side bolsters are designed for those whose goal is to drive rather than ride. Though as we’ve said numerous times, a little more padding in the bottoms, a little wider bolsters on the sides, and you still could put a BMW through its paces without punishing the passengers.\n\nBut no need to pick on BMW. It isn’t the German that messed up Chrysler.\n\nSo let’s look at the trio we tested separately, starting with the new for 2001 330i sedan, the 3-liter, 225-horsepower inline 6-cylinder replacement for the 2.8-liter, 193-h.p. model.\n\nSo what makes the 330i stand out from the 328i?\n\n“More oomph,” the folks from BMW boast, which isn’t exactly a high-tech term but gets the message across.\n\nIf you want to drive even more aggressively and have a car with all-season capabilities, all-wheel-drive is available in the 3-Series for 2001 as well, the 330xi.\n\nNoteworthy is the fact that while the 3-liter provides a sharp horsepower boost over the 2.8, the mileage rating is a most impressive 21 m.p.g. city/30 m.p.g. highway. Our test vehicle came with the fairly smooth 5-speed manual, which is ideal at playtime and when the roads are covered with snow and you downshift to help braking, but less than ideal at rush hour.\n\nThe 330i starts at $33,990, but quickly swells when you add the necessary goodies, such as the $1,200 sport package with its sport suspension and performance radials, $1,050 power moonroof and $945 power front seats.\n\nNext up was the 540i sport wagon, which we didn’t look forward to because it is, after all, a station wagon whether it has kidney-shaped grille work or not.\n\nBut, as BMW beams, “the 540i sport wagon is the fastest station wagon in the world,” an accomplishment that would be more appealing if there were more than six station wagons left in the world.\n\nOnce you press the pedal to activate the 4.4-liter, 282-h.p., 32-valve V-8, you forget whether the vehicle is a wagon, sedan, coupe or truck and sit back and enjoy how lively the machine is.\n\nAnd the sport suspension, while firm, keeps the radials planted solidly on the pavement no matter which direction you point the wheel.\n\nAnd when you need to haul luggage or golf clubs, the cargo hold does come in handy.\n\nNew for 2001 are the front end and headlamp treatment, or what BMW calls a “discretely freshened” appearance, plus a new wider screen navigati on system. Though if BMW insists cupholders are purely decoration, then we insist a navigation system is strictly for show. When enjoying the spirit of the 282-h.p. V-8, does it really matter knowing where you are going, much less where you have been? If you need directions, visit the Mercedes showroom.\n\nBase price is $53,480, which means the 540i sport wagon is not only the world’s fastest wagon, but also one of the world’s most expensive, though you’ll never find that mentioned in BMW sales brochures.\n\nIn addition to the high price, you’ll have to add $2,800 for the sport package, plus $1,300 for the gas-guzzler tax because the 4.4-liter V-8 is rated at only 15 m.p.g. city/20 m.p.g. highway.\n\nFor that kind of money you could buy a sports car, the Corvette, rather than a wagon wannabe, or, if you wait a few years, for that kind of money you could buy DaimlerChrysler.\n\nBut we digress.\n\nThe BMW X5 sport-ute is somewhat a contradiction to what has een noted above about performance in BMWs.\n\nNot that the X5 is a slouch by any measure, but for 2001 a new version has been added powered by the 3-liter 225-h.p. inline 6 to offer a lower-cost choice from the 4.4-liter, 282-h.p. V-8 version that had been offered only until now.\n\nThe 3-liter, however, is rated only at 15 m.p.g. city/20 m.p.g. highway, so obviously its function at BMW is to attract buyers based on low cost, not high mileage. While the X5 carries the same mileage rating as the sport wagon, it escapes a gas-guzzler tax because it is classified as a truck with the government, which makes it exempt from guzzler penalties.\n\nThe 3-liter X5 starts at $39,470, or $10,500 less than the $49,970 V-8 version. BMW says since adding the 6 and the $10,000 price spread, X5 sales have tripled each month this year from last with only the V-8. Take note that a higher-performance or obviously higher-priced X5 powered by a 4.6-liter, 350-h.p.V-8 will be added this fall.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause BMW doesn’t want all those folks we’ve directed over to the Mercedes stores to spot the high-performance ML55 AMG. So the X5 will be added to give the ML55 AMG (Transportation, Feb. 18) a rival.\n\nThe 3-liter 6 X5 comes with a 5-speed manual not offered with the V-8. How many BMW loyalists will opt for a 5-speed sport-ute? BMW says less than 10 percent, but those 10 percent are worthy of special attention.\n\nHave to admit that while a 5-speed X5 didn’t sound that appealing when it arrived, it didn’t take long to realize it allows every one of those 225 horses to perform up to potential. Lot of fun and handy on snowy roads for braking or off-road for climbing and maneuvering. But, again, nice for playtime, a bit annoying at rush hour.\n\nAs noted, the X5 with 3-liter starts at $38,900, and you must add $2,470 for the sports package and all its goodies, which include 18-inch performance tires.\n\nOne gripe. BMW made a concession to the lowly masses by adding a pair of cupholders, providing you can find them. To do so, turn the X5 over on its roof and … oops. Sorry, there is a somewhat easier way. Slide back the cover on the cellphone holder in the center console (if you do without the navigation system you have to have a place to hold the phone so you can call for directions), lift out the rubber cellphone holder and you expose what BMW calls “beverage receptacles.”\n\nLike the 540 sport wagon, the X5 has plenty of room in the cargo hold to store valuables such as golf clubs or junk such as groceries.\n\nThe X5 will be joined in 2004 by a smaller Toyota RAV4-size AWD sport-ute now dubbed the X3. That’s the same time as the expected appearance of a new small rear-wheel-drive, entry-level 1-Series model priced at less than the 3-Series, which now starts at about $27,000.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nIts been said that designers are at work on the next generation of BMWs midlevel sedan and wagon, but the launch of those models is a couple years down the line. For 2002, the Sport Premium and Convenience option packages are gone, and an in-dash CD player is newly standard. The 5 Series fits between BMWs smaller 3 Series and its flagship 7 Series sedan.\n\nThe 5 Series appearance was freshened for 2001. Base models equipped with a 2.5-liter inline-six-cylinder engine are called 525i, while those fitted with a larger 3.0-liter inline-six are designated 530i. The 4.4-liter V-8 that powers the 540i sedan and wagon was given a boost this year to 290 horsepower. All 5 Series models are rear-drive, have side-impact airbags for the front seats and come with a curtain-type Head Protection System. Side-impact airbags for the rear seats are optional.\n\nThe high-performance M5 sedan, which is fitted with a 394-hp, 5.0-liter V-8 engine and a six-speed-manual gearbox, also is available. Other 5 Series models may be equipped with either a manual or automatic transmission.\n\nExterior\nWith a 111.4-inch wheelbase, the 5 Series fits into the full-size category by cars.com standards, though some observers consider it a midsize model. At 188 inches long overall, the 5 Series is slightly shorter than the Mercedes-Benz E-Class sedan and nearly 9 inches shorter than the Lexus LS 430. In appearance, the 5 Series closely resembles its smaller and larger mates, all of which sport BMWs familiar twin-kidney grille.\n\nInterior\nSeating is provided for five occupants. Front bucket seats have 10-way power adjustment for the driver. Standard equipment on all models includes remote keyless entry, a 10-speaker audio system, a power tilt/telescoping steering column, heated power mirrors and an alarm. The 540i sedan adds such extras as a moonroof, dual-mode automatic air conditioning and xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights.\n\nLeather upholstery is standard in the 540i and optional in the 525i and 530i, which otherwise come with standard imitation-leather seating. All models can be equipped with an optional split, folding rear seatback and BMWs navigation system.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe 525i uses a 184-hp, 2.5-liter inline-six-cylinder engine, while a 225-hp, 3.0-liter inline-six goes into the 530i. Topping the regular lineup, the 540i gets a 4.4-liter V-8 that now produces 290 hp  8 hp more than last years engine. Six-cylinder models are available with either a five-speed-automatic or five-speed-manual transmission. The 540i comes with a five-speed-automatic or six-speed-manual transmission.\n\nThe 540i actually costs more when fitted with a manual shift than with the automatic, but stick-shift versions come with a Sport Package that includes 17-inch tires and a tauter suspension. All 5 Series models are rear-drive only, unlike the smaller 3 Series, which offers all-wheel drive as an option.\n\nSafety\nDual-stage front airbags deploy according to crash severity and whether occupants are buckled up. Side-impact airbags for the front seats and BMWs Head Protection System  which consists of curtain-type airbags that deploy to protect front-seat occupants  are standard. Side-impact airbags and head-protection curtains are optional for the rear seats. Standard safety features include antilock brakes, traction control and an electronic stability system that BMW calls Dynamic Stability Control. The optional Park Distance Control detects obstacles to the front and rear of the car while parking it.\n\nDriving Impressions\nBMW manages to mix big doses of both sport and luxury in the 5 Series models. Drivers can expect the precise maneuverability and control of a 3 Series, coupled with quite a few luxuries near the level of the big 7 Series. Although suspensions are undeniably firm, especially if the sedan is fitted with a Sport Package, ride comfort remains pleasant over most pavement surfaces.\n\nPerformance is reasonably energetic even with the smallest six-cylinder engine, but the V-8 unleashes a veritable torrent of strength for supremely confident highway operation. BMW appears to strive for symmetry in each of its models, so the dashboard and its easy-to-read gauges look about the same, regardless of the size of the sedan.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com;\nFrom the cars.com 2002 Buying Guide;\nPosted on 11/28/01",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle OverviewA 4.4-liter V-8 engine provides the power for the strongest member of BMWs midlevel 5 Series family. Although they look virtually identical, the 525i and 530i sedans use inline-six-cylinder engines and the high-performance M5 sedan gets a larger, extra-potent V-8.\n    For 2003, BMWs Head Protection System for rear passengers becomes standard. A new Sport Package, which is standard on the sedans, is equipped with the six-speed-manual shift; this addition includes front and rear spoilers, black side moldings, an M-type suspension II, a black roof liner, an M-type footrest, 18-inch wheels and visible exhaust pipes. Titanium rings go around the gauges in the instrument panel. BMWs optional navigation system has been upgraded to DVD-based operation.\n   All 5 Series models are rear-wheel drive, unlike the 3 Series sedans, which may be equipped with all-wheel drive.\n  Like its 325xi twin, BMWs 540 wagons competes primarily against other European-brand luxury wagons from Audi, Mercedes-Benz, Saab and Volvo.\n  Exterior  The 540i rides a 111.4-inch wheelbase. Even though they seem more like midsize models, which is how cars.com classifies them, the 540 models fits into the compact-car category according to interior-volume standards by the Environmental Protection Agency. Measuring approximately 188 inches long overall, the 540i is nearly 9 inches shorter than the Lexus LS 430. In appearance, each 5 Series sedan closely resembles its smaller and larger mates, all of which sport BMWs familiar twin-kidney grille. The 540i sedan has a standard moonroof and xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights.\n  From the front doors forward, the 540 wagons look identical to BMWs 5 Series sedans. In overall appearance, they resemble the companys smaller 3 Series and larger 7 Series, led by the familiar twin-kidney grille thats been a BMW hallmark.\n  Interior  A wood-trimmed interior and seating for five occupants is provided. Upholstered in leather, the front bucket seats have 10-way power adjustment for the driver. Standard equipment on all 540 models includes rain-sensing wipers, dual-mode automatic air conditioning, remote keyless entry, a 10-speaker audio system with a CD player, a power tilt/telescoping steering column, heated power mirrors and an alarm. Sedans can be equipped with an optional split, folding rear seatback and BMWs navigation system.\n  The 540 wagon includes dual-zone automatic air conditioning, heated power mirrors with a memory feature, a CD stereo, a power tilt/telescoping steering column, keyless entry, a central locking system, a split, folding rear seat and a retractable rear cargo cover. Cargo volume behind the rear seat totals 32.7 cubic feet, but folding the backseat increases space to 65.2 cubic feet.\n  Under the Hood  Topping the regular 5 Series lineup, the 540i models get a a 4.4-liter V-8 engine that produces 290 horsepower. It teams with either a five-speed-automatic or six-speed-manual transmission. A manual shift actually costs more and is available as part of a Sport Package that includes a tauter suspension and 17-inch tires.\n  Safety  Dual-stage front airbags deploy according to crash severity and whether occupants are buckled up. Side-impact airbags for the front seats and BMWs Head Protection System  which consists of curtain-type airbags that deploy to protect front-seat occupants  are standard. Side-impact airbags are optional for the rear seats. Safety features include antilock brakes, traction control and BMWs Dynamic Stability Control system. Optional Park Distance Control detects obstacles to the front and rear of the car while parking.\n    Driving Impressions  Even more than in the less-expensive 525i and 530i models, BMW manages to blend big doses of both sport and luxury in the 540i. Drivers can expect the precise maneuverability and control of a 3 Series, coupled with a level of luxury that approaches that of the big 7 Series. The suspensions are undeniably firm, especially if the sedan is fitted with the Sport Package, but ride comfort remains pleasant over most pavement surfaces.\n  BMW manages to blend big doses of both sport and luxury in the 540i wagon.

The suspensions are undeniably firm, especially if a Sport Package is installed, but ride comfort remains pleasant over most pavement surfaces.\n  In all 540i models, the V-8 engine unleashes a veritable sea of strength to deliver supremely confident highway operation. Easy-to-read gauges follow the familiar BMW layout.\n \n\n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.comFrom the cars.com 2003 Buying GuidePosted on 12/18/02",

      "expert_review": "When it comes to a heavy dose of automotive Bavarian creme de la creme, few models satisfy like BMW’s new-for-’97 5-series.\n\nOh, sure. The Z-3’s have been grabbing all the headlines. But let’s face it, unless you’re James Bond — or Pierce Brosnan, for that matter — you probably can’t find one at your local dealer at a sane price anyway.\n\nJust because the 5-series is a four-door sedan doesn’t mean it’s dull as dishwater. This is a BMW, after all, and that means sports sedan.\n\nTo get the most out of the new car, BMW went to work to make the structure more rigid. They enlarged the passenger compartment and made it more resistant to crashes. The front and rear suspensions were revised, and now ride on aluminum subframes. The steering is still a recirculating-ball type, but it transmits less road shock to the driver than rack-and-pinion, which the Mercedes E-Class has adapted.\n\nAll this is meant to handle the power coming from either a new 2.8-liter 190-horsepower double-overhead-cam six-cylinder or a 4.4-liter 282-horsepower double-overhead-cam V-8.\n\nThe six has sufficient power to motivate this sedan. It’s smooth and quiet, with enough reserve to make things moderately interesting. It is subtle.\n\nThe V-8 is much more responsive, and in many respects wakes this car up. The effect is overindulgent, serving up 310 foot-pounds of torque at 3,900 rpm. This makes spirited driving easy to dial up. The V-8 is more appropriate for a car of this stature than the six, but both are sophisticated and silent.\n\nThe willing chassis has BMW’s sporty, sure-footed feel. With typical Bavarian attitude, this road car takes no prisoners, charging down the autobahn … er … interstate without missing a beat. The car is much more fun to drive than the comparable Mercedes, thanks mostly to steering and suspension that are tuned more for sport than comfort. If a pillowy ride is your idea of nirvana, look elsewhere.\n\nBrakes are discs at all corners with anti-lock. Their stopping ability is of the swift, silent type.\n\nAt 288 inches, the car is just about the right length. Although some competitors have more room inside, none matches this car’s road-going poise. But while inside, you’ll find the usual array of luxury and convenience features buyers in this stratosphere expect.\n\nAll four power windows are one-touch power up and down units. There’s a multi-function onboard computer, power tilt-telescoping steering wheel and — well, I could go on. But the image of the BMW as a stark driver’s car isn’t really accurate. There are enough power gimmicks here to challenge any car from Detroit or Tokyo.\n\nThe 10-way power driver’s throne is really comfortable, if somewhat stiff. It allows for long, relaxed stints behind the wheel.\n\nWhen you’re not too busy tearing up the twisties, you’ll appreciate the fine audio system that BMW fits to these cars. Standard is a 10-speaker 200-watt audio system. Optional is a 12-speaker, 440-watt system with Digital Sound Processing. (That means you make Kurt Cobain sound like he’s singing in a jazz club).\n\nIn either case, the radio forms part of the control center for the onboard computer and cellular phone, meaning it won’t fit into other models, lessening its chance of being stolen. A trunk-mounted CD changer is available. Steering-wheel-mounted controls for the audio system and phone, available on the 540, are useful.\n\nSafety is pretty typical of this league as well, with dual front air bags, anti-lock brakes and side-impact air bags as well. Traction control is standard.\n\nThe only down note — one that has always irked me — is that, on the 528, leather is an option (it’s standard on the pricier 540). The leatherette seems inappropriate for this league. Ditto some of the hard plastic that decorates the dash. But otherwise, there’s little to fault here.\n\nThe 5-series BMWs are in some ways BMW’s best cars. Sized r ght, with plenty of power and ability, they are the very definition of what a sports sedan should be.\n\nWhat price for all this goodness? The 528i starts at a reasonable $38,900. But for that price, leather is an option, along with such goodies as the onboard trip computer, seat heaters, premium sound system and power moon roof. The 540i automatic starts at $49,900. The moon roof is standard, but some prime features are still extra. If you’d like your 540i with the six-speed manual, the tariff is higher. Base price is $52,350, plus a $1,300 gas guzzler tax that doesn’t apply to the automatic models.\n\nBut if you’re looking in this league, it’s hard to resist the siren call of these Bavarian sweethearts.",

      "expert_review": "It’s sad when something isn’t as good as you remember it to be. Like a familiar restaurant that no longer makes your favorite dish or a favorite musician who can’t quite hit all their notes in concert anymore.\n\nThat’s how I feel after spending a week with not one but two BMW 5 Series sedans, the 2017 BMW 540i and 530i xDrive. Make no mistake: These are fine automobiles, nicer inside than they’ve ever been and chock-full of amazing technology (some useful, some silly). They’re powerful, efficient, quick and smooth. But they’ve most assuredly lost the mojo that used to make BMWs sing in the hands of enthusiast drivers. In a quest to chase sales, BMW has made its products increasingly appealing to a broader audience — and sales have responded. But while the brand’s advertising is still chasing enthusiasts, some of the products themselves no longer reflect their tagline: “Ultimate Driving Machine.”\n\nGood Looks Remain\n\nThe new 5 Series has received a freshening, but it’s starting to suffer from an affliction affecting most of BMW’s lineup: a lack of fresh ideas. Lately, one generation of BMW products blends into previous generations. Is this a 2017? A 2015? A 2012? Can you really tell anymore? At least it’s still attractive, with sleek LED headlights, thick haunches and aerodynamic styling, and there are still vestiges of characteristic BMW styling elements, like the twin-kidney grille and unique C-pillar design. But it looks more “now” than “new.”\n\nBMW’s Nicest Interior Yet\n\nInside is where the upgrades are most noticeable. BMW has been rightfully stung lately by the astonishing luxury and quality of Mercedes-Benz interiors, even in its entry-level models, and has responded with aplomb. The 2017 5 Series’ cockpit is considerably better than the outgoing model’s, but its top trim level still falls just a hair short of the opulence of even a base Mercedes-Benz E-Class. It’s close enough these days that choosing one over the other comes down to a preference in style — do you like the unusual shower-drain speaker grilles on the Mercedes? Or do you prefer the cleaner lines of the BMW? It’s a win either way.\n\nSpace is not an issue, either, with plenty of room front and back. The front seats are very comfortable and highly adjustable, with available heating and ventilation. The backseat features acceptable legroom, with plenty of room for two people. Three will still find their legs cramped by the driveshaft tunnel in this rear-wheel-drive car, but the 5 Series’ width makes three abreast more pleasant than it’s been in recent years.\n\nOutward visibility is also good, with a reasonably low beltline that adds airy spaciousness to the cabin. Contrast this with the Mercedes-Benz E-Class, which has a high beltline that makes you feel like you’re sitting in a cocooning tub, and the BMW feels a little bigger inside.\n\nGadgets Galore\n\nBMW has focused on some pretty impressive technology, some of which is genuinely useful, some of which comes across as gimmicky and silly. The 530i features standard navigation and a 10.2-inch display screen with the latest iDrive multimedia control system. It’s come a long way from the initially difficult-to-use, multiple-menu system, and while it still buries some functions (like safety equipment activation) in these menus, it’s a lot easier to use than in previous years. Apple CarPlay is available, but it’s a $300 option.\n\nBMW offers a few new high-tech options, some astonishing, some not so helpful. On the genuinely useful side is the remote control parking function, which lets you stand outside the car and pull it into or out of a super-tight space that wouldn’t allow you to open the doors if you drove it in. On the less useful side is the rather silly gesture control for the multimedia system. Read more about these functions here.\n\nBut the Thrill Is Gone\n\nIf you’ve never driven a BMW before, you’ll fire up the 5 Series, take it for a spin and declare it to be an excellent luxury car. And let’s be clear about this: It is. It’s refined, it’s smooth, it’s quiet, it’s extremely well-insulated from the noise and harshness of the outside environment. It’s everything American buyers seek from a luxury brand like Lexus or Mercedes-Benz, and it’s one of the reasons BMW has been able to keep up with those two brands in sales for the past several years.\n\nThe complaints you’ll hear with the latest BMWs come from people who have been driving BMWs for 20 or 30 years: that they used to be enthusiast machines — vehicles made for people who love tight-handling, high-performing, European-flavored sports sedans and coupes. BMW’s advertising tagline, the “Ultimate Driving Machine,” has been around more than 40 years, and it once accurately described the brand’s cars. Not anymore.\n\nIt’s not a matter of powertrains. The base engine in the 530i is a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder making 248 horsepower and tied to a standard eight-speed automatic transmission. Step up to the 540i and you’ll get a 335-hp, twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder engine. Or you can go big and splurge for the M550i, which comes with a 456-hp, twin-turbo 4.4-liter V-8.\n    \nMy testing was limited to the first two models, the 530i xDrive (with all-wheel drive) and the 540i in rear-wheel-drive form. The four- and six-cylinder engines are wonderful, with plenty of usable torque to drive the car quickly off the line. Put them in Sport mode and things get even quicker, with throttle response changes that make both cars much more responsive to pedal inputs. The eight-speed transmission is well-matched to either engine, snapping off quick shifts with smooth precision and very little hunting for the appropriate gear regardless of your driving style.\n\nBoth cars also ride extremely well, with excellent body control and well-damped motions that effectively isolate the driver without feeling too floaty. But here’s where we start to see how far BMW has skewed from enthusiast drivers and into luxury territory. While the suspension is comfortable, it also does away with any communication to the driver about what the car is doing. The electric power steering is numb in a way that would have been unimaginable in a BMW 10 years ago. It transmits no feedback to the driver, and bumping the mode selector into Sport only increases the effort required, doing nothing about feel.\n\nThis numb handling and cushy ride effectively turn the 5 Series into any number of ordinary luxury cars, giving up its sportiness in the process. And while that may be great for the vast majority of buyers who prefer that kind of suppleness in their luxury car, enthusiast buyers now need to head over to Cadillac showrooms instead, where elements that used to make up BMW’s Ultimate Driving Machines are now firmly entrenched in European-style American sedans.\n\nFuel economy is above average for the field. The base 530i comes in at an EPA-estimated 24/34/27 mpg city/highway/combined, dropping to 23/33/27 mpg for the AWD xDrive model. The 540i does a little worse, at 20/30/24 mpg with rear-wheel drive and 20/29/23 with all-wheel drive. My testing turned in 26 mpg combined in the 530i xDrive and 22 mpg in the 540i, but both were driven primarily in the city and rather aggressively to boot.\n\nA Mercedes-Benz E300 sedan with its own turbo 2.0-liter engine returns an estimated 22/30/25 mpg — surprising given it has an extra gear — while the Cadillac CTS 2.0-liter gets the exact same results. The Audi A6 bests both with 24/34/28 mpg from its front-wheel-drive, 2.0-liter model.  Compare them all here.\n\nCargo Room\n\nThe BMW 530i xDrive has an above-average trunk volume specification of 18.7 cubic feet — sufficiently above average to make us suspect their measurement method. Mercedes-Benz claims 13.1 cubic feet for the E300, and Cadillac cites the CTS at 13.7. The Audi A6, a front-wheel-drive car with different packaging, claims 14.1 cubic feet of room. Given cargo measurements are equal parts scientific method and voodoo, it’s best to compare competitors for yourself.\n\nSafety in Spades, but It Will Cost You\n\nThe 5 Series earned top marks from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety in all crashworthiness and crash-avoidance testing. The car has not been tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nOne area where BMW has not skimped is optional safety equipment, but the functional word here is “optional.” In true German luxury car fashion, nearly all of the car’s more advanced safety features are optional. You get standard airbags and required antilock brakes and stability control, but everything else costs money — a lot of it. A backup camera, rear parking sensors and a head-up display are bundled into the Driving Assistance Package, which costs $1,800. Automatic parallel parking and 360-degree surround view cameras come in the Driving Assistance Plus Package for $1,400. If you want autonomous emergency braking, pedestrian detection, traffic jam assist and lane departure warning, there’s a Driving Assistance Plus II package for $1,700. That’s a lot of money considering some of these electronic safety features are pretty basic.\n\nIt Gets Really Expensive, Fast\n\nThe basic BMW 530i starts at $52,195 including destination fee, or $54,495 for the xDrive model. The bigger-engined 540i starts at $57,445. Prices climb quickly from there, however. My mostly loaded 530i xDrive included items like a cold weather package, two driving assistance packages, a lighting package, a luxury seating package and a premium package, plus stand-alone items like a power-close trunk, soft-close doors, ceramic controls and a premium Harman Kardon sound system; it rang in at $72,735. My 540i tester was even more expensive, adding things like a dynamic handling package, the M Sport package and a fancier Bowers & Wilkins audio system; it rang in at an eye-watering $82,610.\n\nCompeting vehicles are priced comparably. The latest Mercedes-Benz E-Class has a similar pricing scheme, starting at $53,075 for a four-cylinder E300 and quickly going north from there, with safety and electronic minder features all bundled in packages for quite a lot of money. Audi’s A6 isn’t quite so dear, starting at $48,550 and featuring front-wheel drive instead of the segment’s more common rear-wheel drive. The Cadillac CTS is the better-handling alternative, and it’s more economical, too, starting at $46,990 for the most-powerful four-cylinder turbo engine in the group.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2021 BMW 540i xDrive with M Sport Package is a little light on sport, but it has a good blend of driver-assist technology, interior quality and vibrant information screens. \n\nVersus the competition: The 5 Series doesn’t have the flash of its more recently redesigned competitors, but its technology and some interior qualities are among the best in the class. \n\nUpdates for 2021 keep BMW’s 5 Series mid-size sedan fresh, with enhancements to the infotainment system as well as a new 48-volt mild-hybrid system on 540i models, like the one I drove for this review. \n\nRelated: 2021 BMW 5 Series Is Feeling Refreshed\n\nRide and Handling\n\nAfter flashing back to the ride quality of the BMW 330i M Sport, I readied my back for a brutal two weeks in the M Sport version of the 540i. Thankfully, my anxiety turned out to be overblown; the 2021 540i M Sport is a much more sedate version of the sporty package than I found on the 3 Series. In fact, you’d be hard-pressed to tell the car I drove was riding on any kind of special suspension at all. \n\nI have to qualify all my ride and handling impressions in the 540i with the fact that my test car was equipped with winter tires. This type of rubber can make a car’s steering numb, its ride squishy and its handling not as sharp. (Not that I blame BMW for equipping the car this way; one week of my vehicle loan never got above 30 degrees, while the next week was above 60 degrees. That’s Chicago for ya.)\n\nThe M Sport Package lowers the 540’s ride height 0.4 inch, and my test car also had a $3,200 Dynamic Handling Package, which added active roll stabilization and dynamic damper control. This package didn’t give much of an edge or sharpness to the car, which was also equipped with optional variable sport steering. I didn’t observe much of a difference in body roll or steering feel when switching between the adjustable driving modes; even with this performance-focused technology, the 540i was never engaging to drive thanks to its numb steering feel and squishy handling. Again, the winter tires may have muddied the driving feel, but they were performance-oriented Pirelli Sottozero 3 winter tires. \n\nThe car had loads of grip even on damp roads where the all-wheel-drive system was unflappable; I could stab the gas pedal from a stop or fling the car around an uphill corner, and it would take it like it was on a dry road. \n\nAn upside of the 540i M Sport’s docile demeanor was its comfortable ride quality, though the winter tires were noisy. The BMW’s overall sedateness is in line with most of the class — with the exception of the Mercedes-AMG E53, though that car competes more with the twin-turbo V-8-powered BMW M550i. Compact luxury sports sedans in the class below the 540 are more tenacious handlers.\n\nEngine and Acceleration\n2021 BMW 540i M Sport | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nThe 540i is powered by a single-turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder engine making 335 horsepower and 332 pounds-feet of torque. BMW says the engine can propel the all-wheel-drive 540i xDrive from 0-60 mph in 4.6 seconds; with standard rear-wheel drive, it’s 4.9 seconds. \n\nThe six-cylinder engine and eight-speed automatic transmission are a harmonious pair — quiet and refined — but the overall experience is more luxury cruiser than performance sedan. Few sounds can be heard in the cabin other than an electronic engine augmentation; there’s no crackle of the exhaust or whooshing from the air intake. The 540i is one of those cars in which you can be hauling the mail at questionable speeds while feeling like you’re not doing a click over 40 mph — that’s how quiet and composed it is. \n\nThe new mild-hybrid system that’s standard in the 540i slightly boosts performance and fuel economy. The system consists of a 48-volt starter-generator motor and a second battery that accumulates energy to supply electricity to the lights, steering, power windows, climate-control system, audio system and heated seats. When sent back through the starter-generator motor, that stored energy can also boost the drive system with an extra 11 hp that BMW says helps off-the-line response and makes for quicker bursts of speed when accelerating. (Both Mercedes and Audi offer similar electrified systems in the E-Class and A6, respectively.)\n\nWill you notice 11 hp? Probably not, as it makes the car’s 0-60 time only a tenth of a second quicker, but the system as a whole is unobtrusive. Fuel-economy ratings are higher for 2021 — up 1 mpg combined, to 26 mpg, for the AWD 540i. Highway ratings are up 2 mpg, to 31 mpg, and city ratings are up 1 mpg, to 23 mpg. \n\nTechnology\n2021 BMW 540i M Sport infotainment system with Apple CarPlay | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nA new 12.3-inch touchscreen replaces the previous 10.25-inch screen in the middle of the 5 Series’ dash. The vibrancy and resolution of both the center touchscreen and the 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster make the displays some of the nicest ones to look at, with clear, easily readable text and a large implementation of Apple CarPlay that fills the entire screen — not a given on all large screens. Wireless CarPlay is standard, which is especially desirable as a parent, since I can give my phone to a whiny kid in the backseat and still use CarPlay (try that with a wired connection). One bummer, though, is that the car’s optional wireless charging feature isn’t as quick to replenish battery life as is a wired connection; my phone’s battery mostly just sustained its charge, or barely increased, while on the charging pad.\n\nThe touchscreen also displays some of the coolest augmented-reality graphics I’ve seen in a car, with 360-degree views that show the 5 Series’ surroundings. It’s a trip to see a superimposed car image surrounded by real-life camera views to help you gauge how close you are to things. It’s quite useful.\n\n2021 BMW 540i M Sport | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nUnlike some luxury automakers, BMW hasn’t done anything too stupid to hurt usability like making all the controls touch-sensitive or pairing a console controller with a non-touch display. All the 540’s controls are straightforward, though the iDrive onscreen interface remains a bit complicated even as its main features are easier to access than they were in previous versions. You’ll want to take that training walk-through at the dealership seriously and get familiar with the owner’s manual.\n\nInterior\n2021 BMW 540i M Sport | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nLast redesigned for the 2017 model year, the 5 Series’ interior design is showing its age compared with the more recently updated Audi A6 and Genesis G80, as well as the Mercedes-Benz E-Class, which has aged more gracefully since its 2017 redesign. Even so, while the 5 Series’ cabin looks more dated and restrained, its materials mostly remain competitive. The optional $2,500 mocha Nappa leather seating won’t be lost on your bottom or your nose; they’re plush and comfortable, and give off a welcoming new-car smell. When you turn into corners, the side bolster you’re thrust into inflates to keep you properly positioned (a feature that can be disabled, of course).\n\n2021 BMW 540i M Sport | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nThe sedan’s interior trim choices, however, could use some work. My M Sport had the Aluminum Rhombicle trim, and it looked a bit plasticky and fake, with a patterned texture rather than brushed aluminum or some other industrial metal look. There are available wood finishes, but they seem less appropriate for the sportier M Sport. \n\nThere’s no extra room in either the front seat or the back, but my 6-foot frame wasn’t cramped. This car is the definition of mid-size: not too big and not too small, slotting right between the 3 Series and 7 Series. The supple seating carries over to the back, where there’s intricate stitching and high-quality leather.\n\nHands-Free Driving\n2021 BMW 540i M Sport | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nBMW is one of the few automakers whose lawyers let them advertise its semi-autonomous driving system as hands-free. It is, and it works as such at speeds below 40 mph. When the car determines that you’re on an acceptable road, such as a freeway with lane markings and preceding traffic, and that the driver is paying attention, a secret menu pops up on the instrument panel. When it does, you can hit the Mode button one more time to enter hands-free driving, signified by the steering wheel’s LEDs turning green.\n\nI felt comfortable driving hands-free, but it’s not attention-free driving. My hands were still near the wheel, ready to take over, and I was on high alert monitoring other cars, because these kinds of systems can’t see everything. Fully autonomous cars are not yet for sale, and even Tesla’s Autopilot is a hands-on driving-assist system. The other advertised hands-free driving system is Cadillac’s Super Cruise, which works at low and high speeds. It, too, monitors whether the driver is paying attention. \n\nIts low-speed-only nature limits the BMW system’s use to heavy congestion situations, and it’s annoying when traffic is moving around that 40 mph mark and the system makes you jump in and out of hands-free driving. That said, if you live somewhere with awful congestion, the $1,700 Driving Assistance Plus Package with Extended Traffic Jam Assist is a must-have.\n\nBMW 5 Series: Should You Buy One? \n2021 BMW 540i M Sport | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nIf you’re looking for a sports sedan, you might want to keep looking (perhaps at a different class of cars) because the 540i xDrive with the M Sport Package doesn’t quite live up to its name — at least, not in the way the smaller 3 Series with the package does. This is especially true with winter tires. \n\nFor my money, I’d ditch the M Sport Package and all its suspension and performance-enhancing pieces and keep the plain old 540i luxury sedan. This is where it really excels, with its driver-assist technology, rich seating materials and high-quality displays.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The BMW 5 Series is entering the 2023 model year with some changes in packaging and increased prices as the German automaker’s large four-door sedan aims to stay fresh against a pool of rivals.\n\nRelated: 2021 BMW 5 Series Is Feeling Refreshed\n\nMost updates are found inside, with BMW reintroducing the Executive Package on the 530i, 530e, and 540i variants. The package adds heated front seats (heated rear seats are an extra $500), a head-up display, power-operated trunk, power rear sunshade and side curtains, remote engine start and a Harmon Kardon premium sound system. Additionally, the Premium Package now gets remote start, and the Parking Assistance Package is now only available on the M550i. BMW has removed gesture control from all variants.\n\nMeanwhile, the range-topping M5 loses six exterior colors but adds two new ones (San Remo Green metallic and Skyscraper Grey metallic). Its interior is once again available with the Individual Smoke White with Black Full Merino leather and Tartufo Full Merino leather. Gone is the Bowers & Wilkins Diamond Surround sound system.\n\nThe base 530i model is powered by a 248-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine; the 530e combines the 2.0-liter with an electric motor and a 12-kilowatt-hour battery to bump total system output up to 288 hp; the 540i gets a 335-hp, turbo 3.0-liter inline-six; the M550i xDrive gets a 523-hp, twin-turbo 4.4-liter V-8; and the M5 has a version of the 4.4-liter that makes 600 hp (617 hp with the Competition Package). All 5 Series come with a standard eight-speed automatic transmission. Rear-wheel drive is standard; all-wheel drive adds $2,300 to the price of the 530i, 530e and 540i, while the M550i and M5 get it standard.\n\nPricing and Release Date\n\nThe 2023 BMW 5 Series lineup is available now. Full pricing is below (all prices include the $995 destination charge; the M5 includes a $1,000 gas guzzler tax).\n\n530i: $56,995\n530e: $58,595\n540i: $63,895\nM550i: $82,495\nM5: $111,895\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2021 BMW M5: Updates for the Ultimate 5 Series\n2021 BMW 540i M Sport Review: Light on Sport, Heavy on Tech\nIIHS: 2022-23 BMW 5 Series, X3 Upgraded to Top Safety Pick Plus\nMore BMW News\nFind Your Next Car\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
