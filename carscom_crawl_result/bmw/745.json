      "expert_review": "The new flagship-series BMW is a magnificent machine, a veritable technological showcase presented in a car that’s great to drive and ride in. But applying the all-else-aside, nitty-gritty test: If I won the lottery, would I buy one? I have to answer no.\n\nNot that I don’t love big, luxurious sedans; au contraire, we’re made for each other. But either the Audi S8 or Mercedes-Benz S Series would get the job over the admittedly more technologically advanced 7.\n\nFor one reason only: That incredibly inept system they call iDrive, which relegates control of 8 discrete functions, such as radio, telephone, air conditioning, navigation system, to the direction of a console-mounted rotating knob and the LED screen generally used for navigation functions.\n\nProblem No. 1, and this is a biggie: It was impossible to see in daylight with sunglasses on.\n\nNo. 2: When I found suitably dark conditions so that I could read it, most of the functions were hard to figure out. Try finding your favorite FM station without recourse to the manual. I couldn’t.\n\nNo. 3: With but one function displayed at a time, it is dangerously distracting to peer at the screen and rotate the knob to select a new function, especially since the knob isn’t exactly intuitive as to which point of the compass it’s pointing at. Never mind that every time one starts up the car, one must promise, via an opening screen which requires an OK input, to not use the system while driving. I guess a co-pilot is a must – that, or frequent stops at the side of the road.\n\nLuckily the basic air conditioning controls – fan and temperature – were old-style knobs on the dash. Would that those for the stereo were, also.\n\n(End of rant, beginning of rave).\n\nThe new 7 Series is styled differently for North American and Asian markets than it is for the Continent. Our version is bigger-looking and a little more gingerbready.\n\nThere has been much controversy over what some perceive as un-BMW exterior styling, especially the rear portion. BMW says it has taken a revolutionary, rather than its customary evolutionary, approach.\n\nI have no quarrel with the exterior design; in fact I like the restraint, the whisper of class and quality rather than the clamor of gimmickry. It’s classic, and should wear well. Up close, the aero treatments are especially noticeable, emphasized by the extremely low-profile (for a big sedan) tires.\n\nInside, the car feels similarly opulent, in an old-money sort of way. Leather, wood, brushed stainless . . . all the right stuff. The tester’s matte-finished black cherry adornments were especially lovely, resembling suede more than wood.\n\nThe sample I tested was a 745Li, the long-wheel-base version. It is 203.5 inches overall, with 123.2 inches between axles. The standard version, the 745i, is 6 inches less in wheel-base and 5 inches less overall. (By the way, BMW mavens, that’s not a typo – last year’s version was called the 745iL – now, to subtly suggest a new car, they changed it to 745Li.)\n\nThe longer version would be my pick. For a few thousand more (hey, we’re talking rich folks), you get a bit more space in which the passengers can luxuriate; and believe me, people will be begging to ride in this mount. (The trunk holds four sets of golf clubs.)\n\nAs soon as the driver takes his place behind the tilt/telescope steering wheel, he encounters some innovations. There is no ignition key per se, rather an oblong micro-computer about the size of a conventional key fob. This is inserted and locked into an aperture in the dash. If the car’s computer recognizes it as the right one, it flashes an electronic greeting amid principal instruments and awaits commands. To start the car, one must put his foot on the brake pedal and push the start/stop button, right next to the aforementioned receptacle.\n\nThe transmission is a six-speed automatic, and its actuation is also unique. There’s a small lever on the steering column, shorter than a turn-signal controller, where a shifter would be. This one offers only Park, Reverse and Drive settings. A very light tug and movement up or down selects the direction.\n\nOops, don’t forget the parking brake. That is also electro-mechanical, controlled by a pushbutton or engaged automatically when the vehicle is put in Park. Its operation is virtually undetectable – a feature I hope we see lower down the food chain some day.\n\nA large car in this class can’t stumble over its own feet, and the 745Li sure doesn’t. It gets an all-new engine this year, still a 4.4-liter V-8 with 32 valves, but with some important differences that give it the power of the old V-12.\n\nYes, power jumps to 325 hp and torque is 330 foot-pounds, up from last season’s 282 and 324. The horsepower peaks at 6,100 rpm, so that’s of more significance to folks who drive the Autobahn. The increase in torque, however trifling, is welcome, especially since that measure of grunt is spread out over a wider range. This engine has not only infinitely-variable valve lift and timing, it also has a continuously-variable intake path that maximizes efficiency for responsiveness and better mileage.\n\nThe EPA rates this car at 18 mpg city, 26 highway, pretty good for an ultra-luxury machine, though BMW says the test understates the capability of its new transmission. I logged 21.3 overall, and must admit that more than once I played Autobahn. Premium fuel is mandated, of course.\n\nI found the big bad boy capable of leaping from a standstill to 60 mph in 6 seconds, a very impressive feat for a vehicle that curb weights at 4,464 pounds. Those who are in a bigger hurry will soon have a V-12 750Li.\n\nThe automatic transmission is reasonably smart, using the six ratios to good effect most of the time. But, this being a BMW, manual override is also possible via convenient switches on the steering wheel. The ratios are fairly close down low where it counts, and both fifth and sixth are overdrive cogs for easy cruising.\n\nAt legal speeds and well beyond, the 7 was hushed, thanks not only to the long-legged geartrain but also to the exceptionally low 0.29 coefficient of drag.\n\nRide quality was sporty, considerably firmer than I’d guess many luxury-car buyers would be happy with. For them, or really, for anyone who wants the ultimate system, BMW offers an “adaptive ride package” for $1,900, with infinitely-variable shocks.\n\nNeither feds nor insurance folks have crashed a 7 yet, but BMW says its internal simulations of their drills suggest it will garner top marks.\n\nI’ve touched on only the highest points of all the leading-edge wizardry available in this platform, but reserve my loudest praise for a more conventional apparatus, the braking system.\n\nThe discs are bigger this time out, and both pedal feel and stopping distances are extraordinary, as befits a car governed to 150 mph.\n\nThe tester’s base pr ice was $71,850. It had a premium sound package ($1,800), power-closing doors and trunk ($1,000), luxury seating package with ventilated heating/cooling seats front and rear ($1,600), custom alloy wheels ($1,300), power rear and side sunshades ($750) and parking distance sonar ($700).\n\nWith freight, the total for this breathtaking ride was $79,645. I have that much equity in my house . . . if only they’d revise that iDrive mess.\n\nPayments on that car would be $1,616, assuming 20 percent down, 10 percent interest and 48 coupons. Edmunds.com reports they are going for full retail, but then, in this segment, it’s so infra dig to ask for a discount.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nIntroduced during 2002, the fourth generation of BMW’s largest series comes in regular- and long-wheelbase forms as the 745i and 745Li, respectively. BMW also offers its full-size sedans with V-12 power as the 760i and 760Li.\n\nAdaptive headlights are standard for 2005; they move with the steering wheel to enhance night vision through curves. Offered as new options this year are a Rear Entertainment Package with an iDrive controller and six-DVD player, as well as Comfort Access, which features keyless entry, exit and operation. Park Distance Control is now standard.\n\nThe styling on these cars departs from BMW tradition, especially at the rear end. The innovative iDrive control system has drawn both praise and consternation; it places access to the most-used controls via a rotary-dial controller on the console. iDrive has sometimes been hailed as a high-tech wonder, but it’s also been denounced as a complicated and unnecessary technological achievement.\n\nBMW’s six-speed-automatic transmission operates with shift-by-wire technology and an unconventional electronic control system. An optional Adaptive Ride Package includes electronic damping control and a self-leveling rear suspension.\n\nExterior\nAvailable only with rear-wheel drive, the 7 Series comes in two sizes. The 745i rides a 117.7-inch wheelbase and measures 198 inches long overall. Its extended-length 745Li sibling gets a 123.2-inch wheelbase and stretches to 203.5 inches long overall.\n\nStyling elements follow BMW tradition and include the familiar twin-kidney grille and a reverse kink in the C-pillar. Bi-xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights operate with both high and low beams. Standard tires are 18 inches in diameter, but 19-inchers are optional.\n\nInterior\nIn both regular and long forms, the 7 Series seats up to five occupants. The driver gets a 14-way power seat with microperforated leather upholstery. Comfort seats with a 20-way adjustment and articulated backrests are standard in the 745Li and optional in the 745i.\n\nStandard features on both models include a power tilt/telescoping steering wheel, rain-sensing wipers, a navigation system, automatic climate control and a 10-speaker sound system with a six-CD changer. Sirius Satellite Radio is optional.\n\nUnder the Hood\nBMW’s 4.4-liter V-8 cranks out 325 horsepower. The six-speed-automatic transmission works with adaptive technology.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes, side-impact airbags for the front seats and BMW’s Head Protection System are standard. Rear-seat side-impact airbags are optional.\n\nDriving Impressions\nBecause these sedans are packed with so much technology, a first-time driver needs some preliminary instruction. The drive-by-wire throttle doesn’t feel especially strange, but the electronically operated steering does. Staying in your lane demands more attention than usual until you get used to the unconventional steering feel; once acquainted, it imparts a highly secure sensation.\n\nSome drivers love the complex, nonintuitive iDrive control system, but many dislike it intensely.\n\nRide comfort is satisfying, but the optional 19-inch tires may jostle passengers when riding on rougher roads. BMW’s 7 Series is a serious road machine and has always been among the most luxurious models on the market. Its ability to slice through curves considerably faster than expected, with no hint of body lean, is a welcome bonus.",

      "expert_review": "Imagine you’re a CEO.\n\nIt’s been a long day, and you’re beat. The finance guys are up in arms and the sales department can’t get its act together. It’s a relief to be going to that dinner party tonight. You climb into your new BMW 745i to head to the party.\n\nYou start the car. But rather than inserting and turning a key, this car requires you to insert a remote and hit a starter button. The transmission lever, a short stub on the steering column, toggles until one hits the desired gear.\n\nYou tune in a new radio station someone told you about. Using a single twisting knob that toggles like a joystick, you must flip through four menus on a dashboard screen to get to the manual radio tuning mode. Then you can tune in the radio station.\n\nNext, you try to get directions to the party by toggling in the address in the car’s navigation system. You get the directions from the car’s computerized voice, but the system tells you to turn left instead of right. You end up at the wrong house. The navigation system obviously used an old map for its data.\n\nThis is life with the BMW 745i, whose engineers have mistaken sophistication for complication. It mars an otherwise exemplary automobile experience.\n\nKeeping in mind that most people can’t tune their VCR clock, you’ll understand why this car is so over the top.\n\niDrive is BMW’s system of eliminating dashboard clutter that could easily overwhelm a weary CEO. It controls seven functions: the built-in, voice activated cell phone, navigation system, audio system, climate controls and heated front seats, BMW roadside assistance, maintenance menus, vehicle settings and explanations of how all this works.\n\nBut, be sure not to do any of this while driving.\n\nOnce you figure out the system, you’ll wonder why you need to push the iDrive joystick four times to tune a radio, when a simple knob accomplishes the same thing.\n\nBut, when you shove the accelerator, all is right with the world. The superb dynamics that mark all BMWs is apparent. While not as hard-edged as a BMW 5 Series, it’s every bit as sporty. However, the 745i has a bit of refinement in its suspension settings, being just a bit softer. Cornering is almost flat; braking is instantaneous. The vehicle makes you a better driver than you really are.\n\nPower from the all-new 4.4-liter V-8 is rated at 325 horsepower, the same as the old 750IL’s V-12 engine. Yet it returns mileage of 18 mpg city, 26 mpg highway. Its power is creamy smooth, yet ferocious and it’s all fed through an excellent six-speed automatic transmission. The transmission is always in the right place for your driving mood.\n\nOperating the transmission is another story. It’s controlled through a short stub of a lever that takes some getting used to. Want to park? Push in for park. Want to drive? Press downward. Want reverse? Press up. But to hit the gears, one must look at the indicat or to see if you’re in the correct gear. You don’t feel the lever shifting into a slot.\n\nOf course, that’s not the only electronic aid for driving. There’s a host of electronic aids to make sure you stay on track.\n\nActive Roll Stabilization uses numerous sensors and two active anti-roll bars to keep the car flat in corners. Electronic Damping Control continuously measures road conditions and adjusts the ride accordingly. Dynamic Stability Control helps prevent unwanted skids, while Electronic Brake Proportioning helps prevent over- or under-braking, while Dynamic Brake Control makes sure that you’re braking as well as possible in emergency situations. In addition, the vehicle offers traction control, a tire monitoring system, parking distance control and anti-lock brakes.\n\nIf all that is enough to make your head spin, just get in the car and get comfy. You won’t have to slam the door, since the car has ”soft close doors.” The final inch of travel on a d or is shut by a small motor. That also goes for the trunk lid as well.\n\nThe seats are incredibly comfortable. The famous, as well as rich, will appreciate the power privacy screens that shield one from view, but allow the driver to see out.\n\nAll of this is controlled by 54 fuses and relays mounted in the trunk on the inside of the right rear fender. If you happen to get hit in the right rear fender, you might need the number of a good electrician in addition to a good repair shop.\n\nWhat all this electronic decadence hides is a great sports sedan, one that used to have the simple, yet elegant, personality of its stablemates. But the engineers had too much free-rein here, and the result is overwhelming, a feeling that the engineers were trying so hard to prevent.",
