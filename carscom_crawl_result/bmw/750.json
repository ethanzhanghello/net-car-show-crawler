Anita is still laughing.\n\nShe: I finally got up the courage to take the 750 on the road. Keep in mind that I freaked last week when our used station wagon got a nick in the door. I didn’t know how I would react if I did anything to a car that cost almost as much as an Ivy League education. But I was OK. I gave the BMW the acid test in the packed church parking lot after Good Friday services, and later at the grocery store. My quick take – the trunk on this near-limousine only fit about six bags of groceries. It was so deep that it didn’t make sense for me to put any more in there because I couldn’t reach them. And those audio warnings every time another car got near me just about drove me nuts. I felt like Marge Simpson after she bought the doorbell that wouldn’t quit playing the Carpenters song.\n\nHe: I’ve often thought you’d be better off testing other types of consumer products – say, dishwashing liquids or maybe aspirin. You sure give me a headache sometimes. And by the way, that’s the park distance control you were referring to generically and comparing to Marge’s doorbell.\n\nShe: Hey, I’ll admit I’m too blue collar for this car. I once dreamed of opening a housecleaning service called Babushkas Inc. But it didn’t take me long to figure out what the 750iL is all about. There’s more room in the heated, power-adjustable rear seats than in the front, which leads me to believe it’s a car you buy if you’;ve got a chauffeur, not if you’re schlepping groceries. And maybe all this stuff is under the skin, but it seemed like a nice $40,000 car when I first got in, not a $95,000 car. I mean, who are they kidding? It’s not like my life will be incomplete without the 16-way power front seats that come standard on this German sedan or the audio system with 14 speakers.\n\nHe: Off your soapbox yet, dear? I expect to get a bag full of hate mail from every BMW owner in the country, at least all the male ones who probably wonder what the hell you’re doing reviewing this car in the first place.\n\nShe: Is it any coincidence that our test car was painted “royal red metallic?” All it needs is ermine headrests to complete the regal air.\n\nHe: It may surprise you to learn that there are a handful of people out there who will pay good money to own and drive a car like the 750iL, and not just for its exceptional performance. I don’t mean to sound like a shill for BMW, but I can’t think of too many cars for under $100,000 that offer a 326-horsepower V-12 engine coupled to a five-speed automatic transmission that you can also shift manually through a Tiptronic-style gate. Or come equipped with some of the most advanced safety features in the world, including front and rear side air bags and a head-protection system, pl us a dynamic stability control system that combines anti-lock brakes, traction and yaw control.\n\nShe: I admit I’m really superficial. I thought the styling was stodgy and there weren’t enough obvious gadgets to clue you in to the fact that this car is worth that much money. It’s all under the surface.\n\nHe: Sweetheart, there’s a Buick dealer up the street who has a Park Avenue waiting for you. I’m assuming you somehow missed the perforated leather upholstery, the polished wood inserts and even the fancy in-dash navigation system. By the way, that nav system is a little difficult to read for those of us who wear bifocals, but it proved to be one of the easiest to program and most efficient at mapping a route. I think I know where my next $95,000 is going – after the boys are out of college and grad school, of course.\n\nShe: Gee, didn’t we get a lot of that stuff on the $45,000 Acura RL we drove last week? Which, I should point out, cost half as much as the BMW. I guess just irks me when I hear that a $35,000 car is “affordable” and that there are sedans on the market that cost $95,000. They’re getting us used to these sky-high prices in increments. Kind of like gradually scalding yourself in a hot bath. I’m just asking, am I the only one who wonders if it’s worth it\n\n1999 BMW 750iL\n\nAnita’s rating: average\n\nPaul’s rating: world class\n\nType: Front-engine, rear-wheel drive, five-passenger luxury sedan\n\nPrice: Base, $92,100; as tested, $95,270 (including $570 destination charge and $2,600 gas-guzzler tax)\n\nEngine: 5.4-liter V-12; 326 hp at 5,000 rpm; 361 lb-ft torque at 3,900 rpm\n\nEPA fuel economy: 13 mpg city/20 mpg highway\n\n12-month insurance cost, according to AAA Michigan*: $2,462 (Estimate. Rates may be higher or lower, depending on coverage and driving record.)\n\nWhere built: Dingolfing, Germany\n\nWhat we liked: Styling is handsome, understated (Paul); state-of-the-art safety features; great advanced electronic gadgets, like park-distance control (Paul); one of the better navigation systems on the market.\n\nWhat we didn’t like: Overkill, overkill, overkill – who needs 16-way power seats? (Anita); morse-code-like warning bells will drive you nuts (Anita); trunk-mounted CD changer is a pain to use; styling looks stodgy (Anita); ridiculously priced, even with all the fancy gizmos (Anita).",

      "expert_review": "BMW’s 750iL is awesome, but then for $95,000 it should be. Price aside, which is hard to do, it is still a pretty amazing automobile.\n\nThis is the bigger brother of the 740iL, which is V8-powered. Think of it in Rolls-Royce and Bentley terms and you get a clearer picture of this car’s target market. It is for the ultra-rich, celebrities, maybe even heads of state. In other words, people who are driven (some chauffeured, some compulsive).\n\nBut it is more than just a rich person’s toy. It is a showcase for BMW’s engineering expertise, a car as good as they can make it, price no object. It melds luxury and performance into a package that is eye-opening.\n\nIt has a 12-cylinder, 326-horsepower engine and an array of creature comforts sure to coddle even the most demanding plutocrats, such as break-resistant security glass, front and side airbags, a power sunshade for the back window, heated steering wheel, adjustable rear seat and ultrasonic sensors in the bumpers that give an audible warning if you are parking too close to another car or are in danger of backing over something.\n\nThe latter feature is extremely handy and would be a wonderful feature on all cars, regardless of price.\n\nThe dash is typically BMW, which means simple instrumentation but overly complex audio systems with tiny buttons. Each front-seat passenger has their own controls for heating and cooling.\n\nBuilt on a 120.9-inch wheelbase, the same as most extended-length minivans, the 750iL has a back seat that is so spacious it feels more like a great room. Unless you play for the NBA your legs will never touch the back of the front seats. Legroom is so generous that each side has its own carpeted, wedge-shaped footrest.\n\nKeeping out prying eyes, or the sun, is done with the power sunshade that glides up in front of the back window. Retractable screens are also built into the back doors as well, for complete privacy.\n\nThe back seat itself is as comfortable as a custom-made couch. It tilts and slides, plus there are four levels of lumbar adjustment, as well.\n\nThe front seats adjust 16 ways, including 4-way lumbar and an articulated upper backrest. If you can’t get comfortable in this car you’d better see an orthopedic surgeon.\n\nWhile comfort is the operative word, it does not exclude performance. The single-overhead-cam (SOHC) V12 engine is a marvel of smoothness, as they all are. Twist the key and you can hear the engine come to life but you hardly feel it. Ease out onto the highway, give it some gas, and it gathers speed like a 747 on takeoff. Sixty miles per hour comes up in 6.7 seconds, pretty remarkable for a car this big and weighing 4,553 pounds. By the time you realize the scenery is scooting past your window faster than normal you are well into triple-digit speeds, but it feels so serene that you can’t believe the speedometer. In Germany, cars like this routinely cruise the autobahns at more than double our speed limit, b ut the ones that come here have their top speed electronically limited to 128 mph.\n\nIn addition to anti-lock brakes, the all-season traction system also includes Dynamic Stability Control to “enhance stability under conditions when the vehicle’s limit of cornering capability is being approached.”\n\nThe only option ($2,800) on the 750 is an on-board navigational system that keeps track of the vehicle’s location with a Global Positioning Sensor. Users can program in a specific destination and be shown the way with maps on a five-inch color video monitor. It can also tell you the location of banks, hotels, restaurants and hospitals. Maps are contained on CD-ROM discs that fit into a trunk-mounted player. Map CDs are available for the continental U.S., except for some rural or sparsely populated areas.\n\nThe computer that runs the navigation system also controls the cellular phone, audio system and can programmed to ventilate the interior when the car is left standing. A v eo monitor or VCR can be used in the rear passenger compartment.\n\nA nice benefit befitting a car in this price range is that all maintenance for the first four years or 50,000 miles is free.\n\nPrice\n\nThe base price is $93,300. Add the $1,700 gas guzzler tax and $570 destination charge and the sticker price is $95,570.\n\nWarranty\n\nThe basic warranty is for four years or 50,000 miles.\n\nVehicles for The Star’s week-long test drives are supplied by the auto manufacturers.\n\nPoint: The 750iL is near the pinnacle of luxury motoring. Competitors can be counted on one hand. The V12 is so smooth you can barely feel it, the back seat is as big as your family room and the list of luxury equipment is unparalleled.\n\nCounterpoint: There’s not much to beef about with a car like this, except that I could never afford one. Besides that, a simpler radio would be in order, but that’s about it.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\n\nENGINE: 5.4-liter, V12\n\nTRANSMISSION: Automatic\n\nWHEELBASE: 120.9 inches\n\nCURB WEIGHT: 4,553 lbs.\n\nBASE PRICE: $93,300\n\nPRICE AS DRIVEN: $95,570\n\nMPG RATING: 15 city, 20 hwy.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Redesigned on a new carbon-fiber-intensive platform, the 2016 BMW 750i full-size sedan drives like a smaller car, accelerates like a sports car and surrounds its occupants in uncompromising luxury. \n    \nVersus the competition: Full-size flagship sedans like the Lexus LS 460, Mercedes-Benz S-Class and Audi A8 emphasize a comfortable — if mostly unengaging — driving experience, but the redesigned 750i aims for the Jaguar XJ with its sporty, enthusiast-oriented driving manners.\n\nFlagship luxury sedans are technological showcases for a brand, and that’s certainly what the redesigned 7 Series is for BMW. From the things you can’t see (like its weight-saving construction) to high-tech safety features (and dubious technology like gesture-based controls), the 7 Series shows BMW’s latest thinking and gives us a peek at what might be in store for future versions of its other cars.\n\nThe 2016 7 Series is offered only in long-wheelbase form, and its overall length stretches to nearly 207 inches. The 740i is powered by a 320-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder engine, while the 750i features a 445-hp, turbocharged 4.4-liter V-8. Rear-wheel drive is standard on both models, and BMW’s xDrive all-wheel-drive system is a $3,000 option. The all-wheel-drive 750i we tested had a starting price of $98,395, including a $995 destination charge, but optional features pushed its as-tested price to a heady $128,445.\nExterior & Styling\nThe 7 Series looks the part of a flagship luxury sedan, with its imposing size and low-slung proportions. The car has serious street presence. That said, its updated styling doesn’t stray far from the design direction established by its predecessor. The most significant differences are in front; the headlights are narrower and BMW’s signature twin-kidney grille is wider. Thinner taillights complement the restyled front end.\nHow It Drives\nAs BMWs have become more refined and luxurious in recent years, they’ve lost some of the qualities that made them favorites of driving enthusiasts, but the 750i reverses that trend for the brand’s largest car. The 750i is about the same size as its predecessor, but the all-wheel-drive version’s 4,610-pound curb weight is 190 pounds less than before. The lower curb weight comes through in the driving experience; the 750i feels nimble and not as big as its substantial dimensions. In this way, it’s reminiscent of the Jaguar XJ, which is more engaging to drive than most full-size luxury sedans.\n\nOur test car benefited from a $4,100 Autobahn package, which adds an active suspension and active steering. The active suspension includes adjustable anti-roll bars that allow additional suspension travel while driving straight and less travel when cornering to reduce body roll. Meanwhile, active steering can turn the rear wheels in the opposite or same direction as the front wheels depending on speed, to improve cornering performance and high-speed stability, respectively.\n\nThe all-wheel-drive 750i is also quick; BMW cites a zero-to-60-mph time of 4.3 seconds. Pressing the gas pedal part of the way down while cruising on the highway brings a quick downshift from the eight-speed automatic transmission and a surge of power for passing slower-moving traffic. Pushing the pedal all the way to the floor makes the hood rise as the car crouches over the rear wheels and lunges forward. It’s impressive.\n\nThe sedan’s size becomes more evident if you drive it hard through a corner, where body roll materializes, but I like how BMW has tuned the steering; it’s direct and precise, and the wheel turns with a light touch. Steering feedback, however, is mostly absent, and I’d welcome some when the car is in Sport mode.\n\nBesides Sport, there are also two Comfort modes, Comfort and Comfort Plus, as well as an Eco Pro mode. In Comfort, gas pedal response is gradual and the air suspension is more forgiving, allowing more body movement, while the engine stop-start system is at the ready. Sport increases gas pedal responsiveness, lowers ride height by 10 millimeters at high speeds, firms the suspension and adopts a more aggressive shift program. The drivetrain feels more eager in Sport, but BMW didn’t go overboard with the mode’s suspension tuning; you feel bumps a little more, but the ride isn’t harsh, even with optional 20-inch wheels and low-profile tires. \n\nThe 750i takes premium gas, and its EPA-estimated fuel economy is 17/25/20 mpg city/highway/combined with rear-wheel drive and 16/25/19 mpg with all-wheel drive. The car’s engine stop-start system is one of the more seamless I’ve tested. The engine starts quickly and smoothly when it’s time to go again, and the feature was pretty active during my testing – even when stopped briefly at a stop sign. (If you prefer, you can deactivate the system by pressing a button below the push-button ignition.)\nInterior\nThe 750i’s cabin is finely crafted. The interior blends traditional luxury cues, like an optional stitched leather dashboard, with tech features, like a digital instrument panel and BMW’s iDrive multimedia system with a 10.2-inch widescreen display.\n\nIt’s also a comfortable place to let the miles pass by. The 20-way power front seats are big, comfortable and finished in leather, and they can be fitted with an optional massager.\n\nAs comfortable as the big front bucket seats are, the backseat is just as appealing. With 44.4 inches of rear legroom, there’s plenty of space to stretch your legs and good thigh support for taller passengers. Options like power-adjustable seat cushions, a massaging function, power window shades and a dual-screen entertainment system make it one of the most comfortable and luxurious rear seats I’ve sat in that wasn’t from Rolls-Royce or Bentley. \n\nI’m not a fan, however, of the 7 Series’ new silver-colored and glass-like buttons on the dashboard, center console and elsewhere. BMW has used black dashboard buttons with white lettering for years, and even though the new ones have an upscale appearance, it’s harder to tell what they do. The lettering on the silver buttons is hard to read in the daytime, and reflections can make the console’s glass-like buttons difficult to read.\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe 750i gets the latest version of BMW’s iDrive multimedia system. iDrive’s primary interface remains a console knob controller surrounded by shortcut buttons, but the dashboard display is now also a touch-screen, providing another way to make selections.\n\nThe 7 Series also features gesture recognition, which BMW calls a world-first for a production car. With the feature, making various hand gestures in the air in front of the dashboard lets you accept or decline incoming calls, adjust stereo volume and, in models with the optional surround-view camera system, rotate a virtual image of the car on the dashboard screen to get a better view of your immediate surroundings.\n\nIt was hard for me to get the system to recognize some gestures, but while that could improve with more practice, the larger issue is that gesturing doesn’t necessarily make your life in the car any easier. To turn up the stereo volume, for instance, there are already easy-to-use controls on the steering wheel and dashboard. It may be a good way to impress your friends, but it’s not something I’d want to deal with day in and day out.\n\nAs of publication, iDrive doesn’t support Apple CarPlay or Android Auto smartphone mirroring. It wasn’t hard to pair my iPhone using Bluetooth, and the system recognized my phone when connected via the USB port. Wireless charging (of phones that support it) is standard, but we found the vertical pocket under the center armrest to be one of the least convenient places for the feature, frustrating any attempt to grab the phone for quick use (though that could be a safety advantage).\n\nThe optional surround-view camera system lets you see different views in the dashboard screen, including one that lets you rotate around a virtual image of the 7 Series from a perspective of a few feet away rather than the common top-down view, which is the default. The images from the various cameras have been stitched together relatively seamlessly to create this virtual view, but just like the car’s gesture controls, it feels a little superfluous; most of the time, the most important thing when maneuvering is how close your bumpers are to another car or object, and there are other camera views that better relay that info.\n\nBMW offers an optional 7-inch Android tablet that stores in a holder in the rear center armrest. The tablet has controls for the seats, cabin lights, air conditioning, and navigation and multimedia systems. You can also browse the internet.\nCargo & Storage\nThe 18.2-cubic-foot trunk includes a standard pass-through to the cabin for carrying long, skinny items. The trunk lid is powered and includes foot-activated, hands-free operation.\nSafety\nExpensive luxury sedans like the 750i aren’t normally crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. In fact, IIHS has never published test results for the 7 Series.\n\nA backup camera is standard. There are a lot of active-safety and autonomous driving features available for the 2016 750i. They include blind spot warning, rear cross-traffic alert, lane departure warning and prevention, forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking and pedestrian detection, adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability, cross-traffic warning and traffic jam assistant.\n\nWith traffic jam assistant, you can press a button on the steering wheel and the 750i will steer itself to stay in its lane. The system had no trouble following highway lane markings on an overcast day, and another editor was impressed with its lane recognition when driving into sunlight, a situation that has a tendency to trip up these kinds of systems. You have to keep at least one hand on the wheel, however, or the steering assistance will cease after about 10 seconds.\n\nNight vision with pedestrian and animal detection costs $2,300. The system projects a black-and-white video image on the dashboard screen and highlights pedestrians and large animals in yellow when they’re present. \n\nFor a full list of safety features, see the Features & Specs page.\nValue in Its Class\nThe 750i’s starting price is similar to the S-Class, and while the A8 and XJ have lower starting prices, all four cars can cost well above $100,000 in certain configurations. Cadillac’s new CT6 is even less expensive, but its driving manners and interior space make it feel more like a BMW 5 Series challenger than a 7 Series competitor.\n\nOverall, the 2016 750i is the rare full-size luxury sedan that rewards both the driver and passengers in equal measure. It’s nimble and quick, and its expansive and luxuriously appointed backseat is downright rejuvenating. Perhaps that’s what you’d expect from this corner of the car market, but really this BMW is more of an exception than the rule.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "In recent years, BMW’s 7-series suffered a fair amount of derision for the styling of its trunk lid and the confoundingly complicated iDrive control system. With the redesigned 2009, both items have been fixed. All-wheel drive will be offered for 2010.\n\nThe last few months have hardly been an ideal climate for the introduction of a new luxury sedan, but life goes on for car companies and the new 7-series made its debut at the Los Angeles auto show last fall.\n\nPrices begin at $81,125 for the 750i and $85,025 for the long-wheelbase 750Li. The range-topping 760i will have a twin-turbo, 6.0-liter V-12 with 544 horsepower and an eight-speed automatic transmission.\n\nThe test car, from BMW’s press fleet, had a sticker price of $96,970. Only the rich need apply.\n\nStyling of the fifth-generation 7-series has been toned down, and while the look won’t knock you out, it won’t push you away, either. Subtlety is the word, and that’s not all bad considering that luxury sedans are targeted at older buyers who generally don’t want to flaunt their wealth.\n\nThe 750i has an all-new 4.4-liter, twin-turbo V-8 that lays down its power as smoothly as a politician speaks at election time. The automatic transmission is a six-speed.\n\nThis engine cranks out 400 horsepower and 450 pound-feet of torque over a broad rpm range. It is so quiet and smooth that it feels like an electric motor. Toeing the throttle results in a soft rush of acceleration that is actually quite spirited if you keep your foot down. BMW says the car can hit 60 miles per hour in 5.1 seconds. The fuel mileage ratings are 15 miles per gallon in the city and 22 on the highway.\n\nThe cabin of the 750i is as warm and luxurious as a five-star hotel. The seats are deep and supportive. The instrument panel, console and door panels have large pieces of wood trim. The steering wheel has fingertip controls, and iDrive has been simplified to the point that it is now manageable. Many of the audio and climate controls can now be operated directly with individual knobs.\n\nBMW prides itself on producing cars that have excellent road manners, and the 750i is no exception. While you won’t mistake its handling for that of a sports sedan, it always feels unruffled and well-connected to the road. BMW credits the smooth ride and crisp handling to a completely new self-leveling air suspension system.\n\nThe driving dynamics system has four settings that determine shock-absorber firmness, transmission shift characteristics, engine-throttle response and power-steering assist.\n\nOther options include lane departure warning, blind-spot detection, night vision and active cruise control with stop-and-go capability.\n\nRear-seat passengers have plenty of legroom in the 750i. The wheelbase of the 750Li is five inches longer and that adds even more rear legroom.\n\nPrice\n\nThe test car’s base price was $81,125. A long list of options included rear-view and side-view cameras, luxury seating that included a heated steering wheel and an active seat for the driver, premium sound system, rear-seat entertainment package, night vision, head-up display, satellite radio and HD radio. The 750i has a $1,000 gas-guzzler tax. The sticker price was $96,970.\n\nWarranty\n\nFour years or 50,000 miles, with full maintenance provided free during that time period.\n\n2009 BMW 750i\n\nEngine: 4.4-liter, 400-hp V-8\n\nTransmission:\n\nSix-speed automatic\n\nRear-wheel drive\n\nWheelbase: 120.9 inches\n\nCurb weight: 4,564 lbs.\n\nBase price: $81,125\n\nAs driven: $96,970\n\nMPG rating: 15 city, 22 hwy.\n\nTom Strongman’s e-mail address is tom@tomstrongman.com.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nGiving automotive safety a new twist, BMW adds two “light-armored” Protection Line models for the 7 Series, its flagship sedan.\n\nThe 740iL and 750iL Protection Line sedans come with Aramide (a fiber reinforcing material) armoring for the front footwells, doors, rear bulkhead, wheel housings and roof, plus bullet-resistant windows and run flat tires. Protection Line models seat four people instead of the usual five and add a separate rear telephone handset.\n\nSales of light-armored vehicles outfitted by aftermarket suppliers have grown in recent years, BMW says, and it is the first major automaker to offer them directly.\n\nExterior\nThe rear-drive 7 Series comes in two sizes: The 740i is 196 inches long on a 115.4-inch wheelbase, and the 740iL and 750iL are 202 inches long on a 121-inch wheelbase. The extra length shows up in the larger rear doors on the 740iL and 750iL.\n\nInterior\nThe longer 740iL and 750iL have even more rear legroom than the shorter 740i, which has more than enough space for taller passengers to sit comfortably.\n\nNew standard features on the 740i and 740iL are rain-sensing windshield wipers, headlamp washers and the Premium Package (a navigation system, Xenon gas-discharge headlamps, premium sound system and a six-disc CD changer). They were already standard on the 750iL.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 4.4-liter V-8 with 282 horsepower is under the hood of the 740 models. The 750iL has a 5.4-liter V-12 engine with 326 horsepower, the only current luxury sedan with more than eight cylinders. Mercedes is scheduled to add a V-12 for the S-Class for 2001. Both engines come with a five-speed automatic transmission.\n\nSafety\nBMW’s Head Protection System for rear passengers is a new feature included with the optional rear side-impact airbags.\n\nBMW’s Head Protection System uses a tubular airbag to protect a front-seat occupant from hitting the side window.\n\nStandard equipment includes dual-stage front airbags whose deployment force depends on crash severity and other factors, and side airbags and the Head Protection System for the front seats.\n\n \n\nReported by Rick Popely  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2000 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nBMW’s flagship 7 Series sedan comes in two wheelbases: regular and extended, starting with the more affordable trim levels, the 750i and 750Li, respectively. A limited-production V-12-powered version, the 760Li comes only in the longer size, and a high-performance model adapted by German tuner Alpina, called simply the Alpina B7, is based on the shorter wheelbase. (It’s detailed in a separate report in the Cars.com Research section.)\n\nThe 7 Series has featured some incremental changes over the years since the birth of this fourth generation in 2002 — including an engine-size increase that changed the base model from 745 to 750. However, BMW says absolutely nothing in the 7 Series has changed between 2007 and 2008. Apart from the trim levels above, BMW Individual customization is available, comprising special leather and interior trim, an Alcantara suede headliner, 20-inch wheels and illuminated doorsills.\n\nThe 750i competes with top-line sedans like the Audi A8, Jaguar XJ and Mercedes-Benz S-Class. The affordable Lexus LS 460 is a key alternative in regular and extended body lengths. The 760Li’s main competitor is the V-12-powered Mercedes S600. For the true performance version of the 7, check out the Alpina B7.\n\nExterior\nBMW’s regular-length 750i sedan is built on a 117.7-inch wheelbase, versus a 123.2-inch version on the extended-length 750Li sedan. The longer model is identical but for chrome roof molding, where the 750i is body-colored. All models have chrome trim on the bumpers.\n\nOne of the early and perhaps most controversial models designed by American Chris Bangle, the 7 Series has had key styling changes that have damped criticism somewhat. Namely, the taillamps now run directly onto a reshaped trunklid, making it look less like it was added after the fact, and the headlight clusters were restyled for a more aggressive look, closer to that of the 5 Series sedan.\n\nInterior\nUp to five occupants can fit easily inside the 750i, though a relatively high center floor hump crowds the center passenger’s feet. The backseat of the 750Li and 760Li has more legroom.\n\nDetail trim elements have a metallic look. A flat-tire warning and a 10-speaker audio system are standard. The Adaptive Ride Package includes Electronic Damping Control and a self-leveling rear air suspension. Heated front Comfort seats and power-folding exterior mirrors are standard for the whole model line.\n\nAlso controversial is the standard iDrive interface, a combination knob/joystick/button that — along with an LCD screen — controls many functions, including the stereo, navigation and some aspects of ventilation.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe 750’s 4.8-liter V-8 drives the rear wheels with 360 horsepower at 6,300 rpm and 360 pounds-feet of torque at 3,400 rpm. The 760Li’s V-12 engine generates 438 hp and 444 pounds-feet of torque. The torque seems modest considering that the Alpina B7’s modified V-8 delivers 516 pounds-feet along with its 500 hp. Generous torque is common in engines with more cylinders.\n\nThe six-speed Steptronic automatic transmission has its selector positioned just ahead of the steering-wheel rim. A steering-wheel button selects Drive, Sport or Manual shift mode. Shift buttons at the front and back of the steering wheel can be used to execute manual gear changes.\n\nSafety\nBMW’s first- and second-row inflatable tubular Head Protection System is similar to side curtain airbags. Front-seat side-impact airbags are also standard, and rear side-impact airbags are optional. Active Knee Protection is standard. Active Cruise Control that uses a radar sensor is optional.\n\nDriving Impressions\nIn the class of large, heavy luxury flagships, the 750 feels nimble, benefiting from its perfect 50/50 (front/rear) weight distribution. The V-8 engine is eager and more than powerful enough for most buyers. The 760Li’s value is in its exclusivity more than its additional performance. The 7 Series’ ride quality is good, thanks in part to active stabilizer bars that make their presence known only when the car is turning, preventing body lean. Overall, the technology that BMW uses in the service of performance, under the hood and chassis, is top-notch, where competitors’ often add too much weight or feel gimmicky.\n\nOn the flip side, BMW’s slavish devotion to its iDrive system only harms its vehicles’ appeal. Attempts to simplify it have made it better, but it’s far from good. Critics say it’s difficult to figure out, when the true problem is more insidious: Once you do figure it out, it’s unpleasant to use, and that never changes. Somewhat related, BMW’s change in the 7 Series from mechanical gear selectors and turn-signal stalks to lever-activated electronics are “improvements” that some drivers find detrimental. Otherwise, the 7 Series’ interior is well-appointed and comfy. Check out options like massaging seats with more adjustments than you’ve ever seen, and night vision that appears on the dashboard display.\n\nWe have yet to experience the Alpina B7.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe flagship sedan of the BMW fleet gets a portable phone that operates in either digital or analog mode as a new standard feature and run-flat tires as a no-cost option. Last year, the run-flat tires were available only on the light-armored Protection Line models of the 740iL and 750iL. BMW says the tires can run up to 300 miles at 50 mph without air.\n\nProtection Line sedans come with Aramide armoring (a fiber-reinforcing material) for the front footwells, doors, rear bulkhead, and wheel housings and roof, as well as bullet-resistant windows.\n\nExterior\nThe rear-drive 7 Series comes in two sizes: The 740i is 196 inches long on a 115.4-inch wheelbase, and the 740iL and 750iL are 202 inches long on a 121-inch wheelbase. The extra length shows up in the larger rear doors on the 740iL and 750iL.\n\nEagle-eye BMW watchers will notice that the side sills and lower bumper surfaces are body-color instead of matte black on the 2001 models, and the turn-signal lenses are clear instead of amber.\n\nInterior\nThe 740i has enough space in the rear seat for taller passengers to sit comfortably, and the longer 740iL and 750iL models have limousinelike rear-seat accommodations and longer doors for easier entry and exit. Standard features include a power tilt/telescopic steering wheel, rain-sensing windshield wipers, headlight washers, a navigation system, premium sound system with a six-CD changer and automatic climate control.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 4.4-liter V-8 engine with 282 horsepower is under the hood of the 740 models. The 750iL has a 5.4-liter V-12 with 326 hp. Both engines come with a five-speed automatic transmission.\n\nSafety\nStandard equipment includes dual-stage front airbags, whose deployment force depends on crash severity and other factors, and side-impact airbags and the Head Protection System for the front seats. Head Protection for rear passengers is included with the optional rear side airbags.\n\n \n\nReported by Rick Popely  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2001 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "The latest edition of BMW’s 750Li sedan may be the perfect car for effortless and entertaining long-distance touring.\n\nThe German automaker continues to improve and refine its four-door flagship. Best of all, the big 7 Series receives a rear-end restyling midway through its life cycle, dramatically improving the continuity and look. We tested a well-equipped 2006 750Li with more than $14,000 worth of options and a bottom line of $89,840.\n\nHE: We’ve been driving an awful lot of expensive hardware lately, and it’s easy to get a little too dazzled by some of these wheels. But for some reason, I keep coming back to the 750Li, which I have criticized heavily and frequently in the past. Thank goodness, BMW has listened to some of the critics, including its own customers, and updated the sheet metal, especially that dreadful and disjointed tail. The design department made only modest tweaks to the rear end, but the difference is truly amazing. Now the 7 Series actually looks appealing from most angles — and, of course, the driving dynamics are still as superb as ever.\n\nSHE: You sound like a little boy, gushing over a new BB gun at Christmas. I’m still actually torn when I drive any vehicle that costs more than $40,000 or $50,000 — it’s hard to justify some of those ridiculous price tags. But if you can afford to spend this kind of money, the 750Li is very impressive. Not necessarily warm and fuzzy, like some of my favorite cars, but still a pleasure to drive, especially if you have a long way to travel. And I don’t feel that way about many of the really pricey vehicles we’ve driven lately.\n\nHE: Yes, dear, I can imagine how that troubles your conscience to have to climb behind the wheel of a $90,000 German luxury sport sedan.\n\nSHE: I’ll tell you what doesn’t bother my conscience is BMW’s commitment to safety, a virtue that didn’t get overlooked in the company’s quest to create a great performance car. The standard safety equipment on the 750Li is outstanding — dynamic stability control, dynamic traction control and dynamic brake control, for starters, plus a full complement of air bags and curtains to protect occupants from head to knees. You also get adaptive headlamps, rain-sensing wipers and park distance. I’m not sure there is much else, in the way of active or passive safety hardware, that you could add to this car to improve occupant protection.\n\nHE: Oh, there you go again, talking nuts and bolts. So while we’re on the subject, we might as well point out once again the virtues of BMW’s powerful DOHC 4.8-liter V-8, which makes 360 horsepower and feels like a true thoroughbred — always ready to gallop flat-out at the slightest touch. I’m so glad, too, that BMW fitted its six-speed Steptronic transmission, which is silky smooth, easy to use in either manual or automatic mode and nowhere near as annoying and herky-jerky as the goofy SMG transmission in the M5.\n\nSHE: I’m impressed that a big car with this kind of performance and sports-car handling also rides like a true European luxury car — supple without feeling floaty, firm without feeling harsh. And the 750Li does all these amazing things at about half the price of the Bentley Continental Flying Spur we recently tested. I supposed I’d consider this an even better value, if that’s the right word, if our test car hadn’t been loaded up with more than $14,000 worth of options. I mean, a heated steering wheel for $150 is a nice touch, especially if you have to endure Michigan winters, but do I really need a $2,200 rear entertainment package that comes bundled with a separate iDrive controller for the rear passengers? One iDrive in the front seat is bad enough.\n\nHE: I would agree with you that the BMW is not without its flaws. But this car is so good, it’s easy to overlook most of those shortcomings. For the money, I still think the 750Li is the world’s finest luxury/performance sedan.\n\n2006 BMW 750Li\n\nType: Front-engine, rear-wheel drive, five-passenger sedan\nPrice: Base, $75,195 (incl. $695 shipping charge); as tested, $89,840\nEngine: 4.8-liter V-8; 360-hp; 360 lb-ft torque\nEPA fuel economy: 17 mpg city/25 mpg highway\nWhere built: Germany\nEstimated 12-month insurance cost, according to AAA Michigan: $2,642\n\nAnita: 5\nLikes: One of the roomiest cabins available in the luxury segment. World-class safety features. Outstanding assembly quality. Extremely comfortable ride. Powerful 4.8L V-8 engine.\nDislikes: Odd shift mechanism requires learning curve. More than $14,000 worth of options pushed the sticker on our test car to nearly $90,000.\n\nPaul: 5\nLikes: World’s finest luxury/performance sedan. Amazing rear-seat controls, including a second iDrive. Gorgeous matte wood and metal trim. Superb seats with lots of adjustments. Smooth six-speed automatic. Precise steering and excellent ride control.\nDislikes: Rear armrest needs a pull-down strap — a strange oversight. Rear deck and parcel shelf cut visibility. IDrive requires too many operations for simple functions.\n\nAnita and Paul Lienert are partners in Lienert & Lienert, a Detroit-based automotive information services company.",

      "expert_review": "My kids keep me on the move. If I’m not running upstairs to investigate suspiciously silent moments, then I’m surely flying downstairs to keep them from jumping over baskets of clean, folded laundry, ducking under banned flying Frisbees or putting an end to the “music” being produced by vivacious pounding of stockpot lids. Come to think of it, I should consider cranking up the speed of the aforementioned exercise combination, which would give my gluteus maximus a much-needed workout.\n\nLucky for my backside, it got a little R&R in the BMW 750i’s driver’s seat, thanks to the simply divine butt-massage setting. Once I added heat into the mix and extended the optional knee support, not even the call of chocolate could lure me out. I concocted errands just for the sake of getting more tush time. Also, that seat adjusted in just about every way possible, including a blissful option for head support that was similar to those found on some airplanes. With the push of a button, the sides of the seat pumped up and cradled my ribs and shoulders in a snuggly, hug-like way. Since my week in this dreamy car was all about comfort, I disregarded the fact that when in snuggly-huggy mode it was almost impossible to hand anything off to my 3-year-old in the seat directly behind me. Instead I opted to surround my little guy with all possible snacks and drinks from the get-go to keep my involvement to a minimum. Don’t scoff – luxury is a tempting proposition!\n\nWhile I was enjoying these blissful conditions, which were almost too good for driving, the kids had their own entertainment in back. The two side window shades and the rear shade became the new toys for the week. Fortunately, there was a lock button in the front on the driver’s side so I could squash this activity once it got out of control. Of course, as soon as that happened they started fiddling with their own seat-heater buttons on the rear center armrest, which are accessible when the armrest is in the down position. Because I’d loaded up the back with snacks – specifically in the spacious storage compartment in the rear armrest – they were eventually distracted from continuous button pushing by continuous chewing. (I was very surprised that neither of my button-happy boys noticed the two lighter buttons at their feet. Kudos to the snackies! Whew!)\n\nThere were plenty of features to keep me occupied, as well. While waiting in carpool I used a clever notepad function in the voice recognition system to make a list of trivial to-dos in an effort to extend my car time. If the butt-massage and heat setting weren’t enough, I could also have used the residual heat feature during the carpool wait, which ingeniously heats the interior of the car after it’s been turned off, using stored heat. Another feature with wow factor is BMW’s night vision, which uses an infrared camera to display a thermal image in an effort to more easily recognize people or animals on the road. Last but not least, there are the Latch connectors. While I fiddled around, desperately seeking the connector, my fingers repeatedly bumped into a sharp, screw-like object. Ouch! I shuddered at the thought of having to do this with freezing cold hands.\n\nSome cars are a battle with little wee ones and deliciously dreamy with older kids. This is one of them. Take the car seats out of the equation, and a pampered mom of older kids might just find this car a dream come true.\n\n*For more information on the BMW 750i and its safety features, visit Cars.com.

      "expert_review": "As the 2010 7 Series ebbs into the 2011 with few changes, I spent some time driving the 750Li xDrive. That’s BMW’s long-wheelbase, all-wheel-drive version of its flagship sedan.\n\nWhile I was impressed with the standard-length 750i with rear-wheel drive, the 750Li’s added length and weight sapped any excitement from the driving experience.\n\nLuckily, backseat passengers are cocooned in a level of automotive opulence you don’t routinely find under the six-figure mark.\n\nAs a person who routinely chauffeurs and rarely rides in the backseat, I couldn’t recommend any car that so heavily favors the rider instead of the driver.\n\nWhat Li Gets You\nI’m not sure who will be shopping for a long-wheelbase 7 Series. Overseas, they’re the executive car of choice, allowing busy CEOs a space to decompress between board meetings. Perhaps there are enough of these power brokers in the U.S. as well, because I can’t imagine any affluent parent wanting to pamper even the most spoiled child with backseat digs that are far superior to the driver’s in terms of plushness and technological gadgetry.\n\nMy test car had option packages checked off en masse. Besides the somewhat pedestrian seat-mounted dual LCD screens that can play a variety of media sources, from DVDs to iPods, there are automatic sunshades on the windows so you can watch a movie even when it’s sunny. No matter what you’re doing back there, though, the seats are what transform a ride in the 750Li into a luxurious undertaking.\n\nOur tester had upgraded rear seats with ventilation, electronic adjustment and a massage feature. Yes, massaging seats. The giant head restraints felt softer than the four pillows I use in my bed. If I had to be chauffeured cross-country, I think I’d be just fine back there.\n\nDriving\nI’d feel a bit bad for the driver on that trip, though. While the 400-horsepower, turbocharged 4.4-liter V-8 engine is relatively sprightly in the 750i, I thought it was a bit of a laggard while towing all the additional weight that comes with the 750Li’s longer wheelbase and xDrive all-wheel-drive system hardware. All of the driving comfort Mike Hanley mentioned in his review of the 2009 750i is still there, but I found the experience a bit numbing. That may be good for some large luxury sedans, but probably not ones adorned with the letters B, M and W.\n\nThe front seats are nearly as comfortable as the rear ones, but the massage feature works just your thighs — and buttocks, I must add — to keep the driver alert.\n\nIt’s not a pleasant sensation.\n\nCargo\nThe trunk is decently sized, but not as big as you’d expect in a car this mammoth. At 14 cubic feet, it fit our department’s standard-size golf bags that we test in every car, but my personal oversized bag and modern driver (the club, not the chauffeur) wouldn’t fit lengthwise. That means most foursomes wouldn’t be able to load their gear into the 750Li. The trunk is 2.3 cubic feet smaller than the Mercedes-Benz S-Class’, and it’s a little smaller than the new Jaguar XJL’s trunk, which measures 15.2 cubic feet. \n\nSafety\nThe 750Li is outfitted with a full array of airbags, including front-seat-mounted side-impact airbags, side curtain airbags for both rows, and knee airbags. The previous-generation 7 Series offered rear side-impact airbags, but this one doesn’t. It seems an oversight in a car so focused on addressing the needs of backseat passengers.\n\nAdvanced features — like adaptive cruise control with a collision warning system, blind spot detection, and even a night-vision feature — are optional.\n\n750Li in the Market\nOur 750Li’s as-tested price of $104,000 may make your eyes bulge, but the car is a luxurious limousine that’s still a sizable chunk of change less than a Bentley Continental Flying Spur, which starts at $177,600 — and it’s a lot less ostentatious to boot.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in August 2010 about the 2010 BMW 750Li xDrive. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2011, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nAs the 2010 7 Series ebbs into the 2011 with few changes, I spent some time driving the 750Li xDrive. That’s BMW’s long-wheelbase, all-wheel-drive version of its flagship sedan.\n\nWhile I was impressed with the standard-length 750i with rear-wheel drive, the 750Li’s added length and weight sapped any excitement from the driving experience.\n\nLuckily, backseat passengers are cocooned in a level of automotive opulence you don’t routinely find under the six-figure mark.\n\nAs a person who routinely chauffeurs and rarely rides in the backseat, I couldn’t recommend any car that so heavily favors the rider instead of the driver.\n\nWhat Li Gets You\nI’m not sure who will be shopping for a long-wheelbase 7 Series. Overseas, they’re the executive car of choice, allowing busy CEOs a space to decompress between board meetings. Perhaps there are enough of these power brokers in the U.S. as well, because I can’t imagine any affluent parent wanting to pamper even the most spoiled child with backseat digs that are far superior to the driver’s in terms of plushness and technological gadgetry.\n\nMy test car had option packages checked off en masse. Besides the somewhat pedestrian seat-mounted dual LCD screens that can play a variety of media sources, from DVDs to iPods, there are automatic sunshades on the windows so you can watch a movie even when it’s sunny. No matter what you’re doing back there, though, the seats are what transform a ride in the 750Li into a luxurious undertaking.\n\nOur tester had upgraded rear seats with ventilation, electronic adjustment and a massage feature. Yes, massaging seats. The giant head restraints felt softer than the four pillows I use in my bed. If I had to be chauffeured cross-country, I think I’d be just fine back there.\n\nDriving\nI’d feel a bit bad for the driver on that trip, though. While the 400-horsepower, turbocharged 4.4-liter V-8 engine is relatively sprightly in the 750i, I thought it was a bit of a laggard while towing all the additional weight that comes with the 750Li’s longer wheelbase and xDrive all-wheel-drive system hardware. All of the driving comfort Mike Hanley mentioned in his review of the 2009 750i is still there, but I found the experience a bit numbing. That may be good for some large luxury sedans, but probably not ones adorned with the letters B, M and W.\n\nThe front seats are nearly as comfortable as the rear ones, but the massage feature works just your thighs — and buttocks, I must add — to keep the driver alert.\n\nIt’s not a pleasant sensation.\n\nCargo\nThe trunk is decently sized, but not as big as you’d expect in a car this mammoth. At 14 cubic feet, it fit our department’s standard-size golf bags that we test in every car, but my personal oversized bag and modern driver (the club, not the chauffeur) wouldn’t fit lengthwise. That means most foursomes wouldn’t be able to load their gear into the 750Li. The trunk is 2.3 cubic feet smaller than the Mercedes-Benz S-Class’, and it’s a little smaller than the new Jaguar XJL’s trunk, which measures 15.2 cubic feet. \n\nSafety\nThe 750Li is outfitted with a full array of airbags, including front-seat-mounted side-impact airbags, side curtain airbags for both rows, and knee airbags. The previous-generation 7 Series offered rear side-impact airbags, but this one doesn’t. It seems an oversight in a car so focused on addressing the needs of backseat passengers.\n\nAdvanced features — like adaptive cruise control with a collision warning system, blind spot detection, and even a night-vision feature — are optional.\n\n750Li in the Market\nOur 750Li’s as-tested price of $104,000 may make your eyes bulge, but the car is a luxurious limousine that’s still a sizable chunk of change less than a Bentley Continental Flying Spur, which starts at $177,600 — and it’s a lot less ostentatious to boot.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in June 2016 about the 2016 BMW 750, but little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2017, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years. \n\nFlagship luxury sedans are technological showcases for a brand, and that’s certainly what the redesigned 7 Series is for BMW. From the things you can’t see (like its weight-saving construction) to high-tech safety features (and dubious technology like gesture-based controls), the 7 Series shows BMW’s latest thinking and gives us a peek at what might be in store for future versions of its other cars.\n\nThe 2016 7 Series is offered only in long-wheelbase form, and its overall length stretches to nearly 207 inches. The 740i is powered by a 320-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder engine, while the 750i features a 445-hp, turbocharged 4.4-liter V-8. Rear-wheel drive is standard on both models, and BMW’s xDrive all-wheel-drive system is a $3,000 option. The all-wheel-drive 750i we tested had a starting price of $98,395, including a $995 destination charge, but optional features pushed its as-tested price to a heady $128,445.\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nThe 7 Series looks the part of a flagship luxury sedan, with its imposing size and low-slung proportions. The car has serious street presence. That said, its updated styling doesn’t stray far from the design direction established by its predecessor. The most significant differences are in front; the headlights are narrower and BMW’s signature twin-kidney grille is wider. Thinner taillights complement the restyled front end.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nAs BMWs have become more refined and luxurious in recent years, they’ve lost some of the qualities that made them favorites of driving enthusiasts, but the 750i reverses that trend for the brand’s largest car. The 750i is about the same size as its predecessor, but the all-wheel-drive version’s 4,610-pound curb weight is 190 pounds less than before. The lower curb weight comes through in the driving experience; the 750i feels nimble and not as big as its substantial dimensions. In this way, it’s reminiscent of the Jaguar XJ, which is more engaging to drive than most full-size luxury sedans.\n\nOur test car benefited from a $4,100 Autobahn package, which adds an active suspension and active steering. The active suspension includes adjustable anti-roll bars that allow additional suspension travel while driving straight and less travel when cornering to reduce body roll. Meanwhile, active steering can turn the rear wheels in the opposite or same direction as the front wheels depending on speed, to improve cornering performance and high-speed stability, respectively.\n\nThe all-wheel-drive 750i is also quick; BMW cites a zero-to-60-mph time of 4.3 seconds. Pressing the gas pedal part of the way down while cruising on the highway brings a quick downshift from the eight-speed automatic transmission and a surge of power for passing slower-moving traffic. Pushing the pedal all the way to the floor makes the hood rise as the car crouches over the rear wheels and lunges forward. It’s impressive.\n\nThe sedan’s size becomes more evident if you drive it hard through a corner, where body roll materializes, but I like how BMW has tuned the steering; it’s direct and precise, and the wheel turns with a light touch. Steering feedback, however, is mostly absent, and I’d welcome some when the car is in Sport mode.\n\nBesides Sport, there are also two Comfort modes, Comfort and Comfort Plus, as well as an Eco Pro mode. In Comfort, gas pedal response is gradual and the air suspension is more forgiving, allowing more body movement, while the engine stop-start system is at the ready. Sport increases gas pedal responsiveness, lowers ride height by 10 millimeters at high speeds, firms the suspension and adopts a more aggressive shift program. The drivetrain feels more eager in Sport, but BMW didn’t go overboard with the mode’s suspension tuning; you feel bumps a little more, but the ride isn’t harsh, even with optional 20-inch wheels and low-profile tires.\n\nThe 750i takes premium gas, and its EPA-estimated fuel economy is 17/25/20 mpg city/highway/combined with rear-wheel drive and 16/25/19 mpg with all-wheel drive. The car’s engine stop-start system is one of the more seamless I’ve tested. The engine starts quickly and smoothly when it’s time to go again, and the feature was pretty active during my testing – even when stopped briefly at a stop sign. (If you prefer, you can deactivate the system by pressing a button below the push-button ignition.)\n\nInterior\n\nThe 750i’s cabin is finely crafted. The interior blends traditional luxury cues, like an optional stitched leather dashboard, with tech features, like a digital instrument panel and BMW’s iDrive multimedia system with a 10.2-inch widescreen display.\n\nIt’s also a comfortable place to let the miles pass by. The 20-way power front seats are big, comfortable and finished in leather, and they can be fitted with an optional massager.\n\nAs comfortable as the big front bucket seats are, the backseat is just as appealing. With 44.4 inches of rear legroom, there’s plenty of space to stretch your legs and good thigh support for taller passengers. Options like power-adjustable seat cushions, a massaging function, power window shades and a dual-screen entertainment system make it one of the most comfortable and luxurious rear seats I’ve sat in that wasn’t from Rolls-Royce or Bentley.  \n\nI’m not a fan, however, of the 7 Series’ new silver-colored and glass-like buttons on the dashboard, center console and elsewhere. BMW has used black dashboard buttons with white lettering for years, and even though the new ones have an upscale appearance, it’s harder to tell what they do. The lettering on the silver buttons is hard to read in the daytime, and reflections can make the console’s glass-like buttons difficult to read.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nThe 750i gets the latest version of BMW’s iDrive multimedia system. iDrive’s primary interface remains a console knob controller surrounded by shortcut buttons, but the dashboard display is now also a touch-screen, providing another way to make selections.\n\nThe 7 Series also features gesture recognition, which BMW calls a world-first for a production car. With the feature, making various hand gestures in the air in front of the dashboard lets you accept or decline incoming calls, adjust stereo volume and, in models with the optional surround-view camera system, rotate a virtual image of the car on the dashboard screen to get a better view of your immediate surroundings.\n\nIt was hard for me to get the system to recognize some gestures, but while that could improve with more practice, the larger issue is that gesturing doesn’t necessarily make your life in the car any easier. To turn up the stereo volume, for instance, there are already easy-to-use controls on the steering wheel and dashboard. It may be a good way to impress your friends, but it’s not something I’d want to deal with day in and day out.\n\nAs of publication, iDrive doesn’t support Apple CarPlay or Android Auto smartphone mirroring. It wasn’t hard to pair my iPhone using Bluetooth, and the system recognized my phone when connected via the USB port. Wireless charging (of phones that support it) is standard, but we found the vertical pocket under the center armrest to be one of the least convenient places for the feature, frustrating any attempt to grab the phone for quick use (though that could be a safety advantage).\n\nThe optional surround-view camera system lets you see different views in the dashboard screen, including one that lets you rotate around a virtual image of the 7 Series from a perspective of a few feet away rather than the common top-down view, which is the default. The images from the various cameras have been stitched together relatively seamlessly to create this virtual view, but just like the car’s gesture controls, it feels a little superfluous; most of the time, the most important thing when maneuvering is how close your bumpers are to another car or object, and there are other camera views that better relay that info.\n\nBMW offers an optional 7-inch Android tablet that stores in a holder in the rear center armrest. The tablet has controls for the seats, cabin lights, air conditioning, and navigation and multimedia systems. You can also browse the internet.\n\nCargo & Storage\n\nThe 18.2-cubic-foot trunk includes a standard pass-through to the cabin for carrying long, skinny items. The trunk lid is powered and includes foot-activated, hands-free operation.\n\nSafety\n\nExpensive luxury sedans like the 750i aren’t normally crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. In fact, IIHS has never published test results for the 7 Series.\n\nA backup camera is standard. There are a lot of active-safety and autonomous driving features available for the 2016 750i. They include blind spot warning, rear cross-traffic alert, lane departure warning and prevention, forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking and pedestrian detection, adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability, cross-traffic warning and traffic jam assistant.\n\nWith traffic jam assistant, you can press a button on the steering wheel and the 750i will steer itself to stay in its lane. The system had no trouble following highway lane markings on an overcast day, and another editor was impressed with its lane recognition when driving into sunlight, a situation that has a tendency to trip up these kinds of systems. You have to keep at least one hand on the wheel, however, or the steering assistance will cease after about 10 seconds. Night vision with pedestrian and animal detection costs $2,300. The system projects a black-and-white video image on the dashboard screen and highlights pedestrians and large animals in yellow when they’re present.\n\nFor a full list of safety features, see the Features & Specs page.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nThe 750i’s starting price is similar to the S-Class, and while the A8 and XJ have lower starting prices, all four cars can cost well above $100,000 in certain configurations. Cadillac’s new CT6 is even less expensive, but its driving manners and interior space make it feel more like a BMW 5 Series challenger than a 7 Series competitor.\n\nOverall, the 2016 750i is the rare full-size luxury sedan that rewards both the driver and passengers in equal measure. It’s nimble and quick, and its expansive and luxuriously appointed backseat is downright rejuvenating. Perhaps that’s what you’d expect from this corner of the car market, but really this BMW is more of an exception than the rule.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 BMW 7 Series?\n\nThe 2019 BMW 7 Series is a full-size luxury sedan that seats up to five. The lineup consists of the six-cylinder 740i and the V-8-powered 750i. An M performance version is also available, as is an Alpina B7 performance model. A plug-in hybrid 740e is also available; it features all-wheel drive and pairs a turbocharged four-cylinder engine with an electric motor.\n\nThe 740i and 750i are available with rear- or all-wheel drive. The M760i has all-wheel drive, as does the B7. Competitors include the Mercedes-Benz S-Class, Audi A8 and Lexus LS. An updated 7 Series debuts as a 2020 model.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2019 BMW 7 Series?\n\nStandard active safety features include blind spot warning, lane departure warning, forward collision warning, pedestrian detection, city collision mitigation and rear cross-traffic alert. A one-year trial of Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity is also standard.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 BMW 7 Series Are Most Important?\n\nStandard luxury features include an air suspension, a power trunk lid, soft-closing doors, a panoramic moonroof, a power rear sunshade, four-zone automatic air conditioning and a digital instrument cluster. Available features include massaging front seats, a head-up display and a 360-degree camera system.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 BMW 7 Series?\n\nThe 7 Series is nimble, quick and comfortable, with a supremely luxurious interior. The car’s ability to recognize certain gestures is a bit gimmicky, but with so many versions from which to choose, you should be able to find a 7 Series that’s right for you.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in August 2010 about the 2010 BMW 750Li xDrive. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2012, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the three model years.\n\nAs the 2010 7 Series ebbs into the 2011 with few changes, I spent some time driving the 750Li xDrive. That’s BMW’s long-wheelbase, all-wheel-drive version of its flagship sedan.\n\nWhile I was impressed with the standard-length 750i with rear-wheel drive, the 750Li’s added length and weight sapped any excitement from the driving experience.\n\nLuckily, backseat passengers are cocooned in a level of automotive opulence you don’t routinely find under the six-figure mark.\n\nAs a person who routinely chauffeurs and rarely rides in the backseat, I couldn’t recommend any car that so heavily favors the rider instead of the driver.\n\nWhat Li Gets You\nI’m not sure who will be shopping for a long-wheelbase 7 Series. Overseas, they’re the executive car of choice, allowing busy CEOs a space to decompress between board meetings. Perhaps there are enough of these power brokers in the U.S. as well, because I can’t imagine any affluent parent wanting to pamper even the most spoiled child with backseat digs that are far superior to the driver’s in terms of plushness and technological gadgetry.\n\nMy test car had option packages checked off en masse. Besides the somewhat pedestrian seat-mounted dual LCD screens that can play a variety of media sources, from DVDs to iPods, there are automatic sunshades on the windows so you can watch a movie even when it’s sunny. No matter what you’re doing back there, though, the seats are what transform a ride in the 750Li into a luxurious undertaking.\n\nOur tester had upgraded rear seats with ventilation, electronic adjustment and a massage feature. Yes, massaging seats. The giant head restraints felt softer than the four pillows I use in my bed. If I had to be chauffeured cross-country, I think I’d be just fine back there.\n\nDriving\nI’d feel a bit bad for the driver on that trip, though. While the 400-horsepower, turbocharged 4.4-liter V-8 engine is relatively sprightly in the 750i, I thought it was a bit of a laggard while towing all the additional weight that comes with the 750Li’s longer wheelbase and xDrive all-wheel-drive system hardware. All of the driving comfort Mike Hanley mentioned in his review of the 2009 750i is still there, but I found the experience a bit numbing. That may be good for some large luxury sedans, but probably not ones adorned with the letters B, M and W.\n\nThe front seats are nearly as comfortable as the rear ones, but the massage feature works just your thighs — and buttocks, I must add — to keep the driver alert.\n\nIt’s not a pleasant sensation.\n\nCargo\nThe trunk is decently sized, but not as big as you’d expect in a car this mammoth. At 14 cubic feet, it fit our department’s standard-size golf bags that we test in every car, but my personal oversized bag and modern driver (the club, not the chauffeur) wouldn’t fit lengthwise. That means most foursomes wouldn’t be able to load their gear into the 750Li. The trunk is 2.3 cubic feet smaller than the Mercedes-Benz S-Class’, and it’s a little smaller than the new Jaguar XJL’s trunk, which measures 15.2 cubic feet.\n\nSafety\nThe 750Li is outfitted with a full array of airbags, including front-seat-mounted side-impact airbags, side curtain airbags for both rows, and knee airbags. The previous-generation 7 Series offered rear side-impact airbags, but this one doesn’t. It seems an oversight in a car so focused on addressing the needs of backseat passengers.\n\nAdvanced features — like adaptive cruise control with a collision warning system, blind spot detection, and even a night-vision feature — are optional.\n\n750Li in the Market\nOur 750Li’s as-tested price of $104,000 may make your eyes bulge, but the car is a luxurious limousine that’s still a sizable chunk of change less than a Bentley Continental Flying Spur, which starts at $177,600 — and it’s a lot less ostentatious to boot.\n\nSend David an email",

Offered with rear- or all-wheel drive, the 7 Series is also available in regular- and extended-length versions. The luxury sedan is available with four or five seats and is powered by a six-cylinder engine in the 740i and ActiveHybrid 7, a V-8 in the 750i, and a V-12 in the 760i. There’s also a performance-oriented V-8-powered Alpina B7.\nNew for 2013\nThe 740i and 750i now have an eight-speed automatic transmission, and the drivetrains include fuel-saving stop-start technology.
