      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 BMW X4?\n\nThe BMW X4 is a five-seat compact luxury SUV with coupe-like styling and four doors. Power comes from a standard 248-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, while the M40i gets a 382-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six with a 48-volt mild-hybrid system that recaptures brake energy. The high-performance X4 M and X4 M Competition get a turbocharged 3.0-liter six-cylinder that’s rated at 473 hp in the standard M model and 503 hp in the Competition version. Every engine works with an eight-speed automatic transmission, and all-wheel drive is standard. Competitors include the Mercedes-Benz GLC-Class and Land Rover Range Rover Evoque.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 BMW X4?\n\nThe X4 was refreshed for 2022 and sees no notable changes this year.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 BMW X4 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nPanoramic moonroof\nPower liftgate\nForward collision warning with city collision mitigation\nNavigation with 12.3-inch touchscreen\nDigital instrument panel\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nHeated steering wheel\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nWireless device charging\nWi-Fi hot spot (data subscription required after trial)\nHarman Kardon surround-sound system\nHead-up display\n360-degree camera system\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nAdaptive suspension\nAdaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability\nLane departure steering assist\nShould I Buy the 2024 BMW X4?\n\nIf you’re looking for a sporty alternative to a traditional compact luxury SUV, the X4 is worth a look thanks to its strong available engines and athletic handling. You pay a lot for it, however, and get less utility for your money given the chunk of space that raked roofline takes out of the cargo area.",

      "expert_review": "BMW announced the 2022 X4 has been updated alongside its fraternal twin, the X3 with which it shares most of its DNA. Although the two models are similar in their underpinnings, performance and technology features, the X4 is the sportier sibling thanks to its coupelike exterior that sits lower and wider than the X3. For 2022, the BMW X4 gets refreshed styling, tech improvements, a mild-hybrid system for the M40i model and an enhanced performance-focused M model.\n\nRelated: 2022 BMW X3 Lineup Adds Electrification, Torque, Technology\n\n1.   Fresh Face and Rear\n\nThe 2022 BMW X4 gets styling tweaks to its front and rear end including a new grille design, updated bumpers, headlights and taillights. The X4 sports an aluminum mesh variant of BMW’s signature kidney grille that grows larger in the refresh. While the grille is enlarged, the X4’s LED headlights shrink to become 0.4 inches thinner, and a redesigned front bumper with vertical air intakes completes the face-lift.\n\nThe rear of the BMW X4 is updated with redesigned full-LED taillights with integrated horizontal turn signal bars, vertical air intakes arranged in a triangular design and new sportier exhaust trim.\n\nThe BMW X4 M40i gets some unique exterior elements to emphasize its performance leanings. The front bumper sports a large opening to help cool the engine, transmission and brake system. Aerodynamic features include air breathers on the front fenders and the M-exclusive exterior mirrors that reduce air resistance. The BMW X4 M40i also gets a new rear bumper with an anvil-shaped insert and a high-gloss black rear spoiler.\n\n2.   Refined Infotainment and Safety Tech\n\nFor 2022, BMW updates the X4 with a free-standing central control display borrowed from its 4 Series stablemate. Standard on the X4 is BMW’s Live Cockpit Professional that features a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster and a touchscreen display of the same size. Infotainment is updated with BMW’s latest iDrive 7 multimedia system that comes with enhanced navigation, media content, status displays for the driver-assistance systems and a 3D view.\n\nAn updated Driving Assistant Professional Package enhances the X4’s driver-assist technology suite that includes adaptive cruise control with stop and go, and an active lane-keeping assist system. The lane-keeping system is now able to recognize necessary lane changes as part of the navigation guidance and will indicate the need for a lane change. The driver can then carry out the lane change with the help of the lane assist. BMW’s Parking Assistance Package also adds a backup assistant feature to navigate tight spaces.\n\n3.  New Mild-Hybrid System \n\nThe 382-horsepower BMW X4 M40i gains a 48-volt mild-hybrid system for 2022, helping it recuperate brake energy. When the accelerator pedal is released, the generator converts the kinetic energy into electricity, which is stored in the battery. The energy from the 48-volt battery is then used to supply the electrically operated vehicle functions and generates additional drive power. The 48-volt starter generator supports the combustion engine for optimized efficiency and creates up to 11 hp for improved acceleration.\n\nThe mild-hybrid system also helps improve the comfort of the stop-start system in the M40i, according to BMW, thanks to reduced vibration. The system allows the combustion engine to be switched off when the vehicle’s speed drops below 9 mph, and a gliding function lets the engine switch off completely between speeds of 15-99 mph.\n\n4.  M Is for ‘More Torque’\n\nThe BMW X4 M and X4 M Competition are the SUV’s performance variants. With its turbocharged 3.0-liter engine, the current 2021 BMW X4 M puts out 473 hp and 442 pounds-feet of torque, while the M Competition boosts hp to 503 and also makes 442 pounds-feet of torque. The newly tuned engine for 2022 increases the torque output to 457 pounds-feet in the X4 M and 479 pounds-feet in the X4 M Competition.\n\nThe increased torque production lowers the 0-60-mph acceleration time estimates of the X4 M from 4.1 seconds to 3.9 seconds and from 4.0 seconds to 3.7 seconds for the M Competition. Top speed for this model reaches 155 mph, which is increased to 177 mph when an optional M Driver’s Package is added.\n\n2022 BMW X4 | Manufacturer image\nTrims, Pricing and Release Date\n\nThe 2022 BMW X4 xDrive30i is powered by a 248-hp, turbo 2.0-liter engine, and the X4 M40i gets a turbo 3.0-liter to produce 382 hp. Under the hood of the X4 M is a 473-hp six-cylinder, while the X4 M Competition tops the lineup with a 503-hp six-cylinder. The X4 xDrive30i, X4 M40i and X4 M all come standard with all-wheel drive.\n\nProduction for the 2022 BMW X4 begins in August and late summer for the X4 M with a dealership arrival date set for September. The starting price for each model is listed below and includes a $955 destination charge.\n\n2022 BMW X4 xDrive30i: $52,795\n2022 BMW X4 M40i: $63,395\n2022 BMW X4 M: $74,395\n\nMore From Cars.com: \n\nWhat’s New for BMW in 2021?\n2019 BMW X4 M40i Review — Still Nutty, But Easier to Live With\nBMW Makes SiriusXM Standard on All 2021 Models\n2019 BMW X4: 8 Things We Like and 2 Things We Don’t\nMore Luxury Vehicle News\n\nRelated Video: 2020 BMW X1 xDrive28i: Virtual Test Drive\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "While its more formal, upright X3 sibling is all-new for the 2025 model year, the fastback BMW X4 soldiers on basically unchanged for another year. The only updates BMW is making to the compact luxury SUV for 2025 are adding heated front seats as standard equipment and rolling remote start into a pair of option packages. Accordingly, the X4’s base price only climbs $480 from 2024, with the model now starting at $56,475 (all prices include $1,175 destination).\n\nRelated: Which Trim Level of the 2025 BMW X3 Should You Buy?\n\nPowertrain Specs and MPG\n\nBMW offers the X4 with a variety of engines, the most powerful more than doubling the output of the least. Motivating the entry-level X4 xDrive30i is a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that makes 248 horsepower and 258 pounds-feet of torque. The X4 M40i upgrades to a 382-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six generating 369 pounds-feet. A different turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six powers the X4 M; it cranks out 473 hp and 457 pounds-feet in standard guise, but with the Competition Package, output grows to 503 hp and 479 pounds-feet of torque.\n\nRegardless of engine, every X4 has an eight-speed automatic transmission and standard all-wheel drive. The xDrive30i returns an EPA-estimated 21/27/24 mpg city/highway/combined. Thanks in part to 48-volt mild-hybrid assistance, the M40i asks relatively little for its additional 134 hp, returning 22/26/23 mpg. But the M takes a hit, dropping to 15/20/17 mpg for both the standard-output version and Competition Package.\n\nPricing and Availability\n\nThe 2025 BMW X4 is on sale now. Full line pricing is as follows:\n\nxDrive30i: $56,475\nM40i: $67,875\nX4 M: $80,275\nSafety Features and Trim Levels\n\nStandard safety technologies on the 2025 BMW X4 include forward collision alert with automatic emergency braking, lane-centering steering, blind spot monitoring, adaptive cruise control, road-sign recognition, and front and rear parking sensors.\n\nThe X4 xDrive30i rides on 19-inch wheels and features LED exterior lighting, a panoramic moonroof, a power liftgate, rain-sensing windshield wipers, and keyless entry and starting. Inside, it’s upholstered in synthetic leather and boasts power-adjustable and heated front seats, dual-zone automatic climate control, ambient lighting, 12 speakers, and a 10.25-inch touchscreen with navigation, Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and satellite radio.\n\nThe M40i keeps its extra power in check with adaptive dampers and upgraded M Sport brakes with blue calipers. Revised front and rear bumpers and black exterior trim set it apart visually, as do adaptive headlights that turn with the steering wheel and unique interior trim.\n\nIn addition to its tremendous output, the X4 M boasts a sport-tuned adaptive suspension and AWD system, 20-inch wheels, aggressive bumpers at both ends and four exhaust outlets at the back. Its cabin gains sport seats, synthetic leather dash paneling, carbon-fiber interior trim, a unique gauge cluster and a 16-speaker Harman Kardon sound system. The $7,000 Competition Package ups engine output and adds dark exterior accents, the M Sport exhaust system, and M Sport seats and seat belts.\n\nOther than the different engines, BMW doesn’t do trim levels, instead offering numerous packages and stand-alone options across the X4 line. The Driving Assistance Professional Package adds Active Driving Assistant Pro, a hands-on semi-autonomous system that combines adaptive cruise control with lane-centering steering, as well as emergency steering assist and traffic jam assist for hands-off steering below 40 mph. The Parking Assistance Package adds a 360-degree parking camera and semi-automated parking (the X4 will steer itself, but the driver is responsible for operating the gearshift and pedals), while the Premium Package includes a head-up display and heated steering wheel. Stand-alone options include heated outboard rear seats, ventilated front seats, wireless phone charging and the 16-speaker Harman Kardon sound system on the non-M models.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2019 BMW X4: 8 Things We Like and 2 Things We Don’t\n2024 J.D.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 BMW X4?\n\nThe BMW X4 is a five-seat luxury compact SUV with coupelike styling and four doors. Power comes from a standard 248-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, while the M40i gets a 382-hp, turbo 3.0-liter inline-six with a 48-volt mild-hybrid system that recaptures brake energy. The high-performance X4 M and X4 M Competition get a turbo 3.0-liter six-cylinder that’s rated at 473 hp in the standard M and 503 hp in the Competition version. Every engine works with an eight-speed automatic transmission, and all-wheel drive is standard. Competitors include the Land Rover Range Rover Evoque and Mercedes-Benz GLC.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 BMW X4?\n\nFollowing a refresh for 2022, the X4 sees only minor revisions this year, including the removal of infotainment system Gesture Control from an available Premium Package. \n\nWhat Features in the 2023 BMW X4 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\nPanoramic moonroof\nPower liftgate\nForward collision warning with automatic emergency braking\nNavigation with 12.3-inch touchscreen\nDigital instrument panel \n\nAvailable features include:\n\nHeated steering wheel\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nWireless device charging\nWi-Fi hot spot (data subscription required after trial)\nHarman Kardon surround-sound system \nHead-up display\n360-degree camera system\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nAdaptive suspension\nAdaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability\nLane departure steering assist\nShould I Buy the 2023 BMW X4?\n\nIf you’re looking for a sporty alternative to a traditional luxury compact SUV, the X4 is worth a look thanks to its strong available engines and athletic handling. You pay a lot for it, however, and get less utility in return considering the chunk of space the raked roofline takes out of the cargo area.",

      "expert_review": "There once was a time when BMW’s M performance variants graced only a few models, but those days are gone. The latest vehicles to get the M treatment are the X3 and X4 SUVs, whose new M variants — not to be confused with the next-rung-down M40i trim levels — can dispatch 60 mph in as little as 4 seconds flat.\n\nRelated: 2019 BMW X4 Quick Spin: Hot or Not\n\nThat’s if you get the Competition editions, of which the twin-turbo, inline-six-cylinder engines crank out 503 horsepower and 442 pounds-feet of torque apiece. Sans Competition grade, the X3 M and X4 M have the same engine with identical torque but 30 hp less, and it’s good for a 4.1-second sprint to 60 mph — still significantly quicker than the M40i versions of the X3 and X4 (355 hp, 4.6 seconds to 60 mph) but a few ticks slower than the rival Mercedes-AMG GLC 63 and Alfa Romeo Stelvio Quadrifoglio (as low as 3.7 seconds for the Benz and 3.6 seconds for the Alfa).\n\nHorsepower for both models peaks all the way up to 7,200 rpm, and Competition models sustain peak torque to nearly 6,000 rpm, versus 5,600 rpm for the standard M engines. Power reaches the wheels through an eight-speed automatic transmission, which has a gear selector with buttons to toggle between three shift strategies that alter how soon and fast the shifts occur. Standard all-wheel drive sends most power to the rear wheels to maximize balance, while a dual-exhaust system with electronic flaps — continuously variable in the Competition grades — spews its contents out four tailpipes, versus the two in M40i grades.\n\nSelectable driving modes vary myriad characteristics, with a row of buttons on the center console that allow you to mix and match how the steering effort, exhaust note and suspension behave. An M Dynamic mode sends even more power to the rear wheels through a variably locking rear differential.\n\nNaturally, drivetrain enhancements aren’t the only difference. M models have additional front-end bracing, including a strut brace under the hood that bridges the shock towers for increased chassis stiffness. Adaptive shock absorbers are standard, and BMW claims all manner of other unique suspension components for the M SUVs, from bearings and control arms to stabilizer bars and rear bracing. Starting in August, the automaker will offer the shock-tower brace in carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic — the same material used extensively in the i8 supercar — as an option.\n\nTwenty-inch wheels wear P255/45ZR20 tires up front and wider, P265/45ZR20 rubber in back. Competition grades have 21-inch wheels and lower-profile tires, albeit with the same width. Both sets frame enormous, cross-drilled disc brakes: 15.6 inches up front and 14.6 inches in back, or nearly 2 inches larger up front than the X3 M40i’s disks.\n\nVersus the M40i trims, the X3 M and X4 M have rejiggered front bumpers with taller, six-sided center openings flanked by more-tapered side portals. The tails have more body coloring on the lower bumpers versus the M40i SUVs, plus unique liftgate spoilers. The side mirrors sport BMW’s signature M design, each with an extra arm up top. As with the shock-tower brace, BMW will offer certain exterior elements in carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic as an option beginning in August.\n\nInside, the gauges, steering wheel and gear selector have unique M treatments, while the optional head-up display can show a rev indicator with shift lights. The sport seats have M logos, while unique seats with illuminated logos are standard if you get the Competition grades.\n\nIf you’re itching to buy one, expect sales to begin in late spring. Production of the M variants begins in April 2019, and a BMW spokesman told Cars.com that sales usually commence around two months after that.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
