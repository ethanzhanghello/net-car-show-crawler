      "expert_review": "Thanks to James Bond and Neiman-Marcus, the 1996 BMW Z3 was approaching cult status even before it went on sale this spring.\n\nAs Bond, Pierce Brosnan drove an Olympic Atlanta blue version in the movie Goldeneye, and a limited edition of the German-American roadster gleamed in the pages of the 1995 Neiman-Marcus Christmas Book and sold out almost immediately.\n\nBut how will the South Carolina-built Z3 weather the onslaught of two serious competitors due out next year – the Porsche Boxster and the Mercedes-Benz SLK?\n\nWe test-drove the basic $28,750 model – $29,320 including destination charges – without the smoke bombs or stinger missiles.\n\nHe: It took some getting used to, but I think the Z3 has replaced the Mazda Miata at the top of my personal automotive wish list. I’m partial to BMWs anyway, but the Z3 almost feels like it molds itself around your body after the first few outings. You’d never guess most of the stuff under the skin was lifted from the regular 3-series. BMW has struck a nice balance in designing a pretty sophisticated automobile that still manages to evoke the much more primitive British roadsters of the late Fifties and early Sixties.\n\nShe: I didn’t like it.\n\nHe: Figures.\n\nShe: I thought you were going to say the Z3 molds itself around your body like those Bond babes you drool over. Isn’t it interesting that James Bond, a totally sexist anachronism, has become the prototypical Z3 driver? It’s proof that this is a guy car. And if you’re not convinced, just get behind that claustrophobia-producing hooded instrument panel. Yuk. The Z3 is faddish and won’t stand the test of time like the Miata. The only good thing is that the price is affordable – so if you really want one, you won’t be making a total mistake.\n\nHe: Gee, honey, I guess you’ve said it all, huh? I can’t wait to read the latest sack of hate mail from our male readers. Don’t you think you’re kind of missing the point? Not to mention the boat? Of course, this is a guy car. Why else would BMW outfit the Z3 with neat sports-car stuff like gas-pressurized shocks, speed-sensitive steering and Z-rated performance radials? I mention that the Z3 takes some getting used to. When I first climbed into the roadster back in December, it felt like I was sitting too low, and I had a hard time staring over the cowl. That’s before I found out the power seat had a height adjustment. No problem. Once you get things adjusted properly, you really feel at one with the car, especially when you’re flying around some tight, reverse-radius corners on your favorite country road.\n\nShe: You should be writing ad copy for wine coolers. Admit it. You just liked the fact that the Z3 has an available luggage rack with matching suitcase and an optional chrome trim package that lets you deck out the door handles, steering wheel, hand-brake lever and exterior air outlets. And you loved all the attention you got every time you parked it. Last nig ht, there was a crowd of six or seven people around the BMW, checking out the louvered side vents and the clamshell hood, when we came out of the drugstore. The last time that happened was when we test-drove a Hummer.\n\nHe: And you’re going to tell me the Hummer is more your speed, right? With or without the chrome. Hey, I’m not saying the Z3 is perfect. The standard leatherette upholstery is kinda chintzy looking, and the whole cockpit is a little too monochromatic and spartan for my taste. But the whole package somehow just feels right.\n\nShe: I thought the ride felt rough. And coming around a big freeway cloverleaf that was filled with potholes, I had the feeling that the rear-wheel drive Z3 was slipping out from under me, even though I wasn’t going more than 35 mph.\n\nHe: That’s a problem with that light rear end. But the Z3’s relatively modest curb weight also helps performance. I know there’s only a small twin-cam, four-cylinder engine under the hood right now, bu t makes 138 horsepower and 133 lb-ft of torque. That’s more than the Miata, and more than enough zip to make you feel like you’re going places fast. BMW quotes a zero-to-60 time of just over nine seconds with a five-speed manual, but it sure feels quicker than that. Need more gumption? Wait until they bring out the six-cylinder next year. Just don’t expect to get up to 30 miles a gallon in highway driving, like you do with the four.\n\nShe: I would rather have a basic Miata, which is $18,450 and costs about $500 a year less to insure. Even the fancy Miata M edition is cheaper at $24,760, and it just feels more classic and classy than the Z3. Granted, the BMW convertible top is easier to operate because you don’t have to zip out the back window like you do on the Miata. And next year, you’ll be able to get a power-operated roof or an optional hard top on the Z3.\n\nHe: Let’s put things in perspective. You can buy a Z3 now for less than $30,000.\n\nShe: Some of the people who stopped me to ask about the BMW guessed it cost about $80,000.\n\nHe: My point is that when the Porsche and the Mercedes roadsters arrive early next year, they’ll be priced at least $10,000 higher than the BMW. In my book, that makes the Z3 look like a real bargain. And one that’s great fun to drive.\n\nShe: I’d recommend just renting Goldeneye for $3 – and saving yourself $29,317.\n\n1996 BMW Z3\n\nType: Front-engine, rear-wheel drive, two-passenger roadster.\n\nPrice: Base, $28,750; as tested, $29,320 (inc. $570 destination charge).\n\nWhat’s new for ’96: All-new model for ’96.\n\nStandard equipment: Four-wheel power disc brakes, variable-assist power steering, gas-pressurized shocks, 225/50ZR-16 performance radial tires on 16-inch cast-alloy wheels, limited-slip differential, intermittent wipers, power mirrors, cruise control, digital clock, power seats, leatherette upholstery, leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, power windows, air conditioning, AM-FM stereo cassette, dual cupholder, tool kit.\n\nSafety features: Dual front air bags, antilock brakes, traction control (optional).\n\nOptions on test vehicle: None.\n\nEPA fuel economy: 23 mpg city/31 mpg highway.\n\nEngine: 1.9-liter I-4; 138-hp at 6000 rpm; 133 lb-ft torque at 4300 rpm.\n\nTransmission: Five-speed manual.\n\nCompetitors: Mazda Miata.\n\nSpecifications: Wheelbase, 96.3 inches; overall length, 158.5 inches; curb weight, 2690 pounds; legroom, n/a; headroom, 37.6 inches; shoulder room, 51.7 inches.\n\n12-month insurance cost, according to AAA Michigan*: $1,487\n\nRates based on an average family of four from the Livonia area whose primary driver is aged 40 with no tickets who drives 3-10 miles each way to work.

      "expert_review": "Just like you, I’ve wanted to drive this sexy Bavarian treat for a long time. But four cylinders? Hardly seemed worth it.\n\nNow there are six.\n\nTrust me, it’s worth it.\n\nThis car is simply a sexy, shapely pile of sheet metal motivated by a hellishly fun engine. No wonder James Bond gave up his Aston. (OK, maybe it’s not that good, but it is enjoyable.)\n\nSo what else do you get? Ok, here’s the scoop:\n\nWhen you ask for your Z3 with BMW’s juicy 2.8-liter aluminum block in-line six-cylinder, you also get a car with a 2.6-inch wider rear track. You also get a car with a base price of $35,900, about $6,000 more than the four-cylinder.\n\nBut the extra width gives this car a more muscular rear stance, and looks are oh-so-important when it comes to roadsters. True to BMW form, the extra width also aids in traction. To be on the safe side, they also toss in traction control and a limited slip differential, very important for a rear-drive automobile.\n\nSo is it fun?\n\nWell, yeah.\n\nWhat else would you expect? This is, after all, a BMW. The steering is quick and sharp, although it’s easy for the rear end to shake loose over bumpy pavement. Otherwise, this tail stays planted. The engine makes a wonderful racket, with a mechanical melody that will have you shutting off the audio system.\n\nBut is it unusually fun?\n\nAlmost any BMW is really fun to drive, so most BMW loyalists won’t be surprised. That’s not to say this isn’t fun to drive — any roadster with this much power (189 horsepower in a 2,932-pound car) would be fun.\n\nThe engine itself has variable valve timing, meaning it adjusts the timing depending on engine speed. Power is strong from initial throttle application. From zero, 60 is just 6.3 seconds away. If that sounds fast, it is. Ordering the six means a weight penalty of only 143 pounds. But it also means the battery gets moved to the rear, to help preserve BMW’s traditional 50/50 front/rear weight distribution.\n\nOK, so it’s fun to drive. Does it pamper, too?\n\nNot as much as you’d expect, but who cares? Remember, you’re here to drive. That’s the message that comes across loud and clear.\n\nWhereas certain competitors might try to cram a lot of the traditional luxo-gear into their sportsters, BMW eschews such gimmickry.\n\nThis even extends to the top. It’s not lined and has a plastic rear window. Any power to put it up and down will be supplied by the driver or passenger. Wind buffeting is as it should be in a convertible — you’ll arrive with coiffure sculpted by the wind.\n\nBut if you really feel the need to be hedonistic, options such as heated seats, an on-board computer, chrome interior trim and heated mirrors are available as options.\n\nMore important are the tire upgrades: With the six-cylinder, one can obtain 225/ 45ZR-17 front and rear performance radial tires. Sixteen-inch tires are standard.\n\nStopping is as good as going, and it doesn’t get any better than this. Stops are short, straight and trouble-free.\n\nThe build quality of this car was of the typical Teutonic variety. It had a stout body, with little chassis flex. The plastics inside seemed a little more durable than luxurious. Trunk space was about as small as you’d expect. If you want cargo space in a convertible, saw the roof off your minivan.\n\nIs there any downside to owning this car? Only if you don’t like being stared at.\n\nAnd that brings me to my final thought.\n\nIf James Bond is a secret agent, why doesn’t he drive a stealth car? He’s always piloting cars that stand out.\n\nBut those Bond films never make any sense. Neither do roadsters.\n\nBoth are really, really fun. BMW Z3 2.8 Standard: 2.8-liter in-line six-cylinder engine, five-speed manual transmission, variable assist power steering, four-wheel-disc brakes with anti-lock, traction control, limited slip differential, 225/50ZR-16 performance radial tires, specialf ont spoiler, intermittent speed-sensitive wipers, dual power outside mirrors, illuminated master key, cruise control, four-way power driver’s and passenger’s seats, wood shift knob, power windows with one-touch operation and closing, climate control, manual top, AM/FM stereo radio/cassette with six speakers and anti-theft, pre-wiring for CD changer-cellular phone-keyless entry, dual cup holders, coin holder, tool kit in spare tire compartment. Available options: Sub-woofer, leather interior, chrome interior trim, heated seats, on-board computer, heated outside mirrors with washer jets, special paint, 17-inch tires, four-speed automatic transmission.

      "expert_review": "BMW Z3 M COUPE\n\nIt’s an ugly car — a snouty thing with a humped back, a motorized cartoon on fat, 17-inch rear wheels.\n\nIt’s uglier than the Gremlin and the Pacer, metallic abominations produced in the waning years of the now-defunct American Motors Corp. It’s so ugly, people howl and point at it. It’s the 1999 BMW M Coupe.\n\nBut it’s a curious form of derision. People condemn it at first sight. Then they walk around it, touch it, sit in it and ask for a ride. Bolder types beg to get behind the wheel, which they are reluctant to relinquish after short drives.\n\nThey are transformed by the experience, and some are transfixed as well. Suddenly, the M Coupe becomes hip, cool, phat (pretty, hot and tempting), different.\n\nTrue story: A Northern Virginia police officer pulled me over. I was not speeding or doing anything illegal. I was beginning to get huffy when the officer approached the M Coupe laughing.\n\n“What do you think? How does it drive? How do you like it?” the officer asked. He had read about the M Coupe in an auto magazine. “This is the first one I’ve seen on the road. It’s nice — but it’s ugly,” the officer said.\n\nBMW wanted a standout car in the development of the M Coupe, and it got what it wanted. Despite its looks, or, perhaps, because of them, the car was an attention magnet. But driving it . . . ahhh.\n\nThere are moments behind the wheel when you know you’re driving something special. The sublime tightness of it, the quickness, the way it turns corners, moves into curves. You shift gears, press the accelerator. And if the car is talented, obedient, it responds precisely, rhythmically, turning your drive into a dance along the road, which is what happened in the M Coupe.\n\nWas it my imagination? Or was the M Coupe superior in ride and feel to the BMW Z3 roadster, from which the M Coupe is derived? Both are front-engine, rear-wheel-drive cars. Both are two-seaters equipped with in-line six-cylinder engines. Both come with five-speed manual transmissions.\n\nThe essential difference is the fixed hardtop roof on the M Coupe and its small, station-wagon-type rear cabin, which is equipped with a net to keep rear cargo from moving forward.\n\nFixed-roof cars offer certain advantages over their ragtop counterparts, and the most distinctive advantage is rigidity. The more rigid a car, the better its handling. Coupled with that rigidity is a wonderful lightness of being — the M Coupe weighs 3,131 pounds, 133 pounds more than the Z3 roadster. But that’s relatively light weight, considering the power chosen to move it. The M Coupe’s 3.2-liter, 24-valve in-line six-cylinder engine is designed to produce 240 horsepower at 6,000 rpm and 236 pound-feet of torque at 3,800 rpm. It’s like piloting a rocket-powered pencil.\n\nI ended the week vowing never again to make appearance-based judgments. I mean, hey, if ugly feels this good, I want more of it.\n\n1999 BMW Z3 M Coupe\n\nComplaints: On the one hand, I commend BMW for in troducing some practicality into the Z3 roadster line via the M Coupe. It’s nice to be able to carry more than a lunch bag and briefcase on a two-day trip. On the other hand, that humped back rear is so oddly shaped, it completely destroys the lines of the car. Not to mention that rear cargo in the little car tends to ride high, obscuring rear vision.\n\nPraise: The term “driver’s car” has been used so much, it has lost all meaning. But the M Coupe goes a long way toward restoring the definition. It is a car so single-minded in purpose and design, so dedicated to pleasing whoever is behind the wheel, it is a true driver’s car. One passenger can go along for the ride, but that poor soul will likely exit the car overwhelmed by jealousy.\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: Excellent ride. Rocket acceleration, zero to 60 mph in 5.3 seconds. Superior handling. The M Coupe practically sticks to curves. Four-wheel independent suspension system with arc-shaped lower arms, coil springs, twin-tu be ga s-pressure shocks andanti-roll bar up front; semi-trailing arms, coil springs, twin-tube shocks and anti-roll bar in the rear. Excellent braking. Brakes include power four-wheel discs with antilocks.\n\nHead-turning quotient: How many ways can you say “ugly”?\n\nCapacities: Two passengers; nine cubic feet of cargo volume; 16.4 gallons of required premium unleaded gasoline.\n\nSafety: Side-impact air bags included along with usual driver/front-passenger bags. But, hey, folks, this is a little car. Those bags, when used with seat belts, provide a reasonable margin of safety. But it’s unreasonable to believe that the M Coupe or any other small car will come out ahead in a crash with something substantially larger.\n\nSound system: Eight-speaker AM-FM stereo radio and cassette with compact disc player. A Harman Kardon job. Excellent.\n\nMileage: About 23 miles per gallon in mostly highway driving. Estimated range 365 miles on usable volume of fuel.\n\nPrice: Base price is $41,800. Dealer invoice on base model is $36,795. Add $570 for the destination charge. Estimate $42,370, excluding taxes and fees.\n\nPurse-strings note: Compare with Porsche Boxster and Chevrolet Corvette.",

      "expert_review": "We took the top down, which wasn’t the brightest thing to do on a day of intense sunlight. But it seemed sacrilegious to drive to the beach in a tight little roadster top up.\n\nWe wanted romance. It was our 33rd wedding anniversary. We wanted to pretend we were somewhere in the south of France taking back roads to the Mediterranean Sea. But time and money required that we settle for southern Delaware and the Atlantic Ocean. That was okay. At least we didn’t have to compromise on the car.\n\nWe drove the 2002 BMW M Roadster, the 315-horsepower version of the BMW Z3. Fun happens when you put that much power into a 3,131-pound car with a 96.8-inch wheelbase. Zooommm, baby! But we mostly zoomed at moderate speeds. That requires a willing suspension of disbelief less than it does an acceptance of reality.\n\nThe roads were crowded. Ours wasn’t the only beach-bound automobile. Besides, there were legions of students heading back to college and boarding schools, their vehicles overloaded with the accoutrements of a softer life at home. Still, there were some happy spaces, including a few nearly vacant stretches along Delaware Routes 30 and 26 moving east. We throttled the M Roadster’s 3.2-liter in-line six-cylinder engine in those places and gloried in the acceleration. In the process, we discovered the car’s raunchier side.\n\nOn the surface, the M Roadster and its similar-bodied Z3 siblings seem sophisticated, classic. Their long noses and short rears honor tradition in European sports-car design. Certainly the M Roadster’s fancy two-tone leather interior and its premium nine-speaker Harman Kardon sound system reek of wealth. But the truth is that the little car is a bare-fisted thug, a street fighter built with the same formula that spawned muscle cars in the United States — big engine, small car, lots of torque and horsepower, hell on wheels.\n\nBMW says the rear-drive M Roadster can do zero to 60 mph in five seconds. We didn’t time the car’s performance. There was no need. The M Roadster left everything in its wake. We stopped the speed-freak foolishness out of sheer embarrassment — and fear. We could see the headlines: “Middle-Aged Couple on Romantic Weekend Wind Up in Jail” and “Distraught Wife Says Husband Made Her Do It.” We slowed down.\n\nThe M Roadster is a road demon because it was built to do nothing more than run, and run well. Its two bucket seats become uncomfortable after a hundred miles. Its wide front track and low ride height help to glue the M Roadster to the road in corners, but the car’s ride height and short wheelbase conspire to brutalize its two occupants on poorly maintained roads. Also, there is little luggage room to speak of — only five cubic feet in the trunk and virtually nothing usable in the passenger cabin.\n\nBut those deficits are to be expected in a true roadster. Such cars are built for those of us who are poets, dreamers and lovers — peopl e who embrace the idea of driving with the wind in their hair even if that hair is turning gray.",

      "expert_review": "The roadster, perhaps the purest form of sports car, endures, even as it seems to be ceaselessly tweaked. Take the latest version of the “entry level” drop top in BMW’s Z3 stable, the 2.5i. We have come a long way from the days of the beautiful 507.\n\nWhen last we tested a 2.5, it was called a 2.3 – a complication of nomenclature that belied the fact that the 2.3 did, in fact, have a six-cylinder, 2.5-liter engine. That one produced 170 horsepower and was a respectable little zipster on the road.\n\nIt sure was an improvement on the original four-cylinder, 1.9-liter engine it replaced. Now comes the 2.5i engine, tweaked to produce 184 horsepower. It’s not the M Coupe, but what is?\n\nThe result is that the 2.5i is quite zippy on the highway, fast as you need to go on country lanes, and capable of turning 0 to 60 miles per hour in under 7 seconds. And it is fun to drive, with its short-throw five-speed manual transmission remaining crisp and precise up and down the gears. A five-speed Steptronic automatic transmission is an option.\n\nThis is not a car that will run with the Porsche Boxster S or the Honda S2000, but if you’re looking among the Toyota MR2, the Mazda Miata, or the Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder, this car, even at a few thousand dollars more, ought to be on your to-check list.\n\nThe changes since the 2.3 are mostly engineering changes, which means that the muscular front, with its humped fenders, remains. Also surviving are the great rise and flare that was added to the rear, an aesthetic improvement on the angular box of the original car.\n\nAgain, it is no rocket, but it is very quick. Start to 80 miles per hour comes very quickly – and arrives to the accompaniment of a burbling exhaust note. A downshift on the highway from fifth to fourth turns the Z3 into a frolicking accelerator, able to scoot nimbly through traffic as it handles lane changes in a stiff, sure manner.\n\nOn back roads, just as its predecessor performed, it clung as if it were stuck to rails, exhibiting little body roll and virtually no evidence of body torque often found in convertibles.\n\nHaving just emerged from a couple of larger convertibles that shook, rattled, and rolled more than I could live with, this was refreshing. Even when hitting the stiffest of bumps, cowl shake, while evident, was well dampened.\n\nThe suspension features gas struts up front, semi-trailing arms and shocks in the rear, and antiroll bars in both places, and gives the car the stiffness you expect and need in a quick little sports car. Add to this Dynamic Stability Control, which uses engine power and braking to control wheel slippage, ABS, and a limited slip differential, and you have an easy car to control.\n\nThat said, I still do not think this is the ideal car for winter driving. It is rear-wheel-drive and a little too quick with those rear wheels to perform well in the snow.\n\nIt also sits quite low to the ground, so getting to the ski house could be problematic on a snowy night. Not that you could carry your skis and gear anyway. Interior space is minimal – none behind the seats – with shallow bins in the doors and a center console bin that would hold a cellphone only because technology has shrunk the phones. The trunk would hold no more than a pair of gym-bag-size travel cases.\n\nIn the months you can travel effortlessly, you will do so in snug, secure comfort. The leather seats plop you down low and wrap you firmly along the legs and up the torso. Cavernous forward space for the legs is an advantage while a somewhat low roof could be a problem for taller drivers.\n\nSafety equipment includes driver and passenger front air bags, door-mounted side air bags, and roll bars.\n\nThe premium and sports packages that came with the test car included 16-inch cross-spoke alloy wheels, leather upholstery, wood trim, and power operation for the convertible top.\n\nIs this the car for the true performance enthusiast? Probably not.\n\nIs it the car f people who want a full-blown classic roadster feel and just a taste of where performance can take them? Absolutely.",

The M is the performance version of BMW’s Z3 roadster.\n\nThe Z3 is powered by a 2.8-liter, 193-h.p. in-line 6 that claims a 6.3-second zero-to-60-m.p.h. time; the M by a 3.2-liter, 240-h.p., 24-valve in-line 6 that claims a 5.2 second zero-to-60-m.p.h. time.\n\nThe 3.2-liter 6 is teamed with a smooth-shifting 5-speed manual (BMW’s 5-speed automatic is not available) that helps the roadster come alive.\n\nDespite the focus on performance, fuel economy is a respectable 19 m.p.g. city/26 m.p.g. highway.\n\nBut where the M roadster stands out is in handling and the ability to sit flat in the sharpest twists in the road.\n\nYou spring into and out of the passing lane. The suspension literally nails the roadster to the road.\n\nThe M’s handling is probably beyond the limits of most drivers.\n\nIt helps that the M roadster comes with all-season traction assist for stability on slippery surfaces and a limited-slip differential for improved traction on dry roads for optimum handling, along with 17-inch high-performance radial tires and four-wheel independent suspension with anti-roll bars and anti-dive/squat geometry.\n\nThere is, of course, a price to pay for the remarkable handling, and that’s the more-than-gentle slap on your behind every time you pass over a tar mark in the road.\n\nAnd any time you make a lateral or sideways move, the M roadster seems to be locked onto tracks.\n\nBut when cruising over the open straightaways, you sometimes feel as if strapped into the Eagle roller coaster at Six Flags.\n\nThere are some other annoyances and gripes, mostly with the design of the power top, which is solid and doesn’t quiver in the wind, but wraps so far around the sides that any attempt at backing out of a parking space should be done in slow motion — with a friend directing you.\n\nEasy problem to solve, of course: Just put the top down, which also solves the other problem of headroom in this petite roadster.\n\nOne other gripe: the rearview mirror is large and sits at just about eye level. The inside mirror is important because the top as well as the rather small sideview (heated) mirrors limit side and rear vision. But its placement on the windshield creates a blind spot when it comes to vehicles pulling from a driveway or approaching from the right at an intersection.\n\nThe 2000 M roadster starts at $42,700.\n\nStandard equipment includes power heated seats, heated driver’s door lock and windshield washer jets, leather upholstery, power windows, air conditioning, front- and side-impact air bags, power locks and fixed rollover bars behind the seats.\n\nAnd, perhaps as a concession to 007, the secret agent whose task has become to introduce a BMW on the screen every two years, there’s dual beverage holders to prevent the contents from being shaken or stirred.\n\nThe only options on the test car were a CD radio at $200 and a $570 freight charge.",
