      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 BMW 5 Series?\n\nThe BMW 5 Series is a five-seat, mid-size luxury sedan that competes with rivals like the Acura TLX, Audi A6, Genesis G80 and Mercedes-Benz E-Class. The entry-level 530i is powered by a 255-horsepower, turbocharged four-cylinder that sends power to the rear wheels via an eight-speed automatic transmission. The 530i xDrive employs the same turbo four-cylinder but adds all-wheel drive. The 540i xDrive comes with a 375-hp, turbo 3.0-liter inline-six, AWD and the eight-speed gearbox. New for 2025 is the 550e xDrive plug-in hybrid, which uses the same turbo 3.0-liter six-cylinder but adds an electric motor for a total output of 483 hp and an EPA-estimated electric driving range of 34 miles.\n\nThe 2025 model year also marks the return of the high-performance M5, which is now offered as a Touring wagon in addition to a sedan. It comes standard with a PHEV powertrain that pairs a twin-turbo 4.4-liter V-8 with an electric motor for a total output of 717 hp. The M5 accelerates from 0-60 mph in about 3.5 seconds and has a BMW-estimated electric driving range of 25 miles.\n\nBMW also offers an all-electric version of the 5 Series called the i5. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 BMW 5 Series?\n\nThe 5 Series was redesigned for 2024 and sees little change for 2025 other than the addition of the 550e xDrive and M5.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 BMW 5 Series Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n14.9-inch touchscreen\n12.3-inch digital instrument cluster\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nWireless charging pad\nNavigation \nSatellite radio\nTwo USB ports\nWi-Fi hot spot\nKeyless entry\nMoonroof\n12-speaker Harman Kardon stereo\nSynthetic leather upholstery\nHeated front seats\nBlind spot warning \nRear cross-traffic alert\nAutomatic high beams\nLane departure warning\nRain-sensing wipers\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nVoice and gesture controls\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated rear seats\nPanoramic glass roof\nBowers & Wilkins audio system\nHeated steering wheel\nPower-operated rear sunshades\nAdaptive cruise control\nEvasive steering assist\nHead-up instrument display\n21-inch alloy wheels\nRear-wheel steering\nShould I Buy the 2025 BMW 5 Series?\n\nThe BMW 5 Series is a technical tour de force for car shoppers looking for a powerful and refined mid-size luxury sedan. With so many drivetrains on offer, there’s no shortage of ways to customize a 5 Series, and even the base 530i offers plenty of comfort, safety and tech features. While the 14.9-inch touchscreen is visually impressive, it can be confusing to use, and some menus are overly complicated. BMW fans might also find the 5 Series’ steering lacks the sharpness that’s often associated with the German automaker’s products. Yet for buyers who want to sidestep a larger, bulkier SUV, the 5 Series is a suave and sophisticated choice. The new M5 delivers jaw-dropping performance, but some enthusiasts complain it favors techno-wizardry over true driver engagement.",
