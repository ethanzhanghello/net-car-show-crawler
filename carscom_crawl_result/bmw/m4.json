      "expert_review": "Competes with: Audi RS 5, Lexus RC F, Mercedes-AMG C63\n\nLooks like: We’re really doing this, huh, BMW?\n\nPowertrain: Twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder; 473 horsepower and 406 pounds-feet of torque in base models, 503 hp and 479 pounds-feet in Competition models; six-speed manual (base only) or eight-speed automatic transmission; rear- (base, Competition) or all-wheel (Competition) drive\n\nHits dealerships: March 2021 for base and RWD Competition models; summer 2021 for AWD Competition\n\nBMW announced the redesigned 2021 4 Series coupe in June 2020, while its 3 Series sedan sibling’s updates were announced earlier — much earlier, in fact, when it debuted at the 2018 Paris Motor Show as a 2019 model. But we’ve had to wait until now to see the full-bore M3 and M4 performance versions, which aren’t to be confused with the M340 and M440 models (high-performance, if not highest performance, cars).\n\nRelated: 2021 BMW 4 Series: More Power, More Tech, More Grille, Just … More on the 4\n\nOf note for manual-transmission enthusiasts, the M3 and M4 will be the only variants of the redesigned 3 Series and 4 Series in the U.S. that offer manual transmissions, BMW confirmed to Cars.com. That should come as welcome, if expensive, news to stick-shift enthusiasts who bemoaned the automatic-only approach when the German automaker announced both cars’ redesigns.\n\nThe 4 Series’ debut included a lot of talk about its front styling, particularly the massive grille openings in BMW’s signature kidney shape. Until now, the 3 Series had avoided such controversial styling …\n\nExterior\n\n… but that’s no longer the case, as the M3 also has a gaping maw. According to BMW, it’s “designed to feed the massive amounts of air needed for fulfilling the cooling requirements under the most rigorous conditions.” Large intakes on either side of the grille provide air to both cars’ coolant radiators and brakes. Slim vertical intakes at the edges of the front bumper, meanwhile, are part of BMW’s Air Curtain system, which is designed to reduce drag and improve fuel consumption.\n\nBoth the M3 and M4 are 4.6 inches longer than their predecessors, with 1.8-inch longer wheelbases than the previous M cars. Width and height grow a smidge on each car, up less than an inch all around. Flared fenders help accommodate wide tires and the wider front track, which is up 1.5 inches on both cars. Up front, the tires are about 10.8 inches wide, while the rears are 11.2 inches. Wheel size is staggered, with 18-inchers up front and 19s in back as standard equipment; Competition models have 19s and 20s, respectively.\n\nFront- and rear-bumper aerodynamic bits join with aggressive side sills to create a ring of gloss-black aero around each car, a nod to the first-generation E30 M3. Slim LED headlights are standard, and both adaptive LED lights with BMW’s Laserlight and dark-accented Shadowline headlights are optional.\n\nStandard on the new M3 and M4 is a roof made of carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic, or CFRP, though a moonroof (and a steel roof surrounding it) is a no-cost option. More carbon fiber is available as part of the M Carbon Package, which gets new front intake inlays, rear diffuser, mirror caps and a rear spoiler — the final item in CFRP. The Shadowline Package adds darkened exterior accents and is optional on the base M3 and M4; it’s standard on Competition versions, but BMW says it can change them back to body-color elements for shoppers who don’t want the look.\n\nInterior\n\nNew M sport seats in Merino leather feature M-specific perforations and model badging. For the first time in the M3 and M4, seats also can be had with ventilation. Those in search of a racier look can opt for the M Carbon front bucket seats, which still offer power adjustment but shave 21 pounds. The buckets can also be set to a lower seating position than the sport seats; they feature additional bolstering and can accommodate a racing harness instead of the standard shoulder belt.\n\nMore carbon fiber is available inside as an option, replacing the standard aluminum trim. It also adds carbon-fiber inlays to the steering wheel and, on Competition models, adds carbon-fiber shift paddles. The steering wheel and gear selector are each wrapped in leather, and the engine stop-start button and steering-wheel-mounted M mode selector buttons have red accents.\n\nThe instrument panel is a 12.3-inch fully digital display, and to its right is a 10.25-inch touchscreen that operates the latest version of BMW’s iDrive infotainment system. Wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are standard.\n\nPowertrain and Acceleration Times\n\nBase models of both cars get BMW’s S58 twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder that debuted in the X3 M and X4 M SUVs. It’s good here for 473 horsepower, 48 hp more than the last M3 and M4, and 406 pounds-feet of torque. Shoppers can pair that to either a six-speed manual or eight-speed automatic transmission. Base models are rear-wheel drive only, and the manual is the only three-pedal setup in any 3 Series or 4 Series for the U.S. market. (That’s not the case globally, as you can still get a manual 3 Series overseas).\n\nUpgrade to the M3 or M4 Competition, and the six-cylinder pumps out 503 hp (59 hp more than the last Competition) and 479 pounds-feet (73 pounds-feet more), but it only pairs with the eight-speed automatic. At launch, the Competition will only be available as a rear-drive model, but an AWD version — a first for the M3 and M4 — will follow. That AWD system offers three driving modes: 4WD (which is to say, AWD) for regular driving, 4WD Sport for more enthusiastic occasions, and a 2WD mode that offers true RWD driving but also turns off the stability control. Competition models also get an additional transmission oil cooler to improve the car’s ability to cool down during hard driving.\n\nBMW says base models will accelerate from 0-60 mph in 4.1 seconds with the manual, while the automatic-equipped Competition can sprint to 60 in 3.8. That sounds conservative; in our measured testing of the 2020 M340i at a drag strip, we managed to do 0-60 in 3.89 seconds — in a car that weighs roughly the same but is rated at 382 horsepower, or 91 to 121 hp less than the true M cars.\n\nTop speed in both base and Competition cars is limited to 155 mph but can increase to 180 mph if buyers opt for the optional M Driver’s Package, which unlocks the extra 25 mph and provides you with BMW driver training.\n\nThe M3 and M4 have BMW’s traditional selectable drive modes — and an electrically controlled exhaust that changes tune depending on mode — plus M modes. The M modes include Road for basic driving; Sport, which dials back electronic interventions; and, if buyers add the M Drive Professional option, Track. Track has a complicated activation process, so drivers are less likely to turn it by accident on the road because, as its name implies, it’s for track driving. All driver assistance systems are turned off when Track is activated.\n\nThe M3 and M4 come standard with an adaptive suspension and, with the M Drive Professional system, add M Traction Control, which gives the cars’ electronic stability system 10 stages of adjustment.\n\nM Drive Professional also adds what BMW calls the M Drift Analyzer which, as you might have guessed, analyzes your drifting. BMW says it “records the duration, distance covered, line and angle of a drift with a rating shown on the Control Display.” A lap timing function is available, too, and you can further analyze recorded data via an iPhone app.\n\nSafety\n\nStandard safety technologies include BMW’s Active Driving Assistant suite of safety features — things like forward collision warning with pedestrian detection and automatic emergency braking, blind spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, and lane-centering assist — as well as automatic high beams and front and rear parking sensors.\n\nAn optional Driving Assistance Professional Package is available on Competition models and adds features like adaptive cruise control, BMW’s hands-free semi-autonomous Extended Traffic Jam Assist feature, blind spot collision avoidance and evasive steering assist.\n\nA 360-degree camera system and self-parking are available as part of the optional Parking Assistance Package.\n\nPricing and Release Date\n\nIncluding the $995 destination fee, the base M3 starts at $70,895, or $3,400 more than the last-gen 2018 M3. The M4, meanwhile, starts at $72,795 ($2,650 more than a 2020 M4). Upgrading to the Competition version of either car adds an extra $2,900, bringing prices to $73,795 for the M3 and $75,695 for the M4. AWD versions of the Competition will be … more than that, though BMW hasn’t said how much yet.\n\nRear-drive base and Competition cars will be available in March 2021, according to BMW, with the AWD version to follow sometime in the summer.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The 2015 BMW M4 is a car that sets the standard for sport coupes and impresses us with both its performance and its intelligent use of technology.\n  Change is inevitable, both in life and in the automotive world, but it’s not always for the better. Every so often, though, changes really do bring improvements. So it is for the BMW M4.\n  M4 is a new name for 2015, covering redesigned versions of the cars last sold as the 2013 M3 coupe and convertible. Compare the BMW M4 and the previous version of the M3 coupe here.\n  The M4 competes primarily with the Audi RS 5, Cadillac CTS-V coupe and Mercedes-Benz C63 AMG. You can comb through their particulars here.\n  We tested a 2015 BMW M4 coupe with options like a $4,000 Executive Package, a $1,900 Lighting Package, a $2,900 double-clutch automatic transmission, $8,150 carbon-ceramic brakes and a $1,000 adaptive suspension. That brought the total test price to $86,200, including a $925 destination charge.\n  Exterior & Styling  A reworked front bumper with larger air intakes and front air curtains make the front end look busy — there are a lot of fins and flanks up there. On a performance car like the BMW M4, that’s not a bad thing; to me it suggests the car means business.\n  In profile, the M4 is all BMW. There are fairly short overhangs — the distance between the edges of the wheel wells and the ends of the car — and an angular coupe shape. Also of note: With the M4, there is no rear spoiler. BMW achieves the same effect by sweeping up the trunk lid, and that touch is probably my favorite little appearance detail on the car.\n  I’m less certain about the roof. All BMW M4s have a carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic roof to keep weight down. The roof is unpainted, so you get a good look at the carbon-fiber weave. I thought it looked fine on our car — which was painted a light yellow-green color — but I’m not sure how it’d look on, say, the blue, orange or silver choices. A way around this conundrum is to opt for the no-cost moonroof option. You then lose the carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic roof in favor of a steel roof that’s painted the same color as the body. But you also lose the light weight of the carbon fiber.\n  Oh, and a word about the color of our M4: I liked it. Others were overcome by the shade, and my advice to them is this: Chill. It’s just paint, and BMW does have other colors back at the factory. They’ll paint one a different shade for you.\n  What is worth getting worked up over is the fact that the paint — in fact, all metallic paints for the M4 — costs an extra $550. Oh, and seven of the eight colors you can paint your M4 are metallic, so it’s a sneaky little extra charge BMW has put in there that will affect most M4 buyers. Not cool.\n  How It Drives  BMW’s M cars are designed to be the most powerful, best handling versions of their cars. As such, it’s reasonable to approach the M4 expecting a lot. The M4 doesn’t disappoint.\n  For starters, I think the new engine is an improvement. Previous M3 models were powered by a 414-horsepower, 4.0-liter V-8, while the 2015 M4 and M3 get a more powerful 425-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder. The previous V-8 produced a great deal of power, but I always felt like I had to really wind it out to the last rev to get all the power. This new inline six-cylinder just felt like it had more ready power across the range. Whether I was passing at highway speeds, sprinting from light to light or switching between cruising and being more aggressive, I just didn’t find a hole in the power.\n  The sound was also a positive — it had a nice, mean-sounding snarl — but BMW is using the stereo to help out. The M3 and M4 use the audio system at the lower and middle end of the rev range to compensate for the muffling effect of the turbochargers. A dedicated control unit uses rpm, engine load and throttle position as inputs to synthesize engine sound, which is then fed to the audio amplifier.\n  Some people find this approach to be heresy, but I liked the sound of the engine and I don’t really mind that it’s assisted by the stereo. It certainly didn’t sound fake or cartoonishly aggressive. It sounded like performance BMW.\n  Our M4 also stopped with prodigious force and exhibited no discernable brake fade, but I have to think that’s partly thanks to the optional carbon-ceramic brakes. They cost $8,150, and that’s a whopping price. A nice thing about the brakes — aside from their power — is that BMW offers them as a stand-alone option for the M4. Some competitors include upgraded brakes only in option packages.\n  Going and stopping is great, but what makes or breaks a sports car for me is its steering. The whole point of a performance car is to enjoy driving, to revel in the sensation of just piloting the car through turns. If the steering is too light, you lose the communication you’re seeking. If it’s too heavy, it’s just a silly exercise in trying not to wear yourself out.\n  Here, again, BMW finds a sweet spot. I found the steering to be excellent; I was able to put the car exactly where I wanted to and, as a bonus, the steering wheel has a nice chunky feel to it, with a grippy leather cover.\n  There is some technological wizardry that helps the M4 sedan achieve these impressive results. BMW allows you to change many attributes — not only the power-steering assist level, but also the shifting characteristics, engine response and suspension damping (if you’ve purchased the adaptive suspension, which is a $1,000 stand-alone option).\n  At first glance, all this adjustability can seem overwhelming, but in each case there’s a dedicated button for each feature in the cabin, and the changes are all in a three-step range. The steering, for example, can be toggled between Comfort, Sport and Sport Plus settings, where each setting allows a little more feedback — and requires a bit more effort.\n  That same “easy/sportier/sportiest” delineation continues through all parts of the car that BMW lets you adjust, and in each case it’s a simple matter of pressing a button until you see the setting you want on the instrument panel. The best part: Whether it’s the steering or the suspension or whatever, there is a clear distinction between the settings. It’s not a gimmick: It works.\n  BMW also allows you to select each of these settings and then save them in two all-encompassing modes you can activate using preset buttons on the steering wheel, marked M1 and M2.\n  Our BMW M4 came to us with one mode already configured as a full-on-everything Sport Plus, and the other mode was a sedate, everything-set-to-comfort-and-efficiency mode. Over the course of the test, I used these buttons several times an hour in my driving. It was fantastic to be able to change the car to dawdle through town or attack a twisty section of road just by pressing a button.\n  The automatic transmission — a twin-clutch seven-speed automatic — is also adjustable by pressing a button that varies shift quickness. Like the above settings, it’s a three-step adjustment: The higher up the range you go, the faster the shift. The “slowest” shifts still happen quickly enough to be satisfying, and the fastest ones are impressively race-car quick.\n  Technology should make things easier, and the fact that I happily changed modes demonstrates BMW nailed this. I wasn’t flipping between the modes because I was unhappy with how the car was driving, but simply because it was so easy to tune. In other cars, or even the previous M3, I would have probably left the car in one mode and not taken advantage of the ability to make adjustments.\n  But there is a bigger, intrinsic problem with the M4: Its power and handling. Wait, what!?\n  What I mean is that the BMW M4 offers so much power and handling that to really experience it to the fullest, you need a closed course. It’s just so fast, so quick and stops so well, you really shouldn’t be driving it at its fullest capability on public roads.\n  Despite all the power and speed, the M4 sees a jump in its fuel economy compared with the previous V-8 versions. The M4 gets an EPA-estimated 17/26/20 mpg city/highway/combined with the manual transmission and 17/24/19 mpg with the automatic. That’s up from 14/20/16 mpg with either the manual or automatic transmissions with the V-8.\n  Note, too, that those EPA mileage figures are the same whether you opt for the M4 coupe or convertible.\n  As far as its competitors go, the M4 edges ahead of the RS 5’s 18 mpg (combined), and both cars see significant gains over the CTS-V’s 14 mpg and the C63 AMG’s 15 mpg combined ratings.\n  Interior  BMW doesn’t let you forget you’re driving one of its performance-tuned M automobiles. There are badges in the front seatbacks that light up when you enter the car, which look cool. In addition to the sprinkling of M badges and controls, we also had the carbon fiber trim.\n  There is a nit to pick, though: It looks great, but the trim by the gearshift reflected a nasty glare into my eye in direct sunlight — and under every passing streetlight at night. Some form of matte finish would be better there.\n  The M4’s seats are suitably bolstered to hold you in place during aggressive driving, and there was enough adjustment for me to be comfortable. I’m 6-foot 2-inches tall and weigh more than 200 pounds, and I fit great in all dimensions. It’s refreshing that someone still makes a sporty car for the big-and-tall crowd. However, I never felt like I had great visibility out the front of the car in the city. The A-pillar is a bit chunky, and the rearview mirror was in just the right place to obscure my view. Also, it felt like the M4 didn’t have a large windshield from top to bottom. I didn’t exactly feel like I was looking out a mail slot, but I would have loved to have more glass in front of me.\n  I took the car for several long drives and emerged feeling really fresh with no standout complaints. For my money, the best-laid interiors are ones you don’t really think about. They’re just sort of there. So it goes with the M4.\n  Lastly, there’s a nice, fat dead pedal. Having a large, somewhat grippy place to put your left foot is a nice thing.\n  It’s not super easy to climb into the back of the M4, but no worse than any other sport coupe — just fold the front seat forward and plop in. However, since the M4 front seats have fixed headrests, when it comes time to fold the backrest, the headrest will catch on the windshield and not fold back unless you first run the front seat toward the rear of the car. Is that the end of the world? No, but it’s odd.\n  Ergonomics & Electronics  When it comes to the multimedia/navigation electronics, I’m lukewarm overall. The systems did everything I asked of them, and I didn’t need to resort to the owner’s manual. On the other hand, the systems weren’t that intuitive. And some things — such as the knob that you spin to zoom in and out on the navigation system — are just backward.\n  I suspect if I owned the car, familiarity would breed contentment. So while I don’t love BMW’s electronics, I can’t condemn them too strongly.\n  Cargo & Storage  The M4 had a reasonably large trunk for the segment, but it narrows significantly as you go forward. Split-folding rear seats are standard. It’s also worth noting that there is basically no room in the center armrest for storage. I found it was best reserved for a smartphone, keys and maybe a spare thought … but not much else.\n  Finally, as far as trunk space, the cargo room is roughly the same in the M4 as you’ll find in the RS 5, CTS-V and C63 AMG.\n  Safety  The 2015 BMW M4 has not been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. You can check its full complement of safety features here.\n  Safety options include Active Driving Assistant, which encompasses lane departure warning that vibrates the steering wheel when you stray outside of lane lines; frontal collision warning that can brake the car at speeds under 10 mph and pre-load the brakes at higher speeds; and pedestrian warning that uses audible and visual warnings to alert the driver of pedestrians and pre-loads the brakes.\n  Choosing the Executive Package adds many features, including a backup camera and a head-up display. Unlike some cars, the M4’s head-up display vanishes when viewed with polarized sunglasses.\n  Value in Its Class  Our test car was not cheap, at $86,200, and more than $20,000 of that was options.\n  But this class is more about performance than trying to save every last penny. (Though I’m still unimpressed by the $550 extra cost of almost any paint color, as well as the $1,000 for the adaptive suspension that BMW can, and should, include in the price of the car.)\n  Still, in the area of value, I think the BMW M4 is ahead of the competition because it does everything. The RS 5, CTS-V and C65 AMG all come close to what the M4 offers in terms of options, but none offers the full suite.\n  For example, like the M4, the CTS-V offers a choice between a manual or automatic transmission, and though its adaptive suspension is standard, the CTS-V does not offer carbon-ceramic brakes. Likewise, the Mercedes and Audi offer neither the adaptive suspension nor the choice of a manual transmission like the M4 does.\n  So, really, you can sit in front of a computer all night, but even then, you can’t really be sure until you hop in one and drive. Even when you factor in the high price of the options, it’d be hard to fathom there’s something else out there that blends ferocity and drivability as well as the M4.\n\n\n\n     Send Bill an email",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 BMW 4 Series?\n\nThe BMW 4 Series debuted for 2014 as a replacement for the previous-generation 3 Series coupe and convertible. Power comes from turbocharged four- or six-cylinder engines, and rear- and all-wheel-drive versions are available. Competitors include the Audi A5 and Mercedes-Benz C-Class.\n\nWith the same length, width, wheelbase and track as the two-door coupe, but a bit more headroom, the 4 Series Gran Coupe sports a sedan profile. Like the 4 Series coupe and convertible, it’s offered in four-cylinder 430i and six-cylinder 440i form. The high-performance M4 is available as a coupe or convertible and competes with the Cadillac ATS-V and Lexus RC F.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2019 BMW 4 Series?\n\nNavigation with real-time traffic information and a one-year trial of Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity is now standard. The M4 also adds standard parking sensors.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 BMW 4 Series Are Most Important?\n\nBMW’s rear-wheel-drive platform’s handling characteristics have been benchmarked by practically every automaker fielding a luxury sports sedan. Available active safety features include blind spot warning, adaptive cruise control and automatic emergency braking. Other available tech features include a head-up display, a digital instrument panel, wireless device charging and a Wi-Fi hot spot (data subscription required after initial trial).\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 BMW 4 Series?\n\nHandling and braking are 4 Series highlights. The Gran Coupe version offers extra cargo versatility without sacrificing style, while the retractable-hardtop convertible delivers year-round practicality. However, the automatic transmission’s responses during performance driving are lacking, and the car’s stability system is too conservative.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 BMW 4 Series?\n\nThe BMW 4 Series debuted for 2014 as a replacement for the previous-generation 3 Series coupe and convertible. Power comes from turbocharged four- or six-cylinder engines, and rear- and all-wheel-drive versions are available. Competitors include the Audi A5 and Mercedes-Benz C-Class.\n\nWith the same length, width, wheelbase and track as the two-door coupe, but a bit more headroom, the 4 Series Gran Coupe sports a sedan profile. Like the 4 Series coupe and convertible, it’s offered in four-cylinder 430i and six-cylinder 440i forms. The high-performance M4 is available as a coupe or convertible and competes with the Lexus RC F.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 BMW 4 Series?\n\nNew standard active safety features include forward collision warning with pedestrian detection, lane departure warning and city collision mitigation. Rain-sensing windshield wipers are also standard. Trim updates include darkened taillights, a gloss-black grille frame and a new diffuser.\n\nWhat Features in the 2020 BMW 4 Series Are Most Important?\n\nBMW’s rear-wheel-drive handling characteristics have been benchmarked by practically every automaker fielding a luxury sports car. Available active safety features include blind spot warning and adaptive cruise control. Other available tech features include a head-up display, a digital instrument panel, wireless device charging and a Wi-Fi hot spot (data subscription required after initial trial).\n\nShould I Buy the 2020 BMW 4 Series?\n\nHandling and braking are 4 Series highlights. The Gran Coupe version offers extra cargo versatility without sacrificing style, while the retractable-hardtop convertible delivers year-round practicality. However, the automatic transmission’s responses during performance driving are lacking, and the car’s stability system is too conservative.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 BMW 4 Series?\n\nThe BMW 4 Series lineup shares basic underpinnings with BMW’s 3 Series compact car, but with sleeker, personal-luxury-focused body styles. The 4 Series comes as a two-door coupe or convertible, as well as a four-door Gran Coupe sedan with a low, coupelike roofline. The 430 is powered by a 255-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder, while the M440 gets a 382-hp, turbo 3.0-liter inline-six. The mighty M4 high-performance variant has an upgraded version of the 3.0-liter six-cylinder that produces 473 or 503 hp, depending on the model. BMW still offers a six-speed manual transmission, but only on the M4; all other 4 Series cars have a silky eight-speed automatic. Most 4 Series models offer a choice of rear- or all-wheel drive. The 4 Series’ rivals include the Audi A5, Lexus RC and Mercedes-Benz C-Class.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 BMW 4 Series?\n\nAll 4 Series models receive BMW’s Curved Display, which includes a 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster and a 14.9-inch infotainment touchscreen integrated into a single curved panel. The infotainment software is upgraded to the latest iDrive 8 version, which includes new graphics and additional functions.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 BMW 4 Series Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n12.3-inch digital instrument panel\n14.9-inch infotainment touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nSatellite radio\nNavigation \nWi-Fi hot spot\nDual-zone climate control\nTwo USB ports\n10-speaker stereo\nRear cross-traffic alert\nBlind spot warning\nLane departure warning\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nWireless device charging\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nLeather seating\nHead-up instrument display\nAdaptive M Sport suspension\nM Sport differential\nM Sport brakes\n360-degree parking camera\nLane departure steering assist\nShould I Buy the 2024 BMW 4 Series Gran Coupe?\n\nLuxury car shoppers on the fence about what they want most in their next vehicle will appreciate the many body styles offered by the BMW 4 Series. Few vehicles can be had as a sleek coupe, a sun-loving convertible and a relatively practical sedan. No 4 Series will spoil you with backseat space or cargo volume, particularly not with the coupe and convertible, but when it comes to performance and interior quality, this car impresses with its sharp driving manners and elegant cabin layout.",

      "expert_review": "The BMW 4 Series continues into 2023 with slight revisions to its packaging, a new paint color and new pricing after its variants received a refresh for 2021 and 2022, but the biggest change is inside: Starting in March, all 4 Series will come with a curved display and the latest multimedia system for the dashboard and infotainment.\n\nRelated: 2021 BMW M440i Convertible Review: Escape Artist\n\nBoth the regular 4 Series and the performance-minded M4 soon will house BMW’s curved display, which features a 12.3-inch information display behind the steering wheel and a 14.9-inch control display all running on BMW’s iDrive 8 system. Gone are many buttons and controllers in favor of an emphasis on voice and touch controls — emphasized all the more because, like many other Bimmers for 2023, also gone from the lineup is gesture control.\n\nFor models on sale before March, however, the interior largely carries over. The Driving Assistance Professional Package is out and the Premium Package’s head-up display is now only available on the M440i, while the Parking Assist Package has returned and adaptive LED headlights are no longer available as a stand-alone option. A synthetic leather dashboard is now optional on all 4 Series models. On the M4, the driver recorder function is now a stand-alone option.\n\nElsewhere, the Shadowline Package now gets M Sport brakes with red or blue calipers, and a new Skyscraper Grey metallic paint replaces Bluestone metallic. The base 430i’s powerplant is a 255-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine; the M440i gets you a 382-hp, turbo 3.0-liter inline-six; and the range-topping M4 offers a 473-hp, twin-turbo 3.0-liter inline-six capable of up to 503 hp when equipped with the Competition Package. An eight-speed automatic is standard across most of the lineup; the M4 comes with a six-speed manual. Rear-wheel drive is standard; all-wheel drive is optional except on the M4 Competition convertible, where it comes standard.\n\nPricing and Release Date\n\nThe 2023 BMW 4 Series lineup is available now, and full pricing (including the $995 destination fee) is below. All-wheel drive adds $2,000 except on the M4 Competition, where it’s an extra $4,100 on the coupe and standard on the convertible.\n\nCoupe\n\n430i: $48,395\nM440i: $59,245\nM4: $75,695\nM4 Competition: $79,595\n\nConvertible\n\n430i: $56,495\nM440i: $67,245\nM4 Competition: $90,695\n\nGran Coupe\n\n430i: $46,895\nM440i: $58,445\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nQuicker 2022 BMW M3, M4 Competitions With AWD Priced Under $80,000\n2021 BMW M3 and M4: M Stands for Manual\n2021 BMW 4 Series Convertible Drops Its Cover, and Its (Soft) Top\n2021 BMW 4 Series: More Power, More Tech, More Grille, Just … More on the 4\nMore BMW News\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "If there is a single vehicle in its lineup that embodies everything good about BMW (performance, luxury, bandwidth), it’s the M4. And if there is a single vehicle in its lineup that embodies everything controversial about BMW (styling, technological overreach, marketing-driven brand dilution), it’s the M4. For the 2025 model year, BMW is pushing the model forward in both good and controversial ways.\n\nRelated: 2024 BMW 4 Series Gets Minor Equipment Updates, Starts at $49,295\n\nWhat’s New?\n\nThe 2025 M4 will be updated to BMW’s iDrive 8.5. As in other models to receive the automaker’s latest operating system, the M4 now features a 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster and a 14.9-inch infotainment display seamlessly integrated into a single curved screen. Now responding to touch and voice commands, the operating system still includes the iDrive knob for those who prefer more traditional controls.\n\nOutside, new LED headlights feature vertically oriented running lamps and turn signals, sharpening the M4’s bucktoothed scowl, and new taillights use laser technology to illuminate glass-fiber elements to create a three-dimensional effect. While hardcore fans have always championed the M4’s carbon-fiber roof panel and its contribution to a lower center of gravity, a steel lid with a power moonroof is now available for no extra charge. When paired with the newly available graphics that outline the hood’s contours in black or red (and carry through to the trunk lid), the steel roof is painted black.\n\nPowertrain Specs and MPG\n\nFor 2025, all-wheel-drive M4 Competitions get an additional 20 horsepower, bringing them up to 523 hp. The rear-drive base M4 and the M4 Competition, powered by variations of the same turbocharged inline-six engine, hold fast with 473 and 503 hp, respectively. The base car is fitted with a six-speed manual transmission, while the Competition and xDrive Competition use an eight-speed automatic. The coupe is available with all three powertrains, but the convertible is only available in 523-hp xDrive Competition spec.\n\nEPA fuel-economy ratings are not yet available for the 2025 model but are likely to carry over. For the 2024 version, rear-drive coupes are rated at 16/23/19 mpg city/highway/combined, according to the EPA; the xDrive Competition coupe is estimated to return 16/22/18 mpg, and the convertible gets 16/23/18.\n\nPricing and Availability\n\nThe 2025 BMW M4 will launch globally in March. Full-line pricing (including $995 destination) is as follows:\n\nM4 coupe: $80,095\nM4 Competition coupe: $84,195\nM4 Competition xDrive coupe: $89,295\nM4 Competition xDrive convertible: $96,295\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2021 BMW 4 Series: More Power, More Tech, More Grille, Just … More on the 4\nWhich New Cars Have Manual Transmissions?\nResearch the BMW M4\nFind Your Next Car\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
