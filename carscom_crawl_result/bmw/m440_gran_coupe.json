      "expert_review": "The BMW 4 Series Gran Coupe and its electric stablemate, the i4, were just overhauled for the 2022 model year, but BMW is tweaking the pair for 2025 with updated infotainment tech, new head- and taillights, and more.\n\nRelated: 2024 BMW i4 Adds xDrive40 Variant, Priced From $53,195\n\nWhat’s New?\n\nThe biggest change is to the gas-powered 4 Series Gran Coupe. As with other BMWs, the 2025 4 Series Gran Coupe now includes a standard 48-volt mild-hybrid system with both available engines. The 430i Gran Coupe’s turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder is thoroughly reworked for increased efficiency, but with the additional hybrid components, its output remains unchanged at 255 horsepower and 295 pounds-feet of torque.\n\nThe turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six in the M440i Gran Coupe gets some efficiency rework, and the mild-hybrid system bumps its total output up to 386 hp and 398 pounds-feet, increases of 4 hp and 29 pounds-feet. Both engines are paired exclusively with an eight-speed automatic transmission, with rear-wheel drive standard and all-wheel drive available. EPA fuel economy estimates for the hybrid engines are not yet available. The i4’s electric powertrain is unchanged for 2025.\n\nOther Updates\n\nRevised head- and taillights are the extent of the major exterior updates on the cars, and the upper portion of the i4’s grille is now closed. Inside, the standard Curved Display, in which the digital instrument panel flows seamlessly into the central touchscreen behind a single piece of curved glass, is updated to the latest generation of BMW’s iDrive with QuickSelect. Running on BMW Operating System 8.5, the infotainment system features a revised menu structure aimed at keeping more commonly used functions readily accessible through the touchscreen.\n\nThis software version also expands the use of voice commands and works with the My BMW mobile app to allow remote access to vehicle information — and, in some cases, functions like door locking and unlocking — from anywhere with cellular service or Wi-Fi connectivity. The newly standard Personal eSim allows for a 5G data connection for communications and connectivity services even in the absence of a paired smartphone.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nBMW i4, Mini Cooper SE Hardtop Top 2024 J.D.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 BMW 4 Series?\n\nThe BMW 4 Series lineup shares basic underpinnings with BMW’s 3 Series compact car, but with sleeker, personal-luxury-focused body styles. The 4 Series comes as a two-door coupe or convertible, as well as a four-door Gran Coupe sedan with a low, coupelike roofline. The 430 is powered by a 255-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder, while the M440 gets a 382-hp, turbo 3.0-liter inline-six. The mighty M4 high-performance variant has an upgraded version of the 3.0-liter six-cylinder that produces 473 or 503 hp, depending on the model. BMW still offers a six-speed manual transmission, but only on the M4; all other 4 Series cars have a silky eight-speed automatic. Most 4 Series models offer a choice of rear- or all-wheel drive. The 4 Series’ rivals include the Audi A5, Lexus RC and Mercedes-Benz C-Class.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 BMW 4 Series?\n\nAll 4 Series models receive BMW’s Curved Display, which includes a 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster and a 14.9-inch infotainment touchscreen integrated into a single curved panel. The infotainment software is upgraded to the latest iDrive 8 version, which includes new graphics and additional functions.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 BMW 4 Series Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n12.3-inch digital instrument panel\n14.9-inch infotainment touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nSatellite radio\nNavigation \nWi-Fi hot spot\nDual-zone climate control\nTwo USB ports\n10-speaker stereo\nRear cross-traffic alert\nBlind spot warning\nLane departure warning\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nWireless device charging\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nLeather seating\nHead-up instrument display\nAdaptive M Sport suspension\nM Sport differential\nM Sport brakes\n360-degree parking camera\nLane departure steering assist\nShould I Buy the 2024 BMW 4 Series Gran Coupe?\n\nLuxury car shoppers on the fence about what they want most in their next vehicle will appreciate the many body styles offered by the BMW 4 Series. Few vehicles can be had as a sleek coupe, a sun-loving convertible and a relatively practical sedan. No 4 Series will spoil you with backseat space or cargo volume, particularly not with the coupe and convertible, but when it comes to performance and interior quality, this car impresses with its sharp driving manners and elegant cabin layout.",
