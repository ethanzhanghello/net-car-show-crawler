      "expert_review": "What you see before you is perhaps one of the most important new vehicles that BMW has introduced in years. With electrification transforming the industry and one automaker after another committing to at least a mostly electric future, the introduction of an expensive, flagship all-electric SUV is a shot into the heart of the premium luxury class currently dominated by Tesla, with a host of challengers current or forthcoming. \n\nOn paper, the new 2022 BMW iX has a lot of the right stuff to be successful. It debuts as the dual-motor iX eDrive M50, complete with all-wheel drive, an anticipated maximum range of 300 miles, DC fast-charging capability, and a host of sustainability measures like olive-leaf-tanned leather and interior bits made out of recycled fishing net. And it’s all wrapped in a spacious five-occupant SUV. \n\nThere’s just one problem, and I’m sure I don’t have to tell you what it is. You can tell by looking at it: The BMW iX might just be the ugliest new car to come along in decades. \n\nRelated: 2022 BMW iX xDrive50: A Smartphone on Wheels\n\n‘A Cross Between a Pontiac Aztek and a ‘58 Edsel’\n\nThat’s what a friend of mine on Facebook, someone who’s not even a car enthusiast, called the iX when I posted pictures of it from a recent BMW media event to get up close and personal with two new i-brand models, the iX SUV and i4 sedan. And you know what? My friend is not at all wrong. \n\nThe silhouette of the new iX is perfectly fine, a two-box design with some slightly awkward proportions but nothing offensive overall — but turn the lights on in the room and see what BMW stylists have done here, and there’s just nothing good to say. The completely vertical front end has cat-eye headlights that look fine, but they flank the latest version of BMW’s twin-kidney grille that’s been likened to everything from a bucktoothed beaver to SpongeBob SquarePants. What kills me is that this SUV doesn’t even need a grille given that there’s no engine to cool and, thus, no air flowing through it. BMW refers to it as the vehicle’s “Intelligence Panel,” housing the radar and other sensors — it’s even heated so ice and snow buildup don’t interfere with said functions. The lower bumper contains two enormous trapezoidal black panels that look like they’re from a different vehicle entirely, which connect inharmoniously to two black side sills down the side of the vehicle. \n\nFrom the front, we continue down the oddly surfaced, bulging fenders of the iX and come across some brightwork that ruins the side view. It starts at a seemingly arbitrary point just in front of the windshield pillar, runs along the window beltline to the rear doors, and then kinks up and rearward to ruin the rear sail panel with an odd cut to the liftgate. The taillights are wide slits that don’t quite span the entire rear of the SUV, so instead of bringing the idea of width to the design, they give the look of a bulbous, chunky butt. \n\nThere simply isn’t a view of the new iX that one can stand back and say, “Well, it looks pretty good from this angle” because it doesn’t. It doesn’t look good from any angle. Of the exterior, only the wheels for BMW’s eDrive M50 on display were attractive. The rest is just a hot mess.\n\nThings Are Considerably Better Inside\n\nPerhaps the kindest thing we can say about the exterior is that you only have to think about it when approaching or departing the vehicle. The iX is a totally different experience inside thanks to a high-quality, super-chic cabin that’s spacious, avant-garde, functional and surprisingly comfortable. The dashboard and instrument panel have a cantilevered floating construction that’s new to BMW; it conveys a decidedly high-tech atmosphere without being overly spartan like any of Tesla’s offerings. The squircle-shaped steering wheel might look odd, but its shape allows you to fully view the massive organic light-emitting diode display behind it without the bits a circular wheel would hide. Next to that gauge display is the latest-generation BMW iDrive 8 multimedia system, and it’s quite good: Super-fast response, bright displays and crystal-clear icons make it look dynamite. Of course, this was also viewed in an enclosed, indoor area; we’ll see how well this highly reflective panel looks in bright outdoor sunlight later on. \n\nThe seats are striking in both design and comfort. Quilted leather covers the surfaces but also extends down the seat sides — purely a nod to style given you seldom touch that part of the seat. The parts you do touch feel wonderful, with seemingly huge chairs that feel plush and supportive up front. The rear bench is also spacious, with plenty of legroom and a flat floor that allows easy seating for three across. Occupants also get some convenient touches, such as USB-C power outlets in the front seatbacks. \n\nThe only thing we worry about are the controls. There are precious few actual buttons in the iX, and they’re mostly found on the doors. Working the center controls requires using the touchscreen’s icons and menus, voice commands or a capacitive-touch panel between the front seats that also features haptic feedback. BMW has also made that panel out of wood instead of the typical shiny piano-black plastic, which should cut down significantly on the sticky fingerprints that mar most glass cockpit interiors. \n\nWe’re hoping that people will be able to get past the exterior styling long enough to get inside the new iX, as there’s a lot of lovely technology, comfort and next-generation luxury in there to keep buyers happy. But given that BMW is planning on charging north of $84,000 for this flagship i-brand electric SUV when it arrives in the spring of 2022, accepting that it’s just not a well-styled vehicle might be a hard pill for some to swallow. \n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nBMW Reveals i4, Eyes Battery-Electric Sedan for U.S. in 2022\nAuto Show Face-Off: 2021 Ford Mustang Mach-E Vs. 2020 Audi E-Tron Sportback\n2021 Best Eco-Friendly Car of the Year\nWhat’s New With Electric Vehicles for 2021?\nMore EV News\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 BMW iX?\n\nThe BMW iX is an all-electric, five-seat SUV with standard all-wheel drive. In the base xDrive50 model, two electric motors combine to send 516 horsepower to all four wheels. Total output jumps to 610 hp in the high-performance M60, which commands a steep six-figure asking price. The iX’s competitors include the Tesla Model X, Cadillac Lyriq, Rivian R1S and Audi Q8 e-Tron.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 BMW iX?\n\nThe iX rolls into 2025 with no major changes. Its available hands-free driving system now includes an active lane-change feature, and the smartphone app’s digital key functionality is enhanced. \n\nHow Much Range Does the 2025 BMW iX Have?\n\nThe iX’s EPA-estimated driving range goes from 211-309 miles, depending on battery pack, drive wheels and wheel size.\n\nHow Long Does It Take to Charge the 2025 BMW iX?\n\nThe iX’s estimated time to achieve a full charge on a standard 240-volt Level 2 charger is eight to 10 hours, but going from 10% to 80% can be as fast as an estimated 31 minutes on a 350-kilowatt DC fast charger.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 BMW iX Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nAWD\n12.3-inch digital gauge cluster\n14.9-inch touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nWireless device charging\nAmbient lighting\nQuad-zone climate control\nHands-free park assist\nTraffic-sign recognition\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nSafe-exit assist\nNavigation\nSix USB ports\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nHead-up instrument display\nSurround-view parking camera system\nPremium audio system\nAdaptive air suspension\nPower soft-close doors\nFour-wheel steering\nHeated, ventilated and massaging front seats\nHeated rear seats\nLeather upholstery\nShould I Buy the 2025 BMW iX?\n\nIf the high starting price and buck-toothed front grille don’t deter you, the BMW iX is a spectacular electric SUV. Extremely quick and with strong driving-range estimates, the iX also boasts plenty of passenger space and cargo room. Ride and handling are equal parts sporty and comfortable; the iX absolutely glides down the road. The M60 delivers gobs of power, but it’s tough to justify its extra cost when the standard iX is so good.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 BMW iX?\n\nThe BMW iX is an all-electric five-seat SUV with standard all-wheel drive and an EPA-estimated driving range of 274-324 miles, depending on trim level and equipment. In the base xDrive50 model, two electric motors combine to send 516 horsepower to all four wheels; total output jumps to 610 hp in the high-performance M60, a model that commands a steep six-figure asking price. The iX’s competitors include the Audi Q8 e-Tron, Cadillac Lyriq, Rivian R1S and Tesla Model X.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 BMW iX?\n\nThe 2024 iX’s battery has an upgraded preconditioning heat-management system to help speed up charging at DC fast-charging stations. BMW’s Highway Assistant hands-free driver-assist system is available, and upgrades to the available Parking Assistant Professional feature enable drivers to control parking maneuvers from outside the vehicle via a smartphone app.  \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 BMW iX Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nAll-wheel drive\n14.9-inch touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nWireless device charging\nAmbient lighting\nQuad-zone climate control\nHands-free park assist\nTraffic-sign recognition\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nSafe exit assist\nNavigation\nSix USB ports\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nHead-up instrument display\n360-degree camera system\n30-speaker stereo\nM Sport suspension\nPower soft-close doors\nFour-wheel steering\nHeated, ventilated and massaging front seats\nHeated rear seats\nShould I Buy the 2024 BMW iX?\n\nIf the high starting price and bucktoothed front grille aren’t deterrents for you, the BMW iX is a spectacular electric SUV. Extremely quick and with strong driving-range estimates, the iX also boasts plenty of occupant space and cargo room. The ride and handling are equal parts sporty and comfortable; the iX absolutely glides down the road. The M60 delivers gobs of power, but it’s tough to justify its extra cost when the standard iX is so good.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Controversial looks aside, the 2023 BMW iX M60 is a quick, comfortable and luxurious mid-size SUV that brings traditional BMW driving characteristics to the EV era.\n\nVersus the competition: With a starting price north of $100,000, the iX M60’s price tag puts it in competition with EVs like the Tesla Model X and Mercedes-EQ EQS SUV. All three have tech-centric interiors, but the iX’s blocky, chunky looks set it apart from the sleeker Tesla and Mercedes — and represent a significant design departure for BMW.\n\nThe iX debuted for 2022 as an all-wheel-drive xDrive50 making 516 horsepower. The M60 trim level I tested is new for 2023, and while it’s also AWD, it uses a more powerful rear motor to produce up to 610 hp. The SUV’s as-tested price was $113,420 (prices include destination), but pricing has gone up for 2024: A similarly equipped 2024 iX M60 cost $120,395 as of publication.\n\nRelated: Up Close With the 2022 BMW iX Electric SUV: Why’s It Gotta Look Like That?\n\nDrives (Mostly) Beautifully\n\nThe iX M60 is quick; BMW says it can hit 60 mph in 3.6 seconds, which isn’t bad for an SUV with a curb weight approaching 5,800 pounds. You can send its nose skyward when you accelerate hard, and there’s plenty of reserve power for slicing through traffic whenever you choose — and that power is delivered immediately. Acceleration is accompanied by some spaceship-like sounds, as if BMW wanted to find an electric-age replacement for the growl of an internal-combustion engine. It’s a different approach than some other EVs, which are content with silent acceleration, but the noises didn’t bother me.\n\nI liked driving in the iX’s B setting, which allows essentially one-pedal driving in most situations. It smooths out the driving experience, letting you avoid the iX’s mushy brake pedal that was also occasionally plagued by inconsistent responses.\n\nThe iX rides well, especially considering its optional 22-inch wheels and low-profile tires with relatively high recommended tire pressures — 39 pounds per square inch in front and 46 psi in back. There’s a firmness to the adaptive air suspension’s response when you hit a bump in the road, but it’s not jarring or harsh. The suspension does a good job soaking up imperfect pavement, mostly preventing it from disturbing occupants or the driving experience. I did, however, notice a bit of a shudder through the body structure when one of the rear tires hit a bump or utility cover.\n\nNoise isolation at highway speeds is also good, with the main sound intrusion coming from tire noise. There’s no noticeable wind noise on the highway, and bumps and pavement breaks don’t create unpleasant sounds in the cabin like they do in the Tesla Model Y. It’s a serene driving experience overall.\n\nThe iX’s steering is responsive. In the SUV’s Personal driving mode, it takes just a light effort to turn the wheel. You’ll feel a bit of body roll when you toss the iX into a corner in this mode, but in Sport mode, it’s more locked down with less body lean. Sport mode also firms up steering feel and suspension responses, and it enhances accelerator pedal response. By contrast, accelerator response is dulled considerably in the iX’s Efficient mode.\n\nA Beautifully Finished — if Different — Interior\n\nPremium materials and controls pair with unique interior elements to make the iX’s cabin distinctive and memorable. Having controls embedded in the center console’s wood trim is not common, and the iX’s transparent console knob, volume knob and beveled seat controls likewise give familiar interior components a new look. (These design cues are part of a $1,150 Luxury Package.) Look closely at the steering wheel, too, and you’ll see it’s more of a hexagon than a wheel. It’s not all stellar, though: The bronze-plastic interior trim looks a little cheap considering the iX’s price, and the black-mesh trim near the speakers is another rare downmarket moment in this SUV’s cabin.\n\nThe iX’s curved displays — a 12.3-inch digital instrument panel and a 14.9-inch infotainment screen — sweep across the left and center portions of the dashboard, adding a high-tech, minimalist look. I like that the iX’s large center display is a touchscreen even though the iDrive multimedia system’s menus are typically easy to navigate via the knob controller. The knob is still there, but it seemed touchier than the ones I’ve used in other BMWs and was harder to operate. Using wireless Apple CarPlay was simple — it’s just a matter of pairing your phone with Bluetooth and it’s available — and CarPlay uses the full width of the center screen.\n\nThe front seats are wide and comfortable with adjustable side bolsters. The optional leather upholstery adds $3,500, but it’s appropriately rich and high-quality. The center console’s design makes the front seat feel more open than in a conventionally powered luxury SUV, but the location of some console features is a bit odd: The cupholders, for instance, are positioned low under the upper controls and aren’t the easiest to reach.\n\nThe driver has good forward visibility thanks to a dashboard and front roof pillars that aren’t in the way, but rear visibility isn’t great; the rear and rear-quarter windows are small. Over-shoulder views are passable, though, and they’re supplemented by electronic safety aids like a blind spot warning.\n\nBackseat space is reasonable for adults, and it’s mostly accommodating for child-safety seats. The seat cushion is a little close to the floor, so there’s less thigh support for taller passengers, but headroom is great even with what BMW calls its Panoramic Eclipsing Sky Lounge roof, which is standard. The roof is a large glass panel that can switch between transparent and opaque modes. The bench seat and floor are both flat, which should be a boon for passengers stuck in the middle seat, but the seatback doesn’t recline. Among two-row mid-size SUVs we’ve measured, the iX’s 20.3-cubic-foot cargo area is on the small side. It’s even smaller than the cargo areas of some compact SUVs: The Hyundai Tucson, for example, has 21.5 cubic feet of space.\n\nOne of the more surprising aspects of the iX is how the doors sound when you close them. The iX has frameless door windows (meaning the glass isn’t surrounded by metal), and rather than getting a satisfying “thunk” when you shut the door as you do in many luxury vehicles, there’s an unrefined rattling noise. It’s completely out of place in a six-figure vehicle.\n\nHome Charging, DC Fast-Charging and Range\n\nThe iX can accept up to 11 kilowatts of power from a Level 2 home charger provided the system can supply that level of power. My home charging setup — a 48-amp Wallbox Pulsar Plus unit — can, and that’s roughly what the iX took during our charging test. The Wallbox unit delivered 10.6 kilowatt-hours of energy during the hourlong charging session, which added 33 miles of range and brought the iX’s battery from 39% to 47%. The iX also comes with a handy mobile charger that has interchangeable plugs for 120- or 240-volt service, and it can handle up to 9.6 kW of power on 240-volt service.\n\nThe iX has a maximum DC fast-charging rate of 195 kW, but in our experience, it’s been difficult to reach and sustain an EV’s maximum fast-charging rate for any length of time — even at fast chargers capable of supplying the maximum power they can accept.  Best-case scenario, BMW says the iX’s battery can go from 10% to 80% in 35 minutes.\n\nEPA range estimates for the iX vary considerably by trim level and wheel size. The xDrive50 with 20-inch wheels has the longest estimated range, at 324 miles, while versions with 21- and 22-inch wheels have 305 and 315 miles of range, respectively. An M60 with 21-inch wheels is rated at 288 miles, while our test vehicle and its 22-inch wheels get 274 miles of rated range.\n\nThe Elephant in the Driveway\n\nIt was back in the early 2000s that BMW embarked on a new design direction with the 2002 7 Series full-size sedan. That car traded the sleek, classic styling of its predecessor and other BMWs for an entirely different look, and it feels like we’re seeing that same type of design disruption playing out again with the iX as the automaker moves into the EV age.\n\nThe iX’s tall twin-kidney grille, for instance, has generated the same type of controversy that surrounded that turn-of-the-millennium 7 Series. The iX’s angular exterior styling lacks the gracefulness of the similarly sized X5 SUV; to my eyes, it’s more different than attractive.\n\nThere is, however, a school of thought that says EVs need to look different. The iX does, and while its looks aren’t for everyone, those who cross this SUV off their list based on looks alone will miss out on one great-driving luxury EV.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2023 BMW iX?\nWhat to Know Before Purchasing an Electric Vehicle: A Buying Guide\nWhat’s New With Electric Vehicles for 2023?\nElectric Cars With the Longest Range\nShop for a 2023 BMW iX\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Competes with: Cadillac Lyriq, Genesis Electrified GV70, Mercedes-EQ EQE SUV, Rivian R1S\n\nLooks like: A monochromatic iX\n\nPowertrains: 402- (xDrive45), 536- (xDrive60) or 650-horsepower (M70 xDrive) dual electric motors with 100.1-, 113.4- or 112.8-kilowatt-hour battery; all-wheel drive\n\nHits dealerships: Second quarter of 2025\n\nThe BMW iX electric SUV gets an update for 2026 with minor tweaks to the exterior styling, updated powertrain electronics for increased range, and more options. However, the most tantalizing detail for many shoppers will be the new entry-level iX xDrive45 that undercuts the cheapest 2025 iX by more than 10 grand. Priced from $76,325 (all prices include a $1,175 destination fee), the 2026 BMW iX starts $12,100 lower than before.\n\nRelated: 2023 BMW iX Review: Inner Beauty\n\nNew Powertrain Option, New Names for the Old\n\nAt the base of the iX hierarchy is the new xDrive45. Like the rest of the lineup, it is all-wheel drive, with electric motors front and rear combining for 402 horsepower and 516 pounds-feet of torque. With a 100.1-kilowatt-hour battery pack, BMW says the xDrive45 has a maximum range of 312 miles (official EPA ratings for 2026 are not yet available). The automaker estimates the xDrive45 can accelerate from 0-60 mph in 4.9 seconds, which is not terribly quick by EV standards, but it’s remarkably fleet compared to gas-powered five-seat family haulers.\n\nThe entry-level 2025 iX, dubbed xDrive50, gets a numerical promotion to xDrive60 along with 20 hp extra for a total output of 536 hp. Torque is unchanged, at 564 pounds-feet. With battery capacity at 113.4 kWh, the xDrive60 can travel up to 340 miles on a charge, an increase of 31 miles from its 2025 equivalent. It will hit 60 mph from rest in 4.4 seconds, according to BMW.\n\nLikewise, the top-of-the-line iX changes its name from M60 to M70 xDrive, with 40 hp more bringing maximum output to 650 hp. Maximum torque remains unchanged at 811 pounds-feet. That output is only available in Sport mode with launch control activated; nominal output is 570 hp and 749 pounds-feet. Launch control flings the M70 xDrive to 60 mph in a claimed 3.6 seconds. This most powerful iX drains its 112.8-kWh battery in an estimated 302 miles, 17 more than the outgoing M60.\n\nUpdated Electrical Components\n\nBMW increased pack sizes from 2025’s 109.5 kWh, but increased efficiency elsewhere in the iX’s drivetrain also contributes to its increased range. According to BMW, new silicon-carbide semiconductor components are the single biggest contributor, allowing for more efficient energy conversion in the inverters that hand off energy from the battery to the motors. A new battery management system, and optimized tire choices and wheel bearings also contribute to the increased range. BMW also revised the iX’s temperature management and preconditioning systems to improve cold-weather and charging performance. Additionally, the new iX features plug-and-charge capabilities that allow you to do just that — plug into a public charger and start charging without having to dig for phone apps or payment methods.\n\nAll three powertrains have an 11-kilowatt onboard charger for use with AC power. The xDrive60 and M70 xDrive can charge at up to 195 kW on a DC fast charger, while the base variant can accept up to 175 kW. Nonetheless, BMW says the three can all fast-charge from 10% to 80% in around 35 minutes. The M70 xDrive also features several other performance features that set it apart, including sport-tuned adaptive air suspension, rear-wheel steering for better maneuverability and handling, and M Sport-specific roll bars and brakes. (An optional Dynamic Handling Package available to the other models includes adaptive air suspension and rear-wheel steering, and they can also get the M Sport brakes as an option, as well.)\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2023 BMW iX?\nUp Close With the 2022 BMW iX Electric SUV: Why’s It Gotta Look Like That?\nBMW, Mini, Rolls-Royce to Gain Access to Tesla Superchargers\nBMW Unveils Next-Gen In-Car Tech, Automated Valet Parking at CES\nElectric Cars With the Longest Range\nSubtle Styling and Equipment Updates\n\nThe 2026 iX looks different from its predecessor, but only in small ways. BMW ditched the black lower-body and bumper trim on all variants. An optional M Sport appearance package (which comes standard on the M70 xDrive) includes reshaped outer intakes in the front fascia that are thinner and more vertical, bespoke interior trim, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, package-specific alloy wheels and an integrated rear diffuser. An M Sport Professional Package includes the perks of the M Sport Package but with darker M Shadowline headlights and taillights. While all still have the bucktoothed grille, the lower trims have a diagonal insert while the M70 xDrive’s bars are horizontal.\n\nBMW’s Multi-Function massaging seats with adjustable backrest width and lumbar support are, for the first time, now available in the iX with the M Sport Package and as standard equipment on the M70 xDrive. A tow hitch is also available with a maximum towing capacity of 3,500 pounds. Other luxury, convenience and tech options are largely carried over from the existing iX, including ventilated seats (heating is standard), a 30-speaker Bowers & Wilkins surround-sound system, panoramic roof, and automated parking and Highway Assistant hands-free highway driving system.\n\nAvailability and Pricing\n\nSales of the 2026 BMW iX begin in the second quarter of 2025. Pricing is as follows:\n\nxDrive45: $76,325\nxDrive60: $89,675\nM70 xDrive: $112,675\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
