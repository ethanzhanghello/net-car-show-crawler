      "expert_review": "The BMW 6 Series blends performance and luxury in a way few BMWs, relative to their competitors, have managed to do, and it throws in just enough practicality that it might actually suffice as the only car you’d own. Don’t get me wrong: This is no sedan substitute, but it does pack just enough utility to give it a leg to stand on when your sensibilities — or spouse — try to rein you in.\n\nThe 6 Series comes as a 650i coupe or soft-top convertible. There’s also a high-performance M6 version that’s covered separately on Cars.com. The current 6 Series was introduced for 2004; through the years it’s received a larger engine and, for 2008, a few styling tweaks. Click here to see a comparison with the 2007 model.\n\n \n\nGoing & Stopping\nBehind the 650i’s twin-kidney grille is a 360-horsepower, 4.8-liter V-8. Noise levels belie the power — the engine purrs quietly at idle and gives only a perfunctory yowl when it’s revved, but it moves the car along with authoritative torque from anywhere on the tach. Acceleration is so smooth and persistent that you’ll easily hit the engine’s 6,500-rpm redline — there is little sign you’re about to reach its limit.\n\nMy coupe had a six-speed manual transmission. It hits each gate with definitive, medium throws. The clutch is hefty but not overly so — I’d expected something heavier, and it actually proved a welcome tool for creeping through traffic. Like in other stick-shift BMWs, the shifting can feel a bit rubbery at times, but short of the Porsche 911 there’s little to compare it to in this segment.\n\nMore impressive is the 6 Series’ accelerator response. Credit BMW’s Valvetronic system, whose variable-valve mechanics are more elaborate than most. It yields immediate pedal response, and there’s no waiting as the needle crests the tachometer — it comes down as quickly as it goes up, which makes for more precise, if not easier, downshift rev-matching. A Sport button behind the shifter quickens accelerator response and decreases power steering assist for more turning precision; both deliver noticeable differences. After a few days I left Sport mode on all the time. It can make for touchy acceleration in stop-and-go traffic, though, which may take some practice to iron out. My advice: Decide early on if you want Sport or not, then groom your driving habits accordingly.\n\nA six-speed automatic is optional. It comes with standard steering-wheel paddle shifters and two Sport modes — one with the shifter in its manual-shift gate, which holds lower gears longer for better acceleration and increased engine braking, and the other coming with a press of the automatic’s Sport button, which quickens accelerator response and holds gears even longer. BMW’s ill-received Sequential Manual Gearbox, offered through the 2007 model year, has been ditched.\n\nWith the manual, BMW says the 650i accelerates from zero to 60 mph in just 5.3 seconds. The automatic takes only 5.4 seconds. The 650i convertible weighs a significant 463 pounds extra — about 12 percent — so it comes in at 5.6 and 5.7 seconds for the manual and automatic, respectively. Those figures put the car ahead of a Cadillac XLR or Jaguar XK, according to their respective automakers; the featherweight Porsche 911 and headstrong Mercedes SL550 are quicker still.\n\nAcceleration Compared\n \tDrivetrain\t0-to-60 mph, coupe (sec.)\t0-to-60 mph, conv. (sec.)\nPorsche 911 Carrera\t325-hp, 3.6L F-6; 6-sp. man./5-sp. auto\t4.8 – 5.2\t5.0 – 5.4\nMercedes SL550\t382-hp, 5.5L V-8; 7-sp. auto\t—\t5.3\nBMW 650i\t360-hp, 4.8L V-8; 6-sp. man./6-sp. auto\t5.3 – 5.4\t5.6 – 5.7\nCadillac XLR\t320-hp, 4.6L V-8; 6-sp. auto\t—\t5.8\nJaguar XK\t300-hp, 4.2L V-8; 6-sp. auto\t5.9\t6.0\nSource: Automaker data for 2008 models, except 2009 Mercedes SL550.\n\n \n\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes are standard. The pedal feels more linear than in some BMWs — which have a tendency for grabbier response — but it’s just as strong. Brake-fade compensation, which applies greater pressure when brake fade has occurred, and a brake-drying feature that attempts to keep the discs dry when it’s raining are also standard.\n\nOptional advanced cruise control integrates full stop-and-go functionality, much like Mercedes’ Distronic Plus. It can bring the 6 Series to a complete stop and resume acceleration to a set distance behind the car ahead. My test car didn’t have it, so I can offer no evaluation.\n\n \n\nRide & Handling\nLike any car nearing the $100,000 mark, the 6 Series augments a conventional four-wheel-independent suspension with a host of technical wizardry. The results are impressive: The car remains planted even in bumpy corners, with minimal lean or lateral wheel hop. Quick lane changes yield a bit more body roll, but on straight roads the car rides smoothly. All told, the 6 doesn’t achieve the same ride and handling magic as the XK with its fully adaptive suspension, but it isn’t far off. An optional Sport package adds bigger wheels and sportier seats, but suspension tuning remains the same; BMW says the convertible’s heavier-duty suspension is also tuned to provide an identical feel to the coupe’s.\n\nBuyers get a choice of two steering setups. The basic Servotronic system can vary the steering ratio for easier response at parking lot speeds and better straight-line stability on the highway. An optional Active Steering system does so even more radically; if you get Active Steering, though, the Sport button near the gearshift won’t alter its precision. My car had the more basic setup, which proved much easier to turn than in the 1 Series and 3 Series, particularly at low speeds. Fear not, performance fans: The steering still preserves BMW’s legendary turn-in precision on curvier roads. In tight quarters, the 6 Series’ turning circle is 37.4 feet, 1.2 feet more than the XK or SL.\n\nSwitch off the car’s electronic stability system and it doesn’t take much to push the rear wheels wide. The 6 Series does so fairly controllably. The chassis strikes a fairly neutral oversteer/understeer balance, so if you’re feeling especially gutsy, four-wheel power slides are entirely possible — and it’s easy to rein things in with your right foot.\n\nExterior & Styling\nBMW designer Chris Bangle came under fire for his earlier designs on the 7 Series and 5 Series, but the 6 Series doesn’t seem quite so severe. I found its proportions appropriate — there’s minimal front overhang, and the cabin sits nicely toward the rear of the car. The humplike trunk, probably my least favorite attribute, blends in from most viewing angles.\n\nThere are a number of slight changes for 2008, including revised lower bumpers and new lenses for the headlights and taillights. Check out the thumbnails on the right to see some of them.\n\nEighteen-inch alloy wheels are standard. The Sport package adds 19-inchers.\n\nCabin & Seating\nAppointments are what you’d expect of this class. The aluminum trim in my test car had an upscale, textured feel; wood trim is optional, and both materials are genuine. My test car came outfitted with optional sport seats, whose substantial side bolsters still leave ample room for comfort. (Disclaimer: On a good day, my waist is 35 inches.) Combined with the relative open space — the dash sits low and slopes gradually toward the windshield — they give the 6 a grand-touring feel not unlike the XK or SL. It’s a departure from BMW’s stricter interiors that I suspect many shoppers will welcome.\n\nFit and finish are excellent, and so are the materials. Leather seats are standard, but opt for the upgraded Pearl Leather I had in my test car and you also get a leather-wrapped dashboard. That isn’t offered on the 5 Series, and it’s only available in the 7 Series on the $120,000-plus 760i. Sun-reflective leather, which stays cooler in direct sunlight, is standard on the convertible. Cars.com reviewer David Thomas tested it out in a BMW convertible last month, and he came away impressed with its heat-resisting abilities.\n\nOther features, most of them standard, include a power tilt/telescoping steering wheel, power seats and a fixed glass roof on the coupe. The seats have fairly conventional adjustments, unlike a loaded XK or SL, where you can stiffen the side bolsters or extend the seat cushions at the push of a button. Oh, the toil.\n\nThe standard navigation system uses BMW’s iDrive controller. BMW upgraded the graphics and added six programmable shortcut buttons on the dash for 2008, which can link to anything from a map destination to a Bluetooth phone number. They help, but I’d still like a hard-coded “Back” button near the controller. I’ll confine my other complaints to the picture captions (iDrive is a very, very dead horse), but competitively, the 6 Series is not necessarily at a clear disadvantage: The XK, its closest competitor, has a friendlier navigation setup, but its menus load at a glacial pace.\n\nThe standard CD stereo has eight speakers and an auxiliary MP3 jack. My test car had upgraded Logic7 audio with 13 speakers, a USB jack for portable music devices and both satellite and hi-def radio. HD radio, offered by BMW and several others, is a boon if you frequent AM stations; it enhances sound quality to near-FM levels. I didn’t notice much of a quality difference in FM radio, but Cars.com reviewer Mike Hanley thought it brought audio quality closer to CD levels. Either way, HD radio options appear more prevalent on FM than AM. From my house a few miles north of downtown Chicago, I counted 18 of 23 FM stations broadcasting in HD, while just four of my 15 AM stations were.\n\nPractical Aspects\nLike the XK, the 6 Series is realistically a two-seater. The rear seats are better suited for groceries than people — it’s a similar situation in the XK and 911 — but having them allows for short trips with kids that would be impossible in an SL or XLR.\n\nThe backseat will likely become a vestibule for smaller items anyway, because storage areas up front are in short supply. The glove compartment is too small even for the owner’s manual, and apart from a shallow center console, the cabin is lacking any storage space.\n\nNone of the 6 Series’ competitors are known for storage abundance, so BMW isn’t necessarily behind the pack. Even if it is, its trunk puts it back in front: The coupe’s boasts 13.0 cubic feet of space, which handily beats the competition. Convertibles have 12.4 cubic feet with the top up and 10.6 cubic feet with the top down; both figures also lead the competition. Like I said earlier, this doesn’t make the 6 a car for everyone, but it does mean it could carry two people and a full week’s worth of luggage. Most competitors would be good for a weekend at best.\n\nLiving Space Compared\n \tSeats\tFront headroom (in.), coupe/conv.\tFront legroom (in.)\tCargo volume, coupe (cu. ft.)\tCargo volume, conv., top up/down (cu. ft.)\nPorsche 911 Carrera\t4\t38.0/38.0\t41.6\t4.4\t4.4/4.4\nBMW 650i\t4\t37.6/37.8\t42.0\t13.0\t12.4/10.6\nMercedes SL550\t2\t–/37.7\t42.9\t—\t10.2/7.2\nCadillac XLR\t2\t–/37.6\t42.6\t—\t11.6/4.4\nJaguar XK\t4\t37.4/37.0\t43.0\t10.6\t10.0/7.1\nSource: Manufacturer data for 2008 models except 2009 Mercedes SL550.\n\n \n\nSafety & Reliability\nAs of this writing, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety had not crash tested the 6 Series. Standard safety features on the coupe include front and seat-mounted side-impact airbags, dual knee airbags and tube-style head-protection airbags for the front seats. The head airbags extend a bit past the B-pillar, but not enough to protect rear-seat passengers. The convertible lacks the head-protection airbags, as do most convertibles. It has pop-up roll bars behind the rear seats that deploy during a rollover.\n\nActive head restraints, four-wheel-disc antilock brakes, traction control and an electronic stability system are standard across the line. Also standard are adaptive brake lights that illuminate brighter under hard braking. For 2008, a new, optional lane departure warning system uses a camera to detect lane markings and alert the driver with steering-wheel vibrations if the car drifts astray. Also optional is a high-beam assistant that switches the headlights to low beams when it detects oncoming traffic. Other options include night vision and a head-up display; I’ve detailed both in the “More technology” thumbnail above.\n\nReliability reports are a bit hard to come by for $80,000 luxury coupes. Neither the XLR nor the XJ had sufficient sample sizes for Consumer Reports to compile any ratings. The 6 Series didn’t have enough samples in 2007, but the 2005 and 2006 models fared worse than average and average, respectively. CR cited body hardware and audio systems as trouble spots, and it predicts worse than average reliability for a new model. The SL fares a bit worse; the 911 does much better.\n\nFeatures & Pricing\nThe BMW 6 series 650i coupe starts at $76,600, and the convertible starts at $83,700. Standard features include leather, power front seats and a tilting glass roof on the coupe. The automatic is a no-charge option. Chargeable options include everything from $500 heated seats, which really ought to be standard, to the $2,400 Pearl Leather upgrade. The Sport package runs $2,100.\n\nAll told, some $17,000 in options are available — enough to put the convertible into six-figure territory.\n\n6 Series in the Market\nThe 6 Series is competent in all the important areas, and BMW has kept it fresh enough that I don’t think its five-year vintage puts it at a significant disadvantage. (The ’09 SL, remember, is the face-lifted version of a car that’s been around since early 2002.) Other competitors, from the XK to the 911, occupy disparate sections of the performance-luxury axis. The 6 sits in between: It merges performance with the sort of luxury few BMWs can evince, and, improbably, its asking price ends up being fairly competitive. It’s a marvelous choice for many reasons, and practicality might just end up being the least of them.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "What to say about a car whose presentation and ride seems perfect, but overall is not much fun?\n\nThat’s the case with today’s test car, the 2007 BMW 650i convertible. Make no mistake, this is a world-class touring car and I could imagine it ripping up the Autobahn in Germany or twisting through the Alps at high speeds.\n\nHeck, even the previously confounding I-Drive controls (picture a computer mouse between the seats and a screen at center dash that tells you how you are doing) were relatively manageable in this model.\n\nYet, it lacked the sporty feel I have come to expect from BMW. The ride was relatively soft, and even the sport mode, with its noticeable uptick in revs, could not convince me I was ready to rock.\n\nThere was a sense of vague steering, a trait appreciated by drivers of a certain age who liked their cars to handle like a wood-hulled Chris-Craft on Lake Winnipesaukee.\n\nThe car is definitely not lacking in power — its 4.8-liter V-8 engine produces 360 horsepower and 360 lb.-ft. of torque. Were the 650i not a rear-wheel-drive beast, I could imagine plowing snow with this car (and a BMW with a plow would make a statement in my New Hampshire surroundings).\n\nThe engine has about 35 more horsepower than previous BMWs in this series, but it seems like a subtle tweak. You can easily move beyond all prudence and law, but a lot of cars in today’s high-horsepower market can do that.\n\nIn trying to get a grip on what this car is all about, I think big American steel. Its electronics, engine, and interior design are far superior to most of what American companies have ever built (though Cadillac and, yes, Saturn are moving the blocks). Still, it felt bulky and bodacious in a boring sort of way. That is hard to say about a car that, as tested, costs more than $90,000.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, if plush leather, ample leg room for four, and the chance to drop your top on a weekend cruise to Kennebunkport are your thing, this is a smart choice. And that 360 horsepower can feel like 400 when you pull away after depositing your money at the Hampton tollbooths.\n\nDespite the slightly soft ride, the car does hold flat in hard corners (with some body roll), and accelerates from highway entrance ramp to passing lane with ease.\n\nStability and traction control are standard, as are antilock brakes, roll stabilization, and front side air bags.\n\nA cold-weather package that includes heated front seats, a heated steering wheel, and ski bag adds $750 to the base price of about $81,000. Toss in a sport package with sport seats, exterior trim, 19-inch alloy wheels, and performance run-flat tires and you add another $1,800. Head-up display and night vision (see white bodies on your windshield before you see them in the flesh) add an additional $3,200. An upgraded sound system will cost $1,200 more, something that seems odd in a car that is already so expensive.\n\nIn reviewing the 650i convertible I feel like a guy who just won $35 million in the lottery, but complains about the hit he’s taking from the IRS. I was paid to drive a $90,000 BMW — should I have even a hint of dissatisfaction?\n\nRoyal Ford can be reached at ford@globe.com.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in June 2008 about the 2008 BMW 6 Series. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s changed for 2009, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe BMW 6 Series blends performance and luxury in a way few BMWs, relative to their competitors, have managed to do, and it throws in just enough practicality that it might actually suffice as the only car you’d own. Don’t get me wrong: This is no sedan substitute, but it does pack just enough utility to give it a leg to stand on when your sensibilities — or spouse — try to rein you in.\n\nThe 6 Series comes as a 650i coupe or soft-top convertible. There’s also a high-performance M6 version that’s covered separately on Cars.com. The current 6 Series was introduced for 2004; through the years it’s received a larger engine and, for 2008, a few styling tweaks. Click here to see a comparison with the 2007 model.\n\nGoing & Stopping\nBehind the 650i’s twin-kidney grille is a 360-horsepower, 4.8-liter V-8. Noise levels belie the power — the engine purrs quietly at idle and gives only a perfunctory yowl when it’s revved, but it moves the car along with authoritative torque from anywhere on the tach. Acceleration is so smooth and persistent that you’ll easily hit the engine’s 6,500-rpm redline — there is little sign you’re about to reach its limit.\n\nMy coupe had a six-speed manual transmission. It hits each gate with definitive, medium throws. The clutch is hefty but not overly so — I’d expected something heavier, and it actually proved a welcome tool for creeping through traffic. Like in other stick-shift BMWs, the shifting can feel a bit rubbery at times, but short of the Porsche 911 there’s little to compare it to in this segment.\n\nMore impressive is the 6 Series’ accelerator response. Credit BMW’s Valvetronic system, whose variable-valve mechanics are more elaborate than most. It yields immediate pedal response, and there’s no waiting as the needle crests the tachometer — it comes down as quickly as it goes up, which makes for more precise, if not easier, downshift rev-matching. A Sport button behind the shifter quickens accelerator response and decreases power steering assist for more turning precision; both deliver noticeable differences. After a few days I left Sport mode on all the time. It can make for touchy acceleration in stop-and-go traffic, though, which may take some practice to iron out. My advice: Decide early on if you want Sport or not, then groom your driving habits accordingly.\n\nA six-speed automatic is optional. It comes with standard steering-wheel paddle shifters and two Sport modes — one with the shifter in its manual-shift gate, which holds lower gears longer for better acceleration and increased engine braking, and the other coming with a press of the automatic’s Sport button, which quickens accelerator response and holds gears even longer. BMW’s ill-received Sequential Manual Gearbox, offered through the 2007 model year, has been ditched.\n\nWith the manual, BMW says the 650i accelerates from zero to 60 mph in just 5.3 seconds. The automatic takes only 5.4 seconds. The 650i convertible weighs a significant 463 pounds extra — about 12 percent — so it comes in at 5.6 and 5.7 seconds for the manual and automatic, respectively. Those figures put the car ahead of a Cadillac XLR or Jaguar XK, according to their respective automakers; the featherweight Porsche 911 and headstrong Mercedes SL550 are quicker still.\n\nAcceleration Compared\n \tDrivetrain\t0-to-60 mph, coupe (sec.)\t0-to-60 mph, conv.

The pedal feels more linear than in some BMWs — which have a tendency for grabbier response — but it’s just as strong. Brake-fade compensation, which applies greater pressure when brake fade has occurred, and a brake-drying feature that attempts to keep the discs dry when it’s raining are also standard.\n\nOptional advanced cruise control integrates full stop-and-go functionality, much like Mercedes’ Distronic Plus. It can bring the 6 Series to a complete stop and resume acceleration to a set distance behind the car ahead. My test car didn’t have it, so I can offer no evaluation.\n\nRide & Handling\nLike any car nearing the $100,000 mark, the 6 Series augments a conventional four-wheel-independent suspension with a host of technical wizardry. The results are impressive: The car remains planted even in bumpy corners, with minimal lean or lateral wheel hop. Quick lane changes yield a bit more body roll, but on straight roads the car rides smoothly. All told, the 6 doesn’t achieve the same ride and handling magic as the XK with its fully adaptive suspension, but it isn’t far off. An optional Sport package adds bigger wheels and sportier seats, but suspension tuning remains the same; BMW says the convertible’s heavier-duty suspension is also tuned to provide an identical feel to the coupe’s.\n\nBuyers get a choice of two steering setups. The basic Servotronic system can vary the steering ratio for easier response at parking lot speeds and better straight-line stability on the highway. An optional Active Steering system does so even more radically; if you get Active Steering, though, the Sport button near the gearshift won’t alter its precision. My car had the more basic setup, which proved much easier to turn than in the 1 Series and 3 Series, particularly at low speeds. Fear not, performance fans: The steering still preserves BMW’s legendary turn-in precision on curvier roads. In tight quarters, the 6 Series’ turning circle is 37.4 feet, 1.2 feet more than the XK or SL.\n\nSwitch off the car’s electronic stability system and it doesn’t take much to push the rear wheels wide. The 6 Series does so fairly controllably. The chassis strikes a fairly neutral oversteer/understeer balance, so if you’re feeling especially gutsy, four-wheel power slides are entirely possible — and it’s easy to rein things in with your right foot.\n\nExterior & Styling\nBMW designer Chris Bangle came under fire for his earlier designs on the 7 Series and 5 Series, but the 6 Series doesn’t seem quite so severe. I found its proportions appropriate — there’s minimal front overhang, and the cabin sits nicely toward the rear of the car. The humplike trunk, probably my least favorite attribute, blends in from most viewing angles.\n\nThere are a number of slight changes for 2008, including revised lower bumpers and new lenses for the headlights and taillights. Check out the thumbnails on the right to see some of them.\n\nEighteen-inch alloy wheels are standard. The Sport package adds 19-inchers.\n\nCabin & Seating\nAppointments are what you’d expect of this class. The aluminum trim in my test car had an upscale, textured feel; wood trim is optional, and both materials are genuine. My test car came outfitted with optional sport seats, whose substantial side bolsters still leave ample room for comfort. (Disclaimer: On a good day, my waist is 35 inches.) Combined with the relative open space — the dash sits low and slopes gradually toward the windshield — they give the 6 a grand-touring feel not unlike the XK or SL. It’s a departure from BMW’s stricter interiors that I suspect many shoppers will welcome.\n\nFit and finish are excellent, and so are the materials. Leather seats are standard, but opt for the upgraded Pearl Leather I had in my test car and you also get a leather-wrapped dashboard. That isn’t offered on the 5 Series, and it’s only available in the 7 Series on the $120,000-plus 760i. Sun-reflective leather, which stays cooler in direct sunlight, is standard on the convertible. Cars.com reviewer David Thomas tested it out in a BMW convertible last month, and he came away impressed with its heat-resisting abilities.\n\nOther features, most of them standard, include a power tilt/telescoping steering wheel, power seats and a fixed glass roof on the coupe. The seats have fairly conventional adjustments, unlike a loaded XK or SL, where you can stiffen the side bolsters or extend the seat cushions at the push of a button. Oh, the toil.\n\nThe standard navigation system uses BMW’s iDrive controller. BMW upgraded the graphics and added six programmable shortcut buttons on the dash for 2008, which can link to anything from a map destination to a Bluetooth phone number. They help, but I’d still like a hard-coded “Back” button near the controller. I’ll confine my other complaints to the picture captions (iDrive is a very, very dead horse), but competitively, the 6 Series is not necessarily at a clear disadvantage: The XK, its closest competitor, has a friendlier navigation setup, but its menus load at a glacial pace.\n\nThe standard CD stereo has eight speakers and an auxiliary MP3 jack. My test car had upgraded Logic7 audio with 13 speakers, a USB jack for portable music devices and both satellite and hi-def radio. HD radio, offered by BMW and several others, is a boon if you frequent AM stations; it enhances sound quality to near-FM levels. I didn’t notice much of a quality difference in FM radio, but Cars.com reviewer Mike Hanley thought it brought audio quality closer to CD levels. Either way, HD radio options appear more prevalent on FM than AM. From my house a few miles north of downtown Chicago, I counted 18 of 23 FM stations broadcasting in HD, while just four of my 15 AM stations were.\n\nPractical Aspects\nLike the XK, the 6 Series is realistically a two-seater. The rear seats are better suited for groceries than people — it’s a similar situation in the XK and 911 — but having them allows for short trips with kids that would be impossible in an SL or XLR.\n\nThe backseat will likely become a vestibule for smaller items anyway, because storage areas up front are in short supply. The glove compartment is too small even for the owner’s manual, and apart from a shallow center console, the cabin is lacking any storage space.\n\nNone of the 6 Series’ competitors are known for storage abundance, so BMW isn’t necessarily behind the pack. Even if it is, its trunk puts it back in front: The coupe’s boasts 13.0 cubic feet of space, which handily beats the competition. Convertibles have 12.4 cubic feet with the top up and 10.6 cubic feet with the top down; both figures also lead the competition. Like I said earlier, this doesn’t make the 6 a car for everyone, but it does mean it could carry two people and a full week’s worth of luggage. Most competitors would be good for a weekend at best.\n\nLiving Space Compared\n \tSeats\tFront headroom (in.), coupe/conv.\tFront legroom (in.)\tCargo volume, coupe (cu. ft.)\tCargo volume, conv., top up/down (cu. ft.)\nPorsche 911 Carrera\t4\t38.0/38.0\t41.6\t4.4\t4.4/4.4\nBMW 650i\t4\t37.6/37.8\t42.0\t13.0\t12.4/10.6\nMercedes SL550\t2\t–/37.7\t42.9\t—\t10.2/7.2\nCadillac XLR\t2\t–/37.6\t42.6\t—\t11.6/4.4\nJaguar XK\t4\t37.4/37.0\t43.0\t10.6\t10.0/7.1\nSource: Manufacturer data for 2008 models except 2009 Mercedes SL550.\n\nSafety & Reliability\nAs of this writing, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety had not crash tested the 6 Series. Standard safety features on the coupe include front and seat-mounted side-impact airbags, dual knee airbags and tube-style head-protection airbags for the front seats. The head airbags extend a bit past the B-pillar, but not enough to protect rear-seat passengers. The convertible lacks the head-protection airbags, as do most convertibles. It has pop-up roll bars behind the rear seats that deploy during a rollover.\n\nActive head restraints, four-wheel-disc antilock brakes, traction control and an electronic stability system are standard across the line. Also standard are adaptive brake lights that illuminate brighter under hard braking. For 2008, a new, optional lane departure warning system uses a camera to detect lane markings and alert the driver with steering-wheel vibrations if the car drifts astray. Also optional is a high-beam assistant that switches the headlights to low beams when it detects oncoming traffic. Other options include night vision and a head-up display; I’ve detailed both in the “More technology” thumbnail above.\n\nReliability reports are a bit hard to come by for $80,000 luxury coupes. Neither the XLR nor the XJ had sufficient sample sizes for Consumer Reports to compile any ratings. The 6 Series didn’t have enough samples in 2007, but the 2005 and 2006 models fared worse than average and average, respectively. CR cited body hardware and audio systems as trouble spots, and it predicts worse than average reliability for a new model. The SL fares a bit worse; the 911 does much better.\n\nFeatures & Pricing\nThe 650i coupe starts at $76,600, and the convertible starts at $83,700. Standard features include leather, power front seats and a tilting glass roof on the coupe. The automatic is a no-charge option. Chargeable options include everything from $500 heated seats, which really ought to be standard, to the $2,400 Pearl Leather upgrade. The Sport package runs $2,100.\n\nAll told, some $17,000 in options are available — enough to put the convertible into six-figure territory.\n\n6 Series in the Market\nThe 6 Series is competent in all the important areas, and BMW has kept it fresh enough that I don’t think its five-year vintage puts it at a significant disadvantage. (The ’09 SL, remember, is the face-lifted version of a car that’s been around since early 2002.) Other competitors, from the XK to the 911, occupy disparate sections of the performance-luxury axis. The 6 sits in between: It merges performance with the sort of luxury few BMWs can evince, and, improbably, its asking price ends up being fairly competitive. It’s a marvelous choice for many reasons, and practicality might just end up being the least of them.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle OverviewBMW reintroduced the 6 Series to the U.S. market in coupe and convertible forms for 2004. The luxury sport two-doors were related to the company’s 5 Series sedan.\nFor 2006, the 6 Series uses a new 360-horsepower, 4.8-liter V-8 and is now badged 650. All models now have an engine start/stop button. The standard Dynamic Stability Control system gains brake-fade compensation, brake standby, brake drying and a start-off assist feature.\n Lightweight construction makes ample use of aluminum and composite materials. Dynamic Driving Control is standard. At the touch of a button, the two-level system alters steering and allows the transmission to hold gears longer.\nExteriorExhibiting what BMW calls classic proportions, the coupe is long, low and wide and features a sculptured power dome hood. Set back on the chassis, the passenger compartment has a low roofline. A large, tilting panorama glass roof is standard on coupes.\nAn all-aluminum suspension minimizes unsprung weight. Convertibles have a vertical glass rear window that powers up and down and serves as a wind blocker when the top is down. Standard adaptive headlights swivel to illuminate curvy roads.\nPark Distance Control, Active Roll Stabilization and 18-inch run-flat tires are standard. Active Cruise Control and Active Steering, which varies the degree to which the front wheels turn, are optional.\nInteriorUp to four occupants can fit inside the 2+2 coupe and the convertible. With BMW’s iDrive system, a console knob controls multiple comfort and convenience functions. Heated front seats, Sirius Satellite Radio and a Logic7 audio system are optional.\nUnder the HoodThe 650’s 4.8-liter V-8 produces 360 hp and 360 pounds-feet of torque. Three six-speed transmissions are offered: manual, automatic with a manual-shift provision and BMW’s Sequential Manual Gearbox, which incorporates a selector lever and shift paddles on the steering wheel.\nSafetyBMW’s Head Protection System in coupes combines inflatable tubular elements with a stabilizing sail for increased protection. Side-impact airbags for the front seats are standard. Convertibles are fitted with roll bars that deploy in an emergency.\nDriving ImpressionsLike most BMWs, the 6 Series is a serious driver’s car. The suspensions are sufficiently taut, and occupants may experience a jittery sensation while traversing certain surfaces. This excess motion doesn’t really result in a harsh ride, and it’s a small price to pay for such superior control.\nThe seats are satisfyingly supportive, snugly bolstered and more comfortable than their firm cushions suggest. Backseat space is nearly nonexistent when the front seats are moved rearward. Visibility in the coupe is acceptable, but the mirrors could be larger and the B-pillars and tapered rear quarter glass impose some limits. BMW’s iDrive system is technically innovative, yet it’s sure to annoy some drivers.",

      "expert_review": "The 2012 BMW 6 Series is a lot of car for a lot of money, but this luxurious coupe lives up to the hype with a ton of amazing features, a ginormous engine and gorgeous looks.\n\nWhat’s not to like about this four-seater? If I tell you that because it goes from zero to 60 mph in 4.8 seconds the excitement is over pretty quickly, you’re not going to feel too sorry for me. The giggling from the kids in the backseat stopped as soon as it started, and they were instantly begging me to put the pedal to the metal again.\n\nIn case you need a little help lightening the leadfoot, there are three driving modes to help out. Sport+ lets you put the hammer down and adjusts the tuning and suspension to get the fastest, most responsive experience out of the 650i. Sport is a milder version of Sport+, and Comfort is, well, softer and less stiff. You can still stomp on it and get a respectable amount of speed even while in Comfort mode, but steering did feel a bit soft.\n\nAfter a while, the raw power of the turbocharged V-8 started to lose its novelty — I know, I can’t believe I just said that — and I stopped flooring it everywhere I went. That’s when I got to see more of what the 2012 650i is really about with its premium stereo system, a list of safety features as long as your arm, a pampering experience with leather everywhere, heated seats, a heated steering wheel and a huge moonroof.\n\nThe 2012 BMW 650i coupe starts at $83,895 (including an $895 destination charge), and my test car, a 650i xDrive coupe, had a starting price of $86,895. My test car cost a cool $100,825.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe 650i looks beautiful. Its sleek redesign puts more sinewy lines along the body than the previous generation, and tapered taillights combined with the sculpted trunk lid make for a gorgeous rear end. The front end has a small, BMW-style dual-kidney grille and menacing LED headlights, which highlight that this is no everyday vehicle. This car will chew you up if you cross it.\n\nWhat was more menacing than the headlights were the groans from my kids, ages 7 and 9. “Not another two-door!” They didn’t care that it’s a BMW. They didn’t care how much it cost, and they didn’t care how much horsepower it had (well, they cared a little about that). They did care that it’s endlessly tricky to get in and out of the 650i. They found it frustrating to remember which lever or button to push to move the front seats and create second-row access and then they struggled to get into the backseat. Once in, they were in great shape and enjoyed having their own bucket seats in the back.\n\nThe 650i’s trunk has 16.2 cubic feet of cargo space, which is enough for a grocery run but a double stroller might be too big for it. The coupe has a standard power trunk lid naturally, and my test car had the Cold Weather Package ($750), which adds an integrated ski bag to the trunk as well as heated front seats and a heated steering wheel. All these features would come in handy for jaunts up to the mountains.\n\nMy kids and I enjoyed the 650i’s 400-horsepower, turbocharged 4.4-liter V-8. It was a thrill to drive and fun to listen to the thunderous V-8 in this refined German car. Mostly, I wonder if it’s a bit of overkill. I don’t say that to be a party pooper; I say that because it’s a lot of car in every respect. The 650i coupe xDrive gets an EPA-estimated 15/20 mpg city/highway and requires premium gas.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Not Really\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Groove-On\n\nINTERIOR\nThe 650i’s interior is attractive and masculine. The black-colored gauge cluster, dash and center console pair beautifully with the gorgeous cream-colored leather seats. On the floor, matching beige carpet looks luxurious and soft; I wanted to put my bare feet on it until a few seconds later when I got it all dirty from my shoes.\n\nIn the driver’s seat, an optional illuminated head-up display shows the speed (don’t worry, no one but you can see it), so there’s no claiming you had no idea how fast you were going in the event you get pulled over. It also will show turn-by-turn navigation — a navigation system is standard — in hyper-detail. It’s so slick and useful that it will surely win you over, too. There’s a handy port in the center console for an iPhone to sync with the system. The problem is, one needs to remove the iPhone case to do this. It’s inconvenient and because I just put a new case on my iPhone, I didn’t try it out. My son tried his iPod Touch (several generations old now) and it didn’t work.\n\nThe two rear seats are bolstered and comfortable for kids who aren’t in child-safety seats. There’s a dedicated console between the rear passenger seats, so the 650i coupe doesn’t pretend to be a five-seater. The console, which has two cupholders, makes carpool drop-off a bit tricky because my kids had to clamber over the console to get out on the car’s passenger side. The backseat’s dark, cavernous feel is alleviated by the panoramic moonroof, which was a favorite of my kids.\n\nAdults sitting in the rear seats will quickly find themselves uncomfortable due to the small amount of legroom. This is manageable because of the deeper bucket seats, but a longer road trip would likely be out of the question.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\nSAFETY\nAs you can probably guess, fitting child-safety seats into the 650i was difficult. The 650i has two sets of lower Latch anchors in the rear seats. They’re easy to access, but space is at a premium in the backseat. I had one really narrow booster seat that fit — sort of; I couldn’t get the seat leveled quite right. A rear-facing infant-safety seat fit in the second row, but I had to move the front passenger seat forward and its seatback into an upright position that wasn’t comfortable.\n\nThe 650i has standard rear-wheel drive, antilock brakes with brake assist, adaptive cruise control, an electronic stability system with traction control, active head restraints in the front row, a backup camera and seven airbags, including side curtains for both rows and a driver’s knee airbag.\n\nThere are numerous optional features on the 650i. My test car had the Driver Assistance Package with lane departure and blind spot warning systems, the head-up display I liked so much and side- and top-view cameras, which show a bird’s-eye view of the car. This optional feature is helpful when parking. Because my test car also had an M Sport Package, it had active roll stabilization and LED fog lights. These packages added $7,700 to the 650i’s price tag. All-wheel drive is also optional.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2012 BMW 650i here.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nSubtle updates grace the 2016 BMW 6 Series, which, typical of BMW, still comes in all manner of styles. You can get a 6 Series coupe, convertible or four-door Gran Coupe. Three engines pair with rear- or all-wheel drive and two automatic transmissions. Top among them is the high- performance M6 model, which can still come with a manual transmission to please the sports-car traditionalists.\n\nExteriorBMW’s twin-kidney grilles have nine bars apiece on the 640i and 650i, down from the current 10, while the M6 gets its own twin grilles with six pairs of bars apiece. All cars have new scalloped cutouts on the headlights’ inboard sides; adaptive LED lights are standard. The largest visual change comes in the lower bumper, where the opening now expands at its outer edges like on the 4 Series. LED fog lights cap the flared edges, with unique surrounding trim on the 6 Series convertible versus the coupe and Gran Coupe.\n\nAn M Sport Edition returns with 20-inch alloy wheels and some exterior modifications. The M6 has more aggressive bumpers with three separate openings. It’s similar to the 2012-2015 M6, which makes the 2016 M6 harder to tell apart. A carbon-fiber roof comes on the M6 coupe and Gran Coupe.\n\nIn back, six-cylinder models also have larger tailpipe openings. The Gran Coupe returns with four doors and a coupe-like profile. All models have reshaped side mirrors, which BMW says are more aerodynamic.\n\nInteriorAs before, the 6 Series’ interior features a sweeping dashboard contour that stretches from the passenger side down to the center console; the entire dash can come wrapped in leather, with an open-pore finish if specified. A semi-floating screen perches above the center air vents. Both the coupe and convertible seat four occupants; the Gran Coupe seats five.\n\nA navigation system and heated front seats with power adjusters and memory settings are standard across all 6 Series models. The leather upholstery in the convertible has a reflective treatment that reduces the heat given off during sunny days. The Gran Coupe’s backseat has optional seat heaters and side-window sunshades.\n\nBMW’s familiar iDrive system carries a touchpad atop the knob controller. Premium audio options include Harman Kardon or Bang & Olufsen stereos.\n\nUnder the HoodEngines carry over with a 315-horsepower, turbocharged six-cylinder engine in the 640i and a 445 -hp, turbo V-8 in the 650i. Both engines drive the rear wheels through an eight-speed automatic transmission. BMW says its optional xDrive all-wheel-drive system improves acceleration, with the 650i xDrive coupe and Gran Coupe hitting 60 mph in 4.3 seconds. A new exhaust on the 640i, meanwhile, makes for a more aggressive sound. Drivers can adjust it through BMW’s Driving Experience Control system, which changes the exhaust note among other systems to various comfort-, efficiency- or sport-oriented settings.\n\nOptional suspension setups include adaptive shock absorbers, as well as an active suspension that counters body roll in real time. Other systems include rear-wheel steering, which BMW says aids steering response and reduces the turning circle.\n\nThe M6 employs a turbocharged V-8 that’s good for 560 hp. It drives the rear wheels through a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission or a six-speed manual. The M6 model is available in all three body styles. A standard active rear differential routes power proactively between the rear wheels. High-performance carbon-ceramic brakes are optional.\n\nSafetyA night-vision camera system is available; so is lane-departure warning and adaptive cruise control with full-stop capabilities, pedestrian warning capabilities and auto-braking forward collision warning.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in August 2011 about the 2012 BMW 650. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2013, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\nOne of the greatest leaps in automotive progress this past decade has been the taming of the convertible. Once requiring a tradeoff — open-air enjoyment versus performance and year-round comfort — today’s convertibles are increasingly civilized beasts, making the body style more practical than ever.\nDespite its considerable handling and power, however, the gorgeously redesigned 2012 BMW 650i has missed out on all that progress.\nIt remains a convertible at heart, with an incredibly loud ride and a gigantic blind spot with the top up. When the top’s down, though, drivers will enjoy a pleasant open-air experience as a terrific-sounding exhaust powers them down sun-kissed roads.\nNew LooksThe redesigned 650i is striking. The hood seems even longer now, with extremely small kidney grilles up front. New taillights — similar to those on the recently redesigned 5 Series — change the rear design significantly. The retractable canvas top connects to the car with long rear cowls that are even more pronounced than last year’s.\nIt’s a stunning look, top up or down, with an elegant cabin to match. It also borrows from the new 5 and 7 Series with an updated iDrive multimedia system, a digital gauge cluster and comfortable leather seats that add to the upscale feel of this $90,500 convertible.\nPerformanceThe 650i is the only 6 Series trim available for 2012; the convertible is hitting the market ahead of the hardtop coupe. The rear wheels are powered by a 400-horsepower, twin-turbo 4.4-liter V-8 engine. It comes with either a six-speed manual or eight-speed automatic transmission at no additional charge … sort of. The manual gets 15/22 mpg, and with that comes a $1,000 gas-guzzler tax.\nMy test 650i came with the eight-speed automatic, good for 16/24 mpg city/highway. Performance fans won’t mind the eight-speed: It shifts quickly and smoothly, and steering-wheel-mounted shift paddles allow for manual shifting.\nThe 650i also has separate settings that allow you to select a Sport mode that delivers faster accelerator response while maintaining a normal suspension setup. A second sport mode — Sport+ — alters the suspension and stability control system for more serious driving.\nFor most drivers, the first Sport mode will be all they need. Even in the Normal and Comfort settings — meant for a slightly softer ride — owners get a lot of acceleration on demand, with a healthy exhaust note.\nIt doesn’t have the guttural sound of Jaguar’s XKR convertible — a faster, more powerful competitor — but it’s just enough to enjoy when the top is down.\nFor such a large vehicle, the 650i handles exceptionally well. Like the new 5 Series, it doesn’t have an overly heavy steering feel, but it still delivers excellent feedback through twisty sections of road. And even with its considerable length, the 650i is relatively easy to navigate through parking lots.\nLike the 5 Series, the 650i features a type of regenerative braking to help overall mileage, similar to the technology hybrid and electric cars use to store energy generated from slowing the car down. In our test of the 5 Series, the car’s brake feel suffered, but it appears BMW may be working on that issue with successive models; the 650i’s regenerative braking system was not as noticeable.\nGiven its fuel economy ratings, the 650i could use all the mileage help it can get. That said, we doubt most luxury owners look at mileage as a primary factor when buying a V-8-powered convertible.\nConvertible FaultsWhen the top is down, the 650i is truly magnificent. Very little wind intrudes on front passengers, and the car feels rigid — very rigid. Like a tank.\nThe cruising experience is terrific right until you have to put the top up. My wife and I took a short road trip to Milwaukee from Chicago, leaving the kids behind. Sounds like it should be an idyllic time, but the drive itself — over various concrete and asphalt highways — was loud. Noise from the shoddy surfaces was extreme, and the canvas top let in more noise from passing semi trucks than I thought it should. Jaguar’s canvas-topped XK is an improvement over the 650i in this regard, as well.\nLowering or raising the powered top is as easy as pressing a button, and it can be initiated while moving at low speeds. I also appreciated the accompanying clear, audible alert, along with a visual cue on the gauge cluster, to indicate when the process was complete.\nThe convertible top’s long “tails” make for interesting styling when in place, but they also create a huge blind spot. There is little visibility for backing out of parking spaces, which is why it’s a good thing the 650i comes equipped with a variety of parking sensors. On the open road, I found the mirrors adequate enough for merging. The large glass rear window also helped with visibility while driving.\nFeaturesLike most up-level BMWs these days, the 650i can be equipped with a dizzying array of technological wizardry. Ours came equipped with an optional lane departure warning and correction system, adaptive cruise control, and night vision with pedestrian detection to help drivers see better on dark roads.\nThe only piece of optional technology that I would choose to add to my 650i — with its already high starting price — would be the revised head-up display.\nFew automakers offer the feature — GM is the most notable other one — but I find it extremely useful. Besides displaying the current speed in the windshield using a digital projection, it also offers route information from the navigation system, which is standard. Unlike in previous BMWs — including the current X5 SUV — this route information is detailed and in color.\nI used it on the way home from Milwaukee, and it quickly became my favorite guidance device yet.\nWhile navigation is standard, the head-up display is part of a $3,900 package that includes the lane departure system, blindspot detection, top-view cameras and an automatic parking feature. Night vision is an extra $2,600. My test car also had a premium sound package that added $1,800 to the price, and a $1,500 luxury seating package with ventilated front seats that automatically adjust when cornering, meaning the seat’s bolsters move inward to hug the driver during turns. All told, our 650i test car was $104,225.\nThat 2011 Jaguar XKR I like so much starts at $102,125, but it comes with ventilated seats, navigation and a premium Bowers & Wilkins stereo. There’s no night vision, and it lacks some of the BMW’s other gadgetry, but it’s more fun to drive and live with.\nSafetyThe BMW 650i has not been crash-tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. Neither organization typically tests low-volume cars with sticker prices this high.\nThe 650i comes with seat-mounted side airbags. Because it’s a convertible, there are no roof-mounted side curtain airbags. You can see all the standard safety features here.\nIt also comes with an emergency telematics service — like GM’s OnStar — called BMW Assist. It includes four years of collision notification, emergency request, roadside assistance and stolen vehicle recovery.\nBMW 650i in the MarketI may prefer the Jaguar to the BMW, but the 650i is still a remarkable machine that will find plenty of fans among current BMW owners. Does it deliver a luxurious convertible interior and a gorgeous exterior? Yes. Is it lovely to cruise around town in? For sure. Would I invest $100,000 in one? Probably not.\nMost BMW shoppers, however, look to Mercedes and Audi as competitors, not Jaguar. As neither of those companies have a model that offers similar performance and size, the 650i should sell quite well.\n\n\n\n  Send David an          email",
