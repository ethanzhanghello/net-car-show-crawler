      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nBMW’s compact rear-wheel-drive 128i is currently the least-expensive entry point to BMW’s entire lineup. Available as a coupe or convertible, the compact 1 Series occupies a space with few competitors. The Nissan 370Z, Infiniti G37 coupe and top-end versions of Detroit’s muscle cars come closest to filling out the competitive slate.\n\nThe 135i is covered separately in Cars.com’s Research section.\nNew for 2013\nThere are no significant changes.\nExterior\nOn the 128i, an optional M Sport Package adds dark window frames and a more aggressive front bumper with three large air inlets. Rather than the 3 Series convertible’s folding metal hardtop, the 128i convertible has a fabric soft-top that can open or close in 22 seconds, BMW says. It operates at speeds up to 25 mph.\n\nThe 1 Series remains a small car overall, about 2 inches shorter and narrower than a Scion tC. The BMW 3 Series coupe is about 10 inches longer. Exterior features include:\n\n\n17-inch wheels standard\nRain-sensing windshield wipers\nFog lamps\nChrome exhaust tips\nAvailable power tilt/sliding moonroof \nOptional xenon headlamps and automatic high beams\n\nInterior\nThe 128i’s interior design is fairly traditional, with more upright shapes than sweeping contours. Dual-zone climate controls sit below the center air vents and optional navigation system, with BMW’s iDrive knob controller ahead of the center console. The system can read text messages aloud or stream songs off a paired smartphone.\n\nThe available M Sport Package adds unique headliner materials, an M-branded steering wheel and shifter, and sport seats with more aggressive side bolstering. Interior features include:\n\n\n60/40 split folding seat (coupe models)\nStandard vinyl seats, leather optional\nOptional power seats\nAvailable rear parking sensors\nOptional navigation\nOptional heated seats and steering wheel\n\nUnder the Hood\nBMW’s inline-six-cylinder engine makes 230 horsepower and 200 pounds-feet of torque in the 128i. It works through a six-speed manual or a six-speed automatic with optional steering wheel paddle shifters . The automaker says a stick-shift 128i coupe can hit 60 mph in 6.1 seconds, with the automatic making the sprint in 6.7 seconds. The M Sport Package adds a sport-tuned suspension.\n\nIf that isn’t enough, consider stepping up to the 300-hp, turbocharged 135i, which is covered separately in the Cars.com Research section. It trims the zero-to-60 mph sprint down to about 5 seconds, BMW says.\nSafety\nActive head restraints, two-row side curtain airbags, front airbags and side-impact airbags for the front seats are all standard. So is an electronic stability system, antilock brakes and traction control. Like most convertibles, the 128i convertible does not have the curtain airbags; it does have pop-up roll bars behind the rear seats that deploy in the event of a rollover.",

      "expert_review": "BMW has referred to its vehicles as the “ultimate driving machines” for so long the phrase has become as much a part of the company’s identity as Mazda’s “Zoom Zoom.” We’ll leave the “ultimate” claim as a debate for another day. It suffices to say that a BMW is almost always enjoyable to drive.\n\nToday’s featured vehicle – the BMW 128i – is all of that. The 128i is the smaller, engine-wise, of BMW’s two 1 Series coupes. It produces “only” 230 horsepower and 200 lb-ft. of torque from the 3.0-liter inline six. The turbocharged 135i bumps both those figures to 300.\n\nOur test car had a 6-speed Steptronic automatic with paddle shifters. It was fun to use the paddle shifters for a short bit, but just popping it in drive and listening to the exhaust tone quickly changing its tune with the crisp shifts was almost as satisfying. My preference would have been the 6-speed manual, but then I don’t have to sit in commuter traffic on a daily basis, either.\n\nSo, the 128i has plenty of power. It looks great, hardly like the baby, entry-level BMW that it is. It handles great, with true near 50/50 front-engine, rear-wheel drive balance. Unlike the 3 Series, you don’t see as many 1s on the road.\n\nSo what’s not to like?\n\nA few things, especially if you’re a bit of a curmudgeon:\n\nThe price. Our 128i started with a MSRP of $29,200, plus a destination charge of $825. If you could stop there, we could see this as an entry-level sports coupe. However, an array of “normal” BMW options pushed the final price to $41,345. We had the Sport package ($1,300), Premium Package ($3,700), Steptronic with paddles ($1,425), Xenon headlights ($800), and Navigation system ($2,100) as the major add-ons. For comparison, a comparable 3-Series has a base price of $33,600 and would be about $45,500 similarly equipped.\n\nA combination iPod/USB adaptor was $400. That’s more expensive than an iPod!\n\nThe two-part starting “system” is pretentious. Push the key fob into the dash, and then hit the start/stop button. How about reverting to turnkey vehicles?\n\nThe 19 (city) / 28 (highway) EPA fuel economy rating. We averaged 21.3 in driving limited miles. A better combination of power and economy is called for these days.\n\nThe back seat. We had three folks to go riding but couldn’t convince anyone to take a day trip in the back seat. Why consumers buy a car with such all-but-useless rear seats is a head-scratcher. Don’t they have friends? If you buy a BMW it would stand to reason you like to drive and occasionally have the need to carry more than one passenger. I coerced my son – your standard 6-foot, 190-pound issue – to accompany us on a short ride. Mrs. G slid the passenger seat all the way forward, and he endured the contortionist’s role for a 20 minute ride with no repercussions but no good words for the experience.\n\nThe cup holders. There’s a big one – MINI-style – on the passenger side and another tucked half under the center armrest. It’s a bit on the sparse side for Mrs. G who’s inclined to embark on a three-hour morning trip with hot tea, Diet Coke and a bottle of water, almost always guaranteeing a pit stop.\n\nThe rest of the family thought the interior was a bit Spartan, but my feeling was that it was BMW-like.\n\nOn the good side, the 128i comes with a four-year/50,000-mile full maintenance program, stability and traction control, brake-fade and drying systems, and rain-sensing wipers.\n\nAnd the real bottom line, as opposed to the one on the window sticker? It’s a blast to drive.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nBMW’s small 1 Series debuted in the U.S. for 2008 as a coupe and a convertible. The base 128i is powered by an inline-six-cylinder engine that drives the rear wheels. Both body styles also come with a more powerful turbocharged engine as 135i models, covered in a separate report in the Cars.com Research section. The 128i competes with other performance cars like the Mazda RX-8 and Nissan 370Z.\n\nNew for 2011\nOther than changing some optional packages around, BMW made no significant changes to the BMW 128 for 2011.\n\nExterior\nCompared to the 3 Series coupe, the 128i features a more upright grille and a C-pillar that’s not as sleekly styled. A pronounced sheet metal crease runs the length of the coupe’s sides, which are otherwise relatively smooth.\n\nAvailable adaptive xenon headlights follow the direction of the steering wheel\nAvailable automatic high-beam headlights\nStandard heated side mirrors and heated windshield washer jets\nStandard rain-sensing wipers\nConvertible features power-operated soft-top that BMW says can open or close in 22 seconds\n\nInterior\nFront occupants sit on bucket seats, and the backseat has room for two.\n\nAuxiliary jack for connecting an MP3 player\n60/40-split folding rear seat can expand the coupe’s trunk\nOptional Sport Package includes sport seats with more aggressive bolstering\nConvertible’s leather seats have BMW’s Sun Reflective Technology, which is designed to lower the temperature of seats exposed to sunlight\nOptional navigation system equips the 1 Series with BMW’s iDrive control system\nStandard HD radio\n\nUnder the Hood\nBMW’s inline-six-cylinder engine makes 230 horsepower in the 128i. If that isn’t enough, consider stepping up to the 300-hp, twin-turbocharged 135i, which is covered separately in the Cars.com Research section.\n\n230-hp, 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder\nRear-wheel drive\nSix-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission\nOptional paddle shifters with automatic transmission\n\nSafety\nSafety features include:\n\nSide-impact airbags for the front seats\nSide curtain airbags for front and rear occupants\nElectronic stability system\nAntilock brakes\nConvertible loses the side curtain airbags but keeps the side-impact airbags and features pop-up roll bars",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe rear-wheel-drive BMW 1 Series enters its fifth year on the market with a few visual changes, as well as a new higher-performance version from BMW’s M division, dubbed the 1 Series M. At the other end of the lineup is the 128i, which is the least-expensive entry point to BMW’s entire lineup. Available as a coupe or convertible, the compact 1 Series occupies a space with few competitors. The Nissan 370Z, Infiniti G37 coupe and top-end versions of Detroit’s muscle cars come closest to filling out the competitive slate.\nThe 135i is covered separately in Cars.com’s Research section.\n(Skip to details on the: BMW 1 Series M)ExteriorVisual updates for 2012 affect the 128i more than the 135i. The 128i carries revised circular fog lamps, replacing last year’s horizontal lamps. Outboard of the fog lights, vertical slats improve air flow around the fenders, enhancing the car’s aerodynamics. The headlights have new whitecaps up top, mirroring the headlight treatment across most other BMWs. These lights include a string of LEDs embedded in the caps; it’s a visual cue used in the automaker’s redesigned 6 Series.\nOn the 128i, an optional M Sport Package adds dark window frames and a more aggressive front bumper with three large air inlets. Rather than the 3 Series convertible’s folding metal hardtop, the 128i convertible has a fabric soft-top that can open or close in 22 seconds, BMW says. It operates at speeds up to 25 mph.\nThe 1 Series remains a small car overall, about 2 inches shorter and narrower than a Scion tC. The BMW 3 Series coupe is about 10 inches longer.InteriorThe 128i’s interior design is fairly traditional, with more upright shapes than sweeping contours. Dual-zone climate controls sit below the center air vents and optional navigation system, with BMW’s latest-generation iDrive knob controller ahead of the center console. The system can read text messages aloud or stream songs off a paired Blackberry smartphone.\nBMW says the cabin controls boast “a more refined look and feel” for 2012, though the layout is hard to distinguish from 2011’s. In contrast to the seat belts that motor forward for easier reach in the 3 Series coupe, the 1 Series’ belts are fixed onto the B-pillars.\nOn 128i coupes, the two-position backseat folds in a standard 60/40 split. The convertible offers only a center pass-through. Vinyl seats are standard, with leather optional. The M Sport Package adds unique headliner materials, an M-branded steering wheel and shifter, and sport seats with more aggressive side bolstering.Under the HoodBMW’s inline-six-cylinder engine makes 230 horsepower and 200 pounds-feet of torque in the 128i. It works through a six-speed manual or a six-speed automatic. The automaker says a stick-shift 128i coupe can hit 60 mph in 6.1 seconds, with the automatic making the sprint in 6.7 seconds. The M Sport Package adds a sport-tuned suspension.\nIf that isn’t enough, consider stepping up to the 300-hp, turbocharged 135i, which is covered separately in the Cars.com Research section. It trims the zero-to-60 mph sprint down to about 5 seconds, BMW says.SafetyActive head restraints, two-row side curtain airbags, front airbags and side-impact airbags for the front seats are all standard. So is an electronic stability system, antilock brakes and traction control. Like most convertibles, the 128i convertible does not have the curtain airbags; it does have pop-up roll bars behind the rear seats that deploy in the event of a rollover.1 Series MRather than the single-turbo setup from the 135i, the 1 Series M gets a twin-turbo six-cylinder that’s good for 335 hp and 332 pounds-feet of torque. In extreme situations, the 1 Series M can enter an overboost mode to crank out 369 pounds-feet of torque (horsepower remains the same). A standard limited-slip differential can go all the way to lock, rendering maximum straight-line acceleration and better traction on slippery surfaces.\nThe 1 Series M comes only as a coupe, and only with a six-speed manual transmission. Citing a lower center of gravity and overall weight savings of 35 pounds, BMW will not offer the 1 Series’ optional moonroof on the M car. That helps it tip the scales at just under 3,300 pounds, more than 400 pounds less than the 414-hp M3 coupe — the next rung up on BMW’s M ladder. Indeed, the 1 Series M’s zero-to-60 time — just 4.7 seconds, BMW says — ties a stick-shift M3’s.\nVisual changes include unique side mirrors that look similar to those on the M3, as well as a more aggressive front bumper and quad tailpipes. The 1 Series M’s extended fenders house a track that’s 2.8 inches wider up front and 1.8 inches wider in back versus the 135i. The suspension, which shares its aluminum components with the M3, supports lightweight 19-inch wheels. The car also gets cross-drilled 14.2-inch front and 13.8-inch rear brake discs.\nInside, the 1 Series M gets standard sport seats, plus gray gauges and leather-wrapped portions of the dashboard.

      "expert_review": "I’m dubbing the 128i the toddler of BMW’s lineup; while it is scrumptiously attractive and super fun at times, it can be downright testy in day-to-day use, like going to the store or picking the kids up from school. Like a toddler, it appears to be quite compact, but when you try to maneuver it, you realize it’s heavier than you expected. Throughout my weeklong test drive, I kept wishing I had a bit more bicep to help me out.\n\nIn city driving, the 128i seems to be really chomping at the bit. Its steering is solid, but it’ll test your strength (unless your arms actually look like arms and not noodles). It really doesn’t like the 25-45 mph range at all; driving the 128i at these slow speeds is like trying to coerce your toddler into behaving in public – it just wants to run.\n\nAnd run it does! Hang on tight, because when given the opportunity the 128i holds nothing back. My opinion of the car changed dramatically once we were able to let loose at higher speeds, around 70-80 mph. The 128i’s handling became effortless and its performance attitude switched from whiny and disgruntled to positively pleasing. I decided I could afford a little time at the gym if it meant increasing my ability to drive this character.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair\n\nFun Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove On): Groove On\n\nHot! Hot! Hot! This car is so sassy you might want to date it – when it matures a bit, of course. The 128i’s exterior reminds me of James Bond. It’s intelligent yet risky, bold yet refined, and attractive without being an arrogant pretty boy. The front end boasts a confident smirk and the swooping lines along the body make it seem like it’s cruising at 80 mph even at a dead stop.\n\nIts exterior lighting is phenomenal. The 128i sports bi-xenon headlights, which are super bright and swivel as you turn to increase your line of vision. They’re wonderful features for those who hate driving in the dark.\n\nPut the top down and add even more glam to a romantic evening with the hubby or a sunny country drive with the kids. They’ll love it as much as you do!\n\nIn keeping with toddler terminology, I’d say the 128i is more spacious than a crib but nothing like a queen-sized bed. Based on space alone, it’d fall nicely into the toddler or convertible bed category, but the lack of wiggle room didn’t make my family uncomfortable, and I’m learning that I like smaller cars. They give me a snug, tailored-suit feeling, plus I can usually reach everything easily.\n\nThe sport seats in the comfy 128i reinforce this sense of security with bolsters to hold your body and booty in place. When you’re testing its performance capabilities, these built-in pillows will keep you from sliding all over the place; imagine driving with an adult-sized Boppy and you’ll get the picture.\n\nThe controls are easy to spot and use. I especially enjoyed the soothing tangerine-colored glow of the instrument panel when it’s illuminated at night. It’s so relaxing, it reminded me of the nightlight we use at home.\n\nUnlike other cars, the 128i has a gas usage display that’s in constant motion, right down to the second you stop driving. I found this frustrating because I like to track my mpgs but don’t do well with math of any kind, however simple it might be.\n\nI’m undecided as to whether there were one or two cupholders for the front seat; this wasn’t a fear-of-numbers or counting issue. There are, in fact, two cupholders, but one becomes useless if the center armrest is down. Since I truly don’t believe anyone drives with the armrest up, I’m going to say that there’s one usable cupholder for the front seat and none for the back – sorry, kids.\n\nThe 128i is lacking when it comes to what I will call “counter-space” (yes, whether you like it or not I’m bringing a kitchen term into the car). You don’t have places to set stuff. My sunglasses and BlackBerry often sought refuge in the 1.5 cupholders, where they bounced around so much I feared they would jump right out of the cupholders. I could have placed these items in the center compartment, but I didn’t want to dig around in there while I was driving. That’s way too much activity while the car’s moving.\n\nOne thing I can’t leave out is that the cabin of the 128i was peacefully quiet at all times. The 128i has a rumbly-racer sound to it, but you’re only going to hear it if you’re outside the car.\n\nBMW knows safety-conscious drivers might have doubts about the 128i convertible’s soft-top. To calm as many fears as possible, it’s loaded the 128i with safety systems galore, including Dynamic Stability Control, Dynamic Traction Control, antilock brakes, BMW’s Advanced Safety System for integrated deployment of passive and active systems, and Rollover Protection System.\n\nUnfortunately, the 128i’s Insurance Institute for Highway Safety crash-test ratings weren’t available at the time of this review. Check back later to see when they’ve been added to this page.\n\nIIHS Crash-Test Ratings\n\nFrontal-offset (Good, Acceptable, Marginal, Poor): n/a\n\nSide-impact (Good, Acceptable, Marginal, Poor): n/a\n\nRear-crash protection/head restraints (Good, Acceptable, Marginal, Poor): n/a",
