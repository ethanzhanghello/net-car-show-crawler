      "expert_review": "When BMW quietly shut down the Z4 after the 2016 model year, it went out with more of a whimper than a bang. For a few reasons, the Z4 never ended up as a beloved sports car; other models, like the 2 Series and the automaker’s M cars, were the so-called “driver’s cars” in BMW’s lineup, and its two-seat convertible faded away.\n\nRelated: 2019 BMW Z4 Makes Its Official Debut at Pebble Beach\n\nBut after a year or two of finding itself, the Z4 returns for 2019 — this time with the powered soft-top of its roots instead of the retractable hardtop of the recent generation. The 2019 Z4 might get more attention as the foundation that underpins the long-lost Toyota Supra. I headed to a BMW media event in Palm Springs, Calif., to see if the Z4’s return is triumphant or disappointing. (Per our ethics policy, Cars.com pays for its own lodging and transportation at such automaker-sponsored events.)\n\nPlenty of Guts\n\nThe Z4 returns with a more powerful base model, the sDrive30i (which replaces the previous sDrive28i). BMW has also announced an M40i version of the Z4 that will debut later as a 2020 model. Under the hood of the sDrive30i is a 255-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that is mated to a conventional Steptronic eight-speed automatic transmission, not the dual-clutch transmission of some M models. A manual won’t be offered, which sounds almost heretical in a roadster.\n\nIt’s not surprising, though. BMW has stopped offering manual transmissions on a few of its other vehicles (including the new 3 Series and M5 of late). As with other driving enthusiasts, that news made my nose wrinkle. However, I quickly found that my grumpiness was overblown: The eight-speed automatic is done well. Not only does it shift quickly, but the software that chooses the gears is sorted. While I had the Z4 in Sport mode, it did quite a good job of grabbing and — more important — holding the right gear as I wound the car up and down a mountain road. If you still want to choose gears, there are paddle shifters that also do the trick, firing off shifts rapidly. It’s a good transmission, not quite on par with the best ones out there (Porsche’s PDK dual-clutch transmission in particular) but darn close.\n\nTo enjoy any transmission, though, the engine has to back it up. The Z4’s 255 hp is decent for a car with a curb weight of 3,287 pounds, but the real story is the 295 pounds-feet of torque it can put out starting at just 1,500 rpm. That output never feels far away, and since it comes on in the low part of the rev range, it’s easy to keep the Z4 in the power when driving aggressively. From lower speeds to passing maneuvers at higher speeds, the car has good, solid response and feels quicker than its 5.2-second zero-to-60 mph time suggests.\n\nTalk to Me\n\nUnderneath the new Z4 is a new platform, and my vehicle also came outfitted with an adaptive M suspension, a $700 stand-alone option. BMW claims the Z4 has a perfect 50/50 weight distribution, and I found the balance of the car to be another strong suit — especially with the adaptive suspension.\n\nIn its everyday driving modes, the Z4 rides decently over broken pavement. It is still stiffer than your average passenger car, but it won’t beat you up if the roads aren’t track-smooth asphalt. Tighten the car’s settings and the suspension follows the command. The car is quite flat in the turns — almost too flat.\n\nThat brings me to my biggest problem with the Z4: It feels disconnected, and a lot of that falls on the steering. While the Z4’s steering has sufficient weight to it, it’s missing feedback. When you push the car, as the powertrain urges, you want more feedback so that you have a better sense of its grip and what the front tires are doing. I didn’t get that from the steering or, to a lesser degree, the suspension. There’s a disconcerting amount of vagueness when the car is being driven hard, and the end result is that you don’t end up wanting to push it as much.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nResearch the 2019 BMW Z4\nMore BMW Z4 News\nFind More BMWs\nAuto Show Face-Off: 2020 Toyota Supra Vs. 2019 Ford Mustang GT\nBig Interior Upgrade\n\nThe new Z4 is an unquestionable upgrade in terms of technology and interior cabin materials and design. The Vernasca Magma Red leather seats are a color choice that doesn’t cost extra, and I loved the juxtaposition of the matte-gray exterior to the loud color on the seats (which were also quite comfortable). BMW did a good job with the Z4’s driving position; it was easy to set the seat and the wheel right where I wanted it. That’s not always an easy thing to do in a roadster with tighter cabin dimensions.\n\nA pair of 10.25-inch screens also come standard, one in the instrument panel and one in the center of the dashboard. The multimedia system is powered by what BMW calls the seventh generation of its iDrive system. Users have the option of using the touchscreen or the rotary dial between the two seats; both are fine choices, as iDrive has gotten much easier to use over the years. It is missing Android Auto, but Apple CarPlay is available as a subscription (the first year is free, then $80 per year after that). But even as an Android user, I was fine using the built-in system for most tasks. I mostly just missed Google Maps.\n\nWith the top up, road and wind noise were lower than I expected, a pleasant surprise. It obviously won’t be as quiet as a car with a fixed roof, but most roadsters get to be clamorous above a certain speed; the Z4 avoided that.\n\nNo Inflation\n\nThe 2019 Z4 surprisingly comes back with the same price as the 2016 model: $50,695 including destination charges. That’s pretty crazy to think about given the boost in power, technology and cabin quality found on the new car. Perhaps it’s the reversion to a simpler soft-top. The final as-tested price of the Z4 I drove was $62,795 with a few options packages, the aforementioned adaptive suspension and active cruise control.\n\nI think it’s accurate to say that the Z4 drives well. I’d even go so far as to say that it’s very good for the first 90 percent of its capability. It’s that last 10 percent that eats at me, though, and unfortunately, it’s those moments that make or break a sports car. A great sports car asks to be pushed and pushes the driver in kind. That’s why people want sports cars — and perhaps more important, why they buy them.\n\nThe 2019 Z4 sDrive30i hits dealerships in March, with the M40i to follow at an unspecified later date.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Poor Chris Bangle.\n\nThe design chief for BMW had his hands full when he was charged with the unenviable task of reworking what had worked right for six years.\n\nAnd what wasn’t right about the Z3 sports car? From its garish good looks to its hair-in-the-wind demeanor, young and old alike loved it. James Bond even plugged it.\n\nHow do you improve on a good thing? How do you make the Bond car better?\n\nBangle started over. And the complaining started up.\n\n(Who knew adding a number would be so difficult?)\n\nTo the critics, the 2003 Z4 roadster was “too different,” not “stylish enough,” and hardly representative of BMW’s “sexy corporate styling.”\n\nSexy corporate styling?\n\nIsn’t that like saying “attractive polyester?”\n\nAnd, pardon us, but polyester should never ride in the Z4.\n\nFrom its shark-like front nose to its sweeping lines to its racer’s heart and throat, the all-new Z4 is different. And Mr. Bangle, that’s a good thing. It’s not like the Z3 because, simply, it’s better than the Z3. It’s more fun to drive on the open road. It’s like very few roadsters on the open road – attractive with the top up, stunning with the top down and a breeze to handle under any conditions.\n\nIt’s not perfect – with a sport-tuned suspension that is wound tight, even highway driving can send your spine for a ride. But even 007 had a few flaws.\n\nAvailable only as a roadster (the coupe has been dropped), the newcomer offers much to like. The chassis is more rigid this year, the wheelbase has been lengthened and the shell has been lightened. All that adds up to some impressive driving dynamics.\n\nWant to feel the road and taste the corners? The Z4 will serve it up.\n\nEquipped with a new electrical-assist steering system and a sport package ($1,500) that lowers the car’s height and shortens the suspension pieces, the rear-drive roadster muscles into turns with a controlled chaos. Composed. Confident. Crazy.\n\nAnd, like all true sport rides, it is a driver’s car.\n\nFrom the turn of the key and the snore of the exhaust, the Z has one ambition: Punch the pedal. Then punch it again. And pushing that pedal will get you somewhere in a hurry. Available with either a 2.5-liter six-cylinder engine (our tester) or the larger 3.0-liter version, the Z4 zips up to 60 mph in the blink of an eye (or about seven seconds).\n\nWith less than 3,000 pounds beneath you, swift travel is hardly a concern. The 2.5-liter creates 184 horsepower but, more importantly, produces the kind of torque that will pull you out in front of the pack whether you’re in second gear or fifth. Late for work? The Z4 has the solution. Bored in traffic? The Z4 will take care of you. It’s the cure for the common commute.\n\nWith a spin-control system on board, it will also keep you on the straight and narrow. The Z4 handled wet weather without a problem and slippery co nditions were stable.\n\nRide quality requires an advance warning. In the true quality of a sports roadster, you can feel every bump and every bruise. That means traveling through a construction zone in southeast Michigan left me with a bad case of the jitters long after. Even with supportive seats, it’s a firmness that only means you are riding in something tuned ultra-tight. I liked that; some might not.\n\nOn the inside, there is style in simplicity. BMW has not loaded up the Z4 with a maze of gadgets, gizmos or DVD screens. Again, it’s a driver’s car. That means a small instrument cluster with two key gauges – speedometer and tachometer. The theme continues throughout. With a long, sweeping silver dash reminiscent of the 7-Series BMW, the Z4 keeps it clean. The AM/FM/CD stereo is positioned high, just above the climate control which is just above the five-speed transmission (a six-speed is available on the 3.0-liter). And that’s about it.\n\nThere are plenty of storage pockets along the sides and behind the driver’s elbow in a unique rear bin, but that’s where the fancy stuff ends.\n\nJust drive it.\n\nNow, the styling. Love it or hate it, at least BMW changed it. The designers restyled the old nose of the Z3, ditching the waterfall louvers and sculpting the front end into the sides. It’s a classic look that screams sleek and speedy, from its wide back end to the pointy front. They even incorporated the BMW logo into the side turn signals. It’s classy and it works. The ad campaign talks about it looking like a shark. I’ll bite.\n\nA couple of gripes: The clutch pedal had a long, heavy path to travel and suffered from an unreasonable vibration out of first and second gear. And – a warning – there are a ton of blind spots on this car, especially with the top up.\n\nA good thing: The power top is unbelievably simple, powering its way down in a couple of seconds with the push of a button and stowing behind the seats. No latches. No tugs. No trunk space lost (even if it is already tiny – about two golf bags’ worth).\n\nSafety has been addressed with two steel roll bars, run-flat tires and four air bags, including knee protection.\n\nAnd price? You knew this was coming.\n\nAt $33,100 for the 2.5-liter version, this is a reasonable proposition for a car this daring. Buyer beware: When you start adding on the extras, you will come dangerously close to the starting price of the 3.0-liter ($40,250).\n\nEven in its simplest version, the Z4 is good.\n\nDifferent. Daring. And, definitely, thankfully, no corporate styling.\n\n2003 BMW Z4\n\nRating: 3.5\n\nHigh gear: Superb road manners, stylish interior and exterior, the industry’s easiest soft top and plentiful safety features make the Z4 an A-plus.\n\nLow gear: Price becomes an issue with add-ons, and the number of blind spots make tight spaces tricky. Clutch feel on the tester seemed worn and suffered from unnerving vibration at low speeds.\n\nVehicle type: Rear-wheel drive, front-engine, two-door, two-passenger roadster.\n\nKey standard equipment: Five-speed manual transmission; four-wheel anti-lock brakes with Dynamic Brake Control; Dynamic Stability Control with all-season tracking; speed-sensitive electric power steering; 16-inch alloy wheels with run-flat tires; dual air bags with active knee protection; dual side air bags; coded anti-theft protection; remote entry; climate-control; tilt steering wheel; anti-theft AM/FM stereo CD with 10 speakers; central locking; power windows and mirrors; heated glass rear window.\n\nKey competition: Audi TT, Lexus SC430, Honda S2000, Nissan 350Z\n\nBase engine (2.5): 184 horsepower, 2.5-liter DOHC 24-valve inline 6-cylinder\n\nTorque (2.5): 175 ft.-lbs. @ 3,500 rpm\n\nWheelbase: 98.2 inches\n\nLength: 161.1 inches\n\nM PG rating: 20 city/28 highway\n\nManufactured: Spartanburg, S.C.\n\nWarranty: Basic warranty is four years/50,000 miles; drivetrain is four years/50,000 miles; roadside assistance is four years/50,000 miles; and rust is six years/unlimited miles.\n\nBase price (2.5): $33,100\n\nPrice as tested (including options, destination and delivery): $40,746",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 BMW Z4?\n\nThe BMW Z4 is a two-seat droptop sports car with rear-wheel drive and a choice of two engines: a 255-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder or a 382-hp, turbo 3.0-liter inline-six. Both are paired to an eight-speed automatic transmission with paddle shifters affixed to the steering wheel. A six-speed manual transmission is newly available with the six-cylinder engine for 2025. Fun to drive and surprisingly composed with its top up, the Z4 even boasts a decent-sized trunk, measuring around 9.9 cubic feet in capacity.\n\nIf you like the Z4 but prefer a fixed-roof coupe over a convertible, the Toyota GR Supra is worth considering. The current Z4 and Supra were co-developed by BMW and Toyota, and they share the same platform and powertrains (though the Supra lost its 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine for 2025). Additional rivals include Porsche’s 718 Cayman and Boxster, as well as the Chevrolet Corvette.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 BMW Z4?\n\nAs mentioned above, the six-cylinder Z4 adds an available six-speed manual transmission for 2025, following in the footsteps of its GR Supra counterpart (which gained an optional six-speed for 2023). The Z4’s manual gearbox adds a hefty $3,500 to the bottom line, but that price includes unique springs, a retuned differential and traction control, reinforced anti-roll bar mounts and a few cosmetic upgrades. Z4s with the manual transmission also ride on unique staggered wheels, with 19-inch wheels up front and 20s on the rear.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 BMW Z4 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\nPower-folding top with heated glass rear window\nHeated seats\n12.3-inch digital instrument panel\n10.25-inch touchscreen with navigation\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nTwo USB ports\nDual-zone climate control\nSynthetic leather upholstery\nLED headlights\nRain-sensing wipers\nForward collision warning with city collision mitigation\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nHeated steering wheel\nAdaptive sport suspension\nSix-speed manual transmission\nFront and rear parking sensors\nHead-up instrument display\n12-speaker Harman Kardon stereo\nLeather upholstery\nAdaptive cruise control\nLane departure steering assist\nBlind spot warning\nShould I Buy the 2025 BMW Z4?\n\nThe Z4 delivers a great blend of driving excitement and everyday usability. Sure, some direct competitors will be quicker through corners or around a sinuous racetrack, but this BMW’s classy cabin, spacious-for-a-two-seater trunk and hushed top-up soundtrack make the Z4 so much more than a weekend plaything. The standard turbo-four is peppy, but the optional turbo-six gives the Z4 the speed and performance of a true sports car. The long-awaited addition of a manual transmission for 2025 should make many enthusiast drivers happy.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in August 2009 about the 2009 BMW Z4. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2010, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nNews reports suggest affluent car shoppers are putting off new purchases, keeping their current wheels and treading water as they wait for the economy to pick back up. If you’re in this group, BMW’s redesigned Z4 isn’t your most responsible option, but if times were good you’d snap it up in a heartbeat. It’s an agile, sharp-looking roadster with decent cabin space and surprisingly livable ride quality for day-to-day use. So be an optimist: The new Z4’s timing may be less than ideal, but it’s too good a specimen not to consider.\n\nI tested a Z4 sDrive35i. There’s also a less powerful Z4 sDrive30i; you can compare both to the 2008 Z4 here. This year’s Z4 gets a standard power-retractable hardtop, much like BMW’s 3 Series convertible. That means there’s no fixed-hardtop coupe, as the outgoing Z4 lineup included, nor is there a high-performance Z4 M, also offered previously.\n\nSharp Styling\nThe previous Z4, conceived during the worst of BMW’s avant-garde styling years, always looked a bit off. It was the sort of car you’d park nose-in so others might admire the rear and never see the front. There’s no need to hide anymore. The low-slung Z4 looks well-proportioned and aggressive, with a long hood, a short tail and a cabin planted rear of the car’s center. The grille is larger and more upright, and the headlights have a furrowed, menacing appearance. It’s an angrier look, but I’ll take it over the previous Z4’s headlights, which lent the car a vapid expression.\n\nThe sDrive35i adds titanium-colored inserts in the grille and lower air dam; the sDrive30i retains black inserts throughout. BMW says the power top takes about 20 seconds to raise and lower; I hit that time lowering it, but putting it up took 22 seconds. The whole operation requires the car to be at a complete halt; some powered tops function when the car is in motion, at least up to a certain speed.\n\nTwin-Turbo Fun\nThe Z4 sDrive35i is perhaps the best application yet for BMW’s twin-turbo six-cylinder. Power is abundant, starting out strong — and lacking any noticeable turbo lag — and sticking around all the way to a speeding ticket. Sports cars from the Nissan 370Z to the Porsche Boxster S feel less immediately powerful, peaking only as the tach swings past 3,000 rpm or so. BMW says 60 mph comes in 5.1 seconds for the Z4 sDrive35i. That’s a figure both competitors narrowly beat, but in the everyday sense the Z4’s balance of power all over the tach makes up for the deficit.\n\nOther Bimmers offer the same twin-turbo engine as the Z4 — and accelerate as blazingly fast — but the Z4’s stick is a welcome change from the rubbery, longish shifters BMW installs elsewhere. It feels closer to the manual in the Infiniti G37, which I believe is the gold standard for stick-shift precision. Flick it from one gear to the next, stab the gas for a quick rev-match, then accelerate onward — it’s a delightful thing, and that’s not a compliment I’ve paid a BMW manual in a long time.\n\nA seven-speed dual-clutch automatic with steering-wheel paddle shifters runs $1,525 on the sDrive35i; the sDrive30i offers a traditional six-speed automatic. The Z4’s dual-clutch transmission debuted in the M3 a couple years back, and it was BMW’s first such transmission. Thanks to lickety-split shift times, the dual-clutch automatic gets the Z4 to 60 mph a hair faster than the stick shift. (This is the norm for dual-clutch automatics, a reality that I, a stick-shift purist, have only grudgingly accepted.)\n\nAll-disc antilock brakes bring the Z4 to a quick halt, though I noticed that the first few inches of pedal travel exact minimal braking. Other editors found that helped fine-tune deceleration, but I prefer the Boxster’s brake pedal, which felt more linear.\n\nIf the 300-horsepower sDrive35i’s $51,650 asking price is too steep, the normally aspirated, 255-hp sDrive30i starts at $45,750. It hits 60 mph in 5.6 seconds with the manual and 6.0 seconds with the automatic — likely a noticeable enough difference from the twin-turbo engine for you to feel in everyday driving, especially when comparing the automatics. Here’s how the drivetrains compare:\n\nDrivetrains Compared\n \tZ4 sDrive30i\tZ4 sDrive35i\nBase price\t$45,750\t$51,650\nEngine\t3.0-liter inline-six\t3.0-liter, twin-turbocharged inline-six\nHorsepower (@ rpm)\t255 @ 6,600\t300 @ 5,800\nTorque (lbs.-ft. @ rpm)\t220 @ 2,600\t300 @ 1,400\nTransmissions\tSix-speed manual; six-speed automatic\tSix-speed manual; seven-speed dual-clutch automatic\nZero to 60 mph, sec.\t5.6 (manual); 6.0 (auto)\t5.1 (manual); 5.0 (auto)\nEPA mileage (city/hwy., mpg)\t19/28 (manual); 19/29 (auto)\t18/25 (manual); 17/24 (auto)\nRequired fuel\tPremium\tPremium\nSource: Automaker and EPA data\n\nDynamic Drive Control\nBMW’s Dynamic Drive Control, which affects the steering feel, accelerator sensitivity and stability system thresholds, is standard. My test car came with a $2,300 Sport Package with an adaptive suspension, whose settings DDC also governs. DDC can be moved through Normal, Sport and Sport Plus modes via a rocker switch next to the gearshift — an eminently useful setup, I might add, because you don’t have to futz with an onboard computer or set independent driving and suspension settings, as some other cars with selectable driving settings require.\n\nRide & Handling\nIn DDC’s Normal mode, the Z4 is surprisingly docile: The steering wheel turns with an unexpectedly light touch, and the suspension soaks up bumps nicely. In comparison, the Boxster’s steering takes on a heavier feel, and ride quality is far less forgiving. Mercedes’ SLK350 has an even cushier ride but suffers from numb, dispirited steering. In the BMW, it isn’t quite as easy to rotate the car on its axis and slide the tail sideways as it is in the Boxster, but if you’re not a racetrack enthusiast I suspect the ride-quality payoff will be worth the loss.\n\nSwitch DDC to Sport, and the Z4’s steering wheel feels heftier; it requires more muscle to crank at low speeds but delivers sharper precision and a planted, more secure highway feel. In fast corners, it’s easier to sense the rear coming out and to ease off the gas or counter-steer as needed. Normal mode, by comparison, has a bit too much steering slop to manage clean drifts.\n\nThe adaptive suspension gets firmer in Sport, though not intolerably so. Of greater import is body roll: In Normal mode, quick lane changes unleash plenty of body roll. In Sport, the car stays much flatter.\n\nSport Plus mode eases back the Z4’s standard electronic stability system so you can spin the tires and let the tail break free a bit more. In Normal or Sport, the stability system allowed enough wheelspin for me, and I didn’t notice any other great difference from the other settings — steering assist, suspension firmness — in Sport Plus. It’s certainly not as obvious as the transition from Normal to Sport, anyway. Sport Plus might come in handy on the racetrack; on the street, it serves less purpose.\n\nPower the top up, and wind noise is impressively quiet — one of the benefits of a hard- rather than soft-top convertible.\n\nThe Inside\nIf the previous Z4 had a major shortcoming beyond its controversial styling, it was cramped space. The new Z4 is appreciably roomier — the seats don’t constrict your sides, and there’s a fair amount of legroom when you move them back. I’m 5-foot-11, and even when I got the seat into an ideal position to work the clutch it was still a few inches forward of its rearmost position. With the automatic, you can probably sit farther back, and there’s room to spare for that.\n\nCabin quality in my test car was generally good, with optional leather-stitched dash panels and genuine aluminum inlays. Storage areas are larger than they were last year, with a large enough glove compartment to stow a removable cupholder that attaches to the side of the center console. Your passenger will bemoan the loss of knee room, but this cupholder is far superior to the previous flip-out dashboard one. Tell him the alternative would be to have coffee in his lap when that flimsy device failed.\n\nI’m not sold on the assortment of climate controls — their appearance doesn’t really match the rest of the cabin’s styling — nor do I like the Z4’s dash-top bin, whose tinny cover smacks of cost-cutting. Opt for the navigation system, and its screen goes there instead. You’ll also get BMW’s knob-based iDrive system, whose latest generation is so vast an improvement over the original that it probably deserves a different name.\n\nCargo volume measures a useful 10.9 cubic feet with the top up; put the top down and it drops to 6.4 cubic feet. The Boxster, SLK and Audi TT have comparable space with the top up, but all three have less-obstructed confines with the top down; the Boxster’s and TT’s cargo areas are unaffected by their tops’ location.\n\nSafety, Features & Pricing\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has yet to test the Z4; IIHS doesn’t crash-test many roadsters — and no prior Z4 has been tested — so I wouldn’t hold my breath. Standard safety features include antilock brakes, an electronic stability system, conventional front and knee airbags, and side-impact airbags that extend high enough for head protection, according to BMW. Click here to see the full list of safety gear.\n\nThe Z4 sDrive30i, which starts at $45,750, includes the standard power-retracting hardtop, 17-inch alloy wheels, xenon headlights, vinyl upholstery and a CD stereo with an MP3 jack. Leather upholstery and dual-zone automatic climate control are among the options. Both are standard on the Z4 sDrive35i ($51,650); further options on both models include power seats, a premium stereo with an iPod/USB port, heated seats, a heated steering wheel and a navigation system. The six-speed automatic runs $1,325 on the sDrive30i; the seven-speed dual-clutch automatic is $1,525 on the sDrive35i.\n\nLoad up a Z4 sDrive35i, and the price approaches $70,000.\n\nZ4 in the Market\nBMW is a brand that emphasizes performance, often above all else, and the previous Z4 took that too far. Fast but flawed, it had too many compromises for broad appeal. Luxury roadsters, on the whole, will have limited success until the economy gains some steam, but the new Z4 gets a lot of things right. When luxury-car shoppers go back to buying weekend toys, BMW has something that ought to do the trick. And it might just suffice for weekdays, too.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "Oh, you know I said, “Yes!” when our Chief Mama Kristin Varela asked me if I’d like to drive the 2009 BMW Z4 for a stint (one of the days was my birthday). All of my friends and neighbors were extremely jealous, and I loved every minute of driving this indulgent little creature from BMW.\n\nThis wasn’t my first time in the two-seater Z4. I test drove the 2007 Z4, but it wasn’t a convertible and I had a lot of problems with it. I had to duck just right to get in the door, which was tricky with its ultra-bolstered seats. Once inside, the ’07 felt dark and reclusive, but the Z4 has been redesigned for 2009. There’s more room now, and the convertible version remedied almost all my gripes. The grin on my face from driving the Z4 erased any other petty complaints I’d otherwise make.\n\nLet’s be clear, the Z4 isn’t a family car. However, if you’ve already got a trusted family-hauler or two in the garage, it’ll work well as a fun-to-drive car that’s mostly for grownups. If your family consists of you and a child, you could make a case for trying to make the Z4 into a family-hauler, but it’s a tough sell since there’s not a lot of trunk space for that grocery store run with the kid in the passenger seat. Keep in mind that there isn’t a tiny backseat in this car for storing all of those bags.\n\nYou know the Z4 is sexy-looking, but you didn’t know it’s sexy under the hood, too. My test car had a twin-turbo inline-six-cylinder engine that got me everywhere in a big hurry. For the first time in who knows how long (ever), some dude tried to pick me up at a stoplight. I just laughed and left him in the dust.\n\nThe Z4 took off from stoplights like a banshee; it was awesome. I went into this test driving fully expecting to get a speeding ticket, and I was more than willing to make that sacrifice for this powerful car. The Z4 takes premium gas – no big surprise there – and gets an EPA-estimated 18/25 mpg city/highway.\n\nThe Z4 has a Dynamic Drive Control that allows the driver to adjust the car’s steering and accelerator settings to for their preferences. It can be adjusted to normal, Sport or Sport+. The Z4’s suspension was stiff – not unbearably so – but more people want that in this kind of car.\n\nIf looks are everything to you and performance, well, not so much, then you can go for a Z4 without the bigger engine and turbocharged deliciousness. It eases up on the hit on your wallet and starts at just over $45,000. My test car started at $51,650 and rapidly accelerated to $63,470 with some pretty hefty options.\n\nExterior\n\nThanks to the Z4’s redesign, this convertible is bigger both inside and out. It’s gorgeous-looking, and the retractable hardtop makes it hard to tell it’s a convertible.\n\nWhat’s even better is the hardtop seals so well that there’s no potential for rattling, buffeting or ill-fitting window closures – unlike a canvas droptop. The Z4 can quickly transform from a cool coupe to a sexy roadster. The bonus is that it does it with the push of a button in 20 seconds, according to BMW. There’s no getting out of the car to fold stuff up here.\n\nSpeaking of sleek, the Z4 also received an update in the looks department for 2009. The headlights and front grille look angled and sharklike. It has more curves, and it’s definitely more aggressive-looking than past Z4s and some of its competitors. I do like a more assertive-looking vehicle, so color me satisfied.\n\nWhen the top was down, I loved the contrast between the Z4’s red leather interior and its Alpine White paint color. It was super sporty-looking. It even looks good with the top up, but the visibility isn’t great. I found myself double- and triple-checking the blind spots before making any moves.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Not Really\n\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Groove-On\n\nInterior\n\nDuring my test drive, a guy made the mistake of calling the Z4 a “chick car.” “If you’d sat in the car, you’d know there’s nothing ‘chick car’ about it,” I told him. “There’s no spot for my purse, no spot for my lip balm, and I can maybe fit a wallet in that glove box. Pssh.” He tried to tell me that the red-colored leather interior pushed it into chick-car territory. Wrong.\n\nThe interior is Coral Red; it’s eye-catching but not feminine-looking. Available sun-reflective leather seats reflect infrared radiation to help keep them cooler in the sun. Wow.\n\nThe beautiful, comfortable interior almost made me forget there was no place for my purse, lip balm and nearly a passenger. But I kind of liked it that way. My test drive of this car fell during the second week of school, and I can tell you that there’s no better treat after a long summer break than to be in a car by yourself, where only one other person – who should be an adult – can fit.\n\nThe Z4’s center console is tiny but useful. There’s a tray that can hold narrow items like phones or MP3 players, my boss’ lip gloss (she left it in there, I didn’t steal it), and maybe a pen and small pad of Post-Its.\n\nThe dash is simple-looking with a screen that pops up for the iDrive system, a multimedia system that controls everything from the sound system to the navigation system. The current iDrive system is an improvement over older versions. It makes a lot more sense and is quite iPod-friendly. While I find all of these systems to be irksome, BMW’s has always been the trickiest, and I’m glad to see some improvements have been made. There are actually some easy-to-use buttons with labels on them, and the menus are much more simple and obvious than in previous years. Thank you, BMW.\n\nWhat would a MotherProof.com review be without mention of the cupholders? The Z4 has one that’s housed in the center stack by the passenger’s left leg. It’s removable, but it’s sturdier that the in-dash version of earlier models (if slightly less nifty). There are a couple smaller, less-usable cupholders inside the center console, next to my boss’s lip gloss, but it seems they’d only hold a drink when you’re parked because they’re pretty shallow.\n\nAs I mentioned, there was no place for my purse in the Z4’s cabin, but there’s room for it – and not much else – in the trunk. Fortunately, there’s a pass-through in the back of the cabin that allows access to the cargo area. Huzzah!\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Puny\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Puny\n\nSafety\n\nAre you wondering how I’m going to give this review a mom’s perspective (glorious, childless, top-down outings not enough, eh)? Well, the Z4 has a set of Latch connectors as well as a passenger airbag sensor that turns off the airbag if someone who weighs less than 80 pounds sits in the passenger seat. You heard it here, people.\n\nThe Z4’s seats are bolstered, but I was able to install a booster seat without any problems. Full disclosure: Our booster seats are contoured, which works better than standard booster seats in sporty cars with bolstered seats. Yes, I took the kids – one at a time – for a spin in the Z4, and my youngest daughter loved it. She especially loved wearing her sparkly sunglasses while riding in it. Both of my kids were able to open and close the passenger door without any problems, but smaller kids wouldn’t be able to handle the long, heavy doors as well. My children were able to buckle up by themselves, too.\n\nThere’s plenty of safety features to help ease any anxiety about kids riding in the front seat of a convertible, including front and rear anti-roll stabilizer bars and a rollover protection system. However, I’d think twice before putting an infant or toddler in this car. I just can’t get past my own mental hurdle about kids riding in the front seat. I know people do it, and for some it’s a necessity, but I’m a little paranoid about the whole thing. If you have a family car with a backseat, that’s where the kids should be riding.\n\nThe Z4 has antilock brakes, stability control – with a brake-drying function for wet weather, traction control and front- and side-impact airbags as well as a driver’s knee airbag.\n\nThe Z4 hasn’t been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, just so you know.\n\nFAMILY LIFESTAGE\n\nIn Diapers: The Z4 has Latch connectors, but I just don’t feel good about recommending this car for little ones. They need to be in the backseat of a car with at least two rows.\n\nIn School: A booster seat will fit in the passenger seat, but I’d only do that in a pinch.\n\nTeens: There’s no way I’d let a teen drive this, but they can ride in it.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Bury the past. The new Z4 ups the fun quotient and delivers performance to match its looks.\n\nVersus the competition: The most direct competitor to the Z4 is the related Toyota Supra; the BMW offers similar performance, but with a more luxurious interior and superior technology — and a price tag to match.\n\nRelated: 2019 BMW Z4: Everything You Need to Know\n\nAfter a two-year hiatus, the BMW Z4 makes an unanticipated, but not unwelcome, return. For a while it looked like the Z4 was dead and buried; the hardtop convertible was last sold as a 2016 model, and its demise didn’t inspire much grief. The old model was fine but didn’t drive well enough to be memorable, and it had some awkward styling.\n\nFast forward to 2019, when the Z4 reappeared thanks to a collaboration between BMW and Toyota that resulted in a sports car for each company. Toyota reincarnated the Supra and BMW brought back the Z4 roadster — this time with a soft top, perfect weight balance and a promise of greater sportiness.\n\nSecond Chances\n\nThere are two Z4 trim levels, with the biggest difference under the hood: The sDrive 30i features a turbocharged, 2.0-liter four-cylinder, while the sDrive M40i comes with a turbocharged, 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder. The sDrive M40i also comes with a few performance upgrades that are optional on the sDrive 30i — and one in particular, the Track Handling Package, makes a big difference.\n\nMy first taste of the new Z4 came driving a 2019 Z3 30i around Palm Springs, Calif., for half a day, sans the Track Handling Package. It was a big improvement over the outgoing Z4, but I found it lacking some spark. It was fine for 90 percent of the time, but that last 10 percent — where you really want to push and enjoy a car — is the reason you buy a sports car. That Z4 was a good car to drive on a sunny day, but not one you’d go out of your way to find a road on which to stretch it.\n\nSince then I’ve spent a week apiece with a 2019 30i and a 2020 M40i, both equipped with the Track Handling Package, and my mind has changed. (According to BMW, content and pricing from 2019 to 2020 are unchanged for the Z4 30i.)\n\nCheck the Box\n\nThe Track Handling Package is $2,450 on the 30i and standard on the M40i. It includes M Sport brakes, an adaptive suspension and an M Sport differential — and, as stated, it makes a difference. The first 30i I tested had just the adaptive suspension, and it got vague as I pushed it harder. The steering and suspension didn’t feel taut enough to offer the kind of feedback I wanted.\n\nWith the Track Handling Package, the car feels much sharper — not through any added firmness from the shocks (that I could detect), but from the differential upgrade. That upgrade allows the rear axle to put down power more crisply on corner exits as it shuffles torque to the right places, and it gives the car a more playful nature that’s very welcome.\n\nI still want a hair more feedback from the steering wheel, which gets a touch light at the limit, but the ability to throttle through turns with more confidence helps make up for it. The larger brakes are also welcome; the car slows down with the same immediacy with which it accelerates.\n\nThese upgrades are standard on M40i models, and the car exhibits much the same behavior as the 30i — just with a lot more power.\n\n2019 BMW Z4 sDrive 30i | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\nPOWERtrains\n\nBoth the 30i and 40i shine in this department. Their engines are mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission and rear-wheel drive, but there’s a big difference in power output. The 30i’s four-cylinder makes 255 horsepower and 295 pounds-feet of torque — an especially eye-catching figure. This is a familiar powertrain, and it’s good in … well, pretty much every BMW vehicle, but it’s especially good here. The engine’s wide powerband and the responsiveness of the transmission when called upon with haste are real highlights of the 30i.\n\nThe M40i, however, is on a different level, simply because of its power difference: 382 hp and 369 pounds-feet of torque. It changes the nature of the car from something light and agile into something more sinister, with a popping soundtrack to match. Any throttle liftoff with the settings dialed up to Sport or Sport Plus is met with a delightful crackle from the exhaust. With the top down for full effect, it’s addicting.\n\nBMW says the M40i will go from 0-60 mph in just 3.9 seconds, but it feels quicker from the seat. It bursts off the line and charges forward, snapping off shifts and leaving a cloud of dust and noise behind it. This powertrain is familiar, as well; we recently tested it in the BMW M340i, which charged from 0-60 mph in 3.89 seconds. That number will be lower in the lighter Z4, and I wholeheartedly agree with the widespread assessment that BMW has underrated this engine’s power. (Same thing goes for the Supra.)\n\nThough there’s a big difference in performance, there isn’t in fuel economy: EPA ratings are 24/32/27 mpg city/highway/combined for the 30i, 24/31/26 mpg for the M40i.\n\nCozy Interior\n\nThe Z4 is a two-seat roadster, so space will never be superfluous. I did appreciate, though, that even though the cockpit is small, there’s a decent amount of seat travel; I had no trouble finding an ideal driving position. That’s less common than you’d think in low-slung sports cars like this. I’m a fan of bright interiors, so the Vernasca Magma Red leather upholstery in the M40i felt tailor-made for my tastes — it comes as a part of the Executive Package, otherwise it costs $1,700 by itself.\n\nA pair of 10.25-inch screens come standard, one serving as the instrument panel and the other as a central touchscreen that can also be controlled via a rotary controller on the console between the seats. The screen in front of the driver has mostly fixed information and limited customization options, and I’m not sure it adds much — unlike Audi’s great Virtual Cockpit system. The other screen, however, is more promising; it’s canted toward the driver to make it easier to see and reach, and BMW’s multimedia systems have come a long way in both usability and functionality. There are a lot of menus to get through, so it does come with a bit of a learning curve, but I was very comfortable with it by the end of a week (let alone two).\n\nWireless Apple CarPlay comes standard, and though BMW once planned to charge owners a yearly subscription fee to use CarPlay after the first year, the company has since walked that back. Owners of 2019 and 2020 BMWs will now get it free; the change will happen seamlessly — whether owners signed up for a subscription beyond the first year or not. Android Auto users, however, are still out of luck, as that isn’t offered on any BMW products (including Mini).\n\nPricing and Value\n\nThe Z4 doesn’t offer much value. It doesn’t have much in the way of standard safety equipment, other than forward automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection. Adaptive cruise control, lane change assist and a Back-Up Assistant are available.\n\nThe 30i starts at $50,695, while the M40i starts at $64,695 (prices include destination charges). The M40i includes the contents of both the Track Handling and M Sport packages standard, in addition to the larger engine. With options, my test vehicles both stickered much higher: $63,545 for the 30i and $73,295 for the M40i.\n\nThe new roadster is a triumphant return for the Z4; it looks and drives better — two things you really need from a roadster. Though I didn’t miss it much while it was gone, I’m glad it’s back.\n\nWhat About the Toyota?\n\nA common question I get is how the Z4 compares to the Toyota Supra, which I also had the privilege of reviewing (tough life, I know). There are a lot of similarities, which is to be expected; the M40i and Supra have the same platform, the same engine and the same transmission. Though each company handled tuning elements by themselves, there’s a lot of overlap, and in this case that’s a positive: That engine is fantastic, and both cars feel underrated in terms of power and how quickly they accelerate.\n\nThere is some daylight between the two when it comes to handling. Adding a roof to the car makes the Supra stiffer, and it’s a bit more playful as a result. It’s easier to hang the tail out, and the steering is more dialed in. The Z4 is no slouch in this department, though; it’s just a hair behind the Toyota.\n\nThe Z4 makes up ground inside: better screens, better materials and better ergonomics. The Supra’s roof dips very low up front — so low that taller drivers won’t be able to see well out the front of the car (let alone the back). A BMW system powers the Supra’s multimedia, as well, but content has been pulled out of it; there are menu items that don’t lead anywhere.\n\nI’d give the Supra a slight edge in terms of performance, but the Z4 a gigantic edge in terms of amenities and creature comforts — though it’s an edge you’ll pay for: The Supra starts at $50,945, nearly $14,000 less than the M40i.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2022 BMW Z4?\n\nThe BMW Z4 is a two-seat soft-top sports car that comes with rear-wheel drive and a choice of two engines: a 255-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder or 382-hp, turbo 3.0-liter inline-six. Both engines work with an eight-speed automatic transmission. \n\nThe current Z4 debuted as a 2019 model and is the result of a collaboration between BMW and Toyota; for its part, the Japanese automaker launched a new version of its famed Supra. Z4 competitors include the Audi TT and Porsche 718 Boxster. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2022 BMW Z4?\n\nThere are no significant changes this year. \n\nWhat Features in the 2022 BMW Z4 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\n18-inch wheels\nBlack soft top with heated glass rear window\nDigital instrument panel\n10.25-inch touchscreen multimedia system with navigation\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nForward collision warning with city collision mitigation\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nHeated seats\nHeated steering wheel\nAdaptive suspension\nHead-up display\nHarman Kardon stereo\nAdaptive cruise control\nLane departure warning\nBlind spot warning\nShould I Buy the 2022 BMW Z4?\n\nThe Z4 is a balanced sports car, and the M40i version offers strong acceleration and a rousing exhaust note. The steering could use more feedback, however, and some purists will bemoan the lack of a manual transmission.",

      "expert_review": "Two-seater sports cars come in an amazingly broad array of shape, size, price and performance.\n\nThe variety is amazing because such vehicles represent an extravagance, an expression of carefree indulgence where practicality takes a back seat to pure fun, if there was a back seat to take.\n\nBMW Z3 arrived on the scene in 1995, a few years after Mazda revived the genre with its retro Miata. Soon, there was competition from the likes of Porsche Boxster, Audi TT, Honda S2000 and Mercedes-Benz SLK, each offering a different twist on the sports car formula.\n\nZ3, with its classic proportions and sporting heritage, stayed a popular favorite throughout its seven years, improving steadily in performance. The Z4 put into production last year was a giant step forward for BMW’s little roadster with edgier styling, improved drivability and roomier interior.\n\nMy favorite is the roomier interior. Among small convertibles, Z4 has the most accommodating cockpit for my lanky 6-foot, 6-inch frame, particularly in legroom. Thank you, BMW. Everyone else, pay attention.\n\nThe exterior styling at first seemed oddly contrived, all strange angles and creases. It has grown on me, now looking sharply progressive and purposeful while retaining the long hood and short deck of a true roadster.\n\nZ4 comes in two flavors, with either a 2.5-liter or 3-liter inline six. The 2004 Z4 tested here had the lesser engine, which still provides enough punch at a lower cost.\n\nHowever, the test car came loaded with about $10,000 in features, which blunts the price advantage. So it goes.\n\nWhat it is\n\nBMW’s midprice roadster receives a major upgrade in size, style and accommodations, yet stays true to the roadster form.\n\nPerformance\n\nThough the 2.5-liter six might disappoint acceleration addicts, it’s still strong and healthy.\n\nGenerating 184 horsepower, the free-revving straight six delivers enough power for a proper sports car. The aluminum six feels strongest coming off the line and through the lower gears, losing potency at higher speeds.\n\nThe higher-performance version of Z4 comes with the excellent 3-liter, 225-horsepower engine also found in other BMW cars and SUVs. I sampled this engine in the Z3 and came away impressed by its hard-charging torque and flexibility.\n\nThe 3-liter Z4 costs more than $7,000 over the 2.5-liter version, but has some other performance and feature upgrades. The 3-liter also comes with a six-speed stick shift instead of the 2.5-liter’s five speed.\n\nWorth the extra money? That depends what you want out of the Z4 and what you want to spend.\n\nThere are two other transmissions available: an automatic with a manual-shift mode and a Sequential Manual Gearbox that provides race-car-style paddle shifting.\n\nDrivability\n\nZ4 has an all-new chassis and suspension that provides exemplary handling and a stiff body s tructure without a hint of shake or shudder.\n\nCornering and back-road agility are enjoyably crisp, the front-engine/rear-drive layout helping to provide good balance. The new electronic steering, which does away with the traditional hydraulic power steering, feels highly responsive and nicely weighted.\n\nThe throttle is also electronic, eliminating solid linkage or cable actuation. This provides better response and precision.\n\nThe electronic controls also allows BMW to add Dynamic Driving Control to its optional Sport Package. Via a button on the console, drivers can enhance steering effort and accelerator response. That package also adds a firmer sport suspension and 17-inch alloy wheels.\n\nStyling\n\nEdgy and curvaceous at the same time, Z4 eclipses the rounder shape of the Z3. The style looks great from front and side, though is less appealing from the rear.\n\nThe convertible top has a heated glass window and comes down manually or powered. The test car had the power top, which worked quickly and stowed under a cleverly designed integral cover.\n\nInterior\n\nRoomy and comfortable, Z4 is well-equipped with standard features. An optional Premium Package included leather upholstery and brush aluminum trim that were attractive and appropriately sporty.\n\nPricing\n\nAlthough the Z4 2.5i started at $33,100, a full load of luxury and performance features shot the price up to $43,595. The base 3.0i starts at $41,045, which includes a high level of equipment, and would soon pass the $50,000 mark if loaded up like the test car.\n\nOptions on the test car included the Premium Package, $2,900, with power top, power seats, leather, aluminum trim and cruise control; navigation system, $1,800; Sport Package, $1,500, with Dynamic Driving Control, 17-inch alloys, sport suspension, fog lamps and cold-weather extras; Convenience Package, $1,050, with rain-sensing wipers, automatic headlight aiming, climate control and computer.\n\nAlso, premium audio, $875; bi-xenon headlights, $700; heated seats, $500; Toledo blue paint, $475; and shipping, $695.\n\nThose are some expensive options, and I’d cut out a bunch of them. The Sport Package seems most worth the money.\n\nBottom line\n\nA sports car that’s now up to the standards of BMW’s highly regarded line of cars and SUVs, the Z4 now competes head-on with the best of them.\n\nBMW Z4 2.5i\n\nVehicle type: Two-passenger, two-door sports car, rear-wheel drive.\n\nBase price: $33,100.\n\nPrice as tested: $43,595.\n\nEngine: 2.5-liter inline six, 184 horsepower at 6,000 rpm, 175 pound-feet of torque at 3,500 rpm.\n\nTransmission: Five-speed stick shift.\n\nWheelbase: 98.2 inches.\n\nCurb weight: 2,932 pounds.\n\nEPA mileage: 20 city, 28 highway.\n\nHighs:\n\nHandling, performance.\n\nRoomy interior.\n\nEdgy styling.\n\nLows:\n\nExpensive options.\n\nRear styling.\n\nNot a 3.0i.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 BMW Z4?\n\nThe BMW Z4 is a two-passenger drop-top sports car with rear-wheel drive and a choice of two engines: a 255-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder or a 382-hp, turbo 3.0-liter inline-six. Both are paired to an eight-speed automatic transmission with paddle shifters affixed to the steering wheel. Fun to drive and surprisingly composed with its top raised, the Z4 even boasts a decent-sized trunk, measuring around 9.9 cubic feet in capacity.\n\nIf you want something edgier — and the option of a manual transmission — the Toyota Supra is worth considering. The current Z4 and Supra were codeveloped by BMW and Toyota, and they share the same platform and powertrains. Additional rivals include Porsche’s 718 Cayman and Boxster and the Chevrolet Corvette.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 BMW Z4?\n\nFollowing a minor refresh for 2023, the Z4 is unchanged this year. Despite speculation that it might gain a manual transmission, like the Supra now offers, the Z4 remains automatic-only.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 BMW Z4 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nPower-folding top with heated glass rear window\n10.25-inch digital instrument panel\n10.25-inch touchscreen with navigation\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nTwo USB ports\nDual-zone climate control\nLED headlights\nRain-sensing wipers\nForward collision warning with city collision mitigation\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nHeated seats\nHeated steering wheel\nAdaptive suspension\nFront and rear parking sensors\nHead-up instrument display\n12-speaker Harman Kardon stereo\nAdaptive cruise control\nLane departure warning\nBlind spot warning\nShould I Buy the 2024 BMW Z4?\n\nThe Z4 delivers a great blend of driving excitement and everyday usability. Sure, some direct competitors will be quicker through corners or around a sinuous racetrack, but this BMW’s classy cabin, spacious-for-a-two-seater trunk and hushed top-up soundtrack make the Z4 so much more than a weekend plaything. The standard turbo-four is peppy, but the optional turbo-six gives the Z4 the speed and performance of a true sports car.",

      "expert_review": "BMW’s Z4 has not created much of a stir since its arrival two years ago. Built in South Carolina, the two-seat roadster has polarized prospective buyers with a much more radical exterior design than its predecessor, the Z3, and sales have suffered.\n\nWith a mid-cycle makeover and a hardtop companion on the horizon, we thought the car merited a second look while there was still enough mild weather to take the top down.\n\nWe tested a lavishly equipped 2005 Z4 3.0i, with more than $5,000 worth of options. The bottom line: $47,245.\n\nHE: I don’t know how much more fun I can take — a Pontiac Solstice one week, a BMW Z4 the next. Automotive fantasies don’t get much better than this.\n\nSHE: I don’t think it’s a coincidence that your fantasy BMW roadster came equipped with a “dream red/black leather” interior. Because basically I think you’re dreaming if you think I’m gonna give my seal of approval to this bit of excess. Look at it this way. We could get his-and-hers Solstices or even his-and-her Mazda Miatas for the price of this Z4, and have enough money left over for a trip to the Bahamas. How can you justify spending this much cash on a seasonal vehicle in Michigan?\n\nHE: Honey, just drop the top on the Z4 and you can easily picture yourself in the Bahamas, with all that 90-degree weather we’ve had this summer. And I wouldn’t worry so much about Michigan winters — not with features like standard stability control and antilock brakes, plus an insulated canvas top with a glass rear window. As much as I like the Solstice, the Z4 goes one better — it looks sensational inside and out. I love the matte brushed-metal surfaces inside, and the shape, with all those sculpted curves, is enough to make any man drool.\n\nSHE: I have to admit BMW did a great job with the Z4 powertrain. The twin-cam 3.0-liter straight six makes 225 horsepower and feels really quick. BMW also shortened the throws on the six-speed gearbox, which makes it even easier to shift. Despite the terrific performance, you don’t pay a penalty for fuel economy. But the pennies you save on gas are more than offset by the ridiculously steep option prices. Why do heated seats, for instance, cost an extra $500?\n\nHE: Set the issue of price aside for a minute, and let’s talk a little more about performance. You’re right, the engine and transmission are just about perfect. But the whole car is so beautifully balanced, from the speed-sensitive steering to the multi-link rear suspension. It’s a road-hugger that you just want to drive, and drive hard, for hours on end. The fact that it looks so sweet, with such an alluring cockpit, is a bonus, as far as I’m concerned. Very few two-seaters in this price class — the Chevrolet Corvette might be the exception — offer the full package like this BMW does.\n\nSHE: As far as convertibles go, the Z4 is fine and very livable. The optional power top is extremely easy to operate, and there is a surprising amount of room in the trunk. And you can see the Germans tried hard to cram as many amenities as they could into the cabin, including little touches like a glove box behind the seats that has a penholder and an elastic strap for a parking card. The standard safety hardware is also pretty impressive, not to mention high-tech. In addition to side air bags and rollover protection, the Z4 comes with run-flat tires, rain-sensing wipers and adaptive brake lights.\n\nHE: For a change, I don’t have much to grouse about. My biggest beef is with the fancy extra-cost M sport bucket seats, which just didn’t fit my big butt. I still crave a Corvette in my driveway — but I surely wouldn’t mind if a BMW Z4 suddenly dropped out of the heavens one day and landed in my garage. With Paris Hilton in the passenger seat, of course.\n\nSHE: Oh, poor Paris.\n\n– – –\n\nHe drove, she drove Anita and Paul Lienert are partners in Lienert & Lienert, an Ann Arbor automotive information services company.\n\n– – –\n\n2005 BMW Z4 3.0i\n\nType: Front-engine, rear-wheel drive, two-passenger convertible.\n\nPrice: Base, $41,995 (inc. $695 destination charge); as tested, $47,245.\n\nEngine: 3.0-liter I-6; 225-hp; 214 lb-ft torque.\n\nEPA fuel economy: 21 mpg city/29 mpg highway.\n\nWhere built: Greer, S.C.\n\nKey competitors: Audi TT, Chevrolet Corvette, Chrysler Crossfire, Ford Thunderbird, Honda S2000, Lotus Elise, Mercedes-Benz SLK-Class, Nissan 350Z, Porsche Boxster.\n\n12-month insurance cost, estimated by AAA Michigan: $1,687. (Rates may be higher or lower, depending on coverage and driving record.)\n– – –\nAnita’s rating: 4\n\nLikes: Good safety equipment, including standard ABS, stability control, side air bags, adaptive brake lights, rain-sensing wipers, run-flat tires, active knee and rollover protection. Surprisingly roomy trunk. Optional power top is easy to operate with push of one button on IP. Small glove box behind seats with penholder, elastic strap for parking card.\n\nDislikes: Needs adjustable pedals. Cabin and seats felt cramped. Too expensive. Heated seats cost an extra $500.\n\nPaul’s rating: 5\n\nLikes: Strong inline six-cylinder engine provides quick acceleration. Lovely 6-speed gearbox with razor-sharp shifts. Distinctive and voluptuous exterior. Brushed matte-metal interior trim. Sensational handling. Good fuel economy for a sports car. Gorgeous alloy wheels.\n\nDislikes: Optional M seats too tight in the butt. Not much storage space in cabin. Dumb cup holders.\n\nVehicle ratings: 1. Unacceptable, 2. Subpar, 3. Acceptable, 4. Above Average, 5. World Class",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Bury the past. The new Z4 ups the fun quotient and delivers performance to match its looks.\nVersus the competition: The most direct competitor to the Z4 is the related Toyota Supra; the BMW offers similar performance, but with a more luxurious interior and superior technology — and a price tag to match.\nRelated: 2019 BMW Z4: Everything You Need to Know\n\n  \n    \n  \n    After a two-year hiatus, the BMW Z4 makes an unanticipated, but not unwelcome, return. For a while it looked like the Z4 was dead and buried; the hardtop convertible was last sold as a 2016 model, and its demise didn’t inspire much grief. The old model was fine but didn’t drive well enough to be memorable, and it had some awkward styling.\nFast forward to 2019, when the Z4 reappeared thanks to a collaboration between BMW and Toyota that resulted in a sports car for each company. Toyota reincarnated the Supra and BMW brought back the Z4 roadster — this time with a soft top, perfect weight balance and a promise of greater sportiness.\n\n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    Second Chances\nThere are two Z4 trim levels, with the biggest difference under the hood: The sDrive 30i features a turbocharged, 2.0-liter four-cylinder, while the sDrive M40i comes with a turbocharged, 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder. The sDrive M40i also comes with a few performance upgrades that are optional on the sDrive 30i — and one in particular, the Track Handling Package, makes a big difference.\nMy first taste of the new Z4 came driving a 2019 Z3 30i around Palm Springs, Calif., for half a day, sans the Track Handling Package. It was a big improvement over the outgoing Z4, but I found it lacking some spark. It was fine for 90 percent of the time, but that last 10 percent — where you really want to push and enjoy a car — is the reason you buy a sports car. That Z4 was a good car to drive on a sunny day, but not one you’d go out of your way to find a road on which to stretch it.\nSince then I’ve spent a week apiece with a 2019 30i and a 2020 M40i, both equipped with the Track Handling Package, and my mind has changed. (According to BMW, content and pricing from 2019 to 2020 are unchanged for the Z4 30i.)\n\n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    Check the Box\nThe Track Handling Package is $2,450 on the 30i and standard on the M40i. It includes M Sport brakes, an adaptive suspension and an M Sport differential — and, as stated, it makes a difference. The first 30i I tested had just the adaptive suspension, and it got vague as I pushed it harder. The steering and suspension didn’t feel taut enough to offer the kind of feedback I wanted.\nWith the Track Handling Package, the car feels much sharper — not through any added firmness from the shocks (that I could detect), but from the differential upgrade. That upgrade allows the rear axle to put down power more crisply on corner exits as it shuffles torque to the right places, and it gives the car a more playful nature that’s very welcome.\nI still want a hair more feedback from the steering wheel, which gets a touch light at the limit, but the ability to throttle through turns with more confidence helps make up for it. The larger brakes are also welcome; the car slows down with the same immediacy with which it accelerates.\nThese upgrades are standard on M40i models, and the car exhibits much the same behavior as the 30i — just with a lot more power.\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n\n\n  \n    2019 BMW Z4 sDrive 30i | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\n  \n\n  \n    POWERtrains\nBoth the 30i and 40i shine in this department. Their engines are mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission and rear-wheel drive, but there’s a big difference in power output. The 30i’s four-cylinder makes 255 horsepower and 295 pounds-feet of torque — an especially eye-catching figure. This is a familiar powertrain, and it’s good in … well, pretty much every BMW vehicle, but it’s especially good here. The engine’s wide powerband and the responsiveness of the transmission when called upon with haste are real highlights of the 30i.\nThe M40i, however, is on a different level, simply because of its power difference: 382 hp and 369 pounds-feet of torque. It changes the nature of the car from something light and agile into something more sinister, with a popping soundtrack to match. Any throttle liftoff with the settings dialed up to Sport or Sport Plus is met with a delightful crackle from the exhaust. With the top down for full effect, it’s addicting.\nBMW says the M40i will go from 0-60 mph in just 3.9 seconds, but it feels quicker from the seat. It bursts off the line and charges forward, snapping off shifts and leaving a cloud of dust and noise behind it. This powertrain is familiar, as well; we recently tested it in the BMW M340i, which charged from 0-60 mph in 3.89 seconds. That number will be lower in the lighter Z4, and I wholeheartedly agree with the widespread assessment that BMW has underrated this engine’s power. (Same thing goes for the Supra.)\nThough there’s a big difference in performance, there isn’t in fuel economy: EPA ratings are 24/32/27 mpg city/highway/combined for the 30i, 24/31/26 mpg for the M40i.\n\n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    Cozy Interior\nThe Z4 is a two-seat roadster, so space will never be superfluous. I did appreciate, though, that even though the cockpit is small, there’s a decent amount of seat travel; I had no trouble finding an ideal driving position. That’s less common than you’d think in low-slung sports cars like this. I’m a fan of bright interiors, so the Vernasca Magma Red leather upholstery in the M40i felt tailor-made for my tastes — it comes as a part of the Executive Package, otherwise it costs $1,700 by itself.\nA pair of 10.25-inch screens come standard, one serving as the instrument panel and the other as a central touchscreen that can also be controlled via a rotary controller on the console between the seats. The screen in front of the driver has mostly fixed information and limited customization options, and I’m not sure it adds much — unlike Audi’s great Virtual Cockpit system. The other screen, however, is more promising; it’s canted toward the driver to make it easier to see and reach, and BMW’s multimedia systems have come a long way in both usability and functionality. There are a lot of menus to get through, so it does come with a bit of a learning curve, but I was very comfortable with it by the end of a week (let alone two).\nWireless Apple CarPlay comes standard, and though BMW once planned to charge owners a yearly subscription fee to use CarPlay after the first year, the company has since walked that back. Owners of 2019 and 2020 BMWs will now get it free; the change will happen seamlessly — whether owners signed up for a subscription beyond the first year or not. Android Auto users, however, are still out of luck, as that isn’t offered on any BMW products (including Mini).\nPricing and Value\nThe Z4 doesn’t offer much value. It doesn’t have much in the way of standard safety equipment, other than forward automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection. Adaptive cruise control, lane change assist and a Back-Up Assistant are available.\nThe 30i starts at $50,695, while the M40i starts at $64,695 (prices include destination charges). The M40i includes the contents of both the Track Handling and M Sport packages standard, in addition to the larger engine. With options, my test vehicles both stickered much higher: $63,545 for the 30i and $73,295 for the M40i.\nThe new roadster is a triumphant return for the Z4; it looks and drives better — two things you really need from a roadster. Though I didn’t miss it much while it was gone, I’m glad it’s back.\n\n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    What About the Toyota?\nA common question I get is how the Z4 compares to the Toyota Supra, which I also had the privilege of reviewing (tough life, I know). There are a lot of similarities, which is to be expected; the M40i and Supra have the same platform, the same engine and the same transmission. Though each company handled tuning elements by themselves, there’s a lot of overlap, and in this case that’s a positive: That engine is fantastic, and both cars feel underrated in terms of power and how quickly they accelerate.\nThere is some daylight between the two when it comes to handling. Adding a roof to the car makes the Supra stiffer, and it’s a bit more playful as a result. It’s easier to hang the tail out, and the steering is more dialed in. The Z4 is no slouch in this department, though; it’s just a hair behind the Toyota.\nThe Z4 makes up ground inside: better screens, better materials and better ergonomics. The Supra’s roof dips very low up front — so low that taller drivers won’t be able to see well out the front of the car (let alone the back). A BMW system powers the Supra’s multimedia, as well, but content has been pulled out of it; there are menu items that don’t lead anywhere.\nI’d give the Supra a slight edge in terms of performance, but the Z4 a gigantic edge in terms of amenities and creature comforts — though it’s an edge you’ll pay for: The Supra starts at $50,945, nearly $14,000 less than the M40i.\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 BMW Z4?\nThe BMW Z4 is a two-occupant droptop sports car with rear-wheel drive and a choice of two engines: a 255-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder or a 382-hp, turbo 3.0-liter inline-six. Both are paired to an eight-speed automatic transmission with paddle shifters affixed to the steering wheel. Fun to drive and surprisingly composed with its top raised, the Z4 even boasts a decent-size trunk, measuring around 9.9 cubic feet in capacity.\nIf you want something edgier — and the option of a manual transmission — the Toyota Supra is worth considering. The current Z4 and Supra were co-developed by BMW and Toyota, and they share the same platform and powertrains. Additional rivals include the Audi TT, Porsche’s 718 Cayman and Boxster, and the Chevrolet Corvette.\nWhat’s New on the 2023 BMW Z4?\nThe Z4 gets minor exterior styling updates, and the M Sport Package is newly standard on the entry-level sDrive30i trim. The package adds a sport-tuned suspension and M Sport steering wheel. Other minor updates include a new 19-inch wheel design and three new exterior colors: Skyscraper Grey Metallic, Portimao Blue Metallic and Thundernight Metallic.\nWhat Features in the 2023 BMW Z4 Are Most Important?\nStandard features include: \n\nPower-folding top with heated glass rear window\n10.25-inch digital instrument panel\n10.25-inch touchscreen with navigation\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nTwo USB ports\nDual-zone climate control\nLED headlights\nRain-sensing wipers\nForward collision warning with city collision mitigation\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nHeated seats\nHeated steering wheel\nAdaptive suspension\nFront and rear parking sensors\nHead-up instrument display\n12-speaker Harman Kardon stereo\nAdaptive cruise control\nLane departure warning\nBlind spot warning\n\nShould I Buy the 2023 BMW Z4?\nThe Z4 delivers a great blend of driving excitement and everyday usability. Sure, some direct competitors are quicker through corners or around a sinuous racetrack, but this BMW’s classy cabin, spacious-for-a-two-seater trunk and hushed top-up soundtrack make the Z4 so much more than a weekend plaything. The standard turbo four is peppy, but the optional turbo six gives the Z4 the speed and performance of a true sports car.",

      "expert_review": "INTRODUCED at a time (2002) when BMW design chief Chris Bangle was championing what he called “flame surfacing,” the Z4 convertible suffered from terrible inflammation. Hilariously over-styled and seriously weird, the Z4 ragtop trots out more complicated geometry than the GRE math exam — rays, vectors, bevels, chamfers, contours, concavities and cut lines all skirmish along the fuselage, and the whole is summed in a way that less suggests a fit of inspiration than an overdose of cold medicine.\n\nToo harsh? Try this experiment. The next time you see a Z4 parked on the street, hold up your thumb in a way that blocks that nutty isosceles triangle on the front quarter panel. Better, right? I can only assume Bangle was fresh out of thumbs.\n\nThe other damnably curious thing about the Z4 convertible is its lack of visual balance. The Z4 has an extravagantly long hood, but as the eye moves back along the car it seems to shorten up and dwindle, almost as if the modelers were running out of clay. Compared to the blustery prow, the truncated rear quarter and deck seem to belong to another car altogether, perhaps something driven by fat men in fezzes.\n\nThe Z4’s styling is well-flogged dead horse, and while I certainly can go on, I won’t. Suffice it to say that the car hasn’t sold up to expectations — production was scaled back last year at the Spartanburg, S.C., plant where the Z4 is made — and it’s safe to assume that Bangle’s successor, BMW brand styling maestro Adrian van Hooydonk, will extinguish the flames when it is redesigned for the 2009 model year.\n\nMeantime, we have the new Z4 Coupe, a fixed-roof, fastback riff on the Z4 that is surprisingly attractive, a Venus emerging from a sea of geometric hash. By adding some visually balancing mass to the back of the car, the fastback lid vastly improves the Z4’s looks, while adding 4 more cubic feet of usable cargo space, now up to 12 cubes. At some angles, the car looks a little like a Zagato-bodied Aston Martin from the early 1960s — no small praise. One commendable detail: Rather than add one more shut line on a car zigzagged with them, the hatch is a form-fitted shell that hides the shut lines in the contours around the windows and below the rear fender bevel. A clean bit of manufacturing, that.\n\nThe coupe model is part of a mid-lifespan makeover for the Z4, which includes minor tweaks in interior and exterior styling, revised suspension and various equipment upgrades. The 2006 models offer three new engines: the base engine is a 3.0-liter, 215-hp mill (“3.0i” in BMW nomenclature); a gustier version of the 3.0-liter putting out 255 hp (3.0si); and the smash-mouth M variant with a 3.2-liter, 330-hp motor. The coupe is available only with the 3.0si and M trim. Cog-swapping duties in the Z4 models are handled by either a six-speed manual or a six-speed automatic transmission. BMW’s unfriendly Sequential Manual Gearbox (SMG) is no longer available, even in the M version.\n\nI tested the Z4 3.0si Coupe with the six-speed automatic and, coming a week after I drove the SMG-equipped M6, which might as well be called the Ronco Lurch-o-Matic, the Z4 Coupe drove like an opium dream. As tormented as the SMG is, the auto-six, with button-like shifters on the steering wheel, is that close to transmission heaven. The step-off acceleration is potent, the shift intervals are almost imperceptible and various sport-seeking algorithms keep the transmission in the most aggressive gear for hard driving. These cybernetic-smart slush boxes (the Porsche 911’s is another one) are beginning to make me wonder if the conventional, gated manual transmission has not finally seen its day.\n\nUnder the hood of the 3.0si is one of BMW’s composite-alloy engines, an inline six-cylinder with the very latest in scuba equipment on the head: the Double Vanos variable valve timing (and lift on the intake side), three-stage variable intake plenum and electronic throttles. This is a stupendously smooth, free-revving piece of reciprocation, spewing an oily pressurized stream of torque all over the tach. Peak torque (220 pound-feet) arrives at 2,750 rpm and doesn’t start to fade until well north of 6,000 rpm.\n\nFrom a standing start, the Z4 Coupe nips to 60 mph in less than 6 seconds, yet the more interesting velocities come at mid-throttle. At highway speeds, when you double-click down to a passing gear, the car’s cabin fills with a lusty buzz and the car surges ahead with a gliding aggression. And, by the way, the small, racy three-spoked steering wheel in this car is just about perfection.\n\nIt’s been awhile since I’ve been in a Z4 convertible — I have my image to think of — so it’s difficult to judge how much of the coupe’s marmoreal solidity is a consequence of the new fixed roof. The car feels unbendable, though. Wind and road noise is muted, wheel vibration and scrub is funneled down to milliamp surges fed conductively through the seat and steering wheel, and the ride is tensed but compliant. This is, after all, a small car, without much attenuating distance between driver and road. So, BMW has deployed a variety of exotic hydraulic mounts, couplings and suspension bushings to fluff up the refinement. Especially notable is the acoustically decoupled hydraulic final drive mount, which is technology I’d associate more with Lexus than the Werks.\n\nThis isn’t the first German two-seater to get a hat transplant recently. Porsche screwed a lid on the Boxster and gave us the fantastic Cayman. A comparison is natural. The Cayman is a superb mid-engine sports car, a state of grace on four wheels, but it might be a little too vivid, loud and hard-handed for some tastes. The heavier (3,156 pounds), less powerful Z4 Coupe, especially with the Steptronic gearbox, doesn’t match the performance of the Cayman, but it’s so easy to live with that I’m happy to forgive whatever few tenths of a second it yields on a road course. Should you be so miserly as to fret about cost, the Z4 is 10 grand cheaper than the Cayman.\n\nThe Z4 Coupe is easily more car than you can fully indulge in on the street. With the Sport package’s 18-inch, 40-series tires, it grabs asphalt like a Florida congressman (what, too soon?). The steering is accurate to nine decimals, the brakes faultless.\n\nThe biggest downside of the fixed roof is the loss of the convertible’s 100 miles of headroom. Even though the top has slight bubble shapes incorporated into the profile, the headroom is pretty tight for me, at 6 foot 1, and the cabin generally is fairly restrictive. Seat rake is limited to about 20 degrees, and fore-and-aft travel runs afoul of the large bulkhead behind the seats. Add the optional deeply socketed Nubuck-leather sport seats, and the Z4 Coupe can feel like wearing your clothes from junior high. This car needs to come with a low-carb cookbook in the glove box.\n\nOn another note: A limited-function nav system is optional with the Z4 Coupe. I appreciate that BMW didn’t offer the maddening iDrive controller; however, in its place, this nav system seems to have taken limited function to a whole new level. This is one of the great riddles in automotive technology: that a company as certifiably brilliant as BMW can’t get these kinds of human interfaces right. You know, I have Ford’s number if they need it.\n\nI’m sure I’ll hear from BMW partisans now.

      "expert_review": "The new Z4 sDrive35is has as tongue-twisting a name as you’ll find in the U.S. auto market.\n\nThose who speak BMW can decipher what it means, but all you really need to know is that it fully lives up to the automaker’s Ultimate Driving Machine slogan.\n\nThe top-dog version of the Z4 retractable-hardtop roadster is a pleasure to drive on the street or the track — just don’t expect that experience to come cheap.\n\nThere are a number of versions of the Z4, all with excessively complicated names. The base model starts at $46,000 and is called the sDrive30i, and the lineup is capped by the $61,050 sDrive35is, which is new for 2011. To see a side-by-side comparison of all three trim levels, click here.\n\nStyling\n\nThe first generation of the Z4, which replaced the Z3 as a 2003 model, was more unusual than handsome, but the design hit its stride with a 2009 redesign that softened some of the prior model’s more controversial lines. The long hood and passenger compartment set nearly over the rear wheels remain, but a more traditional BMW front-end sets the tone for the entire car.\n\nThe top-of-the-line sDrive35is exterior is distinguished from other Z4s by its more aggressive front bumper styling, which calls to mind the high-performance M3, and a restyled rear bumper. Its standard 18-inch alloy wheels are an inch larger than the base ones you get on the other two trims, and there are also sDrive35is badges on the front quarter-panels.\n\nRide & Handling\n\nYou know the minute you get behind the wheel of the sDrive35is that it’s been designed to deliver responsive performance. Although there are numerous electronic gadgets, they don’t come between you and the car.\n\nThe position of the cockpit plays a part in this. As mentioned, the cabin is set near the rear wheels, and the driver looks over a long hood. The orientation enhances the sensation of rotation when carving through a corner; there’s no waiting for the rest of the car to make it through the turn because you’re practically sitting at the back of the roadster.\n\nThe sDrive35is’ natural rotation and overall balance make it a fun track car. With its technical corners and long, fast straightaways, Road America in Elkhart Lake, Wis., is good at exposing the shortcomings of production cars in a track environment. The sDrive35is is one of the few production cars I’ve driven there that managed to hold its own. It continually urges the driver on — unlike some cars, whose response tells you it’s time to back off. The low-slung Z4 sDrive35is proved to be a cornering champ, exhibiting little body roll and plenty of grip. While its responses may not be as immediate and direct as a Porsche Cayman’s, they’re not far behind.\n\nThe penalty for this sublime handling is ride quality that can be quite rough on patched asphalt roads. BMW has often impressed me with its ability to combine great handling and good ride comfort, but in the sDrive35is, ride comfort has definitely taken a backseat — or in the case of this two-seat roadster, it’s been stuffed in the trunk. Sometimes an adaptive suspension can deliver the best of both worlds, but the feature doesn’t do enough here.\n\nA Thrilling Drivetrain\n\nComplementing the handling is a wonderful twin-turbo inline-six-cylinder engine that teams with BMW’s seven-speed double-clutch transmission. While I’d still like to have the choice of a traditional manual transmission — it’s available only on the lower Z4 trim levels — this gearbox is so good you forget about stick shifts altogether.\n\nThe transmission always seems to be in the right gear, and it executes incredibly quick shifts that happen in a snap of your fingers. Matched with the 335-horsepower inline-six, the sDrive35is can go from zero to 60 mph in 4.8 seconds, according to BMW. Whether you leave the transmission in Drive or move the gear selector to its Sport mode, which lets the engine rev higher before shifting gears, the sDrive35is has a high-strung quality about it. It’s the automotive equivalent of a Super Ball bouncing around a small room.\n\nThe engine sounds great, too. The sDrive35is has a specially tuned exhaust system that results in a louder exhaust sound overall, but there’s also a lot of crackling and popping noises emanating from the dual tailpipes that make this Z4 sound like it has an aftermarket exhaust.\n\nThe sDrive35is gets an EPA-estimated 17/24 mpg city/highway and takes premium gas.\n\nConvertible Commentary\n\nWith its 2009 redesign, the Z4 went from soft-top roadster and hardtop coupe body styles to a retractable-hardtop roadster, which theoretically offers the best of both worlds. It takes about 25 seconds from start to finish to lower or raise the fully powered roof, which is operated by switches in front of the console gear selector. The top stows in the upper portion of the trunk, above a movable partition that reserves enough luggage space for a few soft bags when the top is down.\n\nIn terms of chassis rigidity, the contrast between the Z4 and BMW’s other retractable hardtop, the 3 Series convertible, is unmistakable. While the 3 Series droptop exhibits noticeable body shudder when traveling on bumpy roads with the top down, the Z4 is solid, without a hint of flex in the windshield frame and no squeaks. It goes to show the advantage that dedicated convertibles like the Z4 have over ones that are based on coupes.\n\nNoise, however, can be a problem in the Z4. With the hardtop over your head and the windows up, there’s a fair amount of road noise in the cabin at highway speeds — so much, in fact, that you may have to raise your voice when talking to the person sitting next to you. Cruising on the highway with the top down, road noise is replaced by wind noise and general wind buffeting.\n\nThe Inside\n\nCompared with the previous generation’s austere cabin, the current Z4’s interior is more welcoming. The two-seat cabin remains quite cozy, and that might be a problem for especially tall drivers. I’m 6-foot-1 and had to move the seat nearly all the way back to get comfortable, and I would have reclined the seat a little more had it not been for the rear bulkhead behind me.\n\nWhat’s a little unusual is that the sDrive35is doesn’t come with standard power seats (they’re optional), which many potential customers will likely expect considering the car’s starting price — regardless of any weight savings the manual seats may offer.\n\nThe manual seats have a range of adjustments, including seat tilt and thigh support, but the always important height adjustment doesn’t work completely when you’re sitting down; you can lower the seat cushion, but you have to climb out of the car — or otherwise take your weight off the seat — to raise it. Like the cabin itself, the seats are snug — some might call them restrictive — but the lateral support they provide is appreciated when cornering. The side bolsters are adjustable.\n\nThe Z4’s trunk measures 8 cubic feet with the top up and the movable partition out of the way. If you plan on traveling with the top down, bring soft luggage; the partition saves enough room for a few overnight bags below the lowered roof. That’s especially valuable, as storage space in the cabin is practically nonexistent.\n\nSafety\n\nStandard safety features include antilock brakes, side-impact airbags, an electronic stability system and roll bars behind each of the seats. Check out the Standard Equipment & Specs page for a full list of safety features.\n\nZ4 in the Market\n\nThe price of a Z4 has jumped considerably in the past few years, as it’s gone from a soft-top to a retractable hardtop, and the sDrive35is represents the latest big bump in cost, coming in at nearly $10,000 more than the midlevel sDrive35i. As tested with a few options, our sDrive35is was $64,225. There’s no question this version of the Z4 is a star performer on the street and the track, but that kind of money can buy a Porsche Boxster S, and that fact might give some buyers pause.\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in September 2010 about the 2011 BMW Z4 sDrive35is. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2012, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe new Z4 sDrive35is has as tongue-twisting a name as you’ll find in the U.S. auto market.\n\nThose who speak BMW can decipher what it means, but all you really need to know is that it fully lives up to the automaker’s Ultimate Driving Machine slogan.\n\nThe top-dog version of the Z4 retractable-hardtop roadster is a pleasure to drive on the street or the track — just don’t expect that experience to come cheap.\n\nThere are a number of versions of the Z4, all with excessively complicated names. The base model starts at $46,000 and is called the sDrive30i, and the lineup is capped by the $61,050 sDrive35is, which is new for 2011. To see a side-by-side comparison of all three trim levels, click here.\n\nStyling\nThe first generation of the Z4, which replaced the Z3 as a 2003 model, was more unusual than handsome, but the design hit its stride with a 2009 redesign that softened some of the prior model’s more controversial lines. The long hood and passenger compartment set nearly over the rear wheels remain, but a more traditional BMW front-end sets the tone for the entire car.\n\nThe top-of-the-line sDrive35is exterior is distinguished from other Z4s by its more aggressive front bumper styling, which calls to mind the high-performance M3, and a restyled rear bumper. Its standard 18-inch alloy wheels are an inch larger than the base ones you get on the other two trims, and there are also sDrive35is badges on the front quarter-panels.\n\nRide & Handling\nYou know the minute you get behind the wheel of the sDrive35is that it’s been designed to deliver responsive performance. Although there are numerous electronic gadgets, they don’t come between you and the car.\n\nThe position of the cockpit plays a part in this. As mentioned, the cabin is set near the rear wheels, and the driver looks over a long hood. The orientation enhances the sensation of rotation when carving through a corner; there’s no waiting for the rest of the car to make it through the turn because you’re practically sitting at the back of the roadster.\n\nThe sDrive35is’ natural rotation and overall balance make it a fun track car. With its technical corners and long, fast straightaways, Road America in Elkhart Lake, Wis., is good at exposing the shortcomings of production cars in a track environment. The sDrive35is is one of the few production cars I’ve driven there that managed to hold its own. It continually urges the driver on — unlike some cars, whose response tells you it’s time to back off. The low-slung Z4 sDrive35is proved to be a cornering champ, exhibiting little body roll and plenty of grip. While its responses may not be as immediate and direct as a Porsche Cayman’s, they’re not far behind.\n\nThe penalty for this sublime handling is ride quality that can be quite rough on patched asphalt roads. BMW has often impressed me with its ability to combine great handling and good ride comfort, but in the sDrive35is, ride comfort has definitely taken a backseat — or in the case of this two-seat roadster, it’s been stuffed in the trunk. Sometimes an adaptive suspension can deliver the best of both worlds, but the feature doesn’t do enough here.\n\nA Thrilling Drivetrain\nComplementing the handling is a wonderful twin-turbo inline-six-cylinder engine that teams with BMW’s seven-speed double-clutch transmission. While I’d still like to have the choice of a traditional manual transmission — it’s available only on the lower Z4 trim levels — this gearbox is so good you forget about stick shifts altogether.\n\nThe transmission always seems to be in the right gear, and it executes incredibly quick shifts that happen in a snap of your fingers. Matched with the 335-horsepower inline-six, the sDrive35is can go from zero to 60 mph in 4.8 seconds, according to BMW. Whether you leave the transmission in Drive or move the gear selector to its Sport mode, which lets the engine rev higher before shifting gears, the sDrive35is has a high-strung quality about it. It’s the automotive equivalent of a Super Ball bouncing around a small room.\n\nThe engine sounds great, too. The sDrive35is has a specially tuned exhaust system that results in a louder exhaust sound overall, but there’s also a lot of crackling and popping noises emanating from the dual tailpipes that make this Z4 sound like it has an aftermarket exhaust.\n\nThe sDrive35is gets an EPA-estimated 17/24 mpg city/highway and takes premium gas.\n\nConvertible Commentary\nWith its 2009 redesign, the Z4 went from soft-top roadster and hardtop coupe body styles to a retractable-hardtop roadster, which theoretically offers the best of both worlds. It takes about 25 seconds from start to finish to lower or raise the fully powered roof, which is operated by switches in front of the console gear selector. The top stows in the upper portion of the trunk, above a movable partition that reserves enough luggage space for a few soft bags when the top is down.\n\nIn terms of chassis rigidity, the contrast between the Z4 and BMW’s other retractable hardtop, the 3 Series convertible, is unmistakable. While the 3 Series droptop exhibits noticeable body shudder when traveling on bumpy roads with the top down, the Z4 is solid, without a hint of flex in the windshield frame and no squeaks. It goes to show the advantage that dedicated convertibles like the Z4 have over ones that are based on coupes.\n\nNoise, however, can be a problem in the Z4. With the hardtop over your head and the windows up, there’s a fair amount of road noise in the cabin at highway speeds — so much, in fact, that you may have to raise your voice when talking to the person sitting next to you. Cruising on the highway with the top down, road noise is replaced by wind noise and general wind buffeting.\n\nThe Inside\nCompared with the previous generation’s austere cabin, the current Z4’s interior is more welcoming. The two-seat cabin remains quite cozy, and that might be a problem for especially tall drivers. I’m 6-foot-1 and had to move the seat nearly all the way back to get comfortable, and I would have reclined the seat a little more had it not been for the rear bulkhead behind me.\n\nWhat’s a little unusual is that the sDrive35is doesn’t come with standard power seats (they’re optional), which many potential customers will likely expect considering the car’s starting price — regardless of any weight savings the manual seats may offer.\n\nThe manual seats have a range of adjustments, including seat tilt and thigh support, but the always important height adjustment doesn’t work completely when you’re sitting down; you can lower the seat cushion, but you have to climb out of the car — or otherwise take your weight off the seat — to raise it. Like the cabin itself, the seats are snug — some might call them restrictive — but the lateral support they provide is appreciated when cornering. The side bolsters are adjustable.\n\nThe Z4’s trunk measures 8 cubic feet with the top up and the movable partition out of the way. If you plan on traveling with the top down, bring soft luggage; the partition saves enough room for a few overnight bags below the lowered roof. That’s especially valuable, as storage space in the cabin is practically nonexistent.\n\nSafety\nStandard safety features include antilock brakes, side-impact airbags, an electronic stability system and roll bars behind each of the seats. Check out the Standard Equipment & Specs page for a full list of safety features.\n\nZ4 in the Market\nThe price of a Z4 has jumped considerably in the past few years, as it’s gone from a soft-top to a retractable hardtop, and the sDrive35is represents the latest big bump in cost, coming in at nearly $10,000 more than the midlevel sDrive35i. As tested with a few options, our sDrive35is was $64,225. There’s no question this version of the Z4 is a star performer on the street and the track, but that kind of money can buy a Porsche Boxster S, and that fact might give some buyers pause.\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "BMW’s Z4 has not created much of a stir since its arrival two years ago. Built in South Carolina, the two-seat roadster has polarized prospective buyers with a much more radical exterior design than its predecessor, the Z3, and sales have suffered.\n With a mid-cycle makeover and a hardtop companion on the horizon, we thought the car merited a second look while there was still enough mild weather to take the top down.\n We tested a lavishly equipped 2005 Z4 3.0i, with more than $5,000 worth of options. The bottom line: $47,245.\n HE: I don’t know how much more fun I can take — a Pontiac Solstice one week, a BMW Z4 the next. Automotive fantasies don’t get much better than this.\n SHE: I don’t think it’s a coincidence that your fantasy BMW roadster came equipped with a “dream red/black leather” interior. Because basically I think you’re dreaming if you think I’m gonna give my seal of approval to this bit of excess. Look at it this way. We could get his-and-hers Solstices or even his-and-her Mazda Miatas for the price of this Z4, and have enough money left over for a trip to the Bahamas. How can you justify spending this much cash on a seasonal vehicle in Michigan?\n HE: Honey, just drop the top on the Z4 and you can easily picture yourself in the Bahamas, with all that 90-degree weather we’ve had this summer. And I wouldn’t worry so much about Michigan winters — not with features like standard stability control and antilock brakes, plus an insulated canvas top with a glass rear window. As much as I like the Solstice, the Z4 goes one better — it looks sensational inside and out. I love the matte brushed-metal surfaces inside, and the shape, with all those sculpted curves, is enough to make any man drool.\n SHE: I have to admit BMW did a great job with the Z4 powertrain. The twin-cam 3.0-liter straight six makes 225 horsepower and feels really quick. BMW also shortened the throws on the six-speed gearbox, which makes it even easier to shift. Despite the terrific performance, you don’t pay a penalty for fuel economy. But the pennies you save on gas are more than offset by the ridiculously steep option prices. Why do heated seats, for instance, cost an extra $500?\n HE: Set the issue of price aside for a minute, and let’s talk a little more about performance. You’re right, the engine and transmission are just about perfect. But the whole car is so beautifully balanced, from the speed-sensitive steering to the multi-link rear suspension. It’s a road-hugger that you just want to drive, and drive hard, for hours on end. The fact that it looks so sweet, with such an alluring cockpit, is a bonus, as far as I’m concerned. Very few two-seaters in this price class — the Chevrolet Corvette might be the exception — offer the full package like this BMW does.\n SHE: As far as convertibles go, the Z4 is fine and very livable. The optional power top is extremely easy to operate, and there is a surprising amount of room in the trunk. And you can see the Germans tried hard to cram as many amenities as they could into the cabin, including little touches like a glove box behind the seats that has a penholder and an elastic strap for a parking card. The standard safety hardware is also pretty impressive, not to mention high-tech. In addition to side air bags and rollover protection, the Z4 comes with run-flat tires, rain-sensing wipers and adaptive brake lights.\n HE: For a change, I don’t have much to grouse about. My biggest beef is with the fancy extra-cost M sport bucket seats, which just didn’t fit my big butt. I still crave a Corvette in my driveway — but I surely wouldn’t mind if a BMW Z4 suddenly dropped out of the heavens one day and landed in my garage. With Paris Hilton in the passenger seat, of course.\n SHE: Oh, poor Paris.\n – – –\nHe drove, she drove Anita and Paul Lienert are partners in Lienert & Lienert, an Ann Arbor automotive information services company.\n– – –\n2005 BMW Z4 3.0i\n Type: Front-engine, rear-wheel drive, two-passenger convertible.\n Price: Base, $41,995 (inc. $695 destination charge); as tested, $47,245.\n Engine: 3.0-liter I-6; 225-hp; 214 lb-ft torque.\n EPA fuel economy: 21 mpg city/29 mpg highway.\n Where built: Greer, S.C.\n Key competitors: Audi TT, Chevrolet Corvette, Chrysler Crossfire, Ford Thunderbird, Honda S2000, Lotus Elise, Mercedes-Benz SLK-Class, Nissan 350Z, Porsche Boxster.\n 12-month insurance cost, estimated by AAA Michigan: $1,687. (Rates may be higher or lower, depending on coverage and driving record.)\n Anita’s rating: 4\nLikes: Good safety equipment, including standard ABS, stability control, side air bags, adaptive brake lights, rain-sensing wipers, run-flat tires, active knee and rollover protection. Surprisingly roomy trunk. Optional power top is easy to operate with push of one button on IP. Small glove box behind seats with penholder, elastic strap for parking card.\n Dislikes: Needs adjustable pedals. Cabin and seats felt cramped. Too expensive. Heated seats cost an extra $500.\n Paul’s rating: 5\nLikes: Strong inline six-cylinder engine provides quick acceleration. Lovely 6-speed gearbox with razor-sharp shifts. Distinctive and voluptuous exterior. Brushed matte-metal interior trim. Sensational handling. Good fuel economy for a sports car. Gorgeous alloy wheels.\n Dislikes: Optional M seats too tight in the butt. Not much storage space in cabin. Dumb cup holders.\n Vehicle ratings: 1. Unacceptable, 2. Subpar, 3. Acceptable, 4. Above Average, 5. World Class",

      "expert_review": "Like Stacy’s mom, BMW’s Z4 has still got it going on. Munich’s two-seat runabout hard-top or soft-top convertible remains a compelling choice for driving enthusiasts in a way some of its quicker, fresher competitors do not. Throw in decent reliability and gas mileage, and it’s easy to see why it’s been a Cars.com Best Bet for two years running. A replacement is on its way soon, but if you can tolerate the current generation’s styling — sorry, I really can’t — it’s worth a look.\n  My review focuses on the two-seater Z4 coupe. Little has changed for 2008, so it still comes in one trim, the 255-horsepower 3.0si. The roadster comes as an entry-level 215-hp 3.0i or a beefier 3.0si, and both body styles offer a six-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission. An extra $9,700 over the price of the 3.0si will put you in the scintillating Z4 M, also available as a coupe or roadster; it’s covered separately in Cars.com’s Research section. Click here to compare all Z4 variants.\n  Still Unique  The coupe looks sharp from certain angles, and it’s different enough from the roadster to draw attention. We shot a video of the car in a park south of our downtown Chicago offices, and a Nissan 350Z owner riding by on his bike stopped to admire the car’s slung-back stance. I tried to argue otherwise: I find the well-packaged rear pleasing enough, but the long nose and awkward cut lines look like a cubist rendition of the earlier Z3. Bicycle Man would have none of it.\n  The BMW Z4 has been around since late 2002, a product of BMW chief designer Chris Bangle’s so-called “visual energy” approach. For 2006, the automaker tempered the Z4’s look to what you see today, with a wider grille and reshaped fog lights. The coupe arrived the same year, but it’s still relatively rare: In its first 13 months on the market, the roadster outsold it at a ratio of 7 to 1.\n  The roadster comes standard with a manual top. A power-operated top is optional. Seventeen-inch alloy wheel and tires are standard on all models; 18-inchers come with the optional Sport Package. City drivers should note the Z4’s alley-friendly turning circle of 32.2 feet, which beats competitors like the 350Z, Audi TT, Porsche Boxster/Cayman and Mercedes-Benz SLK by anywhere from 2.4 to 4.2 feet. \n  How It Moves  BMW’s normally aspirated inline-six still packs plenty of heat, if not the brute force of the turbocharged version that’s replaced it elsewhere in BMW’s lineup. Dubbed N52, the 3.0-liter engines use the automaker’s intricate valve-lift acrobatics to deliver 215 hp in the Z4 3.0i and, thanks to a three-stage intake manifold, 255 hp in the 3.0si. The latter engine offers ample torque — 220 pounds-feet at 2,750 rpm — for usable power as low as 1,800 rpm, which means you can muscle past slow-moving traffic in sixth gear from 50 mph up.\n  Not that you won’t want to downshift. The six-cylinder feels smoother than in the last X3 crossover I tested, whose overactive automatic gave the engine a peaky, uneven character. Here, my six-speed manual Z4 coupe weighed in at a slim 3,108 pounds — less than a 350Z or SLK, though more than the flyweight Cayman and two-wheel-drive TT — and power builds much more fluidly. Reaching the tach’s upper boundaries is easy enough, and a swell of acceleration comes expectedly on the way there.\n  The manual shifter flicks into gear with well-oiled, if somewhat rubbery, movements. The setup is worthy of a sports car, to be sure, but it lacks the machined precision of the 350Z’s short-throw shifter. Rush-hour commuters should note there’s a heavy clutch with a narrow engagement point, which can make stop-and-go traffic a real bear.\n  Where BMW excels is accelerator response: Toe the gas pedal, and the tach needle springs to attention with little delay. Let off, and it goes limp just as fast. The setup allows quick rev-matches during gear changes and, if you’re into it, expert heel-and-toe downshifting. Few competitors have the same swift response — the TT’s throttle, in particular, lags a bit.\n  Put the pedal down, and BMW says 60 mph comes in 5.6 seconds in the 3.0si manual. That’s about midpack: The base Cayman and ’09 SLK300 are marginally slower, according to their respective automakers, while the six-cylinder TT with its dual-clutch gearbox is a bit quicker. Nissan doesn’t publish acceleration figures for the 350Z, but most independent tests put the 306-hp car in the low 5-second range.\n  Gas mileage, at 18/28 mpg city/highway with the manual transmission and either engine, leads all but the Cayman when you look at six-cylinder performance. The automatic adds 1 mpg in the city. Like many of its peers, the rear-wheel-drive BMW Z4 coupe sips premium fuel. \n  Turning & Stopping  Opt for the Sport Package and you’ll get BMW’s Dynamic Driving Control, which adds a Sport button next to the shifter. My car came thus equipped. Pressing it quickens accelerator response, though I’m lukewarm on the results: Rev-matching is no easier than it already was, and the gas pedal gets too touchy for smooth around-town driving.\n  More acceptable is the Sport mode’s reduction in power-steering assist, which you’ll notice immediately. The steering wheel requires more effort to turn, but it gains a bit of turn-in precision; rotate the wheel, and the nose darts swiftly to one side or the other. The car’s underpinnings are a reliable partner for such maneuvers. The suspension utilizes struts up front and a multilink setup in back, and the setup is sport-tuned with the Sport Package. Body roll is minimal, and the Z4 holds its course well through a corner. I’ve driven the Cayman S, not the base Cayman, but Porsche’s mid-engine competitor seems better balanced — it’s easier to hang the tail mid-corner and reel it in as you’re straightening out. The Z4 exhibits similarly predictable control, but its chassis feels less prepared for dips and rises in the road, especially if you’re flinging the car through a corner at the same time. The 350Z and Mercedes-Benz SLK are even choppier in this regard. I haven’t driven the TT enough to offer a conclusive handling evaluation, but its nose-heavy weight distribution suggests it may understeer a bit more than the others.\n  Road noise on the highway is high, but ride quality is tolerable. The suspension responds loudly to bumps, but it sorts them out so your spine doesn’t have to. Another plus is the BMW  Z4’s standard four-wheel-disc antilock brakes, which deliver the confident stopping power I’ve come to expect from BMW. It can take some time to get accustomed to the pedal’s grabby response, however. \n  The Inside  Cramped, sparsely adorned cabins are to be expected in this class. Considering such, the BMW Z4 makes good use of its space. The dashboard employs low-gloss materials and genuine wood or aluminum, though some of the plastics around the window sills have a grainy, less premium finish. The seats and doors have a high grade of semi-gathered leather. Faux leather is standard on the Z4 3.0i, while an extended-leather option on the 3.0si adds cowhide to the windshield frame, sun visors and elsewhere.\n  The optional power seats in my test car had small but robust bolsters; further down the options list are sport seats with thicker bolsters. Either way, the chairs have surprising adjustment range and could easily accommodate 6-foot-plus drivers. Less generous are the storage and convenience provisions, which include a tiny glove box and a shelved compartment between the seats. The BMW Z4’s flip-out cupholders — one to either side of the dash — feel about as sturdy as the Detroit Lions’ defensive line.\n  Cargo volume behind the seats measures 10.1 cubic feet in the coupe and 9.2 cubic feet in the roadster with the top raised. With it down, the figure drops to 8.5 cubic feet. Those numbers roughly match the SLK (9.8 cubic feet with the top up) and beat the 350Z (6.8 cubic feet in the coupe). Drivers who want more cargo versatility should consider the TT coupe and Cayman, whose cargo areas (13.1 and 14.5 cubic feet, respectively) lead the group. \n  Safety & Reliability  Being low-volume sellers, the Z4 coupe and its competitors have not been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. Standard safety features include front chest and knee airbags, as well as side-impact airbags mounted in the doors. Head-protecting side curtain airbags aren’t available. The 350Z, Cayman and Boxster offer them.\n  Also standard on the rear-wheel Z4 are antilock brakes and an electronic stability system with traction control. A brake-drying function keeps the discs dry during wet weather. Adaptive brake lights, which illuminate brighter during hard braking to warn drivers behind the Z4, are also standard.\n  Reliability may not make or break the average sports-car purchase, but the Z4’s is worth mentioning. In Consumer Reports surveys, the car has emerged with good overall scores in most of the years it’s been on the market. The publication predicts reliability for a new ’08 will be Better Than Average. The Cayman and 350Z are Much Better Than Average and Average, respectively, while the redesigned TT lacks sufficient data to be rated. The SLK is the stinker of the group, with awful reliability scores in the years the current generation has been rated. \n  Features & Pricing  Excluding the destination charge, the BMW Z4 3.0i starts at $36,700. The 3.0si coupe runs $40,700, while the 3.0si roadster is $42,700. Those figures closely follow the TT’s prices, and a well-equipped 350Z can be priced to match. The Porsche and Mercedes-Benz competitors start in the mid- to high 40s.\n  Standard features on the Z4 3.0i include 17-inch wheels, faux leather upholstery, manual A/C and a 10-speaker CD stereo with an auxiliary MP3 jack. The 3.0si adds automatic climate control, leather seats, a trip computer and upgraded THX-certified audio. Among the options are Sport and Premium packages, sport seats, upgraded leather, heated seats and a navigation system. An automatic transmission runs $1,325, while a power top on the roadster adds $750. Expect a loaded Z4 to top out around $55,000. \n  Z4 in the Market  The aging BMW Z4 doesn’t offer the latest infotainment or luxury features, but it connects the driver to the car in a way that perhaps only the Cayman can flat-out exceed. If you read to this point in the review, I suspect the car’s styling has scored more hits than misses for you. I can’t bring myself to agree, but I’ll assert that the car performs well in many other not-so-subjective areas.\n  A BMW spokesman told me a Z4 replacement will arrive for 2009, so right now there are deals to be had. If you’re still wealthy enough to drop 45 large on one of these weekend toys, you positively must share your investment strategies with the rest of us. Then give the BMW Z4 a look. \n\n\n\n     Send Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe two-seat Z4 roadster uses a standard folding metal hardtop. Trim levels include the four-cylinder sDrive28i, six-cylinder sDrive35i and high-performance sDrive35is, all of which are turbocharged. All three also have standard Driving Dynamics Control, a feature that allows drivers to vary steering and accelerator settings to suit their tastes. Anyone considering the entry-level Z4 might cross-shop Nissan’s redesigned 370Z; a loaded Z4, on the other hand, could compete with the Mercedes-Benz SLK, Audi TT or Porsche Boxster.New for 2013Despite a starting price that’s now $1,300 less, new standard features have been added including power-adjustable front seats with driver-side memory, dual-zone automatic air conditioning, aluminum trim, auto-dimming mirrors, ambient lighting, a universal garage door opener and a compass. ExteriorBMW says all of the Z4’s surface lines strive toward a point on the road ahead. It’s evidently shown in the headlights and hood. BMW’s dual-kidney grille remains front and center. Exterior features include:\n\nStandard 17-inch alloy wheels\nOptional 18- or 19-inch wheels\nOptional automatic high beams\nUnique bumpers, tailpipes and mirrors on sDrive35is\nOptional aerodynamic kit emulates sDrive35is look\n\nInteriorAvailable sun-reflective leather is designed to keep surfaces cooler on a sunny day. Other options include leather-upholstered dashboard and door panels, heated seats and a heated steering wheel. The Z4’s iDrive unit, included with an optional navigation system, has better graphics, more shortcut keys and improved menu functionality. Interior features include:\n\nStandard simulated leather seats\nOptional leather upholstery and sport seats\nOptional upgraded stereo\nThicker steering wheel, aggressively bolstered seats, faux carbon-fiber trim and gray instruments (sDrive35is)\n\nUnder the HoodThe sDrive28i’s turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder makes 240 horsepower and 260 pounds-feet of torque. It works with a six-speed manual or eight-speed automatic transmission. \nA turbocharged 3.0-liter six-cylinder with 300 hp and 300 pounds-feet of torque powers the sDrive35i, which comes with a six-speed manual or seven-speed dual-clutch automatic. The sDrive35is, meanwhile, adds more turbo boost to provide 335 hp and 332 pounds-feet of torque. Pushed hard, the engine can provide up to 369 pounds-feet of torque for a few seconds. It works through a performance-calibrated version of the dual-clutch automatic. BMW says the sDrive35is can hit 60 mph in 4.8 seconds. Mechanical features include:\n\nRecalibrated power steering and suspension tuning (sDrive35is)\nOptional adaptive suspension\nFuel-saving auto stop-start technology (sDrive28i) \nRear-wheel drive\n\nSafetyThe standard stability system uses a brake-drying function to keep the discs dry during wet weather. Seat-mounted side-impact airbags are standard, as are four-wheel-disc antilock brakes. Other safety features include:\n\nHead-protection extension on side airbags\nKnee airbags\nTraction control\nAvailable front and rear parking sensors",
