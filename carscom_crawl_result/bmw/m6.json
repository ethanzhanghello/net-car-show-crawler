      "expert_review": "Some things just don’t go together. In cars, sportiness and excess weight are a poor pairing.\n\nYet that’s what BMW has tried to merge in the new M6 convertible, a 560-horsepower cruise missile with a power-folding soft-top, all of which tips the scales at more than 4,500 pounds. The result is mixed.\n\nThe 2012 BMW M6 is an exquisite convertible in the grand touring vein, but despite its M badge, the car’s size and hefty curb weight will disappoint enthusiasts.\n\nThe M6 convertible starts at $115,295 including an $895 destination charge and a $1,300 gas-guzzler tax. With options like lane departure warning, a heated steering wheel, LED headlights and a head-up display, among other things, our car’s as-tested price was $122,095. That kind of money can get you a Jaguar XKR convertible — or an Audi R8 Spyder if you can stretch your budget a little higher; to see how these convertibles’ specs compare to the BMW’s, click here.\n\nHercules Under the Hood\nThere’s a forceful effortlessness to the M6’s twin-turbo V-8. The car builds speed rapidly, but it does so smoothly and without the franticness of some high-performance cars. It’s a sneaky kind of power delivery — the kind that can put you 20 mph over the speed limit without your really trying. BMW says the M6 can go from zero to 60 mph in just 4.3 seconds on its way to an electronically limited top speed of 155 mph.\n\nThe highway becomes your playground, as the V-8’s formidable power reserve lets the car change speeds at will. It doesn’t feel taxed in the least, even when whizzing by traffic.\n\nThese powertrain characteristics are a departure from the prior-generation M6, which was last offered for the 2010 model year. It was powered by a 500-hp, 5.0-liter V-10 that made 383 pounds-feet of torque at a high 6,100 rpm. The new M6’s twin-turbo V-8 makes more power — 560 hp — but the more significant change as it relates to daily driving is that the car’s peak torque of 500 pounds-feet arrives at a low 1,500 rpm. That means you don’t have to work the V-8 nearly as hard as the V-10 to extract its performance; it’s available nearly from idle, and this helps mask the fact that you’re in a two-ton-plus convertible.\n\nThe V-8 drives the rear wheels through a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission. A conventional manual transmission isn’t offered, but one should be on a car like this. Despite the dual-clutch gearbox’s ability to shift faster than any human, some purists still want a manual with a clutch pedal on the floor. It’s puzzling that BMW disregards those buyers with this car — an M model, no less. The dual-clutch transmission includes a fully automatic mode with customizable shift characteristics, as well as a manual mode that lets you change gears using the console selector or steering-wheel paddles.\n\nThe manual mode delivers incredibly swift shifts that are on par with the quickness of Porsche’s PDK transmission. Basically, the moment you press a paddle or nudge the gear selector, you’re in the next gear. There’s no waiting around for the shift to happen, as can be the case with a traditional automatic’s manual mode. When downshifting, however, it feels like the transmission lets go momentarily before engaging the next gear. The car also rolls backward slightly when starting off from a stop — just like a car with a manual transmission.\n\nLeft in Drive, the dual-clutch transmission does a good impersonation of a conventional automatic, with smooth, and unobtrusive gear changes. The rocker switch below the gear selector adjusts shift characteristics, making the transmission upshift later and downshift earlier for performance driving, or the opposite for more leisurely cruising. There are three levels.\n\nBesides the lack of a conventional manual offering, the biggest issue with the drivetrain is the lazy gas pedal response from a standing start. There’s too much lag from the time you press the pedal until the car responds. \n\nFuel-saving auto stop-start technology is cropping up on more and more cars, and the M6 has it, too, though you have to press a button if you want to use it. The stop-start system shuts the V-8 down smoothly when you’re waiting at a stoplight, for instance, and restarts just as seamlessly. However, I really heard the starter motor whenever it did. Maybe that’s because I had the top down, but in the Mercedes-Benz CLS63 AMG and Porsche Panamera, both of which have this feature, engine restarts were much quieter.\n\nDon’t let any fuel-saving technology distract you from the fact that the M6 is one gas-swilling convertible, with an EPA-estimated 14/20 mpg city/highway — hence the gas-guzzler tax. For its class, though, the M6’s fuel-economy estimates aren’t out of line, and they’re substantially better than the old M6’s 11/17 mpg rating.\n\nRide & Handling\nBMW provides a number of ways to tweak the M6’s ride and handling characteristics, but at the end of the day this isn’t the car to take to your favorite stretch of back-road blacktop.\n\nNot that it can’t handle a curve: Throw the M6 into a corner and it’ll round it, but you’ll feel the car’s weight, and the steering tuning won’t draw you in. The car just isn’t the right tool for this job.\n\nThe suspension, steering and throttle are all independently adjustable, which is great because you can tune aspects of the car to your liking, as opposed to a blanket “Sport” mode. Even better, BMW includes two M Drive buttons on the steering wheel that can immediately recall favorite setting combinations. The suspension’s Comfort setting offers good ride compliance, and Sport and Sport Plus provide a firmer ride. The adjustable steering increases the effort needed to turn the wheel, but like the suspension settings, the difference between them isn’t dramatic; we’d like to see more variation between the comfort- and performance-oriented modes.\n\nConvertible Commentary\nThe M6 convertible has a standard power soft-top, and it does a great job keeping wind noise out of the cabin — even on the highway. The more persistent sounds are tire and road noise, with wind noise beginning to crop up only around 70 mph.\n\nThe cabin is breezy at highway speeds with the top down, but it’s still possible to hold a conversation with your passengers. Wind buffeting is thankfully minimal.\n\nIt takes about 22 seconds for the top to lower and a little longer for it to motor back up. The vertical glass rear window is independent of the top, which allows you to lower it when the top is up or leave it up to act as a rear windscreen when the top is down. You can operate the top on the move as long as you don’t exceed 25 mph.\n\nWhen lowered, the top stows in the upper part of the 10.6-cubic-foot trunk, separated from any luggage by a soft divider. If you don’t plan on lowering the top, you can swing the divider up,  giving you a little extra cargo room and making it easier to fit tall pieces of luggage.\n\nThe Inside\nThe M6’s cabin is luxurious, wrapped as it is in leather and adorned with carbon fiber trim. The dashboard is dominated by a standard 10.2-inch widescreen display that works with the latest generation of BMW’s iDrive control system. IDrive has dominion over most vehicle functions, like the stereo and navigation system, but there are separate controls for the climate system below the screen. The knob-based iDrive system has improved with successive generations, and it’s now relatively intuitive.\n\nThe power-operated leather sport seats offer a range of adjustability, including such fine adjustments as upper backrest angle and customizable thigh support; BMW boasts 20 movements in all. The seats are supportive but not overly confining, which seems like a wise compromise in this kind of car.\n\nThe M6’s two-person backseat can fit adults in a pinch if the person up front is willing to share legroom. Frankly, someone in the front seat would probably have to move the seat forward for a child, as well.\n\nSafety\nLow-volume convertibles like the M6 aren’t typically subjected to crash tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, so we’re left to evaluate the car’s list of safety features.\n\nThe M6 has antilock brakes and an electronic stability system, which are mandatory for all new cars beginning with the 2012 model year. Additional standard safety features include side-impact airbags for the front seats, active front head restraints, pop-up aluminum roll bars behind the backseat, a backup camera, and front and rear parking sensors.\n\nA $1,900 Driver Assistance Package includes a blind spot monitoring system, lane departure warning and additional cameras. Night vision with pedestrian detection costs $2,600.\n\nFor a full list of safety features, check out the Features & Specs page. To see how well different child-safety seats fit in the backseat, click here.\n\nM6 Convertible in the Market\nBMW’s M brand has special meaning for many car enthusiasts, who revere its history of performance cars. The M6 convertible’s V-8 makes massive power, but the car’s size and weight put it at odds with the expectations of driving enthusiasts who are familiar with other M models. For $23,000 more than the related 650i convertible — which is no performance slouch — the M6 convertible needs to move the needle more than it does.\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "The 2006 BMW M6 Coupe is a spectacular piece of automotive engineering, so much so that I might not purchase it even if I were a multimillionaire.  I have my reasons. Temptation is chief among them.\nThe tested M6, an all-new creation for the 2006 model year, came with a 500-horsepower, 40-valve, high-compression V-10 with variable valve timing. That translates to a relentless temptation to nail the accelerator and let the M6 rip along at a pace it enjoys most — 80 miles per hour and up, by my count.\nOf course, in the metropolitan Sacramento area, odds are that cruising along at a minimum 80 mph will eventually catch up with you, causing authorities to confiscate your driving license and perhaps your M6 along with it.  The thing is, the M6 — wearing a gaudy sticker of $106,690 on the tester — all but begs you to drive it fast. This car hates going 35 mph, clunking and stumbling along. Blame that in part on its seven-speed sequential manual gearbox, the most complex transmission I’ve ever experienced.\nOK, there’s no clutch. A computer chip and an electrohydraulic mechanism handle that. That’s good, because everything else associated with the drivetrain keeps you really busy.\nThe gearbox, featuring a center console-mounted shifter looking every bit like that on a pedal clutch-equipped sports car, can be dialed up for sequential shifts. Just remember to push the shifter forward for downshifts, and pull back for upshifts.\nGot that? Good, now hang on.\nAggressive accelerations will mash you into the seat like the meaty hand of a schoolyard bully. The noise from the V-10 at such moments is decidedly competition-caliber. From a standing start, it takes just an eye-blink over 4 seconds to hit 60 mph.\nAnd like other high-performance autos — the Porsche 911 and AMG-tuned Mercedes-Benz coupes come to mind — taking your foot off the gas creates instant, significant deceleration — a feeling like that same bully sneaked up and slapped you in the back of the head.\nYou can also shift gears with the steering wheel-mounted paddle shifters — downshifts with the left hand and upshifts with the right.\nSmack the console gear shifter to the right two times, and you’re in full-automatic mode … and I use that term loosely. This is not the automatic glide you get in a Toyota Camry.\nInstead, applying steady pressure to the accelerator in the M6 creates the kind of lurches and spurts one expects from a manual gearbox. Even though there’s no foot clutch, the M6 will edge backward on an incline if you don’t have sufficient pressure on the gas pedal.\nSimple, you say? Wait, we’re just getting started.\nDid I mention the center console buttons that can activate/deactivate/adjust engine power, stability control and electronic damping? Or the console button that allows the driver to choose among five distinct driving modes (cool comfort to high performance) for each transmission setting? Or the individual throttles for each cylinder in the engine?\nYes, I’m serious! That’s 10 electronically controlled throttles.\nWhat the M6 buyer really needs is a free week with NASCAR star Jeff Gordon just to learn all the driving options on the car.\nEssentially, the M6 is a near-race car with velvet touches. Those include generous wood trim, wall-to-wall leather surfaces, a roadside-assistance system anchored by Bluetooth wireless technology, aluminum suspension components, a kicking Logic 7 surround-sound audio system, a navigation system, power tilt/telescoping steering wheel, rain-sensing windshield wipers, automatic parking-distance sensors, quad chrome exhaust pipes, state-of-the-art air bags and huge, four-wheel, ventilated disc brakes.\nThe race-car fantasy is further enhanced by the coupe’s sleek profile, wrap-around body-colored bumpers and a wide stance that looks racetrack-ready. On the tester, carbon fiber black trim on the dash and spanning the roof made me feel like I should be in radio communication with my pit crew on the drive home.\nThings not to like? Here they are:\n* 12 miles per gallon in the city and 18 mpg on the highway, topped off with a $3,000 gas guzzler tax and premium fuel requirement.\n* BMW’s still-confusing iDrive system, where you manipulate a knob to control the navigation system, in-car climate, communication and entertainment systems.\n* The is-my-turn-signal-on-or-not switch. I have yet to master the touch of this overly sensitive system.\n* Two rear seats with no regard for humans with legs.\nThe suspension is a mixed bag: It holds high-speed corners like a monorail, but it is teeth-chattering stiff in all conditions.\nGiven all this, you might conclude that I didn’t like the M6. You’d be wrong: I thought it was an amazing example of contemporary automotive technology and style.\nBut since I want to keep my driver’s license and routinely transport multiple passengers who insist on old-school-sedan comfort, it’s never going to darken my driveway. (And, of course, there’s that $100,000-plus sticker.)\nNow, if I won the lottery and had access to a racetrack where I could rent some time alone with my M6, well, that would be a different story.\nBMW M6 at a glance   Make/model: 2006 BMW M6 Coupe  Vehicle type: Four-passenger, two-door, luxury sports coupe   Base price: $96,100 (as tested, $106,690)  Engine: 5-liter V-10 with 500 horsepower at 7,750 revolutions per minute and 383 foot-pounds of torque at 6,100 rpm   EPA fuel economy: 12 miles per gallon city; 18 mpg highway (premium required)   Transmission: Seven-speed sequential manual gearbox with full-automatic option and other special features Steering: Power-assisted rack and pinion with special features   Brakes: Power-assisted, four-wheel ventilated discs, with anti-lock and other braking-enhancement features   Suspension: Independent, aluminum double-pivot, strut-type on front; independent, aluminum multi-link on rear  Fuel tank: 18.5 gallons   Passenger volume: 81 cubic feet Cargo volume: 13 cubic feet Curb weight: 4,012 pounds  Height: 54 inches  Length: 191.8 inches  Wheelbase: 109.5 inches   Width: 80.4 inches   Track: 61.7 inches on front; 62.4 inches on rear   Tires: P255/40ZR19 performance radials on front; P285/35ZR19 performance radials on rear  Final assembly point: Dingolfing, Germany\nThe Bee’s Mark Glover can be reached at (916) 321-1184 or mglover@sacbee.com.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in August 2012 about the 2012 BMW M6. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2013, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nSome things just don’t go together. In cars, sportiness and excess weight are a poor pairing.\n\nYet that’s what BMW has tried to merge in the new M6 convertible, a 560-horsepower cruise missile with a power-folding soft-top, all of which tips the scales at more than 4,500 pounds. The result is mixed.\n\nThe 2012 BMW M6 is an exquisite convertible in the grand touring vein, but despite its M badge, the car’s size and hefty curb weight will disappoint enthusiasts.\n\nThe M6 convertible starts at $115,295 including an $895 destination charge and a $1,300 gas-guzzler tax. With options like lane departure warning, a heated steering wheel, LED headlights and a head-up display, among other things, our car’s as-tested price was $122,095. That kind of money can get you a Jaguar XKR convertible — or an Audi R8 Spyder if you can stretch your budget a little higher; to see how these convertibles’ specs compare to the BMW’s, click here.\n\nHercules Under the Hood\nThere’s a forceful effortlessness to the M6’s twin-turbo V-8. The car builds speed rapidly, but it does so smoothly and without the franticness of some high-performance cars. It’s a sneaky kind of power delivery — the kind that can put you 20 mph over the speed limit without your really trying. BMW says the M6 can go from zero to 60 mph in just 4.3 seconds on its way to an electronically limited top speed of 155 mph.\n\nThe highway becomes your playground, as the V-8’s formidable power reserve lets the car change speeds at will. It doesn’t feel taxed in the least, even when whizzing by traffic.\n\nThese powertrain characteristics are a departure from the prior-generation M6, which was last offered for the 2010 model year. It was powered by a 500-hp, 5.0-liter V-10 that made 383 pounds-feet of torque at a high 6,100 rpm. The new M6’s twin-turbo V-8 makes more power — 560 hp — but the more significant change as it relates to daily driving is that the car’s peak torque of 500 pounds-feet arrives at a low 1,500 rpm. That means you don’t have to work the V-8 nearly as hard as the V-10 to extract its performance; it’s available nearly from idle, and this helps mask the fact that you’re in a two-ton-plus convertible.\n\nThe V-8 drives the rear wheels through a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission. A conventional manual transmission isn’t offered, but one should be on a car like this. Despite the dual-clutch gearbox’s ability to shift faster than any human, some purists still want a manual with a clutch pedal on the floor. It’s puzzling that BMW disregards those buyers with this car — an M model, no less. The dual-clutch transmission includes a fully automatic mode with customizable shift characteristics, as well as a manual mode that lets you change gears using the console selector or steering-wheel paddles.\n\nThe manual mode delivers incredibly swift shifts that are on par with the quickness of Porsche’s PDK transmission. Basically, the moment you press a paddle or nudge the gear selector, you’re in the next gear. There’s no waiting around for the shift to happen, as can be the case with a traditional automatic’s manual mode. When downshifting, however, it feels like the transmission lets go momentarily before engaging the next gear. The car also rolls backward slightly when starting off from a stop — just like a car with a manual transmission.\n\nLeft in Drive, the dual-clutch transmission does a good impersonation of a conventional automatic, with smooth, and unobtrusive gear changes. The rocker switch below the gear selector adjusts shift characteristics, making the transmission upshift later and downshift earlier for performance driving, or the opposite for more leisurely cruising. There are three levels.\n\nBesides the lack of a conventional manual offering, the biggest issue with the drivetrain is the lazy gas pedal response from a standing start. There’s too much lag from the time you press the pedal until the car responds.\n\nFuel-saving auto stop-start technology is cropping up on more and more cars, and the M6 has it, too, though you have to press a button if you want to use it. The stop-start system shuts the V-8 down smoothly when you’re waiting at a stoplight, for instance, and restarts just as seamlessly. However, I really heard the starter motor whenever it did. Maybe that’s because I had the top down, but in the Mercedes-Benz CLS63 AMG and Porsche Panamera, both of which have this feature, engine restarts were much quieter.\n\nDon’t let any fuel-saving technology distract you from the fact that the M6 is one gas-swilling convertible, with an EPA-estimated 14/20 mpg city/highway — hence the gas-guzzler tax. For its class, though, the M6’s fuel-economy estimates aren’t out of line, and they’re substantially better than the old M6’s 11/17 mpg rating.\n\nRide & Handling\nBMW provides a number of ways to tweak the M6’s ride and handling characteristics, but at the end of the day this isn’t the car to take to your favorite stretch of back-road blacktop.\n\nNot that it can’t handle a curve: Throw the M6 into a corner and it’ll round it, but you’ll feel the car’s weight, and the steering tuning won’t draw you in. The car just isn’t the right tool for this job.\n\nThe suspension, steering and throttle are all independently adjustable, which is great because you can tune aspects of the car to your liking, as opposed to a blanket “Sport” mode. Even better, BMW includes two M Drive buttons on the steering wheel that can immediately recall favorite setting combinations. The suspension’s Comfort setting offers good ride compliance, and Sport and Sport Plus provide a firmer ride. The adjustable steering increases the effort needed to turn the wheel, but like the suspension settings, the difference between them isn’t dramatic; we’d like to see more variation between the comfort- and performance-oriented modes.\n\nConvertible Commentary\nThe M6 convertible has a standard power soft-top, and it does a great job keeping wind noise out of the cabin — even on the highway. The more persistent sounds are tire and road noise, with wind noise beginning to crop up only around 70 mph.\n\nThe cabin is breezy at highway speeds with the top down, but it’s still possible to hold a conversation with your passengers. Wind buffeting is thankfully minimal.\n\nIt takes about 22 seconds for the top to lower and a little longer for it to motor back up. The vertical glass rear window is independent of the top, which allows you to lower it when the top is up or leave it up to act as a rear windscreen when the top is down. You can operate the top on the move as long as you don’t exceed 25 mph.\n\nWhen lowered, the top stows in the upper part of the 10.6-cubic-foot trunk, separated from any luggage by a soft divider. If you don’t plan on lowering the top, you can swing the divider up, giving you a little extra cargo room and making it easier to fit tall pieces of luggage.\n\nThe Inside\nThe M6’s cabin is luxurious, wrapped as it is in leather and adorned with carbon fiber trim. The dashboard is dominated by a standard 10.2-inch widescreen display that works with the latest generation of BMW’s iDrive control system. IDrive has dominion over most vehicle functions, like the stereo and navigation system, but there are separate controls for the climate system below the screen. The knob-based iDrive system has improved with successive generations, and it’s now relatively intuitive.\n\nThe power-operated leather sport seats offer a range of adjustability, including such fine adjustments as upper backrest angle and customizable thigh support; BMW boasts 20 movements in all. The seats are supportive but not overly confining, which seems like a wise compromise in this kind of car.\n\nThe M6’s two-person backseat can fit adults in a pinch if the person up front is willing to share legroom. Frankly, someone in the front seat would probably have to move the seat forward for a child, as well.\n\nSafety\nLow-volume convertibles like the M6 aren’t typically subjected to crash tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, so we’re left to evaluate the car’s list of safety features.\n\nThe M6 has antilock brakes and an electronic stability system, which are mandatory for all new cars beginning with the 2012 model year. Additional standard safety features include side-impact airbags for the front seats, active front head restraints, pop-up aluminum roll bars behind the backseat, a backup camera, and front and rear parking sensors.\n\nA $1,900 Driver Assistance Package includes a blind spot monitoring system, lane departure warning and additional cameras. Night vision with pedestrian detection costs $2,600.\n\nFor a full list of safety features, check out the Features & Specs page.

The M6 convertible’s V-8 makes massive power, but the car’s size and weight put it at odds with the expectations of driving enthusiasts who are familiar with other M models. For $23,000 more than the related 650i convertible — which is no performance slouch — the M6 convertible needs to move the needle more than it does.\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe M6 is BMW’s high-performance version of its 6 Series sports car. It has more aggressive, M-specific styling cues and is powered by a turbocharged V-8 engine that’s rated at 560 horsepower. The M6 is available as a coupe, soft-top convertible or as a coupelike four-door, dubbed Gran Coupe. The M6 competes with the Porsche 911, Audi R8 and Jaguar XKR.\n\n\n(Skip to details on the: M6 Gran Coupe)\nNew for 2014\n\nA traditional six-speed manual transmission is now available as a no-cost option, and the transmission includes a downshift-rev-matching feature. A seven-speed dual-clutch transmission with steering-wheel shift paddles and a launch-control function is still available.\n\nLarge carbon-ceramic brake rotors with gold-painted calipers are also optional. The brakes shave nearly 43 pounds from the M6’s curb weight, and the system quickly dissipates heat, according to BMW.\n\nAll M6s get an updated version of BMW’s iDrive controller system that brings revised graphics, new menu interfaces, upgraded navigation and a dictation service for composing short messages.\nExterior Highlights\n\nM6 gets an aggressive lower front bumper, revised rear bumper and quad exhaust tips\nStandard 19-inch light-alloy wheels; 20-inch light-alloy wheels available\nLightweight carbon fiber roof lowers coupe’s center of gravity\nTwin-kidney grille has black slats\nM-style appliques in the front fenders\nAdaptive xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights with LED accents\nAvailable adaptive LED headlights\nConvertible’s soft-top takes 19 seconds to open, 24 seconds to close, according to BMW\nSoft-top can be operated at speeds up to 25 mph\n\nInterior Highlights\n\nDriver-centric dashboard layout with 10.2-inch screen, which serves as the display for the iDrive system\nMerino leather upholstery\nCarbon fiber trim\nM6 lettering on the doorsills\nTwo customizable M Drive buttons on the steering wheel for vehicle settings\nM Drive can alter the characteristics of the engine, steering and stability system, among others\nAvailable head-up display\nAvailable Bang & Olufsen premium stereo\n\nUnder the Hood\n\n560-hp, twin-turbo 4.4-liter V-8 engine that makes 500 pounds-feet of torque\nSix-speed manual or seven-speed dual-clutch transmission\nMaximum turbo boost pressure is 21.7 pounds per square inch\nFuel-saving stop-start engine technology\nElectronically controlled limited-slip Active M Differential\nAdaptive dampers and adjustable power-steering assistance\nTop speed electronically limited to 155 mph\n\nSafety Features\n\nAntilock brakes\nElectronic stability system with deactivation setting\nSide-impact airbags\nSide curtain airbags (coupe, Gran Coupe)\nPop-up aluminum roll bars behind rear head restraints (convertible)\n\nM6 Gran Coupe\nThe Gran Coupe body style is equipped similarly to the other M6 versions. The biggest differences are in the body style itself and the resulting interior space. From bumper to bumper, the Gran Coupe is 4.4 inches longer than the M6 coupe and 4.1 inches longer than the 5 Series sedan. The front seat dimensions are essentially the same as the coupe’s, but the Gran Coupe boasts a roomier backseat with three rather than two positions.\n\n\n35.3 inches of legroom versus the coupe’s 30.5 inches\n37 inches of headroom versus 35.8 inches in the coupe\nThe Gran Coupe shares the coupe’s 16.2-cubic-foot trunk, which is 2.2 cubic feet larger than the 5 Series sedan’s trunk\n\nBack to top",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nSubtle updates grace the 2016 BMW 6 Series, which, typical of BMW, still comes in all manner of styles. You can get a 6 Series coupe, convertible or four-door Gran Coupe. Three engines pair with rear- or all-wheel drive and two automatic transmissions. Top among them is the high- performance M6 model, which can still come with a manual transmission to please the sports-car traditionalists.\n\nExteriorBMW’s twin-kidney grilles have nine bars apiece on the 640i and 650i, down from the current 10, while the M6 gets its own twin grilles with six pairs of bars apiece. All cars have new scalloped cutouts on the headlights’ inboard sides; adaptive LED lights are standard. The largest visual change comes in the lower bumper, where the opening now expands at its outer edges like on the 4 Series. LED fog lights cap the flared edges, with unique surrounding trim on the 6 Series convertible versus the coupe and Gran Coupe.\n\nAn M Sport Edition returns with 20-inch alloy wheels and some exterior modifications. The M6 has more aggressive bumpers with three separate openings. It’s similar to the 2012-2015 M6, which makes the 2016 M6 harder to tell apart. A carbon-fiber roof comes on the M6 coupe and Gran Coupe.\n\nIn back, six-cylinder models also have larger tailpipe openings. The Gran Coupe returns with four doors and a coupe-like profile. All models have reshaped side mirrors, which BMW says are more aerodynamic.\n\nInteriorAs before, the 6 Series’ interior features a sweeping dashboard contour that stretches from the passenger side down to the center console; the entire dash can come wrapped in leather, with an open-pore finish if specified. A semi-floating screen perches above the center air vents. Both the coupe and convertible seat four occupants; the Gran Coupe seats five.\n\nA navigation system and heated front seats with power adjusters and memory settings are standard across all 6 Series models. The leather upholstery in the convertible has a reflective treatment that reduces the heat given off during sunny days. The Gran Coupe’s backseat has optional seat heaters and side-window sunshades.\n\nBMW’s familiar iDrive system carries a touchpad atop the knob controller. Premium audio options include Harman Kardon or Bang & Olufsen stereos.\n\nUnder the HoodEngines carry over with a 315-horsepower, turbocharged six-cylinder engine in the 640i and a 445 -hp, turbo V-8 in the 650i. Both engines drive the rear wheels through an eight-speed automatic transmission. BMW says its optional xDrive all-wheel-drive system improves acceleration, with the 650i xDrive coupe and Gran Coupe hitting 60 mph in 4.3 seconds. A new exhaust on the 640i, meanwhile, makes for a more aggressive sound. Drivers can adjust it through BMW’s Driving Experience Control system, which changes the exhaust note among other systems to various comfort-, efficiency- or sport-oriented settings.\n\nOptional suspension setups include adaptive shock absorbers, as well as an active suspension that counters body roll in real time. Other systems include rear-wheel steering, which BMW says aids steering response and reduces the turning circle.\n\nThe M6 employs a turbocharged V-8 that’s good for 560 hp. It drives the rear wheels through a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission or a six-speed manual. The M6 model is available in all three body styles. A standard active rear differential routes power proactively between the rear wheels. High-performance carbon-ceramic brakes are optional.\n\nSafetyA night-vision camera system is available; so is lane-departure warning and adaptive cruise control with full-stop capabilities, pedestrian warning capabilities and auto-braking forward collision warning.",

      "expert_review": "The problem is not with the BMW M6, the Bavarian carmaker’s 500-horsepower, 10-cylinder, seven-speed stupendo-coupe. The problem is the world around it. It’s just too small. Even here in Los Angeles, America’s biggest concrete playground and in places a free-fire zone of automotive misdeed, no off-ramp is long enough, no highway straight enough, no parking lot half so empty as to wring out half this car’s scale-pegging potential. The M6 — a havoc-minded version of the company’s 6-series coupe/convertible, built by BMW’s Motorsport (“M”) division — requires a much larger planet, and we, alas, are fresh out of those.\n\nThe M division is, of course, in the business of full-clip overkill, making fast cars quite a bit and unnecessarily faster, so it’s not really a surprise that the M6 capacities are so thoroughly rank and audacious — 0-60 mph in about 4.1 seconds (according to Car and Driver), 100 mph in nine seconds and a putative top speed in the neighborhood of 190 mph. Welcome to your $100,000 sideways tornado.\n\nThe trouble for me is that to enjoy the M6 you have to flog it like you’re Captain Bligh in mid-mood swing. There is perhaps no modern car more allergic to gentle-throttle, stop-and-go driving than the M6, except maybe the M5, the sedan version.\n\nThe key issue is what BMW drolly refers to as the transmission: the seven-speed sequential manual gearbox (SMG). These devices are intended to strike a compromise between an automatic tranny that tends to sap torque (although Porsche’s new 911 puts the lie to that) and the crisp, authoritative, driver-involved manual gearbox operated with a shifter and clutch. Lots of cars, including Ferrari and Lamborghini, have these race-derived, paddle-shifter gearboxes. None is quite so balky, reluctant and aggravating as the SMG.\n\nIf you push the M6’s beautiful center-console shifter into “D” for Drive, all is well until you come to the automated first-second shift; then the computer disengages the gear, the throttle goes down to idle, the digital clutch considers its options a moment before reengaging in second gear and ordering the throttle back into action. This process takes, approximately, an eternity, and when the gear reengages, the car lurches like it’s sucked up a bit of bad gas. There is, in fact, a scalar controller on the console with which you can adjust the aggressiveness of the gearshift, but there is no way to smooth out these gear transitions except by feathering the throttle yourself. Otherwise, the car is constantly hitching and falling off throttle, gathering itself back up and surging. Life as an automotive yo-yo. (DIY’ers can change gears manually either by the gated shifter or the paddle shifters.)\n\nNo, I take that back. The one way you can enjoy this car is if you forget about the automatic mode and use the paddle shifters behind the steering column, as God and Hans Stuck intended. Even then, gear changes at routine speeds are scandalously clunky.\n\n(It’s not like BMW to admit error — “Yah, iDrive verks perfectly. You must learn zu operate ess!” — but the company will offer an automatic transmission for the M6 and M5 model next year.)\n\nAll the M6’s orneriness gradually dissipates then disappears the harder you drive the car. Push the “Power” button — this changes the engine mapping and various other functions to gain access to 100 more hp, for a maximum of 500 hp — and depress the M button on the steering wheel (which puts a sports spiff on both throttle and steering behavior). Dial in the adjustable suspension to its stiffest setting and go to work.\n\nSuddenly, the computer logic all comes into focus. Now the car starts to feel its own pulse — honestly, the sensation is of riding a fast horse just as it breaks from an awkward canter to gallop. The upshifts begin to blend together in one seamless, elastic yank of acceleration; the throttle-blipping downshifts, coming bang-bang-bang under hard braking, are just about perfect. Drive it like you stole it, and the M6 is sensational, the mortal sin of transportation.\n\nMuch the same applies for the car’s suspension. Rigged with strut-based front suspension and four-links in the rear, the car has a pretty stiff ride, even if the suspension is set on Comfort. The wheel travel is short and under immense tension, which gives the car a choppy, head-tossing ride.\n\nPush the car, though, and the dynamic forces start to come into alignment with the suspension. The ride, formerly frantic, goes all velvety. The spring stiffness that makes the car judder and pound at slow speeds suddenly makes sense as cornering forces build. Body roll is practically nil. The M6 plants its huge, 19-inch SportConti tires and corners like it’s on the Planet Velcro.\n\nThis is a big, masculine car, and while it’s downright majestic on long, sweeping turns, it starts to feel overly large as corners tighten up, much less rapier than cudgel. After all, we’re talking about a 2-ton automobile with only two usable seats and a very intimate, almost cramped, cabin (great trunk, though). The steering feel, through the thick-sectioned wheel, is precise and quick but surprisingly numb — I long for the thin-sectioned steering wheels and vivid, communicative feel of an old E36 BMW. There’s nothing remotely lively or toss-able about the M6. This is autobahn field artillery. You can’t argue with the brakes, though: heroic cross-drilled rotors so big they can be seen from space.\n\nIt’s fair to assume that, when it comes to fast cars, BMW knows what it’s doing; which is to say, everything about the car is deliberate. Consider the engine: This V10, 40-valve, high-compression (12.0:1), all-alloy magical mystery mill is equipped with, count-em, 10 throttles, one for each cylinder, and BMW’s stepless variable valve timing, plus every engine-control computer available west of the Urals. All that means is that the engineers could have dialed in pretty much any character they want into the engine — they could probably get it to whistle “Oh! Susanna” if they desired. They certainly could have put the power lower in the rev band. Instead, they gave the motor a peak horsepower output at 7,750 rpm — that’s Honda Civic Si range. Meanwhile, peak torque of 383 pound-feet comes along at an ionospheric 6,100 rpm.\n\nWhich means that the car really isn’t at full barking effect until you let it off the chain, and then, well, hide the cats.\n\nYou can’t say you weren’t warned. Just look at it. The M6 has a dark, glamorous look to it — call it upscale Sith lord — thanks to its malevolently low front spoiler, sills and rear apron/diffuser, from which the stainless-steel quad exhausts emerge. The roof is a glossy weave of carbon fiber; the fenders are composite. There is nothing trivial about the car’s presence on the street.\n\nThe M6 is to simple driving what “Bohemian Rhapsody” is to a Shaker hymn, what dynamite is to microsurgery, what Mt. Vesuvius is to a chin pimple. Excessive, by definition. Beautiful on the outside, replete with luxo-technology on the inside, and thoroughly overqualified for the Brentwood grand prix, it’s a car that delivers everything but a place to drive it.\n\n2007 BMW M6\n\nBase price: $99,795\n\nPrice, as tested: $106,390\n\nPowertrain: 5-liter, 40-valve, DOHC V10 with variable-valve timing; seven-speed sequential manual gearbox with automatic mode; rear-wheel drive.\n\nHorsepower: 500 at 7,750 rpm\n\nTorque: 383 pound-feet at 6,100 rpm\n\nCurb weight: 3,908 pounds\n\n0-60 mph: 4.1 seconds*\n\nWheelbase: 109.5 inches\n\nOverall length: 191.8 inches\n\nEPA fuel economy: 12 miles per gallon city, 18 mpg highway\n\nFinal thoughts: Mal der Mehr\n\n*Car and Driver",

      "expert_review": "NEW YORK — The 2008 BMW M6 convertible invites a swift departure from reality. It is an expensive escape pod bereft of practical value, generally lacking in common sense.\nIt can be enjoyed only through a willing suspension of disbelief, most often achievable with the assistance of wealth but difficult to obtain or sustain on a working stiff’s salary.\nConsider the price.\nWithout options, the M6 convertible starts at $106,100. (The phrase “without options” assumes knowledge that the M6 itself is an option.) Add-ons such as a heated steering wheel, black Merino leather seats, and an onboard navigation system can boost the price $4,000 or more. Standard equipment includes an additional $3,000 in federal gas-guzzler taxes.\nThat’s because the M6 gets considerably less than 22.5 miles per gallon on the highway, below which the government begins taxing cars for excess fuel consumption. It’s a simple formula — the poorer the fuel economy, the higher the tax.\nThe rear-wheel-drive M6 convertible, with its 5-liter, 500-horsepower, V-10 engine, sucks premium fuel at a rate that translates to 11 miles per gallon in the city and 17 miles per gallon on the highway, and it does that going at legally posted speeds. At extra-legal speeds, the driver might as well knock a hole in the fuel tank, it drains so fast.\nI know. Anyone who knows anything about BMW should not be upset about any of this. BMW is a legendary performance car company, maker of the world’s “ultimate driving machines.” People don’t buy BMW for economy or fuel efficiency. They buy for power, speed and prestige. They want to make a statement.\nI get it. But what bugs me about the M6 and other exotic cars is that the statement they make often amounts to a rolling contradiction. They are fast cars in a world slowly running out of the petroleum to propel them. The faster they go, the less they make sense.\nThe designers of the M6 are aware of this irony. The car can leap from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 4.5 seconds — even faster, according to some test-drive accounts. But it flashes a warning, dramatically displayed on the windshield via an optional head-up system, and sounds an alarm the moment the speedometer detects movement above 65 miles per hour.\n“Speed Limit Exceeded,” the red warning message says. It is accompanied by a gold circle with the similarly colored word “LIMIT” written inside in all caps.\nIt’s a lawyer’s gimmick, implemented to give BMW plausible deniability in anticipation of someone somewhere having the gumption to accuse the company of encouraging reckless driving. It is the moral equivalent of the “drink responsibly” tagline usually found at the end of beer commercials aired during professional football games.\nYou can always drink more, although you shouldn’t, especially if you are driving. In the M6, you certainly can go faster — putting its seven-speed transmission in either automatic or manual mode.\nManual mode is best. It has a higher fun factor. The car launches itself with something approaching orgasmic joy.\nBut it’s an expensive treat. Filling the M6’s 18.5-gallon tank for the 300-mile drive here from Northern Virginia cost $93.11. I made it to my daughter’s East Side garage with barely a quarter tank of fuel remaining.\nIt was a fun romp, enjoyed without the unpleasantness of another speeding ticket — frightfully easy to come by on Maryland’s stretch of Interstate 95 and the New Jersey Turnpike.\nBut I found my thrill and had my fill. With apologies to musician Fats Domino, a fellow New Orleans native, I’m ready to abandon the fantasy of this particular Blueberry Hill and journey back home at a more moderate pace.\nThe M6 is a wild car. But in the future, if BMW or any other car company wants to impress me, show me one that goes from 0 to 60 miles per hour in four seconds and gets 60 miles per gallon. I’d take it without leather seats.\nON WHEELS WITH WARREN BROWN Listen from noon to 1 p.m. Tuesdays on WMET World Radio (1160 AM) or http://www.wmet1160.com.",
