      "expert_review": "Even grownups need toys, which is why BMW builds cars, such as the 325is coupe, and rockets, such as the high-performance M3 makeover of the 325is intoa two-door missile.\n\nBMW last produced an M3 performance version of the 3 series in 1991. At that time it shipped coupes off the assembly line to its Motorsport subsidiary, which undertook the power transfusion, though power at the time meant a beefed up 4-cylinder engine.\n\nToday BMW does the conversion work on the assembly line, and along with thefirst M3 in four years comes the first 6-cylinder engine in the M3. And what you have is a $35,800 toy.\n\nThe ’95 M3 is swift, with a 0- to 60-mile-per-hour reading of about 6 seconds from its 3-liter, 240-horsepower, 24-valve, inline 6-cylinder engine. A smooth shifting 5-speed helps coax every ounce of energy out of the powerplant. Anti-lock brakes on all four wheels bring the power under control when needed, but if you get a tad aggressive or someone isn’t paying attention, a pair of air bags cushion you from impact.\n\nIn other words, the M3 is a rather complete package-power and safety wrapped in a $35,800 sticker. While $35,800 is one heck of a package to some, those who dabble in Bimmers see it as a blue-light special. There are reports of buyers waiting in line for the couple of M3’s dealers get each month.\n\nThough the M3 may be a toy for the Bimmer bunch, we test drove one purely in the interest of science. Treated it as a job, part of the daily 9 to 5 grind. Let nothing stand in the way of research.\n\nWe must admit, however, that science can be fun. Along about second gear, you keep one eye on the road, the other in the rearview mirror watching headlights grow smaller.\n\nThe 3-liter has a bit of a kick to it, yet the fuel-economy rating is 19 miles per gallon city/27 m.p.g. highway, so you don’t have to spend all of your playtime at the pump.\n\nWhile starting life as a 325is coupe, a few concessions were made to the added performance. The M3 has larger brakes and recalibrated ABS, along with alimited slip differential, to handle the power. To ease parking and low-speed maneuvers, variable assist and variable ratio power steering was added. Windshield wiper speed even varies based on vehicle speed.\n\nThe M3 is smooth and relatively quiet without any need for a rumble-tuned exhaust for performance sound effects. (Who would hear it anyway from 25 car lengths away?)\n\nYet, the M3 does have a few drawbacks. The rear seat is a decoration added to keep insurance companies from categorizing it as a two seater at higher rates. And though the 5-speed is smooth, there is no automatic-at least not for now. BMW, however, said it is considering adding one soon. As long as spring, summer and fall bring road repairs and debilitated traffic, there willbe a need for an automatic.\n\nThe other gripe is a personal one-and the same complaint we’ve had with Bimmers for years-the seats are s tiff. If you’re traveling the autobahn at 135m.p.h. for 50 miles, you have other things demanding your attention than the amount of foam padding tickling your tush. If you’re traveling the Kennedy Repairway at rush hour, it doesn’t take seven miles to realize the back is getting stiff, the butt a bit burdened.\n\n“No pain, no gain” doesn’t have to apply to car seats. And until the U.S. government builds a no-speed limit autobahn joining the coasts, there will be people who would appreciate a little less firmness in the bucket they’re seated on.\n\nStandard equipment in the M3 includes stainless-steel exhaust, a special aerodynamics decor package from front air dam to rear spoiler with ground effects rocker panels, air conditioning, dual power and heated sideview mirrors, heated driver’s door lock that activates when the handle is lifted and windshield washer jets, power windows, power locks, velour carpets, tintedglass, outside termperature display with a freeze warn ing alert for icy conditions, rear window defroster, AM/FM stereo with cassette, split fold-downrear seats and drop-down tool kit in the trunklid.\n\nIn an impact, the doors automatically unlock, interior lights switch on andhazard flashers activate. If you need to change a flat tire, there’s even a rechargeable flashlight in the glovebox.\n\nOur test car added the cruise control/fog lights package at $455 and the power electric sunroof at $1,120, which is a great feature to have to enjoy the scenery and circulate fresh air through the cabin, but at $1,100 seems more than a tad overpriced.\n\nWith a $470 freight charge, the car stickered at $37,845.\n\nThe orignial M3 was offered in 1988-’91 and was powered by a 2.3-liter, 4. The ’95 M3 is the first to offer a 6.\n\nWhile the M3 is an enthusiast’s car and the coming BMW roadster due in the fall of 1995 as a 1996 model is also built off the 3-series platform, BMW insists the intent of the M3 is not to build early excitement for the roadster.\n\n“No relation between the two,” BMW spokesman Rob Mitchell said.\n\nOnly 2,000 M3s will be shipped to the U.S. this calendar year, another 2,500 in 1995.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nWitness the new M3 sedan and its M4 coupe sibling, which lop off two cylinders but add a whole heap of turbocharging. It had to happen, didn’t it? Automakers — particularly the Germans — are swapping cylinders for turbos like displacement is the plague. The latest iterations of the Audi S8 and BMW M5 have dropped V-10s for turbo V-8s; even Mercedes-Benz downsized most of its AMG V-8s and added turbos.\n\nAnd so it goes with the M3 and M4, which drop the outgoing M3’s 4.0-liter V-8 for a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six. (The M4 replaces the prior-gen M3 coupe, much as the 4 Series replaces the prior 3 Series coupe.) Overall power climbs, however, with the turbo six making 425 horsepower versus the last M3’s 414 hp. The M3 takes on Mercedes-Benz’s C63 AMG and, if Lexus’ latest teaser is any indication, an IS-F version of the new IS 250/350. Cadillac’s rumored ATS-V is another competitor. The M4, meanwhile, takes on the likes of Mercedes’ C63 AMG coupe, Audi’s RS 5 and perhaps Jaguar’s forthcoming F-Type coupe.ExteriorWhereas any sports-car maker claims development time at Germany’s Nürburgring circuit, BMW says it put in “thousands of laps” on the famed track. (Take that, auto industry!) BMW says the M3 and M4 use lots of carbon fiber-reinforced plastic, which we’ve seen extensively on the automaker’s new i8 sports car. Both the M3 and M4 have carbon-fiber roofs.\n\nBoth cars also have reworked bumpers with larger air intakes and frontal air curtains to redirect airflow. The M3 gets a slight trunk lid spoiler, while the M4’s deck lid juts up enough to do the job without a dedicated spoiler. Like in past M cars, the side mirrors have twin supports, though the upper one is fake. LED headlights are optional.InteriorThe cars’ cabins mirror the 4 Series and 3 Series interiors with the addition of M-specific cues like badging, a sportier steering wheel, sport seats, plenty of carbon fiber trim and a unique instrument cluster.\n\nFor the controls, a 6.5-inch tabletlike screen is mounted on dashboard; it shows stereo and vehicle information. BMW says the cars use a new generation of the brand’s navigation system with “extra capability,” clearer graphics and 3-D map elements.\n\nUnder the HoodOverall power comes to 425 hp from 5,500 to 7,300 rpm and 406 pounds-feet of torque at just 1,850 rpm. That’s up from the last M3’s 414 hp at a sky-high 8,300 rpm and 295 pounds-feet of torque at 3,900 rpm. BMW says weight drops some 175 pounds versus the M3 coupe, whose 3,704-pound curb weight already outdid its class – 112 and 308 pounds lighter, respectively, than the 2014 Mercedes-Benz C63 AMG and Audi RS 5 coupes. Both competitors employ normally aspirated V-8s, however, and future versions could drop a couple cylinders and their attendant ballast. BMW has a considerable lead, but only for now.\n\nAdd it all up and BMW says the M3 and M4 sprint to 60 mph in 3.9 seconds with a twin-clutch, seven-speed automatic or 4.1 seconds with a six-speed manual, which can now match revs like in the M5. That’s expletive-inducing quickness, and it means the new M3 and M4 should leap past its predecessor (4.5 to 4.7 seconds for the 2012 M3 coupe, depending on transmission). It should also outrun the C63 AMG (4.4 seconds) and Audi RS 5 (4.5 seconds). (All times are from each car’s respective automaker.)\n\nThanks to the displacement decrease, the M3 and M4 reduce fuel consumption by 25 percent versus the (pretty inefficient) M3, BMW says.Safety FeaturesA head-up display is optional, as is a front-collision warning system and Active Driving Assistant, which warns the driver of an impending collision with a pedestrian.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Even more capable than before, the new M3 is a supercar disguised as a sedan — but it’s the disguise itself that might just be a deal breaker.\n\nVersus the competition: The M3’s adjustability sets it apart from competitors like the Mercedes-AMG C63 and the Alfa Romeo Giulia Quadrifoglio; it can be a calm around-town cruiser or the ultimate track monster with the push of a few buttons.\n\nThe BMW M3 is one of those iconic sports machines that creates strong feelings among enthusiasts. Is the new one as good as the old one? Can all its technology make up for the extra weight it lugs around? Has it become too expensive, too unattainable, too electronic?\n\nThere’s plenty of debate in the car-enthusiast world, but something that hasn’t generally been an issue for the BMW M3 before is its looks — until now: Is it too ugly to be seriously considered? We don’t normally discuss how a vehicle looks, as taste in design is largely subjective; one person’s hideous is another person’s appealing. But if our anecdotal discussions with current M3 sedan and M4 coupe owners are any indication, the M3’s new styling may just impact its viability for a lot of buyers. Can the M3’s performance and other abilities overcome its questionable looks?\n\nRelated: Quicker 2022 BMW M3, M4 Competitions With AWD Priced Under $80,000\n\nThe Beav — Uh, Elephant in the Room\n\nOK, we should just get this out of the way: BMW’s new buck-toothed styling is awful. This is a worse transgression than the “Bangle butt” of the 2002 BMW 7 Series. The best anyone seems able to muster about the odd grille treatment is, “It doesn’t look too bad.” That’s a damned far cry from “Wow, that’s gorgeous.”\n\nBut it isn’t just the grille that’s offensive. Look down the M3’s body side and you’ll notice the fenders have been flared to cover its wider wheels and tires. Then you’ll notice the door skins have not been widened to match the fenders, which becomes awkward where the rear doors meet the rear quarter panels. This is BMW cheapening out on the upgrade from 3 Series to M3 by not also modifying the door skins in order to save a couple bucks. The result looks half-done and amateurish — a decidedly disappointing visual update that takes away a significant portion of the M3’s appeal.\n\nA good friend of mine owned a 2015 M4 coupe and was thinking of replacing it with this latest-generation M3/M4, but as he put it, “To spend as much as they want for the new car, I have to love it. And looking at it … I just don’t love it.” One wonders how many other longtime BMW owners will look at this latest generation of M3 and make the same choice to not re-up their membership in the Bimmer club.\n\nIf You Can Get Past the Looks …\n\nThe driver’s seat is where the new M3 makes its strongest case for overlooking the fact that it looks like the lovechild of SpongeBob SquarePants and a garden vole. And that case is indeed strong; the M3 drives as well as it ever has, with abilities unmatched by plenty of super-expensive ultra-sports-cars — all while disguising itself as a compact sports sedan.\n\nIt starts with one of the sweetest gasoline powertrains ever put on four wheels: BMW’s TwinPower turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder engine, which pumps out 503 horsepower and 479 pounds-feet of torque in the Competition trim. That’s a bit more than in the standard M3, where the engine produces “only” 473 hp and 406 pounds-feet of torque. I drove a Competition trim, which can be had only with an eight-speed automatic transmission; if you want a stick shift, there’s a six-speed manual available, but it can’t be had with the Competition variant. I drove a rear-wheel-drive M3, but, for the first time, all-wheel drive is set to be available any moment now.\n\nI didn’t even mind that my test car was an automatic, as its engine and transmission combination is world-beating. The two are exceptionally well matched, and you can fine-tune how it performs by selecting one of six progressively sportier transmission modes — three automatic and three manual. I rarely used the manual function for shifting gears; I felt no need to second-guess what the transmission was doing quite well on its own, and the idea of manually shifting an automatic transmission with flappy paddle shifters strikes me as silly.\n\nAcceleration is explosive. Mash the go-pedal and hang on for dear life, as the thing rockets forward with serious force when asked to do so. The beauty of the M3 is that everything seems electronically adjustable, from throttle response and transmission shifts to steering feedback and brake pedal feel. You store your settings in the computer, then choose them via a couple of big red buttons right on the steering wheel.\n\n2021 BMW M3 Competition | Cars.com photo by Aaron Bragman\n\nWhen it comes to M Performance cars, I like to set up one of the two options as a cruiser (relaxed responses, softer suspension, easy-does-it gear changes) and the other as a brawler (aggressive steering, firmer suspension, hair-trigger throttle). For around-town driving, I keep it in cruiser mode and enjoy driving a comfortable, luxurious sports sedan. Then when I come upon a twisty bit of back road — or even a long highway on-ramp — brawler mode instantly ratchets the M3 up to far more aggressive, entertaining levels for as long as I want it to.\n\nAnd man, is it ever entertaining. Everything on the M3 Competition is track-ready, with electronically controlled brakes that feel far better than those in a standard 3 or 4 Series. Steering is quick and responsive, and the suspension is sophisticated — all of which combines to allow for driving well in excess of posted speed limits without even realizing you’re doing so. The only indication you’re going faster than you should is a rather surprising amount of road and wind noise that comes through to the cabin. Part of that was due to my test car’s super-sticky summer performance tires (on 19-inch wheels up front, 20-inchers in back), which transmit a lot of pavement noise partly thanks to the car’s aerodynamics.\n\nAn Evolutionary Interior\n\nWhile the latest M3’s exterior has changed considerably versus the outgoing model, the interior has seen a more evolutionary progression. It’s changed so slowly, in fact, that you might sit in the thing and wonder what’s even different. But that’s OK, as BMW’s latest interiors are quite nice — and they do not include an overly aggressive move toward touch-sensitive flat panel surfaces over traditional buttons, thank goodness.\n\nInstead of a sea of fingerprint-laden plastic inside the M3, you get actual high-quality buttons, knobs and controls, which convey the sense of luxury and precision one expects when paying this much for an automobile. My test car was done up in a stunning light and dark Silverstone/Black full Merino leather theme that perfectly matched its deep Tanzanite Blue Metallic exterior paint. The color scheme gave the M3 a sporty high-tech feel instead of the more traditional luxury-car feel you get in one of BMW’s Alpina sedans.\n\nThe M3’s sport seats might look too aggressively bolstered and uncomfortable, but they’re anything but; they proved to be supremely comfortable and supportive in all the right places, both in spirited driving and on longer highway voyages. They look the business, too, matching the M3’s sporting personality well.\n\nThe Competition trim I drove also featured an optional Executive Package, which includes niceties like a heated steering wheel, BMW’s Gesture Control for the multimedia system, a head-up display and more. The chunky steering wheel feels excellent in your hands, but the real standouts are the bright red M1 and M2 buttons on the spokes; they just beg you to punch them and let the M3 loose on the world.\n\nThere’s also a decent amount of space for front passengers, with plenty of legroom and headroom. The backseat, however, is another story. That said, the 3 Series has always felt tight in back; its legroom just isn’t great. Such is the trade-off one makes to enjoy the M3’s relatively compact overall dimensions. The rear seat is acceptable for short distances if front passengers don’t mind moving forward, but it’s not somewhere you’ll want to spend a lot of time. There’s a decent amount of trunk room, however, despite the car’s rather narrow cavity.\n\n2021 BMW M3 Competition | Cars.com photo by Aaron Bragman\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2021 BMW M3 and M4: M Stands for Manual\nWhich New Cars Have Manual Transmissions?\n2021 BMW M440i Convertible Review: Escape Artist\n2022 BMW 2 Series Coupe Gains Power, Loses Manual\nUp Close With the 2022 BMW i4: Your Bavarian Tesla Model 3 Alternative Is Here\nSupercar Performance, Luxury Car Prices\n\nThe M3’s overall performance is stunning. It’s an immensely satisfying driver’s car, with abilities and technology matching more exotic supercar coupes, but in a package that’s eminently more sensible as a daily driver. It’s easily track-capable off the showroom floor, and it can also be a satisfying backroad brawler or high-speed highway cruiser if its driver never wants to turn a wheel in anger on a race course.\n\nThe M3’s starting price is $70,895 (prices include destination), jumping up to $73,795 for the Competition trim. Bumping up to the Competition gets you the more powerful engine, a standard automatic transmission (the manual is sadly not available), larger wheels and tires, special seat belts and Shadowline exterior trim. My test vehicle had a few other options, including a $1,950 paint job and a special leather interior that ran $2,550. The Executive Package costs $3,000 and adds remote start, a heated steering wheel, a power opening trunk, adaptive LED headlights, wireless personal electronics charging and BMW’s gesture control for the latest iDrive multimedia system. The total for my deep blue test car came to $93,495.\n\nA hundred grand isn’t chump change for any kind of automotive purchase, but the sheer capability of the new M3 — and its ability to generate an amazingly entertaining driving experience on the road or the track — means it’s a screaming value compared with supercars that do the same things, usually with less interior space and functionality.\n\nThe M3 is 85% brilliant; it’s the 15% forward of the front fenders that’s the big problem, and it’s more than just a casual issue. If other buyers are as turned off by the new face as was my friend, it could spell trouble for BMW. If buyers are more interested in the car’s abilities than its appearance, however, the German luxury brand has nothing to worry about.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nBMW’s high-performance M3 features V-8 power and returns as a coupe or convertible. The four-seat M3 serves as the most powerful version of the 3 Series, with a 414-horsepower, 4.0-liter V-8 and aggressive styling that’s common to BMW’s M cars. Competition includes the Mercedes-Benz C63 AMG, Lexus IS-F and Chevrolet Corvette.\nNew for 2013\nThere are no changes for the 2013 model year.\nExterior\nExcept for the chassis, doors, trunk lid and fuel-filler cap, BMW says the M3 doesn’t have any other parts in common with the regular 3 Series. BMW calls the bulge on the M3’s aluminum hood a “powerdome.” It’s flanked by two air intake accents, one on each side of the bulge. Exterior features include:\n\n\nCarbon fiber roof to save weight and lower the center of gravity\nLarge openings in front for increased cooling\nXenon high-intensity-discharge headlights\nFlared fenders for wide wheels and tires\nQuad-tipped dual exhaust\nLightweight 18-inch wheels with performance tires\nAvailable 19-inch wheels\n\nInterior\nThe driver can choose from a multitude of suspension and engine preferences using M Drive, which controls the electronic stability system, steering response, ride comfort and throttle response. It varies the settings to make the M3 suited for either everyday driving or track duty. Interior features include:\n\n\nLeather-clad interior highlighted with a choice of carbon fiber or wood trim\nPush-button start\nRain-sensing wipers\nAvailable moonroof\nAvailable navigation system with iDrive\nAvailable iPod and USB adapter\n\nUnder the Hood\nWith 414 hp, the 4.0-liter V-8 revs up to 8,400 rpm. BMW’s double-vanos variable valve timing is used, as are individual throttle bodies for each cylinder that provide improved throttle response. Mechanical features include:\n\n\n414-hp, 4.0-liter V-8 with 295 pounds-feet of torque\nSix-speed manual transmission\nAvailable seven-speed dual-clutch automated manual with paddle shifters\nBMW says the M3 goes from zero to 62 mph in 4.8 seconds\nElectronically limited 155 mph top speed\n\nSafety\nAs you would expect from a performance car, large four-wheel disc brakes bring the M3 to a halt. Safety features include:\n\n\nAntilock brakes\nElectronic stability system\nSide-impact airbags\nSide curtain airbags (coupe)\nHead extensions for side-impact airbags (convertible)",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nBMW’s high-performance M3 features V-8 power and returns as a coupe or convertible. A sedan version will not be offered as BMW prepares to introduce a redesigned 3 Series sedan, due in the 2012 calendar year. The four-seat M3 serves as the most powerful version of the 3 Series, with a 414-horsepower, 4.0-liter V-8, a six-speed manual transmission and aggressive styling that’s common to BMW’s M cars. Competition includes the Mercedes-Benz C63 AMG, Lexus IS-F and Chevrolet Corvette.\n\nNew for 2012\nThe elimination of the sedan is the only major change for the M3 line.\n\nExterior\nExcept for the chassis, doors, trunk lid and fuel-filler cap, BMW says the M3 doesn’t have any other parts in common with the regular 3 Series. BMW calls the bulge on the M3’s aluminum hood a “powerdome.” It’s flanked by two air intake accents, one on each side of the bulge. Exterior features include:\n\n\nCarbon fiber roof to save weight and lower the center of gravity\nLarge openings in front for increased cooling\nXenon high-intensity-discharge headlights\nFlared fenders for wide wheels and tires\nQuad-tipped dual exhaust\nLightweight 18-inch wheels with performance tires\nAvailable 19-inch wheels\n\nInterior\nThe driver can choose from a multitude of suspension and engine preferences using MDrive, which controls the electronic stability system, steering response, ride comfort and throttle response. It varies the settings to make the M3 suited for either everyday driving or track duty. Interior features include:\n\n\nLeather-clad interior highlighted with a choice of carbon fiber or wood trim\nAvailable stereo options include an 825-watt, 16-speaker system\nPush-button start\nRain-sensing wipers\nAvailable moonroof\nAvailable navigation system with iDrive\nAvailable iPod and USB adapter\n\n\nUnder the Hood\nWith 414 hp, the 4.0-liter V-8 revs up to 8,400 rpm. BMW’s double-vanos variable valve timing is used, as are individual throttle bodies for each cylinder that provide improved throttle response. Mechanical features include:\n\n\n414-hp, 4.0-liter V-8 with 295 pounds-feet of torque\nSix-speed manual transmission\nAvailable seven-speed dual-clutch automated manual with paddle shifters\nBMW says the M3 goes from zero to 62 mph in 4.8 seconds\nElectronically limited 155 mph top speed\n\nSafety\nAs you would expect from a performance car, large four-wheel-disc brakes bring the M3 to a halt quickly. Safety features include:\n\n\nAntilock brakes\nElectronic stability system\nSide-impact airbags\nSide curtain airbags (coupe)\nHead extensions for side-impact airbags (convertible)",

      "expert_review": "The boomers are getting older and wider, and their kids are getting older and taller.\n\nConsequently, Mr. and Mrs. Boomley have been buying sedans instead of coupes.\n\nAs is the case whenever the Boomleys burp or stub their toes, cataclysmic socioeconomic changes follow. This time around, their shifting driving preferences have left sedan sales booming – and coupe sales dying.\n\nSomeone has already pulled a sheet over the stiffening body of the Toyota Camry coupe. The Ford Thunderbird and Mercury Cougar coupes will be interred at the end of the model year.\n\nThe Boomleys’ shift from two to four doors has even been felt at BMW M, which is the special BMW toy factory where speed-crazed Munich munchkins build the M3.\n\nThe M3 is a limited-production, hot-rodded version of the German automaker’s delightful 3 Series car. Until this year, this high performer had been available only as a coupe. But in 1997, it is also offered in the sedan form I tested.\n\nAs an additional concession to those softening Boomleys, the sedan is offered with an automatic transmission as well as a manual gearbox. The coupe maintains its performance purity by being available only with the ZF Type C five-speed manual. (Happily, the tester was fitted with the Type C, a city slicker whose moving parts seem to be made from an alloy of silk and steel.)\n\nThere really isn’t much aesthetic difference between the M3 coupe and sedan, because the 3 Series car is lovely in either two- or four-door form. And there isn’t a performance difference either, because both cars use the same go-fast hardware.\n\nAnd go-fast is what you get from this $39,380 cutie. The manual M3 goes from rest to 60 miles an hour in 5.9 seconds, which is serious sports car stuff.\n\nAlthough it has a top speed of 155 miles an hour in Europe, the M3 has been electronically limited to 137 in this country. I guess BMW just wants you to drive at a sensible speed.\n\nThe quick trip to the hairdresser this car affords is courtesy of an enlarged and tweaked version of the 3 Series inline six. The regular 3-car engine displaces 2.8 liters and develops 190 horsepower. The M3 variant has been bored and stroked to 3.2 liters, and puts out a rousing 240 Hohenzollerns.\n\n(Actually, the folks at BMW will hate me for calling horsepower by such a name. BMWs are made in Bavaria, and the Hohenzollern royals were Prussians. Bavarians like Prussians about as much as doctors like malpractice lawyers.)\n\nThe M3’s spirited engine is matched by brilliant suspension performance. The sedan stays flat and unflustered when you push it hard in a corner, and its grip is exceptionally tenacious. That bite doesn’t come as much of a surprise if you bother to check out the rubber before you go barreling into the turns. The tires are 17-inch, Z-rated numbers with widths of 225 millimeters up front (225/45ZRl7) and 245 in the back (245/40ZR17).\n\nA delightful aspect of the new M3 is the ride it affords. M3s of old really beat you up on rough pavement. This car doesn’t. Its suspension delivers the degree of athleticism BMW wants, and still affords a comfortable ride.\n\nThe pleasures of driving the M3 go beyond its athleticism, of course. There is a great deal of satisfaction to be taken from the sheer precision of this car’s design and execution.\n\nBut even wonderful cars usually have warts, and the M3 is no exception.\n\nThe warts in question here are aesthetic rather than functional, and might not be warts at all in the eyes of other beholders. But they sure are in mine.\n\nWart #1: The flared panels under the doors and the extended front spoiler. These are add-ons intended to make the M3 look hotter than the 328i sedan it is based on. I hate this kind of speed racer junk. It’s an afterthought that does violence to a car’s styling.\n\nWart #2: The bright yellow/brown upholstery in the test car. This was a color only a diaper could love.\n\nSPECS\nBase vehicle: Rear-wheel drive, 3.2-liter engine, five-speed manual transmission, four-wheel power disc brakes, anti-lock braking system, variable-assist power steering, traction control, sport suspension, 17-inch alloy wheels, P225/45ZR17 front tires, P245/40ZR17 rear tires, dual air bags, security system, climate control, cabin air filter, stereo/cassette, central locking, power windows, power mirrors.\n\nTest model: No extras.\n\nBase price: $39,380\n\nTest model: $39,950 (inc. shipping)\n\nEPA city rating: 20\n\nTest mileage: 21\n\nWarranty: Four years/50,000 miles bumper to bumper, roadside assistance, three years/36,000 miles scheduled maintenance.",

      "expert_review": "Chalk up the new BMW M3 to one of life’s truly unfair realities. Unless you live near an Autobahn, or they begin building a bridge over the Atlantic, you can’t really drive one.\n\nOh, you can tool around in stop-and-go traffic impressing your friends that the M3’s blast-of-gas power will zoom you from stoplight to stoplight. And occasionally, when a radar gun isn’t looking, you might be able to take an on-ramp at faster than posted speeds.\n\nBut don’t even think about stretching the M3’s legs, winding out its engine or making it scream. And how infuriating is that? Try 333 horsepower worth.\n\nM, thanks.\n\nThe dream of driving an M3 is that there’s all that potential car enthusiasts crave. The reality is, that’s all it is: Potential.\n\nPerformance nuts will gush, gearheads will gawk, and your neighborhood-friendly police officer will pull you over if you even think about edging into the power band of this two-door sports coupe. Careful: One hundred and three horsepower per cylinder will do that to you. So will a four-tailpipe exhaust system and a range of harmonics that sounds better than a German pipe organ on Oktoberfest weekend.\n\nIndeed, the Fatherland has done good.\n\nFirst delivered as a late 2001, and unchanged for 2002, the M3 is the performance version of BMW’s very popular, very successful 3-Series. Previous M3 models have been solid rides, but lacked the punch to deliver a truly gutsy ride against other muscular entries. At 240 horses, the old M3s were a nice bump up in the food chain – until a Corvette ate them for lunch.\n\nNow look who’s invited to dinner.\n\nThe new M3 is engineering prowess from every angle, but especially under the hood.\n\nSeated quietly in your driveway, it is an unassuming, sleek and smartly designed coupe with chrome M3 badging, fender flares, spoked wheels and scalloped headlights that flow into the rest of the body.\n\nRolled out of the driveway, it’s a demon.\n\nTurn the key and it rumbles to life, growling and buzzing. Hit the gas and things turn haywire. Under the hood, a robust, naturally aspirated, twin-cam, 3.2-liter, in-line six-cylinder engine busts out more power than a Jaguar XJ8 or a Porsche 911 Carrera. (Whew!)\n\nAnd it loves to spend time near an incredible 8,000 rpm – all delivered through a six-speed gearbox, its only transmission, with throws that are sharp, short and smooth.\n\nThis is no rush to revs, either. Maybe the greatest thing about the M3 is that it is not raw power from your right foot to the engine block. There is a broad torque band that means head-snapping fun from 20 mph or 120. And all of that power under the hood is tied to a trend-setting design underneath. With an all-independent sport suspension, four-wheel vented disc brakes and variable-assist steering, the M3 can be M-planted against a corner and still come out roaring. It handles with a surgeon’s precision and responsiveness that seems to be constantly asking for mor e. It even has an electronic stability program to shield inexpert drivers from making huge errors of judgment – or just in case your 16-year-old son accidentally gets the keys.\n\nLoaded up with an invoice of standard equipment, the M3 also includes side air bags, a head protection system and a tire-pressure monitoring system. There’s also a fair amount of room for rear-seat passengers, the front bucket seats will hug your sides and there’s a fun quotient that, in our estimation, breaks the meter.\n\nBut, again, practicality must be considered.\n\nEven if you could find room in city driving to park the M3 into sixth gear, it probably wouldn’t happen until 3 in the morning or on some interstate when you needed overdrive to save gas.\n\nAlso, a few passengers found the doors a bit heavy and, with a sloped roof and high front end, seating is tough for anyone under 5-foot-9. With ultra-low profile Michelin P225/45ZR-18 performance tires on the front and P225/40ZR-18s on the back t grips and sticks, especially in cornering, but does rattle a little over rough pavement. It’s (dare we say?) choppy.\n\nBut enough of that. This is a car that will bring tears to a purist’s eyes – incredible engine, sweet steering and a total hi-fi driving experience. At 65 mph.\n\nSo how much will all this frustration cost you?\n\nMore than you think.\n\nA breathtaking ride needs a sticker to match, right? The M3 doesn’t disappoint. With a $45,400 base, it ranks right up there with the high-performance models we all crave but only few can afford.\n\nThat’s not including a $1,100 leather package, a $645 destination charge and a $1,000 “gas-guzzler” tax, even though the M3 ranks right in there with other big-pedal, high-dollar rides at 16 mpg city/24 mpg highway.\n\nActually, for 45K I have a better idea. Start building that bridge to the Autobahn.\n\n2002 BMW M3 – SPECS\n\nRating: 3.5\n\nHigh gear: Incredible engine, ferocious low-end speed, smooth handling and a silky gearbox make this a purist’s dream, and not a bad resale. Looks don’t suffer either.\n\nLow gear: Low-profile tires can create a ride that’s a little choppy and lumpy over rough surfaces. A lack of power seats or standard CD player may raise some eyebrows for this price.\n\nVehicle type: Rear-wheel drive, front-engine, two-door, four-passenger sports coupe.\n\nStandard equipment: Six-speed manual transmission; dual front airbags; front side airbags; front side head-protection airbags; antilock 4-wheel ABS; air conditioning w/auto climate control; power, tilt steering; cruise control; heated, power mirrors; power door locks; remote keyless entry; AM/FM/cassette w/steering wheel controls; theft-deterrent system; fog lights; limited-slip differential; passenger-side mirror tilt-down back-up aid; automatic mirrors; outside temperature display; tire-pressure indicator; chrome alloy wheels.\n\nCompetition: Mercedes Benz CLK55 AMG, Chevrolet Corvette, Audi S6, Lexus IS 300\n\nEngine: 333 horsepower, 3.2-liter, DOHC 24-valve in-line six-cylinder\n\nTorque: 262 foot-lbs. @ 4,900 rpm\n\nWheelbase: 107.5 inches\n\nLength: 176.8 inches\n\nMPG rating: 16 mpg city/24 mpg highway\n\nManufactured: Germany\n\nWarranty: Basic warranty is four years/50,000 miles; rust perforation warranty is six years/unlimited miles; roadside assistance warranty is four years/50,000 miles; free scheduled maintenance is three years/36,000 miles.\n\nBase price: $45,400\n\nPrice as tested (includes options, destination and delivery charges): $49,195",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 BMW 3 Series?\n\nThe BMW 3 Series is a five-seat luxury sports sedan that competes with the Audi A4, Lexus IS and Mercedes-Benz C-Class. The 330i is powered by a 255-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, while the M340i gets a 382-hp, turbo 3.0-liter inline-six that works with a mild-hybrid system. Both engines team with an eight-speed automatic transmission, and rear- and all-wheel-drive models are offered. Plug-in hybrid 330e and high-performance M3 versions of the 3 Series are also available. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 BMW 3 Series? \n\nThe 3 Series’ exterior sees some subtle styling updates, and the cabin gets BMW’s Curved Display — a combination of a 12.3-inch digital instrument panel and a 14.9-inch touchscreen display. BMW says the displays have improved graphics and use the automaker’s latest operating system with improved Intelligent Personal Assistant functionality. \n\nWhat Features in the 2023 BMW 3 Series Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nPower moonroof\nLED headlights \n40/20/40-split, folding backseat\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nNavigation\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nRemote start\nHeated front and rear seats\nHeated steering wheel\nHarman Kardon premium stereo\nHead-up display\nBlind spot warning\nLane departure steering assist\nHands-free low-speed highway driving system\n​​Adaptive suspension\nShould I Buy the 2023 BMW 3 Series?\n\nIf you’re looking for a compact sports sedan that prioritizes performance, particularly in M340i or performance M3 form, the BMW 3 Series should be on your list. The 3 Series also offers good ride quality, and its interior boasts high-quality materials and upgraded tech. A lack of steering feel is a notable negative, though, and the 3 Series can get pricey with options.",

      "expert_review": "HIGH MARKS: GREAT WAY TO SPEND YOUR INHERITANCE\n\nBMW certainly took its sweet time importing the new M3, the performance version of the bread-and-butter 3-Series, but it was worth waiting for. Like all M3s before it, this model, which arrived as a late 2001 and is consequently unchanged for 2002, is a genuine wolf in sheep’s clothing.\n\nAlways quick, previous M3s have lacked the sheer horsepower to make them outright contenders with some of the more powerful V-8 entries, such as the Chevrolet Corvette. The mid-1990s M3 did fine with 240 horsepower, until it lined up beside a 300-horsepower ‘Vette.\n\nThe playing field has been leveled with the new M3. Though it still has an inline six-cylinder engine, it’s now pumping out 333 horsepower, delivered through a slick-shifting six-speed manual transmission. It’s still a bit below the 350-horsepower V-8 in the 2002 Corvette, but a drag race would be a lot closer now.\n\nThe M3 has never been about horsepower, though. It’s about an integrated package that will cheerfully deliver you through rush hour traffic to work each weekday, then entertain you with its downright astonishing backroads performance on weekends. It has a level of sophistication unmatched for the price, which, though not cheap, isn’t bad, considering how well M3s traditionally hold their value.\n\nThe test M3 started with a base price of $45,400, and crept up to a $53,195 bottom line, thanks to various options including an upgraded Harmon-Kardon sound system, Xenon headlamps, leather-trimmed upholstery and a glass moonroof. There was also a $1,000 “gas guzzler” fee, which did not seem appropriate as mileage is rated at a not-terrible 16 mpg in the city, 24 mpg on the highway. That’s premium fuel, of course.\n\nHelpful on that highway mileage is the six-speed manual transmission, something the M3 has long needed. Sixth gear is basically an overdrive, allowing the engine to lope along at highway speeds at a relatively low rpm.\n\nThough the M3 is based on the corporate 3-Series driver-friendly platform, you know you are in something different as soon as you climb in. The low-slung M3 is not that easy to get into and out of, and once behind the wheel, the very firm bucket seat grips you with plenty of lateral support.\n\nCrank it up, and the exhaust note doesn’t sound much different from the 225-horsepower 3.0-liter engine in the 330i, until you step hard on the gas pedal. Acceleration is linear and delivered without drama — you won’t know how fast you’re going until you glance at the speedometer.\n\nThough there’s plenty of power, the ultimate charm of the M3 is its handling prowess, on par with most any genuine sports car. The handsome spoked alloy wheels hold very large radials — P225/45ZR-17s on the front, P255/40ZR-18s on the rear. It isn’t hard to make a car handle well — just use a very stiff suspension and huge tires — but the challenge is making it handle well, and not ride like a buckboard. Th is new M3 has the best ride-handling combination BMW has produced, and unless you are on very rough pavement, your passenger will never know this isn’t a luxury car.\n\nI say “passenger,” because although the M3 has a rear seat, it isn’t particularly easy to get to, and isn’t particularly comfortable once you’re back there. For kids, it’ll be fine, but adults would prefer the sedan version of the 3-Series. Presently, there is no M3 sedan, though there was in the previous incarnation of the M3.\n\nBMW has done a superb job with styling, taking the not-so-svelte look of the 3-Series, and adding subtle touches such as fender flares and small chrome side grilles in front of the doors to identify the M3. Most civilians wouldn’t recognize it as anything but a 3-Series, but the True Believers will — they are the ones giving you the “thumbs up” on the tollway.\n\nThere are faster, flashier cars for the money, but that isn’t why BMW sells every M3 it can build. Those customers get th satisfaction not from being noticed, but from piloting an example of the best German automotive engineering has to offer.\n\nBase price: $45,400.\n\nPrice as tested: $53,195.\n\nEPA rating: 16 mpg city, 24 mpg highway.\n\nDetails: Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive sorts coupe powered by a 3.2-liter, 333-horsepower six-cylinder engine with a six-speed manual transmission.",

      "expert_review": "BMW’s latest infotainment tech, Operating System 8.5 (or iDrive 8.5, if you prefer), lands in the M3 for the 2025 model year, and other subtle updates will help keen observers distinguish the 2025 model from those that came before.\n\nRelated: 2025 BMW 3 Series Gets New Tech, Starts at $46,675\n\nAs it does in other BMWs, the new operating system means the brand’s Curved Display digital dashboard makes it into the M3; it melds a 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster with a 14.9-inch touchscreen under a single curved piece of glass that is angled toward the driver. Expanded voice commands now allow the driver hands-free control of secondary functions such as climate control.\n\nEvery 2025 M3 gets redesigned headlights, with fanglike vertically oriented daytime running lamps replacing the cupped horizontal units on previous models. A new flat-bottom steering wheel available wrapped in leather or simulated suede, optional brushed-aluminum trim and a newly available wheel design round out the updates for 2025.\n\nPowertrain Specs and MPG\n\nThe M3 news for the new model year isn’t just about pixels and diodes, it’s also about bytes. The twin-turbo 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder engine in the all-wheel-drive M3 Competition xDrive now makes 20 more horsepower than before. BMW attributes the gain to “optimized configuration of the engine management system,” which not only boosts output to 523 hp but also delivers peak torque across a wider range, from 2,750 rpm to 5,730. Peak power is delivered at 6,250 rpm and slingshots the xDrive M3 to 60 mph in a claimed 3.4 seconds.\n\nThe twin-turbo 3.0-liter inline-six in the base M3 makes the same 473 hp as it did for 2024 and is available exclusively with a six-speed manual transmission. BMW claims the base M3 needs 4.1 seconds to hit 60 mph. An eight-speed automatic backs the twin-turbo six in the rear-drive M3 Competition, which continues into 2025 with 503 hp and a 3.8-second 0-60 claim; the 523-hp M3 Competition xDrive, too, is available only with the eight-speed automatic.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2024 BMW M3 CS Sheds Weight, Gains More Power\n2024 BMW 3 Series Starts at $45,495, M3 at $76,995\nIs the 2021 BMW M3 a Good Car? 5 Things We Like and 4 We Don’t\nWhich New Cars Have Manual Transmissions?\nResearch the BMW M3\nAvailability and Pricing\n\nThe 2025 BMW M3 will begin production  inJuly.

      "expert_review": "It wasn’t exactly a dirt road; it was more like a wet clay road that I was driving along in a 2011 BMW M3 Coupe outside of Chelsea, my cousin Matt laughing beside me.\n\nInitially, I thought the mud wouldn’t have enough nerve to stick to the fenders of this $60,000 performance 3 Series. I was wrong.\n\nI also never thought the entire back end would wiggle like Jennifer Lopez at divorce court every time I shifted gears. I was wrong there, too.\n\nAs the 4-liter V-8 sang louder and louder, as the revs stacked higher and higher, I’d push in the clutch for the manual six-speed, change gears, gun it again and feel that little shimmy. And then watch the stability control light kick on for a second and feel the tires finally grab the road and launch us even faster.\n\nFour hundred and fourteen horsepower will do that for you. It also makes Matt, who typically drives a Ford Excursion to carry his litter of children, giggle at every gear change. The engine also produces 295 pound-feet of torque. (All that power, however, does come at the price of 14 mpg city and 20 mpg highway.)\n\nThese are not ideal driving conditions for one of the most complete performance cars available today.\n\nTypical BMW M3 drivers try not to race along country roads; they’re more accustomed to racetrack tarmacs and concrete highways. On these surfaces, the M3 is blistering fun. The steering is taut, but not too taut. The body is stiff but not too stiff. The suspension is aggressive, but not too aggressive. It’s the baby bear of performance — just right. The optional M Dynamic Damper Control allowed me to select the right driving mode (Sport) and have the car adjust to that.\n\nThe car’s performance only encourages you to drive harder, to drive faster, as it turns every corner into a challenge and every straightaway into a launch pad. Why not have a little fun?\n\nEven on slippery wet clay roads, the M3 seemed to know what to do even before I did.\n\nWith a 0-60 speed well under 5 seconds, the M3 would nearly instantaneously adjust to the poor conditions, straightening itself out and making me look like a much better driver than I really am.\n\nEven the massive four-wheel vacuum-assisted cross drilled compound disc brakes help you reel in this car a little later than most passengers would like.\n\nA high tech look\n\nJust walking up to the M3 will make you think a little faster. It’s sharply cut and the carbon fiber roof panel gives it a certain high-tech look that other cars just don’t have. But it’s more than just that. It’s the way the car’s metal is cut. Its edges are sharp; the hood’s double creases and power dome make it more pronounced. The A line is subtle but distinct, and there’s that beautiful sloping roof line. Even the fender vents that have a three-dimensional effect when the big doors are open add elegance.\n\nFrom every angle, the M3 demands the same respect as a loaded gun. If you handle it wrong, it might go off and hurt you.\n\nInside the cabin the M3 includes all of that M Series badging that owners want to see (or at least they want their passengers to see).\n\nThere’s the M instrument cluster with red needles to remind you how fast you’re going.\n\nThe racing seats are extremely comfortable and will hold you snuggly in place even through the tightest corners. And the cockpit is laid out with only one person in mind — the driver.\n\nAll of the luxury features you’d expect come with the M: Bluetooth, navigation, ambient lighting, brushed aluminum trim and rain-sensing windshield wipers (which came particularly handy on this particular day of driving).\n\nWhile there may be some downsides to this car, such as the barely usable second row and a trunk that certainly couldn’t carry all of Matt’s luggage, none of that seemed to matter.\n\nSteps up its game\n\nNo, we just continued to blister on down the road, swerving past potholes and incorrectly guessing where the apex of any particular turn really was on a dirt road.\n\nWhen we finally hit some blacktop, the M3 seemed to up its game for us, sticking tightly to the line I had planned through the corner, the steering wheel never moving an inch as I held it.\n\nMatt, holding one hand on the dash and the other gripping the door handle, appeared to be pushing at the imaginary brake he thought was on the passenger’s side. So I brought the car to a stop on the quiet road, just as the rain stopped.\n\nMaybe Matt should have a chance at trying out the real brake instead. So I opened my door and we switched seats. His evaluation was more like, “Wow,” as he clicked through the car’s gears, slowly gaining confidence.\n\nBy the time we had finished the return trip, he was a natural half-speed race car driver — matching revs on his downshifts, holding gears through their power curves, and leaving me reaching for that imaginary brake.\n\nOf course, don’t tell Matt.\n\nsburgess@detnews.com (313) 223-3217",

      "expert_review": "Picture a BMW Z3 roadster with a station wagon-like hatchback grafted onto its rear and you’ll get an idea about the radical looks of the 1999 BMW M coupe. But don’t groan and walk away – because we’re convinced the racy little coupe is the sports car for the new millennium.\n\nOur test car carried a $42,670 sticker and had only one option, a $300 power moonroof.\n\nShe: You know my dirty little secret – that my true passion is doll collecting, not car collecting. That’s why I’m so blown away by the BMW M coupe. I really like it. The minute you look at it, you know it’s like nothing else on the road.\n\nHe: Yeah, I can almost picture Barbie driving this. But seriously, some people we encountered were turned off by its looks. You’ll either love it or hate it.\n\nShe: I think a lot of people will be won over by the M coupe’s breathtaking interior. Our test car’s cabin was a dramatic brick red and black. And the attention to detail is telling, from the red-blue-and-purple topstitching on the inside of the leather-wrapped steering wheel to the industrial-looking rivets around the chrome-trimmed gauges.\n\nHe: The color scheme is a hallmark of BMW’s M division, which is made up mostly of gearheads and boy racers. And you can sure tell from driving the M coupe. My big concern is that you like it so much, you may decide to start collecting cars instead of dolls.\n\nShe: BMW makes a cheaper version of the hardtop – the Z3 coupe 2.8, which sells for only $36,000. But when you get right down to it, the M coupe is worth the extra $6,000. In fact, it-s so loaded with extras from air conditioning to power accessories and seats that the only options are a moonroof and an in-dash single-disc CD player.\n\nHe: I’m shocked to hear you say that, Mrs. Cheap, especially about a sports car. But I can also anticipate the first question that most enthusiasts are likely to ask – is it fast? It sure is. The M-division guys have tweaked the 3.2-liter six-cylinder engine to produce 240 horsepower. And they’ve hooked it up to a sweet five-speed manual gearbox. The combination is intoxicating. We’re talking serious speeding-ticket stuff here.\n\nShe: Intoxicating and speeding tickets aren’t words I’d put in a test drive. So I’ll remind you that BMW has paid attention to safety. The M coupe has side air bags and standard antilock brakes. It also comes with traction control and a limited-slip differential, both necessary in cold and wet weather, considering this is a rear-wheel-drive car with lots of power.\n\nHe: I can’t rave enough about the car’s variable-assist steering, which is razor sharp, and all-independent suspension, which is firm without being bone-jarringly stiff. You feel so totally in control, that also contributes to the feeling of stability and security. On the down side, you only get two seats. Come to think of it, that might be a plus.\n\nShe: Speaking of plus, if you shop in the hefty department, th is won’t be the car for you. Even our friend, the skinny personal trainer, squawked that the seats were too confining. On the other hand, it’s a great incentive for keeping your weight down.\n\nHe: And think of all that money you’re saving on food. It can go straight into the doll fund. I figure there’s room enough in the trunk for a couple of those big American Girl dolls, isn’t there?\n\nShe: More importantly, this is a sports car with a conscience. Look at the fuel-economy numbers – 19 mpg in the city and 26 on the highway. All that performance, and you can honestly tell people you-re driving an economy car.\n\nHe: So let’s tote things up. Brisk acceleration. Crisp handling. Supple ride. Eye-popping styling. Great safety and better-than-average gas mileage. What do you come up with?\n\nShe: A car that’s going to make Porsche owners wonder if they’ve made a wrong turn somewhere.",

      "expert_review": "The BMW M3’s starting prices — $55,400 for the sedan, $58,400 for the coupe and $67,050 for the convertible — might seem high for performance versions of BMW’s compact 3 Series. And that would be true if you couldn’t appreciate a car, with four seats and a trunk, that’s comfortable enough to drive daily yet capable of hitting the track and beating the tar out of any model in its class — and most other classes — in terms of overall performance and fun.\n\nNow in its 24th year overall and its 15th in the U.S., the BMW M3 is simply a phenomenal car that proves you really can have it all.\n\nFrom the first time I let out the clutch on our six-speed-manual test car, I was surprised — not by overwhelming thrust, but by a lack thereof. The world is a very different place, performance fans, when a V-8 engine is built to rev and a turbocharged inline-six-cylinder produces more low-end grunt. But that’s the story of BMW’s M3 and 335i. (See them compared here.)\n\nBMW M3 vs. 335i Engines\n\t2010\nM3 coupe\t2010\n335i coupe\t2011\n335i coupe\nType\t4.0-liter V-8\t3.0-liter I-6\t3.0-liter I-6\nInduction\tnormally aspirated\ttwin turbochargers\tsingle twin-scroll turbocharger\nHorsepower\n(@ rpm)\t414 @\n8,300\t300 @\n5,800\t300 @\n5,800\nTorque\n(lbs.-ft. @ rpm)\t295 @ 3,900\t300 @ 1,400\t300 @ 1,200-5,000\nRedline (rpm)\t8,400\t7,000\t7,000\n0-60 mph (manual/automatic, seconds)\t4.7/4.5\t5.3/5.5\t5.3/5.5\nEPA mpg (city/highway — combined)*\t14/20 – 16\t17/26 – 20\t17/26 – 20\n*MPG ratings are the same for manual and automatic.\nSource: BMW\n\nAs the table reflects, the more affordable 2010 335i coupe’s twin-turbo 3.0-liter inline-six produces more torque at considerably lower rpm than the 2010 M3’s 4.0-liter normally aspirated V-8. (The cars’ manual transmissions are geared the same, but the M3 has a 3.85 final drive ratio and the 335i’s is 3.08.) The M3 started its life modestly powered in 1986, and it hasn’t been about prodigious torque since it came to the U.S. in 1995, but the 335i we’ve come to know and love certainly has raised expectations, and it doesn’t end here. The 2011 335i, which goes on sale this spring, brings the torque peak on earlier and, according to BMW, holds it until 5,000 rpm.\n\nA V-8 Built to Rev\nThe M3’s power delivery isn’t a problem, it just requires an expectation adjustment. Once it gets revving, the engine fulfills expectations with 414 horsepower that will push you back in your seat — never more dramatically than when you downshift a couple gears and nail it when already in motion. The acceleration rate climbs with engine speed all the way to the redline, which is an impressive 8,400 rpm once the car has warmed up. The redline — literally, the red line on the tachometer — starts out lower and slowly climbs as the operating temperature increases. BMW estimates the zero to 60 mph time at 4.7 seconds with the stick shift. If you choose the seven-speed M Double Clutch Transmission for an additional $2,900, it’s 4.5 seconds.\n\nTypical of dual-clutch automated manuals, the M DCT shifts virtually instantaneously, providing the stated 0.2-second advantage over the stick. It has an automatic mode with your choice of five levels of responsiveness, and it can be shifted manually using the gear selector lever or shift paddles on the steering wheel. Despite the timed superiority, I can’t imagine why anyone would buy a driver’s car with this kind of transmission, even a well-executed one, when a traditional stick shift is available. If you’re in it to drive, freakin’ drive.\n\nThe M3 provides a full symphony of sounds: When clutching at lower speeds, there’s a faint rattle as the driveline unloads. You hear some overall drivetrain whirring in the cabin, and a throaty exhaust note is audible at lower engine speeds and becomes loud, but not obnoxious, at full revs. All good stuff, with the exception of the cacophony you hear when standing at the front of the car, with or without the hood open. Blame the direct fuel injection, which seems to afflict all engines and all manufacturers similarly. I have witnessed the future of high-efficiency engine design, and it is a clattering mess.\n\nThankfully, the injection noise doesn’t seem to penetrate the cabin, which gives the beneficial sounds a clear channel to the driver. In the M3, quiet would be a detriment. A good performance car is an extension of the driver, and you can’t achieve this without communication. When you’re driving the M3, you hear your engine’s speed and how hard it’s working, you sense the body’s yaw and you feel the steering angle through its terrific, thick-rimmed steering wheel.\n\nRide & Handling\nHandling remains BMW’s ace in the hole against the Audis and Mercedes-Benzes of the world, thanks in part to optimal balance and steering that’s unencumbered by drive hardware. Even with its larger engine, the M3 coupe’s front/rear weight distribution is 51.2/48.8, the same as the 335i coupe’s. It heads into turns with slight understeer that can be countered with the accelerator, providing excellent roadholding and control. Depending on conditions, though, you might find yourself a gear or two too high for the torque you need, so the wise driver will keep the engine on the boil before charging into a serpentine.\n\nI respect how far all-wheel-drive cars have come in their ability to manage understeer, and their adeptness at holding a line where some rear-wheel-drive cars struggle, but the M3 proves just how much grip and controllability a rear-drive car can offer. It does more than a novice driver expects and more than an experienced driver can believe, and it does so without sacrificing fun. I’ve bemoaned how cars have gotten heavier, including the 3 Series, and although the M3 coupe is 133 pounds heavier than the 335i coupe, it seldom felt overweight. The standard carbon fiber roof trims some pounds and lowers the center of gravity. The M3 feels grounded — wide in a good way — and light-footed when pushed hard. It moves in and out of turns with great poise, but where it shines most is when things get tricky.\n\nThe car gobbles up reducing-radius turns, off-camber and uneven surfaces, and abrupt elevation changes. Combine a few of these, and the M3 giggles on through, and so do you. When the car gets upset, it does so with plenty of warning. The 18-inch wheels and impressive Michelin Pilot Sport PS2 tires, rated 245/40ZR18, may be less sporty than the 19-inch option, but they provide relatively quick reflexes and give up traction gradually and controllably. It’s as if all the car’s systems were designed to work together … and they actually do.\n\nTech in the Service of Performance\nThe harmony doesn’t end with the purely mechanical. Our car’s optional adaptive suspension, called Electronic Damping Control, offered a choice of three settings: Comfort, Normal and Sport. Comfort makes the car more than livable in day-to-day driving, and Normal isn’t bad either, especially with the 18-inch wheels. It’s a good level of ride comfort, yet it provides definitive body roll damping and traction when you need it. Sport is more like what many cars give you in their only sport mode: a demonstrably firm ride that doesn’t attempt to go easy on you at any time. It’s best reserved for a track — a smooth one.\n\nThe button that controls EDC is alongside the shifter, flanked by a button that defeats the electronic stability system and another that increases both the variable throttle response and steering effort. Another option I was glad to have was M Drive, which lets you customize a single “M” button on the steering wheel with various preferences you can then call into action at any moment. Using the optional iDrive controller (which isn’t as bad as it used to be), you choose suspension, stability and — if you have the automatic — shift response settings. M Drive also separates the throttle and power-steering assist settings that are otherwise combined in the Sport button.\n\nPresuming there’s plenty of time to set these things individually on track day, I instead patterned my M for the occasional unexpected curvy road. I never cared much for varying throttle sensitivity, but Sport does yield a bigger blip from the throttle when you tap the accelerator pedal to rev-match, so I went with that rather than the needlessly sensitive Sport Plus. I chose Normal for the suspension, Sport for the steering and M Dynamic Mode for the stability system, which lets you slide around a bit but keeps you from ruining your day.\n\nThe ability to adjust these things independently is great, but activating them to your own specifications with one button is something I’d like to see proliferate. Contrast this with cars that combine multiple changes in one button, as in the Mercedes E550 coupe, whose Sport button firms up the ride conspicuously, makes the accelerator hypersensitive and forces the automatic transmission into lower gears. (For the record, the E63 AMG has a feature similar to M Drive; the E550 is a convenient example of what I consider the worst approach.)\n\nAt its core, the M3 is a car that makes you think you’re a better driver than you probably are. The electronic add-ons take it even further. BMW’s antilock brakes employ a feature called Cornering Brake Control designed to keep their cars from heaving their weight to the outside wheels or spinning out if you brake while in a turn. Once, when barreling into a sharp turn too quickly, I jabbed the M3’s brakes, and the car remained remarkably composed — unfazed, rather than getting out of line. Was it the CBC feature? The competent brakes? The meticulously engineered suspension? It’s hard to tell. Likewise, a couple times I peered down to see the stability light flashing when its intervention hadn’t been obvious, as it is in some cars.\n\nThis is yet another of the M3’s triumphs: its incorporation of smart systems and high-tech adjustability that truly improve the performance and driving experience. Competing models may appear to match the M3 when you compare feature lists, but just because the features are there doesn’t mean they do the job right or improve performance. In the worst cases, they degrade it. Even a technophobic purist would have to tip his helmet to BMW for its seamless integration.\n\nIs the M3 Perfect?\nSo, is the M3 perfect? Of course not. The manual transmission was my sole major complaint. The gearing is all fine, and the electronic throttle has virtually no lag, which can’t be said of some examples, including BMW’s early attempts in the 540i and first-generation Mini Cooper. Blip the M3’s throttle to downshift, and you’re good to go. But the driver interface, to use a geeky term, is a big disappointment: The standard-issue shifter is rubbery and long of throw. It feels utterly disconnected from the drivetrain, like flipping a switch. One could argue that the M3 should have a better one than the regular 3 Series, but really, BMW’s entire lineup deserves something better.\n\nI’m also not wild about the clutch, whose takeup is high in the pedal’s travel, where it’s not as easy to feather. I also prefer linear resistance along the way, and this pedal resists pressure up high and then eases up abruptly as you press down. Some drivers might prefer this design, or the isolated shifter. Not I. And while I have no objection to Reverse being to the left of 1st gear (some do), BMW could improve things by requiring you to press the stick down before moving it into the Reverse gate. Not only does it prevent you from going into Reverse when you don’t want to, it also makes you certain when you have done so. This shifter is just too ambiguous. These issues, which some drivers might overlook, stand out because the M3 is otherwise such a stunningly complete and cohesive package.\n\nThe gas mileage, at 14/20 mpg on premium gas, clearly sucks, as does the resulting $1,300 gas-guzzler tax. It’s not outrageous for a sports car, but it stands out because, against all odds, the car makes a good daily driver.\n\nFour Seats & A Trunk\nBased on the M3’s performance, you’d probably accept it if it had only two seats. Or even one. Actually, it has four, with reasonable backseat space for adults and a generous trunk with folding rear seats and a center pass-through. Getting into the backseat presents the usual challenge, though rocker switches atop the front-seat backrests simplify moving the whole seat forward and back. For $3,000 less and a mere 22 pounds more curb weight, you can get the M3 as a sedan. Some say coupes always look better than sedans. I’ve questioned if the 335i coupe got that memo, but I did like our Melbourne Red Metallic M3 coupe. BMW says the doors and trunklid are the only sheet metal shared with the regular 3 Series. It’s a more aggressive design, with flared fenders, larger air intakes and quad tailpipes, but compared with many sports cars, the M3 remains low-profile.\n\nSafety\nThe BMW 3 Series hardtops earned the highest score, Good, in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s frontal, side and rear crash tests. (The convertible has not been tested.) Like most cars in its class, it hasn’t been tested yet for roof strength, a measure of rollover safety. Standard airbags include front and side curtain airbags, along with front-seat-mounted side-impact torso airbags. Other standard safety features include antilock brakes and an electronic stability system. The front head restraints tilt forward and back, and the backseat’s restraints are height adjustable.\n\nFor a list of all safety features, click here.\n\nM3 in the Market\nBased on price and body style, the M3 has competitors. If you want torque, the Mercedes C63 AMG delivers, as does the Cadillac CTS-V, though the latter compares more to the M5 in size. The Audi S4 doesn’t try to compete on price or performance, so Audi’s out of the game unless it brings back the RS4. The Lexus IS-F is a decent first effort, but I find it too skittish, and I can’t work with that eight-speed automatic. None of these models reflects the M3’s 24 years of refinement. Once you consider the M3’s performance and day-to-day livability, its $55,400 starting price is reasonable. For that matter, so is our coupe’s as-tested price of $64,775, which includes the gas tax and destination charge.\n\nThe M3’s capabilities have a shortcoming: that the car’s limits are far on the other side of legality and good sense. If you’re able to enjoy the M3’s potential without hitting a racetrack, you live someplace more remote or lawless — and definitely more interesting — than I do. The M3 is hardly alone in this; it’s been true of many cars for years, and more are joining those ranks all the time. The more unflappable cars become, the less fun they are day to day. The good news is that the 3 Series is a whole line of very capable cars that share the M3’s basic attributes, to a lesser degree. With the 335i, you even get more low-rev torque where you want it most, for regular city and highway driving. Anyone who’s not in a position to spend more than $55K for an M3 can get a 335i for $40,600 instead and feel damn good about it.\n\nSend Joe an email",

The M340i gets a 382-hp, turbo 3.0-liter inline-six with a 48-volt mild-hybrid system. Rounding out the 3 Series lineup is the plug-in hybrid 330e (which has up to 22 miles of electric driving range) and the high-performance M3. The M3 has a twin-turbo inline-six with at least 473 hp, and it’s the only 3 Series model still available with a six-speed manual transmission. All 3 Series models are available with rear-wheel drive or all-wheel drive.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 BMW 3 Series? \n\nAfter a mid-cycle refresh for the 2023 model year, the regular BMW 3 Series lineup doesn’t see any significant changes for 2024. The M3 gains a limited-edition CS trim with 543 hp, specific suspension tuning and a starting price of almost $120,000. \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 BMW 3 Series Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n14.9-inch infotainment touchscreen\n12.3-inch digital gauge display\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nPower moonroof\nLED headlights \n40/20/40-split, folding backseat\nSatellite radio\nNavigation\nRain-sensing wipers\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nRemote start\nHeated front and rear seats\nHeated steering wheel\nHarman Kardon premium stereo\nHead-up instrument display\nBlind spot warning\nLane departure steering assist\nHands-free low-speed highway driving system\n​​Adaptive suspension\nShould I Buy the 2024 BMW 3 Series?\n\nFor many years, the BMW 3 Series has been the default choice for luxury shoppers looking for a relatively small and sporty sedan. The cabin has adult-friendly accommodations, and the onboard tech is suitably impressive for a car in this class. That said, care must be taken when adding options or climbing to higher-performing models. Both quickly raise the price, making the 3 Series a tougher sell for anyone seeking to balance value with driving pleasure.",

      "expert_review": "Bing.\n\nIt’s a sweet tone: a small little bell echoing through the cockpit of the 2008 BMW M3.\n\nThe problem was I didn’t know what it meant. Bings, bongs, and little beeps always mean something, and usually it’s something wrong: check your seat belt; your door is ajar; the engine is about to explode. I didn’t know what this particular unobtrusive bing meant in the greater scheme of warning signals, so I took my foot off the accelerator and looked over the sleek black leather dashboard.\n\nNot a sign, but wow, the M3 is sweet.\n\nSome cars can impress with their performance, others with their posh touches and cool technology; the M3 manages both. It has to with so many other high-end sports sedans vying for the No. 1 spot with American racers. The Audi RS4, Lexus IS F and C63 AMG all beat the M3 in one area or another — but none offer as complete a package.\n\nThe C63 AMG offers more luxury (and power) than the M3 in terms of comfort and quiet ride. The RS4 can outperform the M3 in extreme cornering and in bad weather. But that’s not taking anything away from the M3, which wins the triathlon of fun, sporty and luxurious without taking first in any of the events.\n\nOf course, with any of these cars, you’ll need more than $50,000 available just to be given a free cup of coffee at the dealership. The M3 sedan starts at $55,875, which includes shipping and a $1,300 gas guzzler tax or the same amount my 401(k) lost while you’re reading this.\n\nAll that money won’t buy you great gas mileage. The M3 hits 14 miles per gallon in the city and 20 mpg on the highway. Then again, if you have the cash for this car, you’re more concerned with performance and leather-wrapped exclusivity than gas mileage.\n\nFamiliar look; extreme comfort You’re never far from little reminders of your special BMW. The M logo decorates the steering wheel, the speedometer, the front fenders, trunk and door sills.\n\nThe dash keeps BMW’s simple black-faced gauges and red needles. There’s a reassuring and familiar look to them. A display screen is mounted under a simple sloping edge at the top of the dash.\n\nThe seats, which include an optional back-widening function, are extremely comfortable and hold you snugly, the way a sports car should. The leather is premium and every touch of trim is tastefully applied. Your friends will smell the German craftsmanship — which is significantly better than smelling a German craftsman.\n\nConnected to the iDrive, the display screen shows each click and twist of the knob. Now, I know lots of people complain about the iDrive, but I no longer understand those quibbles. BMW has vastly improved how it works, and without ever getting the owner’s manual out, I could find the navigation system and adjust the radio without turning the AC off.\n\nHigh-revving performance Luxury is nice, but performance is king with the M3. The fourth generation finally got a V-8. Not just any V-8 either. It’s a 4-liter, 414-horsepower, high-revving piece of German ingenuity.\n\nBy replacing the six-cylinder engine from the previous M3, BMW has made a bigger engine that is lighter, more powerful and more efficient.\n\nI could go into detail about the individual throttle butterfly for each cylinder, the variable double-VANOS camshaft management or the volume flow-controlled, pendulum-slide cell pump that keeps each cylinder super slick to show off how advanced this engine is, but you’d stop reading.\n\nInstead, I’ll tell you what all of that technology does: Woooo hoooo!\n\nThe M3 has great pickup, especially at speed, when the revs are high. Driving a high-rev engine at first feels all wrong. Most V-8s would rather throw a rod than rev past 6,000 rpm. At 6K, the M3’s engine is just getting started, and that’s where the twitchy, seat of your pants fun kicks into a new gear (pun completely intended).\n\nI always want to shift too early with these rare V-8s and I have to listen to that little William Wallace in my head as the revs climb higher and higher like the approaching English cavalry. Hold, hold, hold … shift.\n\nBing.\n\nHere we go again. I pull off the highway, tap the brake pedal and let the performance brakes easily bring the 4,720-pound M3 to a stop. While the car remains heavy, its oversized brakes and big engine make it feel much lighter.\n\nThe M stands for monster Sitting in a parking lot along Eureka Road in Taylor, I looked over the M3.\n\nWhat a piece of machinery. BMW has sharpened all the edges and bulked up the M3 significantly.\n\nThis is as chiseled as Mark McGuire in the late ’90s.\n\nThe bulging aluminum hood, the glowing streams of light circling the Xenon headlights, the dual kidney grille and the wide shoulders of the flared front fenders pushing out all make this Bimmer ripple.\n\nAlong the side, the small gills on the front fenders add to the look, and in case someone doesn’t know it’s an M; little badges point it out for them.\n\nThere are certain connotations that come with this kind of car: wealth, adventure, wealth, appreciation of the finer things, wealth. People should know exactly what it is.\n\nAs for its performance, the M stands for monster. It’s phenomenal and much more than any person driving off an autobahn really needs. The stiff body tears through corners, and the wheels stick to the road like bear claws to a tree. The steering is firm and precise.\n\nBMW has improved its electronic stability control to allow for some dampening by setting the chassis dynamics on Sport, Normal or Comfort. The sport mode stiffens up the ride and lets you push this rear-wheel-drive rocket more than any other setting. It is ideal for the track wannabe who thinks he understands race car driving and buys a machine he may never really test.\n\nBut if he does want to test it, he’d better learn what that bing means.\n\nAfter a few days of testing this BMW and hearing that bing, I discovered it was a notification that I was driving above 70 mph — a gentle reminder to slow down.\n\nQuickly, I looked through the owner’s manual — which is thicker than the Wasilla, Alaska, phonebook — and figured out how to turn it off. I shouldn’t be distracted if I’m driving that fast through a school zone.\n\nBut it would make a great ring tone for my phone.\n\n2008 BMW M3 Sedan\n\nPrice: $55,875\n\nType: Five passenger sports sedan\n\nEngine: 4-liter V-8\n\nTransmission: Six-speed manual or seven-speed double clutch automatic (debuts on the M3 convertible this fall)\n\nPower: 414-hp; 295 pound feet torque\n\nEPA gas mileage:\n\n14 mpg city / 20 mpg highway\n\n(Premium fuel required)\n\nPrice includes: $775 shipping and $1,300 gas guzzler tax\n\nFor Online:\n\nDimensions (inches)\n\nWheelbase: 108.7\n\nLength: 180.4\n\nHeight: 57\n\nWidth: 71.5\n\nTrunk volume: 15.9 cubic feet\n\nFuel capacity: 16.6 gallons\n\nCurb weight: 3,726 pounds\n\nGross vehicle weight rating: 4,740 pounds\n\nWeight distribution (front/rear): 47.8 percent / 52.2 percent\n\nSteering: Rack-and-pinion\n\nBrakes:\n\nFront: 14.2-inch ventilated discs\n\nRear: 13.8-inch ventilated discs\n\nBy the numbers\n\n155: Top speed in miles per hour\n\n4.7: Time in seconds to go from 0-60 mph\n\n16: Combined average fuel economy\n\n345: Approximate range in miles\n\nReport Card\n\nOverall: *** 1/2\n\nExterior: Excellent. Clean and cut like a body builder. If people don’t know what an M does, they’ll figure it out by the way this Bimmer looks.\n\nInterior: Good. Comfortable and graceful. This interior emphasizes quality instead of trying to show off.\n\nPerformance: Excellent. Adjustable chassis dynamics make this a great cruiser on the highway and speed demon on the track.\n\nSafety: Good. Refined crumple zones and improved frame, four air bags including side-curtain air bags for the front and rear passengers.\n\nPros: Fun, sporty and luxurious. BMW enthusiasts will love the M3. Offers an excellent combination of all three.\n\nCons: Good in all three doesn’t make it the best in any.

      "expert_review": "While the Z3 roadster may cause your pulse to race, the M3 is arguably the best convertible in BMW’s stable.\n\nIt has the moves of a thoroughbred, blue ribbon styling and an engine that charms you more with every gearshift. The 3.2-liter, in-line 6-cylinder jewel nestled under its graceful hood has 240 horses, about 50 more than the standard 328i. With the slightest prod of the throttle you can feel every one of them straining to run free, and when you give them free rein they snap your head back and put a huge grin on your face. Even though European M3s have considerably more horsepower, this car performs almost as well because its engine has been tuned for American driving conditions, where mid-range throttle response is more important than top speed. Consequently, getting it up to speed doesn’t take constant flogging. Just step on the gas and it moves out as if it were levitating.\n\nAside from its engine, the high-performance M3 differs from the standard 3-series by having a firm, sports suspension, 17-inch wheels, slightly different lower-body panels, leather upholstery and a handsome three-spoke steering wheel. The differences are subtle, and only dedicated Bimmerphiles will know you’re behind the wheel of a very special model.\n\nOut in traffic, however, other drivers will figure out that you’re in something special as you leap to 60 mph in about 6 seconds and leave them gasping in your wake. Acceleration is only one part of the M3 equation, however. The buttoned-down suspension keeps it so firmly in touch with the road that when you point its nose into a turn it scribes an arc as cleanly as if you used a compass.\n\nFind an open road and it gallops so effortlessly that you constantly find yourself exceeding the speed limit, even with the top down.\n\nDriving with the top down is the best way to enjoy this car, and you can go au naturel in a matter of seconds because the top is fully electric. Hold down the button on the console and it automatically unlatches, retracts and tucks itself under a hard cover. The plastic rear window seems oddly out of place in car of this price and sophistication. Many of its competitors have a glass window with built-in defogger.\n\nOf course, the top impinges on trunk space, but there is still enough room for a couple of carry-on bags.\n\nThe top also makes the back seat smaller, and while there is space for two, my wife found the legroom to be pretty snug when she crawled in back while we took a friend on a demonstration drive. This is a space best left to youngsters, she decided after a few minutes of riding with her feet angled to one side.\n\nIn keeping with the $45,900 base price, the M3 is lavishly equipped. Our test car’s dark green metallic paint was highlighted by a muted tan leather interior that contrasted nicely with the black instrument panel. M3 badging, including a lighted M3 crest atop the gearshift lever, was subtle. Overall, the interior felt rich and sumpt uous.\n\nThe sport bucket seats rank right up there with some of the best seats I know. They have excellent under-thigh support, while the sides grip you securely, yet firmly.\n\nGood lighting is critical in a fast car. Low-beam headlights were so-so, but flicking on the high beams was like turning on the landing lights of a jetliner.\n\nBrakes are another area where the M3 shines. Ventilated four-wheel disc brakes wipe off speed so efficiently I often underestimated how long it would take to stop.\n\nWith the appearance of a new 3-series sedan, a new convertible is bound to be in the works at some point in the future. It will be hard to come up with one that is any more captivating than the M3, however.\n\nPrice\n\nThe base price is $45,900. Heated seats were the only option on our test car, and they brought the sticker price to $46,970, including destination charges.\n\nWarranty\n\nThe standard warranty is for four years or 50,000 miles, and all scheduled main nance is free for three years or 36,000 miles.\n\nVehicles for The Star’s week-long test drives are supplied by the auto manufacturers.\n\nPoint: If there’s anything better than a handsome convertible, it is one with a muscular engine, excellent handling and tastefully executed luxury inside.\n\nCounterpoint: The trunk is small and the plastic back window is out of place on a car in this price range.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\n\nENGINE: 3.2-liter, 6-cyl.\n\nTRANSMISSION: 5-speed\n\nWHEELBASE: 106.3 inches\n\nCURB WEIGHT: 3,491 lbs.\n\nBASE PRICE: $45,900\n\nPRICE AS DRIVEN: $46,970\n\nMPG RATING: 20 city, 27 highway",
