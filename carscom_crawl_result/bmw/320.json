      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nBMW’s compact 3 Series is the luxury automaker’s bread-and-butter model. It’s available as a sedan, hatchback (Gran Turismo) or wagon, and numerous drivetrains are offered including hybrid and diesel versions. The five-seat 3 Series comes with rear- or all-wheel drive and competes with the Audi A4, Cadillac ATS and Mercedes-Benz C-Class.\n\n(Skip to details on the: 3 Series Gran Turismo, ActiveHybrid 3)\n\nNew for 2014\nThe 3 Series Sport Wagon rejoins the lineup after skipping a model year, and a new Gran Turismo version that combines coupe and hatchback styling is also new. A new turbocharged four-cylinder diesel engine makes its debut in the 328d and gets an EPA-estimated 32/45 mpg city/highway with rear-wheel drive. The new 4 Series coupe has replaced the 3 Series coupe in BMW’s lineup. \n\nNew standard features include a leather-wrapped sport steering wheel, dark burl walnut wood trim and a 10-year subscription to BMW’s emergency communication system that includes automatic collision notification. Models with the available navigation system get a new iDrive controller with a text-input touchpad.\n\nExterior Highlights\n\n\nDifferent grille, side mirror and tailpipe treatments distinguish among the Sport, Luxury and M Sport “lines”\n17-inch alloy wheels; available 18- or 19-inch wheels\nRain-sensing windshield wipers\nAvailable Active Steering system with speed-sensitive assist\nAvailable adaptive xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights\nAvailable automatic high-beam headlights\nAvailable power moonroof\n\nInterior Highlights\n\n\nSeats five\nManually adjustable front seats; power front seats available\nAvailable leather upholstery\nAvailable heated front and rear seats, heated steering wheel\nAvailable split-folding backseat\nPush-button start\nDual-zone automatic climate control\nTilt/telescoping steering wheel\nCD stereo with HD Radio and USB port\nBluetooth connectivity\nIDrive controller and 6.5-inch screen\nAvailable navigation system\nAvailable Harman Kardon surround sound stereo\nAvailable sunshades for the rear windows\n\nUnder the Hood\n\n\n180-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (320i)\n180-hp, turbo-diesel 2.0-liter four-cylinder (328d)\n240-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder (328i)\n300-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder (335i)\nEight-speed automatic transmission\nSix-speed manual available\nFuel-saving stop-start technology\n\nSafety Features\n\nAntilock brakes\nElectronic stability system\nSide-impact airbags for the front seats\nSide curtain airbags\nFront knee airbags\nAvailable front and rear parking sensors\nAvailable backup camera\nAvailable lane departure warning\nAvailable blind spot warning system\nAvailable active cruise control with Stop & Go technology\n\n\n3 Series Gran Turismo\nThe 3 Series Gran Turismo is a new four-door coupe like hatchback version of BMW’s compact luxury car. Though styling cues are shared with the 3 Series Sport Wagon, the 3 Series Gran Turismo is a larger car overall, measuring nearly 8 inches longer and more than 3 inches taller. The result is a roomier cabin, especially for backseat passengers who enjoy 2.8 inches of extra legroom, and the front and rear seats are positioned higher for easier entry and exit.\n\n240-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (328i)\n300-hp, turbo 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder (335i)\nEight-speed automatic transmission\nAll-wheel drive\nSplit-folding rear seat\nCargo area has tie-down points, hooks and underfloor storage\n\nBack to top\nActiveHybrid 3\nIntroduced last year, the ActiveHybrid 3 is a 3 Series sedan with a gas/electric hybrid drivetrain. Subtle styling cues differentiate the ActiveHybrid 3 from the regular 3 Series. There are logos on the rear roof pillars, adaptive xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights, galvanized slats in the twin-kidney grille and matte chrome tailpipes.\n\n\nNewly standard leather-wrapped sport steering wheel\n18-inch alloy wheels\nTurbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder engine, electric motor and a lithium-ion battery pack\nTotal system output is 335 hp\nElectric motor can provide a power boost when accelerating\nCan be driven up to 2.5 miles at speeds up to 47 mph on electric power alone if conditions allow\nZero to 60 mph in 5.2 seconds, according to BMW\nEight-speed automatic transmission\nFuel-saving stop-start technology\nGas engine can shut down to save fuel when coasting at speeds up to 100 mph\n\nBack to top",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nBMW’s compact 3 Series is the luxury automaker’s bread-and-butter model. It’s available as a sedan, Gran Turismo hatchback or wagon. Numerous drivetrains are offered, including hybrid and diesel versions. The five-seat 3 Series comes with rear- or all-wheel drive and competes with the Audi A4, Cadillac ATS and Mercedes-Benz C-Class. The coupe and convertible that formerly were part of the 3 Series lineup are now designated the 4 Series under BMW’s current nomenclature.\n\n(Skip to details on the: 3 Series Gran Turismo, ActiveHybrid 3)\nNew for 2015\n\nM Sport brakes are no longer available on the 328d. The keyless entry feature that’s part of the available Premium Package on the wagon and Gran Turismo now includes hands-free liftgate closing.\n \nThe below is a list of highlighted features and not an exhaustive list. Features are standard unless otherwise noted.\nExterior Highlights\n\nDifferent grille, side mirror and tailpipe treatments distinguish the Sport, Luxury and M Sport “lines”\n17-inch alloy wheels; available 18- or 19-inch wheels\nRain-sensing windshield wipers\nAvailable variable sport steering with speed-sensitive assist\nAvailable adaptive xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights\nAvailable automatic high-beam headlights\nAvailable power moonroof\n\nInterior Highlights\n\nSeats five\nManually adjustable front seats; power front seats available\nAvailable leather upholstery\nAvailable heated front and rear seats, heated steering wheel\nAvailable split-folding backseat\nPush-button start\nDual-zone automatic climate control\nTilt/telescoping steering wheel\nCD stereo with HD Radio and USB port\nBluetooth connectivity\nIDrive controller and 6.5-inch screen\nAvailable navigation system\nAvailable Harman Kardon surround-sound stereo\nAvailable sunshades for the rear windows\n\nUnder the Hood\n\n180-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (320i)\n180-hp, turbo-diesel 2.0-liter four-cylinder (328d)\n240-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder (328i)\n300-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder (335i)\nEight-speed automatic transmission\nSix-speed manual available at no cost\nFuel-saving stop-start technology\n\nSafety Features\n\nRequired in every new car: front airbags, antilock brakes and an electronic stability system\nSide-impact airbags for the front seats\nSide curtain airbags\nFront knee airbags\nAvailable front and rear parking sensors\nAvailable backup camera\nAvailable lane departure warning\nAvailable blind spot warning system\nAvailable adaptive cruise control with Stop & Go technology\n\n3 Series Gran Turismo\n\nThe 3 Series Gran Turismo is a four-door, coupelike hatchback version of BMW’s compact luxury car.

It’s a larger car overall, measuring nearly 8 inches longer and more than 3 inches taller. The result is a roomier cabin, especially for backseat passengers, who get 2.8 inches of extra legroom. The front and rear seats are also positioned higher for easier entry and exit.\n\nFor 2017, new more powerful four-cylinder and six-cylinder engines result in new model designations: 330i and 340i.
