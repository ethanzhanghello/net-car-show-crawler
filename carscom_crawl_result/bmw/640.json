      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nRedesigned last year, the BMW 6 Series comes with either an inline-six or V-8 engine and is offered in coupe and soft-top convertible variants, both of which seat four. The Jaguar XK is the 6 Series’ most direct competitor, but you might cross-shop the car against a Mercedes-Benz E-Class coupe or cabriolet, too.\nNew for 2013\nThe 650i’s twin-turbo V-8 is now rated at 445 horsepower and 480 pounds-feet of torque, and the engine features fuel-saving stop-start technology and BMW’s Eco Pro setting.\nExterior\nThe 6 Series maintains a short front overhang and low-slung appearance. BMW says the design was inspired by the natural motion of waves.\n\nThe convertible’s fully automatic soft-top has what BMW describes as a flying-buttress design in which the top trails behind a vertical rear window, maintaining a coupe-like roofline. The top, which can be operated at the touch of a button at speeds up to 25 mph, comes in black or beige. Exterior features include:\n\n\n18-inch wheels standard; 19- or 20-inch wheels available\nStandard adaptive xenon headlamps\nStandard glass sunroof with power-sliding sunshade \nAvailable adaptive LED headlights\n\nInterior\nThe interior has a 2+2 seating configuration with small rear seats. Trunk volume in the coupe is about 30 percent more than the convertible with its top up; with the top down, the convertible loses another 14 percent. Interior features include:\n\nPower-adjustable seats\nOptional ventilated and massaging front seats\nStandard iDrive with a 10.2-inch high-resolution screen and navigation \nAvailable heated steering wheel\nAvailable Bang & Olufsen premium stereo\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe 640i is powered by a 315-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter six-cylinder engine while the 650i gets a 445-hp, twin-turbo 4.4-liter V-8. Mechanical features include:\n\n\nEight-speed automatic transmission with steering-wheel-mounted shift paddles\nRear-wheel drive for 640i\nRear- or all-wheel drive for 650i\n\nSafety\nBoth the coupe and convertible have front airbags plus side-impact airbags built into the front seats. Safety features include:\n\n\nAntilock brakes\nElectronic stability system\nPop-up roll bars in convertible\nBackup camera\nFront and rear parking sensors\nAvailable parallel-parking assist\nAvailable surround-view system\nAvailable blind spot warning system\nAvailable lane departure warning system with frontal collision warning\nAvailable night vision with pedestrian detection",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nRedesigned for 2012, the BMW 6 Series comes with either an inline-six or V-8 engine and is offered in coupe and soft-top convertible variants, both of which seat four. New features include adaptive LED headlights, surround-view cameras and a Bang & Olufsen stereo. The Jaguar XK is the 6 Series’ most direct competitor, but you might cross-shop the car against a Mercedes E-Class coupe or cabriolet, too.\n\nThe 650i, with its twin-turbo V-8 engine, is covered separately in the Cars.com Research section.\n\nExterior\nThe new 6 Series measures some 3 inches longer and 1.5 inches wider than its predecessor; it’s a few tenths of an inch shorter at the roof level. As before, the car maintains a short front overhang and low-slung appearance. BMW says the design was inspired by the natural motion of waves. The car’s available LED headlights include an adaptive function to illuminate oncoming corners, something LED lights haven’t traditionally been capable of doing. Eighteen-inch alloy wheels are standard, with 19- or 20-inch wheels optional.\n\nThe convertible’s fully automatic soft-top has what BMW describes as a flying-buttress design in which the top trails behind a vertical rear window, maintaining a coupe-like roofline. The top, which can be operated at the touch of a button at speeds up to 25 mph, comes in black or beige.\n\nInterior\nThe interior has a 2+2 seating configuration with small rear seats, though BMW says those seats get more legroom than the previous generation. Headroom has also increased in the front and rear. Trunk volume in the coupe is about 30 percent more than the convertible with its top up; with the top down, the convertible loses another 14 percent. An optional pass-through to the cabin, fitted with a ski bag, comes in an optional Cold Weather Package, along with a heated steering wheel and heated front seats.\n\nThe front power seats have 10-way adjustment, and ventilation and massage features are optional. Navigation and other features are controlled through the standard iDrive system, which includes a 10.2-inch high-resolution screen on the dashboard.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe 640i is powered by a 315-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter six-cylinder engine. Its peak torque rating is 332 pounds-feet. BMW cites a zero to 60 mph time of 5.5 seconds for both the coupe and convertible. The standard eight-speed automatic transmission includes steering-wheel-mounted shift paddles.\n\nOther standard features include computer-controlled adaptive shock absorbers and Driving Dynamics Control, which allows the driver to adjust the ride quality, accelerator response, power-steering assist level and automatic transmission behavior.\n\nOptional mechanical upgrades include active stabilizer bars and active steering, the latter of which adds rear-wheel steering to the earlier generation’s variable-ratio front steering system.\n\nSafety\nBoth the coupe and convertible have front airbags plus side-impact airbags built into the front seats. As required of all 2012 models sold in the U.S., the 640i has standard antilock brakes and an electronic stability system. Active head restraints for the front seats are designed to prevent whiplash injuries. In the convertible, active roll bars hide under the rear deck to maximize visibility. If the car senses a sideways tip, the bars raise to provide rollover protection.\n\nOptional safety features include blind spot and lane departure warning systems and night vision with pedestrian detection.\n\nA backup camera is standard, and buyers can choose additional top- and side-view cameras for added protection when parking and creeping into intersections.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in February 2016 about the 2016 BMS 640i, but little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2017, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years. \n\nThe 6 Series is BMW’s biggest coupe, but not its most expensive. That designation goes to the i8 plug-in hybrid supercar, which costs nearly twice as much. The 6 Series is also offered as a soft-top convertible and in Gran Coupe form. The Gran Coupe is based on a stretched version of the 6 Series and has four doors, but it’s considerably more expensive than the automaker’s similarly sized 5 Series sedan. In addition to the standard inline-six-cylinder engine, BMW offers V-8 power and high-performance M6 variants for all three 6 Series body styles.\n\nEven with an as-tested price of $87,195, including a $995 destination charge, our 640i test car was at the less-expensive end of the 6 Series price range. It included options such as BMW’s xDrive all-wheel-drive system ($3,000), a Black Accent Package ($4,000), multicontour seats ($1,300) and a Cold Weather Package ($400).\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nLow-slung with sleek proportions, the 6 Series exudes understated elegance. While the coupe’s silhouette is pretty much the same as before, BMW has tweaked the front end for the 2016 model year, adding new standard full-LED headlights, LED fog lights and a new lower apron, like the one on the brand’s smaller 4 Series coupe.\n\nThe new-for-2016 Black Accent Package looked sharp against our test car’s Alpine White exterior. The package adds gloss-black bars in the grille, gloss-black trim pieces, darkened tailpipes and unique 20-inch, light-alloy wheels.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nPowered by a 315-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter six-cylinder engine, the 640i is the base version of the 6 Series. The six-cylinder and eight-speed automatic transmission it works with, though, are a winning combination; I never found myself longing for the 650i’s 445-hp V-8.\n\nThe six-cylinder is a torque-rich engine — it makes 330 pounds-feet of torque at a low 1,400 rpm — and it helps this big coupe move out assertively, even at highway speeds. The automatic transmission complements the engine by willingly kicking down a gear — or a bunch of gears — when you step on the gas pedal. EPA-estimated gas mileage with all-wheel drive is 20/29/23 mpg city/highway/combined.\n\nBMW’s Driving Dynamics Control includes five driving modes: two Sport settings, two Comfort settings and Eco Pro. The various modes change drivetrain responsiveness, transmission behavior and the firmness of the standard Dynamic Damper Control adaptive suspension.\n\nDespite offering Comfort and Comfort+ modes, the 640i’s adaptive suspension still skews firm, with ride quality that reveals pavement imperfections rather than masking them. The available 20-inch low-profile tires likely play a role here, as narrow-sidewall tires tend to be stiff, but the difference between the suspension’s firmest and softest settings isn’t dramatic.\n\nBody roll is very well-controlled for a big, heavy coupe; the 640i stays flat and feels planted through sweeping corners, even in its Comfort setting. Our test car didn’t have them, but active stabilizer bars designed to counteract body roll are a $2,500 option.\n\nUnfortunately, the 640i has numb steering. There’s less power assist at highway speeds, which gives the wheel some extra heft and enhances directional stability, but feedback doesn’t improve. BMW used to be known for its cars’ great steering, but competitors such as Jaguar, with its F-Type, do a better job today.\n\nInterior\n\nWith the 640i’s as-tested price of nearly $90,000, you should expect a lot from the cabin, and it mostly delivers. It’s richly appointed, with soft leather on not only the seats but also the doors and dashboard, and you can see the attention to detail in the fit and finish. Many of the trim pieces are accented with real stitching, too.\n\nI was surprised, however, by our test car’s lack of certain features. There were no ventilated seats, and active safety features such as blind spot warning, lane departure warning and forward collision warning were not present. For this kind of money, they should be.\n\nThe optional multicontour front seats have numerous power adjustments, including the upper portion of the backrest and side bolsters. Cushioning is firm, but I thought the seats were comfortable overall. Our test car’s adventurous brown and black color scheme carried over to the seats, which were trimmed in brown leather with black accents. The combination was visually jarring.\n\nThe 6 Series has very good visibility, which is something you don’t always get in a coupe. The long doors have large windows for great over-shoulder views, and the rear-quarter windows are big, too, which makes it easier to see nearby cars when changing lanes. Front and rear parking sensors and a backup camera are standard and provide added confidence when maneuvering at low speeds.\n\nAdults can fit in the two-person backseat in a pinch, but passenger comfort back there is compromised in a few ways: There’s not a lot of headroom, you have to sit with your legs at an uncomfortable angle and the backrest isn’t reclined enough. Still, it’s better than the 911’s tiny backseat, and the F-Type doesn’t even have a rear seat.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nBMW’s iDrive multimedia system, which consists of a knob-style console controller and buttons that operate a 10.2-inch dashboard screen, is standard. Using the controller to navigate menus on the widescreen display is mostly intuitive, thanks to the system’s easy-to-understand interface. There are also helpful direct-access buttons around the knob controller that take you right to the navigation or audio screen, for instance.\n\nThe widescreen display has beautiful, crisp graphics, and it responds quickly when making selections. You can choose to split the screen, which lets you do things such as scroll through radio stations on one side and have a smaller version of the navigation map on the other.\n\nPairing my iPhone to the multimedia system using Bluetooth was straightforward, and I used the iDrive controller to scroll through songs stored on my phone. Album artwork appears on the dashboard screen.\n\nCargo & Storage\n\nThe 640i’s 16.2-cubic-foot trunk is larger than the cargo areas in both the F-Type (11 cubic feet) and 911 (4.8 cubic feet). It’s deep and relatively tall, and though there’s a pass-through to the seating area (a ski bag is optional) the whole backseat doesn’t fold.\n\nCabin storage space is minimal. The door pockets are small, and there are few storage areas for loose items.\n\nSafety\n\nThe 6 Series hasn’t been crash-tested by either the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. It’s not unusual for high-priced luxury cars like the 6 Series, which sell in relatively low numbers, to go untested.\n\nStandard features include BMW’s Active Protection System, which pre-tensions the seat belts and closes the windows and moonroof when a crash is imminent.\n\nSafety options include lane departure warning, forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, blind spot warning, a surround-view camera system and a night vision system that can detect pedestrians up to 330 feet away.\n\nFor a full list of safety features, see the Features & Specs page.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nPremium pricing is part of the deal with cars like the 6 Series, and this BMW checks the requirements of a high-dollar coupe. It’s stylish without being overly showy, and it has a luxurious interior and plenty of power. I’d take more ride comfort and better steering feel, but overall it remains a compelling accessory for a night on the town.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2016 BMW 640i coupe is powerful and surrounds you with a richly finished interior, but a little more ride comfort would enhance its grand touring personality.\n\nVersus the competition: The 640i coupe balances sporty handling and comfort in a class with high-performance-handling machines — such as the Jaguar F-Type and Porsche 911 — on one end and the cruising-oriented Mercedes-Benz E-Class coupe on the other.\n\nThe 6 Series is BMW’s biggest coupe, but not its most expensive. That designation goes to the i8 plug-in hybrid supercar, which costs nearly twice as much. The 6 Series is also offered as a soft-top convertible and in Gran Coupe form. The Gran Coupe is based on a stretched version of the 6 Series and has four doors, but it’s considerably more expensive than the automaker’s similarly sized 5 Series sedan. In addition to the standard inline-six-cylinder engine, BMW offers V-8 power and high-performance M6 variants for all three 6 Series body styles.\n\nEven with an as-tested price of $87,195, including a $995 destination charge, our 640i test car was at the less-expensive end of the 6 Series price range. It included options such as BMW’s xDrive all-wheel-drive system ($3,000), a Black Accent Package ($4,000), multicontour seats ($1,300) and a Cold Weather Package ($400).\n\nExterior & Styling\nLow-slung with sleek proportions, the 6 Series exudes understated elegance. While the coupe’s silhouette is pretty much the same as before, BMW has tweaked the front end for the 2016 model year, adding new standard full-LED headlights, LED fog lights and a new lower apron, like the one on the brand’s smaller 4 Series coupe.\n\nThe new-for-2016 Black Accent Package looked sharp against our test car’s Alpine White exterior. The package adds gloss-black bars in the grille, gloss-black trim pieces, darkened tailpipes and unique 20-inch, light-alloy wheels.\n\nHow It Drives\nPowered by a 315-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter six-cylinder engine, the 640i is the base version of the 6 Series. The six-cylinder and eight-speed automatic transmission it works with, though, are a winning combination; I never found myself longing for the 650i’s 445-hp V-8.\n\nThe six-cylinder is a torque-rich engine — it makes 330 pounds-feet of torque at a low 1,400 rpm — and it helps this big coupe move out assertively, even at highway speeds. The automatic transmission complements the engine by willingly kicking down a gear — or a bunch of gears — when you step on the gas pedal. EPA-estimated gas mileage with all-wheel drive is 20/29/23 mpg city/highway/combined.\n\nBMW’s Driving Dynamics Control includes five driving modes: two Sport settings, two Comfort settings and Eco Pro. The various modes change drivetrain responsiveness, transmission behavior and the firmness of the standard Dynamic Damper Control adaptive suspension.\n\nDespite offering Comfort and Comfort+ modes, the 640i’s adaptive suspension still skews firm, with ride quality that reveals pavement imperfections rather than masking them. The available 20-inch low-profile tires likely play a role here, as narrow-sidewall tires tend to be stiff, but the difference between the suspension’s firmest and softest settings isn’t dramatic.\n\nBody roll is very well-controlled for a big, heavy coupe; the 640i stays flat and feels planted through sweeping corners, even in its Comfort setting. Our test car didn’t have them, but active stabilizer bars designed to counteract body roll are a $2,500 option.\n\nUnfortunately, the 640i has numb steering. There’s less power assist at highway speeds, which gives the wheel some extra heft and enhances directional stability, but feedback doesn’t improve. BMW used to be known for its cars’ great steering, but competitors such as Jaguar, with its F-Type, do a better job today.\n\nInterior\nWith the 640i’s as-tested price of nearly $90,000, you should expect a lot from the cabin, and it mostly delivers. It’s richly appointed, with soft leather on not only the seats but also the doors and dashboard, and you can see the attention to detail in the fit and finish. Many of the trim pieces are accented with real stitching, too.\n\nI was surprised, however, by our test car’s lack of certain features. There were no ventilated seats, and active safety features such as blind spot warning, lane departure warning and forward collision warning were not present. For this kind of money, they should be.\n\nThe optional multicontour front seats have numerous power adjustments, including the upper portion of the backrest and side bolsters. Cushioning is firm, but I thought the seats were comfortable overall. Our test car’s adventurous brown and black color scheme carried over to the seats, which were trimmed in brown leather with black accents. The combination was visually jarring.\n\nThe 6 Series has very good visibility, which is something you don’t always get in a coupe. The long doors have large windows for great over-shoulder views, and the rear-quarter windows are big, too, which makes it easier to see nearby cars when changing lanes. Front and rear parking sensors and a backup camera are standard and provide added confidence when maneuvering at low speeds.\n\nAdults can fit in the two-person backseat in a pinch, but passenger comfort back there is compromised in a few ways: There’s not a lot of headroom, you have to sit with your legs at an uncomfortable angle and the backrest isn’t reclined enough. Still, it’s better than the 911’s tiny backseat, and the F-Type doesn’t even have a rear seat.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nBMW’s iDrive multimedia system, which consists of a knob-style console controller and buttons that operate a 10.2-inch dashboard screen, is standard. Using the controller to navigate menus on the widescreen display is mostly intuitive, thanks to the system’s easy-to-understand interface. There are also helpful direct-access buttons around the knob controller that take you right to the navigation or audio screen, for instance.\n\nThe widescreen display has beautiful, crisp graphics, and it responds quickly when making selections. You can choose to split the screen, which lets you do things such as scroll through radio stations on one side and have a smaller version of the navigation map on the other.\n\nPairing my iPhone to the multimedia system using Bluetooth was straightforward, and I used the iDrive controller to scroll through songs stored on my phone. Album artwork appears on the dashboard screen.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe 640i’s 16.2-cubic-foot trunk is larger than the cargo areas in both the F-Type (11 cubic feet) and 911 (4.8 cubic feet). It’s deep and relatively tall, and though there’s a pass-through to the seating area (a ski bag is optional) the whole backseat doesn’t fold.\n\nCabin storage space is minimal. The door pockets are small, and there are few storage areas for loose items.\n\nSafety\nThe 6 Series hasn’t been crash-tested by either the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. It’s not unusual for high-priced luxury cars like the 6 Series, which sell in relatively low numbers, to go untested.\n\nStandard features include BMW’s Active Protection System, which pre-tensions the seat belts and closes the windows and moonroof when a crash is imminent.\n\nSafety options include lane departure warning, forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, blind spot warning, a surround-view camera system and a night vision system that can detect pedestrians up to 330 feet away.\n\nFor a full list of safety features, see the Features & Specs page.\n\nValue in Its Class\nPremium pricing is part of the deal with cars like the 6 Series, and this BMW checks the requirements of a high-dollar coupe. It’s stylish without being overly showy, and it has a luxurious interior and plenty of power. I’d take more ride comfort and better steering feel, but overall it remains a compelling accessory for a night on the town.\n\nemail",
