While the sedan was redesigned for 2019, the wagon and five-seat Gran Turismo hatchback will continue this year with the previous design. A 248-horsepower, turbocharged gas 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (330i) and a 320-hp, turbo 3.0-liter six-cylinder (340i) are offered; both drive an eight-speed automatic transmission, and all-wheel drive is standard.  Competitors include the Audi A4 Allroad.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2019 BMW 3 Series Gran Turismo?\n\nStandard Active Driving Assistant includes lane departure and forward collision warnings and city collision mitigation.
