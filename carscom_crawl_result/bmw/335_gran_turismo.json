      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nBMW’s compact 3 Series is the luxury automaker’s bread-and-butter model. It’s available as a sedan, hatchback (Gran Turismo) or wagon, and numerous drivetrains are offered including hybrid and diesel versions. The five-seat 3 Series comes with rear- or all-wheel drive and competes with the Audi A4, Cadillac ATS and Mercedes-Benz C-Class.\n\n(Skip to details on the: 3 Series Gran Turismo, ActiveHybrid 3)\n\nNew for 2014\nThe 3 Series Sport Wagon rejoins the lineup after skipping a model year, and a new Gran Turismo version that combines coupe and hatchback styling is also new. A new turbocharged four-cylinder diesel engine makes its debut in the 328d and gets an EPA-estimated 32/45 mpg city/highway with rear-wheel drive. The new 4 Series coupe has replaced the 3 Series coupe in BMW’s lineup. \n\nNew standard features include a leather-wrapped sport steering wheel, dark burl walnut wood trim and a 10-year subscription to BMW’s emergency communication system that includes automatic collision notification. Models with the available navigation system get a new iDrive controller with a text-input touchpad.\n\nExterior Highlights\n\n\nDifferent grille, side mirror and tailpipe treatments distinguish among the Sport, Luxury and M Sport “lines”\n17-inch alloy wheels; available 18- or 19-inch wheels\nRain-sensing windshield wipers\nAvailable Active Steering system with speed-sensitive assist\nAvailable adaptive xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights\nAvailable automatic high-beam headlights\nAvailable power moonroof\n\nInterior Highlights\n\n\nSeats five\nManually adjustable front seats; power front seats available\nAvailable leather upholstery\nAvailable heated front and rear seats, heated steering wheel\nAvailable split-folding backseat\nPush-button start\nDual-zone automatic climate control\nTilt/telescoping steering wheel\nCD stereo with HD Radio and USB port\nBluetooth connectivity\nIDrive controller and 6.5-inch screen\nAvailable navigation system\nAvailable Harman Kardon surround-sound stereo\nAvailable sunshades for the rear windows\n\nUnder the Hood\n\n\n180-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (320i)\n180-hp, turbo-diesel 2.0-liter four-cylinder (328d)\n240-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder (328i)\n300-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder (335i)\nEight-speed automatic transmission\nSix-speed manual available\nFuel-saving stop-start technology\n\nSafety Features\n\nAntilock brakes\nElectronic stability system\nSide-impact airbags for the front seats\nSide curtain airbags\nFront knee airbags\nAvailable front and rear parking sensors\nAvailable backup camera\nAvailable lane departure warning\nAvailable blind spot warning system\nAvailable active cruise control with Stop & Go technology\n\n\n3 Series Gran Turismo\nThe 3 Series Gran Turismo is a new four-door coupe like hatchback version of BMW’s compact luxury car. Though styling cues are shared with the 3 Series Sport Wagon, the 3 Series Gran Turismo is a larger car overall, measuring nearly 8 inches longer and more than 3 inches taller. The result is a roomier cabin, especially for backseat passengers who enjoy 2.8 inches of extra legroom, and the front and rear seats are positioned higher for easier entry and exit.\n\n240-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (328i)\n300-hp, turbo 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder (335i)\nEight-speed automatic transmission\nAll-wheel drive\nSplit-folding rear seat\nCargo area has tie-down points, hooks and underfloor storage\n\nBack to top\nActiveHybrid 3\nIntroduced last year, the ActiveHybrid 3 is a 3 Series sedan with a gas/electric hybrid drivetrain.
