      "expert_review": "Many automakers around the world claim to manufacture sports sedans. But to true enthusiasts, there’s only one that truly defines the breed: the BMW 3-series.\n\nIt’s the sports sedan that all automakers aim for, and after a weeklong test drive through good weather and bad, it’s easy to see why.\n\nBMW remade the 3-series for the 1999 model year, available as the 323i and 328i sedans. For the 2000 model year, BMW introduces the coupe variants 323Ci and 328Ci.\n\nCertainly, BMW has never faced stiffer competition than it does now, not only with longtime rival Mercedes-Benz and Audi. Upstarts like VW, Lincoln Cadillac and soon even Jaguar and Lexus will try for a piece of the entry-level sports sedan pie. BMW has responded by lowering prices, adding equipment and even gasp softening the ride.\n\nBut fear not, this is one sedan that is far from flabby around the middle, which is more than you can say about most automotive writers.\n\nWhether coupe or sedan, most enthusiasts know the drill. The 323i gets a 2.5-liter in-line six cylinder, good for 170 horsepower. The 328i gets a 2.8-liter in-line six cylinder with 193 horsepower. That 23 horsepower difference accounts for a good part of the difference in price: $27,560 for the 323i vs. $34,560 for the 328i. Some will find the difference in performance isn’t worth the premium, because with either engine, you’ll get a driving experience that is uniquely BMW.\n\nOther cars can match its performance, but few if any can match its feel of the car as machine and as an extension of the driver. The vehicle willingly and quickly obeys the commands of its captain. The steering is weighty, precise and quick. The engine responds with the sound of expensive machinery, gaining speed with an effortless grace. The brakes quickly and safely stop the car. Take your hands off the steering wheel at highway speeds: the car tracks straight. There aren’t many vehicles that feel like such a natural part of you. Amazing.\n\nIf you think a 0-60 mph time of 7.2 seconds is nothing special, keep in mind this six-cylinder car will do it while delivering almost 23 mpg in the city and 30 mpg on the highway. Both figures are better than the EPA states.\n\nMany would say, it’s good because it’s about the same size as a Toyota Corolla at about twice the price. What else makes it special?\n\nWell, the value argument is one that BMW is sensitive to, so the new 3-series is a better value than before (although we’re speaking in relative terms.)\n\nAnti-lock disc brakes, traction control and stability control are all standard, so are other safety features such as daytime running lights. Side impact airbags supplement the front ones. So this is a safe package for driving fast.\n\nOther niceties include speed sensitive windshield wipers, which adjusts the speed of the wipers based on the speed of the car. Six-way power front seats with position memory, tilt/telescopic steering wheel, automatic climate control, and an on-boar d computer also are standard.\n\nBut, if getting the most features for the least money is your objective, look elsewhere. The standard audio system is an AM/FM/cassette, although leather trim is included when one orders the Premium Package, a $2,900 option that includes wood trim, a power sunroof, front seat lumbar support and an auto-dimming rearview mirror. The test vehicle had the package and went a long way to warming the interior, giving it a more opulent feel.\n\nBut a CD player is still an option. Okay, so a lot of little luxuries are an option. There are plenty of automakers that will provide the appearance of a sports sedan with lots of gizmos without delivering on that promise. BMW provides a truly transforming driving experience.\n\nYou’ll find your surroundings to be an excellent place to go about the business of driving. The leather-wrapped steering wheel can be tilted and telescoped to get an ideal driving position. Each side of the wheel has buttons controlling the a dio system and cruise control. While other automakers attempt this sort of thing, BMW’s solution is the best solution. It doesn’t require removing your eyes from the road. Ditto the turn signal and wiper controls, which can be used without removing your hand from the wheel. The seats are overly firm in the best German tradition. The rear seat is actually habitable for two very understanding friends. There’s more room than before, and the interior is tightly assembled with a total absence of rattles, something you’d expect in this price class. It was also hushed with little wind or road noise.\n\nThe only distraction that detracted from the joy of driving, was the in-dash navigation system. Besides relieving you of an additional $1,800, the system integrates with the radio. The result is you can’t have a factory-installed CD player if you order the navigation system. Why the famed German engineering can’t solve this problem is beyond me. What’s worse, it takes a long look away from the road to operate some radio functions, let alone attempt to disable the navigation system. It seems less user-friendly than other systems. My advice? Skip it and save the money.\n\nWhile other cars come below this car’s $40,345 bottom line, few have the sporting manners that thrill an enthusiast’s soul with the sort of siren song that compels the driver to drive on.\n\nThat’s why BMWs really are the ultimate driving machine.\n\nBMW 328i\n\nEngine: 2.8-liter DOHC 24-valve in-line 6-cylinder\n\nTransmission: 5-speed manual or 5-speed Steptronic automatic\n\nTires: H-rated 205/55R16\n\nWheelbase:107.3 inches\n\nLength: 176 inches\n\nCurb weight: 3,256 pounds\n\nBase price, 323i: $27,560\n\nBase price, test model: $33,970\n\nAs tested: $40,345\n\nEPA rating: 19 city, 27 highway\n\nTest mileage: 22.6 mpg",

      "expert_review": "Many car companies claim to produce sports sedans. They’ll take some lumpy, blobby family boat, strip off the chrome, throw on some sporty tires and a rear deck spoiler, and shout to the multitudes, “OK, we’re sporty now!”\n\nThe reality: Most of these sedans are frumpy family cars with a spoiler that’s as misplaced as Bob Dole in jams. If you really want a sports sedan, this is the one, the modern descendent of the car that defined the genre.\n\nPresenting the 1996 328i.\n\nIf you’re a follower of all cars Bavarian, you’ll note the last digit is three higher than last year. That’s because the fine folks at BMW have enlarged the in-line six-cylinder engine to 2.8 liters. The results might not look dramatic — horsepower is only up by 1 to 190. But torque is up 14 percent, to 207 lb.-ft. It’s also available lower in the rev range.\n\nThe result? Stoplight Andrettis can get across intersections faster than you can say “yuppie wannabe.” There’s lots of juicy power across a broad spectrum, making it more friendly to those who like to leave the shifting to others (but get the five speed; tangoing with this engine can be sweet). Zero-60 times are seven seconds with the manual, 7.7 seconds with the four-speed automatic.\n\nWhat makes a BMW such a blast isn’t just the speed, but the sweet feel of the machinery. You’ll think this car was designed to carve up corners and deliver all relevant information to the driver.\n\nTo employ a much overused phrase, this is a driver’s car. It’s as sporting as any sports car and every bit as agile. The tactile sensations delivered to the driver are only those that help to drive better and, ahem, faster. Exhaust noise at lower speeds is reduced over last year, thanks in part to a new exhaust system. But it still allows you to hear this engine hum its sweet songs at higher speeds.\n\nMileage was good, averaging 23 mpg in an equal mix of city and highway driving.\n\nInside, the driver and passenger are served by very firm bucket seats. They feature prominent side bolsters that keep one well-planted during spirited cornering. But a little more back support would be appreciated, as the seat back felt overly flat.\n\nThe high center console and dash give the car a cockpit-like feel; ditto the vast array of buttons for the automatic climate and the awesome, but optional, 32-watt Harman-Kardon audio system. Other luxurious goodies include retained power, eight-way power front seats, multi-function computer, heated front seats and traction control.\n\nIn case you lose your sense while driving, safety is well taken care of, too. Anti-lock brakes and dual airbags are standard. All-season traction is a must option for the rear-drive 328i. Passenger seat belts have auto-locking retractors to fit child safety seats. To help prevent the lock being picked, the lock now freewheels when anything other than the correct key is inserted into it. Also, the ignition key and switch have an ever-changing electronic coding to help prevent theft.\n\nOn the down side, leather is optional, and you’ll find the back seat tight for most grown people. But this is a s-p-o-r-t-s sedan, and driving pleasure is the value here, not space per square foot.\n\nThe crisp styling and handling of this true sports sedan outshines its competitors. But then, this car doesn’t look like a bloated boat. It doesn’t drive like one, either. If you want a sports sedan, don’t be fooled by imitations.\n\n1996 BMW 328i Standard: 2.8-liter double overhead cam V-6; five-speed manual transmission; four-wheel anti-lock disc brakes; 15×7 alloy wheels, 205/ 65R15 all-season tires; intermittent wipers; dual power mirrors; illuminated master key; eight-way power front seats; information display; leatherette upholstery; leather-covered steering wheel, shift knob and hand-brake grip; wood trim; front cupholders; power locks; power windows; automatic climate control; powe sunroof; 200-watt AM/FM cassette audio system; tool kit; full-size spare. Optional: Automatic transmission, metallic paint, heated front seats and outside mirrors, premium Harman-Kardon audio system, fold-down rear seat, Premium package (leather upholstery, on-board computer), all-season package.

      "expert_review": "Evolution, not revolution, best describes the new version of BMW’s highly popular 328i.\n\nThere was no need for BMW to make drastic changes to this car, which can trace its roots to the classic BMW 2002 of the 1970s. That car, you may remember, firmly established the sports sedan in America.\n\nOf all European automakers, BMW may be in the best position. Its vehicles are synonymous with performance. Its brand image is pure. Say BMW and you automatically think of fast, well-made cars that handle superbly.\n\nThe new 328i carries on that tradition. What few rough edges were present in the old model have been addressed in the new one.\n\nPerformance, handling\n\nBMW engineers stuck with the Bavarian automaker’s traditional inline arrangement for the 2.8-liter, six-cylinder engine, but almost everything else changed.\n\nThe motor in the 1999 328i weighs less and makes more power — a double shot of muscle. The cylinder block is made of aluminum and weighs 51 pounds less than the cast iron block in the 1998 model.\n\nA new intake system and variable valve timing (which ensures that the engine runs at peak efficiency at all speeds) boosts horsepower to 193, up from 190. That might not sound like much of an increase, but don’t forget that the engine weighs less, so it has less work to do. Expect a 0-to-60 mph time of about 6.5 seconds.\n\nOur test car sported a five-speed manual transmission — the best choice for any BMW. Because the car is so solid and well-made, you are tempted to doubt the speedometer. The engine runs smoothly and quietly — but not so much that you can’t detect any sensation from under the hood.\n\nI contend that the precise whisper of the engine and the smooth meshing of European gears give the BMW a bit of character. For those of us who love the mechanical underpinnings of cars, shutting down the radio and listening to the drivetrain is a mechanical symphony just as satisfying as music.\n\nAcceleration is strong and linear, with no peaks and valleys of power. Several times I revved the engine — unintentionally — into the red zone on the tachometer. The electric rev limiter cut in and forced me to ease off on the throttle. But that’s the thing about the new 328i. It is so refined that you can overdo it if you don’t pay attention to the instruments.\n\nT he gearbox is easy to shift. The clutch pedal is fairly light. Because the engine makes so much power, it pulls strongly in all gears, so you may not have to shift as often. The 328i was not tiresome to drive in Orlando’s miserable traffic.\n\nAs for the suspension system, the four-wheel independent layout remains the same. But once again, BMW engineers made a series of small refinements. Some parts are made of aluminum instead of steel, and the width between the front wheels has been increased about three inches, making the car more stable during cornering.\n\nTo me the 1999 328i feels a bit softer than the old model — not that that’s a bad thing. The handling prowess isn’t affected. In the 328i, you can still punch through a tight curve as fast as you dare. The ca r doesn’ t lean much, and the power-assisted, rack-and-pinion steering is quick and tight.\n\nFour-wheel, anti-lock disc brakes are standard. In the past, I have raved about BMW’s brakes. But this time, they didn’t feel as potent as I expected. In fact, the anti-lock system seemed to engage a tad too soon, and the car took a long time to come to a halt on the dirt road and on the grass field where I tested the brakes.\n\nFit and finish\n\nThose paying attention to BMW know the company has been in turmoil recently.\n\nBMW’s British subsidiary, the Rover Group, has been losing hundreds of millions of dollars. Earlier this year, Rover’s massive losses cost BMW’s chief and his lieutenant their jobs.\n\nI couldn’t help but wonder if that influenced the content — make that lack of content — in the 328i. Plastic inserts, bordering on tacky, were installed on the dash, door panels and console where wood inlays were intended.\n\nIt’s as if some BMW cost cutter came in and said nein to the wood panels at the last minute. Now if you want wood, you have to ante up an additional $500.\n\nI also recall that BMWs used to have little motors in the doors that would raise the windows slightly when the doors were closed. This feature sealed the windows against the body extra tightly and closed out wind and road noise. The little motors are gone too. And I never thought I’d see a $36,000 BMW without a sunroof. That’s now a $1,050 option.\n\nThis is not to say that the 328i comes poorly equipped. It still has a very long list of power accessories and luxury features. But I’d be willing to wager that many drivers would trade the power memory seats for a standard sunroof.\n\nThe leather bucket seats were firm, almost painfully so. They don’t flex much when you sit down — but that’s good. When you sink into a seat, blood circulation is impeded and muscle fatigue is the result. After several long trips, I never felt any stress or strain from BMW’s seats.\n\nThe 1999 328i has a bit more interior room in the back. It may be BMW’s smallest sedan, but average-sized adults will be able to travel in comfort.\n\nUp front, BMW’s interior designers have simplified the dash a bit. I can clearly remember sitting in previous BMWs and feeling totally lost because my senses were bombarded with dozens of switches, buttons and controls. This time around, all you have to contend with are the push buttons for the air conditioner and the radio.\n\nThe analog gauges never seem to change. They look the same as they always have, white numbers on a black background. I guess any attempt at flashiness here would make it appear that BMW was trying to be trendy.\n\nI’ve said that I feel BMW and Toyota make the best cars. But a Toyota has not been a wallet-buster come maintenance time. However, BMW has made strides to take the sting out of routine maintenance.\n\nOil change intervals have been lengthened, the clutch is self-adjusting, spark plugs can go 100,000-miles between changes and the optional five-speed automatic transmission has fluid that never needs changing. A ll other scheduled maintenance is paid for by BMW for three years or 36,000 miles.\n\nThe 328i is loaded with safety features, including side-impact air bags and traction control. If you’ve owned a 3-Series BMW before, the new model will be familiar and comfortable. If not, expect to experience a car with superb engineering, classy styling and best-inclass quality.\n\n1999 BMW 328i\n\nBase price: $33,400. Safety: Dual front and side air bags, anti-lock brakes, traction control and side-impact protection. Price as tested: $36,495. EPA rating: 19 mpg city/27 mpg highway. Incentives: None.",

And with your terrific job, the $50,495 sticker may even seem like chump change.\n\nOur test vehicle had the Aegean blue exterior with the Champagne interior. Notice how the ritzy names can make an ordinary person feel like Sharon Stone or Kevin Costner. The fully automatic convertible top means you’ll never chip a nail or mess up your hair implants wrestling with clips or snaps.\n\nFunny thing, though. The owner’s manual says nothing about how to overcome an attack of Catholic guilt or the Puritan ethic while you’re driving your new droptop.\n\nShe: I’m sure you’ve heard of crusty old New Englanders who respond to your “Nice day, isn’t it?” with “Yes, and we’ll pay for it.” I kept thinking of that as I was driving the BMW convertible with the $7,560 luxury package. Yeah, it’s nice, but you sure do pay for it, from the insurance rate on down. And I guess our mission here is to determine whether or not it’s worth it.\n\nHe: The simple answer is no. But that’s coming from a guy who would never spend 50 grand on this car – even if I HAD 50 grand to spend on a car.\n\nShe: I totally disagree. If you can afford the sticker with ease, the BMW will likely prove to be an excellent year-round car that can actually fit four people and feels a lot more solid than many convertibles. What’s wrong with you? You usually jump right into this kind of stuff without thinking twice.\n\nHe: I was merely making an observation on the price. Peel off the sticker, and the 328i is the best four-place convertible in the $30,000-plus class. Of course, the class only includes two competitors – the Audi Cabrio, which is really starting to show its age, and the Saab 900, which has more personality, but doesn’t feel nearly as solid as the BMW. And there’s absolutely nothing in the class from Japan or the United States. My advice here would be to skip the luxury pack and go for the standard model, which lists for $41,390. That makes it a no-brainer.\n\nShe: And MY advice would be to GET the luxury pack, because that’s what gives this particular car all of its charms. You get a specially treated Nappa leather interior that is so much softer than the standard leatherette. In addition, the package includes tasteful walnut trim and chrome accents, plus special paint and body panels. You enthusiasts also get high-performance 225/50ZR16 tires on polished 16-inch sport wheels. My point is, if you’re treating yourself to a BMW convertible, don’t nickel and dime yourself to death on the options.\n\nHe: Yeah, kids, because it takes a lot of nickels and dimes to add up to $7,560. OK, let’s not quibble over the price. Let’s talk about what’s underneath all the glitz. We’re talking pure BMW here – all-independent suspension with gas-filled shocks and stabilizer bars, variable-assist power steering, power four-wh eel disc brakes with standard antilock and one of the best traction-control systems around. In short, this is a car lover’s car, with or without the top. Which, by the way, has been made fully automatic. No snaps or clips to mess with. And I love the BMW one-touch windows.\n\nShe: You need to explain just how terrific this top is. You can raise it by simply turning the key in the exterior door lock and holding it there while the top goes up. That also raises all the windows. And if you’re whining about the price, you’re forgetting that BMW this year is offering free scheduled maintenance for the first three years or 36,000 miles. And they continue to add nice standard features like heated outside mirrors. But I want to add one more big-picture thing for you to think about. The 328i convertible is not a toy like a Mazda Miata. It feels like a real car.\n\nHe: That’s true for both 3-series convertibles, including the four-cylinder 318i, which lists for $33,720. Bimmer loyalists l probably prefer the 2.8-liter twin-cam inline six in the 328. It makes 190 horsepower, which is only five horsepower more than Saab’s turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder. But the BMW six feels lots gutsier at the bottom end, and is so beautifully matched to the five-speed gearbox, you’ll want to drive it all day.\n\nShe: A couple of my friends were a little hesitant about the fact that the BMW is a rear-wheel-drive vehicle, unlike the Saab. Most of the time, that would worry me, especially in slippery or snowy driving. But the standard traction control ought to get you out of most trouble.\n\nHe: BMW’s All Season Traction, as it’s called, automatically reduces engine speed and selectively applies the brakes to the rear wheels until your wheels quit slipping and regain their footing. It is truly amazing. Besides, most enthusiasts I know prefer the more predictable handling and vehicle dynamics you get in a rear-drive performance car.\n\nShe: The only time the BMW disappointed me was on the Fourth of July. Four of us were so excited to be taking a convertible to the fireworks. There we were, with our mini beach chairs, blankets and picnic hamper. But we found we couldn’t get everything in the trunk. And with Paul driving, neither one of our teen-age boys could fit behind him in the rear seat. So we were forced to take the family sedan. Even though this feels like a real car, it doesn’t always function like one. But I felt like that was my fault, like I was putting too many demands on it.\n\nHe: It’s OK to make demands – if you’re a movie star or a bigshot Hollywood producer in your BMW convertible.\n\n1997 BMW 328i Luxury Convertible\n\nType: Front-engine, rear-wheel drive, four-passenger convertible\n\nPrice: Base, $41,390; as tested, $50,495 (inc. $570 destination charge)\n\nWhat’s new for ’97: Traction control and heated outside mirrors now standard on all models; fully automatic power top; restyled grille; free scheduled maintenance for first three years or 36,000 miles\n\nStandard equipment: Variable-assist power steering, all-independent suspension with gas-pressure shocks and stabilizer bars, power four-wheel disc brakes, cast-alloy wheels, all-season radial tires, intermittent wipers, power heated mirrors, cruise control, power front seats, multi-information display, leatherette upholstery, leather-wrapped steering wheel, front armrest, dual cupholders, power one-touch windows, rear defroster, automatic climate control, power convertible top, AM-FM stereo cassette, toolkit, full-size spare tire, power locks\n\nSafety features: Dual front air bags, antilock brakes, traction control\n\nOptions on test vehicle: Onboard computer ($500); metallic paint ($475); luxury package, including Nappa leather interior, walnut trim and gearshift lever, chrome interior accents, special paint, M-Tchnic body panels, forged and polished 16-inch sport wheels with 225/50ZR16 performance tires ($7,560)\n\nEPA fuel economy: 20 mpg city/29 mpg highway\n\nEngine: 2.8-liter I-6; 190-hp at 5300 rpm; 206 lb-ft torque at 3950 rpm\n\nTransmission: Five-speed manual\n\nCompetitors: Audi Cabrio, Saab 900\n\nSpecifications: Wheelbase, 106.3 inches; overall length, 174.5 inches; curb weight, 3362 pounds; legroom, 41.2 inches front/28.1 inches rear; headroom, 38.1 inches front/36.3 inches rear; shoulder room, 53.2 inches front/43.6 inches rear\n\n12-month insurance cost, according to AAA Michigan*: $2,782\n\nWhere built: Dingolfing and Regensburg, Germany\n\n* Rates based on an average family of four from the Livonia area whose primary driver is aged 40 with no tickets who drives 3-10 miles each way to work.

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in April 2013 about the 2013 BMW 328i. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2014, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nWith its exceptional acceleration, handling, braking, gas mileage and interior accommodations, the 2013 BMW 328i is the best luxury sport sedan you can buy. Period.\n\nWhen I evaluated the 3 Series sedan after its 2012 redesign (see the review), I concluded that, for the first time, the 328i was all anybody needed, thanks to its new turbocharged four-cylinder engine. For 2013, what’s new is a more affordable 320i (reviewed separately), an M Sport trim level — and the results of our sport-sedan comparison test, in which the 328i took first place over five other sport sedans less than $46,000 (as equipped).\n\nThis review covers the 328i sedan, which was redesigned for 2012. The coupe, convertible and top-performing M3 versions remain unchanged, but the redesigned wagon hits dealerships this spring as a 2014.\n\nBalance Defined\nTake a look at any Cars.com review and you’ll notice we’re practical, never fixating exclusively on performance. The 328 would have never come out on top in our competition if it didn’t balance its excellent drivability with some mainstream benefits. One example: It had the best observed gas mileage at 28.1 mpg combined. That was 1.7 mpg better than the next-most-efficient Audi A4 2.0T Quattro and 7.7 mpg better than the worst, the Volvo S60 T5 AWD.\n\nThat’s pretty impressive, and only becomes more so when you know the 328i was also the quickest to 60 mph, making it in 6.6 seconds. (All our test cars had automatic transmissions and were clocked with two adults onboard.) It beat the next-best S60 by almost 0.2 second, and the worst, the Mercedes-Benz C250 Sport, by more than 1.6 seconds. The BMW proves that a trade-off between acceleration and mileage — exemplified in our test by the Volvo and Acura TL 3.7 — is no longer a valid excuse.\n\nThe notion of a turbocharged four-cylinder delivering the goods remains difficult to fathom, but direct injection gives the BMW’s 2.0-liter adequate torque at low rpm — long a failing of small engines, even turbocharged ones. There’s nothing wrong with the more powerful 335i, but outside of a racetrack the additional power doesn’t seem necessary. In previous generations, the six-cylinder 328 and 325 versions were too poky. Not anymore. (Any six-cylinder 2013 model 328 that appears in Cars.com’s specs represents the coupe or convertible.)\n\nThough the 328i sedan also comes with a satisfying six-speed manual transmission, we were impressed with our car’s eight-speed automatic. The extra gears allow the 328i to launch confidently off the line without sacrificing efficient cruising.\n\nSpecifications don’t always reflect real-world performance, but it’s likely the Cadillac ATS’ use of a six-speed automatic played a part in its less impressive results in our Challenge, despite the car’s lower weight: The ATS went from zero to 60 mph in 8 seconds and achieved an observed mileage of 25.0 mpg combined.\n\nThe BMW eight-speed delivered smooth, confident shifts and reasonably responsive kickdown. Eco Pro, Comfort and Sport modes vary the accelerator and power-steering responsiveness along with the transmission’s willingness to downshift and hold lower gears.\n\nThe abrupt engine stop/start feature I detailed in my 2012 review remains universally loathed and was habitually switched off by all judges in our Challenge.\n\nBraking\nThe 328i had the shortest braking distance in our test at 118.9 feet, 3.7 feet shorter than the next closest, the A4. But panic braking isn’t something you deal with on a regular basis (I hope!); all the cars stopped short enough to be reasonably safe. What also matters is how the brakes feel, and here again the 328i beat the others, with effortless stopping power, good pedal feel and linearity on both application and release.\n\nI was most pleased by the transmission’s transparency; in BMW’s larger cars, “EfficientDynamics” provisions include a Brake Energy Regeneration feature that causes the transmission to downshift awkwardly through the gears during routine braking, causing uneven braking response.\n\nRide & Handling\nOur test car was the new M Sport Line, which joins last year’s trim levels: base, regular Sport Line (no “M”), Luxury Line and Modern Line, which are treated as option packages when you order. The most expensive such package at $3,850, M Sport adds a sport suspension along with 18-inch wheels and summer tires; a more menacing front end and enhanced aerodynamics; different exterior and interior trim; and some “M” badging, which attempts to steal some cachet from true performers like the M3.\n\nWithout a doubt, the M Sport suspension sharpened the 328i’s reflexes without sacrificing ride quality too much. Though the ATS’ handling wowed us, the 328i was still the champ with precise steering, excellent front/rear balance and driftability that begged us to drive it hard. The BMW wasn’t unique in having rear-wheel drive; half of our Challenge contestants had it too, but it’s tough to beat rear-wheel drive when it’s well-executed. (As of 2013, the 3 Series sedan once again offers all-wheel drive as well, called xDrive.)\n\nThe only real complaint is how the 3 Series has less overall “feel” than previous generations, but that’s not a new gripe, and the BMW stood up well among its current competition.\n\nInterior\nAfter driving the 328i, our judges began to express a willingness to overlook other shortcomings. Truth be told, we didn’t find many. Though not as large as the Acura on the outside, it has good interior space, including serviceable front-seat legroom, above-average backseat legroom and the most front- and rear-seat headroom in our comparison test. The trunk was also the largest at 13 cubic feet.\n\nThe 3 Series sedan now has a standard 40/20/40-split folding backseat, making it one of the only cars in this class where it’s included at no charge — a change from the previous 328 generation. That’s right; even lower-priced luxury cars often give you the opportunity to pay for features that are standard from more modest brands. Another eye-opener for new shoppers is that most of these cars have imitation leather upholstery rather than the real thing in their base models (the A4 is an exception). For what it’s worth, the imitation stuff is often convincing and may age more gracefully. Leather comes in all the 328i’s Line packages, including our M Sport.\n\nThe interior quality was universally respected, if not always loved, and I think BMW does a good job offering different approaches in its various Lines. While the base model is austere, each of the others is classier and suits a particular taste, from classic — with wood trim — to contemporary or sporty with more metal and a cooler color palette.\n\nEven at our car’s $45,745 as-tested price (including the destination charge), it didn’t include a backup camera or navigation system; neither did three of the other five cars in our Challenge, though they’re optional on all of them. For all the grief BMW legitimately earned for its iDrive multifunction controller in its earlier years, it’s not so bad now, especially in our car’s simple, non-navigation version. We’re less impressed with turn-signal and gear-selector levers that spring back to center rather than stay in place. They’re awkward and sacrifice desirable tactile feedback while adding no apparent improvement.\n\nFeatures\nConspicuously absent from our 328i was Bluetooth streaming audio capability, which comes only with the navigation option. Standard equipment in the base model includes keyless access, auto-dimming rearview and heated side mirrors, HomeLink, rain-sensing windshield wipers, headlight washers, dual-zone automatic climate control, 17-inch alloy wheels, a 40/20/40-split folding backseat and a four-year, 50,000-mile free regular maintenance warranty — generous for this class.\n\nOptions include adaptive cruise control, in-vehicle assistance (similar to GM’s OnStar), adaptive headlights, parking assist, an adaptive suspension, a moonroof, shift paddles for the automatic transmission and active-safety features that are detailed in the next section.\n\nA 328i sedan loaded with every possible extra-cost option, including all-wheel drive, comes to $57,370.\n\nSafety\nThe 2013 3 Series sedan was named a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, having scored Good in frontal, side, rear and roof-strength tests. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration rated the sedan and wagon with five out of five stars.\n\nStandard safety equipment includes frontal airbags, front knee airbags and side curtain airbags that protect front and rear occupants in side impacts. The front seats also have side-impact airbags and active head restraints. As is required of all 2012 and later models, the 3 Series includes antilock brakes and an electronic stability system with traction control.\n\nBlind spot detection, a backup camera, side/top-view cameras and proximity sensors come in an optional Driver Assistance Package. A lane departure warning system is also optional.\n\n328i in the Market\nPerhaps the most difficult thing for car reviewers to do is put themselves in the shoes of likely buyers — or who we suspect are likely buyers. There’s no doubt, people will pay extra for a luxury name. But what name will they pay for? And how much? Some of my colleagues suggested the 328i’s price is inflated because of its brand. I’m going to dissent.\n\nYes, our test car was one of the most expensive in the Challenge, even without navigation and some other features, but it was reasonably well-equipped and accommodating, and no other car made us as gleeful behind the wheel. That’s not worth paying for?\n\nIf any car in our test was guilty of a luxury markup, it was the Mercedes C250 — the car that came in last place due to many disappointments and omissions and that had an as-equipped cost of $42,355 — fourth highest in the Challenge. Few of its shortfalls were simply features that could have been added to bring the car to parity.\n\nMany believe the 3 Series outsells its competitors due to momentum, because BMW essentially created the luxury sport-sedan segment. That might be part of it, but I also believe average buyers, whether they realize it or not, respond to the feel of a well-engineered driving machine, to use BMW’s own term. Drivability matters, and the 3 Series delivers it — plus a lot more.\n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "BMW plans to roll out a new version of the 3-Series sedan later this summer. Unfortunately, the coupe and convertible will not be replaced until sometime next year.\n\nThat’s too bad.\n\nI logged nearly 400 miles in a 1998 328i Convertible recently and came away from it mostly unimpressed. The 328i Convertible is outdated compared with recent models from Saab, Mercedes-Benz and the upcoming Volvo C70.\n\nThere’s nothing seriously wrong with 328i technically or with the way it is assembled. But the car lacks the refinement of some of the competitors in its class. And the interior seems particularly dated.\n\nThen there’s the issue of the price. This is an expensive car. Tack on a few options, and you’re looking at a $44,000 price tag. But it really doesn’t end there. Factor in luxury and sales taxes and interest on the loan, and most buyers are going to pay more than $50,000 for this car.\n\nDespite the fact that I enjoyed driving the 328i Convertible, I could not find enough value in it to justify such a large expense.\n\nPERFORMANCE, HANDLING\n\nThe 1998 BMW 328i Convertible comes with a silky smooth 190-horsepower, inline, six-cylinder engine. It’s a 2.8-liter engine that has double overhead cams and 24 valves. Our test car came with a five-speed manual transmission.\n\nAs you might expect from a BMW, the 328i Convertible has plenty of verve. There are no peaks and valleys as the engine revs. The power comes on strong and just keeps building. If you like mechanical noises, you’ll love the way the 2.8-liter six sounds when you make it work. You hear a smooth whoosh from under the hood.\n\nDriving this car in heavy city traffic is not bothersome. The clutch pedal takes little effort to operate and the five-speed manual transmission is easy to shift. If you want an automatic transmission (most people do), add another grand to the price. I would describe the 328i’s drivetrain as technically excellent. The same can’t be said for the suspension system, however.\n\nAlthough the 328i is outfitted with a four-wheel independent suspension system, it seems as if BMW made the 328i a bit too luxurious. The ride is softer than you might expect. The 328i still sticks to the road tenaciously when asked to perform gymnastic maneuvers, but it doesn’t feel as lithe and athletic as other BMWs I’ve driven. Perhaps the 250 pounds of additional weight for the convertible top and frame reinforcements have dulled the sharpness of the ride.\n\nHowever, the four-wheel, anti-lock disc brakes are truly awesome. And the power-assisted, engine-speed sensitive, rack-and-pinion steering system is crisp and responsive.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nThe 328i is a small mid-size car with a leather and wood-trimmed interior and a full menu of power accessories. It’s a nicely designed and built machine, but it’s overpriced.\n\nI don’t care that the power top rises and lowers at the touch of a button. It makes no difference to me that the seats can be heated or that you can turn off the traction control. I don’t care about the CD player or the alarm system or the cruise control. No matter what is stuffed into this car, it isn’t worth $50,000. I’d buy a Plymouth Prowler, Porsche Boxster or Mercedes-Benz SLK long before I’d drop 50 big ones on this car.\n\nNow let’s talk about how well it is built. The 328i is a top-quality machine that is bolted together tightly. I could find no flaws in the way the car was assembled. But some of the parts, such as the squarish dash and the small buttons on the air conditioner and radio, made the car seem dated.\n\nGetting in and out of the back seat was inconvenient. However, there’s adequate room back there for average-sized adults, and BMW gets credit for keeping the trunk at an acceptable size.\n\nThe leather-trimmed seats are firm and comfortable. Numerous power adjustments make it easy to get comfortable quickly. Turn up the powerful radio, and you can make your ear drums bleed.\n\nNevertheless, if you’d like to drive a BMW convertible, the Z3 roadster represents a far better value. That doesn’t mean I’d like to see the 328i become extinct. Not everyone can make do with a two-seater. Hopefully, BMW will figure out a way to add more value to the next 328i Convertible.\n\nSpecifications: Base price: $41,500. Safety: Dual front and side air bags, automatic roll bars, side-impact protection, anti-lock brakes, traction control and front and rear crumple zones. Price as tested: $44,745. EPA rating: 20 mpg city/28 mpg highway. Incentives: None.\n\nTruett’s tip: Though BMW’s 328i Convertible is a fast and fun car, it is starting to show its age. Also, at $44,000 and change, it lacks value.",

      "expert_review": "Verdict: The BMW 328i remains a sport-oriented enthusiast sedan with the latest updates sharpening its reflexes, if not its styling.\n\nVersus: Every major luxury brand has a 3 Series competitor, but few can match the BMW’s mix of sporty handling and well-tuned ride. The Mercedes-Benz C-Class is fancier, the Lexus IS is uglier, the Infiniti Q50 is blander and the Audi A4 is skewed toward a cushier experience. The Cadillac ATS comes closest, at a lower price, but its flaw is a cheaper interior.\n\nThe BMW 3 Series always has been the sportiest of the compact luxury sedans, the one enthusiasts would turn to time and again for a dose of entertainment with their entry-level luxury. But these are no longer entry-level luxury vehicles, with the 3 Series and its competitors now sold alongside smaller entries from their own manufacturers. As such, many of them have gotten softer and more luxurious, including the BMW 3 Series.\n\nThe most hardcore enthusiasts have lamented this development for the 3 Series, and BMW has responded for 2016 with some minor updates. The BMW 3 Series still offers a wide variety of models, including the 328i sedan and wagon, 335, 340 and M3, as well as coupe versions that now are called the 4 Series. There are also 3 Series Grand Turismo quasi-wagons and 4 Series Gran Coupé quasi-sedan versions. We list them all separately on Cars.com to make searching a bit easier. Changes for 2016 have been limited mostly to the chassis tuning and an additional engine (in the 340), with just a few barely noticeable exterior updates (compare the 2015 and 2016 here).\n\nHave the tweaks sharpened BMW’s volume player, or is this knife still duller than it should be?\n\nExterior & Styling\nOnly the most hardcore fans of the brand will be able to tell the 2015 model from the 2016, with changes limited to some chrome. But the 3 Series can be had with a bunch of different option packages, many of which come with appearance items. My 328i test car had the M Sport Package, which blacks out much of the exterior trim and adds a more aggressive body kit, making for a sportier look. A blacked-out grille and some rather expensively silly “M Performance” decals down the side put the look a little over the top, however, pushing past sporty and getting into gaudy. Still, you know it’s an attractive car when it looks good even in metallic white, a color that doesn’t work on every automaker’s offerings.\n\nHow It Drives\nPowering the 328i is a turbocharged 2.0-liter inline 4-cylinder engine making 240 horsepower and 258 pounds-feet of torque. It’s mated to a six-speed manual or eight-speed automatic transmission; my test car featured the excellent automatic. Paddle shifters are available, but like most people, I used them only once to try them and then let the automatic do my shifting for me. It’s extremely well tuned, and its behavior is adjustable with the BMW Drive Select feature to set it how you like it in terms of sportiness versus eco-friendliness. Power and response from the 2.0-liter engine is extraordinary — it easily feels more powerful than its rating, providing rapid acceleration with a quick stab of the pedal. Pop the Driving Dynamics Control into one of two sport modes and the car wakes up even more, making for spirited, responsive fun that’s thoroughly enjoyable.\n\nSteering feel is improved as well, with a retuned program for the electric power steering and, in my test car, the optional Variable Sport Steering, which changes the steering ratio based on what you’re asking the car to do. Whether you think the steering feel is sharp enough largely depends on how familiar you are with BMWs from 20 years ago. Does it feel as directly connected as prior generations of the 3 Series? No, but it still outperforms just about any other automaker in terms of feel, feedback and input-to-response, with the exception of maybe Cadillac. The ride and handling balance of the 3 Series still is among the best in the business, with new suspension bits combining with that updated steering program to make the 3 Series much more entertaining to drive than competitors such as the Audi A4, Mercedes-Benz C-Class or Infiniti Q50. The only real challenger these days is American — the Cadillac ATS is lighter than the 3 Series, just as powerful and is tuned to be even sportier than the traditionally sporty German brands.\n\nThe reason for just about every automaker going with smaller, turbocharged engines is fuel economy — and the 328i delivers, with an EPA fuel economy rating of 23/35/27 mpg city/highway/combined that’s competitive. The BMW 3 Series achieves this in part due to its eight-speed automatic transmission and a stop-start engine function, which now works much more smoothly than in the past. Competitors with 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engines are better on fuel efficiency in some ways, worse in others: The Mercedes-Benz C300 achieves 25/34/28 mpg, while the Cadillac ATS 2.0T mysteriously gets a worse 22/31/26 mpg. The front-wheel-drive Audi A4 2.0T gets 24/31/27 mpg.\n\nInterior\nThere haven’t been many changes to the 3 Series’ interior — it remains a comfortable, well-done environment that mixes premium materials with some hard plastic bits that look good but feel chintzy. Taken on its own, the BMW 3 Series sedan interior is attractive, but put it up against even the base trim of the Mercedes-Benz C-Class and it’s outclassed. As with the Mercedes-Benz, leather upholstery is not standard — you get a leatherlike vinyl unless you pony up extra cash for real cowhide. The BMW’s seats are very comfortable and highly adjustable, and there’s adequate legroom front and rear for four people (five is tight in back; this is a compact car after all). Outward visibility is good, with no glaring blind spots and a low belt line that also helps maintain an airiness to the cabin. The M Sport Package brings a few changes to the interior, including a meatier sport steering wheel and more aggressively bolstered seats. Anthracite wood trim and black leather seats made my test car’s cabin look much more businesslike than luxurious, but other option packages are available to lux it up if that’s your preference.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nBMW switches and controls feel sophisticated and expensive, 3 Series included. Everything is logically laid out, easy to reach and operates in a smooth, fluid manner. The gauges are large and easy to read, and they are among the more traditional styling elements that BMW has kept largely unchanged throughout recent history. A head-up display was included as part of the Technology Package.\n\nSimilar design and function can be found in the Mercedes-Benz C300 and Audi A4, but competitor Cadillac goes a different route, eliminating almost all switches and buttons in favor of touch-sensitive capacitive panels that impart no sense of luxury. Buttons are unequivocally better, and the 3 Series’ are quite nice. A nine-speaker audio system is standard, but my car featured a Harman Kardon 16-speaker system that sounded quite good.\n\nThe car’s multimedia system also is one of the better ones available, with a display screen mounted high and easy to read at a glance. Some complain that its appearance looks tacked on, but there’s no denying that it works well. It’s not a touch-screen — the controller rests on the center console between the seats where your hand naturally falls. Once one gets a little practice in navigating menus, it’s no better or worse in function than the Mercedes-Benz Comand controller system, and seems decidedly faster than the Cadillac User Experience touch-screen system. Cadillac does have an advantage, however, in that it offers Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, both of which are top-notch multimedia systems based on smartphone integration. The gold standard in luxury-brand multimedia remains Audi’s system, however, with its  intuitive controls and quick responses.\n\nCargo & Storage\nDespite being classified as a compact car, the 3 Series is decently roomy for both passengers and cargo. The 328i comes with a 13.0-cubic-foot trunk, the largest of the four competitors — the Mercedes-Benz C-Class has 12.6 cubic feet and the Audi A4 has a comparable 12.4 cubic feet, but the Cadillac ATS is a bit dinky with only 10.4 cubic feet. The Germans all have standard split folding seatbacks, but the ATS comes with a standard folding rear bench.\n\nSafety\nThe BMW 3 Series has received an overall five-star crash-test rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, but got a marginal rating in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s front small overlap test (from a possible good, acceptable, marginal or poor). In the small overlap test, the A4 scored poorly. The ATS and C-Class haven’t been fully tested by IIHS yet, but all three competitors earned five stars overall in government testing. See how the BMW 3 Series performed here.\n\nLike most German luxury cars, most of the BMW 3 Series’ electronic safety features cost extra. Despite costing nearly $55,000, my car did not feature electronic systems that can be found on cars costing $30,000 less, such as forward collision warning, autonomous braking, lane departure warning or blind spot warning.  A backup camera and parking sensors come in a $950 Driver Assistance Package, and the rest of those features can be had for another $1,700 in the Driver Assistance Plus option. All of these various systems are available in packages or as stand-alone options, but they do add considerably to the bottom line. See what comes standard here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nIn many ways, the BMW 3 Series has been the benchmark for this category, the best-seller and the model that other automakers long have sought to catch. Everything from its equipment to its pricing strategy have been closely matched by others, which makes comparisons pretty simple. The 320i is the starting point for the BMW 3 Series, which includes a 180-hp, 2.0-liter turbo motor for $34,145. Stepping up to the 328i, with its more powerful 240-horsepower motor, begins at $39,345. This doesn’t include a lot of extras, however, and the price can quickly climb. My test car was a 328i with the M Sport Package (18-inch wheels, sport seats, aero kit, dark exterior trim), Driver Assistance Package (backup camera, parking sensors), Premium Package (keyless entry, moonroof, satellite radio), Technology Package (navigation, head-up display, remote concierge and online access), and Track Handling Package (M Sport brakes, adaptive suspension and variable steering) and more for an as-tested total of $54,875. It doesn’t end there, however — you can option the 328i up to more than $60,000 if you click every box.\n\nCompetitors are priced similarly. The Mercedes-Benz C300 features similar content but a more luxurious interior, starting at $39,875. Both the Cadillac ATS and Audi A4 start at lower prices. The ATS can be had with a 2.5-liter non-turbocharged motor, but this model typically is found only in rental fleets. Base price starts at $34,210, but a comparable turbocharged ATS also is less expensive than the new BMW or Benz, starting at $36,240. The Audi A4 starts at $36,825 for the front-wheel-drive model, but even the all-wheel-drive Quattro version starts less than the rear-wheel-drive BMW, at $37,925.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nBMW’s compact 3 Series is the luxury automaker’s bread-and-butter model. It’s available as a sedan, Gran Turismo hatchback or wagon. Numerous drivetrains are offered, including hybrid and diesel versions. The five-seat 3 Series comes with rear- or all-wheel drive and competes with the Audi A4, Cadillac ATS and Mercedes-Benz C-Class. The coupe and convertible that formerly were part of the 3 Series lineup are now designated the 4 Series under BMW’s current nomenclature.\n\n(Skip to details on the: 3 Series Gran Turismo, ActiveHybrid 3)\nNew for 2015\n\nM Sport brakes are no longer available on the 328d. The keyless entry feature that’s part of the available Premium Package on the wagon and Gran Turismo now includes hands-free liftgate closing.\n \nThe below is a list of highlighted features and not an exhaustive list. Features are standard unless otherwise noted.\nExterior Highlights\n\nDifferent grille, side mirror and tailpipe treatments distinguish the Sport, Luxury and M Sport “lines”\n17-inch alloy wheels; available 18- or 19-inch wheels\nRain-sensing windshield wipers\nAvailable variable sport steering with speed-sensitive assist\nAvailable adaptive xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights\nAvailable automatic high-beam headlights\nAvailable power moonroof\n\nInterior Highlights\n\nSeats five\nManually adjustable front seats; power front seats available\nAvailable leather upholstery\nAvailable heated front and rear seats, heated steering wheel\nAvailable split-folding backseat\nPush-button start\nDual-zone automatic climate control\nTilt/telescoping steering wheel\nCD stereo with HD Radio and USB port\nBluetooth connectivity\nIDrive controller and 6.5-inch screen\nAvailable navigation system\nAvailable Harman Kardon surround-sound stereo\nAvailable sunshades for the rear windows\n\nUnder the Hood\n\n180-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (320i)\n180-hp, turbo-diesel 2.0-liter four-cylinder (328d)\n240-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder (328i)\n300-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder (335i)\nEight-speed automatic transmission\nSix-speed manual available at no cost\nFuel-saving stop-start technology\n\nSafety Features\n\nRequired in every new car: front airbags, antilock brakes and an electronic stability system\nSide-impact airbags for the front seats\nSide curtain airbags\nFront knee airbags\nAvailable front and rear parking sensors\nAvailable backup camera\nAvailable lane departure warning\nAvailable blind spot warning system\nAvailable adaptive cruise control with Stop & Go technology\n\n3 Series Gran Turismo\n\nThe 3 Series Gran Turismo is a four-door, coupelike hatchback version of BMW’s compact luxury car. Though styling cues are shared with the 3 Series Sport Wagon, the Gran Turismo is a larger car overall, measuring nearly 8 inches longer and more than 3 inches taller. The result is a roomier cabin, especially for backseat passengers who get 2.8 inches of extra legroom.

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review, published in February 2012, originally cited EPA mileage estimates of 24/36 mpg city/highway for the 2012 BMW 328i sedan equipped with an automatic transmission. In a rare revision roughly one month later, the EPA lowered the rating to 23/33 mpg, as reflected in the updated review below. Mileage estimates for the manual 328i and all versions of the 335i sedan remain unchanged.\n\nIf the sport-sedan category were high school, the BMW 3 Series would be the captain of the football team, and maybe the debate squad … and the chess club. It’s popular (typically selling 90,000-100,000 units annually in the U.S.), and everyone wants to be like it (Cadillac is only the most recent example, boldly pitting its upcoming ATS sedan against the 3 Series in advertisements). And so it has always been.\n\nA classed-up, roomier interior, more power and substantially improved gas mileage breathe new life into the redesigned 2012 BMW 3 Series sedan, which should continue to dominate the sport-sedan market.\n\nOnly the 3 Series’ sedan version has been redone, entering its sixth generation in 328i and 335i guise. The coupe, convertible and ultimate-performance M3 will continue for two more model years in their current form. The previous-generation wagon is being sold as a 2012, and a redesign will come within the next year.\n\nOn sale now, the 2012 sedans come only with rear-wheel drive. Fall 2012 will see the addition of all-wheel-drive versions, with the “xi” suffix, along with the first-ever hybrid 3 Series, the ActiveHybrid3 sedan. The 335d clean-diesel variant is now out of production, but it will likely return once BMW develops a new four-cylinder diesel engine.\n\nAs of the sedan’s launch, the 328i and 335i both come in a base trim level plus three “lines” — Modern, Luxury and Sport. Each is an option package with its own interior theme and exterior cosmetic tweaks. The Sport Line adds a few performance-oriented changes, as well. I tested all these versions.\n\nAutumn will bring a new trim level, called M Sport, with a more aggressive exterior and sport-themed interior touches. BMW is mum on the details, but M Sport packages typically include some performance enhancements, such as a sportier suspension.\n\nExterior & Styling\nBMW has closed the book on an awkward design era helmed by American-born chief designer Chris Bangle. The outgoing 3 Series is arguably the one BMW car that escaped more than a glancing blow from the Bangle ugly stick. Regardless, I still think the 2012 sedan improves on it, though plenty of observers deemed it too plain. The way the headlight assemblies flow into the more three-dimensional grilles gives the car a broad look that belies a slight decrease in width compared with the 2011. The car is almost 4 inches longer. The light clusters themselves improve on other recent BMW redesigns: Rather than a translucent-white eyelash that looks like it was meant to be removed after shipping, each of the new car’s headlights has a more pleasing silver stripe with LED accents.\n\nThe trim level determines the number and finish of the grille slats, with gloss black designating Sport, and chrome trim demarcating Luxury. Modern splits the difference with a brushed-aluminum look. The trim on the lower air intakes also varies among the three. The M Sport trim level will bring a more aggressive front end with larger grille openings, M-badged wheels and flared rocker panels.\n\nDrivetrain Revolution\nThe biggest news for the 2012 sedan is its improved drivetrains, including the 328i model’s new engine, whose power and efficiency is better than that of the 2011 328i. That’s despite it having a four-cylinder engine in place of an inline-six-cylinder — something BMW hasn’t sold here since 1999’s 318i. What’s different about this engine? Direct injection, variable valve timing and a twin-scroll turbocharger — technologies that BMW groups together and calls “TwinPower Turbo.”\n\nEquipped with either a six-speed manual or a new eight-speed automatic transmission, the 328i takes off with authority. You’d never know you were driving a four-cylinder, and definitely not a turbo four. The torque is almost immediate. Though the power rating has increased only 10 horsepower over the 2011 sedan, to 240 hp, torque is up 60 pounds-feet, to 260, and it comes at 1,250 rpm, down from 2,750 rpm. (See the two model years compared.)\n\nSure enough, when I drove an automatic 328i on the highway, even when climbing moderate inclines the tachometer needle hovered below 1,500 rpm. Brilliant. This explains the automatic’s EPA-estimated 23/33 mpg city/highway, a healthy increase from 2011’s 18/28 mpg with either transmission. The six-speed-manual sedan has a 1 mpg advantage on the highway: 23/34 mpg. There’s another upside to the stick: a slightly faster zero-to-60 mph time, according to BMW. It hits 60 in 5.7 seconds, and the automatic takes 5.9 seconds. It’s no longer a given that a manual is quicker, and while the BMW eight-speed shifts quickly, it’s not the type of dual-clutch transmission that always shifts faster than a human could. And because the manual has taller gears, you can hit 60 mph after just one gear change.\n\nBear in mind that we’re talking about the 328i here, not the more powerful 335i, whose drivetrain is unchanged versus 2011 but for the eight-speed automatic replacing the earlier six-speed. Its turbocharged, 3.0-liter inline-six engine produces 300 hp and 300 pounds-feet of torque. You feel and hear the difference with the six-cylinder’s greater urgency and pleasing exhaust note. (The 328i sounds respectable when accelerating, but at idle it has a faint diesel sound. While direct-injection engines perform well, their mechanical sound is often raucous.) BMW rates the 335i’s zero-to-60 time at 5.4 seconds.\n\nClass-Leading Mileage\nThe 328i’s estimated combined city/highway mileage is 26 mpg, or 27 with the manual, compared with 22 mpg for either transmission in 2011. For comparison, the most efficient versions of the Audi A4 and Mercedes-Benz C-Class are rated 25 mpg, despite their lesser power. The 335i also gets a bump for 2012, from 19/28 to 20/30 mpg with the manual and from 19/28 to 23/33 mpg with the automatic. With a combined 26 mpg, the automatic 335i beats the comparable Mercedes C350’s 23 mpg and Infiniti G37’s 22 mpg.\n\nSometimes dramatic mileage improvements come with tradeoffs, but the 3 Series’ are few. As I detailed in my 5 Series review, BMW’s Efficient Dynamics provisions include regenerative braking, whereby the car’s alternator charges its battery when coasting and braking but decouples from the engine when accelerating. In the 5 Series, overly aggressive regeneration with the automatic transmission resulted in nonlinear braking unbefitting the “ultimate driving machine.” Blessedly, this doesn’t seem to be the case with the 2012 3 Series.\n\nAs noted, the car is quicker than ever. The eight-speed shifts quickly and smoothly, and it doesn’t hesitate too long before kicking down to pass, especially when in the Driving Dynamics Control’s selectable Comfort or Sport modes, which also vary the accelerator and power steering responsiveness. A new Eco Pro mode makes the accelerator resistant to accelerating (unless you floor it) and the transmission quick to upshift to more efficient gears. It also puts at the bottom of the tachometer a simple gauge to help you drive conservatively. The 3 Series’ product manager said he achieved 41 mpg on the highway in this mode by “hypermiling,” a strategy known alternately as “clogging traffic” and “driving like a pansy.”\n\nIt looks like we’re moving past the era when low-rolling-resistance tires could be called traction resistant. Despite having the word “efficient” in their name, the Goodyear EfficientGrip 18-inch summer tires delivered on the “grip” aspect as well. (Continental ContiSport Contact and Pirelli Cinturato tires were also fitted to test cars; multiple brands are supplying original-equipment rubber.) That’s one more step forward for efficiency without the usual step back.\n\nMinor Mileage Tradeoff\nThe one failure among the mileage provisions is the standard auto start-top feature that shuts the engine off at a complete stop and restarts it when you take your foot off the brake (automatic transmission) or depress the clutch (manual). The best thing I can say about auto stop-start is that it couldn’t be simpler to turn off: The defeat button is adjacent to the engine-start button. You’ll probably make good use of it, because the engines restart awkwardly. The 335i is smoother than the 328i, but neither compares to the smoothness we’ve come to expect from hybrids. Even Porsche’s conspicuous start-stop feature is better than this. Where those sound and feel comparatively seamless, the 3 Series sounds and feels like an engine being started, and does so with more vibration than when you push the starter button after getting in the car.\n\nAs I say frequently these days, and consistently about updated BMW models, you don’t need the engine upgrade. The 328i will probably further diminish the 335’s share of sales — roughly 30 percent at the end of the 2011 model year. However, the difference between the two is clear: The 335i is substantially more exciting. If you have any intention of driving your 3 Series on a racetrack, this is the better one. On California’s Laguna Seca, I consistently found myself braking too late in the 328i, trying desperately to hold onto the speed I’d worked to build. The 335i had the extra guts needed to achieve appropriate speeds.\n\nSofter, But Still BMW\nLike many recent BMW redesigns, the 3 Series has been softened. The regular suspension in the base, Modern and Luxury lines isolates road imperfections better than the previous generation did, but it also allows more body motions, including a surprising degree of body roll — something that’s no longer an unavoidable tradeoff. Regardless, the car retains its legendary front/rear balance after mild understeer going into corners.\n\nThe redesign replaces conventional hydraulic power steering with electric power assist. Of its type, it’s well-executed. I wouldn’t say it’s quite as good as the old standard in terms of feedback, but the assist level isn’t erratic with speed changes, as some electric systems are. Speaking of erratic, the controversial active-steering option has been discontinued, replaced by a more straightforward variable-ratio steering option that gives more steering angle from less turn of the wheel.\n\nThe Sport Line sits 10 mm lower on a firmer suspension arrangement. This is also the only version eligible for an adaptive suspension, a $900 option, which I drove. It feels more like the earlier generation, with better body control and livable ride quality. The Sport setting is notably firmer than Comfort, but not as punishing as early examples of this technology.\n\nTo be frank, for a car BMW claims is purchased primarily for its athletic driving experience, all 3 Series versions could get away with the Sport Line’s firmer ride.\n\nIn the Cabin\nSpeaking of getting away with things, how do cars like the 3 Series and Mercedes-Benz C-Class get away with imitation-leather seats in their base trim levels? It’s convincing vinyl, but still. Imitation-metal trim also blows the base 3’s cover, but the finishes are otherwise high-quality. Soft-touch surfaces extend all the way down to the lowest door panels.\n\nAll three trim lines dial up the quality with leather upholstery, though in the 328i, power adjustments come bundled with other features in a separate $3,600 option package. Power seats are standard in the 335i. The Sport Line has sport front seats with more prominent side bolsters. The aluminum trim in the Sport Line is patterned and textured — something I’d expect from Audi, and that’s a good thing. The Modern Line I tested had beige gauge faces to match the color palette, and “open-pored” wood trim, which has raised grain as if it’s been rubbed down, creating what looks like sand drifts. I like the idea because it’s so unique, but it doesn’t look like real wood. Perhaps a light stain would be a better approach.\n\nThe front seats have nice, long travel for plenty of legroom. The 2012’s added overall length and wheelbase go right to backseat legroom, which was badly needed. Legroom still comes at the mercy of front-seat occupants, but I won’t penalize BMW for having generous front seat travel. The floor is high enough to raise your knees more than I appreciate, but short trips — and shorter passengers — should be fine.\n\nErgonomic Hits & Misses\nThe design and layout are characteristically simple but more stylish than the previous generation. There are ergonomic hits and misses. The big hit: After a history of half-assed spring-loaded cupholders, BMW has finally given in and incorporated two functional wells in the center console close to the dashboard. As if embarrassed by this sop to American thirst, BMW supplies a removable cover that hides them and doubles as a tray for “oddments.”\n\nThe Driving Dynamics Control buttons are now a rocker switch in the style of other recent BMW redesigns. It allows you to cycle through the various modes without pushing a bunch of separate buttons. The iDrive multifunction controller is now standard with a 6.5-inch display, and, similar to the cupholders, BMW has finally gotten it right. (The navigation option adds an 8.8-inch screen.) Though it’s not my favorite, the manual shifter improves on the previous generation’s. It feels more connected.\n\nUnfortunately, the new 3’s automatic transmission still has the springy toggle-style gear selector, and the turn-signal stalk similarly springs back to center rather than staying in position until the turn is complete. If there’s a benefit to this design, it isn’t the driver’s.\n\nThe trunk is now a respectable 13.7 cubic feet, up from 12 in the previous generation. Less respectable is having to pay extra for a folding backseat — another infraction for which BMW and Mercedes are never prosecuted. In the upcoming ActiveHybrid3, the optional folding backseat is completely unobstructed, making it one of the only hybrid sedans to accomplish this goal.\n\nConnectivity\nBy today’s standards, the 3 Series’ connectivity and iPhone integration is extensive, and includes standard BMW Assist, similar to GM’s OnStar. In a car with the BMW Apps option, an iPhone with the free BMW Connected app allows many features to be controlled by iDrive: Web Radio, Pandora and MOG internet radio, a calendar, Twitter, Facebook and Last Mile. No other Smartphones are currently supported.\n\nSafety\nAs of its introduction, the 2012 3 Series hadn’t been crash-tested. Standard safety equipment includes frontal airbags and side curtains that protect front and rear occupants in side impacts. The front seats also have side-impact airbags and active head restraints. As is required of all 2012 and later models, the 3 Series includes antilock brakes and an electronic stability system with traction control.\n\n3 Series in the Market\nThough the 2012 3 Series has been softened a bit, it remains a leader in drivability and, now, in mileage, with no accompanying compromise. Combine this with its strong reputation and a brand cachet that companies like Audi, Cadillac and Infiniti haven’t achieved, and it seems untouchable. The 3 Series sells almost as many units annually as the Audi A4 and Mercedes C-Class combined, and I see no reason to expect a change.\n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "No one could have anticipated the pastel-colored monster BMW would help create 30 years ago when it introduced the 3 Series to North America.\n\nA whole generation of young urban professionals spent the ’80s equating prestige and repute with buying ugly clothes and owning a BMW. After all, they’re exclusive, expensive and offer impeccable execution. Bimmers still do.\n\nSo it’s no wonder why the new BMW 3 Series convertible worries me. This car is such a well-balanced machine, I fear people might start to think they look good in argyle again.\n\nFun to drive and great to pose in around town, this redesigned car has the potential to breathe new life into the dormant yuppie movement. Dust off those green pants and Izod shirts — the Ultimate Status Machine has returned with more sophistication and precision than ever before.\n\nAfter just a week of driving the new convertible, even I was ready to trade my cup of joe for a nonfat double latte mochaccino and move to Ann Arbor.\n\nIt’s that beautiful, inside and out.\n\nWith the top up, its long lines are never interrupted by a clumsy cloth roof. Take 22 seconds to let those three steel pieces automatically stack up in the trunk and you’ve got fresh yuppie porn ready for a (Condé Nast Traveler) centerfold.\n\nThe $56,000 crimson red 335i I test drove always collected looks from other drivers — no doubt wondering what kind of plastic surgeon I was or how much I made on Wall Street before the tech bubble burst.\n\nPowerful, functional art\n\nFrom the front, the new convertible is distinctive and easily recognizable as a BMW. Its strong lines are stretched horizontally, giving it broad shoulders and a firmly planted stance. The hood has almost a scalloped cut above the dual kidney-shaped grilles and wide headlights. Two creases cut down the hood, starting a V-shape carried through the vehicle’s front. That completes the car’s stern face, one just pretentious enough to look disapprovingly at passing cars.\n\nThe ridge that cuts from the top of the front wheel well all the way to the back of the car continues the BMW’s distinctive look. Even with the front tire pushed forward and the unnaturally long space between the rear tire and the coupe’s door, the convertible still maintains its good looks and proportions.\n\nAll of the edges are sharp and well defined, like a sculpture parked outside the Detroit Institute of Arts. It’s purposeful, powerful, functional art.\n\nTwin-turbo generates power\n\nBut don’t let the shiny metal and high-pitched engine tone fool you. This cabriolet has more German engineering than the Messerschmitt 262.\n\nThe 335i comes with a direct injection twin-turbo charged Inline-6. A scientifically wonderful power plant, generating 300-horsepower and 300-pound-feet of torque. It can haul from zero to 60 mph in 5.5 seconds. An electronically controlled regulator limits the vehicle’s top speed to 130 mph or 150 mph, the higher limit applying to sport package models. Due to the closing of the Lodge and my desire to keep my license, I never tested the top end performance.\n\nThe small twin turbos divide the work load to eliminate that pause in power commonly referred to as turbo lag. The cycle used to be: Stomp foot on accelerator; white knuckle the steering wheel; count to three and then feel your body slam back against the seat.\n\nBut BMW has connected each turbo to three cylinders. Smaller turbos work faster, and combined with a direct injection system that can burst three injections per combustion cycle into the engine, the 2007 turbo cycle now is: Press accelerator and whoooeeee!\n\nEven with the higher performance, the 335i can get 29 miles per gallon on the highway with a manual transmission, while still hitting 20 mpg in the city, according to EPA numbers. Those numbers are even more impressive when you look at the 328i’s less powerful Inline-6.\n\nLacking the turbo chargers and a direct injection system, the 328i’s 3-liter Inline-6 gets 30 mpg on the highway with a six-speed automatic transmission and 20 mpg in the city. Its power, however, is considerably less, hitting 230-horsepower and 230-pound-feet of torque.\n\nIf money is not an object — and for people throwing down more than 50 grand for a convertible, it probably isn’t — buy the 335i.\n\nBoth cars include an enhanced suspension system that lets them perform more like roadsters than four-passenger cars.\n\nMy 335i whipped around corners confidently and the optional 18-inch low profile tires stuck to the pavement like a rich man’s kid to an au pair.\n\nThe rack-and-pinion steering is very tight and returns to center quickly, whether zipping through traffic lights or taking an exit ramp at highway speeds. Push the car and you will appreciate how it can dart quickly from where you are to where you want to go.\n\nThe double pivot McPherson strut-type front suspension and five-link independent rear suspension give the BMW a firm but stable ride. On the highway, it’s honey smooth, and in the city, it feels gritty and firm but never uncomfortable.\n\nThe convertible weighs about 400 pounds more than its fixed roof counterpart but rides remarkably the same. Some of the additional weight comes from the steel added to strengthen the body. Because convertibles don’t have the structural support of a roof, they must find other ways to keep the body stable. My test vehicle never felt loose on rough roads and had little cowl shake, the movement the windshield makes when a car hits a bump.\n\nWell-appointed interior\n\nInside, the 335i is luxurious. The dash includes a long sweeping top that blocks most sun light to let you read the instruments and navigation screen with ease. The entire cabin is elegant and well appointed.\n\nThe seats, as part of the optional sports package, include adjusting bolsters that can hold the driver and passenger firmly in place through tight cornering. They can also push out far enough to accommodate larger passengers.\n\nThe backseats are a tight fit, despite BMW adding a few more inches. At 6 feet tall, I would not want to sit back there longer than a trip to the store (and the driver would need to push his seat all the way up). However, a few neat options include: a folding down backrest that allows you to load items into the back on a flat surface and a pass-through door that connects the backseat to the trunk.\n\nA few other interesting features include sun reflective leather seats. The color pigments in the leather reflect infrared radiation and effectively keep the surface temperatures down.\n\nThis amenity works well. Even on a sunny hot afternoon day with the top down, the seat never felt like it was about to melt my back or set fire to my thighs.\n\nAll of the luxury appointments, as well as a simplified iDrive, a dash-mounted control system that operates the vehicle’s navigation, telephone, stereo and climate functions through a single spinning knob, round out the BMW as the complete package.\n\nI’ve always liked the functionality of the iDrive despite claims that it was too complicated. The easiest way to understand the iDrive is to sit down, read through the owner’s manual, and play with it for a few minutes while parked. If you still can’t figure it out, realize the system isn’t dumb, you are.\n\nCombining performance, luxury and prestige has always been part of the BMW’s calling card. And this 3 Series convertible is the best one yet.\n\nWhile yuppies may have gone the way of Soccer Moms, NASCAR Dads and the AARP, the 3 Series convertible remains an image-enhancing symbol. Whether a modern day DINK, Baby Boomer or someone from a Generation to Be Named Later, the car is worth the price tag.\n\nScott Burgess is the auto critic for The Detroit News.

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in February 2007 about the 2007 BMW 328i. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what details are different this year, check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe critical acclaim the 3 Series has enjoyed year after year is all but unmatched. How does it continue to win over people who write about cars for a living? The formula is rather simple: It rewards the driver like few other non-exotic cars can, with its communicative steering, intuitive handling and a family of smooth inline-six-cylinder engines. In a market fraught with cars that offer little more than point-to-point transportation, the 3 Series’ driving qualities are hard to match. We just wish there were more room in the cabin to better enjoy those qualities.\n\nRefined Inline-Six Power\nThe rear-wheel-drive 328i is powered by a 3.0-liter inline-six that makes 230 horsepower at 6,500 rpm and 200 pounds-feet of torque at 2,750 rpm. While the engine doesn’t have the low-end thrust of the twin-turbo 335i and its unique 3.0-liter inline-six, it is smooth and flexible. The engine provides acceleration that should satisfy the majority of buyers; the run from zero to 60 mph comes in 6.3 seconds with the standard six-speed manual transmission, according to BMW. The 328i sedan gets an estimated 21/30 mpg (city/highway) with the automatic transmission and 20/29 mpg with the manual.\n\nThe manual transmission is a pleasure to shift, and the relatively light clutch pedal isn’t too taxing to operate when crawling through heavy urban traffic. Like BMW’s other manuals, the 328i’s shifter is a bit tall for my tastes, and its throws aren’t the shortest out there, but they’re precise and the shifter has a slick feel. Thanks to the car’s hill-holder feature, a manual transmission 3 Series is less prone to rolling backward when accelerating on an incline.\n\nIf you’re not into the shift-it-yourself thing, the optional six-speed automatic is rather refined. The transmission includes BMW’s Steptronic clutchless-manual mode that lets the driver control when gear changes occur, and also features a Sport mode. Sliding the gear selector into Sport brings a more aggressive shift program; upshifts happen later to allow the engine to rev higher, and the transmission downshifts earlier when decelerating to keep the engine revs up and provide engine braking. This second characteristic makes the car lurch slightly when coming to a stop, but this tendency isn’t present when the gear selector is left in Drive.\n\nVentilated all-disc brakes are standard. The driver is rewarded with natural and progressive effort each time the pedal is pressed, and the brake system features brake-fade compensation and brake-disc drying. Brake-fade compensation raises brake-line pressure when the brakes are hot, and thus less effective, so pedal response stays consistent. When raining, brake-disc drying keeps the discs clean by occasionally touching the brake pads to them.\n\nHype-Worthy Ride and Handling\nJust as BMW has found the sweet spot with its inline-six engines, so too has the automaker developed a suspension setup that’s one of the best at balancing ride quality with handling performance. The optional Sport Package’s firmly tuned sport suspension skews toward enthusiast buyers even more, but it’s still fairly compliant and doesn’t punish occupants.\n\nBody roll is kept in check and the car feels planted when cornering. The standard variable-assist power steering system has a weighty feel that’s well suited to the car’s sport-oriented mission, and the leather-wrapped steering wheel provides the driver with a constant stream of feedback as to what the tires are experiencing at the road. BMW’s variable-ratio Active Steering system is optional. Active Steering varies the degree to which the wheels turn based on changes in the position of the steering wheel at a given speed. The car turns harder at lower speeds than it does at higher ones, for example. Active Steering can also, when necessary, make steering adjustments independent of the driver to maintain car control.\n\nThe Downside: An Overly Cozy Cabin\nIf the 3 Series sedan and wagons have a significant downfall, it’s on the inside. The issue is not one of material quality or craftsmanship, which is mostly good, but of overall roominess. The larger Infiniti G35 sedan puts its extra overall length and height to good use by offering a cabin that doesn’t feel as tight as the 3 Series, whether in the front or rear seats. The G35’s trunk is also slightly bigger. BMW fans will argue that the 3 Series’ small size makes it the handling wonder that it is, but the larger G35 offers remarkably competitive performance in this regard.\n\nSimulated leather seats are standard and real leather is optional. Burl walnut, poplar and aluminum trim are available. My test 328i came with sport front seats as part of the optional Sport Package. The comfortable seats have firm backrest and seat cushions and include power-adjustable side bolsters and manual cushion-length adjustment (the latter will be appreciated by tall drivers). All oft-used controls, especially the manual transmission shifter, are well within reach of the driver.\n\nLike the front portion of the cabin, the rear half is short on room; the outer rear seats are tolerable for adults, but the backrest is rather upright. If it weren’t for the cutouts in the back of the front seats, my knees wouldn’t have been very happy. The lack of headroom and legroom in the center seat make this bench better suited for two. A split-folding backseat is optional.\n\nThe car’s dual-zone automatic air conditioning controls are straightforward, but the standard audio system’s buttons require a bit more scrutiny to learn. More troubling is the fact that the stereo’s LCD screen is nearly impossible to read when wearing polarized sunglasses.\n\nUnlike the larger 5 Series and 7 Series, which come standard with BMW’s iDrive control system, 3 Series buyers can choose not to opt for the controversial system. Included with BMW’s optional navigation system, iDrive controls air conditioning features, audio sources and vehicle settings in addition to navigation functions. Much of this is done via a console knob that’s used to navigate menus and select settings shown on the system’s 8.8-inch dash screen.\n\nSafety\nThe 3 Series received the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s highest rating — Good — in its frontal-offset and side-impact crash tests. Standard safety features include antilock brakes, side curtain airbags, side-impact airbags for the front seats and an electronic stability system. Rear parking sensors are optional.\n\n328i in the Market\nThe 3 Series’ dynamics still lead the way among sport sedans. The G35, however, has made inroads in the 3 Series’ market by offering a similar driving experience at a better value, with its powerful V-6 and longer list of standard features.\n\nSome buyers will simply prefer the 3 Series because it’s a BMW, but the fact that the automaker doesn’t own this category like it has in the past means more choices for consumers in search of an entertaining sedan, and we think that’s a good thing.\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "If you ever need proof that the automotive press is not exactly connected with most consumers, just ask one of us what vehicle we like.\n\nThis is what we’d say: A European diesel wagon with a manual transmission. It’s efficient, taut, fun and completely un-American.\n\nAmericans, at least the ones who buy cars, eschew wagons — even if the word sport is attached to it. They dislike diesels and shun manual transmissions.\n\nThe 2010 BMW 328i Sports Wagon is as close to that machine as we’ll see on American roads. My test vehicle opted for BMW’s stalwart 3-liter inline six that runs on gasoline and an automatic transmission that offered paddle shifters for a little sporty fun. But the xenophobe-buying American consumers won’t touch this vehicle; well, a couple will. That’s a mystery to many of the automotive press, including myself.\n\nThis is a great little car. It can haul. And by that, I mean it can carry lots of stuff in the back (there’s 58 cubic feet of space behind the second row, so you could stack up a foursome’s set of golf clubs and a cooler), as well as carry the foursome. It can also haul, and by that, I mean go fast.\n\nThe gutsy little magnesium and aluminum block six-cylinder engine creates 230 horsepower and 200 pound-feet of torque. Sure, lots of cars make more power, but those aren’t BMWs. And most certainly are missing that nearly perfectly balanced feel on the road. It weighs just 3,500 pounds and seems to glide along the road. This is in part due to the independent suspension that provides a firm ride, but not one that feels overly aggressive.\n\nWagon is sporty on the road\n\nMy test vehicle included the optional M sport package, which adds 17-inch performance tires, sport seats, aluminum pedals, a different steering wheel and some added aerodynamic features on the body. It’s tough to make a wagon look sporty, but BMW manages to do just that.\n\nMore importantly, it feels sporty on the road. The steering combines that great firm feel that makes you speed up in curves. The body remains extremely flat through turns and this wagon accelerates out so well.\n\nThe Steptronic automatic transmission also adds a nice racy dimension. Typically, I try out the manual override on an automatic transmission a couple of times during testing but then quickly forget about it. But on the BMW wagon, I found myself using it more and more, enjoying the car’s quick acceleration onto the highway and stretching the rpm on the engine to enjoy the full torque curve.\n\nThere’s also a practical side to this car that BMW usually lacks. The wagon, somehow, wipes away a lot of pretentiousness some European cars have, as if the owner knows some secret he refuses to share with his neighbors. No, a BMW doesn’t make you better, and tossing down $36,000 won’t win you any friends — if it does, are they a really a friend?\n\nBut this car just feels so comfortable. The racing seats hold you in place snuggly and there are a lots of luxury features that you’d expect. Dynamic Cruise control, auto dimming rearview mirror, rain sensing wipers, heated dual power exterior mirrors and heated windshield washer jets are all features designed for drivers.\n\nOther features, such as Bluetooth connectivity for hands-free phone operation, personal music player integration and a two-way power glass panoramic moonroof, add another layer of sophistication.\n\nInterior wraps you in luxury\n\nWhen you sit inside the BMW Sports Wagon you feel wrapped in a cocoon of leather and luxury. There’s a soft red tint to the lights at night and when you gun the accelerator, the car filters out all of the outside sounds except the engine.\n\nThe BMW wagon is the ultimate sleeper car for people who like to hide the fact that they love driving. It can help a friend move on the weekend, drop everyone off for school in the morning and still let mom or dad carve up a few mountain roads.\n\nMaybe that’s why the automotive press likes these kinds of cars so much. They are the practical racers we can get away with owning because no one is the wiser.\n\nThe BMW 3-Series Sports Wagon adds the cache of German engineering, ride and handling to boot.\n\nSo automotive journalists were half right — as it’s unlikely diesels will ever really take off in America and manual transmissions are likely to be only a generation away from disappearing all together on American highways.\n\nStill, it’s better to be half right, than half wrong. So I’ll take the wagon, and keep on driving.\n\nsburgess@detnews.com (313) 223-3217",

      "expert_review": "Rev. Frederick J. Eikerenkoetter, famously known as “Rev. Ike,” was anathema in our staunchly Roman Catholic New Orleans home.\n\nTo my parents, Daniel and Lillian Brown, he was a child of blasphemy, an enemy of all things good and true in the Catholic Church.\n\nNothing would peeve them more than to discover one of us Brown children secretly listening to a Rev. Ike broadcast on a transistor radio beneath our bed covers. In what appeared to be a swift, single motion, the covers would be yanked, the radio confiscated and turned off, and a slap administered to the buttocks.\n\n“You will not listen to that trash!” my Dad shouted.\n\nBut I listened anyway. How could I not? Rev. Ike, who died July 28 in Los Angeles, was a black man who preached the “gospel of success and prosperity” and bragged that he had so many cars, BMW and Rolls-Royce models among them, “my garage runneth over.”\n\nThe dude, God rest his soul, was totally cool to a car nut like me.\n\nI remembered Rev. Ike last week while tooling about in a platinum bronze metallic 2009 BMW 328i convertible.\n\nThe good reverend would’ve liked that one with its hard-top, one-touch, power retractable roof and an interior done in saddle-brown and black Dakota leather with burl walnut accents. The car had the right amount of show — good enough to attract attention and inspire emulation without igniting the destructive fires of jealously.\n\nHallelujah!\n\nIt mattered not to me that Rev. Ike was a despicable con artist, as my parents claimed, or a saint, as many of his followers believed. I always thought the man preached common sense — that there is, for example, a dramatic difference between showing up in Bethlehem on the back of a donkey or behind the wheel of a BMW, Cadillac or Rolls-Royce.\n\nRev. Ike said that arriving in something like a BMW would have made a better impression. And although I have no comparable experience with four-legged donkeys, I agree.\n\nConsider, for example, my test-driving experiences of past weeks. Preceding the BMW 328i convertible were a series of economy cars — Hyundai Elantra Touring, Toyota Yaris, Nissan Versa — all wonderfully noble in their frugality and humility, but not a single one of which inspired public notice or comment, good or bad.\n\nDriving those cars was the motorized equivalent of being a character in Ralph Ellison’s “Invisible Man.” People noticed you only if you got in their way. Those cars were very un-Ike-like.\n\nRev. Ike said preachers can’t preach unless they first get attention. In that regard, he was short on miracles but long on cars. Everybody looked whenever Rev. Ike rolled up in one of his fancy rides. A lot of those people stayed around to listen, too.\n\nLikewise was my experience in the BMW 328i convertible. When I told people I got good mileage in a Toyota Yaris, they all yawned. But when I told them I got 27 miles per gallon on the highway in the rear-wheel-drive, inline six-cylinder 230-horsepower 328i convertible, they applauded! And, lo! It mattered not that the thing required premium unleaded gasoline.\n\nInstead, numerous spectators marveled over the ballet-like performance of the 328i convertible’s automatically retractable hard top, urging me, “Do it again!” As Rev. Ike would say, they yearned for more “like manna from heaven.”\n\nI will miss Rev. Ike, as I miss my parents. Here’s hoping that he and they find a quiet place to sit and talk in the afterlife and that, maybe, my Dad will learn that Rev. Ike wasn’t such an awful influence on a boy who loved cars.",

      "expert_review": "With its exceptional acceleration, handling, braking, gas mileage and interior accommodations, the 2013 BMW 328i is the best luxury sport sedan you can buy. Period.\n\nWhen I evaluated the BMW 3 Series sedan after its 2012 redesign (see the review), I concluded that, for the first time, the 328i was all anybody needed, thanks to its new turbocharged four-cylinder engine. For 2013, what’s new is a more affordable 320i (reviewed separately), an M Sport trim level — and the results of our sport-sedan comparison test, in which the 328i took first place over five other sport sedans less than $46,000 (as equipped).\n\nThis review covers the 328i sedan, which was redesigned for 2012. The coupe, convertible and top-performing M3 versions remain unchanged, but the redesigned wagon hits dealerships this spring as a 2014.\n\nBalance Defined\nTake a look at any Cars.com review and you’ll notice we’re practical, never fixating exclusively on performance. The 328 would have never come out on top in our competition if it didn’t balance its excellent drivability with some mainstream benefits. One example: It had the best observed gas mileage at 28.1 mpg combined. That was 1.7 mpg better than the next-most-efficient Audi A4 2.0T Quattro and 7.7 mpg better than the worst, the Volvo S60 T5 AWD.\n\nThat’s pretty impressive, and only becomes more so when you know the 328i was also the quickest to 60 mph, making it in 6.6 seconds. (All our test cars had automatic transmissions and were clocked with two adults onboard.) It beat the next-best S60 by almost 0.2 second, and the worst, the Mercedes-Benz C250 Sport, by more than 1.6 seconds. The BMW proves that a trade-off between acceleration and mileage — exemplified in our test by the Volvo and Acura TL 3.7 — is no longer a valid excuse.\n\nThe notion of a turbocharged four-cylinder delivering the goods remains difficult to fathom, but direct injection gives the BMW’s 2.0-liter adequate torque at low rpm — long a failing of small engines, even turbocharged ones. There’s nothing wrong with the more powerful 335i, but outside of a racetrack the additional power doesn’t seem necessary. In previous generations, the six-cylinder 328 and 325 versions were too poky. Not anymore. (Any six-cylinder 2013 model 328 that appears in Cars.com’s specs represents the coupe or convertible.)\n\nThough the 328i sedan also comes with a satisfying six-speed manual transmission, we were impressed with our car’s 8-speed automatic. The extra gears allow the 328i to launch confidently off the line without sacrificing efficient cruising.\n\nSpecifications don’t always reflect real-world performance, but it’s likely the Cadillac ATS’ use of a six-speed automatic played a part in its less impressive results in our Sport Sedan Challenge, despite the car’s lower weight: The ATS went from zero to 60 mph in 8 seconds and achieved an observed mileage of 25.0 mpg combined.\n\nThe BMW 3 series sedan eight-speed delivered smooth, confident shifts and reasonably responsive kickdown. Eco Pro, Comfort and Sport modes vary the accelerator and power-steering responsiveness along with the transmission’s willingness to downshift and hold lower gears.\n\nThe abrupt engine stop/start feature I detailed in my 2012 review remains universally loathed and was habitually switched off by all judges in our Challenge.\n\nBraking\nThe 328i had the shortest braking distance in our test at 118.9 feet, 3.7 feet shorter than the next closest, the A4. But panic braking isn’t something you deal with on a regular basis (I hope!); all the cars stopped short enough to be reasonably safe. What also matters is how the brakes feel, and here again the 328i beat the others, with effortless stopping power, good pedal feel and linearity on both application and release.\n\nI was most pleased by the transmission’s transparency; in BMW’s larger cars, “EfficientDynamics” provisions include a Brake Energy Regeneration feature that causes the transmission to downshift awkwardly through the gears during routine braking, causing uneven braking response.\n\nRide & Handling\nOur test car was the new M Sport Line, which joins last year’s trim levels: base, regular Sport Line (no “M”), Luxury Line and Modern Line, which are treated as option packages when you order. The most expensive such package at $3,850, M Sport adds a sport suspension along with 18-inch wheels and summer tires; a more menacing front end and enhanced aerodynamics; different exterior and interior trim; and some “M” badging, which attempts to steal some cachet from true performers like the M3.\n\nWithout a doubt, the M Sport suspension sharpened the 328i’s reflexes without sacrificing ride quality too much. Though the ATS’ handling wowed us, the 328i was still the champ with precise steering, excellent front/rear balance and driftability that begged us to drive it hard. The BMW wasn’t unique in having rear-wheel drive; half of our Challenge contestants had it too, but it’s tough to beat rear-wheel drive when it’s well-executed. (As of 2013, the 3 Series sedan once again offers all-wheel drive as well, called xDrive.)\n\nThe only real complaint is how the BMW 3 Series has less overall “feel” than previous generations, but that’s not a new gripe, and the BMW 3 Series stood up well among its current competition.\n\nInterior\nAfter driving the BMW 3 Series 328i, our judges began to express a willingness to overlook other shortcomings. Truth be told, we didn’t find many. Though not as large as the Acura on the outside, it has good interior space, including serviceable front-seat legroom, above-average backseat legroom and the most front- and rear-seat headroom in our comparison test. The trunk was also the largest at 13 cubic feet.\n\nThe 3 Series sedan now has a standard 40/20/40-split folding backseat, making it one of the only cars in this class where it’s included at no charge — a change from the previous 328 generation. That’s right; even lower-priced luxury cars often give you the opportunity to pay for features that are standard from more modest brands. Another eye-opener for new shoppers is that most of these cars have imitation leather upholstery rather than the real thing in their base models (the A4 is an exception). For what it’s worth, the imitation stuff is often convincing and may age more gracefully. Leather comes in all the 328i’s Line packages, including our M Sport.\n\nThe interior quality was universally respected, if not always loved, and I think BMW does a good job offering different approaches in its various Lines. While the base model is austere, each of the others is classier and suits a particular taste, from classic — with wood trim — to contemporary or sporty with more metal and a cooler color palette.\n\nEven at our car’s $45,745 as-tested price (including the destination charge), it didn’t include a backup camera or navigation system; neither did three of the other five cars in our Challenge, though they’re optional on all of them. For all the grief BMW legitimately earned for its iDrive multifunction controller in its earlier years, it’s not so bad now, especially in our car’s simple, non-navigation version. We’re less impressed with turn-signal and gear-selector levers that spring back to center rather than stay in place. They’re awkward and sacrifice desirable tactile feedback while adding no apparent improvement.\n\nFeatures\nConspicuously absent from our 328i was Bluetooth streaming audio capability, which comes only with the navigation option. Standard equipment in the base model includes keyless access, auto-dimming rearview and heated side mirrors, HomeLink, rain-sensing windshield wipers, headlight washers, dual-zone automatic climate control, 17-inch alloy wheels, a 40/20/40-split folding backseat and a four-year, 50,000-mile free regular maintenance warranty — generous for this class.\n\nOptions include adaptive cruise control, in-vehicle assistance (similar to GM’s OnStar), adaptive headlights, parking assist, an adaptive suspension, a moonroof, shift paddles for the automatic transmission and active-safety features that are detailed in the next section.\n\nA BMW 328i sedan loaded with every possible extra-cost option, including all-wheel drive, comes to $57,370.\n\nSafety\nThe 2013 3 Series sedan was named a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, having scored Good in frontal, side, rear and roof-strength tests. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration rated the sedan and wagon with five out of five stars.\n\nStandard safety equipment includes frontal airbags, front knee airbags and side curtain airbags that protect front and rear occupants in side impacts. The front seats also have side-impact airbags and active head restraints. As is required of all 2012 and later models, the 3 Series includes antilock brakes and an electronic stability system with traction control.\n\nBlind spot detection, a backup camera, side/top-view cameras and proximity sensors come in an optional Driver Assistance Package. A lane departure warning system is also optional.\n\n328i in the Market\nPerhaps the most difficult thing for car reviewers to do is put themselves in the shoes of likely buyers — or who we suspect are likely buyers. There’s no doubt, people will pay extra for a luxury name. But what name will they pay for? And how much? Some of my colleagues suggested the 328i’s price is inflated because of its brand. I’m going to dissent.\n\nYes, our test car was one of the most expensive in the Challenge, even without navigation and some other features, but it was reasonably well-equipped and accommodating, and no other car made us as gleeful behind the wheel. That’s not worth paying for?\n\nIf any car in our test was guilty of a luxury markup, it was the Mercedes C250 — the car that came in last place due to many disappointments and omissions and that had an as-equipped cost of $42,355 — fourth highest in the Challenge. Few of its shortfalls were simply features that could have been added to bring the car to parity.\n\nMany believe the 3 Series outsells its competitors due to momentum, because BMW essentially created the luxury sport-sedan segment. That might be part of it, but I also believe average buyers, whether they realize it or not, respond to the feel of a well-engineered driving machine, to use BMW’s own term. Drivability matters, and the 3 Series delivers it — plus a lot more.\n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "As BMW runs a war path with new model introductions — two gigantic, turtle-shaped crossovers a year, at this pace — they haven’t forgotten where the profit margin lies. It’s in the little 3 Series.\n\nEven in the worst automotive sales climate in nearly two decades, more than 90,000 people in this country bought a 3 sedan, wagon, convertible, coupe or M last year. Young maverick-type men and attractive suburban women can’t, for the life of themselves, stay away from this car. It’s been like this for nearly two decades.\n\nSo BMW’s getting generous. Price a new 328i like ours on their website and you’ll see the “Value Package” pre-selected. It’s a no-charge combo of 17-inch alloys, leather and iPod integration. In other words, BMW looked dumb selling a luxury car with 16-inchers, fake leather, and a $400 USB cable when Audi, Acura and even Mercedes do more for less.\n\nBut those front seats, now standard with real cowhide instead of “leatherette,” have three clunky levers. They’re manual. They don’t have any map pockets behind them. There’s a phone button on the steering wheel (heated for $190) to talk handsfree via Bluetooth, but it doesn’t work, because this 3 doesn’t have the $750 “BMW Assist” option. A few hundred more and you’ll get — an alarm system.\n\nWhat we’ve got is a $42,000 car with a lot of kit missing. Sure, there are heated seats, a moonroof, and those beautiful “angel eye” rings around the halogen headlamps (xenon costs $900). But you’re left feeling BMW is still up to its old à la carte tricks. They take out everything you’d expect to find on a $42,000 car (like folding split rear seats) and know you’ll add it back at premium cost.\n\nNone of the mavericks seems to have cared. Sales are up 10 percent through July this year versus ’09. And I want one badly, too. Every other month, I’ll peek at used 328i coupes on the internet, poking through listings to find a loaded one with a 6-speed manual and 18-inch rims off the sport package. I don’t care if the 3 is the Civic of Wellesley. I can’t get over how good they look for around $20K. At that price, I could deal with manual seats.\n\nThe big selling point of the 3 Series, despite what the Audi A4, Acura TSX, Mercedes C-Class and Infiniti G have come close to matching, is the drive. The base 3.0-liter six feels more powerful than its 230 horsepower suggests, and much smoother and more melodious than most V-6s. Chalk it up to the low gearing of the 6-speed automatic, which is very responsive to throttle jabs and manual paddle shifts, yet can feather around in traffic without fuss.\n\nThere’s a lot of weight to the steering at city speeds — at first, that can feel burdensome — but the result is a steady stream of feedback from the road. The suspension strikes that magical balance between curve carving and comfort, and the brakes step in with a reassuring bite and pedal feel.\n\nI used to borrow my friend’s 2001 325i sedan to go on job interviews in and out of Boston, hoping the interviews would end quickly so I could go back and drive some more. His car is just as spartan inside as this 2011 (and amid the trend of button-crazy dashes and aggravating touch screens, this is a refreshing thing). But 10 model years of separation haven’t dimmed the 3’s personality: a no-nonsense driver’s machine that’s ready to hustle (with four people, in a pinch).\n\nIn M3 guise — tuned by BMW’s motorsports division — the 3 Series is ready to race. At $60,000, a lot of things come standard, namely power, buttons that say “power,” and power seats. Instead of the purring and humming from the 328i, the M3’s 4.0-liter V-8 sounds as if all eight pistons will burst through the engine block.\n\nNail the M3 in second gear on a highway onramp and you’ll be pressed hard into the pavement, wailing until the tachometer flashes red at 8,400 rpm. That most eyes can’t tell it apart from the regular car makes the 3 Series even more desirable. Is that just a pretty red convertible? Or does it carry many potential counts of reckless endangerment? There’s a 3 Series for that.\n\nGas mileage in the 328i didn’t improve much from the M3: 15 miles per gallon over 200 miles, mostly in the city. Blame it on our car’s xDrive all-wheel-drive system, which adds 221 pounds over the rear-wheel-drive car. It’s hard to find a rear-wheel-drive 3 Series in New England. Believe me, I’ve looked. I was skeptical if xDrive would numb the handling, making the turn-in less crisp than my friend’s 325i, but the rear-biased torque mitigated that. Even better, xDrive-equipped cars no longer look like they’re jacked up Subarus, as they used to a generation ago.\n\nIn a few years, this 328i will be a better value. It’s a fluid shape creased in all the right places, one that’s designed to age well. The doors, trunk, switchgear and interior materials will retain their solid, quality feel. Given the proper care, it should run as smooth and quick as ever.\n\nBut to buy this BMW brand new? I’ll check off the “Used Package.”",
