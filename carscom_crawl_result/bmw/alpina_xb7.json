      "expert_review": "Competes with: Mercedes-AMG GLS63, Mercedes-AMG G63, BMW X7 M50i\n\nLooks like: A really fast tiny house\n\nPowertrain: Twin-turbocharged 4.4-liter V-8 producing 612 horsepower and 590 pounds-feet of torque; eight-speed automatic transmission; standard all-wheel drive\n\nHits dealerships: Ordering opens in May; dealership arrival September\n\nBMW is adding another performance SUV to its lineup, but rather than give it the full M treatment like it did with the X3, X4 and X5, the X7 is instead handed off to Alpina, the BMW-affiliated tuning house and manufacturer. Thus, the XB7 is born.\n\nRelated: 2019 BMW X7 Review: Late to the Party, Bringing Caviar\n\nAlpina long has been associated with BMW, dating back to the 1960s, and modifies other vehicles in BMW’s lineup as well. Alpina is, in fact, so closely associated that its cars are marketed and sold by BMW in many global markets, with the Alpina B7 — a modified 7 Series — currently sold in the U.S. and the Alpina B6 previously sold here. Alpina vehicles are also covered by BMW’s warranty and maintenance programs.\n\nThe XB7 will join the B7 in BMW’s lineup as a large and luxurious vehicle with enough power to possibly rip a hole in the fabric of space and time, and like the B7 it will cost a pretty penny to wield that power: The XB7’s starting price is $142,295 (including $995 destination fee).\n\nExterior\n\nOn the outside, the XB7 gets the usual sort of accoutrements to let onlookers know this is a performance vehicle. That includes standard 21-inch wheels wrapped in performance rubber, with 23-inchers as optional equipment. The front bumper is covered in massive air intakes, and there’s “Alpina” lettering above the front splitter. The rear bumper showcases the XB7’s Alpina sport exhaust and has diffuser fins to improve aerodynamic performance.\n\nInterior\n\nDespite the performance of the XB7, Alpina doesn’t forget about luxury, with standard Merino leather upholstery covering BMW’s multicontour front seats with standard seat heating, a leather-wrapped instrument panel and an Alcantara simulate suede headliner. A three-panel panoramic sunroof is also standard, and BMW’s ambient Panorama Sky Lounge LED Roof is optional. Taking a page from BMW-owned Rolls-Royce, this can replicate a starlit night sky or display over 15,000 different patterns. Seating is for six or seven, with either a second-row bench seat or optional captain’s chairs.\n\nOther high-end touches inside include an Alpina sport steering wheel with Alpina’s signature blue and green stitching, BMW’s Crafted Clarity glass finishes and an Alpina-specific controller for the iDrive infotainment system, which has been further customized by Alpina and is displayed on a 12.3-inch screen. A second 12.3-inch digital display is used for the instrument panel.\n\nEngine and Transmission\n\nUnder the XB7’s giant hood is a twin-turbo 4.4-liter V-8 that pumps out 612 horsepower and 590 pounds-feet of torque. BMW claims that’s good enough to hustle the three-row SUV from 0-60 mph in 4.0 seconds, and with the standard 21-inch wheels and performance tires BMW says the XB7 can finish a quarter-mile in 12.6 seconds on its way to an electronically limited 180 mph top speed.\n\nAlpina cars also use their own ZF-developed transmissions, in this case an eight-speed automatic that was designed specifically to handle the massive amounts of twist produced by the V-8. Sport and Sport Plus drive modes optimize shift points for increased performance, while Comfort and Comfort Plus modes keep the revs lower for leisurely cruising.\n\nAn electronically controlled limited-slip differential helps get all that torque to the wheels with the most grip, and has been “specifically calibrated to suit the dynamic character of the BMW Alpina XB7 and it operates in conjunction with the other driving dynamic systems.”\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nOur Hands-on Experience With the 2019 BMW X7’s Hands-Free Driving Mode\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto: Where Are They Now?\n2019 BMW X7: 4 Things We Like, 3 We Don’t\nWhich Cars Have Self-Driving Features for 2020?\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2020 BMW X7?\nSafety\n\nAll-wheel drive is standard, and to help slow down the big SUV it’s been equipped with Brembo brakes — the front has four-piston calipers and 15.5-by-1.4-inch diameter discs, and the rear uses floating calipers and 15.7-by-1.1-inch discs.\n\nBMW’s Driving Assistant Professional Package is standard equipment, giving the XB7 standard forward collision detection with automatic emergency braking capable of detecting pedestrians and cyclists, as well as blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert, lane keep assist with side collision detection and adaptive cruise control with BMW’s Extended Traffic Jam Assistant.\n\nAlso standard is BMW’s Parking Assistant Professional Package, which is capable of detecting a suitable parallel parking space and parking automatically. A surround-view 3D camera and parking sensors assist drivers in manual parking situations.\n\nThe Alpina XB7 will be available for ordering this month with deliveries scheduled to begin in September.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 BMW X7?\n\nThe BMW X7 is a three-row SUV with seating for up to seven. Large and luxurious, the X7 has an impressive roster of standard comfort and technology features. The base xDrive40i is motivated by a 375-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six engine, while the M60i gets a twin-turbo 4.4-liter V-8 that churns out 523 hp. Each is paired to an eight-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive. For even more muscle, the specially trimmed Alpina XB7 features a 630-hp, twin-turbocharged 4.4-liter V-8. The X7’s competitors include the Mercedes-Benz GLS-Class, Land Rover Range Rover, Jeep Grand Wagoneer and Cadillac Escalade. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 BMW X7?\n\nThe X7 is unchanged for 2025 save for one update: The Driving Assistance Professional Package adds Active Lane Change with eye activation, in which the vehicle will suggest lane changes to the driver when operating in its hands-on semi-autonomous mode. All the driver has to do to initiate the lane change is look at the appropriate mirror; the car will then activate the turn signal and perform the lane change itself.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 BMW X7 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n12.3-inch digital instrument panel\n14.9-inch touchscreen\nNavigation\nWireless device charging\nAndroid Auto and Apple CarPlay\nHeated front seats and armrests\nPanoramic moonroof\nForward collision warning with city collision mitigation\nLane departure warning\nBlind spot warning\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nHarman Kardon surround-sound audio system\nM Sport exhaust\nLeather-wrapped dashboard\nHeated and cooled cupholders\nMassaging front seats\nSecond-row captain’s chairs\nHeated second-row seats\nHead-up display\n360-degree camera system\nShould I Buy the 2025 BMW X7?\n\nThe BMW X7 is the German luxury brand’s largest vehicle, though it doesn’t feel unwieldy when you want to have a little fun behind the wheel on a curvy road. Keep in mind, though, that some rivals deliver more third-row passenger space and a roomier cargo area. Still, the X7’s overall space is abundant by most standards, and its acceleration is sports-car-quick when equipped with one of the X7’s optional twin-turbo V-8 engines.",

      "expert_review": "Competes with: Audi Q7, Mercedes-Benz GLS-Class, Cadillac Escalade, Lincoln Navigator\n\nLooks like: The current X7 with refreshed front styling\n\nPowertrains: 375-horsepower, 3.0-liter twin-turbo inline-six (xDrive40i), 523-hp, 4.4-liter twin-turbo V-8 (M60i), 630-hp, 4.4-liter twin-turbo V-8 (Alpina XB7); eight-speed automatic transmission; all-wheel drive\n\nHits dealerships: Late 2022 (xDrive40i and M60i); early 2023 (Alpina XB7)\n\nBMW’s largest SUV, the X7, may have been late to the party, but it made up for its tardiness with a comfortable interior and capable engine options. For 2023, BMW has refreshed the X7 with updated styling, technology, driver-assist features and mild-hybrid powertrains. The base xDrive40i and higher-horsepower M60i variants will arrive later this year, followed by the performance-oriented Alpina XB7. Here are the changes coming to the opulent family hauler.\n\nRelated: 2019 BMW X7: Plenty to Like About the Three-Row Bimmer\n\nThe Exterior Gets Lit\n\nThe X7’s front end sees the biggest changes for 2023 with a new lighting design that splits the vehicle’s headlights and daytime running lights into two LED units. The slim daytime running lights that sit above the headlamps also serve as the vehicle’s signal indicators. The BMW kidney grille is tweaked with a new bicolor design that incorporates chrome elements; an illuminated version of the new grille will be available on the xDrive40i and standard on the M60i.\n\nThe X7’s rear styling was also attended to with new three-dimensional LED light strips that are slimmer, brighter and double as brake lights.\n\nAdditionally, a new paint color — Sparkling Copper Grey metallic — joins the roster of 14 exterior paint options, and larger 23-inch light-alloy wheels will be available as an alternative to the X7’s standard 21- or 22-inch wheels.\n\nUpdated M Sport Packages Arrive\n\nThe base X7 xDrive40i can masquerade as its higher-performance counterpart with a new M Sport Package. The package adds unique front and rear aprons and side skirts; gloss-black trim on the roof rails, window surrounds and door sills; and bicolor 21-inch wheels. Inside, the package adds illuminated door-sill plates with the M logo and an M-exclusive leather steering wheel, pedals and badging.\n\nAn M Sport Professional Package can be layered atop the xDrive40i M Sport or added to the M60i. For the base model, the package adds a matte-black surround for the kidney grille; tailpipe finishers in black chrome; M Sport brakes with black or blue brake calipers; an M Sport exhaust system; and the illuminated grille. The M60i gains the brake calipers and the darkened exterior trim.\n\nMore Creature Comforts, Sustainable Materials\n\nThe X7’s three rows can seat six or seven occupants with available captain’s chairs or a bench seat for the second row. BMW’s multi-contour heated seats now come standard on the base model; ventilated and massaging seats are optional.\n\nSustainability is a focus for the new X7 thanks to eco-conscious features like interior trim and floor mats made from recycled plastic and standard quilted-leatherette seats. Shoppers looking for a genuine leather interior will find standard Merino leather seats in the M60i; they are also available for the xDrive40i. A two-tone white and gray interior is added as a new option for 2023.\n\nImproved Powertrains Roll In\n2023 BMW X7 | Manufacturer image\n\nAccording to BMW, performance upgrades in the X7 come courtesy of its more efficient and capable powertrains. Like its predecessor, the 2023 X7 will come with a twin-turbo inline-six (xDrive40i) or twin-turbo V-8 (M60i, Alpina XB7). Each powertrain uses a new mild-hybrid system that includes an eight-speed automatic transmission with an integrated electric motor. BMW says the transmission enables faster gear changes for sportier dynamics and offers a sprint function that utilizes the paddle shifter to automatically shift into the lowest gear.\n\nAn integral active steering system now comes standard in the M60i and is available as part of the Dynamic Handling Package for the xDrive40i. According to the automaker, the system improves agility and handling when driving at moderate or high speeds and when changing lanes.\n\nxDrive40i\n\nThe base X7 is powered by a 3.0-liter twin-turbo inline-six that makes 375 hp and 383 pounds-feet of torque, which is an increase of 40 hp and 52 pounds-feet compared to the outgoing model. The engine is designed to reduce fuel consumption and improve efficiency; the current 2022 X7 xDrive40i gets an EPA-rated 21 combined mpg. The base X7 with the new engine gets a BMW-estimated 0-60 mph time of 5.6 seconds.\n\nM60i and Alpina XB7\n\nShoppers looking for more power in their family hauler will need to upgrade to the X7 M60i model. Under the hood is a 4.4-liter twin-turbo V-8 that makes 523 hp and 553 pounds-feet of torque (these specs are unchanged from the outgoing model, though BMW claims improved responsiveness). BMW estimates the V-8’s 0-60 mph time at 4.5 seconds. As with the xDrive40i’s inline-six engine, the V-8 has also been optimized for efficiency, but no mpg estimates have been provided.\n\nThe 4.4-liter V-8’s power is boosted for the X7’s performance model — the Alpina XB7. It makes 630 hp and 590 pounds-feet of torque, knocking the SUV’s estimated 0-60 time down to 4.0 seconds and enabling a top speed of 180 mph.\n\nBigger Tech, Smarter Safety\n2023 BMW X7 | Manufacturer image\n\nThe X7’s technology gets a new look and new features for 2023. A digital gauge cluster measuring 12.3-inches merges with the 14.9-inch center touchscreen as part of a single curved display; the new setup replaces the outgoing model’s two 12.3-inch screens. BMW has reduced the number of physical controls on the instrument panel, opting for digital controls for functions like climate control.\n\nAn updated center console houses a redesigned gear selector and the iDrive controller for BMW’s latest iDrive8 multimedia system. An enhanced Intelligent Personal Assistant offers additional voice control functionality, allowing the driver to adjust climate settings, control the panoramic moonroof or open windows.\n\nThe BMW Digital Key Plus is now offered across all models. The feature turns the driver’s iPhone into a car key and replaces the need for a physical key; it can be shared among five users. For families with young drivers, it can be set to limit top speed, power and radio volume.\n\nThe X7 packs many standard safety and driver-assist features, with several additions and enhancements for 2023. The current safety suite includes features like blind spot warning, forward automatic emergency braking with pedestrian and cyclist detection, lane departure warning, and front and rear parking sensors. A new exit warning system alerts occupants with visual and audible cues when a pedestrian or cyclist is approaching the side of the vehicle to prevent them from opening the vehicle doors and causing a collision.\n\nTo make parking with a trailer in tow less of a hassle, the Trailer Assistant feature allows the driver to use the iDrive controller to guide the vehicle while it automatically steers and backs up the trailer in a straight line. Another new feature is Maneuver Assistant, which takes GPS data and memorizes steering input from challenging tasks such as pulling into a tight driveway. When the same maneuver must be repeated in the future, the system will automatically control acceleration, brakes and steering to complete it.\n\nPricing and Release Date\n2023 BMW X7 | Manufacturer image\n\nThe 2023 BMW X7 xDrive40i will start at $78,845 (all prices include a $995 destination fee); that’s up $2,950 over the outgoing base model. The M60i’s starting price tag jumps to $104,095, which is a $3,300 bump over the outgoing 2022 M50i. Both models will arrive in the second half of 2022. Pricing for the X7 Alpina XB7 will be announced closer to its early 2023 on-sale date.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2019 BMW X7: Everything You Need to Know\nOur Hands-on Experience With the 2019 BMW X7’s Hands-Free Driving Mode\nWhat’s New With BMW for 2022?\n2019 BMW X7: 4 Things We Like, 3 We Don’t\nResearch the BMW X7\n\nRelated Video: \n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 BMW X7?\n\nThe BMW X7 is a three-row SUV with seating for up to seven. Large and luxurious, the X7 has an impressive roster of standard comfort and technology features. The base xDrive40i is motivated by a 375-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six engine, while the M60i gets a twin-turbo 4.4-liter V-8 that churns out 523 hp. Each is paired to an eight-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive. For even more muscle, the specially trimmed Alpina XB7 features a 631-hp twin-turbocharged 4.4-liter V-8. The X7’s competitors include the Mercedes-Benz GLS-Class, Land Rover Range Rover, Jeep Grand Wagoneer and Cadillac Escalade.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 BMW X7?\n\nThe X7 received a mid-cycle refresh only last year, so changes for 2024 are few. BMW’s Highway Assistant hands-free driver-assist system is available, as are crystal headlights with Swarovski-brand crystal elements. Upgrades to the available Parking Assistant Professional feature enable drivers to control parking maneuvers from outside the vehicle via a smartphone app.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 BMW X7 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n12.3-inch digital instrument panel\n14.9-inch touchscreen\nNavigation\nWireless device charging\nAndroid Auto and Apple CarPlay\nHeated front seats and armrests\nPanoramic moonroof\nForward collision warning with city collision mitigation\nLane departure warning\nBlind spot warning\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nHarman Kardon surround-sound audio system\nM Sport exhaust\nLeather-wrapped dashboard\nHeated and cooled cupholders\nMassaging front seats\nSecond-row captain’s chairs\nHeated second-row seats\nHead-up display\n360-degree camera system\nShould I Buy the 2024 BMW X7?\n\nThe BMW X7 is the German luxury brand’s largest vehicle, though it doesn’t feel unwieldy when you want to have a little fun behind the wheel on a curvy road. Keep in mind, though, that some rivals deliver more third-row passenger space and a roomier cargo area. Still, the X7’s overall space is abundant by most standards, and its acceleration is sports-car-quick when equipped with one of the optional twin-turbo V-8 engines.",
