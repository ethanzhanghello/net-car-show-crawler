      "expert_review": "Competes with: Mercedes-Benz CLS and AMG GT, Audi S7 and RS7, Porsche Panamera\n\nLooks like: An 8 Series coupe with less sensuality and more practicality\n\nDrivetrains: 335-horsepower, 3.0-liter turbocharged inline six-cylinder or 523-hp, twin-turbocharged 4.4-liter V-8; eight-speed automatic transmission; rear or all-wheel drive\n\nHits dealerships: September\n\nThe rollout of BMW’s new flagship 8 Series continues with the unveiling of the 2020 Gran Coupe, a four-door coupe-style sedan that will join the two-door coupe and convertible atop the lineup.\n\nRelated: BMW Blows Lid Off 8 Series Coupe With New Convertible\n\nThe fastback sedan will be offered in three versions: a rear-wheel-drive 840i, an all-wheel-drive 840i xDrive and the M850i xDrive performance version. It will be the biggest and heaviest 8 Series model at 9.0 inches longer, 1.2 inches wider and 2.2 inches taller than the two-door coupe on a wheelbase that is 7.9 inches longer.\n\nPricing starts at $85,895 for the 2020 840i Gran Coupe. The all-wheel-drive 840i xDrive Gran Coupe starts at $88,795, and the M850i xDrive Gran Coupe starts at $109,895. All prices include a $995 destination charge. These new variants will join the coupe and convertible at U.S. dealers in September.\n\nExterior\n\nThe sedan’s styling is new from the less steeply raked windshield and back, and a sleek fastback roofline blends a trunk lid with an upturned spoiler lip. But overall it gives up quite a bit of the sensuality exhibited by the two-door’s body shape and surfaces, trading the purity of the styling for the practicality of its larger size and four doors.\n\nLED headlights flank the large, one-piece kidney grille, and the aggressive bumper openings are functional. The heavily sculpted rear end features wide LED taillights.\n\nA panoramic glass moonroof stretches from the windshield to the back window, though the M850i will offer a lighter carbon fiber roof that also lowers the car’s center of gravity.\n\n2020 BMW 8 Series Gran Coupe | Manufacturer image\nInterior\n\nThe luxury cabin is familiar from the coupe model, just roomier, thanks to the added width and height. And the added wheelbase and length will make for more comfortable rear-seat accommodations than the tight coupe, as well as slightly more grand-touring-worthy trunk space measuring 15.5 cubic feet, not quite a foot more than the two-door. Rear headroom is up by 3.4 inches, legroom by 7.1 inches and shoulder room by 7.7 inches. The rear seat has a 40/20/40-split, folding back for more cargo room.\n\nFront sport seats, and Nappa leather dashboard and door trim, are standard. Vernasca leather seats are standard on the 840i trim levels, with Merino leather as an option (standard on the M850i). A fancier Merino leather interior is optional for all. And the Gran Coupe gets its own center console that extends to divide the rear seats but still allow for a center passenger when needed. Ambient lighting also is standard.\n\nThe dashboard features a 10.25-inch touchscreen and center controls along with a BMW iDrive knob-and-button multimedia controller. A navigation system is standard, along with a 12.3-inch configurable instrument display and a head-up display.\n\nUnder the Hood\n\nThe 840i models get the latest edition of BMW’s 3.0-liter inline six-cylinder putting out 335 horsepower and 368 pounds-feet of torque and are mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission with standard paddle shifters and launch control. BMW says the rear-wheel-drive 840i Gran Coupe can accelerate from zero-to-60 mph in 4.9 seconds and the all-wheel-drive 840i xDrive can get there in 4.6 seconds. Both are speed limited to 130 mph with all-season tires and 155 mph with performance tires.\n\nThe brute is the M850i xDrive Gran Coupe with a 523-hp, twin-turbocharged 4.4-liter V-8 putting out 553 pounds-feet of torque with an eight-speed automatic and all-wheel drive. BMW says the zero-to-60 mph time is 3.7 seconds, while top-speed limits are the same as the 840i. The V-8 includes a standard flap-controlled sport exhaust system keyed to the 8 Series’ mild-to-wild driving modes, with the exhaust note in the most-aggressive Sport Plus most likely to unsettle your neighbors.\n\nThe eight-speed transmission’s electronic control system is capable of using data from the navigation system to alter shifting characteristics to suit current driving conditions, including downshifting early when approaching intersections and minimizing unnecessary shifts between closely grouped corners. BMW also uses navigation data and sensors that read the movement of other vehicles to avoid unnecessary activation of the stop-start system. The torque-vectoring all-wheel-drive system is full time and rear biased. It has an electronic clutch that fully shifts torque between front and rear wheels. And adaptive shock absorbers are standard on all models. The 840i models get 18-inch wheels standard with larger sizes optional, while the 850i has standard 20-inch wheels.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nBMW Lineup Gets a New Top Coupe: the 2019 BMW 8 Series\nTo Say We Took a Quick Spin in the 2019 BMW M850i Is a Gross Understatement\nCheck M8: BMW Moves Pieces Into Place for High-Performance 8 Series\nBMW Looks (Way) Ahead to L.A. for 2 Series Gran Coupe Entrée\n2019 BMW X7: Plenty to Like About the Three-Row Bimmer\n2018 BMW M5 Review: Automatic for the People\nSafety\n\nA full range of safety and driver assistance technology is offered for the Gran Coupe. Standard on all versions is a front collision system with automatic braking.\n\nAn optional Driver Assistance Professional Package adds a blind spot and rear-cross-traffic alert, lane departure warning, lane-keeping steering assist, adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go, parking assistance and a 360-degree camera system. It also includes what BMW calls its Extended Traffic Jam Assistant that allows for semi-autonomous driving in congestion on limited-access highways at speeds below 40 mph.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 BMW 8 Series?\n\nThe BMW 8 Series is a large and imposing luxury car available in coupe, convertible and four-door Gran Coupe body styles. The 840i is powered by a 335-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder engine, while the M850i and the bonkers-fast (and expensive) M8 models get turbocharged 4.4-liter V-8s rated at 523 and 617 hp, respectively. The Alpina B8 Gran Coupe has a 612-hp, turbo 4.4-liter V-8. The 8 Series’ competitors include the Lexus LC 500, Mercedes-AMG SL-Class and Porsche Panamera. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 BMW 8 Series?\n\nFor 2024, the 8 Series adds standard wireless smartphone connectivity. \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 BMW 8 Series Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\nLeather upholstery\n12.3-inch digital instrument panel\n12.3-inch infotainment screen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto \nHarman Kardon surround-sound system\nSatellite radio\nForward collision warning\nCity collision mitigation\nLane departure warning\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nHands-free highway driving system\n360-degree camera system\nSuede headliner\nWireless device charging\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nFour-wheel steering\nShould I Buy the 2024 BMW 8 Series?\n\nThe BMW 8 Series lineup spoils you with choice, not to mention horsepower. Even the standard turbo six-cylinder delivers swift acceleration, though it’s hard to resist the urge to upgrade to one of the snarling twin-turbo V-8s. That said, no one is buying the coupe or convertible because of their roomy backseats and ample trunk volume; if those things are priorities, proceed directly to the Gran Coupe, which is far and away the best option in the lineup if you plan to routinely travel with more than one passenger — but like its two-door siblings, it focuses more on style than optimal backseat space. Regardless of body style, the 8 Series is big and imposing, and it can feel a little bulky due to its heavy curb weight and limited rear visibility — but all versions also make a big impression whenever you punch the gas pedal.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 BMW 8 Series?\n\nThe BMW 8 Series is a large and imposing luxury car available in coupe, convertible and four-door Gran Coupe body styles. The 840i is powered by a 335-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six engine, while the M850i and the bonkers-fast (and expensive) M8 models get turbocharged 4.4-liter V-8s rated at 523 hp and 617 hp, respectively. The Alpina B8 Gran Coupe has a 612-hp, turbo 4.4-liter V-8. The 8 Series’ competitors include the Lexus LC 500, Mercedes-AMG SL-Class and Porsche Panamera. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 BMW 8 Series?\n\nThe 8 Series lineup is unchanged for 2025. \n\nWhat Features in the 2025 BMW 8 Series Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\nLeather upholstery\n12.3-inch digital instrument panel\n12.3-inch infotainment screen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto \nHarman Kardon surround-sound system\nSatellite radio\nForward collision warning\nCity collision mitigation\nLane departure warning\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nHands-free highway driving system\n360-degree camera system\nSuede headliner\nWireless device charging\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nFour-wheel steering\nShould I Buy the 2025 BMW 8 Series?\n\nThe BMW 8 Series lineup spoils you with choice — not to mention horsepower. Even the standard turbo six-cylinder delivers swift acceleration, though it’s hard to resist the urge to upgrade to one of its snarling twin-turbo V-8s. That said, no one is buying the coupe or convertible because of their roomy backseats and ample trunk volume; if those things are priorities, proceed directly to the 8 Series Gran Coupe. Regardless of body style, the 8 Series is big and imposing, and it can feel a little bulky due to its heavy curb weight and limited rear visibility — but every version makes a big impression whenever you punch the gas pedal.",

      "expert_review": "BMW offers a small stable of Gran Coupe models that technically aren’t coupes at all. By definition, true coupes have only two doors, but BMW’s Gran Coupes are all sleekly styled four-doors with rakish, coupelike rooflines. The 8 Series Gran Coupe is the biggest and priciest example of the breed. It’s based on a stretched version of the 8 Series coupe and convertible’s platform, coming as the six-cylinder-powered 840i and in three V-8-powered models with escalating levels of power and performance: the M850i, Alpina B8 and M8.\n\nRelated: 2022 BMW i4 M50 Gran Coupe Review: Electric Rocket Ship\n\nThe 8 Series Gran Coupe debuted for the 2020 model year and gets a mild update for 2023 that includes freshened front-end styling, new paint colors and wheel designs, and a 12.3-inch infotainment display. There’s also a specially trimmed 8 X Jeff Koons M850i model — a collaboration with artist Jeff Koons — that wears an elaborate multicolor, comic-book-themed paint job and is limited to just 99 examples worldwide. It’s priced at a cool $350,995 (all prices include destination).\n\nMeanwhile, the 840i xDrive Gran Coupe that we tested had a starting price of $88,895. Its as-tested price was $99,745 thanks to a roster of optional equipment that included 20-inch M double-spoke wheels ($1,300) in place of the standard 19s, the Comfort Seating Package ($650; adds heated front and rear seats), white Merino leather upholstery ($2,000) and a dazzling — and very pricey — color-shift paint called Sepia Violet Metallic ($5,500).\n\nAt that $100,000 price point, the 840i Gran Coupe is an intriguing alternative to BMW’s redesigned-for-2023 740i large sedan and the flagship sedans of rival luxury brands, such as the Audi A8, Genesis G90 and Lexus LS. The Gran Coupe, however, has a different mission. It’s best to think of it as a grand touring coupe with the added convenience of four doors and a usable backseat rather than a stately, extra-spacious sedan.\n\nIn keeping with its low roofline, the Gran Coupe’s seating position is also low-slung. This means entry and exit is a drop-in/climb-out affair, and you’ll likely find that your eye is about level with the door handles of the SUVs around you on the road. The backseat can accommodate adult passengers — as long as they’re shorter than, say, 6 feet tall — but the rear center console limits capacity to two people and makes the rear legroom a tad more cramped. The trunk opening is on the stingy side and the load floor is rather high, but the space is usefully deep front to back, and the center of the rear seat flips down to create a decent-sized cargo pass-through.\n\nWhen I first got into our test vehicle, I was somewhat perplexed by the relative restraint of a six-cylinder engine in such a pricey machine. If you’re already spending almost six figures and opting for style over space, why not dial up the decadence and cough up another $15,000 or so for the M850i and its 523-horsepower, twin-turbo 4.4-liter V-8?\n\nBut that was before I drove the car. BMW’s turbo 3.0-liter inline-six has been around for a while, but it still punches above its weight and feels gutsier than its 335-hp rating would suggest. It pulls smoothly and strongly from most any rpm and sounds suitably exotic at the higher reaches of its rev range. This engine more than holds its own in the largest Gran Coupe offering, which weighs in at around 4,300 pounds in 840i xDrive form.\n\nI wasn’t the only Cars.com staffer who drove the 840i Gran Coupe, however. Here are a few more impressions:\n\nJoe Bruzek, Managing Editor\n\nThis particular 840i Gran Coupe was a fan favorite in my household. Both my kids (2 and 5 years old) loved the shimmering Sepia Violet Metallic paint that danced between purple, bronze and even green in varying light conditions. Should you spend $5,500 on a paint option because a 5-year-old likes it? I probably would; I was equally enthusiastic about the chameleon-like color on the low-slung, wide-stanced 840i Gran Coupe. My young kids’ car seats didn’t fit very well in the backseat, however, and they instantly coated the $2,000 white Merino leather interior in a light film of dirt and phlegm.\n\nI was more enthusiastic about driving the 840i Gran Coupe on an elusive date night. The 840i Gran Coupe is a luxury cruiser more at home driving through downtown Chicago’s Magnificent Mile, home to trendy restaurants and posh hotels, than it is pulling weekend soccer duty. And I found it to be a joy to drive, with confident moves despite its imposing dimensions and light steering feedback. Plus, it has a surprisingly comfortable ride even with its 20-inch wheels wrapped in summer tires.\n\nMore than just comfortable ride quality, driving and using the 840i Gran Coupe was a comforting experience. It drives without surprises or oddities thanks to its smooth turbocharged six-cylinder that delivers a harmonious soundtrack, and that engine works in perfect sync with the eight-speed automatic transmission. The 840i Gran Coupe also has normalized controls with an easy-to-use touchscreen, and it mostly does without a barrage of gadget and gizmo technology clamoring for your attention; the gesture control for audio system controls did prove intrusive for someone who talks with their hands because, in an animated conversation, it would change audio tracks or mute the volume.\n\nJennifer Geiger, News Editor\n\nWhile there are a few impressive things about the 840i (smooth and potent power, engaging handling, opulent cabin), I had trouble getting past some ergonomic and control issues. First, I struggled to find a seating position that balanced visibility and comfort. The sharply raked windshield cuts into forward visibility, and the tiny rear window, sloped rear roofline and thick rear roof pillars made it tough to get a clear view back. Also, the power button is in an ergonomically unfriendly position, hidden behind the steering wheel.\n\nThe multimedia interface also did not impress. It looks dated compared with what’s in the newer BMW iX and i4; those systems have slicker graphics and more straightforward menus.\n\nI had a few gesture control fails, as well; opening the center console box inadvertently changed the radio station a couple of times. On the flip side, the volume gesture was not sensitive enough, requiring multiple finger-circle attempts to engage. Due to this inaccuracy, the gesture feature feels more like a gimmick than something useful. It did provide a lot of laughs, however.\n\nIn back, the right kind of passenger will be very comfortable — the outboard seats are wide and supportive, and the vibe is very high-end thanks to supple leather and a fancy center console that extends from the front. The passengers need to be on the short side, too, because the sloping rear roofline eats into headroom and even makes the door-opening small. Kids, however, are not going to work back there; the white leather is a canvas for stains, and I struggled to install a forward-facing car seat and a booster because the fixed head restraints pushed the car seats way off of the seatback, which is a safety issue.\n\nPatrick Masterson, Chief Copy Editor\n\nThe best thing I can say about the 8 Series Gran Coupe is that it does exactly what it’s supposed to as a big, four-seat luxury grand tourer. It practically glides over highways and remains totally composed in corners. The eight-speed automatic transmission is pleasant, with shifts coming smoothly at both lower and higher speeds with little lag or hesitancy going up or down the gears. The steering wheel is nice and thick, too, ideal for gripping on longer drives. You’ll always feel comfortable, and the illuminated grille is a classy touch at night.\n\nThat’s both the blessing and the curse of the Gran Coupe, in fact. The flip side to such a settled driving experience is that you don’t feel connected to the road most of the time; steering inputs are received almost passively and offer little in the way of feedback for a driver hoping to get more out of the car. Similarly, the deep engine note is thoroughly dampened, and it’s difficult to get excited about a dull roar.\n\n2023 BMW 840i Gran Coupe | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nStrangely, my least favorite part might be the front seats: Try though I did to find a comfortable position, the seat cushion offered almost no support; were it not for the car’s insulated driving dynamics, I’d have felt like I was sitting on the chassis itself. I wasn’t alone; a front passenger complained about the same issue. That the rest of the Gran Coupe is so refined only served to put the front seats’ failings in starker relief.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2023 BMW 7 Series Adds Electric Model, Movie Theater Backseat\n2023 BMW 3 Series Freshens Up for July Launch\nRedesigned 2023 BMW M2: The Smallest M Scores Big HP Boost\n2023 BMW X1: BMW’s Littlest SUV Grows Up With New Tech, More Power\nShop for a New BMW 840i Gran Coupe\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
