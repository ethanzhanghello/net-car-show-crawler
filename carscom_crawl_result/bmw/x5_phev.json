      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 BMW X5?\n\nThe BMW X5 is a mid-size luxury SUV with seats for five people. The base engine is a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder that makes 375 horsepower and can be had with rear-wheel drive (sDrive40i) or all-wheel drive (xDrive40i). Other powertrains come solely with AWD, including the M60i’s 523-hp, twin-turbo 4.4-liter V-8 and the xDrive50e plug-in hybrid’s 483-hp setup that brings an EPA-estimated 40 miles of electric-only driving range. Sitting atop the lineup is the high-performance X5 M, which has 617 hp and track-tuned components. All X5s have an eight-speed automatic transmission. Competitors include the Audi Q7, Genesis GV80, Land Rover Range Rover Sport and Mercedes-Benz GLE.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 BMW X5?\n\nThe X5 undergoes an extensive refresh that includes updated exterior styling, hybridized powertrains, revised interiors, new tech features, and a couple of renamed and upgraded trims. The gasoline powertrains get a 48-volt mild-hybrid system, and output of the entry-level turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder engine has been bumped from 335 hp to 375. Despite a name change from M50i to M60i, the M60i’s twin-turbo 4.4-liter V-8 stands pat at 523 hp. The high-performance X5 M is now offered solely in top-line Competition form, powered by a 617-hp version of the twin-turbo V-8. The xDrive50e PHEV variant gets a 94-hp bump, to 483, and now provides 40 miles of estimated electric driving range versus 30 miles in the xDrive45e it replaces. Every X5 gets a freshened interior with BMW’s Curved Display, a 12.3-inch digital gauge panel paired with a 14.9-inch infotainment touchscreen, the latest version of BMW’s iDrive infotainment software and new ambient lighting features. The previously optional (and rather cramped) third-row seat has been discontinued, so all X5s now seat five people. \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 BMW X5 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n12.3-inch digital instrument panel\n14.9-inch multimedia screen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto \nFive USB ports\nNavigation\nPanoramic moonroof\n40/20/40-split, second-row seat\nForward collision warning\nBlind spot warning\nLane departure warning\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nRemote start\nHead-up display\n360-degree camera system\nBowers & Wilkins surround-sound stereo\nQuad-zone climate control\nInterior ambient lighting\nLow-speed hands-free driving system\nHeated steering wheel\nHeated front and second-row seats\nVentilated and massaging front seats\nShould I Buy the 2024 BMW X5?\n\nThe X5’s broad range of available powertrains makes it suitable for a variety of preferences and budgets. Regardless of the powertrain under its hood, the X5 boasts high-quality cabin materials, an excellent balance of ride quality and handling prowess, decent cargo volume and ample passenger space. However, we’ve also found some of the active driver aids to be overly sensitive and distracting.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 BMW X5?\n\nThe BMW X5 is a mid-size luxury SUV with five seats. The base engine is a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder that makes 375 horsepower and can be had with rear-wheel drive (sDrive40i) or all-wheel drive (xDrive40i). Other powertrains come solely with AWD, including the M60i’s 523-hp, twin-turbo 4.4-liter V-8 and the xDrive50e plug-in hybrid’s 483-hp setup, which delivers an EPA-estimated 40 miles of electric-only driving range. Sitting atop the lineup is a high-performance X5 M, which has 617 hp and track-tuned components. All X5s have an eight-speed automatic transmission. Competitors include the Audi Q7, Genesis GV80, Land Rover Range Rover Sport and Mercedes-Benz GLE.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 BMW X5?\n\nAfter undergoing an extensive refresh last year, the X5 is mostly unchanged for 2025. Among other minor alterations in standard and available equipment, the Driving Assistance Professional Package adds Active Lane Change with eye activation, in which the vehicle will suggest lane changes to the driver when operating in its hands-on semi-autonomous mode. All the driver has to do to initiate the lane change is look at the appropriate mirror; the car will then activate the turn signal and perform the lane change itself. A new, specially trimmed Silver Anniversary Edition commemorates 25 years of the X5. \n\nWhat Features in the 2025 BMW X5 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n12.3-inch digital instrument panel\n14.9-inch multimedia screen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto \nFive USB ports\nNavigation\nPanoramic moonroof\n40/20/40-split backseat\nForward collision warning\nBlind spot warning\nLane departure warning\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\n \n\nAvailable features include: \n\nRemote start\nHead-up display\n360-degree camera system\nBowers & Wilkins surround-sound stereo\nQuad-zone climate control\nInterior ambient lighting\nLow-speed hands-free driving system\nHeated steering wheel\nHeated front- and second-row seats\nVentilated and massaging front seats\nShould I Buy the 2025 BMW X5?\n\nThe X5’s broad range of available powertrains makes it suitable for a variety of preferences and budgets. Regardless of the powertrain under its hood, the X5 boasts high-quality cabin materials, an excellent balance of ride quality and handling prowess, decent cargo volume and ample passenger space. However, we’ve also found some of the active driver aids to be overly sensitive and distracting.",

      "expert_review": "Competes with: Gas-powered BMW X5, Mercedes-Benz GLE, Volvo XC60 and XC90 plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, Tesla Models Y and X\n\nLooks like: An X5 with an extra fuel door\n\nPowertrain: Turbocharged 3.0-liter six-cylinder engine paired with an electric motor and a 24-kilowatt-hour battery for a total system output of 389 horsepower and 443 pounds-feet of torque; eight-speed automatic transmission; all-wheel drive\n\nHits dealerships: July\n\nBMW actually first revealed the plug-in-hybrid version of its X5 SUV in September 2018, but said the U.S. version wouldn’t launch until 2020 as a 2021 model. Well, it’s 2020 and despite everything that’s happened between 2018 and now, the plug-in hybrid X5 is almost here. It boasts significant power increases over the previous X5 plug-in, more electric-only range and the latest in BMW’s safety and infotainment technology.\n\nRelated: How Do Car Seats Fit in a 2020 BMW X5?\n\nExterior\n\nThe X5 xDrive45e PHEV doesn’t look much different from its gas-only counterparts. It’s even available with the M Sport Package that offers unique 20- or 21-inch wheels, blacked-out exterior trim and an aerodynamics kit. The best ways to spot the PHEV version are to read the badging or spot the telltale charging-port door located on the driver-side front fender.\n\nInterior\n\nInside, there’s very little difference; the most significant change is the addition of buttons for Hybrid and Electric drive modes just left of the gear selector. Otherwise, the interior is standard modern BMW fare: a 12.3-inch digital instrument panel and 12.3-inch touchscreen multimedia system are standard, as are wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. SensaTec faux-leather upholstery is standard, and two grades of leather are optional. The addition of the battery pack does cut into cargo space slightly, however. According to BMW’s measurements, the PHEV version has 0.8 cubic feet less space with the backseat up, and 1.1 cubic feet less with the seats folded down.\n\nEngine and Transmission\n\nUnder the hood is where the most significant changes are, both from contemporary gas-only X5s and the previous-generation PHEV. The combined system output from the turbocharged 3.0-liter six-cylinder and electric motor with 24 kilowatt-hour battery pack is up 81 hp and 111 pounds-feet over the outgoing X5 PHEV. That generation used a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine paired with an electric motor and 12-kwh battery pack.\n\nThe result is a much quicker SUV that can go from 0-60 mph in 5.3 seconds, 1.2 seconds faster than its predecessor. It also results in increased electric-only range, now 30 miles instead of 14. Electric-only top speed also increases to 84 mph from the previous 75.\n\nSafety\n\nBMW’s Active Driving Assistant system is standard and includes forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking and pedestrian and cyclist detection, rear collision warning, blind spot warning, lane departure warning, rear cross-traffic alert and a display of the current speed limit.\n\nThe optional Driving Assistance Professional Package adds adaptive cruise control, lane departure prevention with side collision prevention and BMW’s semi-autonomous Extended Traffic Jam Assistant. It also adds front cross-traffic warning and BMW’s Evasion Assistant collision-avoidance feature.\n\nAdditionally, buyers can add the optional Parking Assistance Package, which provides self-parking capability and a drive recorder system that can be activated to record up to 40 seconds of video for later viewing and will automatically record and save 20 seconds of footage “around the moment of impact” if a crash occurs.\n\nThe 2021 BMW X5 xDrive45e is expected to arrive at dealerships in July with a starting price of $66,395 (including a $995 destination fee).\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2022 BMW X5?\n\nThe BMW X5 mid-size luxury SUV seats five or seven, depending on the seating configuration. It’s available with rear- or all-wheel drive and is powered by a standard 335-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six engine or a twin-turbo 4.4-liter V-8 that makes 523 hp in the M50i and 600 to 617 hp in the X5 M. A plug-in hybrid variant is also available. All versions have an eight-speed automatic transmission, and competitors include the Audi Q7, Mercedes-Benz GLE and Land Rover Range Rover Sport. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2022 BMW X5?\n\nThe limited-edition Black Vermilion variant of the xDrive40i model joins the lineup this year. It features 22-inch alloy wheels and is painted black with red-accented grille bars and brake calipers. The black-and-red color scheme carries over to the cabin, which is finished in black leather with red piping and accent stitching. Around 350 units are destined for the U.S. \n\nWhat Features in the 2022 BMW X5 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nDigital instrument panel\n12.3-inch multimedia screen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nNavigation\nPanoramic moonroof\n40/20/40-split second-row seat\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nBlind spot warning\nLane departure warning\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nRemote start\nHead-up display\n360-degree camera system\nLow-speed hands-free driving system\nHeated steering wheel\nHeated front and second-row seats\nVentilated and massaging front seats\nShould I Buy the 2022 BMW X5?\n\nThe X5 is a luxurious, comfortable and quick luxury SUV. However, some of its active-safety systems can be too sensitive, and the optional gesture-based control system is gimmicky. The third-row seat is handy, but bear in mind that the space is best left to kids.",
