Competitors include the Audi A5 and Mercedes-Benz C-Class.\n\nWith the same length, width, wheelbase and track as the two-door coupe, but a bit more headroom, the 4 Series Gran Coupe sports a sedan profile. Like the 4 Series coupe and convertible, it’s offered in four-cylinder 430i and six-cylinder 440i form. The high-performance M4 is available as a coupe or convertible and competes with the Cadillac ATS-V and Lexus RC F.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2019 BMW 4 Series?\n\nNavigation with real-time traffic information and a one-year trial of Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity is now standard. The M4 also adds standard parking sensors.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 BMW 4 Series Are Most Important?\n\nBMW’s rear-wheel-drive platform’s handling characteristics have been benchmarked by practically every automaker fielding a luxury sports sedan. Available active safety features include blind spot warning, adaptive cruise control and automatic emergency braking. Other available tech features include a head-up display, a digital instrument panel, wireless device charging and a Wi-Fi hot spot (data subscription required after initial trial).\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 BMW 4 Series?\n\nHandling and braking are 4 Series highlights. The Gran Coupe version offers extra cargo versatility without sacrificing style, while the retractable-hardtop convertible delivers year-round practicality. However, the automatic transmission’s responses during performance driving are lacking, and the car’s stability system is too conservative.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 BMW 4 Series?\n\nThe BMW 4 Series debuted for 2014 as a replacement for the previous-generation 3 Series coupe and convertible. Power comes from turbocharged four- or six-cylinder engines, and rear- and all-wheel-drive versions are available. Competitors include the Audi A5 and Mercedes-Benz C-Class.\n\nWith the same length, width, wheelbase and track as the two-door coupe, but a bit more headroom, the 4 Series Gran Coupe sports a sedan profile. Like the 4 Series coupe and convertible, it’s offered in four-cylinder 430i and six-cylinder 440i forms. The high-performance M4 is available as a coupe or convertible and competes with the Lexus RC F.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 BMW 4 Series?\n\nNew standard active safety features include forward collision warning with pedestrian detection, lane departure warning and city collision mitigation. Rain-sensing windshield wipers are also standard. Trim updates include darkened taillights, a gloss-black grille frame and a new diffuser.\n\nWhat Features in the 2020 BMW 4 Series Are Most Important?\n\nBMW’s rear-wheel-drive handling characteristics have been benchmarked by practically every automaker fielding a luxury sports car. Available active safety features include blind spot warning and adaptive cruise control. Other available tech features include a head-up display, a digital instrument panel, wireless device charging and a Wi-Fi hot spot (data subscription required after initial trial).\n\nShould I Buy the 2020 BMW 4 Series?\n\nHandling and braking are 4 Series highlights. The Gran Coupe version offers extra cargo versatility without sacrificing style, while the retractable-hardtop convertible delivers year-round practicality. However, the automatic transmission’s responses during performance driving are lacking, and the car’s stability system is too conservative.",
