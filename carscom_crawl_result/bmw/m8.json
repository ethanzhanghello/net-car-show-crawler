      "expert_review": "What Is the 2022 BMW 8 Series?\n\nThe BMW 8 Series is a high-end luxury car that’s offered in three body styles — coupe, convertible and four-door Gran Coupe — with seating for four or five, depending on the body style. The 840i is powered by a 335-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six engine, while the M850i and M8 Gran Coupe get turbocharged 4.4-liter V-8s rated at 523 and 617 hp, respectively. The new Alpina B8 Gran Coupe has a 612-hp, turbo 4.4-liter V-8.\n\nAn eight-speed automatic transmission is standard, and rear- and all-wheel-drive models are available. Competitors include the Jaguar F-Type, Lexus LC 500 and Porsche Panamera.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2022 BMW 8 Series?\n\nThe M Sport Package and extended leather upholstery are now standard. Coupe and convertible versions of the M8 return for 2022, and all M8s now come with the Competition Package.\n\nWhat Features in the 2022 BMW 8 Series Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nLeather upholstery\nDigital instrument panel\n10.25-inch multimedia screen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nHarman Kardon surround-sound system\nSatellite radio\nForward collision warning\nCity collision mitigation\nLane departure warning\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nHands-free low-speed highway driving system\n360-degree camera system\nBlind spot warning\nFour-wheel steering\nShould I Buy the 2022 BMW 8 Series?\n\nIf you’re in the market for a luxurious European sedan that’s a bit more stylish than a BMW 7 Series or Mercedes-Benz S-Class, the 8 Series Gran Coupe is worth a look.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 BMW 8 Series?\n\nThe BMW 8 Series is a large and imposing luxury car available in coupe, convertible and four-door Gran Coupe body styles. The 840i is powered by a 335-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder engine, while the M850i and the bonkers-fast (and expensive) M8 models get turbocharged 4.4-liter V-8s rated at 523 and 617 hp, respectively. The Alpina B8 Gran Coupe has a 612-hp, turbo 4.4-liter V-8. The 8 Series’ competitors include the Lexus LC 500, Mercedes-AMG SL-Class and Porsche Panamera. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 BMW 8 Series?\n\nFor 2024, the 8 Series adds standard wireless smartphone connectivity. \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 BMW 8 Series Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\nLeather upholstery\n12.3-inch digital instrument panel\n12.3-inch infotainment screen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto \nHarman Kardon surround-sound system\nSatellite radio\nForward collision warning\nCity collision mitigation\nLane departure warning\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nHands-free highway driving system\n360-degree camera system\nSuede headliner\nWireless device charging\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nFour-wheel steering\nShould I Buy the 2024 BMW 8 Series?\n\nThe BMW 8 Series lineup spoils you with choice, not to mention horsepower. Even the standard turbo six-cylinder delivers swift acceleration, though it’s hard to resist the urge to upgrade to one of the snarling twin-turbo V-8s. That said, no one is buying the coupe or convertible because of their roomy backseats and ample trunk volume; if those things are priorities, proceed directly to the Gran Coupe, which is far and away the best option in the lineup if you plan to routinely travel with more than one passenger — but like its two-door siblings, it focuses more on style than optimal backseat space. Regardless of body style, the 8 Series is big and imposing, and it can feel a little bulky due to its heavy curb weight and limited rear visibility — but all versions also make a big impression whenever you punch the gas pedal.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 BMW 8 Series?\n\nThe BMW 8 Series is a large and imposing luxury car available in coupe, convertible and four-door Gran Coupe body styles. The 840i is powered by a 335-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six engine, while the M850i and the bonkers-fast (and expensive) M8 models get turbocharged 4.4-liter V-8s rated at 523 hp and 617 hp, respectively. The Alpina B8 Gran Coupe has a 612-hp, turbo 4.4-liter V-8. The 8 Series’ competitors include the Lexus LC 500, Mercedes-AMG SL-Class and Porsche Panamera. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 BMW 8 Series?\n\nThe 8 Series lineup is unchanged for 2025. \n\nWhat Features in the 2025 BMW 8 Series Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\nLeather upholstery\n12.3-inch digital instrument panel\n12.3-inch infotainment screen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto \nHarman Kardon surround-sound system\nSatellite radio\nForward collision warning\nCity collision mitigation\nLane departure warning\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nHands-free highway driving system\n360-degree camera system\nSuede headliner\nWireless device charging\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nFour-wheel steering\nShould I Buy the 2025 BMW 8 Series?\n\nThe BMW 8 Series lineup spoils you with choice — not to mention horsepower. Even the standard turbo six-cylinder delivers swift acceleration, though it’s hard to resist the urge to upgrade to one of its snarling twin-turbo V-8s. That said, no one is buying the coupe or convertible because of their roomy backseats and ample trunk volume; if those things are priorities, proceed directly to the 8 Series Gran Coupe. Regardless of body style, the 8 Series is big and imposing, and it can feel a little bulky due to its heavy curb weight and limited rear visibility — but every version makes a big impression whenever you punch the gas pedal.",

      "expert_review": "What’s more outrageous than BMW’s new flagship coupe and convertible, the 8 Series? The much-awaited M version. When the 8 Series launched last year, it came in M850i trim — a “watered-down” version, if you will, of the full M8 (albeit still with a twin-turbo 4.4-liter V-8 making 523 horsepower and 553 pounds-feet of torque). Last night, BMW unveiled the real deal.\n\nRelated: 5 Things You Need to Know About the New 2019 BMW 8 Series\n\nThe 2020 M8 will come in coupe and convertible body styles as well as standard and Competition trims. In standard form, its twin-turbo 4.4-liter V-8 is good for 600 hp and 553 pounds-feet of torque; the Competition model boosts that to 617 hp (torque remains the same).\n\nBMW calls the engine its most powerful production engine ever, estimating the M8 Coupe’s zero-to-60-mph time at 3.1 seconds (3.0 seconds in Competition trim). For each variant, convertible editions are 0.1 second behind. Top speed, however, is electronically limited to 155 mph, or 189 mph with the optional M Driver’s Package. Those who opt for the latter also get access to M School driver training at one of BMW’s two U.S. Performance Center driving schools, either in Spartanburg, S.C., or Thermal, Calif.\n\nPower runs through an eight-speed automatic transmission to all four wheels via BMW’s xDrive all-wheel drive, which only sends torque to the M8’s front wheels when the rear wheels reach their traction limits.\n\nA host of exterior and interior upgrades set the M8 apart from lesser 8 Series models. Outside, coupes feature large openings in the front bumper and wear an M carbon-fiber roof. Competition grades have unique two-tone 20-inch wheels.\n\nInside, the models wear an M steering wheel with shift paddles and red M1 and M2 buttons, which can be programmed with various engine, suspension, steering and braking system modes. Other M exclusives include M Sport seats with illuminated M badging below the head restraints, extended Merino leather in either Silverstone or Black, and carbon-fiber cabin trim. The M8 Competition models add M seat belts with highlight stitching in BMW Motorsport colors.\n\nAll these extras won’t come cheap. The 2020 BMW M8 coupe starts at $133,995, up significantly from the M850i’s $112,895 price tag (all prices include destination). M8 convertibles tip the scales at $143,495, up from the regular convertible’s $122,395 price. Competition models add $13,000 to either car.\n\nProduction of the M8 begins in July.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
