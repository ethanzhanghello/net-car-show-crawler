      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 BMW 8 Series?\n\nThe BMW 8 Series is a large and imposing luxury car available in coupe, convertible and four-door Gran Coupe body styles. The 840i is powered by a 335-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six engine, while the M850i and the bonkers-fast (and expensive) M8 models get turbocharged 4.4-liter V-8s rated at 523 hp and 617 hp, respectively. The Alpina B8 Gran Coupe has a 612-hp, turbo 4.4-liter V-8. The 8 Series’ competitors include the Lexus LC 500, Mercedes-AMG SL-Class and Porsche Panamera. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 BMW 8 Series?\n\nThe 8 Series lineup is unchanged for 2025. \n\nWhat Features in the 2025 BMW 8 Series Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\nLeather upholstery\n12.3-inch digital instrument panel\n12.3-inch infotainment screen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto \nHarman Kardon surround-sound system\nSatellite radio\nForward collision warning\nCity collision mitigation\nLane departure warning\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nHands-free highway driving system\n360-degree camera system\nSuede headliner\nWireless device charging\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nFour-wheel steering\nShould I Buy the 2025 BMW 8 Series?\n\nThe BMW 8 Series lineup spoils you with choice — not to mention horsepower. Even the standard turbo six-cylinder delivers swift acceleration, though it’s hard to resist the urge to upgrade to one of its snarling twin-turbo V-8s. That said, no one is buying the coupe or convertible because of their roomy backseats and ample trunk volume; if those things are priorities, proceed directly to the 8 Series Gran Coupe. Regardless of body style, the 8 Series is big and imposing, and it can feel a little bulky due to its heavy curb weight and limited rear visibility — but every version makes a big impression whenever you punch the gas pedal.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 BMW 8 Series?\n\nThe BMW 8 Series is a high-end luxury car offered in three body styles — coupe, convertible and four-door Gran Coupe — with seating for four or five, depending on body style. The 840i is powered by a 335-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six engine, while the M850i and M8 variants get turbocharged 4.4-liter V-8s rated at 523 and 617 hp, respectively. The Alpina B8 Gran Coupe has a 612-hp, turbo 4.4-liter V-8.\n\nAn eight-speed automatic transmission is standard, and rear- and all-wheel-drive models are available. Competitors include the Jaguar F-Type, Lexus LC 500 and Porsche Panamera.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 BMW 8 Series?\n\nThe 8 Series line gets a subtle styling refresh that includes an illuminated grille and minor trim alterations. Inside, a 12.3-inch touchscreen replaces the previous 10.25-inch screen.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 BMW 8 Series Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nLeather upholstery\nDigital instrument panel\n3-inch multimedia screen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nHarman Kardon surround-sound system\nSatellite radio\nForward collision warning\nCity collision mitigation\nLane departure warning\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nHands-free low-speed highway driving system\n360-degree camera system\nBlind spot warning\nFour-wheel steering\nShould I Buy the 2023 BMW 8 Series?\n\nIf you’re in the market for a luxurious European sedan that’s a bit more stylish than a BMW 7 Series or Mercedes-Benz S-Class, the 8 Series Gran Coupe is worth a look. Coupe and convertible variants are sportier still, and that’s not counting the high-performance M8. Whichever model you choose, you’ll get a premium grand tourer that can be packed with technology.",
