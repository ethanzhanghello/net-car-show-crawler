      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in November 2012 about the 2013 BMW 650 Gran Coupe. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2014, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nWhat if you’re a top-of-the-line kind of person but don’t need a big backseat and don’t want a sporty two-door? The new 2013 BMW 6 Series Gran Coupe answers this question, but that’s about all it does. Comparable in style to “four-door coupes” like the Audi A7 and Mercedes Benz CLS-Class, the Gran Coupe is considerably more expensive. A Gran Coupe shopper would likely cross-shop Porsche’s similarly priced Panamera (see these models compared).\n\nEven with the power under the hood and a few surprisingly practical aspects, the 2013 BMW Gran Coupe is a concrete example of style over substance.\n\nFiguring This Thing Out\nNo matter what version you pick — the six-cylinder 640i or the V-8 650i — the Gran Coupe costs as much as a 7 Series sedan. So why would you choose it over a 7 that has more interior room?\n\nWell, do you have eyes? Yes, it’s good-looking. Stunning, in fact, when draped in the Frozen Brown Metallic matte paint of my test car. And the high-fashion interior is enough to satisfy a pro athlete or gossip magazine celeb. While the 7 Series looks like something your doctor might drive to the country club, the Gran Coupe looks like something your stockbroker drops at the valet of the hottest new restaurant in town.\n\nThere are some surprises under the skin, too. The Gran Coupe has similar passenger room up front and a significantly larger trunk — 16.2 cubic feet versus 14 cubic feet — than the standard 7 Series. BMW does make an extended-wheelbase 7 with even more rear legroom but no additional trunk space.\n\nThe bottom line is this: If you’re not ferrying rear passengers frequently, the Gran Coupe is a better option for its style, its performance and even its luggage space.\n\nThe 640i comes standard with a twin-turbocharged six-cylinder engine good for 315 horsepower, starting at $76,895 (all prices cited include destination charges).\n\nBut you probably want the top-of-the-line version, and that means opting for the 650i at $87,395 with a twin-turbo V-8 that puts out 445 hp.\n\nGetting one that’s equipped like my stunning test car will set you back roughly $120,000.\n\nThat sum might sound closer to exotic territory, along with the Bentley Continental Flying Spur or Aston Martin Rapide, but those cars actually hover around the $200,000 level. That means automakers like BMW have a lot of room to play with in terms of pricing.\n\nPerformance\nEven with the 445-hp twin-turbo V-8 under the hood, I found the Gran Coupe underwhelming to drive. It may be more agile than a 7 Series, but that’s not a difficult accomplishment. BMW’s 5 Series is a better-balanced car in terms of handling, braking and pure driving pleasure.\n\nThe Gran Coupe drives more like a yacht. It may have a lot of power, but it isn’t exactly fun to pilot. It’s hard to know where the front end actually ends, and I always felt like I was trying to dock it instead of park it.\n\nI had a similar reaction to the 6 Series two-door, upon which the Gran Coupe is based. Both are fine when punching hard to accelerate, but there was little sense of ferociousness in the driver’s seat, and the exhaust sounded muted for a car promising plenty of gusto. On even decently paved highways, the ride was somewhat rough — even with the chassis in Comfort mode — and the steering felt vague. That’s a rare attribute in a BMW.\n\nOur test car came standard with rear-wheel drive; all-wheel drive is optional, in the form of the 650i xDrive, but it isn’t offered on the 640i Gran Coupe.\n\nThe Gran Coupe features a start-stop function that cuts the engine when you come to a complete stop to save on fuel. For a big V-8, a few percentage points of better efficiency is important. But what it does to the driving experience is more significant. The 650i’s V-8 doesn’t exactly turn off with a sigh, and if you want to accelerate away from a stop briskly, it takes a second for the engine to come back to life before you can move.\n\nHow do you think that stutter looks to other drivers staring at your decked-out, six-figure car with big tailpipes?\n\nThe 650i with rear-wheel drive is EPA-rated at 17/25/19 mpg city/highway/combined, but I rarely saw my combined mileage top 15 mpg during my test. All-wheel drive takes an estimated 1 mpg away from both the city and highway ratings, yet somehow leaves the combined estimate at 19 mpg. The Gran Coupe 640i is considerably more efficient at 20/30/24 mpg.\n\nNext to Porsche’s Panamera, the Gran Coupe seems even more lethargic. They’re both heavy, four-door sport sedans, but the Porsche’s handling is a few steps above the BMW’s, and even its base V-6 offers a thrilling driving experience, let alone its array of V-8 engines.\n\nCompare the two here.\n\nWho Cares How it Drives?\nMy guess is Gran Coupe buyers simply won’t care that there are better performers out there, especially if they doll it up a little bit in the option department.\n\nThe wow factor of our test car’s looks, from the semigloss paint job to the interior, dazzled every editor who sat in it. The seats are comfortable (even in back), there’s a ton of tech and every surface felt darn good to the touch.\n\nThe big question is whether this car would wow anyone in its basic black configuration at its starting price. My guess is no.\n\nBut add white leather seats with brown stitching, a brown Alcantara headliner and white ash wood trim, and you have a car just this side of pro-athlete customizing. (Sort of like that, but tasteful.) The white ash wood trim — a gloss-white answer to the popular piano-black — was likely the tipping point for me in terms of making the interior truly unique versus the competition, especially because it covered the center console.\n\nMy test car was equipped with a $3,700 Bang & Olufsen sound system with a center dash-mounted speaker that raised up when the system was powered on. It’s similar to the Bang & Olufsen system in Audi’s A8 that has two tweeters raise up from the dash.\n\nThe systems offer similar sound quality, but BMW’s is a bargain compared with Audi’s, which costs $6,300.\n\nYou sit low in the Gran Coupe because it’s based on the 6 Series two-door coupe, not the 7 Series. The upgraded seats are comfortable on long rides. Otherwise, the dash and interior up front is similar to the rest of the 6 Series lineup.\n\nThe backseat is a different story.\n\nThere is a surprising amount of knee room with the driver’s seat adjusted for my 5-foot-10 frame, but anyone larger might impose upon the comfort of rear passengers. It’s similar to the space in the Mercedes CLS I tested last year, but, unlike that car, there’s an actual seat in the middle for a fifth passenger. Could any human actually sit there and stretch his or her legs over the large center floor hump in anything resembling comfort? Doubtful. So there’s no advantage in my mind versus the CLS’ setup.\n\nSafety\nThe BMW 6 Series Gran Coupe has not been crash-tested by either the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.\n\nThere are a number of standard safety features you can find here, as well as an optional Driver Assistance Package ($3,800) that includes lane departure warning and a blind spot warning system. That package also includes a head-up display, which BMW executes extremely well.\n\nBMW 6 Series Gran Coupe in the Market\nThere is essentially just one shopper for the Gran Coupe: The 7 Series owner who doesn’t need room in the backseat.\n\nPerformance fans have a better option in the Panamera, and if comfort is of importance, the Mercedes-Benz S-Class is an ideal pick.\n\nBMW’s hope is that its Gran Coupe can play in the middle of that spectrum by wowing consumers with its looks.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "What if you’re a top-of-the-line kind of person but don’t need a big backseat and don’t want a sporty two-door? The new 2013 BMW 6 Series Gran Coupe answers this question, but that’s about all it does. Comparable in style to “four-door coupes” like the Audi A7 and Mercedes Benz CLS-Class, the Gran Coupe is considerably more expensive. A Gran Coupe shopper would likely cross-shop Porsche’s similarly priced Panamera (see these models compared).\n\nEven with the power under the hood and a few surprisingly practical aspects, the 2013 BMW Gran Coupe is a concrete example of style over substance.\n\nFiguring This Thing Out\nNo matter what version you pick — the six-cylinder 640i or the 4.4-liter V-8 650i — the Gran Coupe costs as much as a 7 Series sedan. So why would you choose it over a 7 that has more interior room?\n\nWell, do you have eyes? Yes, it’s good-looking. Stunning, in fact, when draped in the Frozen Brown Metallic matte paint of my test car. And the high-fashion interior is enough to satisfy a pro athlete or gossip magazine celeb. While the 7 Series looks like something your doctor might drive to the country club, the Gran Coupe looks like something your stockbroker drops at the valet of the hottest new restaurant in town.\n\nThere are some surprises under the skin, too. The Gran Coupe has similar passenger room up front and a significantly larger trunk — 16.2 cubic feet versus 14 cubic feet — than the standard 7 Series. BMW does make an extended-wheelbase 7 with even more rear legroom but no additional trunk space.\n\nThe bottom line is this: If you’re not ferrying rear passengers frequently, the 650i Gran Coupe is a better option for its style, its performance and even its luggage space.\n\nThe 640i comes standard with a twin-turbocharged six-cylinder engine good for 315 horsepower, starting at $76,895 (all prices cited include destination charges).\n\nBut you probably want the top-of-the-line version, and that means opting for the 650i at $87,395 with a twin-turbo V-8 that puts out 445 hp and 480 pounds-feet of torque.\n\nGetting one that’s equipped like my stunning test car will set you back roughly $120,000.\n\nThat sum might sound closer to exotic territory, along with the Bentley Continental Flying Spur or Aston Martin Rapide, but those cars actually hover around the $200,000 level. That means automakers like BMW have a lot of room to play with in terms of pricing.\n\nPerformance\nEven with the 445-hp twin-turbo V-8 under the hood, I found the Gran Coupe underwhelming to drive. It may be more agile than a 7 Series, but that’s not a difficult accomplishment. BMW’s 5 Series is a better-balanced car in terms of handling, braking and pure driving pleasure.\n\nThe Gran Coupe drives more like a yacht. It may have a lot of power, but it isn’t exactly fun to pilot. It’s hard to know where the front end actually ends, and I always felt like I was trying to dock it instead of park it.\n\nI had a similar reaction to the 6 Series two-door, upon which the Gran Coupe is based. Both are fine when punching hard to accelerate, but there was little sense of ferociousness in the driver’s seat, and the exhaust sounded muted for a car promising plenty of gusto. On even decently paved highways, the ride was somewhat rough — even with the chassis in Comfort mode — and the steering felt vague. That’s a rare attribute in a BMW.\n\nOur test car came standard with rear-wheel drive; all-wheel drive xDrive is optional, in the form of the 650i xDrive, but it isn’t offered on the 640i Gran Coupe.\n\nThe Gran Coupe features a start-stop function that cuts the engine when you brake to a complete stop to save on fuel. For a big V-8 BMW, a few percentage points of better efficiency is important. But what it does to the driving experience is more significant. The 650i’s V-8 doesn’t exactly turn off with a sigh, and if you want to accelerate away from a stop briskly, it takes a second for the engine to come back to life before you can move.\n\nHow do you think that stutter looks to other drivers staring at your decked-out, six-figure car with big tailpipes?\n\nThe 650i Gran Coupe with rear-wheel drive is EPA-rated at 17/25/19 mpg city/highway/combined, but I rarely saw my combined mileage top 15 mpg during my test. All-wheel drive takes an estimated 1 mpg away from both the city and highway ratings, yet somehow leaves the combined estimate at 19 mpg. The Gran Coupe 640i is considerably more efficient at 20/30/24 mpg.\n\nNext to Porsche’s Panamera, the Gran Coupe seems even more lethargic. They’re both heavy, four-door sport sedans, but the Porsche’s handling is a few steps above the new BMW’s, and even its base V-6 offers a thrilling driving experience, let alone its array of V-8 engines.\n\nWho Cares How it Drives?\nMy guess is 6-Series Gran Coupe buyers simply won’t care that there are better performers out there, especially if they doll it up a little bit in the option department.\n\nThe wow factor of our test car’s looks, from the semigloss paint job to the interior, dazzled every editor who sat in it. The seats are comfortable (even in back), there’s a ton of tech and every surface felt darn good to the touch.\n\nThe big question is whether this car would wow anyone in its basic black configuration at its starting price. My guess is no.\n\nBut add white leather seats with brown stitching, a brown Alcantara headliner and white ash wood trim, and you have a car just this side of pro-athlete customizing. (Sort of like that, but tasteful.) The white ash wood trim — a gloss-white answer to the popular piano-black — was likely the tipping point for me in terms of making the interior truly unique versus the competition, especially because it covered the center console.\n\nMy test car was equipped with a $3,700 Bang & Olufsen sound system with a center dash-mounted speaker that raised up when the system was powered on. It’s similar to the Bang & Olufsen system in Audi’s A8 that has two tweeters raise up from the dash.\n\nThe systems offer similar sound quality, but BMW’s is a bargain compared with Audi’s, which costs $6,300.\n\nYou sit low in the Gran Coupe because it’s based on the 6 Series two-door coupe, not the 7 Series. The upgraded seats are comfortable on long rides. Otherwise, the dash and interior up front is similar to the rest of the 6 Series lineup.\n\nThe backseat is a different story.\n\nThere is a surprising amount of knee room with the driver’s seat adjusted for my 5-foot-10 frame, but anyone larger might impose upon the comfort of rear passengers. It’s similar to the space in the Mercedes CLS I tested last year, but, unlike that car, there’s an actual seat in the middle for a fifth passenger. Could any human actually sit there and stretch his or her legs over the large center floor hump in anything resembling comfort? Doubtful. So there’s no advantage in my mind versus the CLS’ setup.\n\nSafety\nThe BMW 6 Series Gran Coupe has not been crash-tested by either the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.\n\nThere are a number of standard safety features you can find here, as well as an optional Driver Assistance Package ($3,800) that includes lane departure warning and a blind spot warning system. That package also includes a head-up display, which BMW executes extremely well.\n\nBMW 6 Series Gran Coupe in the Market\nThere is essentially just one shopper for the Gran Coupe: The 7 Series owner who doesn’t need room in the backseat.\n\nPerformance and driver-focused vehicle fans have a better option in the Panamera, and if comfort is of importance, the Mercedes-Benz S-Class is an ideal pick.\n\nBMW’s hope is that its Gran Coupe can play in the middle of that spectrum by wowing consumers with its looks.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nSubtle updates grace the 2016 BMW 6 Series, which, typical of BMW, still comes in all manner of styles. You can get a 6 Series coupe, convertible or four-door Gran Coupe. Three engines pair with rear- or all-wheel drive and two automatic transmissions. Top among them is the high- performance M6 model, which can still come with a manual transmission to please the sports-car traditionalists.\n\nExteriorBMW’s twin-kidney grilles have nine bars apiece on the 640i and 650i, down from the current 10, while the M6 gets its own twin grilles with six pairs of bars apiece. All cars have new scalloped cutouts on the headlights’ inboard sides; adaptive LED lights are standard. The largest visual change comes in the lower bumper, where the opening now expands at its outer edges like on the 4 Series. LED fog lights cap the flared edges, with unique surrounding trim on the 6 Series convertible versus the coupe and Gran Coupe.\n\nAn M Sport Edition returns with 20-inch alloy wheels and some exterior modifications. The M6 has more aggressive bumpers with three separate openings. It’s similar to the 2012-2015 M6, which makes the 2016 M6 harder to tell apart. A carbon-fiber roof comes on the M6 coupe and Gran Coupe.\n\nIn back, six-cylinder models also have larger tailpipe openings. The Gran Coupe returns with four doors and a coupe-like profile. All models have reshaped side mirrors, which BMW says are more aerodynamic.\n\nInteriorAs before, the 6 Series’ interior features a sweeping dashboard contour that stretches from the passenger side down to the center console; the entire dash can come wrapped in leather, with an open-pore finish if specified. A semi-floating screen perches above the center air vents. Both the coupe and convertible seat four occupants; the Gran Coupe seats five.\n\nA navigation system and heated front seats with power adjusters and memory settings are standard across all 6 Series models. The leather upholstery in the convertible has a reflective treatment that reduces the heat given off during sunny days. The Gran Coupe’s backseat has optional seat heaters and side-window sunshades.\n\nBMW’s familiar iDrive system carries a touchpad atop the knob controller. Premium audio options include Harman Kardon or Bang & Olufsen stereos.\n\nUnder the HoodEngines carry over with a 315-horsepower, turbocharged six-cylinder engine in the 640i and a 445 -hp, turbo V-8 in the 650i. Both engines drive the rear wheels through an eight-speed automatic transmission. BMW says its optional xDrive all-wheel-drive system improves acceleration, with the 650i xDrive coupe and Gran Coupe hitting 60 mph in 4.3 seconds. A new exhaust on the 640i, meanwhile, makes for a more aggressive sound. Drivers can adjust it through BMW’s Driving Experience Control system, which changes the exhaust note among other systems to various comfort-, efficiency- or sport-oriented settings.\n\nOptional suspension setups include adaptive shock absorbers, as well as an active suspension that counters body roll in real time. Other systems include rear-wheel steering, which BMW says aids steering response and reduces the turning circle.\n\nThe M6 employs a turbocharged V-8 that’s good for 560 hp. It drives the rear wheels through a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission or a six-speed manual. The M6 model is available in all three body styles. A standard active rear differential routes power proactively between the rear wheels. High-performance carbon-ceramic brakes are optional.\n\nSafetyA night-vision camera system is available; so is lane-departure warning and adaptive cruise control with full-stop capabilities, pedestrian warning capabilities and auto-braking forward collision warning.",
