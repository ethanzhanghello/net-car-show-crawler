      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nBMW’s compact 3 Series is the luxury automaker’s bread-and-butter model. It’s available as a sedan, hatchback (Gran Turismo) or wagon, and numerous drivetrains are offered including hybrid and diesel versions. The five-seat 3 Series comes with rear- or all-wheel drive and competes with the Audi A4, Cadillac ATS and Mercedes-Benz C-Class.\n\n(Skip to details on the: 3 Series Gran Turismo, ActiveHybrid 3)\n\nNew for 2014\nThe 3 Series Sport Wagon rejoins the lineup after skipping a model year, and a new Gran Turismo version that combines coupe and hatchback styling is also new. A new turbocharged four-cylinder diesel engine makes its debut in the 328d and gets an EPA-estimated 32/45 mpg city/highway with rear-wheel drive. The new 4 Series coupe has replaced the 3 Series coupe in BMW’s lineup. \n\nNew standard features include a leather-wrapped sport steering wheel, dark burl walnut wood trim and a 10-year subscription to BMW’s emergency communication system that includes automatic collision notification. Models with the available navigation system get a new iDrive controller with a text-input touchpad.\n\nExterior Highlights\n\n\nDifferent grille, side mirror and tailpipe treatments distinguish among the Sport, Luxury and M Sport “lines”\n17-inch alloy wheels; available 18- or 19-inch wheels\nRain-sensing windshield wipers\nAvailable Active Steering system with speed-sensitive assist\nAvailable adaptive xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights\nAvailable automatic high-beam headlights\nAvailable power moonroof\n\nInterior Highlights\n\n\nSeats five\nManually adjustable front seats; power front seats available\nAvailable leather upholstery\nAvailable heated front and rear seats, heated steering wheel\nAvailable split-folding backseat\nPush-button start\nDual-zone automatic climate control\nTilt/telescoping steering wheel\nCD stereo with HD Radio and USB port\nBluetooth connectivity\nIDrive controller and 6.5-inch screen\nAvailable navigation system\nAvailable Harman Kardon surround-sound stereo\nAvailable sunshades for the rear windows\n\nUnder the Hood\n\n\n180-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (320i)\n180-hp, turbo-diesel 2.0-liter four-cylinder (328d)\n240-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder (328i)\n300-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder (335i)\nEight-speed automatic transmission\nSix-speed manual available\nFuel-saving stop-start technology\n\nSafety Features\n\nAntilock brakes\nElectronic stability system\nSide-impact airbags for the front seats\nSide curtain airbags\nFront knee airbags\nAvailable front and rear parking sensors\nAvailable backup camera\nAvailable lane departure warning\nAvailable blind spot warning system\nAvailable active cruise control with Stop & Go technology\n\n\n3 Series Gran Turismo\nThe 3 Series Gran Turismo is a new four-door coupe like hatchback version of BMW’s compact luxury car. Though styling cues are shared with the 3 Series Sport Wagon, the 3 Series Gran Turismo is a larger car overall, measuring nearly 8 inches longer and more than 3 inches taller. The result is a roomier cabin, especially for backseat passengers who enjoy 2.8 inches of extra legroom, and the front and rear seats are positioned higher for easier entry and exit.\n\n240-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (328i)\n300-hp, turbo 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder (335i)\nEight-speed automatic transmission\nAll-wheel drive\nSplit-folding rear seat\nCargo area has tie-down points, hooks and underfloor storage\n\nBack to top\nActiveHybrid 3\nIntroduced last year, the ActiveHybrid 3 is a 3 Series sedan with a gas/electric hybrid drivetrain. Subtle styling cues differentiate the ActiveHybrid 3 from the regular 3 Series. There are logos on the rear roof pillars, adaptive xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights, galvanized slats in the twin-kidney grille and matte chrome tailpipes.\n\n\nNewly standard leather-wrapped sport steering wheel\n18-inch alloy wheels\nTurbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder engine, electric motor and a lithium-ion battery pack\nTotal system output is 335 hp\nElectric motor can provide a power boost when accelerating\nCan be driven up to 2.5 miles at speeds up to 47 mph on electric power alone if conditions allow\nZero to 60 mph in 5.2 seconds, according to BMW\nEight-speed automatic transmission\nFuel-saving stop-start technology\nGas engine can shut down to save fuel when coasting at speeds up to 100 mph\n\nBack to top",

      "expert_review": "BMW has joined the club.\n\nIn simpler times BMW would have rolled out a convertible with a soft top just like it has since 1987. But now, keeping up with the Benzes or even the Pontiacs demands a retractable hardtop. So for the 2007 model year BMW added one, its first ever, in its 3-Series.\n\nWith a retractable hardtop the car becomes a year-round traveler ready for rain, sleet, snow and construction zones.\n\nAnd BMW’s move is certain to force Cadillac to offer a retractable hardtop in its CTS, just like Cadillac is expected to eventually add a wagon. But we digress.\n\nGone are the typical soft top shortcomings — wear and tear and stains ono the fabric, noise from the top flapping in the wind up or down, and most important, having only a thin sheet of canvas between your melon and whatever you hit in an impact.\n\nJust push the console button and the metal top hides in the trunk in 22 seconds. Push the button again, and it motors back up in 23 seconds. Ample time to open or close at a stop sign, not enough at some lights.\n\nThough it is air tight and doesn’t whistle or flap, a retractable hardtop does have its drawbacks, the primary one that it’s easier to find a needle in a haystack than to find luggage room in a trunk with the top there.\n\nWith the top down you can slip a coat, sweater, maybe a pair of running shoes in the trunk. With the top up you can carry a small overnighter providing the case and contents bend or fold. To hold a couple suitcases, the rear seat back folds flat.\n\nThe rear wall also conceals a bag that slips out and into the back seat to hold a pair of skis. Actually lots can be held in the back seat except people.\n\nNo room for feet, much less legs. There are a pair of fold-out cupholders and an ashtray in back, just no room for anyone old enough to use them.\n\nConvertibles are parade cars, but the huge headrests over the back seats rob the rear ledge of room to seat queen and her court. Headrests are made to rise and serve as roll bars in a rollover. Queens can always hop in a Mustang convertible instead.\n\nBMW offers redesigned 3-Series convertibles, the 325i with a normally aspirated 3-liter 230-horsepower 6-cylinder and the 335i with a 3-liter 6 that develops 300 h.p. Thank the twin turbos, which lack the typical lag. Hit the pedal and the car takes off. No waiting for the turbo to take a deep breath. And though that’s 75 h.p. more than from the 3 liter in the previous convertible, BMW is quick to point out that the mileage rating remains the same at 19 m.p.g. city/28 m.p.g. highway.\n\nStability control with traction control keeps the radials within the appropriate lane markers. It takes only light pressure on the brakes to stop the mass; four-wheel anti-lock brakes are standard.\n\nThe test car came with 6-speed manual. A 6-speed automatic is optional at $1,275. The manual is smooth and helps deliver an energetic jolt as you move up in each gear. However, manual and convertible don’t match as well as automatic and convertible. The 3-liter is a powerhouse, but a convertible typically is a sit-back–and-cruise machine. No need to rush the experience.\n\nAs with all BMWs, the 335i is designed for optimum performance. That means a stiff suspension to move from point A to B nimbly. But while agile, the car isn’t necessarily comfortable. When driven at length a backache and/or leg cramps await from stiff ride, stiff suspension and stiff seats.\n\nThe car came with run-flat radial tires and a sports suspension that prevents lean in corners — at the cost of a very stiff ride.\n\nYet BMW took pains to ease one pain associated with a convertible. Hop back into the car after the leather has baked a few hours and chances are you’ll toast a thigh or burn a bun. So BMW has gone with Dakota leather treated to reflect heat that can hit 140 degrees. Dakota reduces the temperature by 30 to 40 degrees so the seat will be about the same temperature as the body.\n\nNoteworthy features include a cell-phone holder in the center console, cell-phone/iPod holders plus iPod jack and power plug under the center armrest, cupholders that slip out of the dash and a cupholder under the armrest with an air duct to heat or cool beverages as warranted.

      "expert_review": "Convertible is a Fun Family Car\n\nOverview\n\nA BMW convertible is always fun, but did you know that the 2008 BMW 335i convertible is also a wonderful PMS buster? As the 335i rolled into my driveway, I was already suffering from the dreaded PMS headache and stomachache, but driving it proved to be a PMS-lifting experience.\n\nIt provided the comfort I needed (awesome lumbar support and heated seats) as well as the sassy style that was so befitting of my personality at the time. If I felt a little punchy, the car said, “Girl, I can relate. Beat this guy when the light turns green. I won’t let you down.” Backed by 300 ponies and a zippy six-speed manual transmission, the 335i put a smile back on my face.\n\nWhen I needed a little “me” time, the 335i quieted the kiddies with the awesomeness of its convertible top. They also had their own heat and air conditioning controls in the back, plus a few added compartments that kept them busy, but no door handles or window openers, so I could be virtually worry-free. I didn’t once have to say, “Don’t touch that. Stop. Seriously, I asked you not to touch the windows. Stop kicking the door handle. What if it opens and you fall right out?” Plus, the backseat provided plenty of room so I never had to experience their hyper legs kicking the back of my seat. What PMS? I think I might even put on my skinny jeans when I get home. Yeah!\n\nInterior\n\nFor the most part, the interior is just lovely. There was plenty of eye candy, between the leather, metallic and sparkly-swirly gray plastic trims. I was thrilled that I could comfortably step into the backseat area to help buckle my kids into their booster seats. By moving the front seats up and pushing the seatbacks forward, I had ample room to move around and never once bumped my head or experienced an awkward entrance or exit. This ease of use made me happy even in my hormonal frenzy – finally a backseat that’s easy to maneuver. The 335i that I test-drove had an added center console for the backseat. It provided many fun cubbies for my kids to store their juice-box straw wrappers in, but it eliminated the third rear seat. Fortunately for us, we never use that space anyway.\n\nIn my PMS-y state with a sore back and legs, I was elated to find that the driver and passenger seats were about as flexible as a contortionist – twisting, raising and inflating this way and that to pleasantly support any size and shape. As an added bonus, these supportive seats were well-heated. Picture yourself on your worst PMS day lounging in a recliner, clutching your most prized possession – your heating pad. The 335i offers this level of comfort for your aching mommy-bones. Ahhhh, I have to admit there were times that I sat in my driveway contemplating whether I wanted to get out of the car or not.\n\nBut you know as well as I do that nothing is perfect. This car does have some faults, including the seat belt buckles in the backseat. My kids normally buckle themselves in, but not in this ride, which is what led to me dancing around the backseat in the first place. You really have to mess with the seat belt buckles: They evade you at every push and resist clicking in until you’re about ready to go to your happy place. This is enough to annoy any person, let alone one with surging estrogen … or progesterone … or whatever the heck it is that surges.\n\nAlso, the plastic portions of the interior, including the seatbacks, scuff really easily. After one ride, my little ones managed to make a lot of scuff marks in the car. You can clean them up easily, but do you really want to be doing that every day?\n\nAnother thing that really got my goat (yep, I just said that) was that I couldn’t see the top of the speedometer when I had the steering wheel in a position I was comfortable with – 40 through 120 mph on the speedometer completely disappeared. “I’m sorry officer; I simply can’t see my speedometer. I couldn’t have been going that fast.” To avoid this conversation, I drove with the steering wheel higher than I would’ve liked.\n\nI also found the rear window to be far too small, which made it difficult to see much with my rearview mirror. I’ll admit this is an unrealistic complaint; this is a sports car, after all, and small rear windows come with the territory.\n\nExterior\n\nSuh-weeeet! This car is smooth lines and sassiness on the outside, and it’ll definitely turn heads – especially when the top’s down. I don’t know about you, but when I’m a moody mess I like the idea that people are checking me out. I realize they’re really looking at the car, but let’s not deflate my dreams, OK?\n\nThe dual exhaust, low-profile tires and BMW’s signature sneering headlights added to the 335i’s cool factor. I thought the doors were extremely long and heavy, which did cause some whining, but if you reduced the door size then you’d have to revert to a four-door sedan, and that’s not nearly as much fun.\n\nI really have no issues with the exterior. The hardtop has a seamless appearance and operates beautifully. My two boys loved the process of raising and lowering the top – it was like a little party in the Beemer every time. The car is so handsome it literally begs to be driven. It even offers bribes like comfy seats and sympathetic style. It’s a true gem.\n\nSafety\n\nThis is where the convertible enters into the family-car realm. BMW doesn’t miss a beat with safety features. Dynamic Stability Control with Brake Fade Compensation can be switched to Dynamic Traction Control for maneuvering through ice and snow. There are many airbags, including front and side-impact ones, plus driver- and passenger-side airbag head extensions and knee airbags. But there’s still more safety features, including four-wheel antilock brakes, rain-sensing windshield wipers, automatic headlights and Integrated Roll-Over protection. I’m starting to think one could write a novel on this topic alone.\n\nWhat was really interesting was feeling some of these systems kick in. I was driving on the highway at 70 mph as I turned into a curve that had some of Michigan’s notorious potholes. I was driving fast, but I could feel something kicking in that slowed me down ever so slightly. This kind of intervention would take some getting used to, because it does feel like you’re not in complete control of the car for a moment. But, hey, if the car wants to drive for me, more power to it. This might save the world from some PMS-induced road rage. No, I don’t mean just from me; I’m referring to the world’s population of women as a whole.\n\n*For more information on the 2008 BMW 335i and its safety features, visit Cars.com.

      "expert_review": "The 3 Series sedans, coupes and wagons are excellent performers, which is why I’ve always liked them. It’s also the main reason the 3 Series has owned the compact luxury-car market for as long as there’s been one. What’s changed, though, is that competitors have adopted the BMW formula in the past decade and are coming up strong. They’re a speck in the 3 Series’ rearview mirror in terms of sales, but in performance, they’re nipping at its heels, providing many alternatives for shoppers who aren’t swayed by the BMW brand.\n\nMost of the attention this year has gone toward the 3 Series’ new clean-diesel model, the 335d. No matter how successful it becomes, its U.S. sales will be dwarfed by its gas-powered siblings, so I got caught up with a coupe version of the 335i, powered by a twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter burning good old gasoline and driving all four wheels through BMW’s xDrive all-wheel drive. Click to compare different versions of the coupe and sedan.\n\nPower to Lead\nEngine power is an area where BMW let its guard down for a few years, allowing newcomers like the Infiniti G35 to pour on the horsepower — for less money. Then came the 300-horsepower turbo 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder that powers the current 335i, which makes it hard to care about any other engine. If you look at the horsepower specs alone, it appears that it’s happened again in 2009 because Infiniti now has 330 hp in its G37 coupe and sedan. Get behind the wheel, though, and you’ll find it hard to contest the BMW engine’s superior, visceral low-rev torque, responsiveness and smoothness. It feels good, it sounds good and … it takes a good chunk out of your bank account. Compared to the 328i, you get what you pay for, but it’s hard to make the same argument about the G37, whose 330 hp comes standard for $6,300 less than the 335i — and even $600 less than the 328i, despite the latter’s 100 hp deficit (all prices are for coupe versions). Again, it’s not just about the numbers. Torque freaks might find the 335i irresistible.\n\nFor all-wheel-drive models, BMW cites zero-to-60 mph times of 5.3 seconds for the manual coupe and 5.5 seconds for the automatic. The 328 model’s 230-hp normally aspirated 3.0-liter is good for 6.8 and 7.0 seconds, manual and automatic.\n\nThe manual transmission is not quite as impressive as the engines. Specifically, the six-speed shifter isn’t worthy of the car or the BMW brand. It feels rubbery as it slips into each gear — a complaint we’ve both heard and expressed for years now — but this stick feels disconnected from the works.\n\nStick-shift aficionados are a small but vocal bunch and represented disproportionately among automotive journalists and BMW owners. The appeal of driving a manual is one of those things that’s hard for nonbelievers to accept — kind of like British comedy, the Three Stooges and Dane Cook (only two of those are worthy of debate). A large component of it is the feeling of engagement in the driving process — not just because you’re doing much more than you would with an automatic, but because you are, in effect, part of the machine. The experience includes feeling the resistance of the clutch through the pedal when it engages, upshifting based only on the engine’s sound and, yes, feeling a physical connection to the drivetrain. Each of these attributes, when lacking, brings the transmission another step closer to being an automatic.\n\nIn the 335i, operating the shifter is about as involving as throwing a switch. I prefer the G37’s six-speed stick, which feels like a mechanical connection and tends to rock a little more as the engine loads and unloads the transmission. The 335i’s gear ratios are right and the clutch is satisfying, if a bit light. You want to work the shifter frequently, but it doesn’t add to the experience when you do.\n\nIn a Word: Handling\nIf you had to sum a brand’s identity in one word, BMW’s would be “handling.” Whether you opt for a tiny two-seater or a big SUV, a stronger or weaker engine, a manual or automatic, there’s one constant among BMW’s models: rear-wheel drive with excellent front/rear weight distribution, and the balance and roadholding that come with it. (BMW’s all-wheel-drive models are based on rear-drive platforms, which also deliver on the promise.) Owners might not know why they enjoy driving their 3 Series, but they do. I believe the model’s long-standing success comes in large part from its driving experience.\n\nWould-be competitors didn’t get it for a long time, trying instead to compete on price and levels of luxury with front-wheel drive and other impairments. It wasn’t until companies like Cadillac and Infiniti went to rear-wheel drive and put some engineering resources behind their cars’ dynamics that BMW finally had some competition. Audi has held some performance cred with its Quattro all-wheel drive, and now that the company has modified Quattro to bias torque to the rear wheels, its 3 Series challenger, the A5, has a feel sport enthusiasts can embrace. (Then there’s Mercedes-Benz, which historically has exhibited uninspired handling in spite of its use of rear-wheel drive, and whose C-Class is only marginally improved.)\n\nThe 3 Series has lost none of its famed handling prowess, though our 335i felt a bit heavy, and its steering didn’t have the feedback of the G37 coupe’s in our back-to-back driving test. However, unlike our 335i, the G we drove had rear- rather than all-wheel drive; the extra hardware up front can sap some of the road feel out of any steering system. Still, if memory serves, I prefer the G’s steering over the 3 Series’, regardless of driveline. For perspective, we’re talking top-tier stuff here, where the differences are minor. The A5’s steering — vague and lifeless, even for an Audi — wasn’t in the ballpark. It was at home, on the couch, wolfing Cheez Doodles.\n\nOn the other hand, the A5 offers an adaptive suspension option that the 3 Series lacks. The 335i’s ride quality was more than livable with its optional 18-inch wheels and summer performance tires, but it does have the expected taut, sporty feel. The ability to select the ride’s softness is becoming widespread and is typically appreciated by our drivers and passengers.\n\nInterior\nThe 3 Series’ interior is a mix of good and bad. The design is decent, but the materials are low-value — unless you opt for the added cost of optional upgrades. Having been criticized for interiors deemed too Spartan, which is a nice way of saying bland and unadorned, BMW has livened things up a bit in the past few years. The layout remains simple, in a good way. The positives in our coupe included the belt-feeder, a motorized arm that grabs the shoulder belt from the B-pillar and moves it within reach after you get in and close the door. (In a two-door, the shoulder belt either blocks passage to the backseat or slides far enough back that it’s hard to reach — a task that gets more onerous as we age. The belt-feeder seems a nice feature to grow old with.)\n\nLess impressive engineering includes the preposterous retracting cupholders — both on the passenger side. Flimsy doesn’t quite describe these paragons of flimse. Then there’s the stereo display, whose characters disappear completely if you wear polarized sunglasses.\n\nWhere the 3 Series doesn’t live up to most competitors is in its standard equipment, from the materials to the features. Most notable is its use of leatherette — which is a nice way of saying vinyl — as standard upholstery in all trim levels, including top ones like our 335i with xDrive. Mercedes pulls the same scam, but Audi, Cadillac, Infiniti and other compact luxury cars start with leather. Our car did have the upgrades as part of the $2,650 Premium Package option, which also added auto-dimming mirrors, lumbar adjustment for the front seats, HomeLink and BMW Assist (similar to GM’s OnStar) with Bluetooth connectivity.\n\nThe Coral Red color shown in the photos isn’t the only choice of leather, but I thought it worked well; bold colors either do or they don’t, and BMW’s pretty good at making them work. Our car also had Gray Poplar wood trim, which in my opinion is superior to brown wood in many interior color schemes. Overall, the upgraded interior was very nice. Even though the standard-issue materials are lower in monetary value, they’re of good and consistent quality in the 3 Series. The Audi and Infiniti models mentioned are hit-and-miss.\n\nExterior Styling\nMy opinion of design is of no greater value than anyone’s, but over time I’ve come to recognize when a model has broad appeal. The 3 Series obviously has that, but what some people might call classic, I’m starting to see as outdated. BMW got burned by straying too far from convention in some other models (though the burn didn’t seem to hurt their sales too badly), so they’ve been pretty conservative when redesigning this bread-and-butter model. Understandable, but it’s time for a change. I think making a statement is part of luxury-car appeal, and if your new BMW is easily confused with a previous generation, you aren’t achieving that goal.\n\nOf the A5, G37 and 335i coupes we lined up, we found the BMW to have the least appealing silhouette. Arguably, the best-case scenario is for a sedan model to look like a well-adapted coupe. In profile the 3 Series coupe looks like a poorly adapted sedan.\n\nSafety\nWith Good scores in frontal-offset, side-impact and rear crash tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the 3 Series is a Top Safety Pick, along with the Mercedes-Benz C-Class and Acura TSX. The Infiniti G37 and Lexus IS score Good in the front and side tests but fall short of the Top Safety Pick designation because their rear scores are Marginal and Acceptable, respectively.\n\nLike most luxury entries, the 3 Series has six airbags and an electronic stability system as standard equipment. See the full list of safety features here.\n\n3 Series in the Market\nThe 3 Series story is one we’ve seen dozens of times about products, services and people: The leader is unmatched but faces challengers who gain ground over time. If the leader is to hold its position, it has to evolve. It seems unlikely that the 3 Series will ever dominate the class as it once did, but it has maintained a healthy lead. In the first half of 2009, BMW sold almost 43,000 units. In second place was the Mercedes C-Class at less than 26,000. Audi, Cadillac and Infiniti hovered around 20,000.\n\nIf it were all about price and performance, the G37 would overtake the 3 Series in a year’s time. Clearly there’s something else that inures BMW buyers to high prices and comparatively stingy standard-equipment lists. It must be about the brand. Brand equity is a critical aspect among luxury cars, which are purchased to make a statement as much as anything else. Why a brand appeals to one person more than another is anyone’s guess, and it’s just as important as price, performance and quality. That being said, BMW will have to stay on top of things and keep the other aspects evolving. Inertia and brand strength will only go so far, especially if the competition keeps growing and improving.\n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "At first glance, I was the most impractical choice for test driving the 2010 BMW 335i coupe. The four-seater is sporty, small and only has two doors with a small backseat. I’m slow and large (I’m nine months pregnant as I write this) with two small children in large convertible child-safety seats. But having me test drive this car was a genius move on the MotherProof.com’s Chief Mama Kristin Varela’s part. I got to have one last sports-car “hurrah” before my third child comes and I can no longer fit my family into a car this small, and if I can make this car work for me, you know it would be a dream for someone without all of my accoutrements.\n\nAs it turns out, I did make this car work for the week I drove it, but I wouldn’t say this is a family car. This is the car you want in addition to your SUV or minivan. This car reminds you that driving is a sport that’s meant to be a thrill. When you make your millions, pick up one of these as your accessory car and enjoy yourself. If, however, you’re like me and in the family way, you can make this car work, but it’s a bit of a struggle at times.\n\nThe 335i’s twin-turbo inline-six-cylinder engine produces 300 horsepower that packs a punch, especially on this little vehicle. I found myself doing 100 mph without even noticing; even my husband questioned my sensibility, noting that I’m nine months pregnant, but I couldn’t help myself. A standard six-speed manual transmission only added to the driving fun in this rear-wheel-drive car. A six-speed automatic transmission is optional.\n\nAt the end of the week I was sad to let the four-seater go, especially after I got back into my family-mobile. Driving my minivan again practically reduced me to tears.\n\nExterior\n\nOoh, she’s a pretty car. My husband crooned, my mother-in-law fell in love with it at first sight, my neighbor coveted it and I had a perma-grin for a week because of the 335i. A good girlfriend told me that you couldn’t even see my baby bump when I was in the driver’s seat, so I just looked like a hottie in a hot car.\n\nThis is one stylish coupe. My test car’s beautiful Blue Water Metallic color was gorgeous. There are 12 metallic paint jobs you can choose from for the 335i; each costs about $550 extra, but I’d say they’re all worth that premium over the standard paint colors. How can you resist colors like Tasman Green Metallic, Monaco Blue Metallic and Mojave Metallic?\n\nAside from the fresh array of exterior color choices, the 335i is small in stature – it’s a coupe after all – and big on looks. It has a typically BMW-ish long hood and sits low to the ground as a performance vehicle should. It’s so low that even my 19-month-old could climb in on her own, which is a first.\n\nOnce my kids were in, even they noticed that this car was decidedly not our minivan. They thought they were cruising around in a racecar, and my son told everyone about his cool ride.\n\nThe standard star-spoke 17-inch wheels – you can opt to get 18- or 19-inch wheels should you desire – and dual chrome-plated exhaust tips are the finishing touches that make this car look just as sporty as it drives. My test car had the M Sport Package ($3,350), which gets you 18-inch wheels, rear parking sensors and an aerodynamic kit.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Not Really\n\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Groove-On\n\nInterior\n\nOnce inside the 335i coupe I realized that this car’s beauty is not skin deep; the inside is just as beautiful as the outside. My test car had a sleek, sporty black trim and Cream Beige leather seating ($1,450) that was smooth, soft and simply gorgeous. As part of the M Sport Package, my test car had sport seats that cradled me tightly and kept my body in place when I made this car work the road.\n\nBMW’s iDrive system is included as part of the optional navigation system, and you’ll have to pony up $2,100 for it. My first experience with iDrive a couple of years ago was not that pleasant. I found it difficult and confusing to operate. I can report that this time around it seems to have been made a bit more user-friendly with more shortcut keys and better functionality. Furthermore, the screen produces brilliant graphics that enhance the navigation experience.\n\nBecause the 335i is a coupe I can’t say that the backseat was particularly roomy, and I certainly wouldn’t have wanted to spend any length of time back there myself. While the Latch connectors were clearly marked, they were so deeply recessed that getting to them took some effort. After some maneuvering I was able to install my children’s convertible child-safety seats. Since this is not a car intended directly for pregnant moms of two small children, I’d say that’s a coup for this coupe. A rear-facing infant-safety seat would not fit in the backseat unless you wanted to push the front passenger through the windshield. This is a car I’d want in my garage just for me and I’d keep the minivan for toting the kiddies around.\n\nStorage is limited, with only two cupholders hidden in the dash and a couple of small, but efficient compartments on each door and in between the seats. The trunk can’t hold much more than a weekly grocery haul and forget about trying to put a regular-sized stroller in there. I overlooked these shortcomings for the week of my test drive, but it would be a problem if it were my everyday car. However, when I was cruising around in this lovely little car with the moonroof open and tunes blasting I almost forgot that there were two car seats and munchkins in the back – until my son started kicking my seatback.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\nSafety\n\nThe 335i has received scores of Good, the top rating, in frontal-offset, side-impact and rear crash tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. In past years those scores would earn it IIHS’ Top Safety Pick award. For 2010, IIHS has added a new roof-strength crash test to its Top Safety Pick requirements. The 335i hasn’t undergone this new crash test.\n\nThe coupe has standard antilock brakes with brake assist, an electronic stability system, traction control and active head restraints. It also has front- and side-impact airbags for the front passengers and side curtain airbags for both rows.\n\nAlso standard is BMW’s Advanced Safety System, which can connect you to the BMW Assist Response Center at anytime with a push of the SOS button located in the car. The center can help with stolen vehicle recovery, mechanical problems and even being locked out of your car. Should you have an accident, a call to the center is placed automatically.\n\nFAMILY LIFESTAGE\n\nIn Diapers: Rear-facing infant seats won’t fit and it’s a struggle to get convertible car seats installed.\n\nIn School: Kids will fit in the backseat, but there’s not a lot of legroom.\n\nTeens: This is one car a teen driver should never be allowed to drive. It’s just too much fun, which would lead to serious problems.",

      "expert_review": "Maybe you moved out of the big city to raise your family and then you bought a minivan. Maybe you eat more macaroni and cheese than you’d like and listen to more kid-inspired music than you once did. Maybe you feel like you’ve sold out, just a little bit.\n\nThere’s still hope for you; the 2012 BMW 3 Series is the car to help you break out of the vehicular lifestyle that’s been compromised by a growing family.\n\nFor 2012, the 335i sedan has been redesigned and it’s hard to find fault with it. It looks modern and athletic, and it drives the same way. I was so pleased to have an available six-speed manual transmission in my test car that I couldn’t have smiled any more during my test drive. The five-seater demands some sacrifices in the comfort department, though.\n\nThis car will make you feel like a speed demon with its turbocharged inline-six-cylinder engine. What’s really cool is my test car came with Efficient Dynamics, which means the engine shuts off at lights when the system is engaged. This saves gas and helps with emissions. But don’t confuse Efficient Dynamics with the Driving Dynamics system, wherein I could change the 335i’s driving characteristics. I could change from Eco Pro to Comfort to Sport to Sport+, which really means I could start off soft(ish) and move to more aggressive gearing and suspension settings.\n\nThe 2012 335i sedan has a starting price of $43,295, including an $895 destination charge. My test car cost $54,070.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe 2012 BMW 335i is sporty and clearly designed for someone who likes to drive and maybe show off a bit, but it doesn’t look too hoity-toity. Frankly, I felt like a bad-ass; how often does that happen unless I’m taking a kick-boxing class or giving the bully kid down the street a talking-to?\n\nThe sedan’s exterior looks sleek and slippery. The headlights are menacing with the LEDs glaring at fellow motorists. The rear end is refined and sinewy as well, with tapered taillights. The dual exhaust looks tough, and the chrome adds a bit of shine to the athletic look. Again, the 335i is not frou-frou, but lean and mean.\n\nVisibility out the rear window when the center head restraint is in place is hampered. To help with visibility issues, my test car came with a backup camera and side- and top-view cameras, which give a bird’s-eye view of the car and its surroundings. It’s cool, but they’re part of a $1,550 Parking Package.\n\nMy kids, ages 10 and 8, got in and out of the car easily, but small ones will want some help closing the doors. The trunk can hold a week’s worth of groceries or a compact stroller, but it’ll probably be taxed by a trip to a warehouse store.\n\nThe 300-horsepower, turbo 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder means that you go quickly whenever you choose. When paired with the standard eight-speed automatic transmission, the 335i sedan gets and EPA-estimated 23/33 mpg city/highway. With the available six-speed manual, it gets 20/30 mpg. This is a BMW, so it should come as no surprise that the 3 Series uses premium gas.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Groove-On\n\nINTERIOR\nThe 2012 335i sedan shouldn’t be confused with a luxury car. It’s luxurious in a pared-down sort of way, but it’s not cushy, chrome-y and wood accent-y. It follows the exterior’s theme in that it’s athletic and lean. Don’t expect a power lipstick applier, automatic dog groomer or any other over-the-top comfort-oriented gadgets, OK? This car is serious.\n\nIt’s so serious that it has a cupholder cover that looks like a shallow tray for a gadget. If you want to use the cupholder, you have to pry off (not very easily, I might add) the shelf to access it. When you do get the cover off, the cupholder is located precariously between the gearshift and the center stack — my least favorite locale. Fortunately, the front doors have bottleholders and all passenger doors have storage bins. Other storage is tough to come by, again refocusing you on driving the car and not much else.  \n\nThe iDrive multimedia system, which is standard on the sedan, is relatively easy to use. It has updated graphics and shortcut keys. Another fun feature is the head-up display that shows the car’s speed in a ghostlike readout on the windshield. Just when I think the car is a throwback to pure driving it gives me some futuristic features that I actually use. Well done, BMW.\n\nIn a car that mostly screams “sporty,” I loved the saddle brown, aka Venetian Beige, leather seats; the color added a bit of sophistication to the 335i’s athletic feel. Combined with the black dash and black carpet, it looked inviting. The eight-way power adjustable front seats are comfortable, though stiff and sporty. There was great legroom for all passengers, but it should be noted that only one of my kids still uses a booster seat now.\n\nThere are cupholders in the backseat that pop out of the top of the fold-down armrest. They reminded my family of a pop-up book. The rear passengers have netting on the front row’s seatbacks to stash some items, and there is also a pass-through to the trunk that my kids found entertaining. The rear seats split 40/20/40, too.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair-Ample\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2012 BMW 3 Series sedan has been named a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. To earn this safety nod, a car must receive the top score of Good in front, side, rear and roof-strength crash tests. The 3 Series sedan also earned top safety marks from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. It received an overall safety score of five stars of five. It earned five stars in side and rollover crash tests and four stars in frontal crash tests.\n\nBecause the 335i is driver-oriented, I figured its two sets of lower Latch anchors would be buried deep in the vehicle’s nether regions. But there they were in the outboard seats, so easy to access that it made my heart sing. However, those rear-facing child-safety seats will push front passenger space to its limits.\n\nThe 335i sedan has standard rear-wheel drive, antilock brakes with brake assist, an electronic stability system with traction control, active front head restraints, auto-leveling and adaptive bi-xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights and seven airbags, including a driver’s knee airbag and side curtains for both rows.\n\nOptional features include all-wheel drive, lane departure and blind spot warning systems, surround-view cameras, a backup camera, front and rear parking assist and Dynamic Cruise Control.\n\nGet more safety information about the BMW 335i here.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in February 2012 about the 2012 BMW 335. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2013, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nEditor’s note: This review, published in February 2012, originally cited EPA mileage estimates of 24/36 mpg city/highway for the 2012 BMW 328i sedan equipped with an automatic transmission. In a rare revision roughly one month later, the EPA lowered the rating to 23/33 mpg, as reflected in the updated review below. Mileage estimates for the manual 328i and all versions of the 335i sedan remain unchanged.\n\nIf the sport-sedan category were high school, the BMW 3 Series would be the captain of the football team, and maybe the debate squad … and the chess club. It’s popular (typically selling 90,000-100,000 units annually in the U.S.), and everyone wants to be like it (Cadillac is only the most recent example, boldly pitting its upcoming ATS sedan against the 3 Series in advertisements). And so it has always been.\n\nA classed-up, roomier interior, more power and substantially improved gas mileage breathe new life into the redesigned 2012 BMW 3 Series sedan, which should continue to dominate the sport-sedan market.\n\nOnly the 3 Series’ sedan version has been redone, entering its sixth generation in 328i and 335i guise. The coupe, convertible and ultimate-performance M3 will continue for two more model years in their current form. The previous-generation wagon is being sold as a 2012, and a redesign will come within the next year.\n\nOn sale now, the 2012 sedans come only with rear-wheel drive. Fall 2012 will see the addition of all-wheel-drive versions, with the “xi” suffix, along with the first-ever hybrid 3 Series, the ActiveHybrid3 sedan. The 335d clean-diesel variant is now out of production, but it will likely return once BMW develops a new four-cylinder diesel engine.\n\nAs of the sedan’s launch, the 328i and 335i both come in a base trim level plus three “lines” — Modern, Luxury and Sport. Each is an option package with its own interior theme and exterior cosmetic tweaks. The Sport line adds a few performance-oriented changes, as well. I tested all these versions.\n\nAutumn will bring a new trim level, called M Sport, with a more aggressive exterior and sport-themed interior touches. BMW is mum on the details, but M Sport packages typically include some performance enhancements, such as a sportier suspension.\n\nExterior & Styling\nBMW has closed the book on an awkward design era helmed by American-born chief designer Chris Bangle. The outgoing 3 Series is arguably the one BMW car that escaped more than a glancing blow from the Bangle ugly stick. Regardless, I still think the 2012 sedan improves on it, though plenty of observers deemed it too plain. The way the headlight assemblies flow into the more three-dimensional grilles gives the car a broad look that belies a slight decrease in width compared with the 2011. The car is almost 4 inches longer. The light clusters themselves improve on other recent BMW redesigns: Rather than a translucent-white eyelash that looks like it was meant to be removed after shipping, each of the new car’s headlights has a more pleasing silver stripe with LED accents.\n\nThe trim level determines the number and finish of the grille slats, with gloss black designating Sport, and chrome trim demarcating Luxury. Modern splits the difference with a brushed-aluminum look. The trim on the lower air intakes also varies among the three. The M Sport trim level will bring a more aggressive front end with larger grille openings, M-badged wheels and flared rocker panels.\n\nDrivetrain Revolution\nThe biggest news for the 2012 sedan is its improved drivetrains, including the 328i model’s new engine, whose power and efficiency is better than that of the 2011 328i. That’s despite it having a four-cylinder engine in place of an inline-six-cylinder — something BMW hasn’t sold here since 1999’s 318i. What’s different about this engine? Direct injection, variable valve timing and a twin-scroll turbocharger — technologies that BMW groups together and calls “TwinPower Turbo.”\n\nEquipped with either a six-speed manual or a new eight-speed automatic transmission, the 328i takes off with authority. You’d never know you were driving a four-cylinder, and definitely not a turbo four. The torque is almost immediate. Though the power rating has increased only 10 horsepower over the 2011 sedan, to 240 hp, torque is up 60 pounds-feet, to 260, and it comes at 1,250 rpm, down from 2,750 rpm. (See the two model years compared.)\n\nSure enough, when I drove an automatic 328i on the highway, even when climbing moderate inclines the tachometer needle hovered below 1,500 rpm. Brilliant. This explains the automatic’s EPA-estimated 23/33 mpg city/highway, a healthy increase from 2011’s 18/28 mpg with either transmission. The six-speed-manual sedan has a 1 mpg advantage on the highway: 23/34 mpg. There’s another upside to the stick: a slightly faster zero-to-60 mph time, according to BMW. It hits 60 in 5.7 seconds, and the automatic takes 5.9 seconds. It’s no longer a given that a manual is quicker, and while the BMW eight-speed shifts quickly, it’s not the type of dual-clutch transmission that always shifts faster than a human could. And because the manual has taller gears, you can hit 60 mph after just one gear change.\n\nBear in mind that we’re talking about the 328i here, not the more powerful 335i, whose drivetrain is unchanged versus 2011 but for the eight-speed automatic replacing the earlier six-speed. Its turbocharged, 3.0-liter inline-six engine produces 300 hp and 300 pounds-feet of torque. You feel and hear the difference with the six-cylinder’s greater urgency and pleasing exhaust note. (The 328i sounds respectable when accelerating, but at idle it has a faint diesel sound. While direct-injection engines perform well, their mechanical sound is often raucous.) BMW rates the 335i’s zero-to-60 time at 5.4 seconds.\n\nClass-Leading Mileage\nThe 328i’s estimated combined city/highway mileage is 26 mpg, or 27 with the manual, compared with 22 mpg for either transmission in 2011. For comparison, the most efficient versions of the Audi A4 and Mercedes-Benz C-Class are rated 25 mpg, despite their lesser power. The 335i also gets a bump for 2012, from 19/28 to 20/30 mpg with the manual and from 19/28 to 23/33 mpg with the automatic. With a combined 26 mpg, the automatic 335i beats the comparable Mercedes C350’s 23 mpg and Infiniti G37’s 22 mpg.\n\nSometimes dramatic mileage improvements come with tradeoffs, but the 3 Series’ are few. As I detailed in my 5 Series review, BMW’s Efficient Dynamics provisions include regenerative braking, whereby the car’s alternator charges its battery when coasting and braking but decouples from the engine when accelerating. In the 5 Series, overly aggressive regeneration with the automatic transmission resulted in nonlinear braking unbefitting the “ultimate driving machine.” Blessedly, this doesn’t seem to be the case with the 2012 3 Series.\n\nAs noted, the car is quicker than ever. The eight-speed shifts quickly and smoothly, and it doesn’t hesitate too long before kicking down to pass, especially when in the Driving Dynamics Control’s selectable Comfort or Sport modes, which also vary the accelerator and power steering responsiveness. A new Eco Pro mode makes the accelerator resistant to accelerating (unless you floor it) and the transmission quick to upshift to more efficient gears. It also puts at the bottom of the tachometer a simple gauge to help you drive conservatively. The 3 Series’ product manager said he achieved 41 mpg on the highway in this mode by “hypermiling,” a strategy known alternately as “clogging traffic” and “driving like a pansy.”\n\nIt looks like we’re moving past the era when low-rolling-resistance tires could be called traction resistant. Despite having the word “efficient” in their name, the Goodyear EfficientGrip 18-inch summer tires delivered on the “grip” aspect as well. (Continental ContiSport Contact and Pirelli Cinturato tires were also fitted to test cars; multiple brands are supplying original-equipment rubber.) That’s one more step forward for efficiency without the usual step back.\n\nMinor Mileage Tradeoff\nThe one failure among the mileage provisions is the standard auto start-top feature that shuts the engine off at a complete stop and restarts it when you take your foot off the brake (automatic transmission) or depress the clutch (manual). The best thing I can say about auto stop-start is that it couldn’t be simpler to turn off: The defeat button is adjacent to the engine-start button. You’ll probably make good use of it, because the engines restart awkwardly. The 335i is smoother than the 328i, but neither compares to the smoothness we’ve come to expect from hybrids. Even Porsche’s conspicuous start-stop feature is better than this. Where those sound and feel comparatively seamless, the 3 Series sounds and feels like an engine being started, and does so with more vibration than when you push the starter button after getting in the car.\n\nAs I say frequently these days, and consistently about updated BMW models, you don’t need the engine upgrade. The 328i will probably further diminish the 335’s share of sales — roughly 30 percent at the end of the 2011 model year. However, the difference between the two is clear: The 335i is substantially more exciting. If you have any intention of driving your 3 Series on a racetrack, this is the better one. On California’s Laguna Seca, I consistently found myself braking too late in the 328i, trying desperately to hold onto the speed I’d worked to build. The 335i had the extra guts needed to achieve appropriate speeds.\n\nSofter, But Still BMW\nLike many recent BMW redesigns, the 3 Series has been softened. The regular suspension in the base, Modern and Luxury lines isolates road imperfections better than the previous generation did, but it also allows more body motions, including a surprising degree of body roll — something that’s no longer an unavoidable tradeoff. Regardless, the car retains its legendary front/rear balance after mild understeer going into corners.\n\nThe redesign replaces conventional hydraulic power steering with electric power assist. Of its type, it’s well-executed. I wouldn’t say it’s quite as good as the old standard in terms of feedback, but the assist level isn’t erratic with speed changes, as some electric systems are. Speaking of erratic, the controversial active-steering option has been discontinued, replaced by a more straightforward variable-ratio steering option that gives more steering angle from less turn of the wheel.\n\nThe Sport line sits 10 mm lower on a firmer suspension arrangement. This is also the only version eligible for an adaptive suspension, a $900 option, which I drove. It feels more like the earlier generation, with better body control and livable ride quality. The Sport setting is notably firmer than Comfort, but not as punishing as early examples of this technology.\n\nTo be frank, for a car BMW claims is purchased primarily for its athletic driving experience, all 3 Series versions could get away with the Sport line’s firmer ride.\n\nIn the Cabin\nSpeaking of getting away with things, how do cars like the 3 Series and Mercedes-Benz C-Class get away with imitation-leather seats in their base trim levels? It’s convincing vinyl, but still. Imitation-metal trim also blows the base 3’s cover, but the finishes are otherwise high-quality. Soft-touch surfaces extend all the way down to the lowest door panels.\n\nAll three trim lines dial up the quality with leather upholstery, though in the 328i, power adjustments come bundled with other features in a separate $3,600 option package. Power seats are standard in the 335i. The Sport line has sport front seats with more prominent side bolsters. The aluminum trim in the Sport Line is patterned and textured — something I’d expect from Audi, and that’s a good thing. The Modern line I tested had beige gauge faces to match the color palette, and “open-pored” wood trim, which has raised grain as if it’s been rubbed down, creating what looks like sand drifts. I like the idea because it’s so unique, but it doesn’t look like real wood. Perhaps a light stain would be a better approach.\n\nThe front seats have nice, long travel for plenty of legroom. The 2012’s added overall length and wheelbase go right to backseat legroom, which was badly needed. Legroom still comes at the mercy of front-seat occupants, but I won’t penalize BMW for having generous front seat travel. The floor is high enough to raise your knees more than I appreciate, but short trips — and shorter passengers — should be fine.\n\nErgonomic Hits & Misses\nThe design and layout are characteristically simple but more stylish than the previous generation. There are ergonomic hits and misses. The big hit: After a history of half-assed spring-loaded cupholders, BMW has finally given in and incorporated two functional wells in the center console close to the dashboard. As if embarrassed by this sop to American thirst, BMW supplies a removable cover that hides them and doubles as a tray for “oddments.”\n\nThe Driving Dynamics Control buttons are now a rocker switch in the style of other recent BMW redesigns. It allows you to cycle through the various modes without pushing a bunch of separate buttons. The iDrive multifunction controller is now standard with a 6.5-inch display, and, similar to the cupholders, BMW has finally gotten it right. (The navigation option adds an 8.8-inch screen.) Though it’s not my favorite, the manual shifter improves on the previous generation’s. It feels more connected.\n\nUnfortunately, the new 3’s automatic transmission still has the springy toggle-style gear selector, and the turn-signal stalk similarly springs back to center rather than staying in position until the turn is complete. If there’s a benefit to this design, it isn’t the driver’s.\n\nThe trunk is now a respectable 13.7 cubic feet, up from 12 in the previous generation. Less respectable is having to pay extra for a folding backseat — another infraction for which BMW and Mercedes are never prosecuted. In the upcoming ActiveHybrid3, the optional folding backseat is completely unobstructed, making it one of the only hybrid sedans to accomplish this goal.\n\nConnectivity\nBy today’s standards, the 3 Series’ connectivity and iPhone integration is extensive, and includes standard BMW Assist, similar to GM’s OnStar. In a car with the BMW Apps option, an iPhone with the free BMW Connected app allows many features to be controlled by iDrive: Web Radio, Pandora and MOG internet radio, a calendar, Twitter, Facebook and Last Mile. No other Smartphones are currently supported.\n\nSafety\nAs of its introduction, the 2012 3 Series hadn’t been crash-tested. Standard safety equipment includes frontal airbags and side curtains that protect front and rear occupants in side impacts. The front seats also have side-impact airbags and active head restraints. As is required of all 2012 and later models, the 3 Series includes antilock brakes and an electronic stability system with traction control.\n\n3 Series in the Market\nThough the 2012 3 Series has been softened a bit, it remains a leader in drivability and, now, in mileage, with no accompanying compromise. Combine this with its strong reputation and a brand cachet that companies like Audi, Cadillac and Infiniti haven’t achieved, and it seems untouchable. The 3 Series sells almost as many units annually as the Audi A4 and Mercedes C-Class combined, and I see no reason to expect a change.\n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "The Ultimate Driving Machine has never come cheap, and BMW’s newest addition to its 3 Series lineup, the 2011 335is, hammers that tradition home. About $50,000 gets you a stick-shift coupe with vinyl upholstery and a CD stereo incapable of fully integrating your iPod. Genuine leather, heated seats and the other niceties cost more. If BMW ran a steakhouse, it would charge extra for the sides with your filet.\n\nGot beef with that? So did I, until I drove it.\n\nThe 335is combines outstanding performance with surprising livability, and the whole package is good enough to justify its high price — for those few who choose to pay it, anyway.\n\nBMW has added an extra “s” to models from the Z4 roadster to the X5 SUV, and as with both of those, the 335is offers more power and racier styling cues than the standard 335i. It slots between that car and the top-dog M3, but it’s closer to the 335i in terms of handling and acceleration. The 3 Series lineup also includes the entry-level 328i and a diesel-powered 335d. Depending what you get, the 3 Series can be had in sedan, wagon, coupe and convertible body styles. I drove a 335is coupe, but we’ve tested most of the other variants in years past.\n\n‘S’ Styling\n\nThe 335is coupe looks the part of a track-ready 3 Series whose owner has explored the aftermarket’s tasteful half. The front bumper flanks a lower air dam with larger openings, designed to feed air to an additional radiator on the driver side and an oil cooler on the passenger side. The belt line adds some glossy black window trim and black mirrors, and the tail gets a lower air diffuser. Eighteen-inch wheels replace the coupe’s standard 17-inchers; 19s are optional. It’s worth noting that BMW offers a smorgasbord of trim combinations, and you can get something similar to the 335is’ appearance on a lesser 3 Series coupe by adding various ground-effects packages.\n\nOn the heels of a midcycle cosmetic update to the 3 Series sedan and wagon, the coupe and convertible 3 Series received some modest styling enhancements this year, including a number of cues from recent BMW redesigns: the Z4’s horizontal bumper strakes and the 5 Series’ white headlight liners. For a fresher look that falls short of a full redesign, it gets the job done.\n\nWell-Rounded Performance\n\nRather than use the 335i’s new twin-scroll, turbocharged six-cylinder, the 335is goes with the old twin-turbo six, with higher turbo boost and bolstered cooling to churn out 320 horsepower and 332 pounds-feet of torque. The car feels palpably quicker than the 300-hp 335i: It spins its rear tires away from stoplights, scoots in the passing lane at 70 mph and bellows a rich, satisfying exhaust note all the way to its 7,000-rpm redline. While the M3’s normally aspirated, 414-hp V-8 packs explosive acceleration at higher revs — and in absolute terms it’s significantly quicker — its comparatively modest 295 pounds-feet of torque means it doesn’t get cooking until the tach needle swings past 3,000 rpm. The 335is has power to spare long before that mark.\n\nA six-speed manual transmission is standard, and that’s what we tested. BMW tweaked its gearing versus the manual 335i: 1st gear is shorter, with a marginally taller 2nd, 3rd and 4th. With short throws and precise engagements, the 335is’ shifter is a lot of fun to send from one gear to the next. The shifter comes from BMW’s M division, and it’s a major standout over the 3 Series’ standard one, whose long, rubbery throws are a low point in that car.\n\nOptional on the 335is is the seven-speed, dual-clutch automatic that BMW typically reserves for the M3 and other high-performance cars; lesser 3 Series cars have a conventional six-speed automatic.\n\nThe 335is gets the same brakes as the 335i: large, 13.7-inch front and 13.2-inch rear discs, with standard antilock braking. The pedal delivers strong, linear response that makes it easy to stop exactly how you’d like.\n\nLike any 3 Series, the rear-wheel-drive 335is benefits from near-50/50 weight distribution — slightly closer to it, in fact, than the rear-drive 335i coupe. The car rotates on its axis marvelously, with the sort of fine-tuned control that allows you to slide out the tail, tuck it back in line and fly down the road without having to practice much. Open it up at low rpm, and BMW says the engine can go into a temporary overboost mode that cranks out as much as 370 pounds-feet of torque. That comes in handy during those sideways moments.\n\nThe steering wheel has excellent feedback and turn-in precision. Sans BMW’s Active Steering system — a pricey option that varies steering ratio, not just assist — our test car required a lot of effort to turn at low speeds. Active Steering addresses this, and it’s worth looking into.\n\nWith tuning similar to the 335i’s sport suspension, the 335is displays admirable ride comfort. You feel bumps on the highway, but the suspension takes the edge off them remarkably well. We drove the 335is back-to-back with a Cadillac CTS coupe and Infiniti G37 Sport coupe. The Cadillac’s ride was softer, but it introduced a degree of suspension float that was absent from the other two. The G37 Sport’s suspension was less forgiving all around. Goldilocks would choose the 335is, and so would we.\n\nThe Inside\n\nLittle has changed inside the 3 Series over the past few years. The latest generation of BMW’s knob-based iDrive controller — introduced last year —  is vastly improved over earlier iDrives and comes with an optional navigation system in the 335is. Otherwise, cabin materials aren’t anything special; in this segment, Cadillac and Audi have better overall quality inside. In its current form since the 2006 model year, the 3 Series’ cabin is showing its age.\n\nSome may find the highly bolstered sport seats in the 335is constraining, and their manually adjustable thigh supports leave a gap in the seat cushions that’s certain to attract crumbs and loose change. While the 3 Series sedan has a rather cramped backseat for its league, the coupe’s thankfully doesn’t sacrifice much more space; headroom and legroom decrease less than an inch apiece, making it fairly roomy, as coupes go. The 3 Series convertible, on the other hand, loses nearly 2 more inches of rear legroom. Unlike the coupe, it’s cramped in there.\n\nSafety & Features\n\nThe 3 Series coupe hasn’t been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. The 3 Series sedan and convertible have been tested, but their results aren’t transferrable. The convertible received underwhelming Marginal ratings for side impacts, but earned Good marks in front and rear tests. IIHS has not yet conducted roof-crush tests for the 3 Series convertible.\n\nThe 335is’ standard safety features include dual front, side-impact and side curtain airbags. Like other 3 Series convertibles, the droptop 335is lacks curtain airbags, but its seat-mounted side airbags extend higher for head protection. It also has dual knee airbags in front. Antilock brakes and an electronic stability system are also standard. Click here for a full list of safety features.\n\nStandard features on the 335is include xenon headlights, faux leather upholstery, dual-zone automatic climate control, power front seats, a moonroof, and a CD stereo with steering-wheel audio controls. Real leather is optional. It’s standard on the 335is convertible, which costs about $8,500 more than the coupe. Other options on both include heated seats, a Harman Kardon premium audio system, a navigation system and rear parking sensors. Go hog wild with the options, and you can add well over $10,000 to your 335is’ price tag.\n\n335is in the Market\n\nThere’s no praise like sales, and the 3 Series continues to be among the top-selling luxury cars on the market. In the array of options in the model lineup, the 335is is likely to remain a niche member, but it does everything it sets out to do and sacrifices remarkably little to get there. It’s not inexpensive, and at its performance limits it behaves more like a 335i than an M3. But there are many drivers who don’t want to wring their cars out to 8,000 rpm for maximum performance, and the 335is offers them a different flavor. I suspect enough performance enthusiasts will appreciate it to warrant its addition to the 3 Series lineup.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",
