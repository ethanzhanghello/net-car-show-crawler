The 740i has a 375-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder engine and is available with rear- or all-wheel drive (which BMW calls “xDrive”). The 760i gets standard AWD and a 536-hp, twin-turbo 4.4-liter mild-hybrid V-8. There’s also a new plug-in hybrid variant for 2024 named the 750e (details below). All engines are matched with an eight-speed automatic transmission. BMW also offers an all-electric version of the 7 Series named the i7 (reviewed separately on Cars.com). The 7 Series’ competitors include the Audi A8, Genesis G90, Lexus LS 500 and Mercedes-Benz S-Class. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 BMW 7 Series?\n\nFollowing the car’s complete redesign for 2023, the 7 Series’ model lineup expands for 2024. The 740i is now offered with AWD in addition to RWD, and the AWD-only 750e PHEV joins the roster. The 750e combines a turbo 3.0-liter six-cylinder engine with an electric motor for a total of 483 hp, and it’s EPA-rated at 33 miles of all-electric range on a full charge. \n\nAll 7 Series models get updated iDrive infotainment system software; it’s now version 8.5.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 BMW 7 Series Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nFixed-glass moonroof\nKeyless entry and start\nFour-zone automatic climate control\nHeated front and rear seats\nHeated steering wheel\nHead-up display\n12.3-inch digital instrument cluster\n14.9-inch infotainment touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nNavigation\nBowers & Wilkins surround-sound audio system\nForward collision warning\nBlind spot warning\nFront and rear parking sensors\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nAdaptive air suspension\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nPanoramic Sky Lounge LED Roof\nHeated and ventilated front and rear seats\nMassaging front and rear seats\nRear-seat entertainment system with 31.3-inch screen\nReclining rear seats \nLane departure steering assist\nLane departure warning\nHands-free low-speed highway driving system\nFour-wheel steering\nActive suspension with road preview\nShould I Buy the 2024 BMW 7 Series?\n\nEven by large luxury-car standards, the BMW 7 Series is a technological tour de force. It offers a broad range of high-tech available features, including gee-whiz options like a widescreen rear-entertainment monitor that powers down from the headliner, as well as smartphone-sized touchscreen controls built into the rear door panels. An impressive lineup of smooth, strong powertrains and surprisingly crisp handling for a big car are other highlights. Prices are steep, however, and the 7 Series’ exterior styling is polarizing. Some controls are finicky, and the standard equipment list isn’t as extensive as it should be at these prices.",

      "expert_review": "BMW’s flagship sedan is fully redesigned for 2023, gaining provocative new styling, larger dimensions, lots of new technology features and an all-electric model named the i7. We have a full review of the i7 coming soon, and we have some quick-spin impressions of the current flagship of the gasoline-engine 7 Series models (760i xDrive) right here.\n\nRelated: 2023 BMW 7 Series Adds Electric Model, Movie Theater Backseat\n\nI got behind the wheel of the new 760i for a brief test drive at the Midwest Automotive Media Association’s 2023 Spring Rally in Elkhart Lake, Wisc., and also explored a few of the ultra-luxe optional features while the car was parked. I had nowhere near enough time to fully explore all the features and details of BMW’s largest car, but I got a good taste of things nonetheless.\n\nPlentiful Power, Drives Smaller Than It Is\n\nUnlike its previous-generation predecessor, the new 760i has V-8 power; BMW retired its V-12 powerplant with some fanfare on a special run of a dozen fully loaded M760i xDrive sedans. The new 760i’s twin-turbocharged 4.4-liter V-8 engine might not be quite as powerful or have the same exotic-car cred as the old V-12, but it’s more than up to the task of powering this plus-size sedan with authority. The engine is rated at 536 horsepower and 553 pounds-feet of torque, the drivetrain incorporates a 48-volt mild-hybrid system, and it’s paired with a new eight-speed automatic transmission. All-wheel drive is standard, as is a rear-wheel-steering system that aids both low- and high-speed maneuverability.\n\nThe 760i is a big, heavy car — its curb weight is nearly 5,000 pounds — but it drives smaller and lighter than it is thanks to its rear-wheel steering and prodigious power. BMW claims a 0-60-mph time of just 4.1 seconds, and the car felt easily that quick by the seat of my pants. The V-8’s noise is impressively muted; it’s almost inaudible until you dip deeply into the throttle, then emits a satisfyingly muscular V-8 growl. And even with the 21-inch wheels and low-profile tires on our test car, the ride was suitably supple (an adaptive air suspension is standard).\n\nClassy, Tech-Forward Interior\n\nAny all-new flagship luxury vehicle had better impress when it comes to interior ambiance, and the new 7 Series does. The materials and fit and finish are truly top notch; a carbon-fiber trim insert on the dashboard, intricately patterned speaker grilles on the doors, crystalline Glass Controls on the center console and individual smartphone-style touchscreen controls built into the rear door panels are but a few of the standout details. Our test car also wore unusual upholstery: In addition to the expected premium leather was an unconventional brocade-style cloth that reminded me of the paisley-patterned upholstery in the 1970 Buick Electra 225 my parents had when I was a kid.\n\nThe new interaction bar and ambient lighting panel that stretches across the dashboard and into the front door panels is another unorthodox touch, but not entirely in a good way. I had a difficult time seeing the markings for the virtual buttons due to normal daylight reflections and the panel’s faceted surface. And all those shiny virtual buttons and the Glass Controls in the console show smudges and fingerprints very easily. Still, I’m very much looking forward to driving this car at night because with all the configurable ambient lighting features of the dashboard light bar and the rest of the cabin, the after-dark vibe inside will likely be more dazzling than most night clubs.\n\nThat said, the 760i does have a bewildering array of controls that will require lots of familiarization, and some of the design choices seem to favor style over functionality. The hidden climate-control vents in the dashboard are needlessly complicated and didn’t seem to be effective; I had the fan speed on high and the air flow was disappointingly weak.\n\nGee-whiz available technology features abound. The Rear Executive Lounge Seating option includes a colossal 31.3-inch widescreen rear-entertainment display that powers down from the headliner. We didn’t have the opportunity for a full demo, but it looks to provide a real movie-theater experience for rear-seat passengers. The option package also includes reclining rear seatbacks with a power-extending leg rest for the passenger-side rear seat — an indulgent feature to be sure, but at 6 feet, 6 inches tall, I didn’t have quite enough space; my feet were hitting the front-passenger seatback.\n\nA Big Price Bump\n\nThe 2023 BMW 760i starts at $117,395 (prices include destination), a bump of more than $13,000 from 2022’s V-8-powered 750i — and that’s just for starters. The test car we drove was loaded up with a lot of options that pushed its bottom-line price to $162,045. The priciest items on the options list were the Black Sapphire Metallic two-tone paint ($12,000) over Aventurin Red Metallic, the Rear Executive Lounge Seating ($7,250) and a BMW Individual Composition coordinated Alcantara simulated-suede headliner ($5,450). Serious money all, but for that coin, buyers will get an exceptionally quick, capable executive express with an almost bewildering array of technology and comfort features.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nBMW Gives More Electric Options for 2024 i4, 7 Series Lineups\nBMW Unveils 2024 i7 M70 xDrive, Most Powerful EV BMW Has Ever Produced\n2023 BMW XM Review: Indulge if You Dare\n2023 BMW X7 Review: Fantastic, But Rapidly Approaching Overly Frustrating\nShop for a 2023 BMW 760i\n\nRelated Video: \n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

The 7 Series’ competitors include the Audi A8, Genesis G90, Lexus LS 500 and Mercedes-Benz S-Class. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 BMW 7 Series?\n\nAfter a complete redesign for 2023 and the addition of the 750e PHEV and AWD 740i for 2024, the 7 Series sees only minor alterations in its standard and available equipment for 2025.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 BMW 7 Series Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nPanoramic Sky Lounge LED Roof\nKeyless entry and start\nFour-zone automatic climate control\nHeated front and rear seats\nHeated steering wheel\nHead-up display\n12.3-inch digital instrument cluster\n14.9-inch infotainment touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nNavigation\nBowers & Wilkins surround-sound audio system\nForward collision warning\nBlind spot warning\nFront and rear parking sensors\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nAdaptive air suspension\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nHeated and ventilated front and rear seats\nMassaging front and rear seats\nRear-seat entertainment system with 31.3-inch screen\nReclining rear seats \nLane-centering steering\nLane departure warning\nHands-free low-speed highway driving system\nFour-wheel steering\nActive suspension with road preview\nShould I Buy the 2025 BMW 7 Series?\n\nEven by large luxury-car standards, the BMW 7 Series is a technological tour de force. It offers a broad range of high-tech available features, including gee-whiz options like a widescreen rear entertainment monitor that powers down from the headliner. There are also smartphone-size touchscreen controls built into the rear door panels. An impressive lineup of smooth, strong powertrains and surprisingly crisp handling for a big car are other highlights. Prices are steep, however, and the 7 Series’ exterior styling is polarizing. Some controls are finicky, and the standard equipment list isn’t as extensive as it should be at these prices.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nBMW’s flagship 7 Series is a full-size luxury sedan that competes with top-line luxury cars like the Audi A8, Jaguar XJ and Mercedes-Benz S-Class. The V-8-powered 750 comes in regular and extended lengths with rear- or all-wheel drive. The luxury sedan is available with four or five seats, and there’s also a six-cylinder 740 as well as a V-12 760, an ActiveHybrid 750 and a performance-oriented Alpina B7.\n\nNew for 2012\nAll models add a standard iPod/USB adapter, sport steering wheel and a backup camera. V-8 models gain 19-inch wheels with all-season tires and a premium stereo.  In a cost-cutting move, the ActiveHybrid 750 loses its standard leather dashboard, head-up display, and active and ventilated front seats.\n\nExterior\nThe current 7 Series adopts more conservative styling than its predecessor. It’s also a bit larger. The optional M Sport Package augments the exterior with more aggressive lower bodywork and darker Shadowline door and window trim. Exterior features include:\n\n\nExtended-length versions are 5.5 inches longer\nAluminum roof, doors, hood and front fenders for decreased weight\nOptional high-beam assist automatically dims high beams for oncoming drivers\nStandard xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights\nStandard adaptive headlights move with steering wheel\n18-inch wheels\nOptional 19- or 20-inch wheels\n21-inch wheels (Alpina B7)\n\nInterior\nAn array of entertainment and comfort features is available. BMW’s iDrive system, which controls the navigation system, stereo, climate control and other functions, was revised in recent years to make it more user-friendly. Interior features include:\n\n\n10.2-inch dashboard screen for iDrive\nFour-zone climate control, including independent control for rear passengers\nOptional rear massaging and ventilated seats\nOptional rear entertainment system with dual screens in head restraints\nOptional head-up display\nOptional night vision with pedestrian detection\n\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe engine lineup includes a 315-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder for the 740; a 4.4-liter V-8 for the 750, Alpina B7 and ActiveHybrid models; and a 6.0-liter V-12 with 535 hp for the 760. The V-8 produces 400 hp in the 750, 440 hp in the ActiveHybrid 750 and 500 hp in the Alpina B7. All engines have twin turbochargers. The ActiveHybrid 750 has lithium-ion batteries, which power an electric motor that assists the V-8 during acceleration.\n\nThe 750 and Alpina B7 are available with rear-wheel drive or xDrive all-wheel drive, which can send up to 80 percent of power to the rear wheels if needed, keeping acceleration and handling traits similar to those of the rear-wheel-drive 7 Series. Mechanical features include:\n\n\nSix-speed automatic transmission (six-cylinder and V-8 models)\nEight-speed automatic transmission (ActiveHybrid 750 and V-12)\nRear- or all-wheel drive\n\nSafety\nSafety features include:\n\n\nStandard side curtain airbags\nStandard front-seat side-impact airbags\nStandard knee airbags\nStandard electronic stability system\nOptional lane departure warning system\nOptional blind spot monitoring system",

      "expert_review": "High performance or high luxury.\n\nUsually you get one or the other, performance or pampering, but not both.\n\nExcept in the BMW 760Li — providing pockets or purse are very deep.\n\nThe 760Li is a poster child for what a car can do if you are ready, willing and able to spend some money.\n\nOne of the fabulous frills is night vision. Whether late at night or traveling in rain, snow or fog, you can feel a little safer by being able to see vehicles in the road or animals or people wandering alongside the road up to 1,000 feet.\n\nThe system employs heat-detecting sensors to spot the objects, which it shows on the navigation system screen. If it gives off heat — human or animal, car or motorcycle, it will glow on the screen.\n\nAs an added benefit, if someone is lurking in the bushes near the house when you arrive home at night, the heat detection sensors in your night vision give you an early warning. And don’t tell the teens, but the night vision also will tattle on them if they sneak out for a cruise. When Mom and Dad return home, the night vision screen will show the warm glow coming from the hood of the teen’s recently driven car.\n\nNight vision runs $2,200, however, a seriously high price to spot deer in the road, people in the bushes or wayward teens. It was first offered in the 760 in 2006 and for 2008 will be offered in 5- and 6-Series cars for the first time.\n\nAnother pricey option is the “coolbox” a mini fridge behind the rear-seat armrest. The tab is $1,800. At that price it better be really good water or really flavorful pop that you are cooling to 40 degrees. Have to remember, however, to press the button on the door to activate the cooling mechanism — and to drink the pop or water in a reasonable time span because when the engine is off, the fridge shuts off and your cool drink quickly warms. And $1,800 is a stiff price to pay for warm water or pop.\n\nAnother problem with the fridge is that its compressor behind the rear seat robs a hefty portion of trunk space. Given a choice between holding a couple cold bottles of pop in the back seat or four sets of golf clubs in the trunk, BMW says the golf clubs usually win. Other high priced goodies on the 760 Li include adaptive cruise control at $2,200 to reduce engine power and/or apply the brakes to slow the car if it gets too close to the vehicle ahead when cruise control is engaged; and a DVD entertainment system at another $2,200 to watch movies in the back seat. A flip-over video screen sits atop the center console.\n\nThe DVD system uses an iDrive control just like the one the driver has upfront to control everything from radio station of choice to when the doors should automatically lock or unlock.\n\nBe advised that iDrive isn’t as bad as some people insist it is. Yes, it is overly complex, but it takes no more than two, three model years tops to learn how to program all the electrical sensors to customize all the control settings to your liking. If you’re not a computer geek, however, it’s the system from Hell created by Lucifer himself.\n\nCan’t understand BMW’s belief that folks enjoy spending their hard earned inheritance on a vehicle that turns the simplist of tasks into a monumental chore. There’s no disgrace in using buttons like all other cars do.\n\nAnother extra-cost goodie is the comfort access system, which sounds as if you push a button to regulate seat softness. Nope. This is the keyless ignition system. Press a button in the dash to start or stop the engine — as long as you are carrying the fob with the magic. Though it eliminates having to put a key in the ignition slot, what do you really gain?\n\nRather than a long gearshift lever, you get a mini lever behind the wheel to engage drive, reverse or park. Cute, but why not put it closer to the driver for easier use?\n\nHighest priced option of all is the Individual Composition. No, you don’t have to write a term paper to get a 760; for $10,000, you get leather upholstery and headliner, illuminated doorsills, storage net in the passenger footwall and 20-inch performance radials. But you also have to purchase ruby black metallic paint for $3,000.\n\nExpensive list of options on a car with an impressive list of standard features, which should be no surprise considering it starts at $121,400.\n\nDynamic stability control and traction control are standard to rivet the sedan to the pavement whether the road follows a straight line, twists and turns, is wet or dry.\n\nThere’s also roll stabilization to keep wheels side down, electronic damping control to ensure the suspension doesn’t fidget over uneven pavement, self-leveling suspension so a cabin full of people or a trunk full of luggage doesn’t affect handling or braking and four-wheel anti-lock brakes for sure-footed stops whenever and whereever.\n\nAnd there are the little things — rain-sensing wipers, headlamp washers, side-curtain air bags, front-seat knee protection to keep from submarining under the dash and headlights that move in the direction of the turn.\n\nOther niceties include heated and cooled front and rear seats so you can cool your butt as well as your beverage; power rear seats that not only motor forward, but also recline; and a button that allows the rear-seat passenger to motor the front passenger seat forward to increase rear seat leg room, best done when the front seat is empty, of course.\n\nLike any BMW, the car is aimed at those who pay attention to a vehicle’s performance, its ability to leap into action from the stop sign, accelerate into and out of twists in the road, and stop on the proverbial dime and leaving change.\n\nThe 760 is powered by a 6-liter, 438-horsepower, 48-valve V-12 engine with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Lots of energy to move the mini limo. But that comes at a cost — a 14 m.p.g. city/22 m.p.g. highway rating and a $1,700 gas guzzler tax.\n\nIronic that people frown at a sport-utility but fawn over a BMW, which similarly gulps gas.\n\n– – –\n\n2007 BMW 760Li\n\nPrice as tested: $144,780*\n\nWheelbase: 123.2 inches\n\nLength: 203.9 inches\n\nEngine: 6-liter, 438-h.p., 48-valve V-12\n\nTransmission: 6-speed automatic\n\nFuel economy: 14 m.p.g. city/22 m.p.g. highway\n\n* Add $1,700 for gas-guzzler tax and $695 for freight.\n\nTHE STICKER\n\n$121,400 Base\n\n$10,000 Individual composition with 20-inch performance tires, leather upholstery and headliner, illuminated door sills and storage net in passenger footwall\n\n$3,000 Ruby black metallic paint\n\n$2,200 Rear seat DVD entertainment system with iDrive controller\n\n$2,200 Active cruise control\n\n$2,200 Night vision\n\n$1,800 Rear-seat climate-control coolbox (fridge)\n\n$1,000 Comfort access system (keyless ignition)\n\n$595 Satellite radio\n\n$385 Rear-seat side-impact air bags\n\nPLUSES\n\nMini limo.\n\nScads of power from the V-12.\n\nHandles like built for the track.\n\nMINUSES\n\nDrive complexity.\n\nGuzzler tax.",

      "expert_review": "BMW AG’s flagship sedan — the long-wheelbase, 12-cylinder 760Li — is one of those vehicles that churns up conflicting emotions.\n\nStratospherically priced from $115,800, the big 7-series fairly bristles with enough high-tech gadgetry to baffle an aerospace engineer, and its distinctively styled rear end has elicited howls of protest from many aficionados.\n\nBut the 760Li also comes with a supremely comfortable cockpit, a supple suspension and a potent power plant.\n\nIs that enough to justify the $122,095 sticker on our 2003 test vehicle? Read on.\n\nSHE: What’s not to like about a car that squeezes your behind? I felt like I was sitting on a pulsating whoopee cushion in the 7-series, with its Active Comfort seats, which move each side of your bottom up and down every 60 seconds. Why? To prevent fatigue and improve posture, according to BMW.\n\nHE: I’m not even sure where to go with this little hand grenade you’ve tossed me. It’s mighty tempting, but I think I’m gonna let this one slide. Before we get into the really heavy stuff, let’s talk about that magnificent rear compartment in the 760.\n\nSHE: Well, how can you not love a car with a precious little minicooler built into the back seat? It was perfect for that special bottle of 1990 Morey-Saint-Denis that my neighbor gave me when my dog died. Our test car also had rear foot rests, heated and cooled rear seats, an aircraft-style overhead console with a lighted vanity mirror, climate controls and reading lights. There was even wood trim on the parcel shelf and a suede headliner.\n\nHE: It’s true that the 760Li has a magnificent engine and suspension, but it’s also true that it’s almost more fun to be a passenger than the driver. Let’s put aside your chauffeur-driven fantasies for a second and talk about the driving experience. The twin-cam 6.0-liter V-12 is truly superb. It makes 408 horsepower and 442 pounds-feet of torque, which I suppose you could argue is overkill here in North America. But it sure feels sweet beneath your feet. It’s mated to a six-speed Tiptronic-style transmission which lets you shift manually without a clutch. Here’s where we get into the first major problem. BMW has mounted the tiny gearshift lever on the steering column and programmed it in such a way that it requires a surprisingly complicated set of motions to do something as simple as shifting into reverse to back out of a parking space, then shifting into forward gear to get under way.\n\nSHE: You haven’t even mentioned the dreaded iDrive, which we have sampled on several versions of the 7-series and still find virtually incomprehensible. Picture a big fist-size knob that doubles as a joystick and controls such functions as climate, audio and navigation. It should be intuitive, but it isn’t. BMW just tried to cram too many functions into this unit. And the worst part is you have to take your eyes off the road to play with it. We now have put several hun dred miles on two different 7-series, and we still can’t get used to the iDrive.\n\nHE: On the other hand, I’m seriously impressed with the sophisticated suspension system, which features electronic damping control and active roll stabilization. What that means is that no matter how rough the road, the 760Li does a spectacular job of smoothing out the bumps and potholes. It’s almost impossible to ruffle its poise. The active safety systems are also state of the art, including dynamic stability and traction control, and dynamic brake control. Don’t get the wrong impression. This BMW won’t drive itself, but it will make almost anyone a better, safer driver.\n\nSHE: And if you get into real trouble, there are all those air bags and air curtains to protect your head, your thorax, even your knees in a collision. BMW has done a good job of using technology in other ways to make things easier and safer. The 760Li comes with such features as rain-sensing wipers and park distance control, and you can order active cruise control to help maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead of you.\n\nHE: BMW certainly crammed a lot of electronics into the 7-series, some for the good and some not so good. The drive-by-wire system, for instance, eliminates the traditional mechanical linkages between the gas pedal and the engine, but there is a noticeable and disturbing throttle lag when you first touch the accelerator. Even everyday functions like the radio require additional training. For heaven’s sake, our test vehicle came with a 46-page minimanual plus three regular owner’s manuals!\n\nSHE: Ooh, not good. I haven’t even read the manual that came with my George Foreman grill.\n\n2003 BMW 760Li\n\nType: Front-engine, rear-wheel drive, five-passenger luxury sedan.\n\nPrice (Includes $695 destination charge): Base, $115,800; as tested, $122,095 (inc. $1,300 gas guzzler tax)\n\nEngine: 6.0-liter V-12; 408-hp; 442 lb-ft torque\n\nEPA fuel economy: 15 mpg city/23 mpg highway\n\nKey competitors: Mercedes-Benz S600\n\n12-month insurance cost (Estimated by AAA Michigan. Rates may vary depending on coverage and driving record): $3,362\n\nWhere built: Germany\n\nAnita’s rating: Above Average\n\nLikes: Lovely ambient lighting in doors. Heated/cooled massaging seats. Amazing limo-style rear compartment. Gorgeous suede headliner. Precious little cooler in rear. Power trunk closer.\n\nDislikes: Front doors are too heavy. Nothing is familiar about the driving experience. Length makes it difficult to park.\n\nPaul’s rating: Acceptable\n\nLikes: Sensational 12-cylinder engine. Supple, compliant suspension. Extremely comfortable cabin. World-class safety features.\n\nDislikes: Disconcerting initial throttle lag. Gearshift lever difficult to use, especially for simple maneuvers. iDrive forces you to take your eyes off the road. $1,300 gas-guzzler tax. Extremely complex and difficult to operate, requiring 46-page minimanual plus three regular owner’s manuals. Hideously ugly rear end.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle OverviewBMW’s flagship 7 Series sedan comes in two wheelbases: regular and extended, starting with the more affordable trim levels, the 750i and 750Li, respectively. A limited-production V-12-powered version, the 760Li comes only in the longer size, and a high-performance model adapted by German tuner Alpina, called simply the Alpina B7, is based on the shorter wheelbase. (It’s detailed in a separate report in the Cars.com Research section.)\nThe 7 Series has featured some incremental changes over the years since the birth of this fourth generation in 2002 — including an engine-size increase that changed the base model from 745 to 750. However, BMW says absolutely nothing in the 7 Series has changed between 2007 and 2008. Apart from the trim levels above, BMW Individual customization is available, comprising  special leather and interior trim, an Alcantara suede headliner, 20-inch wheels and illuminated doorsills.\nThe 750i competes with top-line sedans like the Audi A8, Jaguar XJ and Mercedes-Benz S-Class. The affordable Lexus LS 460 is a key alternative in regular and extended body lengths. The 760Li’s main competitor is the V-12-powered Mercedes S600. For the true performance version of the 7, check out the Alpina B7.\nExteriorBMW’s regular-length 750i sedan is built on a 117.7-inch wheelbase, versus a 123.2-inch version on the extended-length 750Li sedan. The longer model is identical but for chrome roof molding, where the 750i is body-colored. All models have chrome trim on the bumpers.\nOne of the early and perhaps most controversial models designed by American Chris Bangle, the 7 Series has had key styling changes that have damped criticism somewhat. Namely, the taillamps now run directly onto a reshaped trunklid, making it look less like it was added after the fact, and the headlight clusters were restyled for a more aggressive look, closer to that of the 5 Series sedan.  \nInteriorUp to five occupants can fit easily inside the 750i, though a relatively high center floor hump crowds the center passenger’s feet. The backseat of the 750Li and 760Li has more legroom.\nDetail trim elements have a metallic look. A flat-tire warning and a 10-speaker audio system are standard. The Adaptive Ride Package includes Electronic Damping Control and a self-leveling rear air suspension. Heated front Comfort seats and power-folding exterior mirrors are standard for the whole model line.\nAlso controversial is the standard iDrive interface, a combination knob/joystick/button that — along with an LCD screen — controls many functions, including the stereo, navigation and some aspects of ventilation.\nUnder the HoodThe 750’s 4.8-liter V-8 drives the rear wheels with 360 horsepower at 6,300 rpm and 360 pounds-feet of torque at 3,400 rpm. The 760Li’s V-12 engine generates 438 hp and 444 pounds-feet of torque. The torque seems modest considering that the Alpina B7’s modified V-8 delivers 516 pounds-feet along with its 500 hp. Generous torque is common in engines with more cylinders.\nThe six-speed Steptronic automatic transmission has its selector positioned just ahead of the steering-wheel rim. A steering-wheel button selects Drive, Sport or Manual shift mode. Shift buttons at the front and back of the steering wheel can be used to execute manual gear changes.  \nSafetyBMW’s first- and second-row inflatable tubular Head Protection System is similar to side curtain airbags. Front-seat side-impact airbags are also standard, and rear side-impact airbags are optional. Active Knee Protection is standard. Active Cruise Control that uses a radar sensor is optional.\nDriving ImpressionsIn the class of large, heavy luxury flagships, the 750 feels nimble, benefiting from its perfect 50/50 (front/rear) weight distribution. The V-8 engine is eager and more than powerful enough for most buyers. The 760Li’s value is in its exclusivity more than its additional performance. The 7 Series’ ride quality is good, thanks in part to active stabilizer bars that make their presence known only when the car is turning, preventing body lean. Overall, the technology that BMW uses in the service of performance, under the hood and chassis, is top-notch, where competitors’ often add too much weight or feel gimmicky.\nOn the flip side, BMW’s slavish devotion to its iDrive system only harms its vehicles’ appeal. Attempts to simplify it have made it better, but it’s far from good. Critics say it’s difficult to figure out, when the true problem is more insidious: Once you do figure it out, it’s unpleasant to use, and that never changes. Somewhat related, BMW’s change in the 7 Series from mechanical gear selectors and turn-signal stalks to lever-activated electronics are “improvements” that some drivers find detrimental. Otherwise, the 7 Series’ interior is well-appointed and comfy. Check out options like massaging seats with more adjustments than you’ve ever seen, and night vision that appears on the dashboard display.\nWe have yet to experience the Alpina B7.",

      "expert_review": "Can one really find happiness with a $111,500 BMW sedan? My gut tells me no … but then, I can’t speak for everybody.\n\nOne glance at the tested model – a 760i, the second-most expensive of four trim levels of BMW’s 2006 7 Series – certainly offered the prospect of many happy motoring days ahead. Everything on the car looks bigger than life.\n\nThe monster-size, 20-inch performance tires look like rock crushers, with the rubber wrapped around alloy wheels that seem to contain 20 spokes each.\n\nThose big tires make the 760i seem like it has the dimensions of a mini-limo, yet it actually falls just short of 200 inches in length. The engine driving all this is a 6-liter, quad-cam V-12 with 48 valves. Those big numbers generate even more big numbers: 438 horsepower and 444 foot-pounds of torque stepping up at just under 4,000 revolutions per minute.\n\nEven with nearly 4,800 pounds of weight to propel, the V-12 does a fine job in all driving conditions. Steering is light and nimble.\n\nIt should be noted that accelerations from a standing start are not of the drag strip variety. They’re more like brisk runs up through the sophisticated six-speed automatic gearbox. Once you get on the far side of 3,000 rpm, however, you need to start backing off, lest you end up on the far side of 80 miles per hour … making yourself a California Highway Patrol magnet.\n\nOh, yes, the tester was subject to a $1,700 gas guzzler tax, with anemic fuel ratings of 15 miles per gallon in city driving and 22 mpg on the highway. The manufacturer’s recommendation is for premium unleaded fuel, and given the current price of that primo-octane gasoline, the estimated annual fuel cost of $2,117 on the tested 760i’s sticker was laughable.\n\nThat estimate equates to about $41 a week. Filling up a nearly dry 760i gas tank of 23.3 gallons with premium gas is going to be a $75-or-more proposition in Northern California. You do the math from there.\n\nThis is not my idea of happiness, but then again, I’m guessing that folks who drop more than $110,000 on a BMW aren’t necessarily worried about where they’re going to come up with the funds for their next fill-up.\n\nStepping inside the BMW offered perspective on what constitutes a true luxury sport sedan. You might recall that last week’s review of the 2006 Infiniti G35 Sedan also involved a car billed as a luxury sport sedan. Yet, the G35 had a starting price of only $31,300.\n\nWhat do you get for an extra $80,200 in the ’06 BMW 760i? A lot.\n\nLike the Infiniti G35, the 760i has a full range of vehicle-control systems and state-of-the-art safety devices. But the interior comfort/convenience amenities inside the 760i are far more numerous and opulent than what’s found in the Infiniti product.\n\nThink the difference between a Four Seasons hotel and a Motel 6.\n\nThe BMW’s automatic climate-control system includes a micro-filter and a solar-powered, automatic air-recirculation system that cools the car’s interior when it’s sitting all by its lonesome in the hot sun.\n\nThere’s a proximity sensor in the key fob that automatically unlocks the doors when your hand touches any of the door handles. Yes, the car will start at the push of a button when the key fob is in your pocket.\n\nThe climate-control system also manages temperatures in the front console storage area. Cellular phone controls join audio system controls on the leather-wrapped steering wheel.\n\nThat audio system is a kicking Logic 7 with 13 speakers and digital sound processing. The compact disc player can swallow up to six CDs at a time.\n\nBMW’s iDrive, with the signature big knob on the center console controlling so many in-car systems, is still a 7 Series staple. Criticized by some as too complicated and cumbersome, I must confess that I have become used to it. And if my technology-fearing fingers can adapt, the rest of the motoring universe should have no problem.\n\nThere also are memory settings for the power seats, exterior mirrors and the telescoping/tilt steering wheel. Sensors detect and sound audible warnings about too-close objects when parking or on the move.\n\nThose comprise just the short list of passenger-spoiling features. Add to all this the fact that three back seat passengers have plenty of room to stretch out in their kingdom of leather-wrapped seats.\n\nOK, maybe happiness is attainable in a big BMW sedan, but it’s definitely a niche designed for those who aren’t fiscally challenged.\n\nBMW 7 SERIES AT A GLANCE\nMake/model: 2006 BMW 760i\nVehicle type: Five-passenger, four-door, rear-drive, luxury sport sedan\nBase price: $111,500 (as tested, $116,990)\nEngine: 6-liter V-12 with 438 horsepower at 6,000 revolutions per minute and 444 foot-pounds of torque at 3,950 rpm\nEPA fuel economy: 15 miles per gallon city; 22 mpg highway\nTransmission: Six-speed automatic with special features\nSteering: Power-assisted rack and pinion with speed-sensitive feature\nBrakes: Power-assisted, four-wheel, vented discs with anti-lock and other braking-enhancement features\nSuspension: Independent, strut-type on front; multi-link on rear (anti-roll bars and coil springs front and rear)\nFuel tank: 23.3 gallons\nInterior volume: 104 cubic feet\nTrunk volume: 18 cubic feet\nCurb weight: 4,762 pounds\nTrack: 62.1 inches on front; 62.8 inches on rear\nHeight: 58.7 inches\nLength: 198.4 inches\nWheelbase: 117.7 inches\nWidth: 74.9 inches\nTires: P245/40R20 performance radials on front; P275/35R20 on rear\nFinal assembly point: Dingolfing, Germany",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nFollowing the debut of BMW’s redesigned V-8-powered flagship 745i sedan in 2002, a rear-wheel-drive 760Li companion with a V-12 engine arrived during the 2003 model year. Loaded with technical advances, the 6.0-liter V-12 develops 438 horsepower.\n\nBoth the long-wheelbase 760Li and a standard-length 760i sedan are available for 2005. Standard adaptive headlights move with the front wheels to enhance night vision through curves. A Rear Entertainment System with a six-DVD changer and an iDrive controller and a Comfort Access system with keyless entry, exit and operation, are new options.\n\nThe six-speed adaptive automatic transmission uses shift-by-wire technology and is controlled with a selector behind the steering wheel. Manual gear changes can be made.\n\nBMW’s iDrive system places access to the most-used controls via a rotary dial between the front seats. An electronic parking brake is used, and available Active Cruise Control can maintain a set distance from the vehicle ahead. “We actually don’t want to sell a car to a person who has no interest in technology,” said Tom Purves, chairman and chief executive officer of BMW North America.\n\nExterior\nThe 760’s styling is virtually identical to that of the 745, which has been praised by some for its freshness yet faulted by others � especially for the rear-end’s shape. Design elements follow BMW tradition and include the familiar twin-kidney grille, four headlights and a reverse kink in the C-pillar. Noticeable styling touches on the 760Li include extra-wide rear doors, chrome-plated roof strips and chrome inserts in the bumpers.\n\nBi-xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights operate with both high and low beams. An “eyebrow” turn signal appears above each headlight cluster, and a high-pressure headlight cleaning system is installed.\n\nBuilt on a 123.2-inch wheelbase, the 760Li stretches to 203.5 inches long overall, versus 117.7 and 198 inches for the 760i sedan. An aluminum suspension with Active Roll Stabilization is intended to reduce body roll. The self-leveling rear suspension uses air springs.\n\nInterior\nLike the V-8-powered 745, the 760 seats up to five occupants. Because the 760Li has a longer wheelbase, backseat occupants enjoy an additional 5.5 inches of legroom for limousinelike accommodations. Its wider door openings ease entry and exit. The door openings are infinitely variable rather than fitted with specific stops.\n\nThe 760Li can be equipped with optional, separate automatic air conditioning and a cooling box for beverages. An electronically controlled sunblind for the rear window and a Logic7 stereo system are standard. Sirius Satellite Radio is optional.\n\nUnder the Hood\nBMW’s 6.0-liter aluminum V-12 produces 438 hp and teams with an adaptive six-speed-automatic transmission that includes a manual-shift provision.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes, side-impact airbags for the front seats and BMW’s Head Protection System are standard. Knee airbags for front occupants are also installed. Rear-seat side-impact airbags are offered as an option. BMW’s automatic parking brake feature prevents rolling in stop-and-go traffic.",
