      "expert_review": "Controversial redesign adds up for BMW 530i\n\nWhat’s 7 plus 4, plus 5, plus 6, plus 3? The answer: 1.\n\nThat is, one redesigned fleet of BMW passenger cars, beginning with the 7 Series, then the Z4, then the 5 Series, the imminent 6 Series, and, likely sometime next year, the 3 Series.\n\nBMW is literally putting an edge on the appearance of its automotive lineup. Beginning with the controversial design of the 7 Series, onto the Z4, and now the 5 Series, BMWs feature sharp-edged lines that run fore to aft, headlight to tail- light. Along the way, those lines highlight areas of convex and concave body parts, metallic arcs, and high chopped rear ends, which have drawn the most ire from critics of the redesign. And on this point I’d agree. The backside works on the two-seater Z4, but it seems a humped and abrupt ending to the longer lines of the sedans.\n\nMost recent of the redesigns is in the mid-lineup 5 Series.\n\nThe 530i, sport package equipped model just tested, was imposing in its sharp stance. Its headlights — wide slits below, the narrower slits of blinkers sitting atop like eyelids — looked absolutely reptilian.\n\nIts high-riding body, aluminum in the front, steel from the front pillar back, made the glass look small, like the outside view of the cockpit windows of a big airliner.\n\nYou know a lot is going on in there, but you can’t see much of it.\n\nThe outside lines, as in the Z4 and 7 Series, are recreated in the interior, where pockets and bumps define arm rest areas, gauges on the dash, the upper lines of door panels. Even the gauges, mid-dash and behind the wheel, are sheltered by protruding eyebrows.\n\nThe leather package is, of course, firm and superbly bolstered. There’ll be no sliding around in these seats at speed. Even the outer rear seat passengers sink into butt-grabbing pockets of comfort and protection.\n\nFor those who criticized the 7 Series for its iDrive system — basically a computer “mouse” in the form of a diabolical dial between the front seats — and its hundreds of functions, good news.\n\nThe new 5 has iDrive but the seemingly endless number of compass points leading to functions to menus to submenus to minutia has been simplified to just four areas of entry. Still complicated, but a bit better.\n\nBMW has performed one remarkable bit of wizardry with the 530i. It made the car nearly 1 1/2 inches taller, almost two inches wider, and 2.6 inches longer. It sits on a 1.8-inch wider front track, a 2.2-inch wider rear track, and a wheelbase that is about 2.5 inches longer.\n\nThe result is excellent leg room in the rear and, because of “scoops” in the ceiling above outer rear passengers’ heads, there’s plenty of noggin niche. And all this was accomplished while dropping 50 or so pounds from the previous model’s curb weight.\n\nThe 530i comes with three engine options: a 2.5-liter, inline 6 that produces 184 horsepower; a 3.0-liter I-6 that delivers 225 horsepower (as tested); and a 4.4-liter V-8 with 325 horsepower.\n\nTransmission options include a 6-speed manual (again, as tested), a 6-speed manual with automatic shifting and clutch, and a 6-speed automatic.\n\nThe 225-horsepower engine makes this a fine driver’s car — elegant, sure, powerful. It does not leap from the line (I can imagine what the 325-horsepower unit would do), but it rises steadily to cruising speed and, once there, becomes an effortless devourer of open high-way. The 6-speed manual was precise if a bit heavy, but I suspect that’s because it’s designed to handle a wide range of torque: 175 lb.-ft. in the smaller engine, 214 lb.-ft. in the test model, and a whopping 330 lb.-ft. in the V-8.\n\nThe aluminum suspension is a strut/lower-link setup in the front, while the rear is a four-link system. Aluminum, in fact, plays a significant role in this car’s weight los even in the face of greater size. Besides the suspension, the engine blocks and heads are aluminum, and the aluminum nose further cuts weight, with that lightweight alloy atop the engine helping to give the car an almost perfect 50-50 weight distribution. I was most impressed with the electronically variable, speed-sensitive steering on this new model. Drive it slowly and it takes just over 1 1/2 cranks to turn the wheels from full right turnout to full left turnout (lock-to-lock).\n\nUsing a gear/speed-sensitive system that determines how far you have to turn the wheel given how fast you’re driving, steering is odd, at first, but wonderful to sense once you become used to it. By the time you have hit 75 miles per hour, the lock-to-lock turn is a super-sensitive five rotations of the wheel.\n\nThe redesigns of the BMW passenger cars continue amid criticism of the iDrive, but as 7 yields to 4 yields to 5, I sense a growing acceptance of what is taking place. An engineering marvel is just getting a sharper skin.\n\nNow bring on that M5 with the V-10 engine, 40 valves, and 500 or more horsepower.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 BMW 5 Series?\n\nThe 2020 BMW 5 Series is a five-seat mid-size luxury sedan that competes with the Mercedes-Benz E-Class and Audi A6, among others. It offers a choice of turbocharged gas engines as well as plug-in hybrid, M Performance and M5 versions. Rear- and all-wheel-drive models are offered.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 BMW 5 Series?\n\nKeyless entry is now standard. The performance-oriented M550i’s twin-turbocharged V-8 engine is now rated at 523 horsepower and 553 pounds-feet of torque; that’s an increase of 67 hp and 73 pounds-feet of torque from last year, and the sedan’s 0-60-mph time has dropped 0.3 second to just 3.6 seconds. Meanwhile, the 530e gets a larger high-voltage battery pack that increases the car’s all-electric range from 16 to 20 miles for rear-drive versions and from 14 to 18 miles for all-wheel-drive models.\n\nNewly standard features for the M5 include a digital instrument panel and wireless device charging. The M5 lineup also includes the Edition 35 Years, which celebrates 35 years of the M5 sports sedan. Just 35 have been allotted for the U.S.\n\nWhat Features in the 2020 BMW 5 Series Are Most Important?\n\nStandard active safety features include blind spot warning, lane departure warning, forward collision warning, pedestrian detection, city collision mitigation and rear cross-traffic alert. Standard luxury features include wood trim, automatic air conditioning and navigation. Available features include an active suspension, power trunk lid, aluminum cabin trim, Nappa leather upholstery, massaging front seats, a heated steering wheel, a head-up display, wireless device charging, a gesture-based interface, a Harman Kardon or Bowers & Wilkins surround-sound system, a night vision system, adaptive cruise control and a 360-degree camera system.\n\nShould I Buy the 2020 BMW 5 Series?\n\nWhether you’re looking for an efficient luxury car or a high-powered sports sedan, there’s probably a version of the 5 Series that’ll fit your needs. Its high-quality interior impresses and the car can be loaded up with tech features, but some shoppers might find the backseat not roomy enough.",

      "expert_review": "Competes with: Mercedes-Benz E-Class, Audi A6, Genesis G80, Jaguar XF\n\nLooks like: A 5 Series with a bigger mouth and a bit of a nip/tuck\n\nPowertrain: A 248-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder (530); 335-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter inline six-cylinder (540); 181-hp, 2.0-liter four-cylinder and 107-hp electric motor (530e); 523-hp, twin-turbocharged 4.4-liter V-8 (M550); choice of eight-speed automatic transmissions; rear- or all-wheel drive\n\nHits dealerships: Ordering opens in May; deliveries to begin in July\n\nBMW’s current-generation 5 Series sedan debuted as a 2017 model, and for the 2021 model year it’s getting a refresh with some new exterior looks, updated interior technology and a 48-volt mild-hybrid system for the six-cylinder 540 models.\n\nRelated: 2020 BMW X6 Review: Ignore the Why, Enjoy the How\n\nThe new looks and new tech won’t cost buyers much in most instances, however, with unchanged prices or modest price increases across most of the lineup. Including a $995 destination fee, the rear-wheel-drive 2021 530i will cost $55,195, $300 more than its predecessor. The 530e jumps up to $58,195, a $3,300 increase, while the 540i’s price is unchanged at $60,445. The M550i xDrive is $150 more expensive for 2021 at $77,795. For all models except the M550i xDrive, adding BMW’s xDrive all-wheel-drive system will cost an extra $2,300.\n\nExterior\n\nThe most noticeable change to the 5 Series is its taller and wider signature kidney grille, and while it’s certainly bigger, it’s more proportionate looking than on the 7 Series sedan or X7 SUV and not nearly as oversized as on some BMW concept vehicles of late. Other changes include new LED headlights and taillights, and new trapezoidal exhaust finishers. BMW also lengthened the 2021’s body by 1.2 inches, but most other exterior measurements remain the same.\n\nModels with the optional M Sport Package get new front and rear bumpers and the M550 features an aerodynamic kit that includes a trunk lid spoiler. The M550 also gets gray mirror caps, grille, air intake inserts and lettering.\n\nInterior\n\nThe most significant enhancement inside the 2021 5 Series is the newly standard 12.3-inch infotainment display, up from 10.25 inches in previous models. BMW’s Live Cockpit Professional 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster is also standard. Navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are all standard.\n\nA new perforated leatherette upholstery is standard on all but the M550, which comes with upgraded Dakota leather upholstery that’s optional on all the other models. All models can be appointed with optional Nappa leather.\n\nEngine and Transmission\n\nAt the lower end of the lineup, 530 models get BMW’s turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine making 248 horsepower and 258 pounds-feet of torque. The most powerful engine, meanwhile, is the M550’s twin-turbocharged 4.4-liter V-8, which produces 523 hp and 553 pounds-feet of torque.\n\nThe most interesting changes, however, happen in the middle of the lineup. The 530e plug-in hybrid features a new 181-hp four-cylinder gas engine and a 107-hp electric motor that produce a combined system output of 288 hp and 310 pounds-feet of torque, an increase of 40 hp over the previous 530e. The system also features Xtra Boost, which can be engaged in Sport mode and provides an extra 40 hp for 10 seconds when the driver really steps on the gas.\n\nThe mid-level gas engine in the 540, a 3.0-liter inline six-cylinder producing 335 hp and 332 pounds-feet of torque, now has a 48-volt mild-hybrid system that is used to help power electrical components, improve engine stop-start smoothness, increase efficiency and produce a burst of 11 additional hp under hard acceleration.\n\nMost 2021 5 Series models get a choice of either a regular eight-speed automatic transmission or a sport-tuned eight speed automatic, with the latter standard equipment on the M550.\n\nSafety\n\nSome advanced safety features, including forward collision warning with pedestrian and cyclist detection and automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning with steering correction, blind spot monitor, rear cross-traffic alert and automatic high beams, are standard on the 2021 5 Series.\n\nOptional safety features include adaptive cruise control with BMW’s Extended Traffic Jam Assist and lane-keeping assist with side collision avoidance.\n\nAlso optional is a Parking Assistance Package that includes panorama and 3D surround-view camera angles as well as the ability to identify and automatically park in parallel and perpendicular parking spaces. It also includes BMW’s Back-Up Assistant, which can “remember” the last 50 yards driven at speeds under 20 mph and automatically reverse the car along that same path — useful for narrow, winding driveways.\n\nThe 2021 BMW 5 Series is available for ordering in May, with the first deliveries expected to follow in July.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nBMW adds new base versions to its 5 Series lineup, introduces two new six-cylinder engines and freshens the appearance of all models.\n\nThe 5 Series returns in sedan and station wagon body styles, and with the new engines, model nomenclature changes. Base models are now called 525i. What was the 528i sedan last year is now the 530i. The 540i sedan returns with the same 4.4-liter V-8 engine.\n\nWith a base price of $35,970, including the destination charge, the 525i sedan is $3,500 less than last years cheapest 5 Series model. Also returning from last year is the high-performance M5 sedan.\n\nExterior\nStyling changes include a reshaped twin-kidney grille, body-color side moldings, and new headlights, turn signals and front fascia. The taillights get new LED lights. At 188 inches overall, the 5 Series sedan is about an inch shorter than the Mercedes-Benz E-Class and nearly 9 inches shorter than the Lexus LS 430. The 111.4-inch wheelbase, however, places the 5 Series among the full-size cars.\n\nInterior\nAll models come with front bucket seats with 10-way power adjustments for the drivers side, remote keyless entry, a 10-speaker audio system and a power tilt/telescopic steering column. Leather upholstery is standard on the 540i and optional on the 525i and 530i. A split, folding rear seatback is optional on all models.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe 525i uses a new 184-horsepower 2.5-liter inline-six-cylinder engine, and the 530i has a new 225-hp 3.0-liter inline-six. The 540is 4.4-liter V-8 generates 282 hp. The inline-six-cylinder models are available with a five-speed manual or five-speed automatic transmission, and the 540i comes with a six-speed manual or five-speed automatic.\n\nIn a switch from usual pricing practices, the 540i costs more with the manual than the automatic transmission: $54,470 versus $51,670. All-wheel drive is optional on the smaller 3 Series sedan and wagon, but the 5 Series remains rear-drive only.\n\nSafety\nAll models have two-stage front airbags whose deployment force depends on crash severity and whether the occupants are buckled up. In addition, side-impact airbags for the front seats and the Head Protection System, which consists of a curtain-type airbag that deploys to protect front-seat occupants, also are available. Rear side-impact airbags are optional, and this year they include head-protection curtains for the rear seats.\n\nTraction control, a lateral-skid control system called Dynamic Stability Control and antilock brakes are standard across the board.\n\n \n\nReported by Rick Popely  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2001 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "It’s sad when something isn’t as good as you remember it to be. Like a familiar restaurant that no longer makes your favorite dish or a favorite musician who can’t quite hit all their notes in concert anymore.\n\nThat’s how I feel after spending a week with not one but two BMW 5 Series sedans, the 2017 BMW 540i and 530i xDrive. Make no mistake: These are fine automobiles, nicer inside than they’ve ever been and chock-full of amazing technology (some useful, some silly). They’re powerful, efficient, quick and smooth. But they’ve most assuredly lost the mojo that used to make BMWs sing in the hands of enthusiast drivers. In a quest to chase sales, BMW has made its products increasingly appealing to a broader audience — and sales have responded. But while the brand’s advertising is still chasing enthusiasts, some of the products themselves no longer reflect their tagline: “Ultimate Driving Machine.”\n\nGood Looks Remain\n\nThe new 5 Series has received a freshening, but it’s starting to suffer from an affliction affecting most of BMW’s lineup: a lack of fresh ideas. Lately, one generation of BMW products blends into previous generations. Is this a 2017? A 2015? A 2012? Can you really tell anymore? At least it’s still attractive, with sleek LED headlights, thick haunches and aerodynamic styling, and there are still vestiges of characteristic BMW styling elements, like the twin-kidney grille and unique C-pillar design. But it looks more “now” than “new.”\n\nBMW’s Nicest Interior Yet\n\nInside is where the upgrades are most noticeable. BMW has been rightfully stung lately by the astonishing luxury and quality of Mercedes-Benz interiors, even in its entry-level models, and has responded with aplomb. The 2017 5 Series’ cockpit is considerably better than the outgoing model’s, but its top trim level still falls just a hair short of the opulence of even a base Mercedes-Benz E-Class. It’s close enough these days that choosing one over the other comes down to a preference in style — do you like the unusual shower-drain speaker grilles on the Mercedes? Or do you prefer the cleaner lines of the BMW? It’s a win either way.\n\nSpace is not an issue, either, with plenty of room front and back. The front seats are very comfortable and highly adjustable, with available heating and ventilation. The backseat features acceptable legroom, with plenty of room for two people. Three will still find their legs cramped by the driveshaft tunnel in this rear-wheel-drive car, but the 5 Series’ width makes three abreast more pleasant than it’s been in recent years.\n\nOutward visibility is also good, with a reasonably low beltline that adds airy spaciousness to the cabin. Contrast this with the Mercedes-Benz E-Class, which has a high beltline that makes you feel like you’re sitting in a cocooning tub, and the BMW feels a little bigger inside.\n\nGadgets Galore\n\nBMW has focused on some pretty impressive technology, some of which is genuinely useful, some of which comes across as gimmicky and silly. The 530i features standard navigation and a 10.2-inch display screen with the latest iDrive multimedia control system. It’s come a long way from the initially difficult-to-use, multiple-menu system, and while it still buries some functions (like safety equipment activation) in these menus, it’s a lot easier to use than in previous years. Apple CarPlay is available, but it’s a $300 option.\n\nBMW offers a few new high-tech options, some astonishing, some not so helpful. On the genuinely useful side is the remote control parking function, which lets you stand outside the car and pull it into or out of a super-tight space that wouldn’t allow you to open the doors if you drove it in. On the less useful side is the rather silly gesture control for the multimedia system. Read more about these functions here.\n\nBut the Thrill Is Gone\n\nIf you’ve never driven a BMW before, you’ll fire up the 5 Series, take it for a spin and declare it to be an excellent luxury car. And let’s be clear about this: It is. It’s refined, it’s smooth, it’s quiet, it’s extremely well-insulated from the noise and harshness of the outside environment. It’s everything American buyers seek from a luxury brand like Lexus or Mercedes-Benz, and it’s one of the reasons BMW has been able to keep up with those two brands in sales for the past several years.\n\nThe complaints you’ll hear with the latest BMWs come from people who have been driving BMWs for 20 or 30 years: that they used to be enthusiast machines — vehicles made for people who love tight-handling, high-performing, European-flavored sports sedans and coupes. BMW’s advertising tagline, the “Ultimate Driving Machine,” has been around more than 40 years, and it once accurately described the brand’s cars. Not anymore.\n\nIt’s not a matter of powertrains. The base engine in the 530i is a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder making 248 horsepower and tied to a standard eight-speed automatic transmission. Step up to the 540i and you’ll get a 335-hp, twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder engine. Or you can go big and splurge for the M550i, which comes with a 456-hp, twin-turbo 4.4-liter V-8.\n    \nMy testing was limited to the first two models, the 530i xDrive (with all-wheel drive) and the 540i in rear-wheel-drive form. The four- and six-cylinder engines are wonderful, with plenty of usable torque to drive the car quickly off the line. Put them in Sport mode and things get even quicker, with throttle response changes that make both cars much more responsive to pedal inputs. The eight-speed transmission is well-matched to either engine, snapping off quick shifts with smooth precision and very little hunting for the appropriate gear regardless of your driving style.\n\nBoth cars also ride extremely well, with excellent body control and well-damped motions that effectively isolate the driver without feeling too floaty. But here’s where we start to see how far BMW has skewed from enthusiast drivers and into luxury territory. While the suspension is comfortable, it also does away with any communication to the driver about what the car is doing. The electric power steering is numb in a way that would have been unimaginable in a BMW 10 years ago. It transmits no feedback to the driver, and bumping the mode selector into Sport only increases the effort required, doing nothing about feel.\n\nThis numb handling and cushy ride effectively turn the 5 Series into any number of ordinary luxury cars, giving up its sportiness in the process. And while that may be great for the vast majority of buyers who prefer that kind of suppleness in their luxury car, enthusiast buyers now need to head over to Cadillac showrooms instead, where elements that used to make up BMW’s Ultimate Driving Machines are now firmly entrenched in European-style American sedans.\n\nFuel economy is above average for the field. The base 530i comes in at an EPA-estimated 24/34/27 mpg city/highway/combined, dropping to 23/33/27 mpg for the AWD xDrive model. The 540i does a little worse, at 20/30/24 mpg with rear-wheel drive and 20/29/23 with all-wheel drive. My testing turned in 26 mpg combined in the 530i xDrive and 22 mpg in the 540i, but both were driven primarily in the city and rather aggressively to boot.\n\nA Mercedes-Benz E300 sedan with its own turbo 2.0-liter engine returns an estimated 22/30/25 mpg — surprising given it has an extra gear — while the Cadillac CTS 2.0-liter gets the exact same results. The Audi A6 bests both with 24/34/28 mpg from its front-wheel-drive, 2.0-liter model. Compare them all here.\n\nCargo Room\n\nThe BMW 530i xDrive has an above-average trunk volume specification of 18.7 cubic feet — sufficiently above average to make us suspect their measurement method. Mercedes-Benz claims 13.1 cubic feet for the E300, and Cadillac cites the CTS at 13.7. The Audi A6, a front-wheel-drive car with different packaging, claims 14.1 cubic feet of room. Given cargo measurements are equal parts scientific method and voodoo, it’s best to compare competitors for yourself.\n\nSafety in Spades, but It Will Cost You\n\nThe 5 Series earned top marks from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety in all crashworthiness and crash-avoidance testing. The car has not been tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nOne area where BMW has not skimped is optional safety equipment, but the functional word here is “optional.” In true German luxury car fashion, nearly all of the car’s more advanced safety features are optional. You get standard airbags and required antilock brakes and stability control, but everything else costs money — a lot of it. A backup camera, rear parking sensors and a head-up display are bundled into the Driving Assistance Package, which costs $1,800. Automatic parallel parking and 360-degree surround view cameras come in the Driving Assistance Plus Package for $1,400. If you want autonomous emergency braking, pedestrian detection, traffic jam assist and lane departure warning, there’s a Driving Assistance Plus II package for $1,700. That’s a lot of money considering some of these electronic safety features are pretty basic.\n\nIt Gets Really Expensive, Fast\n\nThe basic BMW 530i starts at $52,195 including destination fee, or $54,495 for the xDrive model. The bigger-engined 540i starts at $57,445. Prices climb quickly from there, however. My mostly loaded 530i xDrive included items like a cold weather package, two driving assistance packages, a lighting package, a luxury seating package and a premium package, plus stand-alone items like a power-close trunk, soft-close doors, ceramic controls and a premium Harman Kardon sound system; it rang in at $72,735. My 540i tester was even more expensive, adding things like a dynamic handling package, the M Sport package and a fancier Bowers & Wilkins audio system; it rang in at an eye-watering $82,610.\n\nCompeting vehicles are priced comparably. The latest Mercedes-Benz E-Class has a similar pricing scheme, starting at $53,075 for a four-cylinder E300 and quickly going north from there, with safety and electronic minder features all bundled in packages for quite a lot of money. Audi’s A6 isn’t quite so dear, starting at $48,550 and featuring front-wheel drive instead of the segment’s more common rear-wheel drive. The Cadillac CTS is the better-handling alternative, and it’s more economical, too, starting at $46,990 for the most-powerful four-cylinder turbo engine in the group.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nA new fifth generation of BMWs midsize 5 Series sedan arrives for the 2004 model year. It is a bit bigger in size and exhibits a fresh but familiar new look. Mounted on a wheelbase thats 2.3 inches longer than its predecessor, the rear-wheel-drive 530i is 2.6 inches longer overall, 1.8 inches wider and 1.3 inches taller. Space in the rear has been increased, and the automakers says entry into the backseat is easier. Trunk capacity has grown by 26 percent. A new, weight-saving, all-aluminum front-end structure is used.\n\nThree 5 Series models are available. The 525i is equipped with a 2.5-liter inline-six-cylinder engine; the 530i gets a 225-horsepower, 3.0-liter six-cylinder; and the 545i is powered by a 4.4-liter V-8. The inline-six-cylinder engines were used in the prior generation, but the V-8 is larger than before. Three six-speed transmission choices are offered: manual, Steptronic automatic and a Sequential Manual Gearbox (SMG). BMW says the new six-speed-manual gearbox works with a sportier shift action by using shorter throws for a more satisfying feel.\n\nBMW offers quite an array of either standard or optional equipment, which includes Active Roll Stabilization, Xenon Adaptive Headlights, Adaptive brake lights, run-flat tires, an evolved iDrive control system, a head-up display, Active Cruise Control and Active Steering.\n\nExterior\nThe styling of the 530i and its companions follows on the heels of the companys controversial 7 Series but appears to be more subtle  and, therefore, perhaps less subject to criticism. Short overhangs and what BMW calls lean-forward dynamics highlight the design. Though the basic concept is considered to be traditional, BMW says the design language is all new and consistent with other recently introduced models that feature ultraclean bodysides.\n\nA prominent twin kidney grille provides a connection to BMW tradition. Surrounded by painted surfaces, the grille is flanked by quad headlights inside luminous rings and beneath clear covers. Deeply wrapped lighting units are present in the front and rear. The turn signals have clear lenses. Amber LED front parking lights are thin and wedge shaped. The bodies incorporate BMWs traditional reverse kink at the rear door windows. The contemporary rear end features a high trunk lid.\n\nAdaptive brake lights are standard. A full aluminum suspension is installed, and all models have rack-and-pinion steering. Active Steering is included in the Sport Package. The brakes on each 5 Series model have been upsized, and ventilated discs are installed all around. Standard tires measure 17 inches in diameter, and 18-inch run-flat performance tires are included in the Sport Package.\n\nInterior\nFive people fit inside the 530i sedan. Backseat passengers have 1.3 inches more shoulder room than before, and1.8 inches of additional legroom. Leatherette upholstery and Titanium-finish trim are standard, but leather upholstery with wood trim is available. Both front occupants get 10-way power seat adjustment with a memory feature.\n\nA double wave theme is used for the dashboard. The tachometer now incorporates a variable warning segment that activates at lower rpm when the engine is cold. A three-spoke steering wheel holds multifunction controls. Rain-sensing wipers and a 10-speaker stereo with a CD player and twin subwoofers are standard.\n\nA simplified version of the iDrive control system, which was first used in the 7 Series, uses a 6.5-inch color display screen. Either the driver or the front passenger can use a knob atop the console; a new Menu button is featured there. When a navigation system is installed, additional iDrive functions are provided. One years service for the BMW Assist Program is provided with all 5 Series models. Radar-based Active Cruise Control is an option.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe 530is 3.0-liter dual-overhead-cam inline-six-cylinder engine develops 225 hp and 214 pounds-feet of torque. A 530i equipped with the standard six-speed-manual gearbox can accelerate from zero to 60 mph in 6.6 seconds, while the six-speed Steptronic automatic requires 6.9 seconds. The automatic unit incorporates Manual and Sport modes.\n\nA six-speed Sequential Manual Gearbox (SMG) will also be available in combination with a Sport Package. Shifted electrohydraulically, the SMG unit incorporates an automatic clutch. Gear changes may be specified using a console-mounted lever or twin paddles on the steering wheel. A Sport button is provided. BMWs engines meet ULEV-II (Ultra Low Emissions Vehicle) standards.\n\nSafety\nIntegrated Advanced Head Protection is standard. All 530i sedans have a flat-tire monitor. Dynamic Stability Control, which is activated with a console switch, can improve traction under difficult conditions. Active Roll Stabilization is offered as an option as part of the Sport Package, and this technology yields flatter cornering. Active Head Restraints are also available.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com;\nPosted on 9/26/03",

      "expert_review": "According to Kelley Blue Book, the online pricing-information source, the 10 “most researched” station wagons on its Web site (kbb.com) are, in order: the Subaru Outback, Dodge Caliber, Toyota Matrix, Chrysler Pacifica, Chevrolet HHR, Dodge Magnum, Audi A3, Pontiac Vibe, Chrysler PT Cruiser and Volkswagen Passat.\n\nI don’t know about you, but there are only three vehicles on that list that fit the description of what I consider to be a station wagon: the Outback, the Magnum and the Passat. Most of the vehicles on the list are what I would consider a hatchback — why Kelley Blue Book, and other such outlets, would consider the Volkswagen Rabbit a hatchback and the PT Cruiser a wagon, has never been explained to my satisfaction.\n\nIt sort of comes down to this: I may not know what a station wagon is, but I know one when I see one, and the 2007 BMW 530xi is a station wagon. But even it stretches the traditional definition: Station wagons are supposed to be more about carrying stuff than performance, and the 530xi splits the difference. There is 34 cubic feet of room in the rear — not enormous for a wagon, but it’s space that is usable and easy to access — but it’s the BMW-ness of the driving experience that sets the 530xi apart.\n\nNo manufacturer has nailed the happy medium between a smooth ride and handling like a sports car the way BMW has. The 530xi is perfectly happy cruising down the highway, but it seems even happier on winding backroads. Steering feel is just right, and despite the nearly 2-ton weight — some of that because of the all-wheel-drive system — it feels light on its feet. There is, as expected, a full complement of safety features.\n\nThe engine, though willing, is not as sporting as the rest of the car: It’s a 3.0-liter six-cylinder, with 255 horsepower. The transmission in the test car was a six-speed automatic, but a manual is available. I like manual transmissions, but I’m not a fan of most BMW manuals, so I was happy with the automatic. Fuel mileage is EPA-rated at 20 miles per gallon city, 27 highway with this transmission, or 19/28 with the manual. Premium is preferred.\n\nInside, the leather-trimmed seats are very firm, in BMW fashion, but comfortable. Rear-seat room is more than adequate. Unfortunately, BMW continues with its “iDrive” system, a joysticklike device that controls most functions such as stereo and climate, but this one is more user-friendly than early iDrives. One of the most pleasant aspects of the 530xi is the huge (BMW calls it “panoramic”) sunroof that extends even partly over the rear seat.\n\nAside from the price — $57,565 with several options — there’s little downside to the 530xi wagon. It allows you to carry your cake and eat it, too.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 BMW 5 Series?\n\nThe BMW 5 Series is a five-seat, mid-size luxury sedan that competes with rivals like the Acura TLX, Audi A6, Genesis G80 and Mercedes-Benz E-Class. The entry-level 530i is powered by a 255-horsepower, turbocharged four-cylinder that sends power to the rear wheels via an eight-speed automatic transmission. The 530i xDrive employs the same turbo four-cylinder but adds all-wheel drive. The 540i xDrive comes with a 375-hp, turbo 3.0-liter inline-six, AWD and the eight-speed gearbox. New for 2025 is the 550e xDrive plug-in hybrid, which uses the same turbo 3.0-liter six-cylinder but adds an electric motor for a total output of 483 hp and an EPA-estimated electric driving range of 34 miles.\n\nThe 2025 model year also marks the return of the high-performance M5, which is now offered as a Touring wagon in addition to a sedan. It comes standard with a PHEV powertrain that pairs a twin-turbo 4.4-liter V-8 with an electric motor for a total output of 717 hp. The M5 accelerates from 0-60 mph in about 3.5 seconds and has a BMW-estimated electric driving range of 25 miles.\n\nBMW also offers an all-electric version of the 5 Series called the i5. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 BMW 5 Series?\n\nThe 5 Series was redesigned for 2024 and sees little change for 2025 other than the addition of the 550e xDrive and M5.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 BMW 5 Series Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n14.9-inch touchscreen\n12.3-inch digital instrument cluster\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nWireless charging pad\nNavigation \nSatellite radio\nTwo USB ports\nWi-Fi hot spot\nKeyless entry\nMoonroof\n12-speaker Harman Kardon stereo\nSynthetic leather upholstery\nHeated front seats\nBlind spot warning \nRear cross-traffic alert\nAutomatic high beams\nLane departure warning\nRain-sensing wipers\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nVoice and gesture controls\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated rear seats\nPanoramic glass roof\nBowers & Wilkins audio system\nHeated steering wheel\nPower-operated rear sunshades\nAdaptive cruise control\nEvasive steering assist\nHead-up instrument display\n21-inch alloy wheels\nRear-wheel steering\nShould I Buy the 2025 BMW 5 Series?\n\nThe BMW 5 Series is a technical tour de force for car shoppers looking for a powerful and refined mid-size luxury sedan. With so many drivetrains on offer, there’s no shortage of ways to customize a 5 Series, and even the base 530i offers plenty of comfort, safety and tech features. While the 14.9-inch touchscreen is visually impressive, it can be confusing to use, and some menus are overly complicated. BMW fans might also find the 5 Series’ steering lacks the sharpness that’s often associated with the German automaker’s products. Yet for buyers who want to sidestep a larger, bulkier SUV, the 5 Series is a suave and sophisticated choice. The new M5 delivers jaw-dropping performance, but some enthusiasts complain it favors techno-wizardry over true driver engagement.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nIts been said that designers are at work on the next generation of BMWs midlevel sedan and wagon, but the launch of those models is a couple years down the line. For 2002, the Sport Premium and Convenience option packages are gone, and an in-dash CD player is newly standard. The 5 Series fits between BMWs smaller 3 Series and its flagship 7 Series sedan.\n\nThe 5 Series appearance was freshened for 2001. Base models equipped with a 2.5-liter inline-six-cylinder engine are called 525i, while those fitted with a larger 3.0-liter inline-six are designated 530i. The 4.4-liter V-8 that powers the 540i sedan and wagon was given a boost this year to 290 horsepower. All 5 Series models are rear-drive, have side-impact airbags for the front seats and come with a curtain-type Head Protection System. Side-impact airbags for the rear seats are optional.\n\nThe high-performance M5 sedan, which is fitted with a 394-hp, 5.0-liter V-8 engine and a six-speed-manual gearbox, also is available. Other 5 Series models may be equipped with either a manual or automatic transmission.\n\nExterior\nWith a 111.4-inch wheelbase, the 5 Series fits into the full-size category by cars.com standards, though some observers consider it a midsize model. At 188 inches long overall, the 5 Series is slightly shorter than the Mercedes-Benz E-Class sedan and nearly 9 inches shorter than the Lexus LS 430. In appearance, the 5 Series closely resembles its smaller and larger mates, all of which sport BMWs familiar twin-kidney grille.\n\nInterior\nSeating is provided for five occupants. Front bucket seats have 10-way power adjustment for the driver. Standard equipment on all models includes remote keyless entry, a 10-speaker audio system, a power tilt/telescoping steering column, heated power mirrors and an alarm. The 540i sedan adds such extras as a moonroof, dual-mode automatic air conditioning and xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights.\n\nLeather upholstery is standard in the 540i and optional in the 525i and 530i, which otherwise come with standard imitation-leather seating. All models can be equipped with an optional split, folding rear seatback and BMWs navigation system.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe 525i uses a 184-hp, 2.5-liter inline-six-cylinder engine, while a 225-hp, 3.0-liter inline-six goes into the 530i. Topping the regular lineup, the 540i gets a 4.4-liter V-8 that now produces 290 hp  8 hp more than last years engine. Six-cylinder models are available with either a five-speed-automatic or five-speed-manual transmission. The 540i comes with a five-speed-automatic or six-speed-manual transmission.\n\nThe 540i actually costs more when fitted with a manual shift than with the automatic, but stick-shift versions come with a Sport Package that includes 17-inch tires and a tauter suspension. All 5 Series models are rear-drive only, unlike the smaller 3 Series, which offers all-wheel drive as an option.\n\nSafety\nDual-stage front airbags deploy according to crash severity and whether occupants are buckled up. Side-impact airbags for the front seats and BMWs Head Protection System  which consists of curtain-type airbags that deploy to protect front-seat occupants  are standard. Side-impact airbags and head-protection curtains are optional for the rear seats. Standard safety features include antilock brakes, traction control and an electronic stability system that BMW calls Dynamic Stability Control. The optional Park Distance Control detects obstacles to the front and rear of the car while parking it.\n\nDriving Impressions\nBMW manages to mix big doses of both sport and luxury in the 5 Series models. Drivers can expect the precise maneuverability and control of a 3 Series, coupled with quite a few luxuries near the level of the big 7 Series. Although suspensions are undeniably firm, especially if the sedan is fitted with a Sport Package, ride comfort remains pleasant over most pavement surfaces.\n\nPerformance is reasonably energetic even with the smallest six-cylinder engine, but the V-8 unleashes a veritable torrent of strength for supremely confident highway operation. BMW appears to strive for symmetry in each of its models, so the dashboard and its easy-to-read gauges look about the same, regardless of the size of the sedan.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com;\nFrom the cars.com 2002 Buying Guide;\nPosted on 11/28/01",

      "expert_review": "I’m so excited to finally be testing the new 2006 BMW 530 xi Sport Wagon. I spotted it several months ago at an auto show and was intrigued by some of its innovative family friendly features.\n\nWith two children in child seats, I have the uncanny ability (gift or curse?) of sniffing out good and bad Latch connector designs from a mile away. I immediately gravitate towards the unique design BMW has implemented with this new addition to their product line.\n\nA spring-loaded, hinged cover swings back to reveal the Latch connector behind. Wait a minute: These actually work! BMW must have a new mom on their design and engineering team who goes through the hassle of installing car seats on a regular basis. Not only do these work, but they deserve an award.\n\nThe only problem with them is that they are not on every BMW out there. So I’ve decided to start a “standardize the BMW Latch design campaign.” While we’re at it, let’s just go full tilt and get the entire auto industry to standardize all Latch connectors (and use BMW’s great new design). I’ll put that on my “to-do” list right below ironing the linen tea napkins from a baby shower I hosted nearly three years ago.\n\nAfter installing the child car seats (and the children) I start to load up my gear. I push the little button on the key fob showing the open tailgate in hopes that it might, well, open the tailgate. I’m not so lucky, however, as the gate just ever so slightly cracks ajar. After referring to the owner’s manual, I follow the instructions for increasing the amount the tailgate opens but to no avail. The commands prompted in the manual do not match the ones on the car’s computer screen, so I give up.\n\nAfter securely stowing all sorts of nicks and knacks in the two in-floor storage bins and netted sidewall compartments of the cargo area, I hook my umbrella stroller under the large elasticized storage bands (keeping it from sliding from one side to the other with every turn). Closing the tailgate leaves me feeling warm and fuzzy all over when all I have to do it press the lighted button and the gate closes automatically while I move on to more important things in life.\n\nI jump in and start driving, thinking that I’ll just figure out the thermostat and radio controls on the way. Using my freehand to shift gears in my manual transmission test car doesn’t leave me much freedom to program the radio stations. That’s the excuse I like to use anyhow, because it’s less painful than the truth, which is that I cannot for the life of me figure out how this so-called iDrive computer system works.\n\nEven after reading the owner’s manual and referring to the interactive driver’s reference guide on CD-ROM, I still can’t work the thing and feel like a total loser. My free time would be better spent dusting off the biological calculus text book I never read in college.\n\nI am willing to look past this overly complicated iDrive system and the poorly designed cupholders that pop out from the dash because of the events that follow: When approaching a near total breakdown after one child in the back swipes the other’s last anointed goldfish cracker, my MacGyver-mom kicks in. I quickly open the panoramic sunroof (that extends from above the front seats all the way to the back seats) and engage the kids in a little game of cloud search.\n\nBefore I know it, the tantrum is a thing of the past and I’m enjoying a peaceful drive while the kids are actually taking turns looking for shapes in the clouds. How ethereal!\n\n*For more information on the BMW 530 xi Sport Wagon and its safety features visit Cars.com.\n\nLET’S TALK NUMBERS LATCH Connectors: 2 Seating Capacity (includes driver): 5\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT Storage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample Cargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore\n\nSENSE AND STYLE Family Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great Fun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times",

      "expert_review": "Competes with: Audi A6, Genesis G80, Jaguar XF, Mercedes-Benz E-Class\n\nLooks like: A longer, taller, wider 5 Series with more dynamic styling\n\nPowertrains: 335-horsepower, single-motor EV drive unit with 84.3-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack and rear-wheel drive (i5 eDrive40); 593-hp, dual-motor EV drive unit with 84.3-kWh lithium-ion battery pack and all-wheel drive (i5 M60); 255-hp, twin-turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine and RWD or AWD (530i); 375-hp, twin-turbo 3.0-liter six-cylinder (540i)\n\nHits dealerships: Now\n\nBMW’s mid-size 5 Series sedan was last revised for 2021, and it’s got some big news for 2024: The i5 fully electric version is joining the lineup.\n\nRelated: Packages, Paints, Prices Shift for 2023 BMW 5 Series\n\nFor 2024, the eighth generation of the 5 Series sees other changes, including revised styling, updated gas powertrains, additional driver-assistance features that take self-driving to another level and a new operating system for infotainment.\n\nExterior\n\nThe 2024 5 Series grows in every direction over 2023. The new model is 3.4 inches longer, 1.3 inches wider and 1.4 inches taller than the outgoing version. The sedan’s wheelbase has been increased by 0.8 inch; BMW says the added dimensions translate to more occupant space and cargo room. The new model’s styling changes are most dramatic in front, with a more upright grille and striking headlight design. Two nearly vertical daytime running lights flank the optional illuminated BMW kidney grille for a more dynamic looking face.\n\nThe i5 M60 wears additional gloss-black exterior styling bits as well as large air intakes, a grille featuring horizontal slats and an M logo, 19-inch M light alloy wheels, and a rear apron with a pronounced diffuser.\n\nInterior\n\nThe new 5 Series features a revised interior highlighted by the BMW Curved Display. The setup pairs a 12.3-inch information display behind the steering wheel with a 14.9-inch control display front and center; together they combine to create the look of one sleek, seamless large screen.\n\nThe iDrive infotainment system uses the latest version of BMW’s operating system, which the automaker says offers more modern graphics along with a cleaner-looking start screen and more intuitive operation. It can be controlled via the touchscreen, voice commands, steering wheel buttons and on the center console; gesture control functionality is optional, a reversal from its swift purging recently from the BMW lineup.\n\nOne new feature is an in-car gaming system via the AirConsole gaming platform. According to the automaker, the driver and passengers can stream content or play video games while the vehicle is stationary via a smartphone connection to the infotainment system. Games currently available include racing, sports and quiz games as well as simulation, strategy, jump-and-run and puzzle games, and BMW says the content will be continuously expanded.\n\nIn back, the rear seat folds in a 40/20/40 split, and trunk capacity is greater. According to BMW’s measurements, the i5 has 17.3 cubic feet of storage, while the 530i has 18.4 cubic feet, up from 2023’s 14.5 cubic feet.\n\nPerforated Veganza imitation leather is available for the 5 Series’ seats and surfaces; Merino leather upholstery in several colors is an option. Other options include a giant panoramic Sky Lounge that BMW says has a viewing area almost 90% larger than that of the standard tilt-and-slide moonroof.\n\nPowertrain Specs\n\nThe big news is the addition of the all-electric i5 eDrive40 and i5 M60. The rear-wheel-drive i5 eDrive40 uses an electric motor at the rear axle for a maximum power output of 335 horsepower and maximum torque of 295 pounds-feet or 317 pounds-feet when the Sport Boost or Launch Control functions are activated. BMW estimates its range at 295 miles with the model’s standard 19-inch wheels and says the model will sprint from 0-60 mph in 5.7 seconds. The performance-oriented all-wheel-drive i5 M60 variant adds a motor at the front axle that produces 257 hp for a total system output of 593 hp and 586 pounds-feet of torque (605 pounds-feet when M Sport Boost or the M Launch Control function is activated). BMW says the M60 sprints from 0-60 in 3.7 seconds and has an estimated range of 256 miles.\n\nThe models use a lithium-ion battery pack good for 84.3 kilowatt-hours and have a charging unit that enables Level 2 AC charging up to 11 kilowatts with a 205-kW max charging rate. According to the automaker, when connected to a DC fast charger, the battery can be topped up from 10% to 80% in about 30 minutes. First-time owners receive two years of complimentary 30-minute charging sessions at Electrify America DC fast-charging locations.\n\nFor 2024, 530i variants use a new generation of BMW’s turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-four-cylinder. For 2024, it makes 255 hp and 295 pounds-feet of torque, increases of 7 hp and 38 pounds-feet, respectively. It’s paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission.\n\nThe 540i xDrive also returns to the lineup. It again uses a twin-turbo 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder good for a maximum output of 375 hp, an increase of 40 hp over the previous generation. The engine’s maximum torque increases by 52 pounds-feet to 384 and can be boosted to 398 pounds-feet with the additional power of the 48-volt mild-hybrid system. BMW says it can accelerate from 0-60 in a scant 4.5 seconds. The automaker also said the 550e xDrive plug-in hybrid will join the lineup in the summer of 2024.\n\nSafety\n\nStandard safety systems include park assist, forward automatic emergency braking, lane departure steering assist, blind spot warning, rear cross-traffic alert with braking intervention, speed limit sign recognition and a safe exit assist. The optional Driving Assistance Professional Package includes a new feature, Highway Assistant. The system enables hands-free driving at speeds up to 85 mph where conditions and speed limits allow. The driver’s attention is continuously monitored by the system via an interior camera. It also uses a new feature BMW claims is a world first called Active Lane Change with eye activation: When the vehicle suggests a lane change, the driver can confirm it simply by looking in the corresponding outside rearview mirror.\n\nPricing and Release Date\n\nThe 2024 BMW 5 Series and i5 are on sale now.. Trim level pricing is as follows (all prices include destination fees):\n\n530i: $58,895 (an increase of $1,900)\n530i xDrive: $61,195 (an increase of 1,900)\ni5 eDrive40: $67,795\ni5 M60 xDrive: $85,095\n540i xDrive: $65,895 (a decrease of $300)\n\nEditor’s note: This story was updated Feb. 6, 2024, to revise specs and update the on-sale date.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nMore From Cars.com\n\n2021 BMW M5: Updates for the Ultimate 5 Series\n2021 BMW 540i M Sport Review: Light on Sport, Heavy on Tech\nIIHS: 2022-23 BMW 5 Series, X3 Upgraded to Top Safety Pick Plus\nMore BMW News\nFind Your Next Car\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
