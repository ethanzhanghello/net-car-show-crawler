      "expert_review": "Ergonomics is a fancy word that describes the relationship of man to the machine. At BMW, the 325i Sedan is ergonomics in action.\n\nThe 1992 BMW 325i is the latest offering from the German automobile manufacturer. To make the car easy, efficient and safe to operate, the company has turned up its engineering burners to full flame.\n\nThe result is a 3-series motor car attuned to what drivers need. It doesn’t make a whole lot of difference whether you start at the front or back, high tech dominates the features that contribute to the sedan’s performance and handling characteristics.\n\nUp front is a new 2.5-liter, 24-valve, in-line 6. In a time when most six-cylinder engines are of the V-6 configuration, BMW stays with its traditional six-in-a-row configuration for its double-overhead-cam power plant.\n\nAmidship is a new five-speed manual gearbox, or a four-speed electronically controlled automatic transmission with three shift programs. At the back is a C-link rear suspension that is so unlike anything in its class it is patented. Previously, this independent rear suspension was used only in the BMW Z1 sports car.\n\nIt’s on these basic elements that the 325i is built. When combined with the car’s passenger cabin elements, the end product is a world-class set of wheels – one readily acceptable in international markets.\n\nCurrent or past BMW owners, or even those who never have been introduced to the nameplate, will adapt easily to the automobile.\n\nThe 325i sedan that Sennis Reinbold, vice president and general manager of Dreyer & Reinbold BMW, provided for a test car had most of the controls placed in the same location as past BMWs. Everything is clearly marked and almost automatically falls to hand after a few minutes of driving.\n\nThe test car was equipped with an automatic transmission that could be shifted manually – just in case the convenience of an automatic becomes boring.\n\nThe automatic considerably domesticates the 325i, although there was a lot of pep in the sport mode. The standard Getrag five-speed manual gearbox still will provide much quicker acceleration and flexibility, and that probably will be the choice of the hot shoes.\n\nThe car has near 50/50 (front/back) weight distribution that permitted going through the corners with a high degree of panache. The chassis doesn’t play any tricks on you, and don’t get the impression you’re suddenly going to be looking at where you just have been.\n\nBasically, it’s a four-passenger car offering complete comfort. The sedan was a little easier to enter than to exit due to the need to climb over the bucket seat’s side bolsters. There was quite decent room for driver and passengers.\n\nMaybe for $30,000 there should have been power seats, but that was about the only thing missing in the comfort and convenience departments. BMW thinks of its ’92 325i as a driver’s car that launches like a rocket and stops like someone dropped the anchor overboard, courtesy of anti-lock brakes.",

      "expert_review": "BMW’s very thorough 3-Series has won more motoring titles than Nigel Mansell. In magazine comparison tests, it topped the style of the Lexus 300 and the spunk of the Nissan Maxima and the firecracker Ford Taurus SHO. Those temblors you’ve been feeling all year are the BMW 325 shoving through consumer and dealer satisfaction indices in all classes.\n\nMore important, this entry-level lineup of classy coupes and very sophisticated sedans is the edge that this year finally powered BMW well ahead of Mercedes-Benz in U. S. and world sales.\n\nTo broaden this success, the genetic compactness, quality, performance and full friskiness of the breed has been transferred to the 325i Convertible.\n\nAnd for places where outdoors is a lifestyle and temperate breezes a year-round right, the topless Bimmer comes close to perfection.\n\nWith a steel lid, the 325’s appeal is being one of those rare vehicles that combines the mundane purpose of carrying uncaring commuters with the rich pleasure of crisp, quick performance for motorists who do.\n\nThat the 325 does such with over-measures of comfort–Ritz-Carlton quality, leading-edge safety and driver-friendly technology–seems to be the secret bonuses of ownership.\n\nWithout its top, the 325i retains all those qualities while adding the ethereal–your freedom to sniff whatever fresh air industrial man still allows, while becoming a full player with the environment, scenery, God’s climates and all seasons.\n\nThat freedom, of course, is the ultimate tug of all convertibles. Ragtops are our escape from suffocating bubbles of glass and metal. Charming rakes, soccer stars, Ralph Lauren and others not expected to park between the lines drive convertibles. Pity other poor sods.\n\nThe base price of such liberty is $38,800, relatively affordable when one checks the upmarket options that are standard on this precise, superior German luxury car.\n\nOne might also remember thatMercedes’ 300 CE Cabriolet, BMW’s only competition in the league of tough, comfy convertibles, costs twice as much. Also that a 1994 Toyota Supra with fewer options than this Bimmer will top $38,000. So will a Cadillac DeVille and Acura Legend. And they aren’t convertibles.\n\nFrom solid shoulders on down, the 325i Convertible offers the chassis, all the successful mechanicals and most of the styling of the 325 coupe and sedan. The engine, a 2.5-liter, 24-valve, inline-six developing 189 horsepower, is mated to a four-speed automatic or five-speed manual.\n\nAnti-lock brakes are standard, of course. So are dual air bags, alloy wheels, speed-sensitive steering, leather upholstery, cruise control, power windows, air conditioning with left- and right-side controls and all possible conveniences from coin box to 10-speaker sound system pre-wired for a CD player.\n\n*\n\nThe curse of convertible building has always been car makers who believe that there is nothing to going topless beyond taking a chain saw to a coupe and adding a little bracing and a lot of prayer.\n\nDetroit–although catching European and Asian manufacturers in many areas of design, styling and production–still hasn’t learned how to build a really solid convertible and generally leaves such conversions to outside subs.\n\nOne result has been a generation of domestic swaybacks short on original rigidity and long on shakes, rattles and rolls.\n\nBMW–also Mercedes and Audi, which is poised to issue its first cabriolet–does it right by building the car from scratch as a convertible, not as some casual alteration.\n\nThat’s why the 325iConvertible doesn’t display the family ducktail. It looks good on coupes and sedans. But in convertible form, it sticks out . . . well, like a zit on a duck’s tail.\n\nStructurally, there are additional and heavier members crossing the floor pan and running its length. Floor stampings are thicker, so are rear wheelho sings. Bulkheads are given double walls, and windshield pillars are reinforced into virtual roll bars.\n\nAll of which adds 265 pounds to the convertible’s weight. But the car becomes 28% more rigid than convertible versions of the old three-box 325i coupe.\n\nThen BMW addressed matters of convenience and aesthetics.\n\nThe top is not a single-sheet tarp, but triple-layered polyacrylic with a creaseless headliner hiding a homey retraction mechanism and bracing bows. Multi-layered construction also reduces wind noise and improves insulation.\n\nRaising and lowering the top is as simple as A, B without even the complication of C. Unlatch a central handle at the windshield header and nudge upward. Press a console button. Grin like a twit as the top whirs up and back and stows itself in the trunk. Then a body-colored, fiberglass boot automatically snaps shut to tidy up the operation.\n\nWeather sealing is an habitual problem with convertibles. So are windows snagging edges of convertible tops. But BMW has that covered with typical Teutonic ingenuity: Windows drop a smidge as a door is opened, then automatically snug back into the weather channeling as doors close.\n\nSimilarly, with the top raising or retracting, four windows lower six inches so notto impede the process.\n\nThe convertible comes with optional, automatic roll bars that pop out in 3/10ths of a second once sensors pick up incipient rollover. Another system unlocks doors and activates hazard flashers and interior lights to assist rescuers.\n\nCentral locking includes the glove box because, after all, this is an open car. Practically the entire vehicle is recyclable. And an aluminum shell is available to fit over the soft top and negate Eastern arguments about convertibles being a Western vogue quite impractical in winter.\n\nThese touches have always set German cars apart from the pack. Production that favors craftsmanship before robotics also provides virtually unmatched quality. Each widget and whatsit is overengineered, made tougher than necessary, and offers more value than the motoring public appreciates.\n\nThat, of course, increases the costs of German luxury cars.\n\nNot buying a BMW 325i Convertible because of financial considerations remains a very valid argument.\n\nOn the other hand, was anyone’s spiritual life enriched by owning a Sterling?\n\n1994 BMW 325i Convertible\n\nThe Good Relatively affordable, full load of luxury. Solid ride and handling from a car built as a convertible, not a topless coupe. One-catch, one-button, effortless top. Superior aerodynamics allows open air motoring without wind damage.\n\nThe Bad Nothing found.\n\nThe Ugly What BMW is doing to Mercedes sales.\n\nCost Base: $38,800. As tested, $42,870. (Includes automatic transmission, leather seats, automatic roll bars, heated seats, two-place air conditioning, cruise control, power seats, on-board computer and alloy wheels.)\n\nEngine Inline, 24-valve, six-cylinder engine developing 189 horsepower.\n\nType Front-engine, rear-drive, four-passenger, two-door convertible.\n\nPerformance 0-60 m.p.h., as tested, with automatic, 9.7 seconds. Top speed, electronically limited, 128 m.p.h. Fuel consumption, EPA city and highway, 18 and 26 m.p.g.\n\nCurb Weight 3,429 pounds.",

      "expert_review": "A Dearborn reader wrote to us recently about some automotive arguments\n\ntaking place in his household.\n\n“We have two kids and two separate ideas about vehicles,” this husband and father admits.\n\nIt seems that he loves sport-utility vehicles. But his wife hates them. Sedans seem boring, plus they don’t feel roomy enough. A good compromise vehicle? A station wagon, they agree. In fact, they bought one. And now the couple are arguing about which one they should purchase next.\n\nIn the interest of defusing future marital spats, we wondered: What could make a meat-and-potatoes station wagon more palatable to moms and dads than giving it a little European panache? With that in mind, we plunged headlong into the German family wagon face-off. The Teutonic contenders: The 2001 BMW 325xi sport wagon and what, on the surface, may seem a surprising sparring partner – the 2001 Volkswagen Passat GLX wagon with 4Motion.\n\nBoth begin with almost identical base prices. The 325xi is a variant of the 325i wagon, which has a starting sticker of $29,400. The Passat GLX has a $29,550 base price. We chose models that came equipped with all-wheel drive systems, something we figured would be important to families cross-shopping SUVs.\n\nWith the $1,750 all-wheel-drive system and other extras like $475 metallic silver paint and a $1,050 power moonroof, the BMW topped out at $36,795. All-wheel drive, which VW calls 4Motion, costs $1,750 on the Passat. A $1,075 five-speed Tiptronic automatic transmission pushed the sticker to $32,925. We were anxious to see just how much buyers would have to give up if they opt for the less-expensive Volkswagen over the BMW. What we found out was quite reassuring. They don’t give up all that much.\n\nAfter a two-week test drive of the two Euro wagons, our impressions are that BMW is the obvious choice if you always pick the Ralph Lauren Polo shirt over the generic department-store version and fancy yourself a driving aficionado. But if you can live without the glamour of the gaudy brand name, the VW is a great choice – and it can save you almost $4,000 in the process.\n\nPaul summed it up perfectly: “The Passat is a better family vehicle with fewer compromises.”\n\nThe Passat, with its 190-horsepower 2.8-liter V-6 engine, held its own against the 325xi, which has a 184-horsepower 2.5-liter inline six-cylinder. Our test BMW had a standard five-speed manual transmission; the Volkswagen had the entertaining Tiptronic automatic, which can be shifted manually without a clutch.\n\nThe VW has more rear cargo space and a friendlier cabin, something that seems critical when you’re hauling kids and their gear. The BMW offers great handling and unbeatable build quality – better than the VW, which had noticeable gaps around areas like the glove box door.\n\nBoth vehicles had similar, classic station-wagon lines. But where the German-built wagons parted company was the interior. And that’s where we spe nt a lot of our time nit-picking. After all, to most families, the cabin becomes their rolling family room. It had better be roomy and comfortable. That’s where the Passat GLX has the 325xi beat.\n\nThe BMW wagon’s cabin looks like it was designed by Darth Vader, before he mellowed out and reunited with Luke. Perhaps it was the relentlessly monochromatic combination of the optional $1,450 black leather seats coupled with the weird gloss-black plastic trim on the 325xi that seemed off-putting to Anita. The seats in the BMW were comfortable, but nobody – driver or passengers – could get used to the complicated manual seat controls. We also heard complaints from back-seat passengers that the rear felt cramped. And while the gauges on the BMW’s instrument panel looked nice, the radio controls were tiny and overly complicated.\n\nIntruding into the cabin was a bit of engine and tire noise. If you opt for the BMW, be prepared for a harsher ride than you get in the Passat – the price ou pay for the handling edge provided by the Bimmer.\n\nThe Passat’s cabin was pleasant, with power driver and passenger seats, wood trim and tasteful light leather. Heated front seats are standard in the VW. On the BMW, they are part of a $700 cold-weather package that includes a ski bag and headlamp cleaning system.\n\nNew for 2001 on the GLX model are the addition of steering-wheel controls for radio and cruise. Controls and gauges overall were easy to read and use. We heard no complaints from the rear passengers about feeling claustrophobic in the Passat. The cabin calm was broken by a bit of wind and road noise, however. Neither vehicle had a standard CD player, which we consider an oversight in this price class.\n\nGas mileage won’t be the deal-breaker here, since both wagons are very close. The 325xi gets 19 miles per gallon in the city and 26 miles per gallon on the highway; the Passat GLX gets 17 miles per gallon in the city and 24 miles per gallon on the highway.\n\nNew for 2001 on the VW are side curtain air bags, which protect front and rear passengers in a crash. They come in addition to front and side bags on the Passat. The Passat also has standard anti-lock brakes and height-adjustable front seat belts.\n\nOf course, the BMW wagon also has superior safety features, including front and side air bags and a head-protection air-bag system for front seat passengers. The 325xi also features standard anti-lock brakes, traction control and dynamic stability control, which helps prevent skids and “fishtailing” on slick pavement.\n\nThe BMW wagon has the VW wagon beat when it comes to free maintenance and warranty coverage. The 325xi comes with three-year/36,000-mile free maintenance and a four-year/50,000-mile warranty. It also has a four-year/50,000-mile roadside assistance program. VW does free scheduled maintenance for two years or 24,000 miles and offers a two-year/24,000-mile warranty on the GLX wagon. The VW roadside assistance program is good for two years.\n\nThere are no arguments in the Lienert family about which German wagon is the best value. You may have more fun driving the BMW. But we’re recommending the Passat GLX wagon as our top pick for families.\n\n2001 BMW 325xi VS. 2001 VW Passat GLX\n\nBMW 325xi\n\nWheelbase: 107.3 in.\n\nLength: 173.6 in.\n\nWidth: 68.5 in.\n\nHeight: 56.3 in.\n\nWeight: 3,627 lbs.\n\nEngine: 2.5L DOHC I-6\n\nOutput: 184 hp\n\nFuel Economy: 19/26 mpg.\n\nBase Price: $29,400\n\nPrice as Tested: $36,795\n\nVW Passat\n\nWheelbase: 106.4 in.\n\nLength: 183.8 in.\n\nWidth: 68.5 in.\n\nHeight: 59.0 in.\n\nWeight: 3,603 lbs.\n\nEngine: 2.8L DOHC V-6\n\nOutput: 190 hp\n\nFuel Economy: 17/24 mpg.\n\nBase Price: $29,550\n\nPrice as Tested: $32,925",

      "expert_review": "As regular readers have already discovered, I am a big fan of compact sport wagons. They are small, agile and utilitarian; they are big enough to haul moderate loads, small enough to be reasonably fuel efficient and easy to handle.\n\nBMW’s rear-wheel-drive 325i wagon joins the Audi A4, Volkswagen Passat, Mercedes-Benz C320 and Mazda Protege 5. Powered by a 184-horsepower, 2.5-liter six-cylinder engine, the 3-series wagon marries BMW’s traditional fun-to-drive personality with the utility of a small station wagon. Having the capacity to carry baby gear, lawn supplies or outdoor equipment doesn’t mean you have to drive a boring vehicle. The 325i wagon looks sharp and athletic, more interesting to some eyes than the four-door sedan. The base price is $30,045 and $31,895 for the all-wheel-drive model.\n\nSmall wagons are tremendously popular in Europe, where most families have to rely on just one vehicle to serve a variety of needs. Although these little haulers havenÕt typically been all that popular in this country, there seems to be a rising tide of interest in cars that are capable of providing fun and function in a compact package.\n\nBMW’s 2.5-liter, DOHC in-line engine is a model of sweetness. Minimal vibration is inherent in the six-cylinder design, and technical advancements such as variable valve timing allow its power to be spread over a wide rpm range. That enhances drivability as well as performance. The 325’s engine has a free-revving spirit that is perfectly served by the five-speed manual gearbox and its ball-bearing smooth shift linkage. Running to the hardware store for a couple more bags of mulch can be as satisfying as powering through an interstate cloverleaf on the way to work.\n\nModest visual changes have been applied to the 3-series for 2002. The headlight clusters have been reshaped with deeper cutouts and new lights. The dual kidney grille is wider, hood lines have a sharper sweep and front-wheel cutouts are larger. Subtle changes, to be sure, but ones that add more interest.\n\nThe 325xi wagon offers the security of all-wheel drive plus a special version of BMW’s dynamic stability control program that also features BMW’s Hill Descent Control from the X5 sport-utility vehicle. Hill Descent Control helps the driver maintain control at a walking pace on steep downhill roads by pressing a console button. This would be especially helpful for those who drive in the mountains or on unimproved country roads.\n\nA fully independent suspension and generous disc brakes are key to the handling prowess of the 325i wagon. It sticks to the roads with impressive grip. Body lean and sway are minimized, and the powerful disc brakes erase speed with confidence and great feel.\n\nThe 325’s interior remains as it has been: functional, attractive and comfortable. Deeply contoured seats and easy-to-read gauges are its highlights. The steering wheel has fingertip controls for audio and cruise control, although their markings are somewhat cryptic. The AM/FM/CD stereo and automatic climate control system are easy to understand and use. Power window switches located on the center console are not as intuitive as switches mounted on the door panels.\n\nFront and side airbags are standard in front, as are the tubular head protection side airbags that inflate across the windows. Side airbags for the rear seats are optional.\n\nA crucial element in sport wagons is the ease with which the rear seat can be folded down, and the 325 excels in this area. No seat bottom to tip forward, no headrests to remove; just tug the release switch and pull down. Like a hatchback, the rear tailgate pivots open to yield a wide opening.\n\nIf you’re looking for driving fun and everyday utility in one package, check out a sport wagon like the 325 from BMW. You’ll be surprised at how practical and enjoyable it can be.\n\nPrice\nThe base price of the test car was $30,045. Options included metallic paint, leather u holstery, heated seats, moon roof, wood trim, power seats, Xenon headlights, park distance control and the upgraded Harman-Kardon stereo. The sticker price was $37,195.\n\nWarranty\nFour years or 50,000 miles.\n\nPoint: The 325i sport wagon is a good compromise for those who value driving fun and hauling versatility. It handles like a sports sedan, hauls like a station wagon and gets decent fuel economy. All-wheel drive is an option for those who want all-weather traction.\n\nCounterpoint: The current 3-series is beginning to look dated despite minor styling tweaks, a well-optioned model is fairly expensive and power window switches are located on the center console rather than the door panels.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\nEngine: 2.5-liter, 184-hp 6-cyl.\nTransmission: Five-speed Rear-wheel drive\nWheelbase: 107.3 inches\nCurb weight: 3,362 lbs.\nBase price: $30,045\nAs driven: $37,195\nMpg rating: 20 city, 29 hwy.\n> >",

      "expert_review": "Parents who aren’t quite ready to make the leap into a minivan may be intrigued by such hot-looking properties as the 2006 BMW 325xi. The compact German sport wagon offers style and performance, but, unfortunately, not a lot of space for new families and all the gear they have to haul once baby arrives.\n\nWe tested a nicely equipped 325xi recently with such amenities as a panorama moonroof, all-wheel drive and a $2,900 premium package that included leather upholstery, power seats with driver memory and an auto-dimming rearview mirror with a compass.\n\nBottom line: $40,190, including destination.\n\nSHE: I was so happy when our neighbors, Amy and Mike, rang our doorbell one Sunday afternoon, with baby Caroline in tow. They own a BMW 3-Series sedan and an X5 utility vehicle, and had spotted the electric-red BMW wagon in our driveway. Since they are shopping for a more family-friendly vehicle, they wanted to try out the 325xi. They even brought the baby’s car seat and stroller so they could really put the wagon through its paces. I thought that was great, since the only stuff you haul around anymore are guitars and fishing rods.\n\nHE: Hey, those are mybabies. They need special care and attention, too.\n\nSHE: Oh, boy. I’m never sure if I’m talking to a parent or a child here.\n\nHE: I thought the 325xi was sweet. And I’m not particularly a wagon buff. But if you need a little extra cargo space, it’s a nice alternative to a standard sedan or even a compact SUV like the X3. I’d have to agree with you that it makes less sense than a minivan, especially if you have two or more kids of any age.\n\nSHE: It was interesting to watch Amy critique the BMW wagon. She was disappointed that she could only load Caroline’s stroller in one way, and she said the cargo hold was not much roomier than the trunk of her 2003 BMW sedan. We’re about the same size and we both agreed that it needs adjustable pedals. The cupholders are pretty worthless, too — kind of surprising, considering the Germans’ usual attention to detail. The other problem with the wagon is that the rear pillars are so thick, they block your vision, especially when you’re trying to change lanes on the freeway.\n\nHE: I think Mike liked the fact that the wagon handles like a sport sedan. In fact, the wagon has just about all the same equipment, which means that the steering is pinpoint-precise, the suspension is supple and the brakes are simply outstanding. Of course, you get all the standard BMW goodies, like dynamic stability and traction control, to further enhance the all-weather capability of the four-wheel-drive system.\n\nSHE: I love the fact that even on its low-end models, like the 3 Series, BMW loads up the safety gear. The 325xi comes with standard side air bags and side curtains for all the outboard passengers and ABS with dynamic brake control.\n\nHE: You say “low end,” and I assume you’re being slightly facetious, considering this “low-end” wagon costs 40 grand. But it has an awful lot going for it, not the least of which is that exquisite cabin. It’s trimmed in two-tone leather — black and brown.\n\nSHE: They call it “terra,” honey.\n\nHE: Yeah, right. That sounds really German, doesn’t it? OK, black and “terra” leather, with lots of gorgeous wood and brushed metal. I didn’t fit that well in the rear seat — my head brushed up against the headliner — but at least the passengers back there are treated to some decent amenities, including a pull-down armrest, individual reading lights, vents and temp controls. I should mention that our test vehicle, thankfully, did not come with BMW’s overly complicated iDrive — just the usual assortment of buttons, switches and dials.\n\nSHE: Did you know that both Amy and Mike griped about the lack of power in the 3.0-liter engine? I guess 215 horsepower doesn’t cut it with some folks.\n\nHE: Not if they’ve driven other Bimmers. I did love that buttery-smooth six-speed manual gearbox. I guess I’m just not convinced that this is really a family car.\n\nSHE: Neither is Amy. The last time I saw her, she had just tested a minivan, so I guess she’s opting for practicality. I think the moral of the story is that the BMW wagon is better suited for young singles or empty nesters.\n\nHe drove, she drove Anita and Paul Lienert are partners in Lienert & Lienert, a Ann Arbor-based automotive information services company.\n\n2006 BMW 325xi\n\nType: Front-engine, four-wheel drive, five-passenger wagon. Price: Base, $35,295 (inc. $695 destination charge); as tested, $40,190. Engine: 3.0-liter I-6; 215-hp; 185 lb-ft torque. EPA fuel economy: 19 mpg city/28 mpg highway. Where built: Germany Estimated 12-month insurance cost, according to AAA: $1,739 Anita\n\nRating: 4 Likes: Really sharp exterior styling. World-class safety features. Optional adaptive headlamps. Standard dynamic stability and traction control. Optional panorama moonroof. Dislikes: Not a viable alternative to a minivan for many families. Needs adjustable pedals. Cupholders are terrible. Rear pillars block vision.\n\nPaul\n\nRating: 5 Likes: Sweet six-speed manual gearbox. Exquisite cabin with two-tone leather, wood, brushed metal. Handles like a sport sedan. Outstanding brakes. Good rear-seat amenities. Dislikes: Engine needs more power and low-end torque. Head brushes ceiling in rear seat. Pushbutton stop/start requires extra step, seems gimmicky. Run-flat tires are noisy.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nA wholly redesigned version of BMW’s smallest series will debut in spring 2005. Meanwhile, the 325 gets enhanced equipment and options for the 2005 model year.\n\nWood interior trim is now standard, and aluminum trim is offered as a no-cost option. Bluetooth capability is now included with BMW Assist. Sirius Satellite Radio and an iPod adapter can be installed at a BMW Center.\n\nBMW gave its 325 coupe and convertible a substantial freshening for its 2004 models; sedans and wagons soon followed. New front ends for the 325Ci coupe and convertible feature lighting units that sweep upward as they wrap around the bodysides.\n\nIn addition to the four-door 325i and 325xi sedans and the 325Ci coupe and convertible, the lineup includes 325i and 325xi wagons. All models use a 2.5-liter inline-six-cylinder. BMW’s six-speed Sequential Manual Gearbox is no longer available.\n\nBMW also sells 330 models with a larger engine. Like other BMW passenger cars, the 325 is traditionally equipped with rear-wheel drive, but an all-wheel-drive 325xi sedan and wagon are available.\n\nExterior\nAll 3 Series models exhibit BMW’s familiar look, with four round wraparound-style headlights and a twin-kidney grille. Coupe and convertible models are 176.7 inches long overall, while the sedans and wagons are fractionally shorter. All 325 models have a 107.3-inch wheelbase, but two-door body styles are lower. Coupe and convertible windshields are slanted 2 degrees more than the sedan’s.\n\nConvertibles have a standard power top. Standard tires are 16 inches in diameter, but 17-inch wheels come in a Sport Package. Xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights are available either alone or with an adaptive feature that steers the headlights into oncoming curves.\n\nInterior\nSedans, coupes and wagons hold up to five occupants, while the convertible is a four-seater. Space is ample up front with twin bucket seats, but passengers can’t really stretch their legs in the backseat. A typical BMW dashboard holds large, clearly marked gauges.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 184-horsepower, 2.5-liter inline-six-cylinder mates with either a standard five-speed-manual gearbox or an optional five-speed-automatic transmission; the automatic permits manual gear changes.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes, traction control, side-impact airbags and front-seat side curtain-type airbags (in closed models) are standard. Rear-seat side-impact airbags are optional. The front airbags deploy with less force in low-speed impacts. BMW’s Dynamic Stability Control stability system reduces engine power and applies the brakes to prevent skids.\n\nDriving Impressions\nFor many enthusiasts, BMW is still the standard by which other makes are judged � partly because the German automaker stresses driving dynamics. Spirited performance and crisp handling are the bywords. Most drivers will be content with the performance offered in any 325 model, which can be as much fun to drive as models in the more potent 330 lineup. BMW’s manual gearshift is an absolute joy to operate.\n\nAthletic maneuvers are the norm in both ordinary and demanding driving. The availability of all-wheel drive is a bonus for driving on ice and snow. The seats are firm and driver-oriented, but getting in and out of a 325 isn’t quite as easy as in some cars.",

      "expert_review": "BMW 325xi\n\nThe Werks and I have had our differences. For instance, I think some of the newer cars — the Z4, X3 and 5-series sedans — are ugly enough to unknit the fabric of space-time. They point to the company’s effortlessly rising sales figures and direct me to the nearest rolling doughnut.\n\nReasonable minds may disagree.\n\nBut when it comes to the BMW 325xi Sports Wagon, the boys from Bavaria and I come to terms: This is a superb car, as smooth as a mink glove, satisfying and well-rounded, polished and competent to the marrow.\n\nThe current 3-series generation is several years old, but the car doesn’t feel dated so much as well sorted. Compared to the alienating instrumentation of the recent 5-series, for instance, which always feels just a little out of one’s mental reach (How do I switch radio bands again?), the 3-series controls are models of fuss-free, intuitive design. The car is a symphony of little things: the dinner-jacket fit of the bucket seats (leather interior is a $1,450 option); the feel of the leather steering wheel in your hands, like the best outfielder’s glove; the panoramic sightlines from the driver’s seat. The car feels like a biometric appliance.\n\nThe all-wheel-drive wagon is more than 300 pounds heavier than the rear-wheel-drive sedan (3,627 pounds versus 3,307), and that translates to more than a half-second penalty from 0-60 mph (7.8 seconds versus 7.1). Pushed around by a 2.5-liter, 187-hp inline 6, the 3-series is in no sense overpowered; yet the engine’s variable-valve timing and electronic throttle spread the torque across the rev counter like jam on toast. The engine pulls at just about every rpm (peak torque is 175 pound-feet at 3,500 rpm).\n\nIt’s an eagerness, a friction-free gait that makes the naturally aspirated engine feel as if it were turbocharged.\n\nOur test car was equipped with the five-speed manual transmission; a five-speed automatic or six-speed sequential manual gearbox is optional. The 225-hp, 3.0-liter engine is not available in an AWD wagon.\n\nIt would be hard to tell from the car’s handling that it is, in fact, a station wagon. The 325xi’s agility and snubbed-down ride is classic Bimmer; our test car’s front strut and rear multi-link suspension were endowed with sport suspension’s tauter settings. The steering is as precise as a diplomat’s language. The car doesn’t have quite the liveliness of the sedan or coupe, because of the weight and because of the AWD. The system uses a planetary (mechanical) differential with a fixed-torque split, apportioning 38% of the engine torque to the front wheels and 62% to the rear.\n\nMasterminding the traction are the same electronic brains in the X3 and X5 SUVs. The Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) includes traction control, hill-descent control, anti-lock braking and stability control — all systems designed to maintain grip and direction. The car comes with 17-inch all-season radials. A change of shoes to winter tires will be necessary to beat up the snowy roads to the ski resorts.\n\nFor all its road-savvy handling and performance, the 325xi’s versatile cargo space might be its best feature. With the 60/40-split rear seats upright, capacity is 25 cubic feet, 150% better than the sedan’s. The cargo compartment is equipped with floor straps, a cargo net, an accessory power outlet and a retractable cargo cover. This window-shade-like device detaches easily from the bulkheads; in some cars, removing and replacing this device is like fighting an anaconda.\n\nAnother nice feature of the sport wagon is the hatch with the separately opening window. Also, while other small wagons may require you to tilt forward the rear seat bottoms and remove the headrests to create a flat floor in the cargo bay, the 325xi couldn’t ask for less: two easy-to-reach latches allow the rear seat backs to fold forward. That’s it.\n\nOur test car was loaded to the gills wit a cold-weather package ($750); premium package including power seats and upgraded interior trim ($2,400); xenon headlights ($700); and Harman-Kardon sound system ($675).\n\nThe total was $40,045.\n\nThat’s a lot of money. But it’s a lot of car — rain-sensing windshield wipers, automatic headlight control, power moon roof, intelligent brake lights — the full smash.\n\nIf you don’t like the idea of driving a “station wagon,” I have a solution. Don’t look behind you. You will soon forget.\n\nWagons, ho\n\nI hate being right all the time. Nonetheless, I predicted some time ago that the SUV’s house of cards — or is that House of Saud? — was imperiled by the threat of rising fuel costs and the long-term aggravation that these vehicles impose on their drivers. Now that fuel prices have indeed spiked, buyers are leaving SUVs in droves (the bribing incentive and rebate structure of the manufacturers notwithstanding). Fortunately, thanks to cars like the Volvo V50 and BMW 325xi, they have someplace to go.\n\n2004 BMW 325xi Sport Wagon\n\nPrice as tested: $40,045\n\nPowertrain: 2.5-liter inline-6, variable-valve timing, electronic throttle; five-speed manual transmission; planetary\n\ngear center differential;\n\nall-wheel drive.\n\nHorsepower: 184 hp @ 6,000 rpm\n\nTorque: 175 pound-feet @ 3,500 rpm\n\nWeight: 3,627 pounds\n\n0-60 mph: 7.8 seconds\n\nWheelbase: 107.3 inches\n\nOverall length: 176.3 inches\n\nEPA mileage: 19 miles per gallon city, 26 highway\n\nCompetitors: Audi A4 1.8 T Avant Quattro, Volvo V50 T5 AWD\n\nFinal thoughts: Clutch Cargo",
