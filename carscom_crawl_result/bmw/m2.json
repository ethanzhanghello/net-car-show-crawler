      "expert_review": "BMW’s cheapest and perhaps best M car, the M2, gets a little less cheap but slightly more powerful for the 2025 model year. While the base price of $66,075 (including $1,175 destination) represents an increase of nearly $2,000 from the 2024 M2, that nets buyers an additional 20 horsepower, as well as BMW’s new Curved Display running the company’s Operating System 8.5.\n\nRelated: Is the 2023 BMW M2 a Good Car? 5 Pros and 4 Cons\n\nMore Power for All, More Torque for the Automatic\n\nThe extra power lofts the M2’s twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder engine to 473 horsepower, up from 453 hp for 2024. With the six-speed manual transmission, torque remains at 406 pounds-feet, generated from 2,650 to 6,130 rpm. Buyers who spec the no-cost eight-speed automatic unlock an additional 37 pounds-feet of twist, for a total of 443; the higher torque peak is realized across a slightly narrower plateau, from 2,700 rpm to 5,620.\n\nBMW claims the extra output shaves 0.1 second from the M2’s 0-60 mph time, dropping the manual to 4.1 seconds and the automatic to 3.9. Top speed with either transmission remains 155 mph, or 177 with the optional M Driver’s Package. Revised accelerator mapping makes for a more reactive feel in all drive modes.\n\nInterior Upgrades and Exterior Tweaks\n\nNow standard on the M2, BMW’s Curved Display seamlessly joins a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster with a 14.9-inch infotainment screen under a single piece of curved glass. The company’s Operating System 8.5 allows drivers to adjust various secondary systems via touch, the iDrive knob or voice control.\n\nThe new display setup is accompanied by a new flat-bottom steering wheel with a red center marker. A leather wrap is standard; simulated suede and heating (with either wrap) are available. The lightweight M Carbon bucket seats are now available as a stand-alone option as well as bundled with the Carbon Package. While they’re designed to work with racing harnesses, they’re not aimed solely at performance, as they feature power adjustment and heating.\n\nThe 2025 M2 also expands the 2024 model’s somewhat limited exterior palette of two non-metallic paints and five metallic finishes — there are now three solid colors, seven metallic paints and four BMW Individual shades. Whereas the seven colors on the 2024 car were divided among black, white, gray, red and blue, choices now include Sao Paulo Yellow, Java Green Metallic and Twilight Purple Pearl Effect.\n\nRegardless of paint color, all 2025 M2s feature black badging, exhaust tips, and wheels — though the latter are also available in two-tone and bright silver finishes.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2023 BMW M2 Review: Mmm Mmm Good (and Nearly Great)\n2024 BMW 2 Series Carries Over Mostly Unchanged, Starts at $39,395\nWhich New Cars Have Manual Transmissions?\nRedesigned 2023 BMW M2: The Smallest M Scores Big HP Boost\nResearch the BMW M2\nAvailability and Pricing\n\nProduction of the 2025 BMW M2 will begin this August, with deliveries to start shortly thereafter.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2023 BMW M2 isn’t a perfect sports car — is anything? — but it’s damn close. If BMW can figure out how to give it a better exhaust note and make the steering more communicative, it’d be even closer. Just don’t stare directly at it.\n\nVersus the competition: “Affordable” Porsches, loaded mid-level muscle cars and compact luxury sports sedans are all in the M2’s $70,000-ish price range, and all of them involve a variety of compromises, just like the M2. But if you’re looking for a hardcore driver’s car, and you can afford it, the M2 should be on your list.\n\nThe 2023 BMW M2 might be the purest sports car left in BMW’s lineup: two doors, rear-wheel-drive only and a standard six-speed manual transmission. It’s also the most affordable (and I use that word loosely) of BMW’s “true” M cars — the ones with only a single digit after the M.\n\nThe M2 is redesigned for the 2023 model year, closely following BMW’s redesign of its pedestrian 2 Series sibling. That means the new M2 is longer, wider, lower and heavier than its predecessor — so heavy, in fact, it’s barely any lighter than a stock M4 coupe.\n\nMore important than the M2’s dimensions, though, or where it tips the scale is whether or not it’s a good sports car. I spent a week driving a 2023 M2 with the (no-cost) optional eight-speed automatic transmission (sorry, purists) to find out.\n\nRelated: Redesigned 2023 BMW M2: The Smallest M Scores Big HP Boost\n\nWeight Be Damned, It Goes Like Hell\n\nAt the heart of the new M2 is a familiar power plant: a twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder engine. BMW says it makes 453 horsepower, which is 48 hp more than the previous M2 Competition, and that torque remains the same at 406 pounds-feet. BMW quotes a 0-60 mph time of 3.9 seconds with the eight-speed automatic, and they’re notoriously conservative about that sort of thing. While we didn’t get to measure our own 0-60 time, I can tell you power comes on quickly; peak torque is delivered between 2,650 and 5,870 rpm, according to BMW. Even without Launch Control, this is one of the first non-electric cars I’ve driven in a while that delivers genuine push-you-into-your-seat acceleration.\n\nThe eight-speed automatic is excellent, with snappy up- and downshifts, though it seemed to occasionally hesitate when I used the column-mounted shift paddles. It’s a traditional torque-converter transmission that replaces the last M2’s seven-speed dual-clutch automatic, which, frankly, I don’t miss at all. If there is a performance downgrade, it’s imperceptible, and while the eight-speed has occasional lurchy behavior at low speeds — especially in more aggressive driving modes — it’s far more livable in day-to-day driving than was the DCT.\n\nAs impressive as the M2’s straight-line speed is, it’s even better when the road gets twisty. Steering feel is still more numb than I would like, but extra chassis stiffening and a unique suspension compensate for it in ways that the more pedestrian M240i couldn’t. Handling prowess doesn’t come without a cost, however, and in the M2, that cost is an extremely firm ride. It wasn’t a deal breaker for me, and the M division suspension engineers should feel proud that the M2 handled Chicago’s rough roads with far better isolation than did the automaker’s XM plug-in hybrid SUV. That said, the M2’s ride is firm enough that it was among the first things other editors mentioned when talking about the car. The M2’s brakes were both powerful and easy to modulate — important given slowing down in the twisties is also important.\n\nThe M2 makes a strong case as a performance daily driver thanks to its configurability and relatively frugal fuel economy. Nearly every aspect of the driving experience — powertrain responsiveness, braking, steering, suspension firmness and more — can be dialed in to the driver’s preferences and saved to one of two M buttons on the steering wheel. More importantly, those differences are noticeable, so while the ride will always be firm, you can save the really firm setting for a track or smooth sections of pavement. (Note: If you know where those are, please let me know.)\n\nIf you’re going to spend time stuck in traffic, note that the M2 merely drinks its required premium gas, rather than gulping it like a muscle car would. It’s EPA-rated 16/23/19 mpg city/highway/combined with the automatic transmission. It’s not a great combined rating, but in my not-so-efficient driving time, I usually saw fuel economy readings in the 20s, surpassing it.\n\nThe most notable drawback to the driving experience is the car’s lackluster exhaust note. It approaches — but never reaches — a burble at idle, and even when you stand on the accelerator, with the loudest exhaust setting activated, it’s loud but restrained in a way that doesn’t match the action. We lodged a similar complaint about the Audi RS 3, so maybe it’s a German thing, but I wanted the exhaust sound to match the M2’s “I’m young and make tastefully reckless financial decisions” vibe. Fortunately, a new exhaust is probably among the easiest modifications an owner could make to correct BMW’s seeming oversight (or additional money-making opportunity, given BMW will sell you those parts themselves).\n\nSurprisingly Comfortable Up Front\n\nThe M2’s daily-driver credentials are bolstered by just how comfortable it is up front with the sport seats that came standard in our test vehicle. They were nicely bolstered without overly narrowing the base of the seat, and the cushioning was excellent; I felt less tired after a lengthy drive in the M2 than I have in many large SUVs. Visibility is also pleasantly good for such a small car; the rear windscreen is small, but the view out isn’t cluttered by rear head restraints.\n\nNot that the backseat really needs head restraints; it’s more of a glorified package shelf behind the front seats, with minuscule leg- and headroom. This lack of more than two useful seats hurts the M2’s ability to be a primary vehicle, making it more akin to true two-seaters like the Porsche 718 Boxster or Cayman. If you’re looking for performance but also need to carry more than one passenger, you may want to consider something with two more doors, like the RS 3 (though its backseat is hardly roomy).\n\nI enjoyed the M-specific touches throughout the cabin, from multicolored textured inserts in the doors to striped seat belts and colorful upper portions for the standard front seats. While the rest of the cockpit looks like other M cars, materials quality is relatively cheap, with a smattering of hard plastic below the windows and on lower surfaces. The optional M Carbon bucket seats get Merino leather trim (and probably save a few pounds), and they look appropriately sporty in photos. We didn’t get to test them, though, so make sure they’re comfortable before dropping $9,900 on the Carbon Package.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nWhich New Cars Have Manual Transmissions?\n2023 BMW 2 Series Carries Over With Minor Changes, Bumps Price to $39,195\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto: Where Are They Now?\n2024 BMW X1: BMW’s Small SUV Now Gets 312-HP M35i xDrive\n2023 BMW XM Review: Indulge if You Dare\nAlmost Too Tech-y\n\nNew to the M2 is a standard curved display, which is BMW’s term for its connected 12.3-inch configurable digital instrument panel and 14.9-inch touchscreen. Graphics on both screens are crisp and clear. The instrument panel can display a variety of data, bordering on information overload, but both the Sport and Track settings reduce what’s shown down to just the most important things.\n\nThe center touchscreen suffers from a similar issue, with tiles for so many settings and features it can feel a bit overwhelming at first. The system’s operation is straightforward, however, and once you have the car dialed in how you want it, you won’t have to use most of them. Wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are standard, and CarPlay looks great on the large screen. I occasionally experienced some lag with CarPlay when attempting to input several commands in quick succession — skipping multiple songs in a row, for example — and given a wireless device charger doesn’t come standard (it’s a $200 option), a wired connection may be preferable.\n\nThe optional head-up display also looks nice, and as a bonus, it can display turn-by-turn navigation directions using either the native system or Apple Maps; on the down side, polarized sunglasses wash out most of the pertinent information. If your eyewear makes the feature useless, save your money and stick with the excellent standard digital instrument panel.\n\nLooks Rough\n\nFrom many angles, the M2 has an aggressive presence that it definitely lives up to with its driving experience. The front styling, however, is a significant departure from other BMWs. It lacks the big, buck-toothed grille design of the M3 and M4; instead, every opening where you’d traditionally see rounded shapes is squared-off. It’s almost as if the car hasn’t quite finished rendering. Fortunately, you don’t have to look at the M2 when you’re driving it.\n\nOur test car also had optional 50th anniversary badges to celebrate five decades of M cars. In a vacuum, the badges look nice, but in the wild, they looked out of place, likely due to the iconic nature of BMW’s usual badges. At the other end of the spectrum, my mom described the M2 as “adorable” — probably not what its designers (or buyers) are going for.\n\nMuch like the exhaust’s relatively muted nature, the available exterior color palette for the M2 is — for now, anyway — blander than a car like this deserves. Hopefully, future model years will get wilder color options.\n\nAmong the Best of a Dwindling Bunch\n\nPurist sports cars, especially ones with manual transmissions, feel like a dying breed. Despite its compromises, the M2 is an excellent option for shoppers looking for something that’s a riot to drive but still offers some luxury. With an as-tested price of $67,745, including destination, the M2 is one of the few cars I’ve driven in recent memory that felt worth every penny — and then some. If it were a little louder, a little rowdier and had better steering feel, the M2 might be my perfect car. Even without all those things, it’s still mighty impressive.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 BMW M2?\n\nThe BMW M2 is a rear-wheel-drive, performance-oriented coupe that seats four. It runs on a new 405-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter six-cylinder engine that works with a standard six-speed manual transmission or an optional seven-speed dual-clutch automatic. Competitors include the Porsche 718 Cayman, Audi RS 3 and Mercedes-AMG CLA 45.\n\nWhat's New on the 2019 BMW M2?\n\nThe M2's new six-cylinder engine is based on the one in the larger M3 sedan and M4 coupe but makes slightly less power. Other changes include new drive mode switches, new sport seats, bigger brakes, a new exhaust system, standard rear parking sensors, standard collision warning with low-speed automatic braking and standard lane departure warning.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 BMW M2 Are Most Important?\n\nThe M2 is the most performance-oriented version of the 2 Series, but we like that BMW still offers a manual transmission for shoppers who want one. Available wireless phone charging and Wi-Fi can help you stay connected on the go. Choosing the M Driver's Package increases the M2's top speed to 174 mph and includes a session of on-track driving from BMW.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 BMW M2?\n\nIn an era where performance BMWs have become increasingly bigger, the M2 recalls earlier M cars with its small size. Even though the focus is squarely on performance, the M2 comes with expected luxury and technology features. If the price doesn't scare you away and you're a fan of compact performance cars, the M2 is worth a test drive.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 BMW 2 Series?\n\nThe BMW 2 Series is a small, sporty luxury coupe available with a choice of three engines. Powering the base 230i is a 255-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder, while the energetic M240i is equipped with a 382-hp, turbo 3.0-liter inline-six. Both engines are coupled with an eight-speed automatic transmission and rear- or all-wheel drive. Sorry, BMW fans: If you want a manual gearbox, you’ll have to pony up for the pricey performance M2 version that has a 453-hp, twin-turbo six-cylinder, standard AWD, and a six-speed manual or eight-speed automatic transmission. The 2 Series’ competitors include the Lexus RC, Nissan Z and Toyota Supra.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 BMW 2 Series?\n\nThe 2 Series lineup enters the 2024 model year with no notable changes or updates. \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 BMW 2 Series Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n12.3-inch digital instrument panel\n8.8-inch infotainment display\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto \nNavigation\nWi-Fi hot spot\nDual-zone climate control\nTwo USB ports\nPower-adjustable front seats\nLane departure steering assist\nLane departure warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nBlind spot warning\n\nAvailable features include: \n\n10.3-inch infotainment display\nSix-speed manual transmission (M2)\nMoonroof\nInterior ambient lighting\nHeated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nHead-up instrument display\nHands-free park assist\n360-degree camera system\nWireless device charging\n16-speaker Harman Kardon audio system\nShould I Buy the 2024 BMW 2 Series?\n\nThe 2 Series is the type of BMW that enthusiast drivers love. It’s small and agile, wonderfully quick (even with its base engine) and has a firm ride that inspires confidence in spirited driving. Optional AWD provides added grip when Mother Nature doesn’t want to cooperate. The 2 Series’ small trunk and tiny backseat are expected in such a pert coupe, but we wish the exhaust note were more aggressive across the range, including the tire-smoking M2. The steering also exhibits a degree of numbness that’s surprising in such a sporty vehicle.",

      "expert_review": "The Verdict: If you like sharp, stylish, blisteringly fast and hugely satisfying sports cars, you should already be at a BMW dealership right now.\n\nVersus the competition: The M2 is very competitive, with uncompromising abilities, top-notch equipment, classic styling and a good suite of features for both track and street driving. Cars that can match the M2 on price and performance tend to be larger with bigger engines, and few match the M2’s balance and poise.\n\nBMW purists have lamented how the company has diluted its vaunted M Division’s prestige by offering M badge packages on just about all its cars and SUVs. But if you’re interested in something more than a 3 Series with a flashy appearance package, you can still get the real thing: a true M3-type vehicle with a host of performance upgrades that turn it into an honest sports car, not just a sporty car.\n\nThe latest arrival from the magicians at BMW M is the new-for-2016 M2 coupe, a diminutive two-door based on the BMW 2 Series. It’s a relatively moderate upgrade from the already-outstanding M235i with more power, more aggressive bodywork, a tighter suspension and a unique interior.\n\nAs good — and as pricey — as the M235i is, can the BMW M2 justify a higher price? And given that the larger M4 is just a little more expensive, does the M2 make the bigger 2 Series M coupe irrelevant, or a sensible splurge?\nExterior & Styling\nThe changes from M235i to M2 are subtle, but they add up to a considerably more aggressive look. Most noticeable are the bulging fenders, which have been puffed out to cover the M2’s wider wheels. It lends the car the look of a bodybuilder who’s stuffed himself into a T-shirt two sizes too small.\n\nNew front and rear bumpers with much more aggressive strakes and scoops are present, as is a fender vent along the side that emphasizes the swollen wheel arches. Out back, a “quad exhaust” with four exhaust tips pokes out underneath the car. It’s a curious affectation, given the M2 is powered by a six-cylinder engine.\nHow It Drives\nAs good as the BMW M235i is, the M2 is simply better. It sounds better, goes better, stops better and feels better. The M2 is powered by a turbo 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder engine making 365 horsepower and 343 pounds-feet of torque, which isn’t much more than the M235i, which pumps out 320 hp and 330 pounds-feet from its own less-powerful version of the same engine. According to BMW, the two cars’ journey from zero to 60 mph isn’t much different, either. The M2 and its dual-clutch transmission take 4.1 seconds, versus 4.6 seconds for the M235i — close enough to be almost even in the hands of the average driver.\n\nBut the numbers by themselves don’t tell the whole story; the rpm snarl that accompanies the M2’s acceleration, and the precise, informing feedback transmitted through the steering wheel and pedals, make the M2 feel considerably more athletic.\n\nMy car was equipped with the optional dual-clutch transmission, which snaps off shifts like gunshots — lightning quick and precise. At least, that’s how it works when you’re driving the M2 like a sports car. When you’re driving it like a commuter car, the transmission’s slow-speed behavior is a bit wonky, behaving more like an automated manual transmission than a normal automatic: It’s slow to shift from Park to Drive to Reverse or any combination thereof, and it pogos a little in meandering stop-and-go traffic. It’s not nearly as bad as dual-clutch transmissions used to be, and it’s significantly better than the one in the competing Mercedes-Benz AMG CLA45, but it takes a little getting used to. A manual transmission is still available if you feel like rowing your own gears, but it should be noted that BMW’s testing reveals the M2 with the dual-clutch transmission to be quicker.\n\nHandling performance is nothing short of fantastic. The M2 features some of the most direct and well-balanced steering I’ve experienced in recent testing, and the chassis exhibits a balance and poise that makes throwing the M2 into corners an act of joy. The M2 turns a 10-minute run to the hardware store into an hourlong outing, simply because you don’t want to stop driving. And its track performance is even better, with performance potential that will challenge even the most highly skilled drivers, yet still be accessible to novices.\n\nA lot of credit for how well it handles goes to the M2’s wider track, which is a whopping 2.3 inches wider than the M235i up front and 1.7 inches wider in the back. Unsprung mass has also been greatly reduced on the M2, using aluminum for the suspension, axles, anti-roll bars and other components.\n\nThe tires are bigger, too: There are 265 series on the M2’s rear versus 245 series on the M235i, and they’re 19-inch forged lightweight units versus 18-inchers on the M235i. About the only advantage the M235i has going for it in this matchup is the availability of all-wheel drive; the M2 is rear-wheel drive only. The M2 feels tighter and nimbler than the bigger M4, and its chassis dynamics are far better than those of the front-wheel-drive Mercedes-Benz AMG CLA45.\n\nYet despite the big alloy wheels, thin rubber and tighter M-specific suspension tuning, the M2 rides superbly. BMW dialed in the ride-versus-handling tuning exactly right, providing a compliant and comfortable (albeit still firm) ride without sacrificing any handling prowess. Broken pavement, frost heaves, expansion grates — not a problem for the M2. You feel the imperfections in the pavement, but you’re never perturbed by them. Stopping the M2 happens without any drama thanks to massive brakes both front and rear, though when they’re cold they squeal a bit due to an aggressive pad compound.\n\nAmazingly, all this performance doesn’t come with much of a fuel economy penalty. The M2 with a manual transmission is EPA-rated 18/26/21 mpg city/highway/combined, while the automatic M2 is rated 20/27/23 mpg. Even my week of aggressive driving — frequently employing Sport mode, which keeps the car in a lower gear — netted 22 mpg on average. That isn’t quite as good as the Mercedes-Benz AMG CLA45, which gets 23/31/26 mpg from its smaller, turbocharged four-cylinder engine. The BMW’s inline-six, however, has a much broader, more usable torque curve than the Benz’s high-strung, heavily boosted engine.\nInterior\nThe BMW M2’s cockpit gets some unique treatment versus the M235i. It’s available only in dark gray but has dramatic blue stitching in the seats, doors, dash and steering wheel that looks terrific. Materials quality is top-notch, including carbon fiber dashboard trim that looks like real carbon fiber, not the fake stuff so many automakers try to pass off as the real thing.\n\nThe seating position is good. Some have noted that the pedal placement, seat orientation and steering wheel offset have the driver canted slightly inward, toward the vehicle centerline, but it’s so minor most people aren’t likely to notice it at all. I certainly didn’t.\n\nThere’s plenty of headroom thanks to a roof that’s taller than the M4’s. Width isn’t a problem, either, thanks to a multiadjustable seat. It’s snug in there, but in the way an old leather glove is snug — comfortable and meant to hold you in place during spirited activities.\n\nThe backseat is snug, too, but less comfortably. The M2 can accommodate a total of three people fairly easily if the front passenger seat is moved forward. Sitting behind the driver is impossible given a complete lack of backseat legroom if the driver is actually occupying the driver’s seat.\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe interior isn’t perfect, and my biggest gripe comes with the gauges. There are two round dials facing the driver that are rendered in light gray numbers and hash marks over an only slightly darker gray face. They’re hooded in a binnacle that puts them in perpetual shadow, so they’re extremely difficult to see on bright, sunny days. Even turning on the headlights doesn’t illuminate them if the sensors detect it’s sunny out. Their orange glow is fine at night, but they’re a challenge to read otherwise.\n\nAside from that, the M2’s interior is standard BMW stuff; everything is easy to reach and easy to use. There’s a wide multimedia screen sitting atop the dash that can be devoted either fully to one function or split into two, for greater information display. The screen is controlled through a multifunction knob and buttons low on the center console, and it uses the common BMW menu system. It takes a little familiarization to learn where everything is, but once you’ve done that it’s quick and easy to use. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are not available.\nCargo & Storage\nThe M2’s coupe body style means it doesn’t have quite the same space as a hatchback would, but it can carry a decent amount of stuff in its trunk for such a small car. Believe it or not, the 13.8 cubic feet of volume in the M2’s trunk is larger than the 11.0 cubic feet you’d get in the larger, longer M4. It’s also roomier than the 13.1 cubic feet available in the CLA45 AMG and much bigger than the paltry 10.1 cubic feet available in the Lexus RC F. The rear seats fold down in a 40-20-40 split to create more room.\nSafety\nThe BMW M2 has not been crash-tested by either the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.\n\nMost of the electronic safety systems on the M2 are optional, as is common with German luxury cars. You get standard rain-sensing windshield wipers, keyless entry and automatic high beams, but you have to pay extra for a few other things, including a backup camera and parking sensors, as well as Active Driving Assistant, which includes lane departure warning and forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking. See all the M2’s standard equipment here.\nValue in Its Class\nThe 2016 BMW M2 feels like a more extreme version of the M235i (which will become the M240i for 2017 thanks to an engine update) with a more track-oriented skew to it — and it’s priced accordingly higher.\n\nThe BMW M2 base price starts at $52,695 including destination fee. There aren’t a lot of options available, but the one I drove featured Long Beach Blue Metallic paint for $550 and the $1,250 Executive Package, which includes a heated steering wheel, the backup camera, rear parking sonar, automatic high-beams and the Active Driving Assistant safety tech. Add the dual-clutch automatic transmission for $2,900, and we’ve brought the total as-tested to $57,395.\n\nCompetition in this segment isn’t plentiful, unless you broaden your definition of what might compete with the M2. The closest contender may be the Mercedes-Benz AMG CLA45, which Mercedes calls a coupe but everyone else in the world calls a sedan. It’s in the same class as the M2 and is priced similarly, plus it features a similarly powerful turbocharged engine (albeit minus two cylinders). That car, however, is available only with a dual-clutch automatic; no manual can be had.\n\nA more unconventional choice might be the Ford Shelby GT350, a top-of-the-line Mustang that competes with the M2 on price and mission. Like the M2, the Shelby is a track star made for the street. Its engine is significantly more powerful than the M2’s, but its greater curb weight means it’s not any quicker.\n\nFor a bit more money, you can get the Lexus RC F, a V-8-powered, rear-wheel-drive 2+2 coupe with a lot more power than the M2 but surprisingly less interior room. It’s also significantly heavier than the BMW M2, which puts a damper on its handling abilities, as well. Compare the M2 with its competitors here.\n\nThere are two other choices that should also be considered against the M2: BMW’s own M235i and M4. (Compare these models here). The M235i is less expensive, starting at $45,145 or $47,145 for an all-wheel-drive model. It’s not as powerful as the M2, and it doesn’t have that car’s slick aluminum suspension bits or trick active rear differential. If street duty is more your speed, though, it might be a better daily driver. Plus, you can get it as a convertible.\n\nThe BMW M4 is much more expensive than the BMW M2 — $14,000 more expensive — and comes with more power from its twin-turbocharged, 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder engine. It’s a little longer than the M2 but not much heavier, and its performance advantage isn’t significant enough to justify spending that much more. The BMW M2 hits the sweet spot of daily comfort combined with track-star moves — at a price that’s actually attainable.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in September 2016 for the brand-new 2016 M2. Little has changed for 2017, but to see a side-by-side comparison of the two model years, click here.\n\nBMW purists have lamented how the company has diluted its vaunted M Division’s prestige by offering M badge packages on just about all its cars and SUVs. But if you’re interested in something more than a 3 Series with a flashy appearance package, you can still get the real thing: a true M vehicle with a host of performance upgrades that turn it into an honest sports car, not just a sporty car.\n\nThe latest arrival from the magicians at BMW M is the new-for-2016 M2 coupe, a diminutive two-door based on the BMW 2 Series. It’s a relatively moderate upgrade from the already-outstanding M235i with more power, more aggressive bodywork, a tighter suspension and a unique interior. \n\nAs good — and as pricey — as the M235i is, can the M2 justify a higher price? And given that the larger M4 is just a little more expensive, does the M2 make the bigger coupe irrelevant, or a sensible splurge?\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nThe changes from M235i to M2 are subtle, but they add up to a considerably more aggressive look. Most noticeable are the bulging fenders, which have been puffed out to cover the M2’s wider wheels. It lends the car the look of a bodybuilder who’s stuffed himself into a T-shirt two sizes too small. \n\nNew front and rear bumpers with much more aggressive strakes and scoops are present, as is a fender vent along the side that emphasizes the swollen wheel arches. Out back, a “quad exhaust” with four exhaust tips pokes out underneath the car. It’s a curious affectation, given the M2 is powered by a six-cylinder engine.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nAs good as the BMW M235i is, the M2 is simply better. It sounds better, goes better, stops better and feels better. The M2 is powered by a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder engine making 365 horsepower and 343 pounds-feet of torque, which isn’t much more than the M235i, which pumps out 320 hp and 330 pounds-feet from its own less-powerful version of the same engine. According to BMW, the two cars’ journey from zero to 60 mph isn’t much different, either. The M2 and its dual-clutch transmission take 4.1 seconds, versus 4.6 seconds for the M235i — close enough to be almost even in the hands of the average driver. \n\nBut the numbers by themselves don’t tell the whole story; the snarl that accompanies the M2’s acceleration, and the precise, informing feedback transmitted through the steering wheel and pedals, make the M2 feel considerably more athletic. \n\nMy car was equipped with the optional dual-clutch transmission, which snaps off shifts like gunshots — lightning quick and precise. At least, that’s how it works when you’re driving the M2 like a sports car. When you’re driving it like a commuter car, the transmission’s slow-speed behavior is a bit wonky, behaving more like an automated manual transmission than a normal automatic: It’s slow to shift from Park to Drive to Reverse or any combination thereof, and it pogos a little in meandering stop-and-go traffic. It’s not nearly as bad as dual-clutch transmissions used to be, and it’s significantly better than the one in the competing Mercedes-Benz AMG CLA45, but it takes a little getting used to. A manual transmission is still available if you feel like rowing your own gears, but it should be noted that BMW’s testing reveals the M2 with the dual-clutch transmission to be quicker.\n\nHandling performance is nothing short of fantastic. The M2 features some of the most direct and well-balanced steering I’ve experienced in recent testing, and the chassis exhibits a balance and poise that makes throwing the M2 into corners an act of joy. The M2 turns a 10-minute run to the hardware store into an hourlong outing, simply because you don’t want to stop driving. And its track performance is even better, with performance potential that will challenge even the most highly skilled drivers, yet still be accessible to novices.\n\nA lot of credit for how well it handles goes to the M2’s wider track, which is a whopping 2.3 inches wider than the M235i up front and 1.7 inches wider in the back. Unsprung mass has also been greatly reduced on the M2, using aluminum for the suspension, axles, anti-roll bars and other components. \n\nThe tires are bigger, too: There are 265 series on the M2’s rear versus 245 series on the M235i, and they’re 19-inch forged lightweight units versus 18-inchers on the M235i. About the only advantage the M235i has going for it in this matchup is the availability of all-wheel drive; the M2 is rear-wheel drive only. The M2 feels tighter and nimbler than the bigger M4, and its chassis dynamics are far better than those of the front-wheel-drive Mercedes-Benz AMG CLA45. \n\nYet despite the big wheels, thin rubber and tighter suspension tuning, the M2 rides superbly. BMW dialed in the ride-versus-handling tuning exactly right, providing a compliant and comfortable (albeit still firm) ride without sacrificing any handling prowess. Broken pavement, frost heaves, expansion grates — not a problem for the M2. You feel the imperfections in the pavement, but you’re never perturbed by them. Stopping the M2 happens without any drama thanks to massive brakes both front and rear, though when they’re cold they squeal a bit due to an aggressive pad compound.\n\nAmazingly, all this performance doesn’t come with much of a fuel economy penalty. The M2 with a manual transmission is EPA-rated 18/26/21 mpg city/highway/combined, while the automatic M2 is rated 20/27/23 mpg. Even my week of aggressive driving — frequently employing Sport mode, which keeps the car in a lower gear — netted 22 mpg on average. That isn’t quite as good as the Mercedes-Benz AMG CLA45, which gets 23/31/26 mpg from its smaller, turbocharged four-cylinder engine. The BMW’s inline-six, however, has a much broader, more usable torque curve than the Benz’s high-strung, heavily boosted engine.\n\nInterior\n\nThe M2’s cockpit gets some unique treatment versus the M235i. It’s available only in dark gray but has dramatic blue stitching in the seats, doors, dash and steering wheel that looks terrific. Materials quality is top-notch, including carbon fiber dashboard trim that looks like real carbon fiber, not the fake stuff so many automakers try to pass off as the real thing. \n\nThe seating position is good. Some have noted that the pedal placement, seat orientation and steering wheel offset have the driver canted slightly inward, toward the vehicle centerline, but it’s so minor most people aren’t likely to notice it at all. I certainly didn’t. \n\nThere’s plenty of headroom thanks to a roof that’s taller than the M4’s. Width isn’t a problem, either, thanks to a multiadjustable seat. It’s snug in there, but in the way an old leather glove is snug — comfortable and meant to hold you in place during spirited activities. \n\nThe backseat is snug, too, but less comfortably. The M2 can accommodate a total of three people fairly easily if the front passenger seat is moved forward. Sitting behind the driver is impossible given a complete lack of backseat legroom if the driver is actually occupying the driver’s seat.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nThe interior isn’t perfect, and my biggest gripe comes with the gauges. There are two round dials facing the driver that are rendered in light gray numbers and hash marks over an only slightly darker gray face. They’re hooded in a binnacle that puts them in perpetual shadow, so they’re extremely difficult to see on bright, sunny days. Even turning on the headlights doesn’t illuminate them if the sensors detect it’s sunny out. Their orange glow is fine at night, but they’re a challenge to read otherwise. \n\nAside from that, the M2’s interior is standard BMW stuff; everything is easy to reach and easy to use. There’s a wide multimedia screen sitting atop the dash that can be devoted either fully to one function or split into two, for greater information display. The screen is controlled through a multifunction knob and buttons low on the center console, and it uses the common BMW menu system. It takes a little familiarization to learn where everything is, but once you’ve done that it’s quick and easy to use. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are not available.\n\nCargo & Storage\n\nThe M2’s coupe body style means it doesn’t have quite the same space as a hatchback would, but it can carry a decent amount of stuff in its trunk for such a small car. Believe it or not, the 13.8 cubic feet of volume in the M2’s trunk is larger than the 11.0 cubic feet you’d get in the larger, longer M4. It’s also roomier than the 13.1 cubic feet available in the CLA45 AMG and much bigger than the paltry 10.1 cubic feet available in the Lexus RC F. The rear seats fold down in a 40-20-40 split to create more room.\n\nSafety\n\nThe BMW M2 has not been crash-tested by either the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.\n\nMost of the electronic safety systems on the M2 are optional, as is common with German luxury cars. You get standard rain-sensing windshield wipers, keyless entry and automatic high beams, but you have to pay extra for a few other things, including a backup camera and parking sensors, as well as Active Driving Assistant, which includes lane departure warning and forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking. See all the M2’s standard equipment here.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nThe 2016 BMW M2 feels like a more extreme version of the M235i (which will become the M240i for 2017 thanks to an engine update) with a more track-oriented skew to it — and it’s priced accordingly higher. \n\nThe M2 starts at $52,695 including destination fee. There aren’t a lot of options available, but the one I drove featured Long Beach Blue Metallic paint for $550 and the $1,250 Executive Package, which includes a heated steering wheel, the backup camera, rear parking sonar, automatic high-beams and the Active Driving Assistant safety tech. Add the dual-clutch automatic transmission for $2,900, and we’ve brought the total as-tested to $57,395. \n\nCompetition in this segment isn’t plentiful, unless you broaden your definition of what might compete with the M2. The closest contender may be the Mercedes-Benz AMG CLA45, which Mercedes calls a coupe but everyone else in the world calls a sedan. It’s in the same class as the M2 and is priced similarly, plus it features a similarly powerful turbocharged engine (albeit minus two cylinders). That car, however, is available only with a dual-clutch automatic; no manual can be had. \n\nA more unconventional choice might be the Ford Shelby GT350, a top-of-the-line Mustang that competes with the M2 on price and mission. Like the M2, the Shelby is a track star made for the street. Its engine is significantly more powerful than the M2’s, but its greater curb weight means it’s not any quicker. \n\nFor a bit more money, you can get the Lexus RC F, a V-8-powered, rear-wheel-drive 2+2 coupe with a lot more power than the M2 but surprisingly less interior room. It’s also significantly heavier than the M2, which puts a damper on its handling abilities, as well. Compare the M2 with its competitors here. \n\nThere are two other choices that should also be considered against the M2: BMW’s own M235i and M4. (Compare these models here). The M235i is less expensive, starting at $45,145 or $47,145 for an all-wheel-drive model. It’s not as powerful as the M2, and it doesn’t have that car’s slick aluminum suspension bits or trick active rear differential. If street duty is more your speed, though, it might be a better daily driver. Plus, you can get it as a convertible. \n\nThe BMW M4 is much more expensive than the M2 — $14,000 more expensive — and comes with more power from its twin-turbocharged, 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder engine. It’s a little longer than the M2 but not much heavier, and its performance advantage isn’t significant enough to justify spending that much more. The M2 hits the sweet spot of daily comfort combined with track-star moves — at a price that’s actually attainable.",

      "expert_review": "Back in 2019, BMW dropped its first M2 CS, a compact coupe packing the engine from the larger M4 Competition. Built in a one-year run of 2,200 units, the 2020 CS was perhaps considered the modern BMW M car, the sort of hit that both brands and buyers want more of. Now, BMW has introduced the 2026 M2 CS, which still packs the engine from the larger M4 Competition — only this time, it’s the slightly more powerful engine from the all-wheel-drive M4 Competition xDrive.\n\nRelated: 2023 BMW M2 Review: Mmm Mmm Good (and Nearly Great)\n\nWhat Performance Updates Does the 2026 M2 CS Have?\n\nThe 2026 M2 CS’s engine really just uses the engine tune from that M4, since both the M2 and the M4 use variations of the same turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder and BMW attributes the power increase over the standard M2 to “engine management.” Still, management changes result in 523 horsepower and 479 pounds-feet of torque directed exclusively to the rear wheels. Those are improvements of 50 hp and 36 pounds-feet compared to the regular M2 when it’s equipped with the optional automatic transmission. (Torque is limited to 406 pounds-feet with the manual.) Every 2026 M2 CS will have the eight-speed automatic.\n\nBMW says the CS will accelerate from 0-60 mph in 3.7 seconds — 0.2 second quicker than the standard M2 — and hit a top speed of 188 mph when equipped with the M Driver’s Package, 11 mph faster than the regular M2.\n\nMass and Control\n\nPower is only half of the M2 CS formula, however. The CS is also lighter than the regular M2, shaving 97 pounds through liberal use of carbon fiber for the roof, trunk lid, exclusive rear diffuser and interior trim. Stiffer engine mounts, a stance lowered by 0.2 inch, and unique tuning for the springs, adaptive dampers, steering and differential promise to sharpen the M2’s responses.\n\nMuch of the rest of the CS’s content is available on the regular M2 as options. That includes the heated carbon-fiber bucket seats with accommodations for multipoint harnesses and removable head restraints for helmet clearance, as well as the upgraded brakes with red calipers (carbon ceramics are an $8,500 option) and heated synthetic suede steering wheel. The matte-bronze wheels, measuring 19 inches up front and 20 in the rear, are exclusive to the CS, and BMW will offer two tiers of higher-performance track tires at no additional cost.\n\nRelease Date and Pricing\n\nThe 2026 BMW M2 CS will go on sale late this summer. BMW says it will be produced in limited numbers but has given no indication of how limited. Pricing starts at $99,775 (including the $1,175 destination charge), which is more than $30,000 over a base 2025 M2 but only around $16,000 more than an equivalently optioned car. Is that too much to ask for a sharper version of the best current M car — and likely one of the last with an internal-combustion engine? BMW will almost certainly find enough buyers who don’t think so.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2025 BMW M2 Gets More Power, $66,075 Base Price\nIs the 2023 BMW M2 a Good Car? 5 Pros and 4 Cons\n2025 BMW 2 Series Coupe Gets Curved Display and Digital Controls, Starts at $40,375\nResearch the BMW M2\nFind Your Next Car\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 BMW M2?\n\nThe BMW M2 is a rear-wheel-drive, performance-oriented coupe that seats four. It runs on a 405-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter six-cylinder engine that works with a standard six-speed manual transmission or an optional seven-speed dual-clutch automatic. Competitors include the Porsche 718 Cayman, Audi RS 3 and Mercedes-AMG CLA 45.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 BMW M2?\n\nThere are no changes this year.\n\nWhat Features in the 2020 BMW M2 Are Most Important?\n\nThe M2 is the most performance-oriented version of the 2 Series, and we like that BMW still offers a manual transmission for shoppers who want one. Available wireless phone charging and Wi-Fi can help you stay connected on the go. Forward collision warning with low-speed automatic braking and lane departure warning are standard. Adding the M Driver’s Package increases the M2’s top speed to 174 mph and includes a session of on-track driving from BMW.\n\nShould I Buy the 2020 BMW M2?\n\nIn an era where performance BMWs have become increasingly bigger, the M2’s small size recalls earlier M cars. Even though the focus is squarely on performance, the M2 comes with expected luxury and technology features. If the price doesn’t scare you away, and you’re a fan of compact performance cars, the M2 is worth a test drive.",
