      "expert_review": "The BMW 740iL is not only a super luxury sedan, it’s probably as close as you’ll get in this lifetime to having your own personal version of R2D2, the cute little robot in Star Wars. There are all kinds of unexpected gadgets on the 7-series that beep, boop and chirp when you’re about to get into trouble or when you’re arming the security system.\n\nFor a base price of $62,490, you not only get one of the most sophisticated and technology-laden cars in the world, you also get neat extras like rear footrests, a flashlight in the glove compartment, a first-aid kit in the rear storage console and a tool kit in the trunk.\n\nCome to think of it, that’s even more than Luke Skywalker and C3PO got with their little companion.\n\nShe: I’ve always admired garbage trucks that beep when the driver backs up. It’s a primitive warning system, but a good idea, especially if you’re behind one. Leave it to BMW to take that idea about 10 steps further, with its optional $900 parking distance control on the 740iL. Ultrasonic sensors in both bumpers warn you of the distance between your car and other objects, and makes parking in tight spaces easier. The sensors trigger a beeping sounding that becomes constant if you’re less than 12 inches from that fire hydrant or kid on a bike. What a sensible feature!\n\nHe: BMW offers an assortment of interesting options on the 740iL, but the basic model with all its standard equipment is pretty impressive, too. For an extra $1,000, you can get a cold-weather package that includes heated front seats, a headlamp-cleaning system and a ski sack. Self-leveling rear suspension – a good idea if you’re frequently carrying heavy loads in the trunk – costs another $1,100, and a fancy power sunshade for the rear window is $740. The one kind of chintzy touch is that you have to pay extra for a CD player, which should be standard on a $60,000 automobile.\n\nShe: I’m surprised you didn’t put me down for liking the parking distance control feature.\n\nHe: I’m more amused by the way you always seem to back into these test drives.\n\nShe: OK, so I’m supposed to be impressed by the big V-8 engine and the 282 horsepower. But I’m more impressed by things that get me out of my blue-collar background. No need for tacky paper sunshades in this vehicle. You can leave the car in a sunny parking lot and preset the automatic ventilation system to cool down the interior 30 minutes before you return. No more thighs sticking to the gathered-leather upholstery on the extra-wide orthopedic seats when you’re wearing shorts. What a relief.\n\nHe: Hey, I’m relieved to drive a car that HAS extra-wide seats. I took our 15-year-old down to a vintage guitar show in Columbus, Ohio, one weekend – about a 400-mile roundtrip from Detroit – and the seats were superb. I would have really suffered without the adjustable power lumbar controls, which allow you to position some extra cushioning for your lower back with pinpoint precision. Whi ch is not to demean the BMW’s suspension system, which is one of the best in the class in terms of ride comfort and handling.\n\nShe: You forget the acid test I gave the suspension on the 740iL. We were late for Gary and Tina’s wedding, and I was forced to do my nails in the car on the way to the reception. And, no, I wasn’t driving at the time. But I was using Revlon’s Rum Raisin shade – very dark, which leaves no room for errors. It also helped that you can slide the center armrest back and forth. The BMW soaked up potholes and craters, and I wound up with perfect nails. What a testimonial! Do you think they’ll put me and my manicure kit in a commercial?\n\nHe: Only if the Germans are really desperate. You can thank the twin-tube gas-pressurized shocks, stabilizer bars and multi-link rear layout for smoothing out the local freeways and side streets. But it’s only when you get out on some twisty country roads that you can really appreciate the speed-sensitive variable-assist r steering, which is surprisingly quick and responsive in such a large car. BMW doesn’t offer the short-wheelbase 7-series sedan any more in the U.S., so the V-8 model now rides on the longer 120.9-inch wheelbase, which improves the ride quality, at the cost of some agility.\n\nShe: Is that why I kept riding up over curbs when I was making turns? That’s my biggest complaint about the BMW – it’s too Hindenberg-like. The 740iL is more than two feet longer than the 3-series, which is more my speed. But I suppose if you’re shopping in this stratosphere, you’ll feel like you’re getting a lot of car for the money.\n\nHe: One of the fringe benefits on the ’96 model is the new engine. BMW has hiked the displacement on the V-8 to 4.4 liters. Horsepower stays the same, but peak torque has been increased to 310 pounds-feet, and it kicks in at lower RPM. The V-8 is mated with an exceptionally smooth five-speed automatic, and despite the car’s 4288-pound curb weight, the 740iL fairly leaps from zero to 60 in just over 7 seconds. Believe me, this is just about all the power you’ll ever need for passing or merging into brisk freeway traffic. Compared with the eight, the 12-cylinder engine in the $90,000 750iL is almost overkill.\n\nShe: There does seem to be a lot of overkill even in the 740iL. We don’t have enough room to detail all the incredible features, from the security system with the interior motion detector to the adaptive transmission control that takes your personal driving style into account and automatically adjusts itself to sport, economy or winter mode. The only area where you don’t get overkill is styling. There’s nothing on the exterior that shouts: “This is a $60,000-plus vehicle.”\n\nHe: Let’s just say the 740iL maintains the BMW family heritage, from its trademark twin-kidney grilles to its slightly rounded greenhouse and taut flanks. I think it looks like a million bucks.\n\n1996 BMW 740iL\n\nType: Front-engine, rear-wheel drive, five-passenger luxury sedan.\n\nPrice: Base, $62,490; as tested, $65,160 (inc. $570 destination charge).\n\nWhat’s new for ’96: Long-wheelbase models only, new 4.4-liter V-8, all-season traction control now standard, revised security system.\n\nStandard equipment: Variable-assist power steering, four-wheel power disc brakes, all-season radial tires on cast-alloy wheels, intermittent wipers, dual heated power mirrors, auto-dimming rear-view mirror, power tilt/telescope steering wheel, 14-way power front seats with 4-way power adjustable lumbar support, memory system for driver’s seat and seat-belt height, steering wheel and outside mirrors, multi-information display and onboard computer, leather seats and door inserts, walnut trim and shift knob, one-touch up/down power windows, automatic climate system with separate left/right controls, activated charcoal microfilter, automatic ventilation system, power moonroof with sliding interior shade, AM-FM stereo cassette with 200- watt amplifier and 10 speakers, steering-wheel controls for cruise, audio, telephone and air recirculation, dual front and rear cupholders, rear center armrest with storage compartment, rear defroster, toolkit in trunk.\n\nSafety features: Dual front air bags, antilock brakes, all-season traction control, remote keyless entry/security system with panic feature, automatic height adjustment for front seat belts, automatic locking seat-belt retractors, impact sensor (unlocks doors, switches on interior lights and hazard flashers after serious accident).\n\nOptions on test vehicle: Parking distance control ($900), comfort seats ($1,200).\n\nEPA fuel economy: 17 mpg city/24 mpg highway.\n\nEngine: 4.4-liter V-8; 282-hp at 5700 rpm; 310 lb-ft torque at 3900 rpm.\n\nTransmission: Five-speed automatic.\n\nCompetitors: Mercedes-Benz S420, Jaguar XJ6, Infiniti Q45, Lexus LS400.\n\nSpecifications: Wheelbase, 120.9 inches; overall length, 201.7 inches; curb weight, 28p unds; legroom, 41.9 inches front/41.9 inches rear; headroom, 37.7 inches front/37.9 inches rear; shoulder room, 58.4 inches front/58.4 inches rear.\n\n12-month insurance cost, according to AAA Michigan*: $2,040.\n\nRates based on an average family of four from the Livonia area whose primary driver is aged 40 with no tickets who drives 3-10 miles each way to work.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nBehold the redesigned sixth-generation 7 Series, a car packed with as much technology as a Pixar studio. Any sedan that takes on the Mercedes-Benz S-Class, Audi A8/S8, Jaguar XJ and Lexus LS had better be a tour de force of technology and capability, and BMW’s 7 Series is just that.\n\nLike BMW’s i3 electric car and i8 exotic, the new 7 Series will sport carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic in the passenger compartment that helps reduce its overall weight by about 190 pounds, plus new features like gesture recognition and a self-parking system that even handles the gas and brakes.\nExterior\nThe sedan wears perhaps the largest version of BMW’s familiar twin-kidney grille, now with active shutters to help aerodynamics. It extends deep into the front bumper, with LED headlights emerging directly from the sides. The bumpers have a single lower expanse, which an M Sport Package trades for three separate openings. The M Sport also adds darkened rear-bumper effects.\n\nEighteen-inch alloy wheels are standard, but optional rims go all the way to 21 inches. Though it’s an inch longer than last year’s long-wheelbase car, the 7 Series’ trunk appears shorter and doesn’t jut as noticeably outward. The tail itself has familiar elements, with a sleeker take on the last 7’s horizontal taillights and width-spanning silver trim.\nInterior\nLike other newish BMWs, the 7 Series now has a new center display that perches on the dash rather than within a dash hump. The gauges also are a configurable display, measuring 12.3 inches. Most controls have a silver finish, but many functions along the center stack are now touch-sensitive, which we’ve criticized across the industry. It’s an unfortunate development since German automakers were a reliable holdout for physical knobs and keys.\n\nBMW’s iDrive controller sits to the right of the gearshift, but it’s been augmented by a touch-screen interface for the center display itself — a rarity among German luxury cars. New gesture recognition allows you to accept a phone call, adjust the stereo volume and more by aiming hand gestures toward the multimedia system. (Why pressing a button on the steering wheel was so difficult, we don’t know.)\n\nShoppers can choose between various wood and aluminum trim plus three grades of leather. BMW claims class-leading backseat legroom, and typical of a full-size luxury sedan, rear amenities are plentiful. A panoramic moonroof and quad-zone automatic climate control are standard; outboard passengers can get optional heated armrests. Backseat passengers can get front-seat-mounted multimedia screens, powered outboard seats and a flow-through center console with tray tables and a removable 7-inch tablet. The tablet has driving information, various seat controls and Internet connectivity through the 7 Series’ in-car Wi-Fi.\n\nWireless smartphone charging is standard. Optional premium audio comes in the form of a Bowers & Wilkins Diamond surround-sound system. If you want some smell with that sound, an optional air-fragrance package can ionize the air and emit one of eight scents.\nUnder the Hood\nThe 740i has a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder engine with 320 horsepower. The 750i, meanwhile, gets a twin-turbo 4.4-liter V-8 that’s good for 445 hp. Both engines work through an eight-speed automatic transmission.\n\nVarious driving modes span the gamut from sportiness to fuel efficiency. Helping the latter cause are regenerative braking and idle-stop features. The driving modes also alter the standard adaptive air suspension.\n\nBMW’s optional Active Comfort Drive incorporates active stabilizer bars that adjust in real time to mitigate body roll, plus a navigation-linked Road Preview function that preps the suspension for upcoming situations. On all-wheel-drive (xDrive) models, an optional active steering system can steer the rear wheels slightly to help maneuverability.\n\nSometime next year, BMW will also offer a 740e xDrive plug-in hybrid, which combines a turbo four-cylinder with an electric motor. The motor draws power off a rechargeable lithium-ion battery, with a maximum all-electric range of 23 miles (EPA-certified range still pending). BMW says it will announce whether the 740e will be a 2016 or 2017 model closer to its launch.\nSafety\nBMW’s optional Parking Assistant can pull the car into a parallel or perpendicular parking spot using low-speed acceleration and braking (most self-parking systems only manage the steering). Automatic braking now works when the car is in Reverse and detects an object in its path. Driverless remote-controlled parking via BMW’s Display Key won’t be available at launch in U.S. models, BMW says. There’s no word on when (or if) the feature will arrive.\n\nSafety options include forward collision warning with pedestrian detection and automatic braking, plus lane departure and blind spot warning systems. Pile on all the driving-assistance packages and the 7 Series can maintain speed behind the car ahead all the way down to a full stop, as well as steer itself to follow the vehicle ahead, stay in its lane, or detect and avoid adjacent traffic during a lane change. (BMW says the steering assistant, like other such systems, still requires you to keep a hand on the wheel.)",

      "expert_review": "Competes with: Mercedes-Benz S-Class, Audi A8, Lexus LS\n\nLooks like: Current 7 Series with updated front and rear\n\nPowertrains: 375-horsepower, twin-turbo 3.0-liter six-cylinder, rear-wheel drive (740i); 536-hp, twin-turbo 4.4-liter V-8, all-wheel drive (760i xDrive); 101.7-kilowatt-hour battery pack, 536-hp dual-motor AWD (i7 xDrive60); eight-speed automatic transmission (740i, 760i xDrive)\n\nHits dealerships: Late 2022\n\nClosely following a refresh for its largest SUV, the X7, BMW has revealed a redesigned version of its lower-riding stablemate — the 2023 7 Series sedan. The full-size sedan gets exterior tweaks to its front and rear, a minimalistic interior with new materials and tech options, and its first-ever all-electric model.\n\nRelated: 2023 BMW X7 Gains Mild-Hybrid Power, New Look and Higher Price\n\nThe battery-powered i7 xDrive60 will join the smaller i4 sedan and iX SUV as the brand’s third fully electric model. Meanwhile, the gas-powered 740i and performance-leaning 760i xDrive models return with power and efficiency improvements along with significant price bumps over the outgoing 2022 variants.\n\nExterior: Crystal-Clear Lighting\n\nThe most notable changes to the seventh-generation 7 Series are a new front and rear end, which feature updated head- and taillights. In front, BMW splits the current sedan’s lighting into two units: the upper section includes slim daytime running lamps and turn indicators, and LED headlights are tucked below. Optional crystal headlights and daytime running lights are newly available. To highlight the vehicle’s supersized signature kidney grille, an illuminated version is added as an option for 2023. The redesigned rear end features a lowered license plate mount and wears new L-shaped taillights.\n\nThe 7 Series keeps the outgoing model’s recognizable profile but grows larger. The new model is approximately 5 inches longer, 2 inches wider and 2 inches taller. The wheelbase is also slightly longer.\n\nThere are three new metallic paint colors to choose from: Dark Graphite, Sparkling Copper and Space Silver. For the first time, a two-tone paint finish is available with two color choices for the top section above the vehicle’s shoulder line and five options for the lower section.\n\nAn M Sport Package with M-specific front and side design cues and 20- or 21-inch M wheels is now standard on the 740i and 760i xDrive; it can be added to the i7 xDrive60 at no cost. An M Sport Professional Package adds M Sport brakes and a specific trim for the grille.\n\nNew Interior Unclutters the Cockpit\n\nThe 7 Series sees many changes inside, too, including new materials for the seating and trim; the addition of new standard comfort seats and optional Executive Lounge seats; and a more minimalistic cockpit that removes many of the physical controls found in the outgoing model. BMW’s curved display, which has appeared in new models like the refreshed X7, houses a 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster and a 14.9-inch center touchscreen as part of a single unit.\n\nA new interaction bar serves as both a design and operational control function. Stretching across the instrument panel and continuing into the door panel, the bar encompasses touch controls for climate and hazard lights. It also features ambient lighting and BMW’s Intelligent Personal Assistant to signal events, like incoming phone calls. Other notable changes for the driver include a new flat-bottom steering wheel and a newly designed push-button gear selector.\n\nThe 7 Series features multi-contour heated front seats with standard ventilation for the 760i xDrive and i7 xDrive60; ventilation is optional for the 740i. A massage function with nine settings can be added as an option across all trims. The ventilation and massage functions can also be added to the rear seats as an option. Touch control panels built into the door trims allow passengers to adjust the seat settings. The Executive Lounge option essentially turns the back seats into lounge chairs with a reclining function and leg rest for the seat behind the front passenger.\n\nA Second-Row Movie Theater\n2023 BMW 7 Series | Manufacturer image\n\nThe Executive Lounge seats combined with BMW’s 31.3-inch theater screen, Amazon Fire TV and a surround sound system mimic the movie theater experience. The large horizontal screen allows backseat occupants to stream videos, play games or listen to music. A larger panoramic roof is standard across all models and features new LED light threads that mirror the pattern of the seating surfaces.\n\nAvailable materials for the seats range from a sustainable leatherette in the 740i to standard Merino leather in the 760i xDrive and i7 xDrive60. Also available is a new trim option that blends Merino leather and cashmere wool in contrasting shades.\n\nPowertrains and Performance\n2023 BMW 7 Series | Manufacturer image\n\nAccording to the automaker, the 740i and 760i xDrive powertrains benefit from a new mild-hybrid system for increased efficiency, torque and horsepower output. RWD is standard for the 740i, and the 760i xDrive comes standard with AWD. Both vehicles use an eight-speed automatic transmission. The all-electric i7 xDrive60, which replaces the 745e xDrive plug-in hybrid, comes standard with AWD. BMW says additional performance and ride comfort improvements come from chassis updates, front and rear suspension upgrades and a new electric power-steering system.\n\n740i\n\nThe base 740i model is powered by a twin-turbo 3.0-liter inline-six, which now makes 375 hp — a 40-hp increase from the outgoing model’s inline-six. The 383 pounds-feet of torque can briefly climb to a maximum of 398 pounds-feet with help from the new 48-volt mild-hybrid system. BMW estimates the 740i’s 0-60 mph time at 5 seconds.\n\n760i xDrive\n\nBMW says the higher-performance 760i xDrive model’s twin-turbo 4.4-liter V-8 gets increased responsiveness and greater efficiency for 2023. The V-8 makes 536 hp — up from 523 in the outgoing model — and 553 pounds-feet of torque. The 760i xDrive does 0-60 in 4.2 seconds, according to BMW.\n\ni7 xDrive60: The First All-Electric 7 Series\n\n2023 BMW 7 Series | Manufacturer image\n\nThe biggest news for the 7 Series is the introduction of the i7 xDrive60. The electric vehicle is powered by dual electric motors and a 101.7-kWh battery pack for 536 hp and 549 pounds-feet of torque. The electrified 7 Series is slightly slower from a stop than its V-8 counterpart, with a 0-60 time of a BMW-estimated 4.5 seconds and a top speed of 149 mph.\n\nThe i7 is expected to get approximately 300 miles of range, according to the automaker’s preliminary tests, though it has yet to get an official EPA rating. The automaker says it has improved the charging software used in the all-electric iX SUV and the i4 sedan, which should lead to reduced charging time for the larger sedan. The i7 allows AC charging up to 11 kilowatts, while DC fast charging can charge at a rate of up to 195 kW. According to BMW, a 10-minute charge will add up to 80 miles at a fast-charging station.\n\nStepping Up the Safety\n\nThe 7 Series comes with the BMW driver-assist suite, which comes with several upgrades for 2023. Features include blind spot warning, enhanced forward automatic emergency braking with pedestrian and cyclist detection, lane departure warning, front and rear parking sensors, and more. A new exit warning system prevents occupants from opening the vehicle doors and causing a collision with pedestrians or cyclists.\n\nBMW’s semi-autonomous Highway Assistant system, which is part of the Driving Assistance Professional Package, now offers hands-free lane centering on designated highways at speeds of up to 80 mph. That’s up from 40 mph in the outgoing model. Drivers must still maintain focus on the road and be ready to take control at all times while the system is engaged.\n\nIn addition to driver-assist enhancements on the highway, the new 7 Series improves parking technology with the introduction of a new Maneuver Assistant system. The feature uses GPS data to memorize difficult parking maneuvers to automatically control steering, acceleration and braking when the same parking job must be repeated in the future.\n\nPricing and Release Date\n2023 BMW 7 Series | Manufacturer image\n\nThe 2023 BMW 740i will start at $94,295 (all prices include destination fees); that’s up $6,500 over the outgoing 2022 740i. The performance-oriented 760i xDrive starts at $114,595, which is up $10,600 over its 2022 counterpart, the 750i xDrive. The new all-electric i7 xDrive60 wears the highest starting price tag of the group at $120,295. EV shoppers will find that BMW’s vehicles are still eligible for the $7,500 federal tax credit , and the all-electric variant includes three years of unlimited free charging in 30-minute sessions at Electrify America stations.\n\nThe 2023 7 Series is expected to arrive in late 2022, and shoppers can preorder the all-electric i7 sedan now on BMW’s website.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nWhat’s New With BMW for 2022?\nHere’s Lookin’ at You, Kidneys: Updated BMW 7 Series Gets Gigantic Grille\n2022 BMW iX xDrive50: A Smartphone on Wheels\nBMW Reveals i4, Eyes Battery-Electric Sedan for U.S. in 2022\nResearch the BMW 7 Series\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "To say that BMW was caught off guard by the rapid acceptance of Japanese luxury cars is an understatement on par with calling the Grand Canyon just another hole in the ground.\n\nIn the last three years, BMW – and almost all other European automakers – had its tires flattened by the Japanese.\n\nBut 1993 may be different.\n\nThe economy is strengthening. And European automakers are now bringing to market cars that can compete with those made by the Japanese.\n\nWhen comparing imported luxury cars these days, quality, customer satisfaction and individual taste are really the only question marks that remain.\n\nLexus and Infinti scored best on the most recent J.D. Powers and Associates annual survey of fewest reported problems. The Japanese luxury cars also nailed down the top spots on Powers’ customer satisfaction survey.\n\nBut BMW’s 740i is just hitting the streets, so it’s too early to tell how well it will measure up the competition in quality.\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nIf you love the look of a finely crafted engine, your eyes will probably glow like Roman candles when you see what’s under the hood of the 740i.\n\nBMW has raised the ante on all other automakers who pride themselves on neat engine packaging.\n\nThe plastic fan at the front of the engine and the matte black and brushed aluminum valve covers are about the only recognizable features. Everything else, such as spark plug wires and fuel lines, are tucked neatly under metal or plastic covers for a streamlined, space-age look.\n\nNot only is the 282-horsepower V-8 an impressive looking piece of machinery, it’s a powerful one.\n\nCoupled to a five-speed automatic transmission, the 32-valve four-cam aluminum engine can propel the 740i from 0-to-60 mph in 7.1 seconds. That’s a shade quicker than the Infiniti Q45 and a full second faster than the Lexus LS400, according to a road test summary in Motor Trend magazine.\n\nI’ve tested about half a dozen BMWs over the last three years. None have been as smooth and quiet and refined as the 4.0-liter V-8 in the 740i.\n\nWhen accelerating, the computer throttles back the engine slightly at the moment the transmission shifts gears. This is to ensure smooth acceleration.\n\nI don’t think BMW has been as successful in refining this technology as Lexus or Infiniti. Several times I floored the 740i and it felt almost unruly. It is as if the engine was resisting this intervention.\n\nIn any case, I found the 740i to be quick and responsive machine.\n\nHANDLING\n\nI am not going to waste time by raving about how well the 740i handles. Suffice it to say that BMW has equipped the 740i with a full menu of high performance suspension hardware.\n\nAfter all, we are talking about a BMW here. One expects an athletic ride, and the 740i delivers with all the grace and fluidity of a sports hero at the top of his game.\n\nBMW has built upon its reputation for crafting standard-setting sports sedans by giving the 740i some interesting new technology.\n\nOne such item is called the ASC+T system – that’s short for Automatic Stability Control plus Traction.\n\nMost traction control systems merely reduce engine power when tires start to spin on slick pavement. The BMW system goes a step further – it reduces the throttle and selectively applies the rear brakes to the slipping tire.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nIf BMW is going to compete with Japanese luxury cars, it is going to have to assemble its vehicles as well as its rivals. BMW already may be there with the 740i.\n\nComfortable and well built, I found the car to have a little more style and personality than the Lexus LS400 I tested several weeks ago.\n\nThe simplicity of the wood-covered dash, the soft and inviting leather seats, the thick wool carpet and the solid feel of the car combine in a way that attacks your senses with pleasing aromas, nicely styled shapes and materials that are sturdy and durable.\n\nThe e are a few areas where the 740i has not kept pace with Japanese luxury cars. For instance , the steering wheel is electrically adjustable, as it is on big Lexus and Infiniti cars. But the wheel only telescopes; it doesn’t move up or down.\n\nThe 740i is the first BMW to have a remote-control door lock transmitter. But it is big and bulky compared to what other automakers offer. For instance, the Lexus LS400 has the transmitter built in to the key.\n\nAnd for the money, BMW should give the740i a top-notch stereo system with a CD player.\n\nI recognized the Pioneer stereo as being basically similar to what was used in a 1991 Rover Sterling – a $28,500 car when new.\n\nThe AM/FM stereo is a decent unit for a mid-priced luxury car, but not for a $60,000 BMW sports sedan. The Nakamichi unit in the Lexus blows it away.\n\nThe 700 series body has been around for a few years. It’s BMW’s biggest sedan. There’s abundant room for rear passengers, a spacious trunk and a decent size glovebox.\n\nTwin air bags are standard.\n\nConsidering the shocking rise in price of Japanese luxury cars in the last year and the competitive price of the 740i, BMW appears to be in a position to try to win back those buyers who moved to Japanese machinery.\n\nTruett’s tip: The new 740i is BMW’s answer to Japan’s Lexus LS400 and Infiniti Q45 V-8 powered luxury sedans. It’s close in price, performance and equipment, and by far the leader in style and character.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2017 BMW 740?\n\nThe BMW 740 is a full-size luxury sedan that competes with the Audi A8, Mercedes-Benz S-Class, Jaguar XJ and Lexus LS. Where the 740 has turbocharged V-6 power, the 7 Series also comes in V-8-powered 750 and plug-in-hybrid 740e trim levels, covered separately. The 740i has rear-wheel drive, and for 2017 the new 740xi brings all-wheel drive, termed xDrive.\n\nWhat's New on the 2017 BMW 740?\n\nAn all-wheel-drive version has been added for 2017; last year the 740i came only with rear-wheel drive. The Display Key becomes standard. Its LCD touchscreen displays vehicle status and can operate the windows, locks, climate system and more within a range of 985 feet, farther than a typical key fob.\n\nWhat Features in the 2017 BMW 740 Are Most Important?\n\nThe 740 is powered by a 320-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter six-cylinder engine teamed with an eight-speed automatic transmission. Significant standard features include front and rear parking sensors, a backup camera, heated front seats, touch-sensitive controls, gesture recognition, an adaptive air suspension, adaptive LED headlights, four-zone automatic air conditioning, iDrive multimedia system with a 10.2-inch touchscreen and navigation system, a panoramic moonroof, wireless phone charging, a Wi-Fi hot spot, and genuine wood and aluminum interior trim. As required in every new 2017 car, front airbags, antilock brakes and an electronic stability system are included.\n\nSignificant available features include forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, a surround-view camera system, an automated parking system, a night vision camera, heated rear seats, ventilated front and rear seats, a head-up display and an in-cabin fragrance system with choice of scents.\n\nShould I Buy the 2017 BMW 740?\n\nThe 740 may have a V-6, but twin turbochargers give it enough power to satisfy most buyers. Its acceleration, roominess, comfort and luxury fit the requirements for this class, but minimal steering feedback makes it feel less sporty, and the new gesture controls are more gimmicky than useful. \n\nCars.com's Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 BMW 7 Series?\n\nA large luxury car with seating for four or five people, depending on configuration, the BMW 7 Series is the marque’s flagship sedan. The 740i has a 375-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder engine and is available with rear- or all-wheel drive (which BMW calls “xDrive”). The 760i gets standard AWD and a 536-hp, twin-turbo 4.4-liter mild-hybrid V-8. There’s also a new plug-in hybrid variant for 2024 named the 750e (details below). All engines are matched with an eight-speed automatic transmission. BMW also offers an all-electric version of the 7 Series named the i7 (reviewed separately on Cars.com). The 7 Series’ competitors include the Audi A8, Genesis G90, Lexus LS 500 and Mercedes-Benz S-Class. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 BMW 7 Series?\n\nFollowing the car’s complete redesign for 2023, the 7 Series’ model lineup expands for 2024. The 740i is now offered with AWD in addition to RWD, and the AWD-only 750e PHEV joins the roster. The 750e combines a turbo 3.0-liter six-cylinder engine with an electric motor for a total of 483 hp, and it’s EPA-rated at 33 miles of all-electric range on a full charge. \n\nAll 7 Series models get updated iDrive infotainment system software; it’s now version 8.5.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 BMW 7 Series Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nFixed-glass moonroof\nKeyless entry and start\nFour-zone automatic climate control\nHeated front and rear seats\nHeated steering wheel\nHead-up display\n12.3-inch digital instrument cluster\n14.9-inch infotainment touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nNavigation\nBowers & Wilkins surround-sound audio system\nForward collision warning\nBlind spot warning\nFront and rear parking sensors\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nAdaptive air suspension\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nPanoramic Sky Lounge LED Roof\nHeated and ventilated front and rear seats\nMassaging front and rear seats\nRear-seat entertainment system with 31.3-inch screen\nReclining rear seats \nLane departure steering assist\nLane departure warning\nHands-free low-speed highway driving system\nFour-wheel steering\nActive suspension with road preview\nShould I Buy the 2024 BMW 7 Series?\n\nEven by large luxury-car standards, the BMW 7 Series is a technological tour de force. It offers a broad range of high-tech available features, including gee-whiz options like a widescreen rear-entertainment monitor that powers down from the headliner, as well as smartphone-sized touchscreen controls built into the rear door panels. An impressive lineup of smooth, strong powertrains and surprisingly crisp handling for a big car are other highlights. Prices are steep, however, and the 7 Series’ exterior styling is polarizing. Some controls are finicky, and the standard equipment list isn’t as extensive as it should be at these prices.",

      "expert_review": "If I ever hit the lottery, there will be a BMW 7-series car in my palatial driveway, along with a Jaguar XJR, a Range Rover and several motorcycles.\n\nThe 7-series is precisely the kind of car you want to put your family in. It feels as strong and safe as your average bank vault.\n\nWith six air bags – and 2 more as options – in addition to traction and stability control systems, it seems unthinkable that a driver or passengers could get seriously injured in anything short of a freak accident or natural disaster – such as an airplane crashing on the car or the ground disappearing from underneath it.\n\nPERFORMANCE, HANDLING\n\nThe 7-series comes in 740 and 750 models.\n\nThe 740 sports BMW’s 4.4-liter four-cam 32-valve V-8 engine. Horsepower is rated a robust 282.\n\nThe 750is outfitted with a 5.4-liter twin-cam V-12, an engine that cranks out 322 horsepower. Both engines are mated to a five-speed automatic transmission that drives the rear wheels. Stretched models are given the “il” designation.\n\nOur 740il test car’s V-8 engine purred when driven easily. And if BMW hadn’t done such a fine job making the car so quiet, it would have growled when accelerating quickly. Under hard acceleration, you could hear the engine’s lovely range of mechanical noises only with the radio off.\n\nFor those of you who love what goes on under the hood, there are few finer sounds in this world.\n\nFor those of you who care more about what goes on behind the wheel, rest assured that the 740il delivers ample power and performance, respectable fuel economy and a good mixture of refined luxury combined with BMW’s traditional sporty ride.\n\nIn other words, this big, handsome sedan does it all.\n\nThe 740il weighs a hefty 4,300 pounds, yet it doesn’t feel like a lead sled. The superbly tuned four-wheel independent suspension system and the car’s great weight iron out most bumps.\n\nWhen you drive over a pothole or a speed bump, all you feel is a slight inconsistency in the road’s surface. And the ride is exceptionally quiet, with only the sound of the tires rolling over the pavement reaching the inside of the car.\n\nUnlike an antiseptic Lexus LS 400, which deprives the driver of all sensations of piloting the vehicle, the 740il leaves something for the driver’s senses.\n\nFor instance, aim the 740il into the middle of a tight curve, and you’ll feel your pulse increase slightly. The car is so flat-footed and stable, you just know instinctively that it will see you through safely.\n\nThough you won’t typically drive this way – one hopes – it’s reassuring to know that you can count on the 740il if you suddenly have to swerve to avoid an accident.\n\nThe 740’s standard Dynamic Stability Control system automatically receives information from the car’s steering, brakes, wheels, and speedometer and uses the brakes to ensure the car goes where the driver steers it.\n\nSpeaking of steering, the power-assisted system in the 740il did not feel as crisp and responsive as is typical for a BMW: I had to turn the wheel more than usual to execute a turn.\n\nBut the power-assisted four-wheel anti-lock brakes were superb. Nobody makes better brakes than BMW, and they’re the most confidence-inspiring thing about driving the car.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nNot only is the 7-Series BMW’s flagship, it’s also the German automaker’s rolling technology showcase.\n\nOur test car came with the optional ($2,900) built-in navigation system. In its current form, the system has limited use and, for most drivers, probably is not worth buying. But testing the system indicates where BMW is headed in terms of integrating sophisticated technology into its cars.\n\nThe navigation system, which uses the government’s system of Global Positioning Satellites, gives a driver turn-by-turn visual and audio directions to his or her destination. The information is displayed on a small screen in the center of the dash.\n\nIf you’re familiar with the city in which you live, you wouldn’t use this function very often. However, there are other tasks the automated system can be programmed to carry out that have little to do with navigation.\n\nFor instance, if you want the car’s interior to be cool when you leave for lunch or go home for the day, you can program the ventilation system to cool the car at two preset times each day.\n\nOr you can enter a special code that will prevent the engine from being started. That function is in addition to BMW’s superb anti-theft systems.\n\nThe navigation system’s other functions allow you to listen to television programs, set an audible warning if you exceed the speed limit and fine-tune the radio electronically, instead of by turning knobs or pressing buttons or moving switches.\n\nThe navigation system is a bit clunky to use. You have to turn and press a knob to select the function and to enter addresses. It’s slow and cumbersome and not nearly as efficient as touch-screen systems. But the system does show that computers are likely to take over more and more of a car’s functions.\n\nAll models of the 740 come with BMW’s unique HPS, or Head Protection System. Two tube-shaped air bags are concealed in the windshield frame. In the event of a severe side impact crash, they deploy and protect the driver’s or passenger’s head from striking the car.\n\nBMW also outfits the 740 with door-mounted side-impact air bags and driver and passenger front-mounted bags. Rear-door air bags are optional.\n\nThe leather seats are firm, comfortable and supportive. The 740il has plenty of room between the front and rear seat. In fact, riding in the rear is like being chauffeured in a limousine. The 740il comes with every power accessory available.\n\nThough I sometimes find it difficult to define value in a luxury car, I can say that the 740il is as complete a car as I have ever driven. Its quality is beyond reproach. Its performance and handling leave nothing to be desired. And its safety systems are the best on the road.\n\nSpecifications: Base price: $66,070. Safety: Dual front and side air bags, plus BMW’s HPS head air-bag protection system, anti-lock brakes, side-impact protection and electronic traction control. Price as tested: $71,390. EPA rating: 17 mpg city/24 mpg highway. Incentives: None.\n\nTruett’s tip: The 740il, BMW’s biggest sports sedan, is a spacious, high-tech luxury cruiser loaded with safety items.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nBMW’s flagship 7 Series is a full-size luxury sedan that competes with top-line luxury cars like the Audi A8, Jaguar XJ and Mercedes-Benz S-Class. The V-8-powered 750 comes in regular and extended lengths with rear- or all-wheel drive. The luxury sedan is available with four or five seats, and there’s also a six-cylinder 740 as well as a V-12 760, an ActiveHybrid 750 and a performance-oriented Alpina B7.\n\nNew for 2012\nAll models add a standard iPod/USB adapter, sport steering wheel and a backup camera. V-8 models gain 19-inch wheels with all-season tires and a premium stereo.  In a cost-cutting move, the ActiveHybrid 750 loses its standard leather dashboard, head-up display, and active and ventilated front seats.\n\nExterior\nThe current 7 Series adopts more conservative styling than its predecessor. It’s also a bit larger. The optional M Sport Package augments the exterior with more aggressive lower bodywork and darker Shadowline door and window trim. Exterior features include:\n\n\nExtended-length versions are 5.5 inches longer\nAluminum roof, doors, hood and front fenders for decreased weight\nOptional high-beam assist automatically dims high beams for oncoming drivers\nStandard xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights\nStandard adaptive headlights move with steering wheel\n18-inch wheels\nOptional 19- or 20-inch wheels\n21-inch wheels (Alpina B7)\n\nInterior\nAn array of entertainment and comfort features is available. BMW’s iDrive system, which controls the navigation system, stereo, climate control and other functions, was revised in recent years to make it more user-friendly. Interior features include:\n\n\n10.2-inch dashboard screen for iDrive\nFour-zone climate control, including independent control for rear passengers\nOptional rear massaging and ventilated seats\nOptional rear entertainment system with dual screens in head restraints\nOptional head-up display\nOptional night vision with pedestrian detection\n\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe engine lineup includes a 315-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder for the 740; a 4.4-liter V-8 for the 750, Alpina B7 and ActiveHybrid models; and a 6.0-liter V-12 with 535 hp for the 760. The V-8 produces 400 hp in the 750, 440 hp in the ActiveHybrid 750 and 500 hp in the Alpina B7. All engines have twin turbochargers. The ActiveHybrid 750 has lithium-ion batteries, which power an electric motor that assists the V-8 during acceleration.\n\nThe 750 and Alpina B7 are available with rear-wheel drive or xDrive all-wheel drive, which can send up to 80 percent of power to the rear wheels if needed, keeping acceleration and handling traits similar to those of the rear-wheel-drive 7 Series. Mechanical features include:\n\n\nSix-speed automatic transmission (six-cylinder and V-8 models)\nEight-speed automatic transmission (ActiveHybrid 750 and V-12)\nRear- or all-wheel drive\n\nSafety\nSafety features include:\n\n\nStandard side curtain airbags\nStandard front-seat side-impact airbags\nStandard knee airbags\nStandard electronic stability system\nOptional lane departure warning system\nOptional blind spot monitoring system",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nBMW’s flagship 7 Series is a full-size luxury sedan that competes with top-line sedans like the Audi A8, Jaguar XJ and Mercedes-Benz S-Class. The V-8 7 Series comes in regular and extended lengths with rear- or all-wheel drive and in 13 different models, including new hybrid models and Alpina B7 versions.\n\nNew for 2011\nThe 7 Series lineup expands for 2011 with the addition of ActiveHybrid 750i and 750Li models, the Alpina B7 (rear- and xDrive all-wheel-drive versions) and the reinstated 740i and 740Li, now powered by a twin-turbocharged six-cylinder engine. The ActiveHybrid 750 models have lithium-ion batteries, which power an electric motor that assists the V-8 during acceleration.\n\nExterior\nThe current 7 Series adopts more conservative styling than its predecessor. It’s also a bit larger. The optional M Sport Package augments the exterior with more aggressive lower bodywork, 19-inch wheels and darker Shadowline door and window trim. Exterior features include:\n\n\nExtended-length versions are 5.5 inches longer\nAluminum roof, doors, hood and front fenders for decreased weight\nOptional high-beam assist automatically dims high beams for oncoming drivers\nStandard xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights\nStandard adaptive headlights move with steering wheel\n18-inch wheels\nOptional 19- or 20-inch wheels\nStandard 21-inch wheels (Alpina B7)\n\nInterior\nUp to five occupants fit inside the 7 Series. An array of entertainment and comfort features is available. BMW’s iDrive system, which controls the navigation system, stereo, climate control and other functions, was revised in recent years to make it more user-friendly. Interior features include:\n\n\n10.2-inch dashboard screen for iDrive\nFour-zone climate control, including independent control for rear passengers\nOptional rear massage and ventilation seats\nOptional rear entertainment system with dual screens in head restraints\nOptional head-up display\nOptional night vision with pedestrian detection\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe engine lineup includes a 315-horsepower, 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder for the 740 models; a 4.4-liter V-8 for the 750, Alpina B7 and ActiveHybrid models; and a 6.0-liter V-12 with 535 hp for the 760i. The V-8 produces 400 hp in the 750, 440 hp in the ActiveHybrid and 500 hp in the Alpina B7. All engines have twin turbochargers.\n\nBMW’s xDrive all-wheel drive can send up to 80 percent of power to the rear wheels if needed, keeping acceleration and handling traits similar to those of the rear-wheel-drive 7 Series. Mechanical features include:\n\n\nTwin-turbocharged inline-six, V-8 or V-12 engines\nSix-speed automatic transmission (six-cylinder and V-8 models)\nEight-speed automatic transmission (ActiveHybrid and V-12)\nRear- or all-wheel drive\nAvailable Active Roll Stabilization actively counteracts body roll\n\nSafety\nSafety features include:\n\n\nStandard first- and second-row side curtain airbags\nStandard front-seat side-impact airbags\nStandard knee airbags\nStandard electronic stability system\nOptional lane departure warning system\nOptional blind spot detection system",

      "expert_review": "NEW ORLEANS — MY FATHER hadn’t left the house for weeks. He was incarcerated by illness. But something of his old irascible self was stirring this particular morning. He wanted to get out.\n\nOf course, he was too proud to say, “I want to go out.” That would have implied a request for assistance, inasmuch as he can no longer drive.\n\nSo Dad approached the subject through careful inquiry — a method he developed over years of work as a biology and chemistry teacher, and as a fellow of the National Science Foundation.\n\n“What is it you have out there?” he asked, motioning toward the driveway.\n\n“A BMW,” I said.\n\n“A BMW? Is it a big car?” he asked, which meant, “Can I get in and out of it easily? Will I be comfortable?”\n\n“It’s a 740iL — very big,” I said. “How ’bout a ride?”\n\nHe smiled and summoned one of my two sisters who have moved back home to help him through these tender times.\n\n“We’re going for a ride,” he said.\n\nBackground: Dad is a World War II Army veteran who never cared much for things German. But he’s always given credit for things well done, which is why he muttered, “Nice car, nice car . . . ” throughout our tour of this grand old city.\n\nHad he been free of bias, Dad probably would’ve been more enthusiastic in his praise of the 1995 BMW 740iL — a car that’s way beyond “nice.”\n\nMy assessment is based on 5,000 miles behind the wheel of the 740iL — from Northern Virginia to Northern Michigan, and from there through Pennsylvania’s Pocono Mountains and over some back roads to Boston and thence to New York and New Orleans — often driving 12 hours a day.\n\nThat’s intimate seat time, during which you either grow to love or hate a car. Suffice it to say that I could have easily driven the 740iL another 5,000 miles without any regrets.\n\nThis is a car with everything — luxury, safety, performance and price, the latter of which is pretty darned big. But, what the heck?\n\nBMW has two 740-series models — the regular-wheelbase (115.4 inches) 740i and the long-wheelbase (120.9 inches) 740iL. Wheelbase is a measure of the centerline distance between the front and rear wheels. Generally speaking, the longer the wheelbase, the smoother the ride.\n\nOtherwise, the 740-series BMW cars are identical. Both are rear-drive models powered by a 4-liter, 32-valve, double-overhead cam V-8 engine rated 282 horsepower at 5,800 rpm. Max torque is set at 295 pound-feet at 4,500 rpm.\n\nBoth cars have standard five-speed automatic transmissions — yep, five-speed automatics — equipped with BMW’s Adaptive Transmission Control (ATC) system. Simply put, this transmission thinks for you, automatically and precisely choosing the right gear to match your driving style, road conditions and the particular driving situation — say, open flight along Interstate 85, or alleged driving in beaucoup congested Boston.\n\nOf course, dual air bags and four-wheel power disc brakes are standard, along with a four-wheel anti-lock braking system. Also standard are front and rear stabilizer bars and an all-season traction control system.\n\nThe 740i and 740iL seat five people comfortably.\n\nComplaints: That laminated wood fascia on the center console reflects sun at all of the wrong angles, sometimes blinding the driver. I had to cover the thing with dark cloth.\n\nPraise: Overall superior automotive engineering. Rigidly constructed passenger cabin. It’s like driving a rocket-powered vault.\n\nHead-turning quotient: Super neck-snap power, which is odd, because the 740iL isn’t especially beautiful. But it has undeniable presence.\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: Triple aces. Excellent braking — minimum body lurch and sway in panic stops.\n\nMileage: About 21 miles per gallon. Fuel capacity is 22.5 gallons. Estimated range is 465 miles on usable volume of recommended premium unleaded gasoline, running mostly highway and driv r only with light cargo.\n\nSound system: Ten-speaker AM/FM stereo radio and cassette with trunk-mounted six-disc CD changer installed by BMW. Superb.\n\nPrice: Base price is $61,900. Dealer’s invoice is $51,630 on base model. Price as tested is $69,000, including an estimated $2,890 in federal luxury taxes, $2,640 in options, a $1,000 gas-guzzler tax and a $570 destination charge.\n\nPurse-strings note: Compare with Infiniti Q45, Jaguar XJ6, Lexus LS 400, Mercedes-Benz S420 and, hee-hee, because I love it, the Cadillac Eldorado Touring Coupe.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 BMW 7 Series?\n\nA large luxury car with seating for four or five people, depending on configuration, the BMW 7 Series is the make’s flagship sedan. The 740i has a 375-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder and is available with rear- or all-wheel drive (which BMW calls xDrive). The 760i gets standard AWD and a 536-hp, twin-turbo 4.4-liter mild-hybrid V-8. The plug-in hybrid 750e also comes standard with AWD; it combines a turbo 3.0-liter six-cylinder engine with an electric motor for a total of 483 hp, and it can travel an EPA-rated 33 miles on electricity alone on a full charge. All engines are matched with an eight-speed automatic transmission. BMW also offers an all-electric version of the 7 Series named the i7 (reviewed separately). The 7 Series’ competitors include the Audi A8, Genesis G90, Lexus LS 500 and Mercedes-Benz S-Class. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 BMW 7 Series?\n\nAfter a complete redesign for 2023 and the addition of the 750e PHEV and AWD 740i for 2024, the 7 Series sees only minor alterations in its standard and available equipment for 2025.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 BMW 7 Series Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nPanoramic Sky Lounge LED Roof\nKeyless entry and start\nFour-zone automatic climate control\nHeated front and rear seats\nHeated steering wheel\nHead-up display\n12.3-inch digital instrument cluster\n14.9-inch infotainment touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nNavigation\nBowers & Wilkins surround-sound audio system\nForward collision warning\nBlind spot warning\nFront and rear parking sensors\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nAdaptive air suspension\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nHeated and ventilated front and rear seats\nMassaging front and rear seats\nRear-seat entertainment system with 31.3-inch screen\nReclining rear seats \nLane-centering steering\nLane departure warning\nHands-free low-speed highway driving system\nFour-wheel steering\nActive suspension with road preview\nShould I Buy the 2025 BMW 7 Series?\n\nEven by large luxury-car standards, the BMW 7 Series is a technological tour de force. It offers a broad range of high-tech available features, including gee-whiz options like a widescreen rear entertainment monitor that powers down from the headliner. There are also smartphone-size touchscreen controls built into the rear door panels. An impressive lineup of smooth, strong powertrains and surprisingly crisp handling for a big car are other highlights. Prices are steep, however, and the 7 Series’ exterior styling is polarizing. Some controls are finicky, and the standard equipment list isn’t as extensive as it should be at these prices.",

The 740i has a 4.4-liter V8 and starts at $62,970. The 750i has a 5.4-liter V12 and starts at $92,670. These prices are way beyond the average buyer, I know, but BMW sold more than 18,000 last year.\n\nOur test car was equipped with BMW’s in-dash navigation system, an $1,800 option on the 740i but standard on the 750i. This system uses GPS satellites to pinpoint the car’s exact location at all times, which is then displayed on a small color screen in the center of the dash. Regional maps on compact discs are loaded into the system, which means they can be changed easily as you move from one region to another.\n\nHow is the 740i Sport differentiated from its more pedestrian mates? First, it sits a little closer to the ground and wears very low-profile tires on massive 18-inch diameter wheels. Second, the side window trim is black instead of chrome. Third, the axle ratio has been lowered for stronger acceleration from rest, and fourth, the shock absorbers, springs and anti-roll bars have been changed to make it corner flatter and steer more responsively.\n\nSpecial 18-way seats, Vavona redwood trim and the Steptronic automatic/manual transmission are also part of this package.\n\nWhile these changes may seem subtle, they sharpen the reflexes of the 740i and give it more aggressive performance. With 282 horsepower lingering under the hood, the standard 740i is far from sluggish, but the lower (higher numerically) axle ratio of the Sport package livens it up considerably. BMW says it scoots to 60 mph in 6.8 seconds and the top track speed is electronically limited to 128 mph, which is academic in this country.\n\nThe Steptronic allows the driver to shift manually for optimum performance by sliding the gear lever to a special gate on the left side of the console. In this mode, drivers make their own upshifts and downshifts by nudging the lever forward or back. Although this is essentially a novelty that will be ignored in daily driving, it does give the driver more control over the car when the situation calls for it.\n\nThe added performance of the Sport package comes at a slight cost in fuel economy (15 city, 21 highway instead of 17 city, 23 highway), but let’s face it, the folks who can afford this car aren’t going to quibble over gas mileage.\n\nAs one would expect in a car of this caliber, the interior is very well appointed. The leather front seats had large side bolsters and adjustable under-thigh support that made them comfortable for long stints behind the wheel. They also provided excellent support in high-speed turns.\n\nBMW instrumentation is among the best in the business for clarity and simplicity. The 740i’s secondary controls for audio and climate control, on the other hand, tend to be less eas y to understand and use. The buttons are small, the layout crowded. Steering wheel controls that replicate many of these functions are handy, but their markings are so cryptic I had to resort to the manual to decipher them.\n\nNotable safety features include tubelike airbags that inflate to protect front-seat passengers’ heads in a side impact and optional side-impact airbags for the back seat.\n\nElectronic controls help keep skids in check, provide traction in bad weather and apply full braking force in emergency stops.\n\nOptions abound. They include break-resistant glass, parking distance sensors in the bumpers, a power rear sunshade, heated seats, heated steering wheel, built-in cellular phone and upgraded stereo system.\n\nPrice\nThe base price of our test car was $62,970. Optional equipment included the Sport package and navigation system, which brought the sticker price to $67,370.\n\nWarranty\nFour years or 50,000 miles.\n\nPoint: e l xurious 740i gets a shot of adrenaline from the Sport package. Its 4.4-liter V8 is creamy smooth yet fast; bigger tires sharpen its reflexes without degrading the ride quality.\n\nCounterpoint: The 740i’s styling is beginning to look dated, secondary controls are small and complicated, and most of us can’t even afford to look at cars in this price range, much less buy one.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\n\nENGINE: 4.4-liter V8\n\nTRANSMISSION: automatic\n\nCONFIGURATION: Rear-wheel drive\n\nWHEELBASE: 115.4 inches\n\nCURB WEIGHT: 4,255 lbs.\n\nBASE PRICE: $62,970\n\nPRICE AS DRIVEN: $67,370\n\nMPG RATING: 15 city, 21 hwy.",

      "expert_review": "With a futuristic look and advanced onboard technology to match, the 2013 BMW 740Li is a princely German luxury limousine that should please all its occupants.\n\nFor years now, BMW’s slogan, “ultimate driving machine,” has set the theme for the company’s entire product line. The brand’s vehicles range from compact hatchbacks to ultra-powerful SUVs, but everything must be a driver’s car. In theory, that should make the BMW 7 Series something special. It’s a long luxury sedan that can both soothe and sprint, depending on the driver’s mood. Its current generation went on sale in the U.S. in 2009, so we expect to see a redesign soon. We drove a 740Li, the most affordable and most modestly powered trim level.\n\nVisual changes from 2012 to 2013 are few, but a new eight-speed automatic is standard across the board, and BMW has enhanced the engines, interior and electronics. Compare 2012 and 2013 models here.\n\nThe ‘Bangle Butt’ is Long Gone\nThe 7 Series’ previous generation was frumpy, afflicted with styling by former BMW chief designer Chris Bangle that gave it a bulbous caboose and odd-looking scalloped headlights. The 2013 BMW 740Li I recently spent a week with was anything but frumpy. The latest 740 is long, low and mean-looking, with optional LED, halo-style headlights whose menacing glare both turns heads and parts traffic. Clean surface details stretch long character lines along the smooth sides to a rear end that’s also more subdued and understated. The overall look is one of restrained power, and even four years into its current design, the 7 Series still looks modern and turns heads.\n\nSurprising Power\nAs is common among high-end European luxury cars, a variety of powertrains are available in the 7 Series. It starts with a turbocharged, 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder engine in the BMW 7 Series 740i making 315 horsepower, and moves up to a 445-hp, twin-turbo V-8 in the 750i. If excess is your thing, the 760Li offers one of the last remaining V-12 engines available in the world, a twin-turbo 6.0-liter unit rocking 535 hp. The range-topping BMW Alpina B7 is the high-performance option, featuring a 540-hp, twin-turbo 4.4-liter V-8. The 740i and 750i are available in regular “i” or long-wheelbase “Li” models (the 760Li only comes long), with standard rear-wheel drive or optional all-wheel drive. For 2013, a new ActiveHybrid 7 model is available with a revamped six-cylinder, gas-electric powertrain and is billed as the gas-mileage champ. All 7 Series models can be had with rear-wheel drive, and all-wheel drive is optional on all 740 and 750 models, carrying the name xDrive.\n\nMy tester was a 740Li xDrive powered by the sweet turbo-six. BMW has long been known for its slick inline-six-cylinder engines, and this latest iteration does not disappoint, delivering a surprising amount of oomph from its deceptively small displacement. This is the wave of the future — small, boosted engines in large, top-of-the-line luxury sedans. Thankfully, there’s no lack of grunt from these high-tech motors, so the only thing you’re likely to miss about having a six under the hood instead of an eight- or twelve-cylinder engine is a badge on the trunk. The 2013’s six-cylinder owes its robust output to some of BMW’s special engine technology: an electronic intake system with no conventional throttle valve, infinitely variable valve timing and a new twin-scroll turbocharger. What this means is that the engine now produces the same amount of power as the outgoing model, but with 20-percent less fuel consumption.\n\nThe 740Li xDrive I drove is EPA rated at 19/28/22 mpg city/highway/combined. My combined city and highway driving returned a surprising 25 mpg, a frugality I did not expect. The turbo motor does require premium fuel, and it features a stop-start system that cuts the engine off when idling. It’s not as intrusive as previous BMW efforts, I found. Mileage is rated the same regardless of wheelbase or all-wheel drive for the 740 model. Stepping up to the 4.4-liter V-8 in the all-wheel-drive 750 models drops fuel economy to 16/24/19 mpg, and it plummets even further with the 760’s V-12, coming in at an estimated 13/20/15 mpg. The ActiveHybrid 7 is rated 22/30/25 mpg — not bad for a big German limo, and even more appealing given you’ll only pay an extra $6,700 to step into the hybrid. That’s not a huge jump for a premium luxury sedan.\n\nAll these engines are mated to a new eight-speed automatic transmission, but to get the most out of it you have to put it in one of the two driver-selectable Sport modes. Accelerator response is quicker, shifts are snappier and the car just feels more ready to dance than when left in one of the two Comfort modes. The selectable modes make a significant difference in the feel of the car, changing everything from suspension damping to steering feel and engine response. For ferrying passengers, the Comfort modes offer a cushy, floaty ride that suits the car’s limousine-like rear-passenger accommodations. If it’s just you in there, however, and the road beckons with the promise of entertaining curves, switch into a Sport mode and enjoy the responsive, entertaining sedan that the 740Li becomes.\n\nOpulence Inside\nSpending as much on a luxury sedan as you could on a small house should mean the car feels like something special, and the 740Li does not disappoint. Interior materials are top-drawer, with an impressive build quality and attention to detail. Soft-touch plastics, high-quality leather and wood, and smooth motions on buttons and knobs reinforce the 740Li’s status as the company’s highest-model sedan. Some of the interior controls are a little questionable in their function, such as the transmission gear selector that does not have the traditional PRNDL gates, but rather requires different motions for different functions. It looks like something out of a Toyota Prius; “Park” is activated by a button on top, for example, which is too easy to push if you rest your hand on the shifter to change the stereo.\n\nMy test vehicle also had a special “ceramic controls” option package, which replaces some of the plastic console knobs with glossy ceramic-coated metal ones in an attempt to do something different for interior finishes. It’s classy in here, and extremely comfortable.\n\nBackseat passengers have it even better. The extended wheelbase adds 5.5 inches to the cabin, all of it behind the front leather seats. Changes to the roof of Li models add another half-inch of headroom. The result is a deceptively large car on the inside that doesn’t look that huge on the outside. Rear seat passengers also have their own iDrive multimedia controller and 9.2-inch “floating” display screens, which are able to replicate most of what appears on the front multimedia screen.\n\nBMW’s once-infamous iDrive multimedia system works fairly well in its latest iteration. Not perfectly (it still requires multiple steps to do things like adjust radio presets or switch among media), but for functions like navigation and vehicle adjustments, the iDrive system works acceptably well. What works far more than acceptably, however, is the optional Bang & Olufsen premium audio system in my test car, which was one of the most outstanding sound systems I have tested in an automobile. Exceptional clarity, bone-shaking bass, and a high end that makes the hairs on your arms stand on edge. It was simply fantastic. The 740Li’s navigation system also earns praise for its clarity, sophisticated graphics and the repetition of directional graphics in the car’s head-up display projected on the windshield. Unfortunately, that pricey head-up display disappears almost completely when you put on polarized sunglasses.\n\nSafety\nThe 7 Series has a full complement of electronic safety aids, systems like attention assistant, active park assist and a backup camera. There are airbags for the driver and front passenger in the front, at the knee and from the side, as well as first- and second-row curtain airbags. No data is available from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety on crash-test results. See the 740Li’s list of safety equipment here.\n\n7 Series in the Market\nBMW has priced its sedan quite competitively, given its main competitors’ range of prices. Like other vehicles in this segment, one can double the sticker price of the base model with options fairly quickly. The base 740i starts at $74,525 (all prices cited include destination charges). My 740Li xDrive started at $81,525 and included equipment like LED fog lights, xenon headlights with halo effects, heated power front seats, a power moonroof, navigation, a backup camera and keyless access. My test car included another $26,000 in options, however, including $2,800 for black Nappa leather, a $4,800 executive package that includes things like a power trunklid, soft-close doors, ventilated seats and the head-up display. That fantastic Bang & Olufsen sound system will set you back $3,700, while the rear entertainment package costs $2,800. An M Sport package adds 19-inch alloy wheels, an aerodynamic body kit, smoked exterior trim, a dark headliner and a special M Sport steering wheel for $4,600. Electronics don’t come cheap, either, with active cruise control adding $2,400 and active roll stabilization suspension tacking on $2,500. Overall price as tested for my 740Li xDrive came to a sobering $106,245. This is not the top end of the price spectrum for a 7 Series, either — you could option a 760Li to nearly $170,000.\n\nThat might seem like a lot, but it’s fully competitive with other vehicles at this level. One would expect the most direct competitor to be the Mercedes-Benz S-Class, but it starts at a significantly higher price — $93,255 for an entry-level S350 BlueTec diesel all-wheel-drive sedan, which is more than $18,000 more than a base 740i. The Benz is also more of a luxury cruiser than a sport sedan like the BMW. The sportier Audi A8 is a more direct competitor on price, equipment and sporting pretense, with the base V-6 model ringing in at $73,095 and featuring mechanicals that are more of a direct match for the 7 Series. The only other player in this rarified air is the Lexus LS 460, which itself starts at $72,900 but features far less depth of options, technology, engine choice or overall driving entertainment than the BMW.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "They haven’t quite got the hang of those newfangled “crossover” vehicles, but the Bavarians do know how to build some of the world’s best luxury/sport sedans. Or at least Paul thinks so. Anita has a different take.\n\nAccording to him, the 2001 BMW 740i Sport is an outstanding example of the German automaker’s craft. This $68,470 sedan embodies nearly every desirable attribute the well-heeled enthusiast craves, from exceptional performance and ride comfort to state-of-the-art safety.\n\nAccording to her, the big Beemer is just plain silly. Keep reading …\n\nHe: I approach my first drive in almost every new BMW with a little nervous anticipation and high expectations. Knowing the company’s heritage as a longtime purveyor of great sport sedans, and based on past experiences, I expect each new model to provide a great drive, and I’m usually not disappointed. Some BMWs, of course, are more special than others. The latest edition of the 740i comes pretty close to being the perfect ride for a guy like me – pushing 48 years old, kids out of the house, loves to drive, but wants to be pampered a little.\n\nShe: For almost $70,000, shouldn’t they also be rubbing your feet and massaging your scalp? I think these prices are getting out of hand. You also said the magic words – “a guy like me.” Let’s get real. This isn’t exactly your typical family car. And I can’t think of many professional women in this earnings bracket who would put a brand like BMW with such a macho reputation on their personal shopping list. As far as affluent women are concerned, I think Jaguar gets it.\n\nHe: From a styling standpoint, and in terms of the brand image, you’re probably right. But BMW has not given short shrift to the luxury amenities you’d expect in this segment. The 7-series is absolutely loaded to the gills with stuff like leather upholstery, a glass moon roof, an automatic climate control system with dual controls and an emergency communication system.\n\nShe: I still think that onboard navigation system is difficult to figure out and program, especially if you’re trying to drive. And what the heck are all those buttons on the steering wheel? Like I’m supposed to know that “I/O” is the on/off switch for the cruise control. And one more thing. Why hasn’t BMW got around to putting the CD changer in the dash, like most of its competitors?\n\nHe: Gee, honey, did you like ANYTHING about this car?\n\nShe: I’m not finished. The steering feels too heavy. And when you sit behind the wheel, that ugly hump over the instrument panel is intimidating. I don’t like that hooded effect. In fact, the whole cabin looks dark and daunting. Probably just the thing for you sports fans, right? And that redwood trim – too dark. But actually, now that you mention it, I did like the terrific safety features, including the new run-flat tires.\n\nHe: Let me tell you about that fancy Vavona redwood. It’s part of the $2,800 Sport pack age, which includes a firmer suspension, a clutchless Steptronic transmission, a more aggressive final drive ratio and neat matte-black exterior trim. By the way, you can’t get the run-flat tires with the Sport package. Instead, you get low-profile 18-inch performance radials, which really don’t compromise the ride comfort that much. Handling, as you might expect, is really first-rate. And the twin-cam 4.4-liter V-8 accelerates like Michael Johnson in the 400 meters, even with the five-speed automatic. You have to admit that the styling is really classic BMW.\n\nShe: Classic tank, you mean. The 7-series looks big and kind of square to me, almost like my old Volvo. But I do like that Shadowline exterior trim. The matte black looks more casual than the usual chrome you see on luxury cars. But then what are you paying for?\n\nHe: World-class performance, world-class comfort, world-class safety. Need I say more?\n\nShe: I think you’ve said enough. The 740i is silly. I el sorry for people who feel they need to buy this car to boost their business image or impress the neighbors. I’ll take the Jaguar, thank you.\n\nAnita’s rating: Acceptable\n\nPaul’s rating: World class)\n\nLikes: Exceptional performance in a big sedan. Outstanding safety features, including side air bags and stability control. Classic BMW styling. Loads of high-tech features. Superb brakes.\n\nDislikes: No in-dash CD player. Rather pricey. Onboard navigation system is complex.\n\nType: Front-engine, rear-wheel drive, five-passenger luxury sedan.\n\nPrice: Base, $62,900; as tested, $68,470 (inc. $570 destination charge).\n\nEngine: 4.4-liter V-8; 282-hp; 324 lb-ft torque.\n\nEPA fuel economy: 15 mpg city/21 mpg highway.\n\n12-month insurance cost, according to AAA Michigan*: $1,868 (Estimate. Rates may be higher or lower, depending on coverage and driving record).\n\nWhere built: Germany.",

      "expert_review": "Opting for a diesel engine in the BMW 7 Series gets you all the luxury and speed of the gas-powered German luxury flagship, with the added bonus of better fuel efficiency.\n\nThe BMW 7 Series flagship is pretty much everything you’d expect in a big German luxury car: lots of power, lots of technology and lots of room. What you might not expect is to have a turbocharged diesel engine under the hood delivering frugality and power in equal measures to buyers who forgo gas engines in favor of something more exotic. You might also not expect to have to pay extra for features that can be had standard on vehicles costing tens of thousands of dollars less, but that’s also true with the 2015 BMW 740Ld xDrive.\n\nBMW has put a new 3.0-liter diesel engine under the hood of the 7 Series for 2015. It’s available in long-wheelbase, all-wheel-drive models only. Aside from the diesel addition, there are no differences between the 2014 and 2015 7 Series. For 2014, it received a new digital instrument cluster that replaced actual gauges, but there haven’t been any major changes to the 7 Series since its last redesign in 2009. Compare the 2015 and 2014 models here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe current-generation 7 Series is long, low and mean-looking, with optional LED halo-style headlights. Long character lines stretch along the smooth sides to a rear end that’s also more subdued and understated. The overall look is one of restrained power, and even several years into its current design the 7 Series still looks modern and turns heads. Apart from exterior badging, the diesel is indistinguishable from the gas version.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe 740Ld may not look different from your average gas-powered 740, but swapping the smooth, sweet, turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder engine for a 3.0-liter, diesel six-cylinder definitely changes the driving experience. Where the gas version has 315 horsepower and 332 pounds-feet of torque, the diesel makes just 255 hp but a sizable 413 pounds-feet of torque down low in the rev range — from just 1,500 to 3,000 rpm. That means acceleration off the line is surprisingly quick; it takes 6.1 seconds to get from zero to 60 mph, according to the manufacturer, and my seat-of-the-pants meter confirmed this isn’t an unlikely claim.\n\nPower for passing on highway stretches, however, is a little less forthcoming. You’ll need to plan ahead a little, as the low-revving diesel runs out of steam when you’re already hitting 70 mph and looking to get around slower traffic. It’s not stodgy, but at highway speeds it’s not sprightly, either.\n\nIt’s also not very loud, with a calm, easy cruising volume in the cabin that makes conversation between front and backseat occupants easy. There’s almost no clue that you’re driving a diesel except on very cold mornings, when startup produces a noxious odor, like your average city bus. Once warmed up, it’s as smooth and relatively odor-free as a gas engine.\n\nIf you’re looking for the 740Ld’s main rival, look to Audi, where the A8L TDI has a turbocharged 3.0-liter diesel V-6. If you want the engine, you’ll likewise have to opt for a long-wheelbase version with quattro all-wheel drive. The Audi diesel outguns the 740Ld’s 3.0-liter engine, making 240 hp but 428 pounds-feet of torque. It propels the slightly lighter A8L from zero to 60 mph in 5.9 seconds, according to “MotorWeek” testing. The Audi also handles better, with electronic drive modes that are more adjustable than those in the BMW.\n\nThe other flagship luxury sedan with an alternative powertrain is the Lexus LS 600h L, a long-wheelbase, all-wheel-drive hybrid variant of the Japanese brand’s top offering. It’s considerably heavier than either of the German sedans and doesn’t feature the same kind of content, space or cargo room.\n\nThe 740Ld is the most efficient 7 Series, scoring an EPA-estimated 23/31/26 mpg city/highway/combined, which is better than the gas-powered 740Li xDrive’s 19/28/22 mpg. It even bests the ActiveHybrid 7L model, which manages 22/30/25 mpg, but it doesn’t outscore the A8L TDI’s truly impressive numbers: 24/36/28 mpg, which our own testing bears out. My week of combined driving in the 740Ld, including plenty of highway time, netted about 27.4 mpg, which isn’t bad for a big sedan but isn’t much better than the 25 mpg I achieved in a gas-powered 2013 740Li. My personal experience with the Audi A8L TDI, though, netted 34.1 mpg with no disadvantage in performance, smoothness or usability.\n\nThe diesel is mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission, but to get the most out of it you have to put it in one of two driver-selectable Sport modes. Accelerator response is quicker, shifts are snappier and the car just feels more ready to dance than when left in one of the two Comfort modes. The selectable modes make a significant difference in the feel of the car, changing everything from suspension damping to steering feel and engine response.\n\nFor ferrying passengers, the Comfort modes offer a cushy, floaty ride that suits the car’s limousinelike rear-passenger accommodations. If it’s just you in there, however, and the road beckons with the promise of entertaining curves, switch into a Sport mode and enjoy the responsive, entertaining sedan that the 740Ld becomes. Still, the Audi A8L offers more adjustability, with a custom mode for mixing and matching different attributes to suit your tastes.\n\nInterior\nSpending as much on a luxury sedan as you could on a small house should mean the car feels like something special, and the 740Ld does not disappoint. Interior materials are top-drawer, with impressive build quality and attention to detail. Soft-touch plastics, high-quality leather and wood, and smooth motions on buttons and knobs reinforce the 740Li’s status as the company’s top-of-the-line sedan. Some of the interior controls are a little questionable in their function, such as a transmission gear selector that doesn’t have the traditional PRNDL gates but rather requires different motions for different functions; it looks like something out of a Toyota Prius. “Park” is activated by a button on top, for example, which is too easy to push if you rest your hand on the shifter to change the stereo.\n\nThe Audi A8L is easily as nice as the BMW inside, and maybe just a little bit nicer in terms of its plastic quality and assembly. The Lexus LS 600h L is equally comfortable but physically smaller and heavier than either of the two Germans. That shows up in an interior that’s narrower and shorter than the BMW or Audi, and despite the availability of some truly unique interior color and wood combinations, the Lexus does not feel as luxurious as the other two sedans.\n\nBackseat passengers have it good in the 740Ld. The extended wheelbase adds 5.5 inches to the cabin, all of it behind the front seats. Changes to the roof of long-wheelbase models add almost another half-inch of headroom to the backseat. The result is a deceptively large car on the inside that doesn’t look that huge on the outside. Compared with the Audi, the BMW has more rear legroom, at 44.3 inches, but you’ll be hard-pressed to notice that extra 1.4 inches given how much space you have to stretch out. The Lexus LS 600h L isn’t quite as long, giving rear passengers just 36.7 inches of backseat legroom.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nBMW’s once-infamous iDrive multimedia system works fairly well in its latest iteration — not perfectly (it still requires multiple steps to do things like adjust radio presets or switch among media), but for functions like navigation and vehicle adjustments, the iDrive system works acceptably well. What worked far more than acceptably, however, was the optional Bang & Olufsen premium audio system in my test car, which was one of the most outstanding sound systems I have tested in an automobile: exceptional clarity, bone-shaking bass and a high end that makes the hairs on your arms stand on edge. It was simply fantastic. The 740Ld’s navigation system also earns praise for its clarity, sophisticated graphics and the repetition of directional graphics from the optional head-up display that’s projected on the windshield. The only bit of weirdness in the interior is the location of the trunk-lid release switch, which sits on the lower dash panel by the driver’s foot.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe 740Ld’s trunk is a big one, featuring 17.7 cubic feet of room. This bests the Audi A8L’s surprisingly cramped 13.2 cubic feet of space and positively dwarfs the Lexus’ hybrid-system-constrained 10.1 cubic feet. Split, folding rear seats can expand cargo room in all of them, but only in the Lexus is the feature standard; the BMW and Audi make it an option.\n\nSafety\nNeither the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration nor the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has crash-tested the 7 Series — or most competing luxury cars. The 7 Series has a few standard electronic safety aids, like attention assistant, parking assist sensors and a backup camera, but most advanced features are optional, even at this high price tag. For example, my test car had an optional night-vision system, but no automatic distance-keeping cruise control, blind spot warning, lane keep assist or lane departure warning. Most notably, it doesn’t offer forward collision warning, which has found its way into cars as modest as the compact Subaru Impreza. See the 740Ld’s list of safety equipment here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nBMW has priced its sedan quite competitively given its main competitors’ range of prices. Like other vehicles in this segment, one can double the sticker price of a base model with options. My 740Ld xDrive started at $83,450 (including destination fee) and included equipment like LED fog lights, xenon headlights with halo effects, heated and powered front seats, a power moonroof, navigation, a backup camera and keyless access. Like all BMWs, however, if you want a decently equipped one you have to start adding options.\n\nMy test car added $4,600 for its M Sport Package (which brings a head-up display, 19-inch wheels, 20-way adjustable ventilated seats, soft-close doors, a leather dashboard, and top- and side-view cameras), $800 for a Cold Weather Package, $3,700 for the Bang & Olufsen sound system, $1,900 for LED headlights, $4,800 for the Executive Package, another $1,300 for 20-inch wheels, $2,500 for adaptive-drive suspension control, $1,000 for powered rear and side sunshades, $650 for ceramic interior trim bits, $500 for Bluetooth phone access and $2,300 for the night vision camera. The overall price as tested for my 740Ld xDrive came to a lofty $107,500. This isn’t the top end of the price spectrum for a 7 Series, either; you can option a V-12 760Li to nearly $170,000.\n\nThat might seem like a lot, but it’s fully competitive with other vehicles at this level. One would expect its most direct competitor to be a Mercedes-Benz S-Class, but for 2015 the new S-Class is no longer offered with a diesel engine. That’s expected to change eventually, but the old S350 Bluetec is no more. The sportier Audi A8L TDI is the only other big diesel sedan offered in the market, starting at $86,025. That’s a higher starting price, but the A8L TDI has more standard features. It can be optioned up the same way as the 740Ld to easily top $100,000. The only other player in this rarified air is the Lexus LS 600h L, the hybrid version of Lexus’ flagship sedan. Compared even with fully loaded versions of the two German sedans, however, the Lexus’ base price of $121,365 seems almost unbelievable. More unbelievable is that even at that price you still have to pay another $6,500 for lane keep assist and dynamic cruise control — features that are included on high-end versions of cars costing $100,000 less.  Compare the BMW 740Ld with its competitors here.\n\nemail",
