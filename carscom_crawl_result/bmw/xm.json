      "expert_review": "BMW’s XM is evolving fast. The five-passenger SUV debuted for the 2023 model year with a 644-horsepower plug-in hybrid V-8 powertrain, and the XM Label debuted for 2024 with an amped-up hybrid powertrain cranking out 738 hp. Now, for 2026, the higher-powered Label is the sole XM available.\n\nRelated: 2023 BMW XM Review: Indulge if You Dare\n\nOther than the pruned lineup, changes to the XM for this year are minimal. An upgraded onboard charger allows the 19.2-kilowatt-hour battery to charge at up to 11 kilowatts, up from 7.4. A new matte-paint option, Frozen Tanzanite Blue, joins the palette; there’s another black 23-inch wheel option; and a new welcome animation from the LED exterior lighting helps owners show off — or find their vehicle in a dark parking lot. There are also three new two-tone options for the leather interior: blue and tan, black and tan, and gray and black.\n\nWhat Are the 2026 BMW XM’s Powertrainz Specs and MPG?\n\nPowering the XM Label is a twin-turbocharged 4.4-liter V-8 making 577 hp and 553 pounds-feet of torque. A potent electric motor integrated into the eight-speed automatic transmission lofts total system output to 738 hp and 738 pounds-feet. BMW’s xDrive all-wheel drive is standard.\n\nBMW says the XM Label needs just 3.6 seconds to accelerate from 0-60 mph. Top speed is limited to 155 mph, or 175 with the optional M Driver’s Package. Though official EPA ratings for the 2026 model are not yet available, they should remain the same as the 2025 XM Label’s, which can travel up to 31 miles on electricity alone; after that, the twin-turbo V-8 will burn a gallon of premium every 14 miles in combined city/highway driving.\n\nRelease Date and Pricing\n\nProduction for the 2026 BMW XM Label will begin in August, and the SUV will go on sale soon after. Pricing will be announced closer to launch. For reference, the 2025 XM Label starts at $187,875 (price includes $1,175 destination charge).\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nIs the 2023 BMW XM a Good SUV? 4 Pros and 4 Cons\nBMW Announces 2025 Updates for 6 Models\nUp Close With the 2023 BMW XM: Weird, Wild and Wunderbar\nResearch the BMW XM\nFind Your Next Car\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The all-new BMW XM’s (redundant) mission is to be “indulgently sybaritic,” and while it succeeds at that, it frustrates more than it delights. By trying to be both a performance SUV and a luxury SUV, it falls short of both goals, with a ride so jarringly firm it’s unpleasant as a daily driver.\n\nVersus the competition: Rival performance-oriented luxury SUVs may not be as quick as the XM, or as luxurious, but competitors like the Porsche Cayenne and Audi RS Q8 are far more livable — which is a weird thing to say about SUVs like these.\n\nThe 2023 BMW XM is an all-new SUV built by the mad scientists in BMW’s M performance division, and it’s also the M division’s first plug-in hybrid vehicle. With 644 horsepower and 590 pounds-feet of torque, it was the most powerful production vehicle BMW had ever built when it debuted — until the 2024 XM Label Red and its 738 horses and torques surpassed it. It’s also the most confusing and frustrating vehicle I have ever driven.\n\nRelated: Up Close With the 2023 BMW XM: Weird, Wild and Wunderbar\n\nOn the one hand, the XM is a hell of a performance vehicle; despite its three-ton curb weight, it’s quick and nimble. The XM’s interior is also luxurious and comfortable, with a backseat fit for a chauffeured ride. Unfortunately, though, its ride is just so firm I never felt comfortable while in motion. It’s as though Dr. Jekyll were just Mr. Hyde wearing a labcoat and glasses all along.\n\nRide Ruins Everything\n\nI usually avoid reading or watching others’ reviews of vehicles before I drive them, so I can go in with a clean slate, but murmurings about the XM slipped through. I saw snippets of content criticizing its ride quality and thought, “Surely it can’t be that bad” — and I couldn’t have been more wrong. The XM feels like it was designed by people who believe every road is as smooth as glass, because there’s no other excuse for its ride quality.\n\nThe XM is so stiff it’s jarring, magnifying the impact of potholes, expansion joints and everything else to the serious detriment of occupant comfort. BMW equipped the XM with an adaptive steel-spring suspension, but even in its Comfort setting, the ride is bone-shakingly firm — and it gets worse from there. At least this SUV’s engineers can take a perverse sort of pride in knowing drivers can actually feel the firmness increase in sportier settings.\n\nRide quality is further diminished by the standard 23-inch wheels, which are wrapped in tires with sidewalls so thin they look like rubber bands. Smaller, lighter wheels are available at no cost and might be the cheapest way to add an ounce of ride comfort.\n\nBody control in corners, however, is impressive, especially with the XM’s standard active roll stabilization. The Porsche Cayenne is also firm-riding, though not nearly to this degree, and its optional air suspension controls body movements just as well as the XM’s steel springs. At low speeds, the XM’s four-wheel steering aids in tight maneuvers.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nWhy Does the Limo Have 644 Horsepower?\n\nThe XM’s interior is downright opulent, with some of the best materials quality I’ve experienced in a long time. Merino leather upholstery is standard, and our test vehicle had optional Vintage Coffee leather trim covering areas like the dashboard and door panels. That option can only be paired with Silverstone or Deep Lagoon leather, and while the look is nice in a vacuum, our Silverstone/Coffee combination didn’t match the exterior’s blue-and-gold treatment. (That said, I’m not sure anything would.) The “vintage” part comes from small imperfections visible in the leather that also ensure uniqueness. Indulgent.\n\nIt was once the height of luxury to have an all-glass panoramic roof, whether or not it opened, and it was the height of performance to have a lightweight carbon-fiber roof to trim some fat off a car. The XM, however, employs a strange third option that mostly annoyed me: The headliner features a suede-like material with a textured geometric pattern that didn’t match any of the other upholstery in the car — and it’s surrounded by LEDs. It makes the cabin feel less spacious, but that’s not even the annoying part. The annoying part is that everyone who gets into the XM asks, “Does it open?” Even you, the driver, are likely to wonder that at least once per drive. And the answer is no, it doesn’t open. It just looms over you.\n\nThe XM’s backseat uses what BMW calls M Lounge seating, with padding that wraps around to the doors and cocoons passengers. There’s more than ample legroom, along with that plentiful cushioning and enough climate and charging amenities to make any passenger happy — so long as the XM isn’t moving. In motion, all that cushioning does nothing to shield you from the harsh ride. And isn’t this a driver-focused car, anyway? Why would you want to be driven around in a borderline supercar? And even if you did, wouldn’t you want it to supply a comfortable ride? Why does a car with almost 650 hp have throw pillows? It doesn’t make any sense, it’s just really indulgent.\n\nDriver-Focused\n\nMinus the luxurious interior, I might be able to forgive a lot of the XM’s ride-quality issues given the rest of its driving experience. Power delivery is immediate — some editors found it twitchy — and BMW says that, with launch control, this three-ton SUV can go from 0-60 mph in 4.1 seconds (and they usually underestimate). The XM hustles, and it sounds mostly good while doing so, though some of that noise is artificial. The eight-speed automatic transmission also shifts smartly, though it sometimes got hung up momentarily during aggressive kickdowns, pausing in a higher gear before getting where it needed to go.\n\nThe M name also means configurability, with two M Mode buttons right on the steering wheel for easy access. Each button can be set to a unique configuration of engine, braking, transmission, suspension and exhaust system behavior. It’s something I love about M cars, but I’d be lying if I said I was able to find a combination that really worked for the XM. Eventually, I just set both to be as aggressive as possible, with one letting the transmission do the shifting and one set for manual shifting — “sequential” in BMW-speak — via the XM’s massive steering-wheel-mounted paddles. They can be activated via the gear selector, as well, but I liked having everything within a fingertip’s reach on the steering wheel.\n\nLike many modern BMWs, the XM’s steering feels numb and disconnected at lower speeds. As driving gets more spirited, steering feel improves; it feels like the car starts to wake up. To combat the low-speed issues, I usually chose the most aggressive steering setting so the wheel’s heft was more to my liking.\n\nAnother option on our test car was an M Driver’s Package. It gets buyers two things: a 168-mph top speed instead of the base car’s 155 mph, and a day of performance driving instruction at a BMW Performance Center.\n\nBut again I say, why bother with a lounge-style backseat in such a performance-oriented car? For all the XM’s speed and agility, it’s still a 6,000-pound SUV first and a sports car second (though it’s a close second). Really, why make this an SUV at all (other than for profit’s sake)? A more fitting tribute to the M division’s 50th anniversary might’ve been a modern take on the original M1, which inspired the XM’s rear windscreen badge etchings. There’s also a silhouette of it in the digital instrument panel.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2024 BMW XM Label Red: The Most Powerful M Model Produced\nWhich Electric Cars Are Still Eligible for the $7,500 Federal Tax Credit?\n2023 BMW X7 Review: Fantastic, But Rapidly Approaching Overly Frustrating\n2024 BMW 5 Series: New Electric Version, Updated Engines, Futuristic Tech\nIs the 2022 BMW X3 M Competition a Good SUV? 5 Pros and 4 Cons\nIs It a Good Plug-In Hybrid?\n2023 BMW XM | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nAs a PHEV, the XM can operate solely under electric power for short distances. It has an EPA-estimated 31 miles of all-electric range, and I observed a predicted 44 miles with a full charge. Did I achieve 44 miles under electric power? Reader, I did not. At just 46 mpg-equivalent and 14 mpg combined in gas-only driving, the XM is — here’s that word again — indulgently inefficient.\n\nWhile the XM is more subdued in all-electric driving, it’s too tempting to tap into its full power and forget about efficiency. Unfortunately, its transition out of Electric mode can also be clumsy and jarring, making me wonder at least once what had just broken on the car. I preferred leaving the SUV either in Hybrid mode or an “eControl” mode that’s designed to maintain or increase the battery’s state of charge.\n\nLike most PHEVs, the XM does not offer DC fast-charging capability; Level 2 charging is the fastest available. Its onboard charger is rated at 7.4 kilowatts, and BMW says its battery can go from 0% to 100% in 3 hours and 15 minutes when connected to a charging system capable of delivering that level of power. That roughly tracks with our experience charging the XM using a public Level 2 charging station.\n\nWho Would Buy an XM?\n\nIf you’ve read this far, you’ve probably figured out that I certainly wouldn’t — and it’s not just because I couldn’t afford one: The XM starts at $159,995 including destination, and the one we drove had an as-tested price of $168,395. The M Driver’s Package and Vintage Coffee leather trim are $2,500 each, and the optional Bowers & Wilkins premium stereo alone is $3,400; it sounded fine.\n\nAs configured, this was the most conspicuous and ostentatious test vehicle I’ve ever driven, and that kind of flashiness isn’t for me. But I also got a number of unsolicited compliments from strangers, so there are people out there who like the cut of the XM’s jib.\n\nThere are better and more livable performance SUVs out there, but if you want to — sigh — indulge and shell out the big bucks for something so contradictory and unique, and you’re willing to put up with a painfully firm ride, the XM may just be for you.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 BMW XM?\n\nThe BMW XM is a five-seat luxury mid-size SUV that focuses more on style and performance than cabin space and ride quality. It’s powered by a plug-in hybrid powertrain that combines a twin-turbo 4.4-liter V-8 with an electric motor and battery, good for a combined output of 644 or 738 horsepower and an EPA-estimated all-electric driving range of 31 miles. Every XM comes standard with all-wheel drive and a long list of comfort and convenience features. Competitors include the Audi RS Q8 and Porsche’s Cayenne E-Hybrid and E-Hybrid Coupe. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 BMW XM?\n\nThe XM debuted for the 2023 model year and gets a new, specially trimmed Label Red version for 2024. The Label Red has red trim accents inside and out unique to the trim, as well as a 94-hp boost over the regular XM for a total of 738 hp. \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 BMW XM Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n23-inch wheels \nLeather upholstery \nSuede headliner \nDual-zone automatic climate control \nAdaptive cruise control with lane-centering steering\nAutomatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection \nLane departure warning with lane departure steering assist \nPowered heated and folding side mirrors \nHeated front seats \nPower front seats \nMassaging front seats \nPower tilt/telescoping steering wheel \nHeated steering wheel \nHeated and cooled cupholders \nRemote keyless entry \nPush-button start \nRain-detecting wipers \nPower liftgate \nAutomatic high beams \n16-speaker audio system \nWireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay \nWireless device charging \nHead-up display \nNavigation \nWi-Fi hot spot \n\nAvailable features include:\n\nLeather trim on dash and door panels \nCarbon-fiber interior trim \nUpgraded Bowers & Wilkins audio system \nM Driver’s Package \n738-hp Label Red Package \nShould I Buy the 2024 BMW XM?\n\nThe XM has luxury and performance in spades, but it’s also saddled with some significant shortcomings. Its ride is buckboard-stiff — which is especially odd given its premium cabin and coddling features — and its style-focused design prioritizes looks over interior space. It’s also exceedingly expensive and not very efficient for a PHEV. Even so, the XM’s ostentatious looks will likely attract shoppers who want a standout luxury vehicle.",

Introduced as a 2023 model, the BMW XM is a luxury SUV that is nearly the size of the three-row, seven-passenger X7, but only reserves space for only five occupants. It is also a sign of the times that the first stand-alone vehicle from the M division is a plug-in hybrid with a 31-mile electric range and a twin-turbo 4.4-liter V-8 powertrain that makes a total of 644 horsepower with the help of the hybrid system.\n\nRelated: 2023 BMW XM Review: Indulge if You Dare\n\nHaving added the even more absurdly powerful XM Label Red trim level to the lineup for 2024, BMW made only minor changes to the XM for 2025. The standard Highway Assistant hands-free semi-autonomous tech adds automated lane changes, meaning a dashboard alert notifies the driver that the vehicle would like to change lanes, and the driver approves the request simply by looking at the appropriate side mirror. Also, 23-inch wheels and the full range of exterior and interior colors are now available for no additional cost on the Label — pay almost $190,000 for a 738-horsepower superSUV, and BMW won’t demand another $5,500 if you want it purple. (Ten colors do still carry that premium on the standard XM.)\n\nAvailability and Pricing\n\nThe 2025 BMW XM is on sale now. Including the $1,175 destination fee, the base XM starts at $161,675 and the Label at $187,875.\n\nPowertrain Specs and MPG\n\nThe XM’s standard twin-turbocharged 4.4-liter V-8 makes 483 hp and 479 pounds-feet of torque, but there’s also a 194-hp electric motor nesting in its transmission, which catapults system output to 644 hp and 590 pounds-feet. In the Label, the gas engine is tuned to deliver 738 hp and 738 pounds-feet total. BMW says the 6,094-pound XM will accelerate from 0-60 mph in just 4.1 seconds, while the XM Label gets there in 3.6. Top speed for both is limited to 155 mph, although the optional M Driver’s Package raises that to 168 mph in the XM and 175 in the Label.\n\nBoth send that power through an eight-speed automatic to all four wheels. Since the Label’s additional power comes from the gas engine, both XMs manage the same 31 miles of electric range from their battery packs. And, given the lofty baseline power and mass of the standard XM, the Label’s EPA-rated fuel economy is no different. Both are rated at 14 mpg combined.\n\nStandard Safety and Luxury Features\n\nThe XM earns its performance-division branding with a torque-vectoring rear differential, adaptive dampers, active anti-roll bars and rear-wheel steering. But it also serves as a luxury flagship for BMW, with a comprehensive suite of advanced safety tech. Standard equipment includes Highway Assistant, as well as automated parking, forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, adaptive cruise control with stop and go, lane-centering steering and a driver-alertness system.\n\nInside, the XM is swathed in standard leather upholstery and features a three-dimensional prism-pattern synthetic-suede headliner, heated and cooled cupholders, heated and massaging front seats, and a heated steering wheel. BMW’s Curved Display digital dashboard  includes navigation, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and wireless phone charging. A 16-speaker Harman Kardon sound system is standard.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2024 BMW XM Label Red: The Most Powerful M Model Produced\nIs the 2023 BMW XM a Good SUV? 4 Pros and 4 Cons\nUp Close with the 2023 BMW XM: Weird, Wild and Wunderbar\nResearch the BMW XM\nShop for a BMW XM\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
