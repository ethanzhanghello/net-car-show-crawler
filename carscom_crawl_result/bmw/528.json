      "expert_review": "The interface between car and driver is critical to the enjoyment of driving. I was reminded of that last week as I shifted from second to third gear in a manual-transmission version of BMW’s 528i.\n\nThe 5-series BMW is totally new. It has a totally redesigned body structure, sleek exterior and numerous advancements in weight saving and crash protection. It looks smaller than the car it replaces, even though it is larger. If there’s any criticism to be leveled at the new 528i it could be that the exterior may be too conservative, but that’s the BMW way.\n\nThis is the third one I have sampled, and it may actually be the most appealing all-around configuration, especially considering its base price is $38,900 versus $49,900 for the 540i. It is not as fast as the ferocious 540i, which has a 282-horse V8, and it is not as effortless as the 528i with the automatic transmission. Yet, the properly weighted clutch and precision-shifting manual transmission connects the driver to the silky-smooth, inline six-cylinder engine so directly that you can pull off shifts that are as smooth as an automatic.\n\nFor those looking to share this same powerplant in a smaller vehicle at a lesser price, it is also offered in the 328i.\n\nI often found the 528i gobbling up the interstate at a prodigious pace because it is so quiet and composed. The lack of wind and road noise contributes, of course, but the suspension is tuned to keep the tires firmly in touch with the road without extracting a penalty in ride quality, and that is not a balance easily struck.\n\nEven riding on fairly smallish 15-inch tires it clings to exit ramps like a six-year-old to a Beanie Baby. The all-aluminum suspension saves 46 pounds of unsprung weight and that means the tires and wheels react quickly to irregularities. That lessens the impact felt inside the vehicle while enhancing grip on the pavement. Anti-lock brakes and traction control contribute to its all-weather performance.\n\nThe smooth ride gives passengers more time to appreciate the excellent interior layout and gauge design. Our metallic silver test car had an all-black leather interior, with dark gray wood trim. I would prefer actual wood tone instead of the dark gray, and I found that the wood on the center console occasionally reflected light back into my eyes. The texture on top of the dash not only looked rich but reduced glare very effectively.\n\nThe automatic climate control system has separate controls for right and left passengers, a nice touch.\n\nBMW continues to use stereo systems that have excellent sound quality but complicated controls that often require a search of the manual in order to figure them all out. The cassette player is hidden under a strip of wood in the center of the dash, good for anti-theft protection. The standard weather band is great for checking weather forecasts if you are traveling.\n\nThe back seat is not overly generous, with 0.6-inches more legroom tha n the old model, but it is more than adequate for occasional use.\n\nThe redesign of the 5-series has resulted in a taut, elegant four-door that is quiet, refined and athletic.\n\nPrice\n\nThe base price of our test car was $38,900. Its only options were metallic paint and premium sound system, and they brought the sticker price to $41,445.\n\nWarranty\n\nThe standard warranty is for four years or 50,000 miles.\n\nVehicles for The Star’s week-long test drives are supplied by the auto manufacturers.\n\nPoint: The 528i with a manual transmission is a rewarding combination for folks who like to feel involved with their machines. The handling is taut, the interior plush but understated.\n\nCounterpoint: The stereo is too complicated and the dark gray wood trim looks unnatural.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\n\nENGINE: 2.8-liter, 6-cyl.\n\nTRANSMISSION: Five-speed\n\nWHEELBASE: 111.4 inches\n\nCURB WEIGHT: 3,450 lbs.\n\nBASE PRICE: $38,900\n\nPRICE AS DRIVEN: $41,445\n\nMPG RATING: 19 city, 28 hwy.",

      "expert_review": "I don’t walk away from every new model with a single overriding impression, but sometimes a car grabs me by the collar and shakes me. While that wasn’t exactly the case with the redesigned 2011 BMW 5 Series, that car did consistently whisper in my ear.\n\nIf the new 5 Series is anything, it’s quiet and comfortable.\n\nThis new level of comfort broadens the sport sedan’s appeal, but at the same time the newly redesigned car gives up even more of its old visceral experience, which has been abating generation by generation.\n\nThe 5 Series sedan comes in three levels: the 528i, 535i and 550i. (The bizarre 5 Series Gran Turismo is reviewed separately.) Though there was a time when those numbers represented engine sizes, BMW’s recent embrace of turbocharging has cast off any semblance of meaning. Suffice it to say the 528i has a six-cylinder, the 535i has a turbocharged six-cylinder and the 550i has a turbocharged V-8. See them compared here.\n\nI tested the 535i and 550i with rear-wheel drive. All-wheel drive is available for both of these levels, designated “xDrive.”\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nThe 2011 5 Series is further proof that BMW is pulling itself out of an awkward design era. Recently, the only element that had seemed to tie one model to another was an ill-conceived — and poorly received — rear-end design nicknamed the “Bangle butt,” after former chief designer Chris Bangle. Though the previous-generation 5 Series’ trunklid was better integrated than the one on the earlier 7 Series, its too-small grille and raised-eyebrow headlights were an aesthetic failure. With a design inspired by the headlights, the taillights looked like they were trying to escape the car altogether. Blech.\n\nRefreshes weren’t enough to cure the 5’s ills, so 2011’s complete redesign is a godsend. The grille is stronger than ever, the taillights look like they want to be there and the headlights are more aggressive than fey. They aren’t perfect, though: There’s a translucent white stripe along the top of the headlight clusters, also seen on other BMWs. It looks like something that was supposed to be removed after shipping.\n\nThe hood is sculpted in the fashion of other recent BMW redesigns, including the Z4 and 7 Series. In lieu of faux vents on the front fenders, chrome surrounds the side marker lights — relatively subtle by today’s standards. The 528i has 17-inch alloy wheels, and the 535i and 550i have 18-inchers. Larger wheels are optional.\n\nCompared with the 2010 model, the 2011 is 2 inches longer and a half-inch wider, with 3.2 more inches of wheelbase. The car is easily mistaken for the redesigned 7 Series, though the flagship is almost 7 inches longer and nearly 2 inches wider.\n\nIn the Cabin\n\nBecause each was equipped with the optional Sport Package, both of our test cars had “multi-contoured” power sport seats, which we found comfortable. An additional seat adjustment, which tilts the upper section of the backrest forward independently, is a cherished feature. Likewise for the power-extending bottom cushion, though the gap it forms collects enough crud to clog a Dustbuster. We were satisfied with the front seats’ overall comfort and dimensions, but we wouldn’t have minded a little more front-seat legroom.\n\nDespite the larger exterior, the 5 Series’ interior isn’t notably roomier than before. Most seating dimensions increase or decrease by no more than a tenth of an inch or so, though front headroom is up 1.4 inches, and there’s an inch more shoulder room up there. Shoulder room is an inch narrower in the backseat. While it’s workable, the backseat isn’t exceptionally roomy. By the numbers alone, nothing in this class has impressive rear legroom, though we found the Infiniti M sedan’s backseat more accommodating. The midsize luxury sedan class is dominated by rear- and all-wheel-drive cars, which mean a large center floor hump. Call them five-seaters if you want, but those center seats are less usable than in other cars.\n\nCharacteristic of BMWs, the 5 Series’ cabin is relatively simple and spare, mostly in a good way. The instruments, though, are too plain in a market segment full of glowing electroluminescent gauges, though you can opt for a head-up display that projects crucial info onto the windshield. The 5 Series’ interior is otherwise a deft exercise in restraint. The materials are high-quality overall, with elements like standard genuine wood trim, or real aluminum available as a no-cost alternative. One big sticking point for me — which, again, is par for the course with BMWs — is the standard leatherette (that’s fake leather) seats in the 528i and 535i. Real leather is optional on these and standard on the 550i.\n\nThough BMW has high-quality vinyl, the lack of real leather at these prices is hard to swallow. Arch competitor Mercedes-Benz is guilty of the same, but comparable models from Audi, Infiniti, Jaguar and Volvo all have leather to start, and some of those are priced lower.\n\nFrankly, this isn’t a new phenomenon for BMW, or even for the luxury class, where you’re more likely to pay for features that come standard in the most affordable of vehicles. For example, practically every new entry-level car comes standard with a folding backseat, and, increasingly, an iPod connector. In the 5 Series, they’ll cost you $475 and $400, respectively.\n\nOne after another of our editors remarked about the shortage of features at our 535i’s $58,275 as-tested price. It had no navigation, no heated or cooled seats, no backup camera. On the upside, though some of these items are included in packages, you can also get them a la carte, so you’re not forced to pay extra for something you might not want.\n\nThe standard sedan has a 7-inch display and an abbreviated version of the iDrive control system, which employs a multifunction knob/joystick and a cluster of buttons on the center console. With the $1,900 navigation option, the screen increases to 10.2 inches and includes voice activation and traffic information. iDrive controls many audio system functions, the telephone, the BMW Assist telematics system and numerous vehicle settings.\n\nBMW’s iDrive has earned disdain over the years, but the current generation is actually pretty good. To my way of thinking, the issue has never been how hard it might be to learn but how simple it is to operate once you do learn it, and that’s the aspect that has improved. Don’t let iDrive’s reputation distract you from the true ergonomic foibles on this and other BMWs: I speak of the electronic gear selector and turn-signal stalk, both of which immediately spring back to a center position after you move them rather than stay where you put them. With this design, you lose the ingrained and perfectly natural feedback of a turn signal that’s still on and a transmission that’s in the gear you want. As a result, you’re always looking for displays just to make sure you don’t, for example, roll the wrong way when you lift off the brake.\n\nAre these controls bothersome enough to break the deal for a would-be buyer? You’d be surprised, but the BMW faithful have overlooked such things because of the vaunted BMW driving experience. So how’s that going in 2011?\n\nDrivetrains\n\nThe 528i, 535i and 550i are rated at 240, 300 and 400 horsepower, respectively. The turbocharged version of the 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder in the 535i makes the 550i superfluous, rocketing the car to 60 mph in less than 6 seconds. If you prefer 5 seconds, the 550i’s twin-turbo 4.4-liter V-8 will deliver, but the 535i’s character is more than you might expect from a turbo-six. There was some hesitation at times, but I wouldn’t attribute it to turbo lag, because it’s intermittent. Almost across the board, this turbo-six feels like a V-8. It’s damn impressive, and plenty efficient at 20/30 mpg city/highway with the automatic transmission. This beats practically all competitors. Only the base Audi A6 tops it, at an estimated 21/30 mpg.\n\nAll-wheel drive, in the 535i xDrive, gives up 1 mpg. The six-speed manual transmission, available only with rear-wheel drive — is rated lower still, at 19/28 mpg. The 528i, which comes only with an automatic and rear-wheel drive, saves you a couple of mpg, rated 22/32 mpg. The 550i’s best performance is 17/25 mpg with the automatic, 16/24 mpg with xDrive and 15/22 mpg with the manual transmission. All the cars require premium gas.\n\nWhere does this efficiency come from? Direct fuel injection plays a part, but as the mileage ratings reflect, the new eight-speed automatic transmission is a major player. My impressions of it are positive overall, though it’s more effective with the 550i’s larger engine (as is often true of automatics). What stood out was how quickly it kicked down under all circumstances, be it one gear, three gears, basically anything. This isn’t always the case. In fact, historically, an increase in the number of a transmission’s gears hasn’t always guaranteed satisfying performance.\n\nThe transmission’s responsiveness was still good in the 535i, but it wasn’t quite as quick and decisive on the downshift as it had been in the 550i. In either car, sliding the gear selector to the left (the only position it actually stays in) activates an automatic Sport mode, which raises the rpm at which the transmission upshifts. It’s a sportier approach, but it doesn’t seem to speed the actual gear-change time. You can also shift manually by then pushing the stick forward or back, or by using paddles on the steering wheel. Frankly, with eight speeds to work with, you’re always wondering what gear you’re in, where you need to be and if it will even let you shift higher or lower from your current speed. The fun is lost.\n\nAutomatics have become so smooth that you often can’t tell when they’re shifting up. In normal Drive mode in the 535i, I was quite aware of the shifting. It’s under heavier acceleration that the transmission is its smoothest. It’s an odd approach, but we don’t object.\n\nBraking: One Step Up, Two Back\n\nThere is an aspect of the 5 Series that we do object to, though, and that’s the braking. To be clear, the car stops well enough; it’s not a safety concern. The problem is the feel of the braking, which pays the price for one of BMW’s “Efficient Dynamics” provisions. Like the new 7 Series, the 5 Series employs Brake Energy Regeneration, which is a distant cousin of the regenerative braking that hybrids use to recover spent energy and use it again. In this case, there’s no motor helping propel the car, but the generator (alternator) can be turned on and off with a clutch.\n\nDriven by a belt, an alternator puts a constant load on an engine, and that hurts efficiency. This is the same reason belt-driven hydraulic steering pumps have been replaced by electric power assist in many cars, including the 5 Series. The alternator must be turned by the engine, but it doesn’t have to be all the time. BMW’s alternator has a clutch that releases the belt drive as often as possible, allowing the ignition and any accessories to run off the battery. The battery isn’t much different from a regular 12-volt starter battery, though it’s designed for deeper cycling — to discharge as much as 40 percent and then recharge. (Conventional starter batteries are kept topped off all the time.)\n\nIt’s when the car is decelerating that the alternator reengages and recharges the battery. This is a clever idea that BMW claims is good for a 3 percent efficiency boost, or roughly 1 mpg in mileage terms. Unfortunately, it makes the braking feel uneven, nonlinear. As you brake, the transmission downshifts through the gears as the car decelerates, aggressively locking the torque converter whenever possible. This allows the car’s inertia to turn the engine and its alternator, optimizing electrical regeneration. In a normal arrangement, an automatic transmission holds on to a high gear as you decelerate and brake, ultimately downshifting when you come to a stop. That sensation is smoother.\n\nThe problem is that the degree of engine braking varies as the 5 Series’ transmission downshifts through the gears, so even though you’re applying steady pressure to the brake pedal, the deceleration is uneven and you tend to come to an abrupt halt. For what it’s worth, we thought this sensation was worse in the 550i Gran Turismo we tested, but it’s still a problem here — and it’s not what we’d expect from a company that once touted “The Ultimate Driving Machine” (recently overshadowed by the ill-advised “Joy” advertising campaign).\n\nGiven a choice, I’d want BMW to tweak the operation or eliminate the transmission’s downshifting behavior during braking. I don’t know how much that would hurt the mileage, but I suspect any driving enthusiast would prefer it. The driving experience is neither ultimate nor joyful. I wouldn’t like it from any brand, but it’s especially hard to accept from BMW. \n\nRide & Handling\n\nBoth our test cars had the Sport Package, which includes several features that affect ride and handling, so bear in mind that the base suspension will perform differently. The package adds an adaptive suspension and active stabilizer bars both of which are controlled by the Driving Dynamics Control rocker switch next to the shifter. DDC’s four modes — Comfort, Normal, Sport and Sport+ — vary the suspension settings, along with accelerator sensitivity, automatic shifting behavior, power steering assist and traction control. It’s much simpler to use than the old approach, which included multiple buttons for the various systems. Now you can program the Sport mode to vary the chassis settings, the drivetrain behavior or both, making your preferences just a push or two away using the DDC buttons.\n\nThe 5 Series rides comfortably indeed in the Comfort mode, and it’s not bad in Normal. I was surprised by that because the Sport Package equipped both of our test cars with 19-inch wheels and lower-series run-flat tires. Sounds like a recipe for jarred bones, but that wasn’t the case. Cycle through the modes, and you can feel the ride firm up and soften, but it’s not always as noticeable as you’ll find in some cars, and that’s fine. One gets the impression the system is designed for true performance differences, not dramatic effect, so it really depends on the type of road and driving conditions.\n\nThe handling is interesting. Both the 535i and 550i are true to BMW’s founding principle of balanced front/rear weight distribution: The 535i is rated 50.9/49.1 percent and the 550i is 52.4/47.6 percent. The automatic is light enough that the manual transmission relinquishes only a tenth of a percent to the rear in either car. More important than the specs, the cars feel wonderfully balanced and controllable. Size be damned, you can four-wheel-drift these things all day. The standard electronic stability system can be dialed back or defeated entirely.\n\nThe standard suspension and different wheel sizes and tire types will all affect roadholding, but there’s no mistaking when the dynamic basics are there, and in the 5 Series, they are. My main complaint is about the sense of involvement. Dynamically, the 5 Series does what you want it to and more, but it’s less visceral than I’d like, and maybe even less than the version that ended in 2010. Generation by generation, BMWs are becoming less engaging to drive. Though it had its own shortcomings, the 5 Series of two generations ago, coded E39, felt more ultimate.\n\nThe electric power steering might play a part, as its feedback isn’t as good as it was in the best of BMW’s now-endangered hydraulic-assist implementations, but it’s good enough that a casual driver wouldn’t know the difference. (For the record, I’m talking about the standard steering; the active steering option, which is sometimes criticized for its feel, wasn’t on our test cars.)\n\nSafety\n\nThe BMW 5 Series has earned Top Safety Pick status from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety for top scores in frontal, side and rear crash tests and a roof-strength test that reflects rollover protection. The 5 Series is also among the first models tested under the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s revamped New Car Assessment Program, in which it earned an overall score of five stars, the highest possible composite score. Of the various separate tests, however, in the frontal crash it scored four rather than five stars for both the driver and front passenger. That wasn’t enough to bring down its overall score.\n\nThere are six airbags: two in front, a seat-mounted side-impact airbag for each of the front occupants, and side curtains that cover the side windows flanking the front and rear seats. Standard safety features include four-wheel antilock brakes, a stability system with traction control, and active head restraints for the front seats. For a full list of safety features, click here.\n\n5 Series in the Market\n\nThe things that trouble me about the 5 Series — high price, fewer standard features than some competing models — are things that sort themselves out. If BMW is asking too much for too little, consumers will make it clear in the only language that matters: money, or the lack thereof, in the hands of BMW dealers. There’s a lot to like about the 5, not the least of which is its admirable mileage.\n\nThe 5 Series’ combination of capability with unprecedented comfort is bound to broaden its appeal overall. BMW isn’t the only brand that has attempted to provide all things to all buyers. Lexus and Mercedes have been chasing that ghost for decades. Technology enables a single car to deliver a broad range of comfort and sportiness, and in some ways the new 5 Series sedan is a high-water mark in this regard, both for BMW’s line and for the entire midsize luxury car segment. It succeeds in behaving like two types of car, but what it doesn’t do is feel like two types of car, and I suspect the loss of that visceral feeling will disappoint the BMW faithful.\n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe five-seat 5 Series is offered with a twin-turbo V-8 (550i), a single-turbo six-cylinder (535i) and a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder for the 528i, with an eight-speed automatic transmission available across the board. Competitors include the Mercedes-Benz E-Class, Audi A6 and Infiniti M.\n\nThe 5 Series lineup includes the Gran Turismo, a tall hatchback built on the 7 Series sedan platform. There’s also an ActiveHybrid 5 model that gets an EPA-estimated 23/30 mpg city/highway; it’s covered separately in the Cars.com Research section just like the high-performance M5 sport sedan.\n\n(Skip to details on the: 5 Series Gran Turismo)\nNew for 2013\nFor 2013, the 535i and 550i can now have the BMW Individual Composition Package, which includes extended leather upholstery, 19-inch alloy wheels, Alcantara headliner material and Shadowline trim. Standalone BMW Individual options include wood inlays on the steering wheel, and unique paint and wood trim. Updates to the navigation system include revised submenus, weather information and optional Google search.\nExterior\nThe 5 Series shares its platform with the bigger 7 Series sedan. Up front, the car’s signature kidney grilles sit low and are upright. Adaptive xenon headlights are optional on the 528i and standard elsewhere. The taillights employ three rows of LED lights, and BMW’s Adaptive Brake Lights illuminate a larger section under hard braking. Exterior features include:\n\n\n17-inch alloy wheels (528i)\nAvailable 18- and 19-inch rims\nStandard power sunroof\nStandard heated side mirrors\n\nInterior\nDrawing cues from the 7 Series, the 5 Series’ climate-control readouts use BMW’s Black Panel technology to appear out of dark panels without the brightened look of traditional electroluminescent displays. Cupholders are in the center console instead of flipping from the dashboard as on the previous generation.\n\nThe optional navigation system includes a massive high-resolution 10.2-inch center display. Without navigation, the display still sorts through various audio and setup menus, but it shrinks to a 7-inch display and 800-by-480 pixel resolution. Both setups incorporate BMW’s iDrive system. Interior features include:\n\n\n10-way power front seats\nAutomatic dual-zone air conditioning\nPower tilt/telescoping steering wheel\nOptional head-up display\nOptional heated and ventilated front seats\nOptional 60/40-split folding backseat\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe 528i has a 240-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine. The 535i features a 300-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter six-cylinder and the 550i has a twin-turbo 4.4-liter V-8 that makes 400 hp. All three use an eight-speed automatic transmission; the 535i and 550i also offer a six-speed manual. All three models are available with rear- or xDrive all-wheel drive.\n\nBMW’s available Adaptive Drive system includes Active Roll Stabilization, which attempts to actively counter body roll, as well as an adaptive suspension and customizable settings for both the drivetrain and suspension. Mechanical features include:\n\n\nOptional Active Steering varies the steering ratio to render easier turning at low speeds and stable handling at high speeds\nOptional adaptive cruise control includes full stop-and-go capabilities to manage heavy traffic\n\nSafety\nA blind spot monitoring system, a self-parking assist and a lane departure warning system are optional, as is adaptive cruise control with a collision warning system. Standard safety features include:\n\n\nSide curtain airbags\nSide-impact airbags for the front seats\nActive front head restraints\nElectronic stability system\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes\n\n5 Series Gran Turismo\nBMW’s hatchback version of the 5 Series, dubbed the 5 Series Gran Turismo (GT), receives a few changes for 2013. The base 535i GT is powered by a 300-hp turbocharged six-cylinder while the 550i gets a power boost for its twin-turbo 4.4-liter V-8 engine, which now makes 445 hp and 480 pounds-feet of torque. The engine also gets fuel-saving stop-start technology and BMW’s Eco Pro system. Both engines team with an eight-speed automatic transmission and are available with rear- or all-wheel drive.\n\nAn M Sport Package that includes aero body trim, larger wheels and tires, and other performance enhancements is available. BMW Apps, an application that allows a variety of iPhone applications to run through the iDrive system, is a $250 option.\n\nThe Gran Turismo’s interior and exterior borrow cues from BMW’s 7 Series flagship sedan. With its steeply raked hatch ending in a short, sedanlike trunk, the Gran Turismo measures about 6 inches longer than the 5 Series sedan. The hatch opens in two sections: The entire hatch can be raised, or a section below the rear window opens separately to reveal a trunk behind the rear seats and below a cargo cover. For additional storage capacity, the seats fold in a 40/20/40 split.\n\nThe Gran Turismo can accommodate four or five, depending on the backseat configuration. Though it carries the 5 Series name, this model shares as much with the larger 7 Series, and many of its measurements — including all seating dimensions — differ from those of the 5 Series sedan.\n\nThe Gran Turismo’s interior includes Black Panel gauge and climate displays. The available Value Package includes an updated navigation system, a head-up display and smartphone integration. Back to top",

      "expert_review": "Reviewing a luxury car often sparks an internal battle. It’s difficult to admit (without those all-too-familiar pangs of parental guilt) that I really do like something that is more refined, a little more lavish and a lot more expensive.\n\nThe 2012 BMW 5 Series is all those things, and it can fill a practical role with family-friendly attributes like a spacious cabin, improved fuel economy and a large cargo area. How’s that for justification?\n\nThe real draw to any BMW is the driving experience, and for parents who love to drive, the 528i will be appealing. I’ve been spoiled by a BMW before and was looking forward to my weeklong test drive. Surprisingly, I didn’t fall in love with the 528i, though the interior did a good job of trying to sway me.\n\nEverything about the sedan looks great and functions the way it should, but it didn’t feel like a BMW in some ways. The 528i’s ride felt softer than other BMWs I’ve driven; it just didn’t have the tight, athletic feel on the road. There is an optional Sport mode that helped things a little, but it wasn’t the same. For the not-so-picky, the 528i will deliver a pleasurable ride. It’s a BMW, so precision handling and quick acceleration are to be expected.\n\nIn an effort to improve fuel economy, the 528i now has a turbocharged four-cylinder engine and start/stop technology, which turns off the engine when the car is stopped and the driver’s foot is on the brake. The engine starts up automatically when the brake pedal is released. I personally didn’t find my mileage averages to be significantly affected by it — the feature can be turned off — and frankly, the start/stop system’s execution was jarring. I was expecting something a little more seamless coming from BMW.\n\nThe BMW 528i sedan starts at $46,900. My test car was equipped with the Premium, Technology and Sport packages, raising its price to $58,775.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe 528i is a handsome sedan. It’s a little longer than its earlier generation, and at a quick glance, it could almost pass for a 7 Series, which isn’t surprising since they’re built on the same platform. The 5 Series manages to straddle the lines between luxurious and sporty and comes across as youthful but classic.\n\nThere were no ease of entry or exit issues with the 5 Series, either. The doors are solid but not too heavy for children to open, and the step-in height is ideal for just about anyone. A big surprise was my test car came with an optional power tailgate.\n\nThe cargo area is large and can easily swallow gear and groceries simultaneously. Should you require more cargo space, you can upgrade to the optional 60/40-split folding backseat.\n\nFor 2012, the 528i now comes with a four-cylinder engine, rather than a six-cylinder. The turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine makes 240 horsepower. It gets an EPA-estimated 23/34 mpg city/highway. What’s not so great is the 528i’s turbocharged engine requires premium gasoline.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nINTERIOR\nBMW has some of the best interiors and the 5 Series doesn’t disappoint with its quality finishes, thoughtful details and impressive displays. The 528i’s interior features aren’t flashy — its cabin possesses an understated elegance — and isn’t so fancy that it can’t withstand the day-to-day grind of a busy set of mini-passengers.\n\nAnother reason why the 5 Series could be a great family car: The backseat is big. After all, luxury and comfort go hand-in-hand, and nobody is going to feel squished riding in the 528i’s backseat. It’s a realistic five-seater, affording ample legroom for all, but if you’ve got child-safety seats back there, it only accommodates two.\n\nIn the front row, I enjoyed the ergonomic, multicontour driver’s seat. I spent more time than I’d care to admit perfecting the most ideal positions for back, lumbar and even thigh support. Tech-savvy parents will appreciate the technology BMW brings to the inside of their cars; the iDrive system is confusing for some, but I find it simple to use after a brief learning curve. I love the way you can customize the displays to show exactly what you want to see (I’m a big fan of the wide-screen map with the split screen showing my gas mileage).\n\nThe BMW Connected application is also available for your smartphone, enabling you to check the car’s fuel levels remotely, access your calendar events from inside the vehicle, and stream your favorite web radio stations. With the optional BMW apps, you can have your friends’ status updates and tweets read to you as you drive, but that’s a slippery slope. It’s best to just enjoy your drive in the BMW and leave the social networking for later.\n\nMy biggest beef with the 5 Series’ interior is that for a big ol’ car, it sure is skimpy on storage. Maybe it’s trivial, but I was annoyed that I couldn’t even score a storage cubby big enough to hold my sunglasses case and wallet at the same time. There’s a giant armrest in between the two front seats, but once opened, it’s just a shallow storage cutout with all the iPod and USB connection cords that usually get in the way. And as a mom who always commutes with a beverage, I wouldn’t trust my latte in the front row’s small, flimsy cupholders for a second. There are two cupholders in front and an armrest in the backseat containing two more. There’s a traditional glove box, too, but that’s about all for storage. That’s a big disappointment for those of us who enjoy traveling in luxury with our little luxuries, too.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Puny\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2012 BMW 5 Series, except for those with all-wheel drive and a V-8, has been named a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety due to its highest rating of Good in front, side, rear and roof-strength crash tests. In crash tests conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the 5 Series was also awarded an overall score of five stars out of five. It earned five stars in the side-impact and rollover crash tests and four stars of five in the frontal crash test.\n\nSafety features include rear-wheel drive, four-wheel-disc antilock brakes, an electronic stability system with traction control, active front head restraints and six airbags, including side curtains.\n\nThere are many other safety features, but they’ll cost you. I was shocked that my test car, which had the optional Premium, Sport and Technology packages and was more than $12,000 over the base model price, did not come with blind spot warning and lane departure warning systems or adaptive cruise control. The 528i also has optional all-wheel drive, auto-dimming headlights, night vision, parking sensors and a backup camera.\n\nWhat eases the options sting somewhat is installing child-safety seats is a breeze. There are two sets of Latch anchors in the backseat, and they are easily accessed thanks to conveniently hinged covers. Flip up the cover and the Latch anchor is ready for use, with no digging into the seat cushions. I consider not sweating and struggling to install my daughter’s rear-facing car seat the biggest luxury of all.\n\nGet more safety information on the 2012 BMW 528i here.",

      "expert_review": "The updated 2008 BMW 5 Series has something new — but only for those who have been paying attention. To the casual observer, the updated 2008 BMW 5 Series will appear identical to the 2007 model. What’s different are some very slight exterior modifications, updated engines — including one entirely new power plant — and more standard and optional comfort features. Most of the changes don’t radically alter this luxury sedan’s place in the market, and they likely won’t do enough to draw in the uninitiated.\n\n \n\nExterior\nIf you can tell the difference between a 2007 BMW 525i and a 2008 BMW 528i — one of the models I tested — when one passes you on the street, congratulations. Most folks will need to circle the car very slowly to see the changes (hint: check out the head- and taillights).\n\nThe 5 Series’ design was a radical departure for BMW when it debuted in 2003, but its dramatically raked hood and squared off rump are more widely used by many automakers today, meaning the 5 Series now blends fairly well into the flow of traffic.\n\nNew exterior trim included in the 550i’s optional Sport Package gives the car the appearance of the more expensive, performance-oriented M5, but without the additional $20,000 that the 500-horsepower rocket commands. I tested the new 550i with the Sport Package, which adds 19-inch wheels and tires, more aggressive front and rear body panels, and black tailpipes. The package did alter the look and feel of the car; even though it was painted white, it was the most menacing white vehicle you can imagine.\n\nInterior\nWhile BMW says the interior has been “thoroughly revised,” I’d have to argue that only former owners will note the changes. There are slight upgrades to trim pieces, more console storage and, yes, even bigger door pockets.\n\nThe fact that there isn’t a radical new interior doesn’t mean the 5 Series isn’t a nice place to reside during a commute. Indeed, the 10-way power front seats are incredibly comfortable and can accommodate any frame. My wife said they were the most comfortable she’s ever experienced, and she rides in dozens of test cars a year. I’m not ready to make such a bold statement, but there’s no denying they’re near the top of the heap.\n\nRear passengers won’t be as happy, as legroom is minimal. Buyers might not mind that lack of legroom in BMW’s current entry-level 3 Series, but for the more expensive and considerably larger 5 Series, it might be a bigger issue. Still, the space is similar to competitors, like the Audi A6.\n\nAs in any BMW these days, driving the 5 Series means you have to learn iDrive. In the few years since it was introduced, I’ve grown accustomed to the complex interface that controls navigation, stereo, climate and almost every other feature of the car. BMW has taken pains to make sure there are easier-to-use knobs and buttons to control many of the same functions, like stereo volume.\n\nAll BMW 5 Series also add HD Radio standard for 2008. I initially thought this was a frivolous add-on, but after hearing local radio in high definition I was convinced of its value.\n\nPerformance\nThere are three distinct 5 Series models. The main difference between each is what’s under the hood and how it impacts the driving experience. The entry-level 5 Series is the 528i, replacing the 2007 525i. The 528i is powered by a 230-hp inline-six-cylinder engine. While its power is adequate, it didn’t supply any of the visceral thrills that most BMWs offer. There is a slight delay in acceleration off the line or when trying to hustle out of slow-moving traffic. You can use the automatic transmission’s manual function for more assertive shifting, but even that wasn’t impressive.\n\nReplacing the 2007 530i is the 535i, and it gets BMW’s award-winning twin-turbo six-cylinder that produces 300 hp and makes this sedan go mighty fast; the company says it hits 60 mph in 5.7 seconds. That beats a Hemi-powered Dodge Charger by a good half-second. I didn’t get to test this model, unfortunately, but I’ve driven the 335i with the same splendid engine and would imagine this vehicle is the sweet spot for 5 Series buyers.\n\nThere are also all-wheel-drive versions of both these models, named 528xi and 535xi, respectively.\n\nThe 550i remains the top of the 5 Series lineup, with a 360-hp V-8 engine that gets the sedan to 60 mph in 5.4 seconds, if you’re keeping track. I tested the 550i with a six-speed manual transmission and was very impressed by how much fun it was to thrash around. It felt light and easy to control and didn’t rattle my teeth like performance-oriented models like the M5 do.\n\nSafety\nThe 5 Series comes with side-impact airbags for the front seats and optional side-impact airbags for the backseat. Side curtain airbags are standard. BMW says the backseat side airbags are optional so owners can choose whether they want the added security. Active front head restraints are also standard.\n\nAll 5 Series models come standard with BMW’s Dynamic Stability Control and a number of additional safety features, including brake drying and — my personal favorite — start-off assistant. It keeps the brakes engaged when you’re stopped on an incline so that in the time between your foot leaving the brake pedal and hitting the gas, the car won’t roll backward. It’s especially handy in manual transmission models.\n\nThe 2008 BMW 5 Series has not been crash tested. The previous models earned top scores in front-end collisions by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, but they were not tested in side collisions.\n\nFeatures\nLike many luxury cars in today’s market, detailing every feature in the 5 Series would bore most shoppers, but there are some interesting features to note in the 2008 models.\n\nCruise control is now of the advanced variety, which measures traffic speed ahead of you so it can work in heavier traffic. That doesn’t mean you should necessarily use it on your bumper-to-bumper commute, but on the open highway the system can come to a complete stop without losing settings and accelerate back up to the set speed with a press of the gas pedal.\n\nA revised lane departure warning system is also available for 2008. This option alerts the driver via a vibration in the steering wheel whenever the vehicle wanders inadvertently into another lane.\n\nA USB adapter for an iPod or other MP3 player is optional.\n\n5 Series in the Market\nBMW doesn’t need to worry about losing its place in the mid-luxury market with the 2008 5 Series, but I still would have liked to have seen more than slight cosmetic changes to the stylish sedan. The company has a real sleeper in the 535i now, but buyers could find a number of better luxury-performance values than the 528i. That’s BMW’s problem these days: It can’t get away with building a hum-drum sedan in such a competitive field. Luckily, the 535i and 550i don’t have that problem.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "You’d think it would be a hard sell.\n\nToo many boomers and Gen-Xers grew up traveling in a leviathan of a station wagon, with large side decals that resembled wood only if you were almost totally blind. That was enough to make one never want a wagon again.\n\nSo why are all the luxury automakers coming out with wagons?\n\nCall it the sport-utility backlash.\n\nMany people find the idea of clamoring up into a truck not their idea of elegance, yet they want the hauling ability.\n\nOf course, any ideas that you’ll be hauling really serious loads is laughable given the BMW’s sloped rear window, which limits cargo space.\n\nBut this is about image as much as hauling. Besides, the hauling this wagon does has nothing to do with cargo.\n\nThe wagon’s 111-inch wheelbase is the same as the sedan’s, so the feel while driving it is the same as well. The wagon is only about an inch longer in overall length.\n\nThe engine line-up for the wagon is the same as well. The test vehicle was the 528i with its 24-valve double-overhead-cam in-line six-cylinder engine. With 193 horsepower, this engine is more than sufficient to move this car with some gusto.\n\nAlso available is an all-aluminum 4.4-liter 282-horsepower 32-valve double-overhead-cam V-8, capable of making this vehicle sing. Both engines have variable-valve timing, which helps produce more power while lowering emissions.\n\nAlthough the test vehicle had only the six, it was still a pleasure to drive, despite its upscale utilitarian nature. True to Bimmers, this one goes exactly where its pointed, with quick accurate steering that returns good road feel. Body lean is well controlled — the body doesn’t do the mambo over bumps — doing a superb job of absorbing the commotion.\n\nStopping is as accomplished as going, with four-wheel-disc brakes with anti-lock doing their job with little muss or fuss.\n\nHelping make this wagon such an accomplished road warrior was the optional Sport Package. When ordered, BMW lowers the ride height, adding a self-leveling rear suspension. Firmer shocks and springs and specific anti-roll bars are added. Tire upgrades and an M 3-spoke steering wheel completes the package.\n\nIt adds up to the perfect recipe for power-hungry soccer moms (or dads).\n\nOf course, even the most power-hungry parent likes being coddled, so BMW does an artful job of balancing art and sport. The elegantly sculptured interior was ergonomically correct. The quality of the materials is apparent, and despite the absence of wood trim, the cabin feels upscale.\n\nThe front bucket seats are firm and supportive — all cars should have seats this good. The driving position is excellent. Initially, it feels claustrophobic, but one realizes that the lounging-type position that some cars encourage isn’t encouraged here. Actually, this is a car for serious drivers.\n\nThe cupholders, positioned so that they’ll block t he automatic dual climate control, seem like a half-hearted attempt at best. The stereo was typically excellent, although it lacks a CD player as standard equipment.\n\nThe cargo compartment is nicely finished, featuring a cargo cover that retracts like a window shade. A partitioned cargo space is available beneath the cargo floor. A 60/ 40 split-folding rear seat is also standard. Available options include a retractable luggage net that prevents occupants from being bombarded by luggage upon sudden stops, pull-up sunshades for the rear windows and a retractable load floor, that slides out to become the perfect table for tailgating.\n\nThe problem is the sloping rear glass limits cargo capacity, but this wagon is as much about image and driving fun as it is serious hauling.\n\nSafety is also addressed, with front and side air-bags, inflatable head protection and other systems including Dynamic Stability Control (which monitors traction and cornering) aswe ll as D ynamic Brake Control (which reinforces driver effort during emergency braking).\n\nWhat it adds up to is a wagon for the yup-wardly mobile, as well as those with a penchant for driving without surrendering to a mini-van or sport utility. And with the sheer delight this car delivers to the driver, it’s enough to make any boomer forget about the colony parkbrookwood estatevista cruiser wagon with fake woodgrain trim that most grew up in. Isn’t it?\n\nMaybe, maybe not.\n\n>> 2000 BMW 528i Sport Wagon\n\nVehicle type: Mid-size luxury station wagon\nEngines: 2.8-liter in-line six-cylinder\nTransmission: 5-speed manual, 4-speed automatic\nWheelbase: 111.4 inches\nLength: 189.2 inches\nCurb weight: 3,726 pounds\nCargo volume: 32.7 cubic feet\nTires: P225/60R15\nBase price, base model: $40,700\nAs tested: Not available\nEPA rating: 18 mpg city, 24 mpg highway\nFuel type: Premium\n>>",
