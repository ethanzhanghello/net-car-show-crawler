      "expert_review": "The sleekly styled 2015 BMW X4 doesn’t differentiate itself enough from the excellent-driving X3 to overlook its decreased usability and bloated price tag.\n\nThe 2015 BMW X4 is an all-new model based on the luxury automaker’s second-best-selling SUV, the X3, but with coupe-inspired styling similar to the BMW X6. BMW calls the result of this strange cross-breeding a “Sports Activity Coupe” — the same name it gives the X6 — but it’s a fraction of the X6’s size and price. Don’t let the word “coupe” fool you: This is an SUV with four doors and a liftgate. At its core, it’s an X3, with the same powertrain options and interior design, and the xDrive all-wheel drive functionality of an Audi – and it’s this similarity to the X3 that is both the X4’s biggest strength and biggest weakness.\n\nLike the X3, the standard engine in the base X4 xDrive28i is a 240-horsepower, turbocharged inline 4-cylinder found in many other BMW models. The xDrive35i employs the venerable 300-hp, turbocharged inline six-cylinder. Compare the X4 with the X3 here. Both engines pair with an equally impressive eight-speed automatic transmission and standard all-wheel drive. Both the 28i and 35i variants of the BMW X4 have three trim levels that BMW calls “lines”: a base model, a luxury-oriented xLine and a performance-oriented M Sport. I tested the X4 xDrive35i M Sport. The M Sport adds an aerodynamic package, sport suspension and unique interior appointments. Our test car stickered at $55,300, including a $950 destination fee.\n\nExterior & Styling\nBMW’s X6 isn’t exactly tearing up the sales charts; it’s BMW’s lowest-volume SUV. It’s strange, then, that we’re seeing the same stylistic focus appear in BMW’s lineup again with the X4. (The coupe-like sloping roofline is also a popular trend among luxury sedans, like the BMW Gran Coupe series and Mercedes-Benz’s CLS-Class.)\n\nMercedes also wants in on this strange niche of coupe-styled SUVs, if the recently introduced GLE Coupe is any indication. Land Rover’s Range Rover’s Evoque, though, is actually available with two doors, so it wins the battle of most coupelike SUV. Compare the X4 with the X6 and Evoque here.\n\nThe X4 is closer in size to the BMW X3 or four-door Evoque than it is to the X6 or Mercedes’ GLE coupe. It’s 0.5 inches longer than the X3 and 2.2 inches lower at the roof. BMW went for an aggressive, muscular appearance with the X4’s front styling by using large air intakes on the outer edges and defined character lines along the body side. The X4 M Sport is a spot-on impersonation of the $100,000 BMW X6 M, the automaker’s 567-hp rocket-ship SUV. M Sport X4s wear unique front, side and rear styling plus 19-inch wheels, with the option of 20-inch wheels.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe BMW X4’s front seats are mounted 0.8 inches lower than the X3’s, and rear passengers sit 1.1 inches lower to create a carlike seating position. There’s still a lot of SUV characteristics in the handling department, even with the performance-oriented M Sport suspension.\n\nThe M Sport’s aggressively tuned sport suspension and 19-inch alloy wheels with run-flat tires give the BMW X4 a stiff, bouncy ride quality that’s not for the faint of heart. The tightly tuned suspension might be more trouble than it’s worth, considering the X4 still drives a tad on the hefty side. It has a nose-heavy disposition, though body motion is well-controlled, and there’s no question this car is connected to the road, letting drivers know they’re in a sporty SUV.\n\nThe M Sport’s fixed-firmness suspension is replaceable with an optional $1,000 Dynamic Damper Control suspension featuring adjustable firmness. How the X4 handles with its sport suspension is still impressive for an SUV, but it doesn’t go above and beyond the X3’s capabilities. Land Rover’s Evoque is 450 pounds lighter than the X4 (4,130 pounds versus 3,680 pounds) and that comes across in how light-footed and nimble the Evoque drives.\n\nLike the X3, the turbocharged, 300-hp six-cylinder in the BMW X4 xDrive35i is a potent engine with enough grunt to make mundane errands entertaining. The responsive engine and quick-shifting eight-speed automatic transmission always keep passing power right at your toe tips, so there’s no waiting for a downshift when it’s time to light off and go. Acceleration is especially vigorous in the BMW’s sportier modes. They’re selectable via a toggle switch and dial up accelerator and transmission response from mild (in Eco Pro and Comfort) to wild (in Sport and Sport+ modes).\n\nUnlike the X3, all-wheel drive is standard in the BMW X4. The powertrain is a fantastic combination, but also not very different from the X3. BMW says the X4 xDrive35i does zero to 60 mph in 5.2 seconds, while the X3 gets there in 5.3 seconds. One tenth of a second is not felt in the seat of your pants.\n\nThe BMW X4’s two flavors include the xDrive35i, which has EPA-estimated mileage of 22 mpg combined (it’s 19/27 mpg city/highway), and the 23-mpg xDrive28i (20/28 mpg city/highway). The Evoque is rated 24 mpg combined (21/30 mpg), while the X3 is expected to get 24 mpg combined (21/28 mpg) with the four-cylinder and either rear- or all-wheel drive. The six-cylinder X3 is rated 21 mpg combined (19/26 mpg). A stop-start feature shuts the X4’s engine off automatically to save fuel when the car is stopped. Its execution in the X4 is a little rough, but drivers who dislike it can turn the feature off.\n\nInterior\nYou can’t have your cake and eat it too when it comes to the X4’s coupelike shape. The sloping roofline decreases backseat headroom and inhibits visibility. (At this point, the X4 really is beginning to sound more like a coupe than an SUV.) Rear headroom shrinks from 39.1 inches in the X3 to 37.4 inches in the X4, though other backseat dimensions remain unchanged. Even up front there’s 0.7 inches less headroom than the X3 offers.\n\nPerhaps the most noticeable consequence of the BMW X4’s coupe styling is rearward visibility. A small rear window, thick body pillars and a miniscule piece of glass behind the back door windows offer limited visibility; the Evoque and X3 have less limiting rear sightlines. The roofline’s intrusion into backseat space requires passengers to duck more than they normally would to get in. The backseat features two bucket seats and a raised middle seat, as opposed to the X3’s flat bench.\n\nThe interior design is nearly identical to the X3, with a classy execution of material quality and fit and finish. The M Sport features brushed aluminum trim, an M steering wheel and upgraded headliner material. On the downside, there isn’t much distinction between this and the X3, and genuine leather still isn’t a standard feature; imitation leather comes standard, while leather is a $1,450 option or available as part of a $2,200 Premium Package.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nBMW’s iDrive system has come a long way since its much-maligned initial years. I still don’t find the knob-based controller for the multimedia and vehicle functions the easiest to use, but BMW seems to improve its function incrementally with each new version. In the BMW X4, it’s still easy to get lost in the menus despite shortcut and back buttons. Gaining familiarity with the system’s multiple screens and pages takes a good amount of time and patience.\n\nOur X4 test car had BMW’s optional, $500 Enhanced Bluetooth and Smartphone Integration adapter. It’s a feature that docks the phone securely inside the center storage console and uses the car’s cellular antenna for its signal. It also charges the phone and gives full function to the multimedia and navigation system. It’s a much cleaner installation than a long cord and keeps the center storage console tidy. Various adapters are available to work with different phones.\n\nCargo & Storage\nCargo room behind the backseat is down from the X3’s 19.4 cubic feet to 17.7 cubic feet, and overall cargo volume is down from 56.5 cubic feet to 49.4 cubic feet. The Evoque has a smaller exterior footprint than the BMW X4 by more than a foot in length yet has more cargo room, at 20.3 cubic feet or a maximum 50.1 cubic feet.\n\nA power liftgate is a standard feature just like on the X3, though a rear window wiper is not (one isn’t even offered). BMW really went for the coupe motif by excluding the rear wiper, but I wanted one during my drive time to clear snow and debris from the back window.\n\nSafety\nThe X4 had not yet been crash-tested at the time of publishing. Optional advanced safety features include forward collision warning with automated braking, lane departure warning, a “surround-view” backup camera with a top-down view of the car, plus front and rear parking sensors. You can see a full list of safety features here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nA starting price of $45,650 for a four-cylinder BMW X4 is $4,200 more than an all-wheel-drive, four-cylinder X3. Beyond an all-wheel-drive X3’s standard equipment, the X4 adds high-intensity discharge headlights with adaptive function, rear parking sensors and variable sport steering.\n\nStep up to the more-powerful engine, and the X4 xDrive35i costs $48,950. The M Sport Line adds $1,900 ($2,300 on four-cylinder models), the Driver Assistance Package (with the backup camera, adaptive cruise control and front parking sensors) is $700, heated seats are $500, and our test car’s $2,200 Premium Package included smart keyless access, lumbar support, leather seats and a one-year satellite radio subscription.\n\nThe tab added up quickly and the car we tested, at $55,300, didn’t have navigation, smartphone app integration or a much-needed blind spot warning system. A few things it had that I’d do without include the M Sport Line and even the more-powerful engine. The 2.0-liter four-cylinder is such a good engine in other BMW products, it makes the six-cylinder a hard sell; I have a hard time believing it wouldn’t do well in the BMW X4. Zero to 60 mph is still a respectable 6 seconds for the smaller engine, compared with 5.2 seconds for the big guy.\n\nAt its core, the BMW X4 is mostly a design exercise. Maybe shoppers will flock to the coupelike SUV in the X4 simply because it’s in a more reasonable price range now, coming in a whopping $15,000 less than an X6. You’d really have to be in love with the look, though, to fork over an extra $4,200 given the BMW X4 isn’t that different from the already exceptional X3. Styling and a few features are the only differences, and the negatives of decreased room and visibility are hard to ignore in day-to-day driving.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 BMW X4?\n\nThe BMW X4 is a five-seat luxury compact SUV with coupelike styling and four doors. Power comes from a standard 248-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, while the M40i gets a 382-hp, turbo 3.0-liter inline-six with a 48-volt mild-hybrid system that recaptures brake energy. The high-performance X4 M and X4 M Competition get a turbo 3.0-liter six-cylinder that’s rated at 473 hp in the standard M and 503 hp in the Competition version. Every engine works with an eight-speed automatic transmission, and all-wheel drive is standard.

      "expert_review": "While its more formal, upright X3 sibling is all-new for the 2025 model year, the fastback BMW X4 soldiers on basically unchanged for another year. The only updates BMW is making to the compact luxury SUV for 2025 are adding heated front seats as standard equipment and rolling remote start into a pair of option packages. Accordingly, the X4’s base price only climbs $480 from 2024, with the model now starting at $56,475 (all prices include $1,175 destination).\n\nRelated: Which Trim Level of the 2025 BMW X3 Should You Buy?\n\nPowertrain Specs and MPG\n\nBMW offers the X4 with a variety of engines, the most powerful more than doubling the output of the least. Motivating the entry-level X4 xDrive30i is a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that makes 248 horsepower and 258 pounds-feet of torque. The X4 M40i upgrades to a 382-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six generating 369 pounds-feet. A different turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six powers the X4 M; it cranks out 473 hp and 457 pounds-feet in standard guise, but with the Competition Package, output grows to 503 hp and 479 pounds-feet of torque.\n\nRegardless of engine, every X4 has an eight-speed automatic transmission and standard all-wheel drive. The xDrive30i returns an EPA-estimated 21/27/24 mpg city/highway/combined. Thanks in part to 48-volt mild-hybrid assistance, the M40i asks relatively little for its additional 134 hp, returning 22/26/23 mpg. But the M takes a hit, dropping to 15/20/17 mpg for both the standard-output version and Competition Package.\n\nPricing and Availability\n\nThe 2025 BMW X4 is on sale now. Full line pricing is as follows:\n\nxDrive30i: $56,475\nM40i: $67,875\nX4 M: $80,275\nSafety Features and Trim Levels\n\nStandard safety technologies on the 2025 BMW X4 include forward collision alert with automatic emergency braking, lane-centering steering, blind spot monitoring, adaptive cruise control, road-sign recognition, and front and rear parking sensors.\n\nThe X4 xDrive30i rides on 19-inch wheels and features LED exterior lighting, a panoramic moonroof, a power liftgate, rain-sensing windshield wipers, and keyless entry and starting. Inside, it’s upholstered in synthetic leather and boasts power-adjustable and heated front seats, dual-zone automatic climate control, ambient lighting, 12 speakers, and a 10.25-inch touchscreen with navigation, Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and satellite radio.\n\nThe M40i keeps its extra power in check with adaptive dampers and upgraded M Sport brakes with blue calipers. Revised front and rear bumpers and black exterior trim set it apart visually, as do adaptive headlights that turn with the steering wheel and unique interior trim.\n\nIn addition to its tremendous output, the X4 M boasts a sport-tuned adaptive suspension and AWD system, 20-inch wheels, aggressive bumpers at both ends and four exhaust outlets at the back. Its cabin gains sport seats, synthetic leather dash paneling, carbon-fiber interior trim, a unique gauge cluster and a 16-speaker Harman Kardon sound system. The $7,000 Competition Package ups engine output and adds dark exterior accents, the M Sport exhaust system, and M Sport seats and seat belts.\n\nOther than the different engines, BMW doesn’t do trim levels, instead offering numerous packages and stand-alone options across the X4 line. The Driving Assistance Professional Package adds Active Driving Assistant Pro, a hands-on semi-autonomous system that combines adaptive cruise control with lane-centering steering, as well as emergency steering assist and traffic jam assist for hands-off steering below 40 mph. The Parking Assistance Package adds a 360-degree parking camera and semi-automated parking (the X4 will steer itself, but the driver is responsible for operating the gearshift and pedals), while the Premium Package includes a head-up display and heated steering wheel. Stand-alone options include heated outboard rear seats, ventilated front seats, wireless phone charging and the 16-speaker Harman Kardon sound system on the non-M models.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2019 BMW X4: 8 Things We Like and 2 Things We Don’t\n2024 J.D.

      "expert_review": "BMW announced the 2022 X4 has been updated alongside its fraternal twin, the X3 with which it shares most of its DNA. Although the two models are similar in their underpinnings, performance and technology features, the X4 is the sportier sibling thanks to its coupelike exterior that sits lower and wider than the X3. For 2022, the BMW X4 gets refreshed styling, tech improvements, a mild-hybrid system for the M40i model and an enhanced performance-focused M model.\n\nRelated: 2022 BMW X3 Lineup Adds Electrification, Torque, Technology\n\n1.   Fresh Face and Rear\n\nThe 2022 BMW X4 gets styling tweaks to its front and rear end including a new grille design, updated bumpers, headlights and taillights. The X4 sports an aluminum mesh variant of BMW’s signature kidney grille that grows larger in the refresh. While the grille is enlarged, the X4’s LED headlights shrink to become 0.4 inches thinner, and a redesigned front bumper with vertical air intakes completes the face-lift.\n\nThe rear of the BMW X4 is updated with redesigned full-LED taillights with integrated horizontal turn signal bars, vertical air intakes arranged in a triangular design and new sportier exhaust trim.\n\nThe BMW X4 M40i gets some unique exterior elements to emphasize its performance leanings. The front bumper sports a large opening to help cool the engine, transmission and brake system. Aerodynamic features include air breathers on the front fenders and the M-exclusive exterior mirrors that reduce air resistance. The BMW X4 M40i also gets a new rear bumper with an anvil-shaped insert and a high-gloss black rear spoiler.\n\n2.   Refined Infotainment and Safety Tech\n\nFor 2022, BMW updates the X4 with a free-standing central control display borrowed from its 4 Series stablemate. Standard on the X4 is BMW’s Live Cockpit Professional that features a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster and a touchscreen display of the same size. Infotainment is updated with BMW’s latest iDrive 7 multimedia system that comes with enhanced navigation, media content, status displays for the driver-assistance systems and a 3D view.\n\nAn updated Driving Assistant Professional Package enhances the X4’s driver-assist technology suite that includes adaptive cruise control with stop and go, and an active lane-keeping assist system. The lane-keeping system is now able to recognize necessary lane changes as part of the navigation guidance and will indicate the need for a lane change. The driver can then carry out the lane change with the help of the lane assist. BMW’s Parking Assistance Package also adds a backup assistant feature to navigate tight spaces.\n\n3.  New Mild-Hybrid System \n\nThe 382-horsepower BMW X4 M40i gains a 48-volt mild-hybrid system for 2022, helping it recuperate brake energy. When the accelerator pedal is released, the generator converts the kinetic energy into electricity, which is stored in the battery. The energy from the 48-volt battery is then used to supply the electrically operated vehicle functions and generates additional drive power. The 48-volt starter generator supports the combustion engine for optimized efficiency and creates up to 11 hp for improved acceleration.\n\nThe mild-hybrid system also helps improve the comfort of the stop-start system in the M40i, according to BMW, thanks to reduced vibration. The system allows the combustion engine to be switched off when the vehicle’s speed drops below 9 mph, and a gliding function lets the engine switch off completely between speeds of 15-99 mph.\n\n4.  M Is for ‘More Torque’\n\nThe BMW X4 M and X4 M Competition are the SUV’s performance variants. With its turbocharged 3.0-liter engine, the current 2021 BMW X4 M puts out 473 hp and 442 pounds-feet of torque, while the M Competition boosts hp to 503 and also makes 442 pounds-feet of torque. The newly tuned engine for 2022 increases the torque output to 457 pounds-feet in the X4 M and 479 pounds-feet in the X4 M Competition.\n\nThe increased torque production lowers the 0-60-mph acceleration time estimates of the X4 M from 4.1 seconds to 3.9 seconds and from 4.0 seconds to 3.7 seconds for the M Competition. Top speed for this model reaches 155 mph, which is increased to 177 mph when an optional M Driver’s Package is added.\n\n2022 BMW X4 | Manufacturer image\nTrims, Pricing and Release Date\n\nThe 2022 BMW X4 xDrive30i is powered by a 248-hp, turbo 2.0-liter engine, and the X4 M40i gets a turbo 3.0-liter to produce 382 hp. Under the hood of the X4 M is a 473-hp six-cylinder, while the X4 M Competition tops the lineup with a 503-hp six-cylinder. The X4 xDrive30i, X4 M40i and X4 M all come standard with all-wheel drive.\n\nProduction for the 2022 BMW X4 begins in August and late summer for the X4 M with a dealership arrival date set for September. The starting price for each model is listed below and includes a $955 destination charge.\n\n2022 BMW X4 xDrive30i: $52,795\n2022 BMW X4 M40i: $63,395\n2022 BMW X4 M: $74,395\n\nMore From Cars.com: \n\nWhat’s New for BMW in 2021?\n2019 BMW X4 M40i Review — Still Nutty, But Easier to Live With\nBMW Makes SiriusXM Standard on All 2021 Models\n2019 BMW X4: 8 Things We Like and 2 Things We Don’t\nMore Luxury Vehicle News\n\nRelated Video: 2020 BMW X1 xDrive28i: Virtual Test Drive\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: New styling and a boost to the wheelbase make the new X4 slightly less weird, decidedly more fun and marginally more desirable than before.\n\nVersus the competition:  There’s one vehicle the X4 is meant to fight: the equally silly Mercedes-Benz GLC Coupe, against which it stacks up toe-to-toe in nearly every attribute but ultimately succumbs to the Benz’s ritzier interior appointments. The Porsche Macan somewhat qualifies as a competitor, but it generally targets a different buyer.\n\nThe BMW X4 has always been a weird one. Like the larger X6, it builds off a perfectly good crossover SUV (the X3 in this case), takes away functionality by chopping down the roofline and cargo area in the name of a sporty profile, then charges you more money for the privilege of having less utility in your sport utility vehicle. Then BMW insists you call it a “coupe” — despite the fact that it has four full doors — thanks to its slammed profile. So what is it? A tall hatchback sedan? Some kind of sporty SUV that favors the S in the equation more than the U?\n\nThis is the second generation of the X4. It’s back for 2019 with a stretched chassis that adds more length and wheelbase, plus restyled looks that make it a bit less weird than before. Dynamically, the 2018 X4 was a lot of fun in its higher-performance M40i version. Do the improvements balance out the new one’s remaining shortcomings?\n\nIt Looks Better\n\nBMW added 3 inches to the X4’s length, including 2 inches to the wheelbase, and the effect on the overall look is a definite improvement; it doesn’t have that hunchback look the outgoing model suffered from. The new one is sleeker, proportioned better and feels lower overall. The more balanced styling is one factor making the new X4 more desirable.\n\nI drove an X4 M40i, which is the sportier version of the X4 (a base xDrive30i can be had with a four-cylinder engine and without all the sporty equipment). The M40i includes an aerodynamic kit with more aggressive styling bits for the bumpers and sills, plus a “shadowline” exterior trim package that blacks out most of the exterior chrome. By contrast, the latest Mercedes-Benz GLC300 Coupe still looks odd, with a bulbous rear end that doesn’t do it any favors despite providing some decent headroom for backseat occupants. Porsche seems to have found a more acceptable shape in its Macan despite overall similar proportions and roofline.\n\nIt Drives Better\n\nThe M40i I drove was powered by a 355-horsepower, turbocharged inline-six-cylinder engine. It was also blessed with an adaptive sport suspension, larger M Sport brakes, a quick-shifting eight-speed automatic transmission and several customizable drive modes that allow you to set everything exactly how you like it.\n\nAlong with the improvement to the X4’s looks comes a decided improvement to its behavior. The M40i is gnarly fast, with immediacy to its power delivery that will have you dipping into the throttle often just to get the rush from its snorty acceleration. (BMW reports a zero-to-60-mph time of just 4.6 seconds.) Steering is much more traditional BMW than many of the company’s current products, with a connected, direct feel that’s lacking in bigger vehicles like the X5.\n\nBody control is impressive; hustle the X4 around a track or down your favorite back road, and it moves with smart authority. Out on the highway, the damping is excellent. Add in the X4’s quiet ride and you’ll find yourself traveling much more rapidly than you thought you were going.\n\nRide quality is on the firm side, even in Comfort drive mode, thanks to big wheels and high-performance tires. But I like that the modes actually change the characteristics of the car; the Sport modes do in fact give the vehicle a sporty feel, and there’s even a Sport Individual setting that allows you to change various factors independently. I kept the steering and engine performance in the highest Sport mode but left the transmission and suspension in Comfort mode, allowing me responsive power and sharp steering feel without a punishing ride or having the transmission constantly in a gear too low for normal driving. The only annoying part was I had to reselect those modes every time I started the car; there’s no memory function for this feature.\n\nThe X4 stacks up well versus the Mercedes-Benz GLC Coupe, with models at every level designed to go toe-to-toe with BMW’s chief German rival. There’s a GLC300 Coupe with a turbocharged four-cylinder engine that’s meant to go up against the X4 xDrive30i, and there’s an AMG GLC43 Coupe with a twin-turbo V-6 there to match up against the X4 M40i. The GLC63 Coupe brings a twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8 to the party, while the GLC63 S Coupe amps that engine up to max performance. Above the X4 M40i, however, BMW fights back with the X4M and X4M Competition variants, though it skips the V-8 in favor of even hairier versions of the turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six.\n\nFuel economy ratings are decent for the X4 M40i: the EPA rates the crossover  20/27/23 mpg city/highway/combined. My week with the X4 saw an overall combined rating of 24 mpg despite me driving it fairly aggressively, especially on the highway. It beats out its main rival, the Mercedes-AMG GLC43 Coupe, which is rated 19/24/21 mpg despite the Benz having an extra cog in its nine-speed transmission versus the BMW’s eight-speed unit.\n\nIt Feels Better Inside\n\nAlong with exterior updates, the X4 got some welcome interior spiffs, as well. There’s a new dash and door design employing more high-grade materials, and it all looks much ritzier than before. The leather (both real and artificial) covering the interior feels good to the touch, and the diamond-pattern aluminum trim is unique and appealing. It’s not quite to the level of sophistication seen in the Mercedes-Benz GLC Coupe, but that sort of judgment is increasingly becoming more a matter of taste and preference than one of blatant superiority. Thankfully, BMW hasn’t yet fallen into the “touchscreen everything” trap, so there are actual high-quality buttons to push and knobs to twist, unlike in the latest Land Rovers and Jaguars.\n\nThe biggest improvement comes in the backseat, which gains some legroom and headroom and is a much more comfortable and usable place than it used to be. You still pay a price for that sporty roof, however, with backseat headroom coming in around 2 inches less in the X4 than in the X3 SUV on which it’s based. Cargo room is similarly compromised by the sloping rear window, which curtails the amount of stuff you can carry. At 18.5 cubic feet, the X4 has 10 cubic feet less space behind the backseat than the X3, and 12.2 fewer cubic feet when it comes to total cargo room (50.5 in the X4) with the seats folded. That said, it still has more cargo room behind the backseat than the Macan or the GLC Coupe, though not by much.\n\nThe latest multimedia system from BMW also works well, with one major caveat: In order to access Apple CarPlay, you must connect via Bluetooth to the car’s system — a process that’s neither terribly quick nor intuitive. Simply plugging into the USB cable doesn’t do it — the connection has to be wireless. While this might sound like a decent convenience — especially combined with a wireless charging pad in the center console, allowing you to just drop your phone into that pad and automatically connect to CarPlay — we’ve had mixed success with the connection. Sometimes it drops inexplicably and can’t be reestablished despite the car and phone saying both are connected. This has happened in several new BMWs I’ve driven, with more than one phone, yet other staffers have reported no such issues.\n\nTo add more insult to the mix, BMW makes you pay for Apple CarPlay — an ongoing subscription, no less — after an initial free trial period. Requiring payment for a feature that’s standard in some of the cheapest cars on the planet — only to have it not work very well — is not cool, BMW. At least the big screen in the BMW allows for better CarPlay displays than you get on most smaller screens. BMW still doesn’t support Android Auto at all.\n\nThe 2019 BMW X4 has not been crash-tested by either the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. Standard safety equipment is sparse by modern standards — as is common in German luxury cars, where most safety technology costs extra. You get BMW’s Active Protection System standard, which detects an imminent collision and pretensions safety belts, activates a post-crash braking system and closes the windows. The system also includes a fatigue sensor. Active Guard, with front collision warning, pedestrian detection and autonomous braking, is also included. Features like blind spot and lane departure warning are options, however, as is active parking and a 360-degree camera system.\n\nIt’s Not Priced Any Better\n\nBMW offers up two X4 models for 2019, starting with the four-cylinder X4 xDrive30i at $51,445 (all prices include destination fees). It has a much less powerful engine but still comes with all-wheel drive. The model I tested was a six-cylinder X4 M40i that also has standard all-wheel drive; it starts 10 grand more than the base model, at $61,445. A third version comes for the 2020 model year: the X4 M, featuring an even higher output version of the inline-six and a starting price of $74,395.\n\nMy test car included a few options, such as a Driving Assistance Package, Premium Package, Executive Package, 20-inch wheels with summer tires, wireless smartphone charging and a Harman Kardon premium audio system. It rang up a hefty grand total of $69,170.\n\nCompetitors are very closely matched in price and specs. The Mercedes-AMG GLC43 Coupe starts at $62,195 for a car with just as much power, standard all-wheel drive and an extra gear in its transmission. The Porsche Macan S also joins the fight, priced at $59,850 and featuring a V-6 that isn’t quite as powerful as either the BMW or Mercedes, and only a seven-speed automatic transmission. The mission of all three of these sporty quasi-SUVs is the same: on-road style over substance, fashion over utility. That said, BMW has upped its game with the latest X4, creating a vehicle that’s better-looking, more useful and a greater pleasure to drive.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: New styling and a boost to the wheelbase make the new X4 slightly less weird, decidedly more fun and marginally more desirable than before.\n\nVersus the competition:  There’s one vehicle the X4 is meant to fight: the equally silly Mercedes-Benz GLC Coupe, against which it stacks up toe-to-toe in nearly every attribute but ultimately succumbs to the Benz’s ritzier interior appointments. The Porsche Macan somewhat qualifies as a competitor, but it generally targets a different buyer.\n\nThe BMW X4 has always been a weird one. Like the larger X6, it builds off a perfectly good crossover SUV (the X3 in this case), takes away functionality by chopping down the roofline and cargo area in the name of a sporty profile, then charges you more money for the privilege of having less utility in your sport utility vehicle. Then BMW insists you call it a “coupe” — despite the fact that it has four full doors — thanks to its slammed profile. So what is it? A tall hatchback sedan? Some kind of sporty SUV that favors the S in the equation more than the U?\n\nThis is the second generation of the X4. It’s back for 2019 with a stretched chassis that adds more length and wheelbase, plus restyled looks that make it a bit less weird than before. Dynamically, the 2018 X4 was a lot of fun in its higher-performance M40i version. Do the improvements balance out the new one’s remaining shortcomings?\n\nIt Looks Better\n\nBMW added 3 inches to the X4’s length, including 2 inches to the wheelbase, and the effect on the overall look is a definite improvement; it doesn’t have that hunchback look the outgoing model suffered from. The new one is sleeker, proportioned better and feels lower overall. The more balanced styling is one factor making the new X4 more desirable.\n\nI drove an X4 M40i, which is the sportier version of the X4 (a base xDrive30i can be had with a four-cylinder engine and without all the sporty equipment). The M40i includes an aerodynamic kit with more aggressive styling bits for the bumpers and sills, plus a “shadowline” exterior trim package that blacks out most of the exterior chrome. By contrast, the latest Mercedes-Benz GLC300 Coupe still looks odd, with a bulbous rear end that doesn’t do it any favors despite providing some decent headroom for backseat occupants. Porsche seems to have found a more acceptable shape in its Macan despite overall similar proportions and roofline.\n\nIt Drives Better\n\nThe M40i I drove was powered by a 355-horsepower, turbocharged inline-six-cylinder engine. It was also blessed with an adaptive sport suspension, larger M Sport brakes, a quick-shifting eight-speed automatic transmission and several customizable drive modes that allow you to set everything exactly how you like it.\n\nAlong with the improvement to the X4’s looks comes a decided improvement to its behavior. The M40i is gnarly fast, with immediacy to its power delivery that will have you dipping into the throttle often just to get the rush from its snorty acceleration. (BMW reports a zero-to-60-mph time of just 4.6 seconds.) Steering is much more traditional BMW than many of the company’s current products, with a connected, direct feel that’s lacking in bigger vehicles like the X5.\n\nBody control is impressive; hustle the X4 around a track or down your favorite back road, and it moves with smart authority. Out on the highway, the damping is excellent. Add in the X4’s quiet ride and you’ll find yourself traveling much more rapidly than you thought you were going.\n\nRide quality is on the firm side, even in Comfort drive mode, thanks to big wheels and high-performance tires. But I like that the modes actually change the characteristics of the car; the Sport modes do in fact give the vehicle a sporty feel, and there’s even a Sport Individual setting that allows you to change various factors independently. I kept the steering and engine performance in the highest Sport mode but left the transmission and suspension in Comfort mode, allowing me responsive power and sharp steering feel without a punishing ride or having the transmission constantly in a gear too low for normal driving. The only annoying part was I had to reselect those modes every time I started the car; there’s no memory function for this feature.\n\nThe X4 stacks up well versus the Mercedes-Benz GLC Coupe, with models at every level designed to go toe-to-toe with BMW’s chief German rival. There’s a GLC300 Coupe with a turbocharged four-cylinder engine that’s meant to go up against the X4 xDrive30i, and there’s an AMG GLC43 Coupe with a twin-turbo V-6 there to match up against the X4 M40i. The GLC63 Coupe brings a twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8 to the party, while the GLC63 S Coupe amps that engine up to max performance. Above the X4 M40i, however, BMW fights back with the X4M and X4M Competition variants, though it skips the V-8 in favor of even hairier versions of the turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six.\n\nFuel economy ratings are decent for the X4 M40i: the EPA rates the crossover  20/27/23 mpg city/highway/combined. My week with the X4 saw an overall combined rating of 24 mpg despite me driving it fairly aggressively, especially on the highway. It beats out its main rival, the Mercedes-AMG GLC43 Coupe, which is rated 19/24/21 mpg despite the Benz having an extra cog in its nine-speed transmission versus the BMW’s eight-speed unit.\n\nIt Feels Better Inside\n\nAlong with exterior updates, the X4 got some welcome interior spiffs, as well. There’s a new dash and door design employing more high-grade materials, and it all looks much ritzier than before. The leather (both real and artificial) covering the interior feels good to the touch, and the diamond-pattern aluminum trim is unique and appealing. It’s not quite to the level of sophistication seen in the Mercedes-Benz GLC Coupe, but that sort of judgment is increasingly becoming more a matter of taste and preference than one of blatant superiority. Thankfully, BMW hasn’t yet fallen into the “touchscreen everything” trap, so there are actual high-quality buttons to push and knobs to twist, unlike in the latest Land Rovers and Jaguars.\n\nThe biggest improvement comes in the backseat, which gains some legroom and headroom and is a much more comfortable and usable place than it used to be. You still pay a price for that sporty roof, however, with backseat headroom coming in around 2 inches less in the X4 than in the X3 SUV on which it’s based. Cargo room is similarly compromised by the sloping rear window, which curtails the amount of stuff you can carry. At 18.5 cubic feet, the X4 has 10 cubic feet less space behind the backseat than the X3, and 12.2 fewer cubic feet when it comes to total cargo room (50.5 in the X4) with the seats folded. That said, it still has more cargo room behind the backseat than the Macan or the GLC Coupe, though not by much.\n\nThe latest multimedia system from BMW also works well, with one major caveat: In order to access Apple CarPlay, you must connect via Bluetooth to the car’s system — a process that’s neither terribly quick nor intuitive. Simply plugging into the USB cable doesn’t do it — the connection has to be wireless. While this might sound like a decent convenience — especially combined with a wireless charging pad in the center console, allowing you to just drop your phone into that pad and automatically connect to CarPlay — we’ve had mixed success with the connection. Sometimes it drops inexplicably and can’t be reestablished despite the car and phone saying both are connected. This has happened in several new BMWs I’ve driven, with more than one phone, yet other staffers have reported no such issues.\n\nTo add more insult to the mix, BMW makes you pay for Apple CarPlay — an ongoing subscription, no less — after an initial free trial period. Requiring payment for a feature that’s standard in some of the cheapest cars on the planet — only to have it not work very well — is not cool, BMW. At least the big screen in the BMW allows for better CarPlay displays than you get on most smaller screens. BMW still doesn’t support Android Auto at all.\n\nThe 2019 BMW X4 has not been crash-tested by either the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. Standard safety equipment is sparse by modern standards — as is common in German luxury cars, where most safety technology costs extra. You get BMW’s Active Protection System standard, which detects an imminent collision and pretensions safety belts, activates a post-crash braking system and closes the windows. The system also includes a fatigue sensor. Active Guard, with front collision warning, pedestrian detection and autonomous braking, is also included. Features like blind spot and lane departure warning are options, however, as is active parking and a 360-degree camera system.\n\nIt’s Not Priced Any Better\n\nBMW offers up two X4 models for 2019, starting with the four-cylinder X4 xDrive30i at $51,445 (all prices include destination fees). It has a much less powerful engine but still comes with all-wheel drive. The model I tested was a six-cylinder X4 M40i that also has standard all-wheel drive; it starts 10 grand more than the base model, at $61,445. A third version comes for the 2020 model year: the X4 M, featuring an even higher output version of the inline-six and a starting price of $74,395.\n\nMy test car included a few options, such as a Driving Assistance Package, Premium Package, Executive Package, 20-inch wheels with summer tires, wireless smartphone charging and a Harman Kardon premium audio system. It rang up a hefty grand total of $69,170.\n\nCompetitors are very closely matched in price and specs. The Mercedes-AMG GLC43 Coupe starts at $62,195 for a car with just as much power, standard all-wheel drive and an extra gear in its transmission. The Porsche Macan S also joins the fight, priced at $59,850 and featuring a V-6 that isn’t quite as powerful as either the BMW or Mercedes, and only a seven-speed automatic transmission. The mission of all three of these sporty quasi-SUVs is the same: on-road style over substance, fashion over utility. That said, BMW has upped its game with the latest X4, creating a vehicle that’s better-looking, more useful and a greater pleasure to drive.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: New styling and a boost to the wheelbase make the new X4 slightly less weird, decidedly more fun and marginally more desirable than before.\n\nVersus the competition:  There’s one vehicle the X4 is meant to fight: the equally silly Mercedes-Benz GLC Coupe, against which it stacks up toe-to-toe in nearly every attribute but ultimately succumbs to the Benz’s ritzier interior appointments. The Porsche Macan somewhat qualifies as a competitor, but it generally targets a different buyer.\n\nThe BMW X4 has always been a weird one. Like the larger X6, it builds off a perfectly good crossover SUV (the X3 in this case), takes away functionality by chopping down the roofline and cargo area in the name of a sporty profile, then charges you more money for the privilege of having less utility in your sport utility vehicle. Then BMW insists you call it a “coupe” — despite the fact that it has four full doors — thanks to its slammed profile. So what is it? A tall hatchback sedan? Some kind of sporty SUV that favors the S in the equation more than the U?\n\nThis is the second generation of the X4. It’s back for 2019 with a stretched chassis that adds more length and wheelbase, plus restyled looks that make it a bit less weird than before. Dynamically, the 2018 X4 was a lot of fun in its higher-performance M40i version. Do the improvements balance out the new one’s remaining shortcomings?\n\nIt Looks Better\n\nBMW added 3 inches to the X4’s length, including 2 inches to the wheelbase, and the effect on the overall look is a definite improvement; it doesn’t have that hunchback look the outgoing model suffered from. The new one is sleeker, proportioned better and feels lower overall. The more balanced styling is one factor making the new X4 more desirable.\n\nI drove an X4 M40i, which is the sportier version of the X4 (a base xDrive30i can be had with a four-cylinder engine and without all the sporty equipment). The M40i includes an aerodynamic kit with more aggressive styling bits for the bumpers and sills, plus a “shadowline” exterior trim package that blacks out most of the exterior chrome. By contrast, the latest Mercedes-Benz GLC300 Coupe still looks odd, with a bulbous rear end that doesn’t do it any favors despite providing some decent headroom for backseat occupants. Porsche seems to have found a more acceptable shape in its Macan despite overall similar proportions and roofline.\n\nIt Drives Better\n\nThe M40i I drove was powered by a 355-horsepower, turbocharged inline-six-cylinder engine. It was also blessed with an adaptive sport suspension, larger M Sport brakes, a quick-shifting eight-speed automatic transmission and several customizable drive modes that allow you to set everything exactly how you like it.\n\nAlong with the improvement to the X4’s looks comes a decided improvement to its behavior. The M40i is gnarly fast, with immediacy to its power delivery that will have you dipping into the throttle often just to get the rush from its snorty acceleration. (BMW reports a zero-to-60-mph time of just 4.6 seconds.) Steering is much more traditional BMW than many of the company’s current products, with a connected, direct feel that’s lacking in bigger vehicles like the X5.\n\nBody control is impressive; hustle the X4 around a track or down your favorite back road, and it moves with smart authority. Out on the highway, the damping is excellent. Add in the X4’s quiet ride and you’ll find yourself traveling much more rapidly than you thought you were going.\n\nRide quality is on the firm side, even in Comfort drive mode, thanks to big wheels and high-performance tires. But I like that the modes actually change the characteristics of the car; the Sport modes do in fact give the vehicle a sporty feel, and there’s even a Sport Individual setting that allows you to change various factors independently. I kept the steering and engine performance in the highest Sport mode but left the transmission and suspension in Comfort mode, allowing me responsive power and sharp steering feel without a punishing ride or having the transmission constantly in a gear too low for normal driving. The only annoying part was I had to reselect those modes every time I started the car; there’s no memory function for this feature.\n\nThe X4 stacks up well versus the Mercedes-Benz GLC Coupe, with models at every level designed to go toe-to-toe with BMW’s chief German rival. There’s a GLC300 Coupe with a turbocharged four-cylinder engine that’s meant to go up against the X4 xDrive30i, and there’s an AMG GLC43 Coupe with a twin-turbo V-6 there to match up against the X4 M40i. The GLC63 Coupe brings a twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8 to the party, while the GLC63 S Coupe amps that engine up to max performance. Above the X4 M40i, however, BMW fights back with the X4M and X4M Competition variants, though it skips the V-8 in favor of even hairier versions of the turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six.\n\nFuel economy ratings are decent for the X4 M40i: the EPA rates the crossover  20/27/23 mpg city/highway/combined. My week with the X4 saw an overall combined rating of 24 mpg despite me driving it fairly aggressively, especially on the highway. It beats out its main rival, the Mercedes-AMG GLC43 Coupe, which is rated 19/24/21 mpg despite the Benz having an extra cog in its nine-speed transmission versus the BMW’s eight-speed unit.\n\nIt Feels Better Inside\n\nAlong with exterior updates, the X4 got some welcome interior spiffs, as well. There’s a new dash and door design employing more high-grade materials, and it all looks much ritzier than before. The leather (both real and artificial) covering the interior feels good to the touch, and the diamond-pattern aluminum trim is unique and appealing. It’s not quite to the level of sophistication seen in the Mercedes-Benz GLC Coupe, but that sort of judgment is increasingly becoming more a matter of taste and preference than one of blatant superiority. Thankfully, BMW hasn’t yet fallen into the “touchscreen everything” trap, so there are actual high-quality buttons to push and knobs to twist, unlike in the latest Land Rovers and Jaguars.\n\nThe biggest improvement comes in the backseat, which gains some legroom and headroom and is a much more comfortable and usable place than it used to be. You still pay a price for that sporty roof, however, with backseat headroom coming in around 2 inches less in the X4 than in the X3 SUV on which it’s based. Cargo room is similarly compromised by the sloping rear window, which curtails the amount of stuff you can carry. At 18.5 cubic feet, the X4 has 10 cubic feet less space behind the backseat than the X3, and 12.2 fewer cubic feet when it comes to total cargo room (50.5 in the X4) with the seats folded. That said, it still has more cargo room behind the backseat than the Macan or the GLC Coupe, though not by much.\n\nThe latest multimedia system from BMW also works well, with one major caveat: In order to access Apple CarPlay, you must connect via Bluetooth to the car’s system — a process that’s neither terribly quick nor intuitive. Simply plugging into the USB cable doesn’t do it — the connection has to be wireless. While this might sound like a decent convenience — especially combined with a wireless charging pad in the center console, allowing you to just drop your phone into that pad and automatically connect to CarPlay — we’ve had mixed success with the connection. Sometimes it drops inexplicably and can’t be reestablished despite the car and phone saying both are connected. This has happened in several new BMWs I’ve driven, with more than one phone, yet other staffers have reported no such issues.\n\nTo add more insult to the mix, BMW makes you pay for Apple CarPlay — an ongoing subscription, no less — after an initial free trial period. Requiring payment for a feature that’s standard in some of the cheapest cars on the planet — only to have it not work very well — is not cool, BMW. At least the big screen in the BMW allows for better CarPlay displays than you get on most smaller screens. BMW still doesn’t support Android Auto at all.\n\nThe 2019 BMW X4 has not been crash-tested by either the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. Standard safety equipment is sparse by modern standards — as is common in German luxury cars, where most safety technology costs extra. You get BMW’s Active Protection System standard, which detects an imminent collision and pretensions safety belts, activates a post-crash braking system and closes the windows. The system also includes a fatigue sensor. Active Guard, with front collision warning, pedestrian detection and autonomous braking, is also included. Features like blind spot and lane departure warning are options, however, as is active parking and a 360-degree camera system.\n\nIt’s Not Priced Any Better\n\nBMW offers up two X4 models for 2019, starting with the four-cylinder X4 xDrive30i at $51,445 (all prices include destination fees). It has a much less powerful engine but still comes with all-wheel drive. The model I tested was a six-cylinder X4 M40i that also has standard all-wheel drive; it starts 10 grand more than the base model, at $61,445. A third version comes for the 2020 model year: the X4 M, featuring an even higher output version of the inline-six and a starting price of $74,395.\n\nMy test car included a few options, such as a Driving Assistance Package, Premium Package, Executive Package, 20-inch wheels with summer tires, wireless smartphone charging and a Harman Kardon premium audio system. It rang up a hefty grand total of $69,170.\n\nCompetitors are very closely matched in price and specs. The Mercedes-AMG GLC43 Coupe starts at $62,195 for a car with just as much power, standard all-wheel drive and an extra gear in its transmission. The Porsche Macan S also joins the fight, priced at $59,850 and featuring a V-6 that isn’t quite as powerful as either the BMW or Mercedes, and only a seven-speed automatic transmission. The mission of all three of these sporty quasi-SUVs is the same: on-road style over substance, fashion over utility. That said, BMW has upped its game with the latest X4, creating a vehicle that’s better-looking, more useful and a greater pleasure to drive.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "I didn’t understand the BMW X4 when I first drove it. It was essentially a less functional and more expensive BMW X3 with a sloped roofline. The M40i, however, adds an extra dash of excitement, with 55 more horsepower than the X4 xDrive35i and BMW M Performance tuning that transform the X4 from a boring and pedestrian six-cylinder into something more akin to a BMW M3 SUV.\n\nFor 2017, the 355-hp M40i is the only six-cylinder version of the X4. A four-cylinder xDrive28i is the entry-level offering and there’s no longer an xDrive35i. The M40i trim, however, keeps the X4 competitive with the Porsche Macan and Jaguar F-Pace; compare specs of those with the X4 here. Mercedes-Benz is even getting into this class with its GLC300 Coupe.\n\nI drove an M40i with optional summer tires and 20-inch alloy wheels that totaled $67,495, including a $995 destination charge.\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nThe X4 has a polarizing presence, especially with the M40i-exclusive Long Beach Blue Metallic paint ($700). Some onlookers found the color gaudy, but I thought it perfectly matched the M40i’s performance edge. M40i-exclusive appearance add-ons include silver-painted mirrors, gray highlights around the lower outboard grille openings, and dual tailpipes painted black chrome.\n\n$$IMAGE-1$$\n\nHow It Drives\n\nOur test SUV wore optional 20-inch wheels with Michelin Pilot Super Sport tires ($950), a breed of tires typically reserved for performance specialists like the BMW M3/M4, Ford Mustang GT350 and Cadillac CTS-V.     \n\nThose sport tires are a hint that BMW means business with the X4 M40i. They’re a serious summer-only performance tire with plenty of grip that aren’t often included on non-dedicated sports cars. The X4 M40i isn’t quite an M vehicle like the M3 or X6 M, but it’s the next closest thing to an M car and way more aggressive than the X4 M Sport package.\n\n$$IMAGE-3$$\n\nThe M40i has 55 more horsepower than the discontinued xDrive35i, and that big bump in power is felt in the seat of your pants. Compare specs of the M40i with the 2016 BMW X4 xDrive35i here.\n\nOne of the most impressive characteristics of the retuned engine is an absence of turbo lag from the turbocharged engine. There’s no delay when accelerating from a stop or even from low speeds. The engine and traditional torque converter eight-speed automatic transmission work in harmony to blast the X4 M40i to 60 mph in 4.7 seconds, BMW says. Acceleration comes with a big punch to the gut and the kind of ferociousness that’s out of the ordinary in similarly sized sport luxury SUVs — even the Porsche Macan S. The M40i’s zero-to-60-mph time is a half-second faster than BMW’s estimates for the outgoing xDrive35i. \n\n$$IMAGE-4$$\n\nAnd boy, does this baby sing with its new exhaust. The standard sport exhaust varies exhaust noise depending on driving mode. In the most aggressive Sport Plus mode, the engine pops, crackles and wails; the sound out of the tailpipes could easily be mistaken for an exotic sports coupe.\n\nSuspension tuning is M40i-specific and uses adaptive shock absorbers with adjustable firmness that softens or stiffens the ride depending on driving mode. It also senses the SUV’s pitch and yaw to adjust damping on the fly and minimize body roll. The shocks are complemented by stronger springs and stiffer anti-roll bars, plus a more aggressive front alignment. The decidedly performance-tuned ride isn’t for the faint of heart; you’ll feel the road, for better and for worse.\n\nThe standard all-wheel drive has been tweaked to provide more torque at the rear wheels for a rear-wheel-drive handling balance. Yet even with all these suspension goodies and sticky tires, the X4 M40i feels heavy in cornering. It’s certainly planted and composed, with loads of grip, but it doesn’t like to transition quickly and it feels a little lethargic between sweeping corners, unlike the nimble Macan S.\n\nInterior\n\nPerformance chops aside, the BMW X4 remains a compromise between style and usability. The aggressive exterior styling results in a small rear window and awful rearward visibility from the driver’s seat. Backseat ingress/egress is troubling with the low roofline. Once you’ve managed to duck into the backseat, however, it’s surprisingly roomy for adults. There’s decent headroom and outboard seating comfort is much more pleasant than in the Macan’s miniscule backseat.\n\n$$IMAGE-5$$\n\nGenuine leather upholstery is standard in the M40i, unlike the outgoing xDrive35i, which came with imitation leather. The M40i has an M leather-wrapped steering wheel and M badging on the gear selector, plus sport seats and X4 M40i badging on the front doorsills.\n\nComparing interiors with the Porsche Macan, the edge goes to the Porsche — or at least to the $69,000 Macan S I previously reviewed. The Porsche’s attention to detail and generous aluminum trim, plus attractive contrast stitching, give it a more dynamic, sportier style than the X4.\n\n$$IMAGE-6$$\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nBMW’s iDrive multimedia controller system is starting to feel dated among similar control systems. The company’s flagship 7 Series sedan has gesture control and a touchscreen, but the BMW X4 uses an old multifunction knob that’s surrounded by too many buttons. It manages an interface, with layers upon layers of menus and options that still aren’t easily understood after a few days use.\n\n$$IMAGE-7$$\n\nThe X4 at least gets credit both for having traditional knobs and buttons, rather than touch-sensitive controls, and for its intuitive layout of climate controls and media interactivity. Apple CarPlay is available,  though Android Auto is not; both are the most seamless way to integrate a smartphone into a car. \n\nCargo & Storage\n\nThe BMW X4’s aggressively sloped rear affects cargo space the most. The 17.7 cubic feet of cargo space behind the backseat is unimpressive compared with the roominess of the passenger space. It’s similar to the Macan’s 17.7 cubic feet but dwarfed by the 33.5 cubic feet behind the Jaguar F-Pace’s backseat. An X3 has 27.6 cubic feet of cargo space behind the backseat.\n\nThe X4’s cargo opening is narrow and high off the ground, requiring a big lift to access the cargo area, which is then recessed below the cargo opening. \n\n$$IMAGE-8$$\n\nSafety\n\nThe X4 hadn’t been crash-tested at the time of writing. Standard features include a basic suite of side-impact and side curtain airbags but not much else, not even a backup camera. Active safety features are optional and pricey.\n\nOn base BMW X4 models, an available Driver Assistance Package includes a backup camera and front and rear parking sensors for $700, while the Driver Assistance Plus Package ($1,700) includes blind spot monitoring and a 360-degree camera, but getting it also requires adding a $1,950 navigation system. An additional $1,200 for the Adaptive Cruise Control Stop & Go plus Active Driving Assistant packages adds adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning and forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking for cars and pedestrians.\n\nChild seats fit surprisingly well in the X4’s backseat. Our certified child-seat installers say easily accessible Latch anchors help, but they had a tough time fitting our largest infant car seat, which takes up the most space; the front passenger seat had to be moved up a lot.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nA base BMW X4 M40i starts at $59,095 with destination, and ours was bulked up by these options: $700 paint, $950 Cold Weather Package (including a heated steering wheel and heated front and rear seats), a $1,900 Lighting Package (adaptive LED headlights), a $2,750 Technology Package (navigation, head-up display), $950 wheels and summer tires, a $400 backup camera and a $750 360-degree camera system.\n\nAn important consideration for the Michelin Pilot Super Sport tires, or any dedicated summer performance tire, is to avoid driving them in cold weather. Be prepared to buy a set of winter or all-season tires for winter driving — and with 20-inch wheels, that’s not going to be cheap. (Consider a set of higher-profile winter tires on inexpensive rims of their own if it’s possible.)\n\nThe X4 M40i elevates the SUV’s performance — and price — so much that a Porsche Macan S is one of its closest competitors. They couldn’t drive more differently, however. Porsche’s Macan is an extremely refined and poised performance SUV, while the X4 M40i has a heavy-metal, rip-your-head-off kind of aggressiveness. Also noteworthy, the M40i’s standard Harman Kardon stereo belts heavy metal out its speakers exquisitely well.\n\nBMW doesn’t sell many X4s in relation to its bread-and-butter X3 (about 4,100 year-to-date versus 34,000 of the X3), so the sports-minded SUV is definitely a niche product. My general rule is that if something is more expensive and less usable, it better have more flash and pizzazz, and the X4 M40i is definitely that extra something the BMW X4 needed.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 BMW X4?\n\nThe BMW X4 is a five-seat compact luxury SUV with coupe-like styling and four doors. Power comes from a standard 248-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, while the M40i gets a 382-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six with a 48-volt mild-hybrid system that recaptures brake energy. The high-performance X4 M and X4 M Competition get a turbocharged 3.0-liter six-cylinder that’s rated at 473 hp in the standard M model and 503 hp in the Competition version. Every engine works with an eight-speed automatic transmission, and all-wheel drive is standard. Competitors include the Mercedes-Benz GLC-Class and Land Rover Range Rover Evoque.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 BMW X4?\n\nThe X4 was refreshed for 2022 and sees no notable changes this year.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 BMW X4 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nPanoramic moonroof\nPower liftgate\nForward collision warning with city collision mitigation\nNavigation with 12.3-inch touchscreen\nDigital instrument panel\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nHeated steering wheel\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nWireless device charging\nWi-Fi hot spot (data subscription required after trial)\nHarman Kardon surround-sound system\nHead-up display\n360-degree camera system\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nAdaptive suspension\nAdaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability\nLane departure steering assist\nShould I Buy the 2024 BMW X4?\n\nIf you’re looking for a sporty alternative to a traditional compact luxury SUV, the X4 is worth a look thanks to its strong available engines and athletic handling. You pay a lot for it, however, and get less utility for your money given the chunk of space that raked roofline takes out of the cargo area.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in April 2015 about the 2015 BMW X4. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2016, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe sleekly styled 2015 BMW X4 doesn’t differentiate itself enough from the excellent-driving X3 to overlook its decreased usability and bloated price tag.\n\nThe 2015 BMW X4 is an all-new model based on the luxury automaker’s second-best-selling SUV, the X3, but with coupe-inspired styling similar to the BMW X6. BMW calls the result of this strange cross-breeding a “Sports Activity Coupe” — the same name it gives the X6 — but it’s a fraction of the X6’s size and price. Don’t let the word “coupe” fool you: This is an SUV with four doors and a liftgate. At its core, it’s an X3, with the same powertrain options and interior design, and it’s this similarity to the X3 that is both the X4’s biggest strength and biggest weakness.\n\nLike the X3, the standard engine in the base X4 xDrive28i is a 240-horsepower, turbocharged four-cylinder found in many other BMW models. The xDrive35i employs the venerable 300-hp, turbocharged six-cylinder. Compare the X4 with the X3 here. Both engines pair with an equally impressive eight-speed automatic transmission and standard all-wheel drive. Both the 28i and 35i variants of the X4 have three trim levels that BMW calls “lines”: a base model, a luxury-oriented xLine and a performance-oriented M Sport. I tested the X4 xDrive35i M Sport. The M Sport adds an aerodynamic package, sport suspension and unique interior appointments. Our test car stickered at $55,300, including a $950 destination fee.\n\nExterior & Styling\nBMW’s X6 isn’t exactly tearing up the sales charts; it’s BMW’s lowest-volume SUV. It’s strange, then, that we’re seeing the same stylistic focus appear in BMW’s lineup again with the X4. (The coupelike sloping roofline is also a popular trend among luxury sedans, like the BMW Gran Coupe series and Mercedes-Benz’s CLS-Class.)\n\nMercedes also wants in on this strange niche of coupe-styled SUVs, if the recently introduced GLE Coupe is any indication. Land Rover’s Range Rover’s Evoque, though, is actually available with two doors, so it wins the battle of most coupelike SUV. Compare the X4 with the X6 and Evoque here.\n\nThe X4 is closer in size to the BMW X3 or four-door Evoque than it is to the X6 or Mercedes’ GLE coupe. It’s 0.5 inches longer than the X3 and 2.2 inches lower at the roof. BMW went for an aggressive, muscular appearance with the X4’s front styling by using large air intakes on the outer edges and defined character lines along the body side. The X4 M Sport is a spot-on impersonation of the $100,000 BMW X6 M, the automaker’s 567-hp rocket-ship SUV. M Sport X4s wear unique front, side and rear styling plus 19-inch wheels, with the option of 20-inch wheels.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe X4’s front seats are mounted 0.8 inches lower than the X3’s, and rear passengers sit 1.1 inches lower to create a carlike seating position. There’s still a lot of SUV characteristics in the handling department, even with the performance-oriented M Sport suspension.\n\nThe M Sport’s aggressively tuned sport suspension and 19-inch wheels give the X4 a stiff, bouncy ride quality that’s not for the faint of heart. The tightly tuned suspension might be more trouble than it’s worth, considering the X4 still drives a tad on the hefty side. It has a nose-heavy disposition, though body motion is well-controlled, and there’s no question this car is connected to the road, letting drivers know they’re in a sporty SUV.\n\nThe M Sport’s fixed-firmness suspension is replaceable with an optional $1,000 Dynamic Damper Control suspension featuring adjustable firmness. How the X4 handles with its sport suspension is still impressive for an SUV, but it doesn’t go above and beyond the X3’s capabilities. Land Rover’s Evoque is 450 pounds lighter than the X4 (4,130 pounds versus 3,680 pounds) and that comes across in how light-footed and nimble the Evoque drives.\n\nLike the X3, the turbocharged, 300-hp six-cylinder in the X4 xDrive35i is a potent engine with enough grunt to make mundane errands entertaining. The responsive engine and quick-shifting eight-speed automatic transmission always keep passing power right at your toe tips, so there’s no waiting for a downshift when it’s time to light off and go. Acceleration is especially vigorous in the BMW’s sportier modes. They’re selectable via a toggle switch and dial up accelerator and transmission response from mild (in Eco Pro and Comfort) to wild (in Sport and Sport+ modes).\n\nUnlike the X3, all-wheel drive is standard in the X4. The powertrain is a fantastic combination, but also not very different from the X3. BMW says the X4 xDrive35i does zero to 60 mph in 5.2 seconds, while the X3 gets there in 5.3 seconds. One tenth of a second is not felt in the seat of your pants.\n\nThe X4’s two flavors include the xDrive35i, which has EPA-estimated mileage of 22 mpg combined (it’s 19/27 mpg city/highway), and the 23-mpg xDrive28i (20/28 mpg city/highway). The Evoque is rated 24 mpg combined (21/30 mpg), while the X3 is expected to get 24 mpg combined (21/28 mpg) with the four-cylinder and either rear- or all-wheel drive. The six-cylinder X3 is rated 21 mpg combined (19/26 mpg). A stop-start feature shuts the X4’s engine off automatically to save fuel when the car is stopped. Its execution in the X4 is a little rough, but drivers who dislike it can turn the feature off.\n\nInterior\nYou can’t have your cake and eat it too when it comes to the X4’s coupelike shape. The sloping roofline decreases backseat headroom and inhibits visibility. (At this point, the X4 really is beginning to sound more like a coupe than an SUV.) Rear headroom shrinks from 39.1 inches in the X3 to 37.4 inches in the X4, though other backseat dimensions remain unchanged. Even up front there’s 0.7 inches less headroom than the X3 offers.\n\nPerhaps the most noticeable consequence of the X4’s coupe styling is rearward visibility. A small rear window, thick body pillars and a miniscule piece of glass behind the back door windows offer limited visibility; the Evoque and X3 have less limiting rear sightlines. The roofline’s intrusion into backseat space requires passengers to duck more than they normally would to get in. The backseat features two bucket seats and a raised middle seat, as opposed to the X3’s flat bench.\n\nThe interior design is nearly identical to the X3, with a classy execution of material quality and fit and finish. The M Sport features brushed aluminum trim, an M steering wheel and upgraded headliner material. On the downside, there isn’t much distinction between this and the X3, and genuine leather still isn’t a standard feature; imitation leather comes standard, while leather is a $1,450 option or available as part of a $2,200 Premium Package.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nBMW’s iDrive system has come a long way since its much-maligned initial years. I still don’t find the knob-based controller for the multimedia and vehicle functions the easiest to use, but BMW seems to improve its function incrementally with each new version. In the X4, it’s still easy to get lost in the menus despite shortcut and back buttons. Gaining familiarity with the system’s multiple screens and pages takes a good amount of time and patience.\n\nOur X4 test car had BMW’s optional, $500 Enhanced Bluetooth and Smartphone Integration adapter. It’s a feature that docks the phone securely inside the center storage console and uses the car’s cellular antenna for its signal. It also charges the phone and gives full function to the multimedia system. It’s a much cleaner installation than a long cord and keeps the center storage console tidy. Various adapters are available to work with different phones.\n\nCargo & Storage\nCargo room behind the backseat is down from the X3’s 19.4 cubic feet to 17.7 cubic feet, and overall cargo volume is down from 56.5 cubic feet to 49.4 cubic feet. The Evoque has a smaller exterior footprint than the X4 by more than a foot in length yet has more cargo room, at 20.3 cubic feet or a maximum 50.1 cubic feet.\n\nA power liftgate is a standard feature just like on the X3, though a rear window wiper is not (one isn’t even offered). BMW really went for the coupe motif by excluding the rear wiper, but I wanted one during my drive time to clear snow and debris from the back window.\n\nSafety\nThe X4 had not yet been crash-tested at the time of publishing. Optional advanced safety features include forward collision warning with automated braking, lane departure warning, a “surround-view” backup camera with a top-down view of the car, plus front and rear parking sensors. You can see a full list of safety features here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nA starting price of $45,650 for a four-cylinder X4 is $4,200 more than an all-wheel-drive, four-cylinder X3. Beyond an all-wheel-drive X3’s standard equipment, the X4 adds high-intensity discharge headlights with adaptive function, rear parking sensors and variable sport steering.\n\nStep up to the more-powerful engine, and the X4 xDrive35i costs $48,950. The M Sport Line adds $1,900 ($2,300 on four-cylinder models), the Driver Assistance Package (with the backup camera and front parking sensors) is $700, heated seats are $500, and our test car’s $2,200 Premium Package included smart keyless access, lumbar support, leather interior and a one-year satellite radio subscription.\n\nThe tab added up quickly and the car we tested, at $55,300, didn’t have navigation, smartphone app integration or a much-needed blind spot warning system. A few things it had that I’d do without include the M Sport Line and even the more-powerful engine. The 2.0-liter four-cylinder is such a good engine in other BMW products, it makes the six-cylinder a hard sell; I have a hard time believing it wouldn’t do well in the X4. Zero to 60 mph is still a respectable 6 seconds for the smaller engine, compared with 5.2 seconds for the big guy.\n\nAt its core, the X4 is mostly a design exercise. Maybe shoppers will flock to the coupelike SUV in the X4 simply because it’s in a more reasonable price range now, coming in a whopping $15,000 less than an X6. You’d really have to be in love with the look, though, to fork over an extra $4,200 given the X4 isn’t that different from the already exceptional X3. Styling and a few features are the only differences, and the negatives of decreased room and visibility are hard to ignore in day-to-day driving.\n\nemail",
