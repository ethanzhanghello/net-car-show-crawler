      "expert_review": "What Is the 2016 BMW M5?\n\nThe 2016 BMW M5 is a five-seat sports sedan that competes with the Audi RS7 and Mercedes-AMG E. It's offered in one rear-wheel-drive trim level. This is a high-performance variant of the BMW 5 Series sedan, which is covered separately as the 528, 535 and 550.\n\nWhat's New on the 2016 BMW M5?\n\nThe 2016 BMW M5 now comes standard with a power trunk lid, an upgraded USB port and enhanced Bluetooth functionality. The 2016 model year also sees the introduction of the limited-edition Pure Metal Silver BMW M5.\n\nWhat Features in the 2016 BMW M5 Are Most Important?\n\nThe 2016 BMW M5 is powered by a turbocharged 4.4-liter V-8 engine that produces 560 horsepower and 500 pounds-feet of torque; this engine comes mated to a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission with paddle shifters. Significant standard features include a rear spoiler, quad exhaust tips, an Active M rear differential, adjustable shock absorbers with three modes, adjustable steering effort, launch control and M blue-painted brake calipers. As required in all 2016 vehicles, the M5 comes standard with front airbags, antilock brakes and an electronic stability system.\n\nSignificant optional features include a six-speed manual transmission, a carbon-ceramic brake system and the Competition Package, which raises horsepower to 575. Launch control is not available on models equipped with the six-speed manual transmission.\n\nShould I Buy the 2016 BMW M5?\n\nThe 2016 BMW M5's output is impressive, and the experience of stepping on the gas is downright thrilling, with quick acceleration and steering modes that allow you to find your comfort zone. This, combined with the premium cabin materials and unique M5 styling cues, make this quite an attractive package. On the other hand, it's quite heavy – its curb weight is more than two tons – and its manual transmission feels sloppy in comparison with both competitors' manuals and the M5's own standard dual-clutch automatic. The rear seat is also quite cramped, making it a suboptimal choice for a family vehicle.\n\nCars.com's Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "There is always risk involved when it comes to remaking an icon, and BMW at the very least deserves props for its chutzpah in moving the redesigned 2018 M5 in a direction very different from each of its predecessors.\n\nRelated: 2018 BMW M5 Preview\n\nThe new M5 gets a slew of cosmetic updates, including a new front bumper with three giant air intakes that help funnel air to the cooling systems and the brakes, a carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic roof to reduce weight and an updated rear diffuser flanked by two pairs of exhaust pipes.\n\nThose are all window dressing, however; the big change (and risk) lies in what goes on under the M5’s skin. Previous generations of the M5 were all foundationally rear-wheel-drive performance sedans, but for 2018 there’s something new down there: standard all-wheel drive. And there’s one other change, which is understandable given current trends but still leaves me a bit misty-eyed: no more manual transmission. All M5s will come with an eight-speed automatic.\n\nThese updates have some purists worried: Will the M5 still be a true performance car? Or will it turn into a cushier, comfortable sedan that can go fast in a straight line but loses some (some would say “more”) of its character?\n\nThis is where I tell you that this was the first M5 I’ve driven, and in one respect I’m kind of glad: It meant I got to evaluate the M5 in a vacuum, no waxing nostalgic for the RWD car or the manual — the 2018 M5 got a clean start with me on its merits. And its merits are ample. I headed to BMW’s Performance Center in Thermal, Calif., to see if the M5 has bite.\n\n2018 BMW M5\n\nPowertrain: 600-horsepower, twin-turbo 4.4-liter V-8 with 553 pounds-feet of torque; eight-speed automatic transmission; M xDrive all-wheel drive with Active M rear differential\nKey features: Adaptive suspension, carbon-ceramic brakes ($8,500), 20-inch bi-color wheels ($1,300), carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic roof, full Merino leather upholstery ($3,500), Driving Assistance Plus Package ($1,700), Executive Package ($4,000), head-up display, Apple CarPlay compatibility ($300)\nPrice: I wasn’t able to track down an official window sticker from BMW, so the above is my best approximation of the features on the street car I tested, amounting to $125,395. The 2018 M5 starts at $103,595 (including destination charges). This puts it within the realm of the Mercedes- AMG E63 S (starting at $105,395) and Audi RS 7 ($114,875).\nQuick, Quick, Quick\n\nThis thing goes like stink. The zero-to-60 sprint vanishes in just 3.2 seconds, according to BMW, a touch quicker than the Mercedes (3.3 seconds) and a step ahead of the Audi (3.6 seconds for Performance versions), each according to their manufacturers. The buildup of speed is actually quite linear. This is why the RS 7, though technically slower, can feel faster at times because it kicks so hard in the middle-rpm range, but the M5 is easier to control and rolls onto the power a bit more cleanly.\n\nPretty much every performance characteristic of the car is customizable, from the suspension firmness and the behavior of the AWD system to the steering assist and shift speed. To make things simpler, there are two red buttons atop the steering wheel with an M1 and M2 painted on them. This allows the driver to store customized quick-access drive modes for his or her most commonly desired settings.\n\nOn the track, the AWD system shines. The M5 has so much power that it’s comforting to know you have four wheels to put it all down instead of two. A button in the center console activates something called M Dynamic Mode, which shifts the torque bias rearward and can dial in some allowable oversteer as well. It also offers a 2WD mode that dumps all of the power to the rear wheels for those who want some old-school M5 hijinks — enough to mitigate the complaints of casual rear-drive enthusiasts, but not the purists who would prefer not to have the extra hardware weighing on the steering and front suspension. I spent my time in the M5’s 4WD and 4WD Sport modes.\n\nThe dynamics are excellent with the suspension jacked up to its firmest, especially considering that the M5 tips the scales at 4,370 pounds (actually a not-insignificant improvement, considering the previous generation was 4,387 pounds with a manual and rear-wheel drive). On the perfect pavement on a track, the suspension doesn’t have to worry about road imperfections and keeps the M5 impressively flat on corner entry. It isn’t what I would call agile, though; turn-in is not very sharp and you can feel its weight, especially on tighter, slower corners that push a lot of the car’s heft onto that outside rear tire. However, the engine, transmission and all-wheel drive work together in such tight harmony that it remains entertaining because you can use the throttle to manipulate the car’s exit trajectory, and it is seriously addicting.\n\nThe M5 also does one thing that I sincerely appreciated: It projects your current gear prominently in the head-up display. When using the paddle shifters to scoot around, that’s a big added convenience that not all automakers feature, so kudos to BMW.\n\nWrestling (and that is the appropriate word for it) the M5 around the racetrack was great fun, but once I got it on the street, I found that normal pavement is where the car truly excels.\n\nWindows Down, and Cruise\n\nThe M5’s performance credentials are undeniable — but then again, so are its luxury chops. My test vehicle came with full Merino leather upholstery and all of the luxury features you could want, like ventilated and heated front seats, countless lumbar and adjustment options, and even a steering wheel with long telescoping travel to find a perfect seating position.\n\nTone down the settings and the M5 is docile, the suspension pliant and the cabin whisper quiet except for the occasional burble from the exhaust system when you accelerate with some vigor (because the temptation is too great to refrain for too long). It’s nearly a perfect car to do a long trip in, either solo or with a few passengers.\n\nI think this was the part of the M5 that surprised me the most. I expected it to be a blast on the track (it is) and to have neck-snapping acceleration (it does). Its dual nature is what really delivers, though, and in some ways it’s the full realization of the goals that each of those electronic systems underpinning it aim for – a high performance ceiling without sacrificing on-road comfort or manners.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The ultimate 5 Series sedan — ranking above the 535i and 550i — BMW’s M5 is blazingly fast. This four-door “family sedan” with 560 horsepower and insane acceleration rivals the thrill of most dedicated, two-door sports cars. Channeling the M5’s tremendous power is a six-speed manual transmission, which high-horsepower super-sedans like Mercedes’ E63 AMG and CLS63 AMG and the Audi S6 don’t offer. Compare the M5 with those sedans here.\n\nThough appealing in theory, the 2013 BMW M5’s exclusive six-speed manual transmission just isn’t that good, and it leaves the M5’s driving experience unfulfilling.\n\nThe manual transmission’s vague shifter, long throws and numb clutch pedal are sloppy, like an economy car’s, and don’t inspire the confidence needed in a powerhouse like the M5.\n\nGet the Automatic Transmission\nThe M5 is hard to drive with a manual transmission in the way I imagine taming a bucking bronco would be for someone with the wrong tools. The M5 shifter’s lack of precision is not a good characteristic for an insanely powerful car. There’s no real sense of confidence in the stick, which sometimes feels as if it will bend in half or slip out of gear because it’s so flimsy and clunky; it won’t actually break, but it’s far from a precision instrument. Successfully clicking off smooth and quick shifts is rare, and it takes concentration to operate seamlessly on spirited drives. The flimsy shifter pairs with an equally awkward, nonlinear clutch that requires more slipping to drive smoothly than I’d like; let the clutch out normally, and the M5 truly is like that bucking bronco. \n\nAdding to the confusion is a mysterious notch to the left of 2nd gear into which the shifter moves during aggressive shifting — a trait of other BMW manuals, including the M3’s. It’s frustrating to be wide open, go to grab 2nd gear and totally miss it because the shifter went left into nowhere-land. Reverse is an equally less-than-ideal execution with no real safety provision, one editor noted. Reverse engages when you throw the shifter to the left hard enough at a stop — not by lifting a ring or pushing down to engage.  \n\nWhat is executed well is the manual’s rev-matching feature that automatically blips the throttle during downshifts to raise engine speed for smooth engagement. The Nissan 370Z has a similar feature on its manual transmission. The M5 executes the throttle blip perfectly over a wide range of downshifts, from casually downshifting while slowing for a stoplight, to grabbing 2nd gear from 6th at 50 mph and scaring passengers with a random blast of acceleration. The throttle-blipping feature is active on two of the M5’s engine driving modes — Efficient and Sport — but race-ready Sport Plus mode disables the feature so drivers have to rev-match themselves.\n\nThe six-speed manual is a no-cost option that all but manual transmission purists can skip. If you’re one of those, have fun. Everyone else should check out the seven-speed, dual-clutch, automated manual transmission. In the BMW M6, this transmission paired with the same engine shifts quickly and was surprisingly fun to drive with paddle shifters (most aren’t).\n\nThe M5’s manual transmission has better gas mileage ratings — 15/22 mpg city/highway compared with 14/20 mpg for the automatic — though gas mileage is rarely a priority among buyers of these pumped-up super-sedans. A gas-guzzler tax of $1,000 still applies to the manual transmission despite an increase in fuel economy compared with the old M5 (11/17 mpg). The E63 AMG and CLS63 AMG are exempt from the guzzler tax thanks to their higher gas mileage ratings (16/24 mpg and 16/25 mpg, respectively). Compare the previous M5’s specifications versus the 2013’s and its two competitors here.\n\nTaming the Beast\nHelping rein in the M5’s big power are various active suspension, steering and engine modes. There are three modes for each system: Comfort/Efficient, Sport and Sport Plus. Customizable M1 and M2 buttons on the steering wheel let you store particular combinations that you can then activate with a single press. For example, you can configure M1 as a comfort button with all settings on the comfort/efficiency option and M2 can be set as the race-ready, “I-wanna-go-fast” mode. The M1 and M2 shortcuts are hugely useful and should be copied by every high-performance automaker who decides to offer more than two modes. Mercedes uses a similar function with its AMG button on various AMG models.\n\nThe differences between the comfort and full sport modes is dramatic, with a suspension changing from slightly firm to bounce-out-of-your-seat firm. The throttle becomes significantly more sensitive while the steering also firms up, though it’s already tight to begin with.\n\nThe sportiest modes do an admirable job of hiding the car’s weight, but they can’t make the M5 feel light and nimble thanks to its 4,354-pound curb weight — in spite of its use of aluminum for the hood, front fenders and doors.\n\nUnfortunately, the M5 we drove had summer tires that didn’t grip the road with any kind of authority in temperatures that topped out around 40 to 50 degrees. It was nearly impossible to control wheelspin in 1st and most of 2nd gears. The vicious rush of power from the twin-turbochargers overpowers the traction control in its various modes, including the looser M Dynamic Mode, where the computer still abruptly cuts power to keep the car in control. The reward when the M5’s tires agree with the road and the shifter goes where it’s aimed is a blast of grin-inducing acceleration that’s part sheer acceleration, part satisfaction that the shifter, clutch and tires are working together in harmony.\n\nBMW’s Active Sound Exhaust\nBMW “enhances” the auditory strength of the M5’s noises with its Active Sound, a reproduction of engine noises piped through the stereo for added effect. It’s a subtle and very artificial addition. A sports car’s sound is very much part of its character and uniqueness, and the M5 still needs work, with its video-game-like artificial boost of engine noises on the inside.\n\nWhat’s puzzling is that the roar of the engine and exhaust, and the defined turbocharger whistle, are greatly pleasing with the windows down. It just doesn’t find its way into the cabin otherwise, which is why BMW went the artificial route. An aftermarket exhaust on the M5 would surely bring out the 4.4-liter’s true exotic sounds. The Mercedes-Benz E63 and CLS63 AMG sound hellacious and borderline obnoxious compared with the M5, with a much deeper, fuller and rewarding exhaust.\n\nEven so, exhaust preference is hugely subjective, and what may be music to some is fingernails on a chalkboard to others.\n\nInside\nThe M5’s real aluminum trim (called Aluminum Trace) is unique to the M5 and plentiful on the dashboard and door panels. Seeing the real stuff in such quantity and quality makes the fake, painted plastic in less-expensive cars even more pitiful. Standard equipment includes a 10.2-inch display screen and iDrive multimedia system, an anthracite headliner and engraved door sills with the M logo. Replacing the blah gauges of the regular 5 Series are red-needle gauges and a head-up display with a sweeping tachometer to keep an eye on engine revs. See here for a full list of standard and optional features. \n\nThere still isn’t a decent cupholder in the entire 5 Series. The M5’s are a flimsy D-shaped one up front and a massive, almost unusable one that flips down from the underside of the center storage compartment lid. The M5 isn’t a dedicated sports car like the Porsche 911 — it’s a sedan. C’mon, BMW. Give us something to work with here.\n\nSafety\nThe 2013 BMW 5 Series is a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, having earned the institute’s highest score, Good, in moderate overlap frontal, side-impact and rear crash protection, as well as in a roof-strength test.\n\nStandard safety features include front and side airbags, side curtain airbags for front and rear passengers, and the federally mandated electronic stability system and antilock brakes. Safety options include a Driver Assistance Package for $1,900 that includes a lane departure warning system, blind spot monitoring and side- and top-view cameras. \n\nIn the Market\nThe novelty of four doors paired with more than 500 horsepower never tires. Adding a manual transmission may seem like it would make the M5 the holy grail of super-sedan driving fun, but it’s far off the mark. The M5 is as exciting as you’d expect, though the sloppy manual transmission keeps it from being as entertaining as it should be.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in January 2013 about the 2013 BMW M5. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model.

      "expert_review": "The BMW M5, revamped and relaunched in the States as a 2000 model, is one of those great husband-and-wife conversation pieces. As in, she hates it, he loves it.\n\nDespite the fact that the $72,000 M5 comes with four doors and a roomy trunk, this is a high-performance car with surprisingly few limitations. Or so Paul claims. But what good is all that performance if you can’t drive the car in even mildly lousy weather, asks Anita.\n\nShe: One of the magazine writers, presumably a man, said the M5 made his “stomach quiver with anticipation.” It made mine quiver, too, but for all the wrong reasons. Our stock in trade is doing family-style test drives. No high-speed test track for this gal. So what do I do? I get in the M5 one morning to go work out with my girlfriend. While I’m in the gym, we get one of those fluky Michigan storms that leaves a thin coating of ice covered with some light snow. I get in the car to go home, and it won’t budge. The tires couldn’t get a purchase on that ice. It took me 15 harrowing minutes to rock it back and forth until I somehow managed to get it moving. So do you really think I want to give the M5 four stars after that experience? Would any woman?\n\nHe: I think the question here is would any man have taken 15 minutes to get his BMW moving? Or more importantly, would any man be caught working out with his girlfriend?\n\nShe: Well, we certainly know what the answer is in your case, Mr. Toffee-Covered Almond sneak.\n\nHe: Don’t go there. My dentist is already giving me grief. You know, I can’t say that I drove on much ice or snow, but those low-profile 18-inch performance tires were pretty impressive on dry pavement. And, considering how little sidewall there is, the ride quality was surprisingly good. I suspect the problem that you had could have been avoided by switching to snow tires.\n\nShe: I don’t have time to take my towels out of the dryer and I’m going to change my tires every winter. No, thanks. For $72,000, I should be able to never change my tires and never get stuck in the snow. Besides, I thought the car was ugly.\n\nHe: Sounds like you fit the profile of the ideal Hummer buyer, honey. Let’s look at things from a different angle. I’ve driven Ferraris, Lamborghinis, Aston Martins and, yes, even Vipers with similar acceleration and cornering capability, priced anywhere from $70,000 to $250,000. From that perspective, two things strike me about the M5. First, if you compare it with some of the other supercars on the road, it’s probably at the low end of the price spectrum. And that doesn’t take into account other features like safety, fuel economy and comfort. If you factor in the M5’s creature comforts – the fact that it comes with four doors, a huge trunk and nearly every conceivable luxury accessory – the $72,000 sticker starts to look like a bargain. And the simple fact is that Detroit doesn’t build a darn thing that can touch this car. Neither, for that matter, do the Jap anese.\n\nShe: It’s really interesting to see how the male mind justifies things. If you factor in four doors, a huge trunk, safety and comfort, that sounds like a minivan to me. And it won’t cost $72,000 either.\n\nHe: You’re not going to find an engine like this in a minivan, Mom. In the M5, BMW starts with its twin-cam V-8 and bores it out to nearly five liters. By the time the gearheads in the company’s high-performance M division have finished massaging it, the engine makes 400 horsepower. If you’re fast enough with the clutch pedal and six-speed manual gearbox, you should be able to gallop from zero to 60 in about five seconds flat.\n\nShe: I have to say that the built-in safety features on the M5 are impressive, although I’m still puzzled why the traction-control system couldn’t help get me off the ice patch. Besides that, you get four-wheel antilock disc brakes and dynamic stability control, which helps prevent fishtailing, and you can order up to eight air bags, i ding side bags for the rear passengers.\n\nHe: We never had the car on a race track, but even on the local roads, the suspension tuning is exceptional. It’s a delightful combination of firm damping and taut body control, with just enough compliance built into the heavy-duty springs and shocks to take the edge off any impact harshness. And the steering is simply razor-sharp. Sorry, dear, but I loved driving this car, any time, anywhere.\n\nShe: You’re making my stomach quiver again, Lienert.\n\n2000 BMW M5\n\nAnita’s rating: acceptable\n\nPaul’s rating: world class\n\nLikes: For performance buffs, perhaps the ultimate everyday car. Few of the space and comfort limitations of more-expensive exotics. Big-time horsepower. Awesome safety equipment, including optional rear-seat air bags. Considering its envelope-pushing performance, price actually seems reasonable (Paul).\n\nDislikes: A gas guzzler. Do I really have to change the tires to drive in ice and snow? (Anita) Come on, $72,000 for a sedan? Who are they kidding? (Anita).\n\nType: Front-engine, rear-wheel drive, five-passenger luxury sport sedan\n\nPrice: Base, $69,400; as tested, $72,070 (inc. $570 destination charge and $2,100 gas guzzler tax)\n\nEngine: 5.0-liter V-8; 400-hp; 369 lb-ft torque\n\nEPA fuel economy: 13 mpg city/21 mpg highway\n\n12-month insurance cost, according to AAA Michigan*: $2,608 (Estimate. Rates may be higher or lower, depending on coverage and driving record.)\n\nWhere built: Dingolfing, Germany",

      "expert_review": "No car brand defines a Silicon Valley career trajectory as well as BMW.\n\nThe first big promotion puts an up-and-comer into a 3-Series. The first job with its own parking space prompts a move into a 5-Series. And when your name finally shows up in the annual report, nothing defines the moment like a new 7-Series.\n\nIn this scenario, nothing has primacy like the new BMW M5. It’s the king of the roost, the big dog, the top of the food chain.\n\nA complex, magnificent car, the 2006 M5 sedan mixes luxury and performance, speed and function, like no other car on the road.\n\nAs well it should at nearly $95,000.\n\nExtracting power from the thunderous 5.0-liter V-10 is easy. After all, there is 500 horsepower inside. Motor Trend says it went from 0 to 60 mph in 4.5 seconds, which is quite amazing for a four-door, five-passenger, two-ton-plus machine.\n\nBut getting to that power requires a steep learning curve. The M5 comes with BMW’s seven-speed sequential manual gearbox (SMG) transmission, which allows for shifting via steering-wheel paddles or by flicking the slick shift knob, but doesn’t require a clutch pedal. It also operates in something akin to an automatic mode. But there’s more. The M5’s brain allows for six manual shift settings and five automatic shift settings. BMW calls it Drivelogic, with the lowest settings providing soft and slow shifts, while the top ones produce hard and fast shifts.\n\nI tried them all, and the car was always fast. But sometimes it would shift boom-boom-boom in rapid succession at about 2,000 to 2,500 rpm. At other times, it wouldn’t shift until 4,500 or 5,000 rpm and the move from gear to gear would be accompanied by a long, noticeable delay that would rock me back in my seat.\n\nUltimately, I became most comfortable using the steering-wheel-mounted paddles to shift.\n\nMany other driving functions — how much power the engine provides, the degree of shock damping, whether stability and traction controls are on and off — can be configured to a driver’s preference, too.\n\nSome can be set via BMW’s iDrive, a fixed, mouse-like dial behind the shifter that controls navigation, entertainment, climate and other functions via choices displayed on the vehicle’s monitor. Familiarity usually breeds contentment, but the need for multiple steps to achieve simple tasks, such as changing radio frequencies, continues to annoy. Still, all that falls aside as you cruise the open road in this muscular, well-balanced car. The steering is precise, and the brakes are stout.\n\nYou can see the 5-Series in the M5’s silhouette, but its square-shouldered good looks generally disguise the beast within. Clues, exist, though, that something special is present — from its subtle rear-deck spoiler, to its four shiny exhaust tips that peak out from below, to its “M” gills on the side flanks, to its gorgeous 19-inch alloy wheels.\n\nOn the inside, the cabin continues BMW’s gradual evolution away from spare and stark. Here, perforated leather seats, a bit of shiny maple wood trim and some chrome bits provide a luxurious setting for driving.\n\nOur test model, painted Indianapolis red metallic, included such options as heads-up display, Sirius satellite radio and a navigation system. Seats can be heated, ventilated and even made to poke you in the sides — all in the name of better support — during hard turns.\n\nFuel mileage, at 12 mpg in the city and 18 mpg on the highway, is predictably poor. I averaged 12.8 mpg in a week of as many enthusiastic miles as I could travel.\n\n– – –\n\nContact Matt Nauman at mnauman@mercurynews.com or (408) 920-5701.",

      "expert_review": "The BMW 5 Series is entering the 2023 model year with some changes in packaging and increased prices as the German automaker’s large four-door sedan aims to stay fresh against a pool of rivals.\n\nRelated: 2021 BMW 5 Series Is Feeling Refreshed\n\nMost updates are found inside, with BMW reintroducing the Executive Package on the 530i, 530e, and 540i variants. The package adds heated front seats (heated rear seats are an extra $500), a head-up display, power-operated trunk, power rear sunshade and side curtains, remote engine start and a Harmon Kardon premium sound system. Additionally, the Premium Package now gets remote start, and the Parking Assistance Package is now only available on the M550i. BMW has removed gesture control from all variants.\n\nMeanwhile, the range-topping M5 loses six exterior colors but adds two new ones (San Remo Green metallic and Skyscraper Grey metallic). Its interior is once again available with the Individual Smoke White with Black Full Merino leather and Tartufo Full Merino leather. Gone is the Bowers & Wilkins Diamond Surround sound system.\n\nThe base 530i model is powered by a 248-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine; the 530e combines the 2.0-liter with an electric motor and a 12-kilowatt-hour battery to bump total system output up to 288 hp; the 540i gets a 335-hp, turbo 3.0-liter inline-six; the M550i xDrive gets a 523-hp, twin-turbo 4.4-liter V-8; and the M5 has a version of the 4.4-liter that makes 600 hp (617 hp with the Competition Package). All 5 Series come with a standard eight-speed automatic transmission. Rear-wheel drive is standard; all-wheel drive adds $2,300 to the price of the 530i, 530e and 540i, while the M550i and M5 get it standard.\n\nPricing and Release Date\n\nThe 2023 BMW 5 Series lineup is available now. Full pricing is below (all prices include the $995 destination charge; the M5 includes a $1,000 gas guzzler tax).\n\n530i: $56,995\n530e: $58,595\n540i: $63,895\nM550i: $82,495\nM5: $111,895\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2021 BMW M5: Updates for the Ultimate 5 Series\n2021 BMW 540i M Sport Review: Light on Sport, Heavy on Tech\nIIHS: 2022-23 BMW 5 Series, X3 Upgraded to Top Safety Pick Plus\nMore BMW News\nFind Your Next Car\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "On the heels of announcing a freshened 5 Series for 2021, BMW unveiled the chieftain of its mid-size sedan lineup in the also-updated 2021 M5. The current-generation 5 Series, you may recall, dates back to the 2017 model year, with the M5 arriving for 2018. That’s the sort of vintage that makes 2021 ripe for substantial updates. And the M5, available in regular or Competition grades, will get them when it hits dealers in August 2020. \n\nRelated: 2021 BMW 5 Series Is Feeling Refreshed\n\nExterior\n\nLike the refreshed 5 Series upon which it’s based, the M5 gets a slightly taller kidney grille — albeit less imposing than the oversized units on the 7 Series or the Toucan-Sam’d 4 Series. Its headlights no longer carry inboard indentations, and the outboard bumper openings below them are a bit taller now. Changes in back are harder to spot: The taillights have a revised L-shape design, but they’re the same overall shape, as are the bumper’s air diffusers and quad tailpipes.\n\nPowertrain and 0-60 Speed\n\nPerformance equipment and numbers carry over, with the M5’s turbocharged 4.4-liter V-8 making the same 600 horsepower (617 hp in the M5 Competition) and 553 pounds-feet of torque. Sixty mph comes in a manufacturer-estimated 3.2 seconds (3.1 seconds in the Competition), identical to BMW’s estimates for the 2020 M5. Power hits the road through rear-biased all-wheel drive, with an active rear differential splitting torque between the left and right rear wheels. \n\nDrivers can choose between various settings for AWD power distribution and stability-system intervention, with (like before) a mode that sends power only to the rear wheels. The M5’s eight-speed automatic transmission has three driver-selectable modes, as well. Like on the M8, a single M mode button replaces settings for individual systems; it has various road and sport modes, plus a Track mode on the M5 Competition.\n\nThe suspension retains its double-wishbone front and multilink rear architecture, with Competition models sitting 0.2 inch lower. Adaptive shock absorbers and six-piston front brake calipers are standard; carbon ceramic discs are optional. Competition models have more aggressive hardware, including 10% firmer springs, unique rear stabilizer bars and firmer engine mounts. In a nod toward improved livability for 2021, BMW says they also get new shocks and recalibrated control systems to improve comfort on highways and bumpy roads.\n\nInterior\n\nInside, the biggest change — again, similar to the regular 5 Series — is an upsized dashboard touchscreen, now 12.3 inches versus the prior 10.25 inches. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, both wireless, are standard. (The outgoing 5 Series offered wireless CarPlay but no Android Auto of any kind.) Other additions for 2021 include cloud-based navigation and BMW’s Extended Traffic Jam Assist, one of just two hands-free steering systems on the U.S. market as of this writing. (The other is Cadillac’s Super Cruise.) BMW offered ETJA on half a dozen models for 2020, but not the 5 Series; that changes for 2021.\n\nPrice\n\nPricing starts at $104,495 for the M5 and $112,095 for the M5 Competition (both including a strangely affordable $995 destination charge), up $800 and $1,100, respectively, versus the 2020 M5 and M5 Competition.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nOur Hands-on Experience With the 2019 BMW X7’s Hands-Free Driving Mode\n2020 BMW X6 Review: Ignore the Why, Enjoy the How\n2020 BMW X1 Review: Delightful to Drive, Confounding to Control\n2018 BMW M5 Quick Spin: Peak Performance When You Want It, Peaceful When You Don’t\nGenesis G70 Vs.

      "expert_review": "There’s been a resurgence of wagons for U.S. buyers in recent years, but there’s a catch. These are $100,000-plus, 600-horsepower-plus ultra-high-performance wagons like the Audi RS 6 Avant, Mercedes-AMG E63 wagon, Porsche Taycan Cross Turismo Turbo and now the BMW M5 Touring. I recently spent a short amount of time in the M5 Touring at the Midwest Automotive Media Association’s 2025 Spring Rally where, having previously reviewed the two prior generations of the M5, I was excited to test the new electrified plug-in hybrid M5 with its combined 717 hp and EPA-estimated 25 miles of all-electric range. Even after a short drive, it was clear that the new M5 is a very different beast than its predecessors, and doubly so with its new wagon body style.\n\nRelated: 2025 BMW M5 Touring: A 717-HP Station Wagon for $122,675\n\nSize and Heft\n\nWhile the previous two generations of M5 weren’t small by any measurement, the M5 Touring has a dominating presence with its long roofline, chiseled exterior styling and full-size SUV-like curb weight of 5,530 pounds. The M5 sedan and wagon are the same length at nearly 201 inches long overall, making them 5 inches longer than the 2018-23 M5 and 7 inches longer than the 2013-16 M5.\n\nElectrified Engine\n\nThe powertrain does the M5’s hulking appearance justice with 717 hp that zaps the tires instantly. It combines an electric motor housed in the transmission that makes 194 hp and 207 pounds-feet of torque with a 577-hp, twin-turbocharged V-8. There’s no delay in acceleration like previous gas-only turbo V-8s, and it’s a thrilling wallop when the go-pedal goes down.\n\n2025 BMW M5 Touring | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nUnfortunately, the roads were damp and it was cold (mid-40s Fahrenheit ambient temp) during my drive, which made for a hairy experience with the M5 Touring’s Pirelli P Zero R tires. The P Zero R is a maximum-performance summer tire that fits between Pirelli’s P Zero summer tire and the P Zero Trofeo RS track-oriented tire. In the wet and cold, they seriously struggled, with even a light prodding of the accelerator pedal sending the wagon-butted rear end wagging back and forth. Interestingly, an M5 sedan was also available for drives, and its Michelin Pilot Sport S 5 tires (also a max-performance summer tire) were less susceptible to slipping and sliding. This was with the drive settings in sport-oriented configuration, of which there is an overwhelming number of individual settings for various adjustable controls like the steering, suspension, transmission, etc. Like in other BMWs, I prefer to set up the M1 and M2 steering-wheel buttons with one for the most comfort-oriented setting and the other in the raciest setting for easy switching of drive modes.\n\nHandling\n\nOther impressions from driving the M5 Touring, like handling characteristics, will have to wait for drier roads, but there are a couple things to note: If you couldn’t tell, this isn’t a dainty vehicle; it drives with heft and brute force versus delicacy and balance. Think sledgehammer instead of scalpel. And that’s not uncommon at all, with most mid-size luxury performance sedans and wagons trending the same way. I will say, however, that the Porsche Taycan Cross Turismo Turbo S is an exception  that defies all physics with its agility and Porsche-ness despite being a fully electric wagon that weighs 5,200 pounds. The one I tested was over $200,000, however.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nM5 Cargo Room and Interior\n\nOn to the wagon bits. What defines this vehicle is something relatively ordinary: its normal cargo area. The M5 wagon’s 27.2 cubic feet of cargo space puts it between the subcompact BMW X1 SUV and the compact BMW X3 SUV, according to BMW specifications. A couple of interesting features include cargo area backseat releases and a two-position cargo shade that can cover the full cargo area or only part of it for larger items.\n\n2025 BMW M5 Touring | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\nBMW Vehicles With the Most Cargo Space Behind the Second Row\n\n1. 2025 X7: 48.6 cubic feet\n2. 2026 X5: 33.9/33.1 (40i, M60i/50e)\n3. 2025 X3: 31.5 cubic feet\n4. 2026 X6: 27.4 cubic feet\n5. 2025 M5 Touring: 27.2 cubic feet\n6. 2025 X1: 25.7 cubic feet\n7. 2025 X2: 25.3 cubic feet\n8. 2025 X4: 18.5 cubic feet\n\nThat interior is dominated by a combined digital instrument panel and center touchscreen that are massive and high-quality but also contain important climate and vehicle controls that replace traditional buttons. You can’t simply jump in and intuitively use the system; it takes acclimation and exploring to find everything you need. During my drive, I needed my co-pilot’s assistance to turn on the defroster. The interior is nicely styled, however, with fun textures and ambient lighting that give it a very modern and techy feel.\n\nThe Unmeasurable Wagon Effect\n\nBMW’s head of the M Division recently told a BMW publication that current demand for the wagon is outpacing demand for the sedan in the U.S. (The M5 wagon hasn’t previously been available in the U.S.) It’s a strange trend to hear for the U.S. market, especially because it’s the other way around in Europe. Is it really because the M5 is more practical as a wagon than a sedan? Perhaps, but it could also be that the M5 Touring is something of an ironic sports car. Or, it could be an anti-SUV statement. Or, maybe a 717-hp all-wheel-drive wagon that does 0-60 mph in 3.5 seconds and up to 190 mph is pretty damn cool, and who knows if we’ll ever get it again. It’s certainly not cheap, however, with an as-tested price of $144,375.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2025 BMW M5 Touring: The Hellion Wagon Is Coming to America\n2025 BMW M5 Review: Tech.

      "expert_review": "It’s true, there’s no manual transmission in the 2018 BMW M5. What made the original super-sedan so unique is now gone. And you know what? Good. It’s an uncommon opinion, but I didn’t think the previous generation’s manual transmission did anything to stir the soul or reward drivers who wanted an engaging manual-transmission experience. BMW didn’t attempt to fix the manual, but killed it instead. For 2018, the M5’s 600-hp, twin-turbocharged 4.4-liter V-8 makes 40 more horsepower than its predecessor and sends power through a conventional eight-speed automatic, not even a fancy dual-clutch transmission like the BMW M3 or previous M5. One more thing: The new M5 is all-wheel drive instead of rear-wheel drive. What the heck is happening in Bavaria?\n\nCraziness, that’s what, because BMW says the M5 is now capable of zero-to-60 mph in 3.2 seconds, down from 4.1 seconds with the previous generation’s dual-clutch automatic transmission; the old six-speed manual did it in 4.3 seconds. The new automatic transmission, all-wheel drive and launch control make for pin-your-head-to-the-seat starts when the engine spins up and fires off like a shot from a cannon.\n\nControlled Craziness\n\nThe M5’s engine is so smooth and refined that there’s not much excitement from the tailpipes, even with the M Sound Control button that changes the flap-controlled exhaust system’s sound in the most-aggressive Sport Plus drive mode. Most of the auditory experience comes from inside with electronic augmentation that’s less artificial sounding than in the previous M5. If subtlety is your style, that’s cool, but I wanted a bit more bark with the BMW M5’s enormous bite, like the voluminous bellow that comes from a Mercedes-AMG E63. The new M5 has a great tone, but the volume isn’t there in the driver’s seat; apparently, the M5 is just too good of a luxury car to let any exhaust noises inside. If this bothers you as well, the accessory BMW M Performance exhaust for the M5 might be up your alley. The M5 Competition version at an extra cost includes a unique exhaust.\n\nThe M5 has an overwhelming number of driving subsystems with adjustable settings — engine, transmission, suspension, steering, stability system, all of which have various intensity settings for casual commuting or corner carving. The M5 and pretty much all competitors can be used as perfectly comfortable daily drivers with broad ranges between Comfort and Sport modes. The Cadillac CTS-V, Audi RS 7 and AMG E63 can rattle your fillings or take grandma to brunch. BMW wins this game because of the M programmable buttons on the steering wheel. They’re not just buttons any longer, but red paddles atop the left- and right-hand spokes that save settings of the driver’s choosing into umbrella modes. The paddles are not any more useful than regular buttons on the wheel that some competitors and the previous-generation M5 have, but they’re different and cool (and red).\n\nI programmed M1 as the Comfort mode but spent most of my time in M2 with Plus Plus Plus settings, where the engine is as responsive as a naturally aspirated V-8 with minimal lag between hitting the pedal and a rush of acceleration. Previously, the supercharged CTS-V was the standout in this class for immediate power delivery, but the M5 — even with its twin turbos — is impressively not at a disadvantage for a turbocharged engine. For a conventional transmission, the eight-speed in the M5 is quick and responsive, and the paddle shifters click off gears like a dual-clutch transmission, though there’s a certain finesse to the way BMW’s dual-clutch shifts in the M4 that’s lacking in the M5’s bang-shift-bang gear changes at wide-open throttle.\n\nRear- or All-Wheel Drive — You Pick, Carefully\n\nThe M5’s all-wheel drive is selectable, but not like an old-style four-wheel-drive truck where you yank a lever to go in and out of rear-wheel drive. Drivers can use the control screen to choose what BMW calls “4WD,” “4WD Sport” (with more rear bias) and “2WD.” It’s called 4WD in the car, but the system itself is named M xDrive all-wheel drive. For marketing purposes, all-wheel drive and four-wheel drive may be interchangeable, but if you ask us, four-wheel drive means a transfer case with a selectable low range.\n\nI digress. Two-wheel drive kills the stability system, so make sure you’re on your toes when barnstorming with only two wheels getting 600 hp. I didn’t notice a huge difference between rear- and all-wheel-drive modes when driving spiritedly. The system is so smart that I feel it was already distributing torque between front and rear wheels to get the car around the corner as proficiently as possible — as if the M5 determined rear-wheel drive was the right way to go anyway.\n\nChoosing two-wheel drive doesn’t magically remove the weight of the all-wheel-drive hardware, so I question the mode’s inclusion. What’s nice is that it can be programmed into the M buttons so, for instance, the left button is 4WD and the right button is 2WD, which saves digging into the menus. The two-wheel mode best used if you’re on a track and can slide around, because the BMW M5’s limits are so high that it takes a lot of work to get that tail to wag. The tires have plenty of grip, and when the adaptive suspension is turned up to max stiffness the M5 is a confident-handling machine.\n\nFast, But Fun?\n\nThat depends on your definition of fun. Is the M5 a lightweight, tossable sedan? Not really. The steering is heavy and the car feels heavy like the previous generation, though there’s more precision in the steering and it’s sharper overall. The Cadillac CTS-V remains champ of giving the weighting and feedback I want from a steering wheel, and that was also true when the M5 was rear-wheel-drive only. Nothing in this class of 4,000-pound-plus, 600-hp-plus sedans bounces from corner to corner at the flick of a slight steering input; for that, you’ll have to downsize to an Alfa Romeo Giulia Quadrifoglio. A 640-hp CTS-V is 4,141 pounds, a 560-hp RS 7 is 4,497 pounds and a 603-hp E63 is 4,515 pounds. These are heavy hitters that drive with a heft to them, though the new M5 is a well-balanced heft.\n\nAt 4,370 pounds, the M5 is 17 pounds lighter than the outgoing M5, which is impressive considering the extra weight all-wheel drive adds. A carbon-fiber-reinforced roof and more aluminum helped keep the pounds down. But I wonder how a true rear-wheel-drive 2018 M5 would perform without all the extra weight hanging under the car and on the front wheels. The M5 certainly wouldn’t be capable of the lightning quick 3.2 seconds to 60 mph with only rear-wheel drive; the E63 does it in 3.4 seconds and both the CTS-V and RS 7 do it in 3.7 seconds, according to their respective manufacturers. And the fun in driving the M5 is mostly that, at any speed, it unleashes a blast of acceleration, so maybe it’s OK that it’s all-wheel drive.\n\nAlso fun is the M5’s attention-hogging Marina Bay Blue exterior. Part of the appeal of a luxury sedan is to show off (c’mon, you know it), and it’s easy to get lost gazing into the deep blue paint. Combined with the sharp lines, wider stance and gaping air intakes, the M5 draws in curious neighbors from blocks away. With this blue, the car has a presence sitting in the driveway that it doesn’t have with any other color, because its other colors are another shade of blue, gray, black and white (zzzzzzzz). Perhaps what’s most surprising is that this blue doesn’t cost any extra — very un-BMW-like. On the inside, backlit M5 emblems on the seats and front and rear doors pop for an extra bit of “sahhhweeet” at night, along with rave-like ambient lighting. I found all of the above wholly entertaining.\n\nDriver’s Car That Needs Minimal Driving\n\nThe regular 5 Series’ impressive suite of semi-autonomous driving features are must-haves for those who live in congested areas. BMW’s Driving Assistant Plus Package is a collection of features that center the car in the lane and can slow, stop and restart in traffic by following the car ahead using radar. They work just as well in the M5, but I was conflicted because here’s a 600-hp sedan that can disappear in a cloud of its own tire smoke, yet I’m letting the car sort of drive itself on the highway with the bare minimum attention. It felt odd. Of course, if it didn’t have those requisite features, I’d be asking, “How could this $100,000 car not have adaptive cruise control and lane centering?”\n\nIn the Market\n\nThe 2018 M5 starts at $104,695 with destination charge and $1,000 gas guzzler tax, but the $129,000 M5 we tested commanded a big premium with optional packages and equipment, including a noisy set of $8,500 carbon-ceramic brakes — amazing hardware on BMWs I’ve track-tested, but for street use, were characteristically grabby and squealed at low speeds. While $129,000 may seem out of control, it’s in line with what you can spend on a Mercedes-AMG E63, Audi RS 7 or Porsche Panamera Turbo; the CTS-V is the bargain buy of the class, though with an appropriately bargain interior. The old M5 wasn’t much less expensive at a little less than $100,000, but with only rear-wheel drive, it couldn’t keep up with the acceleration of competitors and felt a little dull compared with the 2018 model. The new M5 has more liveliness than its immediate predecessor and is more competitive with powerhouse super-sedans. Plus, the new M5 with its selectable all-wheel drive (if equipped with the right tires) is certainly a more drivable car year-round for those in wintry climates.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 BMW 5 Series?\n\nThe 2020 BMW 5 Series is a five-seat mid-size luxury sedan that competes with the Mercedes-Benz E-Class and Audi A6, among others. It offers a choice of turbocharged gas engines as well as plug-in hybrid, M Performance and M5 versions. Rear- and all-wheel-drive models are offered.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 BMW 5 Series?\n\nKeyless entry is now standard. The performance-oriented M550i’s twin-turbocharged V-8 engine is now rated at 523 horsepower and 553 pounds-feet of torque; that’s an increase of 67 hp and 73 pounds-feet of torque from last year, and the sedan’s 0-60-mph time has dropped 0.3 second to just 3.6 seconds. Meanwhile, the 530e gets a larger high-voltage battery pack that increases the car’s all-electric range from 16 to 20 miles for rear-drive versions and from 14 to 18 miles for all-wheel-drive models.\n\nNewly standard features for the M5 include a digital instrument panel and wireless device charging. The M5 lineup also includes the Edition 35 Years, which celebrates 35 years of the M5 sports sedan. Just 35 have been allotted for the U.S.\n\nWhat Features in the 2020 BMW 5 Series Are Most Important?\n\nStandard active safety features include blind spot warning, lane departure warning, forward collision warning, pedestrian detection, city collision mitigation and rear cross-traffic alert. Standard luxury features include wood trim, automatic air conditioning and navigation. Available features include an active suspension, power trunk lid, aluminum cabin trim, Nappa leather upholstery, massaging front seats, a heated steering wheel, a head-up display, wireless device charging, a gesture-based interface, a Harman Kardon or Bowers & Wilkins surround-sound system, a night vision system, adaptive cruise control and a 360-degree camera system.\n\nShould I Buy the 2020 BMW 5 Series?\n\nWhether you’re looking for an efficient luxury car or a high-powered sports sedan, there’s probably a version of the 5 Series that’ll fit your needs. Its high-quality interior impresses and the car can be loaded up with tech features, but some shoppers might find the backseat not roomy enough.",
