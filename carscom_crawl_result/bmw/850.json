      "expert_review": "For $88,720, some might expect two bedrooms and a bath, not the two doors and the $3,000 gas-guzzler tax on the ’93 BMW 850i we tested.\n\nIn addition to dual air bags and anti-lock brakes, there are some novel touches in the 850i. They include a right outside mirror that tilts curbward when you engage reverse, for the visibility to avoid hitting pedestrians; a coin holder hidden in the driver’s door; and windows that automatically open and close a crack to make it easier to open and close the doors.\n\nBut the tires had a tendency to wobble on uneven pavement; the backs of thefront seats rest against the rear seats, so that there is no rear-seat legroom; and the phone sits exposed on top of the console, making it a sittingtarget.\n\nThe 5-liter, 296-horsepower V-12 engine boasts a 0-to-60 m.p.h. time of 6.1seconds but is rated at 12 m.p.g. city/18 highway, earning the $3,000 penalty.",
