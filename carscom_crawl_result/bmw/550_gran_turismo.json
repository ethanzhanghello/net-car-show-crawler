      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nBMW’s 5 Series is the automaker’s next step up in size and price from BMW’s best-selling 3 Series. The top-level 550i is only available as a rear-wheel-drive sedan, unlike other 5 Series models that can be had in wagon and all-wheel-drive configurations. The 5 Series competes with luxury sedans like the Audi A6, Lexus GS and Acura RL.\n\nFor 2010, there is a new high-performance version called the 550i Gran Turismo.\n\n(Skip to details on the: 5-Series Gran Turismo)\n\nNew for 2010\nOther than the Gran Turismo model, there are no significant changes for 2010.\n\nExterior\nThe BMW 550 doesn’t stray from the conventional BMW styling, as it has short overhangs (the distance between the end of the fender and the bumper) and a twin-kidney grille. The 550 has subtle door-sill and front and rear bodywork extensions.\n\nXenon high-intensity-discharge headlights\nAdaptive headlights turn in the direction of the steering wheel\nLED turn signals\nFront and rear parking sensors with graphic display\nMetallic paint\n17-inch alloy wheels with all-season tires\nRain-sensing wipers\nOptional 19-inch light-alloy wheels with performance run-flat tires\nOptional headlight washers\n\nInterior\nFor 2010, BMW has upgraded the optional iDrive system, which controls the navigation system, to make it easier to use.\n\nLeather trim\nPower tilt/telescoping steering wheel\nMP3 jack\nPush-button start\nAvailable head-up display projects car’s speed and navigation directions on windshield\nAvailable heated front and rear seats\nAvailable HD radio\nAvailable active cruise control automatically slows car when approaching a slower-moving car\n\nUnder the Hood\nWhile other 5 Series models use six-cylinder engines, the 550i uses a 4.8-liter V-8 making 360 horsepower and 360 pounds-feet of torque.\n\nSix-speed manual transmission\nAvailable six-speed automatic\nRear-wheel drive\n\nSafety\nSafety features include:\n\nElectronic stability system\nAntilock brakes\nFront, side-impact and side curtain airbags\nRear side-impact airbags optional\nOptional lane departure warning system sends a vibration through the steering wheel when car drifts from lane\n\n5-Series Gran Turismo\nFor 2010, BMW added a hatchback version of its rear-wheel-drive 5 Series, dubbed the 5 Series Gran Turismo. Upstream of the outgoing 5 Series sedan — itself due to be replaced soon — the Gran Turismo sports a restyled interior and a streamlined exterior, both with cues from BMW’s recently redesigned 7 Series flagship. With its steeply raked hatch ending in a short, sedan-like trunk, the Gran Turismo measures about 6 inches longer than the 5 Series sedan. The hatch opens in two sections: The entire hatch can lift, or a section below the rear window opens separately to reveal a sedan-like trunk behind the rear seats and below a cargo cover. The area offers 15.5 cubic feet of cargo volume, a bit more than the outgoing sedan’s 14.0 cubic feet. For additional storage capacity, the seats fold down in a 40/20/40 split.\n\nThe 550i Gran Turismo can accommodate four or five, depending on the backseat configuration. Interior features include the 7 Series’ Black Panel gauge and climate displays, which incorporate BMW’s traditional gauge themes into an electroluminescent display. A next-generation iDrive system, already used across various other BMW models, offers better screen resolution and more shortcut keys than its predecessor.\n\nThe Gran Turismo’s sole drivetrain — a twin-turbo V-8 that’s good for 400 horsepower — works through a new eight-speed automatic transmission.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe five-seat 5 Series is offered with a twin-turbo V-8 (550i), a single-turbo six-cylinder (535i) and a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder for the 528i, with an eight-speed automatic transmission available across the board. Competitors include the Mercedes-Benz E-Class, Audi A6 and Infiniti M.\n\nThe 5 Series lineup includes the Gran Turismo, a tall hatchback built on the 7 Series sedan platform. There’s also an ActiveHybrid 5 model that gets an EPA-estimated 23/30 mpg city/highway; it’s covered separately in the Cars.com Research section just like the high-performance M5 sport sedan.\n\n(Skip to details on the: 5 Series Gran Turismo)\nNew for 2013\nFor 2013, the 535i and 550i can now have the BMW Individual Composition Package, which includes extended leather upholstery, 19-inch alloy wheels, Alcantara headliner material and Shadowline trim. Standalone BMW Individual options include wood inlays on the steering wheel, and unique paint and wood trim. Updates to the navigation system include revised submenus, weather information and optional Google search.\nExterior\nThe 5 Series shares its platform with the bigger 7 Series sedan. Up front, the car’s signature kidney grilles sit low and are upright. Adaptive xenon headlights are optional on the 528i and standard elsewhere. The taillights employ three rows of LED lights, and BMW’s Adaptive Brake Lights illuminate a larger section under hard braking. Exterior features include:\n\n\n17-inch alloy wheels (528i)\nAvailable 18- and 19-inch rims\nStandard power sunroof\nStandard heated side mirrors\n\nInterior\nDrawing cues from the 7 Series, the 5 Series’ climate-control readouts use BMW’s Black Panel technology to appear out of dark panels without the brightened look of traditional electroluminescent displays. Cupholders are in the center console instead of flipping from the dashboard as on the previous generation.\n\nThe optional navigation system includes a massive high-resolution 10.2-inch center display. Without navigation, the display still sorts through various audio and setup menus, but it shrinks to a 7-inch display and 800-by-480 pixel resolution. Both setups incorporate BMW’s iDrive system. Interior features include:\n\n\n10-way power front seats\nAutomatic dual-zone air conditioning\nPower tilt/telescoping steering wheel\nOptional head-up display\nOptional heated and ventilated front seats\nOptional 60/40-split folding backseat\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe 528i has a 240-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine. The 535i features a 300-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter six-cylinder and the 550i has a twin-turbo 4.4-liter V-8 that makes 400 hp. All three use an eight-speed automatic transmission; the 535i and 550i also offer a six-speed manual. All three models are available with rear- or xDrive all-wheel drive.\n\nBMW’s available Adaptive Drive system includes Active Roll Stabilization, which attempts to actively counter body roll, as well as an adaptive suspension and customizable settings for both the drivetrain and suspension. Mechanical features include:\n\n\nOptional Active Steering varies the steering ratio to render easier turning at low speeds and stable handling at high speeds\nOptional adaptive cruise control includes full stop-and-go capabilities to manage heavy traffic\n\nSafety\nA blind spot monitoring system, a self-parking assist and a lane departure warning system are optional, as is adaptive cruise control with a collision warning system. Standard safety features include:\n\n\nSide curtain airbags\nSide-impact airbags for the front seats\nActive front head restraints\nElectronic stability system\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes\n\n5 Series Gran Turismo\nBMW’s hatchback version of the 5 Series, dubbed the 5 Series Gran Turismo (GT), receives a few changes for 2013. The base 535i GT is powered by a 300-hp turbocharged six-cylinder while the 550i gets a power boost for its twin-turbo 4.4-liter V-8 engine, which now makes 445 hp and 480 pounds-feet of torque. The engine also gets fuel-saving stop-start technology and BMW’s Eco Pro system. Both engines team with an eight-speed automatic transmission and are available with rear- or all-wheel drive.\n\nAn M Sport Package that includes aero body trim, larger wheels and tires, and other performance enhancements is available. BMW Apps, an application that allows a variety of iPhone applications to run through the iDrive system, is a $250 option.\n\nThe Gran Turismo’s interior and exterior borrow cues from BMW’s 7 Series flagship sedan. With its steeply raked hatch ending in a short, sedanlike trunk, the Gran Turismo measures about 6 inches longer than the 5 Series sedan. The hatch opens in two sections: The entire hatch can be raised, or a section below the rear window opens separately to reveal a trunk behind the rear seats and below a cargo cover. For additional storage capacity, the seats fold in a 40/20/40 split.\n\nThe Gran Turismo can accommodate four or five, depending on the backseat configuration. Though it carries the 5 Series name, this model shares as much with the larger 7 Series, and many of its measurements — including all seating dimensions — differ from those of the 5 Series sedan.\n\nThe Gran Turismo’s interior includes Black Panel gauge and climate displays. The available Value Package includes an updated navigation system, a head-up display and smartphone integration. Back to top",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nRedesigned for 2011, the sixth-generation 5 Series offers a longer wheelbase, better fuel efficiency and more conventional styling than its predecessor. Available in 528i, 535i and 550i trims, the 5 Series sports a new twin-turbo V-8 (550i) and single-turbo six-cylinder (535i), with eight-speed automatics available across the board. Competitors include the Mercedes-Benz E-Class, Audi A6 and Infiniti M.\n\nHigh-tech options include BMW’s Adaptive Drive system, a self-parking feature and lane departure and blind spot warning systems. When it hits dealerships, the 5 Series will come as a rear-wheel-drive sedan; expect all-wheel-drive variants and eventually a high-performance M5 to follow.\n\nFor 2010, BMW introduced the 5 Series Gran Turismo hatchback.\n\n(Skip to details on the: 5 Series Gran Turismo)\n\nExterior\nSharing its platform with the recently redesigned 7 Series, the 5 Series’ wheelbase has been extended about 3 inches. It now leads its class, BMW says. Up front, the car’s signature kidney grilles sit lower and lean more forward. The outgoing 5 Series’ eyebrow-laced headlights have been toned down; the eyebrows are still there, but they don’t extend as far back toward the front wheels. Adaptive xenon headlights are optional on the 528i and standard elsewhere. The taillights employ three rows of LED lights, and BMW’s Adaptive Brake Lights illuminate a larger section under hard braking.\n\nSeventeen-inch alloy wheels go on the 528i; the 535i and 550i get 18s. A Sport Package adds larger wheels and summer performance tires.\n\nInterior\nDrawing cues from the 7 Series, the 5 Series’ climate-control readouts use BMW’s Black Panel technology to appear out of dark panels without the brightened look of traditional electroluminescent displays. Traditional console-mounted cupholders replace the ones that flipped out of the dashboard. Get the optional navigation system, and the dash gets a massive 10.2-inch center display with PC-like 1280-by-480 pixel resolution. Without navigation, the display still sorts through various audio and setup menus, but it shrinks to a 7-inch display and 800-by-480 pixel resolution. Both setups incorporate BMW’s iDrive system.\n\nStandard features include 10-way power front seats and a power tilt/telescoping steering column. A 60/40-split folding rear seat is optional.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe 528i has a 240-horsepower, 3.0-liter six-cylinder, while the 535i gets a 300-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter six-cylinder. The 550i has a twin-turbo, 4.4-liter V-8 that makes 400 hp. All three use a new eight-speed automatic transmission; the 535i and 550i also offer a six-speed manual.\n\nBMW’s Adaptive Drive system comes with the Sport Package. It includes Active Roll Stabilization, which attempts to actively counter body roll, as well as an adaptive suspension and customizable settings for both the drivetrain and suspension.\n\nOptional Active Steering varies the steering ratio to render easier turning at low speeds and stable handling at high speeds. Toward those ends, the system also alters rear-suspension geometry to effectively steer the rear wheels a few degrees, depending on the situation. Optional adaptive cruise control, meanwhile, now includes full stop-and-go capabilities to manage heavy traffic.\n\nSafety\nStandard safety features include front-, side-impact and side curtain airbags. Active head restraints, antilock brakes and an electronic stability system are also standard. Blind spot and lane departure warning systems are optional, as is adaptive cruise control with a collision warning system.\n\n5 Series Gran Turismo\nFor 2010, BMW added a hatchback version of its rear-wheel-drive 5 Series, dubbed the 5 Series Gran Turismo, starting with a 550i “GT” powered by the same 400-hp, twin-turbo V-8 as the 550i sedan. It was followed in the spring by a 535i GT that employs the 535i sedan’s 300-hp, turbocharged six-cylinder. Both have eight-speed automatic transmissions. With the Gran Turismo now in the U.S. market, BMW no longer plans to import the 5 Series wagon.\n\nThe Gran Turismo sports a restyled interior and a streamlined exterior, both with cues from BMW’s recently redesigned 7 Series flagship. With its steeply raked hatch ending in a short, sedanlike trunk, the Gran Turismo measures about 6 inches longer than the 5 Series sedan. The hatch opens in two sections: The entire hatch can be raised, or a section below the rear window opens separately to reveal a trunk behind the rear seats and below a cargo cover. The area offers 15.5 cubic feet of cargo volume, a bit less than the 2011 sedan’s 18.4 cubic feet and the outgoing 2010 5 Series wagon’s 17.7 cubic feet. For additional storage capacity, the seats fold down in a 40/20/40 split for a total of 60 cubic feet, beating the wagon’s maximum volume of 58.3 cubic feet.\n\nThe Gran Turismo can accommodate four or five, depending on the backseat configuration. Though it carries the 5 Series name, this model shares as much with the larger 7 Series, so many of its measurements, including all seating dimensions, differ from those of the 5 Series sedan.\n\nThe Gran Turismo’s interior features include the 7 Series’ Black Panel gauge and climate displays, which incorporate BMW’s traditional gauge themes into an electroluminescent display. A next-generation iDrive system, already used across various other BMW models, offers better screen resolution and more shortcut keys than its predecessor. Back to top",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nRedesigned last year, the sixth-generation 5 Series gained a longer wheelbase, better fuel efficiency and more conventional styling than its predecessor. Available in 528i, 535i and 550i trims, the five-seat 5 Series is offered with a twin-turbo V-8 (550i), a single-turbo six-cylinder (535i) and a new turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder for the 528i, with an eight-speed automatic transmission available across the board. Competitors include the Mercedes-Benz E-Class, Audi A6 and Infiniti M.\n\nHigh-tech options include BMW’s Adaptive Drive system, a self-parking feature and lane departure and blind spot warning systems.\n\nThe 5 Series lineup includes the Gran Turismo, a tall hatchback built on the 7 Series sedan platform.\n\n(Skip to details on the: 5 Series Gran Turismo)\n\nNew for 2012\nA turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder replaces a normally aspirated 3.0-liter six-cylinder in the 528i and will likely show up in other BMWs as the automaker seeks to improve gas mileage. BMW’s xDrive all-wheel-drive system, available last year on the 535i and 550i, is newly available for the 528i. The 528i and 535i also get standard stop-start technology in which the engine automatically turns off when the car is stopped and the driver’s foot is on the brake pedal. The engine automatically restarts when the pedal is released.\n\nExterior\nSharing its platform with the recently redesigned 7 Series, the 5 Series’ wheelbase was extended about 3 inches with the 2011 redesign. Up front, the car’s signature kidney grilles sit lower and are upright. The previous 5 Series’ eyebrow-laced headlights have been toned down; the eyebrows are still there, but they don’t extend as far back toward the front wheels. Adaptive xenon headlights are optional on the 528i and standard elsewhere. The taillights employ three rows of LED lights, and BMW’s Adaptive Brake Lights illuminate a larger section under hard braking. Exterior features include:\n\n\n17-inch alloy wheels (528i)\nAvailable 18- and 19-inch rims\nStandard power sunroof\nStandard heated side mirrors\n\n\nInterior\nDrawing cues from the 7 Series, the 5 Series’ climate-control readouts use BMW’s Black Panel technology to appear out of dark panels without the brightened look of traditional electroluminescent displays. Cupholders are located in the center console instead of flipping from the dashboard as on the previous generation. The optional navigation system includes a massive 10.2-inch center display with high-resolution. Without navigation, the display still sorts through various audio and setup menus, but it shrinks to a 7-inch display and 800-by-480 pixel resolution. Both setups incorporate BMW’s iDrive system. Interior features include:\n\n\n10-way power front seats\nAutomatic dual-zone air conditioning\nPower tilt/telescoping steering column\nOptional head-up display\nOptional heated and ventilated front seats\nOptional 60/40-split folding backseat\n\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe 528i has a new 240-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder for 2012. Meanwhile, the 535i retains a 300-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter six-cylinder and the 550i has a twin-turbo 4.4-liter V-8 that makes 400 hp. All three use an eight-speed automatic transmission; the 535i and 550i also offer a six-speed manual. All three models are available with rear- or xDrive all-wheel drive.\n\nBMW’s Adaptive Drive system includes Active Roll Stabilization, which attempts to actively counter body roll, as well as an adaptive suspension and customizable settings for both the drivetrain and suspension. Mechanical features include:\n\n\nOptional Active Steering varies the steering ratio to render easier turning at low speeds and stable handling at high speeds\nOptional adaptive cruise control includes full stop-and-go capabilities to manage heavy traffic\n\n\nSafety\nBlind spot and lane departure warning systems are optional, as is adaptive cruise control with a collision warning system. Standard safety features include:\n\n\nSide curtain airbags\nSide-impact airbags for the front seats\nActive front head restraints\nElectronic stability system\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes\n\n5 Series Gran Turismo\nBMW added a hatchback version of its 5 Series, dubbed the 5 Series Gran Turismo, for 2010. The first “GT” model was the 550i, powered by the same 400-hp, twin-turbo V-8 as the 550i sedan. It was followed by a 535i GT that employs the 535i sedan’s 300-hp, turbocharged six-cylinder. Both have an eight-speed automatic transmission and are available with rear- or all-wheel drive.\n\nFor 2012, BMW has added an M Sport Package that includes aero body trim, larger wheels and tires, and other performance enhancements. BMW Apps, an application that allows a variety of iPhone applications to run through the iDrive system, is a $250 option. With the addition of the Gran Turismo, BMW no longer imports the 5 Series wagon.\n\nThe Gran Turismo’s interior and exterior borrow cues from BMW’s 7 Series flagship sedan. With its steeply raked hatch ending in a short, sedanlike trunk, the Gran Turismo measures about 6 inches longer than the 5 Series sedan. The hatch opens in two sections: The entire hatch can be raised, or a section below the rear window opens separately to reveal a trunk behind the rear seats and below a cargo cover. The area offers 15.5 cubic feet of cargo volume, less than the 2010 5 Series wagon’s 17.7 cubic feet. For additional storage capacity, the seats fold in a 40/20/40 split for a total of 60 cubic feet, beating the wagon’s maximum volume of 58.3 cubic feet.\n\nThe Gran Turismo can accommodate four or five, depending on the backseat configuration. Though it carries the 5 Series name, this model shares as much with the larger 7 Series, and many of its measurements — including all seating dimensions — differ from those of the 5 Series sedan.\n\nThe Gran Turismo’s interior includes Black Panel gauge and climate displays, which incorporate BMW’s traditional gauge themes into an electroluminescent display. An updated iDrive system, also used in other BMWs, offers better screen resolution and more shortcut keys than its predecessor. Back to top",
