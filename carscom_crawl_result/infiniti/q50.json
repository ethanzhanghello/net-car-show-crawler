      "expert_review": "The 2014 Infiniti Q50 sedan is a fitting successor to the popular G37 it will eventually replace; its boundless power, athletic road manners and elegant interior raise the bar in the class.  \n\nInfiniti’s compact sedan probably looks familiar, but thanks to a brand-wide nameplate overhaul, you might have trouble putting the face with the name.\n\nAside from its new place in the Infiniti alphabet, the car wears more fluid styling, gets additional safety features and loses its manual transmission for 2014; a Q50 hybrid sedan is also new this year. Rear-wheel and all-wheel-drive sedans return; coupe and convertible body styles are not yet available, though they will eventually join the lineup under the Q60 name. Compare the 2014 Q50 and the 2013 G37 here.\n\nAutomakers are keeping the compact sport sedan segment fresh; several key players are either all-new or redesigned within the past year. Q50 competitors include the Cadillac ATS, Lexus IS and Acura TL. Compare them here.\n\nEvolutionary Styling\nThe G37 has always exuded muscular character. It still comes through on the Q50, but it’s nicely balanced with some new softness. Glaring, hooded LED headlights and a shapelier version of Infiniti’s double-arch grille add to its brawniness, but there’s a new slipperiness to its profile. More dramatically sculpted wheel arches and subtle body-side wave lines give it a fluid, always-in-motion look.\n\nStandard LED headlights, running lights and taillights are new this year. Seventeen-inch wheels are standard, and the Sport trim level gets 19s; run-flat tires are standard on both. Sizewise, the Q50 retains the G37’s wheelbase, but grows 2 inches wider and loses less than an inch of height. Power\nAn unfamiliar name and face camouflage an old favorite; the sedan’s 328-horsepower, 3.7-liter V-6 has been tweaked for 2014 for a higher level of refinement and better fuel economy. It feels both spirited and grounded; power is robust from a stop, and a light tap calls up nearly boundless reserves for effortless passing and merging. It also sounds more refined — the sporty exhaust burble still headlines the soundtrack, but it’s more muted than the outgoing model.\n\nTwo-wheel-drive versions are EPA-rated at 20/29/23 mpg city/highway/combined, up from the G37’s 19/27 mpg rating. The numbers stack up favorably against two-wheel-drive V-6 versions of the Cadillac ATS (18/28 mpg), Lexus IS 350 (19/28 mpg) and Acura TL (20/29 mpg). A new Eco mode can boost fuel economy by around 5 to 10 percent, depending on how often it’s engaged, Infiniti says. Eco is part of a new standard Drive Mode selector system that alters shift patterns and throttle sensitivity to benefit fuel economy or sportiness; choices include Standard, Sport, Eco, Snow (for AWD versions) and Personal. Eco delivers a dull, stymied throttle response. In Sport mode, the throttle sensitivity sounds and feels more aggressive.\n\nThe smooth and responsive seven-speed automatic transmission returns for 2014. It teams nicely with the 3.7-liter; prompt and gentle shifts make for seamless transitions. We’re lucky it’s so good, as there’s no manual transmission option this year. Infiniti said too few buyers selected the six-speed manual in the previous generation to justify offering the option. It will be back eventually — though Infiniti isn’t saying when — and will likely debut on the coupe.\n\nFans of the G37, I mean Q50, will have plenty of models to choose from. Aside from the regular sedan, a hybrid version is also available. Infiniti bills it as a “no trade-off” vehicle, offering more power (32 additional hp) and better fuel economy (29/36/31 mpg) than the 3.7-liter. Despite the 3.5-liter’s 360 hp in the hybrid, it isn’t as much of a powerhouse as its gas-only sibling. It’s still strong, but not nearly as smooth; shifts feel much more abrupt. At low speeds, it’ll operate in EV-only mode and is nearly silent, save for some subtle mechanical whirrs. The transfer from EV to gas mode is nearly imperceptible. \n\nHandling\nOne of the biggest — and most surprising — differences between the two models is their steering behavior. The AWD Q50 S I tested used Infiniti’s traditional mechanical steering setup, vastly different from the new Direct Adaptive Steering system on the hybrid: Its electric by-wire architecture uses sensors and signals to steer the car. Although it’s standard on top-level hybrid trims or as a pricey option on non-hybrids (starting in a $3,100 package), it’s worth it.\n\nThe standard system required a heavy amount of driver correction; finding a comfortable center at highway speeds was fatiguing. The overall feel was light and twitchy rather than connected to the road. It seemed at odds with the sedan’s sporty mission.\n\nIn contrast, the Direct Adaptive Steering system provided a firm, direct feel along with quicker, more responsive reflexes. Despite the vastly different steering systems, both cars exhibited a controlled ride with decent bump isolation, though the S model, with its 19-inch wheels and sport suspension, rode more firmly. Overall, however, the Infiniti Q50 felt as lithe as its predecessor — confident around corners with impressive grip and little lean. \n\nThe Controls\nInfiniti says the Q50 is its “most connected” vehicle, and the new InTouch multimedia system indeed takes connectivity to a new level. Its two touch-screens take up much of the futuristic, command-center-like instrument panel. The 8-inch upper screen displays navigation and vehicle info, while climate, audio and app displays live on the 7-inch lower unit. Two expansive readouts mean the audio and climate systems don’t need to jockey for the same piece of real estate.\n\nThe screens function like an iPad or tablet — pinch to zoom, swipe to scroll. InTouch is customizable and can store up to four driver preference profiles, remembering navigation, audio, climate and app settings. Infiniti says it’ll be compatible with around a dozen apps, including Twitter, Facebook and Pandora. Twitter while driving will never be a good idea, but Infiniti says the apps can be controlled via voice prompts to minimize distractions; the software was unavailable on the preproduction models we tested.\n\nAll this technology may sound daunting, but it’s not. Infiniti makes the technology available but not overwhelming. The menu structures are intuitive and there’s no need to panic about the loss of physical controls — most of the audio and climate buttons are still there if you want to opt out of the screens. The optional navigation system was easy to use; entering a destination and canceling a route can be done in only a few steps.   \n\nA couple minor gripes: The Infiniti Q50 still has a traditional audio volume knob, but gone is the radio tune knob. In its place is a touch-screen button — going from SiriusXM 28 to 95 will give you finger fatigue. Also, the touch-screens’ response time was sometimes sluggish and their actions delayed, though I was told it was a preproduction glitch. \n\nComfortable Elegance\nThe cabin retains the G37’s classy and sporty vibe, with an added dash of modern elegance. The front seat’s twin-cockpit setup is re-imagined with an asymmetrical division of space and an emphasis on the driver; a metal dividing line runs the length of the center console. High-gloss maple wood trim or textured matte-finish metal complement the supple leather for a stylish and sophisticated interior. Everything looks and feels first class; Infiniti’s attention to detail is evident in the padded surfaces, contrast stitching and expertly fitted panels.\n\nAlthough the new Q50’s footprint is similar to the G37’s, the sedan is wider and sits a bit lower. This translates into less rear headroom but more front headroom and legroom. It still compares favorably against competitors, though. Even taller drivers will find the front seat spacious. The bolstered front sport seats are abundantly comfortable — they’re deep, wide and long, with a thigh extender for additional support. At 5-foot-5, I easily had enough headroom in the backseat, but my 6-foot-6 passenger rode with his head brushing the ceiling — a common occurrence, he assured me.\n\n \n\n \t2014\nInfiniti Q50\t2014\nCadillac ATS\t2014\nLexus IS 350\t2013\nAcura TL\nFront headroom, inches\t40.2\t38.6\t38.2\t38.4\nFront legroom, inches\t44.5\t42.5\t44.8\t42.5\nRear headroom, inches\t37.5\t36.8\t36.9\t36.7\nRear legroom, inches\t35.1\t33.5\t32.2\t36.2\nSource: Manufacturers\n\n \n\nThere’s 13.5 cubic feet of space in the trunk, much roomier than the ATS (10.4) and the TL (13.1), but a smidge less than the IS 350’s 13.8 cubic feet. A pass-through to the trunk is standard; a 60/40-split rear seat is optional (which strikes me as a cut-rate move). Neither is available on the hybrid, where trunk space shrinks to 9.4 cubic feet to accommodate its battery.Features & Price\nBase rear-wheel-drive versions of the 2014 Infiniti Q50 base price starts at $37,605 (all prices include destination charges). It’s available in base, Premium, Hybrid Premium, S and S Hybrid trims, and all-wheel drive adds an extra $1,800 across the lineup. The hybrid model is pricey, starting at $44,855. In a strange twist, Infiniti announced it’ll continue to sell the G37 model until mid-2015. It will now start at $33,455, much lower than the previous price.\n\nThe V-6 versions of the 2014 Cadillac ATS ($42,020) and 2014 Lexus IS 350 ($40,360) clock in a bit higher, the 2013 Acura TL a bit lower ($36,800). The Q50 is at the low end of the price spectrum, but not after adding safety and convenience features. The Deluxe Touring Package, for example, adds the upgraded steering, Around View Monitor and a few other small features for $3,100. Many of the active safety features are bundled into the $3,200 Technology Package. Navigation is an additional $1,400, and leather seats add $1,000. Safety\nThe 2014 Infiniti Q50 has not yet been crash-tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. The Q50 comes standard with a full complement of airbags, including side curtain airbags that protect front and rear occupants. A backup camera is standard. Click here for a full list of safety features.\n\nThe options are where things get interesting. The Infiniti Q50 offers a host of active collision-preventing safety features, including predictive forward collision warning with automated emergency braking, blind spot warning, blind spot intervention, backup collision intervention, lane departure prevention and active lane control. The latter uses cameras and steering sensors to help keep you in the center of the lane if you’ve wandered too far; it also makes smaller adjustments to keep you straight in case of crosswinds and road imperfections.Q50 in the Market \n\nExecutives at the press preview called the Infiniti Q50 “the best sedan we’ve ever built,” and though the hyperbole prompted an automatic eye roll, I have to concede their point. The G37 was already a standout, and the Q50 builds on that foundation with a compelling blend of sport, comfort and class.\n\nFans of the original should have no problem welcoming this iteration to the family — as long as they know just what the heck they’re looking at.\n\n \n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in August 2013 about the 2014 Infiniti Q50. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2015, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe 2014 Infiniti Q50 sedan is a fitting successor to the popular G37 it will eventually replace; its boundless power, athletic road manners and elegant interior raise the bar in the class.\n\nInfiniti’s compact sedan probably looks familiar, but thanks to a brand-wide nameplate overhaul, you might have trouble putting the face with the name.\n\nAside from its new place in the Infiniti alphabet, the car wears more fluid styling, gets additional safety features and loses its manual transmission for 2014; a hybrid sedan is also new this year. Rear- and all-wheel-drive sedans return; coupe and convertible body styles are not yet available, though they will eventually join the lineup under the Q60 name. Compare the 2014 Q50 and the 2013 G37 here.\n\nAutomakers are keeping the compact sport sedan segment fresh; several key players are either all-new or redesigned within the past year. Q50 competitors include the Cadillac ATS, Lexus IS and Acura TL. Compare them here.\n\nEvolutionary Styling\nThe G37 has always exuded muscular character. It still comes through on the Q50, but it’s nicely balanced with some new softness. Glaring, hooded LED headlights and a shapelier version of Infiniti’s double-arch grille add to its brawniness, but there’s a new slipperiness to its profile. More dramatically sculpted wheel arches and subtle body-side wave lines give it a fluid, always-in-motion look.\n\nStandard LED headlights, running lights and taillights are new this year. Seventeen-inch wheels are standard, and the Sport trim level gets 19s; run-flat tires are standard on both. Sizewise, the Q50 retains the G37’s wheelbase, but grows 2 inches wider and loses less than an inch of height.\n\nPower\nAn unfamiliar name and face camouflage an old favorite; the sedan’s 328-horsepower, 3.7-liter V-6 has been tweaked for 2014 for a higher level of refinement and better fuel economy. It feels both spirited and grounded; power is robust from a stop, and a light tap calls up nearly boundless reserves for effortless passing and merging. It also sounds more refined — the sporty exhaust burble still headlines the soundtrack, but it’s more muted than the outgoing model.\n\nTwo-wheel-drive versions are EPA-rated at 20/29/23 mpg city/highway/combined, up from the G37’s 19/27 mpg rating. The numbers stack up favorably against two-wheel-drive V-6 versions of the Cadillac ATS (18/28 mpg), Lexus IS 350 (19/28 mpg) and Acura TL (20/29 mpg). A new Eco mode can boost fuel economy by around 5 to 10 percent, depending on how often it’s engaged, Infiniti says. Eco is part of a new standard Drive Mode selector system that alters shift patterns and throttle sensitivity to benefit fuel economy or sportiness; choices include Standard, Sport, Eco, Snow (for all-wheel-drive versions) and Personal. Eco delivers a dull, stymied throttle response. In Sport mode, the throttle sensitivity sounds and feels more aggressive.\n\nThe smooth and responsive seven-speed automatic transmission returns for 2014. It teams nicely with the 3.7-liter; prompt and gentle shifts make for seamless transitions. We’re lucky it’s so good, as there’s no manual transmission option this year. Infiniti said too few buyers selected the six-speed manual in the previous generation to justify offering the option. It will be back eventually — though Infiniti isn’t saying when — and will likely debut on the coupe.\n\nFans of the G37, I mean Q50, will have plenty of models to choose from. Aside from the regular sedan, a hybrid version is also available. Infiniti bills it as a “no trade-off” vehicle, offering more power (32 additional hp) and better fuel economy (29/36/31 mpg) than the 3.7-liter. Despite the 3.5-liter’s 360 hp in the hybrid, it isn’t as much of a powerhouse as its gas-only sibling. It’s still strong, but not nearly as smooth; shifts feel much more abrupt. At low speeds, it’ll operate in EV-only mode and is nearly silent, save for some subtle mechanical whirrs. The transfer from EV to gas mode is nearly imperceptible.\n\nHandling\nOne of the biggest — and most surprising — differences between the two models is their steering behavior. The all-wheel-drive Q50 S I tested used Infiniti’s traditional mechanical steering setup, vastly different from the new Direct Adaptive Steering system on the hybrid: Its electric by-wire architecture uses sensors and signals to steer the car. Although it’s standard on top-level hybrid trims or as a pricey option on non-hybrids (starting in a $3,100 package), it’s worth it.\n\nThe standard system required a heavy amount of driver correction; finding a comfortable center at highway speeds was fatiguing. The overall feel was light and twitchy rather than connected to the road. It seemed at odds with the sedan’s sporty mission.\n\nIn contrast, the Direct Adaptive Steering system provided a firm, direct feel along with quicker, more responsive reflexes. Despite the vastly different steering systems, both cars exhibited a controlled ride with decent bump isolation, though the S model, with its 19-inch wheels and sport suspension, rode more firmly. Overall, however, the Q50 felt as lithe as its predecessor — confident around corners with impressive grip and little lean.\n\nThe Controls\nInfiniti says the Q50 is its “most connected” vehicle, and the new InTouch multimedia system indeed takes connectivity to a new level. Its two touch-screens take up much of the futuristic, command-center-like instrument panel. The 8-inch upper screen displays navigation and vehicle info, while climate, audio and app displays live on the 7-inch lower unit. Two expansive readouts mean the audio and climate systems don’t need to jockey for the same piece of real estate.\n\nThe screens function like an iPad or tablet — pinch to zoom, swipe to scroll. InTouch is customizable and can store up to four driver preference profiles, remembering navigation, audio, climate and app settings. Infiniti says it’ll be compatible with around a dozen apps, including Twitter, Facebook and Pandora. Twitter while driving will never be a good idea, but Infiniti says the apps can be controlled via voice prompts to minimize distractions; the software was unavailable on the preproduction models we tested.\n\nAll this technology may sound daunting, but it’s not. Infiniti makes the technology available but not overwhelming. The menu structures are intuitive and there’s no need to panic about the loss of physical controls — most of the audio and climate buttons are still there if you want to opt out of the screens. The optional navigation system was easy to use; entering a destination and canceling a route can be done in only a few steps.\n\nA couple minor gripes: The Q50 still has a traditional audio volume knob, but gone is the radio tune knob. In its place is a touch-screen button — going from SiriusXM 28 to 95 will give you finger fatigue. Also, the touch-screens’ response time was sometimes sluggish and their actions delayed, though I was told it was a preproduction glitch.\n\nComfortable Elegance\nThe cabin retains the G37’s classy and sporty vibe, with an added dash of modern elegance. The front seat’s twin-cockpit setup is re-imagined with an asymmetrical division of space and an emphasis on the driver; a metal dividing line runs the length of the center console. High-gloss maple wood trim or textured matte-finish metal complement the supple leather for a stylish and sophisticated interior. Everything looks and feels first class; Infiniti’s attention to detail is evident in the padded surfaces, contrast stitching and expertly fitted panels.\n\nAlthough the Q50’s footprint is similar to the G37’s, the sedan is wider and sits a bit lower. This translates into less rear headroom but more front headroom and legroom. It still compares favorably against competitors, though. Even taller drivers will find the front seat spacious. The bolstered front sport seats are abundantly comfortable — they’re deep, wide and long, with a thigh extender for additional support. At 5-foot-5, I easily had enough headroom in the backseat, but my 6-foot-6 passenger rode with his head brushing the ceiling — a common occurrence, he assured me.\n\n \t2014\nInfiniti Q50\t2014\nCadillac ATS\t2014\nLexus IS 350\t2013\nAcura TL\nFront headroom, inches\n\t40.2\t38.6\t38.2\t38.4\nFront legroom, inches\t44.5\t42.5\t44.8\t42.5\nRear headroom, inches\t37.5\t36.8\t36.9\t36.7\nRear legroom, inches\t35.1\t33.5\t32.2\t36.2\nSource: Manufacturers\n\nThere’s 13.5 cubic feet of space in the trunk, much roomier than the ATS (10.4) and the TL (13.1), but a smidge less than the IS 350’s 13.8 cubic feet. A pass-through to the trunk is standard; a 60/40-split rear seat is optional (which strikes me as a cut-rate move). Neither is available on the hybrid, where trunk space shrinks to 9.4 cubic feet to accommodate its battery.\n\nFeatures & Price\nBase rear-wheel-drive versions of the 2014 Infiniti Q50 start at $37,605 (all prices include destination charges). It’s available in base, Premium, Hybrid Premium, S and S Hybrid trims, and all-wheel drive adds an extra $1,800 across the lineup. The hybrid model is pricey, starting at $44,855. In a strange twist, Infiniti announced it’ll continue to sell the G37 model until mid-2015. It will now start at $33,455, much lower than the previous price.\n\nThe V-6 versions of the 2014 Cadillac ATS ($42,020) and 2014 Lexus IS 350 ($40,360) clock in a bit higher, the 2013 Acura TL a bit lower ($36,800). The Q50 is at the low end of the price spectrum, but not after adding safety and convenience features. The Deluxe Touring Package, for example, adds the upgraded steering, Around View Monitor and a few other small features for $3,100. Many of the active safety features are bundled into the $3,200 Technology Package. Navigation is an additional $1,400, and leather seats add $1,000.\n\nSafety\nThe 2014 Infiniti Q50 has not yet been crash-tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. The Q50 comes standard with a full complement of airbags, including side curtain airbags that protect front and rear occupants. A backup camera is standard. Click here for a full list of safety features.\n\nThe options are where things get interesting. The Q50 offers a host of active collision-preventing safety features, including predictive forward collision warning with automated emergency braking, blind spot warning, blind spot intervention, backup collision intervention, lane departure prevention and active lane control. The latter uses cameras and steering sensors to help keep you in the center of the lane if you’ve wandered too far; it also makes smaller adjustments to keep you straight in case of crosswinds and road imperfections.\n\nQ50 in the Market\nExecutives at the press preview called the Q50 “the best sedan we’ve ever built,” and though the hyperbole prompted an automatic eye roll, I have to concede their point. The G37 was already a standout, and the Q50 builds on that foundation with a compelling blend of sport, comfort and class.\n\nFans of the original should have no problem welcoming this iteration to the family — as long as they know just what the heck they’re looking at.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2022 Infiniti Q50?\n\nThe five-seat Q50 is Infiniti’s luxury sports sedan that blends spirited performance, comfort and technology. The base engine is a 300-horsepower, twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 that works with a seven-speed automatic transmission. The performance-oriented Red Sport model features a 400-hp variant of the V-6. Rear- and all-wheel-drive versions are available, and competitors include the Audi A4, BMW 3 Series and Lexus IS. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2022 Infiniti Q50?\n\nWireless Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity and a Bose stereo are newly standard. \n\nWhat Features in the 2022 Infiniti Q50 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\n18-inch alloy wheels\nLED headlights\nLeather-trimmed seats\nHeated front seats\nDual-screen multimedia system\nWireless Apple CarPlay \nAndroid Auto \n360-degree camera system\nAutomatic emergency braking\nBlind spot warning \nLane departure warning\nFront and rear parking sensors\n\nAvailable features include: \n\n19-inch alloy wheels\nAdaptive suspension\nSemi-aniline leather-trimmed seats\nOpen-pore wood trim\nNavigation\nShould I Buy the 2022 Infiniti Q50?\n\nIn its class, the Q50 has more losses than wins. While it earns praise for its powerful V-6 engine, the sedan is held back by its complicated multimedia system and underwhelming driving feel. There are other great options in the sports sedan segment, so it’s worth your while to check out the competition before making a purchase.",

      "expert_review": "The 2023 Infiniti Q50 is a classic example of how wisdom does not always come with age. The current-generation model has been on sale for over a decade now, and during that time, it has failed to make a dent in a segment dominated by rivals like the BMW 5 Series and Mercedes-Benz E-Class. Despite this, Infiniti hasn’t thrown in the towel and is giving the 2023 model light updates in an attempt to keep it relevant.\n\nRelated: 2021 Infiniti Q50 Gets More Safety Tech, New Trim\n\nNew Interior Colors and Complimentary Maintenance\n\nThe 2023 Q50 carries over virtually unchanged from the 2022 model year. With the recent discontinuation of the Q60 coupe, the Q50 is the last non-SUV entry remaining in the lineup. The base Luxe trim starts at $43,725 (all prices include a $1,075 destination charge) and gets an all-new Saddle Brown interior color for $500, which adds some depth to an interior that was long defined by depressing black and gray hues.\n\nMeanwhile, the mid-level Sensory trim adds an optional illuminated Infiniti emblem to the front grille for $485. It is the latest model to embrace the recent trend of illuminating the front emblem, with the craze being especially noticeable in the luxury vehicle market.\n\nLastly, all 2023 Q50 models will be covered under Infiniti’s Premium Care maintenance program, which gives owners three years of complimentary maintenance without the typical mileage restrictions that often form the backbone of similar maintenance plans.\n\nUnchanged Performance Still Delivers the Right Notes\n\nWhile the Q50’s dated interior technology may be showing noticeable signs of aging, the carryover engine lineup can still deliver the goods when it comes to performance. All Q50s come with a twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 engine that’s mated to a seven-speed automatic transmission. However, the engine comes in two different flavors, with the Luxe and Sensory trims making 300 hp and the range-topping Red Sport 400 making 400 hp and a beefier 350 pounds-feet of torque.\n\nThe Red Sport 400 also receives other performance-inspired tweaks including an adaptive suspension system, sport brakes with red-tinged brake calipers, carbon-fiber trim and semi-aniline leather seats.\n\nPricing\n\nThe 2023 Q50 sees only marginal price increases across all trims, with all-wheel drive adding $2,000 to the price of all three trims. Starting prices for the full 2023 lineup are below:\n\nLuxe: $43,725\nLuxe (AWD): $45,725\nSensory: $49,425\nSensory (AWD): $51,425\nRed Sport 400: $57,575\nRed Sport 400 (AWD): $59,575\n\nThis pricing still allows the Q50 to be one of the best value plays in the luxury car segment, but with Infiniti preparing for an electrified future, a lineup entirely made up of SUV offerings seems likely. Time is running out on the Q50 and your chance to experience what it has to offer.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nLook for Infiniti Infotainment Overhaul on 2020 Q50, Q60, QX50, QX80\nInfiniti QX60, Nissan Pathfinder Earn IIHS Top Safety Pick Plus Awards\n2016 Infiniti Q50 Review\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2019 Infiniti Q50?\nResearch the Infiniti Q50\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Infiniti Q50?\n\nThe five-seat Q50 is Infiniti’s luxury sports sedan that blends spirited performance, comfort and technology. The base engine is a 300-horsepower, twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 that works with a seven-speed automatic transmission. The performance-oriented Red Sport 400 trim features a 400-hp variant of the V-6. Rear- and all-wheel-drive versions are available, and competitors include the Audi A4, BMW 3 Series and Lexus IS. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Infiniti Q50?\n\nThe Q50 sees no notable changes for 2024. Given its aged design and lack of significant updates in recent years, we wouldn’t be surprised if the Q50 were discontinued in the near future. \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Infiniti Q50 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\n18-inch alloy wheels\nLED headlights\nLeather-trimmed seats\nHeated front seats\nDual-screen multimedia system\nWireless Apple CarPlay \nAndroid Auto \n360-degree camera system\nAutomatic emergency braking\nBlind spot warning \nLane departure warning\nFront and rear parking sensors\n\nAvailable features include: \n\n19-inch alloy wheels\nAdaptive suspension\nSemi-aniline leather-trimmed seats\nOpen-pore wood trim\nNavigation\nAmbient interior lighting\nShould I Buy the 2024 Infiniti Q50?\n\nIn its class, the aged Q50 has more losses than wins. While it earns praise for its powerful V-6 engine, the sedan is held back by its complicated multimedia system and underwhelming driving feel. There are other great options in the sports sedan segment, so it’s worth checking out the competition before making a purchase.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Infiniti Q50?\n\nThe five-seat Q50 is Infiniti’s luxury sports sedan that blends spirited driving, comfort and technology. The base engine is a 300-horsepower, twin-turbo 3.0-liter V-6 that works with a seven-speed automatic transmission. The performance-oriented Red Sport trim features a 400-hp variant of the V-6. Rear- and all-wheel-drive versions are available, and competitors include the Audi A4, BMW 3 Series and Lexus IS.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Infiniti Q50?\n\nThe turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine has been dropped, leaving a twin-turbo 3.0-liter V-6 as the base engine. Meanwhile, a new generation of Infiniti’s dual-screen InTouch multimedia system includes HD displays and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity.\n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Infiniti Q50 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard active safety features include forward collision warning and automatic emergency braking. Blind spot warning, full-speed adaptive cruise control, backup collision intervention, and lane departure warning and prevention are optional. A 360-degree camera system is also optional.\n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Infiniti Q50?\n\nCompared to its class, the Q50 has more losses than wins. While it earns praise for its powerful V-6 engine, its complicated multimedia system and underwhelming driving feel hold it back. With other great options in the sports sedan segment, it’s worth your while to check out the competition before making a purchase.",

      "expert_review": "Verdict: The 2016 Infiniti Q50 2.0T has a surprisingly coarse powertrain, unexceptional interior and tight cabin despite updates for this model year.\n\nVersus the competition: While it has attractive attributes, including electronic safety features and affordable pricing, the Q50 is simply outclassed among compact luxury sedans.\n\nInfiniti has updated its Q50 sedan for 2016 with a mild refresh, including some new powertrains, a light styling update and a revamped interior with a fresh multimedia system. Compare the 2015 and 2016 models here.\n\nAt entry level, there’s a new 2.0-liter, turbocharged four-cylinder from Mercedes-Benz. At the top end, there’s a fire-breathing, 400-hp twin-turbo V-6 and all-wheel drive (AWD). My week with a new 2016 Q50 was in the lower-end model. It’s more modestly priced but still well-equipped and more accessible to the masses. There’s also a two-door version, the Q60, covered separately.\n\nThe compact luxury sedan class is the entry point for any premium brand, where automakers draw in new buyers they hope will be lifelong customers. It’s also one of the most competitive segments on the market, with lots of distinct offerings. Key competitors include the Cadillac ATS, Lexus IS and Mercedes-Benz C-Class.\nExterior & Styling\nThe Infiniti Q50 is an attractive car and always has been. It started life many moons ago as the Infiniti G35, then became the G37 when its engine got bigger. It finally graduated to the Q50 when Infiniti went to its current (and still confusing) naming structure. But the car’s look has transformed over the years from a simple, clean design to one that’s more passionate, curvaceous and animalistic. The spindle grille and cat’s-eye headlights are more tasteful than anything found on a Lexus these days, and they’re starting to finally help develop an Infiniti design theme that’s spread across the brand (the Q60 coupe version of this line is especially pretty).\n\nThe Infiniti Q50 may not have the classic lines of the Mercedes-Benz C-Class, but it’s still a very appealing design – especially with the optional larger machine-finished wheels to fill out the wells.\n\nHow It Drives\nThere are now three powertrains available in the Infiniti Q50: a basic 208-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder; a 300-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6; and a 400-hp version of that same 3.0-liter.\n\nMy test car came with the 2.0-liter four-cylinder and that engine’s problem was evident immediately: It’s underpowered. Nearly every other car in the class makes at least 30 more horsepower, and the Cadillac ATS smacks down the Infiniti with a 64-hp advantage with its own turbo engine. The Cadillac also boasts the lightest curb weight of the four competitors listed, while the Infiniti Q50 is the heaviest.\n\nThe engine’s torque figures aren’t much better. The Infiniti Q50 matches the Lexus IS 200t’s 258 pounds-feet of torque but comes up short of the Mercedes-Benz C300, at 273 pounds-feet, and the Cadillac ATS, at 295 pounds-feet. The result is a sedan that’s only adequately powered. I wouldn’t describe it as quick and I certainly wouldn’t call it assertive or sporty.\n\nThe four-cylinder is the same engine that’s found in the Mercedes-Benz C300, which weighs roughly 200 pounds less and is tuned to make more power and torque. The Benz feels considerably more robust. As in the Benz, the Infiniti’s turbo-four is mated to a standard 7-speed automatic transmission that’s smooth but not quick to downshift, even in Sport mode.\n\nThen there’s the sound the engine makes – a coarse, unrefined clatter that feels inadequately insulated. It’s hard to believe this is a powertrain shared with the smooth, quick, enjoyable C300. It’s tuned and integrated so differently in the Q50 that it loses any of the premium feel of the German sedan’s mechanicals.\n\nThe ride is stiff, with the Infiniti Q50 bouncing and hopping along on broken pavement in a most unpleasant fashion, thanks to front and rear anti-roll bars. That kind of road surface also affects the car’s steering, sending unwanted jitters through the steering wheel and even affecting the Q50’s tracking ability.\n\nThe base, 2.0-liter Q50 is equipped with standard hydraulic power steering. Higher trim levels have more modern electric-assist steering, which Infiniti calls Rack Electronic Power Steering. Infiniti’s fancy drive-by-wire electronic steering is optional on the 3.0-liter Q50. My test car also featured a non-adjustable suspension; the adjustable Dynamic Digital Suspension, which has electronically controlled adaptive shock absorbers, is optional. I haven’t driven it, but one would hope it’s tuned better than the standard car’s offering. Ditto on the by-wire Direct Adaptive Steering, which varies ratio, assist and feedback, and also cooperates with electronic safety systems. The 2016 Q50 debuts DAS’ second generation; the first didn’t impress.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz C300 is far more refined than the Infiniti in its handling, steering performance, ride quality and overall driving experience – astonishing, considering their shared powertrain. But the tuning, damping and isolation of the Benz is far superior. The BMW 3 Series, Cadillac ATS and the latest Audi A4 also feel a cut above the entry-level Infiniti.\n\nThe base Q50 feels like a premium vehicle, not a luxury vehicle. It’s out-performed in nearly every tactile, seat-of-the-pants metric by its numerous competitors. The only possible competitor with which it matches up well is the Lexus IS 200t, which still outguns the Infiniti in the horsepower department but features a similar driving experience.\n\nFuel economy is about average with the four-cylinder, rated 23/31/26 mpg city/highway/combined; I managed to average 26 mpg during my week with it. The Mercedes-Benz C300 manages to get a better 25/34/28 mpg rating despite getting more power from the same engine and transmission – chalk that up to its being lighter. The Cadillac ATS 2.0T scores a nearly identical 22/31/26 mpg rating, as does the Lexus IS 200t, at 22/33/26 mpg.\nInterior\nThe feeling that the Infiniti Q50 is merely a premium car and not a true luxury car is amplified by the cabin, which features a mix of nice leatherette (imitation leather) and cheap plastic; they feel no better than offerings from the mass-market Nissan division. The seats feel a bit small, though the quality of the artificial leather is actually quite impressive. (In this class, faux leather is usually the norm in base trim levels.)\n\nLess impressive is the faux-metal look of the trim panels on the dash and center console, which look like a fake applique. The steering wheel feels smaller and thinner than those in most modern competitors, but it’s not an issue. What is an issue are the various cheap-feeling switches and controls scattered throughout the cabin. Some are in places that are hard to find and operate while driving, such as a bank of buttons to the lower left of the steering wheel that are invisible to the driver.\n\nVisibility is good all around thanks to a low beltline and backseat passengers will find the space entirely adequate, especially when it comes to leg and foot room. The whole cabin feels bright and airy thanks to a selection of light, neutral colors for much of the interior. One wonders how such light colors will wear over time, however, and how much dirt they’ll show.\n\nBy contrast, the Mercedes-Benz C-Class feels more somber and upscale. It’s truly a baby S-Class in more ways than one, with a quality feel to all its materials and switches. The BMW 3 Series can make this claim, too, but competitors like the Cadillac ATS and Lexus IS fall short of those segment leaders, just as the Q50 does. The Infiniti Q50 may not be as pricey as a Mercedes C300, but neither does it feel like it should be.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nInfiniti has come up with a new multimedia system meant to bring modernity to its cars and it only partially succeeds. The usability of the new Infiniti InTouch system is certainly improved, with modern smartphone connectivity options, gesture control and downloadable apps. But the user-interface screen needs work. The font and even the display itself are far too small to be easily seen. Even seeing what song you’re playing requires serious concentration.\n\nThere are two touch-screens involved in this system: a lower one for multimedia and an upper one for vehicle-related systems like navigation. The lower one is flush with the console, shows fingerprints ridiculously easily and washes out in bright sunlight. While the system is an improvement over the old one, it needs another round or two of development work – with input from some Silicon Valley tech companies to get the user interface right.\nCargo & Storage\nThe Infiniti Q50 has grown some from previous versions, making it one of the largest vehicles in its class in terms of interior and cargo room. There’s 13.5 cubic feet of space in the trunk and it’s expandable thanks to fold-down rear seats. The IS 200t is a smidge bigger, at 13.8 cubic feet, and they’re both significantly bigger than either the ATS (10.4 cubic feet) or the C300 (12.6 cubic feet).\n\nSafety\nThe new Infiniti Q50 scored excellent marks in crash tests. It earned five stars overall from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, and marks of either good or acceptable in all tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. See its crash-test results here.\n\nThere isn’t much in the way of standard safety equipment in the Infiniti Q50 aside from a backup camera and plenty of airbags. Opt for the expensive Driver Assistance Package, though, and you come away with forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking; rain sensing wipers; blind spot warning; automatic backup collision intervention; parking sensors front and rear; and an around-view 360-degree camera for $2,250. It’s pricier than it appears, however, as it requires selecting a Premium trim model, and the addition of the $2,150 Premium Plus Package and the $1,000 Leather Seating Package as prerequisites. See all the Q50’s equipment here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe new Infiniti Q50 has several powertrain options available. It all starts with the 2.0T rear-wheel-drive model for $34,855, including destination fee. Adding AWD brings the price up $2,000 regardless of which powertrain or trim level you pick.\n\nFor $34,855, you get a 2.0T with the 208-hp, turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder, a standard seven-speed automatic, 17-inch wheels, automatic climate control and not much else. Moving up to the 3.0T Premium with its 300-hp, turbocharged V-6 will set you back $40,805 but still doesn’t include much more than the aforementioned standard features. Even a full leather interior is still extra. A 3.0T Sport model is available for $44,805, which adds the Dynamic Digital Suspension, larger brakes, 19-inch wheels and power-assist front bucket seats in leather. The top of the line is the 3.0T Infiniti Q50 Red Sport, which takes a Sport model and boosts power to 400 hp for $48,855. Load up that Red Sport with the Technology Package, AWD and more, and you’re almost touching $61,000.\n\nQ50 competitors abound. Our benchmark winner has been the Mercedes-Benz C-Class, which is a bit more expensive model-for-model, option-for-option than the Q50 but feels worth its price due to its sumptuous interior, refined driving dynamics and powerful engines. It outguns the base version of the Q50, but as the cars’ prices climb, so does the Q50’s ability to match the C-Class’ performance chops.\n\nThe Cadillac ATS is a good matchup for the Infiniti Q50 as both feature a compact, rear-wheel-drive chassis and an interior best described as premium, not luxury. The ATS can be had with a 2.5-liter, naturally aspirated four-cylinder, but most dealerships will stock the turbocharged 2.0-liter instead. It handily outguns the base Q50 when it comes to horsepower and torque, it can be had with a manual transmission, it’s a sharper-handling car and it has an arguably better multimedia system, as well.\n\nLexus offers a rear-wheel-drive compact sedan, too: the IS 200t. It’s smaller than the Infiniti Q50 by a few inches but matches up well with its content and premium materials, and it features more distinctive styling. Compare all four competitors here.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2021 Infiniti Q50?\n\nThe five-seat Q50 is Infiniti’s luxury sports sedan that blends spirited performance, comfort and technology. The base engine is a 300-horsepower, twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 that works with a seven-speed automatic transmission. The performance-oriented Red Sport model features a 400-hp variant of the V-6. Rear- and all-wheel-drive versions are available, and competitors include the Audi A4, BMW 3 Series and Lexus IS. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2021 Infiniti Q50?\n\nA new Sensory trim level features sport-oriented exterior styling cues, power-folding side mirrors, leather-trimmed sport seats, a Bose stereo, navigation and open-pore wood trim. \n\nWhat Features in the 2021 Infiniti Q50 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nLED headlights\nSimulated leather upholstery\nDual-screen multimedia system\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nAutomatic emergency braking\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nAdaptive suspension\nLeather-trimmed seats\nHeated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\n60/40-split, folding backseat\n360-degree camera system\nBlind spot warning\nLane departure warning\nAdaptive cruise control\nShould I Buy the 2021 Infiniti Q50?\n\nCompared to its class, the Q50 has more losses than wins. While it earns praise for its powerful V-6 engine, the sedan’s complicated multimedia system and underwhelming driving feel hold it back. With other great options in the sports sedan segment, it’s worth your while to check out the competition before making a purchase.",

      "expert_review": "The 2018 Infiniti Q50 is the latest iteration of one of Infiniti’s most popular cars, the compact luxury sedan originally named G35. The G35 was one of the first cars I had an automotive crush on, arriving on American shores the same year I got my driver’s license — 2002.\n\nThe new model year brings a light refresh for the Q50 that includes a new trim level structure. There are now four trims: Pure, Luxe, Sport and Red Sport 400. Each of the three engine options carry over: a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder; a twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6; and an up-tuned version of the latter for the Red Sport 400. The Pure comes only with the smaller engine, Luxe offers a choice of either, and the Sport and Red Sport 400 come only with the V-6. Infiniti offers rear- or all-wheel drive (for $2,000) across all the Q50’s trim levels and engine options.\n\nExterior changes include a new grille up front and a revised front fascia with new foglight housings. Inside, there’s a new steering wheel but not much else to speak of; the old dual-screen multimedia system remains. Q50 Red Sport models get the best leather and dark-chrome accents. A long list of safety technology is available. Compare the 2018 Q50 with last year’s model here.\n\nI tested a Q50 3.0t Sport with the larger engine and a few additional option packages, including the Essential Package ($2,500), ProAssist Package ($1,650), Performance Package ($1,500) and Sensory Package ($2,650), which drove the price up from the 3.0t’s starting point of $41,645 (including destination) to $50,410. Here are more details on what we tested:\n\n2018 Infiniti Q50 3.0t Sport\n\nPowertrain: 300-horsepower, twin-turbo 3.0-liter V-6 and 295 pounds-feet of torque; seven-speed automatic transmission; rear-wheel drive\nEstimated fuel economy: 20/29/23 mpg city/highway/combined\nKey features: Dual-display system, navigation, blind spot warning, 360-degree cameras, forward autonomous emergency braking, Dynamic Digital Suspension, 16-speaker Bose audio system, front and rear parking sensors\nPrice: $50,410 (including destination)\nHow It Drives\n\nMy favorite part of the Q50’s performance was the 300-hp, twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 that makes 295 pounds-feet of torque. The up-tuned version in the Red Sport 400 makes 400 hp (oh, now I get the name) and 350 pounds-feet of torque. The 2.0t’s 208-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder makes 258 pounds-feet of torque.\n\nDownscaling to the four-cylinder doesn’t net you much fuel-economy gain: an estimated 23/30/25 mpg for RWD models and 22/28/24 mpg with AWD. The 3.0t costs only 2 mpg combined (20/29/23 mpg with RWD, 19/27/22 mpg with AWD). Red Sport versions are similar, at 20/26/22 mpg with RWD and 19/26/22 mpg with AWD.\n\nThe reason I pinpoint the bigger engine as my favorite part of the Infinity Q50’s driving experience is because what’s attached to it is disappointing. The only transmission is a seven-speed automatic, and it’s a wet blanket even in the Q50’s more aggressive driving modes. My test car thankfully included the Performance Package, which added the adaptive Dynamic Digital Suspension, sport brakes and paddle shifters. The paddles were a godsend; choosing gears myself let the engine shine. It’s quick to get into its power and likes to rev, but any time I left the automatic to its own devices, there was a noticeable lag between pushing down the accelerator and any forward motion. There was a delay in acceleration while hoping the transmission would kick down a gear or two, as well as when mashing the pedal hard, hearing it hit the floor and then waiting for the car to realize, “oh, I should be moving.”\n\nFor a sedan of this price with sporty aspirations (it has Sport in its name, after all), the Q50’s handling leaves a lot to be desired. Even with the Dynamic Digital Suspension equipped — which firms up the suspension in more aggressive drive settings — I found there to be too much body roll. It made the car feel heavy in turns, which made me less confident to push it. Steering was not much better; it’s missing feedback and doesn’t feel linear coming off center. As a cruiser, the Q50 is fine, but when I asked more of it, I was left wanting. When you consider that the Infinity Q50 competes against agile and engaging cars like the Alfa Romeo Giulia and the Cadillac ATS, its shortcomings are highlighted even more.\n\nTwo Screens for What?\n\nInside, most of the center console is dedicated to the Q50’s dual-screen multimedia system. The top screen is recessed into the dash, where it displays navigation maps, phone functions (via Bluetooth) and the Infinity Q50’s camera display. To control this screen, you’ll have to use either a small knob behind the gear selector or your voice.\n\nThe lower screen, however, is a touchscreen. It sits in a flush, glossy panel and is surrounded by climate control buttons on either side and three buttons below (Audio, Menu and Climate) to help navigate the onscreen menus.\n\nI found the audio, climate and performance systems in the touchscreen easy enough to use, but the top display is a mess. The dial isn’t intuitive, which makes using the top screen — which houses some important functionality you can’t avoid — a chore. The 2018 Acura TLX has a similar two-screen setup with many of the same limitations. I didn’t like using the Acura’s weird dial for its top screen, either, but the TLX has a killer feature that the Q50 lacks: Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, which make the top screen much more useful.\n\nBecause the Infinity Q50 doesn’t offer those smartphone-mirroring technologies, the only option is to use Infiniti’s system, which either stymied or frustrated me multiple times in the week I drove the Q50.\n\nInterior\n\nThe rest of the interior is more competitive. The Sport 3.0t comes with real leather upholstery standard, and I found the sport seats to be supportive and comfortable. I did a long highway drive in the Q50 and didn’t feel any fatigue or soreness afterward.\n\nThe backseat doesn’t have much legroom, but that’s true of most of this class. Headroom is good, and the Q50 has large windows all around, which helps provide good visibility from all seats. Cargo room is 13.2 cubic feet for four-cylinder models and 13.5 cubic feet for V-6 models. That puts the Infinity Q50 mid-pack, with less room than the Acura TLX, about the same as the Audi A4 and a bit more than the Mercedes-Benz C300. Compare the Q50’s other specs and features against those models.\n\nSafety Not Guaranteed\nConclusion\n\nThe 2018 Infinity Q50’s updates don’t go far enough for me and definitely don’t solve the car’s biggest problems: a multimedia system and driving experience that don’t match the competition. We’ll have to get behind the wheel of a Red Sport 400 AWD to see if it holds up better (it does have a different steering system than the one on the 3.0t Sport I drove), but I’m skeptical — added horsepower doesn’t solve all ills.\n\nThe Q50 has its appeal as a stylish car that performs well enough as a cruiser. But with parts that are below average for this luxury class — including ones you interact with on a regular basis — the Q50 lags too far behind its competitors.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The 2018 Infiniti Q50 is the latest iteration of one of Infiniti’s most popular cars, the compact luxury sedan originally named G35. The G35 was one of the first cars I had an automotive crush on, arriving on American shores the same year I got my driver’s license — 2002.\n\nThe new model year brings a light refresh for the Q50 that includes a new trim level structure. There are now four trims: Pure, Luxe, Sport and Red Sport 400. Each of the three engine options carry over: a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder; a twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6; and an up-tuned version of the latter for the Red Sport 400. The Pure comes only with the smaller engine, Luxe offers a choice of either, and the Sport and Red Sport 400 come only with the V-6. Infiniti offers rear- or all-wheel drive (for $2,000) across all the Q50’s trim levels and engine options.\n\nExterior changes include a new grille up front and a revised front fascia with new foglight housings. Inside, there’s a new steering wheel but not much else to speak of; the old dual-screen multimedia system remains. Q50 Red Sport models get the best leather and dark-chrome accents. A long list of safety technology is available. Compare the 2018 Q50 with last year’s model here.\n\nI tested a Q50 3.0t Sport with the larger engine and a few additional option packages, including the Essential Package ($2,500), ProAssist Package ($1,650), Performance Package ($1,500) and Sensory Package ($2,650), which drove the price up from the 3.0t’s starting point of $41,645 (including destination) to $50,410. Here are more details on what we tested:\n\n2018 Infiniti Q50 3.0t Sport\n\nPowertrain: 300-horsepower, twin-turbo 3.0-liter V-6 and 295 pounds-feet of torque; seven-speed automatic transmission; rear-wheel drive\nEstimated fuel economy: 20/29/23 mpg city/highway/combined\nKey features: Dual-display system, navigation, blind spot warning, 360-degree cameras, forward autonomous emergency braking, Dynamic Digital Suspension, 16-speaker Bose audio system, front and rear parking sensors\nPrice: $50,410 (including destination)\nHow It Drives\n\nMy favorite part of the Q50’s performance was the 300-hp, twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 that makes 295 pounds-feet of torque. The up-tuned version in the Red Sport 400 makes 400 hp (oh, now I get the name) and 350 pounds-feet of torque. The 2.0t’s 208-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder makes 258 pounds-feet of torque.\n\nDownscaling to the four-cylinder doesn’t net you much fuel-economy gain: an estimated 23/30/25 mpg for RWD models and 22/28/24 mpg with AWD. The 3.0t costs only 2 mpg combined (20/29/23 mpg with RWD, 19/27/22 mpg with AWD). Red Sport versions are similar, at 20/26/22 mpg with RWD and 19/26/22 mpg with AWD.\n\nThe reason I pinpoint the bigger engine as my favorite part of the Infinity Q50’s driving experience is because what’s attached to it is disappointing. The only transmission is a seven-speed automatic, and it’s a wet blanket even in the Q50’s more aggressive driving modes. My test car thankfully included the Performance Package, which added the adaptive Dynamic Digital Suspension, sport brakes and paddle shifters. The paddles were a godsend; choosing gears myself let the engine shine. It’s quick to get into its power and likes to rev, but any time I left the automatic to its own devices, there was a noticeable lag between pushing down the accelerator and any forward motion. There was a delay in acceleration while hoping the transmission would kick down a gear or two, as well as when mashing the pedal hard, hearing it hit the floor and then waiting for the car to realize, “oh, I should be moving.”\n\nFor a sedan of this price with sporty aspirations (it has Sport in its name, after all), the Q50’s handling leaves a lot to be desired. Even with the Dynamic Digital Suspension equipped — which firms up the suspension in more aggressive drive settings — I found there to be too much body roll. It made the car feel heavy in turns, which made me less confident to push it. Steering was not much better; it’s missing feedback and doesn’t feel linear coming off center. As a cruiser, the Q50 is fine, but when I asked more of it, I was left wanting. When you consider that the Infinity Q50 competes against agile and engaging cars like the Alfa Romeo Giulia and the Cadillac ATS, its shortcomings are highlighted even more.\n\nTwo Screens for What?\n\nInside, most of the center console is dedicated to the Q50’s dual-screen multimedia system. The top screen is recessed into the dash, where it displays navigation maps, phone functions (via Bluetooth) and the Infinity Q50’s camera display. To control this screen, you’ll have to use either a small knob behind the gear selector or your voice.\n\nThe lower screen, however, is a touchscreen. It sits in a flush, glossy panel and is surrounded by climate control buttons on either side and three buttons below (Audio, Menu and Climate) to help navigate the onscreen menus.\n\nI found the audio, climate and performance systems in the touchscreen easy enough to use, but the top display is a mess. The dial isn’t intuitive, which makes using the top screen — which houses some important functionality you can’t avoid — a chore. The 2018 Acura TLX has a similar two-screen setup with many of the same limitations. I didn’t like using the Acura’s weird dial for its top screen, either, but the TLX has a killer feature that the Q50 lacks: Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, which make the top screen much more useful.\n\nBecause the Infinity Q50 doesn’t offer those smartphone-mirroring technologies, the only option is to use Infiniti’s system, which either stymied or frustrated me multiple times in the week I drove the Q50.\n\nInterior\n\nThe rest of the interior is more competitive. The Sport 3.0t comes with real leather upholstery standard, and I found the sport seats to be supportive and comfortable. I did a long highway drive in the Q50 and didn’t feel any fatigue or soreness afterward.\n\nThe backseat doesn’t have much legroom, but that’s true of most of this class. Headroom is good, and the Q50 has large windows all around, which helps provide good visibility from all seats. Cargo room is 13.2 cubic feet for four-cylinder models and 13.5 cubic feet for V-6 models. That puts the Infinity Q50 mid-pack, with less room than the Acura TLX, about the same as the Audi A4 and a bit more than the Mercedes-Benz C300. Compare the Q50’s other specs and features against those models.\n\nSafety Not Guaranteed\nConclusion\n\nThe 2018 Infinity Q50’s updates don’t go far enough for me and definitely don’t solve the car’s biggest problems: a multimedia system and driving experience that don’t match the competition. We’ll have to get behind the wheel of a Red Sport 400 AWD to see if it holds up better (it does have a different steering system than the one on the 3.0t Sport I drove), but I’m skeptical — added horsepower doesn’t solve all ills.\n\nThe Q50 has its appeal as a stylish car that performs well enough as a cruiser. But with parts that are below average for this luxury class — including ones you interact with on a regular basis — the Q50 lags too far behind its competitors.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review for the 2016 Infiniti Q50 was written in June 2016, but little has changed for 2017. To see what’s new, click here, or to see a side-by-side comparison of the two model years, click here.\n\nInfiniti has updated its Q50 sedan for 2016 with a mild refresh, including some new powertrains, a light styling update and a revamped interior with a fresh multimedia system. Compare the 2015 and 2016 models here.\n\nAt entry level, there’s a new 2.0-liter, turbocharged four-cylinder from Mercedes-Benz. At the top end, there’s a fire-breathing, 400-hp twin-turbo V-6 and all-wheel drive. My week with a new 2016 Q50 was in the lower-end model. It’s more modestly priced but still well-equipped and more accessible to the masses. There’s also a two-door version, the Q60, covered separately.\n\nThe compact luxury sedan class is the entry point for any premium brand, where automakers draw in new buyers they hope will be lifelong customers. It’s also one of the most competitive segments on the market, with lots of distinct offerings. Key competitors include the Cadillac ATS, Lexus IS and Mercedes-Benz C-Class.\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nThe Q50 is an attractive car and always has been. It started life many moons ago as the Infiniti G35, then became the G37 when its engine got bigger. It finally graduated to the Q50 when Infiniti went to its current (and still confusing) naming structure. But the car’s look has transformed over the years from a simple, clean design to one that’s more passionate, curvaceous and animalistic. The spindle grille and cat’s-eye headlights are more tasteful than anything found on a Lexus these days, and they’re starting to finally help develop an Infiniti design theme that’s spread across the brand (the Q60 coupe version of this line is especially pretty). \n\nThe Q50 may not have the classic lines of the Mercedes-Benz C-Class, but it’s still a very appealing design – especially with the optional larger wheels to fill out the wells. \n\nHow It Drives\n\nThere are now three powertrains available in the Q50: a basic 208-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder; a 300-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6; and a 400-hp version of that same 3.0-liter. \n\nMy test car came with the 2.0-liter four-cylinder and that engine’s problem was evident immediately: It’s underpowered. Nearly every other car in the class makes at least 30 more horsepower, and the Cadillac ATS smacks down the Infiniti with a 64-hp advantage with its own turbo engine. The Cadillac also boasts the lightest curb weight of the four competitors listed, while the Q50 is the heaviest.\n\nThe engine’s torque figures aren’t much better. The Q50 matches the Lexus IS 200t’s 258 pounds-feet of torque but comes up short of the Mercedes-Benz C300, at 273 pounds-feet, and the Cadillac ATS, at 295 pounds-feet. The result is a sedan that’s only adequately powered. I wouldn’t describe it as quick and I certainly wouldn’t call it assertive or sporty.\n\nThe four-cylinder is the same engine that’s found in the Mercedes-Benz C300, which weighs roughly 200 pounds less and is tuned to make more power and torque. The Benz feels considerably more robust. As in the Benz, the Infiniti’s turbo-four is mated to a standard seven-speed automatic transmission that’s smooth but not quick to downshift, even in Sport mode.\n\nThen there’s the sound the engine makes – a coarse, unrefined clatter that feels inadequately insulated. It’s hard to believe this is a powertrain shared with the smooth, quick, enjoyable C300. It’s tuned and integrated so differently in the Q50 that it loses any of the premium feel of the German sedan’s mechanicals.\n\nThe ride is stiff, with the Q50 bouncing and hopping along on broken pavement in a most unpleasant fashion. That kind of road surface also affects the car’s steering, sending unwanted jitters through the steering wheel and even affecting the Q50’s tracking ability.\n\nThe base, 2.0-liter Q50 is equipped with standard hydraulic power steering. Higher trim levels have more modern electric-assist steering, which Infiniti calls Rack Electronic Power Steering. Infiniti’s fancy drive-by-wire electronic steering is optional on the 3.0-liter Q50. My test car also featured a non-adjustable suspension; the adjustable Dynamic Digital Suspension, which has electronically controlled adaptive shock absorbers, is optional. I haven’t driven it, but one would hope it’s tuned better than the standard car’s offering. Ditto on the by-wire Direct Adaptive Steering, which varies ratio, assist and feedback, and also cooperates with electronic safety systems. The 2016 Q50 debuts DAS’ second generation; the first didn’t impress.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz C300 is far more refined than the Infiniti in its handling, steering performance, ride quality and overall driving experience – astonishing, considering their shared powertrain. But the tuning, damping and isolation of the Benz is far superior. The BMW 3 Series, Cadillac ATS and the latest Audi A4 also feel a cut above the entry-level Infiniti. \n\nThe base Q50 feels like a premium vehicle, not a luxury vehicle. It’s out-performed in nearly every tactile, seat-of-the-pants metric by its numerous competitors. The only possible competitor with which it matches up well is the Lexus IS 200t, which still outguns the Infiniti in the horsepower department but features a similar driving experience. \n\nFuel economy is about average with the four-cylinder, rated 23/31/26 mpg city/highway/combined; I managed to average 26 mpg during my week with it. The Mercedes-Benz C300 manages to get a better 25/34/28 mpg rating despite getting more power from the same engine and transmission – chalk that up to its being lighter. The Cadillac ATS 2.0T scores a nearly identical 22/31/26 mpg rating, as does the Lexus IS 200t, at 22/33/26 mpg. \n\nInterior\n\nThe feeling that the Q50 is merely a premium car and not a true luxury car is amplified by the cabin, which features a mix of nice leatherette (imitation leather) and cheap plastic; they feel no better than offerings from the mass-market Nissan division. The seats feel a bit small, though the quality of the artificial leather is actually quite impressive. (In this class, faux leather is usually the norm in base trim levels.) \n\nLess impressive is the faux-metal look of the trim panels on the dash and center console, which look like a fake applique. The steering wheel feels smaller and thinner than those in most modern competitors, but it’s not an issue. What is an issue are the various cheap-feeling switches and controls scattered throughout the cabin. Some are in places that are hard to find and operate while driving, such as a bank of buttons to the lower left of the steering wheel that are invisible to the driver. \n\nVisibility is good all around thanks to a low beltline and backseat passengers will find the space entirely adequate, especially when it comes to leg and foot room. The whole cabin feels bright and airy thanks to a selection of light, neutral colors for much of the interior. One wonders how such light colors will wear over time, however, and how much dirt they’ll show.\n\nBy contrast, the Mercedes-Benz C-Class feels more somber and upscale. It’s truly a baby S-Class in more ways than one, with a quality feel to all its materials and switches. The BMW 3 Series can make this claim, too, but competitors like the Cadillac ATS and Lexus IS fall short of those segment leaders, just as the Q50 does. The Q50 may not be as pricey as a Mercedes C300, but neither does it feel like it should be.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nInfiniti has come up with a new multimedia system meant to bring modernity to its cars and it only partially succeeds. The usability of the new Infiniti InTouch system is certainly improved, with modern smartphone connectivity options, gesture control and downloadable apps. But the user-interface screen needs work. The font and even the display itself are far too small to be easily seen. Even seeing what song you’re playing requires serious concentration. \n\nThere are two touch-screens involved in this system: a lower one for multimedia and an upper one for vehicle-related systems like navigation. The lower one is flush with the console, shows fingerprints ridiculously easily and washes out in bright sunlight. While the system is an improvement over the old one, it needs another round or two of development work – with input from some Silicon Valley tech companies to get the user interface right. \n\nCargo & Storage\n\nThe Q50 has grown some from previous versions, making it one of the largest vehicles in its class in terms of interior and cargo room. There’s 13.5 cubic feet of space in the trunk and it’s expandable thanks to fold-down rear seats. The IS 200t is a smidge bigger, at 13.8 cubic feet, and they’re both significantly bigger than either the ATS (10.4 cubic feet) or the C300 (12.6 cubic feet). \n\nSafety\n\nThe new Q50 scored excellent marks in crash tests. It earned five stars overall from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, and marks of either good or acceptable in all tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. \n\nThere isn’t much in the way of standard safety equipment in the Q50 aside from a backup camera and plenty of airbags. Opt for the expensive Driver Assistance Package, though, and you come away with forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking; rain sensing wipers; blind spot warning; automatic backup collision intervention; parking sensors front and rear; and an around-view 360-degree camera for $2,250. It’s pricier than it appears, however, as it requires selecting a Premium trim model, and the addition of the $2,150 Premium Plus Package and the $1,000 Leather Seating Package as prerequisites. See all the Q50’s equipment here.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nThe new Q50 has several powertrain options available. It all starts with the 2.0T rear-wheel-drive model for $34,855, including destination fee. Adding all-wheel drive brings the price up $2,000 regardless of which powertrain or trim level you pick. \n\nFor $34,855, you get a 2.0T with the 208-hp, turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder, a standard seven-speed automatic, 17-inch wheels, automatic climate control and not much else. Moving up to the 3.0T Premium with its 300-hp, turbocharged V-6 will set you back $40,805 but still doesn’t include much more than the aforementioned standard features. Even a full leather interior is still extra. A 3.0T Sport model is available for $44,805, which adds the Dynamic Digital Suspension, larger brakes, 19-inch wheels and leather seats. The top of the line is the 3.0T Red Sport, which takes a Sport model and boosts power to 400 hp for $48,855. Load up that Red Sport with the Technology Package, all-wheel drive and more, and you’re almost touching $61,000.\n\nQ50 competitors abound. Our benchmark winner has been the Mercedes-Benz C-Class, which is a bit more expensive model-for-model, option-for-option than the Q50 but feels worth its price due to its sumptuous interior, refined driving dynamics and powerful engines. It outguns the base version of the Q50, but as the cars’ prices climb, so does the Q50’s ability to match the C-Class’ performance chops. \n\nThe Cadillac ATS is a good matchup for the Q50 as both feature a compact, rear-wheel-drive chassis and an interior best described as premium, not luxury. The ATS can be had with a 2.5-liter, naturally aspirated four-cylinder, but most dealerships will stock the turbocharged 2.0-liter instead. It handily outguns the base Q50 when it comes to horsepower and torque, it can be had with a manual transmission, it’s a sharper-handling car and it has an arguably better multimedia system, as well. \n\nLexus offers a rear-wheel-drive compact sedan, too: the IS 200t. It’s smaller than the Q50 by a few inches but matches up well with its content and premium materials, and it features more distinctive styling. Compare all four competitors here.",
