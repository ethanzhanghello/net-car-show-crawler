      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in February 2007 about the 2007 Infiniti FX45. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what details are different this year, check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nEarly ads for Infiniti’s FX45 added a superscript “2” beside the “S” in SUV. You didn’t have to remember seventh-grade algebra to get the drift: This SUV was intended to bring “sport” to the second power.\n\nThat tagline still rings true. The 2007 FX45 sets the bar low for utility, but its energetic acceleration and sharp handling will leave drivers confused: Is this a 4,400-pound SUV or a king-sized version of Nissan’s 350Z sports car?\n\nIn the four years since the FX45 debuted, like-minded competitors from BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Audi have reached new heights in design, technology and cabin quality. But the Infiniti doesn’t feel a great distance behind, and it performs with the best of them. Factor in its $50,000 starting price — a relative bargain, given the litany of standard features — and it is well worth a look.\n\nTwo Parts Sport\nInfiniti’s acclaimed 4.5-liter V-8 is standard in the FX45. It makes 320 horsepower and 335 pounds-feet of torque and teams with a five-speed automatic transmission. All-wheel drive is standard. The FX35, listed separately in Cars.com’s Research section, gets a 275-hp V-6 and rear-wheel drive, with all-wheel drive optional.\n\nThe driveline can split power 50/50 between the front and rear axles, but under most conditions it sends more power to the rear. As such, the FX45 feels like a traditional rear-wheel-drive sports car: It pushes, rather than pulls, you forward. The V-8 wastes little time on such efforts, offering fluid bursts of power from a standing start. The transmission is equally agreeable, with wide first and second gears for the engine to rev high and produce even more power. It can do so with just a modest prod on the accelerator — no flooring required.\n\nOn the highway, I was able to pass with confidence, pulling briskly from 60 mph to 70 mph without the automatic downshifting. When downshifts are needed, the high-end power becomes downright exhilarating.\n\nNaturally, none of this comes for free. With the big V-8 and all-wheel drive, the FX45 gets just 16 mpg in combined city and highway driving, according to EPA estimates.\n\nThe three-spoke steering wheel can be something of a bear around the parking lot, with minimal power assistance and sections of lumpy, unresponsive turning. It straightens itself out at higher speeds, rendering course changes with reasonable precision.\n\nOn the highway, the four-wheel-independent suspension imparts a solid feel, with no unsolicited jitters seeping into the cabin. Quick lane changes induce noticeable body roll, but under most situations it’s well mitigated. On bumpy roads, the ride becomes a bit rough, as the 20-inch wheels and thin all-season tires don’t offer a lot of cushioning. (Eighteen-inch wheels and thicker tires, which presumably offer better ride comfort, are available on the FX35.)\n\nAround corners, the FX45 feels rear-heavy, more so than its 54/46 front-to-rear weight distribution would suggest. Stomp on the accelerator too quickly, and the back end can easily come loose. The standard electronic stability system allows plenty of slippage before intervening, too.\n\nCombined, the rear-biased driveline and hands-off stability system are not optimal for low-traction situations, as I experienced when our Chicago offices got snowed-in. The FX45’s center differential employs a viscous coupling to transfer power from the rear wheels to the front. On packed snow, it often let the rear wheels spin for a few moments before sending power up front. The transmission’s Snow Mode, activated with a dashboard button, starts things out in second gear. It reduced undue wheelspin but did little to effect quicker all-wheel-drive response.\n\nOne Part Utility\nWhile many midsize SUVs have begun to offer three rows of seats, the Infiniti sticks to two. I’m 5-foot-11, and I found headroom and legroom adequate up front. I had the driver’s seat an inch from all the way back, though, so taller folks might find the space too tight. In the second row, the outboard seats offer plenty of room thanks to broad footwells and a higher ceiling than the car’s outward shape suggests. Foot room for the unfortunate middle passenger is even worse than usual, as there’s a tall center hump to accommodate the driveshaft.\n\nWhere the FX really falls short is in cargo room. With the second row up, cargo volume in back measures 27.4 cubic feet. That’s roughly on par with the BMW X5 and Mercedes-Benz ML500, but far less than the Lexus RX 350 (38.3 cubic feet) and Acura MDX (42.9). In the FX45, folding the second-row seats makes for a nearly flat load floor, which expands maximum luggage room to 64.5 cubic feet — still behind the ML500 (72.4), MDX (83.5) and RX 350 (84.7).\n\nWhen properly equipped, the FX45 can tow 3,500 pounds. Same story here: It’s handily out-towed by the V-8 X5 (6,000 pounds) and even the V-6 MDX (5,000 pounds). To see how the FX45 measures up in full specs against those competitors, as well as the ML500, click here.\n\nStyling & Quality\nWhen the FX debuted for 2003, Infiniti termed the eccentric styling its “Bionic Cheetah” motif. The menacing headlights, huge grille and slung-back passenger compartment gave it a concept car’s aura. Even today, after four years’ assimilation, the FX45 still looks mildly futuristic.\n\nInside, elements like orange gauges and a gangly transmission shifter have passed their prime. The premium materials and impressive fit and finish are commendable, however, and the overall feel is reasonably contemporary. It’s not the tomorrowland of the redesigned MDX, but neither is it yesterday’s leftovers.\n\nSafety & Reliability\nIn frontal crash tests, both the FX35 and FX45 earned scores of Good from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. IIHS has not tested the car for side impacts.\n\nStandard safety equipment includes dual front airbags, seat-mounted side-impact airbags for the front seats and side curtain airbags for both rows. The front seats have active head restraints. Four-wheel-disc antilock brakes, traction control and an electronic stability system are also standard.\n\nLane Departure Warning and Intelligent Cruise Control are bundled into the optional Technology Package. Click on the corresponding photos in the right-hand column for more information.\n\nIn back, child-seat accommodations include Latch child-seat anchors for outboard positions and ceiling-mounted top-tether anchors for all three positions. Parents should note that the lower anchors are buried deep beneath the seat cushions — not the most user-friendly position.\n\nLong-term ownership is a safe bet. Based on its four years in the market, the FX is rated Above Average for predicted reliability by Consumer Reports. According to Cars.com’s Total Cost of Ownership calculator, it would cost an estimated $16,566 to own an FX45 for five years, excluding the purchase price. That’s a lot less than it would cost to own an X5 4.8i ($20,617) or ML500 ($33,593). (As of publication, there was no data available for the redesigned MDX.)\n\nFeatures\nThe all-wheel-drive FX45 starts at $49,850, excluding the destination charge. It comes well-equipped with an automatic transmission, 20-inch alloy wheels, a keyless startup system, a moonroof, dual-zone automatic climate control, heated leather upholstery and power front seats. A power tilt/telescoping steering wheel, 300-watt Bose stereo and rearview backup camera are also standard.\n\nOptions include a navigation system, Intelligent Cruise Control, Lane Departure Warning, a backseat DVD entertainment system and run-flat tires. Curiously, Infiniti does not offer two items common in this class — a power liftgate and an auxiliary audio jack for MP3 players.\n\nFX45 in the Market\nReactions to the FX depend largely on one’s definition of an SUV. Luxury traditionalists seeking outright utility will wonder why something costs so much yet does so little. They should avoid the FX for something more useful, like a Lexus RX 350 or Cadillac SRX.\n\nLuckily for Infiniti, though, SUV buyers have proliferated beyond the utility-focused. Now there are those who want a car that’s fun to drive but need something roomier than a low-slung coupe, or even a regular sedan. The industry has responded with the FX and similar competitors, many of which have eclipsed Infiniti and taken the spotlight with flashier cabins and high-tech features. Make no mistake, though: The FX45 remains competitive and — feature for feature — it’s cheaper than many of the others. In short, it is still very much in the game.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "In January 2002, when Infiniti unveiled the production version of its new SUV at the Detroit auto show, the senior vice president of design, Shiro Nakamura, called his Infiniti FX45 a “bionic cheetah.” This might have seemed like hyperbole, had we any idea what Nakamura was talking about.\n\nBut there’s no denying that the ultra-sleek FX45, which went on sale a year later as a 2003 model, certainly set a precedent. Check out the new Ford Edge and Lincoln MKX, and even the Saturn Outlook and GMC Acadia, and they look a bit like a bionic subspecies of the cheetah. Even Nissan co-opted the design for its own Murano, which is less extreme than the FX45, but still regarded as a template for handsome SUV styling.\n\nNow, more than four years after the FX45’s introduction, it still looks great, and it still doesn’t make a lot of sense as an SUV. The “Sport” is there, but the “Utility” — not so much. Despite the 4.5-liter, 320-horsepower V-8, it will tow only 3,500 pounds. The FX45 weighs nearly 4,500 pounds, and the weight, the power and the full-time all-wheel-drive conspire to guarantee miserable fuel mileage — the EPA rating is 14 miles per gallon in the city, 18 mpg highway, and premium gas is required.\n\nInside, the X45’s swoopy shape does not make for massive load-carrying space. This is why some SUVs, such as Infiniti’s own truck-based QX56, are shaped like boxes: Boxes, after all, are pretty efficient for carrying stuff. But obviously, that isn’t what the FX45 is about. Yes, it’s all-wheel-drive, but the big 20-inch tires and wheels are for grip on pavement, not mud. And while the FX56 is no fun on winding roads, the FX45, built on a chassis shared with the Nissan 350Z sports car, is.\n\nInside, the FX45’s cockpit was trendy in 2003, and seems a little dated now. Front and center is a 7-inch color screen for the navigation system, but the controls around it aren’t particularly intuitive. Otherwise, this is a very comfortable place to be. I recall complaining about the too- rough ride in the original FX45, but the company has smoothed that out without giving up the handling.\n\nThe V-8 engine has plenty of power, and the five-speed automatic transmission makes good use of it, though shifting is a little jerky at lower speeds. If you can live with less power, there’s the less-expensive FX35, with a 3.5-liter, 275-horse V-6.\n\nThe FX45 is absolutely loaded with standard equipment, but the test model still had lots of options, including a rear-seat DVD player ($1,400) and a “technology package” that added the nav system, satellite radio, active cruise control and a few other features, pricey at $4,200. Shipping and a few lesser options brought the $49,850 base price to a heady $56,570. You want cheetah? Expect to pay for it.",

      "expert_review": "Is your significant other hounding you that your next vehicle should be an SUV? Is this a problem because what you really want is some fancy pants sports sedan?\n\nNissan’s Infiniti division has the answer: the FX45.\n\nYou see, it has the general statistics of a luxury SUV, with all-wheel-drive and a big V-8, but it also has an athletic stance and sporty rounded shape.\n\nHow does it perform? I’ll get to that in a minute.\n\nFirst, some specifics.\n\nThe FX45 and its sibling, the FX35, are built from the same platform as the rear-drive Infiniti G35 sports sedan. The FX35 is available in rear- or all-wheel-drive and can be had with Nissan’s ubiquitous 3.5-liter V-6 rated at 280-horsepower. Not a bad deal.\n\nBut the FX45 comes only with Infiniti’s 4.5-liter 315-horsepower V-8 (courtesy of the Infiniti Q45) and all-wheel-drive. Both vehicles are mated to a standard five-speed automatic transmission.\n\nInfiniti provided an FX45 for testing.\n\nIt proved to be quite powerful. So powerful, in fact, that I can’t repeat the expletives I uttered upon initial acceleration.\n\nThis truck is invincibly forceful. There isn’t a gap in traffic too small to squeeze through, and few stoplight grand prix that a driver can’t win.\n\nThat said, there are some caveats.\n\nAll that power passed through an all-wheel-drive system means that gas mileage is anemic. Indeed, the test mileage of 16 mpg included quite a lot of highway driving.\n\nBut it’s the handling that is not garden variety.\n\nThe FX45 comes with huge 20-inch tires that do much to enhance its muscular looks. But those tires tend to wander, pulling the vehicle to the left or right, even if you are pointed straight ahead. The light steering is so quick, it’s of little help. While the steering does stiffen somewhat at highway speeds, it adds little to the driving experience.\n\nWith those large tires hooked to a sports-tuned suspension, I don’t have to tell you how firm the ride becomes over Pennsylvania’s third-world roads. It certainly doesn’t feel luxurious.\n\nAnd while the firm ride might be excused for the sporty handling, it’s too easy to get in over your head in this vehicle. Push it hard into a corner, like a sports car, and suddenly the tires start to tango and the body lean kicks in. For enthusiasts, handling won’t be problem.\n\nSo, this is a beast that needs the driver’s total concentration. Do something stupid like talk on a cell phone or eat a burrito while driving and you could end up off-road unintentionally.\n\nThe interior has the traditional modern Nissan/Infiniti appearance, trimmed in a striking combination of bronze and dark gray. It is quite handsome.\n\nThe front bucket seats are firm but comfortable, although the passenger’s side front seat is lacking in the number of adjustments, considering that this is a luxury vehicle.\n\nThe back seats (Inf initi doesn’t offer three rows in the FX) are comfortable enough, yet access to them is compromised by the narrow opening at the bottom of the rear doors.\n\nThe rear cargo compartment is nicely trimmed, but space is at a premium due to the car’s styling as well as its full-sized spare tire. A nice touch is the placement of handles on either side of the cargo compartment to release the split-folding rear seats.\n\nThe center console has the usual video screen that incorporates a global positioning system, audio system, climate controls and trip computer. As on the Infiniti Q45, a blizzard of buttons makes all of it seem less than luxurious and more of a chore.\n\nOver the top options include a rear-mounted video camera that turns on when the vehicle is shifted into reverse to compensate for the limited rear view.\n\nThe image appears on the FX’s video screen.\n\nAnother option is the intelligent key. When the key is nearby in a pocket or purse for example, FX sensors allow the car to be unlocked by pushing a button on the exterior door handle or start the car by turning the ignition.\n\nAll of this can be done without putting the key in the ignition, as long as the key is within close proximity of the FX.\n\nWhile an enthusiast will say this car is filled with performance and character, an average buyer might find it over the top, especially at the car’s $44,225 base price.\n\nThe FX35 starts at just over $35,000.\n\nWorrisome was this vehicle’s build quality. While I could chalk off the FX45’s squeaks and rattles to the fact that it is a well-used press sample, it’s harder to excuse the driver’s side window that balked at opening or the CD player that wouldn’t function.\n\nWith tons of speed and a driving experience that commands attention, the FX45 will capture the hearts of driving enthusiasts. For most others, it might seem like a frivolous purchase.",
