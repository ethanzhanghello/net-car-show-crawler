      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nRoughly slotted in the middle of Infinitis four-model sedan lineup, the luxury-performance I35 gets only a few modifications for the 2004 model year. A sunroof, a powered rear sunshade and side sills become standard this year.\n\nEvolved from the Nissan Maxima, this midsize front-wheel-drive sedan was last redesigned for 2000. After the 2001 model year, a larger V-6 engine was installed, which prompted a model designation change from I30 to I35.\n\nPreviously the most popular Infiniti model, its been eclipsed by the G35 sport sedan that debuted in 2003. Topping the Infiniti line is the plush Q45, and a full-size M45 sedan is also available.\n\nExterior\nApart from the roof, no other body panels are shared between the I35 and Maxima. The I35s hood creases are prominent, and a Q45-style titanium-colored grille sits between xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights.\n\nMounted on a 108.3-inch wheelbase, the I35 is 193.7 inches long overall, 70.2 inches wide and 57 inches tall. Alloy wheels hold 17-inch tires. An optional Sport Package includes Vehicle Dynamic Control, a sport-tuned suspension, special eight-spoke alloy wheels and side sill spoilers. A full-size spare tire is optional.\n\nInterior\nFive people fit inside the four-door I35. The 60/40-split rear seatback folds for additional cargo space. A 200-watt seven-speaker Bose sound system with an in-dash six-CD changer is standard. The radio operates using Radio Data System (RDS) technology and includes a cassette player and steering-wheel audio controls. The driver changes gears using a serpentine-style shift gate. Heated front and rear seats are available.\n\nThe seats are upholstered with Sojourner leather and flank a wood-accented console. A classically styled analog clock sits in the center of the dashboard. Nissans Bird View navigation system is optional. Trunk capacity is 14.9 cubic feet.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe 24-valve, 3.5-liter dual-overhead-cam V-6 engine produces 255 horsepower and mates with a four-speed-automatic transmission. An electronically controlled throttle is used.\n\nSafety\nSide-impact airbags for the front seats are standard. Active head restraints for the front occupants move up and forward in a rear-end collision to reduce the chance of whiplash injuries. Traction control and antilock brakes with electronic brake-force distribution and Brake Assist are standard. Vehicle Dynamic Control is offered as part of the Sport Package.\n\nDriving Impressions\nSolid execution and satisfying behavior translate to overall excellence in a well-made sedan thats far more substance than flashiness. The I35 is smooth in operation in nearly every respect, and it delivers down-to-business luxury with a pleasant and functional interior.\n\nEven when it is pushed hard, the engine is extra quiet in a well-controlled prompt-responding powertrain. Passing power is super, with nearly instantaneous downshifts that deliver refined yet vigorous acceleration. Above-average handling falls short of sporty, but the I35 steers easily and accurately with a fine feel. The sedan doesnt ignore bumps, but its suspension takes the edge off most of them.\n\nFront-seat space is good but not exceptional, but rear headroom and legroom are tight for average-sized adults. Despite fairly short bottoms, the seats are inviting, comfortable and supportive. Brightly lit, easy-to-read gauges enhance driving pleasure.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com;\nPosted on 9/26/03",

      "expert_review": "The sweet spot in the automotive market these days centers around $30,000 – at that level, you have an impressive array of indulgent vehicles from which to choose.\n\nThey are all well-equipped, and cover a spectrum of approaches ranging from luxurious to sporty, with a lot of cross-pollination along the way. The average transaction price of new vehicles sold in the U.S. these days lies a few thousand below that level, so the $30K neighborhood is populated by what the industry optimistically calls “low-end luxury” vehicles. It could well be argued that the extra few grand buy a disproportionate increase in content, vs. something less pretentious, like a loaded Camry or Accord.\n\nThe hard part will be finding one that is just right for you. This week’s guest, the Infinity I35, is competing against such worthy choices as the Acura TL, Audi A4, BMW 3 Series, Jaguar X, Lexus ES300, Lincoln LS, Mercedes-Benz C Class, to name a few. I doubt that anyone would feel cursed by fate if stuck in any one of those. For that matter, the I35’s half-sister is the Nissan Maxima, which, though not quite so luxurious, is still a fine ride.\n\nI can only say, if you’re looking at this class, you’d be wise to do some proper test drives – they’re all winners, and sufficiently different one from another to make my life interesting. The I35 is one of the blander-looking cars in the class, although its interior is very pleasant to lounge in.\n\nShould you gravitate toward the I35, I’d offer this counsel – accept it as an overly-qualified entry-level luxury ride, and don’t try to make it a sports sedan.\n\nThat’s what the fleet coordinators at Nissan did with the one they sent me – they added the optional sport package ($1,700), which, to my mind, detracted from the overall effect. This bundle gets you specific alloy wheels, leather-wrapped steering wheel and shifter, side sills, sport-tuned suspension, vehicle dynamic control and stiffer, slightly wider V-rated tires in place of the standard H-rated skins.\n\nMy sense is that going from 215/55 H tires to 225/50 Vs should not per se make much difference in either performance or ride quality. (V-rated tires are safe at continuous speeds up to 149 mph; Hs are worth 130 mph – not much of an issue here.)\n\nSo it must have been the suspension tweaks which resulted in a ride quality I deemed inappropriate for a vehicle with luxury pretensions. The ride was distinctly firm, though not shockingly so; the main complaint was that too much harshness is allowed to slip past the shocks and springs. Even expansion joints were annoying.\n\nThe steering felt somewhat vague, and distant, too, which is acceptable in a luxury car, but given the sporty underpinnings, seemed dissonant in this case. With crisper steering feel, the road-awareness might seem more plausible. I’d say skip the suspension package and go for the softer approach – or look at the German iron.\n\nThe I35 is not actually a new model, tho ugh it supplants the I30 in the lineup. The name reflects a very important underhood change this year; the old 3.0-liter motor has been retired in favor of a hot 3.5 virtually identical with the one used in the Maxima and the new Altima. All-aluminum, with slippery molybdenum coating the sliding parts, the V-6 has four valves per cylinder, managed by twin overhead camshafts. There’s no variable intake geometry or camshaft trickery, but output is a very respectable 255 hp (at a lofty 5,800 rpm) and 246 foot-pounds of torque (at 4,400 rpm).\n\nThese numbers are achieved on premium fuel, but the I35 is reasonable in its demands for it. EPA estimates are 20 mpg city, 26 highway with the automatic transmission I tested. My log shows 24.4 in some fairly aerobic exercising.\n\nWith a curb weight of 3,342 pounds, it made the 0-60 sprint in a shade over seven seconds, without undue urging. The front tires chirped a bit as the power surged through them, but the traction control quickly intervened.\n\nIncluded as part of the sport package is what Infiniti calls vehicle dynamic control (VDC). Familiar now on luxury cars, this is a way of utilizing sensors on the car to keep the driver from doing at least one stupid thing, viz., asking for harder turning than the physical realities would allow.\n\nA little computer is programmed to observe the steering wheel angle, the rate of vehicle yaw and any slippage at the tire-road interface. Should too much be asked of the car, it sends a command to the appropriate wheel to apply braking force. It can also tell the engine to cool it.\n\nIt worked quite well on the I35 and indeed, I like it much better on a front-drive car than rear-drive. With FWD machines, the front tires are not only steering, they’re propelling the vehicle and are more prone to overload, resulting in understeer, a condition in which the car refuses to turn as tightly as requested. VDC precludes that from becoming hazardous to one’s health.\n\nThe automatic transmission was excellent, popping quick, nearly imperceptible shifts, even under heavy throttle. Pulling the console-mounted shifter lever left, from the Drive position, engages third, i.e., disengages overdrive. You’ll do this fairly often if you prefer to augment the brakes with engine braking. Overall gearing is so high that for serious grades, you’ll want to use second to get some serious retarding force.\n\nAt freeway speeds, the I35 was on the hushed side of quiet. The major noise component seemed to be the tires, again perhaps to be blamed on the sport package.\n\nThe brakes were outstanding. Discs fore and aft are generously sized, and backed by an efficient antilock mechanism as well as brake assist, which speeds up the application when it detects an unusually forceful tromp on the pedal.\n\nThe I35 has the usual two-stage front air bags, as well as side-impact bags for first class.\n\nIn National Highway Traffic Safety Administration crash tests, the I35 got four stars (on a five-star scale) across the board for occupant protection in frontal and side impacts.\n\nOn the tougher tests conducted by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, it was rated “acceptable,” the second-highest category. The biggest area of concern was firewall intrusion down low, which made the likelihood of foot injuries unacceptably great.\n\nConsumers Union’s surveys of their readership have given the current series of I30s and Maximas well-above-average scores in every mechanical category, a trend which should persist in the I35.\n\nThe car is loaded with luxury features – the usual power niceties plus leather seats, wood, and a terrific sound system, a Bose rig with AM, FM, cassette and six-disc in-dash CD player.\n\nThe instruments are handsome and models of legibility, save for the signature analog clock, which was nearly impossible to see in sunlight. Headlamps are Xenon high-intensity types, with wide dis persion and a sharp vertical cutoff.\n\nThe test car had, in addition to the sport package, a full-sized spare with alloy wheel, $180; power moonroof and power rear sunshade, $1,380; a $2,000 navigation system (with trunk-mounted 6-CD database), and a cold weather package for $700, which gets you heated front and rear seats plus heated steering wheel and outside rearview mirrors.\n\nTotal, with freight, was $35,255. Payments on that very one would be $715, assuming 48 coupons, 10 percent interest and 20 percent down.\n\nIf you could skip the options packages, you could duck in under 30 grand. And Edmunds.com avers that most people are wangling about a $2,000 discount off list. At that the I35 would be a strong contender, if it suits your tastes.\n\n“The Gannett News Service”",
