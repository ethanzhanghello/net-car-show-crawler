      "expert_review": "Infiniti’s tagline for the QX56 is “Luxury on a Grand Scale.” To me, that conjures up images of sailing a yacht through the warm Mediterranean, being served champagne and caviar by the deck boy. Can the Infiniti QX56 inject luxury into my real life where dining on peanut butter and honey is a more realistic expectation?\n\nFirst off, let’s get the obvious out of the way. For those of you wondering why this photo looks suspiciously like the Nissan Pathfinder Armada, it’s because it’s essentially the same car. Infiniti is an upscale division of Nissan. The difference is quite obvious in both the price tag and the upgraded standard equipment.\n\nSome of the upgrades that come standard on the QX56 are mom-friendly leather seats and a navigation system. The navigation is bit tricky at first, but basically functional after a few weeks of practice.\n\nThe 2005 model year will add a standard rear view monitor display (visual) and rear proximity sensor (audio). This is something that I feel strongly should be added to every vehicle on the road. When the car is in reverse, a tiny camera eye, mounted above the license plate, transmits the image to a center dash monitor for a full and clear view behind the car. Color coded guide lines on the screen indicate the vehicle’s clearance, while an audible beep also lets you know when an object is in the way. I live next to our neighborhood school bus stop, and found this monitor a literal lifesaver when a child dashed behind the car on her way to the bus.\n\nThe QX56 seats either seven or eight people. My test car is a seven-seater with second row captain’s chairs and room for three little people (or two forward-facing car seats) in the third row. The captain’s chairs are great for child car seat installation. The seatback angle of each one can be adjusted independently. This is wonderful for my 4-year-old who recently graduated to a booster seat but still occasionally falls asleep in the car. I’m able to recline the seat just enough so that she doesn’t suffer from sleepy-bobble-head-syndrome. The high stance of the captain’s chairs makes it easy for my kids to see out the window.\n\nSpeaking of windows, the Infiniti QX56 4X4 has automatic up-and-down power windows. Although the recessed “pull up to close” switches follow NHTSA’s new safety guidelines for power windows, they are not equipped with pinch protection. This means that it’s still possible for a child (or adult for that matter) to get a head or limb accidentally closed in the window. According to NHTSA, an average of three fatalities every two years can be attributed to power windows. It seems to me that that’s three too many. Numerous cars offer power windows with pinch protection; this just isn’t one of them.\n\nFor a “luxury SUV” I’m surprised by how truck-y the QX56 feels. The engine makes a loud and hefty vroom noise (that must be the technical explanation for why it eats so much gas). It also has its fair share of tilt and sway around corners, which makes me wonder about its rollover resistance (not yet rated by the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration).\n\nThe 2004 Infiniti QX56 4X4 lives up to part of its claim as being “Luxury on a Grand Scale.” The scale of this SUV certainly is grand (as in large), and it does offer plenty of standard luxury amenities. For those of you who really want to drive something big, go for it. For the rest of you, do a bit more research and you’ll discover numerous cars (most in the cross-over category) with similar features, similar seating configurations that are smaller in their overall package deliverance, and more judicious with their fuel consumption. After all, the last thing we want to do is wake up a sleeping baby (or husband) by stopping at the gas station.\n\n*For more information on the 2004 Infiniti QX56 4X4 and its safety features visit Cars.com.",

      "expert_review": "Despite the recent spike in gasoline prices (followed, thankfully, by a refreshing if perhaps not permanent decline), the full-size sport utility market is alive and well, and on track to rack up about 700,000 sales this year.\n\nThose of you looking for a vehicle in this class might want to check out the Infiniti QX56, one of the best on the market.\n\nEssentially an upscale version of the Nissan Armada, the QX56 and the Armada were introduced for 2004 along with Nissan’s first full-size pickup, the Titan. All three vehicles are built on the same architecture, and come from Nissan’s newest U.S. plant, which opened in May 2003 in Canton, Miss.\n\nThe QX56 replaced the midsize QX4 in the Infiniti lineup. That vehicle, an upscale clone of the previous-generation midsize Nissan Pathfinder, never quite caught on with consumers.\n\nAs for the QX56, it’s the only traditional truck-based sport utility in the lineup of Infiniti, the luxury brand of Japan’s Nissan. Nissan chose not to produce an Infiniti version of the redesigned Pathfinder that went on sale for 2005, probably because it already had the full-size QX56 and the car-based midsize crossover models, the FX35 and FX45, for Infiniti customers.\n\nCrossovers are the rage now, anyway, so Nissan apparently felt that the FX models would fill the gap left by the demise of the QX4, while the QX56 would appeal to consumers who still wanted a truck-based SUV capable of carrying up to eight passengers and pulling big horse trailers and such.\n\nWith the QX56, Infiniti entered a segment it hadn’t played in before, just as Nissan did with the introduction of the Armada. Maybe it came a bit late, as the market for traditional SUVs has cooled somewhat, thanks to a combination of higher fuel prices and the advent of the more-refined crossover vehicles.\n\nBut with the Armada and QX56, Nissan hopes to carve out a profitable share of the full-size luxury SUV market, where General Motors Corp. this year has increased its dominance to nearly 70 percent of sales from 60 percent last year. That has occurred mostly because of the introduction of the redesigned 2007 Chevrolet Tahoe/Suburban, GMC Yukon/Yukon XL, and Cadillac Escalade models earlier this year.\n\nAnd more competition is coming, with Ford about to roll out the next generation of its full-size Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator models this fall.\n\nStill, though, the QX56 is a credible entry in the big luxury SUV class. The QX56 also marked another milestone for the brand: It’s the first Infiniti product to be built in North America.\n\nOur test vehicle was the 2006 all-wheel-drive model, which carries a base price of $52,550 (plus $750 freight). With a few extras, ours topped out at $56,450 (including freight), which put it in the same category as the Navigator and Escalade, but about $11,000 less than the competing Lexus LX 470.\n\nThe QX56 gets part of its name from its 5.6-liter V-8 engine, and it is the fourth Infiniti model to carry a V-8 engine. The others are the Q45 and M45 sedans, and the FX45 crossover. Those three come with 4.5-liter V-8s, however; the QX56 is the only one to carry the bigger engine from the Titan pickup.\n\nThis engine is rated at 315 horsepower and 390 foot-pounds of torque, just as it is in the Titan (it’s the only engine offered in the Titan or the QX56). That’s plenty of power for this vehicle, and freeway merges — even on uphill on-ramps — were made with ease in our test vehicle.\n\nWhile this is a truck, the ride is the most carlike you’re likely to find in a vehicle with a truck-style body-on-steel-frame arrangement. It’s very quiet inside at highway speeds, as well.\n\nThe fulltime all-wheel drive system, which is about a $3,000 upgrade over the base rear-drive model, comes with a two-speed transfer case for low-range off-road operation — something you won’t find on the more-expensive LX 470 or even on the Escalade. Of course, most QX56 buyers aren’t planning to do much serious trail driving, but it’s nice to know that the vehicle has that capability.\n\nAs with the Escalade and Navigator, the QX56 has seating for up to eight people, or seven if the consumer chooses captain’s chairs for the second row. It has been designed with both great on- and off-road capabilities, with luxury trappings befitting a model in this class.\n\nUpgrades for the 2006 model year included a new 60/40 split third-row seat; a compact-disc player with MP3 playback capability; and heated power folding mirrors with auto dimming and integrated turn signals.\n\nOur test vehicle came with the seven-passenger seating, which included captain’s chairs for the first and second rows, with a removable center console between the middle-row seats. There is no extra charge for the middle-row captain’s chairs.\n\nThe QX56 has an independent rear suspension and five-speed automatic transmission. The suspension has an automatic-leveling feature, which comes in handy with a heavy trailer attached. Towing capacity is 8,900 pounds, and there is nothing extra to buy. The large rear bumper comes with built-in towing hardware, an important feature in this class. People love to tow boats, horse trailers and RVs with vehicles such as this.\n\nExterior features include a large hood, Infiniti-style chrome “waterfall” grille, and barrel-shaped sides. Some design cues were carried over from the QX4, including jewel-like xenon headlights low in the fenders, combined with halogen fog lamps. Also included are seven-spoke, 18-inch chromed aluminum-alloy wheels, as well as chrome wheel lip moldings.\n\nInfiniti-style LED tail and brake lights are included, along with a power-operated liftgate with separately opening rear glass. The power liftgate is one of my favorite features of the QX56. It can be opened by a button on the remote control or on the left side of the dash, and can be closed by those buttons or another one located just inside the liftgate at the top left.\n\nThis system, which is now showing up on other big SUVs as well, is a convenient way to open the liftgate with your hands full of packages, and it also negates the need to pull down the heavy gate by hand to close it. High-tech gadgetry includes a back-up obstacle warning system in the rear bumper, as well as a rearview monitoring system, which includes a camera built into the rear license-plate holder to give the driver a video view to the rear of the vehicle. The view is projected onto the seven-inch LCD TV screen of the navigation system in the center of the dash.\n\nLuxury features abound inside, including leather seating surfaces, carpeting, and dark or blonde wood trim on the center console cover and steering wheel, with aluminum accents on the steering wheel trim and instrument panel.\n\nThe third-row seat is designed to be comfortable for adults, not just kids, and it is elevated to give occupants a good forward view. It can easily be folded to increase cargo space — as can the second-row seats.\n\nOther standard amenities include dual-zone automatic climate control, a Bose audio system with 10 speakers and six-disc CD changer, and steering-wheel-mounted audio controls. A feature pioneered by Ford is catching on in other models, including the new QX56 — adjustable brake and accelerator pedals.\n\nConvenience features include four 12-volt power outlets, rear air conditioning with dual controls, rear heater duct, driver and front passenger one-touch auto up/down power windows; rear auto-down power windows, 12 cupholders and bottle holders (some that can hold 64-ounce bottles), and a HomeLink universal garage/gate opener.\n\nExtras on our test vehicle included a power sliding sunroof ($1,200); an entertainment package ($1,600), which added a nifty DVD player; and XM satellite radio ($350).\n\nWe didn’t take our test vehicle off-road. But the all-wheel-drive system can be set for two-wheel drive, automatic four-wheel-drive or full-time four-wheel drive by a switch on the dash.\n\nFuel economy, though, is about what one would expect for a big vehicle such as this: 13 miles per gallon in the city and 18 mpg on the highway for the all-wheel drive model.\n\nG.

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in September 2008 about the 2008 Infiniti QX56. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2009, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nIf you’re reading this review, you obviously aren’t one of the many shoppers today who’ve shied away from full-size SUVs at the thought of $100 fill-ups. If you’re still in the market, the QX56 received a mild update for 2008 that includes subtle changes on the outside, a restyled interior and new features. The changes to the cabin enhance the SUV’s aesthetic appeal, but it’s still not as luxurious as some of its competitors — like the Cadillac Escalade — and the driving experience, though mostly good for a full-size SUV, still has some unappealing attributes.\n\nBig-Box Looks\nEven though the QX56 has a boxy look overall, Infiniti has given it some interesting design cues. It features an arcing doorline that gives the rear door a sail-like shape, and the rear doors have vertical door handles. Parent-company Nissan uses that design on all its truck-based SUVs, including the Xterra and Armada, the latter of which shares its platform with the QX56. The liftgate features a blister-style design, and the large chrome grille has been slightly restyled for 2008 (see a side-by-side comparison with the 2007 model).\n\nThe availability of big wheels on full-size SUVs is fairly common, and Infiniti has made 20-inch chrome ones standard on the QX56. Even though 20 inches is large, they don’t look excessively big on the substantial QX56, which is 17.25 feet long, about 6.5 feet wide and nearly 6.5 feet tall. You might want to measure your garage before buying one.\n\nRide & Handling\nThe QX56 is maneuverable for a full-size body-on-frame SUV. It can navigate parking lots with ease, and the optional front parking sensors make it simple to pull all the way into a parking space without having to worry about scuffing your bumper or crumpling another car.\n\nWhether driving around town or on the highway, the QX56 offers precise steering that makes navigating busy urban roads second nature. There’s a fair degree of weight to the steering wheel, which you notice when you’re constantly turning it, like when going up or down a parking deck.\n\nRide quality and general stability are other pluses of the QX56; there’s very little of the pitching, rolling and general wallowing that’s associated with full-size SUVs. Even though you’re aware of this SUV’s substantial size when cornering, the four-wheel independent suspension manages to keep the QX56 from excessively leaning over. The suspension also does a nice job of preventing the body from bouncing up and down excessively on undulating roads.\n\nWhat’s less appealing about the QX56 is that its cabin is highly susceptible to shudder on rough roads; impacts from bumps can make it up through the suspension and shake the body structure. Rough roads also make the steering wheel shake, so you’ll feel it in your hands, too. While this may lead to squeaks and rattles in the cabin down the road, the bigger issue is one of perception: Cabin shakes don’t reinforce the idea of luxury.\n\nThat said, the cabin is fairly quiet when cruising on smooth highways, and even though it’s bigger than a Cadillac Escalade on the outside, the QX56 feels more controllable from the driver’s seat and is easier to drive overall. You don’t have to worry as much about where the corners of this SUV are.\n\nGoing & Stopping\nThe QX56’s drivetrain is another one of its pluses. The 5.6-liter V-8, which makes 320 horsepower and 393 pounds-feet of torque, provides assertive acceleration in city driving if you exercise the gas pedal, and it makes a nice roar when you do so. The V-8 teams with a smooth-shifting five-speed automatic transmission that’s well-matched to the engine. The only situation where the engine starts to feel a little weak is when accelerating hard from 60 mph or so.\n\nYou pay for this V-8 power with gas mileage that’s in the teens; rear-wheel-drive models get an EPA-estimated 12/18 mpg city/highway, while the four-wheel-drive QX56 is rated at 12/17 mpg. These estimates are, however, in line with what the competition achieves.\n\nGas Mileage Compared (city/highway, mpg)\n\t2WD\t4WD\n2009 Mercedes-Benz GL450\t—\t13/18\n2008 Toyota Land Cruiser\t—\t13/18\n2009 Cadillac Escalade\t12/19\t12/18\n2008 Infiniti QX56\t12/18\t12/17\n2008 Lincoln Navigator\t12/18\t—\n\nBrake-pedal feel, on the other hand, is disappointing. When trying to bring the QX56 to a halt, you have to keep pressing harder and harder to get the level of desired response from the brakes. This gives the impression that the brakes aren’t up to the task of slowing the QX56 quickly (even though they are), which isn’t a feeling you want to have when piloting a big SUV. This is the kind of thing an owner would get used to over time, but it’s disconcerting nonetheless.\n\nCabin Styling & Comfort\nThe big change for 2008 is a restyled interior that increases the sense of luxury in the QX56, but it still doesn’t match the Escalade’s ambience. Part of the reason for this was my test car’s interior color scheme, which was dominated by drab shades of gray trim highlighted by real wood and aluminum here and there. Wheat (tan) and Charcoal (black) interiors are also offered, and they might offer a more inviting experience. Even though the cabin materials are nice, like the standard leather upholstery, they’re not exceptional, which you might expect them to be considering the QX56 starts at more than $50,000.\n\nThe standard second-row configuration features two captain’s chairs with a center storage console between them. A three-person bench, which increases the QX56’s seating capacity from seven to eight, is a no-charge option. There’s plenty of legroom for tall riders here. The bucket seats are large and comfortable, and they recline with the lift of a lever near the back of the seat cushion. The captain’s chairs don’t slide forward or backward, though, which doesn’t let you proportion available legroom between the second row, where there is a lot, and the third row, which doesn’t have much. Folding the captain’s chairs flat requires that you flip the seat cushion forward before folding down the backrest.\n\nAt 6-foot-1 I was able to squeeze myself into the third row, but when seated my head was touching the ceiling and my legs didn’t have much room to move around. While it’s better than what you’ll get in the Escalade’s third row, it can’t match the Lincoln Navigator’s, which is one of the best among full-size SUVs. The second-row captain’s chairs flip forward to aid third-row entry and exit.\n\nThe QX56 does give you a lot of standard power features for your money. There are power-adjustable pedals, a power tilting steering wheel, power-folding side mirrors, a power liftgate and a new power third-row seat.\n\nCargo & Towing\nThe QX56 offers 61.2 cubic feet of cargo room when the third row is folded flat into the floor, which is more than similarly configured Navigators (54.5 cubic feet) and Escalades (60.3 cubic feet) offer. When the third row is in use, however, cargo volume dips to 20 cubic feet, which isn’t a lot of space if all the seats are filled and you need to bring a few days’ worth of luggage for everyone. The Escalade and Navigator don’t fare any better, offering just 16.9 and 18.2 cubic feet, respectively. The QX56 rides fairly high off the ground, which means you have to clear a tall bumper when loading luggage.\n\nOne of the reasons for buying a full-size SUV like the QX56 is that it can tow a boat or camper and carry the family — all at the same time. The rear-wheel-drive QX56 offers a 9,000-pound towing capacity when properly equipped. Choosing a four-wheel-drive QX56 drops the rating to 8,900 pounds.\n\nSafety\nStandard features include all-disc antilock brakes, side-impact airbags for the front seats, side curtain airbags for all three rows of seats and an electronic stability system, which is an especially important safety feature in a large SUV.\n\nIn the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s frontal crash test, the QX56 received five stars for its protection of the driver and four for the front passenger.\n\nQX56 in the Market\nThere’s no question that demand for full-size SUVs has cooled in recent months as shoppers have become more concerned with fuel economy. However, even if the average price for a gallon of gas were to eclipse the all-time high of $4.11 that was reached this past summer, there would still be shoppers considering vehicles like the QX56. Why? Because they want the space, power and capability it affords that an efficient small car doesn’t.\n\nBut will those shoppers look at the QX56? It’s going to come down to what they value the most. If you’re looking for the most luxury, an Escalade ranks higher, but if driving ease and maneuverability are more important, the QX56 is an appealing choice.\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "The 2012 Infiniti QX56 pulled off a nearly impossible feat during a family drive to the Rocky Mountains: My husband and I had a rare adult conversation in the first row while our three children were in the SUV. This happened because our little ones were cozily nestled in the second and third rows and engrossed in a movie playing on the two head-restraint-mounted entertainment screens.\n\nThe 2012 QX56 offers a wealth of luxurious amenities and can satisfy almost all of your cravings in the car; I say almost because there is a dearth of cargo space behind the third row and its fuel economy is pretty dismal.\n\nThe low fuel-economy numbers — an EPA-estimated 14/20 mpg city/highway — are courtesy of the QX’s 400-horsepower V-8 engine. Of course, with that kind of power the QX swiftly climbed the nearly 11,000 feet to the top of Vail pass, and it wasn’t even panting. It accelerates smoothly, never hesitates and propels you along in placid comfort — no matter how fast you’re going. This three-row SUV is surprisingly agile given its size and makes driving a quiet, smooth and low-stress experience.\n\nThe QX56 was completely redesigned for the 2011 model year. New additions for 2012 are minor and pertain mainly to option packages. Blind spot warning and lane departure warning systems are now part of the available Technology Package ($3,000); a Bose surround-sound audio system with 15 speakers is available in the Deluxe Touring Package ($4,500); and the Theater Package now includes heated second-row seats with a remote tip-up feature ($2,950).\n\nThe 2012 QX56 has a starting price of $60,190 (including a $990 destination charge). With the addition of the available Theater, Deluxe Touring, Technology and Tire and Wheel packages, the grand total of my test car was $75,340.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe QX56 elicited lots of comments from people about its humongous size. It is enormous but fit in my garage without a problem. At 208.3 inches long and 79.9 inches wide, it made the Ford Escape in my garage look like a real imp as it was more than two feet shorter than the QX.\n\nA chrome grille dominates the QX’s front. This deliberate statement of largesse and luxury certainly makes people take notice. The step-in height is tough for shorter legs and tighter skirts, though the presence of standard running boards offers a bit of help. A power liftgate, power moonroof, xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights, rain-sensing wipers and power-folding heated side mirrors are all standard.\n\nCargo space becomes disappointing with the third-row seats in use. Cargo volume behind the third row is a paltry 16.6 cubic feet. Compared to the more than 30 cubic feet that most minivans have behind the third row, 16.6 cubic feet is embarrassing. When the power-folding third-row seats are folded, the cargo space opens up to almost 50 cubic feet, which is respectable but something I couldn’t regularly experience since I needed to use the third-row bench for one of my three kids. What I did get to experience is trying to stuff a whole lot of stuff into a little space for a weekend trip to the mountains.\n\nThe standard 5.6-liter V-8 engine that produces 400 hp is impressive. My test car had optional four-wheel drive with Infiniti’s All-Mode electronically controlled transfer case. A knob between the front seats puts the car into Snow or Tow modes with a simple turn. Rear-wheel drive is standard. Premium fuel is recommended for both the all- and rear-wheel-drive QX. I averaged about 15 mpg during my test drive, and when it came time to fill up the QX56, my bill was nearly $100.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nINTERIOR\nThe 2012 QX56 has a cabin that puts some chic hotels to shame. It’s all polished wood and leather detail with no surface untouched by something that shimmers, shines or feels soft on your skin. The leather and wood trim are standard and gorgeous. Seating is comfortable, enabling anyone to sit anywhere in this car for hours.\n\nA heated steering wheel, heated front seats, power-folding third-row seats and trizone automatic climate control are standard. My test car came with standard second-row captain’s chairs, creating seating for seven. The captain’s chairs easily tip forward (when child-safety seats aren’t installed) with the touch of a lever to ensure easy entry to the third row. Eight-person seating is available with a second-row bench seat.\n\nInfiniti has managed to make road noise disappear from the QX56’s cabin, which would make driving incredibly peaceful were it not for those three wee ones I tote around with me. As for storage in the cabin, there are nine cupholders and four in-door bottleholders, and both the front- and second-row center consoles are enormous, which means lots of space for books, snacks, diapers and your laptop. My test car came with the Deluxe Touring Package that adds heated and cooled front seats, an upgraded 15-speaker Bose audio system and lovely lighting at the base of the second row. The test car was also equipped with the Theater Package that includes dual 7-inch entertainment screens that can play material from different video sources.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSAFETY\nInstalling a child-safety seat into the QX56’s second row is a breeze thanks to the lower Latch anchors that are easily accessible through large slits in seat upholstery. I wish Infiniti would include a third set of Latch anchors in the third row. I’m constantly surprised at how many of these huge cars with third rows don’t have a third set of Latch anchors. I installed a forward-facing convertible in the third row using a seat belt and the tether anchor that was at the rear of the cargo area. Find out how the 2012 QX56 performed in Cars.com’s Car Seat Check here.\n\nThe 2012 QX56 has standard rear-wheel drive, four-wheel-disc antilock brakes with brake assist, an electronic stability system with traction control, active head restraints in the front row and six airbags, including side curtains for all three rows.\n\nThe QX56 also comes standard with Infiniti’s Around View Monitor camera system that uses four cameras mounted around the SUV to let you know if anything is in your way when parking or maneuvering. You can view the camera images on the 8-inch navigation screen, and front and rear parking sensors also let you know when the QX is too close to something.\n\nMy test car was equipped with the Technology Package ($3,000), which is full of safety extras such as a blind spot warning system, lane departure warning system, Distance Control Assist, forward collision warning and adaptive front headlights. All-wheel drive also is optional.\n\nThe 2012 QX56 hasn’t been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the federal government.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2012 Infiniti QX56 here.",

      "expert_review": "Whenever I said anything good about the 2011 Infiniti QX56 to curious onlookers, their universal comeback was, “But it’s so ugly.”\n\nThe 2011 Infiniti QX56’s luxurious interior, composed ride quality, and capability for the money make it a serious competitor among $60,000-plus SUVs … if you can accept its controversial styling.\n\nFrom chassis to roof, the 2011 QX56 is significantly different from the 2010. For a comparison with the 2010, see here. Base 2011 models have rear-wheel drive, and the QX56 I tested had all-wheel drive and a bunch of other options that pushed the price just past $75,000; all versions have a 400-horsepower V-8 and seven-speed automatic transmission.\n\nInterior\nNothing inside the QX gives the impression that underneath lies a trucklike chassis capable of towing 8,500 pounds. Rich materials fill the cabin, which is laid out with classiness befitting an Infiniti sedan. The steering wheel, dashboard and center console integrate burl wood trim that wouldn’t look out of place if morphed into a living room coffee table.\n\nSpending $70,000 is no guarantee of getting a luxurious-feeling SUV. The 2010 Audi Q7 we tested had off-putting plastic pieces and a cheap-looking steering wheel that made the SUV feel cheaper than its $76,000 price tag.\n\nThe QX has room for seven occupants with the standard captain’s chairs, or eight with a Split Bench Seat Package for the second row, which is a no-cost option. The standard second-row captain’s chairs feel nearly as comfortable as the driver’s throne. Even after multiple trips in the second row, I never came to think of it as a demotion; it was more of a chauffeured experience.\n\nWhat’s inconvenient is getting in and out of the high-riding QX, which requires using the standard running boards. One of my shorter passengers had a tough time pulling herself into the passenger seat, literally having to pull herself in using the provided grab handle on the passenger-side A-pillar.\n\nExcept for the height obstacle, the three-passenger third row is one of the easiest to access in any SUV I’ve tested. With one effortless motion, the second row captain’s chairs tumble forward and out of the way. Once seated, I had good headroom and legroom considering my 6-foot-tall, slender build — and the fact that it’s a third-row space. It was considerably more comfortable than the Q7’s tiny two-passenger third row.\n\nOverall, the Q7 is very small on the inside for how big it is on the outside. Conversely, the QX56 feels just as big on the inside as its gargantuan exterior advertises, with 152 cubic feet of passenger volume; the Q7 has 133 cubic feet.\n\nExterior\nMany people have openly expressed disgust with the QX’s looks. I wouldn’t call it 100 percent ugly, but 60 percent ugly sounds about right. Its proportions don’t help. To my eye, its beluga-whale hood bulge and low-positioned headlights don’t mix well with its tall, squared-off roof. It’s like a G37 sedan drove into a giant top hat and Infiniti said, yeah, let’s run with that.\n\nI drove two QXs before the styling started to grow on me, which was also after I had seen it on the road a few times. I still wouldn’t call it handsome, like the Audi Q7, but the Q7’s awesomely sleek exterior comes at the cost of interior room.\n\nPerformance\nFor a massive SUV, the QX56 is a surprising performer. The 5.6-liter V-8 makes 400 horsepower and 413 pounds-feet of torque. Combined with a seven-speed automatic transmission, the QX accelerates as briskly as a sport sedan of a decade ago. Our friends at “MotorWeek” tested the QX’s zero to 60 mph acceleration at 6.3 seconds and its quarter-mile at 14.9 seconds. Those are entirely respectable numbers for a 5,800-pound SUV.\n\nThe QX56’s EPA-estimated mileage is expectedly low, at 14/20 mpg city/highway with rear- or all-wheel drive, but that is an improvement over the 2010 QX’s 12/18 mpg with rear-wheel drive and 12/17 mpg with all-wheel drive. I averaged around 15 mpg during testing that accumulated 1,000-plus miles traveling between Illinois and Michigan. These weren’t only highway miles, as we also used the QX as a chase car to haul video equipment and crew.\n\nDespite being built on truck architecture, the QX’s ride isn’t trucklike at all. It rides smoothly and confidently, even on the massive 22-inch wheels that are part of an optional Deluxe Package. I would even call the QX fun to drive, especially considering the redesigned Lexus GX 460 rolls into corners like a boat, nosedives during braking and squats on acceleration.\n\nOne option that may have helped the QX feel so composed was its Hydraulic Body Motion Control, also part of the Deluxe Package. The system’s shock absorbers transfer fluid from one side’s shock to the other during cornering to combat body roll.\n\nFeatures\nFor $2,850, the Technology Package makes the QX as idiot-proof as possible. Thanks to the features in that package, combined with Infiniti’s standard Around View Monitor, which provides a top-down view of the SUV, I always knew what was happening around the QX. The tech package adds adaptive cruise control, a blind spot warning system, a lane departure warning system, brake assist and an adaptive front lighting system. In a vehicle this size, every assist helps.\n\nStandard equipment includes heated seats, a heated steering wheel, burl wood highlights, front and rear climate controls, a moonroof, a Bose stereo and a navigation system.\n\nCargo & Towing\nDespite a high load-in height and a protruding bumper you’ll have to lift items over, the cargo opening isn’t as bad as it could be. Other big luxury SUVs, like the Lexus LX 570 and some Land Rovers, use a clamshell-type cargo gate. That means there’s a bottom segment that folds down like a tailgate, leaving an extra obstacle between you and the cargo floor. The QX uses a power liftgate that opens upward and closes with the touch of a button.\n\nFor the towing crowd, the QX’s maximum towing capacity is 8,500 pounds with both front- and all-wheel drive. A class IV trailer hitch and seven-pin wiring harness come standard, and a bumper fill plate hides the hitch’s opening when you’re not towing. The Q7 can tow a maximum of 6,600 pounds, and the GX 460 can tow 6,500 pounds. The more-expensive Lexus LX 570 starts at $79,455 and is rated to tow 7,000 pounds.\n\nSafety\nAs of this writing, the 2011 QX56 hasn’t been crash-tested.\n\nStandard safety features include front and side-impact airbags, side-curtain airbags for all three rows, an electronic stability system and active front head restraints. For a full list of safety features, see here.\n\nQX56 in the Market\nThe QX56’s do-it-all appeal is enough to make me look past its styling. Its people- and cargo-carrying abilities, its degree of luxury and its towing capacity are impressive.\n\nDespite the overly negative reactions I received about the QX56’s appearance, Infiniti’s highest-priced SUV outsold the automaker’s less-expensive and more stylish EX and FX SUVs from March through May 2011. In fact, during that time period, the QX was outpaced only by the G series, which includes a sedan, coupe and convertible.\n\nFor those who find the inside of the QX56 appealing enough to settle for the exterior styling, try these techniques: park it in the back lot behind a tree, resist the over-the-shoulder glance while walking away and just walk backward when returning. It’s that easy.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in January 2012 about the 2012 Infiniti QX56. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2013, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThere aren’t many big SUVs I would want to drive daily, but a week with my family in the 2012 Infiniti QX56 might have changed my mind.\n\nI can definitively say that I would like to ride around in it as a passenger every day; seating seven or eight people, it’s cush and totally luxurious. As it should be: Padded with plenty of extras, my four-wheel-drive test vehicle came priced at an exorbitant $75,340. I may very well have to choose between this opulent, luxurious SUV and sending my kids to college. College is overrated, don’t you think? My zoology degree is doing nothing for me. (Compare the four-wheel-drive version to the slightly less expensive two-wheel-drive version here.)\n\nThe QX56 manages to quell the myth that all SUVs are trucky and rugged. Instead, this beauty seeps comfort and luxury from every pore. Its private-jet-inspired interior is draped in gently gathered, buttery-soft leather, with all the extras that even the prissiest prima donnas among us would love. My favorites? Heated and cooled front seats, heated second-row seats for my prissy biological offspring (I say that lovingly), and a heated steering wheel that’s just as comforting as warming my hands on a cup of cocoa.\n\nLittle has changed between the 2011 and 2012 QX; see the two compared here.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe QX looks a little like a guy I saw at the airport the other day who was trying to squeeze in a few too many trends. (Really? Black, skinny emo jeans, a handlebar mustache and a Mohawk? Choose one trend and rock it.) The QX has just a little too much going on for my taste. I’d take away those blingy chrome gills on the front fenders to clean it up a little.\n\nThe QX is a huge SUV (6.3 inches longer than a 2012 GMC Yukon Denali), but you don’t really notice its full size until you try to park it in a garage space normally reserved for your small family sedan. Despite its grandiose size, the QX is remarkably easy to maneuver through your daily driving life thanks to its standard 360-degree Around View Monitor and a front and rear sonar system. In a vehicle this size, you’re normally left blindly creeping forward in a parking space or garage until you oh so gently bump into something, letting you know you’ve pulled all the way forward. (The kids won’t notice that little dent in their plastic wagon, right?) In the QX56, you can switch on a front-view camera that shows you just how close you are to the object in front of you, a side-view camera showing you the side of the car and the curb as you’re trying to parallel park, or a 360-degree view showing you a picture as if from above the car. Audio park assist adds to the ease when parking.\n\nOf course, the QX’s large size does come with some downfalls. Mainly, getting in and out of this vehicle can be challenging for those of us under 6 feet tall. Despite the standard running boards, my daughter managed to get a huge, filthy smudge on her “fancy” dress and white tights while getting into the QX56 on the way to her piano recital. Of course, the dirt, ice and sludge that build up on the underside of cars in the Denver area in the winter doesn’t help this situation at all.\n\nFAMILY-FRIENDLY FEATURES\nWhile the wide, flat seats in the QX56 are awesome for installing an array of odd-sized child-safety seats, they’re not awesome for holding smaller drivers and passengers in place during the slight body roll that happens in such a large SUV. I didn’t like sliding from one side of my seat to the other and then back again around every curve. As it turns out, bolstered seats have a purpose besides looking sporty.\n\nIn a market full of hard-to-access third rows, the QX56 excels. The second row captain’s chairs fold and tumble easily using either a hand lever on the seat itself or, better yet, a button on the dashboard. This is great news. Now, trying to load kids while being pressured to get through the carpool lane quickly, I can press this button to tumble the second row forward from the comfort of my heated driver’s seat so all the kids can climb into the “way back.” The kids who are climbing into the second row can then easily press the captain’s chair back into place and climb in. And when I say “easily,” I mean it. Even my 7-year-old stepdaughter can do it by herself.\n\nTo go from hauling kids to hauling stuff and back again, the power-operated split third row folds flat via a button in the cargo area. Ahh — no seats to remove, no seats to fight with, no numbered tabs to pull. (Step 1: pull this. Step 2: fold that. Step 3: give up.) Just easy, simple seats that fold. Ingenious.\n\nWhat’s not so ingenious is the odd placement of the side mirror adjustment lever: below the dash in front of the driver’s left knee. Unless you’re completely disproportionate, a driver of any size would have to bend forward and down to adjust the side mirror, guessing for proper placement, then sit back in the seat and hope they got it right. Nope? Try again.\n\nLegroom in the second row is expansive while leaving enough legroom in the third row to accommodate kids of all sizes, or even average-sized adults. There are nine cupholders and four bottleholders scattered throughout all three rows, ensuring that every passenger can have his or her coffee and drink it, too.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Excellent\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nBEHIND THE WHEEL\nWhile some may enjoy the perception of safety they feel when driving a large SUV that can plow over anything and everything it may encounter, I found the QX56 to have some disconnection from the road. Its driving quality was refined, but the ride felt floaty. I had to simply trust that it was doing what it was supposed to while driving over icy roads; I was so far away from having any direct road feedback.\n\nAcceleration in the QX, which sports a 5.6-liter V-8 engine with 400 horsepower, is light and easy, but moving such a behemoth that quickly comes at a cost. In this case, it’s fuel consumption: The QX56 gets an EPA-estimated 14/20 mpg city/highway with either rear- or four-wheel drive. Ouch.\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2012 Infiniti QX56 hasn’t been crash-tested. (Full-size SUVs seldom are.) It features driver and passenger front airbags and seat-mounted side-impact airbags, as well as standard side curtain airbags for all three rows of passengers. As required of all 2012 and later models, the QX includes antilock brakes, traction control and an electronic stability system. Hill start assist is also standard.\n\nThe lower anchor Latch points in the second row captain’s chairs are nicely stowed in the seat bight and accessible via a slit in the seat bottom. The flat seat bottoms and wide, reclining captain’s chairs make it easy to fit a child-safety seat of any shape or size. This feature is also helpful for accommodating booster seats of any width, with enough leftover space for kids to reach down and access their own seat belt buckle. For kids in booster seats, the seat belt buckle receptors are on stable bases, making it very easy for them to buckle up independently in the second row.\n\nThe third-row seats have flimsy seat belt buckles on nylon bases requiring much more advanced dexterity to buckle up. The seat belts also have highly sensitive automatic locking retractors, causing my girls (ages 7, 9 and 11) to “lock” their belts almost every time while buckling up in the third row. While the older two understood how to let the seat belt retract all the way back in before trying to pull it out more slowly, this concept was lost on my youngest. On more than one occasion, I had to climb into the third row through the cargo area to help out. I’d reserve these seats for the “big kids” in the family.\n\nClick here for more standard safety information on the 2012 Infiniti QX.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "If you’re reading this review, you obviously aren’t one of the many shoppers today who’ve shied away from full-size SUVs at the thought of $100 fill-ups. If you’re still in the market, the QX56 received a mild update for 2008 that includes subtle changes on the outside, a restyled interior and new features. The changes to the cabin enhance the SUV’s aesthetic appeal, but it’s still not as luxurious as some of its competitors — like the Cadillac Escalade — and the driving experience, though mostly good for a full-size SUV, still has some unappealing attributes.\n\nBig-Box Looks\nEven though the QX56 has a boxy look overall, Infiniti has given it some interesting design cues. It features an arcing doorline that gives the rear door a sail-like shape, and the rear doors have vertical door handles. Parent-company Nissan uses that design on all its truck-based SUVs, including the Xterra and Armada, the latter of which shares its platform with the QX56. The liftgate features a blister-style design, and the large chrome grille has been slightly restyled for 2008 (see a side-by-side comparison with the 2007 model).\n\nThe availability of big wheels on full-size SUVs is fairly common, and Infiniti has made 20-inch chrome ones standard on the QX56. Even though 20 inches is large, they don’t look excessively big on the substantial QX56, which is 17.25 feet long, about 6.5 feet wide and nearly 6.5 feet tall. You might want to measure your garage before buying one.\n\nRide & Handling\nThe QX56 is maneuverable for a full-size body-on-frame SUV. It can navigate parking lots with ease, and the optional front parking sensors make it simple to pull all the way into a parking space without having to worry about scuffing your bumper or crumpling another car.\n\nWhether driving around town or on the highway, the QX56 offers precise steering that makes navigating busy urban roads second nature. There’s a fair degree of weight to the steering wheel, which you notice when you’re constantly turning it, like when going up or down a parking deck.\n\nRide quality and general stability are other pluses of the QX56; there’s very little of the pitching, rolling and general wallowing that’s associated with full-size SUVs. Even though you’re aware of this SUV’s substantial size when cornering, the four-wheel independent suspension manages to keep the QX56 from excessively leaning over. The suspension also does a nice job of preventing the body from bouncing up and down excessively on undulating roads.\n\nWhat’s less appealing about the QX56 is that its cabin is highly susceptible to shudder on rough roads; impacts from bumps can make it up through the suspension and shake the body structure. Rough roads also make the steering wheel shake, so you’ll feel it in your hands, too. While this may lead to squeaks and rattles in the cabin down the road, the bigger issue is one of perception: Cabin shakes don’t reinforce the idea of luxury.\n\nThat said, the cabin is fairly quiet when cruising on smooth highways, and even though it’s bigger than a Cadillac Escalade on the outside, the QX56 feels more controllable from the driver’s seat and is easier to drive overall. You don’t have to worry as much about where the corners of this SUV are.\n\nGoing & Stopping\nThe QX56’s drivetrain is another one of its pluses. The 5.6-liter V-8, which makes 320 horsepower and 393 pounds-feet of torque, provides assertive acceleration in city driving if you exercise the gas pedal, and it makes a nice roar when you do so. The V-8 teams with a smooth-shifting five-speed automatic transmission that’s well-matched to the engine. The only situation where the engine starts to feel a little weak is when accelerating hard from 60 mph or so.\n\nYou pay for this V-8 power with gas mileage that’s in the teens; rear-wheel-drive models get an EPA-estimated 12/18 mpg city/highway, while the four-wheel-drive QX56 is rated at 12/17 mpg. These estimates are, however, in line with what the competition achieves.\n\nGas Mileage Compared (city/highway, mpg)\n\t2WD\t4WD\n2009 Mercedes-Benz GL450\t—\t13/18\n2008 Toyota Land Cruiser\t—\t13/18\n2009 Cadillac Escalade\t12/19\t12/18\n2008 Infiniti QX56\t12/18\t12/17\n2008 Lincoln Navigator\t12/18\t—\n\nBrake-pedal feel, on the other hand, is disappointing. When trying to bring the QX56 to a halt, you have to keep pressing harder and harder to get the level of desired response from the brakes. This gives the impression that the brakes aren’t up to the task of slowing the QX56 quickly (even though they are), which isn’t a feeling you want to have when piloting a big SUV. This is the kind of thing an owner would get used to over time, but it’s disconcerting nonetheless.\n\nCabin Styling & Comfort\nThe big change for 2008 is a restyled interior that increases the sense of luxury in the QX56, but it still doesn’t match the Escalade’s ambience. Part of the reason for this was my test car’s interior color scheme, which was dominated by drab shades of gray trim highlighted by real wood and aluminum here and there. Wheat (tan) and Charcoal (black) interiors are also offered, and they might offer a more inviting experience. Even though the cabin materials are nice, like the standard leather upholstery, they’re not exceptional, which you might expect them to be considering the QX56 starts at more than $50,000.\n\nThe standard second-row configuration features two captain’s chairs with a center storage console between them. A three-person bench, which increases the QX56’s seating capacity from seven to eight, is a no-charge option. There’s plenty of legroom for tall riders here. The bucket seats are large and comfortable, and they recline with the lift of a lever near the back of the seat cushion. The captain’s chairs don’t slide forward or backward, though, which doesn’t let you proportion available legroom between the second row, where there is a lot, and the third row, which doesn’t have much. Folding the captain’s chairs flat requires that you flip the seat cushion forward before folding down the backrest.\n\nAt 6-foot-1 I was able to squeeze myself into the third row, but when seated my head was touching the ceiling and my legs didn’t have much room to move around. While it’s better than what you’ll get in the Escalade’s third row, it can’t match the Lincoln Navigator’s, which is one of the best among full-size SUVs. The second-row captain’s chairs flip forward to aid third-row entry and exit.\n\nThe QX56 does give you a lot of standard power features for your money. There are power-adjustable pedals, a power tilting steering wheel, power-folding side mirrors, a power liftgate and a new power third-row seat.\n\nCargo & Towing\nThe QX56 offers 61.2 cubic feet of cargo room when the third row is folded flat into the floor, which is more than similarly configured Navigators (54.5 cubic feet) and Escalades (60.3 cubic feet) offer. When the third row is in use, however, cargo volume dips to 20 cubic feet, which isn’t a lot of space if all the seats are filled and you need to bring a few days’ worth of luggage for everyone. The Escalade and Navigator don’t fare any better, offering just 16.9 and 18.2 cubic feet, respectively. The QX56 rides fairly high off the ground, which means you have to clear a tall bumper when loading luggage.\n\nOne of the reasons for buying a full-size SUV like the QX56 is that it can tow a boat or camper and carry the family — all at the same time. The rear-wheel-drive QX56 offers a 9,000-pound towing capacity when properly equipped. Choosing a four-wheel-drive QX56 drops the rating to 8,900 pounds.\n\nSafety\nStandard features include all-disc antilock brakes, side-impact airbags for the front seats, side curtain airbags for all three rows of seats and an electronic stability system, which is an especially important safety feature in a large SUV.\n\nIn the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s frontal crash test, the QX56 received five stars for its protection of the driver and four for the front passenger.\n\nQX56 in the Market\nThere’s no question that demand for full-size SUVs has cooled in recent months as shoppers have become more concerned with fuel economy. However, even if the average price for a gallon of gas were to eclipse the all-time high of $4.11 that was reached this past summer, there would still be shoppers considering vehicles like the QX56. Why? Because they want the space, power and capability it affords that an efficient small car doesn’t.\n\nBut will those shoppers look at the QX56? It’s going to come down to what they value the most. If you’re looking for the most luxury, an Escalade ranks higher, but if driving ease and maneuverability are more important, the QX56 is an appealing choice.\n\nSend Mike an email",
