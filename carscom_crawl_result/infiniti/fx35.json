      "expert_review": "The second generation of Infiniti’s FX premium crossover utility vehicle arrived for 2009, with more power, more high-tech features and a bolder new design.\n\nIt made its debut at last March’s Geneva Motor Show in the form of the V-8 version, renamed the FX50 from the previous model’s FX45.\n\nAt the New York auto show a few weeks later, the redesigned FX35, the V-6 model, was unveiled.\n\nWith these vehicles, the number that follows “FX” refers to that model’s engine size – the FX50 has a 5.0-liter V-8, while the FX35 comes with a 3.5-liter V-6.\n\nThree versions are offered: the FX35 with rear-wheel drive (base price $42,150 plus $815 freight); FX35 with all-wheel drive ($43,600); and the FX50 with all-wheel drive ($58,400). The FX50 does not come in a two-wheel-drive version.\n\nThe V-8 engine of the FX50 is rated at 390 horsepower and 369 foot-pounds of torque. That’s an increase of 70 horsepower from the 2008 FX45.\n\nFor the FX35, the V-6 engine produces 303 horsepower and 262 foot-pounds of torque. The 2008 model had 275 horsepower.\n\nAll models come with a new seven-speed automatic transmission. Optional are steering-wheel paddle shifters that allow for manual operation of the gears without having to worry about a clutch.\n\nThe FX is now the middle-size SUV in the lineup of Infiniti, which is Nissan’s premium brand. For 2008, Infiniti introduced the smaller EX35 crossover, and for the past six years, the company has sold the QX56, a traditional body-on-frame, full-size sport utility based on the chassis of the Nissan Titan pickup.\n\nInfiniti introduced the original FX for 2003. While the FX has an outward appearance similar to that of the Nissan Murano crossover, they are completely different vehicles.\n\nThe Murano, also introduced for 2003 and also redesigned for 2009, is built on the front-wheel-drive chassis of the Nissan Altima sedan.\n\nBut the FX rides on the rear-drive chassis of the Infiniti G37 sedan. The only Nissan-branded vehicle that uses that architecture is the rear-drive 370Z sports car (itself partially redesigned for 2009 and renamed; it was the 350Z last year).\n\nThe EX, which also is built on the G37 chassis, is aimed at women, while men are the target audience for the FX, Nissan said. Men made up about 65 percent of the buyers of the original FX, and that should continue with the new versions, the company added.\n\nNissan says FX buyers typically are in their early to mid-40s, married, with household incomes of about $150,000 for the base model and $300,000-plus for the V-8 version.\n\nThe original FX was intended to make a statement about design and performance, Nissan said, and the redesign continues that theme, but with a more-muscular body that gives the car a more-aggressive look to reflect the boost in power.\n\nIt’s still quite recognizable as an FX, however; the restyling didn’t change the basic shape, which is low, sleek and swept rather than boxy like a traditional SUV.\n\nThe V-6 engine has all the power anyone really needs, and it also offers the best fuel economy – 16 mpg city/23 highway with two-wheel drive, and 16/21 with all-wheel drive.\n\nWith the V-8, you get lots more power, of course, but the EPA ratings are just 14 city/20 highway. One advantage is that with the V8, the FX will tow a trailer weighing up to 3,500 pounds; the V-6 is limited to 2,000 pounds.\n\nNissan greatly improved the FX interior on these new models. The cabin envelops its occupants in luxury without being ostentatious. Leather seats are standard on all models.\n\nAs with the previous model, the new FX seats five people in two rows; no third row is offered. But it is roomier inside than the EX35. The rear seat can hold three adults comfortably, with plenty of legroom.\n\nThe intelligent all-wheel-drive system was not included on our FX35 tester, but it’s designed for all-weather driving and all road surfaces, wet or dry. It’s not intended for off-road use, however.\n\nThere are some cool new high-tech safety features available, including intelligent brake assist, which Nissan says provides “forward collision warning and automatic emergency braking.”\n\nA new FX feature that made its debut last year on the EX35 is the lane-departure warning and prevention system, designed to help keep the vehicle in its lane. When the system’s sensors detect the vehicle drifting out of its lane – by reading the lane markings on the road – the system gives audible beeps, then gently begins to move the vehicle back in line.\n\nThis feature was fun to play with, but the beeping actually became quite annoying after a while as I drove a few hours along an interstate highway. I ended up using the pushbutton switch on the dash to the left of the steering wheel to turn it off, but each time I got out of the car, then re-entered and started the engine again, it defaulted back to the “on” position.\n\nIt would be a good feature to have if you were prone to nodding off at the wheel, however.\n\nOur tester also was equipped with intelligent cruise control. This system includes distance-control assist, which Infiniti says “helps reduce the stress of driving in heavy traffic by intuitively helping to release the throttle and apply the brakes to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead.”\n\nHere again, some people will like this; some will turn it off. The problem I found is that it will pace you to the car ahead if that car is going slower than the speed you’ve set the cruise for, and unless you pay attention and move to the passing lane, you’ll be forever slowed down by the vehicle you’re following.\n\nThose features – lane-departure and intelligent cruise with distance-control assist – are part of the $2,900 Technology package, which also includes the intelligent brake assist and rain-sensing wipers.\n\nThe tester also came with the Navigation package ($2,850), which brought another cool safety feature – a rear back-up camera, as well as a bird’s-eye around-view monitor that displays on the dash-mounted navigation screen.\n\nWe also had the Premium package ($2,350), which tacked on front dual-reclining, heated/cooled bucket seats with height adjustment, two-position driver’s power memory and adjustable headrests; Bluetooth connectivity; auxiliary jack for an iPod that also charges the device’s battery; outside mirrors with driver’s side two-position memory and automatic tilt-down (a waste of money and a major nuisance on any car that has these); a power tilt/telescopic steering column with memory; the steering-wheel paddle shifters; alloy foot pedals; quilted leather seats; alloy roof cargo rails (100-pound capacity); and both a cargo net and cargo cover.\n\nStandard on the FX35 are 10-spoke alloy wheels; optional are 20-inch, five-spoke wheels. The FX50 comes with 21-inch wheels.\n\nTotal sticker for our FX35 two-wheel-drive test vehicle was $51,065, which included freight and $8,100 in options\n\nThe automotive columns of G. Chambers Williams III have appeared regularly in the Star-Telegram since 1995.

      "expert_review": "Just because a car is sporty doesn’t mean it’s a sports car. Similarly, when automakers claim their crossover has a sports-car driving experience, it usually doesn’t mean it’s anywhere close to sporty — except when it comes to the 2010 Infiniti FX35.\n\nThe FX35 is a genuine sports-car-injected SUV, boasting the looks, sounds and — ultimately — the faults of a traditional sports car.\n\nThe thing about sports cars is they typically make sacrifices — seasonal usability, gas mileage or cargo room — in order to be fun to drive. The FX35 inherits some of those traits, especially the seasonal usability aspect. Even with all-wheel drive, the FX wasn’t very composed driving in snow.\n\nPower & Handling\nUnder the base FX35’s hood is a 303-horsepower, 3.5-liter six-cylinder engine teamed with a seven-speed automatic transmission. While 303 hp may not sound like a whole lot of power in a 4,299-pound SUV, don’t be fooled; this combination is stout. The transmission and all seven of its gears harness the power so well I would have guessed there was much more power under the hood than what’s listed.\n\nInfiniti does all it can to make sure folks take note of the engine, giving it a racy exhaust note. Car guys will instantly recognize the sound of a late-generation Nissan Z or even — dare I say — a GT-R coming from the FX35’s tailpipes. I find the sound intoxicating, and I rolled down the windows any chance I got just so I could downshift a gear and hear the auto-rev-match blip the throttle.\n\nI haven’t driven the V-8 FX50, which has 390 hp, but the V-6 didn’t leave me longing for more power to make driving any more enjoyable. Gas mileage isn’t very impressive at 16/21 mpg city/highway with all-wheel drive, but it’s on par with competition like the BMW X6 xDrive35i, which is rated 15/21 mpg. The V-8 FX50 is rated 14/20 mpg. If gas mileage is a pressing issue, look elsewhere — like at the all-wheel-drive Lexus RX 350 ($39,025, 18/24 mpg).\n\nOther Cars.com editors have tested both the FX35 and FX50, and they agree that the FX35 is plenty competent. According to senior editor David Thomas, “the FX50 seemed overpowered, and I was constantly chirping tires when I didn’t want to. There is definitely some added off-the-line power some drivers might desire, but otherwise the FX35 produced plenty of exhilaration.”\n\nAlong with the FX’s excellent engine and transmission combination is an equally impressive suspension and good weight distribution for an SUV. This is where those optional 20-inch wheels and tires stand out, in a good way. The FX35’s road-holding ability on dry, curvy roads made for a planted, balanced ride that rarely felt like driving an SUV. BMW’s X6 offers a similar handling experience in both models, starting at a hefty $56,500 for the base, turbocharged 3.0-liter X6.\n\nWinter Drivability\nAll-wheel drive adds $1,450 to the FX’s base price of $42,850, and it’s a must-have feature if you live in the snow belt. Even with it, while I never got stranded or stuck on the side of the road, the FX didn’t have the most confidence-inspiring roadholding while driving through 2-3 inches of fresh snow.\n\nMy test FX’s uneasiness was probably thanks to its optional 20-inch-wheel and tire combination. Tires are just as important as all-wheel drive, if not more so, and the FX’s 20-inch, all-season tires were wide and contributed to my sliding around on snow-packed roads. Wider tires are great for traction on dry roads, but they don’t dig into snow for traction as well as narrower ones.\n\nThe SUV’s standard electronic stability system worked extra hard to keep the nose pointed straight. With the system turned off, the FX was a handful; the rear end was inclined to slide out through neighborhood corners. Even so, the FX35’s chassis is so well-balanced it was easy to counter steer and smoothly bring the tail back in line.\n\nA solution would be to pick up a separate set of winter tires and wheels. Twenty-inch winter tires are rare and expensive, so a smaller wheel combo with taller-sidewall tires may be a good option.\n\nLooks\nWhen the FX was redesigned for 2009, its characteristic sleek profile was unchanged. Everything else, though, looks a little more bloated than the previous model’s more angular appearance. It does still manage to pull off a sporty, aggressive look, with its long hood and swooping fenders that feel as if they belong on an early 1960s Chevrolet Corvette or Jaguar E-Type. This is especially true from behind the wheel, where the front fenders jut out and are clearly visible in the driver’s line of sight.\n\nThe FX flows seamlessly from nose to tail, with the exception of one body piece that doesn’t quite match the rest of the car, especially in dark-colored models: the side scoop vent, which Infiniti says allows air to escape from the engine compartment and reduces front-end lift. All the scoops are painted with a silver finish, similar to what a 16-year-old would paint on his Honda Civic with a rattle can. The scoop mixes better with lighter exterior colors.\n\nInterior & Cargo\nRoominess isn’t a strong suit of the FX35 once you get behind the front row. There’s not as much rear passenger and cargo room as you’ll find in more sedate SUVs, like the Lexus RX. That’s a sacrifice you’ll have to make for a performer like the FX — and at least it offers more usability than a sports sedan like the Infiniti G37 sedan.\n\nCompared with a direct competitor, the X6, the FX is marginally larger, with room for five people. The X6 has only four seats. I’ve never quite understood or appreciated the X6’s appearance and four-seat configuration, so the added practicality and lower price would sway me toward an FX.\n\nThat said, the more-expensive X6 is a leap ahead in terms of interior quality. The FX’s light-colored interior showed off some less-than-stellar materials, but I’m not as much a stickler for interior materials as are some others. In darker colors, I don’t think it would have been as noticeable. Also, the light-colored seats showed dirt after simple, normal use — of getting in and out while wearing blue jeans. Nothing a little leather cleaner can’t fix, but it’s a nuisance that darker colors would hide.\n\nFX in the Market\nFor sports-car owners forced to grow up and buy an SUV, the 2010 Infiniti FX is one of the best options when it comes to combining driving excitement and practicality. It may not be the leader in cargo space, fuel economy or winter drivability, but if you’re coming from a sports car or sedan, you’ll already be familiar with the downsides of sports-car ownership.\n\nIf that’s not a compromise you’re willing to make for a fun drive, well, there are plenty of less interesting SUVs out there you could buy.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "The Infiniti FX was something of a revelation when it made its 2003 debut. At the time, there were few sporty SUVs on the market — unless your definition of sport is the rugged, off-road type rather than the quick, nimble, on-road variety.\n\nThe refreshed 2012 Infiniti FX35 is essentially the same sporty performer it’s always been, but its balky transmission and the evolving crossover/SUV market make its appeal narrower all the time.\n\nUnlike most SUVs of its time, the 2003 FX35 was based on an enlarged car platform, yet it retained the rear-wheel drive that other models in the nascent crossover movement had abandoned. In a sense, it was an overgrown — and admittedly heavy — version of the G35 sedan and coupe, complete with reasonably balanced weight distribution and good dynamics. It also had ride quality sponsored by the American Dental Association, especially in the V-8-powered FX45 version. With the exception of gradual refinement and some styling changes, including a full redesign for 2009, the FX follows the same formula today. (See all the 2012 FX versions.)\n\nNew for 2012\nAlways a polarizing design, the FX has changed incrementally, again, for 2012, with a new grille that one of our editors thinks is an improvement. To me, it’s a step back. (For a while, Infiniti grilles were always different and interesting from one model to the next. Alas, they’re growing similar across the lineup.) Also new for 2012 is the all-wheel-drive Infiniti FX35 Limited Edition, the version we tested. It introduces Iridium Blue paint — a crowd-pleaser — and includes 21-inch alloy wheels and supposedly dark-tinted headlights and side vents, though they don’t look very dark to me.\n\nThankfully, the Limited Edition also adds some otherwise optional features to justify — or perhaps just explain — why it costs $52,000, which is $6,850 more than the base FX35 with optional AWD: A navigation system, the terrific Around View Monitor, aluminum pedals, floormats with blue piping, and a full roof rack are all included. For 2012, all FX models have white gauge backlighting, replacing the previous generation’s orange lights.\n\nCarlike Handling\nAs always, the FX handles well, in league with the likes of BMW’s X5 and Porsche’s Cayenne — specifically the X5 xDrive35i and the base Cayenne, if you’re comparing price and powertrains. These competitors also have rear-wheel drive or rear-biased AWD for a sporty feel. Though the FX’s ride quality has been smoothed out somewhat over the years, our test model’s 21-inch wheels appropriately evoked the model’s salad days, as we found ourselves tossed about like hapless romaine.\n\nSlight differences in tire series aren’t always dramatic, but you can expect a more compliant ride with the FX’s base 18-inch wheels. Unfortunately, an adaptive suspension is available only on the FX50, as an option.\n\nHurry Up? Wait.\nThe main problem I had with the Infiniti FX35 was its seven-speed automatic transmission, which was added in 2009. It hesitates so much when you call for more power that I have a hard time calling this SUV sporty. I’m not even sure I can call it acceptable. I had a similar complaint about the seven-speed in the Infiniti M sedan, but didn’t object to it in the G37. This seven-speed replaced a five-speed. More isn’t always better.\n\nThe Infiniti FX35’s 303-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 is no slouch and should satisfy most drivers, even in models saddled with the weight of AWD. However, an upgrade to Infiniti’s newer 3.7-liter engine (and presumably a renamed FX37) might improve the transmission performance: More power almost always makes an automatic transmission’s behavior less of an issue, as it does in the FX50, which has a 390-hp, 5.0-liter V-8 and standard AWD.\n\n \n\nEPA-Estimated MPG\n(city/highway — combined)\n2012 FX35 4×2\t2012 FX35 4×4\t2012 FX50 4×4\n16/23 — 19\t16/21 — 18\t14/20 — 16\n\n \n\nThe FX’s mileage is uninspiring, but the same can be said of comparable luxury SUVs, for which 19 mpg combined is the norm in base versions. Likewise, 16 or 17 mpg is common among the more powerful trim levels. All these models call for premium gasoline.\n\nInterior Tradeoffs\nOnce I’d called into question the FX’s sportiness, I found it harder to justify its drawbacks. Always a bold design statement, the FX’s sleek shape takes a toll on interior space. Thankfully, the supportive, comfortable front seats have generous legroom, 44.7 inches. The backseat is snug, and the legroom measurement of 34.6 inches is small even among sporty competitors like the Cayenne and X5. In practice, however, the ample front-seat legroom means there’s some flexibility. We even found that a rear-facing infant seat (always a difficult test) left the front passenger plenty of room. (See the Cars.com Car Seat Check.)\n\nPerhaps the boldly styled BMW X6 is the most appropriate model to compare, with 1.3 inches more backseat legroom but 1.3 inches less headroom. Like the FX, the X6 sacrifices cargo volume, totaling 20.1 cubic feet behind the backseat and 51.2 cubic feet with the seat folded. The FX has 24.8 and 62 cubic feet, respectively, which is within roughly 1 cubic foot of the Cayenne in both figures. The more conservatively styled X5 improves on them all, with 35.8 and 75.2 cubic feet. (See them compared.) Without a doubt, the hatchback design and a total of five seats provide a usable cargo area in all these models, but once you compare them with typical crossovers, the shortcomings are clear.\n\nSafety\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety reports its highest rating, Good, for the FX in a frontal crash test, but it hasn’t tested it for side impact or roof strength. The FX hasn’t been tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nIn addition to frontal and front-seat-mounted side-impact airbags, the FX has curtain airbags to protect front and rear occupants in a side impact. The front seats have active head restraints. As is required of all new vehicles beginning with the 2012 model year, the FX has standard antilock brakes and an electronic stability system with traction control. See all the standard safety features here.\n\nActive-safety options include precrash seat belts, forward collision warning, lane departure warning and prevention, and adaptive headlights.\n\nFX in the Market\nOff-road SUVs proliferated before their numbers thinned, leaving healthy demand for stalwarts like Jeep. Conversely, SUVs designed primarily for on-road sport, like the FX, didn’t become a significant subsegment. Does that mean the FX will remain a niche favorite, or will it lose its appeal? As drivability improves among more versatile crossover models — including Infiniti’s new JX model, a seven-seater — the Infiniti FX35’s limitations seem greater. They might even be greater than whatever performance advantages it brings — especially if you object to the transmission’s behavior.\n\nWe at Cars.com frequently criticize vehicles that exhibit accelerator hesitation — certainly more than most review sources do. Why there isn’t more outcry baffles us. It’s possible you could drive an FX happily and never object to its behavior, but you should be sure to pay attention when testing it. It’s easy to miss important attributes in the excitement and sensory overload of a test drive.\n\n \n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "Probably the most distinctive vehicle on the street today is also the most ambiguous. The Infiniti FX35, a self-proclaimed “premium crossover,” is a car/truck/minivan that endeavors to combine the practicality of a sport utility with the performance of a sports car.\n\nThat’s a tall order. But somehow, the FX35 manages to bring together these disparate segments and put them under one curvaceous roof. More or less.\n\nProduced by Infiniti, the luxury division of Nissan, the FX comes with either a 3.5-liter six-cylinder engine or, as the upmarket FX45, with a 4.5-liter V-8. Though it resembles the Nissan Murano in style and purpose, it’s a completely different vehicle.\n\nThis is a rear-drive wagon built on a modified chassis from the G35 coupe and sedan, which are widely praised for exceptional road manners. The FX35’s engine is the same muscular V-6 found in the G35 and Nissan 350Z sports car.\n\nThe FX is a consistent attention grabber, its bold styling and huge wheels drawing stares and glares. The look is not universally admired, though many who are at first repulsed eventually grow to appreciate it.\n\nBut the true test is behind the wheel, where the FX35 is most successful in fulfilling its strange mission.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe original Infiniti FX explored the boundaries of sportiness in an SUV, though not without some drawbacks in utility. It is sold as an FX35 and FX50 model. A 303-horsepower V-6 powers the FX35, while a 390-hp V-8 powers the FX50, which is covered in a separate report in the Cars.com Research section. A number of luxury SUVs, from the Lexus RX 350 to the Mercedes M-Class, compete with the FX. Rear-wheel drive is standard on the FX35, and all-wheel drive is optional.\n\nNew for 2011\nA power liftgate will become standard later in the model year.\n\nExterior\nThe FX’s beady headlights and snout-nosed grille are at least as controversial as those elements on its predecessor if not more so. Along the side, functional air vents reduce the FX’s lift, Infiniti says. With rear-wheel drive, the FX35’s front/rear weight distribution is 52/48. Exterior features include:\n\n\nStandard bi-xenon headlights\nStandard 18-inch alloy wheels\nAvailable 20-inch alloy wheels\n\nInterior\nThe cabin has a high dashboard. A ledge just below the windshield curls around to the windowsills, and air-conditioning and stereo controls sit below an available navigation display. The leather seats can come with quilted center inserts. Power adjustments for the front seats are standard. Interior features include:\n\n\nStandard reclining rear seat\nStandard Bluetooth\nStandard dual-zone climate control\nStandard power liftgate\nStandard USB input for MP3 players\nOptional heated and cooled front seats\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe FX35’s 3.5-liter V-6 makes 303 hp and teams with a seven-speed automatic transmission. Mechanical features include: \n\n\nPremium gas\nRear- or all-wheel drive\n2,000-pound towing capacity (AWD)\n\nSafety\nStandard safety features include active head restraints, side-impact airbags for the front seats and side curtain airbags for both rows. Traction control, an electronic stability system and four-wheel-disc antilock brakes are also standard. Safety features include:\n\n\nOptional lane departure prevention system\nOptional adaptive cruise control\nOptional forward-warning system can apply the brakes in the event of an impending collision",
