      "expert_review": "Last week, Infiniti announced that it’s going to put a larger, more powerful 3.5-liter V-6 engine in the 2002 edition of its entry-level I30 sedan. Believe us. Power is not the issue. The I30 dukes it out with some pretty rugged rivals in the near-luxury class – Lexus ES300, Acura 3.2TL, BMW 3-series and Audi A6, to name just a few. A couple of quirks, including the lack of dual-zone climate controls and standard heated seats, keeps this a whisker away from world-class status. Also, the $34,965 I30 Touring Sedan that we drove had a chassis so stiff, the Michigan potholes made our teeth chatter a little too constantly. And who ever heard of a sport sedan that doesn’t come with a manual transmission?\n\nHe: Gee, I really enjoy driving the I30t. It has one of the truly great engines in the business, a sweet twin-cam 3.0-liter V-6 that makes 227 horsepower and is coupled with a pretty smooth four-speed automatic transmission. The automatic is geared to take good advantage of the engine’s power band, and it returns surprising good mileage – up to 26 miles per gallon on the highway, according to the EPA. But there are still going to be some die-hard sports fans who’d prefer a manual. I have a harder time reconciling the ride quality.\n\nShe: I have a more basic issue. Does the I30 Touring Sedan want to be a guy car or a girl car? In some ways, it’s undergone a certain Oprah-zation. It’s in touch with its feminine side, with things like an elegant little analog clock in the center of the instrument panel, plus cushy leather seats and tinted glass that protects you from UV radiation. Is that something guys worry about – whether or not they’re going to develop cataracts because of their exposure to UV rays?\n\nHe: UV Rays? I thought that was some new techno band.\n\nShe: My point exactly. And then you pair up all those soft touches with all that horsepower and a stiff ride that left me uncomfortable even on the 25-miles-an-hour suburban side streets we were on. I just hate a car with an identity crisis. I have a hard enough time dealing with my own. So do you want me to talk now about my gripes with the $2,400 navigation system or do you have something intelligent to add?\n\nHe: Duh-Gee, I liked the navigation system, honey. It was kind of cute, with the bird’s-eye view and those icons of the Detroit Zoo and the RenCen.\n\nShe: I could not take my eyes off the darling little giraffe popping his head out of the zoo icon. These navigation screens ought to be banned entirely. I don’t care how clever they are. There’s got to be a better way to give drivers directions than to have them squinting at little TV screens. I would recommend against this option. I find it extremely distracting and plain dangerous.\n\nHe: Maybe you’re just easily distracted. I’ve often wondered if they should just ban wives from driving. Believe me, it’s far easier to follow directions from the navigation system, which by the way doesn’t talk back as often. Speaking of safety issues, you should be impressed with the Infiniti’s standard package of four-wheel disc brakes with ABS, plus front and side air bags. Or is that not gender-specific enough for you? OK, let’s talk handling. There’s the big compromise on the I30t, which features a sport-tuned suspension, low-profile 17-inch tires, plus speed-sensitive variable-assist steering. All guy stuff, I know, but it really makes the I30 fun to drive.\n\nShe: At the expense of your comfort. You’ve got to get in and give this car a serious test drive. It’s not for everyone. The I30 may look fairly generic on the outside, with some modest chrome touches and simple character lines. It doesn’t shout “sporty.” But it implies “luxury.” And that theme certainly follows through in the cabin, which is unusually roomy. Jump in the back seat. It has an almost limousine-like feel. And I love touches like grab handles on the backs of the front seats that pop out slight en you tug on them. But in some other ways, it’s really aggressive and harsh.\n\nHe: You want a soft weinie-mobile? Buy a Lexus or a Lincoln. But if you want to feel the road under your bottom and some power under your right foot, check out the I30 Touring Sedan.\n\n2001 Infiniti I30t\n\nAnita’s rating: Above average\n\nPaul’s rating: Above average\n\nLikes: Precise and responsive handling. Impressive power and acceleration. Roomy cabin. Attractive styling. Great 4-year/60,000-mile warranty with free roadside assistance. Cleverly designed navigation system (Paul).\n\nDislikes: A “touring sedan” with no manual transmission? Choppy ride on rough pavement. No dual temperature controls. No standard heated seats. Optional navigation system is distracting (Anita). Skip the $500 side sill “spoilers”.\n\nType: Front-engine, front-wheel drive, five-passenger luxury sedan.\n\nPrice: Base, $31,540; as tested, $34,965 (inc. $525 destination charge).\n\nEngine: 3.0-liter V-6; 227-hp; 217 lb-ft torque.\n\nEPA fuel economy: 19 mpg city/26 mpg highway.\n\n12-month insurance cost, according to AAA Michigan: $1,198 (Estimate. Rates may be higher or lower, depending on coverage and driving record.)\n\nWhere built: Japan",

      "expert_review": "In Native American lore, certain tribes are said to have gauged their greatness by the might of their enemies.\n\nMeasured by that standard, the Infiniti I30 seems to be great indeed because it’s surrounded by a veritable throng of successful adversaries.\n\nOf course, what that old tradition fails to mention is that some of these great tribes attracted such a formidable collection of enemies that they were either geographically displaced or eclipsed altogether.\n\nWhich is precisely the dilemma facing this new car. It’s pitted against some very tempting players in a very popular and expanding class — the so-called entry luxury segment. Noteworthy in this low- to mid-$30,000 realm are the Acura 3.2 TL, the BMW 3-Series, the Lincoln LS, the new Olds Aurora, the Mazda Millenia and, of course, the I30’s prime rival, the Lexus ES300.\n\nSmall wonder the I30 is struggling for visibility. Nevertheless, this second-generation offering from Nissan’s luxury division rates at least better than average, even in a segment where the minimum standard for survival is excellence.\n\nAs with the original I30, the new one has a lot of Nissan Maxima at its core. Unlike the original, this generation offers more separation from its less-expensive cousin.\n\nFor example, the two cars share almost no exterior sheet metal this time around.\n\nMerciless critics might suggest that the redesigned front end is a little too reminiscent of styling treatments from Lincoln or Mitsubishi, and there’s some truth in such an observation. On the other hand, derivative or not, the I30 has a smooth, sophisticated appearance and, to my eye at least, it’s more attractive than its Maxima cousin.\n\nMore important is what the makeover does for prospective owners. Like the Maxima, the new I30 is a good deal bigger than its predecessor. The wheelbase has been stretched 2 inches, to 108.3 inches, and overall length has expanded by 4.1 inches. It’s also almost an inch taller and more than half an inch wider. And it’s worth noting that all of these dimensions exceed those of the ES300 — the car the Infiniti marketing troops would most like to overtake in sales.\n\nMore carrying space\n\nExpanded exterior dimensions don’t mean much without commensurate interior benefits, of course. Which is precisely what the design team delivered. The front-seat area is one of the roomiest in this class, but more important, I think, is the 1.1-inch increase in rear-seat legroom, as well as a 1.6-cubic-foot expansion of trunk volume.\n\nThere’s an interesting psychological side effect to the interior redesign. Not only is it more voluminous but it also manages to feel even roomier than it is.\n\nHow can this be? I attribute it to two elements. First, the cabin’s glass area has been increased slightly, thanks to the slightly higher roofline, plus the steeper rake of the windshield and rear window. Second, and more important, the new dashboard slopes away slightly from front seat occupants — the lower portion is a little closer than the upper dash. Honda pretty much pioneered this trick, and it does wonders for opening up forward sight lines and enhancing the sense of plentiful space.\n\nStill another interior plus is the use of muted earth tones in a handsomely color-coordinated treatment. Oldsmobile’s interior-design studio helped to rewrite the rule book in this area with the Intrigue’s Pottery Barn color schemes, and it looks as if the I30 team took the lesson to heart.\n\nBeyond that, in addition to a revised control layout, the I30’s interior has some nice storage touches, including a small lidded bin atop the center of the dashboard — great for organizing tollway change and other odds and ends.\n\nEngine, handling\n\nAnd as you’d expect, standard equipment includes a substantial array of luxury features: premium audio, automatic climate control, power sunroof, leather and side air bags for front seat o upants.\n\nBut none of that gives the I30 a strong distinction versus its impressive rivals. The elements that really propel the I30 near the head of its class are dynamic — more motor and better handling.\n\nIn the latter category, the distinction is subtle. Nissan and Infiniti both make the usual chassis-stiffening claims for this redesigned unitbody, but the previous car wasn’t exactly chopped liver when it came to unwinding a set of ess-bends.\n\nMy test car was an I30t, for touring, which entails slightly sportier suspension tuning (at the expense of a very small tradeoff in road noise and firmer ride quality). Like the previous I30t, it stays reasonably level in hard cornering, recovers quickly in brisk directional changes and sticks pretty well in high-speed turns.\n\nIt also stops with gratifying alacrity. An improved antilock brake system is standard with disc brakes at all four corners, and the steering is distinctly improved.\n\nThe most immediately tangible improvement becomes apparent the minute the driver depresses the throttle. Although Infiniti, unfortunately, does not offer a manual transmission with the I30t — the take rate was just too low on the previous version — there’s a lot more power flowing through the revised four-speed automatic transmission.\n\nAlthough the displacement of the 3.0-liter, dual-overhead-cam, 24-valve, V6 engine is unchanged, this updated version represents a virtual redesign, particularly in the intake system. All told, the various upgrades, which also include an interesting innovation in the muffler, add up to a 16-percent gain in peak horsepower.\n\nPower, luxury\n\nThe previous version of the Maxima/I30 V6 was rated at 190 horsepower. As installed in the I30, the new engine generates 227 horsepower, 5 more than in the Maxima. While a 5-horsepower distinction between mechanically identical cars arouses my inner cynic (could the distinction belong to the marketing dynamometers?), there’s no question that this is a very impressive power plant, and power is one of the keys to a successful luxury car.\n\nI should also note that the Maxima/I30 design team did a respectable job of holding the line on curb weights, even though the vehicle expanded in every dimension.\n\nWhat all this adds up to is gratifying throttle response: plentiful power for stoplight getaways, lots of midrange punch for two-lane passing and an effortless freeway cruising output.\n\nAlthough the I30 competes with some outstanding V6 engines, particularly those offered by Honda and Lexus, this new one takes a back seat to none and is better than most.\n\nSo if the I30 is so super, why isn’t it tops in its class?\n\nThe truth is, it’s very close, and the distinctions are probably subjective.\n\nFor example, although it’s roomier and more powerful than a BMW 3-Series sedan, it’s just not a sport sedan in the same sense as the benchmark Bavarian. And in the realm of other fr ont-drive luxury sedans, it’s not quite as much of a bargain as the Acura 3.2TL, which comes absolutely loaded for less than $29,000 — about a grand less than the basic I30, about three grand less than my I30t.\n\nBut like the tribe measuring its self-image against the strengths of its enemies, it seems clear to me that the new I30 stands pretty high in the entry luxury pecking order — relatively higher, I think, than its predecessor.\n\nMoreover, although it’s not quite as quiet as its rival from Lexus, it’s a more gratifying car to drive. For many owners, that still counts for a lot.\n\nSPECS\n\nRating: 3 Stars\n\nVehicle type: Front-engine, front-drive midsize luxury sedan.\n\nKey competitors: Acura 3.2TL, Audi A6, BMW 3-Series, Lexus ES300, Lincoln LS Mazda Millenia, Mercedes-Benz C-Class\n\nBase price: $32,065\n\nAs tested: $32,065\n\nStandard equipment: ABS, front side air bags, automatic climate control, AM-FM-CDc ssette audio, power sunroof, power rear sunshade, power front seats, leather trim, power windows with driver’s one-touch up-down, power mirrors, keyless remote entry, cruise control, tilt steering, driver-seat position presets, fog lights, limited slip differential, aluminum alloy wheels\n\nSpecifications\n(Manufacturer’s data)\n\nEngine 227-hp, 3.0-liter V6\n\nEPA fuel econ. 20 m.p.g. city, 28 m.p.g. hwy.\n\nCurb weight 3,415 pounds\n\nWheelbase 108.3 inches\n\nLength 193.7 inches\n\nWidth 70.2\n\nHeight 56.7 inches\n\nAssembled in Japan",

      "expert_review": "The Infiniti Division of Nissan Motor Corp. knew it had a good thing in its flagship Q45 model. Not one to gloss over an opportunity, Infiniti built an I30 version that copied many of the Q45’s advanced features.\n\nIn 1996 form, the I30 is being offered in Standard, Leather, and Touring versions, the latter designed for drivers who want to do more than just sit there and steer.\n\nFor this version, Infiniti adds a sports-tuned suspension, wide-tread 215/60R 15 H-rated tires, performance forged alloy wheels, and a rear deck lid spoiler that has an integrated rear-center stoplight. It also has a traction- control system as standard equipment.\n\nTo set the Touring off from the rest of the line, styling includes an I30T emblem on the rear deck lid. While the emblem has nothing to do with aerodynamics, the rest of the silhouette does, as it has a slightly lower co-efficient of drag than its sibling models.\n\nInfiniti hands the hot-to-go motorist a fairly potent package in all its cars, with a four-cam V-6 engine that displaces 3.0-liters of piston displacement. That translates into 190 horsepower — a feature not common to luxury sedans.\n\nThe standard transmission is a close ratio five-speed manual, which gives drivers an opportunity to play a little tune with Infiniti’s high winding V-6. A four-speed automatic is optional.\n\n“The five-speed is more fun to drive,” said Bill Oswald, general sales manager for Dreyer & Reinbold Infiniti. “In addition, the automatic is $1,000 more money.”\n\nThe five-speed gives the I30T acceleration capabilities of 7.0 seconds for 0-60 mph. That time will put you right in the midst of rather sprightly running motor cars.\n\nFor those more interested in how the car looks than what makes it go, the I30T bears more than a passing resemblance to the larger Q45.\n\nWith the help of a 106.3-inch wheelbase and corresponding short overhangs both front and back, the I30’s large, open passenger area is quite similar to that of the Q45. The styling provides both driver and passengers with all-around excellent visibility.\n\nThe driver’s compartment layout is pretty much state-of-the-art. A center console that holds the gear shift levers separates the two individual bucket seats. Stereo and temperature controls are mounted in the center section of the dash. Instrumentation includes a tachometer with speedometer.\n\nInfiniti did, however, conduct extensive studies on driver eye motion to determine the optimal placement of instruments and controls. It’s an easy car to drive, with everything either right at hand level or within easy sight.\n\nIt also is a quiet automobile to drive, because its extremely rigid body reduces noise and vibration. Other sound-deadening measures include a special instrument panel isolator, extra insulation and extra wiring harness grommets in areas of the engine compartment, and extra insulation on parts of the transmission tunnel.\n\nWhen it comes to ride, the Infiniti is designed to set the standard for its class , and the Touring is especially designed for agile handling.\n\nA completely new multilink beam rear suspension has resulted in an innovative blend of handling and a comfortable large-car ride. The key to making the combination of torsional beam and multilink design work is a patented lateral link/control rod.\n\n“All Infinities are geared towards a driver’s driver,” Oswald said. “But with the “T” you get heavy- duty suspension, bigger tires, and alloy wheels.”\n\nAt $28,900, the standard I30 model is positioned between the Infiniti G20 and J30. The I30T’s performance features move it upstream a bit to $33,680.\n\n1996 Infiniti I30T\n\nModel year: 1996. Base price: $33,680. Type: Front engine, front-wheel drive, five-passenger touring sedan.

      "expert_review": "The Infiniti I30 has become an infinitely better luxury sedan for 1998.\n\nAs Nissan’s Infiniti Division’s volume leader, the I30 has been noted for its styling, space, and performance, attributes that are carried forward with significant updates to the 1998 model.\n\nThe revisions to the new model take in the exterior and interior, with the updates being about equal for the outside and inside.\n\nThe I30 body is anchored by strong styling of the front grille, flowing lines that result in a coefficient of drag of 0.32, new wheels for improved tractive effort, and a wide horizontal taillight treatment.\n\nThe front end puts a new face on the I30 via new halogen headlights featuring jewel-type lenses.\n\nThe wheels virtually are a transplant, being of the Q45t style.\n\nOffered in Standard and Touring form, it is the consensus that the I30 is a pretty slick looking automobile. Being confined to a degree by the dictates of the wind tunnel, designers have conformed to accepted aerodynamic standards but still have produced a four-door that makes its own statement.\n\nThe emphasis on the I30’s interior is luxury, comfort, and security. As a midsized sedan, the 106.3 inches of wheelbase and overall length that is just a tick under 190 inches (189.6) provides comfortable rear seat legroom and convenient entrance and exit.\n\nThe Touring is the more upscale of the two cars, and as a consequence offers leather as standard (an option package in Standard model form).\n\nThe 1998 cars offer an option with a new name. Formerly the Leather Appointed Model, it now becomes the Leather and Convenience Package option.\n\nIf you don’t trip over all of that jargon, you will find the option also includes the addition of the Infiniti name embossed on the front leather-appointed seats, perforated seating surfaces, and a new Sage leather color. Other LCP equipment includes a power sun roof, an anti-glare rearview mirror, and an Integrated HomeLink Transmitter.\n\nWhen you add to this the standard equipment of air, power, cruise, and numerous convenience items, you end up with a fully equipped automobile for about $30,000.\n\nThe I30 is a five-seater in the conventional 2/3 seating layout. Nothing radical here, with a center console dividing the two front seats.\n\nInstrumentation is a four main gauge layout of speedometer-tachometer-temperature-fuel. Climate and audio controls are berthed in a vertical pod located in the center of the instrument panel.\n\nThe cruise controls are mounted in the steering wheel.\n\nNew for ’98 is the addition of an outside temperature indicator, a new odometer with dual trip meters, and the relocation of the audio system tweeters from the side view mirrors to the door trim panel.\n\nIn this accepted standard arrangement, everything falls right to hand. There is nothing a first time driver has to learn.\n\nThe heart of any automobile is the engine, and in this respect the I30 is a stout-hearted motor vehicle.\n\nNissan is no stranger to going fast, and the ‘9 8 sedan upholds its speedy image.\n\nThe motor is Nissan’s 3.0-liter (182.2-cubic inch) dual overhead cam, 24-valve, aluminum V-6 that develops 190-horsepower and 205 foot-pounds of torque. In addition to its four valves per cylinder, the engine also features variable valve timing.\n\nWhen coupled to a Touring model’s five-speed manual transmission and 3,163 pounds of weight, you have the formula for flying low. This dude is really fast, like 139 miles per hour top speed, and 0-60 mph in 7.0 seconds. Yet for all the get-up-and-go, fuel mileage is 21 miles per gallon city, 26 highway.\n\nThe V-6 is as smooth as a V-8, with its high tech configuration offering superior performance whether with a five-speed or an automatic four-speed transmission.\n\nEqually high tech is the four- wheel independent suspension system designed to keep all four wheels in contact with the road.\n\nThe front suspension uses sub-frame located mountings to provide stiffness and reduce noise and vibration. But it’s th e rear that provides the key to the I30’s handling.\n\nIn the rear, a multi-link and torsion beam suspension utilizes a patented lateral link/control rod system that keeps the tires perpendicular to the road while controlling body roll in high speed turns.",
