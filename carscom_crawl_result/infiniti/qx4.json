      "expert_review": "The Infiniti QX4 luxury sport-utility vehicle is somewhat like the Q ships of the two World Wars.\n\nBoth the seagoing and land-going versions of the Qs were and are equipped with a vast number of surprises designed to ensnare inquisitive enemy sea captains and peace-loving SUV buyers.\n\nIn today’s peacetime, the 1998 QX4 lures its customers with a virtually unending list of characteristics that run from plush to brawny.\n\nNo candied dandy masquerading as an all-purpose vehicle suitable only for appearance at the country club, Infiniti’s SUV is a rugged piece of equipment clothed in the trappings of premium luxury.\n\nPriced for less than $40,000, the QX4 offers an abundance of standard equipment, an advanced All-Mode 4WD system, a MonoFrame body construction and front-strut suspension, and a luxurious interior cabin.\n\nWhile the majority of sport-utility vehicles evolved from truck platforms, the QX4 was conceived and created as a true luxury, with the ride, feel, features and performance of Infiniti’s upscale automobiles.\n\nDeveloped to provide the operating features of a car, the vehicle’s on-road comfort and off-road durability comes courtesy of an independent front-strut system. The struts are designed to offer a long stroke for exceptional wheel travel whether on pavement or off-road terrain.\n\nA five-link, coil-spring beam suspension provides long travel while controlling body roll and enhancing stability.\n\nThe base for this is a rigid MonoFrame construction that draws from unibody automotive design and body-on-frame truck design. The MonoFrame body reduces weight and is considerably more resistant to torsional and bending stresses than conventional body-on-frame layouts.\n\nIn addition to providing a stable platform, the design also reduces noise and vibration, improves body fit and enhances the handling.\n\nThe outstanding mechanical feature of the QX4 is its all-wheel-drive system.\n\nIt was developed not only to enhance stability and traction, but also to react to changing conditions more quickly than other four-wheel-drive systems on the market.\n\nThe heart of the All-Mode 4WD is a wet (running in oil) multi-plate clutch in the center differential that splits the drive to the front and rear axles. Managed by an advanced computerized electronic control unit, the multi-plate precisely and instantly allots the proper amount of torque, as conditions warrant, to the axles. The unit gathers information from front and rear driveshaft sensors to determine wheel slippage.\n\nThen, there is a throttle position sensor, an engine rpm sensor, an ABS control unit, and a transfer-unit lever selector that all work in conjunction to supply input.\n\nThe All-Mode offers drivers a choice of drive mode that is most appropriate to the running surface. Various modes are obtained by using a panel-mounted rotary switch to select automatic or manual operation, or the floor-mounted transfer lever to engage or disengage low range.\n\nThe system should be left in Auto range for normal daily operation.\n\nThe power to drive all this stuff comes from a 3.3-liter, single-overhead-cam V-6. It’s a two-valves-per-cylinder engine that develops 168-horsepower and a quite respectable 196 foot-pounds of torque.\n\nMaximum torque comes in at 2,800 rpm and remains relatively flat throughout the engine speed range. Maximum engine speed is 5,800 rpm.\n\nThis is a Nissan motor that obtains 15 miles per gallon on city streets and 19 on the highway. Being an SUV, the QX4 is no drag racer, but the 0-to-60-miles-per-hour acceleration time still is 11.2 seconds, and top speed is rated at 110 mph. That’s fairly respectable for a five-passenger sport ute.\n\nAs is expected with a luxury SUV, the QX4 doesn’t disappoint with its attention to detail and luxury appointments.\n\nAn occupant is engulfed in amply padded leather seating complete with a grain pattern and natural-appeari ng wrinkles. Leather is carried further with a wrapped steering wheel, shift levers and parking bra ke.\n\nWood-tone trim surrounds the interior, and accompanies a Bose sound system that was specifically designed for the QX4’s interior acoustics.\n\nA plethora of standard comfort and convenience items are packaged into 189.3 inches of overall length and 106.3 inches of wheelbase. The main development goal of the QX4 was to create a high-profile vehicle and one worthy of the Infiniti nameplate.",

      "expert_review": "Nissan’s Infiniti luxury division is the latest import brand to add a sport-utility vehicle to its lineup.\n\nThe new QX4 is based on the popular Nissan Pathfinder, which was given a major overhaul in 1996. After spending a week behind the wheel of a dark purple QX4, I was mightily impressed with the vehicle’s high quality, comfort and generous level of equipment.\n\nBut I wonder if there is $7,000 worth of difference between the QX4 and the top-of-the-line $30,000 Pathfinder LE.\n\nBoth vehicles have the same engine and transmission, nearly identical interior and much of the same equipment.\n\nWhen you buy the Infiniti, you get a more advanced four-wheel drive system, a different grille and taillights and some fake (make that faux) wood trim on the dash. There are also some other minor cosmetic changes.\n\nMore importantly, you also get treated like royalty whenever you visit the Infiniti dealer for maintenance and service. That means a free loaner car and other perks.\n\nWhether that is a strong enough inducement to pay the extra $7,000 or so is strictly a matter of personal choice.\n\nPERFORMANCE, HANDLING\n\nNissan could have and should have given the QX4 a more powerful engine. Not only would that have given potential buyers a more compelling reason to choose the QX4 over the Pathfinder, but it also would have made the most luxurious version of this truck more enjoyable to drive.\n\nAs it stands, the 168-horsepower, 3.3-liter V-6 delivers adequate acceleration and nothing more. The single overhead cam motor has a lot of work to do moving the 4,300-pound vehicle. Sometimes passing slower traffic quickly strains the engine. However, in normal city driving the V-6 runs smoothly and quietly and offers good acceleration from zero to 45 mph.\n\nTheQX4 comes only with a four-speed automatic transmission and four-wheel drive.\n\nBy simply turning a small knob on the dash, the driver can set the system totwo-wheel drive, to ”auto” or to ”lock.”\n\nWhen in the auto mode, an onboard computer constantly monitors the speed of the wheels. If it detects rear-wheel slippage, power is directed to the front wheels. If not, the QX4 bops down the highway using only the rear wheels for propulsion. In the lock position, 50 percent of the power is sent to the front wheels and 50 percent to the rear.\n\nI drove the QX4 most of the time in the auto mode. Because it rained frequently during the weeklong road test, the roads were slippery. I could not feel the four-wheel drive system at work, either because the wheels didn’t slip or because the system’s delivery of power to the wheels is exceptionally smooth.\n\nIn either case, the QX4 held the road well and inspired confidence when I drove it in bad weather.\n\nInfiniti engineers tuned theQX4’s suspension system for a smooth, quiet ride – very much in keeping with the division’s other luxury offerings. The QX4’s stiff chassis allows t he front independent and rear five-link suspension system generous up-and-down wheel movement, so that when the truck rolls over big bumps, very little of the energy is felt inside the vehicle.\n\nIn light off-road situations, such as on dirt roads and smooth fields of grass the QX4 is enjoyable to drive. Without more power, I’d never take the QX4 in off-road areas where a V-8-powered Land Rover Discovery, Mercury Mountaineer or Jeep Cherokee could go.\n\nTwo thumbs up for the QX4’s powerful front disc/rear drum anti-lock brake system and power assisted rack-and-pinion steering system.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nWhen you start with a vehicle as good as the Pathfinder – which I think is among the best in its price class – it’s hard to make improvements.\n\nBut I think the QX4’s interior is another area where Nissan could have done more to separate the top-of-the-line Pathfinder from the QX4.\n\nSome expensive-looking real wood trim on the dash and door panels would h ve been just enough to make the QX4 feel as if it were more than a tarted-up version of the Pathfinder.\n\nIn any case, the gorgeous leather-covered bucket seats were extremely comfortable over the long haul. I made several trips of more than two hours and felt fine.\n\nRearseat passengers will find a good amount of head, leg and foot room. But I felt the seating position in the back seemed a bit low. If Infiniti could raise the rear seats about two inches, rear seat passengers would feel more a part of the interior.\n\nI folded the rear seats forward and discovered the QX4 has enough cargo room to haul a full-size bicycle. But folding the seats forward is a two-step process that requires some handiwork.\n\nFirst you have to pull up the bottom cushions. Then you have to remove the rear headrests. Then you can fold the seatbacks forward. I have still not seen a compact sport utility vehicle that has a more user-friendly interior than the Ford Explorer/Mercury Mountaineer. The Ford seats fold forward and flat in seconds.\n\nI have one major gripe about the QX4. The vehicle does a miserably poor job of dispersing water. Drive the QX4 through a large puddle and water will shoot out and up from the front tires and land on the windshield heavily enough to nearly obscure your vision. Further, water collects on the roof and runs down the windshield and the side windows when the vehicle starts or stops after being rained on. I can’t recall driving a vehicle that so poorly managed water.\n\nAs you would expect of an Infiniti, the QX4 is a very well-equipped vehicle.\n\nAnd though it is hard to define value in $37,000 truck, I can’t find one area where I felt the QX4 was lacking in equipment. It had just one option, the $1,650 Premium Sport Package, which included a power sunroof and a limited slip rear axle. A CD player, cruise control, power heated seats, power mirrors, windows and door locks, leather interior, fog lights, aluminum wheels and many other items come standard.\n\nSince the QX4 went on sale in January, Infiniti dealers have been selling them with no trouble. Perhaps the same people who buy Infinitis wouldn’t be caught dead in a Nissan showroom.\n\nBut for those who are more concerned about tangible things, such as performance and value for the money, the Pathfinder Le will get you where you are going in much the same way for a whole lot less money.\n\nSpecifications:\n\nINFINITI QX4\n\nLENGTH Overall 183.9\n\nFRONT COMPARTMENT Head room 38.1 Leg room 41.7\n\nREAR COMPARTMENT Head room 37.5 Leg room 31.8\n\nWARRANTY Four-year, 60,000-mile bumper-to-bumper; six-year, 70,000-mile powertrain coverage; seven-year unlimited mileage rust protection and 24-hour roadside assistance.\n\nMECHANICAL Drivetrain layou t: front-mounted engine, transmission and transfer case, four-wheel drive. Brakes: Power-assisted front disc/rear drum with ABS. Engine: 168-horsepower, 3.3-liter single overhead cam 12-valve V-6. Transmission: Computer-controlled four-speed automatic.\n\nOTHER MODELS N/A\n\n-Base price: $35,550.\n-Price as tested: $37,695.\n-EPA rating: 15 mpg city/19 mpg highway.\n-Incentives: None.\n-Safety: Dual air bags, anti-lock brakes and side-impact protection.\n\nTruett’s tip: The classy QX4 is a tightly built and quiet-running luxury four-wheel drive vehicle. With more horsepower and some real wood trim inside, it would be a contender for best in class.",

      "expert_review": "As concerned Ford Explorer owners search for replacement tires, I found myself helping friends clean out a garage full of old car parts.\n\nThe reason car enthusiasts hord parts is so that when something breaks, the collector will have a spare on hand. Although these friends (aka the troublemakers) do have extra tires, some of which I hauled, they don’t have any extra Explorer tires. This is despite owning an Explorer.\n\nOf course, after an afternoon of hauling dusty old boxes full of enigmatic scraps of rubber and metal, it was comforting to climb into the cushy luxury of Infiniti’s newly-reworked QX4 sport utility vehicle. This vehicle was way too nice to haul dusty old car parts.\n\nThe basic chassis is carried over from last year, as is most of the bodywork. But the grille and bumpers have been reworked. The most notable change is the high-intensity discharge Xenon headlamps up front. But this subtle change shouldn’t hide the bigger change underneath.\n\nFor 2001, Infiniti ups the power ante with an all-new 3.5-liter double-overhead-cam V-6, good for 240 horsepower and 265 foot-pounds of torque. This is a huge improvement over the 3.3-liter single-overhead-cam 170-horsepower mill that previously resided under the hood. Power is effortless and comes on strong from low in the rev range. It comes on smooth, with a solid exhaust note to remind you that you’re riding in a truck. But it’s not objectionable.\n\nPower is fed through a four-speed automatic transmission to an all-wheel-drive system. The system is derived from the all-wheel-drive system used in Nissan’s Skyline sport coupe. It works invisibly with a simple twist of a dash-mounted switch, delivering up to 50 percent of the vehicle’s torque to the front wheels. A low range is included for low-traction situations. For the first time, a two-wheel-drive version is available.\n\nHandling is quite adept for an SUV. This was always a QX4 strong suit, but the added power makes it more apparent. There’s an excellent balance between a comfortable ride and capable handling. Body lean is minimal, and there’s little front-end dive when braking. There’s some tire noise, but otherwise, the car is quiet. This is one SUV that has terrific on-road manners.\n\nOverall, this is one the best handling SUVs I’ve driven in a while.\n\nThe interior sees some change, as well as the exterior.\n\nInfiniti warms up the interior with generous doses of leather and imitation birds-eye maple. With a new analog clock at the top center of the dash, the interior does have a more opulent feel. The leather is of a better quality than previous samples.\n\nThe dash has easy to read gauges, although as is typical these days, information is limited to fuel and temperature. The test vehicle has the optional GPS system installed, which mired the otherwise ergonomically-correct interior.\n\nLike all GPS systems, this one was distracting. The visual presentation is crudely executed, again, common to most systems o f this ilk. Uncommonly, this map was presented in a 3-D grid and didn’t seem very accurate. Worse, one has to use the GPS screen to adjust the climate control. Skip this option.\n\nThe center console had plenty of space for beverages. The storage bin had loads of space. A console and outside temperature gauge is mounted just above the rear-view mirror. Heated seats, auto up/down windows, seat position memory were all included. Despite the pretense of luxury, there were a couple items missing that are common in luxury vehicles. There’s no auto-dimming rearview mirror, rear seat climate controls or mini-computer to gauge fuel economy and other miscellaneous info.\n\nThe low-mounted front seats proved comfortable, although long-legged drivers will find leg room on the short side. Raising the power-activated seats doesn’t help, for head room is tight. It’s even worse in the rear seat. I didn’t fit. This cabin seems very tight for the size and mission of the vehicle.\n\nCargo room is ge ous and like any SUV the rear seats fold flat to provide 85 cubic feet of space. The CD changer is located in the cargo area behind a door. A piece of velcro keeps it from flopping about. However, there’s no provision for the CD cases, which must be carried elsewhere.\n\nFuel economy was about the norm for an SUV, 16.5 mpg in mostly city/suburban driving. Inifiniti recommends using premium fuel.\n\nYes, this quiet capable SUV was way too nice to haul old Packard parts. But it was nice enough to haul my aching body home to rest up for next week.\n\nThere’s still half a garage to empty.",
