      "expert_review": "The personal car trend in today’s automobile industry has brought about cars with a personality. Not to be left wanting, Infiniti Division of Nissan Motor Corp. has introduced a 1993 Infiniti J30 model that definitely has a personality all its own.\n\nMany regard the new J30 as the best-looking Infiniti ever turned out by the division, and with good cause.\n\nStyled at Nissan Design International in La Jolla, Calif., the car’s fluid, rounded form gives a clear indication of the company’s view of the future.\n\nDealers say customers bought the predecessor J30 because of the quality of the workmanship and the amenities offered. These obviously have been retained’ but a third dimension, a bold look, is playing an increasing role in attracting purchasers.\n\nThe ’93 J30 offers a dramatic front view that is highlighted by twin projector-beam headlights and a broad aerodynamic stance. The body is a series of blended curves that provides a low coefficient of air drag and results in reduced wind noise at high speed.\n\nThe J30 sedan that David Holscher, general sales manager for Dreyer & Reinbold Infiniti, provided for a test car had an air of virtual mortuary silence about it. But the four-door was far from deceased.\n\nIf it is true that man does not live by bread alone, then it can be said that an automobile doesn’t exist on styling alone. And the J30 doesn’t.\n\nTechnology has been mated with styling to produce a sedan that performs like a silken-gloved sports car while offering the accouterments of a luxury four-door.\n\nPowered by V-6 engine\n\nThe Infiniti’s power comes from a high-tech V-6. The 3.0-liter (180.56-cubic-inch-displacement) engine has four overhead cams and four valves per cylinder. It produces 210 horsepower.\n\nFour-cam, 24-valve V-6s are not all that uncommon anymore, but Nissan has gone a bit further with this one. The J30’s engine is based on the V-6 in the Nissan 300ZX. It utilizes a valve timing control system that adjusts valve overlap in response to engine load and engine speed.\n\nThis enhances the torque in all speed ranges, as drivers will find when they drop the hammer for maximum acceleration. The J30 is a rear-drive with limited slip differential, and the rear wheels just keep pushing all the way up the engine’s speed range.\n\nMaximum horsepower comes in a 6,400 rpm and maximum torque at 4,800 rpm. The four-cammer is so smooth and quick revving that the sensation of speed is almost absent until you look at the instrument panel.\n\nPerformance enthusiasts may throw up their hands at the thought of the car being available only with an automatic transmission, but the shift points are high enough that the V-6 can flex its muscle.\n\nIn order to shift smoothly but without burning the clutch, engine power is retarded for an instant just prior to shifting. It all happens so quickly you never even know there has been a power drop, and full-throttle gear changes are made without a trace of a lurch.\n\nToday’s thinking relative to perf ormance handling characteristics has shifted away from a ride that is about a stiff as a slab of cement. Now it’s toward more supple wheel movement.\n\n2The thought is that for control it is better to have the wheels in contact with the pavement rather than having the vehicle leap from peak to peak over a rough road surface.\n\nThe J30’s four-wheel independent suspension system rides on front and rear subframes, with the rear multilink suspension being similar to that of the bigger Infiniti Q45. The ride is luxury-car easy without being soft, and there is high-speed stability and excellent cornering response.\n\nThe sedan is not a dirt- track racer, so if you go into a corner hard enough there is a trace of body lean. But at no time do you get the impression the car is going to play tricks on you.\n\nJ30 has luxury price\n\nAs with any luxury automobile, all this comes at price. On the test car it was$33,400.\n\nIn return, the J30 will stand up with the best of the luxury automobiles relative to accessories and appointments. Everything is standard — all the expected driver/passenger power systems, stereo, climate control, tilt steering column, power sunroof and the like. There even is wiring for a cellular telephone.\n\nAnd a safety feature not found in all luxury sedans was both driver-side and passenger-side air bags.\n\nI would have liked a telescopic wheel to go with the tilt steering column, because that lets the driver get way back from the pedals. But with eight-way power front seats, it still was easy to find a driving position where I felt like I had hold of the machine.\n\nSeats 5 passengers\n\nThe J30 is a five-passenger automobile with exterior and interior dimensions to match. The rounded doors extending into the roof made getting in and out easy, and there was plenty of legroom and headroom once seated behind the wheel.\n\nI also would appreciated a bit more rear-seat legroom when the driver or passenger seats were in their rear-most positions. But unless you’re the size of a Colts lineman, you won’t find seating cramped.\n\nAs personal luxury cars go, this new J30 is pretty personal. And it constitutes one of the better efforts by Infiniti Division.",

      "expert_review": "If you’re among the crowd that thinks all cars look alike, I’d like to direct your attention to the Infiniti J30.\n\nIts elegant Art Deco design was a reaction against the tyranny of the wedge — design talk for all those cars with big, bland backsides. Nope, the J30’s deck slopes. (If you doubt its influence on design, take a look at Ford’s Taurus and Sable.)\n\nBut the styling doesn’t just reside out back. The car’s Jaguar-esque stance — and Jag-style wheel arches — give this sedan a sporty air.\n\nIt also give it a schizophrenic feel: This is one sedan that thinks it’s a coupe.\n\nThis is especially true of the J30t model tested here. The “t” stands for “touring package.” This $2,000 option ruins the car’s sumptuous backside with an aptly named spoiler, but adds goodies such as alloy wheels, performance tires and recalibrated springs and stabilizer bars. As a result, this sedan has a tighter, sportier feel than its less-expensive sibling. It leans towards the firm, communicative side of the driving equation. You’ll definitely feel those frost heaves and potholes, but in return you’ll get a sedan with little body lean through the twisties. The tail can get twitchy, but that can be an advantage as much as a drawback to the driving enthusiast.\n\nYou’ll want the extra margin of handling — underneath the hood lurks the heart of the late, lamented 300ZX: a fire-breathing, growling 3.0-liter, dual overhead cam, 24-valve V-6. Producing 210 horsepower through the rear wheels, the power plant rewards aggressive driving with an 8.3-second 0-60. The transmission shifts quickly and cleanly when driving fast, yet can seem undecided at about which gear to be in at moderate speeds. Despite all the speed and sportiness, the drive train is as refined as its wrapper.\n\nTrue to its schizo nature, this luxo-sedan thinks it’s a Z-car. That’s true when you get inside as well. The most striking thing is the beautiful round analog clock nestled in the center of the dash.\n\nThe clock’s extravagant look points out the relatively stark feel of the rest the cabin. Trimmed out in hard plastic and leather of average quality, the first impression is not one of opulence, especially when decked out in charcoal gray. The seats are firm and comfortable, and come with adjustable lumbar support and heaters. Their firmness is more striking than their exquisite leather trim. The rear seat and trunk are tight, just like in a sports coupe. Traction control isn’t even offered — unusual among rear-drive sports coupes, er, sedans.\n\nThe AM-FM cassette CD system might look like the one offered in lesser Nissan automobiles, but it sounds great, pumping out the Prokofiev without missing a beat. Dual airbags are standard, as are anti-lock brakes.\n\nThere are luxury cars that have more features for the same money, but what the J30t has is a character that seems lacking in many Japanese luxury sedans. This one doesn’t think i t’s a sedan at all. With its impressive speed and handling; influential, distinctive styling, and tight trunk and back seat, you’ll swear it’s a car going through a mid-life crisis — it wants to be a coupe.\n\nInfiniti J30t Standard: 3.0-liter double overhead cam V-6; four-speed automatic transmission; speed-sensitive power steering; four-wheel independent suspension; four-wheel power disc brakes with anti-lock; limited-slip differential; dual airbags; anti-theft system; 215/60R15 tires; power sunroof; heated remote outside mirrors; in-glass cellular phone antenna; heated leather seats; wood accents; cup holder; floor mats; power lumbar support; CFC-free air-conditioning; automatic climate control; 200-watt Bose audio system with cassette-CD; automatic anti-glare mirror; cruise control; variable intermittent wipers. Optional: Touring package (alloy wheels, performance suspension, deck lid spoiler, J30t badge) Base price: $39,920 As tested: $4 ,400 EPA mileage: 18 mpg city, 23 mpg highway Test mileage: 18.9 mpg Warranty: Four years/60,000 miles",

      "expert_review": "Not being above trying to make a good thing better, the Infiniti Division of Nissan Motor Corp. has brought out a 1997 1/2 Infiniti J30, rather than wait for 1998.\n\nThe 1997 1/2 J30, which was designed at the Nissan Design International Center at La Jolla, Calif., adopts a fluid shape. Rather than being a smaller version of the upscale Infiniti Q45, the sedan tends to stand out as a distinctive member of the Infiniti line.\n\nIn an era when front-wheel drive is embraced by manufacturers as the answer to all of man’s ills, the J30 has rear-wheel drive. To take advantage of this, power comes from an advanced piece of high technology, namely a 3.0- liter (180-cubic inch) V-6 that possesses double overhead cams, four valves per cylinder, and variable valve timing.\n\nThe resulting smoking gun churns out 210-horsepower, considerably above the performance benchmark of 1- horsepower per cubic inch. Torque is 193 foot-pounds.\n\nYou obviously need a chassis that can handle this sort of power, so Nissan’s engineers have provided one that combines strength and rigidity without a significant increase in weight.\n\nA high density foam is injected into the chassis to reduce platform flex. The foam also acts to absorb ambient sounds and vibrations that can resonate in platform components.\n\nCombine this with DURASTEEL body panels that have significantly higher corrosion resistance than conventional galvanized steel panels, and you have a structure about as strong as a bridge.\n\nFor the “heavy foot” contingent, Infiniti offers a “t” for Touring model. The J30t is a sportier version of the 1997 1/2 J30, offering a stylish decklid spoiler and unique forged alloy wheels.\n\nIn the mechanical department, the J30t has recalibrated springs and stabilizer bars to better control body roll during high-speed cornering. Performance steel-belted radial tires are optional at no additional cost.\n\nThese performance additions, combined with rear-wheel drive, will let the road racer types throw the car around in a manner that won’t work with a front- wheel drive.\n\nThe rear end contains a viscous limited slip differential that drives both wheels when one begins to slip. If you get the back end out in the middle of a fast turn, you can get it back in. However, it is highly recommended with this style of driving that you know what you’re doing with that throttle and steering wheel.\n\nI’d say the acceleration characteristics are fair, based mainly on the fact that there is no five- speed gearbox offered. The transmission is an electronically controlled four- speed automatic.\n\nThe automatic produces 0-60 mph in 8.3 seconds. A five- speed, with which you could let that DOHC V-6 really wind through the gears, probably would knock off a full second or more.\n\nThe mileage, however, is pretty attractive with the automatic, at 18 mpg city and 23 mpg highway.\n\nThe J30 carries a sticker of $33,500 plus $495 for freight. The J30t with the Touring package is an additional $2,000.\n\nInfiniti s lashed the cost of both models a little over $2,200 late last year, but the prices still put the sedans squarely in the luxury category.\n\nAs such, the interior does make a statement.\n\nThe car is a five-seater, with the driver’s compartment having the traditional center console that mounts the shift quadrant for the automatic transmission. Leather seats are standard. And with 191.3 inches of overall length on a 108.7 inch wheelbase, the interior room is comfortable.\n\nAdding to the comfort are eight-way heated power front seats, a power-adjustable lumbar support for the driver’s seat, cruise- control switches mounted within the steering wheel rim, and full carpeting and floor mats.\n\nWith virtually everything being standard on this 1997 1/2 J30, the only options are the Touring Package and a trunk-mounted multi-disc CD autochanger.",
