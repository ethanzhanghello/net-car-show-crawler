      "expert_review": "With a 340-horsepower V-8 engine driving the rear wheels, M45 is a fast machine with lots of appeal.\n\nA new addition that fills out Infiniti’s middle range, it’s also a conservative-looking sedan that fails to register many second glances. And based on a long-running Nissan staple in Japan, M45 is saddled with some aging chassis technology.\n\nNissan and its luxury division, Infiniti, have been creating remarkable cars and trucks in the past few years, turning the Japanese automaker away from the brink and back on solid ground. Infiniti is being set up as a luxury/performance brand, leaving the cushy pure-luxury realm to archrival Lexus.\n\nAlthough Infiniti’s redesigned Q45 flagship and new G35 are stylish and sporting, the M45 is something of a mixed bag. Engine power sparkles, but the overall driving experience is not as bright as it could be. And styling falls short of Infiniti’s other shining stars.\n\nEngine and transmission:\n\nThe powerful 4.5-liter V-8 is the same engine that motivates Infiniti’s flagship, Q45. Only here, it’s in a lighter, more maneuverable vehicle.\n\nCompetitors have to get up into their premium-priced performance range, such as AMG for Mercedes, to match the engine power in the M45. Off-the-line acceleration is strong, so much so that a careless push of the throttle can rocket you into trouble before you know it. Under way, things settle down a bit, though this V-8 is always ready to pull.\n\nSmooth and quiet, the engine provides a sophisticated aura for the M45, not just power. The 4.5-liter is the only engine available, along with a five-speed automatic with a manual-shifting mode.\n\nHandling and drivability:\n\nThe M45 drives and handles nicely, but its road manners are not nearly as impressive as its engine power. What’s lacking is the solid ride and responsiveness of the European sports sedans, such as Audi’s S6, or Infiniti’s smaller G35.\n\nBased on the chassis of a Japanese home-market product, the Nissan Gloria (which is widely used as a taxi), the M45 seems dated despite all the power, electronic equipment and luxury features.\n\nThe speed-sensitive rack-and-pinion steering is quick and direct, and the suspension works to keep the M45 level in turns and steady on the road. But all together, not considering the engine power, the M45 feels bland and unremarkable.\n\nBraking is good, via four-wheel vented discs enhanced with anti-lock; brake assist, which boosts brake pressure in panic stops; and electronic brake distribution.\n\nStyling:\n\nThe midsize Infiniti is surprisingly plain looking, especially in relation to the edgy, forward-looking styles of such recent Nissan and Infiniti cars as Altima, Maxima and the G35. The M45 is attractive, with nicely creased character lines, a good-looking grille, projector headlamps and a purposeful appearance. But it fails to stand out like other recent Nissan and Infi niti products.\n\nInterior:\n\nThe black-leather cabin looks businesslike, with supportive seats, bird’s-eye maple trim and Infiniti’s customary analog clock, which is handsome and jewel-like. The back seat is tight on legroom, and the center hump (remember, this is a rear-drive car) makes the center seat fairly useless.\n\nThe center video-display control panel, similar to that in the Q45, is a real pain. The audio and climate control share the digital array, which requires manipulating the screen every time you want to change a station or change the temperature setting. That’s an extra step and extra time with your eyes off the road to manipulate the controls.\n\nThe control knobs on the center binnacle are haphazardly and illogically arranged. Maybe you eventually get used to them, but in a weeklong road test, it never came easy.\n\nThe interior is enhanced with a load of standard luxury features. There’s a 225-watt audio system with seven Bose speakers, along with a six-disc CD changer that sounded really great. Also standard are dual-zone temperature control with rear-console ducts; leather seats and steering-wheel rim; and front and rear side-impact air curtains.\n\nOptional technology includes a DVD video-display mapping system, a laser-guided cruise control that maintains following distances behind traffic, and the Voice Recognition System from the Q45. None of this stuff was on the test car.\n\nPricing:\n\nThe base price of $42,300 seems steep, with the Q45 starting at just a few thousand more. For that money, you do get that sparking engine power and a bunch of luxury and performance gear, but competition from BMW, Audi, Volvo, Mercedes-Benz, Cadillac and Lexus is pretty stiff in this range.\n\nThe test car included: a large sunroof, $1,000; a comfort and convenience package of tire-pressure monitor, full-size spare, Homelink transmitter, driver’s memory seat, anti-glare mirrors and an electronic compass, $950, which seems like a lot; a trunk mat, $60; and shipping, $545. The total is $44,855.\n\nBottom line:\n\nA fast sedan with a load of luxury and performance features, the M45 fades in the face of heated competition, despite its horsepower advantage.\n\nInfiniti M45\n\nVehicle type: Five-passenger, four-door sedan, rear-wheel drive.\n\nBase price: $42,300.\n\nPrice as tested: $44,855.\n\nEngine: 4.5-liter V-8, 340 horsepower at 6,400 rpm, 333 pound-feet of torque at 4,000 rpm.\n\nTransmission: Five-speed automatic.\n\nWheelbase: 110.2 inches.\n\nCurb weight: 3,851 pounds.\n\nEPA mileage: 17 city, 23 highway.\n\nHighs:\n\nEngine power.\n\nLuxury features.\n\nAttractive interior.\n\nLows:\n\nMundane styling.\n\nUninspiring road feel.\n\nDashboard control woes.",

      "expert_review": "Infiniti’s M45 Sport is one of those cars that made me rethink the definition of a sports car.\n\nWith a muscular, 335-horsepower V-8 stuffed under the hood and 19-inch wheels hanging on to the pavement like cat claws, the M45 Sport is easily as quick, and as nimble, as many two-seat sports cars. And you don’t have to sacrifice a usable back seat and a nice-sized trunk to enjoy sports-car performance.\n\nThe M45 Sport has a base price of $49,550. Competitors include the BMW 5-series, Mercedes-Benz E-class, Lexus GS, Audi A6 and Acura RL.\n\nFor those who want the same look but don’t need as much horsepower, the M35 is equipped with a 280-horsepower V-6 and starts at $40,640.\n\nAn all-wheel-drive M35 begins at $43,140. The V-8 is not offered with all-wheel drive. Infiniti’s M models have a five-speed automatic transmission with manual shift mode, leather seats, voice recognition, keyless ignition, Bluetooth wireless technology, an in-dash six-disc CD changer and a power sunroof.\n\nInfiniti’s gutsy 4.5-liter V-8 is marvelously smooth, yet it flexes its muscles at the slightest urging. Nail the throttle and the engine responds with a muted howl.\n\nAcceleration is strong and sure. Slip the automatic transmission into manual mode and shifting up and down through the gears is fun even if you’re only running to the grocery store. The dual exhausts are loud enough to be stimulating, yet they don’t interfere with the car’s luxury persona.\n\nThe M model uses a modified version of the same FM chassis platform that is under the G35 sedan and FX crossover SUV. FM stands for Front-Midship, and that means the engine is located aft of the front wheel’s centerline for more balanced weight distribution. The M45 Sport looks especially purposeful with a squat stance, big tires and a low roof. Short front and rear overhangs emphasize its performance character. The long wheelbase and short overhangs also contribute to a roomy interior, and the wide track adds stability. Aluminum is used for the hood, decklid and inner and outer door panels to save weight.\n\nThe M45’s cabin has deep bucket seats that are firm and supportive. When they’re equipped with the climate-control function, warm or cool air is circulated through the tiny perforations in the leather. I didn’t find these seats to be as warm in the winter as regular heated seats, however.\n\nAccessing and controlling the audio and climate systems is done via a large multipurpose knob on the dash, similar to BMW’s iDrive system. The system is fairly intuitive, but it still requires time to understand which knob does what. Simpler would be better.\n\nA 7-inch LCD display in the center of the dash contains readouts for heating/cooling, audio and the optional navigation system. The screen becomes a video monitor when the car is equipped with the rear-view monitor option. When the gear lever is put in reverse, the screen shows a video picture of the area behind the vehicle. The rear-view monitor is indispensable for parking because it has a movable grid pattern that shows just how close you are to objects behind the vehicle.\n\nThe M45 Sport does a great job of balancing ride comfort with handling. The ride never feels harsh, but the car remains uncommonly composed when you hustle it through turns. Rear-active steer uses electric motors to adjust the rear-wheel geometry to optimize stability. Electronic driving aids such as vehicle stability control, rear active steer, traction control, brake assist and anti-lock brakes also play an important role in maintaining agility and stability, especially in emergency evasive situations. The M sedan is available with a warning system that sounds an alert when the vehicle strays out of its lane.\n\nSafety features include dual-stage front airbags and roof-mounted side-impact curtain airbags. The pre-crash option tightens front seat belts in anticipation of an evasive maneuver or a crash.\n\n——————————————————————————–\n\nPrice\n\nThe base price of the test car was $49,550. Options included the Bose stereo, rearview monitor, XM satellite radio, pre-crash seatbelt system and a digital compass. The sticker price was $52,210.\n\nWarranty\n\nFour years or 50,000 miles.\n\n——————————————————————————–\n\nEngine: 4.5-liter, 335-hp V-8\n\nTransmission: Automatic\n\nRear-wheel drive\n\nWheelbase: 114.2 inches\n\nCurb weight: 3,995 lbs.\n\nBase price: $49,550\n\nAs driven: $52,210\n\nMpg rating: 17 city, 23 hwy.\n\n——————————————————————————–\n\nAt A Glance\n\nPoint: The M45 Sport combines aggressive handling with a 335-horsepower V-8, luxurious cabin and a lean, athletic profile.\n\nCounterpoint: The audio and climate control system is more complicated than it needs to be. The warm air that circulates through the seats is not as comfortable the warmth from electrically heated seats.\n\n——————————————————————————–\nTo get in touch with Tom Strongman, send e-mail to tstrongman@kc.rr.com.",

      "expert_review": "It was a what-the-heck day — crisp, cold and slightly overcast, perfect for driving simply because there was a great car to drive.\n\nI called Bella, one of my road buddies. She has been having a hard time of late, having buried her partner barely a year ago, and now caring for a sister battling cancer.\n\nIt is my long-held belief that road trips spontaneously taken are the best escapes from worldly worries. Bella, a friend of seven years, has similar faith. We hit the road in the 2007 Infiniti M45 Sport sedan, driving west of the District into Virginia’s Shenandoah Valley. We didn’t stop until we turned onto Sperryville Pike in Sperryville, Va., and spotted a quaint little restaurant, the Thornton River Grille.\n\nWe arrived 10 minutes before the restaurant’s closing at 3 p.m. But the place was pleasant. The staff was friendly and willing. We were hungry. We settled in for a late lunch.\n\nHave you ever been in an out-of-the-way restaurant at an odd afternoon hour with a friend you haven’t seen or spoken with in four months?\n\nI broke the silence.\n\n“What do you think about the car?” I asked.\n\nBella smiled knowingly. I could read her thoughts: Same old Warren. The world’s a mess. Wars are raging. My heart is still breaking for my lost love. I have a sister ill in California. And here we are alone in a little Virginia town, an easy chance for me to talk and him to listen, and all he wants to talk about is the car.\n\nShe looked at me, laughing and trying to suppress tears.\n\n“It’s a lot better than my Ford Focus,” Bella said.\n\n“Anything is better than your Ford Focus,” I said, referring to her six-year-old car, which has spent a part of every year in repair service.\n\nWe both laughed.\n\nNuts & Bolts 2007 Infiniti M45 Sport\n\nComplaint: The lane-departure warning system is an option that should be avoided. It is more annoying than it is protective with its incessant chirping. It becomes maddening on roads under repair or reconstruction where lane markings are redundant or poorly drawn.\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: Excellent in all three categories. The M45 Sport is one of the hottest dark horses in the luxury-car race — wonderfully quick off the mark, steady as all get-out at highway speeds, and nimble and responsive in curves and accident-avoidance maneuvers. In short, it’s remarkably graceful for a car weighing 4,032 pounds.\n\nHead-turning quotient: Bold, deliberately masculine and sinewy.\n\nBody style/layout: The Infiniti M45 Sport is a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive, mid-size luxury sport sedan that sits at the top of Infiniti’s M-series line. Other models include the M45 Base, M35 Base, M35 Sport and the all-wheel-drive M3 X. There is no all-wheel-drive version of the M45 at this writing.\n\nEngine/transmission: The M45 Sport comes with a 4.5-liter (thus the “M45” moniker) V-8 engine that develops 325 horsepower at 6,400 revolutions per minute and 336 foot-pounds of torque at 4,000 rpm. The engine is linked to a five-speed automatic transmission that also can be shifted manually.\n\nCapacities: There is seating for five. Maximum cargo capacity is 15 cubic feet. The fuel tank holds 20 gallons of required premium unleaded gasoline.\n\nMileage: We averaged 23 miles per gallon in highway travel — not exactly award-winning fuel economy, especially at premium gasoline prices.\n\nSafety: Electronic stability and traction control are standard, as are four-wheel antilock brakes, side and head air bags.\n\nPrice: Base price on the 2007 Infiniti M45 Sport is $50,500. Dealer’s invoice price on base model is $36,438. Price as tested is $53,570, including $2,500 in options (navigation system, backup camera, lane departure warning system and XM Satellite Radio) and a $700 destination charge.",

      "expert_review": "A car that’s a few years into its current design is usually beginning to show its age, especially when it has as many serious competitors as Infiniti’s M sedan does. The M outpaces that trend: The 2006 original took the field by storm and, relatively speaking, today’s car is eight-tenths as terrific. In a segment whose players’ strengths vary across many fronts — performance, technology, quality, reliability — the M emerges a competent choice across the board.\n\nInfiniti sells two variants, the V-6 M35 and the V-8 M45. All-wheel-drive versions of both are also available, dubbed M35x and M45x. Ever since the brand dropped the larger Q45, the M has become its de facto flagship. As such, it’s enjoyed frequent updates to stay competitive. The 2009 model sports an upgraded V-6 drivetrain, while the V-8 carries over with minimal differences. Click here to see a comparison with the 2008 model, whose review serves as the basis for this one.\n\nI tested an ’09 M35x, though I’ve also driven a 2008 M35 and 2006 M45.\n\nGoing & Stopping\nThe M35 should be fine for most drivers, as Infiniti tuned its V-6 this year for more high-revving horsepower — an impressive 303 hp, to be exact — but less torque, which is the low-end grunt you feel when pulling away from a stoplight. Even so, I found gobs of fluid power with no peaky bursts or sluggishness starting out, and under hard acceleration the high-pitched exhaust note should be music to any gearhead. The engine revs a bit more freely but doesn’t feel noticeably stronger than last year’s 275-hp M35, and dollar for dollar, it still provides a richer powerband than competitors like the BMW 528i or Audi A6 3.2. Even Hyundai’s 3.8-liter Genesis, an impressive bargain alternative for this segment, feels less spirited.\n\nThis year’s rear-wheel-drive M35 gets Infiniti’s new seven-speed automatic; it moves gas mileage up a few ticks versus last year’s version, which had a five-speed automatic. Other models, including the M35x I tested, carry over the five-speed. Though it’s a gear or two short of the competition, that transmission remains one of my favorites. It holds lower gears tenaciously at lower speeds, refusing the mileage bait of an early upshift while you’re still on the gas. Shifts are heard in engine pitch but rarely felt, and highway kickdown is quick and free of gear-hunting. Around town, lower gears arrive almost instinctively — accelerating out of a corner or pulling around a semi, for instance, you’re rarely caught flat-footed in a higher gear. Jaguar’s ZF automatic comes to mind in the same league, and I hope Infiniti preserved this sort of performance in the M35’s seven-speed. Every M this year gets a Drive Sport mode that holds lower gears longer for more responsiveness, but it’s hardly necessary.\n\nIf the M35 is confident, the M45 is authoritative. Don’t let the mere 22-hp difference fool you — with an extra liter of displacement, the M45’s V-8 boasts a torque peak that’s 800 rpm lower, with 74 more pounds-feet of twist. It trades the M35’s finesse for brute hang-the-tail-out power at pretty much any speed. In my brief time with the M45, years ago, I found the acceleration unmanageable at times. It would come in spurts, particularly through second and third gear, giving the car a restless feeling on city streets. If your commute involves roads that are open enough for the M45 to stretch its legs, though, it could be serious fun.\n\nThe M35x and M45x utilize an all-wheel-drive system that transfers power forward or backward electronically. It can split power from 50/50 front/rear all the way to 0/100, with all the power going to the rear wheels to optimize handling. Infiniti sums up the system’s convoluted name with the equally convoluted acronym ATTESA E-TS — which, were it an actual word, would be a great way to dump all your T’s in Scrabble.\n\nDrivetrains: M35 vs. M45\n\tM35\tM45\nEngine\t3.5-liter V-6\t4.5-liter V-8\nHorsepower (@ rpm)\t303 @ 6,800\t325 @ 6,400\nTorque (lbs.-ft. @ rpm)\t262 @ 4,800\t336 @ 4,000\nTransmissions\t7-speed auto (M35); 5-speed auto (M35x)\t5-speed auto (M45 and M45x)\nEPA gas mileage (city/hwy., mpg)\t17/25 (M35); 16/22 (M35x)\t16/21 (M45); 14/20 (M45x)\nFuel type\tPremium (recommended)\tPremium (required)\nSource: Automaker and EPA data\n\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes are standard, and the systems are identical on the M35 and M45. Last year’s M35 had a somewhat mushy pedal for this class, but the M45 I tested in 2006 had more linear braking.\n\nRide & Handling\nMidsize luxury cars run the gamut from comfortable to rigid; the M is closer to rigid, though not so much that it’s punishing to drive. My test car last year had the Sport package — which augments the four-wheel-independent suspension with sportier tuning, bigger wheels and high-performance summer tires — but ride quality was livable, and even more so in the M35x I drove this year, which had smaller wheels and regular suspension tuning. Highway road noise remains tolerable up to 75 mph — above that, wind and road noise quickly encroach — and the car’s chassis dispatches bumps with modest noise and few reverberations.\n\nIf you live near curvy roads, you’d do well to drive them in the M. The steering wheel moves with a lighter touch than in Infiniti’s smaller G37, and though it doesn’t feel as precise in prolonged bends — highway cloverleafs, curvy backroads — the turn-in precision for lane changes and most city driving is in the same league. The steering feel encourages twisty-road driving in a way a Volvo S80 or Mercedes E-Class cannot. Body roll remains well in check, and at its limits the M displays good grip and even better balance. The Sport package adds Infiniti’s Rear Active Steer, which power-adjusts the suspension hardware to angle the rear wheels slightly while the car is turning. The purported result is swifter handling. Last year’s M35 came equipped with the feature, but I couldn’t tell when the system was operating, or what benefits it added. The M never once came off as unresponsive, though, so evidently the extra hardware did its job.\n\nRear-wheel-drive models increase the M’s turning circle to 36.7 feet, as opposed to 36.1 feet with all-wheel drive. Those figures are on the tighter side of the competition.\n\nStyling & Quality\nI won’t waste much virtual ink describing the M’s styling qualities; they’re better shown in the thumbnails at right. Models with the Sport package get 19-inch alloy wheels, while others have 18-inchers.\n\nOriginally lauded for its quality relative to Infiniti’s previous efforts, the M’s cabin has held up well thus far. The dashboard rises to the windshield in steps, giving the cabin a roomy feel. Interior surfaces aren’t as sumptuous as those in the E-Class or Jaguar XF, but they’re certainly upscale enough: There are leather wrappings around the door pulls and chrome runners along the steering wheel. The cabin trim — aluminum or optional wood — is the real deal, not synthetic.\n\nAudio options range from a six-speaker, six-CD stereo to two Bose systems with eight and 14 speakers, respectively. I’ve spent the most time with the eight-speaker system, which proved rich enough for my taste. I don’t think I’d go for the top-shelf upgrade, considering it also shoehorns a bulky DVD-audio disc drive in the center console.\n\nThe navigation system’s graphics are getting a bit dated, but its layout generally wallops the competition. Users can touch the on-screen commands or any of numerous shortcut buttons to zoom in or out, move the cursor around the map, go back to the previous screen, you name it. The intersection input lets you search within a specified city — a clear advantage over systems that aggravatingly display every Third and Main in eight surrounding states.\n\nReal-time traffic uses a feed from XM’s NavTraffic subscription service to depict congestion levels with color-coded lines along the highway. It can find the quickest route to your destination based on current traffic conditions, something early real-time traffic navigation systems didn’t do. On one trip up Chicago’s Interstate 90in last year’s M35, the system reported that my route was largely congestion-free — while I sat in bumper-to-bumper traffic. I’ll note, at least, that it rarely overreported traffic. Infiniti says the feed goes from XM to all models with NavTraffic, so this would likely be an issue in any car with the system.\n\nSeating & Cargo\nFour of the M’s five seats offer ample legroom and headroom, but the bulky floor hump in back means a fifth passenger has to share foot room. The front seats have standard 10-way power adjustments, and there’s plenty of range for taller drivers. After you park, the steering wheel automatically powers upward to ease exit and entry — and does so much faster than in some of the more cantankerous steering columns in the M’s peers.\n\nMaximum cabin volume is 105.2 cubic feet, and trunk volume is 14.9 cubic feet. Like most cars in this class, the M lacks a folding backseat. There’s a center pass-thru for skis or other long items, but it’s fairly small. (If you want a car with a folding seat in this segment, try the E-Class or XF.)\n\nCabin & Cargo Compared (cu. ft.)\n\tCabin volume\tTrunk volume\nHyundai Genesis\t109.4\t15.9\nLexus GS\t109.1\t12.7\nLincoln MKS*\t105.8\t18.7\nInfiniti M\t105.2**\t14.9\nCadillac STS*\t102.9\t13.8\nBMW 5 Series\t99.1\t14.0\nAcura RL\t99.1\t13.1\nJaguar XF\t99.0\t17.7\nAudi A6\t98.0\t15.9\nVolvo S80\t98.0\t14.9\nMercedes-Benz E-Class\t97.2\t15.9\n*Does not include a standard moonroof. Volumes for other cars are listed with moonroofs.\n**103.1 cubic feet with Premium Package.\nAll data for 2009 models except 2008 Audi A6.\n\nSafety & Reliability\nIn crash tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the M earned the top possible score, Good, in both frontal and side-impact tests. Standard safety features include six airbags, with side-impact airbags for the front seats and side curtain ones for both rows, as well as four-wheel-disc antilock brakes, traction control and an electronic stability system. Front-seat occupants have active head restraints and pre-crash seat belts that cinch up during extreme braking to prepare occupants for impact. Also standard on all models are xenon headlights with an adaptive lighting system than can swivel the lights a few degrees during a turn to help illuminate corners. Last year the M35x didn’t include them standard.\n\nOpt for the Advanced Technology Package — which first requires the regular Technology Package — and you get adaptive cruise control, Preview Braking and Lane Departure Prevention. Adaptive cruise control uses a laser beam to judge the distance to the car ahead and apply modest (not full) gas or brakes to maintain a proper distance. Preview Braking uses the same lasers to sense any oncoming obstructions, including a rapidly slowing vehicle. Though it won’t actually begin braking for you, as the system in the FX crossover does, it will alert the driver with an audio chime and pre-load the brakes for sharper response.\n\nLane Departure Prevention debuted in the EX35 SUV a couple years back. It builds on the Lane Departure Warning system Infiniti has offered for two years now. Both use a camera mounted behind the windshield to pick up lane markings and warn the driver if the car is drifting astray; LDP goes one step further by applying individual brakes to nudge the car back on course. My test car didn’t have it, but I’ve used the feature in the EX and it’s pretty impressive. Contrary to its Big Brother overtones, LDP works subtly: Hit a turn signal or turn the wheel more than a couple degrees in the EX and you’ll override it. Don’t think of LDP as some kind of bowling-alley gutter bumper — it works gently but meticulously. Aside from an audible warning chime, the most you’ll notice is a slight tug on the wheel and a hint of deceleration as the brakes nudge the car back into its lane. Infiniti spokesman Kyle Bazemore told me the systems in the M and EX are identical, and both can be switched off if they prove too intrusive.\n\nReliability has proved impressive, with the M garnering top scores in Consumer Reports studies in recent years. The publication predicts the 2009 model will fare better or much better than average, depending on the variant you purchase. That’s a rating that just edges out the RL, A6 and GS and considerably beats the 5 Series, E-Class and STS.\n\nFeatures & Pricing\nThe M35 starts at $45,800, which is within range of most V-6 competitors, save the bargain-priced Genesis. It’s lavishly equipped at that, with leather upholstery, dual-zone A/C, a moonroof and power front seats with heating and cooling, all standard. That price also gets you a six-speaker, six-CD stereo with an auxiliary jack for MP3 players. The M45 starts at $52,150; besides the V-8 engine, it doesn’t add much other equipment. Both offer all-wheel drive and a Sport package, but you have to pick one or the other.\n\nOptions include heated and power-reclining rear seats, a navigation system with a backup camera, the two Bose audio systems and a backseat DVD player. Check all the boxes, and a loaded M45x — whose poor mileage incurs a $1,300 gas-guzzler tax — runs around $67,500.\n\nM in the Market\nThe M is as competitive as ever, and not just in a practical way. This car is fun — to drive, to look at, to sit in. In a field of climbing prices and checkered quality, it’s nice to see an old favorite hold up so well.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in December 2008 about the 2009 Infiniti M45. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2010, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nA car that’s a few years into its current design is usually beginning to show its age, especially when it has as many serious competitors as Infiniti’s M sedan does. The M outpaces that trend: The 2006 original took the field by storm and, relatively speaking, today’s car is eight-tenths as terrific. In a segment whose players’ strengths vary across many fronts — performance, technology, quality, reliability — the M emerges a competent choice across the board.\n\nInfiniti sells two variants, the V-6 M35 and the V-8 M45. All-wheel-drive versions of both are also available, dubbed M35x and M45x. Ever since the brand dropped the larger Q45, the M has become its de facto flagship. As such, it’s enjoyed frequent updates to stay competitive. The 2009 model sports an upgraded V-6 drivetrain, while the V-8 carries over with minimal differences. Click here to see a comparison with the 2008 model, whose review serves as the basis for this one.\n\nI tested an ’09 M35x, though I’ve also driven a 2008 M35 and 2006 M45.\n\nGoing & Stopping\nThe M35 should be fine for most drivers, as Infiniti tuned its V-6 this year for more high-revving horsepower — an impressive 303 hp, to be exact — but less torque, which is the low-end grunt you feel when pulling away from a stoplight. Even so, I found gobs of fluid power with no peaky bursts or sluggishness starting out, and under hard acceleration the high-pitched exhaust note should be music to any gearhead. The engine revs a bit more freely but doesn’t feel noticeably stronger than last year’s 275-hp M35, and dollar for dollar, it still provides a richer powerband than competitors like the BMW 528i or Audi A6 3.2. Even Hyundai’s 3.8-liter Genesis, an impressive bargain alternative for this segment, feels less spirited.\n\nThis year’s rear-wheel-drive M35 gets Infiniti’s new seven-speed automatic; it moves gas mileage up a few ticks versus last year’s version, which had a five-speed automatic. Other models, including the M35x I tested, carry over the five-speed. Though it’s a gear or two short of the competition, that transmission remains one of my favorites. It holds lower gears tenaciously at lower speeds, refusing the mileage bait of an early upshift while you’re still on the gas. Shifts are heard in engine pitch but rarely felt, and highway kickdown is quick and free of gear-hunting. Around town, lower gears arrive almost instinctively — accelerating out of a corner or pulling around a semi, for instance, you’re rarely caught flat-footed in a higher gear. Jaguar’s ZF automatic comes to mind in the same league, and I hope Infiniti preserved this sort of performance in the M35’s seven-speed. Every M this year gets a Drive Sport mode that holds lower gears longer for more responsiveness, but it’s hardly necessary.\n\nIf the M35 is confident, the M45 is authoritative. Don’t let the mere 22-hp difference fool you — with an extra liter of displacement, the M45’s V-8 boasts a torque peak that’s 800 rpm lower, with 74 more pounds-feet of twist. It trades the M35’s finesse for brute hang-the-tail-out power at pretty much any speed. In my brief time with the M45, years ago, I found the acceleration unmanageable at times. It would come in spurts, particularly through second and third gear, giving the car a restless feeling on city streets. If your commute involves roads that are open enough for the M45 to stretch its legs, though, it could be serious fun.\n\nThe M35x and M45x utilize an all-wheel-drive system that transfers power forward or backward electronically. It can split power from 50/50 front/rear all the way to 0/100, with all the power going to the rear wheels to optimize handling. Infiniti sums up the system’s convoluted name with the equally convoluted acronym ATTESA E-TS — which, were it an actual word, would be a great way to dump all your T’s in Scrabble.\n\nDrivetrains: M35 vs. M45\n\tM35\tM45\nEngine\t3.5-liter V-6\t4.5-liter V-8\nHorsepower (@ rpm)\t303 @ 6,800\t325 @ 6,400\nTorque (lbs.-ft. @ rpm)\t262 @ 4,800\t336 @ 4,000\nTransmissions\t7-speed auto (M35); 5-speed auto (M35x)\t5-speed auto (M45 and M45x)\nEPA gas mileage (city/hwy., mpg)\t17/25 (M35); 16/22 (M35x)\t16/21 (M45); 14/20 (M45x)\nFuel type\tPremium (recommended)\tPremium (required)\nSource: Automaker and EPA data\n\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes are standard, and the systems are identical on the M35 and M45. Last year’s M35 had a somewhat mushy pedal for this class, but the M45 I tested in 2006 had more linear braking.\n\nRide & Handling\nMidsize luxury cars run the gamut from comfortable to rigid; the M is closer to rigid, though not so much that it’s punishing to drive. My test car last year had the Sport package — which augments the four-wheel-independent suspension with sportier tuning, bigger wheels and high-performance summer tires — but ride quality was livable, and even more so in the M35x I drove this year, which had smaller wheels and regular suspension tuning. Highway road noise remains tolerable up to 75 mph — above that, wind and road noise quickly encroach — and the car’s chassis dispatches bumps with modest noise and few reverberations.\n\nIf you live near curvy roads, you’d do well to drive them in the M. The steering wheel moves with a lighter touch than in Infiniti’s smaller G37, and though it doesn’t feel as precise in prolonged bends — highway cloverleafs, curvy backroads — the turn-in precision for lane changes and most city driving is in the same league. The steering feel encourages twisty-road driving in a way a Volvo S80 or Mercedes E-Class cannot. Body roll remains well in check, and at its limits the M displays good grip and even better balance. The Sport package adds Infiniti’s Rear Active Steer, which power-adjusts the suspension hardware to angle the rear wheels slightly while the car is turning. The purported result is swifter handling. Last year’s M35 came equipped with the feature, but I couldn’t tell when the system was operating, or what benefits it added. The M never once came off as unresponsive, though, so evidently the extra hardware did its job.\n\nRear-wheel-drive models increase the M’s turning circle to 36.7 feet, as opposed to 36.1 feet with all-wheel drive. Those figures are on the tighter side of the competition.\n\nStyling & Quality\nI won’t waste much virtual ink describing the M’s styling qualities; they’re better shown in the thumbnails at right. Models with the Sport package get 19-inch alloy wheels, while others have 18-inchers.\n\nOriginally lauded for its quality relative to Infiniti’s previous efforts, the M’s cabin has held up well thus far. The dashboard rises to the windshield in steps, giving the cabin a roomy feel. Interior surfaces aren’t as sumptuous as those in the E-Class or Jaguar XF, but they’re certainly upscale enough: There are leather wrappings around the door pulls and chrome runners along the steering wheel. The cabin trim — aluminum or optional wood — is the real deal, not synthetic.\n\nAudio options range from a six-speaker, six-CD stereo to two Bose systems with eight and 14 speakers, respectively. I’ve spent the most time with the eight-speaker system, which proved rich enough for my taste. I don’t think I’d go for the top-shelf upgrade, considering it also shoehorns a bulky DVD-audio disc drive in the center console.\n\nThe navigation system’s graphics are getting a bit dated, but its layout generally wallops the competition. Users can touch the on-screen commands or any of numerous shortcut buttons to zoom in or out, move the cursor around the map, go back to the previous screen, you name it. The intersection input lets you search within a specified city — a clear advantage over systems that aggravatingly display every Third and Main in eight surrounding states.\n\nReal-time traffic uses a feed from XM’s NavTraffic subscription service to depict congestion levels with color-coded lines along the highway. It can find the quickest route to your destination based on current traffic conditions, something early real-time traffic navigation systems didn’t do. On one trip up Chicago’s Interstate 90in last year’s M35, the system reported that my route was largely congestion-free — while I sat in bumper-to-bumper traffic. I’ll note, at least, that it rarely overreported traffic. Infiniti says the feed goes from XM to all models with NavTraffic, so this would likely be an issue in any car with the system.\n\nSeating & Cargo\nFour of the M’s five seats offer ample legroom and headroom, but the bulky floor hump in back means a fifth passenger has to share foot room. The front seats have standard 10-way power adjustments, and there’s plenty of range for taller drivers. After you park, the steering wheel automatically powers upward to ease exit and entry — and does so much faster than in some of the more cantankerous steering columns in the M’s peers.\n\nMaximum cabin volume is 105.2 cubic feet, and trunk volume is 14.9 cubic feet. Like most cars in this class, the M lacks a folding backseat. There’s a center pass-thru for skis or other long items, but it’s fairly small. (If you want a car with a folding seat in this segment, try the E-Class or XF.)\n\nCabin & Cargo Compared (cu. ft.)\n\tCabin volume\tTrunk volume\nHyundai Genesis\t109.4\t15.9\nLexus GS\t109.1\t12.7\nLincoln MKS*\t105.8\t18.7\nInfiniti M\t105.2**\t14.9\nCadillac STS*\t102.9\t13.8\nBMW 5 Series\t99.1\t14.0\nAcura RL\t99.1\t13.1\nJaguar XF\t99.0\t17.7\nAudi A6\t98.0\t15.9\nVolvo S80\t98.0\t14.9\nMercedes-Benz E-Class\t97.2\t15.9\n*Does not include a standard moonroof. Volumes for other cars are listed with moonroofs.\n**103.1 cubic feet with Premium Package.\nAll data for 2009 models except 2008 Audi A6.\n\nSafety & Reliability\nIn crash tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the M earned the top possible score, Good, in both frontal and side-impact tests. Standard safety features include six airbags, with side-impact airbags for the front seats and side curtain ones for both rows, as well as four-wheel-disc antilock brakes, traction control and an electronic stability system. Front-seat occupants have active head restraints and pre-crash seat belts that cinch up during extreme braking to prepare occupants for impact. Also standard on all models are xenon headlights with an adaptive lighting system than can swivel the lights a few degrees during a turn to help illuminate corners. Last year the M35x didn’t include them standard.\n\nOpt for the Advanced Technology Package — which first requires the regular Technology Package — and you get adaptive cruise control, Preview Braking and Lane Departure Prevention. Adaptive cruise control uses a laser beam to judge the distance to the car ahead and apply modest (not full) gas or brakes to maintain a proper distance. Preview Braking uses the same lasers to sense any oncoming obstructions, including a rapidly slowing vehicle. Though it won’t actually begin braking for you, as the system in the FX crossover does, it will alert the driver with an audio chime and pre-load the brakes for sharper response.\n\nLane Departure Prevention debuted in the EX35 SUV a couple years back. It builds on the Lane Departure Warning system Infiniti has offered for two years now. Both use a camera mounted behind the windshield to pick up lane markings and warn the driver if the car is drifting astray; LDP goes one step further by applying individual brakes to nudge the car back on course. My test car didn’t have it, but I’ve used the feature in the EX and it’s pretty impressive. Contrary to its Big Brother overtones, LDP works subtly: Hit a turn signal or turn the wheel more than a couple degrees in the EX and you’ll override it. Don’t think of LDP as some kind of bowling-alley gutter bumper — it works gently but meticulously. Aside from an audible warning chime, the most you’ll notice is a slight tug on the wheel and a hint of deceleration as the brakes nudge the car back into its lane. Infiniti spokesman Kyle Bazemore told me the systems in the M and EX are identical, and both can be switched off if they prove too intrusive.\n\nReliability has proved impressive, with the M garnering top scores in Consumer Reports studies in recent years. The publication predicts the 2009 model will fare better or much better than average, depending on the variant you purchase. That’s a rating that just edges out the RL, A6 and GS and considerably beats the 5 Series, E-Class and STS.\n\nFeatures & Pricing\nThe M35 starts at $45,800, which is within range of most V-6 competitors, save the bargain-priced Genesis. It’s lavishly equipped at that, with leather upholstery, dual-zone A/C, a moonroof and power front seats with heating and cooling, all standard. That price also gets you a six-speaker, six-CD stereo with an auxiliary jack for MP3 players. The M45 starts at $52,150; besides the V-8 engine, it doesn’t add much other equipment. Both offer all-wheel drive and a Sport package, but you have to pick one or the other.\n\nOptions include heated and power-reclining rear seats, a navigation system with a backup camera, the two Bose audio systems and a backseat DVD player. Check all the boxes, and a loaded M45x — whose poor mileage incurs a $1,300 gas-guzzler tax — runs around $67,500.\n\nM in the Market\nThe M is as competitive as ever, and not just in a practical way. This car is fun — to drive, to look at, to sit in. In a field of climbing prices and checkered quality, it’s nice to see an old favorite hold up so well.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "A car that’s two years into its current design is usually beginning to show its age, especially when it has as many serious competitors as Infiniti’s M sedan does. The M outpaces that trend: The 2006 original took the field by storm, and today’s car is nine-tenths as terrific. In a segment whose players’ strengths vary across many fronts — performance, technology, quality, reliability — the M emerges a competent choice across the board.\n\nInfiniti sells two variants, the V-6 M35 and the V-8 M45. All-wheel-drive versions of both are also available, dubbed M35x and M45x. Ever since the brand dropped the larger Q45, the M has become its de facto flagship. As such, it’s enjoyed frequent updates to stay competitive. The 2008 model sports revised styling and a handful of new technologies. Click here to see a comparison with the 2007 model.\n\nThis review covers an M35, though I’ve also driven the M45.\n\nGoing & Stopping\nThe M35 should be fine for most drivers. Its V-6 churns out fluid power with no peaky bursts or low-end sluggishness, and under hard acceleration its high-pitched whine should be music to any gearhead. Credit the engine, a longtime award winner from Infiniti parent Nissan. Dollar for dollar, the M35 provides a far richer powerband than competitors like the BMW 528i or Audi A6 3.2.\n\nThough the M’s five-speed automatic is a gear or two short of the competition, it works just as well, if not better. It holds lower gears tenaciously at lower speeds, refusing the mileage bait of an early upshift while you’re still on the gas. Shifts are heard in engine pitch but rarely felt, and highway kickdown is quick and free of gear-hunting. Around town, lower gears arrive almost instinctively — accelerating out of a corner or pulling around a semi, for instance, you’re rarely caught flat-footed in a higher gear. Jaguar’s ZF automatic comes to mind in the same league, and I hope Infiniti preserves this sort of performance in its upcoming seven-speed automatic.\n\nIf the M35 is confident, the M45 is authoritative. Don’t let the mere 50-horsepower difference fool you — with an extra liter of displacement, the M45’s V-8 boasts a torque peak that’s 800 rpm lower, with 68 more pounds-feet of twist. It trades the M35’s finesse for brute hang-the-tail-out power at pretty much any speed. In my brief time with the M45 — it was a 2006 model — I found the acceleration unmanageable at times. It would come in spurts, particularly through second and third gear, giving the car a restless feeling on city streets. If your commute involves roads that are open enough for the M45 to stretch its legs, though, it could be serious fun.\n\nThe M35x and M45x utilize an all-wheel-drive system that transfers power forward or backward electronically. It can split power from 50/50 front/rear all the way to 0/100, with all the power going to the rear wheels to optimize handling. Infiniti sums up the system’s convoluted name with the equally convoluted acronym ATTESA E-TS — which, were it an actual word, would be a great way to dump all your T’s in Scrabble.\n\nDrivetrains: M35 vs. M45\n\tM35\tM45\nEngine\t3.5-liter V-6\t4.5-liter V-8\nHorsepower (@ rpm)\t275 @ 6,200\t325 @ 6,400\nTorque (lbs.-ft. @ rpm)\t268 @ 4,800\t336 @ 4,000\nTransmission\t5-speed automatic\t5-speed automatic\nEPA gas mileage\t16/23 (M35); 16/22 (M35x)\t16/21 (M45); 14/20 (M45x)\nFuel type\tPremium (recommended)\tPremium (required)\nSource: Automaker data, EPA\n\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes are standard, and the systems are identical on the M35 and M45. My test car’s brakes felt a bit mushy at first but clamped down later on. The M45 I drove in 2006 had more linear braking.\n\nRide & Handling\nMidsize luxury cars run the gamut from comfortable to rigid; the M is closer to rigid, though not so much that it’s punishing to drive. Despite my test car having the Sport package — which augments the four-wheel-independent suspension with sportier tuning, bigger wheels and high-performance summer tires — ride quality was livable. Highway road noise remains tolerable up to 75 mph — above that, wind and road noise quickly encroach — and the car’s chassis dispatches bumps with modest noise and few reverberations.\n\nIf you live near curvy roads you’d do well to drive them in the M. The steering wheel moves with a lighter touch than in Infiniti’s smaller G35, and though it doesn’t feel as precise in prolonged bends — highway cloverleafs, curvy backroads — the turn-in precision for lane changes and most city driving is in the same league. All told, the steering feel encourages twisty-road driving in a way a Volvo S80 or Mercedes E-Class cannot. Body roll remains well in check, and at its limits the M displays good grip and even better balance. The Sport package adds Infiniti’s Rear Active Steer, which power-adjusts the suspension hardware to angle the rear wheels slightly while the car is turning. The purported result is swifter handling. I couldn’t tell when the system was operating — or what benefits it added — but the M never once came off as unresponsive, so evidently it did its job.\n\nNaturally, models without the Sport package probably display different ride and handling characteristics. All-wheel-drive models increase the M’s turning circle to 36.7 feet, as opposed to 36.1 feet with rear-wheel drive. Those figures are right on par with the competition. The rear-wheel-drive Lexus GS carves the narrowest circle, at 34.1 feet, while the V-8 Volvo S80 trails the segment at 40.0 feet.\n\nStyling & Quality\nI won’t waste much virtual ink describing the M’s styling revisions; they’re better shown in the thumbnails at right. Suffice it to say the M looks much like it did before, though certain elements now recall the redesigned G35. Models with the Sport package get 19-inch alloy wheels, while others have 18-inchers.\n\nOriginally lauded for its quality compared with Infiniti’s previous efforts, the M’s cabin has held up well thus far. Interior surfaces aren’t as sumptuous as those in the E-Class or Jaguar XF, but the dashboard rises to the windshield in steps, giving the cabin a much roomier feel than either car. Materials quality keeps with the competition: There are leather wrappings around the door pulls and chrome runners along the steering wheel. The cabin trim — aluminum or optional wood — is the real deal, not synthetic.\n\nAudio options range from a six-speaker, six-CD stereo to two Bose systems with eight and 14 speakers, respectively. My test car had the eight-speaker system, which proved rich enough for my taste; I don’t think I’d go for the top-shelf upgrade.\n\nThe navigation system’s graphics are getting a bit dated, but its layout generally wallops the competition. Users can touch the on-screen commands or any of numerous shortcut buttons to zoom in or out, move the cursor around the map, go back to the previous screen, you name it. The intersection input lets you search within a specified city, a clear advantage over systems that aggravatingly display every 3rd and Main in eight surrounding states.\n\nReal-time traffic uses a feed from XM’s NavTraffic subscription service to depict congestion levels with color-coded lines along the highway. It can find the quickest route to your destination based on current traffic conditions, something early real-time traffic navigation systems didn’t do. On one trip up Chicago’s Kennedy expressway, the system reported that my route was largely congestion-free — while I sat in bumper-to-bumper traffic. I’ll note, at least, that it rarely overreported traffic. Infiniti says the feed goes from XM to all models with NavTraffic, so this would likely be an issue in any car with the system.\n\nSeating & Cargo\nFour of the M’s five seats offer ample legroom and headroom, but the bulky floor hump in back means a fifth passenger has to share foot room. The front seats have standard 10-way power adjustments, and there’s plenty of range for taller drivers. After you park, the steering wheel automatically powers upward to ease exit and entry — and does so much faster than in some of the M’s crankier peers.\n\nMaximum cabin volume is 105.2 cubic feet, and trunk volume is 14.9 cubic feet. Like most other cars in this class, the M lacks a folding backseat. There’s a center pass-thru for skis or other long items, but it’s fairly small. (If you want a car with a folding seat in this segment, try the E-Class or XF.)\n\nCabin & Cargo Compared\n\tCabin volume (cu. ft.)\tTrunk volume (cu. ft.)\nLexus GS\t109.1\t12.7\nLincoln MKS*\t105.9\t18.4\nInfiniti M\t103.1 – 105.2**\t14.9\nCadillac STS*\t102.9\t13.8\nBMW 5 Series\t99.1\t14.0\nAcura RL\t99.1\t13.1\nJaguar XF\t99.0\t17.7\nVolvo S80\t99.0\t14.9\nMercedes E-Class\t97.2\t15.9\nAudi A6\t96.2\t15.9\n*Models do not include standard moonroofs.

Standard safety features include six airbags, with side-impact airbags for the front seats and side curtain ones for both rows, as well as four-wheel-disc antilock brakes, traction control and an electronic stability system. Front-seat occupants have active head restraints and pre-crash seat belts that cinch up during extreme braking to prepare occupants for impact. Standard on all but the M35x are xenon headlights with an adaptive lighting system than can swivel the lights a few degrees during a turn to help illuminate corners.\n\nOpt for the Advanced Technology Package — which first requires the regular Technology Package — and you get adaptive cruise control, Preview Braking and Lane Departure Prevention. Adaptive cruise control uses a laser beam to judge the distance to the car ahead and apply modest (not full) gas or brakes to maintain a proper distance. Preview Braking uses the same lasers to sense any oncoming obstructions, including a rapidly slowing vehicle. Though it won’t actually begin braking, as the system in the 2009 FX does, it will alert the driver with an audio chime and pre-load the brakes for sharper response.\n\nLane Departure Prevention debuted in the EX35 SUV in 2007. It builds on the Lane Departure Warning system Infiniti has offered for two years now. Both use a camera mounted behind the windshield to pick up lane markings and warn the driver if the car is drifting astray; LDP goes one step further by applying individual brakes to nudge the car back on course. My test car didn’t have it, but I’ve used the feature in the EX and it’s pretty impressive. Contrary to its Big Brother overtones, LDP works subtly: Hit a turn signal or turn the wheel more than a couple degrees in the EX and you’ll override it. Don’t think of LDP as some kind of bowling-alley gutter bumper — it works gently but meticulously. Aside from an audible warning chime, the most you’ll notice is a slight tug on the wheel and a hint of deceleration as the brakes nudge the car back into its lane. Infiniti spokesman Kyle Bazemore told me the systems in the M and EX are identical, and both can be switched off if they prove too intrusive.\n\nReliability has proved impressive. In Consumer Reports studies, the 2006 and 2007 M35 and M45 garnered top scores. The publication predicts the 2008 model will fare much better than average — a rating that just edges out the RL, GS and A6 and considerably beats the 5 Series, E-Class and STS.\n\nFeatures & Pricing\nWithout the destination charge, the M35 starts at $43,900, which is within range of most V-6 competitors. It’s lavishly equipped at that, with leather upholstery, dual-zone A/C, a moonroof, and power front seats with heating and cooling, all standard. That price also gets you a six-speaker, six-CD stereo with an auxiliary jack for MP3 players. The M45 starts at $50,250; besides the V-8 engine, it doesn’t add much other equipment. Both offer all-wheel drive and a Sport package, but you have to pick one or the other.\n\nOptions include heated and power-reclining rear seats, a navigation system with a backup camera, the two Bose audio systems and a backseat DVD player. Check all the boxes, and a loaded M45x runs around $64,000.\n\nM in the Market\nThe M is as competitive as ever, and not just in a practical way. This car is fun — to drive, to look at, to sit in. In a field of climbing prices and checkered quality, it’s nice to see an old favorite hold up so well.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",
