      "expert_review": "Infiniti’s line-wide model-name shakeup continues to confuse, so allow me to reintroduce you to the new QX56. Redesigned for 2011 and renamed for 2014, Infiniti’s flagship SUV now goes by the name QX80. This V-8-powered beast comes in rear- or all-wheel drive and offers loads of passenger room, with seating for seven or eight across three rows of seats.\n\nPassengers in a 2014 Infiniti QX80 will arrive in comfort and style thanks to a roomy cabin loaded with premium goodies, but this SUV’s limited cargo room and its hearty appetite for premium fuel don’t impress us.\n\nAside from its new name, the QX80 carries over without any significant changes this year. See both model years compared here. Other vehicles in this class include the Cadillac Escalade, Lexus LX 570 and Mercedes-Benz GL-Class. Compare them all here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThis is a truck for those who want to be noticed. While it doesn’t quite offer Cadillac Escalade-levels of eye candy, the king-sized QX80 shows off plenty of bling, with its enormous chrome grille and its trio of rectangular vent ports.\n\nBut, in the words of Shania Twain, “That don’t impress me much.” If you, too, aren’t wowed by over-the-top flash, the QX80’s overall look will likely strike you as more awkward than graceful thanks to plenty of shiny bits, a protruding nose and a squared-off rear end. The Infiniti QX80 is as strange and ungainly looking as the rest of Infiniti’s lineup is elegant and classy.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe strong 400-horsepower, 5.6-liter V-8 moves the hulking, 5,500-plus-pound SUV without strain; in fact, you can barely hear it. The engine is nicely muted and the entire cabin is well insulated from road and wind noise. Overall, the seven-speed automatic delivered smooth and responsive shifts that made for confident passing and merging, but it did hunt for gears on occasion.\n\nYou’ll pay dearly for that power, however. Both two- and all-wheel-drive QX80s are EPA rated at 14/20/16 mpg city/highway/combined, and premium fuel is recommended. Dismal fuel economy isn’t just an Infiniti problem; the new two-wheel-drive 2015 Cadillac Escalade (15/21/17 mpg) and V-8-powered versions of the GL-Class (14/19/16 mpg) are comparable; the Lexus LX 570 brings up the rear with 12/17/14 mpg.\n\nThe Infiniti QX80 is available with standard rear- or optional all-wheel drive. My test model was equipped with all-wheel drive. It felt solid and stable on snowy roads, easily plowing through winter’s road sludge. The ride overall felt comfortably soft — until you hit broken pavement. Smaller bumps were absorbed well, but the QX80 had a tendency to float over larger ones. It felt much more composed, however, than the Lexus LX 570’s body-on-frame truck-like ride.\n\nAlthough I was comfortable powering through snow- and ice-packed roads, the steering didn’t quite inspire confidence. It felt too light and twitchy at highway speeds on dry pavement, requiring constant minor corrections. Maneuverability overall is a high point, however. At low speeds, the steering was nicely weighted with good feedback. I’d never call it nimble, but the QX80 feels more agile than a lot of vehicles its size. Parking was less challenging than expected thanks to clear rear sight lines (as long as the third-row head restraints are down), enormous side mirrors and a backup camera with parking guides, supplemented by an Around View Monitor.\n\nInterior\nThe Infiniti QX80 is a beast outside and nothing short of cavernous inside. Once you figure out how to launch yourself over the enormously high step-in, you’ll never want to leave those front seats. The first and second rows are trimmed in posh semi-aniline leather and high-quality materials for a design that’s tasteful but understated — seemingly at odds with its ostentatious exterior styling.\n\nReal wood panels and aluminum trim are blended together for an elegant effect. Every other surface is padded, and the panels are well-fitted. The seats are easily among the most comfortable I’ve experienced; they could be straight out of a spa — extra wide and wonderfully comfy. All that’s missing is a recliner. All this loveliness isn’t just for the first row; second-row passengers are treated to the same level of luxury, with loads of headroom and legroom; plush, cozy bucket seats; plenty of storage bins; and lots of available extras, including a dual-screen entertainment system and heated seats, both optional. Second-row bucket seats are standard, but a three-seat bench is available.\n\nThird-row passengers get short shrift, however. The bench seat is hard and flat, and even small adults will not fit comfortably back there; both headroom and legroom are in short supply. With 28.8 inches of third-row legroom, the QX80 trails the GL-Class (35) but bests the LX 570 (28.3) and Escalade (24.8).\n\nThe second row can’t share legroom, either. Although the touch of an automatic button tumbles the second-row’s bucket seats forward for easy third-row access, the seats don’t slide forward and back. Parents with kids in child-safety seats should take note: Because a giant center console sits between the buckets, third row access is blocked when child seats are installed. Click here to read how compatible the Infiniti QX80 is with smaller children and see more details in the Safety section below.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nInfiniti’s multimedia system uses an appealing blend of physical controls and touch-screen functionality, often giving users a choice between the two. The touch-screen is easy to use for audio and navigation tasks; the map and destination menus make sense, and most tasks require only a few steps. Additional audio knobs and buttons are convenient if you’d rather not use the screen. Even better, all climate controls are physical knobs and buttons that have not been absorbed by the multimedia system.\n\nBoth rows have plenty of connectivity options, with several USB and auxiliary input ports in the first and second rows. Four 12-volt DC power outlets are standard; one AC power outlet is optional. \n\nCargo & Storage\nHere’s where things stop making sense. In terms of small-items storage, the QX80 is a champ, with loads of cubbies, bins and cupholders for the first and second rows. Behind the third row, however, space is paltry. The cargo area was clearly an afterthought: For such a honkin’ vehicle, there’s not a lot of usable space when the third row is up. In fact, many subcompact cars offer more cargo space than the QX80’s 16.6 cubic feet, including the teeny-tiny Mitsubishi Mirage (17.2 cubic feet). Again, it’s not just an Infiniti problem. Lots of large three-row SUVs get an F for cargo capacity, including the Escalade (15.3), LX 570 (15.5) and GL-Class (16 cubic feet). \n\nThe numbers look much better once the third row goes down. It folds in a 60/40 split via two cargo-area buttons. With it flat, space jumps to a respectable 49.6 cubic feet, besting the LX 570 (41.0) and GL-Class (49.4) but falling behind the Escalade (51.6 cubic feet).\n\nSafety\nLike most full-size SUVs, the 2014 Infiniti QX80 hasn’t been crash-tested by either the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nThe helpful Around View Monitor, which offers a view of all sides, as if from above the SUV, is standard, and Infiniti offers a ton of optional safety equipment available in a $3,250 Technology Package, including Intelligent Brake Assist with Forward Collision Warning and Backup Collision Warning, as well as Backup Collision Intervention. The latter is a new system that will automatically engage the brakes in an impending backup collision. Other systems include Blind Spot Warning and Blind Spot Intervention, Lane Departure Warning and Lane Departure Prevention. Click here for a full list of safety features.\n\nAlthough the Infiniti QX80 offers loads of second-row passenger room, it didn’t perform as well as expected when it came to accommodating child-safety seats. Click here to read our Car Seat Check.\n\nValue in Its Class\nRear-wheel-drive versions of the 2014 Infiniti QX80 start at $63,545; all-wheel drive brings the total to $66,645. Competitors start much higher, especially the Escalade ($72,690 in rear-wheel-drive trim) and the all-wheel-drive-only LX 570 ($83,540); all prices include destination charges. The QX80 is well-equipped, too, with luxury standards like remote start, a moonroof, a power liftgate, navigation, rear climate control, a heated steering wheel and leather seats.\n\nLarge families looking for luxury, passenger room and towing capacity (it’s rated for 8,500 pounds) will feel right at home in the Infiniti QX80’s king-sized first and second rows. Its lack of cargo room could be a problem, however, and its price tag quickly becomes hard to swallow. Now we know where the “80” comes from: While it starts lower than many SUVs in its body-type class, my test version came very close to hitting $80,000 thanks to expensive safety and convenience packages. Sure, it delivers the bells and whistles, but you’ll have to shell out a lot to get them.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Stable gas prices have given new life to full-size luxury SUVs, the top tier of traditional, truck-based SUVs that let well-off families haul people and cargo in style, as well as tow their other big toys. For 2018, Infiniti has kept what’s been attractive about its QX80 since a 2011 update and given the aging SUV some needed upgrades.\n\nThe QX80 is still big and brash, befitting its place in the automotive food chain. The updated look, though, is less polarizing, and the previous version’s ride and noise issues have been tamed, making for a smoother and quieter SUV. The technology is improved, too, though not as much as was needed. Meanwhile, Infiniti didn’t tinker with what has worked for the QX80: competitive power and handling versus other extra-extra-large luxury SUVs, along with a relatively value price.\n\nMore Upright, Less Distinctive\n\nThe imposing new front end is more upright and squared off — and much less eccentric — than the rounded sculpting of the 2017 model and its distinctive low headlights and high grille. The 2018 gets a much more “open wide” version of the Infiniti grille, plus new headlights with LED eyebrows that sit higher and stretch around the corners. Infiniti says everything forward of the windshield is new. The rear changes are less dramatic, but the 2018 does get thinner LED taillights and chrome trim. Familiar from the outgoing model are the slab sides, horizontal roofline and signature crescent-shaped rear pillar — a look shared with its cousins, the Nissan Armada and Nissan Patrol, which is sold globally. The changes are subtle, but they make for a more upscale presence.\n\nMuscle With a Price\n\nInfiniti kept the burly 5.6-liter V-8 that puts out 400 horsepower and 413 pounds-feet of torque. Mated to a seven-speed automatic, it goes about its business competently and unobtrusively, with plenty of power to move the nearly three-ton SUV. Infiniti says it goes from zero-to-60 mph in 7.5 seconds, and I found it feels even stronger when already underway, with confident passing and on-ramp acceleration. It does it all with a satisfying growl from the big V-8. \n\nYou have to pay to play, though. The EPA rating is on the lower side of this fuel-gulping class: 14/20/16 mpg city/highway/combined with rear-wheel drive, 13/19/15 mpg with all-wheel drive. Compare to a sample of the competition here. \n\nTo put that in further perspective, the QX80’s AWD rating is the same as that of the fire-breathing 2018 Dodge Durango SRT SUV, which sprints to 60 mph in 4.4 seconds.\n\nRear-wheel drive is standard, but more than half of QX80 buyers choose the optional rear-biased all-wheel drive. The full-time system operates automatically, with a computer shifting power to the wheels with more traction. The Infiniti’s four-wheel-drive system is aided by brake-based traction control. The system also offers locked-in high and low settings that split torque 50/50 between the front and rear axles for specific conditions — 4-High for light conditions, 4-Low for tougher situations. We weren’t able to test the latter, but I suspect most buyers won’t be climbing rocks, either.\n\nSuspension tweaks for 2018 have greatly improved the ride over the outgoing model. The shocks were retuned, and Infiniti worked to provide more sidewall compliance from the tires — even those fitted to the optional 22-inch wheels. The resulting ride is still a little firmer than some big SUVs, but it feels confident. You’ll be aware of road imperfections and expansion joints, but they aren’t jarring as they were in the past. The ride in my test vehicle was further enhanced by the optional Hydraulic Body Motion Control suspension (included in a $5,700 diverse Deluxe Technology Package that also includes nicer leather, advanced climate control and a video rearview mirror). It proved effective in controlling lean-in in corners, as well as motion under hard braking or acceleration. The QX80 never felt top-heavy, at least for this type of SUV. \n\nWhile the ride is firm, the QX80’s handling continues to be above the norm for such a big SUV. Not a few of its competitors are floaty and boaty; by contrast, the QX80 drives smaller than it is. The steering is too light at speed, requiring little correction, but is generally responsive. The brakes have a firm, linear response, but they could pull the big truck down with more authority.\n\nTowing and hauling capabilities are selling points for full-size, truck-based SUVs over crossovers with comparable luxury and people space. The QX80 can tow up to 8,500 pounds and has an auto-leveling rear suspension to keep things even when you load up the 95.1 cubic feet of maximum cargo space behind the front row. If you need all three rows for seating, there’s still a useful 16.6 cubic feet of space behind the back row. The QX80 comes in just one size; there is no stretched version like the Cadillac Escalade ESV or Lincoln Navigator L, which add more cargo space behind the seating area.\n\nA Quiet Upgrade in Luxury\n\nThe QX80’s interior has changed less than its exterior, but there is a slightly more modern look for the dashboard. There are also design and materials upgrades, including high-quality leather (semi-aniline is optional) and real wood trim in the first two rows, an additional available color scheme and very nice execution of the quilt stitching that’s trendy in luxury vehicles. Good news for families is that, for 2018, the leather upholstery has a stain-resistant coating that also resists dye transfer, such as from denim jeans.\n\nThe QX80 has standard second-row captain’s chairs and seating for seven; with an optional split-folding bench seat for the second row, it can seat eight. With the captain’s chairs, the second row gets its own center console with a big covered bin, cupholders and a second, lower cubby to stash gear. The console is handy, though it takes up that between-the-seats space that provides an alternative avenue to the third row.\n\nThe front seats are big, supportive and comfortable for a long day of driving, as are the second-row buckets. The driving position is high and commanding; you’ll need the standard (and wider for 2018) running boards and grab handles to get up there gracefully.\n\nThe second-row buckets tip forward (power tilting is optional) for access to the third row, which is tighter than you’d expect given the QX80’s size. You sit low with your knees high in the back row, though a power recline helps you get comfortable and headroom is ample for taller adults. The second-row seats don’t slide to allow for more legroom compromise with the third row. While the QX80 is admirably consistent in quality of materials from the first row into the second, the third row gets hard plastic trim and no fancy quilting for the leather. There are no reading lights or power ports, either, though there is a 12-volt outlet behind the seat in the cargo area. The third row power folds to open up more cargo space.\n\nOne of the most significant improvements to the interior, however, is not about what you see but rather what you don’t hear. Cars.com editors consistently faulted earlier models for a noisier and busier interior than many rivals; for 2018, Infiniti added more sound insulation behind the dashboard and in the cargo area, as well as beefed-up carpeting. To my ear, the improvements result in a noticeably quieter, less fatiguing cabin, adding to the luxury feel.\n\nA nit to pick: The front seat heat/ventilation knobs offer no indication they’re on save for a tiny light you can barely see during the day.\n\nTech Modernized, Not Quite Modern\n\nThe revised dashboard still looks somewhat old-school. It has a prominent central bulge — that’s an Infiniti thing — and is busy with buttons and knobs for the controls and multimedia as well as the 8-inch touchscreen. The screen got needed higher resolution and better graphics, but it’s still not close to the crispness and show-stopping graphic designs now appearing on big screens in the latest-generation German and American luxury SUVs. Menus are improved and more intuitive, however, and Infiniti offers you a choice of using the touchscreen or its old-school dashboard knob-and-button controller to navigate the system. I will admit those physical controls were handy for letting passengers use some functions, such as navigation entry, that are blocked on the touchscreen while the SUV is under way. And you’ll still have a CD player handy in the QX80.\n\nThe QX80 does not offer a configurable digital instrument cluster like those now commonly available on high-end SUVs. The oldest-looking touch, though, is the monochrome driver information display between the gauges. Still, the large, easy-to-find buttons on the gauge hood proved easier to find and more intuitive to use than more complicated systems. On balance, for me, ease of use trumped a fancier look. But why should we have to choose?\n\nHarder to live with over time would be the lack of Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration, if only for their continuously updated maps. Smartphone integration is migrating down to some of the cheapest cars, and buyers are coming to expect it as they would Bluetooth pairing and power ports. The 2018 QX80 does have an enlarged “phablet-size” phone cubby in the front near a pair of USB ports, but it’s shallow, and its hard plastic lets big phones jiggle. The lack of available wireless charging is a notable lapse for a luxury vehicle. A Bose system provides the audio.\n\nThe QX80’s second row gets a pair of new 2.4-amp USB charging ports as well as a third USB media port (for five USB ports overall). There’s also a 110-volt outlet with the available two-screen rear entertainment system. Upgraded for 2018, this system has added an HDMI port and higher-resolution 8-inch screens, up from 7 inches. They can now display separate content on each screen.\n\nSafety Tech, Driver Aids Will Cost You\n\nThe QX80 has not been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or federal regulators. Standard safety technology includes a 360-degree camera system with moving object detection, as well as front and rear parking sensors — all of which are a big help in docking this yacht.\n\nThe 2018 QX80 offers a full suite of other safety technology and driver aids, but unfortunately not as standard equipment. You have to — and should — check the box for the optional Driver Assistance Package ($2,900) to get them. But it’s a full platter, including forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking and pedestrian detection. The package also has low-speed automatic braking in reverse. It’s an excellent family feature to supplement the backup camera, and in testing, it stopped the big SUV effectively before I took out a pair of plastic trash cans not visible below the rear window.\n\nAlso in the Driver Assistance Package is adaptive cruise control, which works from 20 to 90 mph — unlike many modern systems that work to a full stop and then hold. Distance Control Assist, independent of cruise control, reacts to slowing traffic down to 1 mph with braking and resistance in the accelerator, but it won’t hold the QX80 in place until the lead car takes off. It worked for me as both a safety and fatigue assist in heavy traffic. Additional features are blind spot warning and intervention, lane departure warning and lane keep assist.\n\nBuyers may also want to opt for the newly available camera-based video rearview mirror, which we had in our test vehicle. The wide view helps compensate for the SUV’s high beltline, big back pillars, head restraints or any cargo that may cut your view to the rear, either with the standard mirror or over your shoulder. The camera is high in the rear window, putting it out of the way and leaving space for the rear wiper to clear the glass, but it also leaves a blind spot directly behind the liftgate. \n\nPriced to Sell\n\nStarting prices are up $900 from 2017, but the improvements for 2018 are worth it. The 2018 QX80 starts at $65,745 (all prices include destination charges) for a rear-wheel-drive model and $68,845 for all-wheel drive. Fully optioned, the QX80 reaches up to $83,445.\n\nThe modest price increase lets the new QX80 keep one of its key appeals: It’s a relative bargain among big luxury SUVs. A 2018 Lexus LX 570 with three rows and standard all-wheel drive, for example, starts at $91,575, and a rear-wheel-drive 2018 Cadillac Escalade starts at $75,990. Don’t even ask about a Land Rover Range Rover. The Infiniti’s newest-design rival, the 2018 Lincoln Navigator, starts at $73,250.\n\nWhile it may be a price leader in the luxury crowd, a separate question is whether this flagship from Nissan’s luxury brand merits its price premium over the related Nissan Armada full-size SUV — a premium that can reach as high as $18,000. Only you can decide whether the step up in luxury — and it’s a step up that your neighbors will notice — plus expected luxury dealer pampering is worth the added expense.

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in June 2015 about the 2015 Infiniti QX80. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2016, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nIn a far-off fantasy world where money is no object, I would buy the spacious, luxurious, plush 2015 Infiniti QX80 SUV to haul my family and our nonexistent small yacht to the shore on the weekends. In the real world, though, it’s a bit too large and pricey for day-to-day use.\n\nFor 2015, the eight-seat QX80 has added a Limited trim level and updated the exterior design, specifically the front end. Infiniti has also added some new wheel packages and refined the interior. Compare this year’s model with last year’s version here.\n\nI drove a base QX80 all-wheel drive equipped with the Driver Assistance Package, Theater Package and Deluxe Technology Package, as well as the Tire and Wheel Package. Compare the all-wheel-drive QX80 with the two-wheel-drive base model here.\n\nIf the QX80 isn’t your cup of tea for yacht-hauling, take a look at the Mercedes-Benz GL-Class or the Land Rover Range Rover Sport. See them compared side by side here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nChanges to the exterior of the QX80 this year include a new split front-end grill design and LEDs everywhere — or at least in the fog lights, turn signals and high- and low-beam headlights. The QX80’s rounded corners are certainly a matter of taste (do you prefer beluga or starlet caviar while watching the regatta?). Sadly, the strange chrome “gills” on either side of the QX80’s nose persist. Sigh.\n\nThe 22.8-inch step-in height for the backseat (it’s 22.4 inches up front) made the QX80 really difficult to climb into and out of. Sure, you can step up on the standard running boards for help, but then you have to simultaneously duck under the doorjamb. This would not be a great vehicle choice for someone with an affinity for pencil skirts. Since we’re more of a jeans and flip-flops kind of family, we survived.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe QX80’s 400-horsepower, 5.6-liter V-8 engine gets an EPA-estimated 14/20/16 mpg city/highway/combined with two-wheel drive. This gives it a slight advantage over the Land Rover Range Rover Sport’s 14/19/16 mpg rating and the Mercedes GL550’s 13/18/15 mpg. Mercedes’ GL450, however, has a more fuel-efficient 3.0-liter, six-cylinder engine, bumping up fuel economy to 17/21/19 mpg city/highway/combined. The GL350 Bluetec’s clean-diesel engine, rated 19/26/22 mpg, is the only diesel available in the group, though Land Rover says diesels are on the way. All the gas engines mentioned here require premium gasoline.\n\nThe QX is quite comfortable to ride in. Driving it, I noticed the sheer size when trying to take a tight turn or squeezing into a narrow parking spot, in which case the standard Around View Monitor cameras were a massive help. Pulling out of my garage and driveway required a three-point turn, which doesn’t happen often with cars I test. The Infiniti has a 41.6-foot turning diameter, compared with 40.7 feet in the Mercedes and 39.7 feet in the Land Rover.\n\nYou’ll definitely feel the QX80’s height in the form of tip and lean in corners. Here, Infiniti should take a cue from Dodge; that automaker managed to make the large Durango hunker down and tighten up in corners.\n\nInterior\nThis SUV thoroughly pampers all occupants. Buttery-soft leather seating throughout invites you to snuggle down into your seat regardless of how long you might be sitting there. As a matter of fact, I’m writing this review while crammed into a pitiful excuse of an airplane seat, longing to be back in the QX80 … or my own bed, whichever comes first.\n\nThe driver and front passenger get standard heated seats and can add ventilated seats. A heated leather and mocha burl wood steering wheel is also standard.\n\nIn the second row, you can opt for two captain’s chairs or, for the QX80’s maximum seating capacity of eight, a bench seat for three. My test car came equipped with the captain’s chairs, which are a favorite in my family. There was a center console between the two seats providing a large storage bin and two cupholders. While the console is great for the extra storage space, it takes up the “center aisle” walk-through space to the third row.\n\nI would have appreciated the ability to slide the captain’s chairs back and forth for added space where it was needed. I did, however, quickly forgive the absent function when I needed to load teenagers into the third row and discovered I could do so instantly by electronically flipping and tumbling the captain’s chairs from the comfort of the driver’s seat. I didn’t have to get out, get cold and wet, or fight with multiple latches and levers (or bark directions to passengers unfamiliar with the vehicle). Just make sure nobody is in the way before releasing the seats, as it’s kind of a violent tumble. Lifting the seats back up into position was much easier than I expected; I felt almost as if the seat assisted me in the process rather than making me heft dead weight.\n\nThe light and airy “wheat” interior color scheme in my test car was soothing, though it made me want to implement our home’s no-shoe policy in the car. Somehow, removing shoes every time someone enters the vehicle just doesn’t seem logical, so that beautiful creamy carpet suffered a bit in the end.\n\nThird-row passengers aren’t treated quite as extravagantly, with a relatively normal three-passenger bench seat. The center seat belt extends down from the ceiling, which will cut across the neckline of the child who inevitably sits back there. Air vents along the sides of the ceiling ensure climate comfort in the way-back.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nI strongly prefer simplicity when it comes to ergonomics and electronics in cars. Some touch-screens are great; you see what you need, you touch it, you get an instant response. Boom! However, in the QX80, the mix of a touch-screen alongside the Infiniti Controller is a bit confusing. When do you touch and when do you turn or press the knob? It’s nowhere near the bottom of the list of systems I’ve toyed with, but it could stand to be simplified.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe 16.6 cubic feet of cargo space behind the QX’s third row was more than enough to haul four packaged sink faucets for a DIY project, with plenty of room to spare for my three girls’ backpacks.\n\nThe third row splits 60/40 and each side can fold flat independent of the other (and lift back up into place) via a standard button in the cargo area. As explained above, the second-row seats tumble forward rather than folding flat into the floor. With them tumbled, the QX80’s maximum cargo space is 95.1 cubic feet. This is pretty consistent with the GL-Class’ 16.0 cubic feet behind the third row and 93.8-cubic-foot maximum cargo volume. The Range Rover Sport has just 9 cubic feet behind the third row and a maximum cargo volume of 62.2 cubic feet.\n\nFamilies hauling boats, horse trailers, campers and more will certainly appreciate the QX80’s impressive 8,500-pound towing capacity. In comparison, the Range Rover Sport can tow 7,716 pounds and the GL-Class can tow 7,500 pounds.\n\nSafety\nThough the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration crash-tests some full-size SUVs, neither it nor the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety have tested the QX80.\n\nMany of the active safety features available on the QX80 come via a $2,100 Driver Assistance Package. It includes blind spot warning, backup collision intervention and intelligent brake assist with forward emergency braking and predictive forward collision warning. An expensive $5,550 Deluxe Technology Package includes, among other things, blind spot intervention and lane departure prevention.\n\nFamilies installing child-safety seats will appreciate the easy access to the second-row Latch anchors and the stable seat belt buckle bases that make buckling in easier for kiddos with limited dexterity. However, third-row passengers may have more trouble buckling up as the seat belt buckle receptors are on floppy bases. Click here for a full Car Seat Check of the 2014 QX80, which also applies to the 2015.\n\nSee all the QX80’s standard safety features here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe QX80 is kind of in a class of its own. When trying to decide which cars to add to my comparison set for this review, the only one that seemed natural was the Mercedes-Benz GL. Anything else out there with a similar lux quotient is either much smaller or much larger.\n\nThe QX80 manages to be incredibly upscale, yet still functional and utilitarian. You can haul the kids to soccer or the sock hop, haul a trailer for your next house flip or pull up to a valet for a swanky, kid-free weekend getaway … so long as it doesn’t seem like too much vehicle for more typical, daily use.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Infiniti QX80?\n\nThe 2020 Infiniti QX80 is a full-size SUV that seats seven with second-row captain’s chairs. Seating capacity increases to eight with the available second-row bench seat. The QX80 is powered by a standard 400-horsepower, 5.6-liter V-8 engine that works with a seven-speed automatic transmission. Rear- and all-wheel-drive models are available, and competitors include the Lexus LX 570, Lincoln Navigator and Mercedes-Benz GLS-Class.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Infiniti QX80?\n\nInfiniti has given its flagship SUV a significant multimedia system update for 2020. The QX80 gets a new generation of the dual-screen InTouch multimedia system that Infiniti has used elsewhere in its lineup. The system includes HD displays and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity. Meanwhile, the instrument cluster gets a new 7-inch color screen, and a Bose Performance Series audio system is available. New standard safety features include blind spot warning, lane departure warning, backup collision intervention and a rear-seat reminder.\n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Infiniti QX80 Are Most Important?\n\nThe QX80’s powerful V-8 engine makes it a capable and luxurious towing vehicle, with a maximum trailering capacity of 8,500 pounds when properly equipped. In addition to the SUV’s newly standard active safety features, it also has standard forward collision warning and automatic emergency braking.\n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Infiniti QX80?\n\nThe QX80 is upscale, powerful, comfortable and offers solid towing capability. The third row is a little cozy for adults, however, and cargo space behind the third row measures just 16.6 cubic feet. That’s likely fine for routine errands but may not be enough for long-distance road trips with plenty of friends along for the ride. Though the V-8 engine delivers a lot of grunt, gas mileage is poor.",

      "expert_review": "In a far-off fantasy world where money is no object, I would buy the spacious, luxurious, plush 2015 Infiniti QX80 SUV to haul my family and our nonexistent small yacht to the shore on the weekends. In the real world, though, it’s a bit too large and pricey for day-to-day use.\n\nFor 2015, the eight-seat QX80 has added a Limited trim level and updated the exterior design, specifically the front end. Infiniti has also added some new wheel packages and refined the interior. Compare this year’s model with last year’s version here.\n\nI drove a base QX80 all-wheel drive equipped with the Driver Assistance Package, Theater Package and Deluxe Technology Package, as well as the Tire and Wheel Package. Compare the all-wheel-drive QX80 with the two-wheel-drive base model here.\n\nIf the QX80 isn’t your cup of tea for yacht-hauling, take a look at the Mercedes-Benz GL-Class or the Land Rover Range Rover Sport. See them compared side by side here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nChanges to the exterior of the QX80 this year include a new split front-end grill design and LEDs everywhere — or at least in the fog lights, turn signals and high- and low-beam headlights. The QX80’s rounded corners are certainly a matter of taste (do you prefer beluga or starlet caviar while watching the regatta?). Sadly, the strange chrome “gills” on either side of the QX80’s nose persist. Sigh.\n\nThe 22.8-inch step-in height for the backseat (it’s 22.4 inches up front) made the QX80 really difficult to climb into and out of. Sure, you can step up on the standard running boards for help, but then you have to simultaneously duck under the doorjamb. This would not be a great vehicle choice for someone with an affinity for pencil skirts. Since we’re more of a jeans and flip-flops kind of family, we survived.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe QX80’s 400-horsepower, 5.6-liter V-8 engine gets an EPA-estimated 14/20/16 mpg city/highway/combined with two-wheel drive. This gives it a slight advantage over the Land Rover Range Rover Sport’s 14/19/16 mpg rating and the Mercedes GL550’s 13/18/15 mpg. Mercedes’ GL450, however, has a more fuel-efficient 3.0-liter, six-cylinder engine, bumping up fuel economy to 17/21/19 mpg city/highway/combined. The GL350 Bluetec’s clean-diesel engine, rated 19/26/22 mpg, is the only diesel available in the group, though Land Rover says diesels are on the way. All the gas engines mentioned here require premium gasoline.\n\nThe QX is quite comfortable to ride in. Driving it, I noticed the sheer size when trying to take a tight turn or squeezing into a narrow parking spot, in which case the standard Around View Monitor cameras were a massive help. Pulling out of my garage and driveway required a three-point turn, which doesn’t happen often with cars I test. The Infiniti has a 41.6-foot turning diameter, compared with 40.7 feet in the Mercedes and 39.7 feet in the Land Rover.\n\nYou’ll definitely feel the QX80’s height in the form of tip and lean in corners. Here, Infiniti should take a cue from Dodge; that automaker managed to make the large Durango hunker down and tighten up in corners.\n\nInterior\nThis SUV thoroughly pampers all occupants. Buttery-soft leather seating throughout invites you to snuggle down into your seat regardless of how long you might be sitting there. As a matter of fact, I’m writing this review while crammed into a pitiful excuse of an airplane seat, longing to be back in the QX80 … or my own bed, whichever comes first.\n\nThe driver and front passenger get standard heated seats and can add ventilated seats. A heated leather and mocha burl wood steering wheel is also standard.\n\nIn the second row, you can opt for two captain’s chairs or, for the QX80’s maximum seating capacity of eight, a bench seat for three. My test car came equipped with the captain’s chairs, which are a favorite in my family. There was a center console between the two seats providing a large storage bin and two cupholders. While the console is great for the extra storage space, it takes up the “center aisle” walk-through space to the third row.\n\nI would have appreciated the ability to slide the captain’s chairs back and forth for added space where it was needed. I did, however, quickly forgive the absent function when I needed to load teenagers into the third row and discovered I could do so instantly by electronically flipping and tumbling the captain’s chairs from the comfort of the driver’s seat. I didn’t have to get out, get cold and wet, or fight with multiple latches and levers (or bark directions to passengers unfamiliar with the vehicle). Just make sure nobody is in the way before releasing the seats, as it’s kind of a violent tumble. Lifting the seats back up into position was much easier than I expected; I felt almost as if the seat assisted me in the process rather than making me heft dead weight.\n\nThe light and airy “wheat” interior color scheme in my test car was soothing, though it made me want to implement our home’s no-shoe policy in the car. Somehow, removing shoes every time someone enters the vehicle just doesn’t seem logical, so that beautiful creamy carpet suffered a bit in the end.\n\nThird-row passengers aren’t treated quite as extravagantly, with a relatively normal three-passenger bench seat. The center seat belt extends down from the ceiling, which will cut across the neckline of the child who inevitably sits back there. Air vents along the sides of the ceiling ensure climate comfort in the way-back.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nI strongly prefer simplicity when it comes to ergonomics and electronics in cars. Some touch-screens are great; you see what you need, you touch it, you get an instant response. Boom! However, in the QX80, the mix of a touch-screen alongside the Infiniti Controller is a bit confusing. When do you touch and when do you turn or press the knob? It’s nowhere near the bottom of the list of systems I’ve toyed with, but it could stand to be simplified.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe 16.6 cubic feet of cargo space behind the QX’s third row was more than enough to haul four packaged sink faucets for a DIY project, with plenty of room to spare for my three girls’ backpacks.\n\nThe third row splits 60/40 and each side can fold flat independent of the other (and lift back up into place) via a standard button in the cargo area. As explained above, the second-row seats tumble forward rather than folding flat into the floor. With them tumbled, the QX80’s maximum cargo space is 95.1 cubic feet. This is pretty consistent with the GL-Class’ 16.0 cubic feet behind the third row and 93.8-cubic-foot maximum cargo volume. The Range Rover Sport has just 9 cubic feet behind the third row and a maximum cargo volume of 62.2 cubic feet.\n\nFamilies hauling boats, horse trailers, campers and more will certainly appreciate the QX80’s impressive 8,500-pound towing capacity. In comparison, the Range Rover Sport can tow 7,716 pounds and the GL-Class can tow 7,500 pounds.\n\nSafety\nThough the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration crash-tests some full-size SUVs, neither it nor the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety have tested the QX80.\n\nMany of the active safety features available on the QX80 come via a $2,100 Driver Assistance Package. It includes blind spot warning, backup collision intervention and intelligent brake assist with forward emergency braking and predictive forward collision warning. An expensive $5,550 Deluxe Technology Package includes, among other things, blind spot intervention and lane departure prevention.\n\nFamilies installing child-safety seats will appreciate the easy access to the second-row Latch anchors and the stable seat belt buckle bases that make buckling in easier for kiddos with limited dexterity. However, third-row passengers may have more trouble buckling up as the seat belt buckle receptors are on floppy bases. Click here for a full Car Seat Check of the 2014 QX80, which also applies to the 2015.\n\nSee all the QX80’s standard safety features here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe QX80 is kind of in a class of its own. When trying to decide which cars to add to my comparison set for this review, the only one that seemed natural was the Mercedes-Benz GL. Anything else out there with a similar lux quotient is either much smaller or much larger.\n\nThe QX80 manages to be incredibly upscale, yet still functional and utilitarian. You can haul the kids to soccer or the sock hop, haul a trailer for your next house flip or pull up to a valet for a swanky, kid-free weekend getaway … so long as it doesn’t seem like too much vehicle for more typical, daily use.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Infiniti QX80?\n\nThe 2019 Infiniti QX80 is a full-size SUV that can seat up to eight people in three rows. It's powered by a 400-horsepower, 5.6-liter V-8 engine that pairs with a seven-speed automatic transmission. Rear- and all-wheel-drive models are available. Main competitors include the Lexus LX 570 and the Mercedes-Benz GLS-Class.\n\nWhat's New on the 2019 Infiniti QX80?\n\nThe base Luxe trim level now includes predictive forward collision warning and automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection. A new Limited trim features 22-inch wheels, ash wood trim, satin-chrome finishes and other high-end features and finishes.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Infiniti QX80 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard V-8 power makes the QX80 a capable tow rig with a maximum towing capacity of 8,500 pounds when properly equipped. Standard second-row captain's chairs are a popular feature, but if you need to carry eight people, you can get a second-row bench seat instead. Available active safety features include adaptive cruise control, a blind spot warning system and lane departure warning and prevention.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Infiniti QX80?\n\nThe QX80's cabin is upscale, and it offers good second-row space. But like other non-extended-length full-size SUVs, the third row is small and there's not a lot of cargo space behind it, which could make packing for a family road trip difficult. The big V-8 engine is thirsty, too.",

      "expert_review": "Infiniti has given its big flagship SUV, the QX80, yet another update in this current generation. That’s the second one so far over eight model years if you’re keeping track. This SUV remains a value option among big luxury SUVs, and thanks to these updates, it’s a little easier now on the eyes.\n  Related: 2018 Infiniti QX80 Vs. 2018 Nissan Armada: Is the Luxury Badge Worth It?\n\n  \n    \n  \n      About that styling: A lot of important small changes are present. Infiniti says everything ahead of the A-pillars is new, with styling cues from the Monograph concept SUV that appeared at the New York International Auto Show in 2017. The headlights sit up higher and stretch out over the front fenders more; the grille doesn’t fan out as much as it used to at the top and the bottom; overall, it doesn’t look like it’s melting quite as much, an issue we’ve had with previous model years of the QX80. The front bumper still has a lot going on with it, but it looks less busy than before. Around back, the LED taillights are thinner and there’s some chrome that goes across the entire liftgate. Overall, it’s a more cohesive design.\n  Less has changed on the inside — and this is where the QX80 is starting to show some of the current generation’s age. Materials are lush as you’d expect in this class, but the center controls and the multimedia system harken back to an earlier era of Infiniti. There’s an 8-inch screen, but the graphics are merely so-so and it doesn’t respond very fast to simple things like turning the tuning knob. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are both unavailable in the QX80.\n  For the rest of my thoughts on the 2018 Infiniti QX80, watch the video above.\n  Cars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2022 Infiniti QX80?\n\nThe Infiniti QX80 is a full-size body-on-frame SUV that seats seven with its standard second-row captain’s chairs, eight with an available second-row bench. The QX80 is powered by a 400-horsepower, 5.6-liter V-8 engine that works with a seven-speed automatic transmission. Rear- and four-wheel-drive models are available.\n\nThe QX80 competes with the Cadillac Escalade, Lexus LX 600 and Lincoln Navigator. You can see how it scored in our Car Seat Check here.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2022 Infiniti QX80?\n\nA new 12.3-inch touchscreen replaces the previous dual-screen multimedia system, and wireless device charging is standard.\n\nWhat Features in the 2022 Infiniti QX80 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n20-inch aluminum wheels\nLED headlights and taillights\nPower moonroof\nPower liftgate\nLeather-trimmed seats\nHeated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nPower-folding third row\nTri-zone automatic air conditioning\nWireless Apple CarPlay, wired Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nSatellite radio\nNavigation\n360-degree camera system\nAutomatic emergency braking\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nLane departure prevention\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n8,500-pound maximum towing capacity\nSelf-leveling rear suspension\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n22-inch wheels\nAdaptive headlights\nVentilated front seats\nSecond-row heated seats\nDual-screen rear entertainment system\nActive suspension\nShould I Buy the 2022 Infiniti QX80?\n\nThe QX80 is upscale, powerful, comfortable and offers solid towing capability. The new 12.3-inch touchscreen helps modernize the cabin. The third row is a little cozy for adults, however, and while cargo space behind the third row may be fine for routine errands, it might be tight for long-distance family road trips. The V-8 engine delivers a lot of grunt, but it also uses a lot of gas.",

      "expert_review": "Love the big Infiniti QX80 three-row SUV but wish it had a bit more verve? A bit more ‘tude? Lucky you! Infiniti’s bringing back the “S” for the 2026 model year with the new QX80 Sport, adding a smidge more style and edge to the full-size SUV.\n\nRelated: How Much Is the 2026 Infiniti QX80?\n\nAs Lovely and Luxe as the Sensory\n\nDon’t expect to achieve any additional sport with your Sport, though. Since this is best thought of as an appearance and style trim, the Sport is mechanically unchanged when compared to the Sensory trim it replaces in the lineup. It gets the same 450-horsepower, twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter V-6 engine with 516 pounds-feet of torque, routed to all four wheels through a nine-speed automatic transmission and four-wheel-drive system. Similarly untouched are the adaptive air suspension, brakes, tires and drive modes.\n\nYes, this is purely an appearance and equipment package despite the modestly evocative name. Look for the main differences in the Sport-exclusive 22-inch wheels, slightly reworked grille, darkened exterior chrome trim, “S” badging, and an exclusive Dusk Blue interior color scheme. In person, it’s exactly as subtle as you’d expect, with the biggest standouts being those big ol’ multispoke wheels and the silver “S” badge on the rear liftgate.\n\nEverything else is mostly where you left it on the Sensory grade, including semi-aniline leather upholstery, heated and ventilated first- and second-row seats, biometric cooling, a 24-speaker Klipsch sound system and massaging first-row seats. It’s generally as lovely and luxe as we experienced on the prior trim level, only dusky.\n\nI do wish the new Sport was Infiniti’s translation of the also-new Nissan Armada NISMO, however. (C’mon, were you really looking to make a back-roads bruiser out of your million-billion pound QX80?) Darkened chrome and deep-blue leather looks far classier than what’s on the garish NISMO, and if I was building my own QX80, I’d have a hard time staying away from the Sport configuration.\n\nWell, given the 2026 Infiniti QX80 Sport’s $104,140 starting price (including $2,190 destination charge), maybe I could forgo its stealthy style for something a bit more … Sportless.\n\nRead More About the Infiniti QX80:\n\n2025 Infiniti QX80 Review: Good Tidings\nWhich 3-Row SUVs Offer Captain’s Chairs?\nBuy This, Not That: Why We Prefer the Latest Mainstream-Brand Big SUVs\n19 Vehicles Earn IIHS Top Safety Pick Awards\nIs the 2025 Infiniti QX80 a Good 3-Row SUV? 5 Pros, 2 Cons\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

You can see how it scored in our Car Seat Check here.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Infiniti QX80?\n\nA Dark Chrome Appearance Package, offered on the top-line Sensory trim level, adds dark-chrome exterior trim and black mirror housings. The 2024 model year is the last for the current-generation QX80. An all-new redesigned QX80 — with a twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter V-6 instead of a V-8 — is scheduled to debut for the 2025 model year. \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Infiniti QX80 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n20-inch aluminum wheels\nLED headlights and taillights\nPower moonroof\nPower liftgate\nLeather-trimmed seats\nHeated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nPower-folding third row\nTri-zone automatic air conditioning\n12.3-inch infotainment touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay, wired Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nWireless charging pad\nSatellite radio\nNavigation\n360-degree camera system\nAutomatic emergency braking\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nLane departure prevention\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n8,500-pound maximum towing capacity\nSelf-leveling rear suspension\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n22-inch wheels\nAdaptive headlights\nVentilated front seats\nHeated second-row seats\nPremium Bose sound system\nActive suspension\nShould I Buy the 2024 Infiniti QX80?\n\nThe QX80 is upscale, powerful and comfortable, and it offers solid towing capability. The third row is a little cozy for adults, however, and while cargo space behind the third row may be fine for routine errands, it could be tight for long-distance family road trips. The V-8 engine delivers a lot of grunt, but it also uses a lot of gas. The QX80’s aged basic design dates all the way back to the 2011 model year. It feels behind the times in many ways, but good deals may be available given a redesigned 2025 model is on the horizon.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Infiniti’s QX80 flagship feels ancient in almost every way, but the throwback experience can still be enjoyable — if going old-school is your goal.\n\nVersus the competition: The QX80 lags nearly every competitor in ride and handling and interior technology; it’s even been surpassed by the related, and more affordable, Nissan Armada, which was updated for the 2021 model year — a treatment the QX80 desperately needs.\n\nBuilding three-row, body-on-frame SUVs used to require a fairly simple formula: Take a truck frame, chuck a big V-8 up front, and give it a cushy suspension and rear- or four-wheel drive. The game has gotten more complex now, with luxury brands adding things like high-tech interiors (Cadillac), turbocharged V-6s (Lincoln) and 10-speed automatic transmissions (Lincoln, Cadillac, GMC). Infiniti, unfortunately, missed the memo.\n\nRelated: 2022 Infiniti QX55 Review: Satisfyingly Premium, But Not as Sporty as It Looks\n\nLike a professional sports team that eschews advanced analytics, the QX80 manages to be occasionally competitive with rivals like the Cadillac Escalade, Lincoln Navigator and GMC Yukon Denali, but it feels like it’s fighting with one hand tied behind its back.\n\nThe Land Yacht Before Time\n\nThe QX80’s driving experience is one of its standout attributes — for good and ill. I found it enjoyable, but I also drove a 1997 Toyota 4Runner for more than a decade; I guess you could say old-school SUVs are right up my alley.\n\nHit the gas pedal in the QX80, and the 400-horsepower, 5.6-liter V-8 under the hood roars to life. While the QX80 won’t set any speed records, accelerator response is immediate, and acceleration feels impressively brisk for a roughly 5,700-pound three-row SUV. The seven-speed automatic transmission shifts smartly, dropping gears when you need passing power and upshifting when it can in a (mostly futile) attempt to conserve fuel. Braking is also impressive for a large SUV: It takes a while to slow this much mass to a stop, but the firm brake-pedal feel inspires confidence.\n\nThe QX80’s ride and handling and steering, however, are atrocious. Steering is vague, with far too much power assist; it feels like you’re piloting a boat. The QX80’s suspension eats potholes and expansion joints for breakfast, lunch and dinner, but turns and successive bumps elicit significant body roll. The QX80 feels every bit like a big SUV. The Escalade, Yukon Denali and Navigator have better ride and handling; domestic luxury brands have figured out how to handle road imperfections with almost unnervingly little body roll. But here’s the thing: Yes, the Navigator, Yukon Denali and Escalade are all better at this, yet I kind of like when a big SUV feels big. It’s a throwback to a simpler time.\n\nAnother throwback to a “simpler” time is the QX80’s fuel economy. Our mid-level QX80 Premium Select with 4WD is rated 13/19/15 mpg city/highway/combined using premium gas. You know what else gets 15 mpg combined on premium? The 797-hp Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat Redeye Widebody. Just some food for thought.\n\nThat said, the QX80’s rivals don’t do much better. Four-wheel-drive versions of the 2021 Cadillac Escalade and GMC Yukon Denali are both rated 14/19/16 mpg on premium, while the 4WD 2021 Lincoln Navigator does only slightly better at 16/20/17 mpg. The Navigator can use regular gas, but it reduces the SUV’s rated output. The Escalade and Yukon are also available with a diesel engine, rated 20/26/22 mpg with 4WD.\n\nOn a positive note, the QX80 can tow up to 8,500 pounds when properly equipped, giving owners the chance to tow one boat with another. If you’re going to pull a heavy trailer, it’ll be worth having a trailer brake controller, though you’ll have to go the aftermarket route to get one — the SUV doesn’t have one, though it is wired for one. (An integrated trailer brake controller is available on the 2021 Armada.)\n\nTime Capsule Interior\n\nThe fact that the Armada is more modern than the QX80 is more of an issue for me than the Infiniti’s trucky ride and handling. For 2021, the Armada received an updated interior with a new touchscreen display and a much cleaner and better organized set of physical controls. The QX80, on the other hand, has a dual-screen multimedia system that’s felt dated for a while now — even though it was updated for the 2020 model year.\n\nThe graphics on the screens are dated and sometimes hard to read, and the lower screen is easily washed out by sunlight. The dual displays feel especially unnecessary knowing Infiniti’s parent company, Nissan, makes a single-display system that works well. At least Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are standard.\n\nThe QX80’s physical controls are also something of a mess, with buttons, knobs and dials all over the place. We’re very much pro-physical controls here at Cars.com, but the QX80’s layout leaves a lot to be desired. Like the screens, it’s all the more frustrating because Nissan has done a much better job in the Armada. It’s weird that the flagship model from Nissan’s luxury brand didn’t get the first crack at the latest technology updates.\n\nThe Lincoln Navigator’s interior, by comparison, uses nicer materials and better tech, and the layout is mostly better than the Infiniti’s, save the push-button gear selector. The Cadillac Escalade’s interior also blows the QX80’s out of the water, especially its screen. One could argue that the Escalade’s 16.9-inch organic light-emitting diode touchscreen, digital instrument panel and a touchscreen panel to the left of the steering wheel also make up a multiscreen setup, but the quality and execution are leaps and bounds ahead of Infiniti’s aging system.\n\nOn the bright side, the seats in the QX80’s first two rows are well padded and quite comfortable, even for longer trips. In our test vehicle, a large console between the second-row captain’s chairs made those the best seats in the house.\n\nWhere the QX80 falls flat is the third row, which is hard to get to and a hard place to get comfortable. Access is hampered by that second-row center console. The best option is to tumble a second-row seat forward, take a big step up (perhaps too big for smaller children or anyone with mobility difficulties), then clamber to the third row. Once back there, anyone adult-sized will think of nothing but leaving: It’s cramped, with minimal legroom and headroom, and a low seat bottom that’s likely to leave passengers’ knees uncomfortably bent.\n\nSafety\n\nAdvanced driver-assistance features including forward collision warning, automatic front and rear emergency braking, adaptive cruise control and blind spot intervention, all of which are standard on the QX80. Infiniti’s Around View 360-degree camera system is also standard. The resolution of the 360-degree and backup camera images is somewhat worse than competitors’, but not so bad that the features aren’t useful. Infiniti’s Smart Rearview Mirror camera system is also standard, allowing drivers to see what’s behind them when the traditional mirror’s view is obstructed.\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gave the 2021 QX80 a four-star overall rating, with five stars in side crash tests but three stars in front crash and rollover tests.\n\nSee how the QX80 performed in our Car Seat Check.\n\nShould You Buy a 2021 QX80?\n\nWell, it depends. Do you want a modern, carlike ride that belies the sheer size of the SUV you’re driving? Do you want the latest in-car technology? If you answered yes to both those questions, the QX80 probably isn’t for you; you’d likely be happier with a Lincoln or Cadillac (or a Ford Expedition, Chevrolet Tahoe or GMC Yukon). If your answer to just the second question was yes, may I suggest the 2021 Nissan Armada as a more affordable and modern choice? Or if you answered yes to only the second question but don’t need three rows of seats, meet the Ram 1500.\n\nPart of what makes the QX80 appealing is its premium cachet, available at a more affordable price. Our mid-level trim with 4WD and a few options cost $79,490, including destination charge. That’s less than a 4WD base version of a Navigator or Escalade, but a few thousand dollars more than a 2021 GMC Yukon Denali.\n\nLogic may dictate choosing a more affordable full-size SUV, or a more luxurious or better-driving one. But if there’s something about the QX80 that makes it the one for you, I’ll be with you in spirit whenever you lean into a corner.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The comprehensively redesigned and decidedly upmarket 2025 Infiniti QX80 is a moonshot away from its predecessor, and a model that Infiniti claims is the benchmark for brand offerings going forward.\n\nVersus the competition: As we’ve only seen the top-level Autograph trim of the new QX80, we don’t know exactly how its entry-level and mid-range trims will fare. However, with a lower starting price and ceiling, the extremely well-equipped top QX80 is a fine threat to uplevel versions of the Lexus LX 600 and the like.\n\nAccording to Infiniti, the 2025 QX80 is a very big bellwether for very big things to come. Yes, it’s physically ginormous, but important folks from the automaker promised that all of the good details and new brand language we like about its latest behemoth are slated to become a family affair. In essence, look to the new QX80 to get a peek at future Infiniti products that promise to inch the marque upmarket toward Lexus and the German luxury brands.\n\nRelated: 2025 Infiniti QX80 Up Close: Beautiful Behemoth\n\nThis is quite the 180 from Infiniti’s on-record “Nissan-plus” shift in brand direction back in 2020 that, at the time, signaled a potential departure from its decades-long pursuit of the established luxury segment that was sometimes right on the money and sometimes far off the mark.\n\nDon’t Be Picky on Pricing \n\nAesthetically and materially, the new QX80 is a mighty effort and generally succeeds as a flagship three-row full-size SUV for this “new” Infiniti — new threads, new digs, new money. Some noise emerged over the QX80’s nearly $10,000 price jump for the new generation, decrying the value proposition versus its competitors. Oh yeah? Is that why the Lexus LX 600, inarguably its most direct competitor, starts at nearly $10,000 more for 2024 at $93,915 (all prices include destination)? The 2025 QX80 is hardly cheap at $84,445 for a base rear-wheel-drive Pure trim, but let’s take a gander at the competitive field’s cheapest, no-frills variants: $83,890 for a 2024 Cadillac Escalade, $85,260 for a Lincoln Navigator and $93,945 for a Jeep Grand Wagoneer. Seems like Infiniti has priced it right where it should be. I have not spent any time in this mythical base QX80 — no one has — but I suspect it will lag behind only the Jeep in appointments, especially considering just how luxe the top-shelf six-figure Autograph trim is.\n\nDon’t mistake this as a declaration of the QX80 as a class leader. I merely take umbrage at the idea that because the outgoing QX80 was rightfully seen as an off-the-pace, antiquated dinosaur, the new, pricier SUV must be reaching out of its league. Nonsense; the prior QX80 was quite competitive in its day, matching many of the trucks mentioned above pound for pound, dollar for dollar.\n\n2025 Infiniti QX80 | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\nJapanese Craftsmanship \n\nSo at least for the maxed-out $112,590 Autograph trim, it seems positioned just fine. It’s also quite the box to behold, with striking looks that move it a far step beyond the beluga bloat of the last gen. As I covered this fairly in depth at a studio preview in March, I’m not going to do another full breakdown of the new bodywork, but it raises an interesting point: Infiniti is putting effort into returning to its roots as a Japanese brand, promoting traditional craftsmanship and general stylistic motifs from its homeland. The solid bar of rear taillights, for example, are inspired by the bamboo forests outside Kyoto; the “4WD” badge on the rear and the “V6” badge on the engine cover are presented in the style of Japan’s distinctive hanko stamp; and on upper trims, you’ll find a decorative metal plate on the floormats sporting a dimpled surface reminiscent of the tsuiki style of hand-hammered Japanese metalware.\n\nAnd why not? Appreciation for Japanese luxury and craftsmanship is peaking between whiskey, fine watches, apparel and collector cars, so it makes a whole lot of sense for Infiniti to capitalize on this in ways Lexus and Acura are not. Beyond the Japanese flourishes, it’s generally a rather nice place to wick away the traffic hours; the Autograph trim is absolutely decked with plush niceties like quilted leather, massage seats, real wood trim — a bit of a rarity these days — and metal accent bits scattered about the cabin.\n\n2025 Infiniti QX80 | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\nTech, Luxe and Everything in Between \n\nIt’s by far the most impressive part of the new SUV. Look closer and you’ll find more goodies: Those second-row thrones pack massage, heating and ventilation functions, all controlled through a dedicated center console touchscreen; third-row occupants are at least toasty thanks to heated seats, and the climate of the entire cabin should be nice and, ah, perfect thanks to an evocatively named bit of passenger-sensing tech Infiniti calls “biometric cooling.”\n\nThat’s before you even start futzing with the infotainment. Dual 14.3-inch displays take up most of the dash real estate, with the center screen handling vehicle functions, entertainment and phone projection (wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto) while the driver enjoys a wide display in front of the steering wheel for all of the things they would ever need to know about the drive, what’s streaming, where to turn and how much fuel they’ve burned.\n\nClimate controls, seat functions and drive modes are handled by a 9-inch touchscreen on the front center console. I’d like more hard buttons for climate and media functions, but the console screen is reasonably reactive, haptic and simple to navigate. And if that wasn’t enough data beamed into your eyes, all but the base trim have a head-up display.\n\n2025 Infiniti QX80 | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\n\nTwo techy elements really stood out. First, the 24-speaker Klipsch sound system is a sight and sound to behold, with visually fascinating surround speakers around the front head restraints. These have the ability to isolate sound to the point where you can blast your tunes while folks snooze in back or carry calls over Bluetooth without turning the volume down. Of course, regular audio functions are impressive and very high-fidelity, though I didn’t spend as much time nor cycle enough of my personal reference tracks to get the full aural picture.\n\nSecondly, the QX80’s suite of surround cameras is somethin’ else. You can artificially zoom out to every angle of the massive SUV to see what trees, parking meters and vintage Fiats you’ve run over. I’m particularly partial to the Invisible Hood View and Front Wide View that gives you a clearer view forward and lets you see past parked cars, respectively.\n\nIt’s Huge! It’s Powerful!\n\nTop marks for occupant comfort and entertainment — and stowage, of course, with an 18% boost in cargo capacity behind the second row and a 30% increase behind the third, according to Infiniti. Comfort and utility is the QX80’s raison d’etre, but believe it or not, I did get a chance to drive the darn thing out on the open road.\n\n2025 Infiniti QX80 | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\n\nAnd guess what: It’s totally what you would expect. It’s big, it’s torquey, it’s (mostly) comfy, and it gives you a commanding view of everything ahead for a good mile. Gone is the beloved (but terribly thirsty) naturally aspirated 5.6-liter V-8, now supplanted by a twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter V-6 that boosts power and torque to 450 horsepower and a butter-thick 516 pounds-feet of torque. You can nab RWD or all-wheel drive for the two lowest trims, but all others have AWD standard.\n\nWhat’s standard no matter what trim you get is a nine-speed automatic transmission that’s related to Mercedes-Benz’s 9G-Tronic transmission. I like it in Mercs and I like it in the QX80; it’s smooth and entirely anonymous in relaxed driving, and it’s more than quick enough when you need it to kick down for passing or merging.\n\nMore From Cars.com: \n\n2025 Infiniti QX80: Premium Styling, Premium Pricing\nInfiniti QX Monograph Concept Previews Imminent QX80 Redesign\nWhich 3-Row SUVs Offer Captain’s Chairs?\nThese 10 SUVs Have the Highest Towing Capacity\nShop for a New Infiniti QX80\n2025 Infiniti QX80 | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\nSurprising Stiffness \n\nThe suspension, despite being an advanced adaptive air suspension, was stiffer than I expected, channeling more jostle and judder into the seat than I would have preferred in something so large and couchlike. It’s still what I would consider comfortable and composed, there’s just a bit less compliance than I’d pick. Most trim levels including the Autograph have 22-inch wheels and lower-profile tires, a combination that typically doesn’t benefit ride comfort, but the base trim gets 20-inch wheels and taller-sidewall tires.\n\nAlso interesting is the lack of a “comfort” mode for the suspension, with the QX80 offering only Standard, Eco, Sport, Snow, Tow and Personal modes. Infiniti confirms that each has its own suspension profile, but I do believe a softer comfort mode should be a natural inclusion. Don’t think that’s what Personal is for — you can only choose between Standard and Sport for the custom suspension and powertrain settings.\n\nThe new turbo six-cylinder is as reassuringly meaty as they come, with some nice, robust growl when you explore the throttle. An industry colleague brought some GPS-based testing gear to the Infiniti event where I drove the QX80 and noted a 0-60 mph sprint in the mid-six-second range, which is beyond what you need to crush an on-ramp or haul a full house of family and friends up a mountain.\n\n2025 Infiniti QX80 | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\n\nEverything was fine and dandy, with perfectly smooth and anodyne steering, braking that’s strong and confident for something that weighs … well, it’s still to be announced, but it’s safe to assume it weighs a lot. It doesn’t drive smaller than it is, but it’s certainly not the school bus you might expect, and I reckon if you’re the target audience for something this size, you’re likely not looking for it to shrink around you like a QX50.\n\nIt’s a good full-size luxury SUV, and a positive sign that Infiniti might be on the up-and-up toward higher territory. Despite the extra cash required, I think SUV-hungry customers will snap these up as quick as they can build ‘em. Now, the quilted-leather ball is in Nissan’s court for a new, QX80-based Armada — perhaps something in the vein of “Infiniti-minus”?\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
