      "expert_review": "If you think all those slick Infiniti commercials – which are beginning towear a little thin – are nothing but more ad agency drivel dreamed up by someMadison Avenue whiz kid, you are dead wrong. The Infiniti Q45 is everythingthe ads claim.\n\nConsider Infiniti’s slogan: ”The gods live in the details.” It is in thedetails where the Q45 goes beyond excellence. You can’t help but notice thingslike the placement and feel of the switches; the faces of the gauges; thesmooth way the glove compartment opens; and the ease and precision with whicheverything operates. You want details? There’s even a card in the glovecompartment containing the signature of a Nissan ”Quality AssuranceEngineer” certifying that the car has been tested and all systems are go.\n\nOn most cars you don’t notice things like how the seats are adjusted or theway the air conditioner controls work. You just use them and forget it. It’snot like that in the Q45. The controls work so well and divert so little ofyour attention away from driving the car, that you can’t help but notice.\n\nEvery switch, button or knob the driver touches are part of what must havebeen a complete rethink of the way cars are put together. A computer-literateperson might call the Q45 user friendly. Things that previously werecomplicated are now easy. If you want a good example of this, compare a 5or7-series BMW with the Q45. With dozens of buttons and knobs on the BMW’s dash,you feel like you need a degree in engineering to figure out how to operatethe radio.\n\nI wasn’t in the Q45 for more than an hour before I was wheeling it aroundas if I had owned it for years. I never once needed to take my eyes off theroad to switch radio stations, raise or lower the windows, switch gears oradjust the temperature.\n\nWith the Q45’s computer-controlled memory operating the driver’s seat andsteering wheel, the car and changes the position of the seat or steering, oneflick of a button will put them right back to where you like them.\n\nIf a manufacturer puts a price of $38,350 on a car, it had better be prettyspectacular. But Nissan engineers went beyond spectacular in every area exceptthe styling.\n\nThe badge on the Q45’s nose has taken a lot of heat. Comedian Jay Leno saidit reminded him of a belt buckle with snakes on it. One of the auto magazinescalled the large, gaudy badge the work of a Cadillac designer on a bad day inthe ’60s.\n\nThe Q45’s door handles also have been criticized for looking out of place.And the car’s overall styling isn’t memorable. In fact, the Q45’s front endhas the same basic shape of the Ford Taurus, the new Acura Integra and half adozen other cars. Rear-seat passengers more than 6 feet tall are apt to beuncomfortable. Feet have to go underneath the front seats, and head room isbut an inch or two. The placement of the foot-operated emergency brake is alsopoor. My left foot kept banging into it. But these shortcomings are the lastthing on your mind as you are muscling down the road.\n\nWith the possible exception of the engine lurking under the hood of theTaurus SHO, there is no finer looking power plant than the 278-horsepower,32-valve heart-stopping V-8 in the Q45. It just may be the Rolex of automotiveengines.\n\nThe Q45’s engine is smooth. By shifting from fourth to third on the car’sautomatic gearbox and pressing the exhilarator (the gas pedal is much morethan an accelerator in the Q45), you leap from 40 mph to 80 mph in the blinkof an eye. You don’t expect that from a car the size of the Q45. You alsodon’t expect it to handle the way it does, which is somewhere near perfect.\n\nThe speed-sensitive steering felt just right. Take a tight curve at highspeeds and the Infiniti seems connected to the pavement as if by some magicalmagnetic force.\n\nRegardless of how you feel about the Infiniti’s styling or about Japanesecars in general, if you are considering a luxury car, this one should not beignored. It represents state o f the art technology and engineering, a qualityof build equal to or greater than anything from Europe, and, most importantly,a value-for-money factor that few cars can match.\n\nThe test car, provided by Don Mealey Infiniti, came equipped witheverything you find in the big BMW and Mercedes-Benz cars: leather interior,sunroof, impressive sound system, anti-lock brakes and power everything. Thereis one sticker on the car. It reads $38,350. That’s it. There are no hiddencharges, no gouging for rustproofing, undercoating, upholstery protection orany other dealer-added rip-off item, such as extra profit ”market valueadjustments.”\n\nYou can buy a cellular phone for about $1,200, a CD player for another$1,100 and a touring package for about $2,500 more. Those are the only optionsavailable.\n\nWith the Q45, the warning shots have been fired. The Japanese already ownthe economy car segment of the market. If the European automakers don’t watchtheir flanks, they may be overtaken – if they haven’t been already.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nFollowing a major redesign last year, changes are more modest in 2003 for Infinitis flagship sedan, even though the automaker claims that more than 24 enhancements have been made. A revised grille, headlight surrounds and a rear finisher give the Q45 sedan what Infiniti calls a fresh look and feel. A new trunk pull-down feature that automatically closes the trunk lid is standard. Climate-controlled front seats are newly available and come standard on the Premium model. An XM or Sirius Satellite Radio can be installed, and the trunk holds a full-size spare tire.\n\nThe current Q45 is still equipped with rear-wheel drive. The sedan reaches closer to the models beginning, as a 1990 model, by displaying an elegant persona that some observers felt was absent from the second-generation sedan.\n\nExterior\nRiding a 113-inch wheelbase, the Q45 is 199.6 inches long overall. Last years reshaping of the sculpted-profile body made it more aerodynamically efficient. A large, titanium-colored grille is framed by the integrated front bumper and fascia and features a prominent Infiniti badge. Large taillights sit past a raised rear deck. Large high-intensity-discharge headlights have seven individual lenses and a free-surface reflector. Heated, automatic-dimming outside mirrors include a memory feature and integral turn signals.\n\nStandard aluminum wheels hold P225/55VR17 tires, but run-flat and 18-inch tires are optional. A low-tire-pressure monitoring system is standard. The Q45s power rack-and-pinion steering is speed-sensitive.\n\nInterior\nSoft leather and genuine Birds Eye Maple highlight the five-passenger interior. The driver faces a hand-stitched leather and wood steering wheel and electroluminescent round instruments. A power rear-window sunshade and manual sunshades for the rear-door windows are optional. Available power rear seats have an adjustable backrest angle.\n\nThe Vehicle Information System has a 7-inch LCD screen, which comes with a 5.8-inch screen when the optional 3-D navigation system is not installed. Other options include radar-based Adaptive Cruise Control and a rearview monitor system that uses the LCD screen to display an image of the area in back of the car when its backing up.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe 4.5-liter V-8 engine develops 340 horsepower. A variable-length air induction system and continuously variable valve timing control boost engine efficiency. A five-speed-automatic transmission incorporates a manual-shifting mode. Infiniti claims a 0-to-60-mph acceleration time of about 5.9 seconds for the Q45.\n\nSafety\nStandard features include vented antilock disc brakes, rear child-safety seat tether anchors, side-impact airbags and active head restraints for the front seats. Side curtain-type airbags that deploy from the roof for head protection are also standard. A Vehicle Dynamic Control system governs brake pressure and engine torque automatically on slippery surfaces or in demanding maneuvers.\n\nDriving Impressions\nThe elegance of the first Q45 is back with a vengeance and is augmented by sterling performance and satisfying handling traits. The Q45 is exceptionally easy to drive for a big car, and its also fun to maneuver. Acceleration reaches beyond energetic as the V-8 delivers its hefty output in an utterly civilized manner, while maintaining refined noise levels.\n\nThe Q45 steers with a somewhat light touch, and it offers excellent feel and feedback by grasping the pavement tenaciously through curves. As for the Q45s ride comfort, the Infiniti suspension basically nudges aside nearly all imperfections; even deep potholes are dealt with handily.\n\nLushly cushioned yet highly supportive seats are covered with fine leather. The drivers headroom is acceptable but not huge, and elbowroom and legroom are abundant.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2003 Buying Guide\nPosted on 11/20/2002",

      "expert_review": "Moving from the miniaturized Q45 to its Big Brother, which also is on that 100 percent tariff hit list, you might want to check out one of the better “driver’s machines “or “road machines.”\n\nThe lengthy equipment list and hefty window sticker have it posing as a luxury sedan, however.\n\nWe tested the 1995 Q45A, the A being the key to what makes this car special-full active suspension. That means when you hit a bump, the suspension automatically pushes downward with a computer-controlled hyrdaulic pump. The intent-and it works-is to provide a smooth, level ride.\n\nThe Q45A also is equipped with a limited slip differential that sends power to the wheel with the most traction when another one passes over ice or snow.\n\nAnd then there’s traction control, which supplements the limited slip differential by automatically engaging when both rear tires are slipping. If one tire is slipping, the limited slip goes to work. If sensors detect both wheels slipping, the anti-lock braking system intermittently applies brakes to the right and left wheels to prevent slipping and loss of control while engine speed is reduced until it’s in harmony with the available tire traction.\n\nThis means the Q45A is an all-season, all-weather, all-climate rear-wheel-drive sedan. And to further ensure you don’t get bounced around, there’s fully independent four-wheel suspension so that when one wheel experiences shock, the other three-and the folks in the cabin-don’t.\n\nIt’s comfortable, quiet and, with a 4.5-liter, 278-h.p., 32-valve, V-8, certainly peppy, though the 15 m.p.g. city/21 m.p.g. highway rating proves energy comes at the expense of economy.\n\nBut, as we said, if the Clinton administration imposes punitive tariffs on Japanese luxury cars, you may have to hold a winning lottery ticket to be able to afford one. There may be a run on the machines before the tariff deadline to avoid an increase.\n\nThe Q45A we tested starts at $59,350. All you need add is $450 for freight.\n\nFor that sum you get dual air bags, all-season tires, tinted glass, power tilt and slide sunroof, heated remote outside mirrors, color-keyed splash guards, carpeted trunk, power front heated seats with driver memory (get in and turn the ignition key and the seat and steering column motor into your desired position).\n\nThere’s also center console cupholders, illuminated entry system, air conditioning, Bose AM/FM stereo with cassette and integrated compact disc player with the changer in the trunk (which gets finicky in damp weather), power tilt/telescoping steering wheel, power windows/locks, cruise control, cellular phone wiring, speed-sensitive power steering and keyless remote entry to name the major items.",

      "expert_review": "Ever try to persuade your best friend to go on a blind date?\n\nLooks were probably his or her first concern.\n\nYou’d be forced to dance around the issue. In a good-natured sort of way, you’d say something vague and imprecise, and you’d be sure to place special emphasis on the words ”wonderful personality.”\n\nWell, that’s how it has been with the Infiniti Q45 since Nissan introduced it in November 1989.\n\nHere was a car that, under the skin, just may rank as one of the most technically excellent luxury sports sedans ever built.\n\nYet there was a slight problem.\n\nThe Q45 had an unsightly wart on its nose, and door handles few could love.\n\nWhile Lincoln, Lexus, Acura and Cadillac danced the night away, the Q45 sat on the sidelines with Peugeot, Sterling and others, all dressed up in its new wave clothes, but with no place to go.\n\nThe original Q45 has been nothing less than a major disaster.\n\nHere’s what went wrong: Nissan built a $50,000 luxury car that didn’t have a chrome grille or a wood-trimmed interior – the two items that signify real luxury in today’s world.\n\nBut enough rehashing of history.\n\nFor Infiniti, the 1994 model year is here early. And this time the Q45 is ready to party.\n\nA major face lift is one of its more than 50 improvements.\n\nThat ugly, oversized and weird-looking badge on the Q45’s nose has been shaved off and replaced with a subtle and elegant chrome grille, a grille stylish enough to look good on a Jaguar.\n\nThe awkward-looking chrome door handles are still there, but what the heck.\n\nNow the Q45 is as beautiful as it is fast.\n\nAnd the 1994 model Q45 has it all, looks, performance, value and style.\n\nIt’s rare to find a car with all those qualities.\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nThe one area where the Q45 never needed any improvement is under the hood. As with previous models, the 1994 version features one of the world’s great passenger-car engines.\n\nIt’s a 278-horsepower four-cam V-8 with 32 valves and a sophisticated computer system.\n\nGenerally, engineers will sacrifice power to attain smoothness. In creating the 4.5-liter, aluminum V-8, Nissan’s engineers delivered both.\n\nThe slightest touch of the accelerator provokes an instant response as the big V-8 signals its eagerness to please.\n\nUnlike the Lexus LS 400 – the Q45’s main rival – the V-8 in the Infiniti lets you know it’s there by providing a wonderful array of expensive-sounding mechanical noises.\n\nIt’s not loud, but when you wind it up, you can hear the engine breathing. And those with sporting aspirations who appreciate a thoroughbred car may find their pulse quickening just a bit as the tachometer needle sweeps across the dial.\n\nSeveral auto magazines have tested previous models of the Q45 and have clocked 0-to-60 mph times in the 7.5-second range.\n\nIf the Q45’s performance has a drawback, it’s this: The car performs best once it’s over the 65 mph speed limit.\n\nOur t est car – as do all Q45s – came with a four-speed automatic that is linked to the engine via computer for supremely smooth shifts.\n\nTerrific fuel mileage is not one of the things you get with a Q45. In city driving using the air conditioner, the test car delivered just 14 miles per gallon. Also, buyers are socked with a $2,000 gas guzzler tax, which is included in the price of the car.\n\nHANDLING\n\nThe test car came with the optional full-active suspension system. That’s why there’s a little ”a” after the Q45 on the trunk lid. This is not an option, but a separate model, according to Infiniti.\n\nI have a theory that cars – especially luxury cars -are becoming over-engineered, overweight and overpriced. I have driven the standard version of the Q45 and I like it better than the Q45a test car.\n\nHere’s why: The regular version provides world-class handling and it will do anything any normal, sane driver could ask of it.\n\nI don’t think the active suspen ion system, a bulky 250-pound piece of computerized machinery, adds that much to the Q45a’s overall road-worthiness. In a nutshell, the full-active suspension system keeps the body stable during high-performance maneuvers.\n\nWhen the Q45 is ordered with the full-active suspension system, Infiniti throws in traction control.\n\nThere comes a time when engineers have to assess a car’s performance with the environment in which it will be driven. In Germany, where there are no speed limits on the Autobahn, maybe one could make a case for the full-active suspension. But here, when one legally can go only 65 mph, the system isn’t needed.\n\nThat said, I found the test car to be agile and athletic and able to remain poised under all circumstances. But I found the same traits on the standard model, too. And it seemed faster because it was lighter.\n\nUnderneath, there’s a near-perfect power-assisted rack and pinion steering system and a powerful set of four-wheel, anti-lock disc brakes. Front and rear suspension is independent.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nEven though the original Q45was a dud, it did have something going for it that few other autos can match.\n\nSince it first came out, the Q45 has been one of the world’s best-built cars, according to numerous owner surveys.\n\nThe 1994 model is likely to uphold or enhance that tradition. Our test car’s build-quality can be summed up with just one word: flawless.\n\nSo far, I’ve mentioned the new Q45’s exterior improvements, but there’s been plenty of refurbishing inside, too. There are classy-looking highly polished wood inserts on the console and doors.\n\nAnd that great-looking, old-fashioned gold accented clock from the Q45’s smaller sibling, the J30, has been planted on the dash between the air-conditioning vents.\n\nAlso, Infiniti has redesigned the eight-way power adjustable seats. The seats are extremely firm, though the leather seems softer and better-looking.\n\nNeedless to say, the Q45a comes with just about every power accessory known to man. It ought to for $54,000 and change.\n\nThanks to its face lift, the new Q45 goes where no other Japanese luxury car has been. It has styling that is classy, elegant and original. In 1994 the Infiniti Q45 ranks as one of the world’s finest luxury cars.\n\nTruett’s tip: Thanks to a major face lift and an improved interior, the new Q45 can now be considered one of the world’s best luxury cars.",

      "expert_review": "Q45 is all about power but suffers from tech toy overload\n\nIs too much technology a badthing? A world-class luxury sedan like Nissan Motor Co.’s 2004 Infiniti Q45 has to make you wonder. We love features like the standard RearView Monitor, which could help prevent backing over trash cans and toddlers. But the controls and center-mounted video display for climate and audio systems are way too confusing, and we never did quite get the hang of the voice-recognition system.\n\nAnd, yes, we do know how to program our VCR.\n\nWe tested the standard Q45 luxury sedan, priced at $52,945, including a $545 destination charge. The only option on our test vehicle was a $60 trunk mat.\n\nHE: I was a big fan of the original Q45 when it landed here back in 1989. Now that car didn’t look or feel anything like the competition. But over the last 15 years, two things happened to Infiniti’s flagship sedan. It got way more amenities and technology. And it lost an awful lot of its edgy personality. That’s not necessarily a bad thing. Today’s Q is one of the nicest, most luxurious premium sedans on the market, at a surprisingly attractive price — if you’re in the market for a $50,000-plus vehicle. Most people who are prepared to spend that kind of money, however, don’t want their wheels to get lost in a crowd. And therein lies one of my biggest complaints with the Q45. The technology barrier is also a concern.\n\nSHE: The style barrier is an even bigger concern to me. We live in a fabulous neighborhood of auto executives who often bring their own test cars home. The week we had the Infiniti was the same week that one of our neighbors brought home a brand-new 2005 Cadillac STS. I found myself wishing that the bland Q45 was as sexy and stylish as the STS. I also know from the doctors in our neighborhood that they love the Infiniti because it’s a stealth luxury car. It doesn’t scream money. So you have to decide what kind of person you are — ostentatious like me or low-key like our doctor-neighbors.\n\nHE: Hey, most of those docs are still into power, and the Infiniti is all about power. One of the car’s most impressive features is the powertrain, which is an area where Nissan and Infiniti really have excelled in recent years. Under the hood of the Q45 is a big, twin-cam, 4.5-liter V-8, which makes 345 horsepower and 333 pounds-feet of torque. It’s coupled with a smooth-shifting five-speed automatic that has a manual-shift mode. The combination is powerful and quite pleasant — just right for high-speed, long-distance touring. Fuel economy is only so-so, at 17 miles per gallon in city driving and 23 on the highway.\n\nSHE: I thought the instrument panel was a mess, especially that video-arcade display in the center stack. Too hard to figure out how to work the climate controls and the audio system. Thank goodness the RearView Monitor — which uses a small camera mounted near the rear license plate — comes on automatically when you put the car in reverse. This is a feature that should be mandatory on tall SUVs and minivans. But I never figured out how to get the Infiniti’s voice-recognition system to work. I’m philosophically opposed to any vehicle that requires a tutor to help you understand how to operate the basic systems. This is a complaint we’ve heard from other consumers — including at least one physician — about the Q45.\n\nHE: We haven’t really talked about all the things that are just right on the Q45. The bird’s-eye maple trim is exquisite. The seats are simply sensational — comfortable and supportive. There is all kinds of room, especially for rear passengers. The car’s suspension is supple, and the ride is controlled without feeling overly firm. I really did enjoy putting miles and miles on the Q45.\n\nSHE: You have to compliment Infiniti for all the terrific standard safety features. In addition to the rear-view camera, the Q45 comes with front and rear de-curtain air bags, plus front-seat active head restraints that help reduce whiplash. Even the rear seats have adjustable headrests. You also get antilock brakes with emergency brake assist, plus traction control and stability control. If you want to stretch the point, the “Gatling gun” xenon headlamps, with seven tubelike lenses on each side, are also a safety feature because they really illuminate the road at night.\n\nHE: I have to admit that I’m not the target demographic for the Q45, and not just because I lack an M.D. If I had $50,000 to spend, I’d probably be looking at a BMW and possibly a Mercedes, partly because of the cachet associated with those older European brands and partly because I love driving BMWs in general. But if you’re into that “stealth wealth” mode that Anita talked about, you’ll feel just as pampered, with very little sacrifice in performance, in the Infiniti Q45.",

      "expert_review": "When Japan’s two biggest automakers fielded luxury cars a few years back,they took wildly different paths. While Toyota courted more traditionalbuyers, Nissan decided to eschew the traditional trappings of luxury-carstyling and went for a more sporting crowd.\n\nThe results were dramatic. Nissan had a lot more trouble selling InfinitiQ45s than Toyota did Lexus LS400s.\n\nNow, it seems, Lexus is the standard to beat. So Infiniti has released atotally reworked Q45, and it marks a distinct departure from the sporty,elegant design of the first generation.\n\nStart with the styling. The car looks handsome and substantial, but it’sreally an amalgamation of other marques’ luxury-style points. Up front, we seea British-style chrome grille that would look at home on an MG. Around theside, it’s a mixture of Cadillac Seville and Mercedes S-class, especially inthe C-pillar. The back end is reminiscent of an Acura.\n\nThe result is better than it might sound and the car looks better in personthan it does in photos. But it lacks the delicate, yet firm, styling of theoriginal.\n\nIf you were a fan of the original car’s smashing swept-curve dash, accentedby the delicately trimmed gold clock, you’re likely to be disappointed by thenew car’s conservative interior. While the original’s was artful, the new car,with its high belt line, typical design and liberal use of simulated wood trimis nice, if unexceptional.\n\nNot disappointing is the effortless power and comfort this car affords. Anew 4.1-liter, double-overhead-cam, 32-valve V8 produces 266 horsepower and278 pound-feet of torque. This engine is the strong, silent type, neverenticing you into using too much power, but letting you know it’s there if youneed it.\n\nIt’s especially strong at highway speeds. The automatic transmission is afour-speed unit, in a class where five-speeds are increasingly common. Thatsaid, the extra gear was never missed. Shifts were swift and soft. Thesuspension feels softer, too, although it’s still quite capable. There’s somebody lean in corners, but handling is neutral. Just don’t mistake it for asports sedan.\n\nBump isolation is good, and the power-assisted steering had some road feel,though it wasn’t particularly quick. As for safety, there are dual air-bags upfront, anti-lock brakes and a sophisticated traction control system thathandled wet weather with aplomb for a rear-wheel-drive vehicle.\n\nWhile you’re scooting around, you’ll find the leather-covered front bucketsto be wide, yet supportive. The French seams can hit you wrong, but seatcontrols were easy to use. The back seat is equally comfy. Front-seatpassengers don’t get a power door lock switch, side air-bag or separateclimate controls, but they get do get lots of space.\n\nThe 12.6-cubic-foot trunk will hold two bags of golf clubs, but packlightly for long trips. Overall, trunk space is about the same as last year.\n\nWhat Nissan has here is a luxury sedan aimed at a larger slice of theluxury car audience. Even if it’s not as enthusiast-oriented as before, itwill satisfy the luxury car buyer looking for something new and fresh.1997 INFINITI Q45TStandard: 4.1-liter double overhead cam V8, four-speed automatictransmission, speed-sensitive power steering, sport-tuned suspension, tractioncontrol system, four-wheel power disc brakes with anti-lock, viscous limitedslip differential, five-spoke alloy wheels, front blacked-out grille, powersunroof, heated remote outside mirrors, carpeted trunk with net, simulatedwood trim, leather 10-way power front bucket seats, front and center armrests,front and rear cupholders, heated front seats, carpeted floor mats, automaticclimate control, 200-watt eight-speaker Bose audio system with cassette and CDplayer, power antenna, power tilt/telescoping steering wheel, power doorlocks, power windows, power mirrors, fuel filler and trunk releases,vehicle-speed-sensitive intermittent windshield wipers, cel ular phonepre-wiring, keyless entry.Options: NoneBase price: $49,900As tested: $50,395EPA rating: 18 city, 24 highwayTest mileage: 19 mpg",

      "expert_review": "It smells of good leather and fine carpeting. It is the odor of wealth, which is appropriate, considering the nature of the car, the 2000 Infiniti Q45 sedan.\n\nThe Q45 is a richmobile, the top of the line at Infiniti, Nissan Motor Co.’s luxury division.\n\nThe car is in its 10th year and second iteration, which is a softer, plusher version of its former self.\n\nI prefer the original Q45, which came with a muscular 278-horsepower V-8 and an exceptionally nimble suspension system. That car competed well against BMW and Mercedes-Benz performance sedans.\n\nBy comparison, the current Q45 is a Rolls-Royce without portfolio, a gilded chariot for the mini-mansion class. As such, it is better suited to the pampered traversal of highways than it is to hard running and heavy breathing. It should come with a sign: “No Sweat Allowed.” It also should come with a chauffeur as standard equipment.\n\nInfiniti tried to put more pizazz into a touring edition of the car, the Q45t. It added larger tires and wheels &#151; 17-inch diameter for the Q45t vs. 16 inches for the tested base model. It also gave the “t” version a driver-adjustable, electronically controlled suspension system. Those extras offer better handling, which should help you maintain vehicular and personal composure while being left in the wake of a 5-series BMW.\n\nAh, but what am I complaining about? The Q45 coddles. Its supple Cordova leather seats hug and massage the body. Even the eight-way power controls in the front seats are friendly. Normally, I hate power-operated seats, especially those with automatic settings. They seem to have minds of their own. But the seats in the Q45 do exactly as they’re told.\n\nIt’s easy, with all of this, to forget that the front-engine, rear-drive Q45 is no Autobahn screamer. That’s because the passenger cabin relieves performance anxiety. It’s laden with standard goodies, including one-touch automatic front windows with a safety reverse mechanism; a Bose 200-watt, eight-speaker sound system with an in-dash CD player; a gold-rimmed, Tiffany-type analog clock and a power-operated rear sunshade.\n\nThe one aesthetic disappointment in the whole affair is Infiniti’s use of plastic wood inlays &#151; on the door panels, center console and steering wheel &#151; in the base Q45. A special 10th-anniversary edition of the car gets real burled walnut. Hmph. I guess there’s class discrimination even within the upper class.\n\nStill, I enjoyed my drives in the test mobile, especially along some relatively traffic-free back roads in Maryland. What it lacks in alacrity, the Q45 possesses in confidence. It moves resolutely, quietly &#151; so quietly, it is sometimes difficult to hear its 4.1-liter, double-overhead-cam, 32-valve V-8 engine.\n\nThat engine develops 266 horsepower at 5,600 rpm and 278 pound-feet of torque at 4,000 rpm. It pulls two tons of weight &#151; 4,007 pounds, to be exact. Much of that weight rides atop a four-wheel-independent suspension system designed with McPherson struts, stabilizer bar and subframe-mounted coil springs up front and a similar arrangement in the rear.\n\nBrakes include power four-wheel discs, vented front and rear, with standard antilocks.\n\nIn 2002, Infiniti will roll out a completely redone Q45 &#151; a sportier, more powerful version that is more akin to the original. It was on display at the 2000 New York International Auto Show, and it looked really good. I eagerly await its production. Gentility, though seductive, was never my thing.\n\nNuts &amp; Bolts\n\n2000 Infiniti Q45\n\nComplaints: The current Q45 was designed when both Nissan and Infiniti were losing their collective way, desperately trying to figure out who, what and why they were. The upshot of that soul-searching was a raft of me-too products, shameless imitations of rivals or betters. The current Q45, which has more than a few Rolls -Royce cues, especially along the side panels, was a product of that turmoil.\n\nPraise: What’s amazing is that the current car turned out as well as it did. It is extremely well crafted, and if you’re more into plush than rush, you should feel quite at home in this one.\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: Pleasant ride, unexceptional acceleration, competent handling.\n\nHead-turning quotient: People oohed and aahed. What can I say? Americans remain impressed by royalty.\n\nCapacities: Seats five. Fuel tank holds 21.4 gallons (premium unleaded gasoline is required). Cargo volume is 12.6 cubic feet.\n\nMileage: Barely 23 miles per gallon in mostly highway driving.\n\nPrice: Base price is $50,595. Dealer invoice price on base model is $44,939. Price as tested is $51,120, including $525 destination charge. Price does not include applicable fees and taxes, including the federal luxury tax.\n\nPurse-strings note: A solid, full luxury car. Compare with Lexus LS400, Acura RL, BMW 5-Series, Mercedes-Benz E-Class, Cadillac DeVille DTS, 2000 Oldsmobile Aurora, Lincoln LS.",

      "expert_review": "Infiniti is entering its 10th year as Nissan’s luxury marque. Yet its identity doesn’t seem as clearly focused as its chief rival Lexus. Part of that problem has been its flagship — the Q45.\n\nInitially this grille-less wonder was introduced in a series of commercials featuring rocks and trees rather than the car itself. Then Nissan ditched the belt-buckle that adorned the front end and replaced it with a grille.\n\nThen they redesigned the Q that made it look more like a Lincoln than some of the new Lincolns.\n\nI like Lincolns, so I greatly admire the style of this car, but it doesn’t say Infiniti. It also holds little relation to the previous Q.\n\nSo, the Nissan stylists went to work, lessening the amount of chrome used up front, replacing the standard headlamps with high-intensity discharge headlamps. The rear gets a sophisticated styling revision that modernizes the look of the taillamps that gives it a visual connection to other Nissans, particularly the Altima.\n\nBut, everything else remains the same — the handsome body crease, the flying buttress style C-pillar, the side glass that resembles an S-Class Mercedes. It’s handsome, substantial, sharp and expensive-looking. Twice while I had it, I was asked how I liked my new Lincoln. Clearly, Nissan needs to do more work here.\n\nCertainly when driving this car, no one will mistake it for a Lincoln. The 4.1-liter 32-valve double-overhead-cam V-8 develops a healthy 266 horsepower and 278 pound-feet of torque and drives the rear wheels through a four-speed automatic transmission. A limited slip-differential and traction control also are included to help control wheel-spin in rotten weather.\n\nThis powerful automobile is the strong silent type. Like many overhead-cam engines, the power builds just above 10 or 15 mph or so. There’s not a ton of speed off the line, yet 0-60 doesn’t take very long. The four-wheel independent suspension provides an excellent ride, especially on the Q45t — the “t” stands for touring. It also means the driver gets a suspension that’s electronically modulated through auto or sport settings. The system eliminates excess body movement by measuring G-force and steering-angle input. From there it adjusts the shock valving appropriately. The driver can adjust for a softer of firmer ride.\n\nWhile the soft ride is as soft as any import buyer would like, it doesn’t rob the car of its sportiness. This car can still be blasted through turns, albeit with body lean. The sport setting firms the ride, as you might expect, and it can be a bit jarring over the third-world roads of most inner cities. The speed-sensitive power steering seemed just right for the vehicle.\n\nThe four-wheel anti-lock disc brakes worked extremely well, bringing this car to a stop in a hurry with no discernable brake fade and just a smidgen of dive.\n\nThe Q45t replaces the standard P215/60R16 all-season radials with sportier, low profile P225/50R17 tires mounted on truely awesome 17 -inch five-spoke aluminum alloy wheels. These provided excellent grip under dry conditions, but called for care when driving on a wet surface.\n\nInside, the big news is the return of the gold-trimmed analog clock. (as you can tell, there’s not a lot of really exciting news inside for ’99). The clock lends an air of class that digital clocks will never attain. The other big news is the addition of a rear power sunshade. This gadget seems to be helpful on scorching summer days, blocking the sun, yet affording a view out through the black mesh sunshade that’s activated by a dash-mounted switch.\n\nThe rest of the interior is classy and well-designed with an equally substantial look. There’s less wood trim this year, and climate and audio controls have a revised appearance.Since the climate controls are set-and-forget affairs, you’ll rarely use them anyway. They were so effective, they are almost unnoticable.\n\nThe stereo was awesome, giving one the option of playing CDsv ia a trunk-m ounted changer, as well as through a dash-mounted player. Very convenient. The leather seats were comfortable and came with seat heaters. One passenger noted they thought the leather could have felt richer for the price.\n\nIt’s only when one lives with the car after driving other luxury vehicles, that a lack of certain items becomes apparent. While there are memory settings for seats and whatnot, there are no dual climate controls or multi-function trip computer. Some might say this is Infiniti’s less-is-more design philosophy, a holdover from the original Q and more in standing with German luxury tanks. But Mercedes and BMW both have these as well, so why not Infiniti?\n\nThe only other item to note is the relatively small 12.6-cubic-foot trunk. That’s on a par with most sub-compacts, and considering the car’s 199.6 inch length, it should be bigger.\n\nBut this car never drives as big as it feels, something that can’t be said of a Lincoln. It’s small turning radius made this big car maneuverable in tight spaces.\n\nSo it’s big, fast, handles well and can only hold a couple small suitcases. So what’s the big deal?\n\nNothing. It’s a really nice luxury car. But its image is about as clear as Clinton’s definition of sexual relations.\n\nThis is a problem in a luxury car, since a luxury car is all about image.\n\nSomebody call in the spin doctor.\n\n1999 Infiniti Q45t\n\nEngine: 3.3-liter SOHC V-6 Transmission: 4-speed automatic Tires: P225/50R17 Standard: Variable assist power rack-and-pinion steering, electronically modulated shock absorbers, four-wheel disc anti-lock brakes, automatic headlamps, spoiler, rear defroster, glass sunroof, power front seats, leather seating surfaces, driver’s seat memory, wood trim, automatic climate control, power windows and door locks, cruise control, power tilt/telescopic steering wheel, automatic rearview mirror, cellular phone prewiring, 200-watt Bose AM/FM/cassette/CD audio system, dual front air-bags.

      "expert_review": "Infiniti’s new Q45 flagship reflects the soul of the original Q. Sometimes the way to the future lies in the past. Just ask Infiniti.\n\nThe all-new third-generation Q45, clearly a giant step forward, mirrors the performance image of the original Q, yet it is wrapped in the kind of graceful, muscular styling fitting for a flagship vehicle. The combination of power and elegance sets a tone that will be reflected throughout the rest of the vehicle line as the company seeks to refocus the brand with six new products in the next few years.\n\nRemember the first Q45? It hit the market about the same time as the Lexus LS 400 and Acura Legend. It had a robust engine, 278 horsepower and no grille. For a luxury car, its cabin was relatively austere. The seats were firm and covered with tightly stretched leather. Not one sliver of wood trim could be found anywhere. A tiny, analog clock sat proudly in the center of the dash. Unlike its Japanese competitors, the original Q had a definite performance personality. It was a driverÕs car, not a luxury cocoon. As succeeding generations evolved, the performance edge was dulled. It gained a chrome grille and more traditional styling. It never seemed to know exactly what kind of car it was supposed to be.\n\nNow, more than a decade later, the Q is back with a purpose and a clear identity. The 2002 goes Òback to the soul of the original,Ó said Steve Kight, director of marketing, and it was developed under a philosophy summed up with two letters: NE. No Excuses. That explains why an all-new 4.5-liter V-8 engine with 340 horsepower was developed for it, and why options include future-tech items such as a rear-vision video camera that projects an image on the instrument panel when the transmission is put into reverse.\n\nAs a flagship, the new Q is placed at the top of the Infiniti product pyramid where it can act as a beacon for the brand. Prices start at $50,500, and the vehicle goes on sale April 1. Sales, said Kight, are expected to be on the order of 10,000 to 15,000 a year, depending on demand. Volume sales will come from a production version of the rear-drive XVL concept car, for example, but no date has been announced for its introduction.\n\nA new direction demands fresh styling, and this model doesnÕt look anything like past ones. The roofline is low and sleek, while the front is dominated by huge light clusters that include revolutionary high-intensity-discharge headlights that have seven small lenses arrayed like a Gatling gun. Aside from creating a unique look, these lights, according to Infiniti, are the most powerful in the world and spread the light so accurately that fog lights are no longer needed.\n\nLuxury is obvious throughout the vehicle. The interior reflects a hand-crafted look with soft leather and blonde, natural or graphite colored birds-eye maple trim. A vehicle information system, as well as the optional navigation system and rear-vision video camera, plays through a color L CD screen in the center of the instrument panel. The 300-watt stereo from Bose even has noise-compensating technology for a pure sound.\n\nThe new DOHC V-8 has its roots in the Infiniti Indy Racing League engine. It has four valves per cylinder, lightweight pistons, titanium valves, continuously variable valve timing and a variable length induction system. Infiniti says it yanks the vehicle to 60 miles per hour in 5.9 seconds, which is quite quick for a sedan of this size. The transmission is a five-speed automatic that can also be shifted manually.\n\nBrakes are vented discs at each wheel, and of course, anti-lock is standard. An electronic system automatically distributes braking force from front to rear depending on load, which Infiniti says shortens stopping distances by 10 to 15 percent. A brake assist system applies maximum braking force in a panic stop even if the driver does not. A vehicle stability program is standard, too.\n\nThe 113-inch wheelbase is two inches lon than the current model, yet overall length remains roughly the same. It rides on a fully independent suspension that uses aluminum control arms to save weight. The rear suspension is derived from that in the Skyline GT-R. The standard suspension is tuned to deliver crisp handling but a sport suspension is also optional. Seventeen-inch wheels are standard, 18-inchers optional.\n\nIn addition to front and side airbags, a full-length curtain airbag inflates over the side windows for head protection in case of a side impact. Fixed anchors for child safety seats are built in, as well.\n\nThree option packages are available: sport, premium and navigation. The sport package costs $1,500 and consists of active damping suspension, 18-inch wheels and graphite wood trim. The premium package, $8,000, includes the active damping suspension and 18-inch wheels from the sport package, rear video monitor, power reclining rear seat, rear window sunshades and rear-seat controls for cooling and audio. The navigation package, $2,100, is a DVD-based navigation system.\n\nI will have a regular test-drive once production vehicles are available.\n\nPrice\n\nThe base price is $50,500.\n\nWarranty\n\nFour years or 50,000 miles.\n\nTo get in touch with Tom Strongman, send e-mail to tstrongman@kc.rr.com.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\nEngine: 4.5-liter V-8\nTransmission: automatic Rear-wheel drive\nWheelbase: 113 ins.\nCurb weight: N/A\nBase price: $50,500 As driven: n/a Mpg rating: n/a",

      "expert_review": "The new Q45 Infiniti flagship is a curious mixed bag of delights and frustrations. It seems as if it was designed by a number of committees who didn’t communicate particularly well.\n\nThe exterior styling team, to my eyes, was at pains not to make too strong a statement, and they evidently think a lot of the Chrysler New Yorker’s shape.\n\nThis is the mid-luxury segment, where a little more latitude is available than in the next class up, where the restraint associated with Old Money is expected.\n\nThe Q45, now entering its third generation, has formidable competition in this, the 50-grand-plus arena. Think Lexus LS430, BMW 540i, Mercedes-Benz E-Class, none of them, to be sure, a striking shape, but perhaps better realized than the Q.\n\nThe idea here is create a luxurious environment, easily perceived by the unwashed, with the dynamics necessary to allow at the least the illusion of 95th percentile performance, that term being broadly taken.\n\nAnd indeed, the big Infiniti comes with an impressive set of numbers. The current edition is exactly the same length overall as its predecessor – about 4 gold cards’ thickness shy of 200 inches – but is more cab-forward, incorporating 1.6 more inches between front and rear axles. It’s also nearly an inch wider and a bit taller than the Gen II machine, all of which makes for a more stable platform with more interior space.\n\nAnd oh, what an interior. Luscious wood and leather, electroluminescent instruments, stunning stereo, class-leading navigation system . . . what’s wrong with living in a car?\n\nI should interject at this point that the Q45, right out of the box, is loaded with all the power assists and amenities one expects at the $50K level. However, one might well consider transforming it into something really special with the $8,000 premium package, with which the tester was endowed. This gets you an active damping suspension system, long an Infiniti speciality; 18-inch alloy wheels with champagne finish instead of the standard 17-inchers, with 45 profile tires instead of 55; a DVD-based navigation system with integrated vehicle information system, whose screen has been upgraded to 7 inches from the standard 5.8; a RearView monitor; power reclining rear seats; heated front and rear seats; rear audio and climate controls; a power rear sunshade and manual rear-window sunshades.\n\nThe very coolest among all these desideranda is the rearview monitor. It’s a color TV camera mounted near the rear license plate. It kicks in automatically when the car is put into reverse, projecting a relatively low-resolution but eminently usable color image onto the vehicle info screen. It incorporates electronically-generated grid lines to give the driver an idea of where the boundaries of the car are.\n\nI found it was sufficiently sensitive to provide a usable picture at night when the only illumination was from the car’s own taillights and backup lamps.\n\nThe navigation system is also noteworthy. It is DVD-based, as are most these days, meaning it packs enough data to cover the whole contiguous 48 states down to street level. Early systems used CD-ROMs, and one had to use as many as 6 for that coverage – oh, how last millennium.\n\nThe really distinguishing feature of this nav system, however, is its three-dimensionality. Most of these systems are like looking at a scrolling, two-dimensional map. The Q45’s is like cruising over the terrain at 1,000 feet, with streets superimposed on the view.\n\nThe drawing gets a bit vague away from civilization, but near built-up areas, one senses the land contours and there are cartoonish icons for things like gas stations, eateries and city halls, or even a zoo.\n\nIt’s quite useful and entertaining, although it follows the general practice at each startup of making the operator agree not to fiddle with it while underway. Yeah, right, although this one attempts to circumvent that paradox by employing voice recogn technology.\n\nMany functions, including the radio, are controllable by vocal instructions, or so the theory goes. It had enough trouble with my dulcet tones that I soon wished for a more straightforward set of knobs and pushbuttons, which would not require taking one’s eyes off the road to manipulate.\n\nOne other interesting datum furnished on the color screen was a readout for the tire pressure at each wheel. (An alarm is sounded if pressure gets too far out of line.) It agreed with the pressures I had hand set, and also reflected the rise in pressure that comes with elevated velocities. Slick, and the next step, I suppose, is developing a system that keeps pressures at a specified number.\n\nSo much for the static view of this luxocar. It is, after all, a transportation device, and as such, is more grossly overqualified than ever.\n\nThe engine is a 4.5-liter, 32-valve V-8. This replaces last year’s 4.1, thereby returning legitimacy to the vehicle’s name, and makes an impressive 74 more horsepower and 55 more foot-pounds of torque. The new numbers are 340 hp (@6,400 rpm) and 333 foot-pounds (@4,000). ThatÕs sufficient, I found, to propel the 3,801-pound machine to 60 mph from a standing start in about 6.5 seconds – a sprint worthy of a sporty car. The real fun is in the domain of 70-120 mph, where the responsiveness of the rev-loving engine is really impressive. The power is sent to the rear wheels via a five-speed electronically-controlled transmission. This was one of the smarter gear-changers I’ve encountered, seeming to pick the correct gear for most circumstances and effecting changes with a fluid ease. It was a little resistant to the notion of forced downshifts, but quickly adapted to the test driver’s propensity for exploring the trans-6,000 part of the tachometer.\n\nNeedless to say, the Q wants premium fuel, and in generous quantities, although it does avoid the “gas guzzler” penalty. EPA estimates are 17 mpg city, 25 highway. My log shows 19.7, reflecting a rather adventurous style of motoring.\n\nIn its handling, the Q45 put me in mind of a Toyota Camry – it does better than one would think, given the absence of communication with the driver.\n\nEquipped with both traction control and stability control, it was amenable to being tossed about with some vigor. The stability control (here called Vehicle Dynamic Control) uses an array of sensors and a microprocessor to invoke power diminution and selective brake application to prevent the car from going into a slide when the driver’s demands exceed the realities of traction. When I switched off the stability control, I could get the rear end to come out, but recovery seemed a little sloppy.\n\nThe “active damping” suspension serves to provide a fine ride and a sense of stability on all kinds of roads. It works by sensing what’s going on between rubber and road and stiffening or easing the shocks to accommodate. It’s a pallid imitation of the old fully-active s uspension Nissan once employed to stunning effect on the Q45, but soon abandoned because of its complexity. The scaled-down system is still quite useful.\n\nThe Bose audio system was delicious as ever, though slightly disadvantaged by an in-glass radio antenna. And it’s hard to understand why the six-disc CD changer was relegated to the glove box, although I suppose it could be argued that’s much more convenient than the trunk.\n\nNeither the gummint nor the insurance people have smashed a 2002 Q45 yet. I’d be reasonably confident of surviving a crash, based on its mass, the front and side air bags and the new-for-2002 full-length side curtain air bags.\n\nA big plus in avoiding crashes is the braking system. Large vented discs front and rear, with antilock, of course, as well as brake assist, made for impressively short stopping distances with excellent pedal feel.\n\nThe research firm Edmunds says its price surveys indicate that you might be able to get a Q45 with th rmu package for about three grand off the sticker price. Some of the competitors may seem cheaper, but tack on as options some items included in the Q45’s sticker.\n\nThe tester, in addition to the big-bucks package, had a full-size spare tire/wheel ($180) and splash guards ($120), for a total, with freight, of $59,345. Payments on that would be $1,204, assuming 20 percent down, 10 percent interest and 48 installments.",
