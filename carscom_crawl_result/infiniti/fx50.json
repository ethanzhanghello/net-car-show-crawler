      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe original Infiniti FX explored the boundaries of sportiness in an SUV, though not without some drawbacks in utility. A 390-horsepower V-8 powers the FX50, while a 303-hp V-6 powers the FX35, which is covered in a separate report in the Cars.com Research section. A number of luxury SUVs, from the Lexus RX 350 to the Mercedes M-Class, compete with the FX. All-wheel drive is standard on the FX50.\n\nNew for 2011\nA power liftgate will become standard later in the model year, and black lacquer interior trim replaces maple accents as standard on the FX50.\n\nExterior\nThe FX’s beady headlights and snout-nosed grille are at least as controversial as those elements on its predecessor if not more so. Along the side, functional air vents reduce the FX’s lift, Infiniti says. Exterior features include:\n\n\nStandard 20-inch alloy wheels\nAvailable 21-inch alloy wheels\nStandard bi-xenon headlights\nOptional adaptive suspension continuously reacts to changing road conditions\nOptional Rear Active Steer angles rear wheels slightly to enhance turning precision\n\nInterior\nThe cabin has a high dashboard. A ledge just below the windshield curls around to the window sills, and air-conditioning and stereo controls sit below an available navigation display. The leather seats can come with quilted center inserts. Power adjustments for the front seats are standard. Interior features include:\n\n\nStandard reclining rear seat\nStandard Bluetooth\nStandard dual-zone climate control\nStandard power liftgate\nStandard USB input for MP3 players\nOptional heated and cooled front seats\nBose audio system with 2GB Music Box hard drive\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe FX50’s 5.0-liter V-8 makes 390 hp and teams with a seven-speed automatic transmission. Mechanical features include:\n\n\nPremium gas\nStandard all-wheel drive\n3,500-pound towing capacity\n\nSafety\nStandard safety features include active head restraints, side-impact airbags for the front seats and side curtain airbags for both rows. Traction control, an electronic stability system and four-wheel-disc antilock brakes are also standard. The FX50’s brakes sport four-piston, aluminum front calipers hardware that suggests serious stopping performance.  Safety features include:\n\n\nOptional lane departure warning system\nOptional adaptive cruise control\nOptional forward-warning system applies brakes in the event of an impending collision\nOptional Around View Monitor system uses four cameras to create a bird’s-eye view of the immediate surroundings",

      "expert_review": "The 2009 Infiniti FX50 is a hot rod on stilts! It’s a huge chunk of beautifully molded metal with eye-catching curves and sparkly accents. The FX50 is so unique-looking that it might take a little getting used to for some people. While I loved the extraordinary look of the FX50, most passers-by thought it was odd-looking and were surprised to learn that such a “weird” vehicle has such a high price tag. Perhaps the FX50 represents the equivalent of an automotive acquired taste.\n\nThe FX50 offers clues to let the average mom know that this car is more than your run-of-the-mill SUV. The first clue is its Infiniti badge, which is Nissan’s luxury brand. The second is the bold curves in its sheet metal.\n\nThe FX50 caught my eye earlier this year at an auto show, so I was excited to test drive it. I love its exaggerated features and somewhat intimidating size. I think the beauty of the FX50 is in its bold, outside-of-the-box character.\n\nFrom a performance perspective, the all-wheel-drive FX50 took me by surprise as I squealed the tires while pulling out of a parking space for the first time. With a standard V-8 engine, this car can haul! It’s powerful, fun to drive and surprisingly agile for its size. However, that engine sucks up the premium gas, getting an EPA-estimated 14/20 mpg city/highway. Add in the FX’s sport mode and paddle shifters, and I started wonder if the folks at Infiniti had made a mistake and put their sports-car guts into an SUV’s body. Could it be? Nah! Infiniti has just decided that driving an SUV should be incredibly fun, and I agree.\n\nThis SUV isn’t for everyone, especially families with teens who need lots of legroom in the second row. However, it’s worth the extra dollars if you value performance and appreciate driving something that’s a little different. This isn’t a run-of-the-mill SUV.\n\nExterior\n\nFrom the front, the FX50 has some bug-like features. The beady-looking, angled bi-xenon headlights are set far apart on the front end, creating a spooky, “I-just-might-bite” look. Tell the kids to leave their critter catchers in the house because from every other angle the FX50 is a gem.\n\nSwoops and swishes dominate the FX50’s profile. From swollen front-wheel wells to a steep downward curve behind the second-row window, my eyes were busy checking everything out. I loved the big tires (21-inch alloy wheels) and the funky-looking – yet functional – air vents that sit just behind each front tire.\n\nThe FX50 is a large SUV, but my 7-year-old had no problems opening the door on his own. His 4-year-old brother wasn’t able to reach the door handles. They both were able to climb in and past the partially integrated rocker panels, which means the door panels didn’t extend to the bottom of this SUV and my kids got a little dirty because of it. Fully integrated rocker panels keep mud and dirt from getting on your clothes when you get in and out of the car.\n\nI liked the FX50’s Scratch Shield paint that heals itself over time when it gets minor boo-boos. It’s a gel-like clear coat that knits back together when there’s a light scratch in it. The process can take as little as 15 minutes or as long as a week, depending on the outside temperature. I wouldn’t want to destroy the FX50’s lovely Mohave Copper Metallic finish with a slew of nicks and scratches. Thanks to Infiniti for helping protect this investment.\n\nThe only thing missing from the FX50’s exterior is a power liftgate. The key fob button merely unlocked the liftgate. This might be a minor item to some, but it’s a big deal to me considering the cost of the FX50.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Excellent\n\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Groove-On\n\nInterior\n\nThe FX50’s interior oozes the ambience of a trendy – yet luxuriously comfortable – lounge. It’s relaxed without losing any refinement with its quilted leather-appointed seats and hand-stained maple wood trim. In keeping with the sportier side of things, aluminum pedals glistened at my feet (secretly, this is one of my favorite touches).\n\nI was overwhelmed when I noticed all of the buttons on the center stack for the navigation and stereo systems. Darn! I hate it when cars are smarter than me. Once I started trying them out, I was pleasantly surprised to find that they were easy to use, and I didn’t need to open the owner’s manual.\n\nThe FX50 has standard heated/cooled front seats. It wasn’t that hot outside when I tested the FX, but I figured I’d give them a try since I’ve never experienced cooled seats before. Call me a prude, but I’m not a fan of cool air wafting around my unmentionables! Maybe I should have waited until it was hot out, but it felt like I was sitting on melting ice cubes.\n\nThe FX50 is the first car I’ve tested that comes with a built-in DVD entertainment system for the backseat. My kids figured out the entertainment system as well as its remote control and wireless headphones before I’d even buckled my seat belt! They loved this system and took their movie-in-the-car time seriously. They even made me pop a movie in for the short drive to the gas station and refused to exit the FX50 when we got home. Apparently they’d forgotten about the TV and DVD player in our house. At any rate, they enjoyed the novelty the FX50 afforded them.\n\nThe backseat has large, roomy seatback pockets on each side, and they hold more stuff than the average seatback pocket. The legroom in the second row wasn’t as plentiful as I’d expected for an SUV this size; my kids had enough legroom, but a taller teen or adult might not be comfortable back there during a longer ride. The backseat cupholders are easy to access in the pull-down center armrest.\n\nThe cargo area is a little less than ample. All of my groceries and must-haves fit in the back, but fitting groceries plus a stroller would be tough. However, there’s plenty of great features in the cargo area, including cargo netting and a first-aid kit.\n\nSafety\n\nI’m always a little deflated when crash-test ratings aren’t available for some of the cars – like the FX50 – we test at MotherProof.com. It keeps me from painting a complete picture of the car for you. However, I can say that Infiniti has packed a ton of safety features into the FX50.\n\nTraction control, stability control, antilock brakes and six airbags, including side curtain airbags for both rows, are all standard on the FX50. The SUV has several optional high-tech safety features, too.\n\nFor starters, the FX50 offers Lane Departure Prevention, which uses infrared technology to scan the road for lane markers. If the FX drifts out of its lane, it’ll lightly apply the brakes. The FX also uses infrared lasers to scan the road ahead and can apply the brakes if it senses an obstruction. The Distance Control Assist program advises you to slow down by pushing back lightly against your foot via the gas pedal if traffic ahead of you is slowing. An advance cruise control system can bring the SUV to a complete stop in bumper-to-bumper traffic.\n\nThe FX50 also has an Around View Monitoring system that allowed me to check around the entire vehicle for obstacles using strategically placed cameras. I was happy to have this feature since the FX50’s shape caused some visibility issues for me.\n\nIn the backseat, I was a little worried when I saw that the Latch connectors sat higher than usual from the seat bottom. One of my booster seats has rigid Latch clips built into it, and I wondered if the booster seat would work in the FX. Amazingly, it did work and the booster seat still sat flat – not at an angle as I had feared – on the seat bottom. Once the booster seats were in, the kids were able to buckle up without problems.\n\nParents who are using a rear-facing infant-safety seat will want to check its fit during a test drive. While an infant-safety seat will fit in the backseat, the front passenger’s seat will have to be moved forward to accommodate it, which will restrict the front passenger’s legroom.\n\nFAMILY LIFESTAGE\n\nIn Diapers: It might be a tight fit to get a rear-facing infant-safety seat installed, but other car seats should fit without any problems.\n\nIn School: The built-in entertainment system will entertain the kids on long – and short – rides.\n\nTeens: The backseat’s lack of legroom could lead to comfort issues for taller teens and adults.",

      "expert_review": "I’m not going to wax poetic about how great a family car the 2012 Infiniti FX50 is because it isn’t the most practical car for families due to its cramped second row and lack of cargo or storage space. But maybe practicality is overrated; if it isn’t your main concern, I highly recommend the FX50.\n\nApart from its pragmatic shortcomings, there is a lot to like with the FX50. Its looks are fresh and stand out in the crowd of conservative-looking midsize luxury SUVs. Its interior is filled with high-tech features and luxurious surfaces.\n\nBest of all, the 5.0-liter V-8 engine is a wonder. It forces you to let your hair down and have fun when behind the wheel. It quickly responds to your need for speed. This all-wheel-drive crossover handles curves, corners and mountain roads with equal enthusiasm. It makes driving to the grocery store wildly fun. It also makes driving the kids to school wildly fun, even if you do have trouble squeezing them into the FX.\n\nIts last major makeover was in 2009, and the 2012 FX50 sees many updates. The grille and front end have been redesigned and the gauges’ lighting also has been revised. Adaptive headlights are now part of the Sport Package.\n\nThe 2012 Infiniti FX50 has a starting MSRP of $59,350. Thanks to the addition of the Technology and Sport packages, my test car cost $66,545.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe midsize luxury crossover market has always struck me as lackluster looks-wise. The majority of cars in this class seem conservative in their styling. However, the 2012 FX50 is an original. It’s got flair with its aerodynamic detail, and the new grille and higher hood give it some edge.\n\nOther standard features that complete the FX’s look include 21-inch alloy wheels, automatic bi-xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights, heated side mirrors, a power liftgate — a practical offering for those of us with wee ones — and a power-sliding moonroof.\n\nMy 18-month-old couldn’t climb into the FX unassisted. My 3- and 5-year-olds could get in by themselves, but it was a struggle. My younger kids also had a difficult time opening the doors on their own in part because they lacked the strength needed to yank the door handles. My oldest child did manage to get the door open on his own.\n\nThe 390-horsepower, 5.0-liter V-8 engine begs to be driven. It growls as the automatic transmission works through its seven gears. My test car had the optional Sport Package ($3,100) that includes paddle shifters and Continuous Damping Control with Auto and Sport modes that elevates the driving experience by tightening or softening the suspension.\n\nIntelligent All-Wheel Drive with Snow mode is standard, and it came in handy since I drove the FX50 during an onslaught of heavy snow here in Colorado. It gets an EPA-estimated 14/20 mpg city/highway, and premium fuel is recommended.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Groove-On\n\nINTERIOR\nThe FX50’s cabin is filled with luxury. Since I find luxury to be completely practical — I don’t get enough of it in my daily life, I might add — I partially rescind my statement that this isn’t a practical family car. Maple wood trim and aluminum accents decorate the cabin with a mix of warmth and flair. A crystal-clear screen showcases the standard Around View Monitor, Bose audio system and navigation system. While the multitude of buttons on the center stack looks imposing, it’s intuitive to use.\n\nQuilted leather upholstery offers a balance of cushion and support for the driver and front passenger. Heated and ventilated front seats are standard. My test car also had optional thigh support for the front seats as part of the Sport Package. It’s a great option for longer-legged drivers.\n\nComfort in the second row isn’t as forthcoming because it’s cramped back there, and this is a large part of the FX’s impracticality. Taller passengers and those who have more than one child in a child-safety seat will suffer the most.\n\nAnother area of impracticality is the limited cargo and storage space. There are only four cupholders in this five-seat crossover. Aside from the small center console and small rear armrest cubby, there is a distinct lack of storage. Rear cargo volume is a miserly 24.8 cubic feet with the rear seats in use, but it expands to an improved 62 cubic feet with the rear seats folded. This is meager compared to the Lincoln MKX’s 32.3 cubic feet of cargo space or the 40 cubic feet that the Lexus RX boasts. But then again, when I compared the FX50’s looks and engine to those competitors, I started to feel OK again.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSAFETY\nThe FX50’s impractically continued when I tried to install child-safety seats in the backseat. The two sets of lower Latch anchors, which are in the outboard seats, are awkwardly embedded in slits in the leather. By awkward, I mean tough to find despite the slit and a pain to use. Two forward-facing convertible child-safety seats fit in the FX, but they leave little room for maneuvering. Three child-safety seats won’t fit in the second row, and the front passenger should be warned that he’ll be kissing the glove box if a rear-facing infant seat is installed behind him. Click here to learn how the FX performed in Cars.com’s Car Seat Check.\n\nThe FX50 is impressive when it comes to its other safety measures. It has standard all-wheel drive, active front head restraints, four-wheel-disc antilock brakes, an electronic stability system with traction control, and six airbags, including side curtains for both rows.\n\nWhat makes it stand out are its standard vehicle immobilizer system and Around View Monitor that makes a normal backup camera look shabby. The Around View Monitor uses four cameras to create side, top, front and back views of the car. Infiniti’s Personal Assistant service is free for four years with this car; it’s a 24-hour concierge service that’s useful in the event of an emergency, if you’re lost or if you simply want to find the nearest Indian restaurant. Even I’ll admit to some practicality in that.\n\nThe FX50’s brakes also merit attention. While testing this crossover I noticed their responsiveness. They’re equipped with four-piston front and two-piston rear aluminum calipers, which is car-geek speak for sporty and awesome.\n\nTo up the safety quotient, opt for the Technology Package ($2,900) with lane departure warning and prevention system, adaptive cruise control, intelligent brake assist with forward collision warning, and adaptive headlights.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2012 Infiniti FX50 here.",
