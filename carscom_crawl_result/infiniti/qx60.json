      "expert_review": "The verdict: The seven-seat 2016 Infiniti QX60 looks like a member of the premium SUV class with its runway-ready styling and posh, classy cabin, but its rough ride and unrefined transmission reveal it as a luxury imposter.\n\nVersus the competition: While the Infiniti QX60 out-styles most of its rivals, its competitors are quieter and have more polished road manners.\n\nFor 2016, the QX60 crossover gets a minor exterior styling update and some newly available safety features. Click here to compare it with the 2015 model. Click here to compare it with key competitors: the Acura MDX, Audi Q7 and Buick Enclave.\nExterior & Styling\nIt’s not easy for an automaker’s SUV to resemble its sexy coupes and sedans, but the QX60 does so. For 2016, designers tweaked its curves in all the right places. Though the styling update is subtle, it makes for a more fluid, dynamic look overall. Sleeker, sharper headlights, a plumper grille and a more chiseled face combine to give it an assertive stance. That attitude is matched in back with more angular taillights and a crisp bumper. Overall, it equals the Q7’s premium styling, and it’s trim and athletic compared with the plump Buick Enclave and generic Acura MDX.\nHow It Drives\nAround town, the carryover 265-horsepower, 3.5-liter V6 engine provides strong, no-nonsense power from a stop even when the SUV is loaded with people and gear. Pop it into Sport mode via a center console dial when you need more oomph; doing so grants quicker acceleration response and sprightlier takeoffs. Skip the tortoise-like Eco mode, however, which blunts acceleration to the point of annoyance.\n\nThe sole transmission is a continuously variable automatic and it delivers plenty of nonsense — loudly and frequently. Although the CVT does a convincing impression of stepped gears if you get hard on the gas, its near-constant drone is loud and awkward-sounding; it’s at odds with the car’s luxury intentions. Wind and road noise, however, are minimal.\n\nThe QX60’s road manners are also out of step. The Enclave and Q7 are quieter and have more refined-sounding engines, and others in the class deliver a smoother, cushier ride. The QX60’s ride is firm and rough, and larger bumps ripple through the cabin unsettlingly.  Maneuverability could be tightened, as well; the SUV leans in corners and is a chore to park, though the available around-view camera system reduces the stress of parking maneuvers.\n\nFuel economy is competitive. With all-wheel drive, the Infiniti QX60 AWD is rated 19/26/22 mpg city/highway/combined, besting the Buick Enclave (15/22/17) and roughly matching both the Acura MDX (19/26/22) and Audi Q7 (19/25/21).\n\nUnlike those competitors, the Infiniti QX60 offers a hybrid model. It uses a supercharged, 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine, a lithium-ion battery and an electric motor to generate a combined 250 hp. Fuel economy ratings are impressive for a vehicle this large, at 25/28/26 mpg, but the hybrid price premium is steep.\n\nInterior\nEvery time one of my three monster kids spills something on our crusty old couch, I’m reminded of every parent’s favorite mantra: “This is why we can’t have nice things.” An exception should be made for the Infiniti QX60’s cabin. Not only do its upscale appointments add a touch of luxury to life’s messy, everyday grind, it’s also roomy and loaded with features that make parenting a bit easier.\n\nThe cabin nails the premium vibe with its classy wood trim, tufted leather seats and thoughtful details, like contrast stitching and piping on the seats and surfaces. It all feels good, too; elbow touch-points are amply padded and the seats are comfortably bolstered. Standard heated front seats and optional creature comforts like a heated steering wheel, cooled front seats, heated second-row seats and a two-panel moonroof that covers all three rows are big wins. The second row also features an optional dual-screen DVD entertainment system, though I question its usefulness — and longevity. It’s not Blu-ray compatible, and in the age of streaming videos and tablets, I doubt my kids know what a DVD is; I haven’t purchased one in years. I’ll take a pair of tablet holders instead.\n\nWith 41.7 inches of maximum legroom — several inches more than competitors — the second-row bench seat has ample room for two child-safety seats (see our Car Seat Check) and its flexibility is impressive. Both sides of the 60/40-split bench fold and slide forward, creating a large walkway to the third row. Also, the section behind the front passenger seat  can tip and slide forward with a forward-facing car seat installed. You’re out of luck if you have a rear-facing car seat or, in my case, a pair of them. The seat won’t tip or slide with one of those installed, making access to the third row tricky. I installed my first-grader’s booster in the third row and she had to awkwardly climb through the cargo area to reach it. Unfortunately, second-row captain’s chairs are not an option.\n\nLegroom in the two-position third row is also generous; with 30.8 inches it bests the Q7 (29.2) and MDX (28.1) but isn’t quite as roomy as the Enclave (33.2). It also features a couple thoughtful amenities, like two USB ports and four cupholders. More important, it’s also safe to install a forward-facing car seat back there thanks to the Infiniti QX60’s single third-row top-tether anchor; automakers are not required to include lower Latch or top-tether anchors in the third row.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nAlthough some editors called the Infiniti QX60’s multimedia system graphics dated (they are), looks aren’t everything. The bottom line is that the system is easy to use. The standard 7-inch screen (an 8-inch unit with navigation is optional) can be operated via touch or a combination of physical buttons and a rotary knob below the screen. I prefer to use the touch-screen; it’s responsive, and the system’s straightforward menu structure and visible “back” button make it easy to use. I especially appreciated the “status” button that brings you back to a summary screen displaying music and climate control settings.\n\nThat’s not to say the system couldn’t use an update, however. The tuning and volume knobs are set awkwardly low, and the Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration systems are not available. One other electronic miss: There’s only one USB port for the first two rows. That’s especially stingy given there are two in the third row. There is, however, a 120-volt outlet in the second row.\nCargo & Storage\nThere are plenty of small cubbies throughout the cabin, including a roomy center console and two-tier map pockets in the second row — great for stashing books or tablets … or, yes, even DVDs.\n\nBehind the third row, there’s 15.8 cubic feet of space, matching the MDX and besting the Q7. It’s enough for a grocery run’s worth of bags or a bulky double stroller, but the Enclave offers much more with 23.3 cubic feet.\n\nFolding the seats down for more room is easy, however, and getting them back up is even simpler if you add an optional power return feature that motors the third row upright with the push of a button, eliminating the awkward climb to grab a tether and yank the seat back up. With the third row down, the QX60 has 40.8 cubic feet of cargo space, again well shy of the Enclave’s 68.9.\nSafety\nThe 2016 Infiniti QX60 earned the highest possible score in Insurance Institute for Highway Safety crashworthiness and crash-avoidance testing, and five stars overall from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nA backup camera is standard; optional features include blind spot warning, lane departure warning and prevention, and an around-view camera system. Infiniti also said it’s updated its optional pre-crash collision warning system with automatic emergency braking; it works in forward and reverse and also detects pedestrians. These systems are bundled into pricey option packages, but as a mom who routinely parks near playing children, the assistance of the auto-brake features brings priceless peace of mind.\n\nAlso available is the Infiniti Connection emergency communication system. It includes safety features like roadside assistance, automatic crash notification, an emergency call button, stolen vehicle reporting, alarm notification, and remote door lock and unlock. The system also allows you to set geo-fences, curfew limits for driving time and speed limit alerts to help parents keep tabs on new teen drivers.\n\nClick here for a full list of safety features.\nValue in Its Class\nThe Infiniti QX60 starts at $43,595 for a base, front-wheel-drive model; add about $2,000 for AWD (all prices include destination). That’s a few hundred dollars cheaper than AWD versions of the similar body-type Enclave and MDX and considerably less expensive than the AWD-only Q7 ($55,750).\n\nPrice isn’t always a factor for luxury car shoppers, but if it is, you’ll find that the Infiniti QX60 delivers portions of the luxury SUV experience for a competitive price.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Every premium brand needs a luxury SUV, but that can lead to problems if it’s based on something less fancy. Such is the case with the 2017 Infiniti QX60. It started life as the new Nissan Pathfinder, a peppy, comfortable seven-seat family SUV with a reasonably powerful V-6 and plenty of room for people and stuff. Turning it into an Infiniti involved a lot of added luxury trimmings, a little more power, some retuned chassis bits and a higher price tag. But are these changes enough to justify its higher price tag? Do they make the QX60 competitive with vehicles like the Audi Q7, Buick Enclave and Acura MDX? They weren’t so successful last time around; have the new refinements helped?\n\nShared Proportions, Not Looks\n\nWhile the QX60 is based on the Pathfinder, Infiniti stylists have done an excellent job differentiating it visually. Folds and creases in the sheet metal, plus a feline grille and headlights, combine with the unique D-pillar shape to give the Infiniti QX60 a look all its own. It’s not unattractive, but it’s not going to win any car-show beauty contests now or down the road. Its looks are definitely tied to the rest of Infiniti’s lineup, sharing a lot of styling elements with the automaker’s smaller sedans and coupes.\n\nIt’s not easy to make a big, two-box shape look appealing, but it can be done. The Audi Q7 may be the best example of this, with its clean lines, simple curves and flush features. The new Buick Enclave (arriving for 2018) is similarly sleek without appearing ungainly. The Infiniti manages to be inoffensive, but I don’t find it as appealing as its competitors.\n\nRoom Aplenty\n\nThe seats in the first two rows are quite comfortable — big and supportive, with plenty of room. The front seats are heated, and cooling is available as part of an optional Deluxe Technology Package. The second row has optional heating elements only. The third row is easy to get into thanks to some nifty folding technology for the second row, but it’s a little tight back there; save it for kids or adults on short trips. Visibility is also quite good, with a very low dashboard and beltline that provide a sweeping view forward and to the sides.\n\nSadly, that’s where the interior praise ends. The layout of the buttons and switches defies logic, perhaps because the low dashboard minimizes reachable space. There are several switches placed down around the driver’s left shin — controlling things like the vehicle’s safety systems — that are invisible and unusable while driving. They’re even hard to see when stationary; you have to bend over and look around the steering wheel.\n\nAnd then there are things we might accept on a $36,000 Nissan that don’t cut the mustard on a $60,000 Infiniti. For instance, the QX60’s higher-mounted buttons are easier to use, but they look like they were lifted directly out of a Pathfinder; they’re not suited to the Infiniti QX60. The 8-inch multimedia system is also only partially refreshed: While the audio component is new, the navigation system isn’t, with graphics and resolution that feel dated compared with systems like Audi’s slick MMI, which features both rich graphics and Google Earth functions. At least there are plenty of USB ports — two data-capable ones for connecting personal electronics and three more for charging.\n\nNor is materials quality up to premium-brand snuff. The designs and shapes are only slightly different from the Pathfinder, and the sophistication of the designs is unimpressive. The doors, for instance, look like smooth plastic with a bit of faux wood glued to the middle. The graining on the soft upper dash pad doesn’t match the grain on the doors, and you can see the outline of the front passenger airbag in the dashboard; that hasn’t been the case in most premium-brand cars for well over a decade.\n\nWe found the Pathfinder’s interior to be acceptable if uninspiring. Pumping up the price for the Infiniti brings a new level of expectations, and the interior trappings aren’t commensurately better.\n\nFast but Not Fun\n\nThe Infiniti QX60 gets a little more power for its engine, a 3.5-liter naturally aspirated V-6 making 295 horsepower, up from the 284 the Pathfinder makes. Torque is up to 270 lb-ft, a slight bump from the Pathfinder’s 259. The has a continuously variable transmission, with a manual shift mode and programming that makes it behave like a traditional geared transmission in most driving situations. Front-wheel drive is standard, all-wheel drive optional.\n\nKeep the mode selector in Normal mode and you’ll be greeted with a responsive, peppy engine that moves the QX60 with surprising alacrity. The transmission is inoffensive, behaving mostly like you’d expect a CVT to behave — delivering power linearly, never feeling like it’s hunting for a gear. Switch the rotary selector into Eco mode, however, and the engine is emasculated in favor of fuel economy, creating such an awful driving experience that you’ll likely decide the fuel savings aren’t worth it. Sport mode is similarly unpleasant, but in the opposite direction: The changes to its shifting and engine response make it jumpy and skittish. Leave it in Normal and the QX60 is a happier beast.\n\nThe steering won’t make you all that happy, however. It’s ridiculously heavy at lower speeds, requiring more effort, presumably in an attempt to make it feel more substantial and responsive than the Pathfinder. Yet on the highway it’s darty and oversensitive, making it difficult to maintain a line in your lane without keeping two hands on the wheel at all times and paying very close attention.\n\nTwo bright points: Ride quality is an excellent mix of good control and supple bump-soaking ability, and the brakes are strong and confidence-inspiring. That well-tuned ride, combined with a quiet, well-insulated cabin, make the QX60 more pleasant for passengers than for the driver. The Audi Q7 is far better to drive, with a responsive powertrain and sophisticated chassis control that shames the QX60’s driving experience.\n\nAt least the CVT does well for fuel economy, delivering an estimated 19/26/22 mpg city/highway/combined with all-wheel drive — a competitive number for a big SUV with a large V-6 engine. It’s better than the Audi Q7’s much smaller and less-powerful turbocharged four-cylinder engine, which is rated 19/25/21 mpg, but is rated exactly the same as the 3.5-liter-V-6-equipped Acura MDX.\n\nImproved Safety Tech\n\nThe 2017 model year QX60 did quite well in crash tests, with top scores from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety across the board (with the exception of headlight performance, judged to be poor). The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration awarded the QX60 five stars overall.\n\nThe QX60 has an impressive array of optional safety features, much of it electronic-based collision prevention. There’s forward automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection; a 360-degree Around View Monitor with moving-object detection; rear parking sensors with brake intervention should an object be detected; blind spot warning and intervention; and even predictive forward collision warning that can detect if the car in front of the car in front of you is slowing.\n\nCarries Plenty of Stuff\n\nIn terms of size, the QX60 matches up well with the Audi Q7. The Infiniti has 15.8 cubic feet of room behind the third row and 40.8 cubic feet with the third row folded. There’s a maximum of 76.5 cubic feet with the second and third rows down. The Q7 is similar: 14.8, 37.5 and 71.6 cubic feet, respectively. If you need more room, upgrade to the Buick Enclave, which features a minivan-like 23.6 cubic feet behind the third row, and 58.0 and 97.6 cubic feet with the third and second rows stowed, respectively.\n\nStarts Cheap, Ends Pricey\n\nThe Infiniti QX60 is reasonably priced if you plan on going for a base model; that’s just $44,095 with FWD and $45,895 with AWD, including destination fee. Once you start adding option packages, however, you’ll see that price climb. My test vehicle included the Premium Package (Bose audio upgrade, memory seats, heated steering wheel, remote engine start, roof rails), the Premium Plus Package (navigation, 360-degree cameras, parking sonar, rain-sensing wipers), the Theater Package (rear entertainment system) and the Deluxe Technology Package (20-inch wheels, a further upgraded Bose audio system, heated and cooled front seats, a motion-activated liftgate, intelligent cruise control and more). The total: $60,045.\n\nCompeting vehicles that seat seven in luxurious accommodations can be had from a few other brands. The closest may be the Buick Enclave, which was redesigned for 2018 and base price is similar to the QX60. We haven’t driven one yet, but its amenities, luxurious appointments and space certainly make it comparable. You’ll spend more to get an Audi Q7 and likely end up with less car in terms of amenities, but it provides a superior luxury-driving experience — its materials quality, design and sophistication all put the QX60 to shame. The Acura MDX has nearly as much room as the Enclave, but it suffers from some similar issues as the QX60 in terms of luxury sophistication, with a lot of lesser Honda parts shining through the Acura veneer.

      "expert_review": "The 2015 Infiniti QX60 is arguably the most flexible option among a select group of seven-seat haulers that aren’t a massive SUV or a minivan.\n\nWhile you can definitely pack the crew in when needed (I fit three teen girls and two gangly teen boys inside to shuttle to a high school dance, with room left over), the QX60 doesn’t feel too large inside or out to head out to dinner with just my husband, or even while running errands on my own when the kids are in school.\n\nThe 2015 QX60, which was launched for 2013 under the Infiniti JX35 name, comes with either FWD or AWD. I drove an all-wheel QX60 that came loaded with an optional Technology Package, Deluxe Touring Package, Premium Package and Premium Plus Package. You can also opt into a hybrid version for a 24 percent improvement in fuel economy. Compare all the QX60 versions here.\n\nFor 2015, the QX60 remains relatively unchanged save a few modifications to interior and exterior color options and available tire packages. Compare this year’s model with the 2014 model here.\n\nIf the Infiniti QX60 isn’t a perfect fit for you and your family, you may also want to consider a Buick Enclave or Acura MDX. Compare them all side by side here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe QX60 is one of those rare crossovers that manages to walk the tightrope between form and function quite well. A sleek, stylized, modern look disguises what really is a highly usable interior; it’s a welcome relief for those who still can’t embrace the somewhat antiquated minivan stigma. Despite a functional space inside, the QX60 looks leaner than other three-row crossovers.\n\nFamilies with very small children who insist on independence might feel somewhat put out by the QX60’s relatively high 18.4-inch step-in height. My girls (ages 10, 12 and 14) commented a couple of times about the second row seeming higher to step into than they’d expect it to.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe AWD QX60’s 265-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 engine (with a CVT transmission) gets an EPA-estimated 19/26/22 mpg city/highway/combined. This bumps up slightly in the front-wheel-drive version to a combined 23 mpg and even higher to a combined 26 mpg in both the front- and all-wheel-drive versions of the QX60 hybrid.\n\nWhile the Infiniti QX60 was quite pleasant to drive, with light, nimble steering, I was expecting a smidge more of a carlike ride. While it doesn’t tip in corners like a large SUV would, I could definitely feel the vehicle’s height in its suspension. This is a picky observation, though, and one that might not be noticeable to the average buyer.\n\nThe Drive Select system in the QX60 allows you to choose between Snow, Eco, regular or Sport modes. Each does essentially what you’d think, but Eco was exceptionally sluggish; I opted for regular. Sport is noticeably sportier, naturally, but doesn’t help if you’re pinching fuel pennies (not that this particular type of vehicle is an ideal choice if that’s your top priority).\n\nInterior\nMy family definitely got a bit spoiled after a week in the QX60. When you first set foot inside this car, you’ll start to feel pampered by its swanky fit and finish. See — you can have nice things even after you have kids. (P.S., It might be time to remove the protective plastic covers off your sofa.)\n\nUpscale amenities abounded in my test vehicle, like heated and cooled front seats, heated second-row seats (my kids now claim they couldn’t possibly live without these in test cars from here on out) and that blissful winter must-have: a heated steering wheel. Just the heated front seats come standard.\n\nThe second row is split 60/40 and slides back and forth, creating more legroom wherever you need it. The QX squeezes in an impressive 41.7 inches of maximum legroom in the second row, which is more than the Acura MDX’s 36.6 and the Buick Enclave’s 36.8 inches.\n\nSecond-row passengers have a fold-down armrest in the center seat with two cupholders and a small open storage bin. Double bottleholders in each rear door up the storage ante, as do the innovative double-layer pockets on each of the front seatbacks.\n\nMy favorite feature in the QX60 is the access to the third row. Both sides of the 60/40-split second-row seats fold and slide forward, creating an impressive amount of space to slip into the third row. When shuttling my 14-year-old daughter and her friends to their Sadie Hawkins dance, I made the two boys sit in the wayback so the girls wouldn’t have to climb back there in their dresses. As it turns out, there wasn’t much extra “climbing” required to get back there. The boys said they had plenty of legroom. By the numbers, the QX60 has 30.8 inches of third-room legroom, the Acura MDX has 28.1 and the Buick Enclave tops them all with 33.2 inches.\n\nWhen it was time to get everyone out of the car, the boys were able to easily access the side lever to fold and slide the second-row seats again. They stepped out without any embarrassing trips or flubs in front of their peers and dates. Phew!\n\nInfiniti says easy access to the third row remains even if you have a child-safety seat installed in the second row. In this case, the second-row seat will still tip and slide forward to allow access to the third row. This claim should come with an asterisk, however. This feature is found only on the passenger side (the 40 percent piece of the split seat), and upon testing it a couple of years ago with myriad car seats, I found that it really works only with a forward-facing, five-point-harness car seat, or the rare low-back booster that’s installed using the Latch system (like the Clek Olli). Rear-facing car seats jam the seat, and unrestrained booster seats essentially get ejected.\n\nThird-row passengers have access to air vents as well as two cupholders on either side, and the optional panoramic moonroof that extends above both the second and third rows keeps the interior from feeling cavelike, though I felt a little slighted by the dinky one above the front row.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe 2015 Infiniti QX60 has a 7-inch display that can be operated via touch and/or a combination of physical buttons and a rotary knob below the screen. This type of operating system might be appreciated by those who prefer the tactile feedback of a button, but those of us comfortable with touch-screens might find the redundancy unnecessary.\n\nThe relatively large display is particularly helpful when referencing the backup camera (more on that in the Safety section below). At night, however, the large screen continues to glow even after turning the screen off and dialing down the brightness level as much as possible.\n\nAnd speaking of turning the screen off, that’s one hard button I do appreciate and used often in the QX60. Other systems might require you to stare at the screen and toggle through multiple menus to find the screen-off control, subsequently ruining your night vision exactly when you’re attempting to preserve it.\n\nBluetooth audio is an optional feature on the Infiniti QX60.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe Holy Grail in three-row crossovers is having enough space to fit people and stuff while maintaining a carlike ride. The QX60 surprised me with more room behind the third row than I was expecting. It has 15.8 cubic feet of cargo space, which is slightly more than the MDX’s 14.8 cubic feet. While you can find crossovers with more cargo space (the Enclave has 23.3 cubic feet behind the third row), my family and I found this to be more than sufficient for a weekly grocery run plus the kids’ dance bags.\n\nWhen extra storage space is needed, the third row folds flat by manually lifting the release levers on the seats themselves. Thankfully, my test car was equipped with a $3,450 Deluxe Touring Package, which offers a powered seatback-return feature for the third row. This makes the third row motor back up just by pressing a power button in the cargo area, eliminating the need to climb into the cargo space, grab a tether and try to heft the seat up while cursing your decision to wear a skirt that day. Thank you for that one, Infiniti!\n\nSafety\nThe 2015 Infiniti QX60 was named a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. In the institute’s tests, the Infiniti received the highest rating of good (on a scale of poor, marginal, acceptable and good) on the frontal small- and moderate-overlap and side-impact crash tests, as well as on roof-strength and head restraint and seats tests.\n\nA backup camera is standard in the QX60, and my test car also came equipped with a $3,000 Premium Plus Package that included, among other things, Infiniti’s multicamera Around View Monitor with Moving Object Detection and front and rear sonar. Although the picture displayed from the backup camera is slightly grainy, the fish-eye lens on the 7-inch screen gave me a wide view behind and out to the sides of the car. Quickly pressing the “change view” button on the touch-screen allowed me to split the view to show the backup camera on the left half and either the 360-degree bird’s-eye view or a curbside view with onscreen parking guides on the right, which is helpful for parallel parking.\n\nAround View Monitor is enhanced by Moving Object Detection: To quote my previous JX35 review, if someone or something is moving around the car — say, a child or the neighbor’s cat that uses your garden as a litter box — visual and audible warnings will let you know where the moving object is so you can wait for it to clear before you move. This sounds like a great feature; I thankfully had no opportunity to use it, as there weren’t any children behind my test car during my week of driving, and apparently my neighbor’s cat has either died or found a new litter box.\n\nThe $2,800 Technology Package on my test car also offered backup collision intervention (again, a feature I happily didn’t test), a system that can automatically apply the brakes while you’re reversing to help avoid a collision with Speedy McSpeedy trying to squeeze past you in the bookstore parking lot.\n\nAn emergency communication system (Infiniti Connection) is included free for the first year and includes roadside assistance, automatic crash notification, an emergency call button, stolen vehicle reporting, alarm notification, and remote door lock and unlock, among other things. This system also allows you to set geofences, curfew limits for driving time and speed limit alerts to help parents keep tabs on new teen drivers.\n\nBlind spot monitors that illuminate and alert you with a tone if you’re about to change lanes into another car are part of the Technology Package, but if you want the car to intervene for you and also help steer you away from merging into another car, you’ll have to activate this specific feature each and every time you drive. Other extra features you have to opt into with each drive are distance control assist and lane departure intervention.\n\nFamilies installing child-safety seats will find two sets of Latch anchors in the second row’s outboard seats, along with three tether anchors. The third row also has tether anchors, allowing you to install forward-facing child-safety seats in a pinch back there if needed using the seat belts. However, there are no Latch anchors in the third row.\n\nSee all the QX60’s standard safety features here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nMy first few days in the QX60, I have to admit to experiencing a bit of sticker shock. My test car came heavily loaded, with a heavily loaded price tag of more than $56,000 to match. However, when you start looking at specific features included in the packages that bumped the sticker up substantially from the $44,795 base price, they’re worth paying for (except for the “opt in” ones mentioned above, because I don’t think anyone will remember to do so each time they drive). In a perfect world, all safety features would be included standard in all cars, but that’s not the world we live in.\n\nWould I be willing to pay more for features that could help prevent a collision when driving with my kids in the car? It’s hard to argue against it. Would I be willing to pay more for upscale fit and finish blended almost seamlessly with familial function? I think I would.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Every premium brand needs a luxury SUV, but that can lead to problems if it’s based on something less fancy. Such is the case with the 2017 Infiniti QX60. It started life as the new Nissan Pathfinder, a peppy, comfortable seven-seat family SUV with a reasonably powerful V-6 and plenty of room for people and stuff. Turning it into an Infiniti involved a lot of added luxury trimmings, a little more power, some retuned chassis bits and a higher price tag. But are these changes enough to justify its higher price tag? Do they make the QX60 competitive with vehicles like the Audi Q7, Buick Enclave and Acura MDX? They weren’t so successful last time around; have the new refinements helped?\n\nShared Proportions, Not Looks\n\nWhile the QX60 is based on the Pathfinder, Infiniti stylists have done an excellent job differentiating it visually. Folds and creases in the sheet metal, plus a feline grille and headlights, combine with the unique D-pillar shape to give the Infiniti QX60 a look all its own. It’s not unattractive, but it’s not going to win any car-show beauty contests now or down the road. Its looks are definitely tied to the rest of Infiniti’s lineup, sharing a lot of styling elements with the automaker’s smaller sedans and coupes.\n\nIt’s not easy to make a big, two-box shape look appealing, but it can be done. The Audi Q7 may be the best example of this, with its clean lines, simple curves and flush features. The new Buick Enclave (arriving for 2018) is similarly sleek without appearing ungainly. The Infiniti manages to be inoffensive, but I don’t find it as appealing as its competitors.\n\nRoom Aplenty\n\nThe seats in the first two rows are quite comfortable — big and supportive, with plenty of room. The front seats are heated, and cooling is available as part of an optional Deluxe Technology Package. The second row has optional heating elements only. The third row is easy to get into thanks to some nifty folding technology for the second row, but it’s a little tight back there; save it for kids or adults on short trips. Visibility is also quite good, with a very low dashboard and beltline that provide a sweeping view forward and to the sides.\n\nSadly, that’s where the interior praise ends. The layout of the buttons and switches defies logic, perhaps because the low dashboard minimizes reachable space. There are several switches placed down around the driver’s left shin — controlling things like the vehicle’s safety systems — that are invisible and unusable while driving. They’re even hard to see when stationary; you have to bend over and look around the steering wheel.\n\nAnd then there are things we might accept on a $36,000 Nissan that don’t cut the mustard on a $60,000 Infiniti. For instance, the QX60’s higher-mounted buttons are easier to use, but they look like they were lifted directly out of a Pathfinder; they’re not suited to the Infiniti QX60. The 8-inch multimedia system is also only partially refreshed: While the audio component is new, the navigation system isn’t, with graphics and resolution that feel dated compared with systems like Audi’s slick MMI, which features both rich graphics and Google Earth functions. At least there are plenty of USB ports — two data-capable ones for connecting personal electronics and three more for charging.\n\nNor is materials quality up to premium-brand snuff. The designs and shapes are only slightly different from the Pathfinder, and the sophistication of the designs is unimpressive. The doors, for instance, look like smooth plastic with a bit of faux wood glued to the middle. The graining on the soft upper dash pad doesn’t match the grain on the doors, and you can see the outline of the front passenger airbag in the dashboard; that hasn’t been the case in most premium-brand cars for well over a decade.\n\nWe found the Pathfinder’s interior to be acceptable if uninspiring. Pumping up the price for the Infiniti brings a new level of expectations, and the interior trappings aren’t commensurately better.\n\nFast but Not Fun\n\nThe Infiniti QX60 gets a little more power for its engine, a 3.5-liter naturally aspirated V-6 making 295 horsepower, up from the 284 the Pathfinder makes. Torque is up to 270 lb-ft, a slight bump from the Pathfinder’s 259. The has a continuously variable transmission, with a manual shift mode and programming that makes it behave like a traditional geared transmission in most driving situations. Front-wheel drive is standard, all-wheel drive optional.\n\nKeep the mode selector in Normal mode and you’ll be greeted with a responsive, peppy engine that moves the QX60 with surprising alacrity. The transmission is inoffensive, behaving mostly like you’d expect a CVT to behave — delivering power linearly, never feeling like it’s hunting for a gear. Switch the rotary selector into Eco mode, however, and the engine is emasculated in favor of fuel economy, creating such an awful driving experience that you’ll likely decide the fuel savings aren’t worth it. Sport mode is similarly unpleasant, but in the opposite direction: The changes to its shifting and engine response make it jumpy and skittish. Leave it in Normal and the QX60 is a happier beast.\n\nThe steering won’t make you all that happy, however. It’s ridiculously heavy at lower speeds, requiring more effort, presumably in an attempt to make it feel more substantial and responsive than the Pathfinder. Yet on the highway it’s darty and oversensitive, making it difficult to maintain a line in your lane without keeping two hands on the wheel at all times and paying very close attention.\n\nTwo bright points: Ride quality is an excellent mix of good control and supple bump-soaking ability, and the brakes are strong and confidence-inspiring. That well-tuned ride, combined with a quiet, well-insulated cabin, make the QX60 more pleasant for passengers than for the driver. The Audi Q7 is far better to drive, with a responsive powertrain and sophisticated chassis control that shames the QX60’s driving experience.\n\nAt least the CVT does well for fuel economy, delivering an estimated 19/26/22 mpg city/highway/combined with all-wheel drive — a competitive number for a big SUV with a large V-6 engine. It’s better than the Audi Q7’s much smaller and less-powerful turbocharged four-cylinder engine, which is rated 19/25/21 mpg, but is rated exactly the same as the 3.5-liter-V-6-equipped Acura MDX.\n\nImproved Safety Tech\n\nThe 2017 model year QX60 did quite well in crash tests, with top scores from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety across the board (with the exception of headlight performance, judged to be poor). The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration awarded the QX60 five stars overall.\n\nThe QX60 has an impressive array of optional safety features, much of it electronic-based collision prevention. There’s forward automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection; a 360-degree Around View Monitor with moving-object detection; rear parking sensors with brake intervention should an object be detected; blind spot warning and intervention; and even predictive forward collision warning that can detect if the car in front of the car in front of you is slowing.\n\nCarries Plenty of Stuff\n\nIn terms of size, the QX60 matches up well with the Audi Q7. The Infiniti has 15.8 cubic feet of room behind the third row and 40.8 cubic feet with the third row folded. There’s a maximum of 76.5 cubic feet with the second and third rows down. The Q7 is similar: 14.8, 37.5 and 71.6 cubic feet, respectively. If you need more room, upgrade to the Buick Enclave, which features a minivan-like 23.6 cubic feet behind the third row, and 58.0 and 97.6 cubic feet with the third and second rows stowed, respectively.\n\nStarts Cheap, Ends Pricey\n\nThe Infiniti QX60 is reasonably priced if you plan on going for a base model; that’s just $44,095 with FWD and $45,895 with AWD, including destination fee. Once you start adding option packages, however, you’ll see that price climb. My test vehicle included the Premium Package (Bose audio upgrade, memory seats, heated steering wheel, remote engine start, roof rails), the Premium Plus Package (navigation, 360-degree cameras, parking sonar, rain-sensing wipers), the Theater Package (rear entertainment system) and the Deluxe Technology Package (20-inch wheels, a further upgraded Bose audio system, heated and cooled front seats, a motion-activated liftgate, intelligent cruise control and more). The total: $60,045.\n\nCompeting vehicles that seat seven in luxurious accommodations can be had from a few other brands. The closest may be the Buick Enclave, which was redesigned for 2018 and base price is similar to the QX60. We haven’t driven one yet, but its amenities, luxurious appointments and space certainly make it comparable. You’ll spend more to get an Audi Q7 and likely end up with less car in terms of amenities, but it provides a superior luxury-driving experience — its materials quality, design and sophistication all put the QX60 to shame. The Acura MDX has nearly as much room as the Enclave, but it suffers from some similar issues as the QX60 in terms of luxury sophistication, with a lot of lesser Honda parts shining through the Acura veneer. You can compare all four competitors here.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What’s Different on the 2026 Infiniti QX60?\n\nNot much other than some minor stylistic tweaks, interior packaging and powertrain tuning for general smoothness. It all adds up, however, to a solid mid-size three-row premium SUV.\n\nHow Does the 2026 Infiniti QX60 Stack Up to the Competition?\n\nFairly well, though look for the Volvo XC90 to be a bit more upscale and feature-rich and the Acura MDX to have notably better driving dynamics. For the most part, the QX60 matches most premium and luxury three-rows from a value perspective — it all boils down to your needs and priorities.\n\nFirst things first: Check out that color, huh? I’m a sucker for green cars, and the 2026 Infiniti QX60’s new Deep Emerald paint is easily one of the best in this premium luxury mid-size segment. And though my test vehicle’s Stone Gray upholstery is nice, I’d really go bonkers if it’d been swathed in the available Saddle Brown, lending an oh-so-Britannic aesthetic to this refreshed Japanese SUV.\n\nI digress — I don’t have too much to discuss here regarding the refresh, considering it was just moderately reworked for the 2025 model year. Visually, there’s a new slatted front grille with revised LED headlights, and around back, the Infiniti badge is scrapped for just the automaker’s name spelled out in individual letters. Exterior chrome is generally darkened, and standard 20-inch wheels replace the prior base trim’s 18-inch rollers. Just pinches and tucks here and there.\n\n2026 Infiniti QX60, rear angle | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\n\nDitto for the interior, where the 12.3-inch digital driver’s display is now standard and the rest of the new options are, uh, optional. That aforementioned Stone Gray color is new for 2026, as is your choice of open-pore wood trim with snazzy metal inlay. Taking notes from the larger QX80, there’s a choice of two Klipsch audio systems, one with 16 speakers and the top-shelf, 20-speaker Reference Premiere system available exclusively on the Autograph trim.\n\nWhat Engine Does the 2026 Infiniti QX60 Have?\n\nThe powertrain remains untouched, with all QX60s packing the carryover 2.0-liter variable-compression turbocharged four-cylinder. Power is the same 268 horsepower and 286 pounds-feet of torque routed to either the front or all four wheels via a nine-speed automatic transmission. Decent figures, but plenty of folks — us included — weren’t crazy about Infiniti’s decision to replace the SUV’s tried-and-true 3.5-liter naturally aspirated V-6 for the 2025 model year. Power and performance are both acceptable, but our distaste for the apparent discordant relationship between engine and transmission was shared industry wide.\n\nInfiniti took our complaints to heart and fettled with the drivetrain tuning that, according to product reps on hand, improved throttle response, shift logic and general drivability. All good stuff addressing all of our key complaints — at least on paper. To find out, we pointed the QX60’s green schnozz into one of the greatest daily-driving gauntlets imaginable: the mean, mean streets of Hollywood.\n\nNo need for deep-throttle stabs here. I crept the lean, green QX60 Autograph down the iconic and eternally clogged Sunset Strip, finding the tweaked 2.0-liter utterly and completely fine for the low-speed stuff. The drivetrain’s not balky, hesitant or overly loud when pootling around city congestion — it was only when I booted it to snip around a turning box truck when the latent drivetrain hesitancy surfaced. Urgent downshifts are neither clunky nor overly slow, but those accustomed to the excellent, rapid-fire shifting of most modern automatic transmissions will be surprised at the delay, improved as it might be.\n\n2026 Infiniti QX60, front row | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\nHow Does the 2026 Infiniti QX60 Drive?\n\nIt’s simply not a drivetrain combination set up for quick power on demand, but you’ll never, ever feel in danger merging or overtaking, provided you’re confident with both the accelerator and traffic flow. Outside of these brief moments of aggression, the nine-speed is a well-mannered transmission that cruises well and settles down to highway speeds nicely.\n\nBeyond that, power and acceleration toe the line of adequacy. Performance is hardly a leading metric with this segment, but consider the frequent use case for a three-row SUV; if the goal is to haul the family, friends and luggage around town, wouldn’t you rather not feel much of that additional bulk? I imagine the 2026 QX60 would have no issue whatsoever dragging a full house up to a mountain cabin, but it certainly wouldn’t be happy about it, either.\n\nFor the rest of the time you’re gridlocked in Los Angeles, it’s a pleasant and well-muted place to wick away the hours. Seats, materials and touch points are requisitely soft-touch and notably primo, with my general preference lying with Infiniti’s quilted plushness against competitor Acura’s sporty-ish tautness. Driver inputs are anodyne and digital, but that’s right on the money for its intended function, as is the pillowed, slightly floaty ride that fits right in with the Infiniti’s premium positioning. Even so, the mild wheeling I did winding through the Hollywood hills revealed good body composure and A-OK handling for a three-row.\n\nHow Is the 2026 Infiniti QX60 to Live With?\n\nThe route spit me out of the city for a brief stretch on the freeway, the perfect opportunity to futz with the new ProPilot Assist 2.1 driver-assistance system that offers hands-free cruise control. I have no real issues to report in the medium-speed, medium-traffic testing environment, including the execution of assisted lane change.\n\nBack at Infiniti’s West Hollywood basecamp, I clambered around the second- and third-rows for a comfort check. My 5-foot-11 frame fit fine in the similarly cushy second-row captain’s chairs, though it was a bit smushed in the third row. It’s great for kids and occasional dinner runs with family, but consider sourcing a QX80 for frequent third-row occupancy.\n\nIf you were already interested in what the 2025 QX60 had to offer, the updated 2026 model is that same experience, now topped with whipped cream — it has small updates and meaningful improvements, if only just. Might I suggest speccing yours in Deep Emerald over Saddle Brown?\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Infiniti QX60?\n\nThe Infiniti QX60 is a three-row luxury SUV that seats up to seven. Its sole engine is a 295-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 that pairs with a continuously variable automatic transmission. Front- and all-wheel-drive models are available, and rivals include the Lexus RX, Acura MDX and Buick Enclave.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Infiniti QX60?\n\nThere are no significant changes this year.\n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Infiniti QX60 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard comfort items include simulated-leather upholstery, heated front seats, push-button start, tri-zone automatic climate control, and a multimedia system with an 8-inch screen. Built-in navigation is optional, as is leather, ventilated front seats, heated second-row seats, a heated steering wheel, a Bose stereo and a 360-degree camera system.\n\nForward collision warning, automatic emergency braking and blind spot warning are standard. Available active safety features include full-speed adaptive cruise control, backup collision intervention, and lane departure warning and prevention.\n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Infiniti QX60?\n\nThe QX60’s cabin has nice finishes, accessible seating and a responsive multimedia system. However, the driving experience falls short of luxury, with a rough ride and unappealing transmission behavior.",

      "expert_review": "Infiniti’s QX60 was last redesigned for 2022, propping up the three-row SUV’s luxury intentions with a more premium-looking exterior and classier cabin as well as more modern controls. That modernity didn’t translate under the hood, however; although the automatic transmission was new, the same adequate 3.5-liter V-6 engine still powered the QX60 … until 2025.\n\nRelated: 2025 Infiniti QX60 Gets VC-Turbo Engine, Black Edition Package\n\nThe 2025 QX60 gets power from a new engine: a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder.  What’s it like? It’s like ordering a Chicago-style hot dog that gets delivered with ketchup. Translation: Some parts work and others need work.\n\nWhat’s New?\n\nCompared with its predecessor, the new engine loses two cylinders and a bit of horsepower. It makes 268 hp, a drop of 27 hp from the prior V-6’s output, but torque is up 16 pounds-feet to 286. The nine-speed automatic carries over and is better than the pre-2022 model’s gutless continuously variable automatic, but I’m not convinced this powertrain pair is all that happy together.\n\nWhile the old model with the V-6 felt adequately powered, the new turbo delivers more of the same. After some lag, shifts are quick from a stop for good low-end pep. The transmission sometimes seems reluctant to downshift, however, so midrange power is just OK. It never felt underpowered, but it was never lively, either, and I struggle to see how it’s a step up from the previous engine.\n\nWhat’s more, the new turbo four-cylinder has two other annoying traits. Its buzzy sound is at odds with the SUV’s otherwise luxurious vibe and usually quiet cabin, and it requires premium fuel rather than merely recommending it, an added expense.\n\nAlso, the new engine’s fuel-economy gains are minimal, with just a teeny advantage over the 2024 QX60’s V-6. Front-drive SUVs are EPA-rated at 22/28/24 mpg city/highway/combined, and AWD variants get 22/27/24 mpg. The 2024 QX60, meanwhile, is rated at 21/26/23 mpg with FWD and 20/25/22 mpg with AWD. The QX60’s maximum towing capacity (6,000 pounds) is the same with either engine.\n\nOther changes for the new model year are minimal and include a standard key fob that automatically unlocks the doors as you approach the vehicle and locks them as you walk away, a Bose 17-speaker sound system for the Luxe trim level and a Black Edition Package with black exterior and interior accents.\n\nWhat’s Not\n\nIn other ways — both good and bad — the 2025 QX60 is familiar. Highlights include a smooth ride and elegant cabin with a smart design and top-notch materials, as well as a host of family-friendly features. Car-seat accommodation is among my favorite of those.\n\nIn the second row, easy-access Latch anchors make car-seat installation a breeze, and  ample second-row legroom means there’s enough space for both front and rear passengers. The QX60’s third-row access also stands out: Buttons on both sides of the second-row seatbacks lift and slide the seat, creating a big opening to the third row — even when some car seats are installed. It works when a forward-facing car seat is in place as well as when an infant seat’s base is present, making it easy to get to the third row without having to climb over car seats. (Check out the full Car Seat Check.)\n\nBut lowlights abound, too. My biggest gripe is with the QX60’s controls: While its big, clear touchscreen mounted high on the dash is a win for both visibility and usability, its climate controls fail in both areas. Additionally, the QX60’s touch-sensitive controls under the touchscreen are often unreliable and annoying, requiring multiple presses to engage them; that makes them unlike the multimedia screen, which is responsive.\n\nHowever, despite my praise of the multimedia system, its functionality is limited at times. For example, it doesn’t offer wireless Android Auto (it does have wireless Apple CarPlay, however), and when Android Auto is active, the interface only uses part of the screen, leaving a big chunk oddly empty.  Other automakers, such as Hyundai, have also struggled with full-screen integration for Android Auto but have released updates to fix the problem.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2024 Infiniti QX60 Autograph: Extra Nice Costs Extra\nIs the 2022 Infiniti QX60 a Good SUV? 5 Pros and 4 Cons\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2024 Infiniti QX60?\nResearch the 2025 Infiniti QX60\nShop for a 2025 Infiniti QX60\nPricing\n\nThe 2025 Infiniti QX60 comes in Pure, Luxe, Sensory and Autograph trims, and it’s on sale now starting at $51,550 (all prices include $1,350 destination fee). Front-wheel drive is standard on the three lower trim levels, with all-wheel drive available for $2,000; AWD is standard on the range-topping Autograph trim.\n\nPrices for 2025 are up over the outgoing model, with the base 2024 model priced at $51,000 — $550 less than the 2025 model.\n\nWhile the 2025 QX60 continues to deliver an appealing blend of comfort, luxury and utility, I’m not convinced the new engine is really a big step up and enough to warrant the extra cost — either upfront or at the pump.\n\nRelated Video:\n\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Infiniti QX60?\n\nThe Infiniti QX60 is a three-row mid-size SUV that seats six or seven people. A 295-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 paired to a nine-speed automatic transmission is the sole powertrain. Front-wheel drive is standard, with all-wheel drive optional. A redesign for the 2022 model year made the QX60 more competitive against rivals, including the Acura MDX, Audi Q7, Cadillac XT6, Lincoln Aviator, Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class and Volvo XC90. Comfortable and quiet, the QX60 is also a decent value thanks to a wide roster of standard comfort, tech and safety features.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Infiniti QX60?\n\nThe Infiniti QX60 is unchanged for 2024.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Infiniti QX60 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n12.3-inch touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay, wired Android Auto\nWireless device charging pad\nLeather seating\nPower-adjustable driver’s seat\nHeated front seats\nHeated steering wheel \nPanoramic moonroof\nWi-Fi hot spot\nTri-zone climate control\nLane departure steering assist\nRear cross-traffic alert\nRain-sensing wipers\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nAdaptive cruise control\nDigital gauge display\nNavigation\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nMassaging front seats\nHeated second-row seats\nBose audio system\nSecond-row captain’s chairs\nHead-up instrument display\nShould I Buy the 2024 Infiniti QX60?\n\nThe Infiniti QX60 is a smooth and comfortable means of transporting yourself and up to six more people from one point to another. The ride can get unsettled over imperfect roads, but it’s generally well behaved, and the interior is whisper-quiet during highway cruising. Available second-row captain’s chairs reduce seating capacity by one, but provide easier access to the third row. Though it’s not in the same tier as most of its Asian and European rivals in terms of all-around refinement and technology features, the QX60 is handsome and nicely equipped, with the coddling ambiance that luxury SUV shoppers are looking for in a vehicle.",

      "expert_review": "Every premium brand needs a luxury SUV, but that can lead to problems if it’s based on something less fancy. Such is the case with the 2017 Infiniti QX60. It started life as the new Nissan Pathfinder, a peppy, comfortable seven-seat family SUV with a reasonably powerful V-6 and plenty of room for people and stuff. Turning it into an Infiniti involved a lot of added luxury trimmings, a little more power, some retuned chassis bits and a higher price tag. But are these changes enough to justify its higher price tag? Do they make the QX60 competitive with vehicles like the Audi Q7, Buick Enclave and Acura MDX? They weren’t so successful last time around; have the new refinements helped?\n\nShared Proportions, Not Looks\n\nWhile the QX60 is based on the Pathfinder, Infiniti stylists have done an excellent job differentiating it visually. Folds and creases in the sheet metal, plus a feline grille and headlights, combine with the unique D-pillar shape to give the Infiniti QX60 a look all its own. It’s not unattractive, but it’s not going to win any car-show beauty contests now or down the road. Its looks are definitely tied to the rest of Infiniti’s lineup, sharing a lot of styling elements with the automaker’s smaller sedans and coupes.\n\nIt’s not easy to make a big, two-box shape look appealing, but it can be done. The Audi Q7 may be the best example of this, with its clean lines, simple curves and flush features. The new Buick Enclave (arriving for 2018) is similarly sleek without appearing ungainly. The Infiniti manages to be inoffensive, but I don’t find it as appealing as its competitors.\n\nRoom Aplenty\n\nThe seats in the first two rows are quite comfortable — big and supportive, with plenty of room. The front seats are heated, and cooling is available as part of an optional Deluxe Technology Package. The second row has optional heating elements only. The third row is easy to get into thanks to some nifty folding technology for the second row, but it’s a little tight back there; save it for kids or adults on short trips. Visibility is also quite good, with a very low dashboard and beltline that provide a sweeping view forward and to the sides.\n\nSadly, that’s where the interior praise ends. The layout of the buttons and switches defies logic, perhaps because the low dashboard minimizes reachable space. There are several switches placed down around the driver’s left shin — controlling things like the vehicle’s safety systems — that are invisible and unusable while driving. They’re even hard to see when stationary; you have to bend over and look around the steering wheel.\n\nAnd then there are things we might accept on a $36,000 Nissan that don’t cut the mustard on a $60,000 Infiniti. For instance, the QX60’s higher-mounted buttons are easier to use, but they look like they were lifted directly out of a Pathfinder; they’re not suited to the Infiniti QX60. The 8-inch multimedia system is also only partially refreshed: While the audio component is new, the navigation system isn’t, with graphics and resolution that feel dated compared with systems like Audi’s slick MMI, which features both rich graphics and Google Earth functions. At least there are plenty of USB ports — two data-capable ones for connecting personal electronics and three more for charging.\n\nNor is materials quality up to premium-brand snuff. The designs and shapes are only slightly different from the Pathfinder, and the sophistication of the designs is unimpressive. The doors, for instance, look like smooth plastic with a bit of faux wood glued to the middle. The graining on the soft upper dash pad doesn’t match the grain on the doors, and you can see the outline of the front passenger airbag in the dashboard; that hasn’t been the case in most premium-brand cars for well over a decade.\n\nWe found the Pathfinder’s interior to be acceptable if uninspiring. Pumping up the price for the Infiniti brings a new level of expectations, and the interior trappings aren’t commensurately better.\n\nFast but Not Fun\n\nThe Infiniti QX60 gets a little more power for its engine, a 3.5-liter naturally aspirated V-6 making 295 horsepower, up from the 284 the Pathfinder makes. Torque is up to 270 lb-ft, a slight bump from the Pathfinder’s 259. The has a continuously variable transmission, with a manual shift mode and programming that makes it behave like a traditional geared transmission in most driving situations. Front-wheel drive is standard, all-wheel drive optional.\n\nKeep the mode selector in Normal mode and you’ll be greeted with a responsive, peppy engine that moves the QX60 with surprising alacrity. The transmission is inoffensive, behaving mostly like you’d expect a CVT to behave — delivering power linearly, never feeling like it’s hunting for a gear. Switch the rotary selector into Eco mode, however, and the engine is emasculated in favor of fuel economy, creating such an awful driving experience that you’ll likely decide the fuel savings aren’t worth it. Sport mode is similarly unpleasant, but in the opposite direction: The changes to its shifting and engine response make it jumpy and skittish. Leave it in Normal and the QX60 is a happier beast.\n\nThe steering won’t make you all that happy, however. It’s ridiculously heavy at lower speeds, requiring more effort, presumably in an attempt to make it feel more substantial and responsive than the Pathfinder. Yet on the highway it’s darty and oversensitive, making it difficult to maintain a line in your lane without keeping two hands on the wheel at all times and paying very close attention.\n\nTwo bright points: Ride quality is an excellent mix of good control and supple bump-soaking ability, and the brakes are strong and confidence-inspiring. That well-tuned ride, combined with a quiet, well-insulated cabin, make the QX60 more pleasant for passengers than for the driver. The Audi Q7 is far better to drive, with a responsive powertrain and sophisticated chassis control that shames the QX60’s driving experience.\n\nAt least the CVT does well for fuel economy, delivering an estimated 19/26/22 mpg city/highway/combined with all-wheel drive — a competitive number for a big SUV with a large V-6 engine. It’s better than the Audi Q7’s much smaller and less-powerful turbocharged four-cylinder engine, which is rated 19/25/21 mpg, but is rated exactly the same as the 3.5-liter-V-6-equipped Acura MDX.\n\nImproved Safety Tech\n\nThe 2017 model year QX60 did quite well in crash tests, with top scores from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety across the board (with the exception of headlight performance, judged to be poor). The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration awarded the QX60 five stars overall.\n\nThe QX60 has an impressive array of optional safety features, much of it electronic-based collision prevention. There’s forward automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection; a 360-degree Around View Monitor with moving-object detection; rear parking sensors with brake intervention should an object be detected; blind spot warning and intervention; and even predictive forward collision warning that can detect if the car in front of the car in front of you is slowing.\n\nCarries Plenty of Stuff\n\nIn terms of size, the QX60 matches up well with the Audi Q7. The Infiniti has 15.8 cubic feet of room behind the third row and 40.8 cubic feet with the third row folded. There’s a maximum of 76.5 cubic feet with the second and third rows down. The Q7 is similar: 14.8, 37.5 and 71.6 cubic feet, respectively. If you need more room, upgrade to the Buick Enclave, which features a minivan-like 23.6 cubic feet behind the third row, and 58.0 and 97.6 cubic feet with the third and second rows stowed, respectively.\n\nStarts Cheap, Ends Pricey\n\nThe Infiniti QX60 is reasonably priced if you plan on going for a base model; that’s just $44,095 with FWD and $45,895 with AWD, including destination fee. Once you start adding option packages, however, you’ll see that price climb. My test vehicle included the Premium Package (Bose audio upgrade, memory seats, heated steering wheel, remote engine start, roof rails), the Premium Plus Package (navigation, 360-degree cameras, parking sonar, rain-sensing wipers), the Theater Package (rear entertainment system) and the Deluxe Technology Package (20-inch wheels, a further upgraded Bose audio system, heated and cooled front seats, a motion-activated liftgate, intelligent cruise control and more). The total: $60,045.\n\nCompeting vehicles that seat seven in luxurious accommodations can be had from a few other brands. The closest may be the Buick Enclave, which was redesigned for 2018 and base price is similar to the QX60. We haven’t driven one yet, but its amenities, luxurious appointments and space certainly make it comparable. You’ll spend more to get an Audi Q7 and likely end up with less car in terms of amenities, but it provides a superior luxury-driving experience — its materials quality, design and sophistication all put the QX60 to shame. The Acura MDX has nearly as much room as the Enclave, but it suffers from some similar issues as the QX60 in terms of luxury sophistication, with a lot of lesser Honda parts shining through the Acura veneer.

      "expert_review": "Infiniti’s QX60 SUV enters the 2023 model year largely unchanged after a complete redesign for 2022. The only major difference from the previous model is that, like all 2023 Infinitis, the 2023 QX60 now comes with the Infiniti Premium Care maintenance plan. The QX60 will start at $50,395 for the base front-wheel-drive Pure model (all prices include a $1,195 destination fee), and every 2023 trim level costs at least $2,420 more than a 2022.\n\nRelated: Is the 2022 Infiniti QX60 a Good SUV? 5 Pros and 4 Cons\n\nInfiniti Premium Care is a three-year maintenance program that covers scheduled maintenance such as inspections, oil changes, tire rotations, brake fluid changes and cabin air filter replacement, as well as tire repair or replacement and (depending on the model) rental car assistance.\n\nBeyond the standard maintenance plan, the QX60 comes standard with the carryover 295-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 and nine-speed automatic transmission, FWD, a 12.3-inch touchscreen display with wireless Apple CarPlay and wired Android Auto smartphone connectivity, heated front seats, and leather upholstery for the first and second rows. Optional all-wheel drive costs $2,000 on the Pure, Luxe and Sensory, and adds $2,900 to the range-topping Autograph.\n\nThe 2023 QX60 is on sale now, and full pricing is below:\n\nPure: $50,395 ($2,520 increase over 2022)\nLuxe: $56,445 ($2,520 increase)\nSensory: $59,795 ($2,420 increase)\nAutograph: $63,795 ($2,420 increase)\n\nThe QX60’s prices are competitive with other near-luxury SUVs including the Acura MDX and Lexus RX. The 2023 MDX starts at just over $50,000, while the 2022 RX is just under $50,000 (we don’t yet have pricing for the redesigned 2023 RX).\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2022 Infiniti QX60 Review: Climbing Back Up the Luxury Ladder\nWhich 3-Row SUVs Offer Captain’s Chairs?\nWhich Vehicles Have the Best Warranty Coverage?\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto: Where Are They Now?\n2022 Infiniti QX80 Finally Gets the Updated Interior It Needed\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The new QX60 is a better-looking, more luxurious and smoother-operating luxury SUV than its predecessor.\n\nVersus the competition: With the 2022 QX60, Infiniti moves this SUV into much more competitive territory versus other near-luxury brands like Lincoln, Acura, Buick and Audi, but it falls a bit short of top-tier offerings from Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Land Rover.\n\nYou have to give Infiniti credit. Despite being in the market for nearly 30 years and still struggling to overcome the “near-luxury” label that relegates it to second-tier status among luxury brands, it keeps trying. The label is partly thanks to the fact that Infiniti shares parts and products with its parent brand, Nissan. All brands that share parts with more mass-market parent companies tend to struggle with image — witness Lincoln, Acura, Cadillac and even Lexus. The connection between the lux brand and the mass brand is more obvious at times, like when powertrains and interior switches are shared between brands without any upgrades, and sometimes it’s less obvious: Lincoln, for example, has dramatically moved its offerings away from its shared Ford underpinnings. \n\nInfiniti has historically gone through such swings, but it’s heading more toward differentiation with the 2022 QX60 three-row mid-size SUV. It’s a significant update over the outgoing model, with far more expressive styling, an all-new interior, a new transmission and a healthier dose of luxury trimmings. It looks significantly different from the Nissan Pathfinder upon which it’s based, but is it different enough to justify its loftier price?\n\nRelated: Redesigned 2022 Infiniti QX60 Priced From $47,875\n\nDistinctive Style\n\nThe first thing you’ll notice about the new QX60 is that it doesn’t look much like the old one, despite its chassis and greasy bits not changing much from the last model. The sheet metal is all new and much more distinctive, and the proportions are different; it looks more like a rear-wheel-drive SUV than a front-wheel-drive one, thanks to its long hood and the position of its wheels. It’s the look that’s made the Lincoln Aviator such a style winner, and it works well here, too. \n\nThere are some unusual elements, including some odd faux chrome exhaust tips on the rear bumper that aren’t exhausts at all. Despite that, though, the strong fender lines, a huge and bold (but not overwhelming) grille, and slim cat-eye LED headlights and taillights add up to a much more attractive, distinctive look. It’s fitting for the vehicle said to be the new style-setter for the rest of Infiniti’s lineup as various models come up for renewal. \n\nSquint hard enough at the new QX60 and you’ll see a lot of Lincoln in the design, from the sweeping roofline to the slim taillights. That’s not a bad thing; it differentiates the QX from the Nissan Pathfinder — even parked next to each other it’s not immediately obvious they share a lot of their guts and structure. But it also creates a look that’s very different from the Acura MDX, Audi Q7 and even the latest Buick Enclave. It takes a lot of influences from a number of different sources, but Infiniti’s new look is successful; it certainly turns heads as it goes by.\n\nDramatic Dynamic Improvements\n\nIf you think the new QX60’s styling improvements are successful, you’ll be pleased with its dynamic changes, as well. The engine hasn’t changed from the last model, which is a bit of a disappointment: It’s a 3.5-liter V-6 making 295 horsepower and 270 pounds-feet of torque. The big difference now is that it’s mated to a new nine-speed automatic transmission, not the awkward continuously variable automatic that came before. As such, it feels far more “normal” and pleasant to drive; there’s no droning, no fake shift patterns, no strange behavior. The combination creates a big SUV with acceptable — if not neck-snapping — acceleration. \n\nThe QX60 has a bit less hp than some of its rivals, including the Lincoln Aviator and its optional 400-hp, twin-turbo V-6 and the Audi Q7 with its optional 335-hp V-6. The QX60’s base curb weight, however, is roughly 1,000 pounds less than the truck-based Aviator’s, and it’s hundreds of pounds lighter than the Audi. It bests the Acura MDX’s 290-hp V-6, but that model weighs about 100 pounds less than the Infiniti. The QX60’s powertrain combination is adequate for its purpose — motivating this SUV around town and on the highway with minimal drama — but it doesn’t add much to the experience. It’s quiet, smooth and doesn’t interfere with the Zen experience of calm, luxury motoring that the QX60 creates. It’ll do.\n\nRide quality, however, is interesting. It exhibits some harshness over more extreme road imperfections but swims along smoothly on long highway jaunts. I put nearly 1,000 miles on the QX60 on a voyage from Michigan to Wisconsin and back. Infiniti’s ProPilot Assist semi-autonomous driving features and an utter lack of wind noise combined to make it a truly pleasant driving companion, eating up long miles with calm, easygoing charm. Only the Aviator can match that kind of wafting philosophy; the German competitors tend to be stiffer and sportier, while other Japanese competitors seem to favor minivan-style numbness when it comes to ride and handling. \n\nFuel economy is just average for the class — which is to say, not what anyone would call good in general. The QX60 is EPA-rated 21/26/23 mpg city/highway/combined (20/25/22 with AWD), giving it a slight advantage over the competitors mentioned above. My 1,000-mile jaunt saw it average about 21 mpg overall. There are no good options when it comes to fuel economy in this segment; even plug-in hybrid Grand Touring versions of the Lincoln Aviator are rated just 23 mpg combined after its battery runs dry. \n\nMuch Upgraded Interior\n\nThe QX60’s new cabin appointments only add to the luxurious experience. I drove an Autograph trim level (much like Land Rover, Infiniti’s unusual names for its trim levels don’t really indicate what they are), which took quilted leather to a new level, slathering it on the seats, doors and even the dash top. I’m not sure how well it will hold up long-term, or how readily it will trap dust and dirt, but it looked simply smashing in my brand-new example. The whole interior is massively upgraded over what came before, immediately catapulting the QX60 to the top of the list of near-luxury brands. Infiniti’s Zero Gravity (still a silly name) seats are comfortable over long trips, and there’s plenty of legroom in the first two rows of seats for full-size adults. Outward visibility is also quite good, with a low dash that doesn’t impede your forward view.\n\nThe controls and displays are also thoroughly modernized, with varying degrees of success. The digital gauge cluster can be reconfigured into a couple of different views, but oddly there are fewer options than you get in a Nissan Pathfinder, which has a similar display. There are new touch-sensitive or “capacitive” buttons for the climate-control system, which isn’t our favorite way to control anything. They work well enough, if not quite perfectly — just like all capacitive-touch controls. \n\nOf note is the QX60’s big, clear touchscreen, which is mounted high in the dash for easy viewing and can be controlled either by fingertip or by a secondary knob low on the center console between the front seats. I generally prefer a direct touchscreen to a remote controller, but it’s nice that Infiniti gives you the option to use either one.\n\nThe whole interior is a vast improvement over the old one in terms of quality, luxury and design, but it’s still not perfect. There’s an inordinate amount of shiny trim inside that can easily reflect sunlight into your eyes, and while the head-up display can show you a lot of information, for some reason the speedometer is offset from the centerline of the steering wheel, which is unusual. All in all, however, the new interior represents a significant boost in Infiniti luxury appointments, making it a better match for the prices the company charges. It feels worth its cost. \n\nPriced to Compete\n\nThe new QX60 might finally be competitive against its contemporaries in terms of luxury and performance, and its price also reflects its status. Trim levels start with the base Pure FWD model for $47,875 (including destination fee), moves up to Luxe and Sensory, then tops out at the Autograph trim level. A fully loaded Autograph AWD like the one I tested will cost around $67,000, which is in line with models from Audi, Acura and Lexus and considerably less than the costliest Lincoln Aviator, which can easily top $80,000 (or more if you opt for a Grand Touring PHEV version). \n\nWith its combination of newfound style, a luxurious and well-appointed cabin, and quiet and comfortable cruising behavior, the redesigned 2022 Infiniti QX60 earns its place on the three-row luxury SUV consideration list. Let’s hope Infiniti’s next models can keep up the brand’s ascent back up the luxury ladder. \n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nWhich Cars Have Panoramic Moonroofs or Sunroofs?\nWhich 3-Row SUVs Offer Captain’s Chairs?\nInventory Pinch: 25 Models Still Out There\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2022 Infiniti QX55?\nIs the 2021 Infiniti QX80 a Good SUV? 5 Things We Like, 4 We Don’t\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
