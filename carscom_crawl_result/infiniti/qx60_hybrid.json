      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nInfiniti’s 2016 Q50 sport sedan received some powertrain love from the company’s engineers, but the 2016 model of the QX60 large SUV instead got attention from the brand’s stylists. A subtly revised look and some new safety features are new for 2016 with powertrains carrying over.\n\nExterior\nThe revisions to the QX60 for 2016 aren’t much more than skin deep, but the skin is more pleasant to behold than before. The SUV receives a nose job with the Infiniti family spindle grille now stretching deeper into the bumper. Stylists did a better job of sculpting the lower valence to better match the upper portions of the front end. Its headlights are also subtly revised to look a little sharper, with new LED light patterns and bright trim around the fog lights. The overall look is more cohesive and angrier, and less chubby-faced than the outgoing model; it’s a definite improvement.\n\nIn back, more angular taillights and a revised lower bumper complete the revisions, which also include some new wheel patterns.\n\nInterior\nThe 2016 QX60 isn’t much different inside; the biggest change is the addition of soft-touch materials with contrasting stitching on the upper dashboard area, and a slightly revised console and shifter. The QX60’s excellent interior space and reconfigurable seating options remain and have gotten even friendlier with the addition of three more USB ports for passengers, but only on 3.5-liter V-6 models.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe QX60’s powertrains carry over, with only minor revisions to things like motor mounts for 2016. Standard is a 265-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 engine mated to a continuously variable transmission routing power to the front wheels; all-wheel drive is an option.\n\nOptional is a hybrid model with a supercharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine, lithium-ion battery and electric motor that make a combined 250 hp. Both powertrains are shared with the Nissan Pathfinder upon which the QX60 is based, with the hybrid now exclusive to the Infiniti.\n\nSafety\nThe 2016 QX60 gets some new safety systems for 2016. Forward collision warning is now joined by autonomous emergency brake intervention, which works to first warn drivers of a potential collision and then brake the vehicle in two stages to try and at least mitigate the impact. It works in both forward and Reverse to stop the vehicle. An around-view monitor is also available using cameras around the SUV to provide a 360-degree view of the surroundings when backing up.",
