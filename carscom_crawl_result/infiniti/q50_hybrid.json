      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe 2016 Infiniti Q50 sport sedan may not look all that different from the 2015 model because the changes to the car are entirely in the engine bay. A trio of updated powertrains are now offered in the sedan, ranging from a four-cylinder to a new twin-turbo V-6, along with the returning hybrid powertrain.\n\nUnder the HoodThe Q50 base model gets a new a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that makes 208-horsepower and a healthy 258 pounds-feet of torque. Like all of the new engines, it’s mated to a seven-speed automatic transmission only, and can be had with rear- or all-wheel drive.\n\nStepping up from the four-cylinder is a new twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter VR30 V-6, which makes 300 hp and 295 pounds-feet of torque in the 3.0t trim level. But the one that will likely get enthusiasts’ attention is the version in the Q50 Red Sport 400. It’s a twin-turbo 3.0-liter engine that makes 400 hp and 350 pounds-feet of torque.\n\nThe only carryover powertrain is the hybrid version, which returns with a 3.5-liter naturally aspirated V-6 and a lithium-ion battery pack. Employing a dual-clutch transmission and electric motor, it will provide 360 total system horsepower.\n\nInfiniti didn’t just stop at the engines, however. The automaker also updated the car’s steering and suspension for 2016. The problematic drive-by-wire system has been extensively revised, says the company, with the new Direct Adaptive Steering enjoying considerable logic updates for better feel and responsiveness. It provides some semiautonomous driving functionality as well, working with the lane keep assist system to maintain a car’s position in the lane in the event of strong crosswinds. The Direct Adaptive Steering system can be had with any of the 3.0-liter cars or the hybrid model. The company is still providing a hedge, however, including an electrically assisted power steering system as standard equipment, with the 2.0-liter car sticking with a standard hydraulic steering system.\n\nIn addition to the steering changes, Sport trim levels now get the Dynamic Digital Suspension; it’s an adaptive suspension that adjusts shock absorber response to the driver’s selected mode.\n\nInteriorCosmetically, the Q50’s interior isn’t much different for 2016, but the brand has updated its aging multimedia system. The new Infiniti InTouch system employs two touch-capacitive screens on the center console to supposedly bring an easy-to-use interface to the driving experience. The upper screen contains most of the more frequently used content, such as apps and navigation, while everything else is displayed on the lower screen. It all works via what Infiniti claims to be intuitive hand gestures.\n\nSafetyThe 2016 Q50 receives some safety updates as well, with a new Driver Assistance Package adding autonomous emergency braking, blind spot warning, rear collision intervention with cross-traffic alert and an around-view monitor with moving object detection. Blind spot warning and intervention with lane keep assist and lane departure prevention are all available in the Technology Package.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe Q50 replaces Infiniti’s G37 compact sedan. The change reflects Infiniti’s new naming convention — all cars will be Q and all SUVs QX, each with a number to reflect their size and place in the lineup rather than their engine size. But the Q50 has some dramatic changes of its own, including new styling and technology, a hybrid version and the regrettable discontinuation of a manual transmission.\n\nThe Q50 competes with the Audi A4, BMW 3 Series, Cadillac ATS and Lexus IS.\n\nExterior\nThe Q50 is a complete redesign, but its wheelbase is identical to the outgoing G37’s. The Q50 is 2 inches wider while overall length is marginally longer, and the height is down less than a half inch. The look is radically different, mimicking the larger M37 sedan. Infiniti says the car’s coefficient of drag is a remarkably low 0.26, which is in league with some of the slipperiest hybrids and other high-efficiency vehicles on the market.\n\nThe car has standard LED headlights, running lights and taillights. Seventeen-inch wheels are standard, and 19-inchers come on the Sport trim level, which also has a more aggressive front-end design.\n\nInterior\nThe cabin marks an upgrade over an interior that had grown outdated in the G sedan. Motifs range from more conservative, with maple trim, to contemporary, with aluminum appliques in the Sport trim level.\n\nThe highlights are in the center control panel: The Q50 features two touch-screens in the center of the dashboard that can work independently or in tandem. A map can be shown on the top screen while a destination address is input in the lower screen. The lower screen is flanked by columns of real mechanical buttons that control climate — rather than touch-sensitive capacitive panels.\n\nInfiniti says the Q50’s trunk is 18.0 cubic feet, which is incredibly large for the class, and 14.1 cubic feet in the hybrid version.\nUnder the Hood\nThe Q50 has the G sedan’s standard 328-horsepower, 3.7-liter V-6, a seven-speed automatic transmission and rear- or all-wheel drive. It does away with the well-regarded six-speed manual initially, and possibly for good. (The upcoming Q60 coupe and convertible will offer the manual.) The Infiniti Drive Mode Selector now adds a Custom setting to the Snow, Eco, Standard and Sport modes. It allows the driver to assign his or her own selection of acceleration, steering and stability system calibrations to a single mode; the other modes are pre determined. Steeringwheel shift paddles are optional.\n\nThe new development is the hybrid, which uses a 3.5-liter V-6 and produces 354 hp total. This approach is similar to that in the M sedan; it provides more power than the standard gas-only engine along with higher but not dramatic mileage.\n\nThe greatest leap in technology — and of faith — is Infiniti’s optional new Direct Adaptive Steering, which is a by-wire steering system claimed to provide “independent control of the Q50’s tire angle and steering inputs, transmitting the driver’s intentions to the wheels faster than a mechanical system.” The steering ratio and power assist can also be customized to suit the driver. A mechanical backup remains onboard.\n\nBuyers can opt for upgraded brakes that employ upgraded discs and four-piston front and two-piston rear calipers.\n\nSafety\nStandard safety features include the federally mandated antilock brakes and electronic stability system. There are frontal airbags, front-seat-mounted side-impact airbags and side curtains.\n\nThe Q50 offers a host of active-safety features that attempt to prevent collisions in the first place. They include forward collision warning with automated emergency braking, blind spot warning, backup collision intervention, lane departure prevention and Active Lane Control. Active Lane Control uses cameras to keep you driving straight when you’ve wandered too far in your lane, but it also makes smaller adjustments to keep you driving straight in cases of crosswinds and road imperfections.",
