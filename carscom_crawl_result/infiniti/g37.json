      "expert_review": "The 2011 Infiniti G37x coupe had me grinning before I even drove it. It was red, had paddle shifters and embraced me with its bolstered seats. What a welcome!\n\nWith its V-6 engine, all-wheel drive with Snow mode, and sinewy looks, the 2011 Infiniti G37x coupe will make you the envy of the carpool lane until the other parents see the effort it takes to get younger kids in and out of the backseat.\n\nThe G37x has a 3.7-liter V-6 engine. That’s a lot of power and capability for a four-seat coupe. The acceleration in the G37x will have you grinning ear to ear while driving from gymnastics to soccer to the grocery store and back. The braking was responsive due to the Sport Package’s sport brakes that have four-piston front calipers and two-piston rear calipers.\n\nThe 2011 G37x I tested rang up at $47,795. It started with a base price of $39,300 and added the Premium Package, Sport Package, Navigation Package and the Interior Accents Package. Oh, and some fancy-pants brake pads.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe G37x looks taut and muscly like Madonna’s arms. It’s definitely a pretty car and leans to the aggressive side, and I’m just going to tell you right now that the photos don’t do it justice. I wish the front end had more of a snub-nose, like Infiniti’s FX, but I guess that’s not as aerodynamic and would probably slow this baby down.\n\nThe other thing that slows down the G37x is getting your kids in and out of the backseat. As expected, it’s a trick that older kids master but will have younger kids frustrated if they like to do things independently. If you want to cut down on time spent loading the kids into the coupe, you can have both kids get in on one side, but then they have to climb over the large drivetrain hump in the backseat’s floor. Once the kids are in and you drive around a bit you’ll forget the effort it took to get there.\n\nAlso unfortunate is the G37x’s trunk space. While a handy icon shows how to fit two sets of golf clubs in the back, there’s no advice for how to fit a box of diapers and a stroller in the trunk. In the event you’re carrying groceries, the trunk can handle a decent load. If you want more space, you can fold the rear seat. The seat isn’t split and folds down in one piece. Also, the trunk hatch is a funky shape that may present problems with strollers, too.\n\nThe 2011 G37x coupe has a 330-horsepower, 3.7-liter V-6 engine with a seven-speed automatic transmission. It uses premium gas and gets an EPA-estimated 18/25 mpg city/highway.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Groove-On\n\nINTERIOR\nThe G37x has a beautiful interior with high-gloss maple accents that were courtesy of the Interior Accents Package. I was thrilled to see luxury appointments like heated and ventilated leather seats and lumbar support for the driver. The driver’s seat continued to dazzle with the lower seat cushion scooting out or in to provide additional thigh support.\n\nHowever, the driver’s seat belt was maddening. It had a stiff arm that would hold out the seat belt for me, which was great when buckling up, but it also prevented the seat belt from sitting across my body properly. No matter how I adjusted it, the seat belt was rubbing against my neck. Also, the seat belt buckle’s base was so tall that the belt didn’t lay flat across my lap.\n\nI did like the sport pedals because they reminded me that the G37s was ready to race at the drop of a hat. While those pedals served as a reminder that this is a driver’s car, it would work for a family part-time. All four of my family members were comfortable in the G37x, but a long-distance road trip in it would be out of the question.\n\nThe kids were actually glad to be in their booster seats so they could see out the G37x’s rear windows. They did love the dedicated center console between the rear seats that had covered cupholders in it. This console eliminated the possibility of a third seating position in the back. I kind of like Infiniti’s stance on not even making it an option. No debating, just four people and four only. Don’t even try five.\n\nOne thing I love about coupes is they’re usually sized nicely for me because everything is within reach. This wasn’t the case in the G37x. When I had the seat adjusted comfortably, the rearview mirror and multimedia system weren’t within reach.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\nSAFETY\nSometimes cars like the 2011 Infiniti G37x like to remind you that their primary purpose isn’t as a family hauler. Case in point: The G37x’s two sets of lower Latch anchors are obscured not by one but by two flaps. Nothing says, “No kids,” like difficult-to-use Latch anchors. The rear seats are sculpted but miraculously my kids’ booster seats fit fine. The seat belt buckles are on stable bases, but they’re placed in the raised portion of the bolstered seat, so they actually work well.\n\nFitting rear-facing child-safety seats in the G37x would be a difficult. They’d fit if you were able to scoot the front seats far enough forward and still be comfortable, but getting kids in and out would be a serious challenge.\n\nThe 2011 G37x has standard all-wheel drive, four-wheel antilock brakes with brake assist, an electronic stability system with traction control, a backup camera and six airbags, including side curtains for both rows. Adaptive cruise control is optional.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2011 Infiniti G37x here.",

      "expert_review": "My current love affair with Infiniti began when I drove the G35 sedan. My passions flamed even higher when I hopped into the EX35 crossover — zipping around Detroit with a sense of entitlement.\n\nThen I drove the G37 Sport coupe — an athletic little four seater with a six-speed manual slush box, big 19-inch wheels stuffed into the wheel wells, and a racy little body that looks like it was formed with mercury.\n\nWalking up to her, I gave the G37 Sport an admiring gaze. This could be the beginning of something special, I thought.\n\nThat low front end and crisp pointed headlights push back along the edges of the trunk, giving the G37 a longer look. The big intakes under the body-colored bumper help feed the engine cool air. It has a powerful look.\n\nThe roof line starts with an elegant curve that flows gently to the back. Really, it’s a sharp profile, though the space between the door and the rear wheel throws off the proportions. Compared with its predecessor, it’s longer, lower and wider.\n\nThe wheels are pushed out to the corners, giving it a 112.2-inch wheelbase. This smoothes out the ride.\n\nInside, the G37 Sport coupe is refined and I liked the low riding seating position. However, this does mean you tend to fall into the seat when you get in, and you have to roll out of the cabin, using your arm to push yourself up. There’s nothing graceful about getting out of this vehicle.\n\nAdjusting the eight-way power seats, I found the near perfect position — a little closer to the steering wheel, legs slightly bent, hand on the manual shifter.\n\nI looked over the “double wave” instrument panel, pressed the start button and cranked the optional 11-speaker stereo by Bose (which includes three-way front door speakers and 10-inch woofers).\n\nThere’s loads of technology in the G37 sport coupe. Bluetooth connectivity to allow hands-free operation of your phone (something that is becoming more important as more states ban cell phone use while driving), a voice-activated navigation system with real-time traffic updates and even a 9.3 gigabyte music box that allows you to burn your CDs into the system.\n\nThere’s also a compact flash slot to load up even more music — if you still have a compact flash card lying around from 2004. A USB thumb drive would have made more sense.\n\nThe front is very comfortable, lots of leg room, and all of the controls are at your fingertips. While the car contains a lot of high-tech devices, the layout is user friendly and not intimidating.\n\nDriving this sport coupe is pleasant. Launch is quick, the gearbox clicks through the gears smoothly and the suspension helps keep the tires stuck to the ground.\n\nReally, the performance is excellent. Push hard into a turn and the stability control fixes any under steering or over steering. Go too fast and the independent suspension keeps the car in the turn. Accelerating is good, even at highway passing speeds, and braking is excellent.\n\nThe 3.7-liter V-6 pushes out 330 horses and you can feel the power in your stomach. But the car is so quiet — a cue you want in a luxury car — the engine never talks to you in that sporty, guttural kind of way. There was no fear in this car, something I like in a sports car. I never felt like I was a millimeter from pushing it too far.This carapproaches performance in a stoic, utilitarian way.\n\nThe first hundred miles felt sterile and unemotional. The next 100 didn’t win me over, though I thought it might.\n\nDespite her gorgeous exterior and well-appointed leather interior, the G37 Sport coupe never connected with me the way the G35 and EX35 did. I wanted the ride of my life, but the chemistry just wasn’t there.\n\nIt’s not you, G37 Sport coupe, it’s me. I hope we can still be friends.\n\nInfiniti G37 Sport Coupe\n\nMSRP: $36,965\n\nEngine: 3.7-liter V-6\n\nPower: 330-horsepower; 270-pound-feet torque\n\nTransmission: 6-speed manual\n\nEPA mileage: 17 mpg city / 26 mpg highway\n\nSteering: Turning radius: 36.1feet\n\nSuspension: Front: Double wishbone\n\nRear: Independent multi-link\n\nBrakes:\n\nFront: 14-inch vented disc\n\nRear: 13.8-inch vented disc\n\nWheels: 19-inch aluminum alloy\n\nDimensions (inches):\n\nWheelbase: 112.2\n\nLength: 183.1\n\nWidth: 71.8\n\nHeight: 54.9\n\nFront track: 60.8\n\nRear track: 61.4\n\nDrag coefficient: .30 Cd\n\nInterior:\n\nSeating: four\n\nLeg room (inches):\n\nFront: 43.8\n\nRear: 29.8\n\nTrunk volume: 7.4 cubic feet\n\nFuel tank: 20 gallons\n\nCurb weight: 3,668 pounds\n\nScott Burgess is the auto critic for The Detroit News.

      "expert_review": "The Infiniti G coupe and sedan are favorites here at Cars.com, in part because they offer performance similar to BMW’s popular 3 Series at a lower price. With the all-new G37 retractable-hardtop convertible, Infiniti continues to stalk the 3 Series, which had already added a retractable-hardtop to its lineup.\n\nIn convertible form, the rear-wheel-drive G37 retains the fun-to-drive nature of its closed-roof siblings, making it well positioned to go toe-to-toe with the 335i convertible. This new Infiniti isn’t without some issues, though, including paltry trunk space when the top is down.\n\nIn addition to the convertible, we’ve also reviewed the coupe and sedan versions of the G37 if you want to catch up on those models. See a comparison of all three here.\n\nThe Look\nSome retractable-hardtops don’t have the best lines, but Infiniti did a nice job retaining the G37 coupe’s sleek shape in its new convertible. The convertible’s roofline arc is similar to the coupe’s, but perhaps more important, the rear of the convertible isn’t excessively tall, which throws off the styling of some other retractable-hardtops, including the new Lexus IS convertible.\n\nInfiniti says it takes around 30 seconds to lower or raise the retractable-hardtop roof, which is longer than BMW’s reported 22 seconds for the 335i and the MX-5 Miata’s speedy retractable-hardtop roof, which Mazda says takes just 12 seconds. More significant than the Infiniti’s slightly slower roof is the way the trunklid shuts with a thunk at the end of the operation, shaking the car slightly. It’s the type of sensation a luxury convertible shouldn’t produce.\n\nRide & Handling\nEven though the G37 convertible does the fancy trick of lowering its roof at the touch of a button, it’s nice to see that the performance-oriented nature of the car hasn’t been diluted by its transformation to a convertible. The droptop exhibits the balanced dynamics and direct, weighty steering we’ve come to appreciate in other versions of the G37.\n\nThe four-wheel independent suspension is firm, and its responses let you know that this car is designed for driving enthusiasts — especially with the way the convertible hunkers down in corners. Its focus on sportiness is similar to the 335i convertible’s; the IS convertible and Volvo C70 are concerned with the driver’s comfort.\n\nThere was some chassis shudder in the G37 convertible when traveling on bad roads. It’s worse when the top is down; you can see the windshield frame shake out of the corner of your eye on particularly poor pavement. The car feels a little more solid with the top up, but I heard some squeaking behind me from what I suspect were the roof panels moving against each other. All in all, the amount of chassis shudder wasn’t excessive. It’s a condition you’ll find in other convertibles — including the 335i — to varying degrees, but the squeakiness with the roof up isn’t normal.\n\nV-6 Performance\nThe G37 convertible is powered by a 3.7-liter V-6 that makes 325 horsepower. It’s a strong performer that never feels winded; if you need a quick burst of speed on the highway, just depress the gas pedal and the car will lunge ahead as it squats over its rear wheels.\n\nI liked the automatic transmission that’s standard in the base convertible (a six-speed manual comes in the Sport trim). The automatic has seven forward gears, and its shifts are unobtrusive and kickdowns come quickly. However, the shift quality of the transmission’s clutchless-manual mode isn’t the greatest; it feels like the transmission lunges from one gear to the next when you’re controlling gear changes. EPA-estimated gas mileage with the automatic is 17/25 mpg city/highway.\n\nThe Inside\nThe heated leather bucket seats offer quite a bit of side bolstering to keep you in place, and they were quite comfortable. Taller drivers will appreciate the long seat cushions, which provide plenty of thigh support.\n\nTop-up visibility in the G37 convertible is good thanks to its retractable-hardtop design, which features thin pillars that don’t obstruct rear visibility as much as some soft-tops’ do.\n\nWith the top down, the cabin gets pretty breezy around 65 mph, with some stronger buffeting now and then. You also hear much more of the growling exhaust note when the top’s down, and it sounds good.\n\nThe biggest downside of the convertible when compared against the coupe is its cargo area. If you don’t plan on lowering the roof, there’s a decent 10.3 cubic feet of space, but when you lower the three-piece roof it takes up nearly all of the trunk, leaving just 2 cubic feet near the bumper. It’s hard to fathom being able to fit even a small bag into this space, let alone a suitcase. Fortunately, the G37 convertible has a small backseat that, while not well-suited for adult passengers, could handle a few small suitcases with no problem.\n\nRetractable-Hardtop Trunk Space Compared (cu. ft.)\n \tTop up\tTop down\nBMW 3 Series\t9\tN/A\nInfiniti G37\t10.3\t2\nLexus IS C\t10.8\t2.4\nMercedes-Benz SLK-Class\t9.8\t6.5\nVolvo C70\t12.8\t6\nSource: Manufacturer data\n\nSafety\nStandard safety features include antilock brakes, an electronic stability system, side-impact airbags for the front seats, and active front head restraints. The convertible also features pop-up roll bars behind the backseat and curtain airbags that deploy from the side doors, as opposed to the roof, like in the coupe and sedan. Whereas the side curtain airbags in the coupe and sedan are designed to protect front and rear occupants, the convertible’s only offer protection for front-seat occupants. For a full list of the G37 convertible’s safety features, check out the Standard Equipment & Specs page.\n\nG37 Convertible in the Market\nI’ve been impressed with the latest iterations of the Infiniti G because it’s been one of the few models to take on the BMW 3 Series at its own game and really match it in terms of the driving experience — and at a lower starting price. The convertible continues that tradition, but the car’s top operation isn’t the slickest I’ve seen, and the lack of cargo space with the top down is a big drawback. Perhaps its $43,850 starting price — nearly $7,000 less than a 335i convertible — is enough to make up for those cons.\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in June 2012 about the 2012 Infiniti G37. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2013, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nWith Infiniti’s G lineup, there’s something for everyone. The brand’s best-selling car is offered in sedan, coupe and convertible body styles and in several performance levels, from the base G25 sedan (reviewed separately) to the high-performance IPL version of the G37 coupe, which is covered in this review. See them all compared here.\n\nThe 2012 Infiniti G37 IPL coupe is fast and agile, and it puts the P in Performance, but it’s not cheap. Yes, you get an extra bit of power, but you’re also stuck with a more brittle ride and ear-numbing road noise.\n\nMoreover, the G37 coupe is already a winner in the class; the IPL version increases the price, but it doesn’t add much value.\n\nThe IPL treatment adds a boost of horsepower, a sport-tuned suspension and specific interior and exterior trim. The coupe was the first vehicle in the IPL stable, and it will be joined by a convertible model later this year. Click here for our review of the G37 sedan.\n\nSmooth Power, Rough Ride\nDriving the IPL home after a long workweek was like slamming a shot of espresso. It’s fast and exhilaratingly fun to drive … but so is the base G37 coupe. The IPL adds 18 hp, but I really couldn’t feel the difference.\n\nCompared with the V-8 engines in rivals like the BMW M3 (414 hp) and Lexus IS-F (416 hp), the IPL’s 348-hp, 3.7-liter V-6 may look feeble by comparison, but it can at least play in the same arena. Its plentiful power is robust from a stop and smooth and strong at higher speeds, and it has the soundtrack to back it up. It snorts and burbles upon takeoff and then fades to a more subtle but still sporty note on the highway. (See the three models compared here.)\n\nOur test car was equipped with a six-speed manual transmission; a seven-speed automatic with paddle shifters is also available. The short-throw stick makes it easy to snap through shifts, though at times the action felt balky, and 1st gear occasionally required some force.\n\nThe G37 IPL is EPA rated at 17/25 mpg city/highway, beating the M3 (14/20 mpg) and IS-F (16/23 mpg) by a few digits. All three cars require premium fuel. I drove the Infiniti 182 miles (70 percent highway and 30 percent city) and got 19 mpg.\n\nMost of those miles hurt, however. The IPL sport suspension has had most of the regular G37’s comfort tuned out of it. The ride is firm, bordering on harsh. City potholes jar and resonate through the car. Things improve on the highway, but it still feels taught and jumpy over highway expansion joints. Its huge 19-inch wheels and low-profile summer tires don’t help matters.\n\nThe IPL shines in the agility department, however, with crisp cornering and virtually no body lean. Overall, the steering is responsive. It feels light around town but firms up at higher speeds.\n\nA Tight Fit\nRather than cramped, the front of the IPL’s cabin feels cozy, especially the heavily bolstered sport seats. I found them snug, especially while cornering, but some people may find them too constrictive.\n\nMy 5-foot-5 self had more than enough headroom and legroom in the driver’s seat, though the moonroof, which is standard in the IPL trim level, steals a couple of inches. My 6-foot-1 front passenger had to lower his seat in order to fit, which wasn’t the most comfortable position. Up front, there are 37.7 inches of headroom and 43.8 inches of legroom. Comparatively, the M3 coupe has a bit more front-seat headroom but less legroom. The IS-F sedan offers slightly less headroom but a bit more legroom.\n\nLike all G coupes, the backseat accommodates only two passengers; I missed the utility of four doors and seating for five. A long, heavy door and sloping roofline means getting into the backseat requires the usual stoop-twist coupe dance. No big deal for most, but not an easy feat when balancing a child-safety seat, which I shoehorned back there.\n\nIt’s very tough to get the right fit. A rear-facing convertible seat pushed the front passenger seat all the way forward, making it unusable. With the child seat in a forward-facing position, the heavily bolstered backseat made it tough to find a flat section to nestle it into. The biggest challenge, however, was connecting the top tether strap. Its anchor is in the far corner of the shelf behind the seat.\n\nSmaller adults should have an easier time fitting in the backseat; larger adults will be uncomfortable. Friends joked that the IPL looked like the Batmobile, but the backseat was like the Batcave. It’s set very low to the ground, putting passengers in an uncomfortable knees-up position. The IPL has 34.5 inches of rear-seat headroom and 29.8 inches of legroom. Both the M3 coupe and IS-F sedan offer several inches more of each.\n\nThe IPL’s trunk has a narrow-ish opening and a meager 7.4 cubic feet of cargo volume. The M3 has 11.1 cubic feet and the IS-F has 13.3 cubic feet. The IPL’s backseat folds in a single piece rather than a 50/50 split.\n\nCabin Comforts\nThe IPL’s refined interior is trimmed in premium-feel materials and has a dynamic look. Brushed aluminum looks classy, as does Infiniti’s hallmark analog clock. Soft-touch leather and plastic pieces are in all the necessary contact places. Red contrast stitching adds a nice pop to the otherwise completely graphite-colored interior. Monaco Red is another IPL-exclusive interior color.\n\nAn intrusive and unacceptable level of tire thrum and general road noise at highway speeds ruined the ambiance, however, stopping conversation. My passenger’s phone rang, and he opted to let it go to voice mail.\n\nInfiniti gets an A+ for its navigation system. It’s one of the easiest control interfaces out there, with an intuitive touch-screen and a large control knob that’s easier to reach. What’s even better is the navigation system doesn’t absorb the climate and audio controls. Those are separate knobs, which are clearly marked and reachable.\n\nFeatures & Pricing\nThe 2012 Infiniti G37 IPL starts at $50,695 including an $895 destination charge. Equipped with an optional trunk mat, first-aid kit and cargo net (a $200 package), my test car topped out at $50,895. BMW’s M3 starts at $62,295 and the Lexus IS-F at $62,175. The IPL may seem like a bargain, but the base G37 with the 330-hp, 3.7-liter V-6 starts at just $38,695. If you want a manual transmission, you need to jump up to the $45,095 G37 Sport coupe, which also nets you a Bose stereo, limited-slip differential, a navigation system with voice recognition, driver’s seat/mirrors/steering-wheel position memory, a backup camera with sonar system and a moonroof. It’s still a bargain compared with the IPL.\n\nThe G37 is one of those cars whose styling had aged well … until the IPL team got ahold of it. Infiniti IPL-ified it with gaudy and aggressive body cladding, transforming it into a cartoon version of itself. Sure, the unique front and rear bumpers, side sills, rear spoiler and wheels add visual drama, but they look overblown to me.\n\nSafety\nIn Insurance Institute for Highway Safety crash tests, the 2012 Infiniti G37 coupe received the highest score, Good, in frontal offset and side-impact tests. It scored Acceptable in roof strength and Marginal in rear-impact testing.\n\nThe G37 comes standard with a full complement of airbags including front, front-seat-mounted side-impact air bags and side curtain airbags for front and rear seats. As is required of all 2012 models, antilock brakes and an electronic stability system are standard. Click here for a full list of safety features.\n\nThe G37’s fetching curves come at the price of visibility. A small, dramatically raked rear window, thick pillars and narrow side windows compromise visibility. The IPL’s standard backup camera improves matters, but it could really use a blind spot warning system; one isn’t available. Adaptive cruise control with forward collision warning is optional on other versions of the G37 but unavailable on the IPL model.\n\nIn the Market\nThe main problem here is a good one for Infiniti: In regular form, the refined G37 coupe is already incredibly capable and exciting, which sets the bar pretty high for the IPL. Why pay a hefty price premium for the IPL? Its ride is too firm, road noise is off the charts and you get only 18 more horsepower — which it didn’t really need in the first place.\n\nCompared with the competition, the IPL may look like a deal, but to go up against the Ms and Fs of the world, it needs to offer more.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "The prevailing theory at MotherProof.com is that nearly any vehicle can work as a family car. Note that I said nearly. Not every car is capable of this feat. The 2010 Infiniti G37x coupe works as a family car, even with its two doors. However, I’m not sure the G37x coupe is worth the struggle required to accommodate life with kids.\n\nThere are cars that once you get in them all the hassles melt away because the car is fantastic and worth dealing with the little annoyances. That’s just not the case with the G37x coupe.\n\nFrom techie features to luxury items, my top-of-the-line test car came with all kinds of options. Because of this, my G37x cost $45,915. I’ll admit to experiencing sticker shock when I saw the price. The base price for the G37 coupe is $36,050.\n\nThe G37x’s V-6 had a little rumble to it, though not as much as I’d like. It accelerated smoothly and had solid braking. The drive was fun and nimble but lacked the giddy-up I was hoping for. The G37x comes with standard all-wheel drive, which is OK because we do get snow, slush and ice here in Colorado from time to time. If weather weren’t an issue or if this were my second car, I’d drop down a trim level to the G37 Sport with rear-wheel drive and a six-speed manual transmission.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe G37x coupe is shapely, smart and sexy looking.  Well, the grille is a little bland; but the rear end is beautiful. I do like a well-designed backside, and the G37x doesn’t disappoint with flared hips and a chrome-trimmed trunk.  While I wasn’t enchanted by my test car’s ho-hum silver color, there’s just enough shape and sparkle to make the G37x stand out.\n\nThis probably comes as no surprise, but the G37x coupe was tricky to get in and out of for my kids.  This was weird because they’re not new to coupes. They’re ages 6 and 8 now, so I’m not dealing with younger kids who need a lot of hand-holding. What was even weirder is that I had a difficult time pinpointing what made this car tricky for them. I think it was that the threshold was a little higher than average. Or it could be that everyone was cranky that week? Whatever it was, it wasn’t fun. Infiniti tried to make it easier on the kids with a button on the power front seats that moves them forward to allow someone to climb into the back. Then the seats move back into the original position.  I liked this feature a lot, but it didn’t seem to help my kids much.\n\nHere’s the other thing: While the G37x had decently long trunk space, it wasn’t high.  A large box of cereal wouldn’t fit standing up in the trunk. The truck has 7.5 cubic feet of space, but it’s not at all deep.\n\nThe G37x has a 330-horsepower, 3.7-liter V-6 engine that’s paired with a seven-speed automatic transmission. This trim level has all-wheel drive; the lower trims come with rear-wheel drive. The G37x gets an EPA-estimated 18/25 mpg city/highway and takes premium gas.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Not Really\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Some\n\nINTERIOR\nThe exterior of the G37x coupe is shapely and thoughtful. So, does the inside match the outside?  Yes, sort of. The car’s instrument display and center stack aren’t cluttered, and the materials are high-quality. However, the G37x doesn’t commit to being luxurious or sporty, so the interior lands somewhere in the middle.\n\nI fit in this car nicely. The black-colored heated leather seats were supportive but not overly bolstered.  All of the controls and mirrors are within easy reach. The cupholders also were easy to access, both in the front seat and the back.  During my test drive, one of the front cupholders rattled, but I figured out it was an insert in there that once removed returned the car to a quiet zone.\n\nThe G37x’s navigation system was terrifically simple to use despite the number of intimidating buttons below the screen. I’m always pleased when the systems are obvious and intuitive.  There was also an analog clock set into the center stack that was a nice touch.\n\nIn the back, the seats were deep, with a nice amount of legroom.  As can happen with coupes, however, the headroom is good only until a certain point.  I’m 5 feet 5 inches tall and was comfortable with the headroom in the backseat. But put a taller person in the back and they’ll be uncomfortable quickly.\n\nI liked the dedicated console between the second row’s two seats.  It’s actually more like a tray than a storage cubby because it doesn’t open, but the kids loved the cupholders that popped up out of the front of it. This arrangement means that getting a third person in the backseat isn’t possible; this car is a four-seater.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Puny\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Puny\n\nSAFETY\nThe G37x coupe’s Latch system is tricky to use. The two sets of lower Latch anchors sit under a slit in the leather. You’ll really need to check the fit of your kids’ car seats because the rear seats are so bolstered. Some wider child-safety seats just won’t fit back there, so be sure you bring your car seats along for your test drive. The second row’s legroom is great for kids in booster seats and forward-facing convertible seats if you can get them in there.\n\nIn the driver’s seat, I had problems with the seat belt. No matter what I did the shoulder belt rode up the side of my neck and the lap belt sat closer to my belly than my hip bones. I felt like it would have fit better if I were taller. This became a serious safety concern as I drove the car.\n\nThe G37x has many standard safety features such as all-wheel drive, four-wheel-disc antilock brakes with brake assist, traction control, an electronic stability system, a backup camera and six airbags including side-impact airbags for the front row and side curtains for both rows.\n\nOptional adaptive cruise control alerts the driver, preloads the brakes and tightens seat belts if it senses rapidly decelerating traffic ahead of it.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2010 Infiniti G37x coupe here.",

      "expert_review": "With Infiniti’s G lineup, there’s something for everyone. The brand’s best-selling car is offered in sedan, coupe and convertible body styles and in several performance levels, from the base G25 sedan (reviewed separately) to the high-performance IPL version of the G37 coupe, which is covered in this review. See them all compared here.\n\nThe 2012 Infiniti G37 IPL coupe is fast and agile, and it puts the P in Performance, but it’s not cheap. Yes, you get an extra bit of power, but you’re also stuck with a more brittle ride and ear-numbing road noise.\n\nMoreover, the G37 coupe is already a winner in the class; the IPL version increases the price, but it doesn’t add much value.\n\nThe IPL treatment adds a boost of horsepower, a sport-tuned suspension and specific interior and exterior trim. The coupe was the first vehicle in the IPL stable, and it will be joined by a convertible model later this year. Click here for our review of the G37 sedan.\n\nSmooth Power, Rough Ride\nDriving the IPL home after a long workweek was like slamming a shot of espresso. It’s fast and exhilaratingly fun to drive … but so is the base G37 coupe. The IPL adds 18 hp, but I really couldn’t feel the difference.\n\nCompared with the V-8 engines in rivals like the BMW M3 (414 hp) and Lexus IS-F (416 hp), the IPL’s 348-hp, 3.7-liter V-6 may look feeble by comparison, but it can at least play in the same arena. Its plentiful power is robust from a stop and smooth and strong at higher speeds, and it has the soundtrack to back it up. It snorts and burbles upon takeoff and then fades to a more subtle but still sporty note on the highway. (See the three models compared here.)\n\nOur test car was equipped with a six-speed manual transmission; a seven-speed automatic with paddle shifters is also available. The short-throw stick makes it easy to snap through shifts, though at times the action felt balky, and 1st gear occasionally required some force.\n\nThe G37 IPL is EPA rated at 17/25 mpg city/highway, beating the M3 (14/20 mpg) and IS-F (16/23 mpg) by a few digits. All three cars require premium fuel. I drove the Infiniti 182 miles (70 percent highway and 30 percent city) and got 19 mpg.\n\nMost of those miles hurt, however. The IPL sport suspension has had most of the regular G37’s comfort tuned out of it. The ride is firm, bordering on harsh. City potholes jar and resonate through the car. Things improve on the highway, but it still feels taught and jumpy over highway expansion joints. Its huge 19-inch wheels and low-profile summer tires don’t help matters.\n\nThe IPL shines in the agility department, however, with crisp cornering and virtually no body lean. Overall, the steering is responsive. It feels light around town but firms up at higher speeds.\n\nA Tight Fit\nRather than cramped, the front of the IPL’s cabin feels cozy, especially the heavily bolstered sport seats. I found them snug, especially while cornering, but some people may find them too constrictive.\n\nMy 5-foot-5 self had more than enough headroom and legroom in the driver’s seat, though the moonroof, which is standard in the IPL trim level, steals a couple of inches. My 6-foot-1 front passenger had to lower his seat in order to fit, which wasn’t the most comfortable position. Up front, there are 37.7 inches of headroom and 43.8 inches of legroom. Comparatively, the M3 coupe has a bit more front-seat headroom but less legroom. The IS-F sedan offers slightly less headroom but a bit more legroom.\n\nLike all G coupes, the backseat accommodates only two passengers; I missed the utility of four doors and seating for five. A long, heavy door and sloping roofline means getting into the backseat requires the usual stoop-twist coupe dance. No big deal for most, but not an easy feat when balancing a child-safety seat, which I shoehorned back there.\n\nIt’s very tough to get the right fit. A rear-facing convertible seat pushed the front passenger seat all the way forward, making it unusable. With the child seat in a forward-facing position, the heavily bolstered backseat made it tough to find a flat section to nestle it into. The biggest challenge, however, was connecting the top tether strap. Its anchor is in the far corner of the shelf behind the seat.\n\nSmaller adults should have an easier time fitting in the backseat; larger adults will be uncomfortable. Friends joked that the IPL looked like the Batmobile, but the backseat was like the Batcave. It’s set very low to the ground, putting passengers in an uncomfortable knees-up position. The IPL has 34.5 inches of rear-seat headroom and 29.8 inches of legroom. Both the M3 coupe and IS-F sedan offer several inches more of each.\n\nThe IPL’s trunk has a narrow-ish opening and a meager 7.4 cubic feet of cargo volume. The M3 has 11.1 cubic feet and the IS-F has 13.3 cubic feet. The IPL’s backseat folds in a single piece rather than a 50/50 split.\n\nCabin Comforts\nThe IPL’s refined interior is trimmed in premium-feel materials and has a dynamic look. Brushed aluminum looks classy, as does Infiniti’s hallmark analog clock. Soft-touch leather and plastic pieces are in all the necessary contact places. Red contrast stitching adds a nice pop to the otherwise completely graphite-colored interior. Monaco Red is another IPL-exclusive interior color.\n\nAn intrusive and unacceptable level of tire thrum and general road noise at highway speeds ruined the ambiance, however, stopping conversation. My passenger’s phone rang, and he opted to let it go to voice mail.\n\nInfiniti gets an A+ for its navigation system. It’s one of the easiest control interfaces out there, with an intuitive touch-screen and a large control knob that’s easier to reach. What’s even better is the navigation system doesn’t absorb the climate and audio controls. Those are separate knobs, which are clearly marked and reachable.\n\nFeatures & Pricing\nThe 2012 Infiniti G37 IPL starts at $50,695 including an $895 destination charge. Equipped with an optional trunk mat, first-aid kit and cargo net (a $200 package), my test car topped out at $50,895. BMW’s M3 starts at $62,295 and the Lexus IS-F at $62,175. The IPL may seem like a bargain, but the base G37 with the 330-hp, 3.7-liter V-6 starts at just $38,695. If you want a manual transmission, you need to jump up to the $45,095 G37 Sport coupe, which also nets you a Bose stereo, limited-slip differential, a navigation system with voice recognition, driver’s seat/mirrors/steering-wheel position memory, a backup camera with sonar system and a moonroof. It’s still a bargain compared with the IPL.\n\nThe G37 is one of those cars whose styling had aged well … until the IPL team got ahold of it. Infiniti IPL-ified it with gaudy and aggressive body cladding, transforming it into a cartoon version of itself. Sure, the unique front and rear bumpers, side sills, rear spoiler and wheels add visual drama, but they look overblown to me.\n\nSafety\nIn Insurance Institute for Highway Safety crash tests, the 2012 Infiniti G37 coupe received the highest score, Good, in frontal offset and side-impact tests. It scored Acceptable in roof strength and Marginal in rear-impact testing.\n\nThe G37 comes standard with a full complement of airbags including front, front-seat-mounted side-impact air bags and side curtain airbags for front and rear seats. As is required of all 2012 models, antilock brakes and an electronic stability system are standard. Click here for a full list of safety features.\n\nThe G37’s fetching curves come at the price of visibility. A small, dramatically raked rear window, thick pillars and narrow side windows compromise visibility. The IPL’s standard backup camera improves matters, but it could really use a blind spot warning system; one isn’t available. Adaptive cruise control with forward collision warning is optional on other versions of the G37 but unavailable on the IPL model.\n\nIn the Market\nThe main problem here is a good one for Infiniti: In regular form, the refined G37 coupe is already incredibly capable and exciting, which sets the bar pretty high for the IPL. Why pay a hefty price premium for the IPL? Its ride is too firm, road noise is off the charts and you get only 18 more horsepower — which it didn’t really need in the first place.\n\nCompared with the competition, the IPL may look like a deal, but to go up against the Ms and Fs of the world, it needs to offer more.\n\nemail",
