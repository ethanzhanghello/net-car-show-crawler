      "expert_review": "The 2008 Infiniti EX35 Journey wants to get up and go; it’s one of the zippiest cars I’ve driven in recent memory. It’s attractive to look at and lots of fun to drive. Of course, a powerful engine like the EX35’s cuts down a bit on fuel efficiency, which is an EPA-estimated 16/23 mpg city/highway. I was averaging about 19 mpg. Fuel prices are lower for now, but I’d still like to see a car this size do a better job with fuel efficiency.\n\nThe EX35 is a car that has much to recommend it: it’s comfortable; it has cutting-edge technological features that make life prettier and easier (think self-repairing paint and a power-folding backseat); welcome lighting that senses your Intelligent Key and responds by casting a radiant glow in the car to say “hello” as you approach; lovely design elements; great safety features; and, gosh darn it, it just feels good.\n\nOh, how I enjoyed driving this car, but it wasn’t meant to be between us. For someone like me who has wee children, there just wasn’t enough room. How rude! Alas, while this isn’t a car for me at this stage of my life, I’d recommend that anyone beyond the diapers’ stage give this car a look.\n\nThis is going to sound plain old nutty, but the EX35 is styled like an Infiniti (I know, it is an Infiniti). Let me explain: Infinitis are good-looking cars, and the EX35 is really good-looking. It reminded me of a modern bombshell with curves in all the right places, a lovely profile and just enough sass to feel right. While test driving the EX35, I received many compliments on its looks, which made me feel like I was kind of a modern bombshell, too!\n\nOne thing I’d love to have as a modern bombshell would be the ability to minimize blemishes and fine lines without having to think about it. Well, they haven’t invented such a thing for humans yet, but the EX35 comes with Scratch Shield paint that Infiniti says can repair fine scratches and damage. Thanks to a flexible resin and clearcoat combination (and a little magic, if you ask me), the paint apparently minimizes scratches over the course of a week or so. Since I tend to find new little wrinkles…er…scratches on my car daily, this Scratch Shield paint sounds like a dream come true. Now if I can just get Infiniti to work on something for the fine lines on my face…\n\nThe EX35 has dual power and heated side mirrors that are nice and big; LED taillights and front fog lights; and an available Adaptive Front Lighting system that swivels the xenon headlights when you turn your steering wheel thereby lighting the road where you need it most. I’m starting to see this feature as an option on many cars and can only wish that someday it’s standard. For someone like me with poor night vision, it makes a difference.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair\n\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Groove On\n\nThe EX35 looks good from the inside, too. My test car has the optional maple wood trim, which I liked a lot; the standard piano black lacquer with aluminum detail is also quite attractive. Infiniti claims to offer potential buyers “an array of emotive color and texture combinations, inspired by the four seasons” to tailor the EX35 to your taste and personality. That’s what I call design accommodation! You also get standard keyless access with push-button start and Automatic Temperature Control with microfiltration, which means that the air inside the cabin should be pretty clean.\n\nThe front seats were comfortable enough. The optional driver’s seat-mounted coat hangar was a nifty little feature; I really wish I’d discovered it before I’d taken my dry cleaning home. It was great because it eliminates that pesky blind spot that dry cleaning creates when it’s hanging in the traditional spot above one of the back doors.\n\nAnother convenient feature is the power-folding second-row seat, which is standard. With the push of a button, you can fold the entire second row down or just one side of the 60/40-split backseat. It works quickly, and it’s beyond easy to use.\n\nDespite the power-folding feat, the second row was ultimately the site of my falling out with the EX35. The cramped second row took the EX35 off of my list of Cars That a Person With Very Young Children Can Have. I betcha didn’t even know such a list existed, did you? Well, it does (if only in my mind). The Latch anchors were tough to get to and two child-safety seats made things a little cramped back there for the kids. Even worse, a rear-facing infant seat in the backseat left little to no room for someone sitting in the front passenger seat. A very small person could’ve fit, but how many members of the Lollipop Guild have you had in your car lately?\n\nI wasn’t fully satisfied with the cargo space behind the second row, either. At 16.8 cubic feet, it falls about 10 cubic feet short of what other cars in this class offer. I can’t stress enough that if you have older children and/or don’t need that much cargo room in back, you should give the EX35 a try.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair/Ample\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\nThe EX35 comes standard with a slew of good safety features, including active front head restraints; four-wheel-disc antilock brakes; side-impact airbags for the front seats; side curtain airbags for both the front and back rows; an occupant classification system that adjusts airbags based on crash severity and seat belt usage; and traction control with an electronic stability system.\n\nThe Around View Monitor system that’s available with the Technology Package ($1,950) literally takes your full environment into account. It uses cameras on every side of the EX35 to see objects or cars and presents it all to you on the central screen. With a camera system this sophisticated, you can rest assured that this is a car that’ll promptly alert you if you’re about to hit anything, no matter the direction.\n\nThe Technology Package also includes a Lane Departure Prevention system that alerts you if you drift into another lane when you’re going over 45 mph. The system first sounds an alarm and then lightly applies the brakes while you get back on track. Since I’m such a precise driver (ha), I had to “pretend” to go adrift in my lane. Sure enough, the trusty EX35 beeped me back into submission and kept me on the straight and narrow.\n\nFAMILY LIFESTAGE\n\nIn Diapers: There’s not enough room, especially if you’re using a rear-facing infant seat.\n\nIn School: It’d work fine for kids who are in booster seats and older.\n\nTeens: They’d be the envy of their friends after being dropped off at school in this car.",

      "expert_review": "As soon as I took off in the 2011 Infiniti EX35, I immediately felt like I was driving with my grandmother. I mean that in a good way. With her desire to keep me and my passengers safe, she lets me know if anyone is in my blind spot or if someone suddenly stops in front of me. While the EX35 lacks my grandmother’s obscene hand gestures, its lane departure prevention and blind spot warning systems made me feel at ease on the road.\n\nThe 2011 Infiniti EX35 is loaded with features to keep a family safe and make life easier, but it isn’t loaded with legroom.\n\nThe lack of interior space is this midsize luxury crossover’s glaring problem. It’s too small for a family of four. While the front row’s legroom was adequate, the rear legroom was severely lacking.\n\nWith a V-6 engine, the EX35 has the power of an SUV, but it felt as lightweight as a sportier car. It hugged curves and corners, and merging onto the freeway was effortless. The suspension easily absorbed potholes and other road imperfections.\n\nThe 2011 EX35 has a starting MRSP of $35,200. My test car, an EX35 Journey with rear-wheel drive, starts at $37,400, but when all the bells and whistles of the Technology and Touring packages were added on, so is another couple grand. The model I tested was priced at $45,205.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe EX35 was a crowd-pleaser and turned heads as I drove by. I should mention that it was primarily female heads that were turned. That’s understandable because the EX35’s curvy profile was an attention-getter, and my Arctic Blue — aka baby blue — test car only added to it.\n\nWith its low step-in height, my 3-year-old had no problems getting in the crossover. The liftgate opened easily, but the cargo area was really small. It was so shallow that I was unable to fit my double jog stroller in it. I had to break out the umbrella stroller instead. While the cargo area was small, it was at a convenient diaper-changing height.\n\nThe EX35 is powered by a 297-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 engine that’s paired to a new-for-2011 seven-speed automatic transmission. Both the rear- and all-wheel-drive EX35 get an EPA-estimated 17/24 mpg city/highway, and with a recommendation of premium fuel, filling up the tank could cost a pretty penny.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Groove-On\n\nINTERIOR\nWhile the EX35 was as beautiful on the inside as it was on the outside, the five-seater still lacked the size and space that a family of four needs. The interior was beautifully appointed with buttery leather seats and maple wood trim.\n\nThe center stack took some getting used to, though. It felt more like a plane’s cockpit with a multitude of buttons, controls and switches. A simpler layout would have been appreciated since I spent too much time searching for the correct control when I should have been looking at the road.\n\nWhen it came to storage space in the EX35, there wasn’t much to be found. There were four cupholders, a decent-sized glove box and seatback pockets for the second row, but no hidden cubbies for cellphones and more.\n\nIn the second row, the outboard seats are wide with seat bolsters to help keep passengers in place during aggressive driving. Because my daughters were in their child-safety seats, they didn’t get to experience the supple leather seats. However, my 3-year-old made sure to voice her complaints about the tight legroom in the backseat. She felt cramped in her forward-facing convertible. Infiniti needs to carve out some extra legroom for the second row when it redesigns this crossover.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\nSAFETY\nThe EX35 may have missed the mark on storage space and rear legroom; however, it earns extra points for its safety features.\n\nThe 2011 EX35 has been named a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. To receive this safety award, a car must receive the top score of Good in frontal-offset, side-impact, rear and rollover crash tests as well as have an electronic stability system. The EX35 received four out of five stars in rollover crash tests performed by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nIt has standard rear-wheel drive, active front head restraints, an electronic stability system with traction control and six airbags, including side curtains for both rows. Optional safety features include all-wheel drive and a backup camera.\n\nThe optional Technology Package ($2,700) includes adaptive cruise control, a blind spot warning system, lane departure and lane prevention warning systems, and Intelligent Brake Assist with Forward Collision Warning, which alerts the driver of stopping traffic and brakes appropriately. While the multitude of warning beeps and lights can be annoying at first, it made me more aware driver — kind of like when Grandma’s in the car.\n\nAlso worth noting is the optional Around View Monitor, a set of cameras mounted on all sides of the car that gives a bird’s-eye view of your surroundings on the navigation screen. This feature makes parallel parking a breeze.\n\nThe EX35 has two sets of easy-to-use lower Latch anchors in the second row’s outboard seats. The seat belt buckles are on stable bases, making it easier for older children in booster seats to buckle up independently.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2011 Infiniti EX35 here.",

      "expert_review": "Infiniti’s EX35 compact crossover is back for 2010 with more standard equipment and some technological enhancements.\n\nIntroduced two years ago, the EX35 has become one of the best-selling models in the Infiniti lineup, offering sporty performance in a car that has seating for five and SUV-style cargo-carrying capability.\n\nA junior version of the larger FX, the EX has essentially the same engine as the FX35 (six-cylinder) model, but starts about $9,000 less, at $33,800 (plus $865 freight).\n\nFor 2010, the navigation system is available as a stand-alone option on the base model, but was standard on our Journey tester.\n\nNew standard features include heated front seats on all-wheel-drive models (probably because these are sold mostly in snow country), heated outside mirrors on all models, automatic headlights, Bluetooth hands-free phone system on Journey models, and a USB port for iPods.\n\nModels with the Bose premium audio system and without the navigation system now have a two-gigabyte hard drive for onboard music storage.\n\nBeyond those changes, the EX returned mostly unchanged for 2010.\n\nOur tester was the rear-wheel-drive Journey model, the uplevel version of the EX, which lists for $36,000 (plus freight). The top model is the all-wheel-drive Journey, at $37,400; with all available options, though, the price can go as high as $45,000.\n\nAdded as standard features last year on the base EX were leather seats, a rear-view camera, rear climate-control vents and polished aluminum roof rails.\n\nWhile EX buyers so far have been predominantly men, the vehicle was designed to appeal to women as well. Key competitors are the Acura RDX, BMW X3 and Audi Q5. But the EX also competes with sedans in the entry-premium segment as well.\n\nBased on the chassis of the 2008 G35 sedan, the EX essentially is a wagon version of the G (whose name is now G37, reflecting a larger engine).\n\nUnder the hood of the EX is the same engine used in the earlier G35, a 297-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6. It’s connected to a five-speed automatic transmission also taken from the G35.\n\nEPA ratings are 17 mpg city/24 highway with rear-wheel drive and 16/23 with all-wheel drive.\n\nThe rear-drive system helps give the EX its sporty handling. Most crossovers have front-wheel drive (although most, like the EX, are available with all-wheel drive). The EX35 is the only vehicle in its segment with a choice of rear- or all-wheel drive, however.\n\nThe all-wheel drive is good for snow and rain, but also helps guide the car through curves on dry pavement, as well. It’s not intended for serious off-road driving, however, as it does not feature low-range gearing. The car also has limited ground clearance.\n\nHigh-tech gadgetry includes an around-view monitor system, self-healing exterior paint, a 3-D navigation screen, and a lane-departure warning and correction system.\n\nThe EX features a long hood, short front and rear overhangs, and wheels pushed to the corners. It includes a double-arch grille, large L-shaped headlights (with an available bi-xenon adaptive front lighting system), integrated fog lights, LED taillights and an arch profile.\n\nAlso included are a spoiler on top of the rear hatch, dual chrome exhaust tips, an optional power moon roof, and optional roof cargo rails.\n\nSpecial attention was given to the interior design, which includes practical features such as an optional coat hanger in the rear of the driver’s seat, and a power-fold-down rear seat that allows for easy expansion of the cargo area at the touch of a button. Those buttons are found either in the rear of the cargo compartment or on the dash, and will also raise the seat.\n\nFront-seat height is higher than that of the average sedan, but lower than in the typical SUV.\n\nOther features include easy-to-read gauges with white and violet lighting, an analog clock, and hospitality lighting, with an LED beaming a penlight down from above the center console.\n\nThe navigation system, included on our vehicle, comes with a seven-inch LCD screen in the middle of the instrument panel. It includes a 9.3-gigabyte hard drive for music storage and playback\n\nIn front, the bucket seats are roomy and comfortable. There is limited legroom in the rear with the front seats all the way back, but that’s normal in the compact segment. Adults can sit back there, but children find it more comfortable.\n\nThe center console and instrument stack come with black lacquer and aluminum trim, but maple wood trim is optional.\n\nProbably the coolest feature is the around-view monitor system, which uses four cameras, one each in the grille, on the rear above the license plate, and on the side mirrors, to produce a bird’s-eye view of the area around the car on the dash monitor. The idea is to give the driver a “top-down view” of the car while parking, Infiniti said.\n\nAnother high-tech feature is the lane-departure prevention system, which goes beyond the lane-departure warning systems on some other luxury vehicles. When the EX system detects the vehicle drifting out of its traffic lane, the brakes engage slightly to give the car a gentle push back into its lane. The beeping of the system as the car approaches the center or edge stripes on the road can be a bit annoying, however.\n\nHelping to keep the exterior nice is the Scratch Shield paint, which self-heals small scratches – such as those from fingernails under the door handles. The process can take from a day to a week, depending on the outside temperature and the depth of the scratch. This is possible because of a special soft elastic resin in the clearcoat paint. It won’t correct severe scratches though, just the minor everyday ones.\n\nThe EX also comes with the Infiniti Intelligent Key system with pushbutton start, which allows the key to remain in a pocket or purse. Optional is XM satellite radio.\n\nOther standard items include an eight-way power driver’s seat with two-way manual lumbar support, and a four-way power passenger seat. Optional are a driver’s seat memory system and an eight-way power passenger seat.\n\nOur vehicle also had the Technology Package ($2,250), which added the lane-departure system, radar cruise control, and intelligent brake assist with forward collision warning; and the Bose audio system with around-view monitor ($2,150).\n\nWe also had the Premium Package ($1,750), which brought the driver’s seat memory (including outside-mirrors and steering-wheel positions), eight-way power front passenger seat, xenon adaptive headlights that turn toward the way the vehicle is turning, aluminum roof rails, the coat hanger on the back of the driver’s seat, power-folding rear seat, and a universal garage opener. Illuminated kick plates added $280 to our car, as well.\n\nTotal sticker for our tester was $43,295, including freight and options.\n\nBut it’s really not necessary to pay that much for an EX35, if you can live without all the high-priced extras. Without them, you’d still have a great premium crossover for under $35,000, including leather interior.\n\nThe automotive columns of G.

      "expert_review": "Parents often have a hard time delineating their lives as individuals from their status as “So and So’s mom.” Our whole lives change to revolve around our kiddos, from the way we dress (no more dry clean-only clothing) to what we drive (no more hot little Volvo C30 for me, a mom of three).\n\nThe 2012_Infiniti_EX35 compact luxury crossover is a clever car that bridges that gap between form and function.\n\nCompeting with the likes of the BMW X3, Cadillac SRX and Mercedes-Benz GLK-Class, the EX35 seats five, so it’s not intended as a mega family-hauler. However, my family of five — three of whom are ages 11 and younger — fit just fine. My two youngest rode in narrow Bubble Bum booster seats in the outboard seating positions, while my oldest sat in the middle in the backseat. Once carpool drop-off was done, I no longer felt like a Sherpa hired for my ability to schlep kids, booster seats and science fair projects. It was just me: a modern woman in a modern crossover heading out for afternoon yoga and a Friday night sushi date with my sexy husband.\n\nWhile my test car was the higher, Journey trim level with all-wheel drive, both the Journey and the base trim are also available with rear-wheel drive. See them all compared side-by-side here.\n\nEXTERIOR\nMany of Infiniti’s designs are polarizing, falling into either the love-it or the hate-it category. Take the FX and EX, for example. I’m not a fan of the bulbous, jowled FX, but my test EX — in gorgeous, sparkling Midnight Garnet with softer, smoother lines and a purposefully low stance — had an upscale uniqueness that sat well with me. My husband, however, thought its proportions were just plain weird. Tomato tomahto.\n\nThe EX’s height is perfect for someone of smaller stature, like me (I’m 5-foot-3). I opened up the door and slid right into the driver’s seat, no ducking down or climbing up required. That may sound like a small thing, but the amount of energy I saved by not having to heft my kids up and into a huge SUV without running boards and then climb up and in myself was noticeable.\n\nFAMILY-FRIENDLY FEATURES\nOther than offering seating for five, the EX doesn’t go above and beyond in terms of family considerations. But because I loved so many other things about the EX, I was willing to overlook a few shortcomings, mainly its lack of storage space.\n\nThere’s a moderately sized center console between the driver and passenger seats, plus two cupholders up front. The cupholders, however, are a smidge too close together. When my husband and I both had Starbucks cups in there, their lids fought for first place, requiring us to remove one cup to avoid popping the lid off the other. Maybe not the biggest burden in the world, but this is a luxury vehicle. We like to take long weekend road trips together, and this would definitely prove an annoyance over time.\n\nThere’s a tiny compartment just large enough to stash the remote key fob in front of the gearshift. Beyond that, I was at a loss as to where to store my iPhone — important to have out when driving, as I often use it to route me. I guess I could have used the in-car navigation system, but my phone is so much easier and more reliable.\n\nThere are very narrow storage pockets in each of the front two doors — just large enough for a folded newspaper or a small clutch bag for a night out – but no extra bottle holders and no storage in the rear doors.\n\nWhen the center seat wasn’t occupied, my kids had access to two more cupholders in the backseat’s fold-down center armrest. There’s also a pocket on the back of each front seat. While the backseat was perfectly functional for two kids (and on occasion three) with kid-sized limbs, it’s tight for full-sized adults. Maybe you should drive your minivan instead of the EX35 when picking up your friends for a double date, or consider one of the EX’s competitors. Whereas the EX has 28.5 inches of backseat legroom, the X3 has 36.8, the SRX 36.3 and the GLK 35.1 inches.\n\nRather than write the EX off due to its lack of nooks and crannies, I found myself brainstorming ways to get creative and circumvent the problem. After all, couldn’t we all use a little incentive to streamline our lives and the crud we carry in our cars? An organized environment leads to an organized mind, right?\n\nOne place that didn’t require us to trim down our load was the cargo area. Strictly by the numbers, the other models mentioned have between 4.7 and 11.2 cubic feet more volume behind their backseats, but I found the EX’s 18.6 cubic feet to be more than enough space for several suitcases. If we had needed more room, we could have folded the split rear seat flat to expand the cargo space to a total of 47.4 cubic feet. The process is very simple: Just press either release button in the cargo area. To raise them again for the kids to get in later, opting for the deluxe Touring Package gets you a power-operated switch near the gearshift that raises each portion automatically. I was surprised and disappointed that my $45,000 test car didn’t come equipped with a power liftgate, as well.\n\nThe visual Zen on the inside of the EX carried my post-anniversary spa peace through the entire weekend. The uber-luxe wheat-colored leather seats, steering wheel and trim, punctuated with dark maple accents, felt calm and meditative.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Puny\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Groove On\n\nBEHIND THE WHEEL\nThe EX’s 297-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 engine was pure joy to drive. The all-wheel-drive EX had the perfect balance of sporty and responsive acceleration, informative road feedback and stability while cornering over mountain passes. The kicker is that there’s also enough softness in the suspension to be comfortable for me both as a daily driver and for long road trips. I experienced no fatigue even after hours in the EX. I even found myself creating extra errands. (What? Our spice cabinet is all out of Spanish saffron threads? I’ll run out to the specialty spice market to pick some up, you know, just in case we decide to whip up some paella later tonight. No, really, it’s OK. You can stay home and help the kids with their homework. I’ll be fine.)\n\nOne downside is the EX35’s larger-than-expected, 36-foot turning circle. The rear-wheel-drive version’s turning diameter is slightly smaller, at 34.8 feet. I had to execute a three-pointer every time I pulled into my garage. Because the EX drives so much more like a car than an SUV, my subconscious expected a tighter, more carlike turning circle — and gas mileage. Getting an estimated 17/24 mpg city/highway, the EX isn’t exactly a green- or budget-conscious option.\n\nSAFETY\nIn crash tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the Infiniti EX35 gets the highest mark, Good, in all tests, and is thus listed as a Top Safety Pick. While the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has not yet crash-tested the EX, it did rate its rollover resistance at 4 out of 5 stars (common for most crossovers today).\n\nAs is required of all 2012 models, the Infiniti EX35 has standard antilock brakes, an electronic stability system and traction control.\n\nThe EX features frontal airbags, seat-mounted side-impact airbags for the driver and front passenger, and roof-mounted curtain airbags for the front and rear seats.\n\nThe EX has two sets of lower anchors in the backseat as part of the Latch system for securing child-safety seats. The anchors are for the two outboard seating positions and are accessible via vertical slits in the seat bight. For kids in booster seats, the rear seat belt buckles are on stable bases, which typically makes it easier for kids with limited dexterity to buckle up on their own. However, since these buckles are flush with the bottom seat cushion, booster seats can have a tendency to wiggle and worm themselves on top of the buckle, requiring parental intervention.\n\nMy test car came equipped with an Around View Monitor as part of a $2,900 Premium Package. This is a fantastic feature for anyone who needs to park in tight spaces, but it’s especially useful for families, giving you a 360-degree view around the car to make sure no kiddos or pets or tricycles are in your way before you even think about putting the car into reverse.\n\nThe small triangular windows alongside the cargo space cut down a bit on rear visibility in the EX, so I would have appreciated blind spot monitors to help out while trying to change lanes on the highway. This feature is available on the Journey trim as a part of an optional Technology Package.\n\nSee all the standard safety features listed here.\n\nSend Kristin an email",
