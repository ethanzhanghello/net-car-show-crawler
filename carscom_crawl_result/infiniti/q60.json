The Q60 is available with rear- or all-wheel drive, and competitors include the Audi A5, BMW 4 Series and Lexus RC.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2022 Infiniti Q60?\n\nWireless Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity is now standard. \n\nWhat Features in the 2022 Infiniti Q60 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\nLED headlights\nSimulated leather upholstery\nDual-screen multimedia system\nWireless Apple CarPlay \nAndroid Auto\nSatellite radio\nWi-Fi hot spot\nDual-zone automatic air conditioning\nAutomatic emergency braking\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nAdaptive headlights\nRemote start\nLeather-trimmed seats\nHeated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nBose premium stereo\nNavigation\n360-degree camera system\nAdaptive cruise control\nBlind spot warning\nLane departure prevention\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nAdaptive suspension\nShould I Buy the 2022 Infiniti Q60?\n\nThe Q60’s driving experience is a solid blend of luxury and performance, but the coupe’s dual-screen multimedia system isn’t the most intuitive. The car’s backseat is also snug. That said, the Q60 has head-turning looks, and the availability of all-wheel drive adds all-season practicality.",

The Q60 is available with rear- or all-wheel drive, and competitors include the BMW 4 Series, Lexus RC and Audi A5.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2021 Infiniti Q60?\n\nRain-sensing windshield wipers are now standard.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Infiniti Q60?\n\nThe Infiniti Q60 is a sport coupe that can seat up to four. It comes standard with a 300-horsepower, twin-turbo 3.0-liter V-6 engine that works with a seven-speed automatic transmission. A 400-hp version of the engine goes in Red Sport models. The Q60 is available with rear- or all-wheel drive, and competitors include the BMW 4 Series, Lexus RC and Audi A5.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Infiniti Q60?\n\nA new generation of the dual-screen InTouch multimedia system includes HD displays and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity.\n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Infiniti Q60 Are Most Important?\n\nThe standard twin-turbo V-6 should offer plenty of performance for most drivers, and the available all-wheel-drive system will appeal to those who live in the snow belt. Enthusiasts will likely gravitate to the Red Sport 400 and its 400-hp V-6 engine.\n\nAvailable active safety features include forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, blind spot warning, rear cross-traffic alert, backup collision intervention, full-speed adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning and prevention, and high-beam assist.\n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Infiniti Q60?\n\nThe Q60’s driving experience is a good blend of luxury and performance, and its appeal is enhanced for 2020 with the addition of standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. The coupe’s dual-screen multimedia system isn’t the most intuitive, however, and — perhaps not surprisingly — its backseat is small.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Infiniti Q60?\n\nThe 2019 Infiniti Q60 is a sports coupe that can seat up to four. It comes standard with a 300-horsepower, twin-turbo 3.0-liter V-6 engine that works with a seven-speed automatic transmission. The Q60 can be had with rear- or all-wheel drive, and competitors include the BMW 4 Series, Lexus RC and Audi A5.\n\nWhat's New on the 2019 Infiniti Q60?\n\nThe twin-turbo V-6 is now the standard engine, and the Luxe and Red Sport 400 trims gain predictive forward collision warning and automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Infiniti Q60 Are Most Important?\n\nWith the newly standard twin-turbo V-6, the Q60 has more performance potential on tap from the get-go, and the available AWD system will appeal to drivers in certain parts of the country. Enthusiasts will likely gravitate to the Red Sport 400 and its 400-hp V-6 engine. An available 360-degree camera system enhances overall visibility.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Infiniti Q60?\n\nThe Q60's driving experience is a good blend of luxury and performance, but the car is missing useful features like Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity, and its dual-screen multimedia system isn't the most intuitive. Perhaps not surprisingly, its backseat is also small.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nInfiniti is introducing an updated coupe at the 2016 North American International Auto Show in Detroit. The 2017 Q60 is the two-door version of the Q50 sedan and was previewed by the Q60 Concept we saw a year ago. The production model shares a platform and powertrains with the Q50, which receives three new engines for the 2017 model year.\nExterior\nWhile it’s not as wild as the Q60 Concept, much of that car’s flavor and style translates to the production 2017 Q60 coupe. It’s lower and wider than the car it replaces, and it features many of Infiniti’s distinctive styling elements like the spindle grille, crescent-shaped C-pillars and aggressive squinty-headlight design. It’s certainly different than competing coupes like the BMW 4 Series, Cadillac ATS and Mercedes-Benz C-Class. Nineteen-inch wheels are standard, with first-ever 20-inch wheels offered as an option. Sport trim models will have wider rear tires for handling and appearance benefits.\nInterior\nInside, the Q60 gets a new dashboard, door panels, console and seats. The controls have been reconfigured and relocated, accommodating a new dual-screen setup in the center console. Base models get an aluminum finish with optional black wood trim, while Sport and Premium models get carbon fiber trim with an optional glass fiber accent.\n\nThe InTuition multimedia system is standard, which includes an adjustment screen for just about every interior setting one can imagine. A new Bose 13-speaker stereo is standard and combines with a standard active noise cancellation system for what Infiniti says are exceptional levels of interior quietness and refinement.\nUnder the Hood\nPowering the Q60 are the same three powertrains that appear in the updated 2016 Q50 sedan. The base model will come with a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine and rear-wheel drive; it makes 208 horsepower and 258 pounds-feet of torque and is mated to a seven-speed automatic transmission. No manual transmission will be offered. Two optional powertrains are available, and both of them use twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 engines. One makes 300 hp and 295 pounds-feet of torque, while the top engine makes 400 hp and 350 pounds-feet of torque.\n\nTwo suspensions are offered: a conventional steel one on the base model or an optional electronic adjustable suspension on Sport and Premium models. The transmission also features various adjustable modes to tailor the vehicle’s performance to the driver’s tastes, ranging from eco minded to super sporty.\n\nThe steering features adjustable modes as well, allowing for both response and effort adjustments. The base four-cylinder model gets hydraulic rack-and-pinion steering, while the 300-hp V-6 model gets an updated version of the optional electronic steering system.\nSafety\nLike the Q50, the redesigned coupe offers a number of advanced safety features. As with most luxury cars, they’re almost entirely extra-cost options. Available on the new coupe are an around-view monitor, adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning with pedestrian detection, lane departure warning and assist, blind spot warning and backup collision intervention that can stop the vehicle if it detects an object behind the car.\n\nThe new Q60 will go on sale in late summer 2016.\nRead more here.",
