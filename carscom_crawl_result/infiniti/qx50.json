      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review for the 2016 Infiniti QX50 was written in January 2016, but little has changed for 2017. To see what’s new, click here, or to see a side-by-side comparison of the two model years, click here.\n\nThe Infiniti QX50 is a compact SUV built off the company’s entry-level rear-wheel-drive sedan, the Q50. It started life as the old EX35, then became the EX37 as its engine grew. Eventually, it ended up as the QX50 in Infiniti’s new nomenclature, in which every SUV is a “QX” followed by a number not related to its engine size.\n\nThe QX50 never sold in great numbers in the U.S., thanks in part to its very cramped backseat, but that’s been changed for 2016 with a longer wheelbase from a version primarily intended for the Chinese market. The rest of the SUV received only some minor changes; a slightly different front and rear treatment is the most notable alteration. Compare the 2015 and 2016 models here.\n\nWith these adjustments, is the Infiniti QX50 sufficiently new to keep it in the luxury SUV game — and can its better interior space draw in new buyers?\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nThe QX50 is not your traditional crossover layout. It’s based on Nissan’s FM rear-wheel-drive platform instead of a front-drive sedan setup, so its proportions look more wagon-like than truck-like.\n\nThe 2016 QX50 looks familiar. It hasn’t changed all that much since its introduction, so it doesn’t look much like the current face of Infiniti. Despite the added length for 2016, it doesn’t look longer than the old one unless you park them side by side. The extra length helps the wagon’s proportions, making it look perhaps a little more substantial than the outgoing model. Sleek headlights stretch back to a shapely body that ends in LED taillights — pretty much the norm for the segment.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nPowering the QX50 is an updated version of Nissan’s venerable VQ engine, a 3.7-liter V-6 without any turbos or even direct injection. It still manages to produce a more-than-healthy 325 horsepower. That’s more than enough to get the midsize crossover moving at a rapid pace, without any lag that might accompany a turbocharged engine. It’s not hairy or temperamental, just smooth, sonorous power.\n\nThe engine is mated to a standard seven-speed automatic transmission, and rear-wheel drive is standard; all-wheel drive is optional. The QX50 is well-tuned for a good mix of athletic handling and a decently comfortable ride. It’s not quite as sharp as some German SUVs, like the BMW X3, but it’s not as ugly as the Lexus NX nor as soft as other Japanese models, like the larger Lexus RX or Acura MDX.\n\nOverall, the QX50 feels balanced and enjoyable: It doesn’t embarrass itself on twisty roads, and it won’t beat you up on broken pavement, thanks to a well-damped ride.\n\nThere’s only one engine available for the QX50, and it unfortunately requires premium fuel, which is the norm among luxury models. Fuel economy is only adequate, and it’s the same regardless of whether you choose rear- or all-wheel drive: It’s EPA-rated 17/24/20 mpg city/highway/combined. My week of driving a few hundred miles in the QX50 averaged the rated 20 mpg.\n\nCompetitors generally perform better: The BMW X3 is rated 21/28/24 mpg with its turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder option and 19/27/22 mpg with the big twin-turbo inline-six-cylinder version. The torquey diesel version is rated an exceptional 27/34/30 mpg. The Audi Q5 rings in at 20/28/23 mpg with its standard turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder, dropping to 18/26/21 mpg for the supercharged 3.0-liter V-6. Like the Bimmer, it has high-mileage options, too, including a 24/31/27 mpg diesel and a 24/30/26 mpg hybrid.\n\nInterior\n\nWhile the exterior received some minor styling tweaks for 2016, the interior doesn’t seem to have changed since the car’s introduction. This is Infiniti’s old-look interior, and while it’s still pleasant and well-made, it’s definitely dated. The materials are nice, with leather and wood that looks and smells rich. The switches, multimedia system and gauges, however, look old-school.\n\nBut they’re not as unusual as the seating position. The more experience one has with the QX50, the more one realizes it feels more like a modified sedan than a purpose-built crossover. You sit high in the car on a seat that feels like it’s out of an SUV, but the steering wheel and controls are low, creating the sensation of driving a bus. It feels like you’re sitting on the QX50, not down in it. Visibility is good thanks to that high position, but it makes seeing stoplights a bit of a challenge, as they’re obscured by the roofline.\n\nThe rest of the car feels like it’s merely a wagon, so the odd positioning takes some getting used to. But there’s plenty of room up front, and now there’s adequate room in back, as well, thanks to that extra few inches of length for 2016. It’s not overly spacious, but it’s not uncomfortable anymore, and the tall roof ensures headroom is acceptable, as well.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the QX50 uses the old Nissan/Infiniti-style multimedia system. It works well enough, but it’s definitely not the most advanced system on the market. It has voice commands and supports traffic updates, but the reliability of the voice recognition system needs some work. The upgraded Bose premium audio system is impressive, however, with strong, clear sound.\n\nCargo & Storage\n\nBeing little more than a taller version of the Q50 sedan, the QX50 SUV’s storage space isn’t huge. You get only 18.6 cubic feet — one of the smallest cargo areas in the segment. It’s expandable to 50.1 cubic feet with the rear seats folded, but that still falls well short of competitors. The BMW X3, another sedan-based SUV, has 27.6 cubic feet of cargo room, expandable to 63.3 cubic feet, while the Audi Q5 brings 29.1 cubic feet to the party, expandable to 57.3 cubic feet. The newly redesigned Mercedes-Benz GLC-Class is more similar to the QX50, with 20.5 cubic feet, expandable to 56.5 cubic feet.\n\nSafety\n\nThe 2016 QX50 does not yet have an overall rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, but it’s been given a four-star rollover rating (out of five stars), which is common in this class. The 2015 model earned good ratings (out of a possible good, acceptable, marginal or poor) from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety in all but the small-overlap front test, to which it hasn’t yet been subjected. In the tested categories, it’s on par with competitors in this strong class. As of publication, 2016 results aren’t available, but when they are they’ll appear here.\n\nWith the 2016 update, the QX50 offers all the safety systems one would expect in a luxury SUV. Adaptive cruise control with autonomous braking, lane departure warning, lane keep assist and forward collision alert are all newly available, but you’ll likely find yourself shutting them off. The lane keep assist is ridiculously aggressive, and it serves more to annoy you with its beeps and intrusive steering corrections than to keep you safe. See all the QX50’s standard and optional safety systems here.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nThe QX50’s update may not be much more than skin deep, but it’s still a compelling compact luxury SUV. It drives well, looks good and has plenty of content — and it’s a decent value, too, starting at just $35,445 for a rear-wheel-drive model. That price brings you the most powerful standard engine in the class, heated front and rear seats, real leather upholstery and a power moonroof. Step up to the all-wheel-drive model for just $1,400 more. Load up your QX50 with all the technology and luxury packages offered, and you still won’t top $45,000. That’s a heck of a deal for a car this capable and well-equipped.\n\nQX50 competitors tend to cost a lot more and not give you nearly as much standard equipment. The BMW X3 starts at $39,945 with rear-wheel drive, but you don’t get nearly as much stuff at that price. The standard engine has much less power, and you’ll have to pay for almost every extra, right down to another $550 for any paint color other than black or white and $200 for Bluetooth smartphone integration. To option up an X3 with the equipment that comes standard on the QX50 has it topping $46,000 right off the bat.\n\nIt’s the same situation over at Mercedes-Benz, where the GLC300 starts at $39,875 but like the BMW comes with a much less powerful turbocharged engine. Mercedes charges you $720-$3,950 for paint colors other than black or white and features imitation leather as its standard upholstery. It charges extra for almost everything. Optioning up a GLC300 to the same level of equipment as a standard QX50 would cost you a minimum of $44,295, as doing so requires adding several option packages.\n\nThe Audi Q5 is a little better in that regard; even though it starts at $41,825, it includes Quattro all-wheel drive. Like the other Germans, it has less power than the QX50, but it does come with standard real leather interior, satellite radio, a 10-speaker audio system and bi-xenon headlights.

      "expert_review": "The Verdict: The 2016 Infiniti QX50 offers great value in a luxury SUV, with pleasant driving dynamics to boot, but buyers looking for the latest styles will want to shop other stores.\n\nVersus the Competition: It’s not as big inside as its competitors, but it offers one of the most powerful engines in its class as standard equipment. It doesn’t nickel-and-dime you for the most basic options, and it feels luxurious inside. The extra length added for 2016 makes the backseat tolerable, but cargo capacity and fuel economy still come up short.\n\nThe Infiniti QX50 is a compact SUV built off the company’s entry-level rear-wheel-drive sedan, the Q50. It started life as the old EX35, then became the EX37 as its engine grew. Eventually, it ended up as the QX50 in Infiniti’s new nomenclature, in which every SUV is a “QX” followed by a number not related to its engine size.\n\nThe QX50 never sold in great numbers in the U.S., thanks in part to its very cramped backseat, but that’s been changed for 2016 with a longer wheelbase from a version primarily intended for the Chinese market.

The torquey diesel version is rated an exceptional 27/34/30 mpg. The Audi Q5 rings in at 20/28/23 mpg with its standard turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder, dropping to 18/26/21 mpg for the supercharged 3.0-liter V-6. Like the Bimmer, it has high-mileage options, too, including a 24/31/27 mpg diesel and a 24/30/26 mpg hybrid.\n\nInterior\nWhile the exterior received some minor styling tweaks for 2016, the interior doesn’t seem to have changed since the car’s introduction. This is Infiniti’s old-look interior, and while it’s still pleasant and well-made, it’s definitely dated. The materials are nice, with leather and wood that looks and smells rich. The switches, multimedia system and gauges, however, look old-school.\n\nBut they’re not as unusual as the seating position. The more experience one has with the QX50, the more one realizes it feels more like a modified sedan than a purpose-built crossover. You sit high in the car on a seat that feels like it’s out of an SUV, but the steering wheel and controls are low, creating the sensation of driving a bus. It feels like you’re sitting on the QX50, not down in it. Visibility is good thanks to that high position, but it makes seeing stoplights a bit of a challenge, as they’re obscured by the roofline.\n\nThe rest of the car feels like it’s merely a wagon, so the odd positioning takes some getting used to. But there’s plenty of room up front, and now there’s adequate room in back, as well, thanks to that extra few inches of length for 2016. It’s not overly spacious, but it’s not uncomfortable anymore, and the tall roof ensures headroom is acceptable, as well.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nAs mentioned earlier, the QX50 uses the old Nissan/Infiniti-style multimedia system. It works well enough, but it’s definitely not the most advanced system on the market. It has voice commands and supports traffic updates, but the reliability of the voice recognition system needs some work. The upgraded Bose premium audio system is impressive, however, with strong, clear sound.\n\nCargo & Storage\nBeing little more than a taller version of the Q50 sedan, the QX50 SUV’s storage space isn’t huge. You get only 18.6 cubic feet — one of the smallest cargo areas in the segment. It’s expandable to 50.1 cubic feet with the rear seats folded, but that still falls well short of competitors. The BMW X3, another sedan-based SUV, has 27.6 cubic feet of cargo room, expandable to 63.3 cubic feet, while the Audi Q5 brings 29.1 cubic feet to the party, expandable to 57.3 cubic feet. The newly redesigned Mercedes-Benz GLC-Class is more similar to the QX50, with 20.5 cubic feet, expandable to 56.5 cubic feet.\n\nSafety\nThe 2016 QX50 does not yet have an overall rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, but it’s been given a four-star rollover rating (out of five stars), which is common in this class. The 2015 model earned good ratings (out of a possible good, acceptable, marginal or poor) from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety in all but the small-overlap front test, to which it hasn’t yet been subjected. In the tested categories, it’s on par with competitors in this strong class. As of publication, 2016 results aren’t available, but when they are they’ll appear here.\n\nWith the 2016 update, the QX50 offers all the safety systems one would expect in a luxury SUV. Adaptive cruise control with autonomous braking, lane departure warning, lane keep assist and forward collision alert are all newly available, but you’ll likely find yourself shutting them off. The lane keep assist is ridiculously aggressive, and it serves more to annoy you with its beeps and intrusive steering corrections than to keep you safe. See all the QX50’s standard and optional safety systems here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe QX50’s update may not be much more than skin deep, but it’s still a compelling compact luxury SUV. It drives well, looks good and has plenty of content — and it’s a decent value, too, starting at just $35,445 for a rear-wheel-drive model. That price brings you the most powerful standard engine in the class, heated front and rear seats, real leather upholstery and a power moonroof. Step up to the all-wheel-drive model for just $1,400 more. Load up your QX50 with all the technology and luxury packages offered, and you still won’t top $45,000. That’s a heck of a deal for a car this capable and well-equipped.\n\nQX50 competitors tend to cost a lot more and not give you nearly as much standard equipment. The BMW X3 starts at $39,945 with rear-wheel drive, but you don’t get nearly as much stuff at that price. The standard engine has much less power, and you’ll have to pay for almost every extra, right down to another $550 for any paint color other than black or white and $200 for Bluetooth smartphone integration. To option up an X3 with the equipment that comes standard on the QX50 has it topping $46,000 right off the bat.\n\nIt’s the same situation over at Mercedes-Benz, where the GLC300 starts at $39,875 but like the BMW comes with a much less powerful turbocharged engine. Mercedes charges you $720-$3,950 for paint colors other than black or white and features imitation leather as its standard upholstery. It charges extra for almost everything. Optioning up a GLC300 to the same level of equipment as a standard QX50 would cost you a minimum of $44,295, as doing so requires adding several option packages.\n\nThe Audi Q5 is a little better in that regard; even though it starts at $41,825, it includes Quattro all-wheel drive. Like the other Germans, it has less power than the QX50, but it does come with standard real leather interior, satellite radio, a 10-speaker audio system and bi-xenon headlights. Compare all four competitors here.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Infiniti QX50?\n\nThe Infiniti QX50 competes in the compact luxury SUV class. Now offered solely with all-wheel drive, the five-seat QX50 is powered by a 268-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that pairs with a continuously variable automatic transmission. Competitors include the Acura RDX, BMW X3 and Audi Q5. You can see how the QX50 scored in our Car Seat Check here.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Infiniti QX50? \n\nThe QX50 is no longer available with front-wheel drive; AWD is now standard on all trims. Additionally, the high-end Sensory and Autograph trims have been discontinued.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Infiniti QX50 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\nLED headlights\nPower liftgate\nSimulated leather upholstery\n60/40-split, reclining backseat\nWireless Apple CarPlay \nAndroid Auto \nSatellite radio\nWi-Fi hot spot\nWireless charging pad\nForward collision warning \nAutomatic emergency braking\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nLane departure warning\nAdaptive cruise control\nRear automatic braking\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nPanoramic moonroof\nHeated steering wheel\nLeather-trimmed seats \nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated rear seats\nNavigation\nBose premium stereo\n360-degree camera system\nHead-up display\nHands-free power liftgate\nSemi-aniline leather upholstery\nLED foglights\n20-inch wheels\nShould I Buy the 2025 Infiniti QX50?\n\nThe QX50 is stylish and spacious, but the engine can get noisy, and we noticed some drivetrain lag. The QX50’s dual-screen multimedia system also has more of a learning curve than the single-screen systems found in most competitors. The current-generation QX50 was introduced for the 2019 model year, and it’s showing its age against newer-design rivals.",

      "expert_review": "CARS.COM — It’s hard to get too excited about the redesigned Infiniti QX50, a smallish luxury SUV with promising technology and a lush interior but notable warts past that. Put it all together, and Infiniti’s latest redesign is a middling choice in a crowded vehicle class, especially if your budget precludes all the bells and whistles.\n\nRelated: Infiniti QX50 Returns for 2019 With True Luxury Cred\n\nAfter skipping the 2018 model year, the Infiniti QX50 returns in redesigned form for 2019. I spent a day and a half driving an all-wheel-drive QX50 Essential at Infiniti’s Los Angeles-area media preview. (Per company policy, Cars.com pays for its airfare and lodging at such automaker-hosted events.) Officials said the SUV should hit dealerships in late February or early March, and it will come in three trim levels (Pure, Luxe and Essential) that range from about $37,500 to nearly $60,000 with all major options. The spread is a bit pricier than the outgoing QX50 but still a slight value against a four-cylinder Audi Q5, BMW X3 or Mercedes-Benz GLC-Class — just a few of the QX50’s many rivals.\n\nDoozy of a Drivetrain\n\nOut goes the old QX50’s big V-6, replaced by a turbocharged four-cylinder engine (268 horsepower, 280 pounds-feet of torque) with a high-tech variable compression ratio that drives the front or all four wheels through a continuously variable automatic transmission. As such, the Infiniti QX50 charges up steep inclines and makes quick work of freeway onramps, and its much-improved fuel economy — 27 mpg combined with front-wheel drive or 26 mpg with all-wheel drive (AWD), Infiniti says — edges out the competition.\n\nAlas, none of that power comes smoothly or particularly soon.\n\nThe culprit is hard to pinpoint — the CVT, accelerator tuning or just some old-school turbo lag — but the result is clear: The QX50 takes too long to get going. The gas pedal delivers feeble power up front, then abrupt bursts of grunt when the cavalry arrives. Step on it for an uphill start, and the power swell can spin the front wheels for moments on end before the AWD finally transfers power to the rear. Swell this is not.\n\nPast those beginnings, things improve. The transmission responds more readily to your right foot, and it cuts engine revs to simulate upshifts during moderate acceleration — a contrast with most CVTs, which limit the faux upshifts to full throttle near redline. Sport mode even kicks up revs on downhill grades to simulate downshifts, rev-matching and all. It’s lively; I only wish the responsiveness came sooner.\n\nThe chassis stays reasonably planted over rapid elevation changes, but ride quality with the QX50’s standard 19-inch wheels is a touch busy on anything but glass-smooth pavement. It’s seldom harsh or bouncy, but it also lacks the sophistication that rivals like the X3 nail. (Twenty-inch wheels and lower-profile tires are optional on the Infiniti QX50, but I didn’t drive models thus equipped.) Infiniti says suspension tuning is the same across all trim levels. Adaptive shock absorbers, a common option among competitors, aren’t offered.\n\nMore Tech\n\nOur test car had the QX50’s optional Direct Adaptive Steering, the latest generation of Infiniti’s steer-by-wire system that we’ve criticized in earlier iterations. Feedback is numb on twisting mountain roads even in Sport mode, and it’s utterly absent at low speeds, where DAS dials up so much power assist that parking-lot maneuvers feel like a video game. The system degrades otherwise acceptable handling. Enthusiasts will cry foul, but I suspect many SUV shoppers will love DAS. Don’t fret the three-point turn: In a steer-by-wire Infiniti QX50, you can do it with one finger.\n\nYou can drive with just a few fingers if you get the QX50’s optional ProPilot Assist system. Also offered in the Leaf and Rogue from parent company Nissan, ProPilot Assist is packaged with the DAS option in the Infiniti QX50. It includes adaptive cruise control and lane-centering steering, both of which work all the way to a stop. Intended for highways with proper lane markings, ProPilot Assist kept natural position for the most part on L.A.’s Highway 101, tracking mild curves and merging traffic like a human driver might.\n\nIt isn’t a hands-free system like Cadillac’s Super Cruise, and it warns you in short order if it senses you’ve let go of the steering wheel. It requires a forceful hand: My test car sometimes flashed warnings when I gave insufficient resistance even with my hands on the rim.\n\nA Thing of Beauty\n\nA stone’s throw from the QX50 Concept and QX Sport Inspiration Concept that preceded it, the production Infiniti QX50 follows in the design language seen on the Q50 and Q60, both handsome cars. Sweeping contours on the QX50 keep a few bumper openings — a pair for reflectors in back, another for air intakes up front — from looking busy. Speaking of which, all the major bumper openings on our test car were functional, not faux. Nice.\n\nInfiniti wraps much of the QX50’s dashboard, upper doors and center console in a mix of stitched vinyl and real leather. I couldn’t tell the difference: It’s convincing stuff, with raised seams and rich textures where your arms and elbows rest. Cheaper plastics hang below eye level, which we’ve come to expect in this class, but Infiniti hides them well enough.\n\nBoth rows have adult-friendly room, with reclining and sliding adjustments for the second row. Pure and Luxe trims have vinyl upholstery; Essential versions get leather. Pile up the options beyond that, and you can get quilted semi-aniline leather seats with suedelike accents on the upper doors, dash and console. As such, the cabin is mighty handsome.\n\nWhat the Functionality\n\nLess handsome are the dashboard’s twin touchscreens, which emulate those in the Q50 and Q60. The displays (8 inches for the upper unit, 7 inches for the lower) have straightforward menus and pinch-and-swipe capability, but the skyward angle of the upper unit means it’s often washed out by sunlight, and the lack of a tuning knob makes channel surfing a chore. What’s more, the two-screen setup makes sense only if you leave a navigation map up top, yet two of the QX50’s three trim levels lack navigation. It would come in handy for a navigation map from Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, but the Infiniti QX50 offers neither.\n\nOfficials said wireless versions of both smartphone integrations would come in future model years, as will wireless phone charging — but that will require new hardware, so don’t expect an update for existing owners. In the here and now, the 2019 QX50 is a multimedia Luddite.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nWe’ll save a deeper dive on styling, value, safety and practicality for a full review when we get a QX50 back to Cars.com HQ, but the initial takeaway is mixed. Some aspects of Infiniti’s latest SUV hold promise, but it has too many shortcomings to stand out against more than half a dozen major competitors. Smallish SUVs are fast becoming luxury brands’ bread and butter, and the QX50 might see considerable attention on that trend alone. Whether it’s enough to lift the tide at a bit player like Infiniti remains to be seen.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Infiniti is making minor updates to the QX50 compact SUV for 2023, adding a new Sport trim and access to the brand’s Premium Care maintenance plan. That’ll cost you, though, as the 2023 QX50’s base price climbs some $1,320 over the outgoing model year.\n\nRelated: 2021 Infiniti QX50 Review: Pretty, Flawed\n\nThe 2023 QX50 carries over as far as exterior styling is concerned, but the luxury brand has made enhancements elsewhere to try and keep the QX50 fresh in the eyes of buyers. That includes remote start, a wireless charging pad, rear door alert, heated exterior mirrors and an auto-dimming rearview mirror as newly standard.\n\nIn addition, the QX50 also gets a new Sport trim that slots between the Luxe and Sensory. As the name implies, the Sport is about adding extra attitude to the SUV; it features a slightly revised exterior with black accents, leather seats, a 12-speaker Bose premium audio system and 20-inch aluminum-alloy wheels.\n\nThe QX50 also now comes with Infiniti’s Premium Care package. This three-year maintenance plan covers inspections, tire repair or replacement, and scheduled maintenance including oil changes and tire rotations.\n\nPerformance still comes from a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that makes 268 horsepower and 280 pounds-feet of torque and is paired with a continuously variable automatic transmission. Front-wheel drive is standard on all but the Autograph trim, which only comes with all-wheel drive. The 2023 QX50 gets an EPA-rated 23/29/26 mpg city/highway/combined with FWD; AWD models achieve 22/28/25 mpg.\n\nPricing and Release Date\n\nThe 2023 Infiniti QX50 is available now. Full pricing is below, and buyers looking to add AWD to trims other than the Autograph will have to pony up an extra $2,000:\n\nPure: $41,495\nLuxe: $44,795\nSport: $49,695\nSensory: $53,995\nAutograph: $58,545\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nWhich Cars Have Panoramic Moonroofs or Sunroofs?\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2021 Infiniti QX50?\n2023 Infiniti QX55 Adds New Safety Technology and Amenities, Starts at $50,345\n2023 Infiniti QX60: Premium Care, Premium Price\nResearch the Infiniti QX50\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Seeing as the average transaction price of a new car is bobbing and weaving around the $45,000 mark, $42,045 (all prices include destination) for a five-occupant luxury SUV sounds weirdly reasonable, but that’s what Infiniti is asking for its base 2024 QX50. Entering its golden years half a decade after its last major redesign — and in the industrywide transition to electrification — the QX50 remains unchanged for the 2024 model year.\n\nRelated: 2021 Infiniti QX50 Review: Pretty, Flawed\n\nPowertrain Specs and MPG\n\nThe QX50 is powered by Infiniti’s turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine. We’ll save the deeply nerdy engineering talk, but this engine, which has a variable compression ratio, is so unique and complex that no other automaker builds one like it. The purpose is to better balance power and efficiency, but the degree to which it fulfills that purpose is debatable.\n\nThe engine’s 268 horsepower and 280 pounds-feet of torque top some competitors, but not all, and not by the sort of gobsmacking margin you might hope for from a technological marvel. Ditto the fuel economy: Paired with a continuously variable automatic transmission, the 2.0-liter is good for an EPA-rated 23/29/26 mpg city/highway/combined in front-wheel-drive QX50s and 22/28/25 mpg with all-wheel drive.\n\nSafety Equipment\n\nA comprehensive suite of advanced safety features is standard on the 2024 QX50, including ProPilot Assist, which bundles adaptive cruise control with lane-centering steering. The roster also features blind spot monitoring, lane departure warning, rear automatic braking, automatic high beams, and forward collision warning with pedestrian detection and automatic emergency braking. Higher trim levels add a 360-degree camera system, traffic sign recognition, a head-up display and adaptive headlights that turn with the steering wheel.\n\nPricing and Trim Levels\n\nThe 2024 Infiniti QX50 is available now. All trim levels except the Autograph come with standard FWD, with AWD a $2,000 option on most of the lineup but standard on the Autograph. Full line pricing is as follows:\n\nPure: $42,045\nLuxe: $45,345\nSport: $50,245\nSensory: $54,545\nAutograph: $59,095\n\nIn addition to its lengthy list of safety equipment, standard features on the Pure include 19-inch wheels, keyless entry and starting, a power rear liftgate, synthetic leather, power front seats, dual-zone climate control, a dual-touchscreen infotainment system with an 8-inch upper screen and a 7-inch lower display, Android Auto, and wireless Apple CarPlay and phone charging.\n\nMoving up to the Luxe adds a panoramic moonroof, real leather, heated front seats and a hands-free rear hatch with a kick sensor.\n\nThe Sport variant gets a trendy blacked-out treatment, with a black grille and exterior trim, a unique front end and darkened 20-inch wheels. Inside, it has navigation, ventilated front seats, a heated steering wheel, upgraded leather, ambient lighting and a 12-speaker Bose sound system. This trim level also adds the 360-degree camera system and traffic sign recognition.\n\nThe Sensory trim nets synthetic suede and maple wood trim, adaptive headlights, rain-sensing windshield wipers, a power tilt/telescoping steering column, heated second-row seats, a head-up display and 16 speakers for the Bose audio system.\n\nAt the top of the line sits the Autograph. In addition to standard AWD, it gets synthetic suede on more interior surfaces, quilted leather seats, tri-zone climate control and a 3,000-pound towing capacity.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2023 Infiniti QX50 Adds New Sport Trim, Premium Care Maintenance Plan\nWhich Cars Have Panoramic Moonroofs or Sunroofs?\n2021 Infiniti QX50: 5 Things We Like and 3 Not So Much\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2021 Infiniti QX50?\nResearch the Infiniti QX50\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Infiniti QX50?\n\nIntroduced last year, the Infiniti QX50 is a recent addition to the highly competitive compact luxury SUV class. Offered with front- or all-wheel drive, the five-seat QX50 is powered by a 268-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that works with a continuously variable automatic transmission. Competitors include the Acura RDX, Audi Q5 and Volvo XC60.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Infiniti QX50?\n\nA new generation of the dual-screen InTouch multimedia system includes HD displays and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity. Infiniti has also bolstered the QX50’s lineup of standard safety content with the addition of blind spot warning, rear cross-traffic alert, lane departure warning, high-beam assist and rear automatic braking. Two new high-end trim levels – Sensory and Autograph – are also available.\n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Infiniti QX50 Are Most Important?\n\nDespite its modest overall dimensions, the QX50 offers a surprising amount of interior space. This is also true for the cargo area, which measures 31.4 cubic feet. A turbo four-cylinder is the only engine available, but it’s powerful and relatively efficient. Other standard active safety features include forward collision warning and automatic emergency braking.\n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Infiniti QX50?\n\nThe QX50 should certainly be on your shopping list if you’re considering a smaller luxury SUV that’s good on gas and comes with plenty of tech touches. Its handling isn’t the best, but it managed a respectable third-place finish in our luxury compact SUV comparison test.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2021 Infiniti QX50 is gorgeous, with evocative exterior styling and a dazzling cabin, but it’s not enough to distract from an unrefined powertrain and clunky multimedia system.  \n\nVersus the competition: Although the QX50 stands above the pack in cabin refinement, competitors offer more polished road manners and more modern controls. \n\nThe QX50 was redesigned for 2019. Infiniti added Apple CarPlay and Android Auto for 2020, and a few more convenience and safety features — such as Wi-Fi hot-spot capability and additional airbags — were made standard for 2021. The QX50 competes against the likes of the Acura RDX, Audi Q5 and Volvo XC60; see them compared. The QX55, a related SUV with swoopier styling, is coming for 2022.\n\nRelated: Updated 2021 Infiniti QX50 Makes Safety, Convenience Features More Accessible\n\nDazzling Cabin, Tired Controls\n\nThe QX50’s ooh-and-ahh-worthy cabin is its most becoming feature, and it’s the only part of the SUV that sold me on its luxury pedigree. I tested the top trim, called the Autograph, and was impressed by its well-done interior — from supple quilted leather seats with contrast piping to a classy dash and doors covered in high-quality materials. The convincing faux suede headliner and cabin trim, as well as silver-accented maple wood panels, combine for a rich, premium look and feel. \n\nAlas, this vibe is short-lived, and the disjointed controls are to blame. The QX50 uses the latest version of Infiniti’s dual-screen InTouch multimedia system — quite a departure from the Audi Q5 and Volvo XC60’s slick, large single-screen setups. Yes, InTouch does at least include Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, but that’s the only modern thing about it. \n\nThe system comprises two displays: 8 inches for the upper unit, 7 inches for the lower. The menu structure is straightforward for the most part, but the setup is just odd. The top screen in the QX50 I drove was home to just the navigation and backup camera display, and it could function as a touchscreen or via a rotary dial near the center console. This screen looked to be lower resolution than the bottom screen, and its graphics looked retro (and not in a cool way). It was also fairly unresponsive; some inputs required multiple touches to register.\n\nScoot down an inch, though, and you’ll find what seems to be a totally different system. The bottom touchscreen has sharper graphics and a more modern design, and it’s quicker to respond. The physical climate buttons to either side of it are straightforward, and I enjoyed the handy placement of the large, central volume knob under the screen. Put them together and the two-screen system isn’t terrible, just strange. Competitors are better integrated. \n\nThe cabin stands out in other ways, too — many of them positive. Both the backseat and the cargo area are generous, with adult-friendly space in both rows and reclining and sliding adjustments for the backseat. I installed two child-safety seats with ease, thanks to exposed lower Latch anchors and ample backseat legroom. Check out our full Car Seat Check on the 2021 Infiniti QX50.\n\nBehind the seats is a deep cargo area with a wide opening, offering a surprising amount of space for a vehicle with such tidy dimensions. Infiniti says the QX50 has 31.4 cubic feet of room; that’s a good deal more than Audi reports for the Q5 or Volvo for the XC60, and just a bit more than Acura reports for the RDX. \n\nA Powertrain in Need of Polish\n\nThe biggest blow to the QX50’s premium vibe came from under the hood. The SUV is slow and cranky — not a good look for something that claims both sportiness and luxury. The Infiniti’s 268-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine works with a continuously variable automatic transmission, and the pair feels and sounds stressed. It’s especially bad from a stop, when power is sluggish, and it gets loud even under light acceleration. \n\nI blame the CVT; Infiniti says its artificial “shifts” are meant to emulate traditional gear changes to make for a more regular, stepped feel, but instead they’re rough and oddly timed, making for uneven acceleration. Things settle down on the highway, where there’s decent mid-range punch and more natural power delivery. \n\nWhat the CVT is good for, however, is fuel economy. The QX50 gets decent mileage, but so do its competitors: With all-wheel drive, the 2021 QX50 gets an EPA-estimated 22/28/25 mpg city/highway/combined. Front-drive models are rated a smidge higher, at 26 mpg combined. The AWD-only Q5 is rated 23/28/25 mpg, and all-wheel-drive versions of the RDX (21/27/23 mpg) and XC40 (22/30/25 mpg) are also close. The XC60 and Q5 also have more fuel-efficient hybrid versions available. \n\nThe QX50’s ride quality dips back into premium territory. It’s comfortable and composed, with good bump absorption and overall isolation. The cabin is also fairly well hushed from road and wind noise. \n\nIt handles decently, too. Although it’s not as precise as it could be — the Q5 feels more crisp — body roll is well checked and maneuverability is great thanks to a tight turning circle. Steering feel is mixed, however, likely due to Infiniti’s steer-by-wire setup, which it calls Direct Adaptive Steering. It reduces steering effort at low speeds, which is nice, but there’s not a lot of feedback at higher speeds and steering response is mushy. \n\nSafety and Value\n\nThe 2021 Infiniti QX50 starts at $38,975 in its base front-wheel-drive Pure trim; AWD adds another $2,000. Rivals start higher: The Q5 is $44,395 with standard AWD, the RDX  starts at $39,225 with front-wheel drive or $41,225 with AWD, and the XC60 is $42,695 with front drive or $44,995 with AWD (all prices include destination). My test car, an Autograph AWD, cost $61,765 with premium extras like upgraded leather, welcome lighting and special paint. That’s a hefty sum for a vehicle that’s hot and cold when it comes to delivering a luxury experience.   \n\nThe QX50 at least delivers on safety and driver-assistance features. Forward collision warning and automatic emergency braking are standard, as are blind spot warning, rear cross-traffic alert, lane departure warning, high-beam assist and rear automatic braking. Also standard for 2021 are two new safety features: rear-seat mounted side-impact supplemental airbags and automatic collision notification with an emergency call system. \n\nAlso impressive is an available ProPilot Assist driver-assistance system. The semi-autonomous system works with adaptive cruise control and lane-centering steering to control the car both at highway speeds and all the way down to a stop.  It’s easy to engage via a steering-wheel button and is a nice driving aid, but it isn’t a hands-free system, as several brands will soon offer.\n\nUltimately, the 2021 QX50 dazzles on a superficial level thanks to a posh interior and elegant exterior, but it’s just not enough; there needs to be some substance under that style for it to live up to its price.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
