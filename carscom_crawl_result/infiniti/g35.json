      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nWhile the G coupe has been reinvented for 2008 as the G37, the sedan remains the G35, having been redesigned for 2007. The G35 comes in base, Journey, G35x all-wheel drive and Sport trim levels. Changes for 2008 are relatively minor and include an Apple iPod connection, standard XM Satellite Radio (excluding service) and content changes in the Technology and Navigation package options. Later in the model year, new Sport and 18-inch Tire and Wheel packages will be added as options.\n\nExterior\nThe best-selling Infiniti model resembles the successful M35/45 midsize sedan, with shapes that are more angular, less organic. A character line runs from the front wheel arch and along the door handles and drapes over the rear wheel arch. The Sport trim level is distinguished by a different front face and side sills. A trunklid spoiler is optional.\n\nThe G35 comes with 17-inch aluminum-alloy wheels. The Sport trim level steps up to 18-inch rims. Dual exhaust is standard.\n\nInterior\nThe G35 now boasts an improved design and higher-quality materials than the original generation, but it’s still not quite as rich as the M35’s interior. Infiniti wisely gave up on the fake stuff and went with real, textured-aluminum trim. The power front-seat controls are in the conventional location on the seat cushion close to the door, replacing the inboard, upward-facing toggle switches that attracted dust and debris. The G does away with the old ignition and uses an Intelligent Key transmitter fob and dashboard-mounted start button. Automatic swiveling headlights are optional, as is adaptive cruise control.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe 3.5-liter V-6 engine cranks out roughly 300 horsepower in all models, revving as high as 7,500 rpm. Transmission choices include a six-speed manual and a five-speed automatic with a manual mode and magnesium steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters.\n\nThe Sport trim level brings a firmer suspension than the other versions. Intended to be the sportiest version, the G35 Sport with the optional Four-Wheel Active Steer feature has the firmest suspension, according to Infiniti. 4WAS steers the rear wheels in the opposite direction of the front pair at moderate speeds for maneuverability and in the same direction at highway speeds for quick, stable lane-changing.\n\nSafety\nThe G35 scores Good, the highest rating, in Insurance Institute for Highway Safety frontal crash tests. It hasn’t yet been tested for side impact.\n\nSafety features include dual-stage front airbags, side-impact airbags for both front seats, and side curtain airbags that cover the front and rear side windows in a side impact. The front seats feature active head restraints.\n\nStandard features that help avoid collisions include antilock brakes with electronic brake-force distribution and brake assist, an electronic stability system and a tire pressure monitoring system. A Rearview Monitor shows what’s behind the vehicle on the dashboard’s optional navigation screen when the automatic transmission is in Reverse.\n\nDriving Impressions\nIts handling is the aspect of the G35 that put it in league with the BMW 3 Series, the company for which handling is a claim to fame. The G35 followed the 3 Series formula: rear-wheel drive, balanced weight distribution, excellent road-holding and solid six-cylinder power.\n\nThe Sport has the best road-holding because of its firmer springs and standard summer performance tires. Anyone who intends to drive in freezing temperatures, not just snow or ice, will have to forego the summer tires or get an additional set of all-season or winter treads. Appropriately, the G35x comes only with all-season tires.\n\nThe all-wheel drive keeps the G35x more planted and secure in bad weather, but it also mutes the sporting nature of the rear-wheel-drive G35, in part because it’s heavier overall, with added weight in the front. Note that AWD characteristically increases the car’s turning diameter to 36.1 feet from 35.4 feet with rear-wheel drive.\n\nThe six-speed manual transmission, standard in the Sport trim level, has the right height and throw, and it feels more connected than that of the 3 Series. The clutch pedal, on the other hand, is grabby. With the automatic, downshifts employ rev matching that automatically gooses the engine speed before the gears mesh, providing exceptionally smooth downshifts and reduced wear.\n\nThe G35’s backseat doesn’t fold to extend the trunk forward, which is a disappointment.",

      "expert_review": "Here’s how tough it is to keep up in the automotive business these days: Five days after test driving a 2006 Infiniti G35 Sedan last month, Infiniti rolls out the 2007 version of the car at the New York International Auto Show.\n\nC’mon guys, one at a time!\n\nSo, with the understanding that a more powerful, more luxury-loaded G35 four-door model with an extensively redesigned interior could be available in November, here’s the lowdown on the ’06 model. (And who knows? Infiniti dealers might be willing to part with it for a little less money when the 2007 shows up.)\n\nThe current G35 Sedan is classy inside and out. It’s a genuine luxury passenger car. And not for $50,000 but for an entirely reasonable starting price of $31,950, including a $650 destination charge. That price on the tester included everything; not a single item was listed as optional.\n\nThe tested G35 was loaded up with standard electronic brake force distribution, brake assist, two vehicle-control systems, high intensity headlamps, power/heated exterior mirrors, dual chrome exhausts, leather seating surfaces, power-adjustable front seats, dual-stage front air bags, supplemental side-impact air bags, roof-mounted curtain air bags, rear seat air bags, power/vented disc brakes at all four corners and an in-dash audio system that can accommodate six compact discs and MP3 playback.\n\nWhew, that’s just the partial list. It’s all very nice, but the classy part is in the design and small details.\n\nFor starters, the G35 Sedan looks elegant, smooth and sporty from the outside.\n\nAnd not merely imitation sporty – like those automakers who screw a spoiler on a car’s back end and charge you an extra 500 bucks – but genuine sporty, with clean, aerodynamic lines and 17-inch alloy wheels.\n\nThe car’s interior is all about comfort and expensive-looking materials. Uplevel touches include an analog clock center-mounted in the dash and what Infiniti calls a “Fine Vision electro-fluorescent illumination system” across the instrument panel.\n\nI’ll buy that label, but to me, I felt like I was in the lounge of a five-star hotel, where a champagne cocktail costs almost as much as a sofa.\n\nThe sedan’s sporty looks are backed by a responsive, 3.5-liter V-6 with 280 horsepower and a maximum torque rating of 270 foot-pounds. Variable valve timing also is part of the power plant.\n\nThe six-cylinder engine produced brisk accelerations and gave me plenty to work with on freeway entrance ramps. The G35, with independent, multi-link suspension front and rear, was nimble in all conditions. Steering was sufficiently firm, but the car could easily be zipped around with one hand.\n\nOne thing that did surprise me, however, was the tester’s inability to gain traction on slick road surfaces, despite the presence of two aforementioned vehicle-control systems, including traction control. Those relentless spring rains were still pounding Northern California during my time in the G35 Sedan, and the back tires routinely spun without grip on even mild accelerations.\n\nPerhaps the all-wheel-drive version of the ’06 G35 Sedan is more of a wet weather performer. Infiniti touts it as such, but the starting price is nearly $2,000 higher than the rear-drive sedan.\n\nOne other gripe: The G35 Sedan is a five-passenger car, but those three seats in the back are a serious squeeze for three adults. And woe to that unfortunate person who has to sit in the middle, with one foot on either side of the center hump. That passenger is not going to be grateful for the underfoot shaft driving the car’s rear wheels.\n\nOtherwise, this is a tempting luxury sedan that stacks up very well in a pricey niche. And while the neighbors might be impressed with an Infiniti parked in your driveway, you can appreciate other, more practical aspects of the ride: As one might guess from the preponderance of air bags in the standard features list, the 2006 G35 Sedan has an exceptional safety package.\n\nNaturally, Infiniti is already talking up the 2007 G35 Sedan’s enhancements, including a 300-plus horsepower V-6, a rearview monitor and a blow-you-away Bose sound system. The new edition does sound sweet, but again, the still-desirable ’06 model might be had for a bargain in the months ahead.\n\nEither way, you’re likely to feel pretty good about the car you drive off the dealer lot.\n\nINFINITI G35 SEDAN AT A GLANCE\nMake/model: 2006 Infiniti G35 Sedan\nVehicle type: Five-passenger, four-door, rear-drive, luxury sport sedan\nBase price: $31,300 (as tested, $31,950)\nEngine: 3.5-liter V-6 with 280 horsepower at 6,200 revolutions per minute and 270 foot-pounds of torque at 4,800 rpm\nEPA fuel economy: 18 miles per gallon city; 25 mpg highway\nTransmission: Electronic five-speed automatic with clutchless manual-shifting and other features Steering: Power-assisted rack and pinion with speed-sensitive feature\nBrakes: Power-assisted, four-wheel, vented discs with anti-lock and other braking-enhancement features\nSuspension: Independent, multi-link on front and rear (stabilizer bars front and rear)\nFuel tank: 20 gallons\nInterior volume: 98 cubic feet\nTrunk volume: 14.8 cubic feet\nCurb weight: 3,449 pounds\nTrack: 59.1 inches on front; 59.3 inches on rear\nGround clearance: 5.5 inches\nHeight: 57.7 inches\nLength: 186.5 inches\nWheelbase: 112.2 inches\nWidth: 69 inches\nTowing capacity: 1,000 pounds\nTires: P215/55R17, V-rated, all-season radials\nFinal assembly point: Los Angeles",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nShortly after introducing the rear-wheel-drive G35 sedan as an early 2003 model, Nissan’s luxury division added a sumptuously shaped G35 Sport Coupe. Though the two body styles are related, they share no body panels. The Sport Coupe has a near 50/50 weight distribution, and Infiniti says its suspension tuning is slightly more aggressive than the sedan’s because it makes extensive use of aluminum to reduce unsprung weight.\n\nFor 2005, a 298-horsepower version of the original 3.5-liter V-6 goes into manual-shift versions of both the sedan and Sport Coupe. Automatic-transmission sedans get a 20-hp boost to 280 hp, matching the output of the automatic-equipped Sport Coupe. Sedans also have a redesigned exterior, a refined interior, and a new instrument panel and console. The sedan’s Sport-Tuned Suspension Package adds 18-inch tires and a viscous limited-slip differential. Coupes with this package ride on new 19-inch forged alloy wheels.\n\nFor 2004, Infiniti introduced an all-wheel-drive version of the G35 sedan called the G35x.\n(Skip to details on the: G35x)\n\nExterior\nThe G35 features short front and rear overhangs. The 2005 redesign includes a new hood, trunk, bumpers, body-colored side sills and dual-circle LED taillamps. The aerodynamically styled G35 Sport Coupe rides on the same 112.2-inch wheelbase as the sedan but is 4.3 inches shorter and 3 inches lower.\n\nInterior\nLeather upholstery is standard in the G35 sedan’s five-passenger interior, which features a tilting gauge cluster and an in-dash six-CD changer. The sedan’s available Premium Packages include dual-zone climate control, driver’s seat memory and a Bose audio system. The sedan’s trunk holds 14.8 cubic feet of cargo, and the coupe’s trunk volume is 7.8 cubic feet.\n\nUp to four occupants can fit inside the Sport Coupe, which features a sculpted fold-down rear seat. Options include a DVD-based navigation system, XM Satellite Radio and Sirius Satellite Radio.\n\nUnder the Hood\nIn G35s equipped with a five-speed-automatic transmission, the 3.5-liter V-6 develops 280 hp and 270 pounds-feet of torque. The five-speed automatic incorporates a manual-shift provision. When a six-speed-manual transmission is installed, engine output is 298 hp and 260 pounds-feet of torque.\n\nSafety\nDual-stage front airbags, front-seat side-impact airbags and side curtain-type airbags are standard. All-disc antilock brakes include brake assist and electronic brake-force distribution. Infiniti’s Vehicle Dynamic Control electronic stability system is standard.\n\nDriving Impressions\nThe G35 sport sedan takes curves beautifully. Body roll is minimal, and the engine’s power helps when heading through quick turns. With both the regular suspension and the tauter setup, the ride is surprisingly smooth on most surfaces. Because the base model is so stable and flat, differences with the sport suspension aren’t dramatic. Engine noise is definitely noticeable, but it’s not unpleasant.\n\nThe G35 Sport Coupe is sporty in both appearance and feel. It has plenty of power and operates with stunning precision and stability. Even though its suspension is taut, the ride is surprisingly smooth, but jolts inevitably occur on rougher surfaces. An automatic-transmission model is nearly as satisfying as one with the manual transmission. The driver’s seat is comfortably snug, but front headroom with the sunroof could be better.\n\nG35x\nThe all-wheel-drive system on the G35x is called ATTESA E-TS (Advanced Total Traction Engineering System for All Electronic Torque Split). The system automatically transfers optimum engine torque to the appropriate wheels according to road and driving conditions. Torque distribution can range from 100 percent to the rear wheels to an even split front to rear. A Snow-Mode switch is included. Equipped with a 280-hp, 3.5-liter V-6 and a five-speed-automatic transmission, the G35x also has 17-inch alloy wheels, a tire-pressure monitor and the Vehicle Dynamic Control stability system.

Another one sat with her scalp pressed to the glass. And a front-seat passenger just couldn’t find a way to get comfortable. One larger problem: None of them is taller than 5-foot-10.\n\nShoehorns should come standard. Grease should be an option.\n\nOne person can enjoy this car. Many won’t. That’s my beef, and that’s a big problem. Because, size not included, this is a car that is a devilish dream: A screamer, a looker and a winner. As Nissan’s upscale competitor to the BMW, Lexus and Acura options of the world, it arrives as a new vehicle this year and doesn’t miss a beat.\n\nBumps on the head are another matter.\n\nAs striking as it looks, as sizzling as it seems, there is one little problem with the 2003 Infiniti G35 coupe. If you don’t fit its demographic, you simply won’t fit inside.\n\nOh, the driver manages just fine. The G35’s firm, yet supportive, seats even offer an extra layer of padding to increase that “sports suspension” feel behind the wheel. But try and squeeze three passengers in the G35’s other cupholders, er … seats, and you’ve got a real problem.\n\nBut you don’t have a complaint with Infiniti.\n\nFittingly, so to speak, that’s where the automaker has covered its bases and hit two home runs in one. Can’t squeeze the coupe into your life? That’s where the G35 sedan comes in, a four-door option that offers one good one: More room. In sedan form, all problems are solved.\n\nA quick car becomes a competent car which becomes a happy customer. It’s a good option to have.\n\nBut if you don’t need the room and don’t care whether your passengers end up with a bad case of the bends, the coupe is a car deserving of your must-sit list.\n\nA week in the G brought out plenty of “gee, what power,” responses.\n\n(Some of those even came from the folks in the back.)\n\nIn either sedan or coupe, when you step on the pedal you can feel the G35 go. Step on the brake and prepare to stop on a dime. Step out of the car and admire it forever.\n\nInspired by the Nissan 350Z and longing to be a BMW competitor, the G35 is a stunner either from the street corner or on a trip to the corner store. Built on Nissan’s new FM (“Front Midship”) platform, the G is a lot like the Z in that Infiniti’s engineers have placed the V-6 engine farther rearward behind the front wheels. That means that overall weight distribution is close to the ideal balance of 50/50 – something that improves balance and handling and gives the G a very glue-like stickiness on the road, especially with 18-inch wheels.\n\nShuttle it into the corners and you can feel the engineering at work. Step on that V-6 and you can feel all 280 horsepower in the coupe (or 260 in the sedan) working it. That’s more power than every competitor in its class, except the Acura TL Type-S.\n\nInfiniti doesn’t stop there.\n\nFrom the inside-out, this is a car with passion. Turn the key and the dual exhaust rumbles to life. Turn a corner and the V-6 breathes new life. With a mostly aluminum interior, the instrument cluster and gauges are set up in a T-fashion, wrapping around the driver. The speedometer, tachometer and gauges all move with the steering wheel adjustment and the location of such simple things as climate control and radio controls are well thought out.\n\nEverything, from the form-fitting leather bucket seats to the low seating position, has been done with a sport’s car enthusiast in mind.\n\nAnd did we mention that it is available as a sports coupe? Like BMW, Infiniti is going after that muscular delivery, and it succeeded. The 3.5-liter V-6 is similar to those engines found in the Infiniti I35. It’s 24 valves of fun and a high-strung engine that is hard to lay off. Acceleration is strong and handling is on par with some of the best. It doesn’t lug in low gears and is seemless in the high end, testing your will to push the pedal harder.\n\nBut all is not perfect. There are some legitimate gripes, if only because it’s a new year.\n\nThe G coupe has the option of a six-speed transmission but the sedan only comes with a five-speed automatic with a sequentially shifting manual mode, something regrettable for anyone who likes to work the gears and clutch. The clutchless shifter allows you to work up and down through the “gears,” but it is nothing like driving the real thing.\n\nAnd forget about driving it in the snow or adjusting the seat.\n\nAlthough the G35 does come equipped with traction control, it is still a slippery adventure. Turn a corner on wet, slick or snowy roads and its easy to lose the back end. And try to adjust the front seats and you’ll have a hard time finding the switches – nobs that are sandwiched between the seats and the center console.\n\nDid we mention dimensions?\n\nRuler for ruler, the sedan is actually bigger than most of its competition. That means longer than a BMW 330i and Lexus IS 300 and it’s taller than most. But it doesn’t mean it’s heavier. Weight savings comes from a body structure that consists of a good share of aluminum, including the hood and front and rear suspension.\n\nThe same weight saving is there in the coupe, it’s just there’s no room for anything else. Jump into the sedan, instead of the coupe, and you get about 14 percent more room – or about two legs – and the trunk nearly doubles in size.\n\nBut, let’s be real. Getting someone (actually two people) behind the front seats is not a viable option. My suggestion: Can the back seats. Everyone knows this is a coupe. Why waste the trunk room trying to be something it’s not?\n\nWhat it is, though, is a pure driving experience for anyone interested in owning a cheaper alternative to the big boys.\n\nLooking at an Audi A4, a BMW 3-Series or a Lexus IS 300? The G offers impressive performance, price and package – all of it in base mode for $27,100.\n\nAll G35s also come with anti-lock brakes as well as side air bags, head-protection side curtain and a stability control system. It’s even good on gas mileage, riding in at around the low 20s in miles per gallon on mostly highway driving.\n\nAdd it all up and the G35 is an original car from the front to the back. It looks great, rides well and, for less than $30,000, it is even affordable.\n\nIt begs to be enjoyed. If only by yourself.\n\n2003 Infiniti G35\n\nRating: 3\n\nHigh Gear: A fast-paced alternative in the sport sedan market, the G35 offers horsepower, good handling and bol d styling on the inside and out.\n\nLow Gear: In coupe versions rear-seat room is tiny and in all models snow is a definite problem, as is finding the buttons to move the front seats.\n\nVehicle type: Rear-wheel-drive, front engine, two- or four-door, four- or five-passenger coupe or sedan.\n\nKey standard equipment (coupe): Six-speed manual transmission; four-wheel independent suspension; performance tires; front and rear ventilated disc brakes; four-wheel ABS; emergency braking assist; traction control; stability control; front side-mounted air bags; front and rear head air bags ; anti-theft alarm system; power door locks, windows, mirrors; cruise control; speed-sensitive tilt steering; climate control; AM/FM cassette in-dash six-CD player stereo; 160 watts stereo output; six total speakers.\n\nCompetition: Audi A4, BMW 3-Series, Cadillac CTS, Acura TL\n\nBase engine (coupe): 3.5-liter 280 horsepower V-6\n\nTorque (coupe): 270 foot-lbs. @ 4,800 rpm\n\nWheelbase: 112.2 inches\n\nLength: 182.2 inches\n\nMPG rating: 19 mpg city/24 mpg highway\n\nManufactured: Japan\n\nWarranty: Basic warranty is four years/60,000 miles; the drivetrain is six years/70,000 miles; body corrosion is four years/60,000 miles; roadside assistance is seven years/unlimited miles.\n\nBase price (coupe): $27,100\n\nPrice as tested (including options, destination and delivery): $30,920",

      "expert_review": "Stuck in the snow? Not in a G35x\n\nGROSSE POINTE WOODS–When the Weather Channel begins issuing warnings about an impending snowstorm, some people run to the store for bread and milk.\n\nWe run out to our front driveway to move test vehicles before the city snowplow barrels through our cul-de-sac and blocks us in. Because we have the luxury of two driveways, we park nearly everything in the back in bad weather, where the end of our driveway and the street get scraped clean.\n\nBut during a recent snow-and-ice storm, we left a 2004 Infiniti G35x out front as an experiment of sorts. We wanted to see how the all-wheel-drive version of the G35 would perform in what we consider one of the most grueling subdivision driving tests, getting out of the driveway and on with life in the worst weather conditions.\n\nNissan Motor Co. bills the new G35x, from the automaker’s upscale Infiniti division, as having “intelligent all-wheel drive that changes with the weather.” This newest version of the G35 is on sale now, starting at $32,490, including a $590 destination charge.\n\nThe G35x is part of a growing trend. Manufacturers are increasingly offering family sedans and wagons with all-wheel drive, a feature that used to be found primarily on sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks.\n\nAll-wheel drive improves traction in snow and mud, as well as on rough road surfaces, because power is delivered to all four wheels.\n\nThe downside is that such systems typically add to the vehicle.s weight, so they tend to reduce fuel economy. And full-time all-wheel drive can hamper handling to some extent and detract from a sporty driving feeling, especially in tight corners.\n\nThe list of family cars offering all-wheel drive will expand this year beyond traditional players such as Audi and Subaru to include such products as the 2005 Ford Five Hundred and Mercury Montego sedans, 2005 Ford Freestyle wagon, 2005 Chrysler 300 sedan and 2005 Dodge Magnum wagon.\n\nThe all-wheel-drive G35x seemed the perfect choice for our winter test-drive experiment.\n\nIt has the reputation of being one of the sexiest family sedans on the market, due to its voluptuous lines and grown-up-looking cabin, which, on the G35x, is dolled up in perforated black leather and titanium trim.\n\nThe mid-size Infiniti sedan comes with a powerful engine, a twin-cam 3.5-liter V-6 that makes 260 horsepower and 260 pounds-feet of torque, and is linked to a five-speed automatic transmission with manual shift mode.\n\nIf the G35x passed our scrutiny, it would conceivably give buyers the best of both worlds, a hot performance sedan that could stand up to the elements.\n\nOur experiment with the five-passenger G35x actually began two weeks earlier in Palm Springs, Calif. Anita took the G35x for a two-hour drive on the twisty roads in the foothills surrounding the city to test its handling characterist ics on dry roads in sunny, warm weather.\n\nThe bad news is that the G35x is characterized by a rough ride that makes you feel almost every bump and imperfection in the pavement.\n\nThe good news is that the all-wheel-drive G35x acts a lot like the rear-wheel-drive G35, thanks to a sophisticated system that is capable of sending up to 100 percent of the power to the rear wheels in the best road conditions.\n\nIn fact, without the “x” on the silver nameplate on the rear of the G35, which signals its all-wheel-drive capability, you’d be hard pressed to feel the difference between the two siblings.\n\nThe G35x shines when it comes to cornering. Its all-wheel-drive system can detect traction needs throughout the course of a turn and react in a manner that.s imperceptible to the driver. The system can shift torque back and forth rapidly between the front and rear wheels to help enhance stability and traction.\n\nBack in Detroit, our test G35x had a s icker price of $35,870. Options included a $3,200 premium package that included a power sunroof, dual-zone climate controls, reclining rear seat backs and one-touch up/down windows.\n\nAs we expected, the amply equipped G35x is more expensive than its rear-wheel-drive counterpart. A base rear-wheel-drive G35 costs $28,540, including a $590 destination charge.\n\nStandard features on the all-wheel-drive G35 include antilock brakes and vehicle dynamic control, which helps to prevent wheel slip and skidding on wet or icy pavement.\n\nThere’s also lots of attention to safety, even more than you get on a base G35. The G35x has a standard tire-pressure monitoring system and six air bags, including side-curtain air bags that protect all outboard passengers.\n\nAs a true family vehicle, the G35x has some shortcomings.\n\nThere is not much rear legroom. The rear seat would benefit from a 60/40 split-folding feature, too.\n\nSurprisingly, the fuel economy doesn.t suffer much with the added weight of all-wheel drive. The base Infiniti G35 gets 18 miles per gallon in city driving and 26 mpg on the highway. The G35x gets 17 mpg in city driving and 24 on the highway.\n\nEventually, the snow began to fall.\n\nThe city snowplows came down our street twice in one afternoon, piling up glistening mounds of snow at both ends of our semicircular driveway.\n\nIt was clear that few people in our neighborhood were venturing out on this February night. We decided to leave the snow blower and shovel in the garage, jump in the G35x and head out to our favorite restaurant on Lake St. Clair.\n\nThe G35x is user-friendly. There are no levers to pull or buttons to push on the all-wheel-drive model. The system is automatic and invisible to the driver.\n\nInfiniti says that a unique feature of the G35x is the addition of a “snow-mode function,” which helps the driver avoid wheel spin on snowy roads by evenly splitting the initial torque distribution between the front and rear wheels.\n\nThe G35x easily made it over the snow pile at the end of the driveway, performing in a manner that reminded us of our old Volvo Cross Country wagon.\n\nAs we made our way down the slippery street, the back end of the Infiniti began to slide slightly to the right. But the car automatically seemed to correct the slip without much input from the driver.\n\nAfter an uneventful five-mile drive along Lake Shore Drive, we pulled into the restaurant parking lot. It was virtually empty. Inside, the hostess asked us if we .had a reservation. and then laughed at her own joke.\n\nThe place was deserted at the height of the dinner hour. Few people, it seemed, were brave enough to venture out into the bad weather.\n\nThanks to the G35x, we had a delightful candlelight dinner in the middle of a snowstorm on a Tuesday night. If we were in the market for a family sedan, we decided that a ll-wheel drive is fast becoming a must-have feature.",

      "expert_review": "I’ve taken every opportunity to drive the Infiniti G35, be it coupe or sedan, since its introduction in the United States in spring 2002. This time, it was the 2007 G35 coupe with a five-speed automatic transmission that can be shifted manually.\n\nThe more discerning of my peers might have ignored the 2007 model, which is soon to be replaced by the more powerful and spectacularly beautiful 2008 G37 coupe.\n\nMy associate Ria Manglapus and I will get to the G37 soon enough. Judging from Ria’s tightfisted hold on the G35 coupe — I practically had to pry the steering wheel from her hands — she might get to the G37 before I do. But we both jumped to play with the G35 despite its moribund status in the market. It’s our kind of car, a hot ride for ordinary people.\n\nThat means we love cars and driving. We also like peace of mind. Super-exotic cars are great conversation pieces, but most of them, especially the coupes, are not practical for how we live. We can’t afford to buy such machines. And even if someone gave us an exotic car, we wouldn’t be able to operate it long-term or properly care for it on our household budgets.\n\nWe have families. We have friends. They might ooh and ahh over an exotic car in our possession. But if we can’t take them along for a ride because of the car’s limited seating, most admirers quickly lose interest. Some become disgruntled. We don’t like that. We like cars that make people happy.\n\nThe rear-wheel-drive Infiniti G35 coupe, which has ample seating for four people, is that kind of car. It looks hot, feels sexy. It has an exhaust note — a low whine that builds to a roar — that’s reminiscent of, well, you understand. This is a family newspaper. Suffice it to say that it’s satisfying.\n\nMuch is made in the automotive media about a car’s ability to move from 0 to 60 mph in so many seconds, as if we’re all poised at stoplights with stopwatches at the ready. We sometimes fall into that foolishness in this space. Foolishness? Yes. Let’s be real. You can go to hell or to jail in a Volkswagen just as quickly as you can in a Porsche, and neither the devil nor the judge will care much about the car you used to get there.\n\nYou certainly can go to either of those places in a G35 coupe that attracts more than its fair share of law-enforcement attention, comes with a 3.5-liter V-6 engine that produces a maximum 275 horsepower when linked to the five-speed automatic transmission, and develops 293 horsepower when mated with the available six-speed manual gearbox.\n\nHow fast must you go before you’ve gone too far? How often can you go there? What’s the point?\n\nWe just want a nice, spirited drive. We like taking road trips without speeding tickets. The G35, driven within reason, gives us everything we want and then some. The car is loaded with amenities, including reasonably supple leather seats that are kind to backs and butts, a six-speaker audio system with MP3 playback capability, and a heating and ventilation system that provides excellent interior air flow — rapid heating and cooling — with minimum hassle.\n\nWe could live without the dated pop-up, hide-away navigation screen atop the center console stack in the G35 coupe. As proof, we seldom bothered to tap its button to raise and use it. But overall, we are quite happy with this car.\n\nAs a result, we are not concerned about whether the G35 matches or beats the BMW 3 Series in highway performance, though the coming G37 coupe is likely to rekindle that argument. We like BMW’s 3 Series. We love it, in fact. But BMW is BMW in much the same manner that Porsche is Porsche and Mercedes-Benz is Mercedes-Benz. If you like those cars and have the money to buy them, go ahead. But for thousands of dollars less, we’ll take the G35 coupe, still have a great time behind the wheel and use the leftover cash for something else.\n\n2007 Infiniti G35 coupe Complaints: Infiniti is using a more-conventional, fixed navigational display screen in its 2008 G37 coupe. While we question the wisdom of installing fixed navigational systems in cars at a time when less expensive, higher quality, substantially more useful portable navigational systems are available (makes about as much sense as installing fixed car phones in a market flooded with exceptionally high-tech, handheld cellphones), we prefer the screen setup in the G37. Drive, acceleration and handling: Considering its price, the G35 coupe is tough to beat in city or highway driving. Again, we do not wish to get into the G35 versus BMW 3 Series argument, which is bottom-line silly inasmuch as both cars must be driven in a world of speed limits and traffic congestion, externalities that have a way of turning even the most-exotic high-performance car into a frustrated wimp. But when you put the G35’s excellent all-around road performance together with its affordability and livability, it comes out as the top of our vehicle ratings. Head-turning quotient: We’re just happy that Infiniti didn’t ship the test car to us in red. We have a great deal of respect for law-enforcement personnel, but we’d rather not be pulled over for roadside conversations. (I was followed by Virginia state troopers on several occasions. I had the distinct feeling that they were just waiting for me to stomp the pedal.) Body style/layout: The 2007 Infiniti G35 is a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive, mid-size, entry-level luxury sports coupe. It also is available as a sedan. The coming G37 coupe will replace the G35 coupe, but the G35 sedan will continue in production. Engine/transmission: The 2007 G35 coupe comes with a 3.5-liter, 24-valve, double overhead cam V-6 engine that develops 275 horsepower at 6,200 rpm and 268 foot-pounds of torque at 4,800 rpm when mated to Infiniti’s five-speed, shiftable automatic transmission. The same engine in the G35 Coupe 6MT (six-speed manual transmission) delivers a maximum 293 horsepower. Capacities: There are seats for four people. Luggage space is marginal at 7.8 cubic feet. The fuel tank holds 20 gallons of required premium unleaded gasoline. Mileage: We averaged 23 miles per gallon mostly in highway driving. Safety: Antilock brakes, side and head air bags, and electronic stability and traction control are standard. Price: The base price on the 2007 Infiniti G35 coupe with five-speed automatic transmission is $33,450. Dealer’s invoice price on that model is $30,763. Price as tested is $39,465, including $5,300 in options (navigation, sport-tuned suspension, sunroof, rear spoiler, satellite radio) and a $715 destination charge. Dealer’s price as tested is $36,119. Prices are sourced from Infiniti and www.edmunds.com. Purse-strings note: Possible bargains, totaling as much as $3,000 in price breaks, are available on the G35 coupe, which is to be discontinued. If you neither need nor want the extra horsepower being offered by the G37 replacement, and if you can live without having the very latest thing, the G35 coupe is an excellent buy.",
