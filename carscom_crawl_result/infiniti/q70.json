      "expert_review": "The 2014 Infiniti Q70 is a lame duck in some ways, but it remains a fowl with redeeming qualities.\n\nIf the Infiniti Q70 sedan — formerly the M37 — had tough midsize competition before in the BMW 5 Series, Mercedes-Benz E-Class, Lexus GS and Jaguar XF, it has even tougher competition in its pending successor: a 2015 Q70 that’s slated to go on sale later this year.\n\nExterior & Styling\nUnfortunately, the inoffensively styled 2014 Q70 is upstaged by the more elegant lines of the coming 2015, which apes Maserati and other classic sports cars. The current Infiniti Q70 looks a bit more swollen, despite all its swoopiness.\n\nWhile the front fenders, headlights and grille might come off as bulbous, though, the short rear deck and stylish taillights remain a terrific look.\n\nHow It Drives\nIn this class I’ve always liked what the Infiniti Q70 offers: a comfortable ride with plenty of power on demand. As cars get bigger you would think drivers would expect less handling prowess from them, simply due to the amount of mass. To me, the fact that the sport-tuned 5 Series and GS can take a turn sharper than the Infiniti isn’t necessarily a detriment to the Q70, because shoppers in this segment might not be demanding extreme corner carving; personally, I’d take the added ride superiority. Compare all three, as well as the Mercedes-Benz E-Class, here.\n\nUnfortunately, our Q70 S was a trim level (technically an optional Sport Package) that firms up that nice suspension, adds 20-inch alloy wheels and more aggressive tires, and makes the Q70 generally less pleasant to pilot around town or on long highway trips — two things at which the Q70 without this package excels.\n\nUnder the hood of our test car was the larger engine, Infiniti’s potent 5.6-liter V-8 producing 420 horsepower and 417 pounds-feet of torque. A quite-capable 3.7-liter V-6  powertrain is standard, with 330 hp and 270 pounds-feet of torque, paired to a seven-speed automatic transmission. Rear-wheel drive is standard and all-wheel drive (AWD) an option with either power plant.\n\nEven with so much power at hand, the rear-drive Q70 doesn’t launch off the line like you’d expect. You need to use the car’s manual shift mode and paddles to get a little extra hustle off the line. Again, it’s on the highway that the car’s acceleration shines, passing effortlessly and in a rather quiet manner at high speeds.\n\nVery little wind or engine noise intrudes in the cabin, and only the sport-focused tires seem to exhibit unwanted noise. Again, opting out of the S trim will likely solve that issue.\n\nA Q70 Hybrid is also available, with a V-6 engine teamed with a 50-kilowatt electric motor and high-voltage battery pack to produce a combined 360 hp and fuel economy that’s rated 29/34/31 mpg city/highway/combined. That’s a healthy boost from the quite-thirsty gasoline pair, rated 18/26/21 mpg for the V-6 and 16/24/19 mpg for the V-8. The Lexus GS also comes in a hybrid option, and BMW offers a diesel 535d that returns similar fuel economy, at 26/38/30 mpg.\n\nInterior\nI’ve always admired the posh look of the Q70’s interior, with plush leather padding on the doors, armrests and nearly every other surface, including plush leather seats. Some automakers, like BMW and Mercedes-Benz, use imitation leather standard, even in this class. A mixture of pearlescent wood accents, metal trim and well-executed controls in the Q70 also say “upscale” to me.\n\nOther editors on staff, however, find the current Q70 deficient in luxury appointments versus the competition. These same editors agree that the 2015 we inspected at the 2014 New York International Auto Show seems to have addressed those issues.\n\nThe luxury grade notwithstanding, the cabin is a completely comfortable place to reside during any length of drive. Drivers face an intricate gauge cluster in the 2014 while commanding a thickly wrapped leather steering wheel.\n\nPower-adjustable heated seats are standard, while cooled seats are optional on the V-6 and standard on the V-8. They work as intended. (Sometimes the cooling in climate-controlled seats do not actually deliver substantial cooling.)\n\nThere’s no way to avoid mentioning the somewhat cramped backseat. While no tighter than a 5 Series, GS or XF, those cars are certainly not spacious, either. My knees had enough room to not touch the front seat (adjusted for my 5-foot, 10-inch height), but there wasn’t much wiggle room. It felt tight back there, but the average adult should fit.\n\nWith my children’s safety seats installed, both children — ages 5 and 6 — had a hard time climbing in and out of the Q70, much the same way they do when I test a compact sedan like a Honda Civic.\n\nThe 2015 Infiniti Q70 will come in a standard length, like the current model, but also as a long-wheelbase model that opens up more room. So if you’re looking for a bigger backseat, you may want to wait for the Infiniti Q70L.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nInfiniti introduced a two-screen multimedia system in the all-new compact Q50 last year, but the 2015 Infiniti Q70 keeps the single-screen layout of the current model. This easy-to-use system has always been a favorite.\n\nNot only are all the various features — radio, iPod, satellite, climate, navigation system — easy to get to thanks to shortcut buttons, but one of my favorite features is the “status” page that shows a mix of the above, like the current music selection and trip mileage, or the ventilation settings.\n\nThe Bose stereo system — again, standard in V-8 models and optional in the V-6 — is decent for this class. The backrest-mounted surround speakers, however — located on either side of the headrest — are nearly imperceptible in terms of producing actual sound, no matter how much I fiddled with the settings. They’re more show than anything else.\n\nCargo & Storage\nAt 14.9 cubic feet, the trunk is a decent size for the class, besting the 5 Series, at 14 cubic feet, and the GS, at 14.3 cubic feet.\n\nIn the cabin, there’s a fair amount of storage in the center console, with covered cupholders and additional storage by the shifter. Storage built into the doors is tight, however.\n\nSafety\nThe Infiniti Q70 has a five-star overall crash-test rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, and it earned top scores of good in moderate-overlap front, side, rear and roof-strength tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. It hasn’t been subjected to that organization’s stringent new small-overlap frontal crash test.\n\nInfiniti has long promoted active safety systems and was one of the first to develop lane departure warning and correction, both of which can be had in the Q70 — along with blind-spot and forward collision warning — as part of option packages. A backup camera is standard, but Infiniti’s well-liked Around View Monitor is not offered.\n\nView all the Q70’s safety features here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nGenerally, Infiniti offers good value versus its competition in the luxury world. Its Q50 offers competitive performance and features as well as generally a lower price than the comparable BMWs of the world. The Infiniti Q70 is not quite a bargain, however, especially in the V-8 version. Starting at $63,005 including destination, it’s slightly less than the BMW 550i, at $64,825, and a tad more than the Mercedes-Benz E550 — which has standard all-wheel drive (AWD) — at $62,325.\n\nThe Infiniti Q70 V-6, at $50,505, comes in right between the Lexus GS, at $48,610, and the 535i, at $56,025. I would recommend paying less for the GS and more for the 535i to anyone who asked, but with the 2015 model on the horizon, there could end up being some good deals on outgoing 2014s.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "What it is: The Infiniti Q70 luxury sedan is offered in standard- and long-wheelbase versions, as well as a standard-wheelbase-only hybrid. The base engine is a 3.7-liter V-6, but a 5.6-liter V-8 is available. Rear- and all-wheel-drive models are offered, and the Q70 competes against the Audi A6, Mercedes-Benz E-Class and BMW 5 Series.\n\n\n\n(Skip to details on the Q70L and Q70 Hybrid)\n\n\nInfiniti's InTouch screen is now standard.\n\nQ70L\n\nThe Q70L is the long-wheelbase version of the Q70. At 120.1 inches, the wheelbase is 5.9 inches longer than the standard Q70’s for more backseat legroom. Like the regular-wheelbase Q70, the Q70L is powered by a 3.7-liter V-6 or a 5.6-liter V-8 engine.\n\nWhat’s Special\n\n5.6 inches of additional rear legroom\nRear- or all-wheel drive\nAuto-cinching rear doors\n\nBack to top\n\nQ70 Hybrid\n\nThe Q70 Hybrid is powered by a 3.5-liter V-6 engine and a 50-kilowatt electric motor. Infiniti claims its testing has shown that, in mixed driving, the Q70 Hybrid can drive on electric power for up to 50 percent of the time.\n\nWhat’s Special\n\nEPA-estimated 30 mpg in combined driving\nLithium-ion battery pack powers electric motor\n360-hp total system output\nRear-wheel-drive only\n\nBack to top",

      "expert_review": "Infiniti has injected new life — and extra length — into its midsize Q70 sedan for 2015, but its electronics remain stuck in the past.\n\nThough the car long known as the M37/M56 was renamed Q70 for 2014, only now has it gotten an updated exterior with minor enhancements inside. The big news for 2015, though, is the larger model Infiniti has added, the Q70L.\n\nThanks to the Q70L’s larger overall size, rear passengers now have ridiculously spacious accommodations, versus the just-spacious-enough environment in the regular Q70. Luxury buyers, however, may be more focused on technology, and that hasn’t been upgraded for 2015. These tech relics may prevent people from appreciating how great-looking the car is and how it compares to the best of its competition.\n\nI drove a V-8-powered Q70L for this review. You can compare the 2014 and 2015 Q70 here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nAll Q70s have a revised exterior that sharpens the previous model’s smooth yet somewhat bulbous lines. This helps bring the Q70 more in line with the recently redesigned Q50 compact sedan while still retaining the elegant feel it’s always had.\n\nThe new headlights feature light-pipe “eyebrow” daytime running lights. It’s a modern technique much of the competition uses, but I wasn’t fond of the chrome jewelry surrounding the fog lights. This is the standard look for all three trim levels: the Q70, Q70L and Q70 Hybrid. However, on the standard-wheelbase Q70 you can opt for a Sport Package that has a different treatment up front, dumping the fog-light jewelry, among other tweaks. Perhaps Infiniti should just make the change across the board.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe Q70 and Q70L come standard with a 3.7-liter V-6 that produces 330 horsepower and 270 pounds-feet of torque. A 5.6-liter V-8 and all-wheel drive are optional on both, and the model I tested for this review was equipped with both.\n\nI would be perfectly happy driving that engine forever. Sure, other cars in this class sport more than 420 hp, but there aren’t many power plants out there that still emit such a mechanical grunt and visceral feel — and other editors agreed.\n\nIn place of the standard rear-wheel drive, the optional all-wheel drive means acceleration is almost instantaneous. You might think the Q70 is just a point-and-shoot muscle machine, but it handles well, too, with heavy yet accurate steering that  reminds me of the heyday of the best handlers in this class — BMWs that are now gone.\n\nThe V-8, all-wheel-drive Q70L feels as heavy as you’d expect a 4,345-pound machine to be. I was a bit surprised when comparing specs that the V-8-powered BMW 550 is heavier, at 4,519 pounds, as it doesn’t feel quite as weighed down as the Infiniti. The regular-wheelbase Q70 with all-wheel drive and a V-8 weighs 4,224, while the V-6 Q70 comes in at 4,063 pounds with all-wheel drive. Japanese all-wheel-drive competitors like the Acura RLX and Lexus GS 350 both come in under 4,000 pounds. In short, the Q70 weighs more and feels like it, while the RLX and GS sport similar room inside and are lighter on their feet, delivering a significantly different driving feel.\n\nYou can compare the Q70, RLX, GS 350 and 5 Series here.\n\nMileage for the Q70 V-6 and V-8 — with or without all-wheel drive — is directly in line with the competition. My V-8 all-wheel-drive test car was rated 16/23/18 mpg city/highway/combined. I averaged only 14.8 mpg in my time with the car in mostly congested commuting traffic and on suburban surface roads. That number wasn’t helped by the V-8, which basically begged me to strap on my lead foot.\n\nInterior\nThe Q70’s interior wowed me when it debuted in the 2011 M37 and M56. There have been minor improvements since then, including a few with this 2015 update, but what’s remarkable is how well the basics of the 4-year-old interior have held up when compared with the competition.\n\nNeither the RLX nor GS feel as plush inside as the Q70’s generously padded leather seats or quilted door coverings. The wood that adorns nearly the entire center console, as well as various sections of the dash and doors, looks good, too; a pearlescent version I’ve previously tested is my favorite. The controls still look to be on par with the competition; the small, chromed dials for the heated and cooled seats are another personal favorite — and then there’s just how comfortable the seats are up front with their wide bottoms and backs.\n\nShoppers interested in the larger rear confines of the Q70L will be glad to know that it’s more than 5 inches of extra legroom versus the Q70; that’s an even more significant increase than a simple number can express. Adults will be able to cross their legs if they feel so inclined. My children are still in child-safety seats, but they can open this car’s doors and climb into the seats all on their own.\n\nThe footwells in the Q70L are so large that both my children could stand in them without touching either the rear or front seats, with the only obstacle being the large hump in the middle of the floor housing the driveshaft.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nWhen you test cars for a living, it becomes very apparent when multimedia systems are truly easy to use. You often switch from a car with touch interfaces, buttons, control knobs and more, which are laid out in a specific way, to another car with all those things done in a completely different manner.\n\nSure, owners will get used to whatever setup they must live with over time, but that doesn’t change the inherent ease of use of a good system like that found in the Infiniti. The Q70 sports such a system, with a single large display screen, a control knob directly below it, and a small array of buttons that work as shortcuts for the most frequently used functions. This is what you want out of a good multimedia system.\n\nWhere the Q70 loses points is that this system is still an aging one, especially in terms of graphics clarity and the greater number of features competitors include (things like enhancements to navigation or apps for streaming radio and more).\n\nThe most glaringly dated aspect resides between the two rather elegant gauges: the poor trip computer. The small screen is stuck a few years in the past, with a white-on-black, pixelated readout that the Q70’s lowly sibling the Nissan Altima puts to shame with its own crisp display in that area.\n\nIt might seem like a small thing, but in an interior that otherwise stands the test of time, a potential shopper might not be able to look past it.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe Q70 and Q70L have identical trunk volume, measuring 14.9 cubic feet. It’s a space most shoppers will find plenty large enough for luggage, golf bags and other day-to-day cargo. The RLX has identical dimensions, and the 5 Series and Lexus GS come in slightly smaller.\n\nInside, the aging design doesn’t satisfy modern demand for places to shove mobile appliances, like large smartphones and numerous water bottles. The cubby in the center console is a decent size, however.\n\nSafety\nThe Q70 has a five-star overall crash-test rating from the federal government, and it earned Top Safety Pick Plus status from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. To earn IIHS’ top designation, cars must combine favorable test ratings with forward-collision prevention systems. Infiniti’s was one of the earliest on the market.\n\nThe Q70’s optional system has both collision warning and automated emergency braking. In IIHS testing, the braking system prevented a collision in the low-speed, 12-mph test and reduced impact at 22 mph in the higher-speed test.\n\nThe Q70 also has available lane departure warning and a 360-degree camera system that aids in parking, called Around View Monitor. It’s a favorite technology among Cars.com’s editors.\n\nSee all the Q70’s safety features here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nStarting at just more than $50,000 for a V-6, rear-wheel-drive Q70, the Infiniti sedan is priced competitively for the segment. Move up to the loaded, V-8-powered Q70L like the one we tested and you’re looking at a sticker just over $75,000 — hard to swallow no matter how well it measures up against similarly powered models on the market.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Infiniti Q70?\n\nThe 2019 Infiniti Q70 is a mid-size luxury sedan that can seat up to five people. It comes standard with a 330-horsepower, 3.7-liter V-6 engine; a 416-hp, 5.6-liter V-8 is optional. Both engines work with a seven-speed automatic transmission. Rear- and all-wheel-drive models are offered, along with a long-wheelbase Q70L. Competitors include the Audi A6, Mercedes-Benz E-Class and BMW 5 Series.\n\nWhat's New on the 2019 Infiniti Q70?\n\nNew standard features include built-in navigation, a Bose premium stereo, a 360-degree camera system, front and rear parking sensors, leather upholstery and a heated steering wheel.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Infiniti Q70 Are Most Important?\n\nAvailable all-wheel drive should give drivers concerned with winter traction extra peace of mind, while the optional V-8 engine should appeal to performance enthusiasts. Besides the new standard features mentioned above, the Q70 also has a standard power moonroof, heated and cooled front seats, ash wood trim, satellite radio, Bluetooth streaming audio, dual-zone automatic air conditioning and a power-adjustable steering column. Optional active safety features include predictive forward collision warning, lane departure warning and prevention, automatic emergency braking and a blind spot warning system.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Infiniti Q70?\n\nCertain areas of the Q70, like the instrument panel, are showing the car's age, but the sedan still offers a luxurious cabin and the available V-8 is powerful. We also like the extra backseat room in the Q70L. However, if you're interested in the latest driver-assist technology, one of the Q70's competitors might suit you better.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: A powerful V-8 engine can’t make up for the awkward handling, strange ergonomics and dated electronics of the 2016 Infiniti Q70.\n\nVersus the competition: There are plenty of better $70,000 cars that feature up-to-date multimedia systems and displays, top-notch handling, powerful engines and luxurious interiors.\n\nBig, rear-wheel-drive luxury cars are the aspirational rides of choice for millions of people around the world. They’re the technology showcases for luxury brands, featuring dazzling electronics, remarkable powertrains and styling meant to epitomize their brand’s themes and execution. Infiniti’s top sedan is the Q70, a rear- or all-wheel-drive sedan featuring a V-6, V-8 or hybrid powertrain. It’s available as a long-wheelbase model, as well.\n\nThe Q70 had its last major redesign in 2010, back when it was still called the M. A minor refresh for the 2015 model year brought slightly updated styling but carried over the powertrain (see the changes from 2015 to 2016 here). Despite that refresh not two years ago, the Q70 has some challenges. Many competing vehicles have undergone major redos, including the Mercedes-Benz E-Class and the Lexus GS, and others are entirely new, like the Cadillac CT6. Can the Q70 keep Infiniti in the fight for premium buyers?\nExterior & Styling\nThe styling of the Q70 has never been a problem. It’s sleek, muscular and employs the classic “Coke-bottle” shape that has adorned performance cars for decades. It’s a good look, lending the Q70 a swoopy shape that hides the car’s size. But it has one unusual issue: The gaps between the top of the tires and the bottom of the fender arches are comically wide. I could fit my entire fist between the big, optional 20-inch rear tires and the fender without touching either one, lending the car a strange, lifted look that may be an unfortunate side effect of its all-wheel-drive powertrain.\n\nA longer version is also available in the Q70L, with an extended wheelbase that creates more rear seat room, but my test car was a normal-wheelbase Premium Select Edition featuring dark chrome exterior trim, dark bumpers, a deck-lid spoiler and special wheels. The look is svelte and appealing, and aside from the aforementioned odd wheel wells, it would stand up nicely against more modern designs like the Mercedes-Benz E-Class, BMW 5 Series, Cadillac CT6 and Lexus GS.\nHow It Drives\nUnder the shapely hood of my test car was a beast of an engine: Infiniti’s 5.6-liter V-8. It’s the optional motor; a 3.7-liter V-6 comes standard. The big V-8 makes a naturally aspirated 420 horsepower, which translates into plenty of thrust and an impressive, throaty burble. It doesn’t sound as brash as some of the American V-8 sedans, or as mechanically sonorous as those from German luxury brands, but it provides plenty of smooth power, especially when combined with the seven-speed automatic transmission. The Q70 sits on a rear-wheel-drive platform, and my test model featured optional all-wheel drive.\n\nThat all-wheel drive is primarily for traction in inclement conditions; it’s not for improved handling, as the Q70’s ride and handling are a bit of a mess. The steering and suspension are frenetic and felt poorly matched to my test car’s massive 20-inch wheels. Broken pavement sends the steering wheel into jerky fits in the driver’s hands, and it can even cause the car to lose its tracking as the stiff sport suspension sends plenty of vibration and harsh reaction into the cabin. At 70 mph, the passenger seat vibrates and quivers if nobody is in it. Steering feel and feedback aren’t bad, but there’s no impetus to drive this car in an aggressive, sporty manner given the suspension’s unsettled nature.\n\nThat’s a shame, because there are several things about the Q70 that are, independently, quite good. The four-piston front and two-piston rear brakes included with the Premium Select Edition option package are strong, and the powertrain is impressive, but the rest of the platform feels as if it’s been wound too tight. The Cadillac CT6, by contrast, is a paragon of effortless motoring; it’s smooth and well-damped, with chassis sophistication that surpasses the Q70’s. The exact same thing can be said of BMW’s excellent 550i xDrive sedan. Even the new Genesis G80 feels better-executed than the Q70.\n\nWhile the power from the 5.6-liter V-8 is nice, the fuel economy penalty you’ll pay for it is not. The Q70 V-8 is EPA-rated at 16/23/18 mpg city/highway/combined with all-wheel drive. My week of driving netted only about 16 mpg overall. The V-6 is more efficient, rated 18/24/20 mpg with all-wheel drive. Rear-drive versions are better in both cases: 18/26/21 mpg with the V-6 and 16/24/19 mpg with the V-8.\n\nIf fuel economy is important to you, the Q70 can be had as a hybrid, as well, which is rated a much more impressive 29/34/31 mpg. Competitors like the BMW 550i xDrive aren’t much more efficient, garnering a 16/25/19 mpg rating, but other competitors have eschewed big V-8 engines in exchange for smaller, turbocharged ones. The all-wheel-drive Cadillac CT6 is a good example of this: Its top engine is a twin-turbocharged, 3.0-liter V-6 mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission. It makes almost as much power as the Infiniti V-8 but is rated 18/26/21 mpg. The Genesis G80 has V-8 power but not with all-wheel drive. It’s rated slightly worse: 15/23/18 mpg.\nInterior\nThe Infiniti Q70’s cabin presents new issues. The seating position is unusually high, making it easy to get into but requiring an unexpected step down when getting out. Visibility is good, and the sculpted hood is fun to peer over (it’s always fun when the exterior styling is viewable from the interior). But it can’t be denied that, overall, the interior feels old and less than competitive.\n\nSeat comfort is decent, especially in the back, and leather quality is acceptable. But the Q70’s faux aluminum trim doesn’t match up well from the dash to the doors, and the quality of the plastic feels no better than the best Nissans; it’s certainly not worth a premium price.\nErgonomics & Electronics\nA big part of the problem with the interior involves its out-of-date electronic displays — from the central gauge cluster’s monochrome LCD to a menu-based multimedia system that looks nearly a decade out of date, lacking the resolution of today’s best systems. It all just makes the Q70 feel old. The resolution issue with the central screen is a big one because it makes the backup camera’s clarity terrible. It looks as if someone has smeared Vaseline over the camera lens.\n\nThe Q70’s button layout is also confusing, with seemingly little logic to the scattering of functions. It requires more attention while driving than it should. There was even a panel of switches located low on the dash, by my left knee, which were hard to operate while in motion. Simply put, the Q70’s interior ergonomics need a complete rethinking.\nCargo & Storage\nLuggage space in the trunk is average, rated at 14.9 cubic feet of space — plenty of room for a few large suitcases. The Cadillac CT6 and Genesis G80 are a little bit larger, at 15.3 cubic feet, and the BMW 550i (which at least has a 60/40-split folding backseat) is a bit smaller, at 14.0 cubic feet. The Q70’s backseat is a bench that doesn’t fold down but does offer an opening through the center armrest for longer items, like skis or things from the hardware store.\nSafety\nThe 2016 Infiniti Q70 received top scores in Insurance Institute for Highway Safety crash tests and a five-star overall safety rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. You can see how the V-6 model scored in all the various crash tests here.\n\nDespite the Q70’s out-of-date interior electronics, there is a full complement of modern safety equipment available: blind spot warning with steering intervention, forward collision alert with automatic emergency braking, backup collision intervention with automatic braking, lane departure warning and prevention, parking sensors, 360-degree cameras with moving object detection, and more. See a full list of the Q70’s safety equipment here.\nValue in Its Class\nThe Infiniti Q70 starts at $50,775 (including destination fee) for a base, rear-wheel-drive Q70 3.7. The all-wheel-drive version runs $52,905. Upgrade to a rear-wheel-drive Q70 5.6 and it’ll cost you $63,755, while the all-wheel-drive Q70 5.6 I tested starts at $66,255.\n\nMy car included a Premium Select Edition Package for $3,300, bringing my as-tested total to $69,555. You can certainly go higher. Add the Technology Package, which includes all those electronic safety goodies, and you’re also required to add either the Sport Package or Deluxe Touring Package, as well — but you can’t have it with the Premium Select Edition Package. Tick all the boxes, and you can max out a standard-wheelbase Q70 at just under $75,000. The longer-wheelbase Q70L model isn’t much more expensive, maxing out at just a little more than $76,000.\n\nCompetitors have passed the Infiniti Q70 in styling, efficiency, onboard technological sophistication and more. The Cadillac CT6 offers big interior space, stylish surroundings, cutting-edge technology and a choice of powertrains. Its fully loaded price comes in nearly $10,000 more than a top Q70L, but lesser versions — that still have plenty of equipment and the powerful twin-turbo, 3.0-liter V-6 engine — can be had for a comparable price.\n\nThe 2017 Genesis G80 is perhaps best known by the name it was called last year: the Hyundai Genesis. Part of a new luxury brand from Hyundai, it’s got a smooth, comfortable, rear-wheel-drive chassis and a choice of V-6 or V-8 power, as well. Like Infiniti, though, it’s not generally considered a top-tier luxury brand.\n\nThe BMW 550i xDrive is more bona fide, and its twin-turbocharged, 4.4-liter V-8 beats out even the Infiniti’s engine for horsepower and refinement. Combined with all-wheel drive it’s more expensive than the Q70 when comparable options are added, but its sophistication, chassis dynamics and superior multimedia technology give it an edge. Compare all four competitors here.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review for the 2016 Infiniti Q70 was written in September 2016, but little has changed for 2017. To see what’s new, click here, or to see a comparison side-by-side of the two model years, click here.\n\nBig, rear-wheel-drive luxury cars are the aspirational rides of choice for millions of people around the world. They’re the technology showcases for luxury brands, featuring dazzling electronics, remarkable powertrains and styling meant to epitomize their brand’s themes and execution. Infiniti’s top sedan is the Q70, a rear- or all-wheel-drive sedan featuring a V-6, V-8 or hybrid powertrain. It’s available as a long-wheelbase model, as well.\n\nThe Q70 had its last major redesign in 2010, back when it was still called the M. A minor refresh for the 2015 model year brought slightly updated styling but carried over the powertrain (see the changes from 2015 to 2016 here). Despite that refresh not two years ago, the Q70 has some challenges. Many competing vehicles have undergone major redos, including the Mercedes-Benz E-Class and the Lexus GS, and others are entirely new, like the Cadillac CT6. Can the Q70 keep Infiniti in the fight for premium buyers?\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nThe styling of the Q70 has never been a problem. It’s sleek, muscular and employs the classic “Coke-bottle” shape that has adorned performance cars for decades. It’s a good look, lending the Q70 a swoopy shape that hides the car’s size. But it has one unusual issue: The gaps between the top of the tires and the bottom of the fender arches are comically wide. I could fit my entire fist between the big, optional 20-inch rear tires and the fender without touching either one, lending the car a strange, lifted look that may be an unfortunate side effect of its all-wheel-drive powertrain. \n\nA longer version is also available in the Q70L, with an extended wheelbase that creates more rear seat room, but my test car was a normal-wheelbase Premium Select Edition featuring dark chrome exterior trim, dark bumpers, a deck-lid spoiler and special wheels. The look is svelte and appealing, and aside from the aforementioned odd wheel wells, it would stand up nicely against more modern designs like the Mercedes-Benz E-Class, BMW 5 Series, Cadillac CT6 and Lexus GS.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nUnder the shapely hood of my test car was a beast of an engine: Infiniti’s 5.6-liter V-8. It’s the optional motor; a 3.7-liter V-6 comes standard. The big V-8 makes a naturally aspirated 420 horsepower, which translates into plenty of thrust and an impressive, throaty burble. It doesn’t sound as brash as some of the American V-8 sedans, or as mechanically sonorous as those from German luxury brands, but it provides plenty of smooth power, especially when combined with the seven-speed automatic transmission. The Q70 sits on a rear-wheel-drive platform, and my test model featured optional all-wheel drive. \n\nThat all-wheel drive is primarily for traction in inclement conditions; it’s not for improved handling, as the Q70’s ride and handling are a bit of a mess. The steering and suspension are frenetic and felt poorly matched to my test car’s massive 20-inch wheels. Broken pavement sends the steering wheel into jerky fits in the driver’s hands, and it can even cause the car to lose its tracking as the stiff sport suspension sends plenty of vibration and harsh reaction into the cabin. At 70 mph, the passenger seat vibrates and quivers if nobody is in it. Steering feel and feedback aren’t bad, but there’s no impetus to drive this car in an aggressive, sporty manner given the suspension’s unsettled nature. \n\nThat’s a shame, because there are several things about the Q70 that are, independently, quite good. The four-piston front and two-piston rear brakes included with the Premium Select Edition option package are strong, and the powertrain is impressive, but the rest of the platform feels as if it’s been wound too tight. The Cadillac CT6, by contrast, is a paragon of effortless motoring; it’s smooth and well-damped, with chassis sophistication that surpasses the Q70’s. The exact same thing can be said of BMW’s excellent 550i xDrive sedan. Even the new Genesis G80 feels better-executed than the Q70. \n\nWhile the power from the 5.6-liter V-8 is nice, the fuel economy penalty you’ll pay for it is not. The Q70 V-8 is EPA-rated at 16/23/18 mpg city/highway/combined with all-wheel drive. My week of driving netted only about 16 mpg overall. The V-6 is more efficient, rated 18/24/20 mpg with all-wheel drive. Rear-drive versions are better in both cases: 18/26/21 mpg with the V-6 and 16/24/19 mpg with the V-8. \n\nIf fuel economy is important to you, the Q70 can be had as a hybrid, as well, which is rated a much more impressive 29/34/31 mpg. Competitors like the BMW 550i xDrive aren’t much more efficient, garnering a 16/25/19 mpg rating, but other competitors have eschewed big V-8 engines in exchange for smaller, turbocharged ones. The all-wheel-drive Cadillac CT6 is a good example of this: Its top engine is a twin-turbocharged, 3.0-liter V-6 mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission. It makes almost as much power as the Infiniti V-8 but is rated 18/26/21 mpg. The Genesis G80 has V-8 power but not with all-wheel drive. It’s rated slightly worse: 15/23/18 mpg.\n\nInterior\n\nThe Infiniti Q70’s cabin presents new issues. The seating position is unusually high, making it easy to get into but requiring an unexpected step down when getting out. Visibility is good, and the sculpted hood is fun to peer over (it’s always fun when the exterior styling is viewable from the interior). But it can’t be denied that, overall, the interior feels old and less than competitive. \n\nSeat comfort is decent, especially in the back, and leather quality is acceptable. But the Q70’s faux aluminum trim doesn’t match up well from the dash to the doors, and the quality of the plastic feels no better than the best Nissans; it’s certainly not worth a premium price.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nA big part of the problem with the interior involves its out-of-date electronic displays — from the central gauge cluster’s monochrome LCD to a menu-based multimedia system that looks nearly a decade out of date, lacking the resolution of today’s best systems. It all just makes the Q70 feel old. The resolution issue with the central screen is a big one because it makes the backup camera’s clarity terrible. It looks as if someone has smeared Vaseline over the camera lens. \n\nThe Q70’s button layout is also confusing, with seemingly little logic to the scattering of functions. It requires more attention while driving than it should. There was even a panel of switches located low on the dash, by my left knee, which were hard to operate while in motion. Simply put, the Q70’s interior ergonomics need a complete rethinking.\n\nCargo & Storage\n\nLuggage space in the trunk is average, rated at 14.9 cubic feet of space — plenty of room for a few large suitcases. The Cadillac CT6 and Genesis G80 are a little bit larger, at 15.3 cubic feet, and the BMW 550i (which at least has a 60/40-split folding backseat) is a bit smaller, at 14.0 cubic feet. The Q70’s backseat is a bench that doesn’t fold down but does offer an opening through the center armrest for longer items, like skis or things from the hardware store.\n\nSafety\n\nThe 2016 Infiniti Q70 received top scores in Insurance Institute for Highway Safety crash tests and a five-star overall safety rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. You can see how the V-6 model scored in all the various crash tests here.\n\nDespite the Q70’s out-of-date interior electronics, there is a full complement of modern safety equipment available: blind spot warning with steering intervention, forward collision alert with automatic emergency braking, backup collision intervention with automatic braking, lane departure warning and prevention, parking sensors, 360-degree cameras with moving object detection, and more. See a full list of the Q70’s safety equipment here.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nThe Infiniti Q70 starts at $50,775 (including destination fee) for a base, rear-wheel-drive Q70 3.7. The all-wheel-drive version runs $52,905. Upgrade to a rear-wheel-drive Q70 5.6 and it’ll cost you $63,755, while the all-wheel-drive Q70 5.6 I tested starts at $66,255. \n\nMy car included a Premium Select Edition Package for $3,300, bringing my as-tested total to $69,555. You can certainly go higher. Add the Technology Package, which includes all those electronic safety goodies, and you’re also required to add either the Sport Package or Deluxe Touring Package, as well — but you can’t have it with the Premium Select Edition Package. Tick all the boxes, and you can max out a standard-wheelbase Q70 at just under $75,000. The longer-wheelbase Q70L model isn’t much more expensive, maxing out at just a little more than $76,000. \n\nCompetitors have passed the Infiniti Q70 in styling, efficiency, onboard technological sophistication and more. The Cadillac CT6 offers big interior space, stylish surroundings, cutting-edge technology and a choice of powertrains. Its fully loaded price comes in nearly $10,000 more than a top Q70L, but lesser versions — that still have plenty of equipment and the powerful twin-turbo, 3.0-liter V-6 engine — can be had for a comparable price. \n\nThe 2017 Genesis G80 is perhaps best known by the name it was called last year: the Hyundai Genesis. Part of a new luxury brand from Hyundai, it’s got a smooth, comfortable, rear-wheel-drive chassis and a choice of V-6 or V-8 power, as well. Like Infiniti, though, it’s not generally considered a top-tier luxury brand. \n\nThe BMW 550i xDrive is more bona fide, and its twin-turbocharged, 4.4-liter V-8 beats out even the Infiniti’s engine for horsepower and refinement. Combined with all-wheel drive it’s more expensive than the Q70 when comparable options are added, but its sophistication, chassis dynamics and superior multimedia technology give it an edge.
