      "expert_review": "The verdict: Like much of Infiniti’s lineup, the QX70 SUV is fun to drive but in desperate need of a rethink of its styling, technology and ergonomics.\n\nVersus the competition: You wouldn’t think there would be many fast, sporty, athletic and impractical SUVs, but there are. BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Land Rover — they all make similarly utility-challenged SUVs with more up-to-date aesthetics and technology, though at a significantly higher price.\n\nWhen Infiniti launched the QX70 back in 2003 as the FX35/FX45, the brand referred to it as a “bionic cheetah.” Crossovers were still an unproven idea then, and making one off the company’s rear-wheel-drive performance platform was a bit odd; it was the same chassis that formed the basis of the sporty G35 sport sedan and coupe and the new Nissan 350Z sports car.\n\nThat platform continues to form the basis of the QX70, now on its third refresh but featuring the same roofline and style as when it debuted nearly 13 years ago. It received its only major update in 2009, then got a mild facelift in 2011 to bring some new front and rear styling and minor interior tweaks to the party (compare the 2015 and 2016 models here). Suffice it to say, the QX70 is old. But does its combination of speed, style and handling prowess keep it competitive with newer members of this unusual class, such as the BMW X6, Jaguar F-Pace and Porsche Macan?\nExterior & Styling\nThe “bionic cheetah” tag was created by Infiniti to try to describe what people were looking at when the original FX was introduced, and you can see where they were going with it. The shape is still sleek, low and muscular, with impossibly big wheels and tires filling out massive wheel wells. The front end’s feline look is notable, as are the muscular haunches and ready-to-spring look of the body. The styling is aging well, and Infiniti’s addition of a new Sport Package that adds dark wheels, a dark grille and blacked-out trim helps keep it fresh and interesting. That styling doesn’t help when you’re trying to use the QX70 as an SUV, however, as the low roofline makes getting in and out a contortion act and compromises cargo room.\nHow It Drives\nDynamically, the QX70 is pretty good despite its age. The car’s performance is one area in which Infiniti dialed in the settings quite well early on; from the powerful 325-horsepower, 3.7-liter V-6 to the seven-speed automatic transmission that shunts power to all four wheels, the QX70 is not lacking for grunt. Acceleration comes on strong and smooth with the naturally aspirated V-6, accompanied by an excellent exhaust note; Infiniti’s parent brand, Nissan, has always done a great job with the VQ-series V-6 engines, and this one is no exception.\n\nSteering feel is also excellent, with a firm effort and rewarding feedback. The suspension is unsettled by the optional, enormous and undoubtedly heavy 21-inch wheels; it works hard to try and keep calm and order inside the passenger cabin, which it does with mixed results. Smooth pavement is pleasant, but rough asphalt and potholes generate some harsh jolts. The brakes operate with a firm bite and progressive feel. The whole experience feels solid and planted, making the QX70 remarkably fun to drive. That sensation of heft is not surprising given the QX70’s considerable 4,300-pound curb weight. The BMW X6 is portlier still, but the Jaguar and Porsche are both several hundred pounds lighter.\n\nFuel economy suffers due to this weight disadvantage and the free-breathing nature of the 3.7-liter engine. The QX70 is rated a rather unfortunate 16/22/18 mpg city/highway/combined by the EPA, and my week of testing netted an unimpressive 16.3 mpg combined. Competing vehicles offer comparable six-cylinder engines that deliver comparable fuel economy, but they’re also available with a larger variety of powertrains. The X6’s 3.0-liter, turbocharged inline-six-cylinder engine is rated 18/24/20 mpg, while the Jaguar F-Pace’s 3.0-liter, supercharged V-6 is rated 18/23/20 mpg (both have eight-speed automatic transmissions). The Porsche Macan’s base engine for 2017 is a 2.0-liter, turbocharged four-cylinder rated 20/25/22 mpg but offering much less horsepower than the QX70.\nInterior\nIt’s inside the QX70 that the SUV’s age becomes immediately apparent. The shapes, materials, gauges, buttons — even the seating position feels outdated. The seats in my Sport Package-equipped model came with contrasting piping in the leather, which serves only to solidify the outdated interior theme. The seating position is awkward; it’s like Infiniti took a Q50 sedan and raised the seat 4 inches while keeping all the controls low. You feel like you’re sitting on the QX70, not in it.\n\nIt’s easy to bang your head on the sloping A-pillar when getting in and out because of the combination of high seat and low roofline. Outward visibility also suffers from this high seating position, both to the front and rear. The backseat isn’t much better, with a high bench and cramped legroom. Compared with the much more modern packaging and designs of the X6, F-Pace and even the slightly smaller Macan, the Infiniti’s older cabin styling really makes it feel out of place.\nErgonomics & Electronics\nA big part of the QX70’s dated feeling comes from its interior electronics. The multimedia system in particular is old and still looks like it has for multiple generations — well off the state-of-the-art systems seen in competing vehicles. This despite the fact that my test vehicle came loaded with every conceivable option, including navigation with live traffic and weather updates, a powered tilt and telescoping steering wheel, heated and cooled front memory seats with driver-side easy exit assist, tilt-with-reverse side mirrors and more.\nCargo & Storage\nAs an SUV, the QX70 doesn’t really work that well. Like the BMW X6, the Mercedes-Benz GLE, the defunct Acura ZDX and even the Range Rover Evoque, the Infiniti is a bit of a category-buster when it comes to classification. It’s meant to have both the high-riding feel of an SUV and the tight handling and performance of a sport sedan, plus a bit of SUV utility thrown in — but not too much. Cargo room for the QX70 is listed at 24.8 cubic feet behind the backseat, expandable to a more respectable 62.0 cubic feet with the rear seats folded. The X6’s marginal utility is comparable, totaling 26.6 cubic feet in the back, expandable to 59.7 cubic feet. The Macan is smaller — more of a compact than a midsize — and its cargo space is sized accordingly: 17.7 cubic feet, expandable to 53.0 cubic feet. The F-Pace is more traditionally sized, with a cargo area of 23.0 cubic feet that’s expandable to 61.5 cubic feet.\nSafety\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has subjected the Infiniti QX70 to only two of its five crashworthiness tests, rating it good in both the moderate overlap front test and the head restraints and seats test. It has not been rated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. See results here.\n\nMy test car featured a number of options to bring the QX70’s electronic safety content fully up to date. The Technology Package includes full-speed intelligent cruise control with automatic stop and go, lane departure warning and prevention, forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, adaptive front auto-leveling headlights, rain-sensing windshield wipers and more. IIHS rated the QX70’s front crash prevention advanced — the middle rating between basic and superior — for reducing a high-speed impact by 5 mph (a 2-mph decrease in low-speed testing contributed zero points).\n\nThe Premium Package includes an Around View Monitor. It’s more than a backup camera; it provides a top-down, 360-degree view around the whole car. See all the QX70’s standard and optional features here.\nValue in Its Class\nThe QX70’s price has kept pace with the market, starting at $46,845 with rear-wheel drive and $48,295 with all-wheel drive. Start adding options like the Technology Package, Premium Package or Sport Package, plus individual accessories like illuminated sill plates and a cargo net, and you’ll arrive at my test car’s cringe-worthy $59,630 sticker price. That’s a lot of coin for a vehicle that feels this out of date.\n\nSince the QX70 first appeared, a bunch of other automakers — particularly German brands — have tried similar concepts: SUVs they describe as “coupes.” The BMW X6 is a good match for the QX70 on everything except price, as the Bimmer is considerably pricier. It also offers an optional V-8 engine and even an M performance model. The Mercedes-Benz GLE Coupe is a similar idea, but as of now it’s not offered as anything other than a high-powered AMG that’s a lot more expensive than the Infiniti.\n\nFrom the British, Land Rover’s Evoque is a bit small to compete with the QX70 and the Range Rover Sport is a bit too pricey, but the new Jaguar F-Pace is quite competitive with the QX70. It features a 340-hp V-6 and style that doesn’t look all that different from the QX70 on the outside. Another German alternative is the slightly smaller Porsche Macan, which lines up well price-wise, offers a variety of powertrains and is more in keeping with the Infiniti’s sporting mission.

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review of the 2016 Infiniti QX70 was written in September 2016, but little has changed for 2017. To see what’s new, click here, or to see a side-by-side comparison of the two model years, click here.\n\nWhen Infiniti launched the QX70 back in 2003 as the FX35/FX45, the brand referred to it as a “bionic cheetah.” Crossovers were still an unproven idea then, and making one off the company’s rear-wheel-drive performance platform was a bit odd; it was the same chassis that formed the basis of the sporty G35 sport sedan and coupe and the new Nissan 350Z sports car. \n\nThat platform continues to form the basis of the QX70, now on its third refresh but featuring the same roofline and style as when it debuted nearly 13 years ago. It received its only major update in 2009, then got a mild facelift in 2011 to bring some new front and rear styling and minor interior tweaks to the party (compare the 2015 and 2016 models here). Suffice it to say, the QX70 is old. But does its combination of speed, style and handling prowess keep it competitive with newer members of this unusual class, such as the BMW X6, Jaguar F-Pace and Porsche Macan?\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nThe “bionic cheetah” tag was created by Infiniti to try to describe what people were looking at when the original FX was introduced, and you can see where they were going with it. The shape is still sleek, low and muscular, with impossibly big wheels and tires filling out massive wheel wells. The front end’s feline look is notable, as are the muscular haunches and ready-to-spring look of the body. The styling is aging well, and Infiniti’s addition of a new Sport Package that adds dark wheels, a dark grille and blacked-out trim helps keep it fresh and interesting. That styling doesn’t help when you’re trying to use the QX70 as an SUV, however, as the low roofline makes getting in and out a contortion act and compromises cargo room.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nDynamically, the QX70 is pretty good despite its age. The car’s performance is one area in which Infiniti dialed in the settings quite well early on; from the powerful 325-horsepower, 3.7-liter V-6 to the seven-speed automatic transmission that shunts power to all four wheels, the QX70 is not lacking for grunt. Acceleration comes on strong and smooth with the naturally aspirated V-6, accompanied by an excellent exhaust note; Infiniti’s parent brand, Nissan, has always done a great job with the VQ-series V-6 engines, and this one is no exception. \n\nSteering feel is also excellent, with a firm effort and rewarding feedback. The suspension is unsettled by the optional, enormous and undoubtedly heavy 21-inch wheels; it works hard to try and keep calm and order inside the passenger cabin, which it does with mixed results. Smooth pavement is pleasant, but rough asphalt and potholes generate some harsh jolts. The brakes operate with a firm bite and progressive feel. The whole experience feels solid and planted, making the QX70 remarkably fun to drive. That sensation of heft is not surprising given the QX70’s considerable 4,300-pound curb weight. The BMW X6 is portlier still, but the Jaguar and Porsche are both several hundred pounds lighter. \n\nFuel economy suffers due to this weight disadvantage and the free-breathing nature of the 3.7-liter engine. The QX70 is rated a rather unfortunate 16/22/18 mpg city/highway/combined by the EPA, and my week of testing netted an unimpressive 16.3 mpg combined. Competing vehicles offer comparable six-cylinder engines that deliver comparable fuel economy, but they’re also available with a larger variety of powertrains. The X6’s 3.0-liter, turbocharged inline-six-cylinder engine is rated 18/24/20 mpg, while the Jaguar F-Pace’s 3.0-liter, supercharged V-6 is rated 18/23/20 mpg (both have eight-speed automatic transmissions). The Porsche Macan’s base engine for 2017 is a 2.0-liter, turbocharged four-cylinder rated 20/25/22 mpg but offering much less horsepower than the QX70.\n\nInterior\n\nIt’s inside the QX70 that the SUV’s age becomes immediately apparent. The shapes, materials, gauges, buttons — even the seating position feels outdated. The seats in my Sport Package-equipped model came with contrasting piping in the leather, which serves only to solidify the outdated interior theme. The seating position is awkward; it’s like Infiniti took a Q50 sedan and raised the seat 4 inches while keeping all the controls low. You feel like you’re sitting on the QX70, not in it. \n\nIt’s easy to bang your head on the sloping A-pillar when getting in and out because of the combination of high seat and low roofline. Outward visibility also suffers from this high seating position, both to the front and rear. The backseat isn’t much better, with a high bench and cramped legroom. Compared with the much more modern packaging and designs of the X6, F-Pace and even the slightly smaller Macan, the Infiniti’s older cabin styling really makes it feel out of place.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nA big part of the QX70’s dated feeling comes from its interior electronics. The multimedia system in particular is old and still looks like it has for multiple generations — well off the state-of-the-art systems seen in competing vehicles. This despite the fact that my test vehicle came loaded with every conceivable option, including navigation with live traffic and weather updates, a powered tilt and telescoping steering wheel, heated and cooled front memory seats with driver-side easy exit assist, tilt-with-reverse side mirrors and more.\n\nCargo & Storage\n\nAs an SUV, the QX70 doesn’t really work that well. Like the BMW X6, the Mercedes-Benz GLE, the defunct Acura ZDX and even the Range Rover Evoque, the Infiniti is a bit of a category-buster when it comes to classification. It’s meant to have both the high-riding feel of an SUV and the tight handling and performance of a sport sedan, plus a bit of SUV utility thrown in — but not too much. Cargo room for the QX70 is listed at 24.8 cubic feet behind the backseat, expandable to a more respectable 62.0 cubic feet with the rear seats folded. The X6’s marginal utility is comparable, totaling 26.6 cubic feet in the back, expandable to 59.7 cubic feet. The Macan is smaller — more of a compact than a midsize — and its cargo space is sized accordingly: 17.7 cubic feet, expandable to 53.0 cubic feet. The F-Pace is more traditionally sized, with a cargo area of 23.0 cubic feet that’s expandable to 61.5 cubic feet.\n\nSafety\n\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has subjected the Infiniti QX70 to only two of its five crashworthiness tests, rating it good in both the moderate overlap front test and the head restraints and seats test. It has not been rated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. See results here. \n\nMy test car featured a number of options to bring the QX70’s electronic safety content fully up to date. The Technology Package includes full-speed intelligent cruise control with automatic stop and go, lane departure warning and prevention, forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, adaptive front auto-leveling headlights, rain-sensing windshield wipers and more. IIHS rated the QX70’s front crash prevention advanced — the middle rating between basic and superior — for reducing a high-speed impact by 5 mph (a 2-mph decrease in low-speed testing contributed zero points). \n\nThe Premium Package includes an Around View Monitor. It’s more than a backup camera; it provides a top-down, 360-degree view around the whole car. See all the QX70’s standard and optional features here.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nThe QX70’s price has kept pace with the market, starting at $46,845 with rear-wheel drive and $48,295 with all-wheel drive. Start adding options like the Technology Package, Premium Package or Sport Package, plus individual accessories like illuminated sill plates and a cargo net, and you’ll arrive at my test car’s cringe-worthy $59,630 sticker price. That’s a lot of coin for a vehicle that feels this out of date. \n\nSince the QX70 first appeared, a bunch of other automakers — particularly German brands — have tried similar concepts: SUVs they describe as “coupes.” The BMW X6 is a good match for the QX70 on everything except price, as the Bimmer is considerably pricier. It also offers an optional V-8 engine and even an M performance model. The Mercedes-Benz GLE Coupe is a similar idea, but as of now it’s not offered as anything other than a high-powered AMG that’s a lot more expensive than the Infiniti. \n\nFrom the British, Land Rover’s Evoque is a bit small to compete with the QX70 and the Range Rover Sport is a bit too pricey, but the new Jaguar F-Pace is quite competitive with the QX70. It features a 340-hp V-6 and style that doesn’t look all that different from the QX70 on the outside. Another German alternative is the slightly smaller Porsche Macan, which lines up well price-wise, offers a variety of powertrains and is more in keeping with the Infiniti’s sporting mission.

      "expert_review": "I was excited when the 2015 Infiniti QX70 appeared in my driveway. Its low, swoopy lines and mean-looking, black 21-inch wheels told me up front that this wasn’t going to be just another boring family car.\n\nWhile the QX70 looks great, feels sexy and elicits plenty of compliments, after the novelty wore off, I found myself wanting out because of its harsh ride.\n\nFor 2015, the five-seat QX70 comes in two trims, the QX70 and the QX70 AWD (which I drove), both equipped with a 3.7-liter V-6 engine. The 5.0-liter V-8 has been discontinued. Several packages are available to customize the QX70. My test car was kitted out with the Technology, Premium and Sport packages. A Deluxe Touring Package is also available. Compare the differences between the 2015 and 2014 versions here.\n\nIf the QX70 doesn’t quite quench your thirst, you may want to look into other luxury-compact performance-oriented SUVs, like the BMW X3 or the Porsche Macan. If you’re looking for something more family-oriented and less sport-focused, consider Infiniti’s own QX60, a larger but more affordable model with seating for seven. Compare them side-by-side here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThere’s no mistaking the Infiniti QX70 out on the road — though you might mistake its name, given Infiniti bafflingly renamed its entire product lineup a year ago. The QX70 is the new incarnation of the old FX, and it’s still just as recognizable.\n\nMy test car came with the optional Sport Package ($3,550), which instantly sets it apart from versions without, adding a dark-finish front grille and wheels. It looks pretty malicious driving down the road, as if it’s getting ready to chew up and spit out your adorably functional little urban family-hauler.\n\nWhile the QX70’s low stance makes stepping in and out quite easy, the swooping roofline cuts off quite a bit of headroom for rear passengers, generally requiring a slight ducking motion to get in.\n\nHow It Drives\nMy test QX70 felt like it was trying too hard to assert its sportiness through both a tight suspension and its exhaust note. The end result comes off as slightly unrefined, harsh on the senses and fatigue-inducing after relatively short stints in the car. Acceleration felt oddly delayed and underpowered, and the brakes were grabby at low speeds.\n\nIn my experience, while many drivers may think they want something sporty (an ode to their preschool, Big Wheels racing days in the driveway), what many of them actually want is something that gives the appearance of being sporty — and with the option of feeling sporty from time to time in the driver’s seat — yet with a Comfort mode to soothe stress after a long day’s work. The QX70 lacks the latter. The standard 18-inch wheels may provide a softer ride than the Sport Package’s 21s, but our experience with the QX70 (and the FX before it) suggests even that version would still be among the firmest-riding models on the road.\n\nThe QX70 AWD’s 325-horsepower, 3.7-liter V-6 engine gets an EPA-estimated 16/22/18 mpg city/highway/combined. With rear-wheel drive, it’s rated 17/24/19 mpg. Though larger, the QX60’s mileage estimates are as high as 20/26/22 mpg with front-wheel drive.\n\nInterior\nThe QX70’s aggressive exterior design comes at the cost of backseat space — not a problem if you rarely transport additional passengers, but for those of us with a gaggle of kids, it’s really not that functional. The sloping rear roofline makes for tight headroom and a claustrophobic feel for anyone over 5 feet tall. The 34.6 inches of backseat legroom was a tight squeeze for my three girls (ages 9, 11 and 14). As a comparison, the BMW X3 has 36.8 inches of legroom in the backseat.\n\nStorage inside the QX70 is limited to the basics: narrow in-door pockets up front (none in the back), two cupholders between the driver and front passenger, two cupholders and a storage bin in the fold-down armrest in the backseat, a pocket on the back of each of the front seats, and your standard small center console and glove box.\n\nThe fold-down armrest in the backseat proved difficult for kids to fold down on their own. Rather than simply pulling it down singlehandedly, a release tab needed to be pulled and held out with one hand while the armrest was pulled down with the other hand, much like trying to pat your head and rub your stomach at the same time.\n\nCombined with the black leather interior of my test car and its dark roof-liner, the contrast purple stitching was an absolute standout. My teenage daughter, whose bedroom is painted a shade of purple, pointed it out within her first few seconds inside the car, and everyone else in the family then admired it. It manages to be subtle, then pops and wows when the sun hits it just right.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe biggest ergonomic annoyance in the QX70 hits you right up front, as you go to adjust the side mirrors before even driving. To do so, you have to lean forward to reach the controls below and to the left of the steering wheel, make a few adjustments, then sit back in your seat and hope you got it right. Which, of course, you didn’t. Then you lean forward again, guesstimate how much more it needs to be adjusted, then sit back and hope that this time you got it right. Then rinse and repeat with the other side. This clearly needs to be rethought.\n\nThe Bluetooth system made it quick and easy to pair phones, and my husband and I both commented on how easy it was to turn off the entire navigation screen to preserve our night vision by pressing and holding the day/night button, rather than fiddling through menu screens like on other vehicles.\n\nI also appreciated that the seat heat and optional ventilation have a dedicated dial. In high-altitude Colorado temperature swings, I find I use either the seat heat or ventilation on almost every drive. Rather than having to press through multiple touch-screen menus just to find the seat climate controls, I could quickly adjust the setting to booty bliss. When switched to full-speed cooling, the fans were intrusively loud, however, and need to be tamed down a bit.\n\nCargo & Storage\nWith backseat legroom at a premium in the QX70 — and its sloping rear lines looking as if they would limit cargo capacity — I was expecting a much smaller cargo space. However, there was 24.8 cubic feet of storage space behind the backseat, enough to easily fit four overstuffed kitchen trash bags full of clothes from my three daughters’ annual before-school closet clean-out, along with a large plastic contractor bag full of books. Impressive. I’m not sure this would have been possible in the BMW X3’s 19.4 cubic feet of cargo space, and it definitely wouldn’t have been in the Porsche Macan, which has only 17.7 cubic feet of cargo space.\n\nIf even more space is needed, levers in the cargo area easily release the rear seats to fold them flat, increasing cargo capacity to 62 cubic feet. A power liftgate makes access to the cargo area easy. For comparison, because of its third row of seats, the QX60 has only 15.8 cubic feet to start out with, but a full 76.5 with both rear rows folded.\n\nSafety\nCrash tests have not been conducted on the 2015 QX70, although according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, 2014 results will apply to the 2015. The 2014 Infiniti QX70 received the Institute’s highest rating of good (on a scale of good, acceptable, marginal and poor) in both the moderate-overlap front crash test as well as the head restraint and rear-impact seat-protection test.\n\nThe lane departure warning system in the QX70’s Technology Package has an audible beep to let you know when you appear to be crossing a lane marker unintentionally. The abundance of beeps in the QX70, from the lane departure warning as well as the front and rear parking sensors, quickly renders all of them ineffective. It’s like me constantly barking at my daughter to stop hoarding Izze soda bottles in her bedroom (apparently she plans to paint them and make a wind chime?). I’m sure she’d like to simply switch me off the way I often ended up shutting down the QX70’s lane departure warning system.\n\nIf you don’t respond to the beep, the QX70 will gently nudge you back into your lane. Much of the high-end automotive world has evolved to a more effective, tactile lane departure alert via either a vibrating seat or auto steering correct, finding that drivers often don’t like the audible tone alerting everyone in the car every time they veer over a lane. Infiniti could do without the beep.\n\nEarly on, Infiniti was on the cutting edge of external cameras in its cars, in particular with its innovative Around View Monitor. However, compared with others out there today that have very large, clear images, the camera display in the QX70 can be split between a default backup fish-eye view and the optional Around View, making each image too small and grainy to see and register clearly. You can use the touch-screen to toggle to a single image or other views, but who wants to fuss with that when you’re just trying to avoid a rogue toddler escaping his parents’ grasp in the grocery store parking lot?\n\nMy biggest surprise in my $59K-plus test car was a lack of blind spot monitors. There’s quite a drastic blind spot in the QX70 due to its small, sloping side rear windows. If Dodge can offer them in an under-$20K Dart, they should most definitely be standard in a luxury SUV at this price.\n\nFor families installing child-safety seats in the QX70, there are two sets of Latch connectors in the backseat’s outboard seating positions. The Latch anchors are concealed behind slits in the seat bight. A third top-tether anchor is behind the middle seat, so a forward-facing child seat can be installed in the middle using the seat belt and top tether. The seat belt buckles are on flimsy nylon bases, making them difficult for younger, booster-seat-sized children to buckle independently with their limited fine motor skills.\n\nSee all the standard safety features listed here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nSince the Infiniti QX70’s predecessor, the FX, was introduced in the 2003 model year, it’s definitely kept up its end of the style bargain by nipping and tucking here and there, enhancing its most standout and unique design features. It’s also stayed true to its performance-oriented driving feel. However, since then, other compact luxury SUVs have started to encroach upon its territory and it may no longer be top dog.\n\nWith similar vehicles offering the option to toggle between Comfort and Sport modes, more up-to-date technologies — such as blind spot monitoring — and niceties like panoramic roofs, the QX70’s value proposition is starting to slip.\n\nemail",
