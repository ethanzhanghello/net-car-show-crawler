      "expert_review": "It was a hot, humid day. Traffic on the Kennedy Expressway was bumper to bumper in the evening rush hour. We reached for the knob to adjust the air conditioner downward a couple of degrees when the horizon dipped a foot to theleft.\n\nThe rear wheel of the Ford we were test-driving chose that moment to attempt an entrance into the express lanes while the rest of the car was traveling in the locals.\n\nThen there was the time we took a shortcut home along some seldom-traveled country roads when the fan belt broke, the battery went dead and not a soul was in sight as the clock struck 10 p.m. and the thermometer touched 10 degrees below.\n\nAnd we can’t forget the time we were tooling along in a Chrysler when the back of the Corinthian leather seat expired, and we found ourself cursing Mr. Montalban from the prone position at 55 miles per hour.\n\nNeedless to say, some vehicles run better than others, and you sometimes wish the manufacturer would forget it lent you the car. (American Motors Corp.once did, and it wasn’t until we called and noted that we had just had the oilchanged that the company came to retrieve the car.)\n\nOther times, even before the tow truck arrives, you’re ready to call the manufacturer and issue your surrender.\n\nThen there are times when you find yourself in a car in which nothing fallsoff, nothing stops working, nothing leaves you stranded-but nothing really impresses you, either.\n\nSuch was the case when we got our hands on the new Infiniti G20 sedan. The new 1993 1/2-or, as Infiniti calls it, the 1993.5-G20 solves some of the problems of the old model.\n\nThat original G20 felt cramped, while the new one feels spacious although the dimensions haven’t changed; the original was low-tech, while the new one is high-tech with driver- and passenger-side air bags plus anti-lock brakes; the original was rather dull in appearance, while the new one looks a bit moreappealing, though you might be hard-pressed to put your key in the lock of theright car if you’re parked alongside a Civic or Corolla sedan.\n\nSo what’s the gripe?\n\nThe 1993.5 is dull.\n\nThe 2-liter, 140-horsepower, 4-cylinder engine teamed with a 5-speed manualseemed anemic despite exhaust sound effects meant to leave you with the perception that you are reaching the red line on the tach when you still are below the legal speed limit. The G20 with 5-speed delivers 24 miles per galloncity/32 m.p.g. highway.\n\nThe problem we had with the G20, Infiniti’s lowest-cost entry-level car, isthat the midlevel Infiniti J30 sedan has spoiled us. The J30 has set such a high standard for other Infinitis that the G20 pales in comparison, despite being about $15,000 cheaper.\n\nThe midsize G20 is loaded with goodies, but we couldn’t put our finger on one feature that made it stand out in the crowd. Bumpers and side moldings arebody-colored, rear-seat headrests are adjustable. The air conditioning doesn’tha ve ozone-killing chlorofluorocarbons. All-season tires are standard. There’sa cargo net in the trunk, and wheels are a decorative cast alloy.\n\nThere also are illuminated vanity mirrors, power and heated dual sideview mirrors, tinted glass, rear-window defroster, carpeted floor mats, AM stereo/FM stereo radio, tilt steering, power antenna, power windows, power door locks, cruise control, power steering, four-wheel independent suspension with front and rear stabilizer bars, four-wheel power disc brakes with ABS, driver- and passenger-side air bags and remote trunk and fuel-filler door release to name the more popular standard equipment.\n\nBasically it’s a functional sedan that blends in with the crowd. What makesthe car stand out is the price tag, a hefty $20,600 base price before options.\n\nOur test car added a leather package for $2,000 that included leather interior appointments along with a leather console armrest, power seats, powersunroof and keyless remote ntry. With a $450 freight charge, the car stickered at $23,050.\n\nBuick, in comparison, offers a special-edition full-size LeSabre for about $19,000, a special-edition midsize Regal for about $18,000 and a special-edition midsize Century for about $15,000. Pay $23,050 for a name or $15,000 to $19,000 and keep the change?\n\nWhen you compare window stickers, it seems like all that whining by U.S. carmakers over Japanese competition and level playing fields and quotas and taxing imported cars as trucks may have been a bit unnecessary.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nInfiniti is Nissans luxury brand, and the front-drive G20 sedan is the entry-level model. The G20 shares some components with the Nissan Sentra, including its four-cylinder engine, and appears to have a short future in the United States.\n\nFor the 2002 model year, Infiniti will replace the G20 with what is expected to be a larger sedan with a six-cylinder engine and perhaps rear-wheel drive. Infiniti says the new model will have European styling and sports car-handling ability.\n\nExterior\nThe compact G20 is 177.5 inches long  about 3 inches longer than the Honda Civic sedan. The Touring model (G20t) is easily distinguished from the base model by its standard rear spoiler.\n\nInterior\nCloth upholstery is standard in the G20, and leather is optional. Infiniti says it has five-passenger capacity, but the rear seat lacks sufficient legroom for most adults to fit comfortably.\n\nStandard equipment includes air conditioning; a Bose sound system with cassette and CD players; power windows, locks and mirrors; remote keyless entry; and a theft-deterrent system.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine delivers 145 horsepower and teams with a four-speed automatic or five-speed manual transmission.\n\nStandard safety features include antilock brakes and side-impact airbags for the front seats.\n\nDriving Impressions\nFor about the same money as a four-cylinder G20, you can get a V-6 Honda Accord or Toyota Camry with stronger, smoother acceleration and a roomier interior. You wont get the Infiniti brand name, the more comprehensive warranty or the more attentive service, but the Accord and Camry will have higher resale values.\n\n \n\nReported by Rick Popely  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2001 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "In an era that finds the tenets of Alfred Sloan, former chieftan and architect of GM, fading at the company he founded, one finds them alive and well at other automakers.\n\nTake Infiniti, Nissan’s upscale division. Introduced in 1991, the G20 was designed as an entry-level vehicle for Nissan lovers working their way up the company food chain. Starting at just over $20K large ones, it was meant as an entry level or “near luxury” sedan. Of course, “near luxury” is one of those endearing marketing terms that in reality makes little sense, like “honest politician.”\n\nNissan shipped its G20 back overseas after 1996, leaving the freshly minted I30 as Infiniti’s entry level offering. That this Maxima with an attitude cost almost 30 large ones, didn’t seem to bother anyone until Infiniti’s sales slumped.\n\nSo now it’s 1999. Welcome back the G20.\n\nActually, this is a car known through the rest of the world as the Nissan Primera, which explains why some of the interior parts feel very Nissan-like. But all Inifiniti did was slap some freshly minted nameplates and some leather into this puppy to create their entry-level offering, meant to do battle against Audi A4s and the BMW 3-series.\n\nIt worked well last time. This time it seems a bit less convincing.\n\nThe styling is crisp, conservative and a bit too easy to lose in the mall parking lot. Opting for the up-level G20t yields fog lamps and a rear spoiler to the exterior furnishings along with lower profile tires. So, it looks upscale, as long as you don’t want to stand out.\n\nAlthough the looks are similar to the previous model, the car is larger inside. There’s more rear leg room, although at 177-inches long overall, it’s not exactly the wide-open spaces. But its comparable to its competition.\n\nMotivation comes from the same engine it had nine years ago, a double-overhead-cam 2-liter 16-valve 4-cylinder rated at the same horsepower, 140. While that wasn’t bad in 1991, it seems a bit underwhelming in 1999. This car has less ponies than a Nissan Altima or any of its competition. Not that it doesn’t get the job done. Power seems adequate, but with only 132 foot pounds of torque, don’t expect to be first off the line in the stoplight grand prix.\n\nLike any four-cylinder, there’s enough buzziness to remind you of how many cylinders are under the hood. but this is the same engine as in the Nissan Sentra SE so its fuel economy is quite good returning 24 mpg over the test drive.\n\nHandling is good for a front-driver, certainly there’s no torque steer here. But the car gives an athletic driving experience with a firm ride and rather quick steering. Distressingly, it also comes with a fair amount of body lean, although ultimate grip is good. Those expecting the sportiness of a Maxima will be disappointed.\n\nSome of that is due to Nissan using its multi-link rear beam axle, rather than an independent rear suspension. But this is pretty common in most of their cars.\n\nThe previous G2 0 seemed like an inexpensive BMW alternative; the new one, at least in the handling department, seems less so. Handling is good, just not as good as it was. Overall, it’s a smoothy. Just don’t expect gobs of power.\n\nTires are larger this time out — 15-inchers rather than 14-inchers. Four-wheel disc brakes with anti-lock are standard on all models. Braking was good, with the pedal being easy to modulate smoothly. A five-speed manual is standard; four-speed automatic is optional.\n\nThe driving position is good, as is visibility. There’s more leg room this year for the driver, although the broad-of-beam will find the seats narrow.\n\nEach passenger will find three-point belts, with front and side air-bags standard.\n\nTrunk room was quite good for the size of the car, with split-folding rear seats and a cargo net to help out with hauling.\n\nIf you’re thinking of opting for the base G20, keep in mind most of the features that would make this vehicle a “luxury” or “near-luxury`’ vehicle aren’t standard. No sunroof, fog lamps, leather, power sunroof, heated seats, air-filtration, automatic climate control, power driver’s seat or built-in garage-door opener. Those are optional above the $21,490 base price.\n\nThe keyless entry unlocks the doors, but doesn’t pop the trunk.\n\nKeep in mind that overall, this was a perfectly adequate compact, with decent handling, a great Bose sound system and a moderate base price. But when optioned, some will find its almost $25,000 price a questionable value.\n\nBut luxury marques are never about value; it’s about perceived value. One doesn’t need a fur coat when a cloth coat will keep one just as warm.
