      "expert_review": "Volvo’s XC60 is getting an update for the 2026 model year, but you’ll either need to be a fan of the brand or inside the mid-size SUV to notice. Like the larger XC90, the XC60 sports a modernized grille with a cross-hatch insert. New wheel designs and darkened taillights are the extent of the exterior changes.\n\nRelated: 2025 Volvo XC60 Unchanged, Starts at $48,345\n\nInside, however, is a new 11.2-inch touchscreen that overflows the space occupied by its predecessor, standing a couple of inches above the plane of the dashboard. Running Volvo’s next-generation infotainment software, the display features quicker responses and Google Built-In. The brand says the XC60’s fabrics and interior trim materials are new, as well — even the speaker mesh on the available Bowers & Wilkins audio system is tweaked — but the interior design is otherwise unchanged.\n\nPowertrain Specs and MPG\n\nUnder the hood, things remain the same for the 2026 XC60. The base B5 version packs a mild-hybrid turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine making 247 horsepower and 266 pounds-feet of torque. T8 badging denotes a plug-in hybrid XC60, which supplements the turbo four’s output with a burly electric motor and an 18.8-kilowatt-hour battery pack for a combined 455 hp and 523 pounds-feet; it gets 36 miles of electric-only range. An eight-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive are standard with both powertrains.\n\nThe B5 returns an EPA-estimated 23/30/26 mpg city/highway/combined, and the plug-in T8 is rated at 28 mpg combined with the gas engine pitching in.\n\nWhen Will the 2026 Volvo XC60 Be Available?\n\nThe 2026 Volvo XC60 will be available later this year. Pricing details will be released closer to the start of sales, but the base B5 variant will likely start around $50,000 and the T8 at about $60,000.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2022 Volvo XC60 Recharge?\nWhich Cars Are Made Outside the U.S.?\nIIHS: Backseat-Passenger Safety Lacking in Some Mid-Size SUVs\nResearch the Volvo XC60\nFind Your Next Car\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Volvo XC60?\n\nThe Volvo XC60 is a five-seat luxury SUV that’s notable for its comfortable ride, handsome cabin layout and impressive lineup of safety features. A 247-horsepower, turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine coupled with a 48-volt mild-hybrid system is standard; it’s paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive. The XC60 Recharge plug-in hybrid adds two electric motors to the 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, and it’s good for an eye-opening 455 hp and an EPA-estimated 36 miles of electric-only driving range. The XC60’s rivals include the Acura RDX, Audi Q5, BMW X3, Lincoln Corsair and Mercedes-Benz GLC.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Volvo XC60?\n\nThe XC60 is largely unchanged for 2025. The top trim is now called Ultra instead of Ultimate, and the plug-in hybrid drops “Recharge” from its name.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Volvo XC60 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n9-inch touchscreen\nGoogle-based navigation\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\n10-speaker audio system\nCloth upholstery\n12-inch digital gauge cluster\nHeated front seats\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nRain-sensing wipers\nLane-centering steering\nLane departure warning\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nLeather seating surfaces\nSurround-view parking camera\nAdaptive cruise control\nPower liftgate\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated rear seats\nQuad-zone climate control\nHead-up display\n14-speaker Harman Kardon audio system\n15-speaker Bowers & Wilkins audio system\nHeated steering wheel\nShould I Buy the 2025 Volvo XC60?\n\nThe Volvo XC60 remains a great choice for SUV shoppers who value a comfortable ride, a classy interior, and a long lineup of standard and optional active safety features. The ride gets much firmer if you opt for the larger alloy wheels, however, and the price of the plug-in hybrid model gets steep in higher trims.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Volvo XC60?\nThe 2024 Volvo XC60 is a five-seat luxury compact SUV that’s notable for its comfortable ride, handsome cabin layout and impressive lineup of safety features. A 247-horsepower, turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine coupled with a 48-volt mild-hybrid system is standard, paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive. The XC60 Recharge plug-in hybrid adds two electric motors to the 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, and it’s good for an eye-opening 455 hp and an EPA-estimated 35 miles of electric-only driving range. The XC60’s rivals include the Acura RDX, Audi Q5, BMW X3, Lincoln Corsair and Mercedes-Benz GLC.\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Volvo XC60?\nVolvo streamlined the lineup for 2024, eliminating the 295-hp turbo- and supercharged engine and discontinuing front-wheel drive. Vapour Grey Metallic paint replaces 2023’s Black Stone, and metallic paint is now available at no extra charge on all trims. Last year’s optional Dark Theme is now standard, and a new Black Edition appearance package is available on the Ultimate trim. A power liftgate is newly available on all trims, and an air purifier is included on Plus and Ultimate trims. Massaging front seats are now available on the Ultimate trim.\nWhat Features in the 2024 Volvo XC60 Are Most Important?\nStandard features include:\n\n9-inch touchscreen\nGoogle-based navigation\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\n10-speaker audio system\nCloth upholstery\n12-inch digital gauge cluster\nHeated front seats\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nRain-sensing wipers\nLane departure steering assist\nLane departure warning\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nLeather seating surfaces\n360-degree camera system\nAdaptive cruise control\nPower liftgate\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated rear seats\nQuad-zone climate control\nHead-up display\n14-speaker Harman Kardon audio system\n15-speaker Bowers & Wilkins audio system\nHeated steering wheel\n\nShould I Buy the 2024 Volvo XC60?\nThe Volvo XC60 remains a great choice for SUV shoppers who value a comfortable ride, a classy interior, and a long lineup of standard and optional active-safety features. The ride gets much firmer if you opt for the larger alloy wheels, however, and the price of PHEV models gets steep with higher trims.",

      "expert_review": "CARS.COM — You know from our 2018 Volvo XC60 First Drive that the redesigned compact luxury SUV packs much of the XC90’s excellence in a package that’s tidier and more affordable — by 10.3 inches and $5,400, to be exact — but that report covered pricier T6 and T8 variants of the SUV, not the entry-level T5 that accounts for nearly half the new examples on Cars.com. We took to Michigan to drive a lightly optioned T5 Momentum (at $44,690, just $2,195 more than the XC60’s base price) to see if it bolsters the XC60’s case.\n\nRelated: 2018 Volvo XC60 Video Review\n\nIt does, indeed. The T5 is no base-model letdown, but rather a well-appointed trim level that includes most of what makes the XC60 appealing and unique in its class.\n\nEnough Power\n\nThe T5’s turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder (250 horsepower, 258 pounds-feet of torque) has strong power off the line that builds smoothly as revs climb. With standard all-wheel drive (AWD), it hits 60 mph in a Volvo-estimated 6.4 seconds, which falls on the leisurely side of manufacturer-estimated times for the XC60’s base-engine rivals. Indeed, the T5 lacks the gratifying torque plateau of an Audi Q5, and some may wish Volvo silenced its whooshing turbos at higher revs. But we’ll take the SUV’s relative absence of accelerator lag, which too many competitors (the Q5 included) suffer in spades.\n\nWe appreciate the drivetrain’s behavior especially because this vehicle lacked the selectable drive modes of other versions we’ve tested. (If you want the feature, it comes in the $2,200 Convenience Package along with the much more desirable Pilot Assist Semi Autonomous Drive System, adaptive cruise control, remotely folding backseat head restraints, a power liftgate and more.) If the accelerator were lazy or the transmission unresponsive, we’d have no relief in the form of a Dynamic mode. Truth be told, the modes haven’t been a strength in the T6 vehicles, so no harm done here.\n\nTo that end, the optional air springs we’ve tested in other Volvo XC60s ensure ride comfort but not body control — we’ve observed excessive lateral movement over uneven pavement in air-spring variants. The base architecture in this T5, which mixes front coil springs and a rear transverse leaf spring, seems no more controlled. It’s a degree worse in terms of shock absorption, though it stops well short of the abject firmness we experienced in the one XC90 without air springs we once tested, also a T5. Ride quality is not a liability for the XC60, but it’s far from a strength.\n\nSame Interior\n\nExterior styling is subjective, but there’s no question that the XC60 blends a sharp, mini-XC90 cabin with good materials quality. The T5 doesn’t drop the ball on materials or features: Handsome graining and soft-touch surfaces still extend all the way down the doors in both rows. The standard leather feels average-quality, but it beats the hell out of the rubbery texture of any leatherette (vinyl), which most of Volvo’s competitors employ in base trims. The only option playing a role in this T5’s interior was the Linear Lime inlay, a $500 wood trim upgrade replacing the standard Iron Ore Aluminum inlay. This trim that runs the width of the dashboard is the primary distinction between an XC60’s interior and an XC90’s.\n\nA panoramic moonroof, dual power seats, Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and a host of safety technologies — lane departure steering, forward collision warning and automatic emergency braking — are also all standard. Impressive.\n\nWe’re less wild about the automaker’s 9-inch vertical touchscreen, a staple in its latest cars. The impressive size and top-notch graphics can’t overcome a lack of physical controls around it, which wore on us over a year of XC90 ownership. The setup relegates stereo tuning and climate controls, including the heated seats, to on-screen submenus. This is a minor inconvenience most of the time, but the system is slow to start up when you get in the car, leaving you waiting for seat heat on a cold morning. Or the navigation system. Or really anything else you’d want to do, because practically nothing is controlled any other way in new Volvos.\n\nShould You Buy It?\n\nWe may be damning with faint praise — or perhaps praising through faint damnation — to point out that the affordably equipped T5’s missing features aren’t truly missed because they aren’t so well-executed in the vehicles that have them. Driving modes? Not needed. Air springs? Softer but not exceptional. What you do get in a $44,690 Volvo XC60 T5 is the handsome styling, the comfortable and stylish high-quality interior, the responsive drivetrain with all-wheel drive (AWD), and a decent number of features. Our vehicle included the Vision Package ($1,100) with blind spot warning, cross-traffic alert, autonomous parking assist, and auto-dimming mirrors with retractable side ones. It also had optional $595 metallic paint. If you want more, Volvo provides a healthy assortment of options and reasonably grouped packages to suit you even if you don’t step up to a higher trim level like the R-Design or Inscription.\n\nYou should definitely try out a modestly equipped AWD Volvo XC60 with the more affordable drivetrain and base suspension unless you live in an area with consistently bad pavement. Unlike the base XC90, which was too firm for our tastes, the XC60 is a viable choice in its simplest form.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The 2020 Volvo XC60 compact luxury SUV sees a bunch of small tweaks for the new model year, as Volvo tends to do with each of its models lately, but what is worthy of our attention is the one big change for 2020: the new Polestar Engineered trim level, which comes along with a new powertrain option for the XC60, a plug-in hybrid.\n\nRelated: Volvo Adds Polestar Punch to 2020 V60, XC60\n\nOur review of the redesigned 2018 Volvo XC60, which kicked off the current generation, was effusive in its praise. Our verdict was simply that “the 2018 Volvo XC60 is a new benchmark for small luxury SUVs.” And then it lapped the field at our 2018 Luxury Compact SUV Challenge, winning by 53 points, a margin that nearly equaled the gap between the second- and fifth-place finishers in the same contest.\n\nThis is our first time revisiting the XC60 since then, and I’m happy to report that the new variant keeps the things that we liked so much about its kin: fantastic interior appointments, lots of storage spaces and the oozing of style. What’s interesting, however, is that the new trim level also has the potential to address several of the XC60’s few weaknesses in the areas of handling and powertrain refinement. To see if Volvo succeeded, I headed to Banff, in Alberta, Canada, to drive the XC60 both on-road and on an airstrip autocross course to see if this purportedly performance-oriented version could smooth out those final rough patches. (Per our ethics policy, Cars.com pays for its own airfare and lodging at such automaker-sponsored events.\n\nWhat Is Polestar Engineered?\n\nPolestar was once to be Volvo’s performance division (think M for BMW or AMG for Mercedes-Benz), but it was recently spun off into its own company to produce electric performance vehicles. It seem, however, that the folks over there still get their hands dirty on Volvo’s petroleum-burning offerings, starting with the S60 and now the XC60 and V60 as well for 2020.\n\nVolvo’s philosophical shift a few years ago means that much of the lineup shares the same architecture and powertrains. No exception here, as both the S60 and XC60 Polestar Engineered vehicles use the T8 plug-in hybrid powertrain that combines a turbocharged and supercharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine with an electric motor mounted to the rear axle, plus a battery pack that can be charged by plugging it in. Total system output tops out at 415 horsepower and 494 pounds-feet of torque. Both vehicles also get a shared set of performance upgrades, including more powerful brakes, an Ohlins adjustable suspension and an added front strut bar for more stiffness.\n\nThe way to tell it’s a Polestar Engineered model is also shared between the sedan and SUV: Bright yellow brake calipers, which match the yellow seat belts and other yellow accents found throughout the cabin (even the speaker cones in the doors are yellow). A pair of subtle white badges and a glossy grille surround complete the look, but those are details only those with eagle eyes will spot.\n\nWith all of the shared equipment, I expected my conclusions about the two vehicles to be similar. The S60 T8 Polestar Engineered didn’t really offer enough performance to tickle my fancy. That model, while sporty, didn’t turn the S60 into a full-on sports sedan, and I had an inkling the same thing would be true about the XC60, as well.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThe T8’s layering of electric power atop an already robust engine does help make the XC60’s powertrain feel more confident. Acceleration is seamless; there weren’t any weird transitions between electric and gas power either on the road or on the autocross. But I have to say that I was expecting a bit more out of the XC60 T8 Polestar Engineered given its power figures and the instant torque available from the electric motor. It’s plenty of power for day-to-day use, but much like in the S60, it falls short of offering enough impetus to feel like a performance vehicle, especially when it comes to initial burst, where you really want the electric motor to shine more.\n\nI should note that I was in one of the later groups to do the autocross and drive the XC60 on the street, so by the time I got into the vehicle, the battery was drained pretty low. According to Volvo, maximum powertrain output is achieved only when the battery is at full capacity, so it could be the case that the XC60 feels more alive on a full charge, but with an EPA-rated electric-only range of 18 miles, an owner won’t have a full battery for long, either.\n\nThe XC60 also has a bit of trouble putting power down cleanly from a standing start — stomp on it and you feel a bit of vibration through the steering wheel as the traction control attempts to combat torque steer. It wobbles to the left and right a bit and feels like it’s cutting power at times. You get up to speed pretty quickly, but this happened multiple times in my testing, so it didn’t feel like a matter of the road surface.\n\nOn the plus side, the XC60’s suspension is great. Being a taller vehicle, it gets more of a pass on body roll compared with its sedan counterpart, and I was impressed by how well the XC60 rode on the street (even with large 22-inch wheels) as well as how it mitigated body roll on the airstrip, where I performed both a slalom run and a version of the moose test (hard braking at 50 mph with a quick jump to the left, then back to the right). Toward the end of the slalom, the XC60 started to sway a bit more, but for an SUV it was quite competent. It rides a bit firm, which makes it feel more athletic than the other variants of the XC60, but it does so without handing out the punishment you might expect in terms of ride quality. It’s very hard to toe that line, but Volvo has done well here.\n\n2020 Volvo XC60 | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\n\nIf you find that the ride isn’t quite to your liking, however, the suspension is also adjustable. In a weird twist, it doesn’t offer a typical adaptive suspension with computer control or remotely adjustable settings that you change through the XC60’s screens. Rather, each of the four shock absorbers are topped by golden dials that you can turn to set their firmness. The dials can be reached under the hood for the front wheels and in the rear wheel well for the rears, and there are 22 different settings for each. There are other performance cars with suspensions like this, but to change them usually requires jacking the car up and taking off various parts and wheels. On the XC60, you just turn the dials by hand, and it makes a difference in how stiffly the SUV rides — not that you’d want to put your XC60 on the track, but you could conceivably drive to a track with a comfortable setting, then quickly stiffen it way up when you get there. The XC60 that I drove to the airstrip was in a middle setting, but the XC60 I put through its paces on the runway dialed up the firmness. It’s noticeable.\n\nLastly, there was one area that I was extremely worried about: brakes. The S60 T8 Polestar Engineered’s set of Brembo brakes were abysmal, very twitchy and grabby, making it incredibly difficult to stop smoothly. The XC60 T8 Polestar Engineered actually gets different brakes made by Akebono, and the braking problems seem to have been worked out. I reported that the brakes I tested on a T8 version of the XC90 were also markedly improved for 2020, so it might involve some retuning of the T8 models across the board, but nevertheless, you can stop the XC60 without pitching occupants forward now.\n\n2020 Volvo XC60 | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\n\nIn fact, I’d go so far as to call the new brakes very good. Panic stops happened without any squirreling from the front or the rear, and hard braking actually feels more stable than hard acceleration. From pedal feel to ease of use, the braking experience has been entirely revamped for this vehicle, and I give Volvo credit for hearing the feedback on the S60 version and making sure the same thing was not true in the next variant.\n\nGood to Drive, But Something’s Still Missing\n\nThe 2020 XC60 T8 Polestar Engineered does a good job addressing some of the shortcomings that we have previously noted in the SUV, but it falls short of the mark of operating like a true performance vehicle. Think of the Polestar Engineered as a sharpened version of the XC60 that’s fun to drive along with all of the other positives that I noted about it above, but a quick look at the competition shows its shortcomings.\n\nAt its $72,045 starting price (all prices include destination charges), the XC60 sits right next to the BMW X3 M ($70,895) and Mercedes-AMG GLC63 ($74,745), and those two offer more under the hood. According to their respective manufacturers, the X3 M runs from zero-to-60 mph in 4.1 seconds and the Mercedes-AMG GLC63 does the same sprint in just 3.8 seconds, which is a world of difference off the line compared with the XC60’s estimated 4.9 seconds.\n\nIf true performance is your goal, you’d be better served by looking at like-priced alternatives that jam gigantic engines into small SUVs and ask you to hold on for dear life — and I must admit, that has some appeal to me. But what appealed to me about the XC60 T8 Polestar Engineered was its overall refinement: a solid suspension that doesn’t beat you up, confidence-inspiring brakes, that classy interior and understated, attractive styling. At a certain point on the road, my drive partner and I turned to each other in near unison and said, “This is really nice!” As far as auto journalists go, that qualifies as high praise.\n\nThe 2020 XC60 T8 Polestar Engineered is on sale now. In 2018, the S60 version of the car was only offered through the Care by Volvo car subscription program, but Volvo says all three Polestar Engineered vehicles (the XC60, S60 and V60) will be available for lease or purchase at Volvo dealerships.\n\n2020 Volvo XC60 | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Like its bigger brother — the seven-seat Volvo XC90 that we named our Best of 2016 — the five-seat 2018 Volvo XC60 is a whole new SUV compared with its predecessor. Compare the 2018 to the 2017 XC60 here.\n\nIt’s amazing how much is shared between the XC60 and XC90: engines, a lot of the chassis, much of the interior and most features. The XC60 feels like a mini-XC90, and that’s a good thing considering how gushy we get when we talk about the Best of 2016 winner we owned for a year. The kicker is that I think the Volvo XC60 is the better buy if you don’t need the third-row seat.\n\nI drove multiple versions of the new XC60 at a preview event in Denver (per our ethics policy, Cars.com pays for its own airfare and lodging). This review covers the regular and plug-in-hybrid versions.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThe Volvo XC60 comes in three flavors: the T5 (250-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder), the T6 (316 hp from a supercharged and turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder) and T8 plug-in hybrid (313-hp, supercharged and turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder paired with an electric motor and battery pack to boost total output to 400 hp). All powertrain options require premium 91-octane-or-above gasoline for optimal performance, according to the XC60’s owner’s manual, which is the norm for luxury SUVs.\n\nThese are the same engines as in the XC90, but the XC60 is around 300 pounds lighter, so the T6 and T8 versions I drove were more responsive and punchier than the XC90. The XC60 accelerates to 60 mph quicker than the XC90 in every version, and not by a small measure: Volvo says the XC60 T5, T6 and T8 hit 60 mph in 6.4, 5.6 and 4.9 seconds, respectively, while the XC90’s versions of the same do it in 7.5, 6.1 and 5.3 seconds, respectively.\n\nI didn’t observe a huge difference in passing power between the XC60’s 316-hp T6 and 400-hp T8, but from a stop and at lower speeds, the T8 provides instant acceleration and greater punch. Even though the T8 has a combined 84 more horsepower than the T6, its hybrid innards add more than 500 pounds of curb weight, lifting it to 4,599 pounds versus the T6’s 4,045 pounds.\n\nWhat the plug-in hybrid gets you is an EPA-estimated 17 miles of electric operation on a full charge, followed by combined gas mileage of 26 mpg; both of those numbers are slightly lower than the 2018 XC90 T8. The XC60 T8’s mileage rating also isn’t dramatically better than the non-hybrids’. The T5 gets an estimated 22/28/24 mpg city/highway/combined, and the T6 is rated 21/27/23 mpg; that’s similar to other four-cylinders in the class but with a little more punch from the meatier 2.0-liter. If you’re on the fence, the T8 plug-in hybrid’s available maximum $5,002 federal tax credit might help seal the deal.\n\nThe Volvo XC60’s ride quality, with its optional air suspension and adjustable firmness, recalls the XC90: firm but not uncomfortable. (Volvo didn’t provide any standard-suspension SUVs for us to drive.) The Volvo XC60 is a touch sportier than the XC90, with firmer steering and tighter handling that lets it manage mountain roads without feeling out of place, but it doesn’t attack corners like a Porsche Macan S, BMW X4 M40i or Audi SQ5. Drivability isn’t the XC60’s greatest strength, but it will be perfectly respectable to most.\n\nTop-Notch Interior\n\nThe Volvo XC60’s greatest strength is its warm, stylish interior, with enough high-quality materials to challenge the best interiors in the class, including the Audi Q5 and pricier Porsche Macan. The Volvo’s optional soft Nappa leather seats, genuine wood trim and all the sunlight streaming in through the standard panoramic moonroof create an airy, pleasant space in which to drive. Leather seating is standard, unlike competitors such asthe Mercedes GLC-Class and Lexus NX, which have leatherette (imitation leather) standard. Compare the XC60 with its competitors here. The interior mostly looks like an Volvo XC90 but with a new accent panel that runs across the dashboard from door to door and can be appointed with real wood. The wood, with grain you can feel, is accented by a matte aluminum-esque border; both add new dimensions to an otherwise familiar interior.\n\nThe backseat is more comfortable than the outgoing Volvo XC60’s, with increased legroom and a supportive seating position. Under the outboard cushions is a little cavelike storage space for phones, tablets or other pocket items. It’s unique to the XC60, though I’m not convinced of its usefulness. Is it where your devices are supposed to go when their batteries die? Because, as with the Volvo XC90, there are no USB ports in the backseat for device charging; there’s just a single 12-volt cigarette-lighter-style outlet. To be fair, they’re not a widely available feature in the class, but rear USB ports aren’t uncommon in non-luxury compact SUVs like a Mazda CX-5. (And if you like luxury cars, the CX-5 is worth a look.)\n\nCargo Room\n\nThe Volvo XC60 has a decidedly smaller footprint than the XC90. It’s 10.3 inches shorter nose to tail, 4.2 inches narrower and 4.6 inches shorter in height. Total cargo volume is lower, too, but perhaps not as much as you’d expect: A maximum of 63.3 cubic feet with the rear seats folded is still plenty for the XC60, while the XC90 has 85.7 cubic feet. Perhaps this will help you visualize the cargo room a little easier: Volvo says it’s 80.3 inches from the back of the front seats to the liftgate in the Volvo XC90 and 68.7 inches in the XC60. The XC60’s cargo area is flat, wide and comes with a standard power liftgate. Plus, the available air suspension has a position that lowers the rear for easier cargo loading, just like the XC90.\n\nTechnology\n\nAlso like the XC90, the XC60’s technology game is strong; its optional semi-autonomous Pilot Assist II is a must-have feature for commuting in stop-and-go traffic. The system keeps the XC60 centered in its lane more firmly than the original Pilot Assist in our XC90 (the system has since been upgraded in the 2017 XC90), and there’s greater resistance in the steering wheel, giving it more of an autonomous feeling. Pilot Assist II still requires hands on the wheel, but as before, the car brakes, accelerates and provides steering assistance on gently curving roads to relieve the tensions of heavy commuting.\n\nVolvo’s huge, vertically oriented touchscreen is also a carryover from the XC90. It works similarly here, which means it requires a thorough dive into the owner’s manual to learn its capabilities, plus a lot of time fumbling around looking for icons before you become familiar with switching between audio sources or activating or adjusting the car’s many tech features; it’s not something you instantly understand and use. Still, the screen has a big cool factor and the resolution is top-notch; once you’re familiarized, it’s an impressive and responsive system.\n\nSafety\n\nThe Volvo XC60 had not been crash-tested at the time of publication. Standard safety features are impressive, including forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking that recognizes cyclists, pedestrians and large animals. There’s also a lane-departure-prevention system, rear collision warning and a backup camera. Optional equipment includes blind spot warning,  rear cross-traffic alert and 360-degree cameras. Top-down 360-degree cameras aren’t uncommon, but the XC60’s is one of the best, with high resolution and a large screen.\n\nWorth the Money?\n\nThe XC60’s starting price of $42,495 for a T5 is a bargain. It comes with that sweet interior, all-wheel drive, a panoramic moonroof and the aforementioned standard safety features. I mostly drove the high-end Inscription trim level of the T6, which starts at $49,695 and adds navigation, a digital-display instrument panel, four-zone climate control and more. The ones I tested with Pilot Assist, Nappa leather, a rocking Bowers & Wilkins stereo, a head-up display, blind spot monitoring and much more tallied up to around $60,000.\n\nThe XC60 can command $60,000 and still feel reasonable considering its styling, quality and the technology inside. It isn’t any less luxurious than an XC90, just smaller and less expensive. If you don’t need a third row, the XC60 is the way to go.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Volvo has kept the 2017 XC60 compact SUV reasonably up to date for an aging design, but there’s no question it pales in comparison to the multi-award-winning full-size XC90 that represents Volvo’s new direction.\n\nVersus the competition: Running changes have kept the XC60 competitive in terms of efficiency, active-safety equipment and other ways a list of features might suggest, but a closer look reveals its age.\n\nWe suspect the next-generation Volvo XC60 will appear at an auto show soon, and knowing how much Volvo has invested in its XC90 (which Cars.com awarded our highest honor, naming it Best of 2016) and its new S90 sedan, I’m surprised the company has improved the XC60 as much as it has over the past few model years. The XC60 is based on an old platform, from back when Volvo was part of the Ford Motor Co. brand portfolio, and it’s not long for this world.\n\nGone entirely are the five- and six-cylinder engines, leaving just two versions of the Drive-E 2.0-liter four-cylinder. Rather than cylinder counts, T5 now refers to the less powerful engine and T6 to the more powerful one. These changes contribute to a condensed list of trims, down from 16 last year to seven for 2017. The XC60’s “editions” now include Dynamic and Inscription, both with either engine (T5 or T6) and front- or all-wheel drive, plus the top trim: T6 AWD R-Design. All trims have added formerly optional features as standard equipment for 2017. Most notably, the base model adds a backup camera, blind spot warning, a panoramic moonroof, leather seats, navigation and more. We tested a T6 AWD Inscription.\n\nCompeting compact SUVs include the Acura RDX, Cadillac XT5 and Lincoln MKC (see them compared with the Volvo here).\nExterior & Styling\nThe Volvo XC60 isn’t a bad-looking SUV. It’s far from the boxy shapes for which Volvo was once known, but it’s still a bit outdated, especially when viewed alongside the well-regarded XC90 and its Thor’s Hammer-style headlights (newly standard for 2017).\n\nHow It Drives\nEven with optional 20-inch alloy wheels (replacing the T6 AWD Inscription’s standard 19s), our car rode reasonably well — firmly, but not overly so versus competitors. It isn’t a marvel of comfort like an Volvo XC90 with air springs and adaptive shock absorbers, but neither is it as rock-hard as the XC90 feels without that optional suspension. The XC60 offers no such adaptive suspension, nor does the Acura. One is an option on the Cadillac and Lincoln, the latter of which needs it least.\n\nThe Volvo XC60 doesn’t feel sporty. Though its curb weight compares within the class, it feels heavy in turns, perhaps due to steering that’s generally numb and devoid of feedback — at least positive feedback. In hard cornering, mid-corner bumps jerk the steering wheel almost violently. It’s sort of the worst of both worlds in that regard. Bearing in mind that handling isn’t one of the many things for which we’ve praised the XC90, the XC60 still feels a step behind. It doesn’t help that the 60’s all-wheel drive doesn’t send more power to the rear wheels for a more balanced, rear-wheel-drive feel like some modern AWD systems do. It feels reactive, which is fine for foul weather but doesn’t provide engaging dynamics.\n\nIf I were to choose among the stated competitors on the basis of sportier dynamics, I’d go with the poise and effortless handling of the MKC, followed by the RDX.\n\nThe Volvo XC60 T6 we tested has the same optional engine as our loaded, long-term XC90: a turbocharged and supercharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that produces 302 horsepower (that’s 14 hp less than the engine makes in the XC90). It performs well here, giving the XC60 some guts and working well with the eight-speed automatic transmission. (The six-speed has been discontinued from the trims that still had it last year.) If anything, it responds more quickly to jabs at the accelerator than the 90 does. Though it delivers lots of goods for a wee block, this engine sounds pretty raunchy. It’s gravelly in the XC90 and even worse in the 60.\n\nThe updated engines preserve competitive fuel economy. At worst, the AWD T6 (the stronger engine) gets an EPA-estimated 20/27/22 mpg city/highway/combined on premium gasoline. (One of our editors observed 25.9 mpg after a 520-mile road trip, mostly on highways.) With AWD, the Acura and Cadillac are rated 22 and 21 mpg combined, respectively, though the Caddy makes up some cost by operating on regular gas. With FWD, the Acura and Cadillac get 23 and 22 mpg combined, respectively. With the 240-hp, T5 version of the Volvo engine, the FWD Volvo XC60 T5 is rated as high as 23/30/26 mpg, with a combined figure that’s closer to the highway figure than it is in many vehicles. This engine also accepts regular gas. When saddled with AWD, the T5 gets a respectable 20/29/23 mpg fuel economy.\n\nInterior\nThe new Volvo XC60 has the pluses common to Volvos, including excellent front-seat comfort. The now-standard leather upholstery is a big plus; competing models start with imitation leather. Interior quality is mixed. One editor noted how the high-quality materials on the doors extend all the way to the floor rather than turning cheap below eye level, but the cabin overall has a feel best described as premium rather than outright luxury. The XC90 has transcended that, now matching the best that European brands offer.\n\nAnother staple from a company that values outward visibility, the Volvo XC60 has remote-collapsing rear head restraints. If you look back and find that raised head restraints obscure your view and the seats aren’t occupied, a dashboard button will knock them down. It’s a better design than most vehicles have because the head restraints hinge forward and therefore must be raised in order to sit down. Many modern cars have head restraints that nest down into the seat to improve visibility, but that doesn’t ensure passengers will raise them to provide the intended protection.\n\nI can’t praise a company dedicated to outward visibility without pointing out my distaste for the XC60’s optional heated windshield, which incorporates squiggly heating-element wires. I think it’s mildly distracting during the day and like having a botched Lasik job at night. Some people don’t mind it, and others don’t until I bring it to their attention (I’m here to help). Unfortunately, it’s in an option package tied to the heated steering wheel, windshield washer nozzles, and front and rear heated seats. Heated front seats are a stand-alone option, but if you want the other things, you’re stuck with squigglefest.\n\nInterior space is comparable to the Lincoln MKC but a few cubic feet shy of the Acura and Cadillac. Across the board, seating dimensions vary little among these models. A panoramic moonroof, which is common in more recently redesigned models, was a surprising plus in the XC60 we drove that made the interior feel even roomier.\n\nAnother feature that’s been almost exclusive to Volvos is optional integrated booster seats, a stand-alone option. The outboard rear seats’ bottom cushions can be raised to two different heights to accommodate children 45-55 inches tall and 50-80 pounds, or higher for kids measuring 37-46 inches and 35-55 pounds. Aside from being positioned optimally to fit an occupant in the geometric sense (removable seats vary in this regard), they can of course vanish entirely for a larger passenger — without taking up space elsewhere in the SUV, as a separate booster seat would.\n\nTo see how well such external boosters and other child-safety seats fit in the Volvo XC60, check out our Car Seat Check of the 2016 model, which still applies to the 2017.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nPerhaps the clearest distinction between the XC60 and Volvo’s newer efforts are the dashboard controls. Where the XC90 has the most touchscreen-centric control setup this side of a Tesla — with just a few physical buttons — the 60 still has many mechanical buttons and a small display. If you don’t want a touchscreen controlling nearly every function in your car, this model might be for you, as it has many direct-access buttons for both vehicle and multimedia features.\n\nThat’s not to say it’s the most ergonomic or modern example of its type, though. I’ve always found the system’s rotary selection ring on the right too far away and too hard to the touch, and the two push-buttons within it are awkward to press.\n\nThe system has one of the most modern SiriusXM Satellite Radio enhancements: the ability to see the artist and song currently playing on other stations. The problem is, you have to push a button to change from a list of station names to a list of artists to a list of songs. It’s a little too easy to accidentally pull up “Lullaby” by Nickelback instead of Leonard Cohen’s song of the same name. No one wants that.\n\nThe XC90’s touchscreen format simply implements this SiriusXM feature better. New isn’t necessarily better in all cases, though: I still don’t care for the touch-sensitive buttons and the menu structure of the XT5’s Cadillac User Experience touchscreen system, and the RDX similarly offers a poorly thought-out, complex control system with two displays (one a touchscreen) and a multifunction knob. If you look at the executions independently, though, you’ll find the XC90’s modern system to be a particularly well-executed one of its type and the XC60’s to be less so among older designs. (Having been pummeled for its use of touch-sensitive panels and a glitchy touchscreen system, Lincoln has cleaned up its act and moved on to Sync 3, which is now one of the best such systems on the market.)\n\nDig deeper and you’ll find that some of the ways the Volvo XC60 looks competitive are better only on paper. It may have a USB port, but more would be better, and it doesn’t have Apple CarPlay, which is offered on the XC90, the Acura and the Cadillac. (Sadly, Android Auto comes only on the Cadillac.) It offers a Wi-Fi hot spot — complimentary for six months or 3GB of data — but the system relies on a 3G cellular connection rather than the faster 4G you’ll find in the XC90 and the Cadillac XT5. 4G is what we’re accustomed to on current smartphones and is necessary for streaming video.\n\nCargo & Storage\nWith 30.8 cubic feet of cargo volume behind the backseat and 67.4 cubic feet with the backseat folded, the XC60 is among the roomier models in its class, though not dramatically so. The XT5 comes close, at 30.0/63.0 cubic feet, followed by the RDX (26.1/61.3) and MKC (25.2/53.1). The Volvo’s 40/20/40-split backseat gives maximum flexibility.\n\nIn-cabin storage is average, with a good-sized glove compartment and door pockets. Though the space under the center armrest is limited, an area behind the center control panel can accommodate a purse or the like (a Volvo design that was discontinued in the XC90).\n\nThis isn’t the best class for towing a trailer, but the XC60’s capacity is on the high side — 3,500 pounds, matching the Cadillac. The Lincoln starts at 2,000 pounds and maxes at 3,000 in some trims (equipped with a trailering option). The Acura manages a mere 1,500 pounds.\nSafety\nThe XC60 earned the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s highest rating of good (out of a possible good, acceptable, fair or poor) in all crashworthiness tests, making it one of many models in the organization’s mid-size luxury SUV class to score well. It also earned five out of five stars overall from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nThe Volvo XC60’s complement of active-safety features is generous. In addition to a backup camera and rear parking sensors, standard features include blind spot warning, rear cross-traffic alert and City Safety, a forward collision warning system with automatic emergency braking that’s designed to work at speeds of 31 mph or less. Buyers can choose an option package that adds all-speed emergency braking with pedestrian and cyclist detection, driver alertness warning and lane departure warning. It also includes adaptive cruise control — not technically a safety feature, but one that eases driver fatigue.\n\nAll the above features worked well for me — at least in the way of no false alarms. The systems knew where other vehicles were and which were legitimate threats rather than just nearby. The adaptive cruise control was super smooth and operated all the way to a stop. Unfortunately, the XC60 lacks the XC90’s Pilot Assist feature, which combines the adaptive cruise with well-executed lane-centering (like automatic steering assist for highway driving). I also appreciated the dashboard button that activated our test vehicle’s optional 360-degree camera system — a must when nosing into a parking space. (The XC90 requires you to sweep the touchscreen to another menu first.)\n\nUsing onboard cellular technology, the XC60 provides automatic collision notification, including six months free.\n\nSee all the XC60’s safety features here.\nValue in Its Class\nThe Volvo XC60 represents value in a way that’s common among older designs: It’s been loaded with more and more standard features to remain attractive, not the least of which is leather upholstery. Where it falls behind is in the value inherent in the most modern features, many of which are on display in more recent Volvo models such as the XC90 and S90, as well as in direct class competitors. Ultimately, whether you’ll purchase a 2017, wait to see what the 2018 looks like or instead consider a competing brand will depend on how you feel about these features — especially the controls and multimedia.\n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "While some automakers employ sophisticated electronics to let their cars park themselves, Volvo offers a different technological tack in allowing the 2010 XC60 to stop by itself just shy of the trunk ahead.\n\nWhat did you expect from the automaker that has made its name on safety? Making it easier to park is much appreciated and saves lots of time, but preventing a collision saves a lot of time itself, not to mention money. Kudos to Volvo.\n\nIt added the magic system called City Safety as standard, because 75 percent of all collisions occur at speeds less than 18 mph, and 50 percent of those are in city traffic. The system can eliminate many accidents if you’re traveling at less than 9 mph or reduce their severity at less than 18.\n\nCity Safety does this by using an infrared sensor near the rearview mirror to measure the closing distance between the XC60 and the vehicle ahead. If sensing a collision is imminent, it tightens safety belts and applies the brakes at speed-appropriate force – from full to brute.\n\nMight not make personal-injury lawyers celebrate, but it’s cause for insurance agents to cheer – though it is not a miracle cure.\n\nIt won’t activate unless you are going at least 2 mph. At speeds above 18 mph, it doesn’t have the time to do much good. And, though it can spot cars and fixed objects, it can’t pick up a person or an animal. But a pedestrian detection system to react to people in the path will be offered on the crossover in about a year, after bowing on the 2011 S60 sedan this fall.\n\nIn our test, we got up to just under 9 mph and headed directly at plastic barriers. While 9 mph isn’t much when the guy ahead of you is doing it, it feels like racing for the checkered flag when the intent is to strike the object ahead.\n\nWhile we fought the temptation to stand on the brake pedal, the anti-lock brakes applied as advertised, the safety belts tightened and the car stopped.\n\nAfter a few more low-speed runs, we took it up a notch and again stopped automatically, though abruptly.\n\nSatisfied that the XC, a midsize crossover with sport utility styling, can stop when needed, we decided to find out how it goes.\n\nIt stands high for added ground clearance and comes standard with all-wheel-drive and dynamic stability control and traction control to keep you planted on wet, snowy or dry pavement. It’s an all-season, all-reason performer with excellent road manners.\n\nIt’s powered by a 3-liter, 281-hp inline 6-cylinder engine that quickly sprints from the light or down the merger ramp. The spirited crossover will surprise those thinking Volvo means conservative in Swedish. But with a 16 mpg city/22 highway rating, the XC hangs out at the fuel pump a lot.\n\nRide is a tad firm, but not rough; handling is very good. And though you sit high, there’s no top-heaviness in turns or curves, a problem common with big SUVs that XC is meant to replace.\n\nCabin room is good upfront, but knees are optional in back. Contoured front seat backs would solve that.\n\nControls are easy to see and use. The leather seats are sufficiently cozy, with non-slip backs and bottoms to keep you planted. Rear-seat occupants will thank you for opting for the climate package, which heats the seats back there as well as in the front.\n\nThe cargo hold is generous and has some hiding space under the floor. For even more room, the rear seat backs fold and headrests collapse when you lower them, so they don’t stick up against the front seats. Nice touch.\n\nNoteworthy are the optional ($600) panoramic sunroof with a wide panel that opens over the front seat, fixed glass over the passenger seat, standard Hill Descent control to reduce speed on steep declines and side-curtain air bags.\n\nThe 2010 XC60 starts at $37,200. While loaded with all the power goodies, the multimedia package at $2,700 added a navi system with backup camera and the $1,000 climate package added heated seats and rain-sensing wipers to push the sticker to more than $40,000.\n\nRead Jim Mateja Sunday in Rides.

      "expert_review": "The policeman was right. I was speeding. I have an explanation, which is not the same as an acceptable excuse. Nor is it meant to be. But it is the truth. I had slipped into the Joy Zone.\n\nIt is a hazard inherent in the operation of an exceptional automobile, which was the case that crisp November morning when I was driving the 2011 Volvo XC60 R-Design wagon heading north on Lee Highway in Northern Virginia.\n\nHow ironic!\n\nI was driving one of the world’s safest vehicles. Yet I ran into a speeding ticket that will cost me $200.\n\nI am tempted to blame distraction, the cause of 90 percent of our nation’s traffic accidents, especially in urban areas. But seduction is much closer to the truth.\n\nI was seduced, snookered, suckered by the smoothness of the new XC60’s turbocharged 3-liter in-line six-cylinder engine – 300 horsepower, 325 foot-pounds of torque. That’s 19 more horsepower and 30 foot-pounds more torque than was available in the 2010 version of that engine.\n\nBut I can’t really blame those power increases, either. Many cars have high-horsepower, high-torque engines. There is little about them, however, to lure you into the Joy Zone.\n\nThat zone is a special place, where driver and car become one. Only the finest cars can take you there. You think. Limbs move. The car goes. It is a machine totally in sync with human movement and emotion.\n\nThe better it performs, the better you feel, until reality intrudes.\n\nI am lucky that intrusion came in the form of a speeding ticket. Other motorists aren’t as fortunate. Their Joy Zone leads to injury, or death. I’ll take the fine, thank you very much.\n\nBut the irony remains vexing. The XC60 R-Design wagon is so rock-solid safe. For example, it is available with an optional Volvo-patented technology, “City Safe.” At 18 mph or below, an infrared detection system automatically slows or stops the wagon if a stationery or slowing vehicle, or human being, is detected in its path.\n\nCity Safe can be turned off in congested traffic where automatically stopping to avoid striking a vehicle in front of you can cause another motorist to slam into your rear end.\n\nNothing’s perfect. But I appreciate Volvo’s effort to put as much safety into its cars and wagons as possible. Other XC60 technology, such as an audible lane-departure warning system, represents a successful attempt by Volvo to improve on safety systems introduced by rivals. Ditto the XC60’s available blind-side warning system, which can prevent motorists from swerving into unseen (by the human eye) trailing traffic.\n\nIt’s all good stuff. But it is absent an important complement – my proposed Joy Zone Warning Device. It seems only fair that such technology be included in the XC60, considering that Volvo has gone out of its way to make the wagon accelerate and handle in the manner of a well-engineered sports car.\n\nThe Joy Zone Warning Device would detect dangerous fantasy levels, such as when a motorist, lost in the wow-zee of it all, exits a high-speed expressway and enters a more speed-restricted city street. It could issue dumbbell or knucklehead alerts, something like “Hey, knucklehead, slow down! You’re on a city street. Slow down!”\n\nI’d happily pay a couple of hundred bucks or more for that system. Heck, I’m paying for it anyway.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Volvo XC60?\n\nThe 2023 Volvo XC60 is a five-seat luxury SUV that’s notable for its powertrain choices, handsome cabin layout and impressive lineup of safety features. A 247-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder is standard on B5 models and can be had with front- or all-wheel drive. B6 models come standard with all-wheel drive and a 295-hp turbocharged and supercharged version of the base engine. The XC60 Recharge plug-in hybrid adds electric motors to the B6 engine to deliver an eye-popping 455 hp and 35 miles of electric-only driving range. The XC60’s rivals include the Acura RDX, BMW X3, Buick Envision, Lincoln Corsair and Mercedes-Benz GLC.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Volvo XC60?\n\nVolvo has renamed the three primary trim levels offered on both the standard XC60 and the XC60 Recharge: the base Core, mid-level Premium and range-topping Ultimate. Other minor changes include new wheel designs and the addition of two new exterior paints: Bright Dusk Metallic and Black Stone.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Volvo XC60 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n9-inch touchscreen\nGoogle-based navigation\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\n10-speaker audio system\nCloth upholstery\n12-inch digital gauge cluster\nPower liftgate\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nRain-sensing wipers\nLane departure steering assist\nLane departure warning\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nLeather seating surfaces\nSurround-view parking camera system\nAdaptive cruise control\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated rear seats\nQuad-zone climate control\nHead-up display\n14-speaker Harman Kardon audio system\nHeated steering wheel\nShould I Buy the 2023 Volvo XC60?\n\nThe Volvo XC60 remains a great choice for SUV shoppers who value a comfortable ride, classy interior, and long lineup of standard and optional active-safety features. The ride does get much firmer if you opt for the larger alloy wheels, however, and the price of plug-in hybrid models is steep when scaling to higher trims.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nVolvo’s XC60 is a compact luxury SUV that slots below the larger XC90 in Volvo’s lineup. The XC60 has a base six-cylinder engine paired with front-or all-wheel drive, and an available turbocharged six-cylinder engine that comes with all-wheel drive. The XC60 competes with the Cadillac SRX, Audi Q5 and Mercedes GLK-Class.\n\nNew for 2014\nVolvo updates the XC60’s front styling for 2014 while the inside has a new dashboard and upholstery options plus available sports seats. Other changes to the exterior include new wheel designs and LED accents on the taillights.\n\nExteriorThe XC60 is the smaller SUV in Volvo’s lineup compared to the XC90. Volvo says the restyled 2014 XC60’s front styling has an “urban” twist with a hood that’s more stylized than before. The front end’s black trim pieces are gone and leave a smooth, body-colored look that’s sleeker than 2013, though not significantly changed.  Exterior features include:\n\n\nIntegrated tailpipes\nNew wheel designs\nStandard 18-inch wheels\nAvailable 20-inch wheels\nAvailable heated windshield\n\nInteriorThe XC60 fits five occupants versus seven for the larger three-row XC90.  Its classy look inside is emphasized more for 2014 with new wood inlays and a new ceiling headliner. The XC60 gains an available configurable digital gauge cluster on T6 models for 2014 that replaces a standard tachometer and speedometer; it’s optional on 3.2 models. Available display choices include a traditional appearance, eco theme with eco meter and green background or a performance theme with red background.\n\nOther new technology includes a Sensus Connected Touch multimedia system with 7-inch display. Sensus receives an internet connection from a wireless card or mobile phone to power apps like internet radio, weather and a web browser.  Interior features include:\n\n\nAvailable sports seats\nAvailable heated steering wheel\nAvailable multimedia system with in-car apps and internet connectivity\nAvailable paddle shifters on XC60 T6\n\nUnder the HoodThe base XC60 3.2 trim level is powered by a 3.2-liter inline-six-cylinder engine sending power to the front wheels — all-wheel drive is optional. Up-level T6 models use a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder with 300 horsepower (T6) or 325 hp (T6 R-Design) and standard all-wheel drive. The T6 has new transmission programming to reduce shifting times and drop the zero-to-60-mph time from 6.9 to 6.5 seconds for T6 models compared to 2013. Mechanical features include:\n\n\nStandard 3.2-liter inline-six making 240 hp (T5)\nAvailable turbocharged 3.0-liter six-cylinder making 300 hp (T6)\nAvailable turbocharged 3.0-liter six-cylinder making 325 hp (T6 R-Design)\nSix-speed automatic transmission for all engines\nFront- or all-wheel drive\n\nSafetyVolvo’s City Safety technology is standard and includes a low-speed collision prevention that works at speeds up to 31 mph to automatically brake when a collision is detected. Safety features include:\n\n\nStandard collision warning\nElectronic stability control\nAntilock brakes\nAvailable pedestrian detection\nAvailable cyclist detection\nAvailable blind spot warning\nAvailable cross-traffic alert",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in July 2014 about the 2015 Volvo XC60. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2016, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nTo be good, a small luxury SUV needs to be a family car, a utility vehicle and a commuter car, and the reworked 2015 Volvo XC60 does all that. It provides an upscale environment and a dash of surprise — both on the window sticker and under the hood.\n\nFor 2015, the XC60 gets a number of new powertrains — teamed with confusing trim level names carried over from 2014 — and a dazzling new gauge cluster. In fact, the T6 version we tested might have too much power for its own good, but that just means shoppers can save a bit of cash and still get one of the best models in the segment.\n\nExterior & Styling\nYou don’t buy a luxury SUV if you want radical styling. Most are sedate, if not a tad boring. The XC60’s design leans toward the sophisticated side, with a contemporary front and a rather avant-garde rear. It’s those vertical taillights that are the signature style of the XC60.\n\nOverall, the Volvo has as much appeal as any in this class, whether it’s the Acura RDX, Audi Q5, BMW X3, Cadillac SRX, Lexus RX350 or Mercedes-Benz GLK.\n\nHow It Drives\nTwo of the Volvo’s five available engines are new, and these Drive-E efficient turbocharged engines are the biggest enhancements for 2015. Both, however, are teamed only with front-wheel drive. The base XC60 is now the T5 Drive-E, which packs a turbocharged, 2.0-liter inline-four-cylinder engine good for 240 horsepower and 258 pounds-feet of torque. In the past, T5 signified a turbocharged five-cylinder — hence the letter T and the number 5.\n\nThat doesn’t seem to matter to Volvo in 2015, but it may confuse shoppers, especially ones who own an older T5. Those drivers will, however, be happier with the new mileage, at 24/31/27 mpg city/highway/combined. Acura’s RDX, BMW’s X3 and Mercedes-Benz’ GLK have similar or more power, but none breaks 28 mpg on the highway. Compare the four here.\n\nAnother version of this 2.0-liter four-cylinder tops the range, called the T6 Drive-E. It’s not only turbocharged but also supercharged, reaching impressive figures of 302 hp and 295 pounds-feet of torque. It replaces a turbocharged six-cylinder that was close in power, at 300 hp and 325 pounds-feet of torque, but fell well behind in fuel economy. The 2015 T6 Drive-E — the model we tested for this review — is rated 22/30/25 mpg.\n\nOn the street, that’s a lot of power for this type of vehicle. It’s nice to have in certain situations, especially passing on the highway, but it’s a bit uncontrolled when going from a dead stop. The front tires spin relatively easily when pushed only a bit harder than the norm. There’s also a bit of torque steer when taking crisp turns. But the T6 Drive-E is surprisingly fun to drive, which isn’t normally the case in this class, no matter how strong the engine.\n\nMost drivers will likely be quite satisfied with the front-wheel-drive T5’s power.\n\nNo matter the engine, the XC60’s ride quality really impresses, with a luxuriously soft ride that many in this class don’t achieve. Road and wind noise are minimal at highway speeds.\n\nThe only sore point in terms of both power and mileage will come when a shopper wants all-wheel drive. The XC60’s three all-wheel-drive models carry over older engines and have names similar to the new power plants. There’s the 3.2 all-wheel-drive model that features a 3.2-liter inline-six-cylinder and is the only XC60 without turbocharging. Next comes the T6 all-wheel-drive and T6 all-wheel-drive R-Design, both of which feature a turbocharged, 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder. Those two produce 300 and 325 hp, respectively, and I found that the 2014 R-Design was also too powerful for this class when I tested it.\n\nThe all-wheel-drive models’ mileage ratings also suffer. The 3.2 all-wheel-drive comes in at 18/25/20 mpg, while the two T6 all-wheel-drives have identical ratings of 17/24/20 mpg.\n\nAll 2015 XC60s, however, run on regular gasoline, a big plus.\n\nInterior\nSwedish design is usually simplistic by nature, but don’t let the rather mundane styling keep you from thinking the XC60 is a true luxury car. The available leather seats are exceptionally comfortable, with a nice feel to the material, which is done in a two-tone look with nice stitching throughout the cabin.\n\nEverywhere you look and touch, whether it’s on the doors or dash, items are finished in substantial metal or metal-looking trim.\n\nThe backseat felt far roomier than the specs suggest. The numbers place it toward the bottom of the pack in terms of legroom and shoulder room, but my 6-year-old son and 5-year-old daughter — still  in large car seats — had plenty of room and were able to walk across from one side to the other. Headroom throughout the cabin is impressive even with the optional, large panoramic moonroof that takes a chunk out of interior height.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nBesides the engine options, the other major shift for 2015 is the addition of an all-digital gauge cluster. It replaces a simple yet elegant two-gauge layout I always appreciated. Digital gauge clusters are becoming more common and are used by Cadillac and Jaguar, among other automakers.\n\nDead center, a large ringed display houses a configurable speedometer and tachometer; a full menu appears when called up using controls on the turn-signal stalk. Two “wing” displays flanking the main display house various information that can also be customized with simple controls. There are also three color and layout themes from which drivers can select.\n\nIt’s a well-executed look and feel, and all the controls are quite good, but I found operating the trip computer to be the most confounding aspect of the whole system.\n\nVolvo’s straightforward multimedia system, on the other hand, has a fan in me. A 7-inch screen — small compared with many competitors — has above-average resolution, and you control selections using a knob with two inset buttons. The scrolling and selecting is intuitive and fast versus using touch-screen controls.\n\nWhile the available navigation isn’t as good as in some others in this class, the rest of the functions, like phone and audio, work just fine. The optional Premium Sound System produces spectacular range even at high volumes and is worth adding.\n\nCargo & Storage\nCargo space is impressive. Not only are dimensions robust, at 30.8 cubic feet with the rear seats in place and 67.4 cubic feet with them folded flat — besting most competitors — but the cargo floor is quite low to the ground, making loading large items easy.\n\nThe rear seats also fold completely flat, flush with the cargo floor, which isn’t always the case.\n\nThere are numerous cubbies sprinkled throughout the cabin for both front and rear occupants.\n\nSafety\nIn the past, Volvo was synonymous with safety, but many other automakers have caught up in terms of crash-test ratings and safety systems. Still, by most measures the XC60 still ranks high in safety.\n\nThe 2015 Volvo XC60 earned a five-star overall crash-test rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, while the 2014 model received the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s Top Safety Pick+ award, that organization’s highest rating. IIHS has not released 2015 results at this time, but because the XC60 hasn’t been structurally redesigned, the earlier tests are likely to be deemed valid for the 2015 model.\n\nThe XC60 has a number of available preventative safety features, like a blind spot warning system, cross traffic alert, forward collision warning and lane departure warning. There’s also a pedestrian/cyclist detection system that can apply the brakes when someone happens across the SUV’s path.\n\nYou can find a full list of safety features here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nPower, fuel economy, a luxurious interior, a large cargo area and its safety pedigree should influence any shopper to consider the XC60. Its price also happens to be right in each trim level.\n\nComparing the most basic T5 Drive-E XC60, which costs $36,675, it’s a few thousand less than equivalent BMW and Mercedes options and a bit more than the Acura RDX. Prices range all the way to $50,725 for the T6 R-Design Platinum (prices include destination charges). The wide array of powertrain options gives more shoppers a point of entry to the model.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in April 2012 about the 2012 Volvo XC60. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2013, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nI had high hopes for the 2012 Volvo XC60. I recently (reluctantly) ended a long-term relationship with my own beloved Volvo, a C30, because it no longer fit my evolving family. Having recently added a husband and stepdaughter to my previous status as a single mom of two, we’re now in the market for a five-seater like the XC60. I hoped that maybe this car would fill my empty heart.\n\nWhile my courtship with the well-mannered XC60 started out positive, the chemistry just wasn’t there. However, he … I mean it would make a perfect fit for someone else.\n\nThe XC60 comes in front- and all-wheel-drive versions in 3.2, T6 and T6 R-Design trims with Premier, Premier Plus and, new for this year, Platinum editions (see the 2011 and 2012 versions side by side). I tested the T6 R-Design — it offers a slightly more aggressive look and driving experience — in the all-wheel-drive Platinum edition, which checked in at $52,675.\n\nWith a huge number of mix and match configurations, there’s an XC60 for every taste and budget. See them compared here.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe XC60 is a sharp-looking little crossover, a poster child for Volvo’s evolving modern image. No longer the square, boxy station wagon we remember from our childhoods, today’s Volvo is sporting, sleek and sexy. Volvo refers to the XC60 as “the most sensual Volvo ever.” To some, that might conjure fantasies of making out with Edward in the back of the XC60 he drove in several of the “Twilight” movies. To me, it just means there’s enough form to make this car desirable to drive — with or without the family in tow — on top of all the function and safety it offers.\n\nFAMILY-FRIENDLY FEATURES\nOne of the areas where the XC60 really shines is in its simple Scandinavian interior. The designers tried to replicate the sensation of peace and tranquility they experience on the Swedish coastline, where the smooth-as-glass water surface is punctuated with gently sloping, weather-worn rock shores. They definitely succeeded; it just feels good to sit in the XC60.\n\nBecause my New Year’s resolution is to eliminate as many toxins in my daily life (foods, cleaning products, my beauty routine) as possible, Volvo’s continued commitment to creating a clean environment inside this car impressed me. The leather was dyed without the chrome typically used in the process, and all nickel products (which can be highly allergenic to many people) have been completely eliminated from the XC60’s interior.\n\nThe XC60 is pretty basic when it comes to family functionality. The backseat had enough room for my two oldest daughters (ages 9 and 11), but got a little tight with the addition of my 7-year-old stepdaughter on the weekend. I did manage to squeeze them all in — the two youngest in Bubble Bum booster seats in the outboard positions, with the oldest in the middle. Although the optional feature was not in my test car, Volvo does offer integrated booster seats in the XC60’s outboard seats. They’re so subtle nobody even knows they’re there, helping prolong the length of time an older child will tolerate using the booster. It also simplifies seat folding, where a separate booster seat must be detached and removed before the seats can fold.\n\nThere’s 36.4 inches of legroom for the rear passengers, slightly more than other cars in this class — like the Mercedes-Benz GLK — offer. While the backseat splits into thirds and folds flat with the press of a button, expanding the cargo area to 67.4 cubic feet, its backrests don’t recline, a big oversight on Volvo’s part. More and more child-safety seat manufacturers allow the installation of forward-facing seats in a slightly reclined position for added comfort. My youngest daughters still nap in their booster seats, so I prefer to keep the seatback reclined just enough so that they stay upright, rather than slumping forward over the top of their seat belts.\n\nBackseat passengers have just enough storage. They each get a storage pocket on the back of the front seats, storage bins with bottleholders in the doors, and cupholders and another storage bin in the armrest that folds down from the center seatback when that position isn’t in use.\n\nUp front, two cupholders, an average-sized center console and storage bins in the front doors help contain loose stuff. Another discrete storage area is stashed behind the clean, modern floating center control panel. However, unlike in my C30, the bin isn’t recessed enough to actually secure much.\n\nThe large cargo space in the XC60 fits everything a family needs and has the added functionality of a lockable under-floor storage bin. In my Platinum edition test car, I also got a lot of use out of a grocery bag holder — a flip-up flap that has elastic bands and hooks to help prevent grocery bags from sliding and spilling all over the cargo space. Nets on either side of the cargo area also hold on to loose items.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nBEHIND THE WHEEL\nThe base XC60 has a 240-horsepower, 3.2-liter six-cylinder engine. I drove the more powerful T6 version, which was a little bit of a bummer. I appreciated the solid feel and the 325-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter six-cylinder engine’s quick and smooth acceleration, but the soft ride felt a little on the floaty side for my taste. That, in combination with its 38.4-foot turning diameter, made me feel like I was driving a larger SUV than I was. In comparison, the GLK has a turning circle of 37.6 feet.\n\nWhile I personally prefer more car-like cornering, my husband loved the ride quality. He said he had no idea what I was griping about. You’ll have to drive this one yourself and see how it feels to you.\n\nOne thing we definitely agreed on was the surprising amount of noise inside the XC60. With a luxury brand like Volvo, you expect — and hope for — an unnaturally quiet interior. Unfortunately, this is one area where Volvo doesn’t deliver. My husband and I both commented on the wind noise entering the cabin from around the windshield pillars, possibly from the large side mirrors. The noise issue didn’t improve in the backseat, either. My daughter asked me on more than one occasion if a window was cracked or if she maybe hadn’t shut the door all the way. She said she could hear every car that passed us on the highway.\n\nSAFETY\nThe XC60 stays true to Volvo’s strong heritage of safety innovations, packed full of advanced safety features that any family would utilize and appreciate.\n\nWith top scores of Good in front, side and rear crash tests, plus the roof-strength test, the XC60 is an Insurance Institute for Highway Safety Top Safety Pick. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gives the XC60 an overall crash-test rating of five out of five stars.\n\nAs is required of all 2012 models, the Volvo XC60 has standard antilock brakes, an electronic stability system and traction control. There are side curtain airbags for the front and backseat passengers, plus side-impact airbags for the driver and front passenger.\n\nVolvo says 75 percent of all crashes occur while vehicles are going less than 19 mph. In order to help curb that, the XC60 features Volvo’s City Safety as standard equipment. An infrared laser sensor “watches” the front of your vehicle to see if you’re about to hit another car. If the difference in speed between the two cars is less than 10 mph, the XC60 intervenes and brakes to a stop to completely avoid a collision. If the difference in speed between the two cars is between 11 and 19 mph, the XC60’s braking should decrease the severity of the imminent crash.\n\nOptional safety features on my XC60 Platinum included a backup camera, collision warning with auto brake, pedestrian detection with full auto brake and a lane departure warning system, with the option to choose either normal or increased sensitivity.\n\nSee all the 2012 Volvo XC60’s standard safety features here.\n\nInstalling child-safety seats in the XC60 is a mixed bag. Of course, if you have Volvo’s integrated two-stage booster seat option, your kids will jump right in and get buckled up on their own with the help of stable seat belt buckles.\n\nHowever, installing either rear- or forward-facing seats using the Latch system is a bit of a challenge. The lower anchors are hidden within the seat bight, so if you’re installing a seat with Latch hooks on a nylon belt (rather than rigid Latches like those on Clek seats), you’ll have to fish around in the seat bight to hook and unhook the Latch.\n\nSend Kristin an email",

      "expert_review": "To be good, a small luxury SUV needs to be a family car, a utility vehicle and a commuter car, and the reworked 2015 Volvo XC60 does all that. It provides an upscale environment and a dash of surprise — both on the window sticker and under the hood.\n\nFor 2015, the Volvo XC60 gets a number of new powertrains — teamed with confusing trim level names carried over from 2014 — and a dazzling new gauge cluster. In fact, the T6 version we tested might have too much power for its own good, but that just means shoppers can save a bit of cash and still get one of the best models in the segment.\n\nExterior & Styling\nYou don’t buy a luxury SUV if you want radical styling. Most are sedate, if not a tad boring. The Volvo XC60’s design leans toward the sophisticated side, with a contemporary front and a rather avant-garde rear. It’s those vertical taillights that are the signature style of the XC60.\n\nOverall, the Volvo has as much appeal as any in this class, whether it’s the Acura RDX, Audi Q5, BMW X3, Cadillac SRX, Lexus RX350 or Mercedes-Benz GLK.\n\nHow It Drives\nTwo of the Volvo’s five available engines are new, and these Drive-E efficient turbocharged engines are the biggest enhancements for 2015. Both, however, are teamed only with front-wheel drive. The base Volvo XC60 is now the T5 Drive-E, which packs a turbocharged, 2.0-liter inline-4-cylinder engine good for 240 horsepower and 258 pounds-feet of torque. In the past, T5 signified a turbocharged five-cylinder — hence the letter T and the number 5.\n\nThat doesn’t seem to matter to Volvo in 2015, but it may confuse shoppers, especially ones who own an older T5. Those drivers will, however, be happier with the new mileage, at 24/31/27 mpg city/highway/combined. Acura’s RDX, BMW’s X3 and Mercedes-Benz’ GLK have similar or more power, but none breaks 28 mpg on the highway. Compare the four here.\n\nAnother version of this 2.0-liter four-cylinder tops the range, called the T6 Drive-E. It’s not only turbocharged but also supercharged, reaching impressive figures of 302 hp and 295 pounds-feet of torque. It replaces a turbocharged inline 6-cylinder that was close in power, at 300 hp and 325 pounds-feet of torque, but fell well behind in fuel economy. The 2015 Volvo XC60 T6 Drive-E — the model we tested for this review — is rated 22/30/25 mpg.\n\nOn the street, that’s a lot of power for this type of vehicle. It’s nice to have in certain situations, especially passing on the highway, but it’s a bit uncontrolled when going from a dead stop. The front tires spin relatively easily when pushed only a bit harder than the norm. There’s also a bit of torque steer when taking crisp turns. But the Volvo XC60 T6 Drive-E is surprisingly fun to drive, which isn’t normally the case in this class, no matter how strong the engine.\n\nMost drivers will likely be quite satisfied with the front-wheel-drive T5’s power.\n\nNo matter the engine, the Volvo XC60’s ride quality really impresses, with a luxuriously soft ride that many in this class don’t achieve. Road and wind noise are minimal at highway speeds.\n\nThe only sore point in terms of both power and mileage will come when a shopper wants all-wheel drive. The Volvo XC60’s three all-wheel-drive models carry over older engines and have names similar to the new power plants. There’s the 3.2 all-wheel-drive model that features a 3.2-liter inline-six-cylinder and is the only XC60 without turbocharging. Next comes the T6 all-wheel-drive and T6 all-wheel-drive R-Design, both of which feature a turbocharged, 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder. Those two produce 300 and 325 hp, respectively, and I found that the 2014 R-Design was also too powerful for this class when I tested it.\n\nThe all-wheel-drive models’ mileage ratings also suffer. The 3.2 all-wheel-drive comes in at 18/25/20 mpg, while the two T6 all-wheel-drives have identical ratings of 17/24/20 mpg.\n\nAll 2015 Volvo XC60s, however, run on regular gasoline, a big plus.\n\nInterior\nSwedish design is usually simplistic by nature, but don’t let the rather mundane styling keep you from thinking the XC60 is a true luxury car. The available leather seats are exceptionally comfortable, with a nice feel to the material, which is done in a two-tone look with nice stitching throughout the cabin.\n\nEverywhere you look and touch, whether it’s on the doors or dash, items are finished in substantial metal or metal-looking trim.\n\nThe backseat felt far roomier than the specs suggest. The numbers place it toward the bottom of the pack in terms of legroom and shoulder room, but my 6-year-old son and 5-year-old daughter — still  in large car seats — had plenty of room and were able to walk across from one side to the other. Headroom throughout the cabin is impressive even with the optional, large panoramic moonroof that takes a chunk out of interior height.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nBesides the engine options, the other major shift for 2015 is the addition of an all-digital gauge cluster. It replaces a simple yet elegant two-gauge layout I always appreciated. Digital gauge clusters are becoming more common and are used by Cadillac and Jaguar, among other automakers.\n\nDead center, a large ringed display houses a configurable speedometer and tachometer; a full menu appears when called up using controls on the turn-signal stalk. Two “wing” displays flanking the main display house various information that can also be customized with simple controls. There are also three color and layout themes from which drivers can select.\n\nIt’s a well-executed look and feel, and all the controls are quite good, but I found operating the trip computer to be the most confounding aspect of the whole system.\n\nVolvo’s straightforward multimedia system, on the other hand, has a fan in me. A 7-inch screen — small compared with many competitors — has above-average resolution, and you control selections using a knob with two inset buttons. The scrolling and selecting is intuitive and fast versus using touch-screen controls.\n\nWhile the available navigation system isn’t as good as in some others in this class, the rest of the functions, like phone and audio, work just fine. The optional Premium Sound System produces spectacular range even at high volumes and is worth adding.\n\nCargo & Storage\nCargo space is impressive. Not only are dimensions robust, at 30.8 cubic feet with the rear seats in place and 67.4 cubic feet with them folded flat — besting most competitors — but the cargo floor is quite low to the ground, making loading large items easy.\n\nThe rear seats also fold completely flat, flush with the cargo floor, which isn’t always the case.\n\nThere are numerous cubbies sprinkled throughout the cabin for both front and rear occupants.\n\nSafety\nIn the past, Volvo was synonymous with safety, but many other automakers have caught up in terms of crash-test ratings and safety systems. Still, by most measures the Volvo XC60 still ranks high in safety.\n\nThe 2015 Volvo XC60 earned a five-star overall crash-test rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, while the 2014 model received the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s Top Safety Pick+ award, that organization’s highest rating. IIHS has not released 2015 results at this time, but because the Volvo XC60 hasn’t been structurally redesigned, the earlier tests are likely to be deemed valid for the 2015 model.\n\nThe XC60 has a number of available preventative safety features, like a blind spot information system, cross traffic alert, forward collision warning and lane departure warning. There’s also a pedestrian/cyclist detection system that can apply the brakes when someone happens across the SUV’s path.\n\nYou can find a full list of safety features here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nPower, fuel economy, a luxurious interior, a large cargo area and its safety pedigree should influence any shopper to consider the XC60. Its price also happens to be right in each trim level.\n\nComparing the most basic T5 Drive-E XC60, which costs $36,675, it’s a few thousand less than equivalent BMW and Mercedes options and a bit more than the Acura RDX. Prices range all the way to $50,725 for the T6 R-Design Platinum (prices include destination charges). The wide array of powertrain options gives more shoppers a point of entry to the model.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "I had high hopes for the 2012 Volvo XC60. I recently (reluctantly) ended a long-term relationship with my own beloved Volvo, a C30, because it no longer fit my evolving family. Having recently added a husband and stepdaughter to my previous status as a single mom of two, we’re now in the market for a five-seater like the XC60. I hoped that maybe this car would fill my empty heart.\n\nWhile my courtship with the well-mannered XC60 started out positive, the chemistry just wasn’t there. However, he … I mean it would make a perfect fit for someone else.\n\nThe XC60 comes in front-wheel and AWD versions in 3.2, T6 and T6 R-Design select trims with Premier, Premier Plus and, new for this year, Platinum editions (see the 2011 and 2012 versions side by side). I tested the T6 R-Design — it offers a slightly more aggressive look and driving experience — in the AWD Platinum edition, which checked in at $52,675.\n\nWith a huge number of mix and match configurations, there’s an XC60 for every taste and budget. See them compared here.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe Volvo XC60 is a sharp-looking little crossover body-type SUV, a poster child for Volvo’s evolving modern image. No longer the square, boxy station wagon we remember from our childhoods, today’s Volvo is sporting, sleek and sexy. Volvo refers to the XC60 as “the most sensual Volvo ever.” To some, that might conjure fantasies of making out with Edward in the back of the XC60 he drove in several of the “Twilight” movies. To me, it just means there’s enough form to make this car desirable to drive — with or without the family in tow — on top of all the function and safety it offers.\n\nFAMILY-FRIENDLY FEATURES\nOne of the areas where the Volvo XC60 really shines is in its simple Scandinavian interior. The designers tried to replicate the sensation of peace and tranquility they experience on the Swedish coastline, where the smooth-as-glass water surface is punctuated with gently sloping, weather-worn rock shores. They definitely succeeded; it just feels good to sit in the XC60.\n\nBecause my New Year’s resolution is to eliminate as many toxins in my daily life (foods, cleaning products, my beauty routine) as possible, Volvo’s continued commitment to creating a clean environment inside this car impressed me. The leather seats were dyed without the chrome typically used in the process, and all nickel products (which can be highly allergenic to many people) have been completely eliminated from the XC60’s interior.\n\nThe XC60 is pretty basic when it comes to family functionality. The backseat had enough room for my two oldest daughters (ages 9 and 11), but got a little tight with the addition of my 7-year-old stepdaughter on the weekend. I did manage to squeeze them all in — the two youngest in Bubble Bum booster seats in the outboard positions, with the oldest in the middle. Although the optional feature was not in my test car, Volvo does offer integrated booster seats in the XC60’s outboard seats. They’re so subtle nobody even knows they’re there, helping prolong the length of time an older child will tolerate using the booster. It also simplifies seat folding, where a separate booster seat must be detached and removed before the seats can fold.\n\nThere’s 36.4 inches of legroom for the rear passengers, slightly more than other cars in this class — like the Mercedes-Benz GLK — offer. While the backseat splits into thirds and folds flat with the press of a button, expanding the cargo area to 67.4 cubic feet, its backrests don’t recline, a big oversight on Volvo’s part. More and more child-safety seat manufacturers allow the installation of forward-facing seats in a slightly reclined position for added comfort. My youngest daughters still nap in their booster seats, so I prefer to keep the seatback reclined just enough so that they stay upright, rather than slumping forward over the top of their seat belts.\n\nBackseat passengers have just enough storage. They each get a storage pocket on the back of the front seats, storage bins with bottleholders in the doors, and cupholders and another storage bin in the armrest that folds down from the center seatback when that position isn’t in use.\n\nUp front, two cupholders, an average-sized center console and storage bins in the front doors help contain loose stuff. Another discrete storage area is stashed behind the clean, modern floating center control panel. However, unlike in my C30, the bin isn’t recessed enough to actually secure much.\n\nThe large cargo space in the Volvo XC60 fits everything a family needs and has the added functionality of a lockable under-floor storage bin. In my Platinum edition test car, I also got a lot of use out of a grocery bag holder — a flip-up flap that has elastic bands and hooks to help prevent grocery bags from sliding and spilling all over the cargo space. Nets on either side of the cargo area also hold on to loose items.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nBEHIND THE WHEEL\nThe base Volvo XC60 has a 240-horsepower, 3.2-liter six-cylinder engine. I drove the more powerful T6 version, which was a little bit of a bummer. I appreciated the solid feel and the 325-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter inline 6-cylinder engine’s quick and smooth acceleration, but the soft ride felt a little on the floaty side for my taste. That, in combination with its 38.4-foot turning diameter, made me feel like I was driving a larger SUV than I was. In comparison, the GLK has a turning circle of 37.6 feet. My Volvo XC60 came with a six-speed automatic with a manual shift option.\n\nWhile I personally prefer more car-like cornering, my husband loved the ride quality. He said he had no idea what I was griping about. You’ll have to drive this one yourself and see how it feels to you.\n\nOne thing we definitely agreed on was the surprising amount of noise inside the Volvo XC60. With a luxury brand like Volvo, you expect — and hope for — an unnaturally quiet interior. Unfortunately, this is one area where Volvo doesn’t deliver. My husband and I both commented on the wind noise entering the cabin from around the windshield pillars, possibly from the large side mirrors. The noise issue didn’t improve in the backseat, either. My daughter asked me on more than one occasion if a window was cracked or if she maybe hadn’t shut the door all the way. She said she could hear every car that passed us on the highway.\n\nSAFETY\nThe XC60 stays true to Volvo’s strong heritage of top-of-the-line safety innovations, packed full of advanced safety features that any family would utilize and appreciate.\n\nWith top scores of Good in front, side and rear crash tests, plus the roof-strength test, the XC60 is an Insurance Institute for Highway Safety Top Safety Pick. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gives the Volvo XC60 an overall crash-test rating of five out of five stars.\n\nAs is required of all 2012 models, the Volvo XC60 has standard antilock brakes, an electronic stability system and traction control. There are side curtain airbags for the front and backseat passengers, plus side-impact airbags for the driver and front passenger.\n\nVolvo says 75 percent of all crashes occur while vehicles are going less than 19 mph. In order to help curb that, the XC60 features Volvo’s class-leading City Safety as standard equipment. An infrared laser sensor “watches” the front of your vehicle to see if you’re about to hit another car. If the difference in speed between the two cars is less than 10 mph, the XC60 intervenes and brakes to a stop to completely avoid a collision. If the difference in speed between the two cars is between 11 and 19 mph, the XC60’s braking should decrease the severity of the imminent crash.\n\nOptional safety features on my Volvo XC60 Platinum included a backup camera, collision warning with auto brake, pedestrian detection with full auto brake and a lane departure warning system, with the option to choose either normal or increased sensitivity.\n\nSee all the 2012 Volvo XC60 SUV’s standard safety features here.\n\nInstalling child-safety seats in the Volvo XC60 is a mixed bag. Of course, if you have Volvo’s integrated two-stage booster seat option, your kids will jump right in and get buckled up on their own with the help of stable seat belt buckles.\n\nHowever, installing either rear- or forward-facing seats using the Latch system is a bit of a challenge. The lower anchors are hidden within the seat bight, so if you’re installing a seat with Latch hooks on a nylon belt (rather than rigid Latches like those on Clek seats), you’ll have to fish around in the seat bight to hook and unhook the Latch.\n\nSend Kristin an email",
