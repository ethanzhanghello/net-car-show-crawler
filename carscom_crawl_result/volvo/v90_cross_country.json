      "expert_review": "Volvo recently expanded its lineup with the S90 sedan and is again adding to it with the 2017 V90 Cross Country. It debuted at the 2016 Los Angeles Auto Show. With the V90 Cross Country, Volvo continues its long history of producing wagons and then uprating them to go off-road.\n\n\nAs you'd expect from a car designed to go off-road, the V90 Cross Country rides higher than a conventional car. And the wagon features a long hood that, while it looks great, might make it hard to judge where the front of the car is in tight spaces. Volvo said it tested the car in a secret testing area in the \"frozen north of Sweden,\" so hopefully engineers checked that out while they were up there.\n\nThe rest of the V90 follows the traditional Volvo styling, with the automaker’s family grille, Thor’s hammer headlights and chiseled body parts. \n\nInterior\n\nThere aren’t a lot of specifics about exactly what luxury surfaces await inside the V90 Cross Country, but Volvo assures us it’s “sumptuous,” and will feature the connectivity and entertainment features of the Volvo S90 and V90. Presumably, this also means Apple CarPlay and Android Auto will be available.\n\nThat also includes the option of a Bowers & Wilkins stereo system.\n\nUnder the Hood\n\nThere’s one engine available for the V90 Cross Country, a 316-horsepower, supercharged and turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that’s matched to an eight-speed automatic transmission. The V90 Cross Country comes with all-wheel drive standard and its ground clearance is 8.3 inches.\n\nSafety\n\nVolvo hasn’t released much information about the standard and optional safety features of the V90 Cross Country, but the company does pride itself on its commitment to safety, so check back for more information.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2022 Volvo V90 Cross Country stands out in the sea of luxury SUVs as a sleek, sophisticated alternative, but some aspects of its driving experience and touchscreen system aren’t up to luxury standards.\n\nVersus the competition: Luxury wagons have been in retreat, but the ones that remain, like the Audi A6 Allroad and Mercedes-Benz E-Class All-Terrain, follow a similar formula as the V90 Cross Country: off-road-inspired styling, extra ground clearance and standard all-wheel drive.\n\nRelated: 2022 Volvo XC40 Recharge Review: A Ravenous Rocket\n\nThe V90 and V90 Cross Country are Volvo’s largest wagons, measuring as long as the automaker’s three-row SUV, the XC90. The wagons, however, have just two rows of seats with seating for five. The V90 Cross Country starts at $57,295, including a $1,095 destination charge. Optional features brought our test car’s price to $61,990 — less than the starting prices for the A6 Allroad and E-Class All-Terrain, but both those wagons come standard with more powerful six-cylinder engines and air suspensions (see these wagons’ specs compared). \n\nHow It Drives\n\nAll V90 Cross Country wagons are powered by a new mild-hybrid drivetrain featuring a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine with a turbocharger and an electric supercharger. It’s rated at 295 horsepower and 310 pounds-feet of torque — just about the opposite of the previous turbocharged and supercharged engine’s 316 hp and 295 pounds-feet of torque. The new drivetrain gets only slightly better EPA-estimated gas mileage, with the 2022 V90 Cross Country rated 25 mpg combined versus 24 mpg last year.\n\nThe new drivetrain has no trouble getting the V90 Cross Country up to highway speeds, but it doesn’t have much reserve power for high-speed passing. The engine works with an eight-speed automatic that’s mostly unobtrusive, but at the beginning of my testing it stuttered a bit when kicking down to lower gears, like when passing. The more time I spent driving the car, however, the smoother the transmission felt.\n\nThe wagon rides well on smooth highways, but ride quality deteriorates on rougher roads; the car was unsettled on a stretch of pavement with multiple frost heaves. Road noise also disturbs the cabin at highway speeds. Our test car had the V90’s standard fixed suspension and optional 20-inch wheels with low-profile tires (19-inch wheels are standard). An adaptive air suspension is available for $1,200.\n\nThe Interior\n\nOur test car’s interior had a premium look thanks in part to its light-gray leather upholstery and oak wood trim. The dashboard has relatively few buttons, with many controls routed through the vertically oriented 9-inch touchscreen. This screen layout first appeared in the 2016 XC90, and compared with the 12- and 15.5-inch portrait-oriented screens available today, it seems small.\n\nThe driver’s seat is comfortable for taller adults, though there’s not much extra headroom; the V90 Cross Country has a standard panoramic moonroof with a power sunshade, which tends to reduce headroom. Thin roof pillars, large windows and well-placed side mirrors help create good natural visibility.\n\nThe touchscreen system now runs Android Automotive OS instead of Volvo’s Sensus Connect. The Android interface is similar to Sensus Connect, if not exactly the same, but some of its onscreen fonts and menus aren’t as polished as those in typical in-car multimedia systems. The Google Maps view on the standard 12.3-inch instrument screen in front of the driver, however, looks great.\n\nIn addition to built-in Google Maps, the new OS includes the Google Assistant and Google Play store for downloading apps, provided you’re logged in with a Google account. A four-year data trial of Google Automotive Services is included, but post-trial subscription pricing hadn’t been announced as of publication. Our test car didn’t have Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity, but Volvo said it will be added as a no-cost over-the-air software update in mid-2022. Stand-alone Android Auto is not offered, which precludes simply mirroring Android phone apps on the touchscreen.\n\nThe V90 Cross Country’s rear-seat cushion is on the shorter side, and it’s set low, so taller passengers’ legs will be a bit elevated. Legroom back there is adequate, but there’s a substantial center floor hump that limits foot space for the middle passenger. Rear passengers can enjoy the full effect of the panoramic moonroof, which lets a lot of light into the cabin.\n\nThe rear backrest folds flat with the cargo floor, and when it’s down, the extended cargo floor is quite long. Even with the seats up, there’s a good amount of cargo space — 18.9 cubic feet, according to Cars.com’s cargo measurements — though the E-Class All-Terrain’s cargo area measures a bit bigger, at 21.1 cubic feet. The V90 Cross Country’s 8.3 inches of ground clearance is about 2 inches more than the V90 wagon’s, but the Cross Country’s cargo liftover height manages to remain reasonable.\n\nSafety and Driver-Assist Features\n\nIn Insurance Institute for Highway Safety testing, the V90 Cross Country earned the highest possible score in all crashworthiness tests. Its LED headlights, however, were deemed just acceptable, the second-highest rating.\n\nStandard active safety features include automatic emergency braking, lane-keeping assist, blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert, reverse automatic braking, adaptive cruise control and Pilot Assist. Pilot Assist is a hands-on driver-assist system that can manage vehicle speed and lane positioning from 0-80 mph.\n\nIn the V90 Cross Country, Pilot Assist favors the right side of the lane, which is a bit unnerving when there’s another lane of traffic to your right. It’s a characteristic we’ve experienced in other Volvos with this technology.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2021 Volvo S90 Recharge PHEV Range: How Far Can It Go on Electricity Alone?\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2021 Volvo XC60 Recharge?\n2022 Volvo C40 Recharge Comes With $60,000 Price Tag, Free Charging\nResearch Wagons and Hatchbacks\nShop for a 2022 Volvo V90 Cross Country\nShould You Buy the V90 Cross Country?\n\nThe V90 Cross Country has qualities people like about SUVs — like extra ground clearance and AWD — but without the traditional SUV appearance. If you want that look — or a third row of seats — the XC90 may be a better fit.\n\nThe V90 wagon offers good value in its small competitive segment, but its sometimes-unrefined ride, limited power reserves and unremarkable touchscreen experience hurt its luxury aspirations. The available air suspension, however, may take some of the edge off the ride, so consider this feature if that concerns you.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Volvo’s 2020 V90 Cross Country is a fantastic alternative to a luxury SUV, with plenty of comfort and space to go along with better handling than any tall, trucklike family-hauler.\n\nVersus the competition: Luxury “off-road” wagons from Audi and Mercedes-Benz are equally capable, but none of them really go off-road. The Volvo is less expensive and just as luxurious as any of its competitors, providing a better value.\n\nI’ve made my peace with the idea of an off-road station wagon that never goes off-road. It is increasingly the only way to get a station wagon in America, as the few remaining traditional wagons are replaced by plastic-clad, higher-riding versions or canceled entirely in favor of real SUVs. So if the only way we can get excellent wagons like the Volvo V90 is in this Cross Country format, so be it. I’ll try my best to enjoy it and celebrate it, because there’s a lot here worth enjoying and celebrating.\n\nThe Cross Country has a lovely shape, a smooth powertrain, a spacious and stylish interior, copious cargo room and top-notch technology. And all of it comes for less money than a lot of competitors will cost you, including the Audi A6 Allroad and the upcoming 2021 Mercedes-Benz E-Class All-Terrain, which will replace the conventional E450 Wagon later this year. \n\nI’ve been a huge fan of the regular Volvo V90 wagon, and our team likes the related XC90 SUV enough to have given it a major award back in 2016, but is the V90 Cross Country just as good, or has Volvo ruined a good thing by tarting it up as a phony SUV?\n\nRelated:  2020 Volvo XC90 Review: An Aging Icon Learns New Tricks\n\nClassy and Smooth\n\nThe V90 CC is undeniably attractive, but I still think it looks better without all the extra matte plastic cladding and higher ride height. The basic V90 wagon is gorgeous, and while the transition to Cross Country status doesn’t exactly ruin its looks, it does temper my enthusiasm for it a little (see them side by side). In the end, you’re still left with a beautiful, long-roof wagon with Scandinavian design cues such as the “Thor’s hammer” headlights and tall LED taillights that extend into the D-pillars.\n\nThose classy looks deliver in the driving experience, too, which is best described as super smooth. The big Volvo exhibits all the characteristics of a premium European luxury car, every bit as refined as competitors from Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Jaguar and the like.\n\nThat the wagon is powered by a four-cylinder engine may come as a surprise, given the powerful, immediate acceleration that’s available when called upon, but it’s true: It’s powered by a supercharged and turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder making a very respectable 316 horsepower and 295 pounds-feet of torque. Power is routed through an eight-speed automatic transmission driving a permanent all-wheel-drive system. The powertrain is smooth and quick, doesn’t produce any intrusive or unpleasant sounds and provides power and acceleration in a seamless rush that materializes without any drama. It feels perfectly matched to its application in this wagon, meaning you’ll quickly forget about the engine and transmission as they blend into the background of your experience.\n\nThe V90 CC handles like the big car it is. Steering feel is heavily boosted, so driving it is a relaxed experience, not something you could call athletic — even when you pop the drive mode selector into Sport mode. Ride quality is fair; the optional 20-inch wheels and tires on my test vehicle were fine on calm stretches of highway, but they fared worse on broken urban surfaces, like the downtown streets of Chicago. And it must be said, while the cabin is comfortable it is not especially quiet. There’s a decent amount of road and wind noise in the V90 CC, likely due in part to a roof rack that sets you up for plenty of rushing noise around the top of the windshield and through the moonroof. \n\nThe turning circle is also rather wide. As an urban vehicle, the Volvo V90 CC is a bit too big. As a suburban family shuttlecraft, it fits perfectly into its environment. \n\nFuel economy can only be called fair. The EPA rates it 20/30/24 mpg city/highway/combined. My week with the wagon returned an overall 23.5 mpg despite a lot of highway driving, which is not an especially good result. It is better than any of its competitors, however, with the Audi A6 Allroad rated 20/26/22 mpg and the Jaguar XF Sportbrake’s standard four-cylinder turbo engine coming in at 21/28/24 mpg. Numbers aren’t yet available for the upcoming Mercedes-Benz E-Class All-Terrain, but the outgoing 2020 E450 Wagon is rated 19/26/22 mpg. \n\nBaby Got Back\n\nOf course, the point of a big luxury wagon — whether it can go off-road or not (and the jury’s still out on whether you’d really want to in a V90 Cross Country, given its street tires and lack of a robust four-wheel-drive system) — is the copious amount of space it brings to the party. And here the V90 CC excels. The front seats are spacious, multi-adjustable and covered in fine quality leather. The view out is acceptable, but the beltline is high, so if you drive with your left arm up on the windowsill you’re not going to be all that comfortable. \n\nThe rear seats are also spacious, with plenty of legroom and width that allows for decent three-across seating. Unlike other big SUVs, like the related XC90, there is no third row of seats, so if you’re looking for six- or seven-passenger utility, a crossover SUV would be a better choice. But if there are only five of you and you still want to carry plenty of stuff while you haul your brood around town, the V90 CC wagon might be the better choice. \n\nDiscussions of how big the cargo area is are complicated, once again, by the different ways in which automakers measure such things. Volvo complicates the situation further by offering up two cargo measurements: stuffing the cargo area completely (including the underfloor storage compartment), or limiting yourself to the “horizontal plane defined by the top of the second-row seatback” — meaning loading the cargo area but still allowing yourself to see out the rear window. According to Volvo, if you load the cargo area from the back of the front seats to the ceiling, you’ll have 25.5 cubic feet, which includes the 2.7 cubic feet they give you under the  cargo area floor. Drop the backseat and you’ll have 53.9 cubic feet. However, if you drop the seats and stuff the thing as full as humanly possible, it’ll net you 69.0 cubic feet of total room. per the SAE International  rating method. \n\nThat’s about even with the 69.7 cubic feet the Jaguar XF Sportbrake (British for “wagon”) gets you and a bit more than the 64.0 cubic feet in the Mercedes-Benz E450 Wagon. Audi doesn’t tell us how big the A6 Allroad’s cargo area is, for some reason. Suffice it to say, there’s plenty of room for your bags and gear in a V90 CC, and interestingly there’s more cargo room in there than Volvo’s own physically larger XC90 SUV, which rates its overall maximum cargo space at just 65.5 cubic feet. This is likely due to the XC90’s standard third row sapping some cargo room from the back (even though that third row does fold down).\n\nTech Galore\n\nVolvo’s novel vertically oriented multimedia screen, so unique when it debuted just a few short years ago, has been copied to varying degrees by other automakers recently (have a look at Subaru’s latest in the 2020 Outback and Legacy), but I still think Volvo does it best. It has excellent readability and is quicker than it used to be. Its ability to be reconfigured is highly useful and it has some interesting controls, such as the ability to touch a button and drop the backseat headrests for better rearward visibility. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are available, of course, and the Volvo-native Bowers & Wilkins premium audio system offers a lot of customization for your listening pleasure. My test car was equipped with the optional Advanced Package, which brings LED adaptive headlights with a cornering feature, headlight washers, 360-degree surround view cameras and a big head-up display for a hefty $2,450. \n\nIt’s Probably Pretty Safe\n\nVolvo has a stellar safety record, but neither the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration nor the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has crash-tested a V90. In fact, NHTSA hasn’t crash-tested any 2020 Volvos aside from its lineup of SUVs, and all of those rated five stars overall; infer what you like. The V90 does have a massive complement of active and passive safety equipment, such as standard blind spot warning with steering assist, rear cross-traffic alert with automatic braking, adaptive cruise control with pilot assist, forward collision alert with automatic emergency braking, road sign information, lane keep and lane departure warning, special headrest designs to prevent whiplash in a rear-end collision and more.\n\nReasonable Pricing to Boot?\n\nSome folks consider Volvo in the same category for luxury as Mercedes-Benz, Audi and BMW, while others think of it as just a premium brand, like Buick or Acura. I find Volvo’s interiors easily as well-done as those in the swanky German brands, but Volvo prices itself as more of a premium brand. \n\nThe starting price for the V90 T6 AWD Cross Country is $55,545 (including destination fee), and as-tested it came to $65,265 thanks to the addition of the Advanced Package, B&W premium audio, a rear air suspension, 20-inch wheels, and a few other odds and ends. That undercuts any of the competing premium wagons by more than $10,000 on base price, with a loaded V90 CC coming in where the Mercedes-Benz E450, Jaguar XF Sportbrake and Audi A6 Allroad just get started. Yes, it’s pricier than the $40,000 and change you’d spend on a loaded Subaru Outback, but perhaps the Volvo can be considered an aspirational step up from the Subie once you’ve made it big. It’s definitely worth considering. \n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The Volvo V90 Cross Country is getting on in years — 2025 is its ninth model year since its last redesign — but we respect Volvo’s commitment to selling a large luxury wagon at all. Most other station wagons have disappeared completely or are only available as 600- or 700-plus-horsepower sleepers like the Audi RS 6 Avant, Mercedes-AMG E53 Hybrid and BMW M5 Touring. But the V90 is just your basic wagon, with the Cross Country designation meaning it rides a little higher and masquerades as an SUV with a little black plastic cladding along the lower body. It’s an appealing package, and it costs a whole lot less than the steroidal hot rods pumped out by the Germans. For 2025, the Volvo V90 Cross Country starts at $60,995 (all prices include $1,195 destination charge).\n\nRelated: 2022 Volvo V90 Cross Country Review: The Almost-Luxury Anti-SUV\n\nRelease Date and Pricing\n\nThe 2025 Volvo V90 Cross Country is on sale now. Full line pricing is as follows:\n\nPlus: $60,995\nUltra: $65,995\nWhat Are the 2025 V90 Cross Country’s Trim Levels?\n\nThe V90 Cross Country’s lineup is straightforward: There are just two trim levels, with largely the same options available on both. Standard equipment on the entry-level Plus includes 19-inch wheels, a panoramic moonroof, a power liftgate, rain-sensing windshield wipers, and keyless entry and starting. Leather upholstery is included, as are four-zone automatic climate control and heated, power adjustable front seats. Cabin tech consists of a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, 10 speakers, and a 9-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.\n\nBuyers who step up to the V90 Cross Country Ultra will get 20-inch wheels, as well as a spiffed-up interior featuring ventilated Nappa leather seats, upgraded dash and door trim, additional adjustability and ventilation for the front seats, rear-window shades and a 14-speaker Harman Kardon audio system.\n\nStandard and Available Safety Features\n\nGiven Volvo’s reputation for safety, it’s no surprise that the V90 comes standard with a generous suite of advanced driver-assistance systems. Standard safety features include forward collision warning with pedestrian detection, automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, lane-centering steering, blind spot monitors, rear cross-traffic alert, oncoming traffic detection during left turns, road-sign recognition, a 360-degree camera system, and front, rear and side parking sensors. The Ultra trim level adds a head-up display.\n\nWhat Are the 2025 V90 Cross Country’s Powertrain Specs and MPG?\n\nThe 2025 V90 Cross Country, like many other vehicles from the BMW 5 Series to the Volkswagen GTI, uses a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine for a balance of power and efficiency. Unlike most other 2.0-liters, though, Volvo’s is both turbocharged and supercharged, as well as a mild hybrid, which helps it generate greater output than many of its contemporaries: 295 horsepower and 310 pounds-feet of torque. The four-cylinder is teamed with an eight-speed automatic transmission and standard all-wheel drive. Volvo says the V90 Cross Country can accelerate from 0-60 mph in 6.1 seconds and returns an EPA-rated 22/29/25 mpg city/highway/combined.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nIs the 2022 Volvo V90 Cross Country a Good Wagon? 6 Pros and 6 Cons\nWhich Vehicles Offer Built-In Child Booster Seats?\nWhich Cars Are Made Outside the U.S.?\nResearch the Volvo V90 Cross Country\nFind Your Next Car\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
