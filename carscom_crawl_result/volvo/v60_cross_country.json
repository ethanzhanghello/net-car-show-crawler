      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2020 V60 Cross Country’s added ride height not only expands its off-road capability, it improves its on-road manners to make the wagon feel more luxurious.\n\nVersus the competition: Outside the Audi A4 Allroad, there aren’t any direct competitors. Of the two, I prefer the Volvo’s in-cabin experience, materials and responsive powertrain.\n\nRelated: Has the 2020 Volvo V60 T8 Polestar Fixed What Plagued Other Polestars?\n\nFor those who don’t want an SUV but would still like some off-road capability and cargo room, options are limited to the handful of raised wagons in the U.S. market. But the good news is that the latest of them, the redesigned 2020 Volvo V60 Cross Country, is quite good and an improvement upon the regular V60 wagon on which it’s based.\n\nThe V60 Cross Country’s intended purpose is to imbue the V60 with more off-road capability. That’s why if you see the Cross Country in an advertisement, it’ll probably be out in the woods or snow, cavorting in nature. That’s also why our first drive of the V60 Cross Country didn’t include any on-road driving: I drove it up a mountain instead.\n\nMy experience driving the V60 Cross Country in that environment left me anxious to find out how it performs in a more conventional setting. One of our chief complaints about the V60 (and S60 sedan) has been ride quality; in his review of the V60, editor Kelsey Mays wrote, “The chassis feels busy over all but the smoothest roads, with noticeable reverberation.” I had a feeling the V60 Cross Country might have solved those problems — in a roundabout way.\n\nSmoothed Out\n\nThe Cross Country’s big differentiators from the standard V60 are added ground clearance and a softer suspension. It sits 2.5 inches higher, bumping ground clearance up to 8.3 inches — plenty for a gravel road. Don’t confuse this raised wagon with a true off-road vehicle; it won’t do much rock crawling or conquer harder trails, but for gravel or other light off-roading, it’s quite competent. (And a more aggressive set of tires than the standard all-seasons would do wonders in that department.)\n\nWhat you’ll notice more on the road and in day-to-day use is the Cross Country’s softer suspension. This echoes the effect we’ve seen in other off-road-oriented vehicles, like the Toyota 4Runner TRD Pro and Ford F-150 Raptor. Those vehicles have more robust suspension setups than the V60 Cross Country, but the end result is similar: The byproduct of a softened, stable off-road setup is a composed ride on the street.\n\nThat’s how the Cross Country treatment transforms the wagon’s on-road character. Instead of jostling you around, the suspension smooths out the imperfections you’ll meet on the pavement, resulting in a comfortably riding vehicle that’s more suitable for day-to-day driving. Honestly, it’s what the regular V60 ride should have been like in the first place, as that car’s tautness doesn’t really pay off dynamically. The Cross Country’s steering feel is a bit light and the car doesn’t turn in quickly enough to be much fun on curvy roads, but it is competent.\n\nThe V60 Cross Country has only one powertrain, with standard all-wheel drive and Volvo’s T5 engine (a 250-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that makes 258 pounds-feet of torque) mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission. The regular V60 is offered with more powerful T6 and T8 powertrains, but after testing the V60 Cross Country, I didn’t feel that more power was needed, either on-road or off (see, once more, the part where I drove it up a mountain). The engine and transmission are responsive and well-suited to the size of the car, with plenty of acceleration for day-to-day driving, and they’re controllable enough to offer some dexterity off-road.\n\nFuel economy does drop off a bit compared with the standard V60, which comes with the same powertrain but is front-wheel drive, making it a bit more efficient. (Only the V60 T8 Polestar Engineered plug-in hybrid offers all-wheel drive and a different powertrain.) The V60 Cross Country is rated 22/31/25 mpg city/highway/combined — 2 mpg less than the V60’s combined mpg figure.\n\nCreature Comforts\n\nThe interior will be familiar to anyone who’s been in a redesigned Volvo over the past few years, but in this case, familiarity doesn’t breed the slightest bit of contempt. The minimalist design and superb materials still look modern and luxurious — and for the life of me, I can’t figure out how those front seats are so thin yet feel so substantial when you sit in them.\n\nThe standard 9-inch touchscreen display is oriented vertically, and after Volvo updated the processing power for the system for 2019 models, it’s much snappier and boots up faster when the car is turned on. Android Auto and Apple CarPlay both come standard, though both utilize only about half the screen when in use (a common problem with these vertical screens). It feels a little small when you’re using it and I’d prefer it take up the top half of the screen instead of the bottom, as that would make it easier to use while driving. When the system debuted, it felt futuristic; now it feels similar to what you get in other luxury makes. Volvo’s new Android-based multimedia system won’t arrive for a little while longer. A 12.3-inch instrument panel display is newly standard for 2020 (as it now is on all 2020 Volvos), but for a digital display, it lacks the customization options of many other automakers (Audi’s Virtual Cockpit being the prime example). \n\nCargo volume behind the rear seats is 23.2 cubic feet, expanding to 50.9 cubic feet with the seats folded. The squared-off shape of the V60 Cross Country’s rear makes the cargo area more of a rectangle, which makes the space more useful than vehicles with sloped rear windows. Volvo also does a great job of incorporating small features to make the cargo space more useful: A divider can fold up from the floor, and there are various hooks and straps around the sides that are excellent for keeping grocery bags from sliding around and falling over.\n\n2020 Volvo V60 Cross Country | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\nValue and Conclusion\n\nThe V60 Cross Country starts at $46,095 (including a $995 destination charge), a markup of $5,450 over a V60 with the same engine. That feels like a big difference at first glance, but as I dug in, my feelings started to shift. The Cross Country has more equipment than the V60’s base Momentum trim, including blind spot monitors, front and rear park assist, and a hill descent control system. Don’t forget about the all-wheel drive and added ride height, either.\n\nIt’s hard to speak on the value proposition of a luxury vehicle in a vacuum, but the Cross Country very much holds its own against the standard V60. My test vehicle came with a good amount of options, pushing the price tag up to $56,990. A similarly equipped V60 Momentum comes to $51,980. The Cross Country I tested came with a $4,000 stereo that isn’t available on the Momentum, accounting for much of the difference. \n\nThe 2020 V60 Cross Country made me swoon — hard. The changes made in the name of off-road ability also fixed the V60’s biggest problem. It’s a smartly designed, stylish and capable wagon that fits both cargo and passengers without being too big to drive around in a city. You can keep your SUVs — I don’t need them anymore.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Volvo V60?\n\nThe Volvo V60 is a luxury wagon with seating for five, offering more interior room than a sedan without the added height and bulk of an SUV. Cross Country versions are powered by a 247-horsepower, turbocharged four-cylinder engine paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission. The V60 Recharge Polestar Engineered has a plug-in hybrid powertrain that combines a turbocharged four-cylinder engine with two electric motors for a total of 455 hp, as well as performance-oriented trim and suspension tuning. All-wheel drive is standard on all V60 variants, and competitors include the Audi A4 Allroad and Subaru Outback.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Volvo V60?\n\nThe 2024 V60 lineup is mostly unchanged. Vapour Grey paint replaces Black Stone, and a power liftgate and cabin filter are now standard on all trims.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Volvo V60 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nAll-wheel drive\n18-inch wheels\n9-inch touchscreen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nGoogle Built-In infotainment system\nAudio system with 10 speakers\nWi-Fi hotspot\nAutomatic headlights and high beams\nAdaptive self-leveling headlights\nFoglamps\nCornering lights\nPower-folding heated side mirrors\nRain-sensing wipers\nPower moonroof\n60/40-split, folding rear seatbacks\nWood and aluminum interior trim\nManual tilt/telescoping steering wheel\nRemote keyless entry\nPush-button start\nLeather seating surfaces\nPower heated front seats with lumbar adjustment\nRemote start\nDual-zone automatic climate control\nNavigation\nAdaptive cruise control with stop and go\nCollision mitigation front and rear\nLane departure warning with lane departure steering assist\nPark assist front and rear\nDriver attention monitor\nFront camera\n360-degree camera\nBlind spot warning\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n19-inch wheels\nHeated steering wheel\nHeated rear seats\nHeadlight washers\nUpgraded Harman Kardon audio system\nHead-up display\nVentilated seats\nPerforated Nappa leather seating surfaces\nShould I Buy the 2024 Volvo V60?\n\nWith plenty of storage and cargo space, the V60 Cross Country is a practical, versatile luxury wagon. Passenger space is limited, however, and its handling is unremarkable. The Recharge Polestar Engineered plug-in hybrid’s performance is impressive, but it’s also significantly more expensive and stiff-riding than the Cross Country.",

      "expert_review": "The Volvo V60 Cross Country competes against luxury wagons like the Audi A4 Allroad and BMW 330 Sport Wagon, as well as more affordable wagons like the Subaru Outback; compare them all here.\n\nWagon or SUV?\n\nThe V60 has a clean, classic look, but the Cross Country version dilutes those attributes with styling cues meant to evoke an SUV. It has more rugged-looking body cladding, larger wheels and an elevated height; there’s about 2.5 inches more ground clearance and overall height than the regular V60. It’s essentially a wagon dressed up to look like an SUV — likely Volvo’s quick-fix answer to our SUV-obsessed culture. The overall look plays better on the wagon than it does on the odd duck S60 Cross Country sedan, but it still muddies the traditional wagon’s classiness.\n\nPoise, Power on the Road\n\nThe Volvo V60 Cross Country feels both energetic and athletic. Its 240-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine is strong with plenty of torque from a stop, with just a hint of turbo lag. Midrange might is even more robust: The no-nonsense eight-speed automatic — which replaces a six-speed auto for 2017 — is responsive, quickly and efficiently ticking off shifts. The wagon powers confidently out of corners and has firm and direct steering, making for an overall grounded, connected-to-the-road feeling.\n\nA 302-hp, supercharged and turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder is optional on regular V60s but not on the CC. Cross Country models do, however, get standard all-wheel drive.\n\nAlthough the CC’s crisp handling makes it fun to drive around town, a couple of things grated on my nerves after a while. Its ride is very firm, amplifying even the smallest crag among Chicago’s endless miles of potholes. Also annoying, the cabin can get loud, partly due to the engine’s gravely, unrefined sound. My biggest grievance, though, is with the auto stop/start system. It hesitates and shudders upon restart — an awkward sensation that’s contrary to this vehicle’s luxury vibe.\n\nWhen it comes to fuel economy, the wagon is mid-pack at 22/30/25 mpg city/highway/combined, matching the base A4 Allroad in combined mileage but not quite up to the 330 wagon’s (26 mpg) or Outback’s (28 mpg) combined mileage.\n\nA Mixed Bag Inside\n\nInside, the design and materials strike a pleasant chord of understated luxury. The leather seats and surfaces look and feel good, and the aluminum trim panels — combined with color-contrast stitching on the leather seats — add some visual jazz.\n\nWhere the V60 fails to maintain that air of refinement is with its controls. Volvo’s new giant, tabletlike Sensus touchscreen multimedia system (found on the XC90, S90 and 2018 XC60) looks slick and is easy to use, but the V60 doesn’t have it. Instead, it makes do with the automaker’s previous control setup, which features quaint, easy-to-use climate control man icons, as well as too many buttons and dials to count. For the most part, the system is easy to use, but the visual clutter factor is high, especially in a cabin with such a streamlined, minimalistic look. \n\nThings to note with this system: Set aside a few minutes to use the navigation system and prepare your reserves of patience. Since there’s no touchscreen, you’re forced to use buttons and dials to input an address. Opting to use a maps app on your phone instead is much faster and less frustrating, but unfortunately Android Auto and Apple CarPlay are unavailable, so you won’t be able to view it on the dashboard screen.\n\nSome functions are just plain odd. To use the tuning button on the stereo you must first  turn the knob to get the system to respond, then turn it more to get it to start changing stations. Then you have to click a button inset in the dial to actually change it to a new station. That’s a lot of steps to do something very simple.\n\nThis system does, however, offer one perk where the new one fails: It’s much easier to turn off features like the engine stop/start system and the optional lane departure warning system because they have clearly marked buttons on the panel rather than being buried a couple of clicks deep within a touchscreen menu.\n\nRoom for People and Stuff\n\nThe front seats are heavily bolstered for a comfy, cozy fit, though one editor felt penned in by the large side bolsters. In back, the space is disappointing; I expected a bit more from a wagon. My 2-year-old twins use rear-facing convertible car seats, and fitting them in was a squeeze. Installation was tricky, and they took up more legroom from the driver’s seat than was comfortable for both me (5-foot-6) and my husband (6 feet tall). \n\nThe available integrated booster system is pretty neat, however. With the pull of a lever, a booster pops up in either outboard rear seat — handy for kids who’ve graduated from car seats and even handier if you’re carpooling with another kid. What they cost, however, is almost as outrageous as a family pack of tickets to Disney World. On my test vehicle, they were bundled into the $1,550 Climate Package, but they’re also offered as a stand-alone option for $500. That’s more reasonable but still much more than my 6-year old’s $50 Graco highback booster.\n\nAlso expensive is the optional rear-seat entrainment system. My already $50,000-plus test car didn’t have this $2,170 option, which is several times more than springing for a couple of tablets.\n\nCargo space is another mixed bag. Good: The seats fold in a 40/20/40 split, easily opening up more cargo space, and the cargo area has a wide opening and low floor for easy loading. Bad: The tiny center console between the front seats can’t hold much more than a phone, though there’s a nice open bin behind the control panel for stashing larger devices.\n\nBehind the rear seats, the V60 Cross Country has 28.0 cubic feet of space. That’s the same as the regular model and more than the Audi Allroad and 330 Sport Wagon, but it’s less than the Outback. Seats down, however, the CC falls to the bottom of the list. Like the regular V60, it has 43.8 cubic feet of cargo space — much less than the Allroad, Sport Wagon and Outback. Volvo’s own 2017 XC60 offers more with 30.8 cubic feet behind the rear seat and 67.4 cubic feet with the seats folded.\n\nSafety Wins\n\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has not yet tested the Cross Country, but the regular V60 — which is structurally similar — earned the agency’s highest crash-test scores.\n\nRear visibility is good, and a button that automatically folds the rear head restraints down is handy for even clearer sight lines. A backup camera is optional, but Volvo’s City Safety, an autonomous braking system that automatically applies the brakes to avoid a collision with other vehicles or pedestrians, is standard. Other available safety features include blind spot warning, lane departure warning and prevention, and rear cross-traffic alert. \n\nIs It Worth It?\n\nThe numbers just don’t add up to a win. The regular V60 starts at more than $37,000; all-wheel-drive adds $2,000. The Cross Country model starts much higher, at $42,695. That’s $750 more than the base price for Volvo’s actual compact SUV, the roomier 2017 XC60, though it has two-wheel drive (and a redesigned one is coming for 2018). The CC undercuts its luxury rivals by a bit, but the Outback costs more than $16,000 less.\n\nThe CC injected some spirit into even my most mundane, routine drives, but it failed to deliver in other key areas — unacceptable at this price.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "While the Cross Country versions of the 2016 Volvo S60 sedan and V60 wagon have higher ground clearance, plus bodywork that suggests off-road capability, their firm suspensions mean they’re best-suited for on-pavement driving.\n\nI tested both of these; reviews of the S60 and V60 on which the XC versions are based are also available. The XCs’ competitors include all-wheel-drive-only vehicles such as the Subaru Outback and Audi allroad. Compare them here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nCross Country models are easily spotted because of their raised height compared with the standard V60 and S60; their 7.9 inches of ground clearance is about 2.5 inches more than conventional models. They also feature skid plates that protect the undercarriage from damage.\n\nThe look wears well on the wagon but makes the otherwise well-proportioned S60 look ungainly. Something about the size of the wheels, raised bodywork and general proportions just doesn’t look right on that body style.\n\nThere are pieces of body cladding on both models that are subtler than previous off-road Volvos, like the XC70. In this way, the XCs manage a more elegant body design than both the previous Volvos and the Outback and allroad.\n\nHow It Drives\nCross Country models are powered by a 250-horsepower, turbocharged 2.5-liter inline-five-cylinder engine matched with a six-speed automatic transmission. The combination is one of the best parts of driving the car.\n\nEngine response is good off the line, and there’s a sensation that there’s a lot of power on reserve if you need it. The XCs move away well from a dead stop, and they’re responsive when you need to make a pass on the highway. There’s a fair amount of engine noise in the cabin, but the engine sounded really good to me, so I didn’t mind.\n\nThe other standout positive of the Cross Country models is their steering. It provides a lot of feedback and really feels connected to the road. Those who prefer a lighter steering setup, though, will want to take a test-drive and pay close attention. These Volvos are among the few cars on the market that have too heavy a steering setup for some people.\n\nEngine response and steering feel give you confidence to hustle a Cross Country, and the suspension is firm enough to reward that kind of aggressive driving.\n\nAnd that’s the problem. The XCs ride so firmly that they’re just not comfortable on the rough stuff — or even on rough pavement. Put another way, I’ve driven the Outback in a variety of off-road settings and have always felt as if the suspension were soaking up some of the crap I was driving over and that the car was working to clamber over and through obstacles. The XCs feel so stiff you worry they might snap. Also, the standard wheels are 18-inchers, with 19-inch wheels optional. Here again, if I were going off road I’d want something with a bit more sidewall (to absorb bumps) than an 18- or 19-inch wheel provides.\n\nConversely, there’s no doubt I’d prefer the XCs’ overall power and handling if I were facing a long drive on twisting roads. In that setting, the Outback just can’t match the Volvos’ poise and power.\n\nBoth the sedan and wagon get the same EPA-estimated 20/28/23 mpg city/highway/combined. Sticking to combined mileage figures, the Cross Country models trail the allroad (24 mpg) and four-cylinder Outback (28 mpg), but edge out the V-6 Outback models’ 22 mpg.\n\nInterior\nIf the off-pavement performance of the Volvos is underwhelming, their interiors are a highlight. There’s a nice mix of high-quality materials. The leather seating surfaces look and feel good, with plenty of support. Side-bolstering is pronounced, but I didn’t find it to be uncomfortable.\n\nVolvo’s material choices are consistent with a luxury brand. Cross Country buyers have a choice of metallic, piano black or wood inlays; our test model came with the wood trim. Normally I’m not a fan of this type of trim, regardless of automaker, but in this case Volvo’s picked a material with good graining and a nice finish that appears attractive to my eyes.\n\nFurther, everything felt good in my hands. What appears to be metal feels like real metal. There’s nothing plasticky or shoddy-feeling in the XCs, although one might want to suggest to Volvo that nobody uses a number pad to dial a telephone number anymore, so we might be able to clean up that part of the center console.\n\nVisibility, however, is an area where Cross Country models struggle. There’s a sloping windshield pillar that blocks a lot of the road, especially pedestrians. Also, the XCs’ sightlines are different from the regular S60 and V60, and I found them harder to park than the conventional models. Both XCs feel like they’re much larger cars than they really are, but, weirdly, the sedan was much more affected by this.\n\nFinally, both models were cramped for me, especially in the headroom department. A moonroof is standard in all XCs, which cut into my space compared with the S60 sedan. That car does without the standard moonroof in lower trim levels, providing more than a half-inch more headroom. The specifications say all other seating dimensions and interior volume are the same between regular and Cross Country versions of the S60 and V60.\n\nWhatever the reason, despite the higher ground clearance it sure felt as if my driving position wasn’t really any higher than it would have been in many other cars. So the effort Volvo went through to raise the XCs didn’t pay off for me, at least as far as my perception went.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThis is another area where Cross Country models struggle. Volvo made a lot of odd choices.\n\nFor starters, using the tuning button on the stereo requires you to turn the knob to get the system to respond, then turn it more to get it to start changing stations. Then you have to click a button inset in the dial to actually change it to a new station. It’s a lot of steps to do something very simple. As nice as the controls feel, it’s just too much work.\n\nAlso, if you want to go from adjusting radio stations to the navigation settings, you have to make a selection from a ring of buttons around the telephone keypad buttons. It’s hard to remember which button is placed where … and even harder to see the buttons at a glance.\n\nDitto with the climate controls, where Volvo has you change the zones that the air blows out of by pushing a profile of a body. Yes, it’s how Volvo’s done it for a while. No, that doesn’t mean it’s good. Simply put, after driving other cars I became aware of how frustrating both the audio and climate controls were in the XCs.\n\nFinally, the Volvo system was the most likely to quit working, either while inputting a destination or while playing music from my phone. That’s highly unusual in my experience testing cars, so it bears mentioning.\n\nCargo & Storage\nCargo space is the single biggest difference between the V60 Cross Country and the S60 Cross Country. It’s to be expected that a wagon would offer more room than a sedan, and this is the case. However, the S60 sedan has an almost unusably small trunk. It’s wide from side to side and extends forward from the rear bumper a good amount, but the opening from top to bottom is quite small. I kept fiddling with items in the cargo area in hopes of finding more room because I couldn’t believe how small the trunk was.\n\nThe V60 Cross Country is better in this respect, offering almost as much volume as the regular V60: There’s a maximum of 43.1 cubic feet with the backseat folded, versus 43.8 cubic feet in the regular V60.\n\nSafety\nNeither the 2016 S60 nor the V60 Cross Country has been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nStandard safety features include what Volvo calls City Safety, which is autonomous braking that — at low speeds — applies the brakes to avoid a collision not only with other cars, but also with pedestrians.\n\nNotable safety options are included in a $925 Blind Spot Information System Package, including rear cross-traffic alert, front parking sensors and blind spot warning lights.\n\nValue in Its Class\nIn some areas — notably interior quality and driving dynamics — the Cross Country holds up well against the luxury class, and it soundly beats competitors like the Outback. However, its ergonomics and especially its multimedia/electronics systems lag not only direct competitors, but the market as a whole.\n\nWhile you could say the XCs’ competition is the Outback and allroad, I’m not sure the better comparison isn’t between them and the regular S60 and V60 models, both of which are impressive on the road and competitive on price when similarly equipped.\n\nFaced with the choice, I can’t see any attributes of the Cross Country models that vault them ahead of their “conventional” siblings. Their increased ride height is offset by their tight headroom, and their driving dynamics and engine response are not superior to the S60 or V60. In short, choosing a Cross Country over another Volvo is a case of picking style over substance.\n\nSend Bill an email",
